    "text": "The experience itself was pretty great for our group.  The lobby and restrooms were clean and inviting, along with the thoughtful lockers to store your belongings.  The service was great is so far as attitude, explanations, and friendliness from the staff.  However, each course was served much too slowly and we had to ASK for the next course repeatedly.  This is not acceptable in multi-course dining.  A guest should also never have to wait for drink re-fills.  This is Restaurant 101.  The environment is loud (which is fine) and if somebody starts a silly song or chant (i.e. Marco / Polo), everybody loudly participates for some good fun.  It's a safe environment and the waiters are very attentive to guests in the dark environment.  The food was average, at best, much like the other diners mention.  The experience is what you are paying for, definitely not quality food.  The dishes weren't bland or bad by any means, but none were \"excellent.\"  As it stands, the place is surely over-priced (almost $70 per guest) since the food quality and speed of service were quite subpar.    They need to work on speed of service and food quality and they could easily be 4 or 5 stars and justify the high price-tag.  P.S.  It was also disappointing to have a group behind us using the flashlight on their phone which kind of destroyed the experience for us.  That group should have been immediately ejected.",

My husband and I stumbled upon this restaurant while searching for interesting vegan dining options in Vegas, and it did not disappoint. Everything we tasted during our 4 course lunch was delicious, and it was so entertaining trying to determine what we were eating based on the various textures, smells and flavors.  Sam at the front desk was very nice and helped prepare us for the for the journey ahead. Our waiter Ken made us feel very comfortable and was very attentive, which made the experience that much more enjoyable.

    "text": "WARNING: THERE IS NO MEAT.  Okay, this is a very mixed review for me. First let me start by saying the employees are absolutely wonderful, and the customer service we received far surpassed all expecations and made the experience an incredibly enjoyable evening.   Next on the review was the experience itself, for something as simple as eating in the dark it was  actually really fun, unique, and everyone in my party had a really great time. They make you lock your phone(and anything else that creates light) up in a locker, which is really cool and lets you enjoy the people you are with. The only real way to describe it, is that it is an experience like none other you have ever tried.   Now for the cons and it falls in the most important section of a restaurant, the food. Heres where everything went very downhill for me very quickly and, why I most likely will not be returning. Apparently their entire menu is all Vegan/Vegetarian, which I was unaware of, because it is not posted anywhere in the location, on the advertisement I saw, and the website that led me to the restaurant had no indication. I ended up paying somewhere between $70-$80 with tip, for the six courses on the weekend. Every plate that came out I was expecting meat, and one after another it was just more vegetables and vegan food. Super dissapointing to pay that much and get food that you really did not like, because you have no choice since its a predetermined selection. I did not feel like the food was worth the money and 3/5 people in our party left hungry, and we had to go get food somewhere else after already paying $70 each.  For that cost you could go to the Bachannal Buffet, Texas de Brazil, and many other higher end restaurants in the city, where you would get a much better bang for your buck in terms of selection, and leaving satisfied.   Overall, to sum everything up the customer service was above and beyond, and the experience itself is really fun, and unique. But coupled with the lack of meat and food variety, it makes for a very overpriced night which left us hungry, and upset that we paid that much for essentially some plants and sauces. I wouldnt be nearly as upset if it was noted in the restaurant somewhere before we sat down. Because we would have just left and gone somewhere else, prior to even getting a table.",

When we heard it was coming to Vegas , we knew we had to give it a go and with a 6 course menu for under 70 bucks it sounded like a complete bargain! What they don't tell you though- is that most the courses are very very small and it's all vegan. Yes you right that right - 100% vegan. Why they are not totally up front about this I don't know ... probably because they figure it would put people off. The food was bland, boring and not worth even half what we paid.

    "text": "The experience is really what you pay for!   Pros:  Our server Willy! Definitely had a great sense of humor and exquisite customer service.  The dark (you have to feel for your food and guess what you're eating and it's fun to speak to people around you!)  THE DESSERT   Servers wear night vision goggles (HOW COOL)  Cons:   7 courses takes too long, and it can get slightly anxiety inducing just sitting there waiting.  The margarita - tasted like it was made with margarita mix. Way too sweet.   The food...I wanted to try flavorful and exciting dishes. Things tasted a little ambiguous? Just veggies with sauce. Some zucchini cut with a spiraled to make it feel like pasta?? Why? I'll have some pasta  Nonetheless I had a great time. Eating in the dark is quite fun when you're not worried about how you look when you eat lol",

They change the menu every 3 months. They do have alcohol options!   Let me just explain the process...you check in, fill out a waiver (don't freak out), then you put your items in a free locker. At that time, go to the bathroom before hand, then go back to the counter to get seated. You meet your server, they ask for any food allergies, hold each others shoulder then walk to your seat. The server helps you sit down, shows you with your hands where everything is on the table, and takes your drink order. They bring you all the courses, they cannot explain what you are eating until the end out of respect for the others eating. When you are done, they stand you up, hold each others shoulders then take you out to the room. I recommend bringing sunglasses to protect your eyes. Go get your locker stuff and check out. At that time, you can see what you were eating.  You have to come with an open mind, but omg it is so much fun!  Coming back soon!",

Feeling around using your hands while hoping for the best. You have no choice but to laugh, smile and enjoy the moment because it's most definitely unique.   I am vegetarian which was nice knowing they were more Vegan based by previous reviews. My friend however wasn't to thrilled about the Vegan base cause he was hoping for the meal to be a bit for filling especially for the price!   Daniel was our waiter which he did great! Good customer service!   Before our meal the lady told us we would be able to see what we ate after we were done. But, when we finished she then apologized and told us she was unable to let us know anything because of a recent menu change. That woulda been nice to know up front.   The food was ok... there wasn't anything I tried that I'm dying to try again (my friend felt the same). Nothing stood out to me as wonderful. Both of us ate everything but the dessert. I love me some sweet sweet desserts which it's extremely rare for me to turn down some sweets but it was way too thick and sweet for our liking.   We would have been ok paying the high price for our meal if it would have tasted better but for the quality of whatever we ate wasn't worth the price. Yet, overall our experience was good. Love the concept!",

I decided to do lunch since it was a little cheaper, and we're going for the \"experience\" rather than the food. We knew it would be all plant based, no meat... but it was just so underwhelming. I've done the one in LA and it had meat on the menu, so it's interesting why they chose vegetarian. Our waitress was very sweet, and the experience was fun. The food was terrible, especially the overly sweet canned frosting dessert. It was almost $200 with tip (we got drinks) and I wish the food would of been a heck of a lot better.",

    "text": "Incredible experience! My husband and I went for lunch and we were blown away by every minute! Our server was Daniel and he took such good care of us - I don't want to give too much of the experience away, but I will say that if you go into this with an open mind, you will no doubt have a great time. There is no question that you are dining in the absolute pitch dark, but the music and food actually distracts you from the fact that you can't see!   I did see that some other reviewers were complaining about portion sizes - this was not an issue for my husband or myself! Our portions felt huge and they were so filling! My husband is 6'4\" and is not a slender man, so if he left full, everyone else should too! There also seemed to be concerns about the vegan/vegetarian menu options... if you want a steak, go to a steakhouse. These are unique and flavorful dishes that go beyond what the average palette is accommodated to. Don't let the lack of meat dissuade you; live a little and enjoy the food as it is all handmade and fresh, not the frozen overproduced meat products that you can expect even at the finest of steakhouses (and trust me, I love a good steak just as much as the next guy, but this was next level!).  Recommended for special occasions as this experience is a bit on the pricey side, but worth every dollar! Also, their menu changes seasonally so there's opportunity to go back time and time again. We can't wait to go back and bring more people with us! Oh, and the 20% local discount is great!!!",

A large group of us attempted to fly to Vegas to celebrate my husband's birthday on 2/21, during the big Vegas snowstorm! Unfortunately several couples experienced cancelled flights and the remainder of our group experienced flight delays. I called from the airport to inform them that we needed to cancel as a result. I would've expected their response to be much more understanding, as who would've thought there would be snow and cancelled/delayed flights into Vegas. The response I received was basically I'm sorry but we'll be charging your card $150 since you guys can't make it.  I get it that businesses need to secure reservations but I'm appalled that there was such a lack of understanding considering the situation was unavoidable and out of my control.  I was really looking forward to the experience but considering their response, I unfortunately will never try to go again when visiting Vegas.",

    "text": "It was definitely the experience...and a long one too. The reservation and wait was just really horrible as others have said. My boyfriend brought me here as a surprise on Valentine's Day for dinner for a 7:30 pm reservation and I was really excited. We came early at about 6:45 pm just to sign the waivers and to make sure we wouldn't be late. We had to talk to the manager repetitively over the course of the night and by the time we were seated it was 8:45 pm. At this point we really didn't want to eat here and pay for the price but if you leave they charge you I think it was $80 a person, something around that. Everyone waiting was extremely unhappy and it was just not the kind of experience you'd want to pay for but they have you locked in with that fee. Not to mention with that many people there, the room was too small to accommodate as well, the guests were cramped with no where to even sit to wait considering the wait time. I understand it's Valentine's Day but if you have a reservation at 7:30 p.m., it's a 7:30 p.m.  reservation...and you shouldn't have to wait till 8:45 to be seated. A few minutes maybe 15 after is understood....but not over an hour!!! The management & staff poorly dealt with the situation, they would keep saying \"30 mins\" \"45 mins\" when it was already our time to be seated, they also said the reservation time is what they base it off of (still doesn't make up for the wait that was over an hour for a RESERVATION). If you cannot handle making reservations maybe it should be just a walk-in basis restaurant only. They told us they were taking guests that were \"late\" to their reservation because of the weather....I'm just not buying that, if you're late, you're late. Taking the late guests just really threw the reservations off by almost an hour+ making everyone extremely upset. Don't take them if they're late, it's that simple. Overall it was disappointing, the manager didn't handle the situation well and it was not worth $80/person. Unsure if we'll be coming back at this point. The only time we were happy that night was when we were finally seated and when we were LEAVING! Had we been seated at 7:30 AND NOT almost 9, the experience wouldn't be so tarnished. Maybe this place is better when the weather isn't their excuse? The food was alright, it's focused more on the experience. I recommend a restaurants on the strip instead, they'll treat their guests much better and you'll be seated on time for your reservation.",

Having no vision takes some getting used to.. that being said our server Willy was PHENOMENAL and I was able to relax and enjoy the full experience. It was date night for me and the boyfriend and it was a success! The food is a mystery until after you eat and was filling and flavorful. My boyfriend and I had a lot of fun guessing the dishes. Apparently we did a good job and guessed a lot of them! From beginning to end it was definitely a sensory experience to remember and all made better by a great sever!   **Tip: if you get a little overwhelmed with the darkness, close your eyes. It feels more natural and helps adjust.. I really didn't open my eyes till the end of my meal.",

I love food and am very open to trying new things and the concept is really unique with the whole being in the dark and being plant based. A star for the cool experience, a star for the staff and our waiter Willie and a star for half of the 6 courses. I just thought the food was mediocre. I understand making it a sensory experience with aromas, cool textures and odd plates but overall flavor felt like they were trying to hard. Its a cool experience, but I probably won't be back, not for the price. Nearly $200 (not including gratuity) and the best thing was the drinks and first three courses I feel cheated.",

Something about being in the dark really helps everyone come out of their shell. We have always gotten exceptional service, but I gotta give Kory props for being the best waiter we've had to date. Very funny, prompt, and put everyone at ease. Also, the menu they have right now is probably one of my favorites. Main course was delicious! The only negative thing I have to say is that where we were sitting, the music was kind of loud. Made it hard to hear each other. Our group is a little rambunctious though, so we think maybe they turned it up so we wouldn't offend other guests, LOL. Other than that, they knocked it outta the park!",

    "text": "Prior to going, I had read that lunch was $50/pp, which seemed expensive, but I was interested in the novelty.  The cost was $60/pp, which was more than I wanted to pay (for said novelty).  But, we were there, so why not.    The hostess wasn't overly friendly, but...shrug.  Our waiter was friendly, but odd.  We shimmied to our table, and took some time to adjust to the pitch black.  While your eyes adjust to the darkness, it never reaches the point of being able to see anything (like you have in dim moonlight), which is of course the intention.  I was glad to have read reviews and the website ahead of time to learn that it's completely vegetarian, else I probably would have been disappointed.  I am also glad we went for lunch, during a somewhat slow time, I would not have appreciated others being in close proximity.  The music was too loud for both my wife and I; being down one sense, you're much more dependent on hearing, which meant you had to speak very loudly to overcome the music.  There were a bunch of giggly people to our right, I'm glad they enjoyed their experience, but on top of combating the music, we were competing with them (to hear each other).  I think it would benefit diners to have sound-dampeners around their eating area, so you can more easily interact with your party (I don't think you'd want complete silence, but a bit quieter music would have been helpful).    The food itself was tasty.  We enjoyed tasting and trying to figure out exactly what we were eating.  After leaving the blackened space, they showed us the menu, but I got sushed by the hostess when talking with my wife about a given dish.  I understand not wanting to spoil the menu for others (there was no one else in the lobby), but that really annoyed me.  If you don't want people talking about the menu, have a different exit, or provide a print-out of the menu for guests to take with them.    Circling back to price, $150 for LUNCH for two was more than I wanted to pay, or felt the meal/experience was worth.  While the food was good, it was all vegetarian (soup, mushrooms, chicpeas, toast, polenta).  I can only recommend this as a one-time novelty, and only if you've won at the casino.",

This is a fun place to hang out with your friends and families. You get to explore and enjoy your food and your surrounding with only four senses. Fun adventure!   Its location is a bit hidden, at the corner of Valley View and Flamingo. Once you pulled into the parking lot, you will find the entrance on the side. They will require you sign a waiver (don't worry, they don't serve anything repulsing or sickening - this is a vegetarian dining place). They will then explain the rule while you are in there such as no standing up, etc. You will be asked to remove any blings attached on your body including smart watch and put it in the locker. No cell phone allowed inside.   The server will then guided you to the dining room. You will not be able to see anything inside, so it is impreative to stay with your server who will guide you to your table. Our server, Anthony was very kind and patient with our group. He explained it all well to us (all first timer). He made sure our drinks were filled up and we enjoyed the food.   There were six courses throughout the dinner experience. I was so full at the end and could not finish my last course before the desert. I thought the food was so so, hence I cannot give it a five stars. Some was good, some was bland. The experience, however, were unique and exciting! I was guessing and visualizing what I was biting...what was the crunch, could it be.... haha that was the guessing game in my mind the whole time I was there.   Overall, we had a blast and would recommend this for a special occasion, birthday, team building, etc. Something you should add to your bucket list.",

    "text": "Spend your time and money elsewhere. For $200 I should leave somewhat satisfied and not feel swindled out of my money and like a child tricked into eating their vegetables.  Dinning in the dark starts out like a guessing game of \"name that dish\" but by the time the main course arrives you're tired of playing games, especially if you're hungry. I know there's a risk that I may not like a dish since it is a \"mystery menu\" but for $80 a person, the food better be decent. The first dish was good but it was down hill from there. I ordered an Old Fashioned which was just a 50/50 mix of cheap whiskey and water.  At the end they show you the menu that describes their food in the most exaggerated way, using the fanciest words they could find to describe their vegetables. \"Surprise, its all vegan!\" they tell me, as if they're expecting me to be enlightened into becoming a vegan.   Look, if you're vegan/vegetarian then more power to you, but I don't go around tricking vegans into eating animal products so please don't trick me or anyone else in to eating vegan food. I'm part of the 95% of Americans that are not vegan/vegetarian and I would expect a restaurant that charges so much to cater to the mass majority. If they decide not to cater to the mass majority then they should prominently say so. Their website says \"Vegan and Vegetarian options available\" but it doesn't say \"Vegan/vegetarian only,\" if this was made apparent then I would have respectfully eaten somewhere else.  The servers were great. If I could, I'd give the service 5 stars and the food 0, but since this is a restaurant the food outweighs the service.   Pros: Great service, clean, and they make sure you're safe when it comes to food allergies (probably).",

I'm normally very conscious of what is on my plate and follow a vegetarian diet, so I was relieved to hear they use a plant based menu! When you check in, they also assess for allergies or other dietary restrictions. So, you arrive at the location in a strip mall and check in. Then, you're given a key to a locker to place all your light-emitting objects: cell phones, even some watches have glowing faces in low light so pack them away. Next, you place your drink order (if you choose), and your server, armed with spy-like night vision goggles, leads you into the PITCH BLACK room. Truly a blackout. After that, it is a whirlwind of 7 courses I've been sworn to secrecy about- but trust me when I say they are delicious and interesting! I was worried that the novelty of eating in the dark would mean the restaurant didn't worry about serving interesting courses, but I was wrong. At the end of the meal you get to see the menu and see how good you were at tasting.   Excellent experience, and I would recommend this to any of my friends, and I'll likely go back if given the chance! Their menu changes a few times a year.",

    "text": "This is by far the most interesting dinning experience of my life hands down.   Coming into a mystery meal, not knowing what you're going to get definitely peaks your curiosity.   The concept you choose your beverage alcohol of coarse and then you choose your flavor sweet, savory or a little bit of both. Then you put your complete trust into your server.   When you are ready to be seated you are  guided into a small introduction room off of the lobby. NO cameras, phones, iwatch or anything that can light up is allowed in the dinning room to ensure the absolute darkness that is expected. They provide each couple or group with a locker to keep all of your belongings safe.  Anyhow you enter first room get briefed and then you are guided by your server into the complete blackout dinning room. All of your other senses starts to take over, smell and sounds are in over time until you sit down your taste gets tested.  Mostly Vegetarian dishes with plays on a lot of spices helps stimulate your taste buds to make you figure out the different flavors you are experiencing.  Do mind the sound for some reason when you can't see you SEEM TO BE SPEAKING A LOT LOUDER. You and everyone else in the room lol!  It was I believe a 5 course meal with an alcoholic beverage to help take off the edge of any anxiety you may have with not being able to see. The whole dinner takes about 2 hours to go through to absorb everything in but you can request to be escorted out for restroom breaks or if you just need a breather.   Oh forgot to mention feel is also a sense that you are encourage to utilize was you are eating your meal. I guess its easier you navigate your food rather then trying to be all proper with your silver wares...or who know what color your spoons and forks were, it was dark lol!  At the end before you are guided out to the main lobby after dinner the server hands the men a rose to present to their date as a surprise.   One of the best date experience ever, bucket list check oh and the owners are so nice! Everyone must try for sure.",

The food is fantastic and it's a blast trying to guess what everything is with your partner.   The plates are very tactile and separate all the foods, which is very helpful. I used my hands to get a mental picture of what the plate looked like and then use my hands the majority of the time to eat, which is a lot of fun!  Be open to the experience and the food and you'll be golden.",

Her voice was so angelic, it made the dining experience much more pleasant. Victoria was very informative and guided us throughout the entire time. The dining experience was amazing!! You don't know what your eating, which makes it fun. I enjoyed the background music they played while we ate. What made it very memorable was the birthday request & how Victoria told my brother to reach out his hand and grab the rose to give to his gf!! How romantic is that?? We also got cool sunglasses at the end. High recommend this place & I hope you get the same waitress that we got!!",

    "text": "I gave this review a week of thought before posting it. Bottom line the food was TERRIBLE and like other reviews noted, was served luke warm at best. I predict that this place will be out of business within 6 months if the management doesn't start making changes based on customer feedback and complaints. This is a one and your done type restaurant but terrible food reviews will stop the flow soon. Sounds cool to eat in the dark but no one wants to eat bad food....ever. I really wanted to enjoy this experience with my family but we all walked away wishing we had spent $250 for lunch anyplace else.   Caution: spoiler alert ahead.   We were the only customers when we arrived. You have to fill out lots of personal information on a computer for their waiver... No privacy policy involved so I made up all our details. We were given the choice of viewing preset menu choices or going with the mystery menu and since we were there for the experience we all chose the mystery menu and the \"Spicy\" entree.  The staff still seemed to be working out the kinks and did not really have the spiel down yet. Bibs were not offered. Water glasses were never brought to our table after several asks. The dinning room was silent and we could hear the staff talking elsewhere. The food was brought out on a noisy food cart and plopped down in front of us without any details offered by the waiter to intrigue you. Lunch had 4 courses. Only one course, the 2nd was decent. None of them complimented the others and seemed to be random. Random may be fun if the food was good but it was not. The first course, a soup of carrot and coconut was watery, a little gritty and barely warm. The second course, 3 corn fritters in sauce was actually good and something to keep on the menu. Our waiter even mentioned that this was the item everyone liked. This should be a hint that management should try and include other menu items people would like. The 3rd course, our spicy entree was a small risotto ball with sauce over limp bell peppers. Not spicy and not much flavor. The texture of the limp and semi warm bell peppers that tasted like day old something was very unacceptable. It was as if it came from a pot that had been sitting out too long. It made me wonder if there was even a chef in the kitchen or if the waiter just scooped premade food into bowls himself. The 4th course, the dessert was a small cup of strawberry mouse with chocolate on top but it was so sickeningly sweet we could not eat it.  Such an odd contrast compared to the bland meal. Sizes were also very small but that did not matter since we did not finish what we were served anyhow.  Once finished we were rushed back to the lobby without the offering of sunglasses as others had mentioned. The check in desk lady was helping another couple that entered and when I asked to see the menu of what we ate she reluctantly handed it to me but sternly told me to make sure I didn't show it to the other people. Yay, okay. Had not planned to.   I get the concept and the likelihood that they will not get repeat customers but this place needs to at least develop a menu that will appeal to the masses, food should be served fresh and hot, music should be played for some ambiance and encourage the wait staff to add to the experience. Tell us what is great about what we are about to eat. Is it a family recipe, is it locally sourced, organic or health benefits, why was it chosen for the menu, why is it special?? You will get more customers if you also serve good food. Listen to the reviews!!!",

    "text": "Pros: The service was great! I really enjoyed our server, the atmosphere, and the overall experience. My friends and I had a blast. I was not sure how I'd feel about the food since I read online it was plant based, but the food was so filling and tasty I could not believe it wasn't meat! We knew the price going into the restaurant.   Cons:   The biggest problem I had with my experience which is why I'm giving it 4 stars is that I think their seating arrangement could be improved. It was not a complete blackout dining experience for me because my chair was facing the door/curtains the servers would enter/exit with the food and I was sooo distracted by the light that was always there due to the curtains. My friends back was to it the whole time and she did not have this problem.  Other minor things: There was an unusual smell in the waiting area. I couldn't quite figure it out but it made me feel like the place wasn't clean or needed a better ventilation system. The waivers they have you fill out auto save your information on their iPads to make it easier if you go again I guess. But if you type your zip code you could accidentally click on someone else's saved info with your same zip code and see their personal info (name, address, phone number).",

    "text": "If I could give them 12 stars, I would. This was the single most fantastic experience of my life. I was very apprehensive initially, because I couldn't tell if it was a gimmick or not, but as soon as we met our server, Anthony I knew it'd be a good time.  First and foremost, I think it's awesome that our server could tell we were nervous, and therefor tried to break the tension with comedy. He was actually one of my favorite parts of the night. I appreciate that they inquire about allergies, and went ahead and verified why derivations of my allergies were okay, if any.   Walking in was terrifying, because you go from the light to nothingness. They cushion it with another room that's partially lit, but the absoluteness of darkness was jarring.   Feeling around to try and discover what foods are what was so fun. Our server wouldn't tell us if we were right or not about what we were eating (except for once on accident) but that made it all the more fun when we got out to see what the menu is (sorry guys, no spoilers from me). They also change their menu every three months, so even though the website says they have sweet, savory, and spicy options, there's a new menu that is actually different now that's one menu for everyone (unless your allergens prevent it).   I love that Anthony noticed when I didn't finish something because I didn't like it. And he was actually very worried that I wasn't going to get enough food and offered me more because I skipped a portion (it tasted fine, but I've some texture aversion issues and I couldn't get over the mouthfeel coupled with the fact that I had no clue what I was eating).   You think the courses are too much, they're not. They're perfect! And a pallet cleanser comes in at the perfect time to change the pace. They did a really good job with this. You could sense the chemistry between the employees inside which was also enjoyable to listen to. PLUS, we got a special gift at the end! (I'm not sure if it always happens, or if it's because it's a holiday weekend)I will probably come here every time I visit Vegas just to see the new menu and have the experience again!   Thanks so much guys!!!",

    "text": "I visited here with a group of 20 people, as part of a Karma International event.  Wow.  So much fun.  Such an amazing experience. It was made even more fun by having such a group of friends. Enjoying the delicious food and drink, and the entire experiential aspect of the dinner, was really really enjoyable, even if you couldn't see me smiling in the dark. :-D  The check-in process required us to sign a waiver and have a short briefing talk.  Then we were led past a couple of curtains and turns, conga line style, to our table.  Sitting down was a challenge when you can't see the people next to you, the chair, or the table, but one that was easily overcome, especially since it's something you've done a few times, likely.   The dishes are not described but are different textures and flavors.  When you're deprived of vision, your other senses are enhanced, and you can curiously consider the scents and tastes before you.  What I liked about all six courses was that the textures were very different and unique.  And very clever in regards to some courses.   The table I was at had only one wine glass spilled, and lots of laughter and guessing.  We joked and teased each other, and had great conversations.   When we were done, we compared notes, talked about favorites, and led each other back into the light.    One note bears emphasizing: The service was absolutely fantastic.  The highest level of service here, with helpful hints for how to eat certain dishes, what to expect from what was on the plate you couldn't see, and refills on water and drinks.  They referred to us by name, which was impressive.    I think this is highly recommended. I can't wait to come back and I hope I do soon.  Really a must try, well done experience for all the senses except for one.",

She did a phenomenal job explaining how to eat what was in front of us. Her tips and tricks were great.  I regret not asking for extra napkins. It seems almost everyone uses their fingers at some point. With all the sauces it became quite messy.   We were disappointed in the food. Vegan restaurants should celebrate plant based foods.

    "text": "After reading the reviews I decided to take my husband here for his birthday.  The service was good, our waiter was great but the experience was terrible.  We were seated in the middle of the restaurant, it was extremely loud. We kept getting bumped and hip checked by waiters that were rushing by. When you can't see, this is a terrible feeling.  The food wasn't very good either. To top it off, they give you sunglasses, after the meal, to help your eyes adjust to the light. I walked into the restroom and realized I couldn't see through the glasses because they were covered in greasy fingerprints. Disgusting!  They then advise you to recycle the glasses in a bin next to the door. They do not clean the glasses before reusing them- at least mine hadn't been cleaned and seemed to have been reissued 100 times. I am thoroughly disappointed by this experience. $250 to yell across the table, get hit by waiters and then instructed to place filthy sunglasses on your face. I need a shower.",

    "text": "I went here with my best friend and her family for her birthday. This review is mostly for the hostess and/or their policy... since it was my friend's birthday, her mom brought lots of individually wrapped and sealed bundt cakes in a bag to share with everyone (to take home at the end of the night). It's Vegas, so it's 112 degrees outside. Because of some kind of \"cross contamination\" issue, we weren't allowed to bring them in. Ok, I understand. So, I remind the hostess we are in the desert and ask if she could just keep them at her desk for us until we leave. But no, the host said the company was \"really proud of their no cross contamination of food policy\" and absolutely no food was allowed inside, even in the front lobby where absolutely no food or drink are being served to guests. So we had to ruin a whole bag of (really delicious) little cakes. They have small lockers for people to leave their phones and purses, in retrospect I should have just shoved them in there without telling her. Meanwhile another patron brought a large gift bag that didn't fit in the lockers and the host happily kept it behind her station. Totally wrapped... what if it was food? I almost made a joke about that but didn't want that patron to get screwed too in case it WAS food. Honestly - and this is my fault - I let that stupid interaction ruin my experience because I walked in there pissed off. And blind. Haha. Our server, Ken, was super sweet and fun, he was the only reason we had a good time. To review the actual dining experience: yes it's weird, disorienting and interesting to eat in pitch black darkness. yes the food is vegan or vegetarian - which is fine -  but I only enjoyed two courses out of the seven course meal. Everything else I tasted and immediately spit out and just sat in darkness until the next course was up. Just disappointing. And holy shit... with tax and gratuity it's over $100 a person!! What the hell? I know it's Vegas and absolutely everything is over priced... and I get that you can't serve people steaks in the dark... but one course was literally ritz style crackers with a fake cheese spread. Another reviewer said \"I wish we just got fast food and ate it at home with the lights off\" and I couldn't agree more.  I'm sorry. I'm still mad about the ruined cakes. Haha. They were so delicious and they were all ruined for no reason. The hostess smiled as she told us \"I feel really bad but yes you have to leave them in your car\" - omg if it wasn't my friend's birthday I would have just walked out right then.",

    "text": "As advertised, you're eating a meal in total darkness. The quarters feel a little cramped and the place isn't terribly comfortable. It felt a little stuffy- not great airflow in general.   The server was very nice and engaging as was the person up front.   The food itself was quite disappointing, especially after reading reviews - it was very salty and greasy; too many flavors trying to be combined. As other reviewers mentioned it is plant based, which is fine with me as I personally followed a vegan diet for many months, but this was not filling food as much as it was just heavy. The dessert was so sweet that I couldn't eat it.   2 stars because for the price it's not worth it, as innovative of a concept as it is. It's not even directly on the strip- it's in an strip mall near the strip, but you're paying as if it's in a prime location. If it was more reasonably priced or if there were some options for the courses I would've given it 3 stars.   I honestly think that the restaurant should consider simpler dishes- stick to protein, starch and veggie as was done for many of the courses but use less seasonings. Or include something like a pasta dish, and explore something like a cashew cream sauce which has an amazing amount of flavor but is still simple. Experiencing the crunchiness, texture, natural flavors of the food would enhance the experience overall.",

    "text": "First dining in the dark experience. Been in Vegas for almost a year and finally got to try it with the wife.   The entrance is nice and appears pretty cleab. They have lockers for you to store your light emitting devices.The dining room itself was pitch black, dark.   The staff was accommodating and very friendly. Kory was our server and took great care of us. My wife was freaking out within the first 10secs of being in the room. We made it to our table, sat down, and immediately had to get up to step outside because she was panicking a little. The host was able to move our table closer to the entrance to help her fears. Kory was kind enough to lend my wife his NVGs for a minute here and there so she would feel more comfortable, knowing what her surroundings looked like. I doubt I would've been able to try the food if it wasn't your Kory's encouragement and positive reinforcement.   The experience was fun. Nice way to test your pallet and how much you think you know about food. I'm sure you'll get some but not everything (unless you're G. Ramsey). Give it a go, face your fears, try it out.",

    "text": "This place doesn't even deserve 1 star, and to start this review off I just want to say I haven't been on my yelp in a long time so I finally signed back in to write this review to hopefully \"be heard\" by someone at this establishment because my experience is one for all to be heard due to getting hit with a plate to my nose during my dining. I am not one to write bad reviews in which the day after this issue had happened I immediately wrote a long email to the business and had no response. Enjoy!.... This place was of interest to my brother and the reasoning we went there is because it was both mine and my brothers birthday and we wanted to try something different. We arrived at the restaurant around 8pm on September 30th the night of my birthday and it was myself, my brother and my fiance. Fully excited we were greeted by an individual who was our server and he had just started a couple weeks prior at this place. We entered the restaurant and believe it or not it was an amazing experience to begin with. We started to enjoy our meals and drinks and everything was good up until I was adjusting my chair a little forward (keep in mind he can see us with the night vision goggles he was wearing and we couldn't see anything through the whole meal) I got hit with a plate to the top of my nose! From that point on I was in pain but I didn't want to ruin everyone night so with my hand over my nose I sat there for about 15 minutes while a migraine headache started pulsing. My experience went from great to crappy in that instance because not only did I get hit with a plate, but through the whole time I was at this establishment NO MANAGER came to see if I was ok! This is not what you expect to happen on your birthday. The server then asked if I was ok and offered to comp me a drink for what had happened. With my mouth held shut because I was so upset that through all of this time a manager had not approached the table I told him that it was fine to bring me a drink but not a martini because he had offered that. \"He brings me a martini\".....I then was fed up with my whole experience that I just asked for the bill. Like really? I literally sat there while all the meals came out and still no manager. We had a show to attend so I figured I would reach out to the restaurant the day after so that I did not miss our show. I walked out to the hostess stand to pay the bill eager to leave this place, and I began to explain what happened hoping someone would get a manager involved but still again no manager around, and to top that off the hostess said it was my fault that I moved my chair and got hit with the plate! At this point, on a $200+ bill I tipped way under 20% and walked out. The next day I woke up with a bump/bruise on my nose, and it was October 1st the day my parents were throwing a birthday party for me and my brother. I wrote a email and waited for a response back.....a couple days went by, nothing from them. As I said in the beginning of my review, I am not one to write a bad review because I feel good customer service and addressing the situation no matter what, will always keep a customer happy no matter the situation to keep the good reviews coming, but not with this place. I then decided before writing a bad review that I would dispute this whole transaction through my credit card company. I also made an attempt a  to contact the restaurant and ask for a manager to speak my mind out since my email I wrote and my credit card company was not giving me any response from the restaurant. I spoke with the manager there \"Theresa\" twice; the first attempt she listened to what I had to say and apologized but did not do anything as a manager to make sure I was happy. Instead she took my number down and said either her or the owner would call me. A month goes by and the dispute I did with the credit card company comes back not in my favor because the restaurant communicated with my credit card company and proved I ate there and provided them with a receipt. I then re-opened my dispute and fought it again providing the credit card company with the emails I sent to Blackout and explained to them I was not being heard by anyone and that was the most frustrating part. I have the money to pay for my bill, but my experience was unacceptable and with a bad experience the customer needs to be heard!  A couple more weeks went by and I was having no luck still and no-one still had reached out to me. I reached back out to the restaurant and spoke to the \"manager\" Theresa again, and she said there was nothing she could do she had given my information to the owners and that is all she can do! I asked her \"so you being a manager can do nothing to make sure I am happy?\" she responded it is not a decision or credit she is authorized to make.  Overall, I didn't want to write this review but I felt the need to be heard by others since this place couldn't reach out to me and make things better to save a customer.",

The first course was two shot glasses of let's say soup to get your taste buds ready. The second course was salad and I had the sweet one. The third course was vegetables and falafels, very tasty but not too sweet! The fourth course was dessert & we all had the same dessert - it was yummy!  That's when I asked for coffee but so far they are not serving hot beverages. After dessert, was all got a really nice surprise! Our server Willy was wonderful! We had a lot of fun & I was full!

A couple big bonuses too: Taking a quick little nap in between courses and no one notices, Never feeling grossed out by  watching others and their bad dining habits,  And use your imagination because the list goes on... Down falls: Wanting to hold your hubbys hand but having to make sure it IS his hand, Tables were small so you have to be careful about sudden movements (we heard lots of glass breaking-OPA!) Toots and burps , you can't point fingers at anyone in the dark! And it's not great if you like to document your meal with #foodporn pics. Just to give you an example, here are pics of my favorite meal of the dinner and the other is Brian's favorite, both incredibly delicious though!  *ISSUE* Valentine's Day perhap? I did not ding any stars for the horrendous long waits past our reservation time. Many people were refunded and had to leave since the wait is brutal if your starving. They did try and bring around drinks in the lobby to the massive crowd, it was very confusing, but they were attempting to bring some relief to the growingly impatient guests. The food and experience did make us forget all of that!",

I'm not in the least bit claustrophobic or paranoid, but I got to say, for the first 10-15minutes your mind plays tricks on you as you're trying to adjust to your pitch black environment.   Food: Everything is plant based, but before you go all \"what, no meat\"?!? I'm not vegetarian and I got to say, I was very impressed. You are not allowed to reveal or share the menu but even if I try, I don't think I can even recall all the different things your palate comes across. It's a 7-course prix fixe menu. Alcohol is extra and they have a good drink selection.   Cleanliness: N/A because again...completely pitch black.  At the end: you go to the same area you started and wait for your eyes to adjust and then the lobby. They show you the menu with the description and ingredients of what you just ate. They request you keep it a secret and they don't allow pictures of the menu.   The ONLY suggestion I have is that they have a picture next to the menu description of what you ate. Each dish was so unique (Including the plates and dishes themselves) that it would be nice to SEE what you felt and tasted during your meal.",

    "text": "Ok so this will be the unpopular opinion it seems like... But... The food was so bad that I cannot justify giving blackout dinner more than 2 or 3 stars. And no I am not talking about food not being plenty like some other reviews are suggesting - we actually thought there was plenty of food (with the menu that we had at least, it apparently changes so depending on the menu maybe there is less food?) and we were full after our entrees. Honestly, if you are not full, maybe you should feel around your plate a bit more because after all, you're not able to see anything and chances are maybe you're not eating half of the food on your plate! I've overheard some waiters telling their tables how much food they have left and actually interacting/talking with them. Unfortunately we weren't so lucky when it came to our waiter either.   Concept: absolutely very unique, no question about it. Definitely could be worth trying if you're interested. We wouldn't do it a second time and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone I know, unless they have a free ticket to get in.   Service: I think we got absolutely unlucky. Our waiter was really not good and he did the bare minimum. His explanations of what we were about to eat were not good and he made no other conversation with us. We could overhear waiters from other tables who were a lot more into what they were doing and provided better explanations, made conversation, etc. So I think this was a relatively big part of why we did not enjoy our experience, aside from the worst part of course which was...  Food: I get it. I'm not seeing what I'm eating. I get it that this is supposed to be about the experience and not the food. But for $160+ for 2 people I expect at least half decent food. We thought the food was just terrible. Every dish we had except a soup and a salad (and only part of the salad was good, majority of the ingredients were sub-par) was incredibly bland and had no taste. Just because we can't see what we eat doesn't mean the food should be so bad. Maybe it was the menu we had that day that was bad? Who knows. Regardless we were unfortunately completely unimpressed, and we really wanted to love this experience since all the reviews are so positive. I don't want to write too many details about the food since I am unsure how often or how long the same menu is used, but I will also say that our dessert was overly sweet and parts of it were dried out, and the last course also tasted like it had been made days ago and was just dry and didn't taste like anything.  So... The unpopular opinion here is that while the experience is very interesting and may be worth trying, and while the food is plenty, the taste of the food is just not worth the money. If it were mediocre food, I would have still given this place a 4 star or so review, but it was just that bad in our opinion.",

Super friendly and welcoming from hostess to server and they did a great job of verbalizing in detail where everything was located on the table and plate to make the experience manageable and enjoyable.  7 course meal including dessert took about an hour and half which was perfect.  The dishes all had unique tastes and smells to help guesstimate what you were eating and after dining they provide you w a menu to see exactly what it was you had tried. Great way to get people off the phones and into conversation over dining.",

    "text": "I was extremely interested to try this dining experience once a friend mentioned that it was somewhere in Las Vegas.  Certain types of food that I never thought I would have ordered (after being able to see the menu after the experience) in light was totally delicious \"in the dark.\"  I have a wider palette than I though! I could not believe how delicious the food was, and even the drinks left me wanting more!    This experience and foods hands down was an incredibly unique experience.   My husband thought it would be funny to stay silent when I was whispering if he was there as I got scared in the dark briefly for some reason.  But I eventually calmed down and tried to let my senses take over Daredevil style.  Unfortunately, I could only identify one broad based food, while my husband could identity a few.  But I found myself really enjoying the experience - and the fact that you really get to enjoy the company of those closest to you phone free (you put your personal items in lockers) helped us to discover that we could actually have a conversation without our phones. This could have been the longest time my husband and I have ever been awake without our phones.  We - gasp - survived.   Not only do I have an appreciation for the experience, but I have an appreciation for how much I relied on my other senses and how much I really need to branch out and try other foods cause that food was super delicious!  The best part is, you don't get judged for how much you eat because your company can't see whether you've eaten your entire plate or not!  I destroyed some of those courses!  I also tried to sneak some food off my husband's plate, but I got caught cause he was trying to do the same thing.  Awkward.   In short, the experience is \"eye opening.\"  Also, the waiter Corey is super hilarious!  My husband are I were repeating jokes he said later in the day.  He turned the 5 star food into a 5 star experience as well, and we were very lucky to have him as a waiter.  Even the hostess/greeter at the front when you enter was super friendly, and I just hope they are also reading this and understand what a fantastic time we both had. My husband, who originally didn't care for this experience, had a good time.  My husband, who doesn't like being away from his phone for more than 2 seconds, liked the experience.  He was glad he went.   In short (again), this was way longer than I anticipated. Go now. It'll be about $200-$300 for tip for two people, but totally worth it for an experience no other nearby restaurant has!",

I suggest requesting a seat away from the entrance. The food was really good.  The flavors were great, but if you're like me and love meat then you'll be left wanting to have a some texture or flavor of protein.  They use a lot of starch and carbs I think.  It was still good though.  Dessert could be better.  Wasn't impressed with either desserts.  Overall, my fiance and I had a great time.",

You are briefed by your server who will explain everything in detail about what will occur. Your server has night vision goggles but you are in complete darkness! You follow the server to your table and they explain where everything is located and you start your dinner!   Dinner is 6 courses, you have no idea what you are eating but it's super fun to guess! (All my guesses were completely wrong LOL) The darkness is designed to heighten your senses. There is music playing so it's not complete silence while in the dark.   The food was honestly so amazing! I loved every dish and they were all things I would have never chose on my own! At the end of the dinner you come back out to the lounge for a photo, to pay, and they present the menu you had so you can see what you were eating!

It was an entertaining game I played lol. We were also very fond of the playlist.

I was expecting this dinner to not be very filling since it was a plant based meal, but by the fifth course I was feeling quite full. The food is way delicious! They will describe to you what you are about to eat (mostly finger foods) but won't tell you exactly what it is so it can enhance your sense of taste (I personally liked the mystery of it all). They do have a menu for you to look at afterwards if you are curious, but during the meal you are in complete care of the chef and staff! They also change the menu up every week, I was told.

Add in the pitch darkness and you create an experience where you really try to identify the textures and the individual ingredients in each dish. You find yourself wondering what that ingredient is that you know is so familiar but just can't place.  Yes, it's vegetarian food, but you really don't feel like you're missing anything - and neither of us could finish all the food.  The owner and waitstaff brief you on the process and patiently work to orient you to your environment. If you ever need anything - since you can't see your waiter - you just raise your hand and they come attentively. Yes I heard a few spills and drops through the night, but it really just added to the experience as we were laughing and having so much fun.  They change the menu every 3 months so we can't wait to come again and re-experience it.  This felt like so much more than a gimmicky experience - there really is something to blind yourself and enhance your other senses as you create an intimate moment for your food and whomever you bring.",

I took the risk, trusted the staff and left extremely disappointed. I did not hide my disappointment. My waitress apologized for 5/6 dishes because I was unhappy. 2. It should not be a secret that this is a vegan restaurant. There are only meat like items.   -The menu can be secret, but tell people in advance the type of restaurant. I was thoroughly upset. When we first got there and asked about any conditions to be aware of, my bestie told them she is vegetarian. The girl said ok no problem we have a menu with options for you. I said I am not a vegetarian and no allergies. She said ok no problem. During the experience, I kept asking will the next course be my main meal with meat? (I actually asked for meat)  I repeated I'm not vegetarian and expressed my concern there may be confusion in the kitchen. The waitress kept saying possibly... I can't ruin the surprise...test your senses. I think that would have been a good time to tell me I am not getting meat or fish.  3. The price...$70 per person. There was one course that I fully enjoyed. The other courses I didn't eat everything due to bland taste or certain veggies I have never enjoyed.   I am not ok paying so much for a meal that I didn't enjoy. It's pitch black so you're  not paying for the ambiance. I expect to pay for great tasting food... whether all vegan or meat included- a price that high MUST be great tasting food. This did not cut it for me.   I wish this new business the best of luck! It is a good concept.",

The experience was so much fun, and on top of that, the food was great. You literally can NOT see a thing, not your chair not the food. Eating with our hands was welcomed. I recommend this place to anyone! And if you're worried about being a little anxious, that's okay. I was a little also. But our waiter Anthony made us feel safe and comfortable. I'll definitely come back to show a friend this place.",

There are two things I realized are not for me .  1. I'm not made to dine in the dark  2. I'm definitely not a vegan  I'm all for paying for the experience of it but I'm not sure this was a $200 experience  I'm a foodie and I just couldn't get into it . This was not near gourmet in any kind of way . Portions were probably more suitable for a kid . I really liked the salad . All 4 bites of it lol .. I appreciate that they offer a free bottle of wine on your birthday . I showed my ID for it upon check in. When we got the bill it was on the bill so i asked about it . The girl told me she wasn't the one who checked us in and she needed to see my ID again . Better communication between the staff would be a plus . The sewer smell in the lobby area is definitely a turn off when you are about to eat a meal . All in all it's a cool concept . Something you should definitely try at least once .",

We got dropped off by our lift at 8:19... our Reservation was ay 8:30 they have on record that we went back at 8:56. After the first 2 course we fine but after which we started to realize we had been there quite a while we asked for the time 3 times... after the second we were told 8:45 ( remeber they said we got there at 8:56) however once we said no way that is thr time....the waitress came back and told us in fact it was 10:20 alot later than she had thought.   We were told dinner would take 45 to 90 min. After it took very long to get water and our 4th course where we requested to have all others prepaired now and not to wait till we were dones with this one. After awhile and still no water....We realized we were the only table left in the room.   We raised our hands, hollared and even yelled for someone anyone and no one was in the room. We finally had enought after a plate was neviously pushed off the table and still no one came to help. We desided to get up and try to leave our selfs when, we were a few feet from our table when we finally met by our waiter. It was 10:55pm then...they  close at 11 but tecnically we still had 2 courses left ....   We paid the full $212 for 3 people. And left. The next day i called to speak to a manager and where they refunded $70 based on the fact that we didnt finish our last two courses.  They argued that the time that we had experience was typicall.... even at 9pm to 11pm that is 2 hours not 1.5 but we werent done we still had 2 courses left.   HOWEVER that is not my biggest consern.  My consern is you trust them to keep you safe as you are completely vulnerable in the dark and yet there was no one in the room with us for at least 20 min.   We had no way of calling them but yelling and they still didnt come. One of my friends that was with us is highly allergic to dill we exspressed this and the other is very much afraid of the dark. So we have to trust the staff to keep us safe..... We felt very taken advantage of and disrespected by the responce we got.  I suggest a policy change where someone is in the room at all times. It is irrisponsable and dangerous for there not to be. Go at your own risk if there is not a policy change.",

The first time it was just my husband and I and I was so excited to celebrate my brother(s) Birthday here. We were a party of 7 and I promise you everybody's plates were cleaned. The experience of being in the dark with out any technology and the worry of if we have food on our faces is the best! So So so much fun. The staff is amazing and we were so happy to have Anthony again. We enjoy this place so much and can't wait to become back.

The ambience was chill, you are in complete darkness which heightens your other senses. The music helped set a great feel. Although it does get noisy as the room fills up with other guests. This is all part of the experience.   We went for lunch which was a 4 course meal and was plenty of food to fill us up. Each course was flavorful and delicious. They did an amazing job using tastes and textures to entice your palate and tickle your senses. I read many reviews about the portions being small and I have to disagree, I could barely finish all my food. The portions were perfectly sized since you cannot take left overs with you.",

Course after course, my omnivore comrades gushed how much they loved the plant-based cuisine; it was truly one of the best meals I've ever had. Yes, you should expect to splurge a bit here, but it's designed for a special outing. Even the plates have crazy shapes that are fun to touch. I recommend this sensory experience to anyone.

It was for a birthday dinner, they didn't do anything but wish my wife a happy birthday as most restaurants do a little something extra.

They're not big portions, which was the only downfall, but everything was so tasty! We enjoyed all the dishes that were served. Never would've guessed half of the menu. Just wish the portions were bigger (ie: 3 pieces cheese and crackers are considered a course, and two pierces of chocolate were another). Their menu changes every two-three months. The price for the dinner experience does add up. About $80 pp, not including drinks. But this is definitely something everyone should try at least once.",

And won't tell you when you ask. Expect to pay $100 a person. And for the food they provide that's too much.   They break the price into entry and food, but let's be honest that's a way to confuse the attendee. It's a restaurant. To have a hidden $30 entry fee without telling you till AFTER is extortion.   Our server was fun and added a lot to the experience.   I'd love to give a big 5 stars to the idea and the creator, but not after being so overcharged.   The food wasn't worth that price. I won't spoil The \"surprise\" of the menu, but suffice to say the ingredients don't warrant $100   Somehow Vegas has come to an agreement that it's ok to add a lot of hidden charges to bills and patrons will write it off as \"oh well, it's vacation.\" I think that is a shitty business practice.   I'd love to suggest everyone try it, but I don't support they way they aren't transparent with the billing.   Go home and eat with a blindfold and save yourself $100.",

If you want blah, bland, unflavored, disgustingly nasty food in the pitch black dark and then be ripped off with an outrageously high bill for that garbage, this is the place for you! If not I highly suggest going for a different type of crazy dining experience that might have flavorful food with some substance! After spending pretty much $100 a person, we all had to go find food to eat after leaving because we were still starving hungry! What a horrible way for my wife and mother-in-law to spend their birthdays!!! I feel like I have been ripped off beyond measure!! Though the guy Cory was nice we didn't come there just for a guy to be nice and spend $100 a person!!! Then I call to let them know how awful the experience was and they don't even care!!!

Upon entering, there was a strong chemical smell, not really like a cleaner. After signing away my life with a waiver, we headed into the dark.   I must say our waitress was great and guided us effectively on eating the meal. The cocktail my wife had was tasty, but nothing special. The food left a lot to be desired. As others have mentioned, pretty much everything has a sauce covering it, which also makes things messy. Each course is served in a variety of oddly shaped plates and bowls that hide the small courses and makes eating difficult. The ending \"bonus\" dessert was very good, though.  The music playlist was amazing, which is why they get two stars.   The price is ridiculous. I understand the Vegas tax, the experience, whatever you want to layer on to try to justify the price but it's absolutely not worth $80/pp. There's nothing at all special to the food, I could totally understand $40 (as is itemized on the bill), but the additional entrance fee is BS.  The group of ladies that finished slightly before us asked us what we thought outside. They all didn't like it as well.",

Worth noting that our server (can't recall her name), was what really took the experience from being great to unforgettable.",

Service was great and they were so funny while playing the characters , the food was amazing my favorite was some kind of pasta with tomato sauce and the desert . I thought I'll do good since I watched every murder show there is but unfortunately I got the murderer wrong .  The girl sitting next to me was there before and she was convicted she had chicken there last time , but it's actually plant based and you can't tell the difference .  Bottom line it was a great experience with great food and entertainment so definitely worth going there",

I think skipping one meat meal never killed anybody. You'll be surprised at how filling and delicious the courses are. The creativity of the menu still shines through even in total darkness. Like everywhere else, when you dine out you partially pay for atmosphere. Here you get an unforgettable experience. I suggest you go with people that you trust and are well behaved because the darkness does require you to challenge your trust issues and experience something new .  The last two times I went, the menu was the same. However I look forward to coming there again in hopes that they create something new . My only suggestion is that maybe they can ask or keep track of patrons that have dined there before so they can offer something new every time.",

The menu is all vegan also which I had no idea and no one told me. Wish I would checked yelp before even thinking about going to this place. I'm literally eating McDonald's an hour after spending 167.00 at this place including tip. Completely unsatisfied, the Big Mac is more gourmet then the food at Blackout.

The food was incredible. We had so much fun trying to guess what was in each item. Every dish was delicious. The servers do a great job describing where everything is on the plate which makes eating much easier. Our server, I believe his name was Will, was really fun and made the experience really great.   Since you don't have any electronics or anything, you don't have to worry about being distracted. It's all about spending time with the other folks there with you. A very immersive experience.

But as you go on through the courses of your meal this is the most exciting time that you'll ever experience in life!!!! It's so much fun to dine in the dark! To dumb all of your senses down, shut off all entertainment (phones) and just ENJOY your dinner partner.  The only thing that you have is each other's conversation to stimulate you. This was a GREAT birthday gift from my boyfriend.  I had an exquisite time dining in the dark and would definitely do it again upon my return to Vegas.",

Took maybe a single bite out of all of them. My server acknowledged I did not like the courses. When it was time to pay I let them know I didn't eat any of the food. They still forced me to pay 100 and said because I sat through the entire experience that I am responsible for paying. I have class so I paid. However, if you walk in here know it is a scam. If you don't like the food get up and leave immediately. Thanks.",

The wine was so bad and so expensive. Run. To top it off they tried to rip us off by overcharging for ...... not eating in the dark. Tourist trap indeed.

    "text": "I think this is the first time that I planned to go to a restaurant Not knowing it was plant-based. Talk about a pleasant surprise! I called to check on vegan options and Voila! It was meant to be.   DH and I have been to a dining in the dark place before, but this was many years ago, before I was completely vegan. How cool that they have a restaurant with this experience that anyone can enjoy (and they do cater to dietary restrictions as well, offering gluten free options and asking before dinner about food allergies).   We were carefully guided to our table by Mike (and I didn't trip, even in heels!) I loved that we didn't have cell phones to distract us or take away from the blackout experience. Every dish was a culinary delight, and we had so much fun guessing what we were eating. The waiter tells you where everything is on the plate, and you get to try each item together and talk about what it could be. I was amazed that there was no dairy, everything was so creamy and indulgent.   It was a Lot of food, I will warn you. Go there hungry. We were so full after dinner we went straight back to our hotel  My omnivore partner was amazed that he wasn't hungry after eating a plant based meal. He couldn't believe how delicious  and filling everything was. His only complaint was the price- I told him it was our one splurge dinner for our Vegas trip. (So now I have to eat on the cheap until we leave lol). So Worth it.",

I was served a soup, then a plate, then another plate and then another plate and then dessert.  The soup tasted like tomato to me - it was very delicious.  It wasn't tomato :) then next course were 3 fried round thingys with three different dipping sauce.  Each piece was in it's own sauce and Shay explained where everything was in detail.  The next course were \"noodles\" which was the best thing in my opinion.  The final course, before dessert, was a savory pastry but I was so full by then I could barely finish it.  The dessert was just enough and was very yummy.  They do show you the menu at the end of your experience but I won't give anything away.  The downside to my visit was a group of 6 women wearing \"Lucky\" hats.  They were loud and obnoxious and completely ruined my experience.  You are told to use inside voices, but these rules didn't apply to them.  They were so ignorant, yelling how they should have bread and why is it so dark (duh - it's the entire point of the experience) then they were SCREAMING for Shay (she was getting their food).  Then they were talking how they were going to leave and crawl out, which is impossible because it's pitch black.  They were also wearing light emitting jewelry which was just dumb because they do tell you to put everything in a locker.  The locker area is secure and you're given the key that you keep on your person.  If it weren't for this uncivilized group of women, I would have had a much enjoyable experience.",

    "text": "This server's for hire, even if we're just dancing in the dark...  TL;DR Feels like having your eyes closed the entire time, great for connecting to people, food is vegan and filling, staff really enhance the experience, well worth it.  I knew this place was going to be a memorable SNL sketch that my work team and I would remember for the rest of our lives. The experience did not disappoint. While in town for CES I choose this restaurant as a team building event for our group.   This is a 5/6 course meal that lasts about 90 minutes to 2 hours depending on the busyness of the staff. Dining with me were five guys from work so I got razzed like a baby sister when they found out the restaurant was all vegan food (they accommodate allergies), then when we arrived at an unassuming strip mall way off strip that had limited signage looking very sketchy, next when we had to sign a waiver to enter, and then as I laughed when they all texted their wives a goodbye message because we had to place all devices that light up in a personal locker.  Lastly, I got one last groan when we had to walk into the restaurant single file holding each others shoulders, because seriously it is THAT dark.  What's pretty cool is the staff all wear night vision goggles to wait on you. Plus they learn your name because they have to direct you once you are inside. The service was great but a little slow, mostly because the staff not only wait on you but are also your bartender. If you need something you raise your hand and they come over to help. You can leave for the restroom, but it will be hard to readjust. Our server did a great job orienting us pretty quickly to our dishes, glasses, and table. I put my hand a 1/2\" from my face and could see nothing, it was like that the whole time.  A cautionary tale, apparently some people experience claustrophobia because of the enveloping darkness. I'll admit that for the first 2-3 minutes I got a little anxious, but once I knew where my cocktail glass was I was fine. One of my peers, who was more uncomfortable, saw a faint green light from a smoke detector and stared at it with longing to center himself in the darkness. Our server said, 90% of the people adjust pretty quickly including my peer who never lost sight of that light. Also you will be eating with your fingers and may accidentally spill your wine or gravy, no worries as the staff is very friendly to help you.  I won't give away all of the experience, but you do get perspective for those people that are vision impaired. Or like my new boss admitted, get a chance to face his fears of going blind while being with your direct reports...lol   Your other senses do become heightened. The food is okay, a little under seasoned, but filling. The music, which started out great turned into club pop that was really off for the mood. But the conversation-oh the conversation with my team was the best we've ever connected. Our table topics were slightly vulnerable, a bit confessional, and had lots of humor to offset our unique shared experience. A great team building or friend building experience, but more likely a one and done trial.   Recommend next time adding in a little Bruce Springstein's \"Dancing in the dark\" since they hand all ladies a rose at the end.",

At first, all I kept thinking was that show, Black Out, where one has to complete certain tasks in total darkness. As I signed the waiver, even though I was assured none would be served, I pretty much told myself I was going to eat a bunch of live bugs in the dark.   I was very relieved that nothing I ate contained any live bugs and once I calmed my nerves (the music helped) as I'm afraid of the dark, I found myself really enjoying the whole experience. Eating in complete darkness really perks up your senses and it was fun trying to figure out what we were eating.   I think this is one of those 'bucket list' things that everyone must experience at least once.  :)",

Before you enter the dining area you are asked to put your phones and any light emitting objects in a personal locker. You get the key so everything will be safe.   Your server will then slowly take you to your seat. Make sure you pay close attention to what they are saying because they are your eyes!  After you're seated you will choose something to drink and a flavor pallet for your multi course meal. While looking forward to this event I mostly focused on the eating in the dark aspect but was blown away by the food! Everything was very flavorful, fresh and fun.   The staff was great and we really enjoyed our host. Our host/server was very friendly informative and made us feel comfortable in the dark.   This was definitely a great experience and I can't wait to bring back some friends and family.  Blackout: Thank you for the great start to our anniversary weekend.

The reviews that take about \"horrible tasting food\" are definitely picky eaters. THE FOOD WAS DELICIOUS. The 7 course meal the chefs had designed was amazing. I would never had thought about getting anything like we did if I viewed the menu. But it was such a great experience to try new things and see what you could like. The experience was amazing as well. We couldn't stopped laughing at the fact how we literally could not see anything. Having to feel around really shows you how much we rely on our vision! Lastly, we had such an amazing waiter, ROSCO. He was so kind and made sure we were consistently doing good. He helped up move around and explained each dish so vividly. Even explained the shape of the plates! It made things go so smoothly for us. Also he was very charming and made us laugh and feel completely comfortable. Definitely ask for him if you could!   Thank you again blackout for such an amazing experience! We left nice and full and curious for new menus!",

    "text": "You read dining in the dark but nothing prepares you for how dark it is!   That sounds like the most obvious statement but it is the first thing you hear from everyone as they get seated.  But let's start from the beginning.  Walking in, you go into a waiting room area where you are asked to put your handbags, electronic watches, and phones into a locker.   So take pictures first!  Once you do that, you will be asked to sign a legal disclaimer (as expected).    You then get offered a drink menu where you can order some specialty cocktails.  After that, it's GO time.   We were escorted by Ashley who was perfect for blackout dining virgins.  She was funny and really took time to explain everything each step of the way.   I held her shoulders and the boy held mine and we were on our way.   It's SO dark guys.    For us it was a fun date experience as we worked together to try each other's drinks and talk about what we thought we were eating.   Oh yes, important fact:  they will not tell you the menu until the end.   This doesn't matter because the food was delicious.  Nothing made me happier than finding a deposit of food that I missed on the plate.   We laughed the entire time and truly enjoyed the experience.  For meat eaters, adjust your own expectation down a bit.   This isn't a steak house but it is really great plant based food.  I do think it is a bit pricer...could be maybe 10-15% cheaper for what you get but no regrets.   We were told they change out the menu every couple of months so I will definitely go back.   For those interested, 2 of us with 2 alcoholic beverages ran about $240.   They do lunch as well which is a little less expensive.   They also currently have a Groupon which will save you some money if you can schedule in advance.    I highly recommend trying it at least once!",

They lock your stuff up in a locker like you're in grade school again, and walk you into the pitch black dining area like a human train with their night vision goggles.   Speaking onto the sensory deprivation part, you really are legitimately deprived of sight. Me being me, I found myself looking around everywhere anyway knowing no matter what direction I looked in I'd see the same thing... pitch black. I just found it worth noting simply because all of our table had different discussed behaviorism in this environment. It was very cool and unique.   I do wish this place wasn't EXCLUSIVELY vegetarian, however. That would have amplified the experience for almost all of us. Even just as an option, it would have been nice.   I'd recommend but on the caveat that you're very orally experimental and not easily queezy. With your taste heightened, the stuff that's good is really good, but the stuff that's bad is really bad. State your allergies or uncomfortable foods in advance and you should be okay for the most part. But for real... meat... get it in here.",

The overall experience of eating in the dark is something new and different and my boyfriend and I loved every minute of it. They bring the courses out individually (two appetizers, main course and dessert) and you get to try each dish and figure out what you are eating (and they do ask before you are seated if you have any food allergies). Then at the end, when you are brought out, they will show you the menu and let you know what you actually had; trust me you are in for a surprise, we were definitely wrong on virtually every dish. I highly recommend this restaurant!  P.S. For couples there is a cute little surprise added on as well!",

And as many reviewers have already commented on and I can also confirm, the food is served lukewarm and is tasteless until you get to the overly sweet desert. I swear it is like grade school cafeteria food.....only vegan style.  The owners have to be pinching themselves in disbelief at what people are willing to pay (myself included) for the craptastic food just because they have the lights off.   I need to open a knock off across the street for $10 bucks less per person and actually serve edible food and I would have lines out the door! Seriously you can expect to pay $100 per person (including tax, tip, and one drink) for a $3 meal.   You will laugh, and you will be heading someplace else to eat afterwards.",

To remove the sense of sight is at first a tad concerning but as we adjusted it just heightened the mood and experience all together.   Note that our service took almost two hours so be prepared.   Also, my non-vegetarian boyfriend enjoyed it just as much as I did. No need to worry about the lack of meat!   I would've really enjoyed to see photos of the dishes we enjoyed afterwards, although they do show you the printed menu. Seeing what the dish looked like and comparing it to what our imagination has created throughout the experience would've been the icing on the cake! I hope they take this into consideration as time passes.  Another suggestion would be to turn down the lights in the lobby/front room area. It's so bright! Something to set the mood and help adjust our eyes upon entering and exiting would be greatly appreciated.",

Don't go if you can't handle that aspect. The menu is a surprise, so if you are a super picky eater don't ruin everyone's time by going. (The guy at the table next to me wouldn't stop complaining and he clearly would have been better off with fast food.) It's 6 courses but they don't skimp on the food - I left full and ready for a nap! The tables in the dining room seem to be close together so it's a bit loud and you can certainly hear conversations happening at other tables. I think people naturally talk louder too with their sense of sight essentially inoperable. This didn't bother me and aside from the one whiny guy I thought it made for a fun, laughter filled room. You can't take yourself too seriously when fumbling around trying to eat with a fork in the dark :). I loved the menu, and even the one small bite I didn't care for seemed to have fresh ingredients and it forced me out of my box to try something new. The service was super even despite it being a busy Saturday night. Mike, my waiter, kept me updated on food status, kept my drink full, and checked in frequently on how I was enjoying everything. JP at the front desk was totally on her game and kept the lines moving (completing forms, assigning lockers, checking guests out, etc) - it's a busier than normal hostess role and she performed it well. I'll be back next time I'm in town!",

When you enter, they make sure you put up pretty much everything and you sign a waiver. They ask for any food allergies you may have or even things you don't like so you will actually enjoy your dish. Once through the curtains, our waiter explained the whole process and guided us to our seats. We went to lunch, so it was a four-course meal instead of the five or six they serve for dinner; I still left feeling ten months pregnant so trust me, they serve more than enough. I'm beyond surprised I didn't spill my water but I'm even more surprised my lipstick was the only thing I ruined! THE DESSERTS. OH MY GOD THE DESSERTS. I used to work at a bakery and I even bake on the side but my god nothing can compare to the desserts they serve you.   I think I may have actually lost more of my eyesight since dining here... worth it.

Our waiter, Anthony, was patient and kind as we got acclimated to total darkness. He did a fantastic job at describing our surroundings before each course. The food was AMAZING, and the staff paid close attention to our dietary restrictions. They change their menu every three months, and I can't wait to go back for more :-)",

Yes, there's 6 courses, however, each course is small and bland. It's a mystery  menu, all plant based food. The food was so disappointing, I don't even know where to begin. Honestly,  if the cost was only like $40.00 per person maybe I wouldn't be so upset. I can't help but feel cheated. Good service, unique experience,  but the whole point is to have your sense of taste and smell heightened. Well, mine was, and I was painfully aware of the lack of flavor and originality of each dish.",

They pay close attention to detail in the drinks, service and food and even the presentation you truly can feel it.  The food was so tasty mixed sweet, savory and spicy they brought that taste in every bite..  Great job blackout dining for making this such a incredible experience.  We can't wait to dine again!!  Chris our server was amazing and funny.  You won't go wrong with dining here if you love adventure and good adventures rich tasting food! Bit on the pricey side but this place isn't for everyday dining ...  also if you are a picky eater stay home.  drinks are not included ... however considering the price can someone consider at least tossing house wine with meal and a cold cappuccino option at end of meal.  Willing to trade the flower for wine.  Unfortunately flowers die but a bit of wine will help when you pay the bill.",

There was a little bit of ambient light from the exit sign and the night vision worn by the staff, but you certainly can't see in the traditional sense.  Options for food are somewhat limited; be prepared to get your fingers dirty!  Fun to try and guess what you are eating as the menu is a secret until you leave.

I'm still freaking hungry! For a 6 course meal, $60+ a person (not including drinks) and all vegan menu... I honestly expect more and feel slightly ripped off. If you are one for new experiences by all means try it but expect to hit up the closest McDonald drive thru after. I was so hungry after, I even told them when paying the bill... Living in Vegas, for the price I've paid I should not be this hungry and this broke (joking on the broke part).",

    "text": "Unique/Fun/Great Experience! We dined in the afternoon which was a four course vegetarian meal (dinner is six course). This indeed is an all vegetarian restaurant. I am not vegan and never had a total vegan meal but I did enjoy it. Perhaps some people (if you're not vegan) may not be satisfied or feel full as some complain, but I didn't come for the food. I came for the great people I was with, to laugh a lot and for the unique experience and I really loved it.  I won't go into details because the other reviewers already did  but what I was happy to know in advance was to know and prepare myself for pure darkness....no shadows....nothing! When you first walk into the dining room you are like WOW...can't see a darn thing and your other senses kick in big time! It was a lot of fun but also makes you appreciate things you take for granted. Our waiter Willie was AWESOME and will make any anxiety/nervousness you have subside. He guided us through the entire experience and if you lose your way and need help finding a utensil, glass etc. (LOL!) he's right there to help you out. Being with a group of six was perfect because we were able to talk and hear each other easily. We laughed and laughed, had fun trying to find and maneuver things and tried to guess what we were eating. The young lady at the  front desk was super nice and friendly and we met the owner who just great. I hope you go...have fun!",

I got to eat things I would have never ordered on my own and it was a great branching out experience.  It was fun guessing what everything was or could be. Overall i have no complaints. Check it out, I guarantee it's not like any other dining experience you've ever had.  I'm sad some reviews are giving too much of the experience away as well. The whole fun of it was not to know anything. If you go expecting to eat certain things you've missed the point completely.",

    "text": "I want to first point out this place is vegetarian. And to those who have complained about not being told up front or that there should be meat options let me explain that there is a good reason it is vegetarian. You are dining in PITCH BLACKNESS using your hands most if the time because using a knife would be impossible. Also with meat you run the risk of temperature issues. Imagine trying to bite in to meat or grabbing meat that is too hot, or with fish having issues with bones. So as someone in the business I say to those who are put off by the fact it is vegetarian I say to you suck it up and try it, a vegetable won't kill you and your going for the experience and that is the best part. Now moving on yes this place is PITCH black the only thing you can see is the floating light from the staffs night vision goggles.  My advice is too sit with closed eyes because trying to see any light puts a strain on your eyes.  Matt was our server and he was awesome. Very attentive and friendly. He really made our experience and if you go ask for him.  I will not spoil it and tell you the menu, trying to figure it out was the most fun. So my advice is go, have fun enjoy a new experience and some yummy vegetarian dishes.",

The staff was amazing and instantly made you feel comfortable sitting in a dark room. My husband was worried about the food but once he tried the first course he was happy and excited. Not being able to see your food and only rely on touch, smell and taste to figure out what it is was fun- now I know how babies feel trying foods for the first time. It was interesting discovering the different textures and trying to place all the flavors. It heightens your other senses. It's really a fun experience although kind of scary at first being led into a dark room to dine. But it's so freeing being invisible from the other diners and even yourself. The food was amazing I would definitely recommend this place.",

She was personable and helpful, which was necessary when you perform this task in absolute darkness. Second, the dining experience was a test of the smell, taste and touch senses. I felt myself concentrating more on what I was eating and how it tasted rather than electronics or the people around me. I believe this added concentration led to a greater appreciation of my meal. My companions were my family of 5, ranging from 16-the parents. There was a bit of nervousness in the beginning, but that fell away soon after beginning the meal. It was 7 courses of plant based food - salads, soups, savory, and sweet. I am a meat eater and left feeling very satisfied. The meal was expensive, but I looked at it as more than a meal; it was no less an activity as a show on the strip, albeit a little more interactive and potentially messy. So, for the price of dinner and a show, it wasn't a bad deal. Whether you're a tourist or a local, I would recommend dining in the dark at Blackout.",

The service was impeccable and the food is unlike anything I've ever eaten before. You won't be able to request your server, but if you happen to get Christopher to help you with your dining needs, you'll be in great hands. The server guides you through your dining experience and is essential to the proper journey. We were so lucky to have an attentive, jovial, and descriptive server in Christopher. Eating at Blackout is like a riddle wrapped in a mystery. It was worth the time and money for this once in a lifetime experience. 5 stars aren't enough, but it's all Yelp will allow. Bottom line: do yourself and your taste buds a favor and go to Blackout.",

My husband was somewhat nervous because he said since you cant see you cant tell if anything is dirty he has a point and hopefully it was clean ha ha but the experience was interesting. It does heighten ur senses and we tried to guess what the food was. We already knew it was vegetarian from the reviews which is a good thing because i am. My husband had the wine pairing which was not very good but the food was mostly good and the service was good too and the price isnt bad for 6 courses.",

You get to indulge in a six course meal being served to you in pitch black darkness using only your sense of touch, taste and smell. The restaurant will adhere to any dietary restrictions that you give them. The food provided did not require me to use my knife, so that was good. Your fork, spoon, and fingers get the job done!   I think my favorite part was that you have to lock up your cell phones and watches (basically anything that might emit light or sound) in a locker outside of the restrooms. You get to keep the key on you.   The servers use your first name each time they speak to you. They inform you of where things are by referring to \"time\". Example, your fork is at 9:00, your drink is at 2:00, etc. The Rachel Collins was my cocktail of choice and it was very good! They will provide you with a bib upon entering the dining room if you want one, I opted not to and was totally fine. They give you a free pair of sunglasses upon exiting the dining room and I highly recommend you take that! Even though it was evening, the minimal light in the entry way felt like I was staring directly into the sun!   Put this place on your list for dinner the next time you need to get out of your dining rut. You'll leave with a smile on your face, and a story to tell people.",

It was just as fun for us all to try to guess what we were eating. And we were right on only a couple things. Ha!    Our server Anthony was hilarious. He made us feel comfortable as we entered the darkness and explained perfectly where our drinks, plates, and silverware were located. He impersonated several actors and movie lines and was on point!    If you're visiting Vegas or are a local, you've got to try Black Out. When we visit again in the near future we'll definitely come back! The owners have done an amazing job.",

I'd needed a reason to go to Dining In The Dark for a minute, and the holiday seemed like the perfect opportunity.   You have to understand a few things:  Firstly, this is not an experience for someone who is \"precious\". If your going to be demanding and high maintenance, go somewhere you can pick your food, ogle the waiter, and try to look alluring over candlelight.   Secondly, the whole point of dining in the dark is so that you fully immerse yourself in the experience of dining, without distractions. Yes, it's a mystery menu. That's part of the point.  Thirdly, I learned something about myself I would have never notified before. I was eating my entree and it was incredible! I think this was the fifth course. I was so full by that point I stopped eating. Our waiter came by and asked if I was done, and I replied honestly that I wasn't sure... I couldn't see how much food was left on my plate. The moral of the story is, without the visual cue to keep eating just bc the food was there, I stopped eating when I was satiated.  The food was excellent and the experience was eye opening (pun quasi intended). Would definitely recommend for foodies and adventurers alike.",

The waitress was great and was very attentive which made the experience great even though the food was not so great.

But, again, Rebecca was fun to have as our server and made everything comfortable. We were able to order drinks from a menu before we walked in, and when we sat down, she went over where everything was on the table so we could feel our way around. Some items were finger foods, some you needed a fork, but you were always told the best way to eat the course before digging in.   I unfortunately did have to use the bathroom during the meal, but Rebecca safely brought me out and in.   The food was all DELICIOUS and it was fun trying to guess what was on the plate. They were able to accommodate my soy allergy, and can accommodate nuts and gluten allergies as well, I believe. Really diverse dining experience.   COME HUNGRY, there are 7 courses!",

We all joked how classy we all were being, digging in with our hands for majority of the courses. Many innuendos were made.   The game of \"what are we eating\" was half the fun. Without knowing what's in front of you, it's easy to eat something you usually don't like, but not immediately be repulsed because you don't know that's what it is.  Definitely recommend.

Which ended with them telling up they couldn't serve us due to them serving strawberries and they could possibly cross contaminate.  I understand we are eating in the dark and they could be liable if something was to happen, but after reading that they make accommodations for others allergies, I was highly upset and disappointed we were turned away. I also looked over the website to see if there was any notice or warning stating if you are allergic to strawberries you might be turned away, which I couldn't find.

Yes, you need to get over it and just let them surprise you. No, you don't get to pick your food. Yes, the food is unique and awesome. They are out to prove that dining can involve your other sensory faculties. Went there by myself. Didn't have anyone to talk to or dine with and it made it that much more interesting.  In fact, I found the conversations of the other diners to be a little distracting.  Would have been fun to have it be in complete silence as well.  That way you are focused on the food and the food only. Smell, taste, texture and that is it. Would be cool.   Have a family member that is 95% blind and this gave me a better understanding of what they are experiencing -- including why they use their hands the way they do. Would love to go back with them.    The food was awesome and the friendly servers help you along the way.    Awesome experience. Thanks again   Pic is of view inside the establishment.  That's about how much you can see.",

When 100% of your vision is taken away, you would be surprised at how hard it is to discern what certain (even common) flavors are. And don't get me started on how much you want to use your fingers to see what and where things are prior to digging in with your silverware. (Put that napkin on your lap!)  Richard and I enjoyed a lunch date here today, and it had to have been the most fun dining experience we have ever shared together. From Priscilla's kindness at the front, to Kory's friendliness and humor throughout our entire meal, we definitely enjoyed the entire afternoon.   The food was to die for, and we found ourselves frustrated not being able to identify so many items! It was a fun relief upon paying for our meal at the end, though, when we got to read descriptions of what we were served.  We were told the menu changes around every five months. We cannot WAIT to return!   Biggest tip: come hungry!!!!",

The food was great, with the 1st course and the main course being my favorites. We were so full when we left. The environment was comfortable, with many other people also dinning around us. You are able to see where servers are by their green and red lights, but they will still let you know when they are approaching your table. Our server Rebecca was great, very personable, and made this experience so easy. I highly recommend going with 2 people, plan for up to 2 hours, and expect about $80-$90 per person plus drinks. Don't hesitate, just do it!",

He talked with the kitchen and made me feel confident I was in good hands. The food was absolutely delicious. I was nervous that I wouldn't like something that was served because I can be picky sometimes but the opposite happened. Not being able to see what I was eating opened up my mind and allowed me to actually savor and enjoy the food I was eating. I also smiled the entire time. Taking away your sight and lights from things like your phone you are also able to connect and be present. The entire night was incredible and it will definitely be a go to spot of mine and my husbands. Would recommend 10/10.",

Also our server Rosco was amazing - really took care of us especially since I'm not 100% comfortable with being in the dark...ESPECIALLY FOR 2.5 HOURS?! It didn't even feel like anymore than 30-45 minutes. Definitely an experience everyone has to try! And I feel like since they take away all the phones and technology around you - you go back to the 90's and everyone is talking to one another. The wine pairing was awesome and everything was a surprise. Definitely got hands on and messy with it. But the food was delicious and they really paid attention to not have it too hot so we were able to use our hands to figure out locations of items - as well as Rosco's description was fun and entertaining!! We did a 7 course with the bubbly and treats   Was definitely full after the whole thing... and they keep an eye out so your food comes out as you finished your last plate!",

She bummed us out right when we arrived but Sarah picked up her slack. What made it worse was when we were leaving, Julia was rushing us and again was quite rude. I recommend going to BLACKOUT and seeing what it's all about! If you happen to have a run in with Julia I'm sorry for you and 100% request Sarah as your server.",

We were in Vegas and had the opportunity to have dinner.  Our waiter Roscoe and the entire staff was outstanding.  We had the 7 course dinner with wine pairings.  Absolutely a great way to go and the pairings were terrific.  Each course brought a different experience.  They were mostly great ones with one perhaps one that was just OK.  But that is a matter of taste.  Plenty of food and very tasty, good textures, awesome dessert.  The experience in the dark is truly unique.  Once you are in and settled, it is fairly easy to get comfortable.  Nice music, the sounds of laughter and chatting, and the wait staff very attentive.  Guessing what it was that we were eating and even trying to guess the wine pairing in the dark was challenging.  The menus afterwards were very eye opening.  Do not ask or tell ahead of time, it would diminish the fun of the experience.   Going as a group of 4 or 6 would be fun.    High recommendation to do something different and interesting.  The staff was fantastic!",

    "text": "Very interesting concept! Really haven't experience anything like this.   You literally lose your sense of sight & rely on your other senses to make this such a unique experience. Honestly, if you want to take someone out on a date to solely get to know their personality, this place would be it!  So you go inside and sign a waiver and pick out what you would like to drink for the night. You are then led into a dark room and seated at your table by a guide who wears night vision goggles & is able to see everything you can't. Jealous...  Slowly, you are served your 7 course meal one at a time. You are not told what you are eating so that it makes it an exciting experience of asking your partner what you think you're eating. Each server has their own way of vaguely describing your meal, so hopefully you have a good one!   It's such a trip to eat your food, try & guess what it is, feel the different textures/playing, talk to your partner, listen to the music, & simply hear everyone else's convo! In the end, you finally get to see a list of foods you tried. You should have a betting game with others at your table to see who got the most items correct!   While this experience was very different & unique from anything that I've ever experienced, the food was not my cup of tea and my sangria wasn't as tasty as I'd like. & I wasn't special enough to get a rose like others lol. But hey, this experience is worth a try. You get to cross something off your bucket list!",

    "text": "If you are adventurous then this is the spot for you! I came here on my birthday and it was such an amazing experience. The whole experience was so mysterious. Trust is so important here as you will not know what you will be eating.   You start off by placing all your belongings in a locker. This includes anything that lights up so be prepared to not have any access to your cell phone.   You are then giving some shades to wear and you walk into a pitch dark room being lead in by your waiter with your hands on his shoulder for him to guide you to your table. I couldn't see anything. I admit it's scary at first and anxiety of the unknown was getting the best of me but once i sat down it was the most amazing dining experience.  Something about sitting in the dark and not knowing the food that was being served was exhilarating. Your sense of smell, taste, and touch is enlighten. The best part of this experience is that it generates great conversation and avoids you from being distracted by people watching or messing with your cell phone to check on social media.   The food was good and the music set a great atmosphere. It's a 6 course meal. This is where I had to knock off a star. I felt the food could've been a bit more variety. It felt like dishes were vegetarian. Don't get me wrong it was good but I feel a menu that provides a dish with protein was the missing factor to complete the experience. I know it's kind of hard to serve a protein dish in the dark to be able to cut things up but bite size pieces could be an option. We are in Las Vegas and I've had many food joints here serve incredible dishes so perhaps that's why I'm a little harsh rating the menu. I was full by the end of the 6th dish so that is a plus. At the end is when they will reveal to you the menu. It was fun using my taste buds to guess the food we were eating then at the end seeing if we were right.   The service was top level as they were right there to refill drinks and the timing between each course was perfect. They knew when to arrive and provide clean utensils after each meal so that old flavors didn't transition to the next meal. They described each dish and gave you great instructions on how to eat the dish.   I highly highly recommend this type of dining experience. It's a great place to celebrate an anniversary, birthday, or as a date as you will get to the know the person more intimately.   They change their menu ever 3 months so make sure to give them a call to check if you decide to return. I look forward to coming back in the future! They got a fan right here!   Advice: use the restroom before going in. The transition from pitch dark to light feels like your eyes were dilated. Your gonna be squinting and trying to adjust back to light. You don't want to go in and out believe me. Best is to stay in there for the entire dining.",

The lobby was super nice, clean, modern, worthy of posting on social media. Lol. The staff was super nice and personable. We signed in using their laptops. We also were given lockers to place our phones / wallets, anything that would be a distraction or shine light. I thought was cool because I'm all for not being glued to our phones.   We were given instructions on what to do prior to entering the dark dining room. Our server was Victoria. She was amazing! Super nice. Patient. Informative. Etc.   The room is pitch black. So dark you can't see a thing. But the experience was awesome! I left there being thankful for my eyesight! Lol. The food was delicious too. Each course was yummy.

This was so much better than when you can't pay your light bill and have to eat in the dark. Seriously though this was really enjoyable I would have never eaten some of the thing I ate if I would have know what it was. They are a bit pricey but definitely worth the experience.",

Eating in pitch black really heightens your senses especially taste! Once you are guided into the dining room, you literally cannot even see your hand right in front of your face. Every course was exceptional -sorry, I can't give it away or it ruins the fun! The second course was my favorite, but honestly everything was very well seasoned and a great mix of textures and flavors. Although you can't see the plating, it's very well thought out and the plates and bowls are well suited for each part of the meal. Plus, it was plenty of food, we were stuffed when we left, and even the cocktails were delicious. They let you read a menu before you leave so you can see what you ate - I guessed all but one sauce, and I wanted to taste it again afterwards because I was so far off! Our guide/server Rebecca was super fun and helpful. I would highly recommend that everyone go at least once (they completely change the menu every few months!) Shoutout to owners and crew for a truly unique and enjoyable dining experience! This was the only picture I was able to sneak in, but I guess my flash didn't work!",

The 6 course meal spread out over approximately 3 hours felt like we were in a time loop when we were brought back to the light. Having no cellphones available was refreshing and we had a great time figuring out how to manage ourselves in the dark.  The food however fell short. Without giving anything away the caliber of food felt more like a bad deli's takeaway section instead of a restaurant at $70 per person price point. The dishes lacked depth of flavor and complexity, after the first two courses we lost excitement in our future courses. I personally enjoy vegetarian meals quite often and eat pretty healthy however these dishes felt very plain, simple and I can't even say it was well prepared. If the food was a higher caliber I would have been much happier with my experience. I hope they find a way to revamp their menu so the food is as good as the experience.",

Then at the end you get hit with a $350 bill (for 2)! Can name 100 meals that are significantly better for a tenth of the price. Went with a group of 10 and this was the general consensus. Can't remember ever being this letdown by a meal which is why I'm posting about it. Very rarely post.",

    "text": "As this was our fourth time going we already knew what to expect! It was my husband and my 1 year wedding anniversary and there was no other romantic place that we could choose from.   We are both Vegan so we knew that we would be getting amazing food.   That was not the case, the hostess asked if this was a special occasion and we did mention that it was our anniversary but there was no acknowledgement of our anniversary.   We were cool with that because we are a same sex couple and we understand how people may react. We were also shocked how the bottle service was going to be $35 which is more expensive than the bottle of wine they served. That should have been our first sign of actually leaving.   When the waitress came up from she made a comment with a small attitude about so you call me up here for a two topper but there are multiple two topper which one is mine.   The waitress provided wonderful service but it didn't make up for the sub par quality of food.   The first entree the waitress went ahead and said you may have already had this which we did, and I was already disappointed. We know that the menu changes every couple of months and the last time we went was back in August 2017. 2nd entree was very disappointing as if the restaurant didn't know what to do so they just scrapped a couple of things together and served. The third entree they used gardein products and I was extremely disappointed as prior time they were able to put together a meal and make it delicious and having us use are palette.   The fourth entree was ok as it wasn't anything to fancy. The fifth entree was definitely a huge disappointment as the veggies were under cooked and the starch was over cooked and the fake meat once again came up again. The dessert came and it was good. The first and last dish was probably the only thing I real enjoyed at the restaurant .  Upon paying my bill I was extremely shocked that the price went up another $20 per person which I do understand that if it's a high demand restaurant that you gotta do what you gotta do but at least make the meal worth $80 per person. I don't think I will be coming back again.",

Food was good and probably made more memorable by the fact that you had to really concentrate on tastes and textures to decipher what you were eating. Surprisingly, not messy. Does make you appreciate your sight. The waiter will tell you where everything is and how best to eat. Not something the sightless always have the luxury of. Although we did hear another table spill their drink.   The price would be prohibitive in thinking about coming back, but I definitely enjoyed the experience. I really should think of the value of the meal as including entertainment, not just the food. When I think of the cost as just the price of food, I think it's a little steep, even if I were to get something like that on the strip. What counted most was that my partner enjoyed their birthday meal. A little chocolate liquor shot too the place if a birthday cake. You know, no candles and all.",

    "text": "What an experience!!!! I saw this restaurant while watching late night TV and knew I had to see this for myself. It's encouraged to make reservations ahead of time to ensure you get a seat in the restaurant. Upon arriving, the staff goes over allergies and provides a small locker to put any belongings in that may cause a flash of light (watch, phones, beepers etc). I suggest you use the restrooms first before sitting down to avoid the dark to light, but if assistance is needed, the host will guide you out to the restroom.   Unfortunately there isn't too many pictures here because everything is in the dark. Your host will have you hold onto their shoulders and you shuffle your feet into the dark room. The host wears night vision goggles so they can see you and your food.  If you need assistance, just raise your hand and they sneak up on you. You can barely see them walking around with a little green dot. They explained each dish based as descriptive as they can without giving away the actual food you're about to devoi  Your eyes won't adjust as much as it wants to. The experience takes about an hour to hour and a half depending if you're pushing on time. We went to dinner for $80 a person for a 7 course meal.   Each course was delicious in its own way. It was more fun to use your hands and eat like a slob without your date seeing the messiness. I used my napkin as a bib and told him it was on my lap. We also tried feeding each other at one point during dinner service and that was hilarious! I first got his arm and accidentally spilled it on his hand. Sorry other patrons if we were the loud ones during your visit.  Although super fun, they don't change out their menu often. Their last update was December 2018 and I dined here June 30, 2019.  It's an experience I won't forget but it's not something I can do multiple times. But if you're in town and looking for something crazy and different to do, this is THE place to go!",

I'd love to tell you about the decor or how pretty the food was, but it's literally dining in pitch blackness. You can't see anything. Every once in a while, your eyes will catch a tiny bit of light - maybe a red light on the server's night vision goggles, but it is pitch black. No joke.   The price is high - $80 per person plus tip. But it was worth it. So incredibly worth it.   When you walk in, the lobby almost seems like a sterile environment... the smell, the decor, everything really. You put your belongings in a locker & wash your hands, then they take you to your table by forming almost a conga line. They seat you, tell you where everything is & how to find it. Then the food comes  They don't tell you in advance what the menu is, that way you can try to guess what things are. I guess that was fun but my taste buds are not that good. I had some of everything, which maybe was a mistake because by the time the main course came around... I was full! It's a 7 (8?) course meal, so you get a LOT of food.   Definitely make a reservation for this place. And go with some adventurous people. You'll have more fun that way.   I can't recommend this place enough. It was such a fun & unique experience!",

You are given a locker for your cell phone and then your wait person escorts you in to a surprisingly dark dining room.  Your other senses kick in and you began to smell more and become very aware of the sound in the room; the sound of others having dinner and the music.   The food comes in several courses.  The first course had me stumped, but as the meal went on, I was able to start getting some of the things figured out.  Fun to touch, smell, and taste to guess what you were being served.  I drank a lot of water to keep cleaning my palette so that I could guess my next course.    I came out of the meal surprisingly full.  I found myself ignoring my mixed drink because I wanted to be able to guess all of the food flavors.  I liked the creativity.  Shout out to Roscoe my server who took great pride in giving me a great experience.  For those that have claustrophobia, the darkness could be a bit unsettling.",

The menu is a mystery because you're supposed to use your senses to figure out what you're eating in the dark. I flew out to Vegas and got a Lyft over to the restaurant. Upon arrival, we were told that they saw our note in the reservation but were unable to serve anyone with a nut allergy due to one dish having pistachio. No accommodations could be made, and that was that.   I found the whole ordeal to be pretty unprofessional and really the biggest disappointment of the trip. We wasted time, energy, and money on a cab to be turned away when they could have called me ahead of time to let me know they would not be serving us. You'd think that for $75+ per person that they'd want to do anything possible to keep the business.   While I did not get the opportunity to dine here, there would have been no photos anyway as the dining room is pitch black.",

I highly recommend this as a fun date or friend dinner night. Something about the dark heightens the mood and all other senses, especially the tastebuds!   The food was incredible. Each dish was unique and full of flavor, I loved all of it both visits. I love bringing people here who are not comfortable with plant based food, they always leave surprised and satisfied.   Our server, Sara was amazing. She made the entire experience top notch. Her voice was extremely soothing, and she maintained great service throughout the entire experience. We thoroughly enjoyed her company. She also mentioned they will be doing a Halloween themed dinner so we will definitely be back.   There was only one person that stopped my experience from being a 5 star. Julia, the front desk/receptionist, the first point of contact through this experience. From the start she was rude and standoffish. I was not pleased with her introduction, especially when we were about to spend over $80 a head on dinner. After dinner, her attitude was even worse. She wanted to get us out of there as quick as possible. Julia was not personable and I was extremely dissatisfied with her service. I would expect a lot more from someone handing me a $300 bill. I would not have her customer facing in my business.",

    "text": "Okay! Here's the deal with this place. It's a super unique dining experience with really pleasant and delicious dishes, but in complete darkness. You can't see a thing. I have been here twice now and I can honestly say I both times were fantastic. If you haven't been and you are up for strangely satisfying, one of a kind experiences, you absolutely need to go!   Our server, Sara, (Sarah?) was very hospitable and helpful. Her service was excellent and went above and beyond your regular expectations. I would only hope to get her as my server again at my next possible visit.   The only flaw in this experience, and the only reason I deducted a star, was the person who is the first and last point of contact at the establishment. Julia was not blatantly mean or anything crazy, but she definitely wasn't personable either. I didn't feel very welcomed coming in, and also felt rushed going out. As a matter of fact, I felt as if she did not like us for whatever reason. Maybe she was having a bad day? Who knows. Anyways, step it up a little, Julia! Having been in the food service industry for 10 years, I know that is not how you act with / treat customers. You set the course and the mood for the ENTIRE visit of each and every customer. You also leave the very last impression and give them the last thing they will remember when they leave. Don't leave a bad taste in customers' mouths after they just stuffed them with delicious food!",

    "text": "What an incredible experience!! First off, Charlie was an awesome server - I highly recommend you get him! He makes you feel comfortable and you will laugh A LOT!   Upon arrival you'll sign a waiver saying you won't run around, use electronics and don't have any allergies. You'll lock up your phone and purse and be escorted to a room to help your eyes adjust and get instructions. You'll be escorted \"conga line\" style to your table where you'll await your seven course meal! While this meal is all plant based, you won't miss the meat! Your server will guide you verbally through what to expect on your plate and how to eat it - and yes, you will use your hands to eat! The plates were unique and matched the dishes perfectly. The desert courses were my favorite! You don't find out what you're eating until check out when you can see a menu. I left incredibly full and there was even a plate I only ate 1/2 of! Overall the food was good - there was only one course I found to lack flavor. The dishes range in complexity of eating, but the challenge is half the fun. You learn to trust your senses and they guide you through your meal!  This is for the truly adventurous! It was an incredible experience trying to guess the ingredient from smell, taste and texture! The roses at the end of the meal were the perfect touch.",

Some things to know: you eat in pitch dark - that means u will be using your hands to \"feel\" the food a bit so expect to potentially get a little messier than usual while eating (they have large plastic bins you can wear which my sister and I wore to make sure our clothes didn't get messy.   It is a Vegan restaurant (the carnivore in me was a little hesitant on this part), but everything did taste good and was filling by the time we were done!  Our waitress, Rebecca, was awesome! She led us to our table, explained where everything was and what to expect with each dish (and provided some nice convo).    The food tastes very good and they were adaptable to allergies and food preferences.  Their signature cocktails and shots were also tasty!!!  Dining in the dark was definitely a unique experience.  It was fun to see how much we relied on our sense of sight, as well as how to adapt using our other senses when sight wasn't there (the most difficult/fun moments were when My sis and I tried to taste each other's drink/etc and we had to \"find\" each other's cup/etc).   We opted for the 7 course option and it truly didn't disappoint!  If u are in Vegas please Che k out this awesome family-owned unique dining experience!!!",

    "text": "Unique experience, overpriced, poor service with front desk and management:  I made a reservation for 12 guests for July 11th. On the call, I referenced a current Groupon they were offering and asked if we should each purchase the groupon or if they would be able to price match as this saves them money (groupon takes a fee for sales). The hostess on the phone said they would honor the Groupon pricing and she would put notes on the profile.   On the day of our reservation we signed the waivers, got checked in and was lead into the darkness! It is a very unique and fun experience and the food is definitely notable, especially considering it's all plant based. This was until my boyfriend pulled something long and stringy out of his mouth. He didn't say anything at the table but squeezed my hand and had me feel it as well. It felt like a hair but he insisted on holding onto it until we got into the light.   After the experience, we all went to check out. I went up to the hostess to ensure the Groupon price would be honored and she said she didn't see any notes. She wanted to know who I spoke to, however I couldn't recall. I asked if she could see who made the reservation. She was pretty rude and so I suggested everyone could get on their phones and purchase the Groupon now. Not showing any sympathy or understanding she responded you have to do that 24 hours prior. This went back and forth for a little bit before she called out a manager (who was also our server?) The stupid thing, is that the Groupon only saved each person $7.00. Why they didn't just honor it and insisted on turning a good evening into a trying experience is beyond me.  The manager came out and said they could honor the pricing. The total discount for the entire group of 12 for $84.00. The hostess discounted the first 2 people that checked out $84 each. It wasn't until the 3rd group she checked out that she noticed the mistake. The manager then had to come back out and said she would be fixing the credit cards in the morning.   So the whole check out process takes a good amount of time and you have to claim your alcoholic beverages when you check out. Why the waiter can't assign the drinks to the checks, not sure?? We get to the end and the hostess is (with attitude) saying there is an unclaimed tequila shot. No one is claiming it, so my boyfriend pays another $15.00.   By the time we get home, my boyfriend is extremely irritated with the situation as we recap the evening and he decided to write an email explaining our experience. He ended the email asking for a phone call. He also asked that no changes to the credit card should be made without our approval.   In response, he received a generic email apologizing, saying they would look into the situation. The email wasn't even signed with the sender. My boyfriend responded, again, asking for a call. To this day, nothing. We gave them 3 chances to try to resolve.   The following day I got an email from Capitol One asking if I had left a 46% tip. What??? Upon opening the email, I was able to see that they took the difference that I owed them (hostess mistake) $73.00 and added it to THE TIP LINE.   And by the way, it was a hair. A long curly hair stuffed into the beef Wellington.    Unfortunate that this review would have never had to be posted if we received a call from the establishment.",

Within 2 hours, my wife and I both began to exhibit minor signs of food poisoning and had to end our night very short. I definitely advise eating somewhere else.

They try to be vague (about Vegan) on their site and when we asked about it at front desk.  They show you the menu after you eat.  It actually describes things with \".... stuffed with 'meat'....\".   Typical vegan mentality of trying convince everyone that their way is better or just as good.  We are from Texas and we love our meat!  All 4 of us thought the food was disgusting.  $300+ would have been much better spent in the same setting with the darkness being used to show people how dinner use to a time for family bonding, not looking at your phone (eating food you prefer and not some Vegan agenda).  We arrived with 2 hours before our show.  We ended up having to rush the last 3 courses and barely made it to our show.",

But, on the other hand, that was the point! To try something new!  Our server, Anthony, made us feel at ease, and was very gracious and enjoyable! The food was all fabulous (I won't tell you what it was, in case yours is something similar).  Six courses of delicious food that we all enjoyed!!  And something we found interesting --- if you know what is in your food ahead of time, you often pass on it because you \"don't like a particular ingredient.\" Or, if you can see the food ahead of time, you pass judgment on it because the \"serving is too small\" or \"that's way too much. I won't be able to finish it!\"  We were afforded none of those prejudices. Consequently we ate what was served to us, and tried it without knowing the ingredients, and without being able to see the serving sizes. We enjoyed the entire meal, and later saw the menu and realized there were ingredients we would not ordinarily have chosen, but we actually liked when we just tried them!!  We eat at a lot of restaurants, but this is one of the most amazing experiences we've ever had!! My husband, my mother-in-law, and I all highly recommend this place!!",

The food is delightful but even better is the experience, and that is made all the better by the fun-loving staff. They create an environment of fun and make you feel incredibly comfortable in what is,admittedly, an unusual experience. Our waiter, Ken, made us laugh and gave us \"tips\" and hilariously guided us through the entire experience. He was our eyes and he was an excellent guide!  Try this, you won't regret it!  Worth every penny and a full hour and half of entertainment for our group of 5!  This was dinner and a show of our own making - we will definitely be back and be bringing others.",

    "text": "The food was surprisingly good. They basically gave us a choice of sweet, savory or spicy. It is a 6 course meal, none of which is disclosed to you until the very end. It is so dark in the restaurant that you can't see your hand in front of you, however, all the waiters and waitresses can see you very well. The experience was very interesting because you must rely on your sense of smell and taste to figure out what you are eating. You also don't know if the restaurant is clean or a dump and whether the dishes are clean or not. You are required to leave cell phones, lighters and anything with light outside in the lockers. They reveal the menu to you at the end but it left me wondering if that was really what we ate. Although food was pretty good. The experience is worth a one time try, but the price of eating there is better spent at a high end restaurant like Ruth's Chris where you can see your food and your surroundings. 2 people, we paid more than a couple hundred. Drinks are charged separately from the $65 per person meal. We had 3 beers and 2 glasses of wine.",

It forces you to put away your phones and any other distractions and just focus on whoever you brought with you. And the darkness adds an element of intimacy hard to get at restaurants. The food was delicious and mysterious. Its surprisingly difficult to guess what each food is without being able to look at it. At the very end they show you the actual menu and wow so surprised to find I got almost nothing right. They also cater very well to allergies as I am allergic to gluten and they had no problems at all with making sure everything was safe and yummy. Its also a surprisingly large amount of food that starts small and gets larger. And oh that dessert! Epic win. Our server was Victoria and she was very nice and charming. Its a really welcoming vibe the entire way through. Definitely recommend for any romantic dates!",

    "text": "I've seen dining in the dark restaurants before on tv shows and I always thought it would be so cool to experience. Well, it was definitely a very cool thing, and I'm happy I got the chance to experience it but I don't think I will be back unless there are some changes. When you first get there you check in and sign a waiver. You meet with your server (our server was amazing! I forgot his name but he had a cool mustache!) you get taken behind a curtain and explained what's about to happen. You hold each others shoulders and begin your journey into complete darkness. I wouldn't recommend wearing heels to this place. Your server seats you at your table and explains everything and where all your utensils are. Dinner is a 6 course meal and lunch is 4 courses. My friend and I did the 6 course savory meal. Each course is very small, bite size portions to be exact until you get to the last 2 items. You have no idea what you're eating and they don't tell you until after, but they do ask if you have any guesses. I do have to say, for $60 a person for a 6 course meal, I don't think was worth it at all. The food is insanely small and what you're eating is not expensive food. Another thing I didn't like was the whole menu was vegan, which they do not mention. To my understanding I thought we were gonna be tasting a little bit more expensive unique food, like steaks and seafood. Nope, you're not gonna find any of that here. I don't understand why they ask if anyone is vegan or vegetarian when it doesn't even matter because the whole menu is vegan. They should definitely make that clear because people go in with the impression they're going to be eating a filling 6 course meal. With meat. All in all it's a cool concept. If they were to add non vegan options, make the portions bigger or the price less I think it's gonna work out. But it's vegas, and you can get a hell of a lot more food anywhere around for the amount you're spending. You are paying for the experience though, which was fun.",

The fact that they don't tell you what you are eating adds to the mystery, but you will most likely leave hungry and everything is vegan. The price is something I would expect from a master chef's restaurant on the strip and It just wasn't to that level of perfection. With some tweaks and maybe more options this could be a great thing for vegas, but when there is such a limited menu, any allergies or food problems cause you to either lose one of your small six courses or it is no longer as complex or flavorful.",

They lead you into the back, you have to hang on to each other. The room is pitch black, you can't see anything, not even your hand in front of your face. The server does a great job describing every step and describing the table. It was crazy how acclimated you get, your other senses take over. It is a 6 course surprise meal, we had so much fun trying to figure out what everything was we were eating, and then seeing how wrong we were at the end. Our server, Martha was amazing.

    "text": "Short review: A unique experience that is WAY overpriced for the food you get.   Long review:  There is no denying that this is a unique concept that is executed well.  This  restaurant is exactly what it says it is.  You get to have a meal in complete darkness.  The staff is very courteous and does an excellent job of welcoming guests, explaining the experience, and guiding you through dinner without hurting yourself or spilling your drinks.  The mood music perfectly complements the pitch black atmosphere as well and to a certain degree it is worth having the experience of trying to eat in complete darkness and figure out what you're tasting.   However, I can't help but feel the darkness helps to perpetuate a fraud.  It was not until after we started reading these reviews that we found out the place is vegan.  That information is never told to you.  I also did not ask about the price and just assumed it would maybe be somewhere in the $50-$80 range per person.  So when we were presented a bill for over $220 (between my wife and I), I was blown away.  I do not mind paying for a meal like that if I'm getting some quality food (like Kobe beef or something).  But again, this was all vegetables.  There is no way that anyone should need to pay that much for a meal consisting of all vegetables. Our main course was, no kidding, a risotto sandwich. At no point were we blown away by any of the dishes in our six-course meal.  Given that this dining experience is supposed to enhance your other senses (especially taste), you would hope that we would have dishes that were a little more inspiring.  We did not. We went with two other friends and all of us wished to go to In and Out burger afterwards.    I cannot help but feel that this place would be far more successful and earn a lot more repeat business if it were honest with its menu and pricing and at least offered a non-vegan option.  Great potential. Mediocre food at best.  Only worth the price if you value the experience over the substance.",

    "text": "While I was looking forward to a new dining experience, I hadn't anticipated this one being quite as unique and enjoyable as it was. I'd read a couple of reviews about it after my girlfriend suggest it for my birthday and understood that because you are truly dining in complete darkness, a lot of thought had been put into the menu and the ingredients that make up the 6 courses you'll be served by your night vision goggle clad server. Your 6 courses and their ingredients are purposefully made up of a variety of foods of different textures, flavors, density's and sizes. Before being escorted Conga Line style into the dining room, you'll get to choose one of the 3 flavor genre's that will make up 2 of your 6 courses; savory, spicy or sweet. The other 4 courses are the same for everybody. Your server will then carefully escort your party into the blackness of the dining room and seat you individually., explaining the layout of the table for you because you literally can't see anything. They'll take drink orders (be aware, these are pricey) and bring out your first course. What I found fun about the experience was that I enjoyed every course, and that most of them were relatively complex recipes (no burger or sandwiches) that we'd try to decipher and identify their different ingredients by taste and texture alone. We'd take a bite or two and then discuss what we thought we were eating. For a picky eater or the less adventurous diner, this might not be as fun as it was for us. I enjoyed all of the courses, especially the dessert. Even our conversation felt different because as we talked, all non-verbal cues and feedback were eliminated and you really have to focus on the other persons words. And you may say things you might not otherwise say, if you'd been influenced by those non-verbal cues, such as their facial expressions, while you spoke. Your server continually reminds you, out of courtesy, that they can see everything , while you cannot. They do this because diners often forget that because they've been blind for 60-90 minutes. So don't pick your nose or your butt crack, or do anything else you wouldn't do in the normal light. They'll also tell you which tool to eat with for each course. Such as, \"You'll want to use your fork for this course\". And they'll tell you where that utensil is with a clock face reference; ie. \"At one o'clock is your glass\" or \"Your fork is at your three o'clock\". Overall, it was a great experience and I'd recommend it to any adventurous person who enjoys a new experience.",

The food was just OK, not spectacular, but it was fun trying to guess wrongly what each course was (except for one small piece of course 2 which was obvious by its shape; it was impossible to hide).  The night vision googles that the servers (need to) wear were a small immersion break - I could sometimes see some faint glows, especially when Chelsea leaned in for the next dish.

You get seven dishes to try I only finished one because it was the only thing that was worth finishing. Afterward I had to stop somewhere to eat a good meal.",

Our server CORY is AMAZING- he has a great sense of humor that made the entire experience very special.   First they ask you about any few allergy. We get 6 course dinner without knowing what it is exactly. And holy crap that entire place is BLACK and DARK. However, getting rid of that visual input and replying heavily on other senses make the food even better--- we get to smell the food, touch the plate or even the food, and really enjoy the flavors. The one thing I LOVE about is you get to put your phone down and really enjoy the meal. To me I think being on the phone during a meal or a date just makes it meaningless. It is meant to communicate and become closer to the people sitting next to you, and blackout achieved that! Highly recommending this restaurant and if possible, highly recommend CORY to make your experience even better.",

Without being able to see the food, you rely on other senses. The textures were horrible.  The first course was fried balls of mush. The \"Cheeses\" were grainy even for vegan cheese. The zucchini spaghetti was slimey. Nothing tasted fresh or of quality. We had the 7 course meal and still somehow left hungry, only having a bite of each course blindly hoping to find something edible on each plate. The tables are are situated very close together and we could overhear the family next to us complaining to each other and spitting out food in disgust as well. At $80 a plate I really expected higher quality of food.  Oh and Another thing that was interesting was how the bill was itemized. Prices aren't listed nor explained prior to dining. Each plate was technically only  $39 but there is a $40 fee for each person just to sit down making it about $80 a person before drinks are considered. I wouldn't recommend dining here. The concept was neat but when I dining out the food should be enjoyable.",

My partner and I came for dinner for my birthday and I was very impressed by the level of service and attention given- starting from entering the building and being greeted by the friendly and engaging hostess - the restaurant itself feels like fine dining but in a casual atmosphere.  Our server Willy was polite and respectful yet personable and humorous. He offered us comforting advice and gave us a simple run down of how the dinner service would go and it was greatly appreciated.   The walk into the pitch black dining room did make me a bit nervous, but Willy was great about talking to us during the walk to the table to ensure we were safe and able to follow him. Service was fast but not too fast- each course was timed to perfection with just enough time in between courses to chat and discuss the mysterious foods we were eating. It was amazing how the darkness amplified my other senses... smells smelled more robust, tastes were more pronounced, and I could hear EVERYTHING.   I don't want to say much more to spoil it for anyone else - Just go! Blackout Dining is an amazing experience worth checking out!  We will definitely be back again next season for the new menu (;",

Everyone is very friendly and the waiter made us feel very comfortable. It does take some adjusting once you are in the dining area because it's an initial odd feeling being in the complete dark and thinking you are going to eat in the dark but after a few minutes, I settled in. The waiter did a wonderful job of explaining everything and they clearly explain what to feel for once the plates of food start coming out and make it easy to navigate through the process. The food was really good and good portions so even though it's pricey it feels worth it. You will definitely be full and satisfied upon leaving. It's a really interesting experience that everyone should try!",

They explained what we should expect from the dining experience and what to do with our electronics and had us sign waivers.   We were then greeted by our server who would walk us in and get us seated. My wife was a little nervous about being in the dark so the server seated us near an exit sign for some illumination.   The service was great and I have no complaints about it. The food was quite good. My one complaint was that the first course, which was supposed to be warm, was lukewarm at best. (I won't spoil the surprise of any of the dishes)   My other complaint was that although it was a unique experience I feel it was a bit overpriced. I wish we could go do this more often but at nearly $170 for 2 (no alcohol), it's not very affordable. If they used pricey meats or protein sources, maybe I'd be a little more understanding but this wasn't the case. These prices are in line with the top restaurants in the city and you don't really go here for that type of formal experience that should come at that cost.   So definitely give it a shot if you've never experienced anything like this before. It's really cool. But expect to dig deep in your pockets.",

    "text": "Extremely overpriced for what you receive. Six courses for my girlfriend and I ended up being nearly $300. Must have been some steak or lobster right? No... Course 1: was 3 fried palm shoot calamari thing and 2 tiny crabcake things. Course 2: (here's where it gets good) 3 crackers with a cube of cheese on each and a tomato slice again I'd like to mention the bill was nearly $300 Course 3: was some take on a vegan pizza I think? All I know for sure was it was hard to eat with it being pitch black in the restaurant and what I did manage to eat wasn't good. Course 4: was a salad which honestly wasn't that bad just really difficult to eat without being able to see Course 5: was pasta another thing difficult to eat without your vision! Expecting something strange at this point I dig in and find a protein finally! But I can't tell what it is until I see the menu at the end (it was chicken) but it didn't taste like it at all also it may be a thing people do but personally pistachios do not belong in chicken Alfredo. Course 6: was a double shot of some ice cream served in a shot glass where your server tells you to dig all the way to the bottom to get all the flavors ( in a pitch black environment where I'm paying you ~$300 its a little unreasonable to make me work in the dark to make my food ready to eat)  Bonus course: given a glass jar to fumble around with for what I can only assume is the servers amusement and it contains a tiny chocolate truffle yay worth it haha.  The idea of eating in total darkness is a very good one, and I totally get having vegan and vegetarian options (everyone should get what they like) but you definitely need to add some protein and maybe make a course and actual course not 3 crackers and 3 cubes of cheese. Very very overpriced and I'm glad to have the memories of it with my girlfriend but I will never return and would recommend anyone else just do takeout and eat it at home with the lights off instead.",

However, if you understand what you are getting I think most people would find the experience worth it (at least once) and really cool/enjoyable.   I have been to a similar restaurant before in Germany but for my BF this was his first experience. The concept is simple, dine in pitch blackness, and experience your food with your other senses. Additionally, because you are completely unplugged you can have a nice actual conversation with your dining mate!   Service was amazing, Anthony our server was super friendly and helpful. I loved the hostess as well. You can tell they really like where they work and believe in their concept.   There are 6 courses, all are vegetarian so you don't have to worry that you dont know what you are eating. However, it was NOT vegan, just FYI (they call themselves plant based) if you don't eat dairy I found there to be a lot of creamy sauces although no cheese. (as far as I could tell haha) It was honestly too much food, I couldn't finish the main course which was huge. So even if youre worried about the no meat thing, don't fear even my BF was stuffed. All the dishes tasted good and it was fun trying to guess the flavors and elements of each. I loved eating with my hands but again if you are someone in which that would make you uncomfortable this may not be the place for you. At the end they let you take a look at the menu so you can see how right (or wrong) you were. If you are looking for a unique experience I would check it out. Honestly it was the same price as all the \"celebrity\" chef restaurants at the casinos and I found this to be more fun than just another over priced strip restaurant.",

For that price you could go to a lot of restaurants in the strip and get an excellent two course meal and just eat it with your eyes closed to get the same effect as this place!

    "text": "#1 it should be advertised as a vegetarian dinner. For the price we paid, I really would have liked a nice cut of meat.  #2. Way over priced. Dinner for 2 with (2) blue moon beers and (1) $10 glass of wine... $165+tip. We tipped over 25% because our server was great and the experience of eating in the Dark was a pretty interesting experience.  #3. The food was Meh... I would have been okay with everything else if the food was outstanding. It really wasn't... I probably ate 3 bites of my dinner entree just to taste what the different Ingredients were... It was far from savory and could have used even a pasta or something. A couple of dry (what tasted like hush puppies)?? I would have been impressed a little if when I told the server that I didn't enjoy it if he would have offered to try one of the others, but I didn't make a big deal because like I said before he was really nice. The dessert was literally the only saving grace.  All in all I gave a 2 star... (server and experience in the dark)... I just have to be honest incase others go in expecting a non-vegetarian meal... Be ready for a $200 vegetarian dinner!!!! *** also if they don't like your review on their Facebook page they will block you from commenting on other people talking crap about you, they can not handle the truth and allow others to put you down ***",

I felt a little claustrophobic at first but sure enough the food took my mind off of it. The food was great. Every course was like a mystery and the server would not share what we were eating until the end when we got to see the menu. He would tell us where the food was \"6 o'clock, 12 oclock\", etc. it was cool but very expensive!! I might go back, maybe to bring clients. :)",

The room is as dark as of a room you will ever be in, so you dont see a peep of what the room looks like (you will understand why I am saying this later).  The 7 course meal that we were all craving so much made taco bell look like a gourmet restaurant.  For a meal costing $80+ a person without any alcohol and that quality of food is absolutely absurd.   Not to mention the time it took in between meals.  As another review I read said \"$80 for a meal per person with minimal electric bill, no design on the restaraunt cause its pitch dark\", and to add food that made us nauseous.   I would highly recommend anyone thinking about coming here to think twice or just stay home, go in the   darkest room of your house, heat up a t.v. dinner and enjoy your night.",

I understand for safety concerns they can't have any real protein but the meat patty that was served as the main entree was not edible. The entire dinner was quoted to be 45 to 75 minutes, while you are actually there for 90 to 105 minutes. This made us incredibly late for a show we were attending that evening and had budgeted our time based on incorrect information from the receptionist. Additionally 90 minutes in a pitch black room was not an ideal experience for out group.",

But our server Ken eased all of my fears and made it so much more fun than we ever thought it could be. The food was delicious. Being vegan and Las Vegas locals it's hard to find places that have really good food and even though we knew it was vegan we kept saying \"but is this really vegan\". Ken was so great at explaining everything, answering all of our silly questions, and letting loose with us too. Already looking forward to our next experience.",

    "text": "This place is a unique dining experience with a great wait staff. I think it's something different and fun to try... I had a pleasant experience and was perfectly comfortable in the dark with our waiter!   What I wasn't a fan of was the price of an all-vegetarian meal. This was a surprise date for me- so I didn't check Yelp or know what I was getting into... apparently it's on the customer to ask about food and even though I had some questions it was never disclosed that the menu is all vegetarian- it's definitely an avoided subject. I'm not opposed to vegetables... but five courses of them is a bit much- and if we are paying around $70 a person I'd rather go with fewer courses with either a meat or vegetarian option. Most of the dishes tasted fine. Some courses I enjoyed better than others. The dessert was a bit generic, but it tasted good.   I don't know if there's a philosophy behind not outwardly claiming it's a strict vegetarian menu or what, but I found that odd. Overall I'd try again if they ever decide to adjust their menu.",

Where should I begin.  So my boyfriend and I were in Vegas for a couple Days and wanted to do as many activities as possible so I Googled something  for us to do and this was one of the things that caught my eye. Why do u ask? We're both foodies and the thought of eating in the dark peaked my curiosity plus I thought it would be a fun experience. So I ended up purchasing for 2 on Groupon ( not much of difference between purchasing on Groupon and at the place saved about 10-20 bucks) Fast forward we get their and we were greeted by the cashier very friendly forgot her name but she explained we needed to fill out a waiver ( Nothing crazy dont worry you won't die of food poison) and were told to put our phones in a locker. The waitress came out wearing night vision goggles and escorted us to the dining area where it was pitch black. You get seven courses and the food actually tasted pretty delicious. One in particular had a great sauce my boyfriend was sneaking food off my plate and of course I didn't know cause it was dark. He told me afterwards ;(. At the end of the meal its revealed what you've eaten. Plus a bonus gift for the ladies. For me this is definitely a one time experience but still something to experience. Just try when you go to Vegas. Also if you feel a little daring you can touch on each other in the dark. Always a bonus!!!!",

Trust me, it isn't as easy as you would think hitting your lips with the wine glass or getting anything on to your fork without looking, or \"playing\" with your food.  We had the most fun trying to identify each course that came. Have no clue what the ambience is since it's completely black in there, but the server was fun and the food really superb. Though I missed seeing the presentation, I did feel my way and pretty sure it looks as good as it tasted. I am a long time vegan, and even though my friend is not, he enjoyed everything as well.

Yes it's vegan, however.. that doesn't change the quality or wholesome goodness that was delivered (no we aren't vegan.) We did the 5 course lunch and left extremely full! I'm not sure what people are talking about when they say it isn't enough food. The food isn't typical and will take you through a spectrum of flavors and textures.. so if you aren't adventurous and cultured and you eat mounds of food at buffets, this probably isn't the place for you. Yes it's more expensive than what you'd pay for an average meal but you are paying for an experience that you cannot het anywhere else on the west coast.

Our server, Christopher, was phenomenal and explained everything thoroughly, made sure we were comfortable and that we never were sitting for too long without some food in front of us. The 7 course meal was nothing short of filling, and although you don't know what you're eating, everything you eat is delicious. I would definitely go back again. They change their menu every few months.   Worth every penny.",

    "text": "This is such an amazing concept. It was pretty spooky to be honest. I was a little scared TBH because you can hear people but could not see people. I enjoyed being able to spend the night with my partner because that is what it is all about - the experience. I have read some of these reviews and was shocked at them. If you have practiced mindful eating, you would know that this is for the experience. It was a lot of fun because we ate slower than we normally do because we wanted to try and figure out what we were eating. I would not go in a large group because I feel like I would have to yell across the table but with a partner or a friend, it is a great idea. I saw this idea on a TV show many many years ago and was very excited to have it come to Las Vegas. I think the tourists would love this concept.   I do believe that you could get more food for your money, but people need to realize that you are paying for the experience. I pay more at a crowded Indian restaurant without the experience.   Location A+ ( not far from locals and close to the strip) Food A ( could be bigger portions)  Customer Service A+ ( kudos to these people serving with night vision)  Cleanliness A ( from what I can see - because I cannot see inside the restaurant)",

Even if the restaurant did not have the great novelty of eating in total pitch black darkness and debating with your friends/family over whether or not you think there's curry powder in the soup, I would absolutely eat here.  It was one of the best meals I've had in Vegas or ever.    In addition to the creative, delicious, and well portioned food, the experience itself is really fun.  I have to say when I first entered the totally black room it was pretty disconcerting and I was not sure I would enjoy myself or even be able to see it through.  But the server, Rosco, was awesome and once I was seated, sipping my excellent Old Fashioned, and chatting with my mom and best friend, I was totally comfortable and adjusted.  The whole meal is based on your tactile, olfactory, and gustatory senses which is a great experience.  You feel around at first for your plate, water, etc but pretty soon you know where everything is.  It's super fun to start guessing what you're eating just by the touch/texture.  I really appreciated there were no phones or any distractions.  Rosco is great!!",

She was extremely friendly and helpful with getting set up before dinner.   This is the ultimate dining experience. You have never experienced something like this and you never will unless you come. Challenge your taste buds and coordination as you navigate in the dark to consume delicious and mysterious foods. You will be able to choose from sweet, savory, and spicy. 6 course meal that will keep you engaged throughout the entire time.   Bottom line, just go. You will not be disappointed!

And if you want the experience with your friends and you decide to not eat, they will still charge you $40 just to sit in the dark. Our waiter, Mike was great. The experience of paying $80 a head for food that was not great and gave 3 of our 6 people food poisoning. Also reservations don't mean anything we had a reservation for 8:30 pm and didn't get called for our table in until 9:30. Only on the account that smart people decided not to eat here were we called back. I willl not ever recommend this place, to anyone. I don't think this place will ever have return customers. Please ensure this review gets seen this place is a rip off!!",

Took my daughter here for a girls night out. Shay our waitress had a positive and fun attitude. Hostess at front door was a nightmare. I can't remember her name but she literally talks from a script and not friendly or personable whatsoever. Her attitude almost made me not want to dine there but reservation was already made and we were excited for the experience. I will not return but I highly recommend to live outside your comfort zone and give this place a try. We are vegan and the plant based menu was exciting to us. Unfortunately the food was less then blah but eating with our fingers definitely was fun. Great music selection they had. Helped our anxiety, as sitting in the dark while trying to eat is a challenge. So thanks for the great play list.  Checked this off our buck list. We are locals and although we will never return, glad we gave this place a try.  Of course no photos to share.  Bon appetit",

    "text": "Wow what an experience!  Blackout offers its' patrons a unique and fun experience, totally out of the norm.  As the name states, you dine in the dark...literally.  All you see is pitch black all around.  No clue what is around you.  The restaurant could be in a run down warehouse and you wouldn't know.  Definitely a memorable experience for the husband and I.    Although you cannot see the area that you are actually dining in, the area you can see, the check in area, is bright and pretty nice.  They have a nice chandelier hanging in the middle of the room with the check in/out registers on the side.  They also have a nice couch sitting area while you wait for your waiter to come and get you.  My only gripe is that the locker area where you have to put all your belongings in, was a bit snug.  Since it is located in a narrow hallway right in front of the bathrooms, it can be a bit difficult trying to get your stuff in and out while people are walking in and out of the bathrooms.  Especially if your locker is right in front of the bathroom door and yes, we were one of the lucky ones in front of the men's bathroom.  So you can just imagine how many times I had the \"I promise I'm not looking into the men's bathroom while the door is open\" awkward moments and thinking \"no eye contact please\" LOL  Now for the food, they do serve you a 6 course meal all in the dark and they don't let you know beforehand what they are serving you.  You pretty much utilize your senses throughout the entire.  It was fun trying to figure out what we were eating.  Our waiter, Willy, was amazing!  Since we were pretty blind the entire time, he gave us specific instructions on where we could find our water, drink, etc. and what to do with each course.  Not only that, but he was on top of getting us our next course as soon as we were done with the current one.  No waiting, everything was served back to back.  Now be aware that the entire meal is vegan, but don't let that deter you!  Even the meat eating husband enjoyed his meal.    All in all, I would definitely recommend you try this place out even if just once.  The experience in itself was unique and worth it.",

I'm not sure if our boyfriends knew it when they chose the restaurant, but it fit perfectly with my friend's dietary restrictions because she's a vegetarian.  I, on the other hand, am not.  That being said, I think she was very happy with the meal where I was left a bit underwhelmed.  If I was only rating the food I would only give it 3 stars, but I'm bumping it to 4 because of the whole dining in the dark experience.  I think it's a great place to go to at least once, just for the experience, but I won't be coming back anytime soon unless they add some meat to the menu.  I understand they may not want large pieces of meat due to possible choking hazards, but I think ground meat could be added to some of the dishes.  You answer several questions about your allergies and taste preferences before the meal, so I think they could make it work if they were interested in expanding their menu.",

From being lead to our table through a room so pitch black that I couldn't see a hand in front of my face to figuring out what we were eating was undeniably fun.  No phones, no nothing.  A group at another table likened it to being in the SHU (Orange Is the New Black, anyone?).  But the idea was to heighten one's other senses while sitting through the 6 course plant based meal.  If you're complaining about no meat on the menu, try dealing with a bunch of people holding sharp steak knives in darkness.  All the servers wore night vision goggles (does anyone else automatically think of Silence of the Lambs too?), which helped tremendously when trying to find a utensil or wine glass.  I admittedly gave up during some courses and went hand to mouth just because it was easier.  Not like any of the patrons could see me eat so rudely :P     I won't get into the food, since revealing that would ruin a lot, but I was surprised how far off I was in guessing what was eaten.  It wasn't until the end that we were shown the full menu, which did garner some laughs.  All of the items were generally decent.      The only real downer was the price tag, which was around $80 per person without drinks.  I mean...these people are making a killing!  They save money on electricity, didn't need an interior designer, could probably get away with mismatched silverware and don't use any fancy ingredients.    I was lucky enough to get a BOGO, but despite the fun, would rather wear a blindfold (or just take my glasses off?) to an Indian restaurant.  Even with all that, I still look at the evening fondly.  So if you're looking for a unique date night (literally, blind date) or a funny group outing or just want to spoil that special vegetarian in your life, this is still worth considering.",

I had so much fun, everyone was very nice, great customer service and our server/host Rosco was great! Very nice, funny and he gave us a top notch customer service! The food was delicious and it was fun guessing what we were eating haha. I did not expect it to be that dark, you won't be able to see anything at all, like AT ALL!! My friends and I were talking about how the restaurant actually really looks inside lol. Great atmosphere all around, it's like a regular restaurant, it was loud, everyone was talking and having a great time, the difference about this restaurant compare to a regular restaurant is that it's pitch dark, you get to focus on bonding with your friends and family, and you get to guess what your eating~ on the side note, if you have any food allergies, they're able to accommodate that! Don't forget to grab one of their drinks! They're delicious!!",

    "text": "No lights! It's darker than a Vegas hotel room at night with your eyes closed. Check in, wash your hands and all valuables and lighted electronics go in a locker. Order your cocktail and meet your waiter/waitress. Our waiter was Christopher Jonathan. He led us in by putting our hands on each other like a human centipede, moving our way in Nd out around tables and people which of course you can only hear. Only light is a small red dot from the waiters night vision goggles but still not enough to see anything. The preset menu is a mystery only to be figured out by texture, touch, smell, taste and comparison to your fellow diners. Crazy experience with 6 courses of figuring out where and what your food is. The waiter described the plate using a clock and shapes because the plates were not all round. Also drinks in glasses so be careful not to spill. Most food can be eaten with your hands which is much easier than utensils missing your mouth. Lots of laugh and discussion which makes for a great meal and conversation. Once you are done and outside you can look at menu. I didn't know I liked cashew cheese. Good meal for vegans and seFood lovers. Definitely a once in a lifetime experience. Sorry all the pics were black. Lol",

She's been wanting to do this for quite sometime, but there isn't anywhere in Chicago that offers it, so of course since we were traveling to Vegas we had to go for dinner.  Note! Buy the Groupon. Otherwise you're looking at $166+ for dinner with no drinks. GRANTED, that price was still pretty worth it.   Like I mentioned I have pretty bad anxiety, so when we got there my heart was already beating outside my chest. Not a fan of being unaware of my surroundings. However our server Chris did a fabulous job easing me down. He was incredibly friendly and kept the food coming, which honestly when you're already anxious about sitting there in the dark, it was nice to constantly have another plate of food brought out, so you were always focused on SOMETHING.   The food was delicious, and we had a blast trying to figure out what we were eating. Even if I didn't personally like what was on the plate, I didn't mind since it was cool just to guess the spices and the origin.   Again I'm surprised I'm saying this, but I'd honestly do this again!",

    "text": "I was excited af to try this out as soon as I heard about it and it's A-OK in my book!  I checked it out with my favorite yelper who's always down to try things and step out of her comfort zone..  Service: Great service from entering the building until the very end.  You're greeted immediately by a host and they get you checked in: process your waiver, get you a locker to secure any belongings that might emit light, and introduces you to your server.  Our server broke down the upcoming experience of your other senses become enhanced in the darkness.  Jessica (I believe was her name) was great from beginning to end.  She made us feel comfortable as she led us to the table and brought our dishes for the 6 courses.  She was very professional, friendly and checked on us frequently.   Food: You have 3 choices for the 6 course meal: Savory, Sweet or Spicy.  I went with spicy and she went with savory.  The food was all vegetarian based we were informed.  Little over priced in terms of the quality and volume, but the experience makes up for the food shortcomings.  Water wasn't offered with our meal, but that was fine since we were enjoying our cocktails.  Cocktails were made well and were $14 a drink.  Ambiance: The lobby was inviting, smartly decorated and clean.  Your dining is in complete darkness but the chairs were padded and comfortable.  Based of the sounds from our conversation and feeling around, I'm guessing our small table was square 3x3 or 4x4?  The background music keeps the mood chill and soothes any anxiety you might have of dining in the dark.  In here, you're more likely to hear food being chewed and cocktails being drank.  Even the voices sound a little different in complete darkness.  I was with a friend I can chat with for hours,but make sure you have someone you enjoy talking with over an hour+ period or it can make for a long dinner. ijs..=)  Value: $64.95 for each person for the current 6 course meal is a little steep considering the quality and quantity of food.  Vegas is a low key foodie city and $64.95 can get two people some high quality food in this city quickly.  I understand we're paying a premium for the experience but the price is coming out hot because it's brand new and there's a buzz.  Something to check out once?  Absolutely, I had a blast and the staff was great.  The value isn't there at the current price but I've paid much more for dining experiences where I didn't have as much fun.  If the price decreases, a local's discount or a groupon kicks in there's a good chance I'll head back.  If they incorporate some kind of happy hour or reverse happy hour special I'm coming back quickly with a group! lol  The experience was that much fun for me!  I really hope Blackout is successful because I love the concept and it's the kind of dining experience that compliments our city",

Once you enter, you really are in pitch black nothingness. You're extremely vulnerable and need to rely on your server.   It is definitely an experience that I think everyone that's willing to try, should try.   I found myself using my hands to feel out my plate before using my fork. It was really difficult figuring out if we ate all our food or not or whether it was dropped in our lap. It was quite cold in the restaurant so maybe bring a light sweater if you get cold easily.   It's interesting trying to figure out your food relying merely on your taste, touch, and scent.   My favorite dish was my last course. Since this is supposed to be a mystery I won't ruin the guesses. Overall, it was a different experience and that's basically what you're paying for. The food was meh. But the service was good. I was pretty full at the end. I'm not sure if they've enhanced the menu to be more filling but my group was full.   Would I come back again? Probably not. The food wasn't screaming amazing but the experience was great!",

    "text": "I was fortunate enough to try this place out thanks to a lovely invitation from a friend. Apparently Blackout Dining just opened at the beginning of this month so it was pretty exciting to try this place out in its prime.  What I liked about this place was its air of mystery. You can tell from the rest of the reviews that no one dared to reveal anything about the main menu so I'll hop onto the bandwagon and keep the mystery chain going as well!  When you reach the restaurant building from the start, you'll notice all the windows are blacked out into secrecy. The entrance is actually on the other side, hidden from view so you'll have to walk around until you see white lettering embossed on the door. Upon walking in, you're greeted with the receptionists wearing uniforms in the same colour scheme as the walls and brand logo of Blackout - black and green. You'll be asked to sign a waver from their immaculate mini computers.   Afterwards, you are given a key for a mini locker to put your wallet/bag and cellphone away near the bathroom hallway. They'll make it quite clear that absolutely no photography is allowed once you've entered the dining room. I guess that's part of the idea though- a dining experience thats shrouded in mystery. Oooh, ahh!  Once seated, the server will ask give you three options on how you like your menu to be: spicy, savory, or sweet. Don't hesitate to be inquisitive; ask all the questions to your liking. The servers will definitely try to make it comfortable for you as possible. Luckily we came in before it was time for dinner so we pretty much had the four course lunch menu! And oh, whats that, alcoholic drinks? Don't mind if I do!   Now imagine being in a room in total darkness. Its a strange type of intimacy where you take your time feeling around for things and getting out of your comfort zone by depending on your senses. I was apparently at a table seated among 12 friends so it was thrilling and entertaining to hear their reactions and sounds- from slurping their drinks, crunching onto ice, and om nom nom-ing on their meals. One of them in particular wanted to be the jokester and be touchy feely among their neighboring friends HAHA! It was also fun pseudo clinking to everyones glasses as we made a fake toast to start our meals!   I'd also like to mention that the musical score they had for background music in the dining area was interesting. They had smooth electronic beats but wasn't overtly done nor did it feel like a nightclub/lounge. It felt rather intimate and surreal, I heard beats from Alina Baraz's \"Undress You\" and reminisced in Sneaker Pimp's \"Six Feet Underground.\" Hearing that definitely heightened my stay there.   Overall, my first sensory experience here was inevitably something that coloured me unique. I liked the idea of it and the execution was definitely creative. However, for the price I honestly feel that it would be best to be here when there's a promotion (ie: the 20% off they had earlier this week) to make it worth the value. I'd love to come back for their six course menu though. Take note that their menu changes every season!",

They'll give you a pre set menu you can choose from or you can try a mystery menu (which they'll randomly pick from the pre set menu. You'll be greeted by your waiter and enter the curtains where it is pretty much dark. You'll hold your hands on the persons shoulders and move like a slow train walking by other diners. Overall it was a cool experience and I'm glad we tried something different. Let's just say the conversations are interesting when you can't see anyone. The food was pretty easy to find once they tell you they're setting it own. You'll feel for your drink and utensils. Our table did great, no one was clumsy and we all communicated very well. Our party of 4 was $240 at the end including tip (6 course meal).    TIP: The staff walks around the the inferred goggles so they can easily see if we need anything, by waving our hand in the air. You'll have to have them guide you back out to use the restroom and you'll put on a pair of sunglasses to enter the lobby. It'll be surprising to your eyes when it's trying to adjust back to the light. Use it!!",

The education on how to get the most from the experience that was provided by our server Willy was top notch. Willy's demeanor on having a good time was felt during the initial greeting and carried on until our experience was completed.  The ingredients for each course was broad and made us challenge our senses. We were able to distinguish half of the dishes, the other dishes we were not able to identify were completely enjoyable.  I came to the experience with an open mind, and the Blackout did not underdeliver on challenging my senses or tastebuds. We recommend trying this, ENJOY!",

I work in the restaurant industry and after reading many reviews, lowered my expectations for the taste and whatnot.  Definitely didn't need to do that though.  Everything was super flavorful, some more simpler than others but from the perspective of serving dishes that are going to be eaten in the pitch black I think it was a great menu.  Course 3 was my favorite.  I left full, got to drink a couple local beers, had pleasant service, and an overall good time.  For a 6 course prix fixe the pace was rather quick.  I do think it could have been slowed down just a tad to allow a couple extra minutes between courses, though our server was extremely upbeat and fast momentum so perhaps that was her style.  Pro tip: don't be afraid to eat essentially everything with your hands, and listen when the server talks about where things are located in your dish or table.  Recommend going at least once!",

    "text": "Just wow! This truly is an experience! This is not just a restaurant, it truly is an array of feelings you aren't accustomed to.   As you walk in it's a modern, clean front area. Very friendly staff welcome you and give a quick intro to the concept. Then they have you sign a waiver, put away your things in a locker, pick type of flavor: savory, sweet or spicy (the only thing you get to know about your menu). This is also when you tell them if you have any allergies or food aversions. My brother and I are vegan, they were very accommodating and assured us they would not put anything non-vegan in front of us. They said since this is dining in the dark, they take food preparation very seriously and don't cross-contaminate anything, which put me at ease.  Now, we were escorted into the restaurant, in a \"train\" form, with hands on each others shoulders led by the server. It is a surreal experience, it's completely dark (close your eyes, like that!) and all you can sense is smells and noise from tables around you. Felt like being in a haunted house. As we were seated at a table, the servers gave us more directions as far as how the food will be served. After a while memory kicks into gear and you are able to find your way around your dining space. I was drinking my water and cocktail no problem. Feeling my way slowly not to accidentally knock anything down.   The food! I have never felt this much thrill while eating in my entire life! Each bite is a complete mystery, you race through the food trying to experience it and discuss it with your dining buddies. There was an item with a fresh strawberry that I and my husband recognized right away, however my brother just could not guess what it was until we told him! This experience truly makes you focus on the food and enjoy it to its full extent! There were 6 courses of small size, and by the time you get to dessert you are well stuffed, but the dessert was absolutely perfect ending to the dinner! Whatever that chocolaty goodness was, was amazing and worth another trip to there just for that!  I cannot wait to return and bring more friends! I have been talking about this place to everyone who will listen!  Seriously, thank you Blackout for the wonderful experience, your staff, food and concept was unforgettable!  If you have read through my novel this far, you must go! It's like skydiving, everyone should try it at least once!",

They are very concerned about safety and everybody having a great time. I have never been to a restaurant that cares so much about food allergies and making sure everything is perfect. Obsidian is one of the best drinks on the menu! Nothing scary about the food at all. Nothing that crawls or moves! Nothing raw! Tourist or locals should stop by! They seriously do go out of their way for the guests!",

He was funny and seemed to appear just at all the right times. There was never a moment when we needed something and he was not available to assist.

He is the best waiter I've ever had the pleasure of dining with.        It was pretty exciting eating in the dark, fumbling around trying to find things.

With our sight being eliminated we focused more on the taste. It was so wonderful. Each course was a surprise. I will be back. My wife and I had a date, and the waiter secretly handed me a rose to give to my wife at the end of the night. Total darkness was such a fun and interesting experience. One of the waiters was a bit loud. We had a hard time not hearing his conversations with the other patrons. We wanted to keep each piece a surprise. Nonetheless we had a fantastic experience.",

Once you enter the dining area there are no lights. The waitstaff leads you to your table and as they bring out each course they describe to you what they set in front of you. While you eat your food in complete darkness you try to guess what flavors your tasting. At the end of your meal you'll find out how well you guessed. it's an extremely interesting experience; one your likely not to forget.",

    "text": "What a memorable experience!!!  Seriously, the place is dark. As in pitch black. You store your phones and anything else with lights (like watches) in a locker to ensure the dining area stays dark. The server marched us in like kids: single file, our hands on each other's shoulders, nice and slow. This was good because it is really disorienting to see NOTHING. But she put us at ease, carefully guiding us to the table and helping us get oriented and seated. We felt completely safe the entire time.  She also guided us through the meal, explaining where the food was as dishes were served, and making suggestions as to how we could eat it. Expect to use your fingers a lot! It's easiest, and no one can see you anyway. :)   The menu was really creative, and we liked most of it a lot. \"Plant based\" does mean meatless, in case you didn't catch that - it was a vegan menu. We had fun guessing what it was we were eating, and at the end we saw a menu telling us what it was. We got most of it right but not all. It's really interesting using your other senses more, and noticing what cues you focus on. And although we couldn't see the dishes, I appreciated that they used really interesting shapes. When you can't see, touch is that much more important. They also had good low-key music playing the entire time...to my surprise, I tuned it out, while one of my friends said that was a highlight for her, putting her into almost a meditative state.   This is an experience I'd love to repeat in the future. They change the menu every few months so that it's always a surprise. So much fun!",

    "text": "This is a different kind of black out! Its definitely a one of a kind dining experience. I ate here about a month after they opened. I found a friend ballsy enough to try it with me. Basically you have a pre set  6 course meal in the dark. You cannot pick from a menu so all is a surprise. You only have the choice of picking from savory, sweet, or spicy. So you definitely have to tell then if you have any food allergies. The only things you can order from a menu prior are the alcoholic drinks.  You are not allowed to bring your phone or anything that lights up inside the restaurant. They provide lockers for you to keep your personal belongings.  Before walking in, they will bring you into a room for your eyes to kind of adjust to the dark. After that you are led to your table. You walk in a straight line....hands on shoulders of the person in front of you til you reach your table. Once you are seated you will start to adjust and feel comfortable. I will not be sharing with you the food we ate, but I can tell you we did end up full at the end. Even though portions were small, I feel it was just the right amount. I feel like you always have to keep a convsrsation going with your party otherwise it will be awkward silence. Since its pitch black, your other senses such as hearing and taste are more enhanced. We got a 10% local discount. They change up their menu every season as well. I truly enjoyed the experience, but not sure if I will be back anytime soon. Dont forget to make a reservation. If you are adventurous then definitely try this place. It may be a good 1st date place if you are a nervous kind of person because you guys can get to know eachother in the dark hahaha.",

My nerves calmed after a few minutes and I must say it was amazing. The atmosphere is so relaxing, you could hear all the servers and they all sounded so friendly and all have a sense of humor. Loved our waitress. The food was amazing! We were so stuffed by the 5th dish but we did not give up we kept it pushing till the end and every single dish was amazing and full of flavor. At the end we got to know what we were eating and we were dam near close to what we tasted. Definitely recommend, but don't waste your time or a friends time if you are not fully committed to dine in complete darkness.",

However, seeing that you can't actually see the pour, we both soon realized it was about two drinks of wine and the glass was empty.  I was a little taken back by this and disappointed.  Next time I would bring my own bottles so I know how much we are getting.    The food was good.  Our only complaint was the food is just on the warm side vs being hot.  Possibly because they do not want you to burn yourself as you can't see the food.    Not sure if we will try again.  Our server Anthony was great!

This is my second time dining at Blackout.  First the food is amazing.  I thought it was good the first time but this time out did itself.  I love that while your eating you try to figure out what is in the meal.  You cannot see it so it is completely on taste, feel and smell.  The fact that you are in the dark makes the experience even more fun and adventurous.  Our waiter Anthony helped to make the experience more than I expected.  He was fun and personable.  You always knew where he was when he approached the table or set the food and drink in front of you, he also explained where everything was sitting so you could find it, in the dark.  The atmosphere is fun and relaxing at the same time because unless you tell everyone what you are doing they cannot see you if you are drinking your soup or eating with your hands.  It was a fun experience and I am looking forward to going again.",

    "text": "Dined here when they first opened as a guest of a friend who was very excited about it.  First things first: this is a VEGAN restaurant. No meat. No dairy. No animal products. None. It doesn't matter what you tell them on your form and if you tell them you eat meat- it is all an act to make you guess what youre getting. And at no time will it be meat. They've even said here on responses that they dont offer meat because they find it too easy to guess what it is by eating a piece of chicken or steak. True as that may be- it's dishonest and feels very very misleading as a patron.  I eat almost entirely vegetarian- and I was still offended. This is a city with a lot of fine dining, some of the best in the world, if people are going to spend that much on a tasting menu- let them know what it may be comprised of (I.e this is a entirely plant based menu) everyone should be aware of that going in. It's dishonest not to and you upset more people after the fact than if you had told the truth. I can only imagine the reverse of tricking people into a meal with meat or dairy  and saying \"look how good that was! Look how we've broadened your horizons!\" Actions like this is what gives a plant based lifestyle and vegans a bad rep.  The review listed here by a 'Lisa G.' Stating she got steak and fish is a blatant lie. Previously Lisa messaged me asking me to take down my Tip here that stated it was a vegan restaurant. She asked me to because she thought it would scare people away and this could help people be turned on to vegan food not knowing when they go in! furthermore all of her yelp reviews are publicly for vegan food and vegan restaurants and on her profile it says \"i love vegan meals\" and \"meat causes cancer\" this woman didnt eat steak, nor was she served it. Im not sure what her agenda is and if she worked for Blackout but if not they should seriously consider deleting that misleading and dishonest review clearly written to \"trick\" people into going thinking they'll get meat or fish- and there's plenty of proof to call her out. I wouldn't want her review on my page if I were this establishment. Update: worse yet they've commented on it saying thank you to her without addressing the blatant lie in her reviews, which is highly unethical as a business and should be duly noted. They're aware of the fact this woman was never served meat as they say themselves they are a \"vegetable forward\" restaurant and are only helping the idea of 'tricking' people into enjoying plant based food without transparency.   Anyway I digress The experience was fun and unique but in the end the food was Lukewarm to cold, bland and even tasteless and not worth the money in any sense. Our service was wonderful but everything beyond that fell short on food and experience. Furthermore feeling like youve been lied to or tricked is an awful feeling after dropping hundreds of dollars a person- if this restaurant openly avdertised (and I mean publicly) they were vegan I'd respect them and what they were doing a lot more. In fact I would've been more excited had I known before rather than feeling like someone tricked everyone to smuggly say \"see, look how good that vegan meal was!!\" I've heard that since complaints started some waiters tell you at the get go it's vegan- which is better but in my opinion they could do a lot more to advertise this and make sure people knew, and it could in fact help people become more excited. Nowhere on the information about the menus does it say \"all of our menus are plant based\" which is I think misleading and unethical. Maybe if they change their business practice and chef I would consider going back, but for now in this town there is too much fine dining (even vegan) to pick from to come here.",

And going for the FOURTH next week.. as a LV resident I am so glad to have a \"neat\" dinner venue  to take my many guests for a wonderful UNIQUE dining experience!! They all rave about it to their friends when they return home and WISH it was available in their hometowns!!! From The front desk (Emily and Julia) to the wait staff (we had Anthony and Anna) ALL were absolutely superb and did not hesitate to answer any and all questions we had from the moment we stepped in the door up to the moment we exited!!! ANTHONY amazed us at his deft handling of our table and comments throughout along this culinary journeyKudoes to the chef as each course (7 in all) WAS ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS and we all were amazed at the delicate to intense flavors.. you won't be disappointed!!!

    "text": "Absolutely awful experience for Valentine's Day. For what should have been a 1hr-1.5hr dinner, we were there for 3 hours!!! Walked in for our 7.15pm dinner reservation, the entire entrance was completely full with people standing around. We checked in at the front, and the receptionist did not bother mentioning the wait (poor customer service), so I proceeded to ask. She said it was a 1 hour wait. A 1 hour wait when we have a reservation? She advised yes. The funny thing is, if you cancel or are late here, they charge you the full cost of your reservation. They kept us waiting about 1 hour 20 minutes. I went and spoke to the manager and explained our frustrations. Her excuse was the weather. I advised her that is a poor excuse and not a valid one. I also noticed they kept seating people who's reservations were after ours. I bought this to her attention, and explained the poor service, and then we were seated next. I cannot explain how disgusting it is of this business to act in this manner. Firstly, you don't get greedy and double book, secondly, have the common decency to notify people of the wait beforehand so that they can make a decision on whether or not they want to stay, and thirdly, don't charge people to cancel because they refuse to wait! The way Rachel and her team handled Valentine's Day was nothing short of a sheer disaster, and appalling considering people are coming here for a special occasion. Everyone in the lobby was extremely frustrated. It made for an overwhelmingly horrible evening. This was my second time dining here, and I will never return! I suggest you don't go here, either!",

They took our drink orders and asked about any food allergies we had. Once we were ready to go back they came up and guided us back to our table. I think everyone should give it a try at least once!",

    "text": "Was on the fence at first because of the reviews, but wanted to do something different then the typical fancy dinner out for Valentine's Day. Nicki our server was amazing. She walked us through each course. The food was great and fitting for the environment. People talked about the price and how the meal didn't compare to what they paid, but I disagree. I think about what type of dinner I could have gotten for what I paid and I definitely wouldn't have wanted to eat those in compete darkness. The food was flavorful, filling and appealing. True it wasn't piping hot, but it wasn't cold. Again, I appreciated the temperature considering the situation. Kudos to the owners, cause this was a night to remember. I definitely recommend to any foodie out there looking for something different.",

Both popped into my mind.  But what an experience we had. From the moment we walked in the door everyone was so friendly and inviting.  Our server Anthony truly made our experience what it was. Magical! His personality and incredible service were second to none! We never had to wait for anything. It was like we were his only table!  He was also very conscientious of my friend's dietary restrictions and was diligent in making sure she was taken care of.  I would recommend this experience to anyone and would definitely go back another time! GREAT JOB!",

I came here with my two best friends to celebrate a birthday... the service was excellent and the staff were all super sweet and friendly. Food is all plant based and tasted great! It was honestly such a unique experience. You literally do not see a thing and the entire menu is a mystery as well (they let you know what you had at the end)... you basically pick a sweet, savory or spicy option and the rest is a mystery :)  Very awesome experience and I would highly highly recommend this place... this is definitely something you should try in life!!!!",

Ashley was our server and she was so nice and really explained everything so clearly. I've known these friends for 10 years and we learned so much about each other because we didn't have our phones or any other distractions.  Highly recommended!!",

It was a fun challenge to guess food and an even more interesting one to try and use utensils in the dark. I'd highly recommend this to anybody looking for an out of the box dinner. You really can't see anything in there, it's Pitch Black. Although sometimes you can see the infrared goggles of the waiter or waitress if they're looking directly at you.",

The food is all plant based but it was very very good. 6 course meal and things I would probably have not tried if I could have seen it or known what it was before eating it. But it was surprisingly good and I would highly recommend trying it out at least once! Ken was our waiter he was very attentive and made the experience very enjoyable.",

The best part, the food! So delicious and full of flavor, despite the fact that it's vegan and the fear it won't be tasty, was not the case.

    "text": "A great fun experience with tasty food. Prior to entry you can provide any dietary or food allergy information and they will accommodate you. The food was amazing!! The experience was amazing!! The service was amazing!! This was my first time dining in the dark and I would recommend it to anyone. The music selection was great and it is fun to guest what you are eating with whomever you are dinning with. Phones, purses and anything that may illuminate(Fitbit, Apple Watch .etc) must be removed and secured in a locker that you will have a key too. Note, if you do not eat meat be aware that they will substitute it for seafood (if you eat seafood). In my situation they added crab cakes (I found out during checkout) and it was almost an extra $50. Be sure to ask for the price of a substitution was made or just ask for no meat and no seafood to minimize the cost. Either way, I was happy for the crab cakes and if given the option I would have paid the up charge. The staff were all friendly and accommodating. An overall Great experience!!!",
