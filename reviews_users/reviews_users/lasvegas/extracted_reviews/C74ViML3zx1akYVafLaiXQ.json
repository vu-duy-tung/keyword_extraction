Witnessed a server drop a fortune cookie on the floor and place it back on the check presenter on the table next to mine.. that was just the start of our dining experience. The waitress asked for our drink order and as we were giving it to her she was walked away saying, \"ok,ok thank you\".. all the tags on the line are incorrect and tons of cross contamination, not to mention they have raw oysters that are just sitting there and are at room temperature which is very dangerous!! They have store bought almond cookies and the salad bar has a big huge green light that says salads but all they have is cut romaine and that's it..  all the dipping sauces has a film on the meaning they are old and have been sitting there.. I could go on about all the health code violations they have here but it's way too much to list. All in all, if you're looking to get food poisoning then come to this place, you'll be sure to sick from something here!",

Some of the items seemed to be on the inedible side.  I wouldn't have gone here for several reasons, if it were not because it is a mecca for tour bus and there were no other restaurants in the same shopping center.  1) The price for Sunday lunch was too expensive.  $14.99 for Sunday buffet?  That's outrageous.  2) The service.  They obviously could not handle a sudden rush of folks.  That's the unusual part as I am sure that tour buses stop here at least once a week. 3) I would have chosen to eat for the same or cheaper price at a off the strip buffet restaurant.  And 4) The A/C wasn't on.  With the weather outside in the 90's.  Are you crazy?  BTW, I ate at this restaurant two months ago.  The only reason that I still remember the dreadful experience is that it is in Las Vegas, one of the buffet meccas.",

    "text": "This was the nastiest restaurants I have ever been in. I can't for the life of me, figure out why the health department hasn't closed it down.   My husband and I wanted Chinese food, saw this place and decided to try it. We were seated and then went up to the buffet and retrieved our plates. I noticed something felt greasy under my plate and turned it over. It was filthy, absolutely no exaggeration. I grabbed my husband and had him flip his plate over, again the same filth. I took the plates back to the pile we got them from and set them aside. Picked up another couple plates and turned them over, disgusting! I set those aside and started going through the pile. Every plate i picked up was greasy and had food residue on it.  At this time, I decided to talk to the people at the front counter. I showed them the plates and told them the whole stack was dirty. They told us to try another stack of plates so we did. The very same grease and crud was on those plates. In the meantime, the woman took the plates into what I assume was the kitchen. She emerged telling us it was taken care of. I told her I couldn't find any clean plates so she disappeared into the kitchen again. Out she comes with a stack of styrofoam plates, seriously. She put them by a stack of dishes and I grabbed a couple.   We put a varied assortment of food on our styrofoam plates and headed back to our table. I started to eat only to find the food lukewarm. Got up, went and grabbed another plate and dished up some other items of food and returned to my seat. Oh swell the same lukewarm temperature.  In the meantime, I see a guy from the kitchen come out with stacks of plates on a cart. He stops at the first stack of plates and piles the fresh plates onto the dirty ones. Goes to another stack and does the same thing. Out of curiosity I go and get a fresh plate off the first pile he stacked. The plate was filthy! Picked up a few more and the same thing, grease and food residue. So, I decided to check the warmth of the food in all the tables by hovering my hand over the food to see if I could feel any heat. Barely felt anything. This was not near closing, this was at dinner time. I wanted to scream at the other people eating there to check the underside of their plates and ask if they noticed that their food was not hot as required by law, but I didn't.  So, the next time you go there, check every plate you use and don't eat food that is lukewarm as it could make you very sick or kill you!  By the way, Chinese are notoriously cheap. That would explain the dirty dishes, not using sufficiently hot water and changing the water in the rinse tank. As for the warmth of the food, it costs money to raise the temperature in the steam tables as it consumes more gas and that costs money.   Diner Beware!",

The chicken wings were crispy, but the meat tasted foul. The rangoons lacked any filling. The fried rice tasted old. The sushi rice is dry.        Besides the bad food and service, the chefs were also bad, which is a rarity. The CHEFS were eating at the tables like the customers. This actually bothered me because one chef ate with bad manners, slurping his soup loudly, and the other was staring at me with a funny and dirty look non-stop.",

They have added more chairs which make it nearly impossible walking around with your plate with out the waiters bumping into you. Cleanness is far from it. Serving spoons are not clean and used for more than one dish. Floors seem to be not mopped in days. Be careful of the ceiling fan they don't clean it and dust is clearly on it.   Now the food. It's not bad. I mean it's the kind of food that you can tolerate to eat. But when you are done eating you feel disgusting. Disgusted that you at at this place.   One thing about this place that I commend is the waiters though. They are poorly understaffed and they work really hard. In fact I didn't see one of them stand around.",

For starters, i watched them wash the floor with dishrags then put them on the beverage service bar, then move them onto a chair then the same rag was used to clean a table top.  YIKES!  At the mongolian section, while the cook was cooking my food, out came one of those rags and he was cleaning the grill and the rag touched my food!!!  YIKES.  The walls around the edge of our booth was covered with splatter and a quick look around, splatter and finger prints and dust and just plain dirty.  Like I said, the food was good and i made it through the night, but when you really look around at this place, you would think the health department would shut them down.  I could site many more observations, but i think you get it.  I also think many of the staff are living there.  I got a look in the back of house and i really think they are living in the kitchen.  I dont think I will every return.  Also, very unfriendly staff, maybe they just dont speak English??  Dunno.",

She suggested this place, since they had pretty good seafood and boba. I decided to try it out for myself with my classmates. For dinner, it only cost us $13. The place is pretty small when you walk in, but there is another eating area in the back. The food selection is somewhat varied. They have a small section for different soups, sushi, a grill area where you can get korean style ribs, seafood and beef cooked to your taste, dim sum, vegetables, and seafood, of course! I didn't get a chance to taste the lobster, since many people grab those first, and I didn't want to wait for them to make more...I love the spinach and the soy sauce/ginger fish they have. They have a mediocre dessert section (what do you expect from Asian buffets?), and I usually just get their almond jello fruit medley and coconut/orange jellos. Don't worry, they have the frozen yogurt machine, if all else fails!   The sushi is pretty fresh (mostly the salmon!). It's pretty cheap for what you get here, and I probably will take my parents here when they come visit. Warning: any food that is wasted will get charged.  In reality, I would only give this place 3 stars, but since they have all you can drink tapioca drinks (TARO MILK TEA!) that are pretty good, as well as Thai ice teas, included in their buffet....I'm going to give them 4 stars!",

Price was unbeatable at $12.85/adult with a large choice from the buffet:  Japanese sushi, crab legs, spicy crab, chinese dishes like spicy chicken, orange chicken, spicy string beans, a mongolian stir fry station with kalbi cooked to order, oysters on the half shell, etc   The food was pretty good on all counts-certainly wasn't Bellagio quality-but it was very tasty and an incredible value.",

People were lined up and 1 person took almost the entire pan. They put out such a small pan of lobster, and when we complained, we were told that the lobster was an appetizer only. It takes the kitchen staff to refill the lobster 20 minutes at a time. I thought this was an \" all you can eat buffet \" but apparently not. The spareribs were hard as a rock and dry, and their chow mein was stale. I cant believe the health department gave this place an A+.  I have seen these people put old food on top of new food, and they clean their floors with a towel right on top of their patrons. The health department must be made aware of this place, as well as who is in charge of buffets in town. This place is violating all the rules!",

The stir fry is a joke and tastes horrid. The beef and broccoli tastes 3 days old and the lobster claws were soggy and disgusting. It is an overstatement to say that this place is good in any way. The sushi at this buffet is so disgusting, the salmon sashimi they offer at the sushi station is so watery and tasteless. I really hope I don't get food poisoning from eating that. Once again, the food sucks hardcore, the service is good and the staff is friendly. If you think this is good in any way you must have burned off your taste buds. HORRIBLE.",

LOL the food is terrific, i can't complain about it. when we go visit our friend in henderson, we like to eat here. fresh seafood, crab legs, sushi is pretty good, lobsters and many of the typical chinese dishes. all drinks (not alcohol) is included too so i think my table had a good round of thai ice tea. i'm not sure why but their buffet stations have glass enclosures on the side by the clean dishes.... me and two of my friends hit our hands on the glass trying to grab a dish (3 separate times)...lolol guess we're just not use to the enclosure.",

We had a hard time communicating with our waitress. We were just asking for some ice. They have tables crowded in and there is a couple places where only one person can pass and the staff walks very slowly in front of customers and cutting them off. The floors were not clean. It didn't look like they had cleaned between lunch and dinner. They were out of several items as soon as they sat them out, because they allowed people to mound their plates with oyster, crabs or lobster...though there was a line of people waiting for them. I know it isn't 100% their fault, but they can manage that better. While we were sitting at our table one of the waitress came over and took our salt and pepper, never got them back. Then someone else came in...may have been a manager and proceeded to speak loudly with one of the waitresses in the middle of the restaurant while pointing at a pepper shaker on another table. The food was decent, nothing was a great standout. This isn't what I am use to with Buffet Asia. There is usually a couple things that are really good.",

I don't usuaully eat at buffets unless I know they are good, well this place blows Pacific out the door.  Their varieties were huge and the quality was excellent for the money.  Large variety of sushio, along with a well kept mongolian bbq, and I must recomen the steamed clams.  Between the clams, oysters, crab legs and craw fish, I honestly have no idea how this place makes money when considering the good quality along with the reasonable price.  This place has excellent service and unlike other buffets they actually make sure plenty of food is out at all times.  I was extremely impressed with this place, and the bar prices seem to be very reasonable.  As far as buffets go, this wins it hands down and then some.  There is no reason to try any other after this place, you will just be disappointed.  I highly recomend!",

We said Lunch and later she charged us one extra for dinner because one of us got crab legs but DID NOT specify that crab legs were included as apart of dinner when everything else was still the same and it had already been there. The food was not fresh. And there was no variety. Sad because we used to enjoy coming to this buffet especially when they has dumplings and fresh food varities. Basically ended up paying $40 for not that great of food or customer service. We are thankful this will be our last time. As we all have stomach aches after.",

After wasting $200 at this place, there's really no reason to return, for any aspect. The food, service, and atmosphere have all declined. Hopefully I can keep you from making the same mistake also.  The last time we were at this location was probably four or five months ago and things seemed OK. Since then, they've taken a nose dive and they're heading for a crash landing. Things were bad from the start when the super personable woman up front greeted us first with, \"how many?\" After tallying the head count at 13, she asked \"how many drinks?\" I was about to say 13, but stopped and asked if they were free and she said they weren't and were $1.50 each. What buffet does that crap for soft drinks?  The Mongolian grill is gone. They sushi stand was ransacked and looked like I fell into after drinking a 12 pack. They time stamp the sushi and saw some pieces that were there since 3:30 PM and it almost 8 when we were there. Pretty much all of the food was old and dried out with no attempt to replace any of it. Their one saving grace has been their crab legs, but my wife gave up on them after one trip because they were overcooked with no meat. My brother-in-law didn't finish his meal because he was getting an upset stomach from eating the chicken wings. Service was terrible for a buffet. Thirteen people are gonna go through plates pretty quick and they were piled up like we were having a tower building contest.  I could go on and on, but I'm not going to waste my time or yours writing, or even uploading photos. Just trust if you look at my rating distribution, no business gets this unless they truly deserve it.",

I probably come here twice a year and I have yet to be disappointed.  The price for dinner is about 1/3 that of a Strip buffet's price with a plethora of options to choose from for food and dessert.  Along with your freshly cooked typical Chinese fare, other options include a variety of soups, a sushi bar, a Mongolian BBQ/noodle station, and American classics (pizza for instance).    What makes this establishment even more worthwhile is their crab claws.  Now if you're a fan of the buttery crustaceans then definitely go here one time!   The last time I had dinner here, the claws were replaced frequently and the size of the claws rival those of their Strip buffet counterparts.  An unlimited amount of crab legs is probably bad for the heart but good for the soul.  :)  This location hosts a private room for private parties if needed and the space is pretty clean and well-maintained overall.  However, the bathrooms could definitely use a make-over.     When you're trying to stuff yourself and your family without breaking the bank, consider a trip to this buffet.  Your appetite will thank you for it.  Yelp 100 Challenge 2016 - 18 / 100",

Ask for one and you got attitude and given one at a time! The food is gross with very little flavor and all has a similar after taste like it was cooked in the same pots and pans, seats are dirty covered in food and grease, the dispensers of sauce on the table look like they haven't been wiped off in months, flies swarm the food in the buffet area, filthy bathroom with roach spray boxes of RODENT POISON!!!

You can now get made-to-order Mongolian BBQ plates with your meal also.",

What really makes it stand out though, is they have a girl working here I feel like she goes by Cindy. She's SUPER friendly, attentive, and has even offered to have food made for us that wasn't out on that particular day. We've been here a few times and she's always awesome and definitely deserves the recognition! She's not even a server as far as I know. She's usually up at the front.  I also like this buffet because they offer a little more variety, like they have awesome tempura and Thai soups. The food is always hot and fresh. Definitely the best choice if you're looking for an Asian buffet.",

The employee was not friendly at all. they move the trash can around the table to collect dirty dish. 1 star is because I cannot give it 0 star. Such a waste of time comming here, you should never ever come here. 12$ + 1$ of the grilled food. Not worth it.",

The place was absolutely filthy, don't even go in the men's room!  The ladies room isn't quite as bad.  The place is run down and looks like a soup kitchen.  There are beggars out front peddling garbage or begging for money.  Passing over most of the food which just looked like slop I settled on cold shrimp by the \"salad\" portion of the counters.  I was going to have a salad but the lettuce was wilted and didn't look good.  The sushi looked okay so I chose a CA roll then a bowl of wonton soup which was quite tasty.  I had a couple bites from my son's plate and wasn't impressed.  My brother ended up in the men's room tossing his cookies after taking a couple bites of something he had grilled.  I didn't personally see any CR's but I'm sure they are around.  The employees seemed like zombies.  It was just \"all about collecting your money\" to them.  We couldn't get refills or dirty plates cleared.  I tried to ask one employee a question about the ice cream machine and they looked past me and kept on going.  Tried to get a small cone and stood there for 3 minutes for one inch stream.  I think it was empty and nobody cared.  I tasted the chocolate that seemed to be coming out ok but OMG it was horrible.  If that was chocolate, I'm never eating it again.  Price at lunch is almost $10.00 and for dinner (after 3:30 pm) it is about $13.99.  Way over priced for such a dump with nasty food.  If you find yourself here, I recommend the fresh fruits.  I hope these are okay because I did enjoy those.",

Once you've tried Todai and the Rio's Seafood Buffet, give this place a shot and I don't think you'll want to go back to either place for a seafood buffet ever again. I actually like it better than Todai and the Rio. It's got a better selection of food and it's half the price. Albeit the decor isn't as nice as the other two places, but I would trade a nicely decorated place for better food any day. The quality of the food is slightly better at Todai and the Rio, however it's not twice the price better, it maybe only be $2 - 3 better.   This place has got you covered with a little bit of Chinese, Thai, Korean, Mongolian BBQ, dim sum, and a decent sushi bar (the freshness is a bit hit and miss towards the end of the night, but spectacular at lunch). Dinner gives you a selection of lobster, snow crab, mussels, oysters, fried shrimp, fried scallops, and so much more.   Since this place is off the strip, you also don't have to wait in the long lines. The servers are quite attentive, they will take plates almost as soon as you are done with it and I never quite saw the bottom of my glass.   This is our go to place when we were living in Las Vegas and had out of town guests that wanted a buffet. They've never been disappointed.   I'd technically rather give this place a 4.5 star because the ambiance isn't all that great, but this place deserves better than a 4, so I'm going with a 5 star.",

The egg drop wonton soup was pretty bland. There wasn't a variety of deserts that I personally thought were good. The sushi was alright, I wasn't overly thrilled at the taste. Overall, it was an ohkay experience. However the staff were pretty friendly, our waitress that handled our drinks kept checking up on us and offered frequently to refill our drinks and clear our table from the used dishes.

They also have a stir fri bar where a cook will cook the items of your choice while you wait.  The food was about average. The one let down was that the salad in the salad bar was warm and wilted.  I guess that most people do not go to a chinese buffett for salad, but since I am doing this everyday for almost three weeks, the inability to get any ruffage into my diet that day was dissapointing.  Plus it made me think if the salad was not being kept at the proper temperature what else might be amiss.",

I was a little taken aback today when we were charged $8.99 apiece (plus tax), but to be honest, it was worth every penny. Everything was not only fresh and beautiful, but each and every item had a sticker above it with the time that it had been brought out! Wow! Impressive!  The sushi was beautiful, there were plenty of delicious choices, and there was an abundance of ginger and wasabi. The fresh fruit was just that - fresh, and many choices. I personally LOVE the mongolian grill, and this one is my favorite because they used paper thin slices of meat-chicken, pork and beef, and all of the sides I love: water chestnuts, sprouts, cabbage, broccoli, garlic, baby corn, celery, etc. Mmmm, super good.   I'm just very impressed. The place was clean, the food not only looked good, but was delicious. Sometimes at a chinese buffet, I take little bits, because I either don't know what it is, or I want to try it to see if it tastes good. Not necessary here. Everything I took was delicious! Oh, and the service was also very attentive.   In reference to Meg H. on Aug 16, we had iced tea, and the girl refilled it every few minutes, however, if you order thai tea, there is an extra charge for that.  My mother, who eats like a bird, had just had outpatient surgery and we went straight to eat afterwards. She ate like a logger! I don't think I've ever seen her eat so much! Go mom!   Can't wait to go back!",

Of course the food tastes best when its fresh and hot, so you just have to time it right when they re-fill the section.

    "text": "Asian buffet, slightly above average in all aspects.  Buffet At Asia is an Asian buffet restaurant, priced cheaper than most casino buffets (around $16 for dinner) though there are Asian buffets that are cheaper still.  There is decent variety of foods and there is also a Mongolian grill (or bbq) where you can select the ingredients you want and they're cooked live in front of you.  I won't comment on the seafood as I don't eat any but there were crab legs and sushi options.  For meat lovers there was pork, chicken and beef, around 3 choices for each. All were decent tasting though they were a bit oil/fat-heavy. All of them tasted average, not bad but also not special, about the same you'd expect from any takeout.  I really enjoyed the sweet sesame balls (essentially dough balls covered in sesame and deep fried) though they were kind of heavy on the stomach.  There's also a large variety of vegetables, steamed or fried and I also saw frog legs! (for those who consider it a delicacy, I don't)  The desserts station had a large variety of fruit (quite refreshing from the usual buffet \"cheesecake and carrotcake\" staples) as well as soft serve ice cream, donuts (not the usual style but a deep fried style I didn't really enjoy, too oily and crispy with a sour/stale taste) and cakes.  Something that I found odd (even mildly annoying) was that there weren't descriptions/names in all of the foods, and those that had any description it was just written with a permanent marker on the glass above. It would cost nothing to print some nice readable labels and it would really change the image of the buffet and inform customers what every food is.  Service was fast (the place was not crowded at all when I visited) but one of the servers was.. weird (in a good way). She didn't speak much, she would just stand in front of you looking down instead of asking if you wanted a refill. Now that led to somewhat eerie moments of silence while attempting to establish communication (having someone stand silently in front of you and you saying \"coke please\" just seemed weird and rude). I assume she was just shy and maybe new at the job and I'm not going to mark them down for that.  There's also a sign on the wall that says there's an extra charge for wasted food. While this is understandable in a manner that someone who fills their plate with one type of food and doesn't eat it will cause the restaurant to throw it away, it may also put off people from trying new things thinking that if they don't like something or can't eat it they'll have to pay extra. I haven't encountered such a situation and hopefully the restaurant will be prudent but still the sign on the wall exudes a passive threat.  Overall, Buffet At Asia manages to be slightly above average in everything: price, food selection, taste (some foods tend to be heavy/oily), service. Hence 3/5",

One other thing, watch out for family with little kids, they run around and screaming like crazy, not ideal for a date night",

    "text": "The very first time I ate here, I was blown away.  It was cheap, and I could eat all the seafood and kalbi I wanted.  But over the recent years, there buffet has begun to decrease in quality and quantity.    Now, there is no selection for seafood.  I haven't gone here for dinner, but before for lunch they'd have lobster or crab legs set out with the kalbi.  I think they might've taken it away from the lunch menu and added it to dinner, or they might've taken it away.  I might just have to experience dinner here one day.    The location on Eastern used to be a little more cleaner than all their other locations, but so far not so much.  They have dishes laid out everywhere, and sometimes their table smells like wet towels.  Try avoid eating the noodles, or rice...it looks like it's been sitting out for a while and it did give me a sore stomach.",

    "text": "Popular buffet in the burbs focusing on various asian cuisines, including, Japanese, Thai, Korean and Chinese. The quality of the food is just OK, as you'd for these lower end buffets. This is certainly no Todai. The overall quality is influenced greatly by how long the food has been sitting under the heat lamps. The first plate of Pad Thai was pretty good, while a later plate was pretty lackluster.  While my dad loves the Korean beef that is cooked by a chef, I like the  garlic string beans best. There at least a half dozen different chicken dishes, in all different styles. I didn't care for the lemon chicken, while the others were decent.  My mom said the fish balls weren't too good. The sushi are unremarkable.  They have yellow watermelon which is good. I like the almond jello too. I'd avoid the perennial chocolate fountain.  Service is average. Sunset station is much better at picking up the finished plates promptly. Here they are about average.  $6.99 lunch includes hot tea, but not sodas. Good value. Get there early as there's a wait once you hit 12:30 or so.",

    "text": "Ate at the location on Eastern & Flamingo yesterday (Sunday). I eat at many asian buffets, so I know what to expect.  Here's my honest take:  Pros:  -Decent selection of food  -Server was friendly and attentive  -Gyoza dumplings, Wonton soup, Jalapeno chicken was really good, pretty decent quality fruit - seemed fresh.  Cons: -Sign claims to have \"Thai, japanese, chinese, american etc\" all different types of cuisine - the only Thai dish they had was Pad Thai, and it was of really poor quality. The sushi was kinda gross, too. They only really had chinese, and some cheap pizza for the kids.   -Restaurant in general has a \"dirty\" feel to it. I was afraid to touch anything. I ate finger foods with my fork to avoid getting sick. It was really busy, but it didn't seem like they were keeping up with the crowds very well as far as cleanliness goes.  -Bathrooms were filthy, totally trashed. I saw an employee go in to clean, but she wasn't wiping up the mess, just spraying disinfectant randomly and emptying trash.  -The grossest thing about this location were the customers - REALLY filthy people. Waiting in line to get in, a man in front of us had *KILLER* B.O. - the kind legends are made of. It smelled like he hadn't washed his ass for a month! It kinda sucked to have to experience that right before eating. The people sitting near us seemed dirty and trashy too. I know the proprietors of the restaurant can't control this, but it ruined the experience for me.  -It was really busy, and I was nearly run over by servers, kids and fat people every 5 minutes. It was difficult to walk around with a plate of food in your hands.",

Second, I noticed a sign that says if you don't eat all your food you will be charged (which means two things). One, usually when a sign says that it's because the food is not great so many people leave left over food on their plates (if the food was great, everyone would eat almost everything). Second when a restaurant especially a buffet is cheap on the food, then they are cheap with the quality. Thirdly, the bathrooms were nasty and graffiti writing all over the walls (this place was not in a good neighborhood). I recommend eating on the Strip or a casino.",

However, they dont want to charge you while you're at the front desk getting seated, the waitstaff (who barely speaks english) would seat you first, let you eat for 10mns, then ask you how many people and what are the ages of the kids. Then come this loooooong broken-english explanation of how they charge, then they ask for the height of the kids, then age again. WTF!!! Just have a damn ruler at the front and do that instead if they want to charge u by height!!! In-fact, I should get charged half price because I'm shorter than 5' !!! It took us 10 minutes to get the head count straightened out ( we had a party of 14, kids and infants included) and she would bring you the check and literally stay at the table and watched me bust out my purse to pay. This is barely 15 minutes getting seated and I literally was still chewing while she stood by after handing me the check. Rude. I could have paid first!!!  The variety of food is lacking for a buffet. i've had better. You're better off going somewhere else. However, I did come on a weekday.  Note: My 3 yr old son was charged $7 because when they asked me for age, I said 3 yrs old and I guess they thought I said 3 feet. LOL. Other places, he's usually free. I don't have the time to try to argue with them on that since they barely speak english.",

The restrooms are disgusting, you could tell they hadn't  been cleaned in a while or even on a regular basis. The waitress only came by to give us our drinks and then once again to let is know they were going to be closing. She never offered refills or to pick up our stacked plates and basically kicked us out. The food was an average C. Not only is this place overpriced for how crappy they are but they still managed to rip me off even more by double charging a tip on my bill on a party of 3 when they state they only charge tip on parties of 8 or more. Avoid all of this and go spend your money elsewhere.",

EXPENSIVE, BAD SELECTION FOR $$$$, BAD QUALITY, DIRTY...

    "text": "Did Lady Luck rob you blind? Perhaps the dealer had gotten a 21 one time too many and now you're completely broke but still want to eat your sadness away? Well look no further than Buffet @ Asia. Who can drop that much money Bacchanal Buffet anyways? For as little as $15 (that said I didn't get too good of a look at the prices if you know what I mean), you can gorge yourself alongside others determined to commit gluttony. Score yourself a 15% coupon and you even get to save some more! Maybe that $30 that you saved can lead to a jackpot! Just be aware, this is a Chinese buffet, as in don't expect the best.  Like most Chinese buffets at dinner time, the place was loaded with seafood. Most importantly, they had dim sum style lobster! For $15, you're getting all you can eat lobster. Am I dreaming and living the buffet life or what? Throw in salmon sashimi, crab legs, frog legs, and dynamite and it's a home run! Unfortunately, I must admit that the food is obviously not of the best quality. The clams were sandy and had a weird, somewhat metallic taste. The oysters weren't very fresh and weren't cleaned properly. The nigiri had obviously been sitting out for a long time and should have been disposed of. At the beginning of service, the salmon sashimi was very very good. Then, it became horrible cuts and believe it or not, I found a piece of bone in a piece. Yuck! The shrimp dynamite was deliciously cheesy and creamy but none of the shrimp were deveined. I don't know about anything else I found that the taste of the food in general was strong; it's heavily seasoned.   Now, onto service. Holy moly! My table literally never had an empty plate at any time. There were times they carted my plate away while I still had food on it that I was getting to! And yes, most of the time, the item about to be taken away were lobsters and crab legs. My water was constantly being filled to the very blink. They were probably hoping that I'd get full off the water.   Overall, for $15, this place is a steal. It's a bit messy but this is a Chinese buffet boy! You do't come here for world class service; you come here for food at dirt cheap prices.",

My wife and I went here due to indecisiveness and lazy to drive else where.   Moreover the staff is quite friendly and pretty quick at serving the beverages. However the food...how can I say this...the food was sooo bland no taste. And for some reason right when I get my food and then sit down the food is already cold. Luckily we got there at dinner where they gave us more options. For example crabs legs, but even though the taste of the crab legs something was off. The butter for the crab legs taste like if it was old butter just being reused.   I hate to give them such of a low rating but the fact that i couldn't eat another plate because of the taste and that my wife and I felt sick mildly sick afterwards. So like I said if your low on cash and want a buffet I would recommend but if you don't have a strong stomach and have taste preferences don't.",

The hygiene standards are very off-putting. The dining room floor is obviously not cleaned on a daily basis and I'm curious if it's even cleaned on a weekly basis. The bathroom are disgusting. Even the door leading into the bathroom is covered in Grime. It looks like a door that I would see at an employee restroom at a garage or tire shop that is not used by the public. Inside the bathroom reeks of urine and has obviously not been fully cleaned in a very long time. It is a shame, because the bathroom itself would not take very much to get it up to standards. I found the food selection unusually Limited 4 a buffet. The one redeeming quality I found personally was the soups  I thought will well done. I will concede that soup is one of the hardest Foods to mess up. My experience with the wait staff was Pleasant, as they were friendly and kept my beverages topped off. Overall I was disappointed and in the end a little worried.  I have nothing against greasy spoons, but the hygiene standards I witnessed leave me wondering if I will spend this evening in the bathroom. I will not be returning.",

The selection was broad and the price was outrageously low.  I was introduced to this place by my cousin, who's a local, and I've been coming back ever since.  I haven't been back since March 2010.  I didn't write a review about this place then because I thought it was an off night.  It was primarily Chinese food and sushi rolls.  The dining areas looked run down and the rest room was a death trap.  Fast forward to August 2011.  Prices are still low but food quality has seriously declined.  It's strictly Chinese food now.  What throws it off is that there's a little side bar with banchan sides.  But what good is banchan if you can't pair it with Korean barbecue?  Dessert items are par for the course.  The sushi is ok, lots of fried rolls drenched with sweet sauces, and a few traditional varieties.    The dining areas are still very much rundown and the restrooms are still death traps.  But drinks were refilled right away and plates were cleared in a heartbeat.    Par for the course...",

I was really irritated after the first plate, the second plate was half eaten as I had had enough.   Oh, the service. I had to literally flag down the help to get my first soda. That soda was then taken to the wrong table.When the lady decided it must be mine I was seated by this time with a deep scowl. Alright, where was the refill?

The quality sucks!!! The wonton soup looked like pork sausage cut into chunks  and wrapped in wonton wrapper, the broth was mostly just soy sauce.  The tempura vegetables were not crunchy.. but soggy.. I could go on and on.  I ate what I could without wanting to vomit only because my dad treated us to lunch here and I didn't want to waste his money spent here. DO NOT COME HERE. FOOD IS NOT OF GOOD QUALITY OR TASTE!",

We pay the same too. Also the food now very less meat and the taste more salty too . And they still use all tableware plastic and paper. Never ever come back here again even hungry.",

However, I hav3 given this place 3 tries spaced apart to see if things changed but it seems they got worse. The dinner buffet was $13.99 Not too bad. The food was horrible. It had been left out. Chicken was rock hard etc Our table was super dirty & sticky. Nothing was fresh. The ice cream machine had water coming out of it mixed with ice cream. It had a odd texture & looked weird. I couldn't snap pics bc my phone died. I have decided third time is a charm & I will not come back. I thought maybe it would get better but it has not. I end up being grossed out each time wondering why the heck I wasted my money there. I will say other locations around the valley do not seem to be as bad as this one. The bathrooms are filthy, too.",

It was a weekend night, and all the nicer Las Vegas buffets had too long of a wait time for me to want to stand in line. I was hungry, and could pretty much eat anything after spending the entire day hiking in Death Valley.  Most of the food was decent; dishes are filled with MSG and oil but it's still tasty. There was a pretty good selection and you really can't go wrong when the tab is around $12-13 for dinner.",

    "text": "We went to this buffet during the state wrestling championship. I do believe that it is a great value, however My review is based on service as well as the cleanup crew. I took my five kids here Because they claimed to have sushi and sashimi as well as other Asian Delights. Food really was good, not how I expected. I don't really like buffets because the food is usually bland/plain and prepared in huge quantities with no personal touch. However this Asian food was similar to a fast food restaurant. The sashimi bar kept running out of salmon and tuna, and I would ask for them to replenish it. I saw a big piles of Artie prepped fish sitting on the counter, so I was not sure why they were not replenishing that fast. I do understand that seven of us were eating mostly so she me, so I gave an extra star for this. However about an hour before closing, they decided to start cleaning the floors. There was this huge horrible chlorine smell that start making us nauseous as we were trying to eat. Also the bucket water had a specific smell that you only smell when it's not changed often enough. I'm not sure how they figure that it's OK to sanitize the floors with smelly water while customers are sitting in booth next to the cleaner.   I will go back to this place, however I will make sure it's early enough to miss the inconsiderate buckets of chlorine.",

    "text": "Got charged $13 (tax, tips included) for a lunch Buffett in this restaurant. * believe me, they cover up all price in the restaurant.*   Choices are limited consider we came with a tour bus n this is the only restaurant that open @ 9:30 (ya, i'm aware it's official hours state 11:00).  Food: I believe most foods are left over from night before, since they come out from the kitchen with 1/3 of the regular serving.  Most dishes are either too salty or too much sauces that I can't even taste the food itself. (The place I used to work does it a lot to cover up ......... ya...)  Clams are not clean probably as there's still sand in it.   Service: unless u carry a bill in ur hand ready to tip, otherwise, expect to do it yourself. * after all, it's only buffet... what's there to serve other than greeting & taking away the plates*  Conclusion:  Even with the $2 off, I would still choose macdonald & in-n-out over this. Not only because of the food quality but also the service.    Really surprise this place existing to such long time without anyone reporting it.  Recommend this place to ppl that may feel more comfortable dining in a Chinese speaking environment and don't mind left over ingredients/food or anyone that has relationship pricing with no expectable.   Bon appetite!",

    "text": "Been here twice with my family, first time we went for Sunday lunch and since it was a busy day we attributed the frowning, solemn, pouting faces to the busy long work day. But we went again for a weekday lunch (which by the way was not busy at all, lots of empty tables) and it seemed the service this time had gotten even worse. No hospitality at all, no smiles or welcomes,no warm fuzzies,nothing to make us feel us being patrons at their establishment was appreciated. What we got were rolling eyes when we kindly asked to be seated in a seat across the way, underneath the fan because of how uncomfortably hot it was,on top of being seated in what seemed like the smallest booth in the restaurant and having to squeeze into the tight seat wearing a cast due to a broken leg. Albeit the eye rolls and the mere careless nod of a head while back facing us we greatly expressed our gratitude and appreciation for allowing us to switch. Now I'm not one to complain nor make a fuss about many things, I'm pretty tolerant when it comes to.most things in life. I've also worked in and I have managed all sorts of customer service establishments,including food service, so I understand sometimes people can have bad days, totally understandable (not that it's condonable) but understandable none the least. My number one is making sure my customers are happy, fulfilled,that can see that they are eating in a clean environment and they know that as patrons they are appreciated and undoubtedly welome. But this place is not anything I'd recommend to anyone I know or ever come across looking for somewhere to eat, it is quite contrary to anything I believe that a customer or patron should ever have to experience. On top of the horrible customer service the food is as bad as the place is filthy. We Will never eat here again. I've also noticed that it seems that they have not tried to come to any type of resolution or compromise with any of the hundreds of bad reviews posted here on yelp, convincing me that their mentality is, as long as they are still racking in business and are thriving in sales none of our concerns are a matter to them. Personally I feel this is an atrocious way to run a business catering to the public and I seriously don't understand how they are still open with their horrible service, filthy establishment and nauseous food. Buffet @ Asia should have had hazmat called a long time ago and should be considered a hazard to the community.",

As soon as we entered the so called restaurant that smells like wet dog the lady at the front was immediately distasteful and pushy. Once seated, we waited awhile for someone to greet us and take our drink order so we could get food. Finally some guy casually walks out from the kitchen and greets us!  We get up and start with the Sushi Bar...Just by looking at it you could already taste the stale, dried out rolls! There was sticky notes that said \"For Dinner Only\" on some roles! Assuming they were left out since lunch time! Gross AF!   We both got a couple that looked decent and kept going down the line thinking it would get better... Salad bar next.... WHAT salad bar?!?! There were two shrubs of lettuce and that was it. I didn't even bother.... Soups looked nasty and probably hadn't been changed since December of last year!   I don't know how anyone could consume this food!  We finally sit down and pick at the few things on our plates... my boyfriends eyes grew huge when chewing on the orange chicken, he said  tasted like rubber! We both tried a sushi roll and nearly spit it out, edamame was frozen, noodles were stale, long story short everything was garbage!! ( After we left we felt sick to our stomachs with the little amount we ate )  We have never been the kind of rude people to make a scene and walk out...So we politely told our waiter we were going to leave and my boyfriend was generous enough to pay for one meal! They were so rude when we were leaving and obviously talking shit in Chinese! They didn't deserve any money !    I'm sure we are not the only ones who have been so disgusted and left!! Please don't give this restaurant your business! It needs to be shut down!",

For its price it is a good lunch alternative. We have never had anyone get sick and everyone always finds something to eat.   For 13 bucks you get exactly what you pay for and similar places in socal offer basically the exact same stuff. However, if you go to some random buffet on the strip you will end up paying 30 to 50 a person and about half the time you will be disappointed.

Let's see here ... the food is pretty good I guess.  Nothing extraordinary and nothing that disgusts me.  I'm a vegetarian so there weren't many options for me.  I ate the Chow Mein, Saunteed Mushrooms, Fried String Beans with Garlic.  Furthermore, a couple of chocolate strawberries, fruit, and pastries. All of those were okay.  It didn't blow me away ... at all.  The place looks rather nice outside; I wouldn't say the same for the inside.  It doesn't look too clean.  Actually, I can put up with the look, but it's not exactly attractive.  So to sum things up; it's average. Call it a plain jane place if you want.",

Depending on which location you are at, they also serve Korean BBQ at some of their spots, and that would have to be my favorite at this place.  Althought the food isn't authentic, you will definitely find a dish you can dig into for the time you are there. I prefer the lunch time just because you really get so much food for your money.",

But this chinese lady that works there told me that there card machine didnt work. i had like 12-$13 of cash that time and she was charging me almost $20 for a DINNER Buffet! and I'm like WHAT i came in for a lunch buffet, and she was like \"the computer system already change for dinner\" \" i dont know how to change it back so i have to ring you up for a dinner buffet\" and im like are you serious? i even told her why would i even pay for a dinner buffet if i'm not even going to eat any seafood? and she looks at me like Im stupid. C'Mon now DINNER doesnt even start till like 4-5pm. What an IDIOT!  This place is a joke never go here bad customer service and foods are not even that good! i just go there before for the ox tail soup other than that food is a 3/10 in my book!",

Food: So they have the Sirloin Steak and Lamb Chops that you can order. We waited for 30 mins to finally get them, and they were super thin, and super overcooked, nothing like the pictures. lol, they never are.  The buffet itself is pretty decent.  A good variety.  Loved the crab legs.  Loved the shrimp.  Loved the barbecued fish. An okay mongolian barbecue grill, but you're not allowed to put in the sauce yourself, they mix it for you.    Bottom Line: Buffet food is pretty good.  Don't recommend the side Sirloin Steak or the Lamb Chop.  Wished they allowed you to mix your own sauce.  Other than that not a bad deal.",

They charged $12 per person for a weekday lunch, which l later realized was way higher than the regular price they charge walk ins. While most people in my tourist group don't speak English and were foreign tourists, I am not and I for sure didn't want to be treated like an idiot who just paid his bill without asking. No price posted anywhere and front desk even lied to me that $12 is the regular price they charge other customers. I figured out myself later that they included generous tips in this $12 price. As a matter of fact, I did not get any service during my stay and I had to get my own drinks, so why I had to pay tips for missing service? In addition, what made this price fishy is the guy who collected payment at the front desk told me that I have to pay cash or I have to pay additional for tips? Why??? Is it due to the fact that you are trying to report business loss to IRS and \"smartly\" avoid paying tax on this? If there is a way, I would write a letter to IRS and report their suspicious conduct. Needless to say, the food looked and tasted like trash, unwashed and deep fried in dirty oil or mixed with all kinds of MSG. If you are looking for a value meal, don't come here! If you are looking for high quality food, don't come here! If you care about service, don't come here (seemed to me that the front desk did not know English at all). For all means, avoid this buffet at all possibilities, if you don't want to be ripped off and get diarrhea after.",

For sure quality food at a very affordable price. Find a solution for your dirty trays of dishes and maintain your crowded bathroom better and I will award the 5th star!",

With that being said, this buffet offers a decent selection of food, especially seafood items. I also like how they offer a good selection of fruits in the dessert area.

I may go to Urgent Care tomorrow if this doesn't go away.  I had a sense this was a dodgy place but had a craving for seafood and this is close to my place and I didn't want to spend a lot.   Serves me right but never again.  If anybody reading this has the misfortune of having a similar experience, I hope you will go to this Southern Nevada Health District link and file a complaint: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fsouthernnevadahealthdistrict.org%2Ffoodborne%2Ffbi-form.php&s=60f6595444df4d8b207392198588d4862db4654bb742be1d62304585270e6cba\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">southernnevadahealthdist...</a>  Let's work together to make eating out a much safer and enjoyable experience for all of us.

I should have just ate honeydew the whole time because everything else sucked. Don't even bother getting their sushi....it's just California roll with sauce on top or presented differently. Their seafood soup or whatever tasted very fishy. The pineapples looked like they had been sitting out for too long. Idk the food was just a huge mess. I felt like I only ate their veggie tempura, baked sweet potato and honey dew the whole time because everything else sucked. And as for the veggie tempura, it wasn't even good, but it was one of the better food options. Thank god they didn't fail on baking the sweet potato or else idk how and why they are still open.   The service:  We asked for napkins like literally 5 times and the waitresses had attitude. We also asked for hot tea and they put the hot tea in a plastic cup. Wait hold up? Have these waitresses not gone thru some type of food handlers training? Even if they didn't, do they not have common sense? Because you know it's common sense to not put hot drinks in plastic cups. Omg. They need to throw these waitresses back into kindergarten cus clearly they hired dumbasses. They also don't know how to own a business because the customer should always be right. We asked for the hot tea to be poured into a mug, but the waitress said the mug is for coffee only. Like wtf?! Are you stupid? Sigh.",

Otherwise this buffet should be more like $6.99/person and if it was I still will not go back.  Sushi was brown like it had been sitting, crab legs were skinny but okay- the butter for the crab looked and tasted like cooking oil.  Several dishes had no serving utensil,  empty food trays were never refilled and the \"salad\" was a few pieces of browned lettuce floating in a watery pool.  The meat dishes were tough as if reheated,  soda tasted watered down and the restaurant smelled like bathroom cleaner.  I was actually worried I may get sick from the little bit of food I did try.  The servers were nice but I will not be going back.",

Even though it's decent, everything is very salty and dry. Even the fruits tasted dry. There are definitely better buffet places out there than this one, and if we had a choice we would probably skip this place. However, it was our only option on the tour because the guides have to take us to a Chinese buffet as 90% of passengers were Chinese tourists who only want to eat at these types of places.  This place is cash only, but if there is low demand, they take in credit card holders for a fee.  Parking is free and plenty because it is in a plaza with other businesses nearby.",

Not a good entrance, it's too hot inside, and service... well there is no service. Not one person was friendly. Since it was so hot in there it made the food less appealing. Where the sashimi ( raw sushi/ fish ) was, it was hot even under the light and that's a big no no, esp for raw fish. I believe it's frozen as well, not fresh. Idk if I would go back. Sucks, because there's not many buffets like this in Vegas or at least around.",

    "text": "I was debating a while whether this was 1 or 2 stars :/  So tour buses apparently love stopping here. I get that. It's cheap, it's chinese. But there were 4 different tour buses that stopped here the day that we went. And for some odd reason, this place just was not ready. The tour we were on had been doing this same trip once a week for some time as well and had stopped here previously. So it's not like they didn't know a whole bunch of people were about to come in.  And yet, they still weren't ready. We paid our dues and were given a paper w/ a receipt, and someone took us to a table. Since they did not have enough tables for everyone, some families were combined. In the table we were at, with seating for 4, with 5 people sitting in it, there was a box on one of the seats, so only 3 people could actually \"sit\" at that table. After saying good bye to the box, we went to get the food.  Except there wasn't any. I think after my first go, I got a few noodles, some broccoli beef, some veggies, 2 pieces of sushi, and that was about it. I think everything else was just empty.   They also have fruit and apple pie that's not too sweet.  The mushroom with cheese in the middle was one of the better choices that they had, but it took me 3 walkthroughs to get there. It took them til almost the end (45 mins after we had arrived) to fill the sushi section. They had two sections, one of which was completely empty for the longest time. Smh. They have some soups which I didn't try and the rest are chinese foods :P  Plates are either plates that have some dirty stuff on it or plastic plates. utensils are also all plastic. Soda is DIY in the fountain in the back. And it's also kinda dirty :/  If I had gotten a chance to eaten some of the food, maybe a 2 star review? But since I had a very limited meal of almost nothing, I can only rate it on what I had.  Most pictures included with my review were taken after I finished eating...",

Stale, cold and burnt chicken wings, the crab legs were not properly washed and a black residue was on the meat. It appeared, that these dishes were sitting under the heat lamps for more than 4 hours. We politely asked the staff to prepare fresh dishes for us (only a few of the dishes we wished to partake of). They laughed in our faces and advised us \"If you want fresh food, go to a restaurant. Buffets are always this way.\" We then asked for a refund or a discounted rate since we barely touched the food, they were rude and advised us that since we touched the food, we are going to be charged full price for this entire meal. My mother did not even eat ANYTHING at this buffet and she is still being charged for making a plate THAT WAS NOT EATEN.  I am so appalled and disappointed in the food, service and DISGUSTING lack of customer care. I would not recommend this place to ANYONE.   Think AGAIN before you stop here.

Went in for lunch and the selection was pretty limited.  You get what you pay for. The one thing I'm glad they didn't mess up were the fried donuts. Literally filled up on desserts.... The service isn't there and shouldn't expect much, I mean it's a buffet :)  Don't think I'm curious enough to try lunch. Would rather spend that money for a single meal.",

The Mongolian grill section doesn't have much selection to choose from, but it's pretty yummy regardless.  The sushi is surprisingly good for buffet sushi.  Pot stickers are really good.  Pepper steak is excellent.  Orange chicken is decent.  So why only 2 stars?  Well, it's the tour groups.  The place is a madhouse when the tour groups come in.  It's just too crowded to find any sort of comfort.  Not to mention the people on the tour group are frequently rude and shove you and cut in line.  They used to only have tour groups on weekend nights.  They are there all the time now, even weekday lunches.  Not to be racist, but there is a cultural difference that I just can't wrap my head around.  I don't understand visiting a foreign country and eating a bastardized version of food from your homeland.",

The bathrooms are probably the most disgusting but the rest of the place isn't far behind. Bathrooms are used for storage & it looks as if they have never, ever been cleaned. One of the serving tables has a drain that opens into an open drain right in the aisle where customers walk. The food that is put out on the tables is pretty bad too. The sushi is old & dried out. The Mongolian grill wasn't even operating, and the items that were being brought out were overcooked & tasteless.This used to be a decent place to go when it first opened, but now it's a real shithole! No stars for this place, 5 stars if they shut it down!",

I just can't get over how bad this food was...it's making me mad just thinking about the $35 I wasted on this place. The only time I've left an AYCE still HUNGRY. On the way home, I told my husband that I was glad we have multiple bathrooms in our house, because we'll be needing them. He's currently in the bathroom... Again. We almost forgot to write this review, but my husband's diarrhea reminded us. Before you leave, make sure to grab your soggy fortune cookie!!",

The other food ranges from good to mediocre. Just depends on your taste I guess. It's a great lunch spot for me n my coworkers. It's nothing close to gourmet but it will get you full and leave you satisfied. I've never left disappointed. Asian food with a drink for $10 u can't go wrong. Just don't expect too much.",

They have many different varieties to choose from and they are all in their own section. The place was nice, clean, and their food signs really catch your attention. If you're a person who is really hungry and is craving many different kinds of food then I would definitely suggest  this place for you. You can even bring your family if you wish as their buffet prices are very reasonable. I have been here 3 or 4 times already and I have not regretted one of them.",

The ice cream machine was filthy. They had no soup bowls for the soup. They had signs threatening to charge for food left on your plate. Waitresses only approach you to ask you to pay more money if sitting there & lunch tur0H lns to dinner.  They need to be kidding to expect a tip. Maybe hire a waitress thats happy to seen you there.

    "text": "We decided to check out this Buffet at Asia in Henderson, NV when we first visited to Nevada . DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY OR TIME HERE. Upon entering this place not much of the staff spoke english, but they know how to count your money perfectly. There isn't much to write about the decor it's more like junior high cafeteria style wooden tables and small hard uncomfortable wooden chairs. There's a mediocre sushi bar near the front entrance.  The asian style ribs were so over cooked we couldn't eat them. We asked the waitress not to bring our drinks until we had gotten our food. I think the walls pay more attention to what you say then these people. Upon our return to the table there sat our drinks. Of course I requested she make all fresh drinks and watched her pour fresh drinks as well. I am very skeptical about unattended drinks and foods myself. Of course she wasn't very happy with my request and watching her back either. If you love seafood as I do such as fresh unlimited king crabs legs, fried blue claw crabs and fish etc. Now as of 2013 to present. Go to the Buffet @ Asia on Flamingo and Eastern Ave, Las Vegas. My nail technician recommended that place and we love it.   The service is very friendly and the foods are always fresh and hot. There's a very high turn over during dinner hours from 4 pm to 9 pm. The lunch doesn't offer the same menu as the dinner does no king crab legs, fried frog legs, fried crab or pepper shrimp. The price for dinner is $13.95 you leave a tip after you dine. Alcohol drinks are extra but there's unlimited teas and water and Chi tea too. The dessert doesn't offer real ice cream it's just a frozen like iced milk. But they do have a selection of asian desserts cakes and cookies etc. The ribs are tasty but over cooked and dry. The veggies and rice are very good. King crab legs are a good size and plenty of them. But you must watch when they put them out because people grab them two plates full at a time. The atomosphere is relaxed and family friendly. They also have a huge wok station where you can choose your own ingredients too.  By far this is the best one of many of the Bufet @ asia to eat in Vegas. Be sure to dine no later than 8:30 pm because they will begin to clean the buffet to close for the night.",

    "text": "I took my seven year old brother here last night (12/27/10) for a sister-brother date. My dinner was $12.99 and his was $6.99 for the kid's price. We were seated at a booth and went to town - sort of.   Maybe it's just me, but I'd like to see more non-seafood options for dinner. I'm not one to pile a plate 13 inches deep with crab legs and shrimp to chow down. I did like the neon orange honey shrimp and the seafood stuffing, served on a scallop shell, but wished they offered more non-seafood choices.   My little brother tried sushi for the first time (didn't like it) and a frog leg. I told him it was chicken and he said that he liked it until it \"started to taste like seafood.\" He was a big fan of the baby corn in the seafood medley. He was quite worried about cleaning his plate because he saw a sign that said that if food was wasted, there'd be an extra charge. We only took tablespoons of this and that, so it wasn't a problem.   The ice cream machine was out for almost all of dinner. We had the coconut jello which was good, and the rest of the desserts were ok. The candied nuts were decent. When the vanilla ice cream light went on, there was a big line for the ice cream - I got up to help my brother, as I had done the entire night, and our waiter completely cleared our table, like we left! We were seriously 6 ft away! My brother was a little upset because we had been hiding scallop shells in a napkin to take home and they got thrown away so we snuck two more out when we sat back down.  In addition to our table being cleared in the middle of dinner, nobody ever came to ask if we needed refills or anything. We were ignored the entire time by the staff. I had to ask for a water when our plates were cleared because they pretended like we weren't there. We were chewing on ice almost the entire night.   I've had good Asian buffets and bad ones, and this one is about middle of the road in terms of quality. I had to knock it down one star for service.",

The only thing my nephew ate was an ice cream cone!  Everything that I tried was very salty!!  And this is the first buffet that I have been to where they do not give free refill on drinks.  If you're going to do that, at least not make your food so damn salty.  Jeebus!    On top of poo poo food, their service is beyond terrible!  Usually if a place has bad service, the food compensates for it or vice versa but good lord this place lacks both.  I will never ever eat here again.",

Not a big fan of their space because it's very tight and you could barely move about if the place is busy. Their bathroom is the ever typical Asian restaurant bathroom- like no one ever checks up if it is dirty or if the toilets are clogged!   Food is okay- too much mono-sodium if you ask me. Some food are just completely tasteless and dry- like their ribs. Most of food are just okay and filling. I'm a fan of their fried frogs and salt-and-pepper pork.   I've had times where the servers are super attentive and friendly, but there are times where you just get snobby ones. So it depends. Overall, this place is very filling and affordable. Don't forget to try out their $1.99 boba slush- especially the strawberry one!",

The sushi is fresh and there is usually more than just basic California rolls like most other Asian buffets offer.    The staff is always kind and attentive.  They clear plates quickly and my glass is never more than half empty, and I tend to go through tea pretty quickly.   One last comment, my guy and I decided to start a new Christmas tradition this year since I wasn't feeling well enough to cook a fancy dinner on Christmas eve.  I always thought it would be fun to go for Chinese,  a la The Christmas Story.  This buffet was the first place that popped into my head.  Thankfully they were open, although we arrived about 30 mins before they were set to close so we were prepared to have to stuff our faces pretty quickly.  So not the case!  There were quite a few tables of people still.  They were still bringing out fresh food (even up to the time we left, which was after closing time), the staff was still very attentive and never made us feel rushed.  We still weren't the last ones there when we left to a nice season's greeting from all the staff.  I think we have found our Christmas Eve tradition spot for the foreseeable future!!",

We had to wait to be seated and once it was time for us to go through the buffet line it was a mad house. It was so busy that the staff couldn't fill some of the popular items fast enough. The food was ok I wouldn't say it was amazing but it truly is like any other Chinese buffet you go to. The part  that concerned me was the cleanliness of this place. The floors are filthy, there are sticky spots to the floor and the tables felt sticky as well. My sushi roll had a piece of plastic wrapper on it as well. The only thing I would recommend they do is to get on their staff to clean instead of standing around.",

You are lucky if you can land a lousy lobster tail. It's greasy, small, messy, and the portion is horrible. You would think that because they advertise it so much the serving tray would at least be big. Nope.  So if you are looking for a cheap buffet that fills your hunger then ya definitely a go.  Overall : Pros:  1. cheap cheap cheap buffet $14.08 (tax included)  2. Not really a long wait line to get in 3. So so food, service, drinks  Cons; 1. Lobster advertisement is a scam 2.

We walked in and my first thought was wow it smells weird. Then we went to get food and it all looked off. The meat looked grey, REALLY dry and everything else was in a pool of slimey goo.  After we ate the things that we editable we got the bill, it was a whopping 52$ they charged us full price for a 3yr old?!? My husband went to pay and this is where it all went to hell. He asked about it and was told that its 3 feet! What!! If you're 3ft and under you eat free! What a bullshit policy. Why would I pay full price for my kid to push her food around and then say I'm done... I would have cooked. We decided to pay it anyway, when he went up to pay the hostess told him \"SHUT UP, STOP COMPLAINING AND ILL GIVE YOU A DOLLAR OFF\"  So I asked her to get the manager and was told he wasn't there, I asked for a number to call later she threw the business card at me and continued my say hes not here. I was livid at this point so I left and called the number, I talked to 6 diffrent people who just said the same thing before a man picked up that spoke NO ENGLISH! Then he hung up on me. Needless to say I will NEVER be back going back.  Long story short dont go here, bad food worse service!",

Most of the \"hot food\" are kept at a very lukewarm temperature and look like it's been sitting for hours. All the cook vegetables look like mush as they've been heating for so long everything wilted. The meat are a mystery to me as they're all dry and don't resemble beef, chicken or pork.

I didn't argue, but  what gives :/ The dishes change out and seafood items like crab are typically served for dinner. Price for lunch is around $11 and dinner $15. It's worth it if you like Chinese/Japanese food and you're going to eat more than one plate. If not, I'd skip it and just go to China a go go or New York Chinese to satisfy that craving.",

    "text": "My daughters and I love to go to this buffet at lunch.  There are A TON OF SELECTIONS!!!Where else can you get every Asian food imaginable for two and walk out with $10.25 total bill per person (lunch)?  You can easily recognize it because every tour bus stops there and I have never waited more than 2-3 min to get to a table.   It has Mongolian BBQ, FRESH made Sushi, tempura, crab Rangoon, fish, calamari, Kim chi, every type of Asian soup (egg drop, oxtail, sweet/sour) salads,  pizza, a desert bar with ice cream cones.  There is literally something for every Asian food loving palate.   The buffet is fast and easy.  There are two full bars of food that each extend over 40 ft.  I have been back 5 times in the past 6 months.  I recommend it to everyone I meet.     Go there and try everything; including anything that might make you squeamish.  I guarantee you will broaden your food horizon and come away with a new favorite on the casual Asian dining experience.    I have read the other reviews and appreciate the notes on cleanliness.   I have definitely seen an uptick in cleanliness over the last 5 visits.  Cleanliness depends on how late in the day you go.  Bottom line, they turn a lot of tables during the day and the demand is high.  The wait staff is busy.   The wait staff may not be totally conversant in English but they are Always friendly and give you a smile.   Best value for your $$$$  Please always leave a nice tip in cash for the hard working wait staff.",

He was rubbing his face and picking trash of the floor with the same gloves. The food was maybe 1 star. Loved the fried rice but overall not satisfied.  Only gave 2 stars because the waitress was quick and always checking up.just wish they would cook the food better for the people who come here",

They also make steaks made to order, frog legs, Thai tea.  There's not a lot of selection for desserts but who's there for that.

Everything I liked about this place is nonexistent to include cleanlines, run down, greasy, overcooked, not fresh, over all poor, very poor. I have felt this way about this place for about a year now. The last straw is my wife and I throwing up everything we ate shortly after getting home. there are many points I could address about all the food on that buffet but, rather then be so insanely negative, I strongly suggest you protect your health and go else where. Makinos is 100x better in every way and then some. This place needs a serious reality check. I would be embarrassed to work there. I am hoping they lose enough business to shutdown and cleanup, get their act together and then reopen. Until then, they don't exist to me. I have been a loyal customer for far too long. Maybe the rainbow location is better, I will let you know. One star because a rating is required. Zero stars really should be an option.",

    "text": "Well look at me ma!  Cranking out reviews like there is no tomorrow!  Aren't you guys proud of me?  For this review I will be writing about Buffet @ Asia...  I bet you were wondering why I would come here when I'm in Vegas?  1)  I'm the buffet king remember?  It's my duty to check out the land of the buffets and give them a piece of my mind!  2)  We were no where near the strip  3)  They said that they offered Lobsters!!  (For dinner only!)  4)  It's only $8.99 for Lunch!!!  (This price for a buffet in Vegas is awesome!)  So.....  What's good here!  Food!  Many of the hot items were tasty... Sushi wasn't so exciting, but they do have oxtail soup that was super delicious!  Light tasty broth accompanied by meaty oxtails!  Oh boy oh boy!!!  Prices!  Well... if you don't feel like spending $20+ for a strip buffet, here is a delicious alternate!  As for the lobsters.. I missed out... came here for lunch so didn't get a chance to eat lobsters...  So what are the downsides to this place?  - Sort of hard to find... tucked inside a business plaza but hidden away from everything and placed in the corner... - Parking is semi limited.... only about 10-15 spaces out front... otherwise you have to walk... - Decor is very run-down... some torn chairs are very visible.... doesn't put out a good vibe because it seems though that they don't really care about looking pretty for the customers...  Would I go here?  Yes.... for the food, price it's a total yes... but definitely not for the drive or the decor as they both are disappointing...  (the drive would be real far for those staying on the strip...)  But should you ever be in the Henderson area and is literally dying of hunger, I think this place can help!",

Buffet @ Asia delivers on both counts. The floor staff was attentive and efficient, and friendly (and I am as white as whitey can be, so anyone who assumes that they will receive bad service from the 100% Asian staff does so in ignorance).  Sure the place seems a tad run down at first glance, but this is not the case with the food. The selection is enormous, and omg it made me so happy! Everything I tried was absolutely delicious, with only one exception. Just skip the ribs. If you see ribs and think \"Mmmmm.... Ribs.\" Just keep walking. They almost made me choke, and then almost made me puke. This place, although in kind of a weird part of town, is an excellent choice if you love Asian food. It is NOT fancy! But it is awesome :) P.S. The best part is that you wont be hungry 10 minutes later, mostly because you will still be stuffing it in your face! ;) Thank you. - Ken",

    "text": "Unlimited | AYCE steamed crab legs and lobster for a lower price than what I've seen at other buffets?! saaaay whaaat? I'm there!   Disclaimer: Most of my reviews are long and detailed so the best part about this buffet is listed above :-) OH and that lemon fried shrimp. I'm OBSESSED with it. My fave dish here lol!   I won't compare it to Casino buffets, because they don't offer the same items. (and I've frequented a lot of the buffets here in Vegas and Cali) This is more like the Asian buffets I see in California.   I first went here yeaarrss ago, but most recently started to dine here once a week for the last few months. It's a great price for the food selection I can get. Gotta get them gainzzz!   Drinks are not included with the buffet price, BUT they serve LOBSTER and crab for dinner at this location! (Flamingo & Eastern location doesn't serve lobster.)  The lobster with the Asian influenced sauce they cook it in is on point.  Worth trying if you like lobster! Steamed Crab legs (& no sauce) are thicker compared to the other location and refilled each time their low.   There are at least 1-2 workers there checking what's low so the food is restocked immediately and fresh! I usually go on Friday or Saturday nights for dinner. If there's something that you want that they're running low on, JUST ASK. I've seen multiple guests do this and they are quick to get you what want or inform you when it will be out.  Service is friendly and 5 stars every time. We usually get the same waiter but all waiters are friendly and accommodating. We are there weekly so they remember what drinks to get us. Which is nice.   TIP: they do not speak or understand English well but they can get you what you want if you show them :-) with a smile on their faces.   This location isn't as busy as the Flamingo location, that location usually has a line out the door.   They have the usual fountain drinks, alcohol, Asian beers, Thai tea, hot tea, boba tea etc   They generally have the same items each week.  Sometimes they'll change it up with Japanese purple sweet potato, Chinese broccoli, seaweed, etc  My favorite dish is the lemon fried shrimp. It's fried battered shrimp in a lemon sauce. If you love Orange Chicken, you may love this! They don't have this at the Flamingo location. I'm OBSESSED with this dish. I haven't seen it anywhere else.  Stuffed shrimp with a mayo topping is delish. A lot of the seafood items are my go-tos. They also have sushi (decent selection), beef broccoli, pizza, clams, fried crab in shell, fried shrimp, fried noodles, Asian soups, tempura veggies, oysters, a lot of the usual Asian food items, etc  Their salad and veggie options are limited. They do have kimchee (medium to hot spicy level) and Kimchee tofu (not as spicy as the Kim chee), edamame, I always get those when I'm here.   Limited options for dessert but they're not bad, my faves are the almond cookie, coffee cream cake|cake roll.  Check out my photos to see what their selection is like. I added photos of each plate I got.   They also give out calendars in December!   TIP: They charge you at the end of your meal. You will be charged for wasted food. Suggestion: Take a little to taste and if you like it, you can always go back for more ;-) (Which is smart. A great way to not waste food. We already waste so much food in this country.)  2018 Yelp Review #17",

    "text": "So it's been a few years since I've been here and I think it's best I update my review. This place definitely does not deserve a 4. But I also don't think it deserves a 2.   Don't come here looking for fresh sushi or high quality meat. That's just dumb. You're paying $10 for all this food. I'm pretty sure that's how much it costs for one plate at Panda Express. I've always been as adamant about avoiding raw fish here as avoiding the Black Plague. I stick more to the salad bar and cooked foods.    I have stopped eating meat so I was hesitant when my mom tried to bring me here. But to my surprise, it wasn't that hard to find veggie based dishes. Although I'm sure there could've been cross-contact with meat products. But I'm not too anal about that.   Dishes I've found to be good here in the past include: fried rice, BBQ pork, kimchi, seaweed salad (when they have it), chow mein, beef & broccoli, and sesame balls. Can be a hit or miss: veggie tempura, ribs, cooked seafood Def no: pizza, beets, kimchi tofu, soups, and sushi (random side note: one of the rolls had sprinkles on it the last time I went. Wtf?)",

The first thing that I see when walking in was \"Mongolian BBQ\".......need less to say I got super giddy inside 'cuz I love me some Mongolian bbq! For those of you that need a reminder, Mongolian bbq is when you build your own noodles with meat, veggies and sauces. Seeing that this place has Mongolian bbq, is already is a couple stars in my book!   As far as food options they have it all: different types of sushi, beef and broccoli, bbq beef ribs, orange chicken, pot stickers...just everything EXCEPT honey walnut prawns, no honey walnut prawns here, *tears!   Service is cool, our lady server was pretty attentive for having multiple 5 people tables. Cleanliness? Some parts are questionable, but for the main dining area it's okay.",

What they did have was not good. Crispy food was mush, cold food was warm, warm food was cold, seafood was room temperature, the bins of food had that dry skin on top. But the worst part is how dirty everything was. The ice cream machine and the wall behind haven't been cleaned in weeks at least. The floors and walls are grimey. I was sitting at our booth looking around and the more I looked the more grossed out I became. Just sticky filth everywhere. And they charged $20 per person to eat here. I'm usually very forgiving for most places. Check my profile, I'm not sure I've written more than 2-3 reviews, but this place is so dirty and gross I feel offended. I hope dirty dining shuts them down. They deserve it.  Once upon a time it was a decent place. The current owner or manager has no regard for standards or guests.",

It had sushi ( most of them are dry), crab legs ( also dry), some Chinese foods such as broccoli beef, cream cheese shrimp, oxtail soup, etc and all of them were salty. The dinner price was $16.99 which is not a cheap price if we compared with casino buffet such as Palm casino. My advice for everyone is to save your money for other places or just cook at home if you ever decide to go here.",

With most buffets, I expect mediocre service, and some food options on the buffet line to be a little less than fresh or tasty.  However, my recent visit to \"Buffet At Asia\" was one of the worst I ever had.  The service was far below expectation. Our server forgot everything we asked for, and barely came to the table. When he was there, he seems distracted and in a hurry. They were not that busy, and he could be seen chatting often with a friend of his that was also dining.  That could have been permissible had the food been really good, but that was not the case in the slightest.  Not only did they not have many options out at all, almost all of the food was old and dried out. Noting was labeled correctly, so it was difficult to tell what some of the dishes even were.  The few items I did try were \"ok\" at best.  Even the cleanliness of the facilities was something of an opportunity.",

This was probably my least favorite of the Chinese buffets my mom has taken us to the past couple years.  The service was not too bad, but the selection wasn't as good as it could be and the foot just not as tasty.  Some foods seemed to have been sitting there for awhile, therefore, things that should be soft were hard.  It just wasn't as tasty as Krazy Buffet or the ones in the Phx area that we like.  The place had a nice ambiance, though, the tables were a bit high for those people who are shorter.  The taste just didn't make this place appealing to me to go back.  Thankful to my mom who treated us.  It was $13.95 per person for dinner and that included a non-alcoholic drink.",

I don't eat buffet too much and I don't  like buffet at all, but this is the worst buffet  that I ever had.   Everything on the sushi counter taste the same: Kewpie mayonnaise. Customized fresh wok vegetables, meat and noodle smells great, but it tasted bland.  Fried snacks are tasteless and soggy. Fried cheese wrap is disgusting. There is no taste, no flavor and the cheese filling is dry. The rest dishes on the counter is over salted. Everything taste the same, it was all cooked with soy sauce.  Steamed bun/steam cake is edible.  Desserts cake is classic and it's okay. Green jelly is gross. It was sour and bitter, I have no idea what that is and what that suppose to be.  Totally inedible.   This place is even worse than Panda express.  If I had the choice on that day? I will never walk into that place.",

When you walk in and look up on the wall their is a big red sign that says \"3 and under free.\"  When the bill came to the table,   we were charged for our 3 year old.  When we walked up to pay and asked the cashier, she replied that the \"waitress measures her and tells us.\" Huh??  Then she pointed to the wall and pointed at the 3'.   I guess I missed it.  I didn't realize it was 3 \"feet\" and under.  (Which my daughter stood up against their wall and went above the 3 because of her ponytail.). Ya know, because here in AMERICA it's usually the AGE AND UNDER. So when I asked again about the price she made it sound like the waitress had to come over and measure again.  ??  The very rude cashier took my husbands card and swiped it.  When I asked what was going on,  she flipped out, got very loud and  told us we don't have to come back if we don't  want.   We won't.  Very unprofessional.  Go back to your village.",

Since there weren't many diners, they weren't really making anything fresh. I did have have some sushi, some of it looked questionable but the pieces I did try were okay. They do use imitation crab tho. Nothing is labeled so I have no idea what I am eating, which irks me. Cream cheese wontons were cold and had a smidgen of cream cheese in them. I had the hot and sour soup, which had a weird aftertaste. I love crab legs, which they only serve at dinner time, but these were so skinny and small, I could hardly get any meat out of them. I ended up giving up after I had a slimy, mushy mess on the plate in front of me. Our server was kind and attentive, and refilled our drinks frequently. I won't be back.",

The food is quite good which for a buffet is well above average.  The variety is not as good as it used to be.  Fewer Chinese dishes and more meat (chicken, fish, beef or pork) dishes without vegetables.  The Mongolian BBQ in which you choose your ingredients and they cook that for you is still the best deal in the house.  The crab legs, shrimp, octopus, clams and mussels were all good as long as you don't mind having your shrimp and octopus breaded and fried.  Sushi was slightly above average for a buffet and won't compete with any sushi restaurant this side of your local grocery store.  I like the place for what it is, a lot of good food at a reasonable price.  Wait service is poor but I suspect most tips are too.",

They were mostly clean with a few notable aberrations.  2) Limited, gelatinous dessert selection (though I didn't see the ice cream until it was too late).

When the cashier was ringing us up she tried to charge me for 6 adults and I politely reminded her we had 2 kids, she scoffed and told me next time I needed to be ready and have the kids line up next to some height measuring line on the wall. We were then escorted to our table. Our waitress took our drink order, I asked for juice for the little boys and her reply was \" we dont have no juice\". When I asked what drinks they had the waitress said she would just bring them Orange soda. (Whatever, at this point we all just wanted to eat) Overall it was just a mediocre experience. OH I ALMOST FORGOT!!..... When the waitress brought us a refill on our drinks she brought them back in the same glasses that she put her fingers in while carrying them back to get refilled! GROSS!!! The glasses were greasy too! When we asked for new glasses she rolled her eyes and told one of the bussers to get us new drinks.. The dining area wasnt too clean so that says a lot to me about how clean their kitchen may be... I probably wont EVER go back there. SORRY BUFFET @Asia...

The price was really good because it includes drinks also. There were sushi, Mongolian bbq, soups, chinese dishes, salted prawns, fresh fruits and salads.  Yum, must try if you're in the area.",

Its terrible and never be the place to eat and dine.we paid lunch buffet because when we get there its a late lunch and at 3:45 pm they started to serve dinner my husband triednto get lobster and part of the dinner menu becuse they serve it for dinner the server approach him that he is not allowed to get dinner food unless he has to pay $5'more because thats a dinner. Food this is the only place ive known would embarass customer not to eat food they serve it should be specific in their rules when the customer pay so we know but ive know some buffet places that doesnt care what you eat as long as you pay and that skinny asia lady that watches the customer the amount of food. Customer are getting is like an idiot and she should check their restroom instead rather than watching customer while their eating. Very dirty and bad palce to eat with idiot server",

I found out about this place when we were at a friend's house in Henderson.    I feel their selection is just as good, if not better than most buffets.  They have a good selection of food.  Sushi, crab legs, sauteed lobster, mongolian bbq, an assortment of foods from different areas of Asia, and a good dessert bar with a chocolate fountain.  Whenever we go there, we spend hours getting fat.  If you go with me, maybe you can watch the \"Bottomless Pit Experience\" where my friend eats as many plates as he can.  Trust me, you'll love it here.",

So I reluctantly start putting things on my plate, sat down and took a bite of the mayonnaise shrimp, was like eating cream of wheat... mushy. Bit into the Hawaiian short ribs, it was like drinking a 1/4 cup of oil! I instantly grew a pimple. The steamed rice was like it was never cooked... hard like rocks.  And out desperation trying to find SOMETHING that was worth swallowing, I tried this mystery meat because there was no label, it looked like chicken to me... but it wasn't. My wife and son just \"forced\" themselves to eat because she would've felt bad for walking out. At least my son ate enough ice cream to get his money's worth lol. I had them take my price of the bill... will never return",

I asked him where he came from and he said they had dinner at the Buffet @ Asia. I said \" Dude, you stink.... like you've been working in a kitchen all day\".  Ever since that evening, I've never had the desire to dine there. But then a few nights ago when my boyfriend and I were in the area, we decided to give this place a try. We said that if there's a line then we'll move on, but nope, there was no line. It was actually pretty empty inside.   I only tried a few of their items, one of them being the beef and broccoli, and the beef was chewy. The chicken skewer and orange chicken were actually good. They served lobster that night and I took a small piece which only made me want more, it was good. I had a little bit of the pad Thai and it was just OK.  I also tried their donut which wasn't too bad. Not too much flavor, it tasted like fried dough that you would get at a fair.  I think we stayed for about 45 minutes, I was worried if we had stayed longer then I would unintentionally be wearing Buffet Eau de Parfum.",

    "text": "During numerous trips to Vegas, I've frequented the Buffet at Asia on Rainbow Blvd. (My review of that place here: (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/buffet-at-asia-las-vegas-4#hrid:mSPf88mhq76t49Qo-3jtlw\">yelp.com/biz/buffet-at-a...</a>). In the sea of Vegas buffets, Buffet at Asia is one of the best ones in my opinion for Asian food. On my latest Vegas trip however, I got to try for the first time to the Buffet at Asia in the Henderson area.  The setup of this Buffet at Asia is a little bit different from the one on the westside. This one has one long row of food items that starts with a Mongolian wok type cookery. Next up is their sushi items and then this is followed by the soups: wonton, miso and seafood soup. Up next is the traditional Asian buffet food: they have good offerings like egg rolls, egg foo young, orange chicken, chicken skewers, dumplings and veggie tempura. Off to the side is their desserts: some items are orange jello, almond jello, chocolate mousse, frozen yogurt and sesame balls. I like how above the food items are big, bright lights and letters showing the name of the different areas. So very Vegas picturesque ;)  They do offer some food that the Buffet at Asia on Rainbow doesn't have. It was the first time I saw these chicken with cheese wontons that I really liked. I did think however that the selection over at the Buffet at Asia on Rainbow is larger. This branch at Henderson had good food offerings but not as many as the westside location. Nevertheless, the food here is a good and if in you are in Henderson, it's a good place to go to. It's less than $10 and includes a drink!",

Literally, \"Let's take this outside!\" Hot commodity. YES!  - Pay before you eat like a casino buffet.  Items to grab a second time 1. salmon sashimi  2. Lobster - like at a dim sum restaurant 3. Prawns - like at Makinos 4. Crab legs  - Disorganized seating.  - Like most Asians, you come for the seafood. They do have the normal Chinese buffet food and the sushi rolls that no one gets. Fillers.  - No dim sum. No tempura.  - Oysters taste just like the sea...yuck. Good thing they have lemons and chili paste. - Exactly what I expected. Great food, sloppy venue. If you can get over that, then you'll have a wonderful time.  - Full-filling. Cheap. No dates. Family + Bring GM+GF type of place.

One look at the \"sushi\" if you could call it that and I looked at my wife and said \"nope\"! We turn around and reluctantly touch that door again. We then proceeded to the really nice Italian restaurant in the next parking lot over. FYI I've eaten in some pretty sketchy places, super dive taco shops are a favorite of mine but this place?!

It's a mediocre buffet and it's exactly what you expect from a Chinese buffet. You get what you pay for, so I can't really complain that the food was ookay. They had crab legs since it was dinner time and that made up for the other bland choices. The butter tasted like movie popcorn butter and it made me feel weird. They also had raw oysters which were decent, but I prayed before I ate them just in case I would get sick afterwards. Crab rangoons had little to no filling. Everything else from the fried rice, beef with broccoli, wonton soup, etc was bland and so-so.  On the plus side, the staff was super friendly and nice. They refilled our drinks and took old plates away quickly.  Case in point- it's a cheap Chinese buffet.",

I had to ask for it, luckily I had some in my bag. The guy with the sweetener came by 20 min later and reached his arm two inches from my face and took the salt and pepper.  No excuse me or may I take your salt.  The food was the worst it has ever been!  We had not been there in 2 years and will NEVER go back.  We spent $34.00 on crappy food and service!  The only good thing was the cashier, she was very nice!",

    "text": "I went in with my expectations appropriately lowered after reading all the reviews, and you know what?  I wasn't disappointed.  First off, this is a great deal for lunch.  $9 + tip and that includes a drink.  I went in around 3:15 and stayed for the shiftover to \"dinner\" at 3:45 and it was exactly the same thing, with the added benefit of a steak (and something else) cooked to order.  I found that they had a fair range of items; all the staples of fast food Chinese--orange chicken, honey chicken, teriyaki chicken, spare ribs, Mongolian BBQ...plus more.  I wasn't too happy with the actual taste of the choices, but for $9 it can't be beat.    I probably won't be returning, but I don't regret trying it out.  I guess I'd prefer a classic \"around the world\" buffet that includes Asian specialties among others.",

Good prices compared to the buffets at the casinos and the food is really fresh and flavorful. They have a lot of vegetable options, seafood options and meat options. They have a wide range of sushi options and even serve sashimi. The fish is very fresh. Mongolian bbq prepared in front of you, and you get to choose what you want in it. They even have short ribs, which is a first ive ever seen for Mongolian bbq.   I noticed as i was leaving however, that they seated the Asians away from the Non-Asians. haha that was funny.",

    "text": "Ugh.   After passing this location in Henderson numerous times we have finally decided to go there yesterday for the Lunch buffet.  Ugh again!   Plates were dirty.  One after another, after another.  Rice, sauce, etc.  At one time I put 6 dirty dishes off to the side so that no one else would take them.  The floors were absolutely filthy!  My wife and I didn't think this was worth it so we left our food on the table and left.  We made a comment to the lady at the register and she was clearly indifferent to what we said.  I have read that the other locations had good reviews so perhaps one day we may try one of those.  In an area where Chinese Buffets are few and far between it was very disappointing to come across this.",

They didn't went cheap on making sushi, although the rice was not soft and chewy enough.  They got battered fried crab legs and the steam crab legs, which are both very good to me. Other seafood include crawfishes and shrimps and fried frog legs.",

    "text": "Stopped here for their lunch buffet on a cross-country roadtrip.  Lunch for us was 11 dollars per person which covered drinks+tip  Typical asian buffet with eggrolls, dumplings, orange chicken, etc. They have a good selection of foods, with a sushi section(a bit bland) and a made to order Mongolian BBQ section that's covered in your buffet. I didn't notice til the end. However,  desert is lacking with few fruits and ice cream. The food was decent tasting compared to other asian buffets I've been to and the fact that I haven't had stomach problems the whole day means it's on par with ingredidents!   Service there was very sullen, as if workers really disliked being there. Basically, overall gloomy ambiance from them. However, did enjoy the neon signs over the food sections, very Vegas-esque. :]  I was short on time and only had an hour to eat. But for the price vs quality, I think it's a good run for your money if you're looking for an asian buffet in Vegas. Just don't expect superior quality service!",

The ambience was totally disgusting and disordered. The waiters neither respond properly nor recognize the food being served. All together I would advice not to shell out even a penny for this food.",

    "text": "This place kicks butt.  The only negative is that if I eat here more often, I would be a big tub of goo...   Best days are to go on Fridays and Saturday ~ seafood night.  Come early; otherwise, there may be a wait and the food may not be as fresh as late in the night.  Usually, I focused on the crab legs and the oysters.  When it is oysters season, this places rocks!  It has the freshest oysters that we have ever had in Vegas.  By the way, we ate at the Southpointe casino the other day and their oysters like yuck....  As for the crab legs, large and juicy.  Yummy!  Atmosphere -- it is a buffet folks Service -- seems alot of young chinese people ~ probably students.  They do work hard.   Price -- it is about $20.. much better and more affordable than the strip at $35-40 bucks per head...   I love this place.  If I could eat here everyday, it would be awesome... My cholesterol and weight would go through the roof.    Definitely, one of the best in Vegas.",
