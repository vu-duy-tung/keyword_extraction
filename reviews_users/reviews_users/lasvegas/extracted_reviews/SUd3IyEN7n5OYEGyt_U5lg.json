Coming from Los Angeles I really had high expectations for this place to be as good as L.A, as it is hard to find on this side a town a good taco place, so after reading so many reviews we gave it a try and LOVED IT! the tacos are delicious!!!!! Salsas were delicious too! One thing I would probably change was for the meat to be just a little more juicy but besides that it was GREAT!!! this will definitely be our taco place FOR SURE!",

I knew when I walked in it was a special place. Ben greeted me & immediately apologized for the wait. Then a personal introduction & a hand shake at a taco shop at a gas station? That's service. They had several large orders in front of me but I didn't mind the wait as I got to see great fun & fellowship with every customer that came in. My anticipation was building as I smelled the al pastor tacos all the way home. And they did not disappoint nor did the Burrito. This place is a gem & I'll be back. Maybe tomorrow!!!!",

The food is all made fresh, the service is always friendly, the owner is a nice guy who likes to chat people up, and the portions are huge.  They have a large menu with a large variety of things for pretty much anyone, except tamales I believe.  Not the kind of thing you want to eat every day as it is salty as hell, greasy and fatty...but damn it is good when you eat it.  The quesadillas are HUGE, and they are delicious...and the same can be said for most everything else on the menu.  Tacos, mulitas, rolled tacos, burritos, etc, all eaten by me and all great.  The jefe's burrito (I think was the name) with shrimp and chicken and beef was fantastic...and could feed two.  Seriously.  If you look at the prices at first and think...this is kind of expensive for a gas station taco shop...you are wrong.  The food is good quality and fresh made and for what you pay against the amount you get, it is not expensive at all.  I will definitely return.",

We recently moved from the state of Texas and this beat every single one of the taco shops/Mexican places we tried for the past 3 years we were there!!  Very nice people. The lady at the counter was very accommodating to my dietary needs. We ordered burritos and couldn't believe how huge they were!! They use 16\" tortillas and certainly did not cheat ya on filling it up. It was a good thing neither one of us really ate anything earlier that day. Definitely will be a stop for us again. We absolutely loved it and the quality of food as well as the service.",

    "text": "Jefe's Taco Shop is located inside a gas station (currently Stop N Go) and usually has a long line of hungry customers waiting. On my first visit the guy behind the counter asked if it was my first time and when I said yes he introduced himself as an owner, Ben, and gave me a sample of their drinks (horchata, jamaica and limon) which were all good. He then gave me a menu to look over and said to just ask if I had any questions. When I was ready to order, Ben asked for my first and last name so that he could put it in his computer because you get a free meal on your birthday. I knew something seemed off about this because he only asked for my name and not my birthday or phone number. While the idea of offering a free meal to a customers is a nice touch, I can only figure there will be several customers with common names making this confusing. When I went back for a second visit the girl who took my order had to scroll through names to find mine taking longer than it really should for that type of thing. Nice perk that could use some tweaking.   #11 Crispy Rolled Tacos ($8) - You can choose chicken or shredded beef and it comes with cheese and your choice of either sour cream or guacamole and comes with a side of rice and beans. I went with shredded beef and asked for guacamole and sour cream, Ben was nice enough to say he'd not charge me for the sour cream this time. The sour cream personally had an odd taste to me, so I scraped off what I could, but the guacamole was pretty good and I saw them making a big batch of it fresh. There was a good amount of cheese on top and the rolled tacos weren't greasy and tasted great. The rice was average tasting to me however the beans with cheese were really good, so I'd ask for double beans next time. Priced right, tasted good and was filling!   Bean and Cheese Burrito ($4) - Since the beans with the combo meal I had were good it didn't surprise me to like this burrito. It was was bigger than the picture I posted makes it appear and they didn't skimp on beans or cheese. I'd order this again for sure.   Mini Tacos T.J. Style ($6 for 3) - You can chose from chicken, carnitas, asada and al pastor. Ben mentioned the price for this had changed however wasn't updated on the menus yet, so the price might have since changed, but Ben honored the $6 since that's what the menu said and I appreciated that. Just to note... The price is a bit more for lengua. I asked for one each of the chicken, asada and al pastor. The tacos were dressed with cilantro and onion with salsa on the side to add as you prefer. The asada lacked flavor to me however my hubby did have an asada burrito a couple weeks later and when I tried a bite it had good flavor, so maybe I had it on an off day the first time. The chicken was really good and the al pastor had okay flavor once I picked out some of the crispy black bits from the meat. Also I asked for flour tortillas and was told that I could only have corn tortillas for the tacos because the flour ones were for burritos. The corn tortillas came from a bag and as you can see from the pictures I posted they are dry. No bueno.   Mulitas ($6) - You can choose the meat you want, I went with carnitas. This wasn't a mula I am used to, it was really big (worth the money for the amount of meat and cheese) and also really greasy. While they certainly didn't skimp with the meat and cheese, the whole thing was just too greasy for me.   You can place your order online, but on my second visit the line was really insane and the wait was far too long. Yes they make your order fresh however they had a lot of mix-ups that night that was causing the delay. There was a customer who ordered online and they were apparently out of chicken for the tacos she ordered and instead of contacting her to see if she wanted something else they waited for her to show up to ask her about it. The customer ended up placing a whole new order and then someone else that placed an order inside said there food wasn't right when the lady behind the counter opened the food to show them and it had to be remade causing even more of a delay for us waiting customers. On the second visit I waited about 40 minutes and let me tell you seating is limited in the gas station and it gets cramped. There is a few tables/chairs, but as I mentioned it's cramped, so eating inside will just be up to your preference.  This place is highly rated on Yelp. When I redeemed the check in offer for a free drink the owner accepted it with no problem. He then asked if I was going to write a review and gave me his opinion on Yelp and even called some of the reviewers out by name. I was sorta shocked. He wants customers to talk to him about any issues before posting a review. Well, I appreciate him wanting to communicate with customers and make things right, but we still have to write about our honest experience and what happens even if corrected by the owner or not.",

    "text": "So I decided to try this place since it is super close to my house. I went in and decided to order a chorizo breakfast burrito. Since I was a new customer I did receive a free drink which was cool. Looking at the only 2 menus that were in the entire little place, the owner of this restaraunt was talking across the counter to multiple people and didn't bother asking me if I needed help or even recommended anything.  Anyways, I decide what to get and he did tell me it was going to be 15 minutes due to online orders. That was fine with me. But never did I think it was going to be 30 minutes which is what I waited for one simple burrito. Mind you, he did try to accommodate me with an extra add on of sour cream for the wait. Since the kitchen is pretty visible, I watched anxiously for my burrito. Although I did see that the owner/chef was dripping in sweat, dripping down his nose. I kept a close eye on him due to the fact I didn't want his sweat in my burrito. Ew.  Since he offered me sour cream for the long wait, I expected sour cream, right? Nope nothing on the burrito. It was a big portion size but nothing had flavor. Rice was undercooked. Green sauce was okay but tasted like it was a little less watered down from Robertos. Paid $9 for this thing and definitely didn't meet any expectations, sadly. Ate half, threw the rest away.",

Well if you know me, I am always down for Mexican and when I saw this new name I had to check it out! Very glad I did. The girl was sweet and asked me if I was interested in becoming a regular. All they needed was my name. I gave her my name and she right away started addressing me accordingly (no impersonal ma'am or miss, but by my first name). She asked how I found out about their place and let me know that they are all about customer service - which I could absolutely tell. The food was super on point too!!  I ordered adobada fries which comes in two sizes super size =$9 and their bigger one = $12. It was flavorful, the meat was delicious, and it had A LOT of it as well as fries! Not too much beans too which I liked.   Anyways, definitely recommend anyone to try it! It's located inside the Sinclair gas station, so it might be easy to miss.",

We tried to tell you the last time we were there that we noticed a difference in your product. You just talked over us and changed the subject, so we left.   That's why I left the review.  ..........  We have been going here for awhile now, the food was always fantastic and the customer service was great. We liked it so much we stopped going to Roberto's all together.   Unfortunately the last two times we have gone the food seems to have gone down hill. They seem to be using different flour tortillas, the meat seems to be lower quality and the portions have become smaller.   The customer service is still good for the most part but unfortunately the food seems to be slipping.   We have started going back to Roberto's.",

The quality was ok, at par with others in Vegas, but not amazing. Still, we decided to give it another shot and went today. We first tried calling in our order, hoping it would be faster. Sadly, we called 5 times and no answer. So the hubs goes to pick it up. He's prepared to wait about 20 mins or so based on our last experience. He waited 45 minutes for our food! Then when he got home, guess what? My tacos weren't in the bag. Good thing the burritos are huge and we could share, but that's not what I actually wanted or what I paid for. Didn't bother calling because we won't be going back. The food is not good enough for the 45 min we have to wait for it and then to come home and not even have everything we paid/",

Me and the owner Ben chopped it up about how he got started and shared some stories. Best of all he remebers our names. The tacos here are killer and in my opinion the best tacos in Vegas hands down. I've been to tons of taco shops and this has to be best by far. We live 20 miles away from here but I don't have a problem driving here for some real authentic Mexican food. Do your self a favor a try this place out",

I'd definitely come here to satisfy my late night cravings!!",

    "text": "This is hands down the best taco shop in Las Vegas! We lived in San Diego for four years and got used to amazing taco shops on every corner, so coming back to Vegas where all the taco shops are garbage sucked. We had pretty much given up on taco shops until we came here! We knew we were in for something really good or really bad when we saw it was inside the gas station but the second we walked in, it smelled like home. The guy at the register was super nice, and let us know up front it would take awhile since they had a lot ahead of us (you can order online which is magical, we will definitely do that next time). We probably waited about 30 minutes at 7pm on a Friday, which was fine. The second we took our first bite, we knew it was worth every second of the wait. The food is made fresh, and with quality ingredients. Everything was cooked to perfection! We had a carne asada burrito, a pollo asado burrito, and beef rolled tacos. Seriously the best burritos we've had in Vegas. We felt like we were right back home in San Diego!! Highly recommend and we cannot wait to come back!!   Tips - order online first, and have some patience. The food takes time because they're cooking everything fresh!!!",

    "text": "Props to this place to being able to have a ridiculous amount of business for being in a gas station. I've always seen online posts about it but never knew exactly where it was located.  We went specifically for street tacos and we were not disappointed! I guess the owners are from San Diego and have their little flair of cooking style. We each had a carne asada, al pastor, and chicken street tacos. At $2 a taco with a minimum of 3 for the order, it was a steal. The al pastor was soooo good! By far our favorite. The green sauce was so spicy and the red sauce was even spicier! Beware! My tongue was on fire but it was oh so good.  The horchata and the lemon beverages were both delicious. We waited a total of about 35 minutes on a Saturday evening to order and receive our food. Apparently they get a wicked amount of online orders because every time we heard a ding another order came in, and those dings came often! I will definitely come back here again and most likely try to order online to avoid the hassle of hanging out inside a gas station.   Don't let the location trip you up becuas2this place is amazing! Nice to have a good taco place on this side of town!",

The message below from the owner is what's wrong with this place! First, why send me a private message...just put the darn message or whatever you have to say on my review and keep it moving. Secondly, I finally figured out the problem here. His goal is be like Chipotle and continue to whitewash and insult Mexican food. CHIPOTLE ISN'T REAL MEXICAN FOOD!!!! It's a cold, fake COPYCAT!!! He's actually delusional enough to think I was trying to hurt his business instead of taking a customer complaint and FIX his ways! Did I insult your food, NO I insulted how you run your business! BUT DID I LIE? Absolutely NOT! I want you to be successful that is why I left a intelligent truthful review! STOP using your employees as an excuse for your bad practices! And you just started closing on Sunday's and Monday's so don't act like it's been a practice since you opened! And if your goal is to be Chipotle then why is your food higher than theirs? And my TANTRUM as you rudely stated was that you weren't open to serve my daughter and her 10 friends because I been stopped eating your food! You need to grow up! You're running a business but your EGO is running you! I feel like I am talking to a two year old child who can't comprehend basic CUSTOMER SERVICE! And please don't tell me about future trends in the restaurant industry because I am highly qualified in that area! Your reason for having folks pay first is so when you make them wait an hour for FAST FOOD, you already got paid so who cares if they leave! You went into too much personal detail which is what you do when folks come to your place of business! You need to stop it! I am not the only person who has said this to you but you're tone death! Your only response to a concerned customer should've been \"I'm sorry for the inconvenience and I am also sorry for charging more money but you still have to request food with your food! I am also sorry for the bitter red sauce on the enchiladas, and I am sorry for not keeping normal business hours like CHIPOTLE since my goal is to insult Mexican food, remove all the flavor and spice, and serve it cold like CHIPOTLE!\"  BEN THE OWNER: Mrs. Creole thanks for posting your review about Jefe's Taco Shop. Your 1 Star review has brought in so much business that we've been having trouble keeping up. I'm a little bit confused & also sadden about how you feel about us beginning to thrive. I saw that you were VERY irate about us closing for the Holiday weekend. Just about everyone of our regular guests knows that we're closed Sunday's, Monday's, holidays & holiday weekends. You have the right to be upset. We don't believe in & will NEVER open on Sunday's. Maybe in the near future we'll reopen on Mondays. Being closed on Tuesday July 5th was not planned. I had given our main cook the day off since he was going to California to visit his mother & I was to fill in for him. But all hell broke loose when my morning cashier had a family emergency & wasn't able to come in & will no longer be able to work with us anymore. We spent the entire holiday weekend moving closer to work from Henderson. Two 26' foot truck loads & we still didn't finish moving. So I was forced to shut it down on Tuesday.  Originally I was just an investor in the business & wasn't seeing any progress. After evaluating what our food cost was & the portions we give I had to adjust some pricing. We are in business to turn a profit & not slave our teammates like other places do. With  just about 200 5-star reviews on Yelp I believe I'm getting the hang of the restaurant business. I'm definitely not trying to \"reinvent the food wheel\" but perfecting it yes. I don't agree with you about Roberto's being a success. 50 years in business & they  have less than 100 locations I don't think so. I don't believe in having to break just about every labor law & paying minimum wages to turn a profit. Now Chipotle is another story, 23 years in business with 2,066 locations that's impressive. We have crawled, we have walked, & now we're beginning to run. Our online ordering is a game changer. Although you're not happy with having to prepay for your meal it's the future. The next time you visit Panera Bread, Mc Donald's, or Jack in the Box you will see self-help ordering kiosks.  I'm aware of some inconsistency in our food & have been working very hard to correct that. What troubles me Mrs. Creole is that you stated that the quality of our food has dropped drastically but then you threw a tantrum when we weren't open to serve you. If you're in the food service industry yourself please allow 15 minutes of your time & I will be delighted to listen on what you have to say.  Thanks again for posting your review & please accept my sincere apology for not being able to serve you on Tuesday July 5th. Your next meal is on me.  Sincerely,  Ben Robledo",

While at the counter, Manny was speaking with other customers and he quickly replied \"sir, I'll be right with you in a moment.\" This is good customer service right here and the acknowledgment goes a long way. I ended up getting the carne asada/pollo asada tacos and the rolled tacos. They are generous with their portions, fair with their prices and the food is absolutely delicious.   Manny also took the time to offer me one of their beverages and discussed a brief history of the business. They really care about their customers and go out of their way to make you feel at home. The location is inside a gas station so don't let that deter you from giving them a try. I have found my FAVORITE Mexican restaurant in Vegas and I'll definitely be returning. Thank you Manny!",

It was the best Mexican food I've had in my life,none of the other mexican places I've been to don't compare to this one because this was so indescribably good! They also said that if you have straight A's in school, and show them your report card, you get a free burrito, any burrito!! I can't thank them enough for the really great service and food. I'm definitely going back tomorrow!",

Food is great, very reasonably priced.  $50 to feed family of 10.  Very clean.  I love the basic realness of my whole experience there. Jefe's burrito, pollo asada fries, carne asada nachos, carnitas street tacos, rice, beans all seasoned to perfection.  Family devoured all and wanted more!",

They also have some of the best customers service I've ever experienced. They strive at giving you their best both in the taste of their food and their customers service. If you haven't been there yet you are definitely cheating your taste buds!

I don't want to do something knee jerk and ruin their rating. I've been here 4 times now. Each time I have gone with different family members or friends. I've got to say that everything I've had here has been excellent. Everybody else I've taken has really enjoyed the food as well. We've tried probably 80% of the menu and everything is extremely good. Customer service is excellent. They have special Systems set up to remember your past orders. That's really nice. The owner/manager Ben also remembers your name. Also a very nice touch.   The only downsides are 1) it is in a gas station tucked away behind Ann road 2) seating is very limited, and 3) since they are getting more popular and busy sometimes you have to wait a while to get the food.  But now that I think about it the down sides are just more excuse for it being unique and eclectic. Kind of like Tommy's burgers in LA. In short they deserve the 5 stars that they have so far. Take the trip, try to find them and enjoy a great Mexican meal.",

The meat tastes better than other similar restaurants, the quality seems better as well, I don't have to pick out pieces of meat like I do with Roberto's (haven't been back to Roberto's since trying Jefe's). Staff is always friendly and professional. I'll be eating here quite often, definitely one of my faves.",

    "text": "We have been dying to try their food, and finally did. Three times. All three times the food was delicious. Service was just awesome. So why the four stars and not five? Their red and green salsa that you can ask for is just not good at all. It has no depth of flavor and is just plain hot. I am a huge spicy food fan and can eat very spicy levels of food or sauces. I wish the owners of Jefes would sneak over to Algoberto's and try all their salsas in the salsa bar. Not only are they spicy, but you can taste the garlic, onion, and tomatoes in their salsa. It makes it difficult for me to get food at Jefes when there is nothing for me to spice up my burritos and tacos with. I hope the owners read my review and take it to heart. Note: I am from Los Angeles and grew up eating salsa and spicy food daily. So I am very accustomed to spicy food.   Ben R.  I knew you would read my review, because it is very obvious that you care about your business. You are very wise Ben:) FYI, I'm not a fan of green salsa for the most part. The two salsas that I always get at You-Know-Where, is their real deep red salsa, and one that is reddish brown and chunky.",

It was super busy with lots of return customers eating away.  The guy was super friendly, and made sure we were happy with our food.  He even came out to meet and and greet us.  If you want a restaurant, being waited on type of place, don't go..but if you want awesome and authentic Mexican food, with fabulous flavors-go!

I even passed on having Filipino Chicken Adobo last night, even through my mom's adobo is \"the Bomb.\"    As I arrived at the Sinclair gas station based on the directions provided by Yelpers. I was able to locate the shop in reasonable time. There were a few cars in the parking lot that had occupants eating tacos or burritos. I knew that this place had to be worth visiting cause a good portion of the customer were heading or leaving Jefe's inside.   The staff was very friendly and immediately ask me if I found this place through Yelp. I responded with, \"Yes\" with my hungry looking eyes. I ended up getting combo #5 shredded beef tacos with 4 corn tortillas. Every bite was delicious and the beef was seasoned just right with pieces of bell pepper. The corn tortillas were simply delicious and doesn't have that aftertaste of preservatives. Overall a great place to grab delicious Mexican food with great customer service!",

My favorite is their burrito. I always get the al pastor burrito with chicken and it is mouth watering, finger licking delicious. Customer service here is also friendly even though the wait can be lengthy most of the time. It's best to order online ahead of time for pickup. Their limon water (sort of a light lemonade) is also delicious. Definitely recommend this place for any Mexican food lover.",

I walked in at 4:40 and stood there while a female employee told me she would be right with me then went to lazily go clean. Um...Ok?  A white guy came out, super nice and friendly, and asked if I already ordered. I said \"yeah it was an online order for *my name*\". He looked confused, went to the back, and I heard the stove start sizzling. Clearly they forgot because they didn't ask what I ordered, they just ran back to start cooking.  It was over ten minutes later when they had my food ready. However, they said they ran out of the horchata I orderex and were just now making it. Another ten minutes. All of this could have been avoided if they had looked at my online order when they received it hours ahead.  I left with my order around 5. The horchata was so poorly done in a rush, it just tastes like warm water with cinnamon. They even told me to get my own ice in the gas station (not in a mean way but still). I had to throw it away.  This is one of my favorite Mexican places in all of Vegas but about 75% of the time, our online orders are forgotten or barely started at the pick up time, and when we order in house, the wait is about 30 minutes just for food for my husband and I.  I love the food and the owner is a great guy but please please PLEASE pay attention to orders placed or called in ahead because this is done for a reason. We don't have time to come in and wait 15-20 minutes passed the promise ready time. I order pick up a lot at restaurants and stores because it's what I need so when I have to get off and wait 20 minutes, it really does affect my job and my errands.  We continued coming here because the food rocks but this will be my last time. 20 minutes passed, forgotten food, rushed and gross horchata even after I tipped is not okay. And like I said, these delays happen almost all the time I'll find a new spot for Mexican food. Such a shame. :-(",

They are very busy they take orders online which is extremely convenient. The food is extremely fresh and very tasty unlike Roberto's. Great customer service, huge orders and very good food large portions. If you order from here make sure you are hungry because you won't be when you're done very satisfying. The red sauce that I got with my tacos was actually hot spicy and I loved it.   Well yesterday evening I ordered from this business using the online app. I was pleasantly surprised at how easy it was. When I got there my food was ready except they waited until they saw my face to put my toppings on my tacos they didn't want my food to get cold. When I got home I really looked at my food and I could tell it was prepared with love. It looked very good very neat and tasted just as good as it looked. I am now hooked on this business I will become a regular. This is why I have to give this business five stars plus they call me by name when I walked in I like that.  Well I thought I would update my review. I have been a customer of this business I don't even know how long I stop checking in I probably have over 30 visits so I am convinced I made the right decision by choosing never to go to Roberto's again. The quality of their food is outstanding and it's the same cooks consistent also they prepare my food like they're cooking for their family. They all know me so anyone who doesn't want to go there don't like the food don't like the place feel free not to go because there's plenty of us that go there the business has a following I know I see it I'm part of it. One other thing Ben and my girls that work there they don't curse they are a family business. But I do so if you want a five dollar Burrito  in five minutes then take your ass to Roberto's and shut the hell up. Just saying",

    "text": "funny that he keeps deleting this particular post. the negative comments have nothing to do with his food but all about his customer service. I will keep posting it so that people can see. even if I have to do it under a different name. so I've been coming to the taco shop for quite some time now. I would always come into the store but I never tried anything. once I finally did I was HOOKED !! the carne Asada is my favorite. I've tried the al pastor, carnitas, and chicken as well as the mini tacos. none of which I would get again because there are better places in Las Vegas that serve this. although it may be good to some. it's just not for me. as much as I love Jefe's taco shop, I will NO LONGER be returning. Ben the manager/owner insulted my mother because I gave her honest opinion on the mini taco shells. in her opinion they are nasty. people in Las Vegas are used to white corn tortillas. that's all. what really got me is that he told me my mother does not know good food and she eats garbage and cardboard. I listen as he insults the competition around town which is fine but to insult ones mother and to think that it acceptable is NOT OKAY. EVEN when it's in a joking manor. the joked continues to go as I wouldn't allow \"no bad cornbread\" idk if I'm black so cornbread is associated with me. but I don't eat cornbread or soul food or fried chicken to add to the bunch. Already having mixed feelings about the taco shop because I could only go after his wife is no longer working considering she makes me uncomfortable with her level of rudeness. I will be telling everyone I know about my experience as I will not be returning after my mothers and my palette has been insulted.",

Having previously managed for an unnamed burrito place for a couple years I am critical of both service and quality. Manny and Ben exceed in both. Listening to Ben and Manny talk to guests and taking time to explain was great and professionalism on that level is something you just don't see anymore. He did everything to resolve my payment issue and explained what he was doing each step of the way.   It was also great to meet and chat with Manny about the business, their vision, and living in Las Vegas (I am a transplant from WA).  My wife ordered about half the menu and it was all great. We will return.",

I suppose everybody knows by now that it's inside a gas station and there're only a couple of tables. Ben (the owner) is very friendly. Even though it was kinda busy he was taking the time to talk to all the costumers. My wife and I shared the al pastor fries and my daughter had the asada quesadilla. The fries were loaded with meat, very tasty . And my daughter couldn't finish her quesadilla. We are glad we finally stopped by. We are definitely coming back for more. Thanks Ben. You are the man!",

I got 3 Carne adana street tacos with beans and rice for a reasonable $8 even.   Man these tacos!!! Stuffed with meat that's seasoned well topped with your typical onions and cilantro tip that off with some of their super spicy red sauce and you can't lose.   Cool thing jefes offers a rewards program for every $10 you spend you get a $1 back. Also you get a free meal on your birthday. The customer service in this place is freaking awesome. Blanca was nothing but helpful and polite. I'll definitely be stopping in next time I'm in the area. Ohh how I wish jefes was on my side of town.   On a random note had lunch with an older gentlemen named Craig. This spot made my day thanks to Blanca and random guy Craig and amazing tacos!!!",

We sampled the Jamaica drink which was very tasty. Overall it was a wonderful experience. This will be on our top Vegas places to eat.",

The staff is super friendly and a free gift on your birthday  So I got home and went to eat my tacos... I don't eat much especially since I'm trying to lose weight, but... ya know tacos. The mini tacos Ben, the fantastic owner, suggested were PERFECT for me. The minimum order is three and you can mix and match (I did chicken, AL pastor, and Carne asada,  so damn good) and they're perfect I got the rice and beans. The beans don't look like much but holy heck they were good and we'll seasoned. I'm for sure happy with them. Not overly greasy like Roberto's or Don Tortaco. Super fresh. (So people who complain they are closed Sunday and Monday thays because the ingredients are hand chosen and fresh) I'm not displeased at all. The green sauce is the perfect amount of spicy the red is definitely for the more adventurous spicy lovers, but my boyfriend loves it. All 5s from the 2 of us",

I ordered the California burrito and it was HUGE!!  The flavor was amazing and reminded me of the taco shops back home in San Diego.  Come to find out that's where they were from too.  The carne asada was tender with a slight grill flavor. I could only finish half the burrito but it was so delicious that I stuffed the other half down an hour later.

    "text": "Always looking for a new \"authentic\" restaurant for street tacos.  We love small hole in the wall places like Mexican supermarkets or strip mall out of the way cafes and this place fits the bill perfectly.  It's in a gas station which most people would turn their noses up at but don't think for a moment it's like a station that serves hotdogs rolling on a machine with Big Gulps next to it.  This is the real deal.  First time here so we decided on Al Pastor and Carnitas tacos with chips, salsa and guacamole.  The tacos are $2.50 each but LOADED with meat.  Flavorful but the pastor is not how I usually have it which is stickier and sweeter.  Still really good.  The carnitas?  DELICIOUS.  I would have been happy eating a whole plateful of those.  Next time will try the taquitos, carne asada tacos and chile rellenos - if they aren't sold out!  The chips are thick and hot and salty and amazing with the very fresh pico salsa and the guacamole was great.  Another great thing - the food came out HOT.  Which is always a good sign.  Freshly made.   Will definitely be back!!",

The sauces were perfect, but the homemade chips for the chicken nachos STOLE THE SHOW.  They were by far the best chips I have ever had in my life.  Some type of special alchemy going on in those fryers, and yes they fry them right in front or you.    Not to mention the owner, who was there taking the order and training a new employee.  Such a nice man.  So welcoming and wanted nothing to do but please.  Do not let the location in a gas station fool you.  Go in, take a chance and you will be rewarded.",

He is so proud of the food he serves that he will refund you your entire purchase if you are not satisfied one bit.   Yes, it's in a gas station. So what?

    "text": "I used to order from here when they first opened. I'm from LA and was told by the owner this was like back home SoCal Mexican food. It was good, but definitely not like back home. I always ordered the carne asada burrito (at that time was $9). We went a few more times here and there and then we were told the burrito I order was gonna go up to $10 because they were increasing the quality of the meat (or something like that.) I stopped going, I thought $9 was high and I wasn't gonna pay $10. Well this weekend I decided I was gonna give it another try and I called in an order for pickup. I ordered the asada burrito and a kids bean and cheese burrito. When I got there the gal told me my total was $15.75. Blown away at the price I went home and looked at their menu online and discovered their price went up from $10 to $12! And I ordered extra guacamole (+$1.75) so my burrito cost $13.75 and my daughters burrito was $2. Aside from the ridiculous price I have a problem with the burrito itself, although it was huge, it was mostly filled with beans (thick refried beans with no flavor.) There wasn't much guacamole (certainly not enough to justify an extra $1.75) and on their menu online it says it has 12oz of meat, I doubt there was even 4oz in there. Overall huge disappointment. I won't be going back. Gave this two stars as opposed to one because the staff is nice. I'll keep going to Gerardo's across the street or the taco truck on Deer Springs until they put something more authentic on this side of town. Taco Y Taco also has AMAZING al pastor tacos for anyone reading this that enjoys those.   Something else I noticed... it's -$1 for no guacamole but +$1.75 for extra. Their pricing is all jacked up here.   ---------------------------------------------------- 10/26/18 In response to your message Ben, your comment about having a thin wallet was uncalled for. It implied I am cheap and/or broke which I am neither. Mexican food however IS usually on the cheaper side. I don't mind paying top dollar for amazing food, but this wasn't amazing, I wouldn't even call it good.  I just feel the flavor fell short all around, the meat had no flavor and the beans were bland. And it definitely did not have the 12oz of asada your menu claims. If this burrito had been delicious and came with what the menu said I wouldn't have a single complaint over price.  I always pay extra for guacamole so I'm used to that, but there was hardly any in there so yea for an extra $1.75 I'm gonna make mention of it. Instead of trying to justify why your prices are high just concentrate on making better (tastier) food. If you have customers raving about that particular item then I'm sorry to say they have probably never had authentic Mexican food.",

    "text": "I really wanted to love this place and I did.  Jefe's Taco Shop sure gets a lot of Yelp love with a 5 star average.  I admit it.  I was a little skeptical about the reviews, especially since I didn't know many of the Yeeps that reviewed this place.  But then I tried them for myself and Voila!  5 Stars from me too.    5 for 5!  Here are my 5 reasons for giving Jefe's 5 Stars.   1.  The service here is consistent.  You can say it's hit or hit.  Service is awesome.  Ben, the owner, is awesome.  Plus, he's from America's Finest City.  That makes him awesomer.    2.  The Breakfast Burrito:  It's huge and can feed a party of 4.  Or, just one Mel C.  Ben didn't think I can finish a Breakfast Burrito with extra extra meat, an order of rolled tacos, a street taco, and a quesadilla in one sitting.  Guess What?  That's right. I deMELished it.  I was full and wanted to quit.  But when something taste so good, you just don't want to give up.   3.  The Beef Rolled Tacos w/Sour Cream & Cheese:  So good, crispy, tasty, and had a lot of meat.   4.  Price: Everything is priced about right.  Remember, portions are huge.    5.  Home:  Yes, Jefe's reminds me of home. In my opinion, nobody does taco shops as good as the 619.  Jefe's comes pretty damn close.  Bottom line...if I could afford the calories, I'd be here every day.    TIP:  Don't get this place confused with Tacos El Jefe's off Charleston.  Not even close.",

I ordered a AL pastor burrito, and got like 2 pounds of yum pork bliss. Wife ordered Carne asada fries, and they were heavenly as well. None of that garbage meat Robertos and such serve, all high quality meat here. Definitely some of the best mexican food around. If you got food of this quality at a nice seated restaurant, you'd have no qualms about paying twice as much.",

Due to my husband being in the military we have lived all over, not one place could ever compare to San Diego's mexican food. When  we moved to Las Vegas I was so excited because there were taco shops everywhere but still nothing like San Diego. Until now!! This place is the best. There might be a wait... so what. Good food should take time. Try ordering online. This is good old taco shop and in my opinion the best in all of Las Vegas!! Go and try it, you won't be disappointed. Trust me and if for some strange reason you don't like it, well you just don't know good old taco shop.",

They make it fresh right in front of you. However my one complaint is that the chips are too thick. They do an excellent job with the nachos and load them up pretty good but the chips are really thick so if they fix the chips then it would be 5 stars. Also, it is inside a gas station which doesn't feel as clean as you'd like for a restaurant.",

Manny told us it was all cooked San Diego style, which I'll have to take his word on because I haven't been to San Diego to eat yet.  Whatever the explanation is, I'm glad Jefe's is close to home so we can eat here often.  And this is from me, who isn't a big fan of Mexican food. Hubby IS a big fan, and he loves the place also.  In fact, I've never seen him devour refried beans like he did there and going into poetic rhapsody whenever he had to come up for air.  He had a couple of fried tacos and loved them. I had the 3 pork mini tacos and they were so overloaded with meat that I separated the two taco shells and halved the filling into each part so it became six tacos (which was good because Hubby also ate half of my tacos).  We've already been back twice and that's pretty rare for us, we like to always explore and try new stuff. However, sometimes a place is just too good not to return to, and Jefe's is one of those.",

I've never experienced anything like it, especially from a taco shop in a gas station. The owner Ben knew every person that walked in there by name. You can tell he's a great sales person but not shady and genuinely cares about his customers. He has some interesting ideas and I know he'll do great things. Went in for 3 tacos and had a 2 hour conversation with the owner. It's almost like a networking spot. I'm usually not a very social person when meeting new people but this was a great experience and I'm referring everyone I know. Thanks again to Ben and his crew!",

We have tried everything from the most expensive to the cheapest and still can't find anything that comes close to good Mexican food....until now. While only eating tacos (mini street and rolled) we have yet to try the burritos, enchiladas, and rellenos. But judging from the hot sauce, green and red, we won't be disappointed.

We stumbled into this gas station across the street from The Lodge looking for chips and soda, what we found instead was something like an oasis of deliciousness. The aroma wafting out of that busy little kitchen made me drop the Lays and Mountain Dew to investigate further. Thank goodness for Blanca, she explained everything on the menu, suggested some killer items and even mentioned an app. She didn't rush me, wasn't rude or disinterested, Blanca made me feel comfortable ordering. They show you each item as they pack it, write on the boxes so you know what is what without having to guess at your food and even run through the order to ensure nothing is missing. I met Manny, he's what I would describe as a True people person. Manny made a point to greet me, even though he was assisting a customer, was very welcoming and for the first time I felt like a guest and not some number getting food at a random counter in a gas station, can't even say that for the upscale restaurants I've been to! The word I'm looking for is: Genuine. I'm big on customer service and though this place is smaller than small it has incredibly addictive food but the selling point for me personally was the 'above and beyond' service provided by the owners and staff.",

But I wanted to comment on their impeccable honesty and integrity as well.  I submitted an order online and unknowingly overcharged myself by $6.00.   When my wife arrived to pick up the order she was informed of the overcharge and offered sincere apologies and a refund, even though the mistake was technically my fault.  Their honesty gives us yet one more reason to continue to frequent Jefe's and recommend them to anyone who asks us about a great place for Mexican food.",

I dug in and was barely able to finish it along with the rice and beans.  But I can't let good food go to waste...  I wish them the best on their business venture and Ben on his Buick restore.

    "text": "I've lived on Ann Rd for 17 yr and never heard of this place but the reviews were so good thought I'd check it out. Was convenient to order online before I left work and pick it up when I got off the freeway. People should be clear on their reviews though that it is located in the SINCLAIR gas station not the shell which is across the street. I couldn't find them and even went into the shell who said the taco shop is behind them. Well there apparently WAS a taco shop there but they went out of business. The place looked just like they left an hour ago and there wasn't a sign indicating the business name so I thought Jefes closed early or went out of business and I went home, a reasonable mistake under the circumstances.   A few minutes after I get home my phone rings. Guess who? Right, it's Jefes. They have my taco! I quickly realize the mistake but tell him I'm home now, tired from working all week and I'm not going back out. To my surprise he says \"you should have called\". Well I thought you were closed down and didn't think to look up your number... Because you were closed in my mind. Then he says \"well you got an email with all our info when you ordered\" and finally \"I'll delete you from the system then\". I'm thinking \"this is how you talk to new customers?\"  If it were me I'd say \"it's ok man, we'll catch you next time\". I realize he was probably upset that he lost product but it was one single torta and I'm sure this isn't the first time someone couldn't find them. Don't they value a new customer more than a single torta? If they are going to operate out of a gas station they should probably expect to lose a little business due to their location. Plus their yelp profile and even on their website they don't make it clear they are located in the Sinclair station not the shell. If it were me I would make it abundantly clear which gas station they are located in just to minimize the customers they might lose due to being hard to find. Im sure the food is good but due to the bad attitude I won't be trying them again. I haven't missed this place for 17 yr so I don't think I will going forward either.   Jefes also aren't clear on their website they are located in the Sinclair. Due to the difficulties finding them, I would suggest they make it abundantly clear on their website and Yelp where they are. They surely don't want people turning away because they can't find them.",

They also have online ordering too which we will definitely have to try. Because we were first time customers, he gave us free drinks. Nice! We had a mix of Jamaica and limon that he recommended. It was awesome.   I ordered 2 chicken tacos and the hubs had an enchilada and beef taco. Our orders came with rice. After reading so many positive reviews, I was hopeful about how the food would taste. Let me tell you, it did not disappoint! The flavors were great! My crispy taco's chicken was juicy and tender and the side of rice had a nice great taste. Seasoned just right. You can smell the delicious aromas when you walk in the place and when I opened my takeout box at home, the aroma escaping brought me back to my grandma's house. The hubs really loved his too. He really liked the flavor of the enchilada sauce. And the red hot sauce Ben gave us was the best!  We will definitely be returning here from now on. I'm looking forward to trying the rest of the menu!  Great job Ben! This is great tasting flavorful SD Mexican food done right!",

They layer the meat and cheese which is nice instead of just dumping it on top, and the pastor is charred all around the edges  2. Chicken fajita combo - huge portion, probably enough for two meals, and the chicken was super juicy with great seasoning  3. Chorizo breakfast burrito - better than Roberto's and I'm a big fan of breakfast burritos at Roberto's...the burrito was gigantic, probably equivalent to two burritos at most other places.    Everything was awesome and their prices include tax.  $25 was the total for what must have been 6-7 pounds of food.",

Thinking about even that extra tortilla end is only one example of this place's care for their product and customers. We have had all except the vegetarian and the cabeza/lengua. - The A la diabla was a little hot for my husband.  I haven't had breakfast here yet because I'm not exactly a morning kind of girl but I have eaten about half of the rest of the menu. So here goes...The tamale sauce is great! The asada fries are on point, I have had all the soft tacos besides cabeza and lengua and they are awesome. The pollo asada changa is yum, I love the horchata, the mulitas are good as well.   The service is awesome. These guys want to go the distance, and deserve to! Order ahead and know the hours. :) It's in a gas station so we order to go.",

I hadn't seen Paul W. in quite some time so, no matter where we dined, it was going to be a pleasant evening. My Yelp mentor is a regular at this place, so when he recommended it I was all in.  Jefe's isn't going to win any awards for location or atmosphere, but don't let that fool you. The food was outstanding. Mexican food at a gas station? What??? You betcha! There is a small dining area if you want to dine in, which is what I recommend.   I got Carne Asada chips, which quite possibly could've been the best ones I've ever had in the Vegas area. Ben definitely didn't skimp when he put these together. I can't comment on the price as I never looked at the menu and Paul W. picked up the tab. I also got a side of refried beans which, just like the Carne Asada chips, were outstanding. PW devoured a California burrito, which could've been the biggest burrito I've ever seen.   I will definitely be back and try to make my way through the menu at Jefe's. If you are in the mood for good Mexican food, it's well worth the drive from anywhere in the Vegas area to the 95 and Ann Road.",

The food, and service might have been better if the cooks mind was not at home already.

I hesitate to write bad reviews but as a first time customer, not a good experience. I usually go back again, and give it another try, but your reply to my first review showed me that there is no need to. Family, employees, and customers should not have an order of importance. YOU TREAT EVERYONE LIKE FAMILY! Sorry if you feel this is throwing your business under the bus but I hope everything improves to make a better experience for the next customer.

(I surely was not aware that after hours means you are no longer a reflection of your business). Anywho, proceeded to look over the menu and ordered.   Food was ok, wasn't life changing.

We just adore the owners and have always had great customer service despite the place always being busy. Well lately the owner is not present. There are now young folks always working. Well yesterday was our disappointing attempt at placing a phone order to avoid waiting in the establishment. I got a girl who answered and said she could not take phone orders because \"they were too busy\"  I understand it was a Friday night, every place is busy. I just wish we hadn't been turned away like that. How about, we are running an hour behind, we can get to your order then.. would you still like to place your order? Something a lil more customer service like. Now I just feel put off and unwelcomed. Very opposite of what the owner had built up for a family like, everyone is welcome kinda vibe. Just too",

    "text": "Since our move to Las Vegas last January 2017, my wife and I have been looking for a place that made tacos like our favorite place back home in southern CA.  After many horrible experiences in town, we read the reviews for Jefe's Taco Shop and thought we'd give it a try.  My wife is a stickler for cleanliness in a food facility having worked for an Environmental Health Services program in CA and she was surprised at how clean Ben's facility was kept, especially since it is located inside a gas station.  From our very first visit, Ben made us feel right at home.  We've been back several times and each time we are greeted by our names and treated like we are family.  How he is able to remember all of his customers names is beyond me but he does.  The food is always delicious and well worth the wait if you forget to place your order in advance.  This business gets our highest recommendation so if you're looking for great Mexican food at reasonable prices, Jefe's is your place!",

    "text": "Update: 6/7/17: It's been a while since I've been here, longer since updating my review.  My staple here is the Carne Asada Street Tacos @$2.50ea, minimum 3ea order.  I ask for the rice and beans on the side.  Ben's dedication to keeping service personal and focus on customer name recognition has not wavered since my first visit.  I even overheard a customer on her 2nd visit here note that his \"charm\" is what won her over.  For me it puts the place above and beyond, but it's the food that inspires me to return and rave about this place over and over again.  It's a 15-20min drive back home from here, and I always order takeout, and Ben and Co have not forgotten to keep the cilantro and onions on the side to keep them crisp when I finally add them to my tacos at home.  Attention to those minute details after all this time is why their 5 Star rating remains over time with me!    Update: 4/4/16: I've been to Jefe's three times since my original review.  I've had the Tacos Al Pastor, which were good, but I still like 'em off the spit/rotisserie.  The Carne Asada Mini Tacos are my staple, and now Ben is using corn tortillas from San Diego, which have better stone ground corn taste as evident from their much more golden tone than their LV counterparts.  Last visit, I took home the red sauce and really wasn't feeling it, but probably because I'm such a salsa verde fan, and even expressed my preference for pollo con chili verde tamales above anything else.  Not everything has gone right when I visited, but Ben has always been up front, honest, and on point with what's going on in the kitchen, so I'll give a pass for those minute issues because of their commitment to customer service.   Ben has mentioned that their long range plan is to have a sit down location; we can all hope that happens in the very near future, and continue to support his efforts by patronizing this shop.  Lastly, all the prices INCLUDE TAX, so it's nice that you're dealing with round numbers and not having to scrap for change.  Original Post on 2/21/16: Living in Aliante and being a SoCal Native at heart, it's always a chore to have to drive out to Eastern, Bonanza, Charleston or Losee to get my street taco fix, so when I heard about Jefe's, had to check it out.  It's located inside the Sinclair Gas Station where Tenaya becomes Sky Pointe Drive.  Kept it simple, 3 Carne Asada Tacos to go with Salsa Verde on the side.  Ben the Owner was at the counter, took my name, my order and also gave me insight into their cooking and serving preferences.  Took his recommendation to pair it with rice and refried beans on the side, and a Horchata.  Since it was my first visit, the drink was free, and so were the rice and beans.  I asked him to keep the Salsa Verde and Onions/Cilantro on the side because I was taking the tacos to go, and didn't want them to get soggy on the 10 or so minute drive home, but really should have just taken them the way they prepare them to go, if different.  Bottom line: the tacos were great!  A good amount of meat, and they held up great from the drive (see before and after pics).  The beef was juicy and had some good back flavor to it.  The onions were fresh and had a kick without being overbearing, and a squeeze of lime blended  fine.  So fine in fact that I put the Horchata in the fridge and washed these flavorful tacos with a bottle of Stella instead.  Now the 5 Stars is for the Food and Service!  And I wasn't the anomaly either, as 3 other sets of customers got the same attention from Ben as well.  It's not really conducive for dine in meals, with only two tables and 8 chairs, but don't let that keep you from coming in and getting good food with great service!",

For food coming out of a has station this place is PHENOMENAL! We've had carne asada fries, California burrito, chorizo burrito, jefe burrito and their rolled tacos and it is all consistently delicious. The portions are very generous even for a guy my size (280 lbs of twisted steel and sex appeal) I got full, like stuffed off a burrito and some fries.

However, I feel they made a mistake raising their prices shortly after opening. It's too expensive for a lunch now.  Being in a gas station gives low overhead costs so it seems greedy to have higher prices than others that pay thousands a month for a storefront. With the larger portions but with low rent, they should be in the same price range. I quit going there because of the high prices. $10 for a burrito is what you would pay in a sit down nice restaurant, not a gas station. Go back to Robertos and Gerardos prices and I will definitely be back!",

I feel like the meat tasted like the grill hadn't been cleaned in a while, or maybe it's just really old. Beans weren't great, but maybe my expectations are too high, as my favorite are my grandmas. Either way, the line was insanely long, for how average the food was. I traveled a bit to try it as well. I'm from Chicago, and I've had better Mexican food here. I don't like when owners are really high on their Yelp page either. The guy, Ben, seemed to want to assure people spoke to him before they posted on Yelp. I don't like that. You can make something right, but a review is a review, and it's based on first impressions. Mine wasn't great, but it seems like he's able to convince everyone else to talk to him before posting, as they have almost no bad reviews.",

I ordered the 12 rolled tacos for my kids...thinking they were going to be skimpy and they would need to eat 6 each. These were very nice sized and my kids left 6 in the box. The chicken was so good inside the taquitos! I'm weary with a lot of Mexican food places and their chicken. It always tastes weird but this was on point!!! So I ordered the carnitas chimichanga. When I tell you I got through 1/3 of this thing before I felt like I was gonna pass out. This thing is HUGE!!!!!!  It is fillllllllllllllled with carnitas and beans and cheese...but mostly carnitas! HOOOOOOMYYYYYGAWD so good!!!!!!!!!  Please be aware... when I tell you its huge....its HUGE! So be prepared. I also ordered fries...and I shouldn't have but they were good too. Overall I spent about 30.00 but obviously this was worth it because I'm gonna pop that chimichanga in the toaster oven tomorrow for my lunch and be in heaven all over again. I met the Jefe, Ben, tonight and what a cool dude! I got a free drink because it was my first visit! The female cook and the younger guy at the register were soooooo nice and accommodating.

Well In the last year I have ate at probably a dozen taquerias in town and had home cooked Mexican food (perks of dating a Mexican).  I wanted to just hear the speel to see where their heart was at.  It's in the food!    Tortilla lightly cooked for that texture you need.  Street tacos are simple enough, meat onions and cilantro.  The carne was well seasoned and marinated.  Adoba was great.  Even some of the sweetness was still in it.  Nice and blackened for that crunch.  They use lard which does make a difference.  That is an important quality in any Mexican kitchen.  Only thing to say is the red sauce was amazingly hot... Manny did not lie.  It is a straight chili sauce so don't pour it everywhere thinking it's Taco Bell.    Closest to eating my fiancee cooking without asking her to do so.  Keep it up.  Mr. Roberto will be happy to see the legacy continue.",

The Carne Asada burrito was huge, delicious, with filled with very high quality meat(unlike other taco joints). There are only two tables, and while they were available, I opted to take my meal to go. The prices were very affordable, and you can tell how much Benny cares about his business, his employees and his customer's happiness. Trust me, go eat Jefe's Taco Shop. As for me, I'll be back tomorrow!!!! I can't wait to try more of the menu!!!   Update...so it breaks my wife and I's hearts that Jefe's has closed shop. If we had known we would have stocked up as well. I really hope they open up some sort of location in the near future and wish only the best to Ben and the whole staff. We are already jonseing for the best tacos in Las Vegas.",

    "text": "The world is a sadder place now that this place is closed. This has been my favorite place to get food for over two years now.  I never would have imagined that a gas station taco shop could be so good, but this place was truly a hidden gem. And not only for their food.   The owner and other staff are so personable and welcoming. From day one they've made me feel like family and they even added a no shrimp option for me on their menu. (I'm vegetarian) I've grown to love them all dearly.   When I see bad reviews, I am highly skeptical (of the reviewer, not the business being reviewed.) Having worked in customer service for most of my adult life, I know that you can not take those reviews at face value. It's usually a misunderstanding, an uncontrollable issue, and often times the review says more about the reviewer.   For example, yes, sometimes it takes a little while to get food here. The portions are generous and it is authentic Mexican food. This place takes their time to make sure you're getting your meal cooked to perfection. If you want your food to be ready 5 seconds after you place the order, you should probably just go to Roberto's and order a bland, cheaply made burrito there.  Jefe's counters this problem with online ordering. You can place your order. And they will tell you when it's ready so you can go pick it up.   This place takes customer service to a new level. Offering refunds/free meals if they make a mistake with your order. They are human after all.  There's no reason that this place should have bad reviews. People in customer service do not owe you anything. If you go somewhere with an \"impossible to please\" attitude (all of these people don't have any good reviews on their profiles), then you can't really be mad when someone tells it like it is back to you.   Anyways, I hope that if/when this place comes back that people will read this before they read the nasty reviews below and give this place a try. Everyone should get to experience the warm and fuzzies that this little taco shop has brought to my life and the lives of their other loyal customers.   I'm writing this as I sob into one of the burritos I stocked up on the day before they closed. (Only half kidding)",

    "text": "You never know what you can find inside a gas station convenience store... Located in the very back of the store here is a real gem for authentic Mexican food.   Don't expect anything fancy here.  What you can expect is a darn good authentic Mexican food, (yes, of course, they use manteca, which is lard in Spanish, and is the only way to make True authentic Mexican food, IMO), expedient service and a clean and casual place to enjoy your food, should you care to eat inside.    Since my first visit, I've had a chance to try a few more items, and it's one of my favorite places to stop for road food on the go.  Or sometimes I end up enjoying my food on the few tables that are available.    You can't go wrong with the hard shell tacos, with shells that are perfectly fried. I always get these, and they come with fresh toppings, like freshly shredded cheese.  My new favorite now are their taquitos.  Unlike most places that fry their taquitos in advance, mine were fried to order and were some of the best I've had.  It's so nice to have taquitos without that dry and hardened interior.  The meat inside my taquito was super moist.  If you have Mexican food often, you know how difficult this is it find.  The chips (thicker kind) were also fried to order, and I requested them fried without any salt, and they kindly obliged.    There's also a fun game you can play here.  Look up and you'll see 3 different screens with changing photos of food items they serve.  Just snap a photo when you see 3 pictures that match (i.e., three tacos, three nachos, etc.)  and you get that food item for free!  Now, you can't stay for hours trying to see the match come up.  It's intended for you to try and win as you wait for your order.  I won the carne asada fries, which I hope to redeem very soon. Mmmm...  Believe it or not, I drive about 20 minutes out of my way to North Las Vegas just to come to Jeffe's, and I don't even buy any gas at the gas station here!  I come strictly for the food.  You should too!",

    "text": "Honestly I didn't know what to expect, other than this came as a recommendation. Im always on the hunt for authentic food. I have family from down south, plus my other heritage. Including El Paso, Juarez, Oaxaca... that being said, I know what it is supposed to truly taste like.   In this economy food usually is made for masses, which simplifies it down and removes some of the authenticity so all can enjoy. This establishment did not do that at all. This was very authentic San Diego/ Tijuana style. Very refreshing to actually have this.   It is located in a petrol station. But when you come in there is a seating area if you want to dine in or carry out. My thought was quick bite in, then leave. Well that didn't happen, what was supposed to be a quick bite turned into me wanting to finish my food.   Ben the owner and his daughter were on point with being personable and very accommodating. It is nice when you see companies that are actually family owned and operated. There was alot of pride in the food and service. Ben interacted with all of the customers and gets to know you by name.   I got the Al Pastor, Carnitas, and Carne Asada tacos with beans and rice. Truly did not disappoint.   I will be back. So much other good to try. I hope he add Mole to the menu.   Location is Ann/95 - plenty of parking - they are closed Sundays and Mondays.",

    "text": "So I actually came upon this place because of yelp! I noticed they have great reviews so even though it's about a 30 minute drive from my house, I decided to check it out. I drove past it a couple times because you'd be shocked to find out it is located in a gas station. When we walked in, Ben (the owner) was at the tables chatting it up with each guest sitting down and eating. I believe the restaurant is family run because I think his daughter was the one to take our order. She was super sweet and also gave us extra hot sauce (red). We ordered cabeza (beef cheek/head) burritos and carne asada quesadillas. OH MY GOSH, YOU GUYS.... it is freaking, unbelievably delicious. First of all, the portions are HUGE. We barely finished our burritos, and I can eat! We took our quesadillas home.. it was jussst as delicious heated up on a pan! The hot sauce is the boss. It makes you sweat while you eat it cause it's so spicy but it's soo addicting! We got to chatting with Ben and he is such a sweet and inspirational guy. He truly has a passion for what he does. Although it is a little bit pricier, the quality is absolutely monumental. This is hands down my new FAVORITE place for Mexican in town. We've been back a couple times since. I am on a strict 6 week diet and I think about that cabeza burrito often. As soon as I'm free to, I'm going to make my way over to that gas station, with a gem of restaurant",

    "text": "Burrito lovers, if you want a big time burrito, Jefe's Taco Shop is a must. True authentic Mexican style food located inside a small gas station in the Northern Las Vegas area, distanced far away from The Strip. First off, I must mention on their customer service which is an A+. The staff here were so friendly chatty (huge difference from annoying chatty), they really know how to greet/treat their customers. Once arrived, they were having some kitchen issues and said it'd be another 45 minutes to an hour until their grill would be back up and running. After driving 35 minutes for this special burrito, I along with Jefe's friendly staff convinced myself that it would be worth the wait, and worth the wait it was. I parked it down at a tiny table inside the gas station and waited with free beverages on them due to the inconvenience/wait. They did a great job of hyping up my burrito as well, not that I needed it l because I had just finished working out and felt quite famished. I went big and ordered Jefe's Burrito consisting of - shrimp, carne asada, pollo asado, guacamole, sour cream, and salsa fresca. You may add rice + beans to any burrito at no extra charge. Boy, was thing big time. Easily one of the best burritos I've ever received. Hot and juicy, all three forms of protein + the guacamole were a great blend inside the warm toasty tortilla. To top off the entire experience, I even got to meet Jefe, the owner, who brought my burrito out to me. Awesome guy with a good sense of humor. Not only was the food wonderful, but the staff/service as well makes you want to re-visit. I must try their tacos next. If you ever want a satisfying burrito with some good local company and don't mind being inside a low-key gas station, Jefe's won't disappoint. Insider tip: They have three flat screen TV's displaying their menu items directly above their cash register. If all three TV Screens match and show the same menu item picture (if all planets align), you get a free meal of your choice. Jackpot!",

    "text": "If you were ever a watcher of the sitcom \"Seinfeld\" back in the day, you may remember a notoriously funny episode involving \"The Soup Nazi.\" If you haven't seen it, you might go and dig it out.  (Sixth episode of Season 7, 1995--yeah, that far back).  It's hilarious because it involves a perfectionistic artisanal soup stand owner who obsesses about his customers' ordering procedure.  If they get it wrong, it's \"NO SOUP FOR YOU!\" (By the way, it's based on an actual guy who still sells soup in New York City).  This is what came to mind when I read some of the responses by the owner to some Yelpers (not many) who visited this Taco shop, and left less than stellar reviews.  To be clear, usually when I read \"snarky\" responses by owners to reviewers, I am annoyed, or I cringe.  I feel the owners almost always go wrong when they argue with customers, especially dissatisfied ones.  (Although there is no pleasing some people).  But with El Jefe, I always grinned with delight reading his comments.  (Sorry, fellow Yelpers who might have been on the receiving end of snark!).  I thought the owner's fierce defense of his food and way of running his shop was wonderfully idiosyncratic and passionate--and I decided that I HAD TO GO SEE FOR MYSELF! I know that is a rather perverse reason to visit an eatery, but so be it. My sojourn took a while because Jefe's is seriously on the other side of town from me.  But I made it there this week.  I think for a taco shop inside a petrol station in a blue-collar neighborhood, this is as good as it gets.  I don't want to mislead you...it's not Bobby Flay getting down on Mexican cuisine.  El Jefe won't garner the attention of the Michelin committee.  But I sometimes feel we are unfair when we compare the efforts of Mom & Pop restauranteurs to fine dining establishments.  It's apples and oranges; or Aston Martins and Kia Stingers.  They both excel in what they do.  And here what our lovable \"Taco Nazi\" does is excel in providing Mexican street and comfort food to locals in a surprisingly clean and tidy environment, at an affordable price, with an endearing and folksy \"front of house\" service.  The owner truly seemed to know everyone by name, and was calling us by our names before we left.  The people working alongside him seem like genuine, down-to-earth people who see you as a potential new friend, and not just a customer.  A lot of folks seem to be regulars here, but it is not going to make you feel, as a newcomer, out of place.  The carnitas, al pastor, and carne asada taco combination that I selected (on the recommendation of a Yelp review) tasted simple, homey, fresh, balanced, authentic, and began to \"sing\" with the accompaniment of the green and red salsas that were provided on the table.  (Yes, there are little square wooden tables, with metal chairs--there is table service in the gas station, yes, indeed.  And our host provided us with an electric candle light during the day! Which we loved!!!  A stroke of ingenuity and kitsch charm).    The rice and beans were really a standout for me--and are generally my favorite thing anywhere.  No canned taste! I tried the \"mulitas,\" something I had never had before despite my veteran status of Mexican food eating.  Basically, if I had to describe it: \"Cheesy tortilla sandwich.\" And yes, it is something to write home about.  Warm, satisfying, piquant, earthy flavor.  You don't want to stop eating this.  The chips and guacamole are rustic and hearty, thicker than I have ever had.  The guacamole was some of the smoothest and creamiest.  I wasn't as much of fan of the string beef with green peppers (which I think is an acquired taste), but it still impressed me with the fresh, uncomplicated nature of the flavor and presentation.  It could be that I was already at the end of my gullet at the time I tasted it.  I'm willing to give it another chance.  Actually, I'm willing to try anything or everything on the menu.  El Jefe is not going to get you to scorn your grandma's cooking from Oaxaca, BUT, Rubio's and Roberto's this is not.",

What I also liked about the experience was the guidance that Ben was showing his new employee as I was his first customer he rang up. The tacos were the best I've had since moving to Vegas. I definitely will be back and I have already recommended Jefe's Taco Shop to my friends.   Cheers",

That all went away while waiting an hour plus for my order and being told that it took that long because they had a phone order. And having customers who ordered after me get their food before me. I honestly think they forgot my order and tried to cover it up by saying it took that long because of a phone order. Food was ok. Same as all the other cheap Mexican places. The wait ruined my experience.",

Lately every time I go and order everything is just Meh (super average/basic) The meat quality is on the same level as Robertos and it lacks flavor. The new corn tortillas are dry and pretty much disgusting. The last time I ordered the carnitas the meat was dry and pretty gross. Personally I don't like thr Al Pastor or thr chicken here but that's just my opinion and the shrimp doesn't taste fresh. The prices keep going up yet the quality is going down. The breakfast burrtito was flavorless and really needed salt. The rolled tacos are still amazing. Now on to the customer service. The owner is quite frankly rude. At first his over talkative ways were funny but he talks ENTIRELY to much. He's rude and disrespectful to other businesses. He makes rude comments and his jokes are borderline racist. He doesn't know how to run a business. He makes you not want to go in and wait because you know it's going to take FOREVER and you have to listen to him tell the same tired ass jokes and bash the same places over and over again. Sigh....get new material please. 6 months ago this would've been a 5 star review. Now I'm only giving 2 because there's still a few redeeming qualities",

They never answer the phone and insist that you use their app or online ordering.  I'm not a fan of ordering on the app or online because I like to pay for cash for everything and don't want to hook up a debit/credit card.  Also when you pick up your order the owner is a little annoying and tells the same jokes every time you go in.  The Roberto's taco shop joke is not funny.  He is also a little pushy and has an attitude.  His business does well and his food is good quality for the price point. Highly recommend the food  especially the green hot sauce.  But don't get your hopes up for a \"Soft around the edges\" conversationalist.  Also nothing vegetarian here...beans are made with lard.  (Again, his joke is something along the lines of he's not in the \"business of making healthy food...\" or he is in the process of doing it...)  Either way, it would be nice to have a veggie option.",

After tasting the food and talking with Ben the owner, I truly feel that I've gone from fast food guy to a connoisseur of great Mexican food. Let me just say that I now know that Jefe's does not use the cheapest beef on sale, but rather certified angus beef that makes a huge difference. Sure the prices are higher, but the flavor and the sizes will get you hooked.  I can go and on, but if you judge with your taste buds....AND just feel the ambience and customer service provided... YOU WILL NOT GO TO ANY OTHER TACO SHOP IN VEGAS!!!!",

It is an odd spot to have a food joint, when you look at the menu it does look like they over price their food but when you get it it is definitely worth it. The fill up their tacos, their salsas are bomb but spicy, portions are really good.",

When I arrived I was a bit surprised (shows how well I read things on Yelp) that they were in a gas station and while I was a bit taken back by that I do remember some of the best food I've had in cities like Austin come from the backs of random gas stations.  My wife ordered a couple tacos and I ordered the Jefe burrito. All I can say is WOW, this is probably the greatest thing I have ever put in my mouth.  Food was delicious and the service was friendly. Definitely a place you do take out from unless you want to sit in a gas station and eat but they also have convenient online ordering. I will definately return to Jefe's.",

    "text": "Let me pre-warn you about the sheer size of the burrito!  Prepare for the ever satisfying food coma!!  After hearing my parents (Perreira Family) rave about this place, I was finally able to try it out when I was in town for the holidays.  Ordered the carne asada burrito.  Normally I would omit the pico de gallo from burritos, but I decided to try this as they served it.  I was not disappointed!!  The meat had a great tangy flavor with a nice char.  Pico de gallo and guacamole was fresh and the veggies had a great snap to it.  This was all balanced out with the spanish rice and refried beans.  Insider tip, after each bite, squeeze a bit of lime and pour a touch of red or green salsa.  Before indulging, I busted out the kitchen scale.  This behemoth tipped the scale at a whopping 1lb10oz.  Halfway through, my arm was getting tired of hoisting this massive burrito.  It was really starting to hit me that I was full!  But I would not surrender!  I had to conquer this food challenge before me.  I pressed forward.  Finally made it to the final couple bites.  While holding the burrito vertical, all the juices from the meat as well as the lime juice settled at the bottom.  Upon biting into the bottom row, the flood gates of the Flavortown Dam opened up!  It now became a race against time to finish the bottom before all the juices ran out.  I caught my 2nd wind and pushed through to the end!  I then rolled away from the table and onto the couch where I promptly fell asleep!",

He gave us a brief run down of the restaurant since there were at least 3 regulars behind us-and all were letting us know. Once you go Jefe's you won't go back, or you'll NEVER want anything else. With that being said.... My expectations were high. And holy s#*t they were met!  We ordered 3 pollo al pastor tacos, carne asada fries, 3 beef tacos, and a quesadilla made with Monterey Jack cheese carne asada & bacon! I canme with 5 other people (just wanna throw that out there....) it was our first time and we all got free drinks and refills. Ok back to the food.... The  carne asada is amazing the seasoning is FIRE the pollo al pastor omg! And the fries bomb! The freshness of the food is so good especially for being a gas station restaurant the quality and quantity is AMAZING! Prices are sweet too what you see on the menu is the price tax has already been added.  3 tacos for 6$ can't beat it!",

Stop in earlier in the day or for late lunch or dinner. The staff is super friendly and they have lots of deals. Their tech is on point, you can put just your name in their system and get a freebie for your birthday. If you download their app, you can order ahead, access secret menu items, ultra customize your order and get other deals. Plus, the food is def on point! I've only had the carne tacos and tacos al pastor but both were fantastic. Their green sauce is top notch and you can't go wrong with the horchata or Jamaica. Plus, since it's inside a gas station there's every kind of drink or snack you could want with it. Amazing!",

I'm glad I got 4 mini street tacos because there is a second tortilla under each taco so if you pour half your taco into the other tortilla it's like you get an extra taco so I basically ate 8 tacos and there was no way I had leftovers. I licked my plate clean. Too bad there's not many authentic tacos in washington :((( Definitely recommend for anyone and tourists. Step out the strip to come here !",

The service was fantastic and couldn't say anything negative it really caught me off guard as I was expecting something similar to Robertos.  The food was amazing I ordered the pork fries.  The pork was packed with flavor and the size is out of this world.  Overall 5/5 for service and 5/5 for food.

They are LOADED! The carne asada fries...well...you must try them!  We have yet to be anything but satisfied with our food selections from Jefe's. Order to go; no one wants to eat in the middle of a gas station. Better yet, download their app and have your order waiting for you, earning taco points to boot!  Trust me. You must try Jefe's today.

The location throws you off because the taco shop is inside the gas station. But looking beyond that, it's a gem.

What stands out more is their customer service. The owner or manager, not sure who he is but he seems to be in charge, is always hard at work with his crew and is so sociable and friendly. He's such a pleasure to talk to!  My favorite thing is that they have messed up my order twice. I had to wait about 45 minutes but the owner/manager is so quick to fix mistakes, not make excuses like other restaurants that blame it on \"the kitchen\", and makes sure everything is corrected and offered me a free dish. That's what makes a place truly amazing....not that mistakes don't happen, but how they treat customers when they do happen.   Super happy to have this place near me. I recommend the carne asada fries. They are SO generous with it, it literally feels like I am lifting a 10 lbs weight, lol! However, it is inside a gas station so don't expect a formal sit-down restaurant. They have a few tables but mostly the point is take out, which works great for me!   Hope this place is here to stay. Their food is phenomenal!",

Generous and kind guys work the place who want you to have a good dining experience.   I had the California burrito. It was tasty and fresh, beats Robertos by a mile. They use real avocado in their guacamole and their salsa Roja and salsa Verde aren't watered down versions of what they should be. They're flavorful. The fries in the California burrito were crisp, not soggy. The burritos are huge. Theyre a bit more expensive than robertos but it's worth it knowing that your food was cooked for you fresh and they're not cutting corners every place they can.   Tell them it's your first time and they will hook you up and your panties will drop.",

Do not let the fact that's its in a gas station dissuade you. Fresh meat. Delicious cheese. Huge portions. Cheap prices. I LOVE THIS PLACE! Although I just visited last night for the first time, I already referred four other people and when they went in, the owner remembered who I was BY NAME. That says a lot about the pride in customer service that they have. You even get a free drink on your first visit, the online ordering system is amazing, and they give you a free meal on your birthday! As soon as I finish this review, I'm heading there! You should do the same!!",

If you're a fan of Crispy Carnitas, this is the place!  Too many places don't fry them the way they should. Real avocado in the Guacamole, not just a green sauce. The Chile has some kick but not too much which is great....  Not food related, but worth mentioning. If you need to learn customer service, hang out and talk to, or just listen to Ben for a minute. You couldn't meet a friendlier more engaging guy! The food and the service does NOT Disappoint!",

    "text": "Two days in a row for Mexican food! Not a bad thing at all. Picked the husband up at work for what I thought was going to be a quick lunchdate before I drop the boss man off. Quick was not the word.  It wasn't hard to find this place at all. I mean, gas station....there's only two in the vicinity, in which one of them bare the Jefe taco sign. We walk in to the smell of food being cooked. Shark bait.  We stand in line and it appeared to be pretty busy. People were waiting, people were in line to order,  pretty promising. It was our luck we were standing behind a couple of dudes who were ordering way too on the nitpicky side. The kind where you stand there waiting, and you can't help but to utter mutherbloopbloop in your head. The fellas themselves said, we're probably the annoying guys who annoy the people behind us, blahblah. Something to that extent. They were right about that. Okay, okay, this is going to turn into a rant.  We FINALLY get to order. The cashier informs us, unfortunately, their head cook is in the hospital so there's going to be a bit of a wait. Life happens so no problem. I think I wasn't anticipating the \"bit of a wait\" thoroughly. Oh before I forget, she did ask us how did we hear of them, have we been there before, and if I wanted to be entered into their system. If you choose to do so, you get a free meal on your birthday. Awesome!  When you check-in you get a free drink offer in which I took advantage of. We opted for horchata. Alls we ordered was 3 mini Carne asada tacos, 3 mini lengua tacos, and a side order of plain ole french fries. Our total was 15 bucks even.   Anyway, it's always my luck to head somewhere new with some kind of incident. Their head cook is in the hospital so their marketing guy became head cook.  Honestly, you could clearly tell it wasn't his thang because the bit of a wait was definitely a bit of a wait. It took about 40-45 mins until we received our mini tacos and fries. We waited a little longer because I overheard the cashier and cook tell the guys before us he had to redo their food as he was not satisfied with the way it turned out.    Luckily, I'm patient. The husband on a lunchbreak with the 2 babies, not so much. Glad I sent him to the truck 15 mins into the waiting. And no wonder why the girls who were sitting at the table when we walked in had the most broke faces ever.   Anyway, the last 10mins of waiting, the cook came out to apologize and explain why it was taking longer than usual. I appreciated the communication rather than being ignored because it gives you a boost of hope.....the hope that your food will soon be done. The quicker I said okay, thank you, then the quicker he can get back into the kitchen to finish up his line.  There are items on their menu that are on the pricey end considering it's a hole in the wall type of joint. Tacos were within reason as well.   We finally got our food. Sadly, we had to jet the husband back to work. He ate in his office, while I ate in his parking lot because the babies had fell asleep on the ride back so it wasn't like I could sit in the office with him to eat. So fries went to waste because the fries were for the minions. Was not in a french fry mood, the horror...I know.   Because we waited so long for just 6 mini tacos and fries...I couldn't appreciate the hype about this place. While I will admit their Carne asada meat is clearly of a higher grade and properly seasoned...I just don't forsee myself driving back anytime soon. Note, anytime soon. My husband, upset, was even more upset to find his lengua tacos weren't lengua. He got shredded meat instead. He just didn't tell me which shredded meat it was. Needless to say, he was even more furious.  I'm such a huge taco fan, I do think they were good, but  again...the wait just didn't allow me to see what the hype was. Plus, while I waited...there were a bunch of obnoxious people entering the gas station acting like they're all drugged up or something. Not a big fan of such a vibe. So you have to kind of see from my experience how much of a fail it turned out to be. I'm gonna need a moment to recover.   Hopefully, the headcook recovers from whatever he is experiencing. It's always sad to hear of anyone having to be in the hospital. Life happens and sometimes businesses get shaken up beyond their control so I'm not blaming anyone of such. It was just my luck of bad timing in wanting to try somewhere new.  But despite the wait, I certainly would boost someone to give them a try. Whenever I do decide to return, hopefully, I can give a better rating. So for now, the 3 stars is the best I can give because I honestly didn't get to experience what everyone else who reviewed experienced.  *Because it is in a gas station and does not have adequate seating, I don't think the location/environment is kid friendly. I would even save the hassle of unfolding a stroller.",

Sooooooo we found this hole in the wall Mexican place with 5 stars on Yelp !! So why not give it a try. He got the jefe's burrito and I got the Mega carne asada fries to share with my sister and my boyfriend. we also got a quesadilla with a mix of cheddar and Monterey Jack.   We met Ben and the story of his business and what quality of service and food he and his staff is providing. Also any student with straight As get a free burrito!!  Now back to the food lol the jefe has chicken, shrimp and steak neatly wrapped in a tortilla. I had a bite with some red sauce (had a nice kick) and then this green sauccce and he said he couldn't finish it because the size of this was the size of his arm but, because of how great it was he did lol, it was cooked very well and was well seasoned. Now my behemoth of a meal, the MEGA fries and the name does not do this justice, meat was not dry, is was tender, flavorful and juicy. Fries were crispy and cooked perfectly not soggy or greasy. All together was a match in heaven in my mouth. Quesadilla was filled with a very good amount probably 1/2 a pound of cheese lol (there's no such thing as too much cheese ).  We will most definitely be coming back.",

Not the quickest, but good food takes time, & this was certainly worth the wait (15 min or so). I was looking for something fast in the Cenntennial Hills area, & came across this place. With so many great reviews, I thought I'd give it a try.   It's located inside a gas station, so don't expect a lot of pomp & circumstance.  I got the monster breakfast burrito w/ chorizo & grilled peppers & onions. My gf got a California burrito with beans instead of steak. Everything was cooked perfectly, & their green & red sauces are both delicious. The cook/possible owner was incredibly accommodating (though you're out of luck if you're vegan).   I don't live anywhere near this place, but I may take a trip back to the area. It was that tasty.",

I've gotten a different burrito before, and since I plan on making another trip before I go back to California, I decided to go with what my tummy wanted, which was the spicy shrimp burrito. It had peppers, tomato paste, spanish rice and lots of delicious shrimp in it.    The sauce is that perfect spiciness that doesn't need any extra chile on top and oh God,  their shrimps are perfectly cooked, plump, and plentiful. Every bite is AMAZING!  I couldn't finish the rest of my burrito firstly because it was amazing and delicious and the sauce has that nice medium kick you can still feel in your mouth, but it's not a burning ache, it's more of a nice slow roast.   And secondly, their burritos are ENORMOUS, I'm pretty sure they're about the size of my forearm and SO you can always grub on leftovers as well.   The customer service was awesome,  checking in our food,  asking if we needed refills, I've gotten better service in this small restaurant inside a gas station than at some fancier places in SoCal.   My congratulations to the owners on their new baby,  apparently wife was AT WORK having contractions,  and still closed up shop for the day  before heading to the hospital. Dedicated!",

The seasoning on the meat was excellent and there was plenty of meat on them.  They did not skimp!  Now the rolled tacos...for 6 they offered 3 &3.  That was awesome.  You don't have to get all of one kind.  My son had no complaints about them. I tried the rolled tacos and it wasn't just tortilla and a little bit of meat.  It was a filled to just the right amount.  So now the sauces.  The red sauce is not for wimps.  It is spicy, so if your a wimp with hot I would suggest the green sauce.  It was really good.    I have already referred a friend so I obviously thought it was delicious.  The price is a little higher than what you would pay for at Robertos but the quality of food is 100 times better.  And you can get refills on horchata!!",

    "text": "Food: carne asade mini street tacos. I ordered 3 at $2.50 each. These were REALLY good. The tortillas were hot and fresh tasting. The meat was nicely marinated and of good quality. Served with plenty of onion and cilantro. They offered red or green salsa on the side and I had the green.   Location: inside a gas station so that is the really unfortunate and gross part. There are 3 tables with about 8 chairs. It's near the smelly bathroom. I got over it because the tacos were so good. Plus gas stations freak me out because all I can think about is it getting robbed so I can't relax.   Service: the guy at the counter was really nice but it took forever to make our food.   This place is really far for me in NLV and we only went there because we had to go to a car dealership near there. :(",

Everything else was stellar!   ...and I mean really **really** good  The owner, Ben, is a among the rock star elite when it comes to customer service.

The owner Ben is very friendly and has great customer service. He knew all about my keto diet and created a \"burrito\" bowl special for me. He even offered a free drink while I waited for my freshly made food! I ordered the Jefe burrito bowl with added cheese which was so filling I could only eat half! My husband ordered the asada burrito and Ben added beans and rice at no extra charge! My brother got a grilled chicken taco salad. The shrimp, chicken and steak were perfectly seasoned and grilled without all those weird fatty chunks most Mexican restaurants have. They really care about your whole experience here...don't be fooled by the gas station, the best places are always hidden like that! Next time I want to try one of their breakfast burrito bowls! I will be back regularly for sure.",

Ben was very inviting.  Informed me of the birthday meal, which I'll come back for. And I think I overheard something about an anniversary meal too.  Ok. On to the food. California burrito on point.  Warning: red sauce is hot. Green sauce mild.  Will definitely be back to try other item on the menu.  Keep up the good work guys! For those who left the few under 4 star reviews, thanks for trying, but won't stop me from coming back, plus there are at least 200 more 5 star reviews that will have any new comer over looking your criticisms.  Came back.  Another cali burrito. This time though, I bought some chicharonnes and had them put it into my burrito. My favorite burrito, customized? Deserve a five star rating.   Ben told me of a customer that gave a 1 star for not being able to do a call in order... you rate a restaurant on the food, not on how you don't get you way. You want your way you can go to Burger King.",

    "text": "When I received an email talking about the 2016 Bizzie Awards, I had no idea such a thing existed.  When they mentioned the Jefe's Taco Shop (JTS) was a recipient of such an award, I  had no idea Jefe's existed.  After reading several of the reviews and eyeballing some of the photos, I knew I would have to pay JTS a visit.  BOOKMARKED.  Thank you yelp and fellow yelpers!  JTS is located inside a gas station on the corner of Tenaya & Sky Pointe.  It seemed an odd sort of business relationship after walking through the doors.  I scanned the surrounding prior to walking to make a purchase and observed the happenings.  Most arrangements like this serve some typed of process trash but Jefe's certainly did not appear to doing that.  The quarters are small and tight, but I would later find that the heart of JTS is wide open, kind, and tasty.  It was a Saturday night if memory serves.  My arrival was just sort of the dinner rush.  The nice lady at the register took my order which consisted of a cheese quesadilla and Jefe's burrito.  JTS also has a program where on your birthday, they will feed you for free.  I enrolled.  Hopefully, it does not fall on a Sunday or Monday because JTS would be closed.  I checked in on my handy and dandy yelp app and received a complimentary drink.  I chose a horchata to compliment my meal.  I was advised the horchata was at the tail of the current batches existence.  JTS makes it fresh and I was informed a new batch was forth coming.  I took what was left enjoying and sort of enjoyed a liquid version of the cinnamon challenge.  But it's not the horchata I want to write about.  It's the food and the very pleasant and personal experience.  Ben was working behind the counter and engaged me in witty banter.  Seems we are from the same neck of the woods in a San Diego County sort of sense.  Full of smiles and stories, I sat back and watched him engage every customer that came through, be they new or a regular.  When my meal arrived, I had secured a seat at one the small tables just in front of the counter.  The customers kept coming and decided to punch out.  Thought about just sitting on my truck bed but opted to just head home.  But not before exchanging pleasantries with the lady and Ben before I left.  I will forgo my review of the quesadilla.  Unless it's cold, there is no such thing as a bad one.  But on that note, if you want a regular cheese quesadilla, it's huge and you are presented with several cheese options.  I like cheddar.  Maybe it's not authentic, but it's how my Abuelita used to make it.  The Jefe burrito was 12,000 calories of pure surf, turf, and cluck joy!  Just north of ten bucks, it's shrimp, carne asada, and chicken awesomeness.  It comes with pico, guacamole, sour cream, and I added cheese.  These amazing ingredients were swaddled in what JTS describes as a 16\" real flour, \"San Diego\" tortilla.  And....get this....it's made with lard.  The way a damn tortilla should be made.  My eyes rolled back in my head like a great white shark with every bite.  Each bite was complimented with a dousing of JTS's wonderful red hot sauce.  Since my visit, I think of JTS everyday.  I could easily visit everyday.  The only reason I don't is because I don't want to weigh 400 lbs.  But trust you, me.......I will return...and I will bring others to share in the experience!",

    "text": "I moved from Los Angeles a few years ago and was looking for a good local Mexican Food. I found Jefe's Taco Shop on Yelp. At first, I was unable to find it, since it in a Sinclair Gas Station Convenience Store.  The food was good, but not cheap. I started going there and generally took food home for my family. The first part of this year, they closed for some reason. I am not sure what happened (could of been a health issue). When they opened up a few months ago, my son and I went in to get food to take home. We ordered Street Tacos, mostly Carnitas. It took a very long time waiting for the food to be prepared. We then left and went home with our order. The food prepared was inedible...fatty...chewy and just bad. I sent a private text on Yelp to the owner Ben and he apologized and said he would refund me for the order. It has been a couple of months and I decided to stop by today for the refund. He defended his food and said he ate the same thing we did at the time and found nothing wrong with it. Really? I was going to give him another chance place an order to eat there. He told me that there were three orders ahead of me. That is basically telling me he does not want my business. It was rude and very unprofessional. This is not the way you treat a customer. I will never return, as there are much better places to go.",

My brother in law is obsessed with this place and everytime that I come into town this place is a must stop. Not only is the food PHENOMINAL, but Ben is a great guy and a hell of a business owner...let me elaborate: I sat out a recent trip to Vegas but I asked my wife to see if she could get me some food, freeze it, and bring it home - she said she'd try. When she proposed what she was going to do with Ben, he took over. He individually packaged all items, TSA approved by the way, and I had this amazing food in my own kitchen in Pittsburgh.

At first I was a little apprehensive based on the location, but we love trying different places. Man was it worth it!   The owner is hilarious and nice! We come back time and time again because of the service he gives us. The food is always top quality.   The food is not fast food. If you are on a time limit, order online. He now has online ordering which makes it easy to order from home, and get there when it is ready. That being said, we don't mind going and waiting 25 min for our food or however long it takes, because waiting for quality food it totally worth it.   One time my fiance ordered a combo burrito, and the person working basically said the person coming in at 6 makes it better, and he is better off waiting until 6, or next time and getting something else. That honestly won us over! He recommended something else, and said next time it's on him if he doesn't have the ingredients or something to accommodate us.   When we want a good burrito, we go here, every time. Hands down.",

We got mini tacos, MASSIVE burritos, chips, a quesadilla, and horchatas.   I had the Jefe's Burrito and it was very good. The tortilla was so soft and beautiful, the meats were cooked and seasoned greatly, and the guac was creamy and tasty. I really liked it.   The chips were crunchy and super good! They are thick, but salty and more hearty than super thin chips.  The green and red sauce were both so good at what they do - green for mild, red for hot. I mixed em a couple times for the kick + taste.   The horchata was super good: not too watery but not too syrupy to where it feels like you're drinking melted sugar haha.   It's in a gas station, which, was a gas station in terms of cleanliness. But I'm not picky so I don't care about that. They asked if I wanted likes and I watched the guy wash the lines and rinse his knife before cutting them for me. Then he came over and chatted with me just a bit and welcomed me, even though I'm white and he was Hispanic, there was no racism or difference between either of us! We both brothers! So that was cool.   I ordered all the food online and didn't experience any issues in the process. It has a lot of customization options on there too which is sweet (extra meat / toppings etc).   Would DEFINITELY go again.. it's that great Mexican food vibe that works for school kids, but one of my favorites in that category for sure. Thanks Jefe's!!!!!",

    "text": "Take a moment to realize this place has 5 stars and serves Mexican food out of a gas station -   When my friend told me about this place I was skeptical. Drove here all the way from Summerlin on a Sunday to not have realized on Yelp that it was closed. Per the owner it'll be closing on Mondays as well very soon.  Let's begin with Ben himself because he's the reason this place is so liked. He's out of control in the best of ways & will make an impression on you. Charismatic is an understatement. If you don't like anything he'll take care of it, no questions asked. Talk about awesome customer service!   Now the food - we ordered small carne asada fries that could feed 4 and we also wanted to try some of the street tacos so we got chicken & al pastor. The chicken was moist but super spicy for my white girl problems. The al pastor was a little dry. The carne asada fries I will dream about anytime I'm hungry, out of control amazing! Loaded with pretty much everything it's heaven in your mouth! The meat was super tender and very flavorful.   Ben also gives all newbies complimentary drinks so he recommended we mix the limon & hibiscus and I loved the combo!   A reminder, this is in a gas station. It's not date night material for you cheap guys but perfect for every other occasion. We will be back to hang with Ben and get more carne asada!",

They have two sizes, the super size (small which is still huge) and mega (I think but that's even bigger!) We also got a shrimp burrito for obvious reasons (it has shrimp, duh.) The shrimp burrito was about as long as my forearm and too big for me to even grab with my hands.. That's a burrito right there. It was the BEST shrimp burrito I've ever had in my entire life. Coming from San Diego to a city that doesn't have too many good Mexican shops was the best choice the owner could ever make. They proved are a few bucks more than usual but the flavors and portioning sizes make up for it. It's worth it!!! And their service ugh. Everyone there was so cool and nice. The owner is the most honest man I've ever met. Their customer service is so impressive. I really recommend this place!",

    "text": "For those who don't speak Spanish, El Jefe means the boss. And it takes cojones to claim you're the boss, especially when you're located inside a gas station. This place also had me cautious before coming because gas station food pretty high on the list of things I don't trust, right behind Donald Trump's hairdresser.  I was also annoyed when I looked on the menu and saw it would be $7 for a breakfast burrito because I'm also a believer that fast food should be cheap. However it all changed when the burrito came out. It was basically the size of my forearm. But we all know size doesn't matter and it's the taste of the burrito and it was might tasty. I've been back several times and everything was good. Chicken and beef breakfast burritos were on point. I've had a chorizo burrito and tacos. Literally everything I've had is delicious, especially with the green sauce. Long story short, you're going to want to check this out. They called themselves the boss and they certainly are living up to it. High fives all around  P.S. They're super cool here and my first time they gave me a free drink. They have All the agua frescas and my favorite is Jamaica or a Jamiaca/ Limon combo. I also found out they do the drinks free with a yelp check in as of 4/16/16.",

It is located in gas station which can be off putting to some, but get over it!! This is probably the best taco shop in Vegas. The kitchen is clean and the owners/staff are friendly and kind. I ordered the mini street tacos because I wanted to taste the meat without accoutrements. Many a bad taco has been hidden with toppings. Do I got three Carne Asada tacos, two chicken, and one al pastor taco. I also had my littles with me and got them a cheese quesadilla and fries. The Carne asada was cooked well, not dried out or overly chewy. The seasoning was the perfect amount of spice. The corn tortillas here are boss! Not overly salty like some places we've been. The chicken tacos were great too! The chicken was moist and similarly seasoned to the carne asada but not as spicy! The al pastor was amazing! It wasn't dried out, had great seasoning and the right amount of smoke/char flavor. The kids demolished the cheese quesadilla, fries, and horchata. Which in my house is amazing because they're some picky eaters. But honestly if you want a taco or anything else you see on the menu, give it a try, it'll be amazing!! Found my new taco stop.",

The best ones were in Paramount, Ca. very close to Compton, Ca. IMHO. I'll be back to try the rest of their menu, as of this writing I can highly recommend their Carne Asada and Al Pastor Tacos. The quality of their meat sets them apart from the other local Taco Shops.Their Hot Salsa is also top shelf in taste and heat. The owner \"Ben\" is highly personable and a great guy to talk to with great customer service, he's not too bad for a PENDEJO. ;-)) These guys are from San Diego where the quality of Taco Shops are outstanding and comparable to Los Angeles's finest. (Their entire menu is recommended, as of this update, two months later, I've eaten just about everything on the menu with zero disappointment.)",

    "text": "Really good food. It is located inside of Sinclair and the food is very good.  Fresh ingredients made to order right in front of you.  The quality of the product is fantastic.  If there was one knock, I would say the prices are mildly higher than a Roberto's, but that is likely because the ingredients are a bit superior.  Each of our burritos was $9 which is not a fortune, but if you are used to paying $7, it is a bit steeper.  However, you get what you pay for... :)",

I tried the Carne Asada street tacos with refried beans/rice in the side and my wife tried the California burrito bowl. I absolutely loved mine and she said hers was \"spectacular\". It's in a gas station so directions threw me off a bit and I drove right past it, but turned around and managed to figure it out. I met Ben and he was super nice guy and very proud of his creations, as well he should be.",

I don't typically see things like that so I was immediately taken back. He then goes to mention we treat our customers like family which is what I seen in a short amount of time. I've come here before and usually have great food and good customer service I definitely recommend this place to anybody and everybody and if you're hesitant don't be go in and get food",
