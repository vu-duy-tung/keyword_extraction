They also have $2 well drinks and wine as well as a great selection of bar food for $4.50. I had an IPA and a Santa Klaas Holiday Ale which was specially brewed for the holiday season. This was a very dark ale that is made with coffee beans and cocoa nibs. It was a delicious and different bittersweet ale with coffee and chocolate overtones. The service was friendly and fantastic!  We were only there for drinks this trip but will definitely return for more awesome beer and to try some of the yummy bar food!",

When we come out to Fremont St we always go here for a beer or two and some dinner. Happy Hour is M-F 3-6pm $2.50 beers and $4.5 apps. And again after midnight $2.00 beers! Also, we love the Main St Station casino. It's gorgeous inside with a great ambiance!",

    "text": "If your staying at the Main Station Hotel, you have to try any of their beef burgers! It's like they make the burger patty fresh and they cook it to perfection! No salt or frozen taste. It was VERY moist and the meat tasted like it was fresh from the deli! Amazingness! I took one bite of my bfs burger and I sure as hell didn't give it back lol! He had only like 3 bites left of the burger anyway :D.  Anyways, I love their chicken nugget appetizer! Though I'm not big fan of any wing sauces..The sauce was very powerful and tasty. Just not my type of things though. Their garlic fries as delicious! Their pizza is hand made when you order. I saw the chef working on it and spreading cheese and then in the oven it goes! All to go orders are additional $2. But HEY, that was the tip money anyway if I was going to eat there you know?  Whats unique about this place is that they have great burgers, YET they have a personal sushi chef making sushi till 12am! Now that is amazing!! I loved the unagi sushi that I ordered. The chef even shaped my wasabi into a leaf!   Oh and for you beer drinkers out there...This location actually brews their own beer. You can see the machinery in my photos. They have a 5 beer sampler on the menu that is only $5.99 and any other beer you order is just as cheap and delightful!   A must dine restaurant :) We will be coming back soon!",

I had garlic fries and my girl had the flatbread with meat lovers that was like a huge pizza it was so yummy licious recommended all the dishes that came out looks wonderful.

    "text": "If it were all about Happy Hour, Triple 7 gets Four stars, but it's not always happy hour. The Happy Hour menu includes some appetizer like dishes and some sushi. Sushi and beer during happy hour does justice to the term here.   For the regular menu, they charge $1.00 for sharing a extra plate when sharing an entree, but that's well worth it because a lot of their entrees, you can easily share. For instance, their hamburgers start off as a half pound patty - that's two quarter-pounders at McDonalds. They also have a half pound hot dog, which two can easily share, especially if you add chili to it.   However, quantity doesn't always mean quality. I find the taste of the entrees here to be disappointing. They look pleasing to the eye, but when you bite into the food, the flavor is missing. It's like you need a beer to enhance your taste buds. Without the beer, the food just doesn't cut it.   Besides the nature of Happy Hour, the beer is the best thing about this place. Like any other Microbrewery, the beer stands out from the standard fare, maybe because it's more fresh, if that makes sense.   All in all, though, it's really the only casually priced sit-down/wait service place in the Main Street/California Casino complex, and if you are in the mood for this type of dining and don't want to go outside, Triple 7 is an adequate choice. Beer and Sushi during Happy Hour, this would be a very good choice.",

    "text": "I'll make this my 100th review because this place is pretty freaking awesome and it's a total hidden gem that I've been frequenting for many years. Greedy me hopes that not too many people find out about this place....horrible I am!!! D=  First off, the parking can't get any better. This restaurant is located inside Main Street Station Casino and the Main Street parking structure is never overcrowded, and it's like 20 yards from the casino entrance. No hassle parking always makes for a happy camper, especially with how Vegas has become so commercialized and BIG. You can't go anywhere without parking a million miles away from where you are trying to get to.  Next, they have tons of beers that are actually brewed here, so you can get some very chilled, fresh brewed beer. I suggest that you start off with a super tall beer before you order. Most are pretty potent so you will be fairly lit before your food comes.  The food is great and the variety is quite interesting. They have sashimi and assorted sushi which has been really fresh and well prepared every time I have ordered it, and the prices are very reasonable. The sandwiches, burgers, and other entrees are also good and consistently prepared. I haven't had anything that I didn't like here, let's put it that way.  Oh yeah and have another beer with your food...don't forget about that. Why get half intoxicated when you can go all the way!!!  The service is excellent with a super friendly staff, and normally there isn't much of a wait, if at all. When you are done, there is a skywalk across to California Casino, and Binions and Fremont are just across the street. Golden Nugget is barely a block away. Good spots for some action wtihout all the hassle of the Strip....well unless you like the hassle. Sometimes I do, sometimes I don't, but it's nice to have a choice.  If you play enough at Main Street you'll get comped here at 777, so even better, your beers and meal will be free-e-e-e-e!!!! So hit the tables and the machines next time you are here and then grub down on some great food!!!",

Much more going on then I remember in years past. We sampled their:  Royal Red Lager Marker Pale Ale High Roller Gold Blackchip Porter Brewers Special...I believe was a Pumpkin Spice Ale  The names were cute, first brewery to really have vegas or gambling names, which surprised us. The beers were good...seemed like they tried to make lots of different styles including a Belgian quadruple, which we didn't get to try. The brewpub was a nice change because it was dedicated a area to beer and food and didn't have video poker at every table. Great place to watch sports with a large group. We defiantly try again.",

I liked the Double Down as well as the Pale Ale, and he liked the one with the gold tapper.  Richard was also a great bartender and remembered us from earlier that afternoon.    Two other bartenders were disaffected, however, which detracted from our experience.  One looked like Alfred E. Newman all grown up and could have cared less if we were there.  Another on Wednesday night just gave us our drinks, never asked any questions, and cashed us out.    All-in-all, if you're a beer fan, definitely stop by and try it!",

Now for the most important part, the food and brew. I ordered the Korean tacos and two brews. The tacos were excellent with an amazing spicy kick typical of great Korean food, the brews were off the hook, they had a great batch of hefeweizen and an awesome triple bock named after our waitress (who was awesome). All in all the microbrew is top notch and the food and ambiance is 5 star, why this place isn't packed to the ceiling is simply location. People when on Freemont st expand your horizons there is more in life than tasteless food from Tony Roma's and gimmick diners like the Heart Attack grill!!!...use Google map it's 3min off Freemont and well worth the walk!

My dad said his over overcooked but still said it was okay.  My mom had no complaints about her burger and fries.  My husband and I split artichoke and cheese dip.  This comes with tortilla chips and pieces of garlic bread.  Overall, bland...I wouldn't suggest ordering it.  However, if you do...it tasted better on the garlic bread so skip the tortilla chips.  We also split the BBQ Chicken Pizza.  It was okay but I think it needed to be cooked a little longer.  If it would've had a nice crisp, browning to the cheese and crust it would've been 5 stars.  However, it came out looking a little undercooked so I would only give it about a 2-3 stars.  We ordered the 5 beer sampler.  My husband and I only finished 3 of the 5 beers...the 2 light samples and the amber samples were all good.  The 2 dark beers were very bitter and medicine tasting.  I'm normally a dark beer drinker, took 1 sip and couldn't finish the beers.    Our server was okay.  There was a college football game on so she was very concerned and distracted with the large table next to us.    Overall, I would go back here for a happy hour.

Though Sin City might indeed be the creator of many sinful provocations and temptations, \"humble\" isn't a word that comes to mind readily. However, visiting the little brother of The Strip and spending time in Downtown Las Vegas had the benefit of finding a nook, a corner to sit in where the smoke of cigarettes and waves of slot machines faded to a hum. Brick walls and copper colored beer vats instead took place and slowly, it's easy to phase into a history mixed with old speakeasies and modern day breweries like BJ's. Triple 7 Restaurant & Microbrewery welcomed everyone back to the brewing days.  Deco: 4 stars  The interior is surprisingly large. Although located inside Main Street Casino, walking in felt like you were inside one half of a giant brewery, waiting to be explored like an adult in Willy Wonka's beer factory. Large copper vats can be seen and old saloon ceiling fans churned the atmosphere. Flat screen TVs showcased the latest in sports and a huge open dining floor with no partitions to be seen showcased the large space available for accommodation. There is no glitz and glamour of a showgirl here. Simply the girl-next-door humble look we all learn to love one day at a time.  Service: 3 stars  The service was friendly, almost down right Southern. The server was pleasant, introducing the different specials of the day as well as the selection of beers that are brewed within the very walls you find yourself. However, as tantalizing as the descriptions for food and drink might have been, it was a bit slow. Hopefully you are in no hurry.  Food & Drink: 4 stars  The great thing about a simple place is they give you simple, delicious food in large quantity. Sure, this isn't Bouchon or Mesa Grill but it doesn't have to be. There is no need for comparison because the food tastes great for what it is: traditional American cuisine made with good ingredients and lots of generosity in portion sizes. The burgers are juicy with crunchy, savory breads. The fries are crisp with a texture perfect for sauces. The salads are huge and filling for vegetarian and omnivores alike. Come hungry and you'll leave full. Come famished and you'll leave satisfied.  And because they brew and create their own hoppy libations on site, you as a diner have the pleasure to sample and indulge on truly unique beers you can only find here. The porter was delicious with that oaky, smokey, caramel aftertaste after each sip. The amber ale was as golden as a Swede's hair in summer. Plus like every brewery, there are flights to be had and spirits to enjoy. If for nothing else, you should come for the beer.  Price: 4 stars  The price might not be the cheapest in the land, hovering around the same price you would pay at a Hoff's Hut or BJ's, but you get so much for your money. It never feels like you've been cheated out of your money or you made a gamble by coming here, which is a great feeling considering all the dangerous that your wallet will face before or after dining here. Instead, just like the food, you feel satisfied.  Conclusion  Many people won't know about this wonderful brewery. Even more people will find it hard to believe you. But once you come here and truly experience what a gem this place really is, you'll be wondering why you never came before. From the artisan beers to the tranquility within the storm of chaos all around, Triple 7 Restaurant is truly unique and worth experiencing. You'll make a lot of bad choices during your stay in Sin City. You should at least try to make a good one by dining here.",

    "text": "Review #777      Yelp Review 777 only appears once in a Yelper's life. I couldn't think of a luckier  place to write about for the landmark Yelp review 777 than 777 Microbrewery and Restaurant in the downtown Las Vegas.     Where Yelp review #777 appears once in my lifetime, the Triple 7 Microbrewery appears often. The surface parking lot at Main Street Station is my parking place of choice when I visit the Fremont Street Experience. The deal is that you have to buy $5 worth of food or drinks to validate the $5 to use the parking lot. Usually I make a beeline to the Triple 7 for a lucky cold one or two before a night on Fremont Street. The problem is that the beer is so inexpensive causing me to buy two to cover the validation. For example, currently draft beer is $2 during football. That was the case yesterday when I drank a large draft strawberry beer that came out to  $2.16 after tax.      Triple 7 is an upbeat spot to enjoy a couple of Lucky cold ones. The atmosphere is rock & roll music, professional sports, bar talk, and the 1800s railroad station motif that permeates Main Street Station. Yesterday I'd take in U2's \"With or Without You\" between glances of a soccer and baseball game. Triple 7 is a cavernous bar and restaurant with high ceilings bordered by two large bars and a microbrewery. The large space in between is filled with tables. From past experience, the bar on the right is the quiet bar that is frequently closed where the bar on the left is the party bar. Regardless of where you sit, a lucky strawberry or any microbrewery beer tastes good.     Yesterday, I took my Triple 7 experience to the next level by returning for dinner. Besides being a microbrewery, it is the unofficial cafe of Main Street Station unless you count the cafe in its sister property The California. After spending time in the Fremont Street Experience, I returned for dinner. Let me say that I was impressed. I ordered the meatloaf which included a vegetable of choice and mixed vegetables for $8.99. My choice of vegetable of the day was a baked potato. I added soup of the day for an additional  $1.99. Complimenting the food, I passed over a beer for Pepsi. The chicken gumbo soup with saltine crackers was of the same high quality as their beer. But the meatloaf was the bomb. The quality and quantity satisfied my expectations. The tasty mushroom gravy with genuine mushrooms brought the meatloaf to a level that exceeded my expectations for a microbrewery restaurant. The baked potato that included butter and Land O Lakes sour cream was  mutant. I don't recall eating a baked potato this large. Ultimately the soda glass was huge. All this came out to around $15.25.      Throughout dinner, the waitress was attentive and friendly. Additionally she did not make the error of serving the soup too close to the entree or rush me.    When I drink a cold one in Triple 7, it is \"Cheers \" to good luck. In conclusion Review 777 is an Internet toast \"to good luck and good times.\"",

Theirs tastes more like a pale ale that's trying really hard to be an IPA. Not a whole lotta kick. 4.50 for a 22 oz should be something to revel in, but it was just more weak liquid to drink. Their pale ale was a little more hoppy and tasted like it should. Beer, unfortunately, was the most disappointing part of the lunch.   Food: Calamari to start was pretty good. The batter was light and didn't give you bubble guts from all the grease. Ahi salad had some beautiful pieces of ahi, napa cabbage, avo, tomato, and some crunchies on top. Dressing was light. Wanted more though. Ask for it on the side. Oyster shooters for libido.   Server: Shane. We sat at the bar and he ran his butt off. He took care of his customers and filled orders for the rest of the joint. He literally ran everywhere he went. Hats off to him!",

I came here for the 1st time recently for lunch, even though I've worked right down the street for years. This place is great for lunch, even if you're in a hurry because they have an express menu where your meal is free if it doesn't come out within 20 or 30 min. I didn't order off the express menu though, and decided to go with a burger since that's what a friend recommended I try. I went with the San Francisco burger which uses grilled sourdough bread instead of buns. The burger was great and cooked medium like I had asked for.   We sat at the bar and the bartender was really nice and attentive throughout the meal. When we left, he asked if we worked in the area and then proceeded to fill out a couple stamp/punch cards and handed them to us. Ask for one if you're a local, you'll get a free meal after 5 weekday lunch purchases.   Overall this place was great, both food and staff. I will have to return for some brews after hours. They have happy hour Mon-Fri from 3-6 PM as well.",

Coming into a casino, you wouldn't expect a brewpub to hold up, but don't let the location fool you.  They brew about 7, rotating varieties, and I tried them all.  The stout and porter tasted generic, and the red was just okay, but the Double IPA and the Pale Ale were quite nice and tasted as good as any other mass-produced brand.  It was hoppy, bitter, and tasty.  The prices are ridiculous as well.  For $4 you get a 16oz pour, or for $4.50 you get a 22oz.  Or, you can get a 5, 5oz sampler for $6.  Then to match they have a Happy Hour to knock those prices down even further.  It's located right downtown and is within walking distance to the Fremont strip.  In the future I wouldn't mind stopping in here for my beer fix and getting a quality brew instead of paying the absurd strip prices at other bars downtown.",

So be prepared to wait a few minutes.   This place looks like someone built a brewery around a sports bar that happens to have a sushi station in it. Really need looking. Large televisions with sports or ESPN playing and giant beer tanks. Tons of tables and tons of noise.   I ordered the chicken strip meal $10.99 and a water. Omg the water and soda cups are huge!!! I felt like I had just ordered a big gulp. Amazingly enough i ordered another water. The heat makes you thirsty. The chicken strips are huge you get three big strips that are about the size of half a chicken breast each. They are so juicy. I ordered ranch and honey mustard to dip. Stay away from the honey mustard it has a reddish-orange color and doesn't taste right. The ranch is good though! Also comes with fries, carrot and celery, and cole slaw. I thought the cole slaw was bland not enough dressing. The fries were perfect. All and all I would ask for extra ranch. So much food between the 8 of us!!!   Good to order: chicken strip meal, fried calamari, bucket of shrimp, cheese bread.   Steer clear of: Asian chicken salad! Salad lacks flavor.",

    "text": "Going to keep this short.  Triple 7 is a cool local place that serves cheap (VERY DECENT) craft beers (23 oz $3.95) and typical bar foods (CHEAP) with sushi randomly thrown in there.   From my experience... skip the prime rib, it was pretty ugly, overcooked and well ugly.  They run food specials all the time depending on the nearby holiday, but your mileage will vary on the taste. Stick to the classics (burgers, sandwiches, salads, etc) to be safe.   They brews come in a good classic variety: kolsch, pale lager, red ale, stout, and porter. They carry special releases like their cherry stout that I heard is a must.   I don't know the quality of the sushi or fish freshness at Triple 7, but there is a Japanese chef if that helps lol.   Overall place to visit as a tourist and a local for some low key bonding time with the homies.",

My favorite, the Royal Red! It's the only beer of theirs that I drink because it's so damned good, like goes down smooth with a great flavor, just can't get enough! Not to mention the beer prices are phenomenal and during happy hour are even better!  The food here is great, I don't think i've ever had anything bad, EVER. Their regular menu food is awesome and their \"standard bar faire\" is more than that. it's \"kick ass bar faire\" Garlic fries are a must have!   Service has always been fantastic! This is one of my favorite local spots for sure and I take everyone I know there!",

Oysters Rockefeller is excellent! Peal and eat shrimp is a nice little side to snack on. Middle of the night craving? Try their soup only offered during the late night hours. Their beer is delicious, make sure to try it. My favorite is their raspberry beer however it's seasonal and there's always something new to try.   Recommended Foods: Crab & Artichoke Dip, Ribs - the meat is so so tender it falls off the bone. Literally! Pizza is just okay, a take it or leave it dish, peel and eat shrimp, hamburgers, sandwiches, prime rib is good... portions are generous, more than enough!   (Went back today, had the dip and ribs again... yummy! Parmigiana sandwich was not that good though the cream of corn soup was very good)",

If you drink, then you must get the beer sampler.  You're not really coming for the food.  Remember that.  I hit this spot pretty regularly whenever I am in Vegas (because Downtown gambling and people-watching FAR outranks the Strip).  It has all the bad food you crave during the rat race of salads and Diet Cokes.  Even if there is a line out front, waiting to get in, just hang tight because it moves fast, no matter how large the group.  Very similar to a buffet cattle call.  Just eat, drink and be merry here!",

We can't help but go here with the affordable prices for food and its yummy! Service is just as good there too. Every time we've had such friendly waiters or waitresses and they are always there filling up your glass with your beverage! Never an empty soda/water glass!  We ordered their cheese bread (the size of a pizza), oozing with melty, gooey cheese. Every piece you pick up, the cheese just stretches along until you have to break it apart with your hand. With its greasy, cheesy goodness, each bite is delish!  Hubby ordered the pepperoni pizza, which was just as tasty as the cheese bread but with pepperoni on top. I ordered their 1/2 lb prime rib, which was cooked to perfection. The 1/2 lb prime rib is a steal! For only about $8.99, you get the 1/2 lb prime rib, vegetables and a choice of a baked potato, rice or fries. I opted for the baked potato. Just thinking of how it was makes my mouth water. If you're downtown and looking for affordable food and great service, I recommend Triple 7.",

When we arrived around 4:30 PM there were empty tables and open spots at the bar, yet the hostess was moving so slowly seating people that a line had built up at the entrance. The people in line waiting weren't even told that the bar was open seating so they could bypass the line if they chose to. Empty tables = lost sales; no excuse for that situation. One of the reasons I chose this restaurant was the on site brewery, but when I opened the menu to the beer to see what local micro brews were available, I was told that they were out of three of their six options. The one I ordered tasted more like the ubiquitous coors lite than a craft brew. The food came fast, and was about on par with the price; I will not be returning.",

Not a lot, but we venture out a lot and aren't usually in the Casino's until later in the evenings.  One of the must haves for me is their oyster shooters.  Nothing really special about them but they're a great price.  Plus they usually have 2 oysters per glass, better deal.  Oh, yah, don't forget the beer too.  If you have a meal book from the hotel they even cover some of the items they sell.  We went for happy hour one day when we were unloading all our shopping back at the room.  We decided to have some drinks and pupu.  We ordered their new flat bread pizza, deep fried calamari, spicy tuna maki roll, and their oyster shooters.  I had a Blackchip porter and my wife had a mojito.  The flat bread pizza was supposedly a new menu item.  It had good flavor but being a pizza lover I wished it had a more crispy crust.  Still, a good pizza.  Their deep fried calamari is really good.  Their batter is very light and very crispy.  Goes perfectly with their dipping sauce.  The spicy tuna roll was better than you'd expect from a bar in Vegas.  I've had better, but I'va also had worse.  The oyster were just as I remembered.  If you want to kick it up a notch you can also get it with a shot in each glass.  I passed.  I spiced it with a little of the calamari \"cocktail\" sauce, lemon, and tabasco.  I wished I had some Hawaiian chili pepper water from back home.  The wait staff is very friendly and attentive.  The second visit was later at night--about 2 am.  They were still bustling.  I got their Red Ale this time.  I ordered the 24oz and the waitress told me she'd get me a 16oz as it was on special for $2.  That's good customer service.  We also got the calamari again and  their artichoke dip.  The artichoke dip was good.  Had a layer of cheese on it.  It was thinner than I was used to having but it came with chips and garlic bread.  It was really good spread on the bread.  The calamari wasn't as good this time.  The peices were bigger and their was a puddle of oil on the bottom of the basket.  A turn off for my wife.  Other than that, it was overall a really good experience still.  I kind of wish I got more oysters but it was only our late night snack before bed.  Next time I'm back in Vegas, soon hopefully, you can be sure I'll be back here again.  Happy Eats!",

Give me a few glasses of house Chardonnay while you're at it, and I'm a happy girl. While I'm getting my buzz on, Hubs enjoys watching sports on the myriad of televisions above the bar.  I love the high ceilings in here - it feels so spacious and bright, which are rarities in dingy old downtown. (Don't get me wrong - I love downtown, but Encore and City Center it isn't.)  If you've never ventured downtown, you've never really seen Vegas. Leave the douches behind on the strip for a few hours and check out Triple 7 in Main Street Station. It's a nice change of pace.",

But the selection of beer is why you go to a place like this and they exceeded expectations with a spicy Hefeweizen. Service was fantastic especially when we told our server we had a play to attend. Will return and order a big ass burger and IPA.",

Twice that we had ate here, there was no line and got served right away. Besides the oysters, I had eaten the sizzling steak and the rib eye steak. The steak was cooked.the way I wanted it. Everything was so good. Why I rated a 4 star? Because when we got our bill, they had messed it up. We had the meal coupons and had used it. The manager had to step in and redo our bill. So we had to wait for them to fix it. We waited for I would say 15-20 mins. But overall, definitely come back when I stay in downtown and craving for them oysters.",

We did not care for the pretzel bites, they were too salty and the dip was okay. Overall, the prices were great. We got seated right away.

My review is based on the beer since this is the only thing I had. The food menu though, looked extensive and delicious. It is also important to note that they have a really good happy hour specials! We went to the 11:00pm-3:00am happy hour which consisted of $3.00 23 oz of their house made beer. Their regular price was about $1.50 more. I think their beer prices is really good and hard to beat on the Freemont area! I tried the Royal Red Ale and thought it was really good. My friends let me try theirs and I also thought they were pretty good beers. If you are in Freemont street and want enjoy a nice beer in a more relaxed environment I would recommend this place.",

    "text": "If I could give this place zero stars, I would.  The service is terrible and the food is even worse.  It does not matter how appealing the happy hour deals are, DO NOT GO HERE!!! For starters, after ordering, the waitress brought us the wrong beers. When we let her know, she offered to change to the correct beers if we tasted them and did not like it.  However she did not offer any rectification for the inconvenience.  Next the food came.  We ordered the pretzel bites, quesadilla and wings.  The pretzel bites were clearly frozen.  We might as well have eaten cardboard and the cheese hardly added any flavor. The wings were bone dry and the sauce was in a pool at the bottom of the basket.  The quesadilla, although being very simply cheese and tortilla, was the best part of the meal.   When the check came we were wildly overcharged for almost all of the mediocre food and our drinks, despite it being happy hour.  When we alerted the waitress, she corrected the price of the food items but the beer prices were still incorrect.  When we alerted her of the incorrect prices for a second time we also requested to speak to a manager.   This was apparently a mistake.  The manager, Audray, took 20 minutes to get to us, and when she arrived she gave us a story about having to come from across the street and was not even apologetic about it.  I proceeded to fill in the manager on the terrible experience that we had, the poor quality of food, the incompetent service.  Even though we waited twenty minutes for her, the best solution she could come up with was to comp our two drinks. We had a miserable experience and will not be returning to this establishment.   Save yourself the money and misery, eat anywhere else!!!!!",

    "text": "i went here early afternoon with my wife to have lunch with here. It was the first full day of March Madness so I expected it to be crowded. What I did not expect was to have to wait because a quarter of the tables weren't being used because they didn't have a server for them. One would think that with it being March Madness, a bar that is showing the games would be fully staffed.  The process of looking over the menu and ordering our food was pretty standard and went off without any hitches.   My wife ordered the Classic Cheeseburger well done and I ordered the BBQ Western Bacon Cheeseburger cooked medium. Our food was brought to our table and appeared to as we ordered it. However, my wife's burger was FAR from well done when she bit into it. We looked around for our waitress and noticed that all of the waitresses were huddled in one corner talking. Figuring that our waitress would be back momentarily to check on us, we decided to wait rather than waving her down from across the room.   ...And we waited...  ...and we waited...  As another waitress was passing by, we unsuccessfully tried to stop her. She did not even acknowledge us as she zipped by. Even the guests at the next table stated that there was no way that she did not see us. A few moments later we noticed her coming by again and attempted to stop her. This time, without even breaking stride, yelled out...\"YOUR server will be with you in a minute\"...as she zipped by again.   ...and we waited...  A little while later, long enough for me to have eaten half of my burger, our server did return and we explained the issue with the burger not being well done. She was efficient in getting another one made and bringing it out, but by this time I was pretty much done with my lunch.  The burgers we had were average bar food and enjoyable. The fries are your basic crinkle cut fries, which I love, and were cooked very well. Crispy outside and hot and tender inside. We did not have alcoholic beverages but the iced tea I had was brewed well.   All in all...Triple 7 Brewery is a microbrewery that can be a fun place to watch a game and have drinks. If this visit is indicative of the service though, I will pass.",

The female manager   Stated that they could not accommodate our party even though they had tables that could be pushed together so we sat at the bar. Which is fine for drinks but we didn't wanna eat our food up there. Pursley myself I think there is a better way of going about it if you're a manager of accommodating a large party and not saying that you cannot accommodate your guest anything is better especially since we could have waited a little bit if it would have made it easier so that she had a different server for the situation Maybe the area was not set for it but no she did not say that she just said she couldn't accommodate us. Very unfriendly very and, did not even try to explain poor management skills not a team leader. The bartender however was awesome took fabulous care of us And we appreciated his wonderful personality.  Now I do understand Because I used to work on the strip in a hotel. Most of the hotels in this town are  culinary Union , Being that each area must only have 5 tables at a time. But no one else in my party understood this and none of this was explained to them.  Once again poor management poor leadership. Unfortunately the rest of the people my group will probably never go back because one bartender doesn't cut it for an entire restaurant full of staff Sad considering the places actually a really cute little establishment.",

    "text": "What can be said about a restaurant that fits the classic stereotypical Las Vegas establishment? You know...the one where there is cheap shrimp cocktail, decent drinks, and service that makes you feel you are at a diner, yet not? Well those same emotions came to light at Triple 7 where I found the food comfortable, service just a tad lacking, and prices rather cheap.  The menu features an eclectic fare of American classics, sushi, and of course shellfish. Never thought I could get a prime rib at the same place I could get a California roll? In either case, the food wasn't bad but at the same time not great. It was decent. Nothing special. I found the oysters a tad gritty while the shrimp were on the smaller side.   Service was a little lacking. It took us awhile to get service once we were seated and while the food didn't take long to come, drinks went empty and it took awhile for water to refill.   Ambiance is comfortable with a town tavern type of feel. Seating can be a little tight so you might not want to have what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas conversations. Prices are very reasonable with entrees being in the $10-15 range and they offer some cheap drink options including evening $2-5 beers.  All in all, it is decent. Nothing truly great, however at the same time didn't disappoint.",

Tastes like a sweet tart   Bartender added 3 for me that are not part of the normal sampler: * IPA - pretty good  * HEFE - solid hef * Saisson - drinkable  Met some cool locals at the bar.  Definitely a friendly place.  I recommend going here.  Ohh.... and when nature calls, ask the bartender where you can find the Berlin Wall urinals at this casino (little known tourist attraction... definitely worth it)",

    "text": "I really WANT to like Triple 7.  It's the kid of place that is pretty cool to hang out with co-workers or take a time out from the action of Fremont Street.  The atmosphere is always good, service is usually pretty good - though some of the ladies are better than others (I've never had a male server there).  It's mere blocks from where I work, so it tends to be someplace we fall back on, but in the past few months, I haven't had great experience when branching out on the menu.  Nearly everyone has a favorite food and doesn't eat much else.  We like the salads, pizza, grilled chicken, sushi and most of the appetizers.   We keep going back because it's close, the drinks (at the Casino bar next to the buffet) are cheap and the service is pretty good.  They don't fret when 8 people come in all of a sudden and want a table.  If the food was better, they'd probably get 4 stars, but as it is, they get 2.  So... based on my experience - Do's and Don'ts  Do: Stop at the Casino bar before coming in - the drinks are cheaper (.99 Margaritas, $1.25 beer) Try the sushi - it's probably my favorite thing on the menu.  I've tried a variety of it and while the selection isn't huge, it is good. Have a salad or something else that you know the kitchen has to make.  Much of the food is frozen, but the fresh things are good.  Don't: Eat the burgers - they are frozen, premade patties that never taste good. Make it complicated - the kitchen doesn't take change well Try to get split checks - just come with cash if you're in a group.",

A seared ahi should be BRIGHT pink in the middle. If could tell right away this fish was previously frozen and not fresh at all. The salad was drenched in oriental dressing, and for some weird reason, i found ice cubes in it. The wonton strips were obviously fried in old oil, they were dark brown and tasted like fish. I could not eat it, just too gross.   My husband ordered fish and chips, which were drenched in oil... Coleslaw smelled rancid and was warm. Tarter sauce was not fresh, already had the glazed over look. My lil one had a cheesy bread appetizer which was also soggy and drenched in oil.   Server was not attentive, and VERY fake. This was my first time here and I will not be back.  Come on guys, it was about 2pm and there was not really anyone in the restaurant... Kick up your quality or fire your chef. Totally nasty food!",

This is a FANTASTIC alternative in the Fremont Street area.  You also can watch sports here too, and just feelin a chillax effect come over you as you hang out here.    The Attire: If you were business casual or something more classy than that, you will be expected to buy drinks for everyone less dressed up than you.  Come as you are with CASUAL as an expectation.  Consider: DON'T COME FOR THE MICROBREWS.  These are not great, and by far some of the weakest I have tried.  Coming from some experience of trying 200+ DIFFERENT beers, and having done beer tasting in San Diego, trust me on this.  Come here to hang out, get some grub and a drink, but not for beer tasting.",

    "text": "We enjoyed our meal here during our recent Vegas downtown experience.  Boyfriend wanted cheap prime rib, so he searched yelp and found this place.  He ordered a larger cut, so it was like ~$14 maybe (?) and scarfed it down.  I tried a bite and agreed that it was very tender and juicy.  Worth it.  I had the mahi dish.  Unfortunately the vegetable side is just one kind of veggie, and it happened to be grean beans.  I only like green beans if they are really fresh and these seemed a little wilted, so I didn't eat many.  Also, it came with a huge serving of white rice (seriously like two gigantic ice cream scoop-sized mounds), most of which I didn't eat either.  So I felt a little badly wasting the food.  If I'd known, I would have requested less rice and a side salad instead, or something.  Anyway.  Then the fish itself was overcooked and kind of dry.  I don't mind it being on the more well done side of things, but overcooked is going too far.  The only redeeming quality of the meal was the amazing pineapple salsa chutney sauce...I just slathered every bite of fish with the sauce and it made everything better!  Delish.  We loved the beer sampler (6 samples for $5.50!!  so cheap!).  I enjoyed the mango beer (although bf thought it was too sweet).  I also really liked the porter.  Bf liked the red and the pale ale.  So it was a perfect balance for the meal.  The atmosphere was like any brewery/restaurant..think Gordon Biersch.  But it was pleasant inside, lots of TVs, and the service was pretty good.  We'd definitely go back, and I would just order something different...probably sticking with the more traditional \"bar food\" or just getting a prime rib of my own. :)",

Although we originally came here for dessert, we ended up having a late-night second dinner. We ordered the garlic french fries, chicken wings and deep fried cheesecake. The garlic fries were VERY garlicky! They actually had chopped up pieces of garlic on top of them which I have never seen before. The wings are delicious! We tried the honey dijon sauce and the cajun sauce. Both were good. The deep fried cheesecake was also a hit.  The service here was great and the atmosphere was very laid back. The beers are also very cheap. You can't find prices like these anywhere on the strip. Also, if you happen to have coupon books from the California Hotel, they are honored here too. After using our coupons, we only paid for the cheesecake and 2 beers which came out to about $10. I think I'm starting to like Downtown Las Vegas..",

    "text": "Well, I love the beer and the food is pretty damn good as well. Brad is an awesome bartender and I really commend his patience dealing with the people he gets at late night hours.   But I do have a few problems with the joint. First off, I've been charged 3 different prices for the same 16 oz beers, which makes recommending this place difficult. I was telling my friend Main Street has $1.75 beers, because I was charged that before. The next time was 2-something and the next time was $3.50 a piece. Very confusing.   Also, being a restaurant that is in a hotel and doesn't offer room service, I find it very ridiculous they charge 2 dollars for every to go order. Since I know this, I usually order my food, eat a morsel and immediately ask for a box. Seems less efficient for them, considering now they have to clean my plates, and my seating area just because I was avoiding a $2 charge. It's not that I don't want to pay 2 bucks, but I think whoever is serving me deserves that $2 tip, not the restaurant.    Also, they will not take an order over the phone so you can pick it up. Not even for hotel guests, not even with the $2 charge. It is inconvenient and I'm sure has lost them plenty of money, as they just lost my business for dinner this afternoon.",

    "text": "Really terrible service. There was one woman in particular who was quite possibly one of the rudest servers/hosts I've encountered.  A group of roughly 20 of us arrived from a work meeting around 3pm, and it was not crowded. We were spread between the bar and high top area. Within about 30 minutes we were scolded  that we need to close our tab at the bar and open one with the server if we wanted to sit at the empty high-top tables near the bar. While she said this, 4 of us at the table had empty beers.   We waited 15 minutes for a server to come to ask us for our order, but they didn't, so I found the cranky woman and told her we were waiting for the server to come. She said 'you have to close your tab at the bar before you can order with us.\" I told her the bar tab was my bosses, we'll open another. She rolled her eyes and said she would send over a server. The server did not seem happy to be serving us. Soon after that, the cranky woman told our group to move our bags that were taking up a table (there were about 10 empty tables in the surrounding area, probably 20 empty in the restaurant). In addition, multiple people from our party made different comments about how rude she was.   The only reason I give this place two stars was because not all of the servers were rude, and the food/beer was not bad.",

However if you are ok with sitting at the bar you don't have to wait & can still order from the regular menu.  Food quality is pretty good. Ahi salad is a nice, light option if you don't want to feel stuffed. The Mediterranean chicken Salad is one of my favorites. Light, tasty & just the right amount of tartness in the dressing. My boyfriend loves their burgers, all of them. Burger fans should give it a try. Can't go wrong with the Flat bread pizzas & regular pizzas. Crust is thin & crunchy, perfect pairing with beer.  They offer take out orders but be aware that they charge a $2 service fee & the order must be placed at the restaurant; no phone orders.  Last tip, if you are a Boyd Rewards member & have a ton of points on your card, you can use the points to pay for your meals here! Just ask your server to check. If you use points they don't charge tax, either. It's a nice feeling to be fed for free after dropping too much money in the casino, haha.",

The beer is the star here but the food is okay too.  I tried a cup of the sirloin chili and was very impressed. It had a spicy, smoky flavor and used real shredded steak, not ground beef.   I had the half rack of ribs which was $9.99 and pretty good. Being from the south originally I'm very picky about bbq and these ribs weren't spectacular but they were  worth getting. They were tender but had a little more fat than you would get at most BBQ places. They came with good fries and green beans which honestly tasted canned and seemed to have a heavy butter flavor.   Overall I'd hit this place for some beer for sure and if you want to get some food it's not a bad place for that either.",

There are a lot of TV screens set up for sports and I was placed perfectly to watch two NBA playoffs games simultaneously. I thought it was interesting that there was a sushi bar in a section of the brewpub. I guess Main Street Station is trying to make the most use of its space.

    "text": "This little gem is located inside the Main Street Station Casino just off of Fremont Street. After leaving the Mob museum we walked over here because this is where I parked my car at to avoid the Mob Museum parking lol  We walked around and did a little gambling when we decided to grab a quick bite. The prices were very affordable and food was pretty tasty. Just by a stroke of luck we walked in about 15 minutes before the end of happy hour. We each had a 12 count order of wings for only 4.99 each! Wow! Good, solid wings too! Also had the hot Italian sub sandwich for 7.99 as well. That was really tasty too!  The service was friendly and attentive despite the fact that it was fairly busy and our drinks never hit the bottom of the glass. A big way of gauging service for me.   The atmosphere is great also. You have the brewery over on one side, TVs with sports scattered throughout, and that beautiful wooden decor that the whole casino has(which I'm definately a fan of).  A great find and I look forward to coming back next time I'm down on Fremont!  A solid 4 stars!",

The VIPA series offers up some very tasty IPA's, and the Chocoalte Cherry Stout is a must try. I recently had the Lemon Grass Kolsch and it was amazing. Very light and refreshing with a slight hint of citrus, and that earthy lemon grass flavor was subtle but still enough to really bring life to the beer.  Food is good but not spectacular, but go for the BEER!!!",

The service is always pretty good as well. If you enjoy craft beer, there's is a variety and all pretty delicious. They have seasonal beer, such as cheery stout and Mango Hefeweizen, which both delicious. They have included a \"infused\" beer specials and I recently had the mango Hefeweizen, which was a nice surprise since it is usually sold in the summer. I recommend this place is you are around Fremont street and are looking for a nice sit down dinner.",

    "text": "After a long day of conventioning and a long night of walking walking walking through downtown, we decided we needed some dessert and unfortunately, the ice cream shop in the California was already closed.  Darn it.   We decided to head over to the Triple 7 inside of the Main Street Station because the word was they had dessert.    When we arrived the hostess seemed put out by our party of 10 and said she would have to look for a table.  We glanced to our left and saw a long table with 12 seats and asked if we could sit there.  She said we could but if there were ten of us we'd have to all be on one check.  It seriously felt like she wanted us to leave.  We sat.  A server finally came by and got our drink orders and then after a while another server came by and told us she was back from break and could take our food orders.... drinks had yet to arrive.  I was very thirsty and asked if I could get a glass of water (which I had already ordered).  She told me the other server was placing that order. Soon after, the drinks did get delivered by server number two, however she started at the opposite end from me even though I was the one who asked.  A little longer wait and then the food arrived.  I had decided to get mozzarella sticks instead of dessert as nothing on the dessert menu sounded like all that.  When she delivered mine, I realized there were no set ups on the table, so I asked if I could get some napkins.  The server told me she'd get us silverware once she was done delivering food.  She finished delivering, went and got silverware and passed out one roll to each person... me last.  Then she walked away and came back with extra napkins which she dropped off at the other end of the table.  I was totally feeling invisible.  The mozarrella sticks were not that great.  hard and rubbery instead of melty and I shared them...  when I aksed for the bill, she dropped it off at the other end of the table, too.  So bizarre.  Overall, I had a good time with good company, but that was despite the service.",

    "text": "Decided to hit up the Triple 7 Brewery on a Friday night before beginning the Fremont Street festivities. I've eaten at the Main Street Station buffet many times and found it be one of the better budget friendly buffets out there. Unfortunately my experience at this venue was a far cry from it's dining counterpart at the Main Street Station.  We had a big party, 7 people, all hungry. It was Friday, so we expected a wait and were surprised when we were able to get a table quickly. The waitress was great. It took a little time to get our initial drink order, after that the service was flawless. Refills given before your mouth felt like the Sahara Desert, plates cleared quickly, and a friendly smile to go along with the prompt service. Too bad for her, the food the kitchen was putting out was sub-par.  So I ordered their classic cheeseburger, added avocado, and substituted onion rings for french fries. When the food came out the onion rings were barely above room temperature. They were soggy and literally had no flavor. Having had the misfortune in my youth of working as a dish washer at a restaurant I know a little about frying foods. This consistency only happens when something is fried, cooled, then fried again. No bueno. After a complaint to the waitress she brought a big stack of new onion rings to the table as several of us had ordered them. These were fresh and crispy. The burger itself was ordinary. Cooked okay, no great flavor, definitely expect more from a brewery. Everyone at the table at their meal, but no rave reviews. Prices are okay, definitely lower than the strip.  Fortunately this place is located near Fremont Street where I can drink my sorrows away and get some $1 fried twinkies.",

They don't have a wide selection of beers they brew, but we were pleased with the two we tasted; I had a seasonal selection that was tasty enough I ordered it again another time. We started our meal with a french fry sampler they have - three type of fries with three dipping sauces. It was actually pretty darned tasty. For the meal, my husband ordered the prime rib sandwich (like a french dip) and was very happy with it. I ordered the Cuban sandwich, and this sounds crazy, but it was overstuffed. There was so much deli meat in it, you couldn't really bite into it comfortably, and then you didn't really get a good taste of everything blending together, like you usually do with a good Cuban. Main issue seems to be the service is really hit or miss. Our visit visit in, the waitress seemed to disappear for stretches, and the place wasn't that busy. Another time, a group of us went in, sat at the table for a good 15 minutes and no waitress ever came to the table, so we left.",

Sathy T. and Tim C. from LA just happened to be in Las Vegas at the same time that I was. After I had finished my family duties, Tim, Sathy, and I agreed to meet in Downtown Las Vegas for after dinner snacks!   Triple 7 Restaurant & Brewery at the Main Street Casino was a logical choice.   Some of the features of this venue include the helpful and friendly service, free parking, convenient location, and cool atmosphere - is the variety of beers and good food!   BEER: Sathy ordered a Blonde Beer called the High Roller Gold.  She really enjoyed it because I didn't even get to taste it! Hahaha! Just kidding!  Tim's Dark Beer was the Blackchip Porter with hints of toffee and chocolate. The server offered him a sample first - that's great customer service!  He liked it and got the large glass. ..yay!  Because I liked it, too - which was a pleasant surprise. I secretly wished that I had gotten this beer, so I could have it all to myself... but Tim shared and I drank about half because it was so smooth and mellow!   FOOD: I was more hungry so I got the Dragon Roll sushi which was satisfying.  I liked the shrimp in the middle and unagi (eel) on the top. The combination tasted yummy to me!  Another pleasant surprise was the dozen Fresh Oysters. They were the most plump and meaty oysters I have ever had!  Our server said that the oysters came from Louisiana. Whoa!  Thanks to Sathy for sharing her rations - she only ate two so Tim and I had 5 each! Nom nom!   I have been to this restaurant in the past and I will continue to return - not only because they accept the coupons from our Vacations Hawaii meal coupon book - but also because of the reasonable prices and Aloha Spirit hospitality!",

Lots of seating, very spacious.   It was a big group of people I was with, so we had to wait a while. A few tables opened up and we just said screw it and grabbed them since all the big tables were still occupied. By the time we sat down for dinner it was almost 9 pm, I decided to skip dinner and just have dessert instead. I ended up getting the brownie sundae. Omg was this giant, it was a meal in itself and I ate the whole thing. The brownie was very very chocolatey but that's my fav, and I got four scoops of ice cream with whip, hot fudge and some cherries on top.   I definitely want to come back and try a meal there. The prices were really affordable, and you get a bunch of food.",

When I first realized this place was inside the Main Street casino it just seemed like a sports bar with decent food, that had crappy craft beer that I wouldn't spend $1.75 for a pint on. As the years have gone by I've noticed a big improvement in their beer, and even better food. Normally when I think of food in downtown Vegas it's garbage like fried Twinkies, cheap buffets, or some tough $2.99 steak and eggs.  My last couple of visits here I've gotten really good burgers for under $10, good steaks for under $20, and surprisingly great sushi that I would have never expected to get a place that's known for beer, wings, & burgers. With all the high end/mediocre expensive restaurants in Vegas it's nice to know there's still a place where you can get some good food without breaking the bank.",

    "text": "This review is only for the beer, AND i only tasted one of their many beers so take this review with a grain of salt, it's a very narrow review.  I'll be back to try more beers and update when i visit next time.  I've stayed at Main Street Station many times over the years, eaten at their buffets, gambled for hours many times but never tried their brewery.  As long as i can remember, even when i turned 21 there was a brewery in this hotel and casino but i was never really into beers until a few years ago when the whole micro brew scene took off.  So i finally have sort of a taste for what styles of beer i like and don't like.  While walking outside the casino, i saw signs for $2.50 craft micro brews from their brewery on the Casino bar.  I had never noticed where the bar on the casino floor was because i always got free drinks while gambling.  I found the casino bar just to the left of the buffet.  Im not sure what they charge in the actual Micro brewery and Restaurant, but it was closed at the time and $2.50 sounds like a great deal to me.  I ordered the Black Chip Porter ($2.50) it came in a plastic cup, I'm not sure what they charge in the actual Brewery/Restaurant or the size that you get in the restaurant vs the casino floor.  I took a few sips and i wasn't too impressed with it, i just didn't care for the flavor.  I like dark beers, porters, stouts and dark ales, but i just didn't care for this one.  I actually ended up tossing it out after drinking about a third of it.  With that said I'd still come back and try their other beers, the Pale ale, hefeweizen, and their High Roller gold light beer look promising.  So although i didn't like their porter, i still have high hopes for their other beers, which i'll try on my next visit.",

Fries were ordered for the table. They were delicious, both the sweet potato and regular fries were golden, crispy and hot. I tasted someone's onion rings which were very good.   One of the dipping sauces served with the fries was a sweet sauce that is a cross between BBQ sauce and ketchup. It was the best part of my meal! Some in our party ordered cups of chili. Their cup size is very large.  I ordered the fish tacos. Big mistake!  The fish was on a nondescript, limp flour tortilla, on a few pieces of shredded, wilted lettuce. I wonder who told the chef that wasabi should go on fish tacos? The fish, although battered and fried adequately, was unseasoned. I thought maybe they didn't season it because it was on a fish taco so I tried someone's fish from their fish and chips order. That fish was also unseasoned and tasteless.   Also the staff seemed to be having problems taking our orders in a timely manner. There were 8 in our party and it was a bit difficult flagging down waitresses and getting our drinks. They weren't even very busy that day. Prices are reasonable.",

Narrow it down and you can focus on quality. example.... I had half dozen oysters on the half shell. They were large, didn't taste fresh and looked funky actually! Safe to say I didn't eat them all. Just didn't look or taste right. The burgers they had looked good. Maybe next time I stop by I'll give one a try. The beers were pretty good! Price was good too.

Some of you probably can guess why one was chosen if you have been reading my reviews of the past month. That though is only half the story and I will tell the full spectrum of that story at a later time. We chose Triple 7 simply because they had a good overall score here on Yelp! They also had brews that I haven't heard of before. Like a Watermelon Hefeweizen! Well by the time we got there they didn't have the Watermelon Hefe anymore but they did have a Mango Hefe which I immediately ordered! This unusual Hefe went down smooth and tasted awesome. But only one beer allowed for this bird! The food at Triple 7 I could have take it or leave it. It is funny. Many people often say how good casino food is and how cheap it is. On this trip at least not so much. The food is mid priced I would say and often times is sub par to a regular restaurant outside The Strip.  I ordered a Taco Salad here and it tasted fresh enough but also seemed uninspired and didn't really have the TLC needed to make it a good dish. The guacamole also tasted a bit odd.  If Triple 7 didn't have such good beer I would not have been so generous on the star giving. The food didn't impress me and was one of my least favorite meals. But not the beer. Ho no!",

Triple 7 is a micro brewery... And I have to say, EW. I had the pale ale and well, it goes in tasting like Sierra Nevada and once it settles in your stomach, UGH!!! Horrible after taste! That alone prevents me from ever drinking any of their brews-- EVER.  The saving grace for this review NOT being a 1-Star review is the fact that the guacamole burger wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be!

During this trip, we visited the restaurant twice.    With the first visit, we ordered burgers (mom got the cheeseburger and I got the mushroom burger).  She opted for sweet potato fries and I got regular fries.  The burgers came out quickly and they were cooked the way we wanted.  Nothing too spectacular...  But on the second visit, we ordered their BBQ chicken pizza and an order of potstickers.  The potstickers were okay and came with a tasty sauce.  The pizza was awesome!  It was a bit bigger than one from CPK and was enough for the two of us to share.  There was just the right amount of chicken, onions, and barbecue sauce on each piece.    The atmosphere is somewhat noisy and it was hard to have a real conversation without yelling across the table.  There are various sports shows going on around the bar.    I know that we'll return the next time we come to Vegas.  I'll just order another pizza to try.",

Will eat lunch or dinner elsewhere. This is in a not so desirable part of town, wouldn't venture here at night.  Go during the day,enjoy some really good beers and get back to the good restaurants on the strip.",

A huge delay in getting a seated and you could see the servers were clearly overwhelmed and which I do understand but it's not really our problem they refused to hire extra staff.  Upon getting seated it was at least another 15 just to get an order in. When we finally got our food vegetables had clearly been frozen and were  still almost cold,  meat was not cooked correctly and just all-around a dismal experience. Go else where.",

    "text": "I've wanted to try this place for a while but never got over here on my last couple trips to Vegas. Well, I finally made it and I wasn't disappointed. This place has a large, open, airy atmosphere with glassed in areas so you can see the brewery. Their prices are much better than the typical gouging you get on the strip.  The Good: I loved their sirloin and black bean chili. The meat was tender, flavorful, and a refreshing change from the typical ground beef you find in chili. I like chili and this is one of the better versions of this dish I've had.    The Grilled Orange Roughy was nicely seasoned, without detracting from the flavor of the fish. The portion was good if not overly generous.    I'm a bit of a cheesecake snob so I wasn't sure about trying their deep fried cheesecake. Fortunately I decided to give it a shot. This was surprisingly good! They take a slice and cover it with a sugar tempura batter, then fry it. I suspect the cheesecake is either frozen or partially frozen before they fry it since the center was VERY cold, although not quite frozen. The crust is crisp and crunchy, giving the cheesecake a very different texture than I'm accustomed to. The flavor of the cheesecake itself was very good too, rich, smooth, and creamy.    I also tired the beer sampler which was a great way to try all the micro brews they had available. You get 5 5oz glasses for $6. All the beers were solid offerings, good and nicely balanced flavors. Despite this, there were no unique standouts that made me sit up and say wow. If you like your IPA's SUPER hoppy you'll be disappointed. Instead they went for a more tempered, balanced approach, which I certainly appreciated since I'm not an IPA fan.  The Bad: One of the sides I got with the orange roughy was rice and that's all it was, just white rice. They made no attempt to season it or do anything to it, just a pile of white rice. With all the other flavors going on everywhere else I thought this was a glaring omission. It was also something I didn't order, but I'll get to that next.  The Indifferent: The service was pretty good overall. Most of the time my waitress checked back regularly but there were a couple times where she seemed to disappear for a while (and they weren't particularly busy). The main reason I'm putting the service here is because she got my order wrong. The fish was supposed to come with the vegetable of the day and choice of potato. I chose mashed potato and got plain white rice. If the overall service had been just a little poorer I would have put it in the bad instead of indifferent.",

    "text": "My favorite place to eat when I'm staying downtown.  I very rarely go for traditional dinner in Vegas, so trips to The Chart House, Vic & Anthony's or Hugo's Cellar kind of go out the window.  Aside from that, I just don't want to spend a fortune on a meal when I'm going to spend the balance of my evening gambling, drinking, and wandering around Fremont St.    I usually wander over to the Triple 7 between 12 AM to 3 AM, and no matter what I've ordered, I've never had a bad meal there.  That's telling for me, because usually a place will have a few duds, and you just have to learn what not to order.  Trust me when I say the Triple 7 always delivers good food.  I read other reviews refer to this place as a gem, and they are correct.  It's what you want when you look to a meal you can enjoy at any hour.  Some of my \"Must Try\" recommendations are the Portobello Mushroom Sandwich, Triple 7 Wings (when you're taking down a few of their Triple 7 Brews), Monterey Chicken Sandwich, Fish & Chips, or my drunken go to: Baked Italian Sub.    Look, I could go on and on, if you're looking for a solid meal and you're downtown, this is by far the best place to eat at. Give it a shot....",

Please get your mind out of the gutter.  My 11 day work trip to Las Vegas lead me from The Strip to Old Las Vegas. It's definitely not a place to be \"seen in the scene.\" But \"Old Vegas\" has to be experienced. It's full of charm, character, and characters.   Seriously, the sun goes down and the weirdos come out to play. It's freaking awesome.  Anyway, this place provides good service, good food, and good service at great prices. What's not to like about that?  The menu has a variety of dishes and house brews. There is something on the menu for everyone. And it's all super cheap. My meals consisted of the fish and chips, fish tacos, and a bacon cheeseburger. It was good, good, and super good.  Speaking of good, the service was as well. The servers were helpful, patient, and never screwed up an order, even if we had a party of 8 or more. Nice.  Anyway, if you are off The Strip and exploring Old Vegas, this is an inexpensive dinner option. And the variety of beer will keep the drinks flowing and the party going.  Viva Las Vegas.",

    "text": "One of many restaurants that does honor the Boyd's travel meal coupon.  This restaurant is located in the Main Street Hotel, we have been to Main Street countless times, usually travel with my mother in law, and she doesn't care for the \"bar\" type of environment so we could never eat here having her with us.  This particular travel, it was just me and my mister, so we were excited to give this place a try finally.  We visited the restaurant everyday during our stay at a near-by hotel.  Items we ordered during our many visits included, sushi, cheese burger w/blue cheese, chicken wings, a creamy chicken pasta dish, garlic bread, pepperoni pizza, strawberry short cake, and the main reason for our repeat visit is the root beer float!    My mister and I did not like any of the foods, none of it! the creamy chicken pasta looked good, but it was sooo bland!, I gagged after my third scoop.  The pasta noodles was way over cooked, the sauce tasted like thick cream with no taste, hardly any chicken but they did give a lot which I wasted 90% of.   I've had better frozen pepperoni pizza and didn't care to the leftovers with us. The strawberry shortcake was huge, how can you go wrong with a ssc? Well, sadly, we didn't care for this either.  The cake portion tasted kind of weird, almost like a corn bread texture and look, but a bit sweeter.  I can't recall if the strawberry's were fresh or frozen?  Hardly ate any of it.   My mister ordered the sushi, and had a bad craving for sushi, ate a couple, and said he tasted better from Costco, pre-made sushi, sitting in the refrigerator.   Good thing we were using our meal coupons, so it didn't bother me too much.   BUT!!!, let me tell you! The ROOT BEER FLOAT, is the best I have ever tasted.  The vanilla ice cream is served in a chilled frosty tall mug, and the Henry Weinhard root beer is left in the bottle.  One serving of this delicious RBF is enough for both of us.  This is usually the only item that we have to pay for.  So refreshing, and satisfying, even on a cold winter night haha.",

I ordered the Sante Fe salad. My salad was good but when I got it I noticed there was no cheese on it and I thought that maybe I read the menu wrong, so I asked the bartender if I could get a side of cheese for the salad and he kind of acted shocked and shrugged his shoulders and said ok.. well he charged me 1.25, no problem if I'm asking for something that's not an ingredient on the menu but I later looked up the menu online and there it  was in the description... jack cheese....   Ugh... I want to like this place but I don't like to be charged for something I didn't receive the first time... oh well. Just be sure to check your tab and the menu is my advice.   --- I wasn't sure if I was going to come back here but my husband was starving and didn't want to wait for the Sunday brunch at the buffet.   We ordered the trio fries and potstickers for appetizers. Hands down so good. Fries were so hot and crispy and the dipping sauces were great. Pot sticks yum!   Hubby got the Cuban with onion rings and I got the Katsu sliders with potato salad. Both were decent, maybe a little dry but I loved the potato salad. So good.   We also had 3 stoli $4 mules each and wow strong and amazing. I wish they were a little more ginger and lime but the man loved them a lot lol   Once again, I checked the bill like last visit and was charged for an extra mule, easy fix but like I mentioned in the last review, check your check and make sure everything adds up before paying.   Better experience and food this time so I'm glad I was able to try them again.",

You can't go wrong with anything you order.  I eventually went with the prime rib dish myself. We were shocked how fast our food arrived, and my friends and waitress kept laughing because no one could get a peep out of me after that. I was busy! Shout out to the fried cheesecake as well.  P.S. Don't forget to have them validate your parking for you before you leave and save yourself $10.",

Triple 7 is located inside the Main Street Casino downtown in Vegas. It is a short walk from the Fremont Street Experience and is always a hustling busy spot to watch t.v. or a sports game while you grab a bite and take a brake from gambling. They have a grill and offer every type of burger you can think of. They also have a full bar so if beer isn't your thing, no worries. They got you covered. The service can vary depending on how packed the room gets. Come in with a casual vibe and you wild be just fine!",

Still didn't like the IPA (I don't think I ever will) but the porter we got in the flight was great! And of course we loved the high roller gold.

Given a very small per diem, I was looking for a nice steak dinner without the strip prices. My fellow Yelpers recommended the 777 Brewery, and I'm glad they did!  We started with drinks, a Black Chip Porter and Sis had a mojito. Both were tasty. The porter was a bit mild, but had a light, smooth, nutty taste. Sis said her mojito was very good. Next, we had the pot sticker app and it was awesome, one of the best I've had. I then had a \"side salad\" that was the size of a meal, so we split that. Finally, our 16 oz rib eyes came out. They were delicious! Sis had a perfect rare and mine was a perfect med rare. Baked potato was awesome, the side veg was the only meh part of the meal. I was so full, it didn't matter. My only disappointment was I couldn't take my leftovers home.  Our total bill was $56!  After dinner, we walked the two blocks back to Fremont Street for more fun. Oh, and the casino was fun too!  If you want a get off the strip and have a great meal, head over to the 777 Brewery!",

Just a few days ago my partner and I went to check it out, we were excited to check out a new place. It took about 15 minutes for us to be seated which was normal, though we will say the hostess was just randomly placing people where ever she would find a place, we sat down for a few minutes and our waitress comes over and says \"I'll be right with you\", we were okay with that, until it turned into 20 mins of waiting just to get our drinks at least. Well when she took our drink order we took advantage and ordered our food (a burger and a sandwich). Well minutes go by and everyone seems to just be attending to this bachelorette party, the waitress comes back about 40 mins later apologizing about the delay but offered us some soup. We waited it out but it was now an additional 35 mins, and this point I was bothered because all we ordered where some sandwiches. So I decided that this was to ridiculous so we left. I was just so amazed of how that went down. I wish it would have been better honestly.",

My 10 year old son had the half pound hot dog.  It was huge, he could only finish half of it.  My husband tried the teriyaki chicken sandwich.  He said it was good but on the small side.  I also tried one of my daughter's BBQ ribs.  It fell off the bone and had some flavorful sauce basted on it.  The service was attentive despite the fact that none of us ordered any alcohol.",

Things were looking good so far as my friend and I made our way past the low limit tables and surly old gamblers toward the brewery. We were there on a Saturday night and the place wasn't all that busy. We decided to sit at the bar for dinner; easier access to the brews was my logic.  The selection is what you expect from any brew pub...a blonde, a brunette, a red head; yes I'm talking beer still. The entrees are subpar to say the least. The steak was not seasoned and the pork chop was very thin and tough; sawing through that was quite a feat.   Bartender service; and I use that term very loosely:  very poor. 3 bartenders, 8 patrons at the bar including us. It took 10+ mins to be greeted and when we were it was not friendly at all. The bartender had to go back and forth between us and his POS for each item we ordered.  Really, you can't remember 2 simple orders for gods sake? How about a pen and paper to make up for your lack of memory or listening skills?  They never once checked on us during our meal. Was it because they knew the repsonse already? They never once offered us another beer.  Let's do some basic math for those following along; usually the higher the bill the higher the tip, no?  Finally, we are presented with the bill...finally we can leave and forget about the poor excuse for a bartender. Have you ever seen this?  Now he hovers in front of us waiting for us to tip/total and sign. Haha the joke is on you; you can stare us down all you want. You see, we don't like math either and the bill total plus ZERO tip is easy math. Get a clue...or better yet, a job that doesn't require customer interaction, common sense or the listening skills that even a 6 year old can handle.  One day, I'm going to see this guy standing on Fremont begging for money...yes, I will chuckle to myself, maybe a little out loud too.   100% service fail leads to 1 star; your mediocre food and decent atmosphere is worth 2 stars but your staff brings you down to the lowest rating allowed by Yelp. I don't make the rules here; if I did you'd receive 0 stars.",

    "text": "PATHETIC. This place has gone from bad to worse in a matter of months. Wish I could give you Zero stars.   I decided to give 777 another chance since my review back in March. I wish that I didn't.   As I said in my prior review, the best thing here are the microbrews. Correction, the best thing about 777 WAS the microbrews. I ordered a High Roller and immediately noticed that it did not look the same. It used to be a golden color, now its more of a red/brown.  I asked the bartender whats up with the beer and he said that they got a new brewmaster. The High Roller tasted nothing like before. The bartender said that many people have been complaining and offered to give me a different kind. I went with the Black Chip. It tasted like right (must have been an old batch before the new guy came).   I ordered a burger and ate it at the bar and also ordered some korean tacos to-go. A few minutes went by and I noticed that the bartender quickly swap out my bill with a new one. I looked at it and he was charging me $2 because I was taking some food to-go. WTF? The bartender said he can't do anything about it and said he can get the manager. Yes, do that I requested. The manager came out and I told him that I have been coming to 777 for 15 years and and this place has fell to $hit. I told him the food prices went up considerably and the quality has never got better. I also mentioned that the beer is not the same. He said its a different color but should taste the same. What?? This guy is clueless. Get a clue and rename your beers something else, and not try to pass off $hit as diamonds to your customers.  I finally mentioned to him about nickel and dimeing me for $2 because I wanted to take an order home. He took the $2 off but still.  I am NEVER EVER COMING BACK.",

A huge burrito is enough for two people or some for diner and some for lunch tomorrow. Pizzas are o.k., but could use a bit of improvement taste wise. Service is fast and friendly.

The restaurant was very busy (about 7pm), but we were seated immediately without any delay.  There are long bars on each side of the room with seating in between.  Our server came right away, delivered menus, and took our drink orders.  They offer a sampler of 5 or 6 different micro-brews you can get for $5.50.  Two of us ordered this sampler.  I enjoyed all the varieties, but I think I like the \"Royal Red\" brew the best.    The menu was quite varied.  I ordered the pale ale ribeye, medium well.  Sides were baked potato and green beans.  I also ordered an appetizer of fried calamari.  The calamari was some of the best I've ever had.  Generous portion, very crispy and light.  My steak came out more on the medium rare side instead of medium well.  I almost sent it back, but I don't really like to complain so I went ahead and ate all but the very center.  The sides were just okay.    Overall, the food wasn't bad, the drinks were great, and we enjoyed the lively atmosphere and the casino/hotel itself as well.  Will be going back again next year.",

The fries were ok but got cold fast. My bf ordered the bacon cheeseburger with the onion ring in it.. forget the technical name on the menu for it but it was good but he said he wouldnt order it again b/c it was so messy. I told him just to take out the onion ring.. problem solved :) oh and the bbq sauce.

Fast forward to December 2010, I was really hungry and ordered the extra large prime rib.  It was not much bigger than the regular portion and was dry and tough.  I ordered it medium rare and got a medium.  Added on the soup for a few dollars more and got a teacup size portion of really crappy soup.  Needless to say, portion control was strickly enforced and left me still very hungry  So hungry I ordered an appetizer, hot crab and artichoke dip.  It was like soup.  Need not say more.

I read yelpers review of this place and couldn't believe it was less expensive and higher rated than the Country Club at Wynns (one of my personal favorites).  Well it is good but it is no CC.  They shouldn't even be in the same category (American traditional).  But the truth is, it is way better than most places I have been to in Vegas.  The Nachos were crazy yummy and paired perfectly with their Pale Ale.  I'm a bit of a microbrew snob but their Pale Ale was very flavorful and hearty.  It is inside Main St Casino which is not a bad place although I decided to drive over to the Nugget from there instead of walk even though it was just about 3 blocks.    The food is above average.  The service slightly above average but for some reason they were very slow on bringing me the check.  In their defense, they were getting busier really quickly.    This would be a good place to catch the game and hang with friends.  All the amenities of a heavily TV'd sports bar but with real food.  I think the Country Club is substantially better this Triple 7 is far better than most places in Vegas.  Very nice!",

Menu was extensive as ever, with new items that I did not remember (i.e. beer battered tekka-maki - sounds pretty interesting, if not defeating the purpose of tekka-maki).  Anyway, I had a mediterranean chicken sandwich on ciabatta, with greens, roasted red pepper, balsamic, etc...  It was really good, flavorful, fresh, and had a huge roasted red pepper on it.  Came with fries, but I upgraded to onion rings for $1 more.  When the sandwich came, it had fries on the side.  Waitress corrected it quickly (left the fries but I did not eat them), onion rings came out fresh, and were very good, hot, with a good beer batter.  Will plan to coming back for happy hour to try the beer again, and other things.  Great varied menu, and really nice classic space in a classic casino design.",

    "text": "Amen for great service.  First time here.  Mahalo to our waitress Kawehi for taking the time to answer some questions we had.  For an appetizer we ordered the Nachos Grande ($9).  A good size for 2, maybe 3 people.  My wife and I also got a beer sampler ($7) 5 5 oz glass of some of their own brews.  Not bad.  For entrees I got the Prime Rib ($16) which came with soup or salad, steamed veggies and a starch.  In my case I got fries.  The wife got the San Francisco burger ($11) with the Vegetarian option of using a portobello mushroom instead of a beef patty (no additional charge) which came with a side of Onion Rings (+$1).  Way too much food.  We had no idea it'd sooooo much food.  We weren't able to finish it all,  Thankfully they provided boxes for us.  Because we were visiting with Vacations Hawaii we were able to use our coupon books and our final bill came out to about $18.  Not bad in my opinion.  Even if we had not used the coupons, I still think the value was there, especially with the great service.  The ambiance is pretty melo with TVs televising sporting events live.  Lighting is dim, but we were cool with that.  Everyone around us seemed to be having a good time which made the experience even better.  It was also nice seeing staff sing happy birthday to a young lady on a table next to us.",

I decided to go to the bar and get our food from the bartender and she got confrontational and asked if I had a problem.. super threatening like she wanted to fight me!!! Unbelievable!!! My friend called me down and we went a head with our order.. we ordered prime rib Haha it was a piece of over cooked stake .. 30 minutes in the restaurant and nobody offered even a glass of water . Never ever again will come back at this place. Be aware the server's name was Ashley.. dont ask for to much.. she may get overwhelmed and kick your ass.. the manager ... uh we never met her... even though the whole restaurant was aware of how she acted .. customers looked .. people turned heads.. anyways .. we didnt see her.

The server was sympathetic but most of it was out of her control . I went here with my friend we are both from northern Minnesota and don't have these \"fancy\" places but if this were to occur at any of our restaurants we would be compensated and then some .

People that come here seem to mostly be local residents and patrons of the California and Main Street hotels.  Two, the last time I came, there was a COFFEE infused beer and I love coffee to no ends. It was amazing while my drink was cold and first came from the tap, however unfortunately as the night went on, it got less tasty and grosser to drink. I know it's not normal for beer but I wish it had come in a smaller glass to keep the drink fresh so when I wanted more, I could get a fresh batch faster.",

    "text": "We went during lunch for my mom's birthday. We decided to go here since we had a coupon or gift certificate from Main St casino. We didn't have any beer, so this review is just for the food and service.   Nothing really special about it, except the dessert... the deep fried cheesecake.   It was good, but not good enough to plan an exciting adventure to this dessert, (check out some of my other reviews, I've had a few adventures ;) )   Service was ok.  Food was bleh-ok. So-so.   The waitress we had seemed to be waiting on ALL the other tables on our side of the restaurant. It wasn't packed, but it wasn't empty. There were two waitresses working during a Saturday lunch time. I can see why it wasn't packed. We didn't get any rude service, but didn't get any great service. She didn't check on us enough to be qualified as great-excellent service. Other than taking our order & giving us the check, she checked on us maybe... twice. She seemed like she was just there. Just there for work. Sorry, that won't score you a good tip.   We ordered calamari, the fries, a few dishes, some sushi, and the cheesecake. All of it was okay so-so.   Nothing great about the calamari or fries, fries came with a few dipping sauces. The seasoning on the fries seem to separate from the fries. That doesn't make the fries tasty. The calamari was so-so as well.  No one at our table really liked the dish they got. It was all just okay. Nothing bad. Just so-so quality. I got the fried sushi roll, there was nothing tasty about it. I've had fried rolls before (at breweries/bar type places) and they were delicious. So I was disappointed with this one. I've been to other non-Japanese or non-Asian breweries and bar type places that have good sushi.   Other dishes we ordered were philly cheesesteak it was okay. My brother barely ate half of it. My other brother ordered fish and vegetables, he said it was bland. He only took a few bites and didn't eat the rest. And they usually eat a lot!   We ordered the caterpillar roll, but the waitress gave us a california roll and charged us for caterpillar roll. (it's a few dollars more than a california roll.)   She apologized for it, and changed our bill, but again... she just seemed like she didn't care to serve us (or maybe be at that job.) Who knows...   The fried cheesecake was good, my first time trying it, so I'm glad that was more than okay. But it was just good, not great. Maybe that's also because of the disappointing service and all the other food we had while there.   No one really enjoyed their food, so we probably won't be here again.   If I ever go there again, I'm gonna have to try the mango brew.  They didn't offer us any beer menus so how was I suppose to know?",

But... the beers weren't great (on the scale of ok to poor) although the double down hefeweizen was on par with the style. My friends had the San Francisco burger and the prime rib sandwich and we're happy with those. Waiter was very friendly and no complaints about the service. Giving 2 stars because it's a brewery and should have better house brews in my opinion.",

In this case, it was their strawberry sour.    It's a good intro sour for people who don't drink sours.  Not to over the top.    Unfortunately the rest of their beers are mediocre at best and you'll find yourself wishing you just went to a bar instead.",

    "text": "Located in the Main Street Station Hotel and Casino, Triple 7 is my go to restaurant. First off, the ambience is great. There are around 10 flat screens around the entire resto which means that you can watch your favorite sports game from any spot. Secondly, they have a flight of their signature beers ( Five 5 oz glasses) for $5.99!  I've come here many times and have tried the following: triple 7 wings (honey-dijon), caesars salad, cheezy garlic bread, black angus sliders, fried calamari, hot crab and artichoke dip, french onion soup, chicken ciabatta sandwich, korean tacos, blackened salmon, bbq ribs, ribeye steak, prime rib, and....yeah i think thats it.  My go to dish is the blackened salmon served with a pineapple chutney, fresh veges, and rice. I love the spicy and sweet combination of the dish. My wife loves their honey dijon chicken wings. I always bring visitors here bc the food here is a good mix of american comfort food with some asian influence. The only things I would say that are not so good is that the crab and artichoke dip had imitation crab and the chicken ciabatta sandwich had a little too much bell pepper. They have lunch specials of which their rotisserie chicken was moist and tasted way better than the chicken you buy in sam's club. Love this place....oh ya, did i mention that you can use your aloha coupon book here and they have happy hour specials too?",

The \"angus\" sliders were tiny even for sliders and thin as a McDonald's hamburger patty, the bun looked like and felt like a Hawaiian roll but tasted like thick doughy nothing. To top it all off they only give you 2. I've ordered sliders many times in my life but and sometimes its 4 burgers most of the time 3 but 2!? Anyway they were terrible. The poppers were fine since it's basically impossible to screw up but at 5 bucks for 4 measly poppers its no deal at all. To top it off I had to wait 10+ minutes staring down the barkeep to close out the check. I get that he's busy and not his fault but it just added to the frustration. Anyhow never thought spending 10 bucks plus tax would make me feel so ripped off but it did.",

The burger itself is thick and juicy, smothered in a tasty barbecue sauce, and garnished with roasted red peppers, onion rings, and Monterray Jack cheese. It was perfect. It's been several days since I ate it and I'm still thinking about it. A cheeseburger, that is. I'm still thinking about a goddamn cheeseburger. That just doesn't happen.",

The restaurant itself is updated but still maintains a cozy feel with tall ceilings and a lot of wood and brick.  The micro brews are surprisingly good. I don't mean to hate on Vegas beers, but when a restaurant offers a flight of five 5 oz pours for $5.99, you prepare for the worst. My flight came in a wooden holster and contained four of the regular beers and one seasonal flavor. I can honestly say that they were all very good.  The food is typical bar fare with a lot of burgers in the $7 to $8 range. Nothing is great but the prices are fantastic, so I'm not complaining.   As you might expect, the main draw of Triple 7 is the craft beer. If you go, definitely focus on the drinks and limit the amount of food.",

On my recent trip, I ordered 6 oysters on the half shell (comes with horseradish & cocktail sauce) and fish n' chips. The oysters we're very fresh & my family & I took one each & cheered to being in Vegas. The fish & chips we're pretty good as well. The fish meat was very soft, yet flaky, and the batter wasn't too thick, but not too thin. One thing I would recommend is the philly cheesesteak & an iced cold brewski!

    "text": "I was really disappointed with our latest visit to Triple 7.  It had become a staple on our annual Vegas excursions, thanks to its casual atmosphere, friendly service, and good food for the price.  Unfortunately, our latest experience left a lot to be desired.  The food was a mixed review.  I thought the smothered potato chips were awesome (even though my bf didn't care for the white cheese sauce on them).  I can't believe that the Angus sliders were actually Angus -- they tasted like the meat from my grade school cafeteria, kind of spongy and weird.  Plus, it was odd that they only gave us toppings for two burgers (two pickle slices, two tomato slices, etc.) when there were three burgers.  The cup of chili was so tiny that we thought they brought us corn chips and dip by mistake, but to their credit, the chili was very tasty.  (We'd had the bowl of chili before -- it's a much better value for only a couple bucks more.)  The entrees tasted great and were plentiful servings, but my only gripe was that the ahi salad only had one small piece of avocado in the whole thing.  The main problem was the service.  We were seated promptly, but our server was obviously overwhelmed.  She was apologetic at first, and having worked in food service, I am generally sympathetic, but at points, our server was nowhere to be found.  Drinks came 15 minutes after our appetizers.  Tables around us turned over twice by the time it took to get our entrees.  We requested to-go containers at the time we got our entrees, having waited so long that we'd lost our appetites, and we waited another 15 minutes before I walked over to another server's station and asked for some.  I ended up walking up to someone who I think was the manager (who was dealing with another customer who had waited endlessly to order) to get the check.  Just inexcusably slow -- about 1.5 hours for just appetizers and entrees when we already knew what we wanted to order.  I've had much better experiences here before, so I hope the most recent one was just the exception and not a trend.  I'd still give Triple 7 another shot the next time I'm in Vegas.",

We had a few dishes...stiffed tomatoes, the black and blue burger in a lettuce bed instead of a bun, the chips and cheese appetizer ( DELICIOUS) onion soup and the cheese steak. We all enjoyed our meal.  My husband is a beer snob and he tried the beer flight.  4-5 oz samples for $5.  He really enjoyed 3 of the 4 and bought a full growler to take with him.  My dad who is 73 lives in summerlin and had never been to this place and was pleasantly surprised and said he plans to come back.   Per the signs on the walls they have won numerous beer awards.   The brewing machines are visible which was interesting and there are also TVs on with baseball.  It didn't smell like smoke which is a nice plus.  We would go back.",

We came here on a recommendation from a friend, and was one of the reasons we came downtown in the first place.   We started with the fried mushrooms that were tasty and PLENTIFUL, at a great price. When we found out the soup was New England clam chowder, my husband HAD to order it for the sheer curiosity factor of how they would do clam chowder in the desert. The answer: Not well. There were carrots?? in it, and it was so thin. The taste wasn't bad, but   doesn't get the Bostonian seal of approval.  My husband had the fish and chips which were HUGE, and the cole slaw was actually really tasty. He said the fish was great, not greasy or heavy. I had a cheeseburger, and it was solid. I had onion rings with it, and they were solid but a little too much breading.  I had the Hefeweizen and it was AWESOME, and a huge glass was less than 4 bucks. My husband liked his choice as well.  Overall, a nice change of pace from the overpriced stuff on the Strip!",

Every year to kick off the weekend, we go to a brew pub and partake in a feast!    We used to do this at the Monte Carlo Brew Pub on the strip until some idiotic executive from MGM Mirage decided that Brew Pubs don't actually need to brew their own beer.  Since then however, I'm happy to say we found the 777 downtown!    If you don't frequent downtown, then maybe you should!  The relaxed atmosphere, reasonable prices, and friendly people make it a welcome alternative to the over-priced \"hip & trendy\" Strip.  If you're turned off by the $25 \"apple-tini's\" and gaggles of Paris Hilton wannabees of the Strip...then simply hail a cab and set a course downtown to the Triple-7!!!   The atmosphere is awesome, service is wonderful, the food is great, the prices are very reasonable, and most importantly....the beer is amazing!!!  Definitely worth the trek downtown!!",

    "text": "I had family come into town to visit another family member who is temporarily stationed at Nellis for the next month. My uncle and his wife are from small town America...very small town. My uncle has ventured out into the world a few times when he was in the service, but his wife has traveled mostly within the the midwest and south. They wanted to take us to dinner, and wanted to stay on Fremont as that is where their hotel was.  After debating between Chicago Brewing Co and Triple 7, we decided on Triple 7 as it had been almost 5 years since the last time we were there.  We arrived and had to wait in line for about 20 minutes. It was Friday night and the place was hopping. We didn't mind waiting as it was a good time to catch up.   Once we were seated, the waitress helped us immediately. Over the course of the night, the waitstaff was really friendly and very helpful. For drinks, my self and my cousin ordered a couple micros. I had my traditional Red (the Royal Red Lager) and he had the brewmaster's special (an IPA). Later I had the sampler...but I will get to the beer in a second.   The menu had a few veggie options, which was totally unexpected. They also had a presumingly vegan option (veggie sushi). I had the roasted veggie sandwich, and the wife got the veggie sushi. My family had burgers and chicken fingers. My sandwich was very good, a little messy by the veggies were roasted quite nicely and the fries were pretty amazing. It was like having 2 sandwiches, which is why the wife and I shared. The veggie sushi (avocado, carrot, red pepper) was very tasty as well.   On to the important part, the beer. The Royal Red was pretty light (similar to a Killian's). It was malty, but not too strong. It went down smooth, but not the best local red I've had. I also had the sampler. Overall the beer quality was pretty average. The pale ale had a nice wheat aftertaste, and was pretty smooth. The IPA was hoppy, but more earthy than anything else. Admittedly, I usually don't like IPA's, but this one I disliked for the earthy flavor, not the hoppiness.   Overall, this was a good choice. We would definitely return for the food. I wouldn't come just for the beer, but it was decent, and I would support the localness of it.",

I've been here before and the fish was pretty good, so I was extremely disapppointed.  The baby back ribs was decent.  The meat fell off the bone and the sauce wasn't too bad.  The cheesy bread was decent, nothing special, just cheese and pizza dough below it.",

    "text": "We decided to stop by here for lunch recently.  I had the Portobello Burger, which has a giant portobello in place of a hamburger.  It was quite nice actually, and if you like mushrooms, I highly recommend it!  My friends had some dishes that they didn't quite like though, including the personal pizzas, which were not unlike most generic casino pizzas, and the fish tacos.  The dining area is very large, and can accommodate the largest parties.  The walls are lined with various awards that they have received for their beers.  The brewery itself is clearly visible through the glass walls.  We watched a brewer do some house cleaning while we enjoyed our beers.    Speaking of beer, the reason to come to the Triple 7 is the microbrewery.  I ordered the porter, which was a nice stout.  It was very smooth and tasty.  It paired well with my burger.  I also ordered a sampler of the other beers.  The Stout IPA they had specially for this season was also a really good beer.  I wouldn't say its the best stout that I have had, but the extra hoppy bite that it had was quite nice.  I wasn't impressed with the other brews, however.  The red ale was more of a light beer with a red ale tint to it.  The blackcherry stout was a sweet, cough syrup thing.  Non-beer drinkers might like that one.  The other light beers aren't really worth mentioning.    Any brewer who experiments with craft beers in Vegas deserves a good review though. In my opinion, the food was good enough to come back for the beer.  Stick to the stouts though, as that seems to be the Triple 7's specialty.",

I also tried the nachos which is like an entree itself not an appetizer, and the wild mushroom pizza is also gooood.  Another awesome thing about 777 is that they brew their own beer.  I had a beer sampler (five 5-oz samples of all their microbrews: gold, pale, special, red, dark)  The gold and red beers were awesome!  Definite yummy.

There are TV's throughout and are typically tuned to sports.  If there's a game on you want to watch specifically, just ask, they'll put it on for you.  My beer drinking friends say their brews are fantastic and they don't skimp on the mixed drinks either.   The service is great, everyone is friendly...which is a rarity in this city and it's pretty quick too.  Open 24/7, great prices, great food.",

    "text": "My favorite brewery in Las Vegas! The place is nice and great place to hang with homies for amazing Brew and food. The menu ranges from Bar food to comfort food to fresh made sushi. They have something for everyone. If you get there for happy hour, they have 50% of appetizers and micro brew. The Meatball Sliders are amazing. 3 sliders on a warm bun, smothered in a rich and tangy sauce and dripping with melted cheesy goodness. The fries are crispy and salty the way a fry should be. The wings are awesome. I prefer them extra well done. Nothing worse then biting a wing and the damn thing is bloody. We been there so many times, i can go on and on about the food. The beer is incredible. They take time and pride in their batches. Barleys Beer is ok but pales in consideration. Chicago Brewing company comes in 2nd to Triple 7 Brew. They have their signature beers and tend to add 1-3 new flavors monthly-Bi Monthly. The Black Cherry Cream is awesome. You can taste the Cherry and so smooth. The higher content beers like Monique can put a spin to your dome when you drink a couple lol. When your done grubbing, head over to the bar in the casino. You can get a pint of Micro Brew for $1.75. Cheap compared to anywhere else. Check them out and give them a try. If your a beer lover, it wont disappoint. Until next time, Let's Eat!!",

It better be, it's made right there. Give me 3 of these and i'm set for the evening. I have tried the other house brews but I'll stick to the Blackchip. The prices are really decent but so is everything in Downtown. I can order a philly cheesesteak, 3 beers for under $16.00. I f I could only live here. Triple 7 also takes vacations hawaii meal coupons. I have actually used 2 meal coupons and got my dinner for free. The waiter hooked me up so I had to hook him up with a nice tip.  My wife loves their pizza but I'll stick to the oily foods. Taste so much better. Love you 777........",

    "text": "I just got a hankering for a Vegas trip again, which reminded me that I never reviewed Triple 7. How can that be? Oh yeah, it's probably because I had a few too many of those amazing microbrews and had a slight lapse in memory.   I had some Vegas pals always telling me that this was THE place to go for cheap dinner and amazing beer, and I always would reply, \"Don't bother me. I'm playing blackjack.\" Well, one day the blackjack dollars ran out a bit too quickly, so off to Triple 7 we went. And we were pretty famished (and sober) when we arrived, so we went to town on that menu...Meatball sliders, garlic fries, nachos grande, Prime Rib ($10!!), and, of course the microbrew sampler - you get five 5oz pours for $5. Can't beat that!  When the food starting arriving all six of us got a look of dread in our eyes, thinking, \"Dear lord, what have we done?\" If Vegas is about excess, than we sure as hell were doing something right, because this was a MASSIVE amount of food...and mostly pretty damn cheap and amazingly tasty too.   The beer? Ah, the beer. It's so good when it hits your lips. It really is. The Porter was my fave, but the night we went there was also a brewmaster's special that had upwards of 9% abv...I think that was the one that really did me in. We left that place full, tipsy, and more than satisfied. Can't wait to do it again.",

    "text": "Oh man, I had a great time at Triple 7.  It was pretty busy on a Sunday night when I arrived, but I sidled up to an empty seat at the bar with no problems.  Then I ate and drank to my heart's content and paid pocket change for the experience.  The space is rather large and there are two bars flanking either side of the dining room.  The brewing equipment is prominently positioned on two levels along the back of the restaurant.  It's a nice, open space and I felt very comfortable.  The bartender/server who attended to me was efficient if a bit abrupt.  That's okay--he's a bartender, not a waiter.  I prefer brusqueness to plodding service at the bar.  He wasn't chatty but he answered all of my questions and was quick with the refills.  The beer was fantastic and cheap.  I especially enjoyed the porter and the seasonal Oktoberfest.  Each style was well represented, which in my experience is rare in brewpubs.  There was a high level of consistency.  Plus, you could drink here all night and pay the tab with whatever's leftover from your taxi fare downtown.  For dinner I ordered a burger and fries, and they were acceptable.  The burger was cooked a bit longer than I would have liked but it tasted just fine.  I noticed that they also had a sushi bar adjacent to the regular bar.  That was unexpected and seemed a bit out of place in a brewpub, but hey!  Maybe some people like sushi with their microbrews and fried mozzarella sticks.  I didn't try any.  I left about an hour and a half later having consumed a burger, fries and four beers.  The total tab was less than $20.  What a great value.  If this place were located near my home I'd rarely eat or drink anywhere else.",

And waited and then waited, waited some more and after listening to four songs, I sarcastically asking the hostess that seated us is if there was wait service or whether something had changed.    She didn't apologize, just questioned that no one had come to even drop off water and went towards the back muttering.   Two songs later, we admitted defeat and just left.   This was at 11pm. The place was barely 1/3 full. Could it of been that we were Asian and none of the staff was?  At a hotel that caters to Hawaii?  We didn't get a chance to be asses since we never were approached with any type of service other than being seated.   I personally have eaten here 25+ times before with no issues like this. It'll be a while before I think about going back. There is nothing that special about the food here, then there's the service.   Meh.",

    "text": "There are two microbreweries on or near the old strip. This is the only one where the beer is brewed on location.   Triple 7 is an interesting space. It's like a pub meets sushi bar meets, well, Vegas. Brick walls, plenty of seating, big tall ceilings and yes, a sushi bar with a big neon sign behind it.   If you're coming in for the first time, order a tour of microbrews, the sampler is only $5.99.  Do you like mango? Try the mango hefeweizen. Light in flavour, it goes down easily... too easily. You'll want more! For something a little different, the King's Kolsch is a lemongrass beer surprise! It seems to be an up and coming flavour in everything from beers to vodkas. I'd ask for a sample sip before you order... just to make sure you can handle an entire pint of it.  If you're hungry, might I suggest the Korean short ribs and Korean tacos? I know, weird to have a Korean influence in a microbrewery right? Not any more odd than a sushi and oyster bar. Anyway, both are delicious and both come with a side order of cucumber kimchi. The short ribs were saucy and delightful, though my server, Monique had a description that gave them way more justice than I ever could. The tacos came in a half soft, half crunchy shell and had that same bite. After those and my tour of beer, I was so very full!  Tip: If you're going to order some sushi, you won't be able to do it right from the sushi bar. You'll still need to go through your server! Just roll with it...   Bonus: No smoking allowed inside the pub. You can escape the smell!",

I got a half dozen oysters on the half shell while I waited for 3 PM.  The bartender was awesome.  The oysters were huge!  A little before 3, he hooked me up with a 16 oz mango hef and told me he would add it on the bill at 3 for the $2.  Normal prices are 16 oz for $3.26 and 23 oz for $3.95, so during HH you can get 32 oz for $4, a good deal.  Lots of brewmaster's specials, but I only wanted the mango and one was enough to get me a bit tipsy.  To counter that, I ordered the Thai chili wings (1 dozen for $4.50 during HH) and chatted up a random Vegas-defect who was at the bar.  The wings were crispy, hot, and delicious.    The restaurant is really large and the bar area is too.  The TVs are large and flatscreen.  This is a good joint to get a cold tasty beer and watch a game.  Great Happy Hour spot too.  I will definitely be back for good beer, good service, and good grub.  MANGO hef!!!",

    "text": "Heard so many good things about this place so we finally decided to check it out. We had high expectations, as everyone we know who has eaten said it was great. We ordered a steak and short ribs, then waited 40+ minutes for it. This might have been because of a number of reasons, our servers switched because the original one when on break. In my opinion, there is no reason we should have waited over 40 minutes for our food. It wasn't very busy and there seemed to be more than enough staff working. During this time our server also only came to check on us once. We could see our food waiting near the kitchen for about 10 minutes. Once we did get our food, it was a little over cooked but tasted pretty good. Our server started checking up on us more and seemed to be in a better mood. Overall, the food was better than the service.",

I remember that everything looked so perfect that I knew from being in the industry that it all came prepared ahead - not really anything wrong with it, you just know that it all came from packages and is quickly thrown together rather than actually doing meal prep.  I specifically noticed this with pieces of chicken.  Seems like cheap ingredients, so doesn't surprise me that he got sick.",

I especially always look for bar seating.  The bartenders are laid back, super cool, friendly, easy going and easy to talk to.  We always have great service every time we come here. I especially look forward to the seasonal brews since they brew their own beer there.  You can't miss the beer tanks when you walk in since they're practically noticeable floor to ceiling.  The restaurant is very spacious, high ceilings, with flat screen TV's everywhere focused primarily on sports. Yay LOL  They have a wide array of selection, from starters, burgers, sandwiches, sushi, pizza, full entrees, salads, you name it.  They have a really good happy hour and late night happy hour with a nice selection of appetizers, tapas, pupus ranging from only $3 - $7! Draft beers, cocktails and shots are also from $3 - $5!  Talk about a really good deal!  Triple 7 has a very nice, good feel ambiance about the place!  And, as their motto goes \"Save Water Drink Beer\"! LOL",

Ordered soft drinks and we had to remind the waitress twice if they were coming.  We used dinner vouchers that were supposed to be free and the waitress requested the wrong ones and she ended up charging $130 on my debit card.  She also tried to charge the appetizers to us that never came.  After all of this she explained to me that it would take 10 business days for the funds to go back on my card.   I asked to speak to the manager to see if there was anything he could do and he acted like he didn't care.  I asked him for proof of a receipt that the funds were indeed reversed and he told me \"not to worry about it, the funds will go back in\".    Our orders were wrong. The service was terrible.  And my card was wrongly charged.  Not much else to say unless a manager reaches out to me and makes it right.",

We had a party of 6 and when we got to the front, they said they didn't have but offered the counter, which we took.  Our waitress took a few to come by and take our drink order only. She looked stressed out and was not friendly at all. She dropped off our drinks, walked away and never said anything. We were growing impatient after 15-20 minutes, then an older Filipino waitress came by. She apologized and said she just got to work. We kind of let that slide. The one star is for the spinach dip.  The food was not that great. I did not like the Oysters, they did not even carry Ponzu sauce  Everything else was okay.  It seemed like they need a systems overhaul of training for staff (they looked very unorganized), they had a lot of open tables but lots of people waiting outside (I believe it's because the service staff are not well trained). Management was no where to be found to pick up on the angry faces around the room.  I would not recommend coming here.",

LOCATION/SETTING: Casino level at Mainstreet Station Casino Brewery Hotel in Downtown Las Vegas.  As I've already mentioned, 3rd time's the charm:  1st visit:  Closed (limited hours on Sundays?) 2nd visit:  Closed early 3rd visit:  Open!  The restaurant was crowded and full of life when we arrived at nearly 11pm on a week night in early October.  The restaurant is a mix of mostly tables, bar height tables, and the bar....of course.  Since the restaurant was packed, we had to wait a few minutes before the hostess showed us to a bar height able in the rear by the kitchen.    In the end, my friend and I shared the nachos grande and the Asian street tacos.  The nachos was more than enough to share, a very decent sized portion.  The tacos were alright, but a forewarning to those with a lower spice tolerance:  there's a bit of heat in the sauce (Sriracha in the mix).  I'd do a repeat order on the nachos on a future visit.  SERVICE: It was alright.  The server was friendly, though I assume she didn't check on us as often as she could due to the crowded restaurant.  Again, service was ok.  BOTTOM LINE: Lucky number 7?!!  I'd totally visit again to try different things on their menu.  I just hope they're open!",

The response we got was \"Your asking too much for me being this early\".  I think that was the hostess attempt at humor...

Unfortunately the soup was not available at Market Street because they closed the kitchen overnight for cleaning. We mosey along over the Triple 7 Restaurant since the signs indicated they were serving our beloved oxtail for Market Street that night.   4 oxtail soups please..... our soups were served quickly. They had an abundance of meat, bones and a mixture of carrots, celery and mushrooms. The soup came with one scoop of rice and shredded ginger and cilantro on the side. We had been waiting all evening for our special oxtail soup so we were ready to grub. Meh. My soup was warm. Not hot. I wanted my soup hot hot hot. Some of the oxtail meat was fatty and it would have tasted better and sat better on my tummy if it was HOT. I'll have to remember next time to order my soup extra hot. I dumped the ginger in the soup for a yummy taste. Some of the rice was hard and crunchy. Why? Maybe it was the bottom of the pot. I don't know but yuck. I didn't like that either. The soup filled my tummy and satisfied my hunger but it just wasn't the oxtail I was hoping for. Boooooo!!!   The other downer to our culinary adventure was the active renovations going on in the restaurant while we were eating. They were cutting metal with a saw. While that area of the restaurant was covered with a divider, we could smell the metal air particles coming over to our area of the restaurant. It made it difficult to breathe and we could taste it in our mouths. That was disgusting. We didn't want to eat metal or breathe metal. The waitress apologized and said she was having trouble breathing too but that didn't stop the active renovations in the restaurant. Honestly, the restaurant was closing in the morning and re-opening at lunch time as part of their regular schedule. I would recommend that the restaurant operators wait for the active crew renovations until the restaurant is closed. It was noisy with the repairs and their work ruined the smell and taste of our food. This was the deal killer for me. I won't be back.",

    "text": "Always a favorite of ours when we stay down on Fremont Street... we found ourselves here three different times on our last visit to Vegas.  The inside of the Main street Station Casino is worth coming to see alone. Triple 7 is home to probably the best happy hour deals in downtown Las Vegas.   I find their beer a bit hit and miss to be honest, but nothing has ever been awful. And the prices on their beer are awesome, especially during the aforementioned happy hour. If you can catch their seasonal/ rotating Black Cherry Porter it is my all time favorite here.    We LOVE their sushi bar... it is a Las Vegas gem. If you are a sushi fan, don't miss this. Their menu is great, we have had a little of everything over the years and while not much is \"standout\" everything is always good. This last time we hit the happy hour special Portobello Mushroom Fries twice and loved them. Heather is a big fan of their wings here as well.  Good beer and eats for cheap in a very cool old train station turned casino. Check it out!",

We normally order the fish and chips and the nachos, which are ginormous. Their microbrews are average, and in some cases lack flavor. I normally stick with their vodka sodas or house wine. Dinning area service is hit and miss, thats why the bar is are ideal spot to sit. Overall very standard bar food for good prices!  Tip - If you park at main street station you get free parking by food and drink purchases.",

It was busy the night we went, but didn't have to wait more than 10 minutes for a table which was great cause we were hungry! Loved that our waitress gave us iced waters in large cups so we didn't drink them empty so fast. It's the little things that bring joy when all we drink is water. Haha  They have a pretty good menu to choose from. We decided to try a couple different appetizers, so we had some oysters, peel & eat shrimp, and hot spinach & cheese dip. Everything was so good! They toasted the bread for the spinach dip which made it taste even better. We all ordered steak for our dinner since we were craving steak since the night before (side note: never have conversations with others about yummy ass steaks on an empty stomach) and it didn't disappoint as well! It was cooked perfectly as requested. Craving happily satisfied!   I've been to Main Street so many times before in the past and can't believe I never ate here sooner. Definitely won't be the last!",

Buffalo wings are the best I've had in Vegas.  The cheesy garlic bread is unlike anything you've ever had anywhere else.  It's a meal in itself.  Great way to start.  The fried calamari serving is huge.  Just put some lemon on that and you're all set.  As far as entrees.  Their Beer-Battered Jumbo Shrimp looked like pieces of fried chicken on my plate...HUGE and delicious!  Burgers are always made just perfect.  Nice size as well.  The pizza and pizza crust is great, but stay away from the 4 cheese pizza ONLY because it has WAY too much cheese.  If you're into that, then it might be pure ecstasy.  I honestly can't say that this place has too many misses.    If you go after midnight, they have a special on all their own brews.  My favorite is the High Roller Gold.  It's $1.50 for a 16oz. glass.  Well worth it.    I promise you will NOT walk out of this place disappointed.  Enjoy",

Our server only came by once and never refilled our drinks. My wife ordered Alfredo pasta, when it came the chicken was rubbery and inedible. The server was bothered by my wife's request to send it back, only after waiting 15 minutes for her to come back to tell her the chicken was bad. I noticed that there are a lot more loud and annoying yuppies that frequent this place now, not as fun as when I started dining here 4 years ago.

    "text": "a disappointing trend to a what used to be a pretty good quality place? have always eaten here multiple days during visits. our latest trip brought us here for dinner. The dinner special was a seared ahi salad for $12.95. Now by vegas standards $12.95 means something extraordinary. What we got was an iceberg lettuce salad with an overpowering asian vinegar dressing. Top it of with a medium rare ahi with strings in the middle!!!!! totally unacceptable. I've never had a bad meal here for years until this past week. so sad..once my favorite place drops to the bottom of the list. dared not try to order the sashimi and sushi for fear of more poor quality. is it the economy or lazy chef?",

The Salmon, Calamari, Oyster Shooters, and Fish/Chips  Cons: 1.  Depending when you go, there's a wait. You get seated fairly quick, but waitresses every once in awhile forget you're there. Maritess is the only exception. She's always around and pleasant to talk to.  2.  Don't get the sushi!! Not fresh, too loose, and too much rice.",

Anytime sushi option with the meals make this joint unique I'm food choice variety.   I'm really not a beer person but I guess people here come for the best of that too' Love the atmosphere and service is fast considering the variety of dishes the kitchen needs to prepare.   Food for the mood...you can be sure that if you're feeling light there's great salads and appetizers, fresh oysters, edamame, artichoke dips, sliders, and every traditional favs. Or if you're feeling hearty try king size prime rib, meatloaf, Alfredo with garlic bread, many more!!!  Food has always tasted grand, I don't know what the bad reviews were eating but I haven't had anything I didn't like. So give them a try...a full house and lines out the door during mealtime don't happen at joints with food that suck!",

Hot crab and artichoke dip...a yummy appetizer that is so rich smooth and creamy! Ir comes with tortilla chips and garlic bread slices for dipping, this is a winner!  BBQ chicken pizza, very good! Mmmm sliced purple onion, cilantro and smoked Gouda cheese with a nice sweet and tangy BBQ sauce.   Brewmaster's Tekka maki sushi roll, mmm yum! Ahi roll in beer batter, deep fried, comes with a nice teriyaki dipping sauce and wasabi.  High roller gold draft wheat beer  This experience was very fun, we had an awesome server by the name of Ana she was fantastic!   This place is busy on the weekends, we went on a saturday and there was a small line forming to be seated through out most of the night.   Would definitely come back :)",

If it wasn't for the fact we waited an hour and I had two three year olds starving we would have got up and left. Needless to say it's three years later and I thought I would give it another chance. What a mistake! The service was as terrible the waitress took forever to show up and when she did she was very argumentative and unwilling to make slight substitutions to our order request. When the food finally came out it was Luke warm and the presentation looked as though my 7 year old made it and threw it on a plate. This place is terrible don't waste your time or your money.",

It's really no frills and very straight forward, food is much like any grill/coffee shop and nothing to write home about.  I mostly like to sit at the bar and enjoy a house brew and occasional appetizer.  Really, there's nothing outstanding about this place, service or food, it's a very standard downtown coffee shop type venue, burgers, breakfast, Asian section.  Tons of seating options- tables and a long bar, means it's very unlikely you'll ever have to wait for a seat.  If you want locally brews on tap, good value and unpretentious spot, give them a try if you are nearby.",

    "text": "Based on my equation of great + plus really good food + mistake-free service = 5 stars, upgrading Triple 7 to 5 stars is a no-brainer. Every time I come here I am more and more impressed with their brews. My last visit it was a wonderful Lemongrass Kolsch. This time it's a phenomenal Sour Saison. Triple 7 took two of my favorite styles and made a memorable brew with a perfectly balanced level of tartness. And their other seasonal, a hoppy wheat brew, was also excellent.  On my last visit I heard great things about their sushi. You wouldn't expect sushi from a casino to be good, but the downtown casinos have a high volume of Hawaiian and Asian patrons, especially Triple 7 and the adjoining California. So this time I ordered a nigiri sampler and it was beautiful. The hamachi and ahi were outstanding, and all of the pieces were HUGE.   I can't imagine a future Vegas vacation without a stop at Triple 7. Some of the best craft brew I've ever had, some of the best sushi I've ever had - how could I NOT consider this one of my favorite places on earth?",

Well I finally made it and after I tried some of their food and beer, I wanted to stay longer and try more beer if I didn't have a previous appointment to make.  The bartender and staff were pretty friendly albeit in the afternoon hours, it was pretty dead in there.  They have happy hour specials but the prices here are pretty cheap for beers and food alike.  I got an order of potstickers and a big 24 oz beer for under $10!  I mean, that's at regular price so happy hour will even be lower than that!  This place isn't the prettiest or newest place to drink beer in the town but the value can't be beat.  Main St Station seems to be getting the shaft compared to the California across the street is super full of people in their restaurants.  I love Hawaiian food but I love beer more!!  If I'm walking by this area of Fremont and Main again, then I'll make sure to stop by in here for a blonde ale!",

I'd go here again for their happy hour specials but other than that, I won't be back.

    "text": "My friend I made on this September 2019 Vegas trip suggested this place. I have been here once or twice before as I recognize the interior. Well, we were staying on the Boulder Hwy so we took the free shuttle at Sam's Town and arrived at Fremont and then walked over to California and then upstairs it connects to Main Street Station. Triple 7 is inside MSS.   They brew their own beer. It is good too. I like stouts and porters but they did not have many of those as they are in season mainly during the winter or cooler months. However, I did get the one stout they had and also tried their red ale. The stout was awesome and had a Guiness consistency to it but much more of a flavor profile and bouquet. Fantastic! The red ale was good but I liked the stout better. It was $4 for a 23 oz during Happy Hour which we planned for. So for food I got the 2 oysters for $1.50 (small and ok), portobello fries (super portobello shrooms cut into wedges like steak fries and fried-solid!) and I got the honey garlic wings (10 for $8-decent-nothing special).   Interior is cool and a nice open space and vibe. The brewing tanks are present behind glass and tons of tvs for sports watching fever. The interior is modern and clean  Our waitress was nice and very attentive. Excellent service. The beer is the highlight. The food that I had was good for the shrooms but meh for the wings and oysters. If I lived in Vegas I would be hittin' this place up for their beer during HH. Next time Iam in Vegas a trip here or two is beyond definitely in order. You gotta try this brewery. Bomb beer!!!!",

    "text": "This message is for Chris J.  I tried to reply to her and send her a message, but for reason, the Yelp website kept failing to send.  So here is my reply to her:  There isn't much more to say other than what I reported.  I know that cost-control is a big issue with all restaurants, but if that is what is causing the things that I reported, then I think that your food quality at 777 will cause your restaurant to do more poorly in the future.  I love the ambiance of your restaurant/pub/bar, and it is a great place to watch a game and have a meal.  But those things that I reported are certainly deteriorations from years gone past when I have dined (many times) at the 777 Brew Pub.    Also, I also know that you folks implemented a new \"comp\" system for guests.  Now the comp is put onto the players B-Connected card.  In my case, I had a comp for my two kids, and my gold card for my wife and me. I told my waitress to pub my wife's and my meal on my gold card and my two kids meals on my comp.  She said she would do this, but apparently didn't.  I had no way of knowing this at the time we ate at the 777 but the waitress took the entire food bill off my B-Connected card.  So the comp was used and the balanced charged against my points.  The gold card was never used for my wife's and my meals.  I discovered this when we got home and I was checking the B-Connected website.  My point count did not make any sense and that is how I found out the waitresses mistake.    Like I said, I think I outlined quite well what my problems were.  If there is a way to fix them, that would be great.  If not, and if cost-control/reduction is the driving force, then sobeit.",

    "text": "Better than the overpriced buffet. It's located off the casino floor. Triple 7 is unique from other casino bars because it has its own brewery, so you for sure want to get a beer here. Beer isn't horribly overpriced either. The food menu has some good options, but the beers are the best items.   It has some very good deals. It's $5.75 for a 23 ounce. That's a price that's hard to match for microbrewery beer in Vegas ounce for ounce. The beer is what they're known for, but they make cocktails too. Flagship beer is the High Roller Gold. It's a golden colored ale. This is refreshing and smooth. Food here is a lot of the usual stuff like seafood, steaks, and the like. The appetizers for edamame are about $3.99 or so.   Much better food than at the buffet. Even though most people come for the beer. The rest of the hotel isn't as great, but this definitely makes it worth coming to for fresh beer and food.",

What came was a sad plate of butter lettuce and dressing.  Would t hurt you to toss a carrot or something in there.   Overall, not too bad of a dinner.",

The steak was actually cooked perfectly except that it was hard and chewy. For a $17 steak it tasted like a $10 diner steak you would get at a diner. The fries also tasted frozen and old. I would not get it again.  The Santa Fe Salad was pretty good but there were too many toppings compared to the actual amount of lettuce. It had a nice dressing and was a pretty decent salad.  The cheeseburger was also okay but just average. This place is okay for a quick meal especially if you're staying at the hotel and casino. But it's not good quality. It is also too expensive for the quality.  This place is also a brewery so they have a lot of drinks but it's cheaper to just get drinks outside at the casino.. Service was pretty good but she never refilled my water. Food was brought out quickly though.",

We're starving and wanted to share something so we got the steak and fries and mushrooms.  The mushrooms here are my favorite I can eat it everytime I come here.  Sometimes twice a day.  Well everything was going great food was tasting deliciousas always drinks were cold.  Although the bartender brought me the wrong beer I had to chase him down for the right one.  No problem.   I was on the last piece of the mushroom and all if a sudden I pull a long hair from the batter of the mushroom.  I was like oh SH%/! I lost my appetite.  Then a young gentleman came to check on us and ask how were doing and we told him what happened and he said would you want to talk to the chef we said we don't want to grumble but okay.   The chef came to our table and he was so apologetic. He surely was nice. He asked who our server was and we told Him a young friendly girl.  She came over and apologized also. They're really nice and understanding.  It does happen I understand that.  I loved watching them prepare all the foods as to where we were seated next to the kitchen. So many different types of plates coming out of the kitchen. Chef was nice enough to comp the bill. We said we want to pay for something he said no your bill is taken cared of.  This place is really nice to come to if your at main street and want to take a break from gambling and want to rest something.  Come eat here.  They do have sushi to.  I will come back and try the mushrooms again...",

We've always been happy with the prime rib and steaks, and the beer is lovely. Two happy hours each day, afternoon and after 11. If you're staying nearby, it's extremely convenient with long hours. (Closed 7 in the morning until 11, and a couple of Mondays each month for deep cleaning.)   I love the ribeye steak, and the T-bone is also outstanding. One night I had a side of onion rings instead of potato. My steak was engulfed in onion rings. The platter was so full the veggies had to go in a side dish. There's also a sushi menu. The other night my son tried the ale-battered shrimp which turned out to be five huge shrimp - probably 3 ounces each - with a delicious, light, crisp batter coating. The side salad he ordered ($2) was huge and fresh with cherry tomatoes and cucumber and lots of croutons.   If you are ever unhappy with anything, just tell them. They'll make it right.",

Also a brewery, you can see the huge copper beer barrels(?) in the background and gives it a nice touch. They have huge TVs everywhere with a few different games on. We enjoyed a Long Island (one of the best we've had) and a Malibu and Coke. The bartender was great and friendly, and on top of refilling our drinks. We also ordered the French Fry Sample and the sauces to go with it to snack on, soo good. Pretty decent prices too. Really enjoyed Triple 7 and highly recommend visiting. It's a nice change from the Las Vegas strips and people; it's quiet and pleasant to enjoy and hang out.  Will be back to visit.",

The place wasn't too busy, pretty clean, aside from the typical 2nd hand smoke from the casino you have to walk through to get to the restaurant.   Also, did I mention, it's a microbrewery!   I ordered the 5 beer sampler which comes with five 5oz beers. Not sure if it's always the selection I'm about to list but included in  the flight was the Special (I think at the moment it's the Double Down Hefenweizen), High Roller, Black Chip, Royal Red Ale, & Marker Pale Ale. Of those, my favorite was the High Roller because it reminded me of a Stella Artois. Yum! I really don't wanna be too opinionated on the beer because I understand everyone's palate is different. I will say it's a nice variety to sample.   As far as food went, I got a margherita pizza and the ale battered mushrooms.   I'll start with the mushrooms. I thought they had potential of being really good. There was a good balance of crispiness of the batter and the mushrooms, portobello to be exact, were seasoned pretty well and they were thick and \"meaty\" slices. The only disappointment was it was a bit too oily.   The pizza was less disappointing. The crust was on the thinner side, cheese was ooey & gooey. They did not skimp on the tomatoes and fresh basil which makes me believe that of you ordered other types of pizza, they won't skimp on those toppings. I wanna say the tomatoes need a lil salt or maybe some crushed red pepper. Otherwise, it's a decent pizza with a decent price and it paired nicely with all the beer drinking.   Cheers!",

As for food, like everyone says they all come in huge portions which is awesome for sharing!   We ordered mozzarella sticks, Caesar salad with salmon, and my boyfriend ordered a sushi roll.  I totally forgot to take pictures but I got a snap of what I could!  The Caesar salad with salmon was actually really good! The romaine was super fresh and crunchy. And the salmon was super juicy and marinated really well.  The mozzarella sticks were basic but served hot and really fast.  My boyfriend ate all of his sushi roll and did say anything bad about it so I'm guessing it was good!   Overall, not a bad place to eat.",

Pretty disappointing since I was there the night before and service was way better. They both kept walking by me. WTH! You have to be kidding me! Both of them ignored me multiple times before I came out to the casino bar and a nice \"little bit older\" man helped me. I'm surprised I had to go out of my way to give the casino my money. Next time I'll just stay at a different casino.",

    "text": "I see how this place might have some real potential in being a good option to eat at while in the area.  However, my experience made me and my party wishing we'd skipped being here that morning.  We had started out at Market Street Cafe looking only for Oxtail Soup.  They told us that we had to trek over here for it.  So, after a good walk, we arrived and were promptly seated.  Service was okay, but everything else was not up to snuff.  The four of us all ordered the Oxtail Soup.  Yay!!  We were so ready for this moment!  The server brought out ginger & cilantro for our soups.  Sadly, when the soup arrived, it was near tepid.  It seemed as if they weren't expecting to serve any here, so they didn't even bother to keep it warm on the stove!  Such a disappointment!  I think we all powered through and ate most of the soup since we had worked so hard to chase after it!  Midway through our soup anticlimax, we heard loud noises and saw sparks near the brewing vats at the kitchen side of the restaurant.  Really??  Yes, they were behind a curtain working, but I could see the sparks and hear the loud noise.  Worst of all is the SMELL from it!  Metallic cutting or welding does not go well with trying to eat.  This should never have happened!  This restaurant does have periods of time when they are closed and those would have been the ideal time to take care of their equipment repairs!  We were not informed of this upon being seated (or ever), and even though our server did apologize and empathize with us after we brought it up, that just isn't good enough!   I will probably not ever step foot in this restaurant again and I know without a shadow of a doubt, I will never order Oxtail Soup from here in the future!!",

Well, we had an itinerary PLUS we needed sustenance before our hike.   Unfortunately,  soup didn't come out hot enough,  rice was hard, and construction in the background didn't sum up an awesome experience this time around.  Albeit, the soup came fully stocked of meaty and soft oxtail, tons of veggies,  and a generous amount of ginger and cilantro  (which I LOVE) bumped it to a 3 star for me.

I was only there to sample a few beers when I noticed the gentleman next to me enjoying some of the largest raw oysters I have ever seen.  Not to spoil my supper plans I opted for a half dozen.  What a wonderful treat they were.  So good I returned the following day at opening time to enjoy another order before heading to the airport.  The beers were not nothing special but they where are a nice break from the typical domestic.  Just like to give a big Thank you to Richard the bartender.  He was super helpful and fun to talk to.

The hours are great, variety of food to choose from is wide, the beer is locally brewed and of great quality, and the food varies from decent to really good.   Tonight I had the hot chicken wings and fries. Both were alright. Nothing too exciting.  The wings were a bit overcooked as the fries. The sauce was good, but they got kinda stingy with it. In the past I've tried their sushi, which was surprisingly pretty good.   The range of food options is one of the best reasons to come here. They have burgers, tacos, pizza, sandwiches, and even oysters.  You name it, they got it.   I've been coming here for quite some time and whether your food is ok or really good is a hit or miss.  You won't be disappointed in their beer, though.",

Visited Triple 7 on a busy Saturday, they didn't disappoint!  Gotta love cheat day - treat yo'self!  Got me a killer sandwich & a beer:  -Prime Rib & Swiss Melt ($11.99) - slow roasted, shaved prime rib, on a warm steak roll with Swiss cheese & sauteed onions, served with a side of au jus and crispy French fries -Black Chip Porter ($5.75 for a large 23 oz.!) - for dark beer lovers, smooth, roasted blend of 5 malts gives it flavors of coffee, dark chocolate & caramel  Oh man this lunch hit the spot!  The Prime Rib & Swiss Melt was on-target delicious!  Tender prime rib, melty cheese, all dipped in flavorful au jus?  Totally worth the calories!  The Black Chip Porter held its own as well, has always been my favorite beer at Triple 7!  Did you know - dark beers are great for post-workouts because the flavonoids help fight muscle soreness and fatigue?  Well now you know!  Was excellent catching up with my homie from Hawaii over some food & beer.  To top it all off - that day Hawaii won the Little League World Series!  And we were able to watch it all unfold at Triple 7!",

We got there at 5:15 so we had to rush our drinking and appetizer ordering but our waitress was cool and worked with us to make sure we got our orders in by 6 pm.  1/2 price appetizers includes a bucket of peel/eat shrimp, large basket of calamari, cheesy garlic bread (looked like a pizza), large quesadilla and dozen chicken wings (w/Thai sauce).  Service was great and the atmosphere was relaxing.  Our bill for 4 with 4 beers, 8 glasses of wine and all the above appetizers, came to $40.

There's a bunch of not-so-cleverly named, in-theme stuff at high prices, which can be a crap shoot.  So when a bartender at a brewery kiosk in the Planet Hollywood mall referred us here, it stuck out, and we decided to pile in the car and make the trip; while we could expense crappy food all we needed, deep down, it wasn't what we were craving.  Naturally, particularly for my colleagues not so experienced in Vegas, the step off the strip into downtown is a fun one.  You get the proper desperate-folks-in-a-smoky-hole vibe that is so missed these days.  Main Street Station, where the Triple 7 is located, is no exception.  The brewpub is by far the nicest part of it.  Old-fashioned looking without looking yellowed.  Enough plasma screens to remind you that the 80's have long passed.  Clean, but comfortable and lived-in.  The beers are solid, with the pale ale truly outstanding--they have GABF banners on the walls from years past and it's not a stretch to see why.  The waitstaff knows enough about the food and the beer, to boot.  There's the cheap-steak option which i'm told was pretty good, but i went for beer-battered chicken fingers with beer barbecue, which was awesome.  It's all very plainly made with some care, and delicious.  If you don't mind marinating in some extra-thick smoke to get there, it is absolutely worth the short drive to downtown to get some real food and real beer.",

I'm a fan of microbreweries because the ambiance is always quaint, unique and different from the usual commercial restaurant chains.",

I don't recall the Happy Hour times, but that's when we try to go. Beer is brewed on site and cheap - although you can get it even cheaper at the casino bar (but they don't always have all of the varieties). CHEESY GARLIC BREAD is awesome and $4 or $5. Meatball sliders, and Honey Dijon wings are also great. I vaguely remember getting a sandwich once and I think it was good....darn microbrews. I recently got pasta though and oh boy did I regret it...stick to basics here and you'll be happy :o)",

The wait for a table was about 20 minutes, not too bad for 7pm on a Friday night...and it took a bit for our server to get to us...but all was forgiven when the food came.  My husband ordered the fish and chips and I had the fish taco plate.  We were amazed at the size of the portion, especially at the reasonable prices they charge...and the taste...some of the best food we've had lately.  We were looking for  a BJ's Brewery type of place to eat and this did the trick.  My hubby also tried the Triple 7 Special - Hefferwiezen beer.  He said it was some of the best he's tased.  We had a really nice experience and were even able to watch the Angel's game.  Oh, and the calamari appetizer that we got because we were starving when we ordered, we took most of that home and will have it later because the regular meal was so filling.    We would definitely recommend this place!",

    "text": "Came here for the very first time this past weekend (Friday lunch to be exacty) to check out what the hype was...  Left VERY happy and VERY satisfied (and drrrrunk!) customers!  Brother and I managed to try a few beers: The guest brew -- mango cream ale.  Surprisingly refreshing, not sweet at all like you would think. The brewmaster's special -- Weisenbock (sp?).  STRONG!  Quite good and got even better when it warmed up a bit...  Just a bit. The red.  A lot less...  reddish? than I expected.  I liked it a lot but it was a bit anticlimactic after the Weisenbock.  Good 'tweener though (between strong beers). The pale.  AWESOME!!!  Definitely would be my go-to beer if I hung out here more (and believe me, both my brother and I for sure will be back)!  The food was delicious and came out piping hot for every order we got.  Cheesy bread was great -- a number of different cheeses make their way onto that goodness.  Garlic fries were crunchy on the outside, nice and fry-esque on the inside, LOTS of garlic = LOTS of delicious!  My brother ordered the oysters topped with the crab and artichoke dip...  Oh.  My.  SOOOOO GOOD!!!  Dip wasn't overwhelming or overly rich, and whatever brine the oysters are in accentuates them perfectly.  Plus there was a soft toasted garlic bread that sopped all this amazingness up!  But the crowning jewel in our visit here was my order:  OYSTER SHOOTERS (with vodka -- you get a choice of vodka or tequila).  Just an explosion, literally, of flavors in your mouth...  We like to put Tabasco and a lil dash of black pepper in ours, and it tastes absolutely yummy.  I don't even like Bloody Marys that much...  But these came out SO GOOD and SO CHEAP at that!!!  Friends, Yelpers, beer lovers -- lend me your stomachs (and livers).  DROP BY TRIPLE 7!!!  Prices are right, grub is great, alcohol is OUT OF THIS WORLD!!!  Everyone will find something they love here, I guarantee it :)",

I thought for sure they would suck.  They were tender and not dry in the inside.  Taste was good.  Just enough heat to make you sniffle.  Beer was cheap.

Gotta give props for the Mango Hef of course since this is a brewery at heart. Burger looked normal and steak sandwich seemed quite fatty and the 4th person ordered a ribeye, which looked like she was struggling to find some meat on the steak at times. All of those dishes were forgetable, but my $8.99 pepperoni pizza was the best of the bunch. Eight very large slices (I only finsihed half) so this is shareable. They do use two kinds of cheeses, so if your a purist, then maybe just ask for mozzarella. But the crust was excellent and this qualifies as a safe choice if you find yourself eating here. Would go back for pizza and beer anytime.",

A little grungier (because the courthouse and jail are nearby), but unpretentious, with a lot of older regulars, and Hawaiians flown in from the Islands at Main Street, or the Califronia Hotel. The Main Street Station Casino is like an old western train station, with dark hardwoods and antique stylings. There is even an old Pullman Rail car museum for the public. But the people are friendly and don't always have their hand out waiting for a tip like other glitzier South Strip hotels.  The 777 Brew Pub is an open room with TVs and tables that you might find in a mid size town in the west. It is lively and has a comfortable, casual feel. Now believe it or not, they serve sushi here! Yes, and they have a sushi chef in one corner making it for all to see.   The food and  beverages are decent, the prices are reasonable, and the place is nice for relaxation.

But the service was great very friendly and local especially our waitress she was from our hometown back home so it was nice, the atmosphere was sports bar& grill/ brewery look it was nice as well... Not looking forward to going there again but I will give it 3stars just because its ot the best but also not the worst and service was great!",

For food, we had nachos.  Nothing earthshaking, but very edible and satisfying.  (Gets a star for the prices.)  I was surprised that there was a fee to park in their lot, but all you have to do is go to a cashier and they will reimburse your $3.",

    "text": "\"...Save Water (and the food), Drink Beer.\"  The food is average - a bit above average, come for the beer.  As of Thanksgiving weekend 2011, they had a sampler for $5.50 - five 5 ounce sampler sized glasses of each of their current selections, an IPA, Porter, Blond, Hef, Red, and one of their seasonals - which I fancy the Pumpkin Spice... or get all of them each in a nice full pint for only $1.75 (Seasonal only available in the restaurant)...  ...and remember you're in Vegas, so you actually might want to stop in for a quick bite, and  stop by the bar next to the buffet for the beers, but try your hand at the Video Poker machines to get the beers free (albeit your $ in the cup for tip).  For the REAL beer drinker, you'll appreciate these micro brewery's take on these standards. The IPA for example, being the more hoppy of the types is actually pretty subtle, and finishes smooth - which you'l find is a trend with all the selections you choose. My favorie is the Black Chip - which resembles the most like that of a Porter, smooth and rich from the first touch of your lips to the last drop, again, clean finish.  4 Stars are for the beer, the restaurant gets 3 stars. As the slogan they stole from Cancun... Save Water (and the food), Drink Beer.",

    "text": "My friends and I are sitting at the bar at a little after 2AM and we look at each other and realize that if lived closer to this place, we'd be in trouble. The last thing we need in our quest to get rid of our beer guts is a place that serves great beer and good food 24 hours a day. I've noticed some comment that the beer here is watery, but I've noticed that about all the Las Vegas micro brews I've had. I guess when you're in the desert, you just aren't in the mood for a heavy, particle filled beer.   The bartender was really friendly and was patient with my friends who could not decide what they wanted. I went with the mango cream ale since I had heard a few people say it was really good. My friends both gave up trying to decide and went with samplers. I didn't know the samplers also included their seasonal brew (the mango cream ale) or else I would have gotten one as well. I enjoyed the ale a lot. The mango cream flavors were subtle. My friends both really like the Royal Red. One little quirk about the bar (or maybe it was just our bartender), but they could not take the tips while we were still there. He just left them on the bar even after we told him the money was for him.  There are no gaming machines at the bar, a rarity for a casino bar. If you'd like to get comp beers for playing, there is a bar in the casino that has all their beers on tap. You can also order their beers from any cocktail waitresses. That works out great since I do enjoy gaming, but I do still like to go into the brewpub once in awhile and pay for my beer (it is less than $4 for the large) so I can take in the atmosphere. The old school wooden bar is a nice place to hang out with friends. There is also a sushi and oyster bar during certain hours.",

Main St. can always be depended on for the best pale ale in town.  Only 2 bucks each during happy hour or after midnight!  They also have great pub snacks... like garlic fries, wild mushroom pizza, veggie (or regular) burgers and a full sushi bar.  The only drawback is the TVs, which are constantly tuned to either World Series of Poker or Ultimate Fighting Championship.  Also the \"brewmaster special\" beer selections have been known to be pretty weird & unappetizing... like Raspberry Creme Ale.  Sounds like sweet chick beer to me... gimme real beer!  But as long as the very hoppy Pale Ale is available this is not a real problem!  This place can also get very crowded on Friday/Saturday nights, and so occasionally feels like some sort of feeding lot.",

That was actually surprising that there was pretty much no wait time compared to when we came here last year. We were seated right away and our host was super nice and attentive and really took care of us. My boyfriend and I LOVE the Ahi poke they have there.  It is really fresh and surprisingly good.  We came here last year and tried it out, and have decided to come back every time we visit.  It's pretty rare to come across fresh fish, let alone, fresh and tasty POKE, and... in vegas!? If you're looking for something meaty, try the 1lb t-bone steak.  It was good and cooked perfectly to our liking.  While you're waiting, try the hot crab and artichoke dip that comes with garlic bread and chips to spread or dip it in.  It's all kinds of cream, crab and buttery goodness.  If you're watching your cholesterol, I would say stay away from it, it's VERY rich, but if it's something you only have a couple times a year, I say go for it.  Like I said, we are definitely coming again and making a ritual out of it. =P",

I enjoyed the bar so much that I ate every meal during my stay there. Yeah, sounds lame but I don't give a shit, the place was nice and it was too damn hot to be strolling around. The microbrews were about a 3/5. The two I was looking forward to were out but oh well. They had a pale ale called Marker that I settled in on. While in vegas I only eat during happy hour(s) which is 3p-6p and  after midnight. The beers are $2 during HH. The food was 4.5/5..I had (not all at once) wings, nacho supreme, meatlovers flatbread pizza, broiled chicken sandwhich and a pepper crusted ribeye (medium). Man, that damn ribeye was delicious, came with a baked potato and greens for $15.99. When I stayed on the strip last year with friends, I payed $50 for a Ribeye at some place in Ceasars that couldn't touch this one. All in all this place was real chill, the bartenders were by in large real cool, some came off strange ( and stressed) but that's common, and I never had a problem getting a bar stool during HH. I think California Hotel and 777 will be my new set when in vegas solo for fights.",

Then her manager approached me and apologized but was clearly annoyed that I complained. I did receive my food in a timely manner and the food was tasty and well prepared. Just wish they treated their customers better.",

From 11 PM until 2 AM, they run an awesome deal where you get a 16 oz. beer and a 10\" pizza for $5. Yes, I repeat: BEER AND A WHOLE PIZZA FOR ONLY $5.00! One of the best, late-night deals downtown in my opinion. Plus, their pizza is good as hell. Screw that $4+ per slice sh*t elsewhere!  One extra shout-out to my usual bartender, Richard, for being awesome! :-)",

Out of 11 dishes nobody seemed to like what they had ordered. We came here as a family reunion type of event and we're severely disappointed :(",

I stopped in while in the area for a power lunch with a coworker that lives in the area before my return to OC last week and although the old school kitchy Vegas look was welcoming, the food was rather underwhelming. The menu is expansive and I think that the kitchen is running by the \"Jack of all trades, master of none\" mantra. I decided the San Fransisco Burger was the safest bet after some considerable consideration.   A Beef Patty is Charbroiled and then mated with Swiss, Lettuce, Tomato, Onion, Lettuce, a house sauce and toasted Sourdough. They nailed the temperature and all of the ingredients were of good if not great quality. With that said, it was a little boring if not an all out yawn. A mediocre burger in a fun environment nets a 3 star review all day, everyday.",

Great service, fast food and great specials. After 11 they have a beer and a pizza for $5. How much better can it get??   We always come after 11 for the special but we usually order more food than just the special. My boyfriend always gets the pizza and I usually get the jalapeno poppers with a few other things. Those jalapeno poppers are AMAZING. This time around I got wings and garlic fries. Honestly they were meh. But everything else I've had here was really great, from the margerhita pizza to the prime rib.  Again though, I can't stress how awesome Ron and Richard are!! I only come when they're here. They're always on top of it with new beers (my boyfriend drinks them EXTREMELY FAST) and with anything we need with our food. They're super personable and friendly. This has been our late night spot since we moved downtown and it's just great.   Thanks Ron and Richard!!!",

We ordered the Deep Fried Mushrooms which was not that good. I prefer a beer tempura batter and this batter just did not taste good.  I ended up removing all the batter and eating the mushrooms.  For my meal, I ordered the Chicken Fiesta Salad which I had with Ranch dressing. I enjoyed my salad as it had  lots of chicken and avacado.  Overall, my experience was great.

    "text": "My husband and I ate here during a football night. They give you a raffle ticket for every drink you buy. This place is a brewery and the beer was very good. It was happy hour and the 23 ounce beer was only $3. Can't beat that. We ordered from the happy hour menu and got the pretzels with cheese sauce. Very standard but satisfying. We also ordered the BBQ sliders which were good but not enough meat inside I would say. We also got the nachos from the happy hours which, for what they cost, were huge! That's probably the best thing on the happy hour menu as far as what we sampled.  I'm dinging this place one star because we sat at the bar because the hostess told us it was OK but someone had reserved the bar so she told us to sit down near one end, which we did. But the bartender hadn't arrived yet. We waited about 10 minutes and when the bartender showed up, he moved us. That was weird because it was supposed to be a party of six that had the bar reserved and we left enough seats. But whatever. The bartender was kind of short with us. So we left and then decided to come back and try to get a table. Which we did, even though it was busy. The waitress was good but our food took some time to get to us. Anyway, this is getting long so here's the breakdown:  1. Happy hour prices: 5 out of 5. 2. Beer selection and flavor: 5 out of 5. 3. Service: 3 out of 5. Needs work. 4. Location: Hard to find. 1 out of 5. (Once you get in the casino it's like a maze.) More signage and clearer directions, please.",

It's my home bar away from home. It's so great here, I wished I live closer. I have been coming here about once every 4-6 months for the last ten years.  Here is why.  Come here for happy hour. I believe it's weekdays from 3-6. I was lucky enough to make it down here despite the weekend traffic and stopping by Mirage for a quick conference this past Friday. Once here, if you were by yourself like I was, you will be fortunate enough to just hop to the bar, watch the NBA playoffs on the flat screens, have a beer in hand, and converse with the locals.  What do you order here during happy hour?   THE BREWMASTER SPECIAL.-I had a porter this time, which I might add, is something I usually do not drink. Folks, it was only $2 for a 16 oz. of handcrafter goodness and it was sweet and easy going down. Yes, I had more than one and note, you cannot get this flavor at the tables while you're playing.  I usually get the pale ale here, that is my favorite!   An order of hotwings-These aren't the best I've had but it's pretty damn good for sharing or if you're a pig like me, just eat it yourself and it'll set you back only $4.25.   An order of oysters-They are your normal oysters, nothing too special, though they are sweet and it is cleaned through well. 6 pcs are only $7.50. Comes with the cocktail sauce and horseradish.   These prices reflect only during happy hour. I have to say, this past Friday, I was really happy in less than an hour.",

Great brewery inside what looks like a 1850's train station.  Definitely old western look and feel.  Solid brewery look and appeal.  The crowd is a bit pathetic though being so far off the main drag and away from all the new stuff.  It took a $40 cab just to get here... uggh..     Beers were good but I'm not sure I'd go back because it was too depressing.  This place just doesn't have the visual eye candy of every other place in Vegas.   If I had just lost my life's savings and wanted to end it all, this would be the place to go out with a bang...",

That's it.  Burger was ok, service was extremely slow (MNF may have had something to do with that).

If you're a beer person, it should be on your short list of places to visit when in Vegas. What better excuse to drink than \"you can only have it here\"?   I sampled the strongly recommended black cherry stout, and it was complex with some coffee notes. Nothing weak about it, and you can definitely taste the cherry. Deliciously intoxicating.   I was pleasantly surprised by how clean and non-smoky the entire Main Street Casino was, and Triple 7 is spacious with super tall ceilings, which is such a refreshing change from the dark cavernous video poker establishments that dot every corner.   Service was fine. The food was average, plenty of fried, meaty items. I had the grilled vegetable sandwich, and it was acceptable. Their salad was a below average iceberg creation, so it's not really worth the extra bucks. Just accept you're going to be eating french fries if you head this way. Remember: you're going for the beer.",

They have a great deal at happy hour and after midnight on weekdays when beers are only  $2 (and their house-brewed beer is totally delicious). I keep going back for the Black Mud (brewed with coffee beans; I have yet to try dessert here, but I think this would pair fantastically with a brownie or cake something) and Winter Blues (delicious, delicious blueberry beer).  We have always had attentive service (on our last trip, our waitress was wiling to circumvent the late night menu and get us the mozzarella sticks my husband suddenly desired, which was super nice of her) and a good time for not too much money. Plus they are only closed between 7am and 11am, and I am never up at those hours, so they are effectively open 24/7. HOORAY!",

I mean seriously cheap like found dead on the road or something.  Terrible, terrible tasting!  And what teriyaki sauce??  I mean can't they just get it from the jar?  Ugh seriously one of the worst steaks we have ever tasted.  The baked potatao was bleh and the green beans were soft and mushy.  I guess I should have known when I seen the sour cream come in a packet.  I gave this place one star for the beer.  I got the High Roller Gold which was pretty good.",

The brewer made a special brew called \"Black Mud.\"  I sat at a table that ordered five different beers here, and the Mud was literally 100x better than the regular brews here.  Some of them were quite bland, but the black mud was a kick in the pants -- the kind of kick you want to start off your Fremont Street Experience.  If you are a fan of glorified yellow water (Bud/Miller/Coors), go home.  If you care about calories, you wouldn't be drinking beer in the first place (a 50 calorie beer is... well... water).  If you prefer taste and quality, grab yourself a Black Mud.  If they don't have any more, demand the brewer makes more for your next trip.  This establishment is on the beer map in my mind with the Black Mud.  It's so-so without it.  Hear my cry Triple 7.  Keep the good stuff.",

The Main Street Station isn't the fanciest of hotels, but it is still very clean and well kept. The 777 is definitely a diamond in the rough.  The 22oz large beers are great and fairly affordable for Vegas. They have a nice selection of house brews. I had the red ale and my buddy had the porter. Being a home-brewer myself, it was great to check out all of the brew equipment while waiting for the food.  I ordered the bbq chicken pizza. This thing was huge, easily 10-11\". I am a big guy and it filled me up plus leftovers. The crust was very crispy/chewy. A great interpretation of a NY crust. My friend had the portobello burger. He was totally stuffed afterward.  The waitress was nice and we both got out for about $16.  A+",

In my attempt to not drink alone and look like an alcoholic, I persuaded my sister to tag along.   Triple 7 has one of the best happy hours. Monday-Friday, 3-6, with the exception of Monday Night Football and holidays. $2 is the price for their house wine, well drinks, and house-made brews. Most importantly this encompasses said mango hef. It is nice to walk into a place during happy hour and not have to fit for a seat in a small section to take advantage of the special. No, Triple 7 let's the whole restaurant partake in this goodness. They have a limited HH food menu that consists of quesadillas, wings, calamari, and maybe two other items for 4.50. We ended up splitting an order of the calamari. The squid were lightly battered and flash fried. The tenderness of the meat is not toughened in the process and still came out crispy. Served with a side of spicy marinara and lemon wedges, it is a nice snack while drinking. Just not the best choice with the mango brew. My sister and I learned our lesson. Good on their own, bad in tandem.   Our server was attentive and checked in regularly without being obnoxious. Definitely worth a visit during happy hour.",

I came during happy hour and found the drink prices to be a steal ($2 for wine, well drinks, or a pint of their microbrewed stuff). The food stuff on happy hour is pretty weak. Most things are literally .50 off their regular price, and some only .25 off !   I tried the black cherry stout on my last visit . I adore fruit beers that are subtle and this one was awesome. Just that perfect amount of black cherry.. yumm! I paired my beer with some happy hour wings ($4.50), and found them to be just OK. I guess 12 wings for $4.50 is a decent price, but the wings weren't anything special. My friends got burgers and seemed relatively happy with them, but again, nothing special.   I think what this place lacks in quality they at least make up for in variety. Everything from sushi to pizza to meatloaf... no wonder all the food is just mediocre!!   I hate to say it, but if I had to compare this place to BJ's, I'd have to give BJ's the win. The food is better and the service is far better. That being said, when friends want to meet up for a dinner downtown, this is one of my favorite spots. I'll come here again, but wouldn't go out of my way.",

And on top of that, they also put hot sauteed veggies as a side on the plate.  So I had a pile of hot zucchini and onions wilting my tiny salad.  I thought that they got my order wrong but when I got the receipt it did say \"Steak Salad\".  It did taste pretty good overall though.    The beer was OK.

All good because I was a fan of the taste more so than the knock you on your butt effect.  The food is always great here as well. Ordered lots of things here.

    "text": "As my mother was staying at the Main Street Station, I decided to visit her after I dropped off my bags (from Hawaii), and try out the Triple Seven Microbrewery. I already had my order planned and ready before I arrived.  Guacamole Burger with Sweet Potato Fries- 3.5-stars- I ordered this one cooked to medium. At first, I couldn't find the guacamole, but it was under the cheese packed in tight. So it wasn't as gooey or squishy as I had first anticipated. The burger itself was quite juicy, and had a hint of salt which stood out. There is also a lot of olives between the meat and cheese as well. Between the tomato and lettuce was some surprisingly fresh red onions--it definitely hits you fast. I'm usually a fan of caramelized onions on my burgers. The sweet potato fries were average, yet crispy and delicious, as fries should be.  Crab and Artichoke Dip- 3.5-stars- The crab flavor hits immediately, and you can tell this is soaked with crab. The amount of oil was a bit off-putting for me, since it made me feel sluggish and tired. Little balls I thought were potatoes, my mother confirmed was indeed artichoke hearts. This is served with tortilla chips and flat bread. I would go with the bread to slather on the dip. Otherwise, your chips will crack under the hefty weight!  Loco Moco- 3-stars- I ended my trip the way I started, at the Triple Seven Microbrewery, as I waited for our shuttle to arrive. I ordered it medium rare, as I like to have some blood in the morning--I also hear, I sparkle in the sunlight. Either way, this one comes with a thick brown gravy, which seemed a good fit, but the flavor was overpowering. A mix of salty and robust, it overwhelmed the other ingredients. The egg, I ordered sunny-side-up. The burger was just a burger at this rate. Served hot enough, my tongue was a little singed for a day. The plate was definitely filling, but not too exciting over-all.  Blackchip Porter- 4.5-stars- I'm a lover of dark beers. I love the deep woodsy flavor which washes around in your mouth. This porter also has an earthy, chocolate flavor when you drink it. Served with a thick lather of froth on top. Definitely a beer worth trying.  Atmosphere- They really keep the look of the train station here. Huge glass windows show off their giant microbrewery, housing all their different beers. The wide open-space takes away from the look of a bar, which would be great for a place like this, and makes way for an almost family dining environment. Tons of tables and seats, rarely filled--since the next-door Garden Court attracts the big eaters. There is a lot which could be done with this place, and it's not out of reach either.  Service- Service is decently fast, with a touch of Aloha--since this is a very local hotel the way it's run. The meals were delivered quickly, and there are television screens all around to watch the games and sports-reels.  Conclusion- A good place when you're not feeling the buffet. The hours are pretty generous from 11 a.m. to 7 a.m., definitely a place to stop when you want a drink and something to eat after long hours of 20x odds on craps, slots, or blackjack tables. Also, it's so close to the wifi zone, you can get good reception while you eat and drink. The Downtown area of Vegas has a different feel to it, and this place fits right in.",

It's sort of an average brewery - average food and average beer. But I really like the layout of the place and the atmosphere. Plus, the bartenders are really nice and helpful.  The beer is all good, though nothing particularly stands out. Definitely opt for a sampler.   Everything I've tried from the menu has been good. The two most memorable items have been the burger (quite good for your average burger) and the hot wings. The wings are definitely above average. Average size and meatiness, but great sauce and kick, with good dipping sauces.  Personally, I always prefer to sit at the bar here. And it can be interesting people-watching and conversation eavesdropping. To top it all off, the prices are pretty good.",

    "text": "When its 1am and you're in Vegas sometimes you just want to go down to the restaurant in your hotel and avoid any hassles. Triple 7's is a nearly 24hr restaurant located in the Main Street Station Casino and is a cooler looking spot to have a beer but lacks in the food department  Parking: Tons of parking in the Main Street Casino Lot  Atmosphere: Probably the coolest restaurant in downtown. Kinda of a Gordin Biersch type of feel.  Huge breweries on one side and kitchen on the other.  Service: For the most part the 6 times I've eaten here went problem free. Sure most of the times its been after midnight when it was slow but all the waiters/waitresses have been more than adequate.  Beware of the weird hours.  Cost: Prices will run you around 7-11$ per person but overall its pretty cheap.  If you're getting sushi(in which I never have) each item will run you about 3-4$ which can easily get pricey. During happy hour(3-6pm M-F) they have a decent happy hour of $5 appetizers and better yet $2 beer & wines.  If you happen to be from Hawaii and are here with \"Vacations Hawaii\" then this restaurant participates in the food voucher program but your selection is kind of limited to mostly burgers and appetizers.  Food: So I've been here 6 times and for the most part I haven't been impressed. Sure most of the times I've had a free meal voucher which limited me to certain items but nothing was \"great\" on any of my trips. In fact my last visit I ordered the meat loaf which was just plain horrible. The meat loaf came out as a white pre made patty(which I assume was frozen) and has the texture of tofu made product.  The gravy was your typical packaged powered gravy that you would buy for $0.75 in the store.  If you go here stick with a simple burger or the pizzas have looked good  Conclusion: Triple 7 looks the part of a good brewery restaurant but just doesn't cut it on the food end. I'm pretty sure they have the same chefs as the big buffet next door because the food seem to be mass produced and on the cheaper end.  If you need a place to watch a game or go for after hour then it's not bad but don't get your hopes up.",

That beer was almost free. However, the beer just ok. There wasn't anything too special about it, aside from the price of course. If I remember correctly I had the Pale Ale and tried a couple of other samples. The bartender was cool and had no problem with talking to us about the beer.

I do have to say, this place claims to have award-winning microbrews and is known for their hand-crafted beer so food may not be their specialty.  SERVICE It really depends on who you get. Sometimes you get an attentive/friendly server constantly checking up on you and have conversation with you. Then there are other times you get a moody/bitchy server who seems to be having the worst day of her life.   FOOD  Philly Cheese Steak? Meh. Flavor was non-existent Chicken Breast Marsala? Chicken cooked with Marsala wine sauce. Meh. Monterey Chicken Sandwich? Chicken topped with Pepper jack cheese and avocado. Meh. Fish and Chips? Seems to be the popular item here. Tartar sauce on the side was good but fish was so dry. Meh.  I felt like leaving this place with all the disappointing food but then their old fashioned root beer float called my name.   It's a vanilla ice cream with Henry Weinhard's Old School Root Beer. Oh My God.  It's a simple, lovely delight. I've never been a fan of root beer float but wow. Where have you been all my life? It's not one of those cheapo root beer float you got at the high school festival. It's the real deal, and they make it good.   CONCLUSION Root beer float.",

    "text": "Came here for a quick bite to eat after flying in from Oahu. The restaurant looked busy however there was no wait, & watching it while we were eating looks like there is a quick turnover so I can't imagine a long wait.   It did take our server about 10 minutes to come take our order and she apologized. We got margaritas which I think was the best part of our meal. The food (a salad, veggies & rice, and steak and the blue burger and garlic fries) my fries were cold when I got them and the veggies were not that hot either. It seemed like it wasn't even sitting under the heater. Being a waitress and bartender myself I know the importance of people wanting their food fresh and hot. That is the reason for the lower rating. Other than that the experience was good, lots of tvs to watch games, sorta noisy, looks like a full bar, casino is right outside.",

    "text": "Triple 7 is a great place to catch a game and have a few drinks in the Main Street Station Hotel downtown. The restaurant/bar is a pretty good size with high ceilings, multiple TV's, a good crowd and a long bar. They're usually always busy but the food doesn't very long to come out. I've only had appetizers here; the nachos were awesome but I was really disappointed in the deep fried mushrooms. They tasted like dirt so I know they weren't rinsed well.   The customer service wasn't bad and watching the Giants win the World Series made my experience at Triple 7 even sweeter. It's a good place for groups and I'd consider returning if I'm looking for a few drinks and bar food at a great price. Most appetizers were an average of $8. Hard to beat that!",

The sandwich was delicious. The bread had a perfect crunch and was filled with pastrami, lettuce, tomato, and some mayonnaise. The sandwich had lots of flavor. It also came with crinkle cut French fries. The fries were cooked to perfection and melted in my mouth with a couple of bites. So good!  I've been here before but never wrote a review about it. They also sell beer and other flavors of beer. There are plenty of big screen television screens that play sports. Music is also playing in the back ground. It's very loud in the restaurant. Service was slow because it was busy. The waitress was very  nice and made sure we were okay.  I love coming here for lunch or dinner. This place is a must try.",

All i wanted to do was order take out for my ohana. I tried calling, no answer. So i went down with my daughters to go make a take out order, i was told by the front check in, to go to the bar to make a order. I told her i have my daughter's  and if its ok, she said yes. I went to the bar and two waitress came very rudely and told me and my daughters to leave the area. I explained to her that the front lady said to come to the bar and make the order. Then very rudely again, they both say to leave.  I understand vegas is all about a certain age , duh! But all ur employees def need to get on the same page. At this time, i was not feeling good, i did not have much voice. All i wanted was to order food for my daughters... Thats it... i would never visit this place again! Thats why we only stay in the Cal. They are much friendlier and willingly to listen and help. Negative 0 stars! And i never like to rate like this unless they were absolutely rude or disrespectful and this place was both. SMH. BTW, this was back in January, and im still upset about it. Someone bought up her experiance at this place to me and she was not happy either. So here goes my review .",

Aside from the grumpy lady who took 45 minutes to sit three parties in front of me,  I enjoyed myself.   We went on a Saturday night during a Packers vs Cardinals game and it was packed.   Nothing but good vibes here.    We ordered the prime rib meal $13.99 comes with a veggie and a carb (delicious steamed rice,  baked potato or mashed).   The quality of the beef wasn't that great but it was cheap so okay.    Tons of huge flat screens line the walls so there were no bad views of the game.   Waitress was pleasant and our food came quickly.    Aaron Rogers threw a Hail Mary to throw the game into OT and the \"Packers side \" of the place went crazy.    There was some poor chap in a faded Brett Favre Jersey who was crying his eyes out then started cheering.  Packers ended up losing in OT and it was back to crying again.    I enjoy coming here for good cheap food and the good vibes.   The cheesy bread appetizer is also very delicious.   I love how this place caters to local Hawaii people.   They serve steam rice and shoyu here,  and after not having any for a week,  it was heavenly.",

    "text": "Believe it or not, it's not easy to find local beers in Vegas. Most of the casinos have contracts with big distributers so they generally all carry the same beers from the biggest breweries. So if you want local, you have to seek them out.   Triple 7 is a restaurant/brewery located in the Main Street Station in downtown Vegas. They have a variety of standard bar type food (burgers, sandwiches, fried stuff) but they also have a sushi bar, which is cool.  But the best part in my opinion is that they brew their own beer. According to the menu they do a few hundred gallons at a time. When we dropped in they had 7 beers ranging from a pilsner to a stout so there's something for everyone. We did a taster and the styles were accurate and all very tasty. Great beers, all.   Lastly, this place is downtown so they aren't going to gouge you on the prices. I highly recommend this place.",

I was expecting good pub food; however, I left completely unimpressed and really never want to go back again.    The restaurant looks great, has some good theming and looks welcoming.  In fact, the hostess that was on duty was really great as well. She was so sweet!  However, that is where it ended.  Our server had a significant attitude issue, and clearly did not want to be at work.  On the menu was a special beer, and we asked her what it was and she said \"I'll have to go check with the back\".  Then she stood there, wanting to take our drink order.  We asked her if she could go check, and then she left while letting out a huge sigh.  She was just really rude the whole night.  We ordered the bacon wrapped jalapenos (awesome).  We also ordered the pork chop platter and the Chicken Tender platter.  The chicken tenders were pretty good; however, the pork chops were very dry and actually really gross.  They had no flavor at all.  So, we hit about a 50/50 on the food; however, the service pushed us into the \"never again\" territory.",

    "text": "Came to Triple 7 after playing some roulette at the Main Street Casino. Triple 7 is located inside of the Main Street Hotel and Casino, right next to the Garden Court Buffet. Every time that I have passed by it has always been super busy with a line of people waiting to get in. This time was no different, but our wait was only about 20 minutes.   The menu is quite large with a wide range of items ranging from fish and chips, to a wide range of sandwiches including reuben, philly cheese steaks and even pizza. I went with a reuben, well because it is my favorite sandwich in the world. It was quite a let down. The meat itself was still a little cold, and everything else was pretty dry. Nothing to rave about, but I've had worst reubens.  Others in my group had chicken tenders, pizza and fish and chips. It is pretty hard to ruin any of those dishes so everything was alright. I did not get an opportunity to try any of their micro brews, but will do if I ever find myself back at Triple 7.",

He left our food up under the heat lamp at the kitchen for over 15 minutes while he b******* with another customer. Not to mention the rude temperament from the get-go. But I usually give people the benefit of the doubt initially. And hope that it will get better. Well it didn't. In fact when my burger funally got delivered to me one bite of it I told him he could keep it and I wasn't paying for it. And we  left I'll try them again next time hopefully we'll have better service. And hopefully that guy found a job that he doesn't have to deal with people.",

I ordered the San Francisco burger last night and my husband got the happy hour nachos that arrived with the top layer of chips burned and black and had an identifiable very salty, mushy meat that was most likely leftover pot roast from the buffet. My burger was supposed to be on buttered sourdough with swiss cheese, but arrived on dry,?cheap white bread with the cheese not even melted, and not even on the meat itself. The burger had no taste and was very small. $12.99! Yuck. I don't drink beer, but my husband liked the $2 & $3 beer at happy hour.",

It was surprisingly cleaner and better looking than I had expected. The menu had several options, which made it easy to find something for even the pickiest eater. I was not pleased with how hard they fried the calamari, but the sauce for it was tasty. I ordered the salmon, and it was cooked perfectly along with the mashed potatoes. The veggies were tasteless as they were extremely over cooked. The only thing they could definitely improve on was the service, as our waitress was hustling, but super slow. I could see she was trying but it took to long to get our drinks and appetizers. All in all I give this place a good overall rating. Even with the areas of needed improvement, the well cooked salmon made up for it!!",

They serve them with ranch and a salsa ranch. The salsa ranch didn't taste like salsa but it was better then the regular ranch.

The sirloin steak I ordered was delicious and cooked perfectly. It came with very good green beans and a baked potato. It was also a good size for $15.99.   We also ordered raw oysters on the half shell that were pretty good (not as flavorful as the oysters in the South) and came with the usual horseradish, lemons, hot sauce, etc on the side. Six oysters for $9.99. =)  Our waitress didn't see us seated in her section for quite a while, which was getting frustrating, but we were seated in the corner out of view. Once she noticed us, she immediately made up for it with a very friendly personality and she made sure to get our food out to us very quickly, despite a packed restaurant. If you're in that area of Las Vegas, I highly recommend this restaurant!",

It's served in a cheese tortilla bowl, with ice burg lettuce, some crumbled bacon, diced tomato and eggs and your choice of salad dressing.   I got the vinaigrette.  The salad was a decent size, however, the \"cheese bowl\" it was served in was a little stale, and the vinaigrette was too strong.  Service was good, I love the large glass they use for their beverages, no refill was needed it was so big.",

There is a weekday Happy Hour, but we just missed it.  Also, don't depend on the website for prices, as they were slightly higher when I looked at the current menu.   There was quite a crowd- it's a popular spot. We went to the bar, and the hostess said she'd get us a table as they opened up, because nothing was open. So we went to the bar, which was about 75% capacity, when we arrived. And about 20 minutes later, it was full. My friend had a soda, and I had a glass of merlot (not bad)- for both drinks, it was less than $6. There was only one bartender- and he was busy. He was nice, though; he gave us the receipt so we could show it to the server, for a free refill on the soda.   So our friend got there and she got us a table (??? not sure but I think that the hostess forgot about us, because people kept coming inside, and getting tables). Our server was busy too. So we ordered 6 rolls (spicy tuna, california roll, caterpillar & philadelphia) and split them. The bill was $51- which between 3 people, plus tip, was $20 each- that wasn't bad.   I like that the restaurant space is very wide open and not dark at all- with a view of the brewery too. If you don't wanna wait, I suggest you get there early, especially on a Friday night. Lunch & Dinner menu has appetizers, salads, soups/chili, sandwiches, burgers, pizza, brewmasters favorites, dinner specials, & desserts. I don't drink beer so I can't tell you anything about it, except that the prices seem reasonable. The last time I was here (my previous relationship), I had the peel and shrimp bucket deal (it's pretty big). The casino itself is pretty smoky, FYI.",

During happy hour I believe the beers cost $2.50. I think I paid about $4.00 dollars. What the heck? That is super cheap for a craft beer!   The food is good; we tried the sweet potatoes fries, garlic fries and Buffalo wings. Everything was super tasty, particularly the garlic fries and the wings. It is bar food though, so I would stick with burgers and appetizers.   I will be back real soon and will make the most of the happy hour.

    "text": "Don't come here with a party of more than 4 especially if your planning on dining. There was a  party of 6 before us and triple 7 said they couldn't put tables together. When it was our turn, party of 7, triple 7 said the same thing. Our tables were next to each other but still didn't allow it us to put the tables together or closer to each other.  There are bar top seating also that should accommodate large groups if open.  They brew some really good beer which gives them some originality. There's also a sushi bar, weird because it gives you that typical bar feel but with sushi. Haven't tried the sushi, can't imagine it being any good but I wont know until I try them.  Food wasn't that bad but it didn't stand out as amazing. There was a chicken caesar salad which had too much cilantro. The prime rib plate came with choice of sides.  The prime rib was big but not the best cut of prime rib I've had.  There was a bunch of tough fatty pieces that was chewy. The bake potato was small and not so attractive and only came with packet sour cream and butter.  They also had a BBQ chicken breast and half rack of ribs combo.  Very delicious only suggestion is having the BBQ sauce on the side because it was spicy instead of sweet which they didn't mention.  I had their beers a long time ago. Can't judge them on it cause it was a long time ago and forget how it was. But local so that's a plus.  Large dining area, lots of seats and tv around so it doesn't fill crammed.  Good service and feels like a good place to chill and kick back a few brewskies.",

Next thing I know, it's past midnight and my last meal was around 3pm.  Because we were staying at California hotel & casino in downtown, we made our way to Triple 7.  We just crossed a bridge that connected to Main Street Station hotel -- very convenient because it was too hot to walk or drive outside.    This place has a bar and grill type feel to it.  In fact, you can see the microbrewery in the restaurant.  My brother claims that their beer has slightly more alcohol than regular beer.  He got their beer sampler for $5.99, which got him surprisingly buzzed, along with an order of nachos.  I ordered a teriyaki burger and the crab & artichoke dip.  My sister-in-law ordered buffalo wings and an italian sausage pizza.  My sister-in-law's cousin ordered the philly cheesesteak.    Little by little, the food came out and I was surprised at how big the portions were.  I truly didn't expect it from the prices whatsoever.  It was to the point where we contemplated on switching to a bigger table to have more space for all the plates.  The service was okay, though our server wasn't anywhere to be found when we needed her, but she was nice.    The crab & artichoke dip was great.  I didn't really taste the crab but it was super cheesy and it came with chips and garlic bread.  The buffalo wings were decent.  The italian sausage pizza was pretty decent also.  I love that they don't skimp on the cheese, whether it be on the nachos, my dip, or the pizza!  The teriyaki burger was nothing special.  I told the waitress I wanted it medium well but it seemed like I got it well done because it was dry.    Overall, this is a great place to hit up for appetizers and beer.  Cheap eats and great atmosphere.",

We shared a burger, it was average.  We also had a couple Irish Stouts.  The Triple 7's Irish stout was thinner and less sweet than Guinness stout.  For Las Vegas it seemed like a fairly good deal.  A 1/2 pound cheeseburger and fries and 2 draft stout beers for just under 16 bucks.",

Originally if you wanted to leave a review you were lumped in to review the casino, rv park or other restaurants inside the Main Street Station. So I added a place to specifically review the brewery. The Heffy was really thick with a strong citrus taste.. Too thick in my opinion. The wheat beer had an awesome caramel taste and I loved it. We got the smothered chips which were decent, flat bread meat pizza which was good, California rolls and that was good, boneless chicken wings.. Meh they kinda sucked. I would highly recommend them coming here for a happy hour or to watch your sport on tv",

    "text": "I finally got to check this place out after being invited out for a round of beer.  Mind you, the beer here is strong, but incredibly good.  I had one of their blueberry based beers, and it was like drinking a dessert.  Their microbrewery is huge, and is housed in an even larger room.  The layout is very, very classy, and best of all, no smoking, so I was able to enjoy my drinks even more.  The real winner for me was the crab and artichoke dip served with chips and garlic bread.  I'm a fan of both seafood AND dips, and this particular combination had me scraping the bowl for every last attainable morsel.   The service was also great.  The guy was on top of things, never obtrusive, but always around for a refill.  And when I looked at my final tab, the price was ridiculously cheap for what I ordered.  Quality foodstuffs for a really workable price.  Make no mistake, I was pretty comfortable by the time I strolled out of the place.  The beverages kicked in as we were leaving, and honestly, it was more the relaxed buzz variety than the staggering out, \"please hold me up\" type.  I attest that to the overall quality and flavor of the drinks.  I don't hear a lot of people talking about this place, and I don't know why.  It's certainly something to check out while adventuring on Fremont Street.",

Alas, the \"cocktail\" was four Jumbo Shrimp on a small plate with 2 tablespoons of cocktail sauce. And it was $11! We couldn't believe it was soo small & plain. When the menu said legendary we can say it was unforgettably sad. And so the search continues... Must say the Beer Battered Shrimp was a much better dish if you are craving shrimps. Service is good, the place is clean & modern and the selection of beers was impressive.",

Let me tell you, it was an incredible dog, the meat was so smooth and rich, like a veal sausage and the chili had big pieces of steak in it.  The beer was also top notch.  They are a microbrewery and they know their stuff.  I have been a few times and have always gotten the beer sampler flight which is a good deal for the price and the amount of beer.  The High Roller beer that I had tasted almost of butterscotch, very unique and good.  On the other had the cherry beer tasted of cough syrup which was not so good.  The only thing keeping this place from getting a 5th star is that the service is not great and the food took quite some time to get to us.  However, for the quality and the price, this place is hard to beat in downtown Las Vegas.",
