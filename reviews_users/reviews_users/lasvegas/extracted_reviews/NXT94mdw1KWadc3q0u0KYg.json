Our guy was very friendly and efficient!  Really like the variety of food offered and how well everything was prepared. It didn't look or taste like food had been sitting out forever which can be the case with many buffets here in LV. You must try the seafood soup with crawfish sitting on top. The clear broth is not too salty and full of flavor from the potatoes and various seafood.",

I couldn't get a piece of beef from the carving station Medium Rare. I asked the Lady she said that was all they had. The carne asada was decent. The ONLY thing my boyfriend and I cared for was the french onion soup that came in mini bowls the kind you would serve flan in, I had two little bowls. After finishing the second bowl I ended biting into broken glass what looked like a chipped piece of a plate. Turns out the dishwashers are not careful and too rough while cleaning plates. They chip plates! The manager was very nice but they didn't even OFFER to comp my bill. She only offered five $5 dollar coupons (which I don't care for cause I won't be going back) but I had to ask for my money back. I am just disappointed. The food wasn't all that great to begin with and then ontop of that I end up with broken glass in my mouth.",

Turnover early on a Wednesday evening was a noticeable issue with some small plates obviously sitting under the heat lamp too long. Equally disappointing was the absences of more ethnic dishes.  Our favorite pair of dishes were the duck cassoulet with white beans (me) and an ambrosia salad (wife). Some dishes just plain did not work, a New England clam boil that included a crawfish, but no clams and a ceviche with almost no identifiable seafood.  Unfortunately for my wife, the highly acclaimed bread pudding was dried out and could not be saved by copious amounts of caramel sauce. Service proved to be above average.",

Was very much looking forward to eating at this buffet after flying in from California to vacation in Vegas. First, they allowed a older man with a CHIHUAHUA to enter the casino and feed the dog from his plate as you can see in the pics the food on the floor and the lovely pooch waiting for his food. Second, their \"paella\" looked more like potato mush from yams. Rice was soggy and turned into a pile of mush (see pics). Third, their food labels did not match the dishes displayed. You can see a cabbage salad that was labeled \"Cous cous salad\" this was just one of many dishes mislabel. Their white rice tasted like plastic and when I asked the hostes about it she said \"oh it's just hard\". Huge disappointment, Horrible tasting food, infection control issues and safety hazards with food mislabeling.",

I've never been to the old Palms buffet, but hearing that it was going to be remodeled and taken over by Station Casinos, I knew I'd have to give it a try. Given that I knew Red Rock Hotel and Sunset Hotel had good buffets, I had high hopes and this buffet surpassed those expectations.  The variety of food you can choose from is crazy. They've got the best and deepest variety of of food of any Station Casino Buffet and also a few other hotels on the strip. The food itself all looks, smells and tastes great.   Service is good too. When we came in, we had Patrica and she was excellent. She was incredible friendly and made a lot of fun conversation. She also was very fast with refilling drinks and collecting dirty plates from the table.  Overall this buffet is fantastic, and is up there as one of the best in town.",

While this buffet is not as expensive as most buffets located on the main Strip, I was not as satisfied. There were about 5 stations, then a station for dessert and another for soup and salad. Each station had very little options and we ended up eating maybe 1 1/2 plates each. The price for 2 kids and 2 adults was $83 or so. I do wish that the kids prices were a little more appropriate as I believe it starts charging kids the same price whether you are 2 or 10 and the cost is almost the same price an adult. Personally, I probably would not come back, they aren't the worst but I would rather pay the additional cost and just go to a different buffet. On a positive note though, free parking and the buffet was easy to find. Also, there was no line to get in.",

The JAPANESE restaurant nearby west of here was closed Monday so we crossed east to Palms. The Noodle place inside seemed a nice place for a light lunch. We decided to gamble a bit, wash up and come back, but passed by the AYCE buffet. We asked to take a peek inside and was surprised to find out that the Palms Casino became part of the Station Casino group since October 2016. Walking around the buffet stations, the presentation was three grades above last night's Sunset Station Fiesta Buffet (even better dressed) customers, the fresh looking smaller portion food selection. Roasted Calamari was tender, great Italian pizza, Stromboli, Carne Azada, tasty fried fish pollock, mussels, Asian, Italian, Spanish, American, European selections, friendly atmosphere and servers. CHOCOLATE and other  GELATO Ice cream and baked selections. I'm glad the Japanese place was closed and we did not go back to the noodle place next door. HAPPY BIRTHDAY to Marilou, my Most Beautiful Girl in the World! We've been eating too much, anyhow this is one place where you can enjoy quality at an affordable price and walk out gracefully contented and not bursting! We'll be back soon.",

Everything I tried was good which is unusual for a buffet, they also had some unique dishes like flamin hot Cheetos elote (omg!) and buffalo Mac and cheese. I don't eat meats, only fish, but the meats looked really good. They had vegan desserts labeled which I thought was nice and gelato station. The service was good as well. I wouldn't hesitate to go especially for the great prices, you get $1 off if you have a players card FYI.",

The atmosphere here is really cool and new, Palms is doing well with the renovations so far. I've been to the GVR and Red Rock buffets but AYCE definitely offers some creative dishes. My favorites include the (pesto?) pasta during lunch and the small salmon dishes and different Mac and cheeses during dinner. My body is highly likely made of 35% cheese. Confused as to the reviews that mention \"not enough shrimp in the bucket...\" It's... a buffet. Go get... more? If you're a fan of buffets definitely try it out!!",

A fellow yelper told me that buffets in Vegas are the way to go. A.Y.C.E was definitely a hot spot for my friends and I on our most recent stay at the Palms hotel in Vegas.  Prices for a breakfast buffet is unbeatable. I believe we payed around $14 per person (get the rewards card in the lobby for $2-$3 discount) and for $10 more you could get unlimited mimosas. Ok when you're from Miami, you know this is a steal! Food was very tasty to my surprising, as I'm not used to going to buffets. My friend was addicted to the egg benedicts they had, my boyfriend loved the omelettes, and I loved getting there between breakfast and lunch to get their sushi!! I'm not the biggest breakfast person but I did enjoy the best of both worlds.  Remember that prices change from breakfast, lunch, and dinner. On the weekend, come early because you might get stuck in a long line and miss the price you want (Speaking from experience here)! Last but not least, they have an amazing section just for dessert!",

In my mind I thought they were referring to an all you can eat restaurant, Lol. I quickly learned that a new local buffet just opened recently at Palms.  Upon arriving, there was a decent size line but it move quickly and seemed like the turnover is quick. Overall, the staff at AYCE were very friendly and had a great systematic way of clearing tables and refilling drinks in a timely and efficient manner. So kudos to the staff!! The ambience reminded me of Wicked Spoon at Cosmo with a bit of Social Libertine at Mandalay Bay. Kinda, of hipster style but value minded buffet that was surprisingly delicious.  Everything I had was pretty good. I personally like... -Beef Brisket, Tender and the spices was good. -Corn Bread, Moist and flavorful without being dried out. -Raclette Station, Build your own mixed veggie and meat with melted cheese on top.  -French Macaroons, these were amazingly delicious and they a good variety of flavors. -Gelato Ice Cream Sandwich Station, This was cool and satisfying. Build your own ice cream cookie sandwich!  Overall, a great value buffet and satisfying dishes that will pleased everyone's taste buds.  2018 Yelp Review #16",

    "text": "Since my fiance loves buffets and we wanted to try somewhere new, we decided to try a place, which was a bang for your buck. We went here multiple times just to see if their items change on different days during lunch and dinner.   Inside the Palms casino, the buffet is not hard to find. We first went around lunch time, right at opening. Score! We got in right away and since my fiance has a station casino card we both paid $22 bucks and it came to $25 for an all you can eat buffet and unlimited drinks. The only thing you have to pay for is alcohol of course. However, you can get unlimited mimosas if you ask at the register which is normally $10.   Walking around the buffet they have salads, meats, Mexican, Asian, Italian, and the dessert station. Things to note: salad station was awesome they had different types to choose from and a huge variety. I ended up getting the cucumber salad. Every time I have eaten it, always on point. Enough sauce and flavor from the onions. Next up, their Asian food, would of liked more selection (more Japanese foods, Chinese foods, and Filipino food). But I sure did enjoy the pot stickers, spring rolls, and salt and pepper chicken wings. Pot stickers are my all time favorite and these ones are crispy on the outside with the perfect amount of pork and seasoning on the inside. Spring Rolls, perfect size, not too small or too big and add the hot chili dipping sauce it makes it to die for if you love things hot like me. The salt and pepper wings, sounds mediocre at first. Let me tell you, you gotta try these.Surprisingly, these are juicy, hot and reminds me of the chicken wings my mom makes for me.   You cannot stop there. The meats are pretty good, especially if you love pulled pork, turkey, chicken (chipotle lime) and chicken pot pies. All of them were tender, juicy, extremely flavorful. Only thing is, it can be hit or miss on some days with the chicken (it was a little dry the last time around). Italian food, wish they had more of a selection here too. You can find pizza, a pasta building station, garlic bread, Stromboli, and penne. Not a big fan of pizza, and the only thing was their pasta station did not have much to choose. The Mexican station opted out since I was not craving it at all.   Save the best for last, desserts. Just like most buffets, they have a soft serve station, gelato, mini cakes, and mini desserts, ambrosia and fruits. The best part was the apple cobbler w/the soft serve. Dipping your spoon into the hot, ooey, gooey goodness, of warm apple and cinnamon makes you want to go back for more.   All in all, good buffet to go to if you wanna save and still enjoy the food. Will be back to try breakfast in the near future!",

But the food. There is no seafood, which is understandable for the price you're paying for. There is a smattering of smaller prepared seafood dishes like a pail of shrimp cocktail, small small small dishes of poke, and cooked fish. The shrimps were super tiny and reminiscent of the ones you get in the freezer section that you can stir fry. It didn't taste fresh. The poke bowls barely had any taste to them. Bottom line, stay away from most of the seafood. The cod with lemon and capers was not bad though. There is a decent assortment of meats, but most of us felt that they were too dry. I think there was a general consensus that the food was dry because the turnover rate isn't as fast as those buffets on the strip. I think my favorite dish of the night was the wedge salad lol.  I think for the price, the food quality was fair. Would I come here on my own volition? Probably not. I think it's a good option for groups though since there is a decent variety.",

Staff was very patient with us since we were a big group, the food turned out better than I expected, and our server Dwight was just amazing and always on top of it - especially when we were ordering bottomless mimosas.   The only thing that slightly ruined the experience was when I was waiting in line at the buffet & a perverted man was talking to me very inappropriately trying to get me to \"have fun with him\" that night. I thought he was joking i said huhh???? Lol I had enough of him talking to me so I just walked away from him very uncomfortable. Thankfully, security & the assistant manager Mary saw what happened and kicked him out. Thank you security for handling that & Mary for talking/apologizing to me afterwards. It made me feel more safe. I really appreciated it!  Overall, I had a great time with my friends with great food & outstanding service.",

At $11 per person (with a \"Preferred\" Stations casinos card) it simply cannot be beat. It's not a typical buffet - it's what Vegas buffets should be - your traditional breakfasts dishes taken to elevated level with a chef's touch.    The food was better than expected. I really liked all the varieties of single-serving bowls; most or all of them had a poached eggs inside, great for mixing. With the poached eggs were corned beef, ham, rice, or bbq benedict. Of course they had the omelet station - gotta have it. Pancakes & french toast with fresh berries. Oh and the meats! Freshly carved ham, sausages, bacon, country fried steak... All so good.   There's lots more like an Asian section with noodles, potstickers, and pork baos, an Italian section with bready pizza and the like, a \"Revival\" station for vegan/vegetarian section for superfoods like yogurt and freshly squeeze juices, and of course since it's breakfast so much from the bakery - croissants, rolls, bagels, pastries and so much more I didn't get a chance at because I was so full.  I'm getting sleepy from the food coma so I'm going to end it there. Maybe when I wake up, I'll go back and check out the dinner... Zzz Zzz Zzz",

The meat was super over cooked very tough and very dry. They had a great assortment of deserts (looked super pretty) but all the deserts were super dry. Cupcakes, cake, bread puddings all dry. Cookies crumbled and tasted nasty, which really sucks because I'm a big desert person. The only good thing they had were the shrimp cocktail,the mongolian bbq and the ice cream bar and soft serve. Everything else was terrible. The staff also just walks around and lets all the plates pile up. I had to ask someone twice to remove the empty plates that were on our table, and the lady had a slight attitude as if she didn't want to do her job. I will not be coming back to this place the next time I visit Vegas.",

I caught his attention to ask for another and he looked annoyed, saying he would give me another but he was leaving soon and had to go. It looked like the table next to me stiffed him, so I understood his bad mood. He brought me another and I made sure to tip him then since he was leaving and I planned on staying to finish out the two hours of mimosas I paid for.   After he walked away, I asked what looked like a manager where the restrooms were. She kindly told me they were outside of the buffet. I asked if it would be ok to go and come back in and she said that it was fine. For safe measure, I let the hostesses know I was just going to the restroom and would be returning.   I went to the restroom and came back (maybe 4-5 minutes) and my table was cleared and reset for two. I stood at it with a confused look trying to catch someone's attention, but no one seemed to notice or care so I left. Not just the buffet, but the whole casino. I had planned on having my mimosas and spending my afternoon at some slots, but the service from AYCE buffet left too bad of a taste in my mouth to remain in the building.",

Other buffets are so expensive and food quality is so low but here it was not the case. They had salmon, make your own pasta station, the dessert section was incredible! They even had a vegan/ vegetarian section I did not eat it but did see it.   The portions here are small so you can eat a little bit of everything. I like the small portions because there is less food waste and more space to try foods.   I really enjoyed their desserts- macaroons, cheesecake, ice cream, cookies so many things and most made in house.   I will be back :)",

Since this became a stations casino, we wanted to try out their buffet and compare it to all the others we've been too. I can say, with the quality of food and service, we liked it as much as Red Rock! Maybe even more?! Haha or maybe I was just really hungry! We came here for lunch, closer to dinner time and I think I was obsessively eating their chicken pot pie and Brussels sprouts. Anything I can throw some tabasco sauce on, I probably ate extra of it. Their sushi was decent. The Asian Section has this salt and pepper chicken wings which were pretty good when it came out hot. I also enjoyed their Italian section. Can't go wrong with someone cooking it fresh in the back for you! :) I'll update my review the next time I go here again. Good service! Good food for the price and spacious setting. Happy eating my fellow Yelpers :)",

One this I like it that is you need something prepared they are willing to make it for you. The waitresses and waiters are also very attentive to your drinks and plates clearing the tables. I don't have try and find someone to get refills. I would come back here again also I would recommend this place to anyone wanting to try a newer updated buffet. The wait in the lines are not really long, it might seem like it because they way they look but it moves rather quickly.",

    "text": "A.Y.C.E, short for \"all you can eat\" opened up a little over a week ago on the ground floor of the Palms hotel.  After eating here last night, here's my top 5 things to know about Las Vegas' newest buffet:  1. Corn on the cob three ways! They brushed grilled corn with mayo and rolled it in crushed Doritos, Flaming Hot Cheetoes, and Cojita Cheese. It is soooo good I ate 4!!! 2. New to the buffet scene, they serve Thai Penang pork and Korean Kalbi beef ribs.   3. They catered to both ends of the spectrum. As a vegetarian I was happy to find healthy light vegetarian dishes like tofu lettuce wraps as well as mushroom quesadillas and my husband who loves his meat found loads of southern BBQ beef.  4. With a Station Casinos player's card you get a discount at the door.  Also, Station mails out 2-for-1 buffet coupons about every month when you sign up for a player's card. They apply here. 5.  Look for the Cinnamon-sugar coated taco shells at the dessert station! Yummy!!  We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves and at less than $20/person including tip (without a 2-for-1 coupon) it can't be beat.",

Price is super cheap compared to the buffets on the main strip and a few dollars more than what you would find at your local stations casino.  I feel for the price of it you do get a lot for your money and that is why I reflected it as 4 instead of 3 stars but at the same time you do get the quality of food that you pay for so don't expect everything to be perfect or fresh tasting.  I went for dinner but overall especially for breakfast you can't beat this value",

Too many foods are sitting out and getting cold. The few places that require someone to cut something for you or serve are always understaffed--have to wait around to get helped. Big headache is president chairman line consistently allows anyone to stand in the line. 3 times in a row I was behind low tier card holders that cashier didn't care were in wrong line. I complained each time and was met with blank stare of indifference. They need better signage for that line.",

    "text": "This is the newest addition to the Las Vegas buffet scene, and it did not disappoint.  It may be out of the way for types that like to stick to the strip, but the Palms is a fun excursion and the buffet is an added bonus. I really don't remember anything about the previous buffet, and I'm something of a Vegas buffet connoisseur, so that's definitely a sign it needed an upgrade.  I came for lunch and the wait in line wasn't terrible, about average for that time of day. The thing that attracted me was the price, its an amazing value for what you get and especially compared to some others around.   The inside is beautiful, open, and bright.  Its easy to navigate, and not overwhelming.  Our waitress was attentive and it seems to be fully staffed.  One thing I love about this buffet that set it apart are all the little dishes. Instead of just scooping out heaps of food on a spoon, they make up these little bowls and plates, almost tapas style. Not only does it help control how much food you get, it just seems a lot less messy and more quaint.   That said, everything was good! The sliders were amazing, and they have an entire section for vegetarian/alternative options that wasn't just a salad bar (I think this is the first time I've seen this at a Vegas buffet?)   I'm very interested to come back for dinner, considering how good lunch was. I certainly think its worth the hike off the strip.",

Price for what it wasn't was a waste of money. Very underwhelmed by choices. Again the temperature of the food was not even warm.  That is a huge no, no in the food industry and a turn off for me when eating any food that should be at least moderately hot. So let's skip brunch food and get dessert for breakfast.  Ice cream sandwich looked good but the cookie holding the ice cream was so damn hard by the time you could jackhammer It with your teeth the ice cream would slip out of the cookies. The fruit was good. I gave it a fair shot A.Y.C.E. buffet.",

My wife and I used to eat at Palms very frequently before they were remodeled. We ate lunch there recently, so we do not know the quality of the dinner. Most of the foods are not hot and tasteless, especially those with small container or bowels.  First, for value and quality, former Palms Bistro Buffet was much better than the new A.Y.C.E buffet. The old Bistro Buffet had quality salad bar and Italian station.  Second, compare with the other Station Casinos, We like the Place Station which is cheaper and offers quality foods. Yes, they do not have fancy environment. But for value and quality, we would like to eat there. Besides, Santa Fe station is also a good choice. Both Palace Station and Santa Fe Station offer better foods than Palms and Red Rock. Red Rock have not changed a dish for many years, unbelievable!  We think the only thing the new A.Y.C.E is better than the old Bistro Buffet is the desserts.",

We came here for lunch on a weekday and yes, the cost was fair but, that's about it. Its not a lot of variety of food dishes to choose from. The only beef option was a slider and the top of the bread was rock hard. Nothing was seasoned at all. The only chicken dish They had was salt and pepper wings that had neither seasonings. Not broccoli, string beans or any basic buffet foods. They had blackened catfish that looked more like a Mexican fish dish. I had mashed potatoes that still had huge chunks of raw potato in it that choked me. The pork loin and turkey I had was dry. Fried rice was hard as its been sitting out all day. Lunch started at 11, we arrived at noon. I have no idea why or how this place is 4 stars. $65 wasted. No, I won't be returning.",

That is a HUUGE advantage the Palms has over the other casinos. Second, the casino is about top-notch as any casino on the strip. Third, the best reason to come here is the buffet. I have eaten here a couple of times since it opened. I ate here again today and I loved the service and the good quality of the food. The staff was very nice and the food was very fresh and tasty. I am always satisfied and anyone considering trying this place should look no further. Give it a try. Compared to other casinos on the Strip, with A.Y.C.E., the price is right and food is really great. I will definitely come back here, especially when family and friends visit Las Vegas, I will take them here.",

    "text": "This is actually a very good buffet located at the Palms casino.   Off strip casino buffets are often inferior to their strip cousins, but this one is an exception.   The interior is modern and updated and, dare I say, maybe even a bit trendy?  Food stations are mostly along the back wall and are clearly labeled, clean, and well stocked. There is a carving station with turkey breast, beef, and sausage. There's a decent Asian food selection, plenty of American favorites, and interesting sounding international fare (Moroccan lamb anyone?). Many of the dishes are presented in small, single serve portions on small plates ala Wicked Spoon at Cosmo. They don't have crab legs which is fine with me but might annoy some. The dessert section is ample including ice cream and gelato, hot desserts like bread pudding, and some truly excellent macarons. These macarons really were far above the quality one would expect from a buffet especially considering how devilishly tricky they are to make (I know from experience)  Drinks are delivered by your server, and service was excellent throughout.   Topping it all off the price is excellent - around $20 for dinner. Very hard to beat and much less than the $40-$50 for strip buffets like Wicked Spoon.   AYCE is well worth the visit!",

It's not your typical Buffet because the food is prepared in smaller batches so it's fresh. From the meats to the Asian,Mexican,Indian,American and more, it was really good! I went for lunch under $20 REALLY.  I had to wait in line about 20 minutes, but I would do it again.  I've put this on my list of return places to visit! Casino was well laid out too and very clean. Make this a place to stop, good parking as well and no charge! Enjoy!",

Lots of different veggie dishes to choose from. Even ratatouille! Bread pudding was great as well, I even had a second portion. Our server was awesome as well. Her name is Kazi! So sweet. She was a delight! We spoke to the manager before we left about the awesome changes since it's reopened. Fantastic job!! We will return!",

I'm a regular having been there for breakfast, lunch, weekends, & even holiday dates!  - No sizeable line to speak of, worst case was 20 people ; smallest line was no one else & got right in - pricing is inexpensive & 1/2 the cost compared to other buffets of similar quality & uniqueness like Bacchanal, Wicked Spoon, Bellagio - Healthy foods at a buffet like buffalo cauliflower, hummus, quinoa....  - gluten free like rice congee, macarons...  - more vegetarian stuff than anywhere else like beet hummus, rainbow chard, farrow, rainbow artisan cauliflower in purple & orange, baba ganoush, cous cous salad  - Something for everyone like chilaquiles, corned beef hash with nicely poached egg, ham, turkey, pizza, shrimp cocktail in a pail....  - unusual stuff not seen at other buffets like lamb, farro, white elotes, hot CheetosTM elotes regular CheetosTMelotes, ceviche, salt & pepper wings/drumsticks  - try something you've not had before without feeling like you wasted any money like fresh lemonade with chia seeds (maybe chia's more mainstream than I know?) or shaksouka  - the menu changes so it's different stuff even if I've gone there over 20 times it's definitely still exciting (well, I lead a very calm life)  - chocolate dipped strawberries, gelato, mini m & m's, key lime parfait  - really great service on clearing stuff & refreshing your coffee, tea, or milk, soda  -hey, I even answered a bunch of questions about this AYCE buffet to help people out like not closing in between breakfast to lunch to dinner  PS see you there, I'm going to do a yelp event here!!",

    "text": "All the reviews are True. This buffet is simple, delicious, and AFFORDABLE.   I have been pretty disappointed with the way the buffets in Vegas have increased their prices so much over the last 4 years to the point where a family of 4 will cost around $200 for a meal. When you think of Vegas, you think oh...yes...will eat a buffet. Now it's kind of..which one is decent enough to shell out 40-50 bucks at.   Well here at AYCE, the service is excellent, the food great, and the entire facility is clean! There isn't a huge line you'd need to wait for and parking is free.  With a free players card, you'd look to pay $19.99 for dinner instead of $21.99 and if you are gold status you're getting your meal for $17.99.   Definitely worth it. I will say however, this buffet might not make everyone happy as the item selection is a bit smaller, and they do not have a massive amount of seafood. The meals are simple and straightforward but it will be a good meal.",

I came in on a Saturday morning for lunch and the line was moving smoothly the wait time was under 25 mins. For almost spending $20 it was a big disappointment on their selections of foods. The only thing that was standing out was their fried rice.   3/5 average & ok  Fried rice Hot links Turkey Service  Pizzas  Ice tea Their pop mix contemporary music   1/5 super meh   Sushi was like gas station quality  Egg drop soup tasted more like sesames oil soup super meh Spending almost $20 for lunch  Their selections for each station was a big disappointment   This would be my first and last time dining at the AYCE Palms Buffet and also the Buffet at the SunCoast was no different but here you can taste some quality but the selections of foods was a big let down. So far cheap buffets at the Orleans is good enough for this mid high roller. Also their team of  valet is a complete joke it took them so long that I might need a pillow to fall asleep. No wonder I visited other casinos not here at the Palms.",

Hard to pick that up as price is posted for 5 seconds only on outside boards. So I ended up paying $5 more than I was expecting per person.  That said, very good buffet for the price.   Very good meats, some salmon, good veggies.  Deserts good, salads okay.  Worth returning to, as seems the norm for Vegas buffet",

It doesn't have as big of a selection as some other places, but there's still plenty of choices and enough variety to suit most palates.  Overall, the quality of the food was great.  I thought the brisket was a bit dry and there were a few other things that I didn't care for, but I found things that I really enjoyed and filled up a lot.  The dessert bar was a bit lackluster, but again, there were so many other things that were great.  For its price, I don't think you can beat it.  It may not be the fanciest buffet in Vegas, but it's still a great restaurant and has a very appealing atmosphere.  We came as a group of 7 on a Sunday night during St. Patrick's Day so we waited about 30 minutes to get a table, so it definitely does get busy, but it wasn't terrible.  Our server was very friendly and came around often to refill our water glasses.  Overall, I think it's the best buffet for its value in Vegas!",

This way you pay for lunch and at 4pm they switch to dinner. Beware though, there will be a bit of a line. We also found the best server in town here. Her name is Nazi. She's a sweetheart. Very courteous and on our second trip there, she remembered everything the way we liked it, even though it had been a while. Now we always ask for her.  Also, if you need anything special like I do, just ask to speak to the Sous Chef, Michael. He is very accommodating. Also, accolades to Facia, the Front of the House Manager. She is amazing as well. Extremely pleasant to deal with. We now make visiting A.Y.C.E. a weekly ritual. See you there!!",

They have a lasagna that is pretty delicious. Today I went and they had fried calamari which they usually don't have and that was pretty good. The spicy deep fried wings are my all time favorite. They also have a vegan option which is great for a lot of people who live meat free. Their zucchini noodles in tomato sauce is great and they also have grilled tofu with mushrooms. The dessert station lacks a bit but I'm pretty picky when it comes to desserts. I'm a repeat visitor and enjoy AYCE every time I'm there and the staff is very friendly which is a plus.   Updating my review to a five star because of their breakfast buffet. Went to the breakfast buffet the other morning and it was freaking delicious!!! Churro waffle, egg white frittata, pancakes, bacon I mean the choices were endless! Then they had a tapioca pudding which was my favorite. I seriously can not wait to go back.",

I highly recommend trying the hot Cheeto Mac and Cheese, tastes like the sauce is even Tabasco spicy without the sprinkled hot Cheeto crumbs, they also have hot Cheeto corn! The sliders are bomb too w crispy French onion, they have an excellent dessert variety of ice cream pastries I tried the caramel ice cream, rich but not overly sweet. Gravy and turkey mashed potatoes are flavorful, they have the plates already portioned into a neater presentation than the self serve buffets that can get gross looking. I have yet to try everything, but I hear the time between lunch and dinner is best for both menu options. Will be back, with the remodeling and rebrand I'm loving the palms, now if only the bunnie servers would return..",

My family and I were looking for something cheaper than Bacchanal Buffet but still had good food, and so I stumbled upon A.Y.C.E while browsing through Yelp. I'm glad I found it! For the most part, the food was good. The selection is pretty good and a couple of dishes gave off a gourmet vibe. However, there were a few dishes that didn't quite hit the mark in my opinion. The Hot Cheetos-covered elote (wow!) was something I was really excited to try, but the corn was chewy rather than sweet and fresh and the Cheetos dust seemed a tiny bit soggy instead of crunchy and light. They also have an original flavored one and nacho cheese-covered option. The chicken parmesan as well as the French onion burger that I tried were also a bit dry. Other than a couple of dishes, everything else was pretty tasty! They even had mini portions of \"poke on rice\" which was surprisingly good.  If you're looking to save some money and still get a pretty good selection of buffet-style food, A.Y.C.E. is worth trying.",

I got a nice piece of turkey and put a big spoonful of cranberry on top. Get to my table and take a bite and yuck!!! It wasn't cranberry, it was grape jelly! They changed it out but that killed my appetite. I still attempted to have a piece of pizza, how bad can cheese pizza be right? Gross! Even their deserts were disgusting.",

    "text": "We came here on a Monday night, which also happens to be Christmas Eve. At 6:45pm the line was about 40-50 people deep, and it took about 45 minutes to get seated. The food is mostly American with a carving station, salad bar (not too big, no real variety, even less fruit options), Mexican (make your own tacos, cerviche, etc.) and Asian (California rolls, BBQ pork, sauteed snow peas, egg drop soup, etc.). There also a small dessert bar with bite sized cakes and gelato.  The good: the New England clam bake was pretty flavorful, especially the soup which was a bit spicy but full of flavor. The brisket from the carving station was good, although my wife got two other pieces that were not. The gelato was good, although my pistachio was just a bit too sweet.  The bad: Pretty much all the food besides what I pointed out above was bland, nothing provided a really tasty bite.   The decor was nice and modern and provided a nice atmosphere to enjoy dining. The service from our server was exceptional, which is why it's three stars instead of two. I was pretty hungry and came with not high expectations, but was still disappointed in the meal.",

    "text": "Located inside the casino between the two tall Palms hotel towers is a buffet that more people should pay a visit to.  On the other hand, maybe not as I'd hate to stand in line for a long time to get a seat!  Don't let the older venue and low buffet price deter you from coming here.    Craving a good buffet but unwilling to stand in line for hours at one of the popular buffets on the Strip, I thought I'd give this one shot since it was not too far away. It was a good decision.  While the cost of the buffet is about one-half (sometimes even more) of the typical popular buffet prices found, what they lacked in quantity A.Y.C.E. made up in quality.  This is not to say that they didn't have a lot of food.  They still have a very good selection of food to choose from.  Like many buffets, the food is arranged by themes such as meats, Asian, Mexican, salads, etc. What they didn't have compared to the pricier venues were the typical crab legs and big shrimp.  No loss as what they did have and the low cost more than made up for it.    I'd rate the quality of the food items from 3 to 4 stars, service 4 stars, and value 5.",

I did not see any of the individual juice bottles that have been posted here. Plus I thought there were going to be a bigger selection. The buffet was smaller than I thought and the food wasn't too fresh and it took awhile for items to be replenished.  As a local, I would much rather go to the M Buffet instead. A weekday dinner is actually around the same price as this buffet.  Hopefully they will revamp and add more selections as time goes on.

    "text": "Came here for dinner with my dad one day as we had received a BOGO coupon offer in the mail. Since Palm's was recently acquired by Station Casinos, their players card is now the \"Boarding Pass\" system. (great ! cuz i never had palm's lol). At $23.80 w/ coupon for 2 people, eh why not try it out, right?   The A.Y.C.E. buffet is a newly renovated buffet that Palm's had done in the recent few months. My friend had came here for Brunch soon after our vacay in December and said the food was really good. Since then, been mildly wanting to try this place.   Like most buffets, there are separate sections.   Sweet & Light (Dessert) - pistachio and cappuccino gelato. both were nice. cappuccino had a decent amount of coffee flavor. there was this cafe latte pudding thing there too. Surprisingly, flavor-wise, it was like a cafe latte, without sugar (like how i'd order from a coffee shop). strong coffee flavor. borderline bitter for a dessert. LOL maybe they forgot the sugar. xD   Smoke & Fire (BBQ) - Tried pork ribs and brisket. Pork ribs were super dry and hard to eat. Brisket was nicely flavored with a good bite, and a nice amount of smokiness. Not overly fatty but at this point, was full already. Lol i saw they had turkey legs but looked really dry.   The Hearth (Italian) - Pizzas... made to order pasta station...? Pizzas/calzones/etc looked horrible so i didn't touch any of this. And the made-to-order pasta station was unmanned for half the meal. When there was someone, they were behind on orders.   Somewhere in between here had a small \"bucket\" that has a crawfish overhanging the side with clams, mussels, shrimp in a light broth. Everything in this was overcooked. Full of broken shells and empty shells. I didn't find a single piece of clam despite having like 4 empty clams Lol... Shrimp was small, similar to the one offered in shrimp cocktail  The Roastery (Carving Station) - Surprisingly, the roast beef/prime rib was really well cooked and tender. They have a roasted cauliflower here too. Totally forgot to get it after being surprised at the thick cut of prime rib the carver gave me. Lol Add some sour cream w/ some horseradish, and some au jus to the prime rib and you're golden. The have elote (mexican street corn on a cob) in 3 different ways. Hot cheeto? dorito?, normal, and something else. Small portions poked with a skewer. The corn surprisingly is cooked well and not super soft, like most buffets.   World Pan (Asian) - Of all things, surprisingly the honey walnut shrimp was good. Lol. The shrimp was nicely cooked and had a nice firm bite. Sauce was nice and creamy.   I think there was one more section but i forgot to look at it Lol   Oh the soup and salad station in the middle, right in front of the entrance had a few soups, fruits, and salad. As well as ceviche and shrimp cocktail, peeled and in individual serving containers.   During or rather near end of my meal, i had realized what this buffet had reminded me of. Red Rock Casinos buffet. Then again, it is now the same company so not that surprising. Also, with a mild hint of Cosmopolitan with their individual plating, cute but mildly annoying at the same time Lol.. They had a lot of \"mislabeled\" stuff. I dont remember exactly example of things but it wasn't what was labeled.   For the price i paid, and a full meal, without any \"after meal complications\", it wasn't bad. But even at the price i paid, i'm not that sure if i'd return again. Not much seafood options. With the options they had, really small and overcooked. \"Best\" thing they had was probably the roast beef/prime rib. I mean, then again, $12/person w/ bogo offer for prime rib dinner, i guess that works..   where was the raclette station some reviews had mentioned? gelato ice cream sandwich? whaaaa ?   Service was pretty good. Our waitress had our drinks really fast, and new ones even before the previous ones were empty. Plates were cleared before you returned to your table.",

We went to the Bacchanal at Caesars and the Wynn buffet before coming here; if you have tried that caliber of buffet, do NOT come here.

    "text": "Now in its third month of operation and still doing good volume, opening during the holidays a smart move that allowed early kinks to be resolved before convention season, Friday night found A.Y.C.E. Buffet at The Palms particularly busy with a broad mix of patrons including Body Builders, Locals and tourists in town to watch the Final Four.  Currently celebrating Passover with a variety of traditional Jewish dishes in addition to the 'usual' items described as a \"celebration of All-You-Can-Eat,\" seven stations spread over a sizable footprint divided by cooking method and concept, it was just prior to 6:00pm that three guests arrived before the rush and found quick seating at a banquet near \"World Pan,\" everyone taking a moment to peruse the choices and plate number one comprised of Walnut Prawns every bit as good as what one will find on Spring Mountain Road plus spicy Noodles and respectable General Tso's Chicken.  Again impressed by such a radical departure from Station Casinos' Feast brand of Buffet, everything from the decor to individual servings rivaling the standard set by Caesars' Bacchanal or Cosmo's Wicked Spoon, it was working with small portions that plates two and three took a look at several of the  Passover options plus a Dinner Roll and surprisingly light French Macarons, the Chopped Liver rich and creamy while Matzo Brei, Soup and Stuffing were all pleasant, though limited personal experience prevents comment as to whether others would think they were great.  Executed under the direction of Chef Joseph Kudrak, his time with Station Casinos at Red Rock earning him a role overseeing Palms Casino Resort as a whole, it was with plate four that the first misfire of the evening arrived in the form of watery Lasagna with overly sweet Sauce, the Stromboli and smoked Ratatouille a far better example of A.Y.C.E.'s Italian offerings while the French Onion Soup topped in gooey Cheese is also worth a taste.  Taking a look at the Roastery plus Smoke & Fire next, sliced-to-order Roast Beef faring better than chewy smoked Brisket while Ribs, Turkey and Morrocan Lamb Stew were all better than one might ever expect at a Buffet, those avoiding Meat will be happy to know that Herb Roasted Cauliflower, Mushroom Quesadillas and Cornbread are all very good while the layered pan of Jack Fruit Enchiladas may just be the best savory item on the whole Buffet.   Priced at just $21.99 for Dinner, Station's Boarding Pass saving each guest $4, Dessert offers a whole island of items that shifts from morning to evening, the aforementioned Macarons as good as what is offered at the end of a meal at Le Cirque while miniature Carrot Cake, Cheesecake Parfaits, Lemon Meringue Tarts and Vegan Coconut Cookies all stand out amongst a collection that even goes so far as to account for dietary restrictions such as Sugar or Gluten Free.  Wrapping up with made-to-order Cookie Sandwiches plus three large-format Desserts, the Apple Cobbler and Fudge Brownie both nice landing pads for Soft Serve plus a variety of toppings, it warrants repeating that no visit to A.Y.C.E. should end without a heaping scoop of Cinnamon Roll Bread Pudding plus or minus Ice Cream, Gelato or Caramel because save for *perhaps* what is offered at The Kitchen at Atomic there is none better in Sin City...and theirs is $8 a slice.  ****1/2:  Sure some will point out the lack of (thin, frozen) Crab Legs or U20+ Shrimp, but at less than 1/2 the price and 1/4 the wait for Bacchanal or Wynn it speaks volumes of Chef Kudrak and his team that only two of fifty items tasted from A.Y.C.E.'s Dinner Buffet were disappointing while several were good enough that they could be menu items elsewhere - including Restaurants charging double on The Strip.",

    "text": "I researched on Yelp quite a bit before settling on this buffet.  I had heard it fashioned itself after Wicked Spoon in a lot of its presentation style but didn't kick you in the guts in terms of price.  As long as you register for a players card through the hotel, there is a nominal discount, but even without, the prices are decent at all times of the day.   For us, there was no line for dinner, and the cashier, hostesses, and server were all pleasant. We were sat in a central area which wasn't too loud or crowded and kept us close enough that the food wasn't a hike away from the table. So far so good.   The food was just good. It was definitely nothing to write home to grandma about. There were some highlights for me though. The wedge salad was a nice fresh starter. My only complaint was the light amount of dressing.  The fingerling potatoes were delicious. They had a hearty amount of vegetarian dishes which I thought was great.  I really enjoyed the Asian fare, as did my husband. We brought my stepson, who is 14 here and he thoroughly enjoyed it. I'm pretty sure he cleaned at least four plates full of food and he is a finicky eater.  All in all, for us, as a family of four that didn't want to break the bank but wanted to try a nice buffet, we were absolutely satisfied. I would come again.",

We came in at 10:30am for breakfast and was told that here were no more breakfast item and were to be charged lunch prices.  I was okay with that because I really wanted to check out the buffet.  Also, the price was very reasonable.  Our Host Tyreshia and Server Jonathon were outstanding.  The atmosphere was nice.  But the food was not fresh and appealing.  A lot of the items needed to be refilled or stirred.  Lots of spills on the counters, maybe from breakfast crowd. The omelette/pasta station was still open.  When it was my turn to order, the cook said no more omelettes, just fried eggs.  He said the same thing to the lady behind me.  The only thing different about the buffet was the kicked up a notch corn on the cob.  Mexican station was missing salsa or pico for my beef taco.  The tortillas were in two small steel bowls with cover.  But they were dry and hard.  Regardless, taco meat was good.  The desserts were not memorable.  The best things in the buffet were the little bread sticks and chicken pot pie.   The bread sticks were baked perfect.  It was still hot and were delicious!",

They were friendly, but not over the top. Once seated, my server immediately asked for my beverage order & continued to check in on me throughout my dining experience. The excellent Customer Service did not go unnoticed. The buffet area is HUGE. There was definitely a lunch crowd, but I was able to walk up to each station, without wait, and the food was always fresh and readily available. Being born and raised in the South, I consider myself a seafood snob, but the sushi station offered fresh tuna and salmon. I'll admit, I did get seconds. And I really like the creative spin on presentation. Single serve items like the mac&cheese & chicken pot pie were easy to grab and still left room on my plate to add more items. The dining area was clean, and I didn't really feel like I was seated in a buffet. I'll be returning to A.Y.C.E. sooner than later, for sure!",

Mary Girard the manager was very helpful in accommodating our needs as a group when a few of our friends showed up late. Mary made sure our friends didn't have to wait in the long line and got them right in so thank you very much. The food was great between the variety and how tasty the Salt and Pepper wings were, the Chili verde was amazing and the biscuits and gravy were delicious.  To top it off our server Ele was great our Mimosas were never empty he was very attentive, friendly and made us feel at home. To find out Ele was a veteran to the palms I was not surprised because he was very good at his job.  Thank you",

    "text": "Well darn, Sunday Brunch on 4/27 was disappointing. Our server wasn't very attentive to our table of 3, and whenever we were able to get her attention for water refills she somehow complied to our requests without a word or looking at us. A simple \"yes\" or any comment would've been the very least. We tried to back off as much as possible to give her a chance to redeem herself, but ultimately that kind of service ended up souring our experience.  As for the food, way different than the last time I came here about a year ago when it was new and trying to prove itself (partly the reason why I came back). Now it truly tastes like a cheap $20 buffet worth. Carving meats were dry (resulting in tough texture) and oversalted, particularly the prime rib. No pressed juices, just overbaked and \"meh\" veggie/vegan dishes on the Rejuvinate counter. The battered shrimp in the honey shrimp walnuts were soggy. I'm sure the buffalo mac and cheese with hot Cheetoh topping must be appealing for some people, but there are countless other dishes to offer for brunch instead of that. Eggs were dry/stale and bacon was way too thin to have that crispy savory taste. Seafood boil was just okay. Mixed greens and some of the other veggie toppings at the salad bar were never restocked while my party was there. The best dish I ate was the smoked salmon, with a small bagel and whatever cream cheese was left for me to scrape off of the bowl.  My friend who was with me is lactose intolerant, and there was no alternative non-dairy milks for her coffee and no non-dairy ice cream/gelato options.   2-stars because if you're staying at the Palms and just want to eat at a buffet on the cheap, then here you go.  But I'm not coming back here again for a meal. For $20+, there are more than enough food options to go to in Vegas, especially off the strip.",

If you have a player card, you will save $2 on top of the original price so it is a good idea to get one before heading down to the restaurant. The lunch price is around 15.99 and 17.99 for dinner. The restaurant is beautiful and has a variety of food from asian to American. Keep in mind the size of the restaurant is nothing compared to Wicked spoon or Wynn buffet. However, the price is unbeatable. It has a good variety of foods and desserts: asian fried rice, dumpling, roasted chicken, pizzas, ice cream , cookies and so on but unfortunately when I was there, there was no macaron. The foods are great but some of them were cold and little bit salty. Overall, I think it is worth the money specially u can't beat that price on the strip.",

I tried a little bit of almost everything they had and the meat was overcooked and tough as was the case with a lot of their other dishes. I was excited to see they had shrimp, but they tasted freshly defrosted....they had a wet, soggy half frozen taste to them which was not pleasant at all.

They might need better warming lights. The dinner food that came out was good. Average may be a better term but for $15 who's complaining.  The salt & pepper chicken wings were everyone's favorite.  I was excited to try the different corns but they were very cold and not very good.  The carving station had brisket and the two pieces I got were all fat..so I don't know how that was. The dessert bar was good. A little disappointed they didn't have the French Macarons like pictures on their website.. maybe I should lower my rating to 3 for that reason only.

The sel mei was better than most that I have ever tasted (since I am Asian). The Carolina BBQ sauce had a delicious kick. The sausage was very tasty.

The minor negatives: much smaller then other buffets in Vegas so you won't get the variety you may see elsewhere.

    "text": "This is our new favorite among the many buffets in Las Vegas. Absolutely everything we tried was good to outstanding (except for overdone roast beef which my son found to be dry and tasteless even with au jus; I didn't try it because I like medium rare to rare). There were lots of items not found on other buffets.  The pizza was really good. I consider that nothing short of miraculous. The French onion soup was good; not much broth, but the cheese was plentiful and the croute, onions, and broth combined to taste like the best, moistest stuffing ever. The smoked brisket was tender, juicy, and delicious. The hot link was really good. (How can you screw up sausage, you may ask? But I've gotten carving-table sausage that wasn't worth eating.) The hummus and baba ganoush were terrific. The olive medley, pesto mozzarella balls, and Caprese salad were great. The grilled vegetables were fresh and good. The salt-and-pepper chicken wings (highly recommended by other reviewers) were delicious. The sushi was fresh and tasty. My sister told us there had been complaints about dry sushi rice in the past, but no problem this time; so the buffet seems to be responding to criticisms. The spring rolls were very tasty and not skimpy (very unusual even for a good buffet). The smoked pork chops with apple were delectable. The Mexican-style \"elote off the cob\" was great. The Korean short ribs were terrific; every other buffet has disappointed me with this dish. The individual shepherd's pie was yummy. My son is not a fish-eater but he took two types and liked them both. I tried his mahi mahi and had to agree it was lovely.   And the desserts. I was sad there were no macarons, and the creme brulee did not have enough crisp sugar topping and was just okay. But the cinnamon roll bread pudding with caramel sauce and the hot fudge brownie (warm, soft, gooey) more than made up for it. There were many equally delicious choices. Ooooh, and gelato. :-)  Everything was shiny clean and nicely presented. The waitress was efficient and pleasant. The price with coupon and member cards was a great deal.  Okay. As I said, new top choice, replacing the Aria buffet which we still love.",

Wide selection, from crawfish to sushi to crab boil to great brisket and on and on. Everything we tried was well prepared and plentiful, not always the case with buffets. The crowning touch was our server, Nazie. Though obviously very busy, she constantly checked in with us, making us feel she was there just for us. We noticed not just with us but all around her station, she constantly maintained such a positive welcoming vibe. When we were ready to leave she invited us back... if we return to Vegas we're going to take her up on it!",

As we waited in line a hotel rep suggested we sign up for a player's card for a deeper discount... it ended up being $13.99 person!! Our favorites were the Asian food: sushi, dimsum, noodles and the salads and desserts. They also had a taco bar,  grilled meat station and pasta bar. Vegetarians had some good options as well.. but the bottomless mimosas for $10 were my fave!! And our server Maria...well she never let my glass go empty!! She was the bomb!! Thanks AYCE and the Palms for a great experience at an incredible price!!",

Believe it or not the Fiesta has great restaurants and customer service. Try it once and see what you think. I recommend Fuego Steak house and Leticia's Mexican restaurant.

    "text": "4 stars for the food. 5 stars for the value. I like rounding up.   For the price and quality of food, it's good! I don't feel like it should be compared to the big buffets on the strip like Bacchanal, Wicked Spoon, or Wynn Buffet. They're charging 3x as much, so of course they're gonna have much better food and much higher variety. Crab legs don't grow on trees.    With that said, it's my go to buffet for when I wanna stuff my face and not spend an arm and a leg. Pro tip: sign up for the players club to get a discount.   At buffets, I like to go for the high value items like the prime rib, seafood, etc. However, at this particular buffet, I find myself heading straight for the salt and pepper wings. They're so damn good! I didn't wanna fill my tummy on chicken wings only but it's honestly the best item there. Try it! Lol and surprisingly, their XLBs (xiao long bao) are pretty damn good. I am even comparing it to ding tai fung , Mama lus, etc from the 626 area. I keep looking out for their XLBs but they've only had it available once at A.Y.C.E.   Another thing I like at this buffet is their hot cheetos elote. Again, nothing TOOO spectacular because you can get it at outside restaurants but I just like that it's an option and it's tasty. Save room for their gelato. Their stracciatella (sp??) is my favorite.  The lines here are getting longer and longer as people are discovering this buffet secret. I would recommend getting more cashiers or moving faster because every time the line has been long, the insides have been empty. Gotta keep it more staffed. Otherwise, love this place and I will be back soon, Palms!",

I find The Palms Casino depressing. I'm not sure what it is...so, I would never be hanging out in The Palms and then decide to go to the buffet. I would have to make a special trip over to go to the buffet...so, probably not going to happen.",

After a long drive the team and I decided on the A.Y.C.E buffet, affordable, good quality food. Think COSTCO but the buffet version. Starving and excited to eat. The team and I decided to take a photo, unaware of the attention it created. Noticing from afar, assistant manager Mary Gilrard (Buffet Angel ) caught up to us at our table & showed us how to ATTACK the buffet. Without hesitation I was off to the races! Soup & salad(arugula salad & chicken soup) first to create a base layer... woofed it down! again grabbing a small plate , sushi ,ginger & wasabi (real wasabi!) with a personally made salad . sMASHED!  Restroom break.. back to the party. While I planned my next attack, Mary graciously showed me around the buffet and introduced me to Chef Mike!Who after listening to my desire to indulge on fresh fish, he personally cooked me a dish! Can't say enough about these beautiful people... thank you!  Armed with the advice from  Mary & the excitement from meeting chef mike I went back to the buffet to Kill off all of the fish dishes before my main course arrived. Restroom break... hehe .. coming back to my table Chef Mike placed the freshly cooked fish in front me. As the team & I tried the fish Chef Mike gave us advice for on cooking techniques, it was dope! After  our brief conversation it was time for Dessert!! And let me tell you!!! It's was fan f#%ING-Tastic!!   Just look  at the pictures!!!!!!",

Certain dishes like the Poke were even better than at the Aria Buffet on the Strip. Amazing!  Lots of variety of meat selections at the carving station were on point. Much better than the carving stations at the Aria.  2 Stars for the waitress. Not personable or friendly. She only came back at the end to ask if we needed anything else. She cleaned up the plates when she got around to them. Never asked me if I wanted a Refill on my soda. Not one time.  Seriously. I don't have time to be angry at a waitress that's just not all there.    My wife was very peeved about this, but we were too busy eating and making sure our baby was tended to.  Overall, will come back in the future despite the crappy waitresses that work at this buffet.",

    "text": "After having a bad experience at a similar buffet, after reading all the reviews, I decided to give the AYCE buffet a go. It surely beats the prices at the other buffets by half, with a decent quality in the food they offer.  If you sign up for the players card at the Palms, the buffet is only $19.99. Went around 8 PM on a Friday and the wait was about 5 minutes. They had a nice variety of stations from salad (who really goes there?), Asian, pizza and pasta, meat carving station, Mexican and a nice dessert section (cake, pastries and ice cream galore).  Majority of the food was really good, some such as the shumais (small dumpling), ribs, and pasta with marinara sauce were lacking a little flavor and weren't done right. Other than that you definitely get your money's worth, as no one really eats enough at the Wicked Spoon or Bacchanal buffet to get your full money's worth.  Left satisfied and would definitely be back again if I'm in the mood for a buffet.",

The offer different stations here will a variety of different dishes. Rather than serving yourself, each item is the prepared and plated in different types of little plates and pans.  Everything here was freshly made. I found that the selection was small. Everything though was fresh.  If you are looking for a traditional style buffet, I would hesitate to recommend this buffet simply because of the style of buffet.  The staff thought is really friendly and very attentive to your requests. The pricing for the lunch was really a good value at under 20.00.  I did like the atmosphere and the Palms remodel is excellent .",

I went on a Friday night and the place was not only much smaller then expected for a \"Vegas strip\" buffet but the food choices were not comparable to other four star buffets on the strip. Also the photos posted on various social media do not appear to match what was actually served.   For those who love seafood, like crab, they do not have anything other then shrimp. None the less, the server was fantastic and very kind. Other customer service personnel appeared to be pleasant.   I would recommend the buffet at Binions, Mainstreet Station. Similar price, more selection, same quality food, and they have crab legs on Fridays or weekends I believe.   For the seafood enthusiast and lovers go the the Studio B buffet at The M on weekends. Currently four stars and not comparable to anything else I've experienced yet.",

The food, not so much! I found the food to be oversalted, under or overcooked, way to spicy or just bland. In the kitchen, they pay a lot of attention to quantity, but not so much for quality. I am a vegetarian, and they had a few ok choices, but I wonder how the head chef or sous chef can let the food go out without tasting or checking it. It ran me almost $17 for lunch. Bottom line, I can do much better at home. My kitchen and my food beats it hands down.",

This was the absolute WORST buffet I've ever had, everything I picked was COLD and so I kept going back trying something else and still Cold that is until I finally got an omelette   My food rating - 1... The pancake was as hard as a hockey puck, the scrambled eggs, potato's, hash brown, bacon, ham, all cold and just not good. The bacon & ham SALTY.  The coffee was hot, yay and our server great but other than that, I immediately regretted coming there wasting my $$$, I should've gone to McDonalds around the corner!  Sorry I could not give a better review, have to be honest.",

    "text": "I am an ESL Teacher at a school here in town and wanted to take my class of 25 students to the buffet for lunch. I called earlier in the week and spoke to Facia, the Assistant Room Manager, who informed my that they are unable to take reservations, but would do everything in their abilities to accommodate our large party.  Our group arrived shortly after 12pm on a Thursday and the line was minimal. Facia and her team did an excellent job of processing payments and seating our party in groups to expedite the process. We were all able to sit together at 3 large tables right in front of the dessert station.  Honestly, I'm not normally a fan of buffet food, but was impressed with the quality and selection of the food offered. My 3 favorite items (which were recommended by Facia) were the lemon pepper chicken wings as well as the pizza and stromboli, cooked in their hearth oven.  Our 2 waitresses, Wendy and Embet, did an excellent job keeping our drinks filled and clearing our plates. They were both very patient with my students, as they are from 9 different countries and have various English language skills.  Overall, I would definitely recommend A.Y.C.E. and will be returning again soon!",

The meats including beef, pork and turkey all tasted super dry and rubbery. Everything from the dessert station look like was bought from store. One of the only few thing I enjoyed was the make your own omelet during brunch time. Line was long and it moved slow despite having so many empty tables. Our server also pretty much disappeared after getting our first drinks.",

I thought maybe we went a little later in the evening but even then, it was about 7:30 pm on a Saturday. We were a large group. Options were \"out\" or no longer being served. Sections where employees were serving, lacked a lot of personality on their end. The dessert people were honestly, rude. It seemed like you were annoying them by asking them for something. I did like the elotes! The place is nice looking because it's new & renovated. I probably won't be back.",

    "text": "Went with friends, with the mindset of \"need to get there ASAP before quality goes down like Wicked Spoon.\"  Don't know if it was the mindset, but the service was not the best so that could have overshadowed everything.  Don't get me wrong, the buffet looks great. Design of the space looks amazing. Very open. Nice and bright.  From the moment we stood in line, the expectations were already lowering. The woman in charge of the line took us out of the line we were at and moved us to the next register, where if she kept us, our group of 7 would've gotten in sooner. Instead, the group after us in the original line got through first.  When our group of 7 was sat, we immediately went straight for the food.  Pros: corn bread (stayed moist), walnut shrimp (retained some crunch and not overly sweet), individual wedge salad (lettuce was not oxidized and fresh no brown or wilted), cooked to order pasta, smoked brisket (flavorful and tender), carved turkey breast (moist), prime rib, coque au vin, mini macarons (ordered out), lemon tart (nice tart flavor)  Cons: turkey legs (dry), shrimp cocktail (shrimp texture was off and cocktail sauce was not like other station property- had no bite or body, loose), collard greens (no ham/ham hock), individualized clam bake (overcooked crawfish and other shellfish), pan seared salmon (overcooked), catfish (soaked up the liquid it was sitting in to prevent it from drying out),  tuna poke bowl (tuna didn't look fresh and very oxidized, no red \"fresh\" color,\" every other individualized desserts (lack luster, didn't know I could ever eat a \"watered\" down espresso flavor, but I did while my friend ate the same thing and his had way stronger espresso flavor)  Service: server kept forgetting our drink order refills. As part of the Station Culture: \"It's Everyone's Job,\" the busser was not very helpful. Our table asked him for help with refills and the response was typical \"union\" response: \"I'll let your server know.\" I'm sorry,  dinner rush was finished,  plenty of tables were still clean and open and the time we asked he only had 2 4-tops to bus, so we didn't understand the brush off. ...  All in all, probably won't go back for dinner. But if you must try, at least get the Boarding Pass to get the discount. I normally go crazy at buffets, doing 4+ rounds, but this time I didn't go past 2.",

    "text": "Updated to a well deserved 5 stars! My new favorite buffet and likely will be voted #1 best value in 2018. I'll take side bets.   I've now enjoyed breakfast, lunch, and dinner and think all are simply amazing. They overlap so no waiting for changeover, get both breakfast and lunch items if you come around 10am for example.   Great price but get your players card first to get the discounted (advertised price) you might expect.   So Much Value! Food quality is spectacular.  Unique and fun experience. A lot of premade dishes so you can try several different things.  Quick prompt service.  Cheap price but 5 star food.  Service is fantastic! The cashiers are nice. They have 2-3 people to seat you and always friendly with smiles, even had few of them ask if everything was good while seated. They say goodbye and thanks for coming. Servers are the best, come around very often with refills and work together if on breaks or busy.  Managers listened to my complaints, signs are changed and things are labeled correctly (for the most part). The salad condiments serving spoons are better but still hard to serve, they'll likely improve it though. The fruit is kept full, haven't seen it like I did the first day I went. I said before the fruit needed a bigger tray but that's not True, I just wanted it to be fresher cut and kept full, and they stay on top of it now.   Every food dish is made with care. Lots of flavor and unique items you won't find at other buffets. Some complained Stations didn't copy their other buffets but that's silly, they took a chance and now stand out from all buffets.   It is my new go to spot. It'll be hard for me to justify spending $10 or even $20 more for less quality food elsewhere. Other places have longer waits and colder food and worse service.  Love the chairs and tables. Chairs are flexible in the back, well padded, and have a handle to easily grab. Solid wood table tops that are always clean and sturdy.   They don't have a year long VIP pass yet but I'll be first to get one if they do.   Hurry up and go before I eat everything! :-)",

It offers quite a variety of food selections: Mexican (quesadillas, fajitas, etc.), Asian (Korean BBQ ribs, salt and pepper wings, stir fried noodles station for order, sushi rolls, etc.), Italian (a variety of pizzas, pasta for order, etc.), BBQ station (beef brisket, pork ribs, sweet potatoes, etc.), carving station (roasted beef, etc.), soup, salad and fruit station, dessert station (soft served ice cream, ice cream sandwiches, mini desserts such as creme brulee, carrot cake, coffee mousse, etc.)  Overall, the food was very tasty with very good selection.  Some of the food are offered in smaller portions in cute containers like some buffets on the strip so it's easier to taste everything.  Our favourites were the salt and pepper wings, sesame balls, and shepherd's pie.  Kids' favourites were pizza, creamy corn, and mashed potatoes.  For the price, we think the quality and taste of food were above average.  Definitely worth a try if you are in the area.",

Located in the Palms Casino, A.Y.C.E. seems to be a great deal at $8.99 for the Breakfast Buffet, but...the fine print alludes to this price with a Gold Players Card or higher.  Regular price is $12.99. If you have the basic card gets you in at $10.99 plus tax and tip.  On a positive note, the Parking is free; the environment is cheerful; and the service is pleasant!  It was better than other buffets because there was no line to get in, and it wasn't crowded!  There were so many different stations and choices, but I had to focus, knowing that my tummy space is limited.  I liked the fresh fruits, oatmeal, tapioca, and variety of breads the best!  The fresh Orange juice,  eggs Benedict, and quiche were also memorable!  Dear Daniel and I happily scouted out the terrain, took photos, and finally settled down to our feast!  We were happily full and enjoyed our food coma!  It was a fun and repeatable foodie adventure!",

The place looks clean, and the service was really good. But of course the main thing was the food, I'm gonna be honest here, this is the best buffet I've ever tried.  The food was well done and good quality, the steak, pulled pork and elotes were amazing, not even joking. Believe me, if you're in Las Vegas, and want to eat 'till you can't move at some buffet, go here. You won't regret it.",

That I saw, the problem was there were not enough bussers. There were lots of empty tables but I only saw one or two bussers clearing off tables. As for the food , it was really tasty and creative. I understand that maybe they are understaffed and going through the motions after the renovation but the wait is just too much. In my opinion the line for a buffet should not exceed 30 min.",

I had high hopes for this place that's why I decided to celebrate his birthday lunch here at AYCE buffet.  The line was quite long but very understandable for a good buffet.   We ended up waiting 1 1/2 hour to get in.  Unfortunately, my whole family was very disappointed.   There were 3 dishes that were better than mediocre (spam fried rice, pork green chili, and chile lime chicken) but the rest were either dry (roast beef, ham, mushroom pizza, mushroom quesadilla, pastries), too salty (mussel curry), or lacking flavor (fried/breaded catfish, hush puppies, honey shrimp). The desserts looked great but majority of them lacked flavor.    One saving grace for this experience was  the friendly service from the cashier to our server despite how busy they were.   If Palms will read my review, I hope that they will use customer's feedback to improve the quality and flavor of food served at AYCE buffet.",

What I love about this buffett and what makes it different are the pre-set portions, which you can always go back for more. This is such a huge advantage because it gives the cutest presentation and keeps everything fresh.  The assortment is very different than most lamb, civiche, premium shrimp cocktail, ribs and seafood boil soup. But the most impressive thing was the desert selection, all small petite offerings to allow you to try more flavors.   The whole buffett was very clean, very fresh and hand crafted. Way to step up the bar!!",

I like to think of this place as upscale food that tastes nothing like upscale food. A wolf in sheep clothing when it comes to buffets.  This buffet boasts dishes that are similar to buffets like Bacchanal and The Wicked Spoon but tastes nothing like it. There were so many items that I thought \"OOOHHHH\" but when I took a bite it was like \"Ewwwwww\". I mean seriously, if you are going to put out Duck Confit make it taste like Duck Confit and not a Duck Con! It was like a food fake out the whole time. For the price of the buffet compared to most Vegas buffets, I should not have expected greatness. It really is an A.Y.C.E. (All you can eat) of trendy dishes that are constantly overcooked, dry or very bleh.   There really is nothing more to say about this buffet. Really. Nothing.",

    "text": "Good buffet for the price. The food is more creative than the typical buffet which I can appreciate. Although, they aren't always successful with their cooking. The brisket was pretty dry. It crossed my mind that maybe it's intentional so you don't go back for seconds. If that's the case then it worked. I didn't get it again. But I liked several of their other dishes like the street corn and poke salad. They occasionally have honey walnut shrimp but they only had that one time that I went and I have eaten here 3 times.   If you're looking for a good meal at a good price, this is a good place to go. It's not like eating at Bellagio or Bacchanal, but it also doesn't cost the same either. Btw, I went to Wicked Spoon and that place was pretty awful. This place is half the price and has much better food.   UPDATE:  I went today for dinner and the food has gone downhill. Food quality has decreased. They seem to be using cheaper ingredients.  This place used to make more creative dishes like braised beef poutine, honey walnut shrimp, duck confit, salmon with cream sauce, but now it's more typical items such as pizza, chicken cacciatore, chicken wings, pasta, sliders, egg rolls.  Nothing memorable, and it didn't even taste very good. Many of the items were similar to the food served at hometown buffet. They still have some of their usual dishes like smoked brisket and ribs, but they were dry.  Fried chicken was salty. I just can't stand behind this buffet anymore. I won't go back unless they improve their foods. It was like this the last 3 times I've gone. Too bad cuz I really did like this place before.",

Some meats were good, others were not so good, way to dry. One station had Brussels Sprouts and they were litterly uncooked, just looked roasted from the outside, seamed to be held under fire to look like cooked, but totally raw inside. Who wants to eat that? The ones served at the Asian Station were cooked ok. The 2 dumpling kinda things at the Asian station had some weird tasting meat inside, couldn't eat it. Had some grilled octopus, Love that normally and it was ok. One side was fine, the other side of it was tasting dry and burned.  And the dessert station is a total fail besides the bread pudding and that sugar free tart. I'm Not sure what you can do wrong with desserts, even the worst buffets in this town have better desserts than AYCE. I'm sure if you take care of those issues, it would be a great place. But as of now I'm not really willing to go back and eat there again.  The server was awesome, he did a great job.",

Best part overall was the desert which is were I probably got most of my monies worth. Custom icecream cookie sandwiches was the best and only part I truly enjoyed.

I did not care for the buffet at this hotel before the renovation much but I am glad to see they have done some good upgrades to their food variety. I like that they have some small portion options so you can try a little here and there. I was super excited to see elotes and they were good. The roast beef was cooked just right and I also enjoyed the pork shu mai. The dessert section was by far my favorite! They had a wide range of desserts from gelato to macaroons. You can even get a Cookie ice cream sandwich made with gelato. The macaroons were delicious and I think I ate over a dozen of them by myself with no regret. The creme brulee was perfect as it was not so sweet. The price for this buffet is reasonable and worth checking out if you are looking for a buffet to eat at. Will definitely be back myself!",

However, they play the f*cking music so loud that it's almost impossible to have a conversation.  I complained to the assistant manager who told me she could do nothing about it.  When I did get the manager on the phone I was told the level of music was decided by higher up.  I called the food and beverage director who failed to bother to call back.  The same with the hotel manager.  What I was told was they want to cater to a younger crowd.  You know - people who have no money.  It's a shame but they have lost a customer until such time as they realize adult enjoy a meal without music blaring in the background.",

The Asian food wasn't all that authentic, (as expected). The dessert corner was just ok. Glad they had gelato otherwise the desserts would've really sucked. The wait to get in was ridiculously long (1.5 hours). Aside from having precious time with family union, needless to say, this place wasn't worth the wait. Not sure what the hype was about.",

We waited in line for a solid 30 minutes even though there was only about 7 or 8 groups in front of us. This was also 30 minutes before they were going to close. So we finally get to the counter pay and have to wait while the hostess is \"finding\" us a table. Once she walks us past the wall where the tables are literally half of them are empty/no one using them. So the dining room is half full at best and we're waiting a half hour lol??? There was easily enough tables for everyone in line to be seated all at once. I sorta can understand if they are trying to make it look busy but this was right before they were closing and they're making us wait for nothing! Im not sure who the manager was or if there even was one but anyone can immediately see the line/seating set up is horrible, get it together Palms.",

Usually there's pizza at a buffet with the basic flavors, but I saw Stromboli's and unique pizza toppings. The asian food section had mini poke servings and the best pepper wings I've ever had in my life. The servings are small and individual, which is appreciated because I like to try a lot of different dishes, and it stops you from going too HAM on one item and basically wasting half of whatever you instinctively got. The service is good, and they keep the mimosas coming. It was amazing and I came back with my family the next morning. For me, it's always ritual to have brunch at the Wynn before heading back home. That's changed, and will be visiting AYCE for brunch from now on.",

Lots of items to choose from - you definitely won't find Hometown Buffet food here. I liked the desserts and the Italian food the best. Serving some Asian fusion dishes too was a plus in my book. The seating was very comfortable, tastefully done and roomy. I didn't feel squished in or rushed by the servers. Chris was our main server and he was definitely on point with our mood. He rolled with our conversations and had some laughs with us. We appreciated his good nature and courteous attitude. It made our dinner even more pleasant. I hope that we sit in his area again when we return to Vegas. He is quite the host. Thank you Chris for being a wonderful server! Keep up the great work :-D  Lastly, Bring your casino rewards card so that you don't miss out on possible savings. Pricing is typical for a Vegas hotel buffet but this one is sure to please. You won't be disappointed.",

While I'm not vegan, I did try and like a few of their dishes.  It's not necessarily spectacular in their selections, but the price is very good. I'm sort of guessing it'll go up in time.  Many portions are served in their own container, not unlike Wicked Spoon (one of my fave buffets in Vegas), which is a nice touch.

The price is reasonable (about $23 with their player's club card) but there are no crab legs or much of any seafood choices.  Some of the station choices are smoked meat, pizza, Asian, carving, and vegetarian.  There aren't a ton of choices at each station but almost everything I ate was surprisingly good.  The Chinese Char siu was really good probably the best thing I had there.  The Salt and Pepper Wings were also delicious.  The pizza had crispy crust and good flavor.   There weren't many dessert choices (no donuts or cotton candy) but if you want/need sugar free there are quite a few choices.  I had some spumoni gelato.  It was a nice choice.    They weren't super busy which is good but some of the dishes were sitting for a long time and needed to be changed out.  The baked beans had a nice pudding like film on top.   Anyways, a good choice if you don't like a lot of seafood and don't want to pay $50 for your buffet.    Our server was great.  She was on top of getting refills and removing dirty plates.  That is not always the case at some other high priced buffets.  Give it a try!",

Food was great, but not much  seafood selections to choose from. The staff was courteous and very helpful. We fed three adults for less than $50 alunch for three can cost way more at other Buffets around Las Vegas. From a food quality to cost ratio, this is a good deal. We may go back for the Dinner Buffet someday.  Update July 25, 2019 It's been a year since first coming to A.Y.C.E. With family in town and wanting to go to a buffet, this was an opportunity to return to A.Y.C.E. for that dinner mentioned above in my original 4Star review. Tonight's visit was \"No Bueno\". It took well over an hour to wind through the line and get seated. I started with the short ribs, and the meat was cold. Not even the heat lamps it was sitting under could help it. I discarded that plate and tried to look for Italian...yeah not happening. They had pizza that tasted like cardboard. Not much variety. You get a pasta plate cooked to order though. Maybe my expectations was too high based on the great experience last time. I don't know, but I do know I didn't like the food. The soup and salad bar looked okay and the sweet deserts were really good. But Pistachio Ice Cream is suppose to be cold. Cooked red meat, ehhhh....Not so much. Get the Palm Players Card because it dropped the cost down from $24.99 to $19.99. Way cheaper than any buffet on the Strip. I'm dropping my review from a 4 to 3 Stars.",

The ham at the carving station was very good. And the omelette station. Those 2 things I feel are the saving grace.  The fruit selection was awful a serious let down.  I been  to a lot free hotel breakfasts that were better than this. Don't really have much more to say. Just a average 3 stars",

Even though they were about to close, they were literally still serving fresh food till the minute they were closing. The closing time is 9pm but they serve till 9:30. The steak here was literally to die for. The steak was better than most steak houses I've been to and that's not a joke. They have a vegetarian section filled with tofu options, they have a sushi bar, and they have a really good bbq and meat selection. The salad bar they have was gigantic. This buffet was very classy on the inside and it was a place where I could truly enjoy my dinner. I plan on coming here decently often and will be recommending it as my favorite buffet.",

    "text": "I have eaten at countless buffets in Las Vegas but this one was an unexpected and welcome surprise.  The line at 3:15PM on a Friday post July 4th deterred my family at first, but my father asked an attentive manager named Mary G. if there was any way at all to get the empty VIP line to help.  Elviva began assisting and from there on it was a smooth and quick 15 minutes to the register.    The buffet itself was very affordable and the fact that the staff was so responsive and reactive made a good experience into an exceptional visit.  Jacqueline, the hostess, is a genuine ray of sunshine, and Marilyn, our server, took care of all of needs promptly with a smile on her face.  It is rare to actually have buffet staff who wants to engage with their patrons beyond the usual pleasantries; Marilyn was super sweet and kept us entertained!    The food was damn solid too!  Standouts include their garlic mashed potatoes, salt and pepper wings, pork ribs, and delectable French onion soup.  Mary also recommended we come back for the homemade chicken pot pie.  Dessert did not disappoint either.  The berry cobbler tasted like the most amazing blueberry muffin you have ever had!  The strawberries dipped in white chocolate and the little cheesecake cup were the bee's knees.    Overall service was 5 stars and the buffet quality, taste and selection earns 4.25 stars.  I will be back with my family next week!",

The buffet is very crowded because of the 2 for 1 the Palms is offering and the lines are long but it is worth the wait.   I am handicapped and Mary got me a table close to the front which I thought was very nice of her.  The food was fabulous, new item honey chicken was delicious, and the apple pork chops as well.  Actually there wasn't anything I didn't like.  I wish they would add more dessert, otherwise I think this is one of the best buffets in town.  Magali the other manager went out of her way to get me my tea and cream because our server was taking care of a very large party that was just seated.  That is what makes this buffet great, the managers care and it reflects on the whole buffet, servers, food handlers etc.  They make you feel special and make sure you have a wonderful dining experience and the food is absolutely delicious..... to me one of the best in Vegas....",

I mentioned it was my nephews bday and she put together a special dessert plate with candles and brought out some staff to sing. Truly unexpected. It will be my go-to when I have guests in town.

I wish they would bring back that Moroccan Lamb !   I have been going to the Palms for over 10 years and have been to several of their Buffet changes . It has always been average or worse . They are trying with this new menu and decor . I do have to say the Moroccan Lamb was really good and so was the French Onion Soup . After that it kind of goes down hill . My son who loves fish and seafood said the Crawfish with the Clam cup was bad and the crawfish was black inside .   I love BBQ so I was looking forward to that . Well , not that big of a selection . The brisket was smokey and the bbq sauce on the side was okay and I even tried the Carolina sauce which was okay . I got 2 pork ribs and they were okay , but when I went back the 2nd time they were a little to pink so I didn't get again . Mashed potatoes with turkey gravy was good .   Generals chicken tasted bland and frozen dinner like and no fried rice only white . Pineapple at salad bar was fresh and made a small salad which was okay . They had small wedges and shrimp cocktails too . The desserts were ok and they have gelato . The staff have ugly white shirts and they didn't seem to happy at the entrance . I heard 2 hostesses having words . Our server was nice , but messed up our drink order the first time which she quickly corrected . Corn bread was good and moist not dry like most places .   All in all , thank goodness I used my points from players card and not payed for it . They also changed the Cafe . We ate there a couple of months ago and hated it . It was much better before . We used to eat there often and it was a little cheaper and the food quality was better . They still have great desserts though .",

After going here, I'd rather drive the 9 miles off the strip... (or just pay more)  The pictures are misleading. Most of the meat selections are dry and salty. Some sides has no flavour or they tasted like they were made from frozen. The people are nice, friendly, the place is very clean and well kept, food is always being replaced and filled.

If you're looking for a fresh seafood-heavy buffet, this obviously isn't the place, but if you're like me and you don't eat seafood anyway, this buffet is definitely a more justifiable price. On the other hand, if you're on a low-carb diet, this wouldn't be an ideal place for you if you have trouble resisting temptation...  When I say comfort food, I mean it: hush puppies, mac and cheese, Cheeto-crusted corn, pizza, bread, steamed dim sum, and a plethora of desserts. There's a DIY taco area, DIY noodles area, a salad bar, and a charcuterie, but as far as I remember, not a huge selection of fresh fruits nor a cheese table if that's what you're into. I'm a big fan of snack foods in general, so although this buffet is neither super-fancy nor super-healthy, I definitely get my snack fix.   Our waitress was very nice and attentive and always made sure our plates were cleared and beverages were filled. The interior is just beautiful to look at, and the ambiance is good for having a conversation without needing to yell over others.",

They labelled one item \"Crab Salad\", but it was so obvious that they used KRAB, the fake stuff.  Maybe they need to focus less on offering 20 million options that ALL SUCK and concentrate on making atleast one or two options that are actually edible!  This was hands down our WORST MEAL IN VEGAS!",

Their food in general seemed made from scratch! Their Gelato was not The best, I've  tasted.   The wait staff was excellent and that alone deserves 5 Stars!! I really commend the wait staff and I happen to meet the manager of the Buffet, Kai...she is an A+ person, graceful and courteous.  I would recommend this one just for the atmosphere, very pleasing to the eyes, food is made fresh with nice popular choices. Their different stations were clean/neat, gelato choice is an extra bonus. A lot of delicious fresh fruit and nuts in many many varieties as well as dinner rolls....All in all a good choice for brunch!",

Surly unfriendly table waitress, most food was so dry it was inedible.  Fish dishes dry, all of them.  Asia food way over cooked, no more Walnut shrimp, no General's Chicken.  Sushi was old and hard as a rock.  Tuna \"poke\", totally tasteless.  We were there for a little over an hour and sat facing the meat slicing station and smoked items.  I visited that station four times and could never get anyone to serve me the items I wanted.  Tried to get the guys on next station to help and they completely ignored me.  Never got smoked meats.  No duck dishes, no lamb dishes.  They eliminated the wonderful mashed creamy sweet potatoes.  They have also eliminated the macaroons at the desert area.  There were only two areas that were decent, the shrimp cocktails were nice with fairly large shrimp (3), and even though the macaroons were gone the desert area was still pretty tasty.    Bottom line, no more visits here!",

The chicken pot pie was so good also! Desserts were great, my favorite was the vanilla bean gelato and the brownie with caramel sauce on top. Service was even better. The name of our server was Ale and he was so polite and prompt with our drinks. I had to breast-feed my four-month-old here and used a nursing cover. I didn't get any dirty looks (not that I would've cared). Luckily, it wasn't too crowded and there's lots of space between tables. My 20 month old had to sit in a highchair, and the high chair was clean. I'm coming back for dinner for sure!",

This is not the buffet for prodigious amounts of crab legs and shrimp cocktail. Come here for 1) the flavors and 2) the quality. For 17.99 with players card, we enjoyed top quality dishes, most very delicately prepared. The cuts of meat they use are excellent. You have to understand that when you choose the mini-ramekin of Moroccan Lamb, you are getting fork-tender lamb chunks and not hockey pucks. The spices and preparation are spot-on. The Korean short ribs melt in your mouth like cotton candy.   There is a honey-walnut shrimp to die for. The Mongolian beef is not only flavorful, but again uses a cut-above of meat that other buffets in this price range just would not use. Nothing tough or stringy. Also, the dessert presentation (cinnamon roll bread pudding with hot caramel sauce, for Pete's sake!) is what you would experience at a 40.00 buffet.   Peruse the other photos to get a concept of the complete offerings. I'm here to tell you that the quality is the star here. (If you're a coffee drinker, don't fail to get a cuppa the house brand, ROYAL CUP.  Bold and delicious)",

An even better deal is their breakfast under $15.  As for the food, quality is just okay.  A.Y.C.E is perfect if you're trying to get calories in.  I'm not a huge buffet guy in the first place.  I'm also not a big eater unless I have to be.  I stayed away from the salad bar, desserts, and breads in order to keep my belly empty enough for the protein feast that I was going to partake in.  I had roughly 2,000 calories to spend and made sure I spent all of it.  I had 3 plates of protein and it included about 3 oz. carne asada, 3 oz. of walnut shrimp, 7 oz. of roasted turkey breast, 4 oz. of roast beef, a chicken thigh, chicken leg, 1 oz. of tilapia, 4 servings of salmon, 5 oz. of brisket, a cup of shredded cheese and one Brussels sprout.  I was craving crab legs and boiled eggs, but they didn't have it.  The roasted turkey breast and salmon were my two favorites.  I thought that the brisket and carne asada was on the dry side.  Overall, I recommend A.Y.C.E for the price.  You can say that I got my money's worth.  I arrived hungry and left full enough to skip my last meal of the day.",

    "text": "This is probably THE best Stations buffet in town now. If you're looking for a buffet with actual HEALTHY options, this is the one! Champagne is even included in the price.  and Rewards members get $4.00 off with their card. Larry, one of the greeters, thanked us for our patience waiting to be seated. He told us they were short on servers (it was a Sunday at about 1140am). We didn't notice: our server Yanet was on top of everything, and we never waited for our beverages, refills or anything at all. The orange juice was very fresh, with a little pulp. Coke products served here. The champagne was light and tasty, not super cheap cheesy stuff other places serve. Great layout. The food was outstanding. On the salad bar there was an assortment of different greens including spinach and kale, ceviche, lox and bagels, fresh fruits, fruit salads, four different soups, an even shrimp cocktail, which was excellent, as was the kale apple walnut salad. I also enjoyed the watermelon citrus salad very much. There was a poke tuna on white rice which was cold and served in a dish on a frozen serving area, and was very tasty. I also loved the different take they served of eggs Benedict. My favorite item by far was the cauliflower quinoa grits--a dash of brown sugar made them excellent! My hubs had beef brisket, and roast beef. The former looked kind of grey and he said tasted a bit rubbery, and the carved roast beef was underdone, so he was a bit disappointed in those choices. He did enjoy the French roast, roast ham, pizza, and made to order omelette. We both liked the pineapple, watermelon, and cantaloupe. Pistachio gelato was great, and the dessert area was huge! Excellent coffee. Food prep areas were spotless and staff could be seen wiping food serving areas constantly, as they were spotless and free if spills, etc. All around just outstanding from start to finish! Even though it's far from our house, we will return to the AYCE Buffet, AND The Palms now, too-- as we're excited to see all the changes Stations Casinos is making here.",

But this one was not so bad when it comes to pulling out your wallet, especially if you get a player's card which will get you a discount. However, I was not so crazy about the food. My favorite items on the menu were definitely the mashed potatoes and the macarons. If I wasn't so full at the end I would've gotten an ice cream sandwich which they make personalized with cookies and their house ice cream. If I had relatives in town I would take them here to eat because frankly everyone loves going to buffets when they come to Vegas. However, I don't think I would come here on my own. The staff was very kind and the atmosphere was relaxed, but the food was not at the top of my list.",

The food was a different story--I was let down by the choices they had to offer(no sushi area or seafood area) and the appearance of some of the items didn't seem appealing. Most of the hot food items weren't hot in terms of temperature. Their only saving grace for me was their Honey Walnut Shrimp and Ahi Poke bowl and the Desserts weren't too bad.  Honestly I've been to better buffets for a cheaper price. I left the buffet disappointed.",

We stayed in the hotel and happened to eat there for bunch and dinner (Sunday), I noticed how they didn't change the vegetarian options for the day at all. Just keep reheated the food. It wasn't that many options. So unless you like eating sushi with your mashed potatoes, then don't be surprised here. It's a buffet and they try to have something for everyone. For example the night I was there, they had jackfruit enchiladas. Also the options even for people who eat meat wasn't that diverse (at least the night I went there--basics but no one complained). It wasn't bad but I would recommend to a vegetarian who isn't picky or looking for anything special. Deserts were great. Good price for the overall experience.",

With the players card discount, the dinner buffet was a hair over $20.  The lowlights first: - beef jerky thought the roast beef was dry. And that was a medium cut.  - if you told me the shrimp in the shrimp cocktail was artificially manufactured, I would totally agree. Rubbery dry cocktail shrimp removed of any taste profile, mmmm! Goes with anything.  - very liberal use of liquid smoke on the ribs and brisket.  Granted the ribs and brisket weren't dry or indigestible (questionable) but please, there are many other ways I would like to receive my annual dose of bbq smoke goodness.  The highlights: - that watermelon was sweeeet! - the poke wasn't bad at all. A little sweet for my taste but hits all the marks on freshness.  - decent selection of various types of food though it's a sliver of each genre.  - no extremely long lines! If you're into that kind of thing.   May your experience be better than mine! Or try another place instead.",

I think we gave him the ultimate test of patience with all of our demands and requests. He passed the test with flying colors because for the entire time we were there, Josue P remained calm, pleasant and always has smile on his face. He has a very positive personality that radiates in him. He would ask us how we're doing from time to time. He went above and beyond for our group and I wouldn't be surprised if one day he will be promoted. He truly deserves it. He works hard and is a good example to his colleagues.

The Elote with hot Cheetos was a great concept...but was cold...  Ramen was cold... no broth for Ramen. Pulled pork...tasted ok..but was Luke warm.... seeing a trend here? The only highlight was the Lime Chicken.. that was good. The Salad bar was sparse..barely any toppings...but the ranch was tasty. Ice cream was pretty good. I will not return...not with Silverton and Orleans around the corner...this really REALLY fell short!",

The buffet line had a  good selection of food from BBQ, Sushi, Chinese, Italian, and Mexican.  Anytime they have elotes on a stick in the buffet line that earns an extra star. Good selection of desserts with an ice cream bar were you can make your own ice cream sandwich. The quality of the food was exceptional. The gourmet food was made by professionals. I highly recommend this buffet for dinner and I will return to  the the palms buffet on my next visit.",

While prime rib is as much of a thing of the past at most reasonably priced Vegas buffets as their $9.99 prices, the beef option shouldn't be most comparable to chewing gum.  That disappointment aside the majority of the selections were wonderful. The walnut shrimp was incredible. I've never had a shrimp plate that was so much shrimp and so little coating. They did an excellent job with the poultry. The ceviche was delicious. Little things like mashed sweet potatoes were great highlights for me personally.  I didn't try the desserts, but they did look very good.  Opinions differed at the table, but the short line and the overall excellent food makes this a pretty solid option for right off the strip.",

We came in after a long day of jiu jitsu competitions and wanted to celebrate with everyone. We told the front desk how many people were coming and she said we would have to tell the people who seat us. We all weren't able to show up at the same time. Even after telling the person who sat us, they sat us in an area with absolve seats and tables around but started to give the tables away to others coming. When my friend decided to sit at a long table to save it for people who were already in line given we were in the same party. This lady then asked him to leave and they said they couldn't do anything about the fact we have a lot of people coming. Then he apologized and sat back at our 4 person table. Then they decided to randomly take the table apart and make it all 2 people tables even though the entire other side was available for seating I felt they just did that so we couldn't have our group sit with us. Then we had one of the parents go up front to say something and they told us we never told them we had a big amount of people even though we pretty much told everyone we saw. I'm giving a one star for the food. The food was decent.",

Two ways I rate buffets and restaurants, Overall quality where price does not matter or quality value where both price and quality matter making it a good deal. This was neither. I was so disappointed with the lack of selection and quality of the food I ate. Yes $15 for lunch with players card is a very good price BUT I didn't feel like I got my moneys worth at all.

I would recommend this place if your trying to fill your belly and you have a taste for several different flavors, but you don't want to break your pocket book. This place is completely remodeled and spacious with a contemporary atmosphere. The staff is friendly also, however the waiter who waited on us may have been busy but wasn't as attentive at times. I say this because he passed the table a few times without checking on us, and also when he brought the wine we ordered he failed to check the cup for stains and there was a lipstick print on the rim of the cup I get it things happen and not on purpose he did bring us another glass. Overall dining here was a nice experience and the food was good. I would definitely swing through again to see what they have cooking. btw the salt and pepper wings and shrimp cocktail were some of my favorites.",

While we enjoyed most of the food we tried (especially the tacos, mashed potatoes, and Brussels sprouts!), the customer service was very much lacking. We were mis-charged for an extra person, and rather than apologize and eradicate the issue, we were engaged in a 20-minute long, back-and-forth discussion with the manager. Being on vacation, we are very wary of unusual activity with our bank, and between the 3 separate charges and 2 different card transactions at A.Y.C.E., we were disappointed that a simpler solution was not offered and that the attitude we were met with was not more apologetic and gracious. However, we enjoyed our meal, and the bussing staff was very attentive and kind. We would likely look elsewhere for a buffet next time, but recommend this if you have a smaller party and want a relaxed, low-pressure, fairly tasty meal.",

    "text": "Tried this buffet last Thursday night, based on the Yelp reviews. The last couple of buffets we went to were Aria and Bellagio, so our bar is pretty high as far as buffets go, but this place definitely impressed us. And factor in that it was ~$22/person (without the player's card) and you got yourself a darn good deal of a buffet.   The food was very good. Actually, their honey walnut shrimp was awesome! Our favorite version is the one at Panda Inn in Pasadena, and these were pretty gosh darn close to it! The shrimp were... shrimpier and less walnuts, but for the price, I'll take it! Husband tried the brisket and it was tough, assuming because it probably sat around a bit, but he got another one when a new batch came out and he said that was much better.   The French onion soup was salty.. which I find it to be the case more often than not with that soup, but not bad.  Service was great.. she kept the refills flowing, and kept our table clear of dirty plates. Great ambiance and clean too. Definitely a great option if you're in a buffet state of mind.",

    "text": "Had dinner at the newly remodeled Palms buffet A.Y.C.E on 5/19/2018 for dinner with my fiance. The price of $17.99 isn't that bad as long as you have a Station Rewards Card. At first glance the remodeled buffet area looked nice, better than some of the other station casino buffets that I have been to in the past. With trying some of the food, the salad bar area had three types of lettuce, decent amount of toppings and dressing. Also In the salad bar area there's a hummus bar with five different types of hummus to try. I tried the regular and roasted garlic and both tasted great. The salmon sushi was very delicious, even though it's not made there, it was cold and the rice was soft. The Cashew shrimp wasn't bad, had a couple of warm and cold pieces. At the pasta station the cook was very nice, there's only two types of pasta to choose from and a couple of toppings and the serving was plentiful, so much pasta that I couldn't eat it all. I love lasagna, however the lasagna was terrible, the sauce tasted water down and the meat was tasteless.  Tried a couple pieces of the beef bourguignan and it was cold, went up to the chef at the buffet and said something about how cold the meat was. The Chef tried a piece and agreed that the meat was cold and removed and replaced with a fresh hot batch. On the dessert area, the fudge brownies were heated and tastes warm and outstanding and I had to get seconds. The cheese cake was also outstanding. However there was covered strawberries that had a pink coating on them and they were way too sweet.  Overall: the buffet was ok especially for the price. Would we go again, I don't know.",

Each section only had a few items in it. It seems like they are trying to be more like wicked spoon with individual servings vs scoop out however much you want.  I went for Sunday Brunch. My favorite items were the French onion soup and apple juice! How sad is that? Not sure I'll be coming here again....",

    "text": "I tried the A.Y.C.E. Buffet at the Palms Casino for lunch based on the over 200 positive reviews on Yelp. The establishment is clean and spacious with tables placed far apart. There are seven different stations serving everything from healthy and vegetarian dishes to Asian to Roasted Meats to Barbecue to Desserts.  For the price it I absolutely a great value. There were a lot of choices but not as many as you might find at some other buffets but the quality of every single item that I tasted was stellar!  I tried some potstickers and spring rolls. Salt and pepper chicken wings which were fantastic. A bowl of clam chowder. Poke salad which was as good as I have found anywhere. Since I read that the pizza at the buffet was fantastic I tried a small slice and once again it was great pizza with a great crust and great cheese and toppings.  There were many other items but I didn't want to overeat and I will be back for dinner soon to try additional items. There is very little seafood (I saw some Thai Curried Mussels, but there are many other choices. I was disappointed in the Barbecue station because there was not one beef item.  The salad choices are extensive and the fruit was fantastic. The watermelon, cantaloupe and honeydew melon that I tried were great. The only thing I tried at the dessert station which was truly extensive was some pistachio gelato and that was as good as it gets as well.  The service was fast and the dishes were cleared quickly. Great value at a great price.",

    "text": "First off I want to emphasize how great our servers were. Attentive and very friendly. We had no problem with that part of our lunch. Our issue was their hostess and supervisor on the floor. We arrived there 12 noon for lunch . Our party consists of my parents (senior citizens) , my 6 month pregnant sister with her 5 year old daughter and 2 year old son, me and my wife along with our four kids. Ages 5 month old , 2 year old , 3 year old and 9 year old. After paying for our party, they told us To go  back out towards the casino floor since our table was not ready yet. It took roughly 15 minutes until they called us back in which I have no problem with it. But when we got to our table , they inexplicably placed us in two separate tables. So we asked the hostess and supervisor why can't they put the two tables together. We attempted to explain that my parents and sister are visiting from out of town and it would be nice to sit together in the same table and also it is easier to feed and watch one infant, 3 toddlers and 2 kids in the same table. The supervisor answer was because we didn't tell the hostess up front that we had kids with us. What!!!!!! It's a bullshit explanation because it totally says on the receipt which they took right after we paid to see how many in our party. And then she proceeds telling us that since we were by the kitchen they cannot put those two tables together. Then we asked if they can move us to different spot, they refused because the supervisor says there aren't any other tables open. clearly when we looked around there are plenty of open tables. Another excused she came up with was that they cannot put more than  6 people per table due to safety issues and then when we looked around again there were atleast 2 parties with 8 people and the other 10 people. All adults. I wish AYCE buffet would be more considerate to accommodate families especially those who have toddlers and kids .Then again our family is not exactly Caucasian so maybe that has something to do with. Who knows??",

Price: $22 with station casino player card on Sunday night.  Environment: it's a good place to hangout with your friends and family, pretty casual dining place.   Staff: the host lady was so nice, she was doing amazing job. During the time she lead me to my seat, she introduced me that they had seven food sections and her recommendations for the day would be French onion soup, which tasted pretty nice. The waitress was different story, I understand as an buffet restaurant staffs are always busy, but through out the entire time I sit there, she didn't refill my water and drink even once. And she even purposely avoid her customers when the table next to me was looking her. Big disappointment!  Food:  They had seven food sections. I recommend the orange chicken and Panang curry, they fried chicken pretty well, and the sauce and the seasoning was on point. The panang curry was flavorful, the beef inside were super tender.  I also recommend the BBQ items on smoke section, almost every meat items here were so tender and juicy, that really surprised me. Even the steak here is tender and juicy, it not chewy or rubbery.  Dessert: The do have variety of dessert choices. They even served macaroons, cream puffs, and cream brulees. However, the taste of those isn't surprised me as much as the BBQ items.  Overall, the food quality was not bad, but it doesn't worth $22 for sure. Waitresses need serious training. I wish yelp would let me put 3.5 stars, that's how I truly feel about this place.",

If you've been to the old Palms buffet (Bistro Buffet) you already know any resemblance to the old space has been gutted, reinvented and given a face lift - R.I.P. the all you can drink beer & wine that used to be included free with dinner..  Out with the old in with the new right?- Well after my visit i am convinced that the wait was well worth it. Station Casinos have this old habit of making all their buffets painfully similar, but not this time! Palms buffet is a gem of its own. I found the food to be presented very nicely, saw a selection of items not usually found at your typical Vegas buffet, and found the atmosphere to be quite inviting.   Usually i'd be listing off specific items i enjoyed the most to members of the Yelposphere, but since this is newly introduced venue I wanted to leave some of the excitement  and curiosity intact. Kind of like a newly released movie you don't want to reveal ALL the details to. Go check it out! I've given you the ever so important assurance that my experience was a thumbs up!",

I liked their gumbo and pea soup, while my wife raved about the penang soup.  Desert bar is off the chain.  For Station Casino card members, dinner will run you a measly $17.99.

Their food court loaded with fast food and food that doesn't have any carb in it.  We went for lunch and price was $13.79 per person which is not so bad.   Food  They offer a lot of snacks, meals, salad bar, ice cream and dessert bar, but fruits selection is not big only honeydew and pineapple (very poor choice of fruits ), also I didn't saw beef anywhere.   Drinks  They have drinks which waiters available to provide. For alcohol beverages one has to pre-pay.   Sweets I tried desserts and ice cream for me it's too sweet and not tasty seems to be artificial flavored.   Overall experience 4-/5 but it could be better. I tried to come at dinner but wasn't ready to wait another hour in queue. They need to improve their coordination and assist in reducing the queue faster. We noticed that there were a lot of empty tables while people where waiting for hours to get their table.",

They have Chinese food, al pastor was good, chicken wings were good too. Weak on greenery area. We stayed till 4pm for dinner to eat bbq ribs, brisket, boil seafood and honey walnut shrimp.  My sister said honey walnut and brisket was very good. Otherwise food is average. The staff are very good on refills on drinks and clearing the tables.",

    "text": "Price: pretty affordable compared to other buffets on the strip that cost around $30-40.  The dinner here is around $20 (without their \"boarding pass\" card)  This buffet is better than similarly priced \"cheap\" buffets I've been to (like circus circus), because it's super new (opened in Dec 2017) and the food is better than I expected for $20.  The main thing difference from fancier buffets would probably just be less seafood (they have shrimp and cooked fish options, but no crab legs and not much sushi).  I like the small portioned plates - they make the food look more attractive and (hopefully) help reduce food waste.  Most notably, it was cool that they had \"trendy\" foods like poke (tasted meh), and ELOTE!!  I was extremely happy that they had elote, and not only that, they had THREE kinds of elote! (including cheeto-covered, which I didn't try but I thought was pretty trendy of them).  Cons: The \"ice cream\"/\"gelato\" (the one they scoop, not the one from the machine) was really bad. It tasted really weird with that medicine sweet taste.  Overall, quite a good value and nice place for $20.",

    "text": "Went here with the family when visiting Vegas. First off, the prices can be deceiving. Most Vegas buffets advertise their regular price, and then point out discount with players cards.  AYCE advertises the price that very few people would receive because you need a GOLD players card to get that price. For example, lunch is regularly $15.99. With a regular players card, it is $13.99. With a gold players card, it's $11.99. $11.99 is what they have listed as the price on all their advertising. I never even see the $15.99 anywhere. That being said, we were fortunate someone in our group had a gold card which I think is good for 5 people.  The lunch buffet was very good with a wide selection of different foods. We normally hit Green Valley or Southpoint for a cheap lunch buffet, but AYCE is definitely a cut above both. They had sushi, poke, mussels, gelato. Things you normally don't find at a mid-level buffet. You're paying about 40% more than the other buffets I mentioned if you don't have a gold card. The players card is linked to all Station Casinos who also own Palms, Green Valley and Red Rock. Instead of paying the extra for the buffet with a regular card, start throwing some money in the slot machines to work your way up to gold! :)",

Usually they say you pay for what you get. I think you get way more that what you pay for. I mean 26( I believe now) for dinner is honestly a cheap price to pay especially when you're talking vegas buffets.  AYCE has everything you want when you want to have a good meal, great presentation, service,staff and most importantly food. First off the presentation is the best and  just makes everything look so much more appealing. Some of my favorites include the French onion soup, the pot pies, Shepard pies, elote, the meats..all the meats!  Oh gosh and I almost forgot the desserts, the variety and the sizing is perfect, so you can have one of each and not get too full off one thing.. I mean unless you want to. It's truly a foodies paradise. So many options!  Last but not least, the atmosphere and the staff; everyone is so friendly and courteous. One of the chefs(mike) is extra helpful and always making sure everything's going good.",

Arrived to a large line, which wasn't a surprise. The 45 minute to hour wait though, was a surprise.   From what I could tell, the broken link in this buffet is the turnover of tables. I watched one table from the line and noticed that it took close to 20 minutes for the table to be cleansed and ready for other guests.  Once inside (45 minutes later) and with a better view, I noticed that many tables were slow to be cleaned and prepared for more people. It looks like they use wait staff to get the table ready and a busser comes by eventually to finish and clean. The problem I could see if that they only have 1 busser per side of the buffet. And this is the reason for a slow down. One or two more people would greatly increase the speed of the lone on weekends.   As for the food and the wait staff, both are great. Waiter got our drinks quickly and the food was great, per usual. Though I was sad they ran out of French onion soup right as I got to the area.   This buffet is the best option at the best price in town, hands down. Will come back. Just not on the weekend until someone can fix this easy but debilitating problem.",

Really made sure we enjoyed our dining experience.   My husband and I were surprised at how many seafood options A.Y.C.E. offered as well. Definitely a pleasant surprise.   Favorite items: -Black beans -Pulled pork -Poke  -Mac and cheese -Mussels -Mediterranean cod  -Wedge salad  -Bread pudding  -Elote w/ hot Cheeto crumbs -Gelato  There wasn't anything that was bad or not worth getting.

Some of my favorites were the bagels with smoked salmon, hummus, walnut shrimp, and the eggs benedict. Some of the popular items were quickly emptied, but the staff was good about refilling.

I'm a regular patron at the AYCE buffet, and considering that I'm a Vegas local, my words should rightfully carry weight.  I've been to every popular buffet that's located in the Las Vegas area, and inevitably I always prefer dining at AYCE over the buffets offered by both The Wynn and Bellagio -- AYCE simply crushes the competition in all aspects.  AYCE does it right every step of the way. I was initially greeted at the counter by a very friendly young lady by the name of Magda. She welcomed me into the establishment and set me up with a host as fast as possible, in order to be quickly seated.  Shortly after being seated at my table, a server by the name of Rafael greeted me and took my drink order. This gentleman was excellent at anticipating my needs, evident by the fact that he initially brought me two diet pepsi's, instead of just one.  The bottom line -- AYCE is the cream of the crop.",

You're able to get a discount with your players card on every meal and sometimes there's a BOGO deal for meals, so be on the look out for that.  The interior decor of the buffet is still very modern and hipster. The line for the buffet can get pretty long for dinner so be there at 4PM when dinner starts, unless you don't mind the wait.   The quality of the food is not bad for the price, they have so many choices from Asian food such as a bao to American BBQ.  But all the good food does get taken very quickly, I personally loved their rib from the \"smoke and fire\" section but it was all gone on my second round T.T so sad. BUT on my third round, hot cheeto elote popped up from no where. I'VE NEVER SEEN AN ELOTE AT A BUFFET. This buffet is full of suprises.  There's been rumors that macaroons are served in this buffet as dessert but that's not True despite that, there's still an amazing dessert bar from gelato ice cream to mini cupcakes. Can't forget the chocolate covered strawberries!",

I remember the old Palms buffet many years ago before it got renovated, and some of my favorite items are still there such as hummus and baba ganoush.  Holiday weekend buffet lunch price was about $17, and that was without any player card discount.  Very good price point for being Strip adjacent.  Negatives were there seemed to be a lot of chicken items and less variety of other meats. Not much seafood selection either.  The dessert items were a bit limited.  No cake slices. The positives were the ginormous whole turkey legs, tuna poke salad, custom pasta bar, and the salt and pepper chicken wings.   Service was excellent as they provided drink refills on the regular. One suggestion would be to change the name.  A.Y.C.E. is too generic and needs a better marketing name.",

So of course its only natural that when im in Vegas - I have to check some buffets out right?  We had wicked spoon for dinner on our first night - which is our usual spot to hit up when we're in Sin City. I love wicked spoon! but now its the next day we're talking about and i'm on yelp in search of another buffet. Came across this place - I thought it was a korean bbq at first because that's what its referred to in LA (well sushi too lol) but when I saw the reviews - and the PRICE, i knew i had to check it out.  We came on Tuesday at 10:45am. I didn't want breakfast items so we walked around the casino for a bit. Never been to the Palms and oh my its so nice! Around 11:10am we headed back over to the buffet and oh my word - the line was packed. We paid $16 (no players card) and it was still such a good deal.  This buffet is pretty interesting. Its not huge like the typical ones on the strip but still offered quite a lot of selections. I like the little names they have for each section. The stand outs are the salt & pepper wings, the elotes, the mac and cheese AND THE DESSERTS. I'd pick this dessert bar over Wicked Spoon any day.  Definitely coming back next time.",

    "text": "The buffet inside the Palms Casino a little bit off the Strip. Went there because this place was recommended as a Las Vegas buffet that is not too expensive and has decent quality food. We went for Saturday lunch, and had to wait about 15 minutes to get in. There were plenty of tables, it's just that they didn't have enough hosts leading customers to the tables. The buffet is clean and modern.  The lunch was $16 + tax without any discounts. AYCE is set up like a food court with a number of food stalls on the wall, and the salad bar right at the entrance. There wasn't anything too fancy, but not surprising given the price and the fact it was lunch. A couple of the items that were really good were the cod pieces, the fried chicken wings, and also the catfish pieces in the little metal bowls. On the flip side, the mussels were served in a sauce that was too salty, while the pork loin at the carvery was a little dry. The dessert section was pretty decent, and you can ask the server at the station to make you an ice cream cookie sandwich. Overall, I think there were enough good items to make the trip worthwhile. I definitely stuffed myself.",

I can go on & on. The Kalbi beef and BBQ ribs were our favorite. The gelato was also light, fluffy and incredible. So delicious!  Some of the items like the cod and the French onion were a bit salty for our preference but every dish was made to the perfect temperature & consistency.

The line at the register was short and the cashiers and staff were so friendiy and helpful.  We thought the food was pretty tasty.  We went for dinner and we liked the mix of unique items as well as familiar fair.  For example they had individual Shepherd pies; individual French onion soups and individual wedge salads.  But they also had a salad bar with other soups.  And then there was more soup in the Asian section.  The carving station was nice and the pizza was pretty good.  Also they had great BBQ ribs - really good smoke flavor.   We admittedly couldn't eat as much as we wanted, but what we did try was delicious.  The desert selection was on the smaller side, but everything was good.  We are so happy we tried this and can't wait to go back.  Good food and great service - can't top that!",

    "text": "I asked the cashiers if I could do a walk through of this vast space to see if the Champagne Brunch, although very reasonably priced, was worth it for me for two reasons: 1) I dislike brunches because I generally do not eat large portions of anything and 2) I was diagnosed with Celiac disease (yes it is real and I almost died 20 years ago) so most buffets are very problematic for me and not worth it. I strolled around the numerous stations and since they even had 5 items in a GF section, I decided to plunge right in.   Unfortunately, as I went around to the various stations asking the carvers and people behind each station, no one could confirm that the food was GF. My table server didn't have a clue and after being told that some items that seemingly would be safe I was told were not. In frustration, I spoke to the Manager who told me that the people working there didn't really know and that she would have the head Chef Michael walk the entire line with me. Chef Michael came out, greeted me and took me around the entire buffet not only telling me all the food I could have, which was extensive, how it was prepared, but also what he could make for me as well. My gastronomic angel.  Champagne, mini clam bake, smoked tri tip, grits, yams, greens, and even GF pancakes. I think I sat there and almost ate from 10:00 am until the Super Bowl when a hydraulic fork lift would have to lift me up from my booth and deposit me in the Sports Book to watch the game at 3:30pm. How much food can a person eat in 5.5 hours? A lot. There was a great selection and with my small discount, I certainly had plenty of food that was of very good quality. Thanks again to Chef Michael for saving the day for this diner.",

We did our research, and A.Y.C.E. kept popping up as one of the best. It is located in the beautiful Palms hotel.  We anticipated a line like most popular buffets, and this was no exception.  I knock off one star for line inefficiency.  The place was packed, but people were leaving at a fast pace and tables were not being turned over fast enough.  The place is pretty big and there is plenty of room to walk around.  The price though steep for a buffet, it is still considerably cheaper than most of the higher end buffets.  In my opinion, the price was worth it for me.  The service and food both were outstanding.  I say this alot, but this place truly has something to please anyone.  They have an awesome salad bar. They have all sorts of international food.  They have a carving station.  They have smoked and grilled food.  They have an amazing assortment of desserts which are sized just right as not to waste.  They have it all.  My daughter who is the worst person to take to any buffet, ate three full plates.  Three!!  I won't say how many plates I ate, but I have no regrets!  A.Y.C.E. is off the strip, but well worth the trip to eat some good food.  I have ate at some of the other popular spots, but this place is my favorite so far.",

He said it should be ready in about 5 mins.  I came back and he had it all ready for me. I ate the vegetable fried rice and it was excellent! I later found out the name of the person who offered to make the special order of fried rice for me was Benny.  After my meal I was so impressed with Benny's excellent service I asked to talk to the Chef to tell him about my experience. Chef Saul came out and was so nice and helpful. I also told him how great tasting the food was in addition to it being nice and fresh.

(The Palms has been undergoing a lot of renovation, which in my opinion is a way better look then what the Palms was beginning to look creepy and dark). They have arranged the different serving areas into seven divisions.  The foods presented are in small serving vessels, something like the excellent,and I would.... recommend the Wicked Spoon ,at the Cosmopolitan.       The recipes found at each station are somewhat different then the 'standard' stations casinos buffet foods. The recipes are not bad nor are they excellent.      The saving grace in the whole A.Y.C.E. experience is the area called 'Smoke and Fire ',which serves smoked meats. I had the best smoked turkey wing. The salt and pepper chicken found on the World Pan side of the buffet was very good and tasty. My picture shows the chicken, with the delicious olive salad. The other items you see on the plate, in the photo, not so good.  All of their fish dishes and the calamari were rubbery, dry, and overcooked.    The desserts I think are a failure. In my opinion, the Station Casinos are below standard for what could be provided to the general public. (Eating at stations casinos desserts are often processed sugar put into the shape of something: be it pies, cakes or soft serve ice cream).  I had the pistachio gelato. The gelato  was heavy, lacking flavor, and loaded with sugar. It should not be called gelato in my opinion.      All the other dishes presented that day looked bland and unappetizing with a selection of some odd morsels for a lunch time buffet. There is no Deli area which would have been a great addition to the buffet.- To serve a deli section as part of a buffet experience, for example like a N.Y. style would be great!  Stations have not done that, and in my opinion probably could.      I was there at noon when they should have been on their game at the salad bar which was messy, food around edges, with spoons that had been used for other salads put in with other salads. I chose not to eat any of their salad options except for their olive salad which was pretty good. The staff were friendly and courteous. Their beverages average  Our waitress was good and for $12.... life couldn't be better.      I don't think I would take friends there from out of town , but would go directly to Green Valley Ranch or Red Rock, because they seem to just do it a little better with their tastes and some of their recipes.  I will go back again in the future.  I will come back to this review with an update. Because it's the new kid on the block, for the locals, I would recommend people to go to it and judge themselves because like all food service there are off days.",

Salads are delicious! They can make a cookie ice cream to your taste.  I noticed on my second visit that all the servers and hostesses have a modern take on their uniforms.

For the money, I personally don't think it is worth it, especially the Sunday brunch. For $21.00 they have minimal offerings compared to the best buffet in town, The M Buffet/Studio Buffet at the M casino. For a couple dollars more you should go there as the place is huge and has much more to offer.  Tiny desert area with no pie offerings.  Wait and host staff is ok, not that personable.  Another thing to mention is that when I eat at a buffet, I do not eat for the rest of the day. On all 3 occasions at this place, I didn't feel too good afterwards....tummy aches and a bit of nausea. Third times a charm and I won't be returning as I gave enough opportunity.",

Skip the dry pita bread. The buffalo mac and cheese was gross, but the traditional version was good. They offer three variations of a few of their dishes, including corn on the cob.  They have a \"Raclette\" station where cheese is melted on small griddles and then poured on top of dishes of sauteed veggies, potatoes, and pasta. I saw slices of orange cheese and white cheese being used, likely something other than raclette, but I'm not sure what kind. If you like watching cheese melt, check this out.  The cinnamon roll bread pudding was the stand-out dessert item. The assorted macarons including pistachio, coffee, chocolate, lemon, and raspberry, tasted fresh, unlike the dry macarons at other high-end buffets.  For the price, under $20, it's definitely five stars. They don't appear to offer crab legs, which seems to keep the entrance line short, and that's also worth five stars. Parking is still free at the Palms. I don't like any other Stations Casino Feast Buffet, but this one is good because it's brand new.",

The food may be good, but the wait time to get in is not acceptable. My wife & I got in line on a Wednesday morning at around 10:20am to catch what we thought would be an early lunch. The line was less than half of what it was on the 3 previous times we visited on weekends. We still waited over an hour and there were still about 8 people ahead of us in line, not to mention the people who had paid and were waiting to be seated! WTF! We bailed out of the line and our plans to enjoy a Vegas Buffet were ruined because we had appointments to get to and if we had waited, we would have not been on time for them. We live locally and frequent a number other local buffets. As I posted, the food here isn't bad, but the way management manages the line is awful by only having 1 cashier available during busy times. The food isn't worth the wait. If you are looking for a good Vegas Buffet experience, don't go here because you'll waste half your day, or night just waiting to pay to get in, and more time waiting to be seated after you pay. Don't waste your time waiting in line here.",

Kids are cheaper however I am unsure of the age range on that. I just know my 5 yr old was $6.99; for 4 plus drinks I paid $45.  Their French toast is decent, frittata actually really good; scrambled eggs are good (actually cooked in butter),  pancakes, bacon, sausage all good. Chiliqueles had very good flavor however I wish the tortilla had a bit more crunch to it, it was too mushy.  All in all a good buffet especially for the price. Steer clear of the banana fosters waffle not good.",

It was a great choice! We arrived around 3:30 pm and were able to take advantage of the brunch items and unlimited mimosas until 4pm. The items were switched out little by little starting around 4pm so we also had a sampling of the dinner selections. The Moroccan lamb was fantastic. The bbq was tasty and sushi and poke were very fresh.   We had 3 plates each and had to roll back to the Rio. It was our favorite meal on our 12 day road trip. I highly recommend it for anyone wanting the buffet experience in Vegas without spending too much. Also, here is a tip: get the players rewards card and you can save a few bucks on the price of the buffet.",

I mean.. $20 pp plus tax and tip for all you can eat just sounded too good to be True!   We arrived at 6 pm and waited about 40 mins to be seated - Enough time for my husband and I to take turn in signing up for palms reward card ($2 off buffet). Once seated, we hurried off to check out their selections.   There were some trendy options - Cheetos cob of corn, Buffalo Mac and cheese, raclette covered veggies, jackfruit enchiladas. They also offer the classics - prime ribs, bbq, stir frys, and pizzas. The trendy options were fun to try but I ate mainly their pork ribs and briskets (have to pick around for the perfect cut). Apparently they smoke their briskets for 10 hours? The fattier, the tastier!   Their variety of desserts didn't compare to wicked spoons of course butttt every item they offered was done well. The staff behind the gelato station was the sweetest. Genuinely eager to assist whoever is eyeing the sweet treats.   Overall - For 1/3 of the strip dinner buffet price - the quality was pretty much the same. The variety might be less (no crab legs, no sushi, no fancy meat cuts) - but $20 pp is a definite steal and well worth a visit.",

I went for the lunch buffet with 2 other people and we waited over an hour to get to the register.  When we got to the register there was a group of guys next to me that were literally standing so close to me they were touching me and leaning over the counter while I was paying. They were staring at my credit card. The cashier kept looking at them but never said a word. When I was almost done paying the guy totally smashes into me. Him and his group decided it would be a good idea to exchange some words with me. The cashier still never said a word. I found this totally inappropriate and would never return just for this reason.  But we went inside and were extremely disappointed. The buffet is very small, they only have a few stations. The salad bar might as well not even exist. What a joke! They had a \"vegan\" section that looked like it had not been refreshed in days. Every person that walked up to it, just turned and walked away.   The were not a lot of choices unless you like Asian food. That was the only station they were paying any attention too. Everything else looked old and was just not worth eating.   The dessert station also a total let down. They had 2 vegan choices (choc. pudding and a brownie) both disgusting. Very few choices for other items. There main focus on dessert is the gelato case and it wasn't that good.   I felt this entire experience was a complete waste of my money and time and I will never go back to the Palms. This was my first time back since they re did the place and it is worse now than before.",

Starting with our hostess Edwina she explained the changes and she seemed excited just to be telling us. She told us how much she loved her job! We then met Mary Giraud to pass our pleasant experience with Edwina. Mary was great also. The restaurant looked great. The food quality and presentation was excellent! You guys got it right!",

    "text": "We went here on a week night for dinner. There was no line & not crowded at all but it did take them a good 10-15 min to set up our table (4 adults & 2 highchairs). We had our players cards so dinner was $2 off normal price. At first glance the place looks amazing. Definitely a huge upgrade from the previous buffet. The hotel is really closed off because of the remodel but the cafe & buffet are completely redone. They did have the new smaller high chairs and everything was very clean.   When we were seated our server immediately greeted us, took our drink orders and gave us a run down of the food stations. The concept is great but I felt like they were trying to make the buffet more tapas style but the quality of the food was not that great. The food was sitting out too long under the heaters bc most of the food was dry and the meats were over cooked and tough.   The foods that were delicious and being eaten and replenished often were great (walnut shrimp, carved turkey, fresh fruit, and Mac and cheese) But everything just sat there.   This would be last choice for a station casino buffet. Maybe if they fine tune their menu and have fresher prepared food it could be a great buffet.   The staff was super friendly and very attentive. And they have \"cleaners\" coming around sweeping up the floors.",

Tip=park on the top floor of the self-parking structure, and get some awesome views of Las Vegas at night!   As for the buffet, there is a variety of foods.  The good thing about here is that you recognize the foods, it's not so fancy or so unique that you'll be standing at the buffet line wondering what it is and if you should take it.  Although I got pretty full on eating the beef (with au jus),custom-created pasta, and shrimp, my stomach did what she does and acted empty so that I could overstuff myself without guilt on dessert.  GELATO!  There was even an option for Gelato stuffed cookie sandwiches! There were other desserts, of course, such as cheesecake and flan, and even sugar free type desserts (for those that need that option).   Planning on coming here every time we come to Las Vegas.  Thank you to my aunty (a Las vegas local) for bringing us here to eat :)",

My sister and I went to the buffet and were excited to get an omelette as some good ol' recovery food. Unfortunately when we got there we had barely missed the closing time of the omelette station. We were just chatting amongst ourselves about the bad luck. Adrian, a chef there, over heard us and went out of his way and started re-opening up the station for us. We didnt even know anyone could hear us! Anyway, he happily cooked for us and we got our muuuuch wanted eggs and not only was it extremely thoughtful but super delicious as well!! Will 100% be back. You do not find kind people like that everywhere. Thank you Adrian! You were GREAT",

Certainly, the casino and the buffet itself are beautiful and right up there with buffets on the Strip.  The food was decent, but there wasn't much in the way of boiled shrimp or crab legs.  The fried chicken was covered in salt.  I'd say the buffet here was as good as others I've been to in Vegas.    Service by our waitress was super.  The front desk told us to get casino member cards to get a small discount on the buffet.",

Elotes still aren't on brunch but they should be. Also, the elotes should be warmed up like they were when the buffet first opened.  The Korean short ribs are my favorite for dinner. I also dig the sausage and hush puppies.  I have yet to try the cold ramen but maybe I will try that next week.",

You can sign up for one for free if you don't have one. If you have one, you can get discount for you and someone else with just one card. Higher levels get a better deal, as cheap as $18 for dinner. Basic soda and iced tea included. Alcohol available for purchase. See menu photo I posted.  We came close to 8pm and waited in line for about an hour. They close at 9pm but serves food until 9:30p.  Variety is a bit limited but the quality of the food is better than a lot of buffets I've been to. What I especially liked was the asian food. They had a curry, Mongolian beef and walnut shrimp that were all good. Prime rib was good too. The soft serve was not watery as I expected and was actually really creamy and good.  They also had a bbq station with chicken, ribs and brisket. The smoke on the meat was good but all lacked seasoning.   Overall it was a pretty good buffet especially for the price.",

The food was less than average with no taste , seasoning and dry or soggy .   I try not set my expectations to high for any buffet but this was one of the Worst!

    "text": "A.Y.C.E.= All You Can't Eat  Well that was the first and last for me. I was really expecting something much better from this casino. I love taking my family to buffets because there are plenty of options out there even for the pickiest eaters. But that wasn't the case here. For a buffet that showcased several different ethnic stations they only had very few selections available. The shortribs at one station looked really juicy but I found them to be quite the opposite and felt like I was chewing part of a rubber boot. I'm not exaggerating when I say that. The meat was really tough. I ended up spitting it out in my napkin. Moving onto the sushi..They had a few different types of cut rolls available but no nigiri. They all tasted very dry and flavorless. I couldn't help but assume that they were left out uncovered overnight. In that case, maybe its a good thing they didn't have any nigiri. They also had these little individual bucket looking thingies with some kind of seafood boil available and that little dish tasted like bland water with a hint of sea salt and a chewy mussel in it.. Not good. Wish the broth had more flavor. Another soup I saw that looked interesting had some apple in it. I can't remember what it was called. Apple something soup. Anyway, skip this. Gerber apple baby food in the jar tastes waaayy better. Like any other casino buffet they have a salad bar and a meat carving station. As for their desserts they had different ice creams and cupcakes that looked sooo good.. But that was just it. They only looked good. The only thing possibly saving this place are the BOGO deals that they mail out to locals. I left here disappointed and  hungry. I wouldn't even eat here for free even if I was comped. If I had to eat at another station casino buffet I'd probably just go to Red Rock, Green Valley, or Sunset buffet where the foods actually have some type of flavor in them. Plus they serve crab legs on fridays at the GVR location.",

    "text": "Did you hear that the Palm's just spent $690 million for renovations on the entire hotel this year?  When I got wind of this, I just couldn't resist but to check out their new buffet.  If you've been inside the Palms prior to their complete makeover, you'll no doubt notice the night and day change for the better.  It's modern, it's hip, it's fun.  We even made a few bucks in the casino.  I just wish the food inside the buffet was as good as everything else.   The interior of this restaurant is definitely 5-stars.  It's nicely updated, modern and spacious.  It's a nice place to linger over a lengthy buffet meal.  The millions spent on renovating the entire hotel clearly shows, and the buffet is just one of the areas that reflect its tasteful design.  Unfortunately, that's where things peaked.  Normally at buffets, my eyes are bigger than my tummy, but not here.  Overall, most of the 3-star quality food was just mediocre.  I certainly didn't leave hungry, but I actually left feeling like I \"needed\" to eat more than I actually did.  Now, that's unheard of for me at a buffet!   Much of the food is extremely salty!  I think they must've accidentally dropped an entire box of salt into the sausage mixture by accident and proceeded anyway.  Not kidding.  I realize sausages are typically salty, but I'm not exaggerating about the box of salt.    The highlight was the salt and pepper fried chicken wings which were fresh and just like the ones served at one of my favorite places in San Francisco's Chinatown.  The fried shrimp and walnuts were a close second.  Coming in third for me were the crawdads in curry sauce.  The curry sauce would've definitely benefitted from being much thicker, as opposed to being watery thin, but it had a nice spicy kick, and nicely complemented the crawdads.  Other than these items, nothing else stood out, except the uber-fresh sugar cones used at the soft-serve ice cream station.    Desserts were nicely presented and looked very appealing, but like the food, they were overall of 2-3 star quality.  Lots of small bites, but completely absent were any slices of cakes and fruit pies that you'd normally see at buffets.    Service was mixed.  Our server was pleasant, though not necessarily attentive.  However, I observed a customer asking for a made-to-order omelet towards the end of the brunch.  He was told, somewhat flippantly, that there was absolutely no way they could accommodate him because it was towards the end of the Sunday brunch.  The customer accurately pointed out that there were 15 minutes left until the end of the Brunch, but the employee was not budging and insisted that they needed the extra time to start to bring out the dinner food.  What? Why?  The Sunday Brunch actually cost more than dinner, and there was still 15 minutes left of Brunch time.  Not cool.  Not right.    Note that there's a 2-hour table time limit.   Oddly, there was also heavy-metal music playing in the background at an annoying decibel.  I realize the Palm's is demographically targeting a younger clientele, but heavy metal over brunch/dinner?!?  I was really excited about trying this buffet.  However, based on my first visit, unless I happen to find myself at the Palm's again and super hungry, my dining here was probably a one and done for me.",

The food was overall pretty good, there was some items that were over cooked (chicken teriyaki and shrimp boil), but most of the food was good. The variety was decent. It seemed a little on the pricey side at $25, but I hear that is normal for the VEGAS Strip. I did enjoy the variety of food options and especially the dessert. My favorite entree was the sushi and the smoked sausage, favorite dessert was the cappuccino ice cream and the coffee custard. If I am back in Vegas I may come back. It was decent for a buffet. I would have liked to have more signage for the items (a lot were missing) and the dirty plates piled up pretty high at our table.",

    "text": "I remember back when the Palms buffet used to be terrible. But ever since the casino was bought out by Station Casinos, everything has been way better including the buffet. We first tried it out soon after the remodel about a year and half ago, and have been coming about once every couple months since then!  Not only are their food stations good, but the quality of the food overall is superior to any other Station Casino or off-strip casino for that matter. My favorites are the BBQ station, and the Asian station. Their salt and pepper chicken wings are just the best! They also often have really good pork adobo and kalbi short ribs, although it's not always on the buffet! We've been for lunch and dinner, and although lunch is cheaper, the food is much better during dinnertime!   My only complaint is that the line is often long, and not because there is not enough seating. It's always because there are only 2 cashiers available... It's kind of stupid to have 2 cashiers when the line is over an hour long. Only reason why I can't give them 5 stars! It never seems like the staff is in a hurry either!",

    "text": "Although it's not centrally located on the Strip, the AYCE buffet at Palms is worth it at its price point, especially since it's ~$16/person for lunch. The wait wasn't too bad for Saturday lunch, about 15 minutes. They have different stations to specify the type of prep/cooking like the Greenery, Revival, World Pan, the Roastery, the Hearth, Smoke & Fire, and Sweet & Light.  The Greenery is more than the basic salad bar. It has a variety of vegetables and greens but also fresh pre-made salads and elegant, gourmet options like an arugula fig salad or pesto mozzarella, one of my favorites. There's assorted breads, fruits, salad dressings & toppings, and cold pastas.  Revival is a vegan/vegetarian station that revamps the traditional vegetarian dishes and included mushroom quesadillas, pita bread and hummus, rainbow chard hash, and zucchini noodles in marinara. Nothing is really special and most of the stuff is pretty bland. At least there's healthy, light options. But let's be real, you're not going to an all-you-can-eat buffet looking for healthy stuff, you're here to indulge.  World Pan is pretty extensive and contains mostly Asian cuisine because it doesn't really fit anywhere else and includes beef & broccoli, dumplings, gyoza, pork buns, fried rice, adobo, poke bowls, and honey walnut shrimp. There's also elotes, paella, and a DIY taco section (al pastor, fajitas, pico de gallo, guacamole, sour cream etc).    There's also the Hearth which is focused on oven baked and/or Italian items like assorted pizza, strombolis, and pasta dishes (penne, mac and cheese). They had a variety of baked macaroni dishes like the traditional one topped with breadcrumbs but also one with Flamin' Hot Cheetos garnished on top. Most of these options are skippable in my opinion. You can definitely get better pizza and strombolis (so flavorless) elsewhere. There's chicken pot pie in individual ramekins (amazing), Thai Red Curry Mussels (not great), and a DIY pasta bar.  The Roastery is more meat-based items like roast beef and fried pollock, calamari steaks, but also sliders, mashed potatoes and many different gravies and sauces.  Smoke & Fire has savory comfort food like BBQ ribs, BBQ pulled pork, borracho beans, collard greens, fried chicken, hush puppies, and biscuits. Just the essential BBQ eats.  Sweet & Light is the dessert station. But like the name suggests, the desserts (cookies, cakes, ice cream, bread putting) aren't too rich and indulgent. They have special desserts like eclairs, cream puffs, cobblers and fruit tarts too. Ice cream was okay and the flavors weren't super extraordinary. Just basic flavors like vanilla, chocolate, coffee, pistachio, caramel, but also spumoni and stracciatella. They offer sugar-free flavors too and you can make an ice cream sandwich. I got a cup of the pistachio and the flavor tasted so artificial and sugary.  There was a variety of sushi (the basic California rolls, etc.) at Revival (vegetarian) and also at World Pan but they were terrible. The rice was not soft enough, like it was either not fresh or just cooked wrong. And so it doesn't possess that melt-in-your-mouth quality. I would skip it. Most of the stuff from Smoke & Fire are pretty good, especially the pulled pork. Hands down, the best dish they have is the Chicken Pot Pie. The pie crust is perfect -- the right balance between flaky and buttery. And the filling was deliciously creamy and flavorful.   TL;DR: newly revamped and renovated space, diverse food selection with some standouts (Chicken Pot Pie), lower than average Vegas prices with minimal wait.",

This time, I decided to venture out of my bubble and try a new spot. I came across AYCE on yelp, and we just had to see what everyone was talking about. With it off the strip, you're going to need to take a cab, Lyft, or drive out there.   When you get to the Palms, don't go straight to the buffet! Instead, pop over to their players card desk to sign up. You'll get $5 off your buffet! Not everyone needs to sign up in your party. The card works for 2 discounted buffets. The wait for the buffet was not long at all. We waited about 15 minutes on a Sunday afternoon. For $24, the quality was great! The selection was plentiful and there was even a vegetarian section. My favorite was the honey walnut shrimp. I probably had 2 full plates just of it!   I'd highly recommend AYCE not just for the price, but for the quality as well!",

Our group went to Saturday brunch and we paid 19.99 for brunch on top of bottomless mimosas (with having a preferred stations card) and with our large party, were able to be seated as soon as we paid.   The options of food are plentiful! There were breakfast options as well as brunch and lunch, the brunch options were delicious! There were different hashes, Benedicts and all were extremely tasty, and not old tasting like some buffets often do.   Only thing that I wasn't too fond of was that the server who would fill our mimosas disappeared towards the end of our meal and we weren't able to get the last few mimosas we wanted out of the meal.   This place gave the best bang for your buck when f comes to brunch buffets. Great food, bottomless mimosas and because it's at the palms it gives you a fancy feel. Loved ending it with the vanilla bean ice cream!",

They must have been understaffed or something, those higher level helped to bus and set the tables up. Got drinks ready, picked up dirty places. Kuddos Maybe they should consider hiring busser instead of having the server to bus their own tables(taking up too much time/less time serving)  The potpies are just yummy!!!

    "text": "Standard buffet in Las Vegas. Definitely for the price, I'd say it's good. I went with my friend on a Sunday morning so around $17.99 / person plus all you can drink orange champagne (mimosa?).  We originally went because we thought they had ayce macaroons (from what we saw in previous pictures), but they must change out their desserts from time to time. They had ayce cupcakes this time around.  Their carving station with turkey, ham, and beef was great, and they had a good variety of Chinese, Mexican, breakfast, salad, and dessert. I loved the beef brisket, fried chicken, egg roll, cinnamon bread pudding, and fudge brownie.  Service was great! Very kind waiters and kitchen staff. Shout out to the ice cream girl who was patient when teaching me how to say Stratacelli!",

    "text": "This buffet has taken the buffet standard to a new underwhelming low. The selections are uber confusing to the point where you're lost in food translation. Their stations don't go by the typical buffet naming scheme, like Asian, American and International Flavors, their naming scheme goes like  \"The Revival\" and \"Hearth\". The only saving grace for their buffet is the carving stations and pizza. I personally prefer Bristo Buffet over this underwhelming reimagining.   Their food selections aren't really great, to begin with, it's very limited and subpar, compared to other cheap buffets that I've eaten at. I expected that the food quality would be better, as I was told by a customer service telephone operator a couple of days prior to going to A.Y.C.E. Buffet, however, I've expected wrong. Bistro Buffet had the essential buffet favorites that it needed, such as typical Asian cuisine dishes, Fried Rice and Chow Mein, which is a staple for all casino buffets. I found myself a couple of times, moving back and forth by the buffet line, wondering what am I going to plate and bring to my table to eat. Yes, you can call me a slight picky eater, but looking at the selection presented to me, can you blame me?  My other issue is the Cashiers and Ushers, my mom and I stood in line on our first day there, along with other patrons for almost an hour, before we got to the cashiers. What I'm trying to allude to is that the Cashiers and Ushers are slow to allow the line to progress forward. I saw cashiers, just stand around and/ or count their day's take in the register drawer, when they should focus on getting patrons through the line and seated. I've seen many people who were a few minutes before my us, not stay to eat, they've left and requested their refunds. It's not worth $12.00 plus taxes to eat at a place that doesn't provide a variety of food selections, especially when the selections are confusing or unlabeled.  Palms Resort and Casino is a member of the Station Casino family, they should have built a buffet that matches the successful buffets of such hotels like Green Valley and Red Rock Resorts. Management of the Palms should have studied what makes Feast Buffets so successful and they should have emulated it with their buffet. I understand that Palms wants to set themselves apart from their sister hotels, by providing an alternative, but let's be real here for a second, has their previous buffet proven itself to be a success?..... Maybe, when they were an independently owned entity, however, today they aren't. Bistro Buffet wasn't a huge success, but it was the Palms buffet for many years, despite the ever-changing times and trends.   The reason that Bistro Buffet stayed as the Palms chosen buffet is that it provided its hungry patrons the familiar buffet favorites and it didn't confuse them with eclectic station names. It was easy to understand where to go if you wanted a certain dish or cuisine, if you wanted Asian dishes, you go to the Asian station, if you wanted American, you go to American and so forth. I have a feeling that A.Y.C.E. Buffet won't be a successful hit with its current confusing and limited food selection. The Palms should rethink how they do buffets and change how A.Y.C.E. Buffet works. If they're going with the theme of \"All You Can Eat\", the food should reflect that, with their limited and portioned out selections, it defeats the purpose of the theme of \"All You Can Eat\".  As the buffet was transitioning from lunch to dinner, there wasn't anybody standing in line to wait for dinner at A.Y.C.E. Buffet, it was their second day since they opened. I understand that the line will slowly form, but normally at a buffet like Feast or MGM Buffets, as they transition inside, there is already a line forming outside. The line should have started to form a half an hour to 45 minutes prior to opening for the next meal time. A.Y.C.E. Buffet is going to see empty lines happen, if they continue to operate like this. If they don't want to see empty lines outside their buffet and survive, they should change how they do buffets.  I personally don't and won't recommend any of my family and friends to eat here. Like how I said earlier, it's not worth $12.00 per person (if you have a station casino players card) $14.00 per person (without the station players card). It's better to go to the Red Rock and eat there, because it's a \"Feast\" style of buffet, a True \"All You Can Eat\" buffet. Yes, it's a bit of a drive if you don't live near the Red Rock and it's a bit pricey, however, it's all worth it in the end, you'll end up leaving with a highly filled and satisfied stomach. Knowing that you've truly had a True All-You-Can-Eat experience at the Feast Buffet.  I know that the Palms is trying to cater to a certain demographic, but that's not what they should do, they should cater to every demographic. Which A.Y.C.E. Buffet doesn't do, unfortunately, with their eclectic and limited food selections.",

    "text": "In a word.... AWFUL. First we arrived at about 2pm it was not busy yet we waited to be seated nearly 15 minutes. Now I could understand the wait of they were not fully staffed or if they were busy but neither was the case.  So now lest talk about the food, or should I say the lack of food. First the food had ZERO flavor, the mac and cheese was like eating pasta in cheese water, the pot pie was loose cream with a mushy crust, and when you describe an item as being pepperd you should put pepper on it. Over all food was just bland and bad. Also It seemed that every station had the same items. There was pork, turkey and sushi on every station. A buffet should have a variety and preparing the same item in slightly different ways is not variation. And all the food they picture or show in their commercials is not there. No ribs, no smoke sauage, nothing.  Another big issue was the lack of cooks at any of the stations. We stood at the carving window waiting, and waiting for someone to assist us and nothing. We had to send a busser in back to get a cook to come out. Also when there were empty items I had asked a cook for more tortillas and he said \"yeah ok\" and NEVER brought them back. I must also mention the dessert station that was again unmanned. We waited along with other guests for over 10 minutes, we asked numerous times if there was someone working here and was told \"I will go get someone\" and that never happened.  I finally complained to the manager and the chef and was actually told I was the third complainant of the day about the exact same issues.  So they are aware of the problems and yet they continue.  So overall dont waste your time or your money.",

The prime rib also very tender and not as fatty as most in town. The deserts were delicious including  the large selection of ice cream.

I usually don't go buffet very often, the only buffet  I went to recrntly was M hotel, about half month ago, compared to M hotel, the selection was half , the food quality was so so, the roast beef should be the best, but the walnuts shirmp which was a side was  the best to me. Besides that one , everything else is just ok, some of them were below my average expectations. I also watched the video \" all you can Vegas\" before, but there was indeed fewer choices than the video showed. Only the dessert meet.  The service were  nice, the people were friendly. Overall, I won't go there again even though the price is cheap. If you just want to eat and finish fast them go somewhere else , it may be a good choice.",

    "text": "On Feb 26 2018 Kei or Kai a manager there (don't know the correct spelling of her name) discriminated against me by not accommodating my disability.   I am supposed to be allowed to use the Chairman  line which moves much faster as it serves disabled guests as well ,however she denied me that right and said that I did not look disabled. I was forced to wait in the regular line and when I asked the cashier to call over the head manager she overheard it and became extremely hostile and sarcastically said again\" I told you you don't look  handicapped\".   Not only did she deny me my right to use a line that's available for disabled people but she discriminated against me because of the way I look, in her mind I did not look disabled. When Edward came over (another manager) to our table I explained to him in detail what happened and he assured me that disabled guests are allowed to use the chairman line as it moves much faster and there is little wait.   When I asked him why I was not allowed to use it and why she denied me that right he said he didn't have an answer and that he would investigate it and he apologized, I also asked him why would she be allowed to say I did not look disabled and I asked him to explain to me what disabled looks like and he said he did not have an answer.   Regardless of his apology I find it extremely inappropriate and unprofessional that she was allowed to stay in the buffet and conduct her routine duties after such an incident. I filled out a report of the incident and as of today I have still not heard anything back from anyone there. The ayce buffet at Palms has conducted itself  in an extremely despicable and vile manner as a business . It is clear that they really do not intend to do anything about the Discrimination when they allowed her to stay there after such an incident.",

We had been planning our food for our weekend getaway for some time and was going to go to Bacchanal, but after reading some recent reviews and not wanting to wait hours on hours to eat for $65 a person, we gave this $20 buffet a try. They let us walk through the buffet before paying and decided to give it a go. The only really disappointing item there were the deserts. My wife LOVES deserts and did not eat most of the items she got after taking a bite. The gelato was good so just stick with that and you will be happy. They have a good selection of foods that are sized right with good flavor. Our favorite foods were the Asian inspired items with the chicken wings being some of the best we have ever had. They also had walnut shrimp and a beef based item that was really flavorful. The service was really attentive and made the whole experience great. A great place to eat for sure!",

To me, the quality still doesn't compare to WS. The A.Y.C.E. Buffet's similar style to WS by offering small individual servings is a nice feature, but taste and quality of the food is key.  I'm not a big dessert person, but the dessert section was actually my favorite station. Their meat station was mediocre. Their beef selection was just roast beef, not even prime rib. The pork loin however was perfectly tender and moist. A lot of their entrees were dry and over cooked.   I guess overall the price for the buffet is by far a lot less compared to the larger Strip buffet restaurants. The server we had, Marilyn was the best thing from our first experience here at A.Y.C.E. Buffet. Her attention and constant clearing of our used dishes was very much appreciated. Her attention to refilling our beverages and her willingness to go above and beyond made our visit a pleasant one.   I think my 3 star rating is appropriate for its not horrible, but just average.",

We came in to town again to use it and they told us sense it was a holiday we could not use the voucher (cinco de mayo) so we left, we've traveled to go to the palms. later that day i called and asked to talk to a supervisor. When Mary came to the phone I asked her if cinco de mayo was a holiday and she said no! so i told her we had been turned away that day. She was so professional. she offered myself and husband a complementary buffet. So we came back she kept her word and we had a great buffet. food was delicious and service very favorable. and i'm not easy to please. Thank-you Mary and staff",

As I was looking for food that I could eat, most contained the things that I am allergic to.  I asked MICHAEL SOMMERS if there was anything that did not have black pepper or tomatoes in it.  Then MICHAEL SOMMERS a sous chef had ADRIANE MORA walk me through the entire buffet and tell me what was in the food.  After finding out that most of the foods were seasoned with black pepper, SOMMERS offered and proceeded to make me a fresh plate of food that I was able to enjoy.  This brought me to tears because of his concern, attentiveness and willingness to go above and beyond his duties, I was able to enjoy a meal with my family.  I want to thank SOMMERS and MORA for ensuring that every time I come to A.Y.C.E. I can seek them out and they will make sure that I am expertly taken care of.  I recommend the A.Y.C.E. to everyone living in Las Vegas and visiting here!  THANK YOU AGAIN.",

Since the buffet has less selection compare to other buffers in Vegas already. Breakfast is even less. My favorite would be their corn with hot chitos. Very clever dish. The fresh cut meat is very dry so I don't recommend it but others are not so bad. If you are coming for a five star meal I wouldn't recommend to come here since the food display is much better than it taste like. Also, do keep in mind that you may have to wait for long time to get seated.",

Turkey legs were cold and dry, asparagus and Brussels sprouts were very uncooked, pulled pork was extremely fatty, roast beef was ok and the helpings for the shrimp cocktails and  crawfish were very very small.  Does the chef taste the food before serving???? Obviously not.    To top that off the salad bar reach was almost impossible to get some of the items I wanted to add to my salad.  If you want to try the soup ( which was good) the way they have it set up makes it very difficult to serve yourself.  Opening the cover to get the soup was a pain.  You think having remodel the place they would make it easy for the customers to get to the selections.     The one thing I liked was the staff.  They were polite and very helpful.   They too were getting ears full of customers complaining.    Too bad... thumbs down for the Palms Buffett.   Not ever returning.   :(",

    "text": "We went for brunch buffet Sunday morning at 9 AM. We were staying at the hotel. Sunday morning buffet, as it is automatically brunch, is more expensive than normal buffet breakfast. Instead of roughly 9 dollars per person, it is a little over $23 per person. Includes bottomless Mimosa or champagne, which are OK, yet to get your moneys worth, you need to be a drinker or just not worth it. The food was average to a few items below average. Nothing was memorable and there is nothing I would want to try again. It is probably one of the lower end quality buffets that I have been to in Las Vegas. I am comparing it to higher end hotels though. We felt that because we had a two for one buffet certificate, it was OK. We would not have been happy had we had to pay the full price per person, because it simply isn't worth that much. Getting there at 9 AM on Sunday was perfect for us because there was no line. When we left around 10:30 AM, having taken our time, the line was very long to get into the buffet. Otherwise, it was just OK. I will say that it is an upgrade from the old buffet when it was under different hotel management. Therefore, it has improved, yet very average.",

Everyone, if possible, ask for Wendy to be your server/waitress! She is fantastic! I believe she must be a coach to all the servers  if she isn't, she MUST be made ASAP! Quick at refilling your drink, take plates away, on top of it all! She would refer us certain combinations with food! Thank you Wendy for your great service!",

I love the fact that much of the food is already set out as a serving size, rather than just a free-for-all, grab-as-much-as-you-can. The mini buckets of shrimp and seafood boil were awesome. The mini-tureens of French onion soup and individual plates of blue-cheese wedge salad are ingenious! The variety of foods is ample, and the dessert bar is better than most (the macaroons are awesome). If you like smoky BBQ, you'll really enjoy the beef brisket. They even had duck with white beans, which was amazing. It may not be the biggest buffet in town, but they do a great job with what they serve, and for $20 each, I have zero complaints. We will definitely be going again!",

(Price point and quality). I came for a late lunch on a Saturday (around 2pm). The wait was ridiculous and to be honest the food was underwhelming. The lack of selection that some mentioned wasn't a problem for me because I value quality over quantity. Maybe this is good for Vegas price however I found the quality of the food to be no better than your regular run of the meal buffet priced at $9.99. For the type of food selection (fried rice, pasta, roasted veggies, sliders, Mac n cheese etc) there is no reason why the quantity can't be expanded. To add the pace that the bar was being replenished was unacceptable, with such a limited selection the bar needs to be replenished regularly. My husband never got to try the sliders because someone got the last one right when we first began our meal and they weren't replenished until we well through our meal. I can't recommend any other Vegas buffers but to those wanting to experience the Vegas buffet I would urge possibly trying another. While the palms is priced better than other buffets it wasn't worth the wait and the food was not satisfying. It was mediocre at best.",

    "text": "Why not name an All You Can Eat buffet \"A.Y.C.E. Buffet\"? This is the newest buffet in Vegas as they opened their doors on 12/22/17. It's located in the Palms Casino Resort. Price of buffet depends on your player card status. $2 off if you're minimum Good Card status. Alcoholic drinks are an extra charge. Juice, soft drinks and coffee is included. We came here for breakfast so the buffet was only $10.99/person. Lunch is $13.99/person and dinner is $19.99/person.   There are many stations that you pick food from. When you are walked over to your table, a server comes up to take your drink orders. They came around several times to refill the drinks for us and clear out empty or finished plates. Excellent customer service for a buffet. The miso soup, hash browns, country fried steak, sausage, ham and OJ were good. Pulp was in the OJ which was nice. I was definitely not a fan of their pot stickers. Only Asian item I enjoyed was the miso soup. There was also an omelette station which was very popular.",

When they redesigned this place they had the opportunity to close the restaurant off from the casino and the toxic cigarette smoke. When will the casinos learn that the majority of us not only do not smoke, but find being around it abhorrent. Don't believe me? I've been twice. Both times I had to wait for a seat away from the smoke. That means that area away from the smoke was full. This was a real opportunity lost. All of that being said, the food was very good.

The service was great, also rare at a buffet.  The buffet was clean with plenty of staff to stay on top of keep it tidy.  If you can manage enough space for dessert there were plenty of options and lots of mini desserts so you can try a variety of things.

As soon as I was seated, I was greeted by my server and she soon had my iced tea at the table.  I then took the time to walk the length of the areas to see what they were serving.  They have gone to the pre-sized portions with some dishes.  I'm sure this helps cut down on waste because you're taking a small dish or bowl with a limited amount of food.  I passed on some pasta because it looked dry from sitting under the lamps for a while.  I was drawn by their flaming elotes (they weren't very hot) so it was a bit disappointing.  I also had a small shrimp cocktail in a miniature bucket.  Not bad at all.  For dessert, I had some macarons--they have it spelled wrong--a miniature eclair.  I passed on getting a handmade ice cream cookie sandwich because I was full by then.  It seems like a busy night would be the best time to be here as the food would turnover faster instead of sitting under lamps.  The staff was excellent.",

    "text": "The price and overall experience are what a buffet should have locked in, and this place has it done right.  A lot of the local legends and the strip's famous buffet joints as of late have all taken a dive in recent years.   The kings nowadays are the M's Studio Buffet and Bacchanal.  At least in my opinion.   In comparison to both strip and local AYCEs, I'd have to say that this place of business holds it's own well enough.  Food's aight but the service on my first visit was awesome.  I had an issue earlier regarding my status on the card and the price, yet they fixed it very quickly and without rudeness.  Kudos to Nicole and the manager on duty, Facia L. for their service!  They deserve recognition for being amiable and professional!  Pricing is within the $10-$20 marks during lunch and is way cheaper than the Wicked Spoon at Cosmo, BUFFET at Bellagio, and Bacchanal at Caesar's Palace.  If you hold a Preferred card you get a slight discount, and Gold and above is even more of one.  Parking, for now, is still free at the Palms and isn't small and crowded, narrow and claustrophobic, but it's not huge and confusing.  So don't worry about finding places to store your car both inside and outside the garage.  The line is easy to navigate and moves fairly quickly.  You may have younger inexperienced employees, but they get through your orders quick and the managers are always roaming about helping guests with more complicated issues.  Seating was surprisingly cool.  The seats were comfortable, while the tables, carpet, lighting, atmosphere, colors, and spacing were all well planned out and seemingly fancy but without being bougie.  Endless mimosas during brunch, and you can add the liquor package anytime for a bit more for lunch and dinner.  It's not empty nor crowded so that's a plus for me.  Meat and cheese dishes I can't really vouch for, however, they did look fancier then delicious so I won't be reviewing anything.  The cauliflower they serve has a decent sauce, but I personally prefer a creamier sauce with more spice.  Most of my friends who ate the meat and cheese dishes say that the food items were much more delicious than local joints but just shy of comparing to the expensive strip buffet's similar dishes.  Some of the veggie dishes need more items along with some juices or smoothies.  Restrooms in comparison to the older palms previous set up are cleaner, and roomy.  I like the lighting and the particular urinals they chose.  Being a local I can say that I'd come back every now and then especially since I gamble here and can benefit from the discounts and points from dining in-house.  I'll critique more on the food later on more visits because I primarily eat Vegan and won't have the first-hand experience with current meat or cheese items, but for now, I'd recommend anybody to at least try this buffet once!  Also, I just wanted the two mentioned above recognized!",

I opted for AYCE since I don't eat much and I didn't want a spend a crap ton on a buffet that I know will not be worth it to me. I also don't care much about seafood at a buffet so I thought AYCE was perfect for me! I went during lunch time and you pay before you enter the buffet and you wait in line until a host is ready for you to get on a table...the set up is kind of weird in my opinion.  There was really nothing special about this buffet...you could make your own pasta, there was elotes that I was excited about but they were really nothing special, there were sliders and \"dim sum\"... I would've rather went to Soup Plantation.  A beverage is included with the price you pay and parking is free so I guess that's a plus.",

We walked by this place while going around the casino. We stayed in the Palms Place so we were really close to here. An Uber driver recommended this place to us. And, based on my experience, when a local Uber driver recommends a place, you at least check it out.  The staff were super friendly and let us do a quick walk around before purchasing a buffet. We looked, we smelled, we got in line.  We stayed for the breakfast buffet, so I can only speak about that, but for about $10ish dollars a person, we couldn't believe that the food could be that good. I'm so glad we were wrong.  I usually think of buffets as \"a bunch of average food that makes up for the average taste with the overwhelmingly quantity\". This one, however, has a huge variety AND tastes great AND is super affordable. Seriously, this may be the best breakfast buffet I've ever had.  Overall, because of the clean environment, classy decor, tasty food, wide variety of food, friendly staff, & extremely affordable price, I'd say it's worth a shot.   Honestly, I wouldn't be surprised if their prices go up soon. This is easily a $30-40/person buffet at a $10ish price.   The only question I have for you now is: Will you be able to try all the foods you want to try here before you get full?   I almost did. Almost.",

Buffet is way way better. I think it's even cheaper when using the player's card. They were about $20 for dinner.  Where do I start!? How about the last thing I had!? The desserts. They actually have a nice selection of some really good desserts. I probably had one of everything at least once. The Creme Brulee they served was the best I've had in a while. The custard mixture was rich and very tasty. It tasted like more egg yolks were used which I preferred. The chocolate mousse cake was also delicious. I had like 5 of them. They're small pieces. There's gelato, macarons, cookies, sugar-free things, and more.   I honestly ate a little of almost everything except whatever was in the station on the far left.  I'll just mention a few of the items I really enjoyed. Everything in the salad area especially wedge salad. The chicken pot pie, turkey legs, BBQ briskets and rib, kalbi, corn on the cob, pizza, duck, mussels, salmon, walnut shrimp, and everything else. I was easily there for a few hours.  I did like how there were a lot of dishes served in small plates or containers. They're nice to have because it keeps dishes separate from other dishes.   The only knock on them is there wasn't a made to order pasta station or crab legs but I'd definitely be back.",

    "text": "**BRUNCH REVIEW** 3.5 STARS  New buffet? New buffet with a location close enough to the strip for some fun, but off the strip so you don't deal with parking?! YASSS.   Okay, so a group of 4 of us decided to try Sunday Brunch here during MLK weekend around 12pm. Needless to say, it was a LONG 1hr+ wait, but we made it with a hungry appetite!   Food selection: 4 stars. Brunch had a LOT of breakfast options, eggs a bunch of different ways, bacon in two areas, biscuits and gravy, French toast, pancakes, sausage, toast, LOX AND BAGELS, prime rib, brisket, etc. They also have a lot of lunch items such as the Asian food, international areas, salad area, small bites on individual plates, etc. Everything was pretty good, but nothing was very over the top that I can remember wanting to go back for. My cousin went to the Omelet Bar which was probably the highlight for brunch!  OH AND YEA UNLIMITIED MIMOSAS FTW!  (BUT FYI, not consistent. Some batches had a lot of juice, other had barely any...at one point I figured I should just get champagne and order a juice to make it myself LOL)   Size: 3.5 stars- the ads make this place seem huge and exciting, as if it were another bacchanal. This is not the case. The place was big, yes, and there were \"stations\", but It really is just an upgraded version of a station casino. It has the same set up, but obviously a little newer and classier.   Wait: 3 stars. It just opened AND we went for brunch, but waited about an hour or more to be seated.   Service: 4 stars Our mimosas were constantly filled and our plates were taken fairly often. Nothing amazing, but they do their job well and kept us satisfied :)   SUMMED UP:  For the amount of time I spent in line, the price and the food selection, I probably would give this place 3.5 stars, the 4 is for me hoping to come back for lunch or dinner to try.  We paid 19.99 for brunch with our red players card **You only get the larger discount with higher up cards**  The food was good, but not amazing. Some foods were definitely picturesque (individual small plates in lieu of scooping on your own), but nothing wowed me in terms of taste/flavor. The wait was fairly long, but for brunch I really shouldn't complain much. The area was pretty, but seemed like a nicer version of station casinos....where I can brunch for about $11 rather than $20.  I'd like to come back and try the regular dinner and lunch foods. I feel those would be a better deal :)",

The food was also very good, especially for the price. We will definitely be coming back again. Now if Red Rock Casino can step up their buffet game, we'd love to see that considering we live in Summerlin.",

    "text": "I've seen the commercials that show this beautiful buffet and new foods and to come on in and try it. Well I did and I took the biggest critic I know, my mom. Well I have to say my mother remembered the old Palms with the small buffet and she said it was not the best. First I tried the Asian food station I must say that the rice was a little off it wasn't that great. Then we tried The Carving Station and the beef was really good. We stumbled upon the fried chicken wings and I have to say they were perfectly seasoned and little spicy and so delicious! Every vegetable dish we tried was delicious the vegetables were crisp and fresh. The mashed potatoes were really good. Now I must tell you the best thing there... they have a smoke station with ribs that are delicious and also you can find wonderful brisket that is both more moist and cooked to perfection. Wholesale treat yourself to fried turkey wings oh my goodness. Now the desserts to me were not good the ice creams were crystalled but the white chocolate covered strawberries were the bomb. We did go on a Sunday so we were able to have the champagne brunch; we got there around 3 and stayed till about 5 pm... just eating everything that we could. If you are new to Las Vegas or if you have been here for a while, you know that buffets in the past used to be really really good now most of them really suck. This Buffet to me compares to The Cosmopolitan here in the Vegas area however they do not carry the Cosmopolitan prices.  Mom and I will try to get to this place as often as we can because we really really really enjoyed it. Well priced $18 per dinner buffet! The staff and manager (who is expecting) delivered excellent customer service!",

As I am handicapped, our line the wait with 4 people ahead of us took over 15 minutes. The other line could take about an hour.  Once we were seated, up to see the offerings.  I will say almost everything we tasted was either luke warm or cold.  The elote was good, but cold.  The sliders were sitting way too long, buns dried out.  That went to trash, but then they put a new tray our.  It lacked seasoning, no taste at all.  There was no ribs or brisket at lunch.  Just chicken or pulled pork. Overall, I would prefer Green Valley Ranch over AYCE.",

Pros:   lots of vegetarian choices.   some interesting selections like Moroccan lamb - but no pilaf or couscous - and dragonfruit lasagne.   bight, clean & a fair amount of staff.   dessert bar will make you custom ice cream sandwiches using cookies & a very good selection of made on site, ice cream.   pulled pork  mexican street corn  Cons:   very confusing lines to cashier  rude front of house staff - cashier & hostess. We stood for almost 20 minutes for them to decide which side our party of 4 would be seated at. 5pm on a Friday night when most parties are 4+   no where to sit while waiting for the rest of the party.   Selection of food was meh. Typical carving stations, nothing really that stood out. I realize they are only open 1 month but honestly, I thought Station Casinos would have this  down by now  they served a Bloody Mary in a CAN & we had to ask for a glass cuz Im \"classy\"   food labels were unclear.  I used my Station card but for 2 of us it was $44something. Obviously not that great of a discount if its 19.99 w/o the card. & the cashier with her rude self, walked away when I asked her.   We might go back in a few months, once the casino reconstruction is finished.   Fat girl seating: 5 Large spacious tables & armless chairs.",

It all started with your grill station when we noticed there was no meat as my daughter was here from school beak from Indiana, we asked Robert about if there was any type of meat anywhere that my daughter can have and he told us that after 4pm there will be much more displayed and if we could wait a little . All of of a sudden Robert along with Adrian the asst room chef got a piece of grilled meat for my daughter, I did not expect that and I thank them very much . I know that it's a stevenBarr crew and they have been trained the right way to help the clients . I really would like to give them a five star because they went out their way to please their guests . Thank you very much I will always be a loyal client of the palms  Also from the cashier to the hostess to the server and management great job",

The ribs and roasted turkey was excellent.  We went a little late at 7:30 or 8:00 and some of the food didn't seem fresh.  It was also during the week, maybe it's better on the weekend.  another problem is it's open to the casino and the smoke from the casino was pretty bad.  The palms does not have a good filtering system. The staff was very nice and welcoming.",

    "text": "Stayed at the Palms this past week so I was fortunate enough to have easy access to this affordable buffet. We ended up eating here for breakfast 3 mornings and were told we could add bottomless mimosas for $10 the last 2 days which we definitely indulged in! Honestly for the price this buffet was pretty good and you'd really have to be an extremely picky eater to not find anything you like here. I think they offered a good variety of things, but of course there are some hits and misses as not everything tastes as good as it looks and some things were warm almost cold vs hot. My biggest complaint is that the menu seems to be literally the same every day or it was at the least the 3 mornings we went which is why we did not go again for the remainder of 3 days we were there. Besides that I definitely recommend if you're staying in the Palms and maybee if you're nearby and just really want a buffet or bottomless experience but I wouldn't go out of my way to come here.",

With being a highly recommended buffet, I was excited to try something new however I really would like recommend coming here. Our server however I would give a 5 star. He kept the mimosas coming, and at one point was serving us just champagne (which I was not complaining). He was very friendly and ensured our table was clear at all times however no matter the amount of alcohol, the food was still not impressive. I wish I saw a glimmer of hope and was willing to give this place another chance but I did not.

    "text": "I am torn with this New Buffet (fully remodeled room and food stations) Did you know the Palm Casino is now a Station Casino? I didn't know... Yesterday night they had macarons!!!  A.Y.C.E. buffet reminds me of the one in Red Rock Hotel, just smaller. They opened end of december of 2017 so not long ago. You would expect the food quality to be outstanding for at least 6 months (right?) Also Salad's lover, A.y.c.e. doesn't offer a large salad bar selection as Red Rock Casino... Before I talk about my experience let say that when you pay less than$20 for dinner you should not complain right?  Let's be fair and honest, it's was good. Also go sign up for a Casino Players card (takes 2mns) it gives you some discount when you pay :) Choice is decent, what bothered me was that individual serving were close to cold, and stations were not filled appropriately for dinner rush I read some many people writing about the macarons they saw on TV ads and not at the buffet... i might be lucky... it was plenty of them at the dessert station hehehe! The host took us to our table. Nice and friendly. Our waiter offered us great service.   most of their dishes are displayed in individual portion. which is smart, less waste! Frenchy clin d'il with some traditional french dish like Coq au Vin, Cassoulet a la cuisse de canard, soupe a l oignon :) The soupe a l oignon was delicious, enjoyed the melted cheese! The cassoulet was alright, i believe it was displayed for some time, the canard/duck was dry and cold :( the beans were almost perfect The coq au vin was delicious and tasty! translated in english is like Roaster cooked in wine. picked a salmon poke. The rice was hard :(   the funny part is when I look at the salad bar. They offer individual portions of shrimp cocktail, ceviche (lemon doesn't look fresh, it's dried :(() Like i said compare to the Red Rock salad bar... the bar did not offer many choices. so here is the funny.. couple clients were looking for butter... nowhere to be found by the sliced bread. A man was feeling his bowl of \"mozzarella mini balls\" till the station attendant said \"Sir, are you a butter lover?\" it was hilarious, I was giggling so hard !!!  so the butter is rolled into small balls like mozzarella ... and placed next to each other... so don't get tricked ah ah ah Pizza/Italian station offers pizza, pasta, calzone pizza... Dessert station is small but offers good variety of ice cream and pastries.  Like the macarons and the vanilla puffs!",

Not much choice of food. When they cut you the prime rib, they cut a really really thin slice only. Only 3 kind of fruit to choose, 2 soups and the chicken noodle soup is bitter because of the celery(I think) and salty. For sushi, only have rolls which the rice is hard and the sushi is warm, only 4 kinds of roll to choose from, no sashimi or nigiri. I got a plate of shells put it on the table and then go get food with my little one, when I came back to the table the server took my plate of food that I didn't even have a chance to eat.",

For starters, they have pressed mango juice with chia seeds and gluten free pancakes as part of their healthy choices.  Omelette station and regular pancakes, carved ham and two types of eggs benedict (go for the brisket one).  This was definitely pleasing and the things that they had there makes me want to go there again the next time I visit.  There were no overdried foods.  Desserts were mainly breakfast pastries and ice cream, but when transitioning over to lunch, they've got tiramisu and some other fine desserts.  TBH, I got more excited for this breakfast buffet and got more satisfaction than I did for the Bacchanal.  Maybe it was the price, maybe the quality, maybe both.  Bravo, Palms!",

After waiting for 20-30 minutes, they instructed a few of us into a different line.  Meanwhile, they let everyone that was behind us, to be seated first.  Therefore the people behind us only had to wait approximately 10 minutes vs our 30 minutes.  As soon as I pointed it out, they opened up the flood gates and began seating my neglected group at a quick and frantic pace, like a jail break out. I stated \"Wow you have a bunch of tables open now!  Where were these tables 10 minutes ago?\"  Sometimes you have to get up, stand up, stand up for your rights.  Get up, stand up, don't give up the fight. Soon, the quality will go down hill.  The tender ribs and brisket will blossom into a fond remembrance, when visiting Memory Lane.

We were there last Friday, for the first time, and waited for over an hour in line just to be seated (and the line was not even long when we got in it)! The cashier said that the wait was due to busy tables but so many tables were empty in clear view from where we were standing in the line. Meanwhile, there were about 3-4 girls at a time just standing by the register... One ringing people up, the others just chatting to each other while \"holding the line.\" If the few waiters on the floor were busy, why didn't these girls help with clearing tables, refilling drinks to move things along? Anyway, once we were finally seated, our waitress was kind, but messed up our original drink order and then didn't even come by to refill our drinks until we had already been seated for about an hour. Because the food was really good, I'd consider going there again IF THE LINE IS MOVING AT A REASONABLE PACE.",

They clean your plates in a timely fashion compared to the studio B or other station casinos. The smoke and fire section has really good ribs But the brisket was nothing to write home about.  Shrimp cocktail, other shrimp dishes, the seafood boil, and some others I can't think of right now were really good.  Duck was extremely dry.  The desserts were amazing and the poke was different than any I ever had but still good.  Overall solid for 18 a person on a Saturday night.",

    "text": "Sorry, Guys, but this buffet isn't worth the time and money.  Dinner was $21.99 with a players card.  We went two weeks ago on a Tuesday evening arriving about 6:30 p.m.  We waited almost 1-1/2 hours to get in...but the kicker is, there were at least six ready-and-waiting tables that were empty plus a high-table with about 10 seats that were totally empty.  We were escorted to the furthest section against the wall.  There was a table for four next to us that was empty the whole time until a few minutes before we left.  We had to ask the waitstaff for spoons, salt, pepper, and refills on our drinks.  She told us that the table wasn't fully set-up because that section was closed off until a short while before we arrived.  What???  Closed???  We waited for almost 1-1/2 hours to be seated.  Why was it closed?  The food was just OK, but we even had to ask for items to be refilled at the salad bar.  The buffet at Gold Coast is right across the street and even though it's not as \"fancy\" the food is better at almost half the price.  When we left at about 8:45 p.m. there were still people in line and we counted eight empty tables on the side we sat at.  Thanks but NO thanks.  We won't be going back.  I guess they spent a LOT of money remodeling but forgot to hire more people and train them to make for a good meal!!  Almost forgot....the music was awful and too, too loud.",

The food selection had to be one of the best I've seen in buffets and the quality of the food was real delightful. Our server was Rhonda and she was such a blast! She has such a genuine customer service attitude and it was very refreshing. I appreciate her especially because I wanted a raspberry lemonade and instead of giving the run around (like every other place I've gone to) she quickly and kindly told me \"I can make one for you.\" Though it may not seem like much, it was amazing to me. She's a great server!  Unfortunately we were on our way out (as in going back home) after we ate so we didn't get a chance to see much more of the hotel. We heard great reviews of the buffet so we had to see for ourselves before we left and i'm glad we did. The organization of the food selections flowed so well that it was unlikely to bump into people, unless you're super clumsy lol.  Overall we loved this buffet.  Would like to try the brunch here, but that will have to be for our next trip of course",

    "text": "Pro tip: They have Coke Zero!!!    I've been here several times for lunch and dinner.  And once for Sunday brunch.  I wasn't impressed by the Sunday brunch.  Just seemed like an expensive everyday lunch.  That said, I do enjoy coming here for lunch and dinner.  The main reason I come during lunch is to eat their chicken pot pie.  Those little things are delicious!!  But they tend to run out quickly on those.  There is an entire section devoted to vegan/vegetarian items.  I tried and enjoyed a few of the items there.  There is an Asian section and the salt & pepper chicken wings are super tasty!!  Not to mention their mini-poke bowls.  It is pretty much a small ball of poke on top of sushi rice.  I eat at least 10 of these things everytime.  Honey walnut shrimp is pretty tasty.  There is a DIY soba noodle station, but I'm too lazy to make myself one.  The carving station has several different types of meat as well as a roasted cauliflower that they serve as \"steaks.\"  The curry mussels and crawfish boil are amazing!!  They also have a Moroccan style lamb that is pretty tasty.  There is a BBQ section that has smoked turkey legs!!  I closed my eyes and I was transported back to Disneyland.  They have a grilled calamari that is simply devine!!  The calamari has that  nice grilled char and they are oh so tender!!  I have no idea how they get them to be so tender, they super good.  There is a good soup and salad bar, my favorite items there are the shrimp cocktail and wedge salad.  I don't know why, but I am addicted to their wedge salad.  Bleu cheese, real bacon bits, and dressing.  I have jumbled lunch and dinner items.  I have a hard time keeping track of what items are served at lunch or dinner, since we usually come during lunch and stay through dinner (yup, we are pigs!!).  Only for sure thing is the chicken pot pie is lunch only.  If you've ever been curious, give A.Y.C.E. a try.  You won't be disappointed.",

We had never visited this buffet prior to the renovation so I can't offer a comparison but I will say i found it quite satisfying.  We got here around 10 am for Sunday brunch and the wait was not too bad. I really liked the decor and cleanliness of this buffet right from the start.  The staff was really attentive and nice and informed us that our brunch included bottomless mimosas yippeee!     I found that the offerings weren't overwhelmingly endless like in other buffets but the flavor of everything I tried was on point and some of the options were also served individually which I enjoyed.    The dessert was lacking a bit of creativity and not the most memorable part of this experience so definitely could use some help in this area.   I would definitely like to come back to compare dinner offerings but overall this was very enjoyable.",

The selection here was terrible (they had a quite a bit, but most of it was kind of eccentric.  Not much in terms of just regular food.  Most of the meat we got was tough, the sides, vegetables, etc., were like warm or cold, as if the burners were off.  The stations weren't manned.  We had to look for someone at both carving stations, and the pasta station was unmanned the entire time we were there. Things were mislabeled (see pic.. the Brussel sprouts look suspiciously like broccoli), and the desserts were tasteless.  Other people were complaining while we were there, too.  Definitely needs some food and employee management upgrades.",

From parking to even the simple process of waiting in line to pay/enter you are treated like a second class citizen here.  80% of the parking spaces are reserved for \"VIP\"  (individuals who've lost 5 figures + gambling).  Then when you arrive at the buffet, there are two separate lines, one for \"VIP\" and one for the simple \"common folk\".  The attendees wave in the \"VIP\" while you are made to wait in a never ending line.  We arrived at 6 pm and were told the wait is approx 3 hours!  The buffet closes at 9pm.  Is this a joke?",

It offers a plethora of great options like other buffets at higher prices.  The Asian/Italian/Mexican/Seafood/American food sections are on par with other buffets in Las Vegas.  It's price after you get the \"Boarding Pass\" is very reasonable - at the base level a dinner goes from 21 to 19 dollars.  It isn't on the status of the Bacchanal buffet, but it is also much more reasonable and family friendly.  I took my son for his birthday and he was quite happy, and he is a finicky eater.  The pasta dishes, the southern food options, and the Asian options were as good as any other restaurant that solely serves those types of dishes.    At the end - the variety, price, and value for a family is amazing for this newer buffet.  I will certainly return to this one.",

Today, I used my points and along with my players card, I didn't have to pay a dollar. This is probably my fourth time this month.   Josefina was my server today. I also spoke with Facia, the manager who was very open and friendly. We discussed desserts and she gave me suggestions that I followed. Cool vibe here and it shows with the food style, which is fresh and vibrant. I hope that they keep this place upbeat and change the menu occasionally. Not that it's bad but I eat here so much, I don't want to get tired of it.   Originally, I gave a 4 star review but this place is consistently good and for a buffet, that's impressive.  Everyone has been very cordial and friendly which is nice. Other buffets can be rude and push people through like cattle. Not here. And, the food is always replaced promptly so rarely is there an empty tray.",

Also, maybe vegan ice cream (there are plenty non dairy options you can find. Almond/soy/coconut milk base, etc) and vegan pasta. They did have zucchini noodles, which I did use as a replacement for the pasta (which had egg in it, I believe) and it was pretty good. I really appreciate the kindness and the service.

The food is unique, delicious, fresh, and the room is sheek and updated.  My ONE concern; is that being an off strip venue, this may not see the foot traffic it deserves to keep the quality this good, for NINE FREAKIN DOLLARS.  Well done Stations brand. I will happily drive out from henderson consistently to eat here. Dinner to come later this week",

They had a whole section that was almost entirely vegan (one dish was just vegetarian) and the head chef even came out and led me around the rest of the stations to point out all the vegan foods. I even had a few special things made just for me! Also some vegan dessert!!! Fantastic service, great food, and will definitely be back!",

Price definitely swaying even the most modest eaters, starting around $8.99 for breakfast and dinner only $17.99 with a players card, it's a steal in comparison to your on strip options at a similar or better quality!  We were coming in at 11am, and therefore some breakfast items had one foot out the door, while new lunch items were showing up on each visit to the line.  A bit exciting to see new variety at each round, although most was due to schedule I am sure.  As with any buffet, you'll likely find many hits and some misses, but my experience leaned towards the former throughout!  Give it a go!",

Usually when a place does remodeling they start putting the price on the patrons and decreasing the food quality I'm always scared and skeptical whenever something is closed for renovations. In this case The upgrade not only brought better food service quality and at the same affordable price, with a players card of course-so you know you need to sign up for it!  Breakfast: $8.99 Lunch: $12.99 Dinner: $17.99  These are prices with the players card you swear I wouldn't know what the regular prices are! Doesn't matter because I'm not willing to spend an extra two dollars more just get the card! :p",

But 2.5 hours of waiting and then charging us an adult price for my 6 year old that doesn't even eat as much as I do was a big damper on my experience. Presentation of food gave them some brownie points. Presentation helps when deciding on what you want to eat. Food itself, was decent. They didn't offer typical buffet foods which makes it interesting for those who like new things or to experiment with different tastes and cuisines. It was definitely an experience and maybe I would come back but not with my little one that gets charged as an adult.",

We paid $13 per person for breakfast on Veteran's day, and there was a surprising variety of foods, from sweet to savory. However, the quality of food was just mediocre.   There were a few mini dishes that had a runny egg, (eggs Benedict, etc), and every one of those eggs were a little too runny. Part of the white was still transparent and jiggly, which wasn't super appetizing.   I also had a mini dish with a small waffle bananas foster, and the waffle was super thick and dry - not super appetizing.   The best part of the buffet was the omelet bar - they use real eggs and it's hot and fresh! Definitely stop by that station.   The breakfast pizza and the desserts were nice too, I especially liked the cookies - they were nice and chewy.   Overall, definitely a \"get what you pay for\" situation, but not bad considering the low price.",

Absolutely the worst buffet in all of vegas . I wish I can rate it a zero out of 5 stars. horrendous. Will not be coming back. A goegoues hotel but disgusting buffet . When you go to a nice hotel , you expect high expectations. McDonald's is better than this buffet .",

To date, the best service I have EVER received at any buffet.  She was attentive without being intrusive.  We never were out of beverage and our plates were removed quickly.  She served with a smile and truly seemed to enjoy her job.  And, the food selections were very, very good.  Very large selection at the buffet and everyone working from servers, to bussers, to hostesses all were smiling and efficient.  I asked to speak to the Assistant Manager on duty (Facia Lewis) to express our gratitude as well.  She too had a great attitude and made us feel like valued clients.  I will come back and suggest this buffet to all my guests throughout the year!  Thanks Rosa and Facia for making our evening!",

I enjoyed the lamb stew. The reason I'm giving them 5 stars is because of our server, Salvador. He was very attentive, silent shy type, not in your face but funny when you talk to him. Every time I asked for something, he'd bring it right away like there's no other customers there even though he has a lot of other ones. He was just as attentive to them. My daughter spilled her drink and he cleaned it within seconds with a smile on his face. He also kept asking if she was ok. My daughter felt bad.  I joined rewards member and got $4 off each for us. I also like that there's a designated line for disabled person. We had my in laws with us who are both in walkers so they told us to skip the line :). Thank you for that!",

The good: Roast Turkey with white gravy was moist and flavorful Roast beef also moist Brisket was juicy but needed the BBQ sauce for flavor Asian Chili Pepper wings yum Nice Gelato and dessert selection  The bad: The pork chops, Korean short ribs, sausage, white rice and chicken marsala were dry  Carvery service at the BBQ was almost always nonexistent Creme Brulee was a hard custard   Station Casino pricing beats most of the other casino pricing.

So we came for Friday night dinner.  Station recently took over the Palms and their renovations immediately focused on the dining options, and this buffet is a huge upgrade from the previous one under Maloof ownership. Space is brighter and more appealing, food is fresher with more variety, and we were pleasantly surprised by the overall increase in quality.  PROS: Several vegetarian and vegan options, including roasted cauliflower steaks at the carving station and jackfruit enchiladas! Their brisket at the BBQ station was on point. Good mix of trendy dishes like Doritos elote and mini poke bowls along with classic buffet staples like prime rib, shrimp cocktail, and a made to order pasta station. $18/adult with players card seemed about right.   CONS: More than a couple of dishes were mislabeled (\"mashed potatoes\" were actually sweet potatoes until they were switched out, second \"brisket\" tray actually appeared to be liver and onions, \"coffee\" flavored dessert was actually caramel, etc) and despite the focus on freshness and healthy options, the greens at the salad bar were past their prime and more than half of that area needed to be restocked. Service was polite but our drinks stayed empty after our first refill, despite us lingering an extra half hour.   It seems they change up their offerings regularly, I'll be back to catch the raclette station, mussel curry, and gelato ice cream cookie sandwiches.",

    "text": "This review is based on a weekday breakfast only. Rarely if ever i give 4 stars to a $14 breakfast but this place really is a hidden gem.  Location: at the Palms casino resort, its kind of out of the way, not near any monorail stations, we had to lyft from the convention center.  Ambience: new, clean and comfortable, open dining areas with a casino view.  Service: excellent, attentive to details. Perhaps it was due to our great server Wendy? Out coffee was always refilled to the brim, even the dining napkins were aligned perfectly on the table with the restaurant logo facing you.   Food: they dont offer any exotic or expensive items here, but using simple fresh local ingredients to come up with creative, fun & artistic eats.  Has vegetarian & gluten free selections. Coffee: it was actually good, less bitter less acidic than most places, smooth although flavor not as strong, perhaps dark roast? Almost but not quite as good as the coffees in Japan. Fresh pressed juices: served in cute shot glasses, its what this place is known for, today it was lemon, i downed 4 of those even though i am not a lemon fan. It was that good.  Actual food: very creative & fun, small servings in cute mini containers: smoked brisket egg benedict, tapioca fruit parfait (excellent), egg white fritatta, chilled glazed tofu (smooth), pina colada fritters, self serving/mixing cold ramen noodle station ( light & flavorful), made to order omelette station was good, gluten free pancake was very dry & a bit hard, bacons were not very enticing, they were dry and lean and in smaller pieces instead of whole strips,perhaps they cut away the fat portions?  Price: $14 each including tax. If u r a member its only $9.   Conclusion: AYCE breakfast at Palms is now one of my new favorites at Vegas. Great bang even for a loser's budget. Simple yet delicious food that are fun & creative. Its unfortunate that its off the beaten path, otherwise there will be a line out the door.",

We were served by Rafael who couldn't have been more attentive and engaging so much so that we decide to come back and was surprised that Mary again welcomed us and remembered us and we again was serviced by Isabelle who was also very attentive. Again a great experience from the outstanding service right down to the excellent food. I did not know the people's names In the back of the house but my hat goes off to them as well.

The macaroni had hot cheeto crumbs on it. Personally, I think this is pretty gross and not the traditional style I am looking for. The cupcakes tasted the same as the ones you get from Vons out of the plastic containers. The only good thing was friendly service, the reasonable price and a few good finds.",

    "text": "Since the Palms casino was sold to Stations, transformations have been happening around the resort.  Their buffet is one of them.  I recall the place was dull, small and forgettable.  But A.Y.C.E. changed that with an expensive makeover and completely new menu.   The entrance is more dramatic with high ceilings and its name is bright lights. Stations are named to sound more like a description (ie. Smoke & Fire or Sweet & Light)   Food are mostly served in smaller portions now, similar to Wicked Spoon. This is a kid ch better practice for people to sample more types, while cutting down on waste, I hope.    Food wasn't outstanding in any way but good enough to satisfy.  Small poke bowl; fresh but bland. Salt & pepper wings; flavor was good but I got a piece that was undercooked. Sliders were very dry and well done. These are just a few that needs improvement. Other than these, the food was good enough for us not to complain but not great to be memorable.   A big plus for me is they have hand scooped ice cream. They also serve cookies and premise ice cream sandwiches. Or you can create your own. Other desserts were also in smaller portions.   Our server was great. Wish I remember her name but she's an older Filipino lady.  They also did a good job keeping things full.    I can't believe I didn't know about A.Y.C.E. last time we stayed at Palms Place but there's a pretty good chance we'll go back.  3.5 stars for this new buffet.   Tips:   Prices are dependent on your level of Player's Card. Or if you don't have one, regular price isn't that bad at under $15 for lunch.   If you like macrons & they don't have any on display, try asking.  If there are any left, they'll grab it for you.    Lines aren't too bad earlier, before noon.  It does get busier after 12:30ish.    Don't be a cheapskate, tip your server. Two gals next to us didn't tip at all. Lame.   See my photos and give them a 'like'!",

    "text": "Make Palms into a locals Station Casino?  Brilliant!!  This kinda opened the gates for me - I mean, I was OK with the Palms before the management change, but back then the buffet was really kinda lacking.  I mean before it shut down for renovations, it was doing 24 hour duty!  It was an all day buffet/cafe!  Crazy!  Fast forward to 2018 and the finished masterpiece that is now the AYCE Buffet in the Palms.  What an improvement!  They definitely went to a more Station Casinos theme, and for the better I think.    Wifey & I waited a month or 2 before coming to the AYCE Buffet because it seemed to be super busy with all Station Casino player's card members wanting to try it!  Using those points, yo!  Even on the day we finally visited for lunch (with our locals discount), the wait in line was about 30 minutes.  But hey it was worth it!  Such an improvement!  We tried out tons of dishes:  -Duck Cassoulet with White Beans -Moroccan Lamb -Vegan Stuffed Peppers -Calamari Steak -Jackfruit Enchiladas (Yes!  Jackfruit!) -Poke Bowl -Shakshuka -Smoked Brisket Benedict -Watermelon Citrus Salad -Shrimp Cocktail -Ice Cream Sandwich with Cookies & Cream and Butterfinger  They gettin' fancy here!  Some wordy dishes, but some great new tastes!  I was really surprised by the Jackfruit Enchiladas, tasty!  Made for vegans!  Was consistent to actual enchiladas with meat.  The Smoked Brisket Benedict was a standout as well, good smoke from what looked like an indoor industrial smoker!  I could get used to being a local here at the AYCE Buffet in the Palms!  Definitely not disappointed.  Lots of choices for all, and the prices are still consistent with your Red Rock/Green Valley Ranch buffets.  And now with the added benefit of using your Station Casino rewards!!    Oh yeah, we'll be back!",

I came for brunch on a Sunday and had to wait ~40 minutes, but their prices are amazing for the food you receive! Some of my favorites that day included the beef brisket, pizza, and poke. My boyfriend looved the brisket as well as the eggs benedict. On top of the food, you also receive free drinks! It was my first time having a mimosa and I didn't quite enjoy it as much as I thought because the alcohol taste was a little too much for my personal liking. I also loved the dessert section as it included different mousses, cakes, cookies, brownies, and my favorite, GELATO! I got 1 scoop of the pistachio gelato and it was delicious as it included a lot of pistachios in it! I would highly recommend coming here for an affordable buffet with good tasting food! :-)",

The first time we went took about an hour wait, and I'm assuming that it's because they were so new! The other times we stopped by, the line was quick and we hardly waited which is fantastic because we always come hungry.   The food is great with lots of choices like corned beef hash, elote, bbq chicken, and many other fancy foods that I can't name. My favorite there are the choices regardless of any time you're visiting. It's definitely not Bacchanal Buffet, but it's certainly delicious for the price you're paying for. With that said, I recommend to try bits and pieces of every dish.   The service is a borderline miss, but they really try to get your drinks refilled. I believe there was only one time when our server hardly paid attention to us, but even then, that did not stop us from coming back.   A must try especially when you want to try amazing food outside the Strip.",

One of our favorite hotels in Vegas is the palms place, just off the strip but close enough if you like the the touristy las vegas strip. The palms and palms place were just purchased by the stations casino brand and they are making some amazing changes. One of those changes was to the buffet. Off strip buffets are known for being cheaper and not as quality driven as a Bellagio or cosmopolitan strip buffet. The strip buffets have been increasing their prices over the past 10 years where it's become more economical to just grab something at a cafe or smaller restaurant.  Sorry for the long dialogue but here is the review...The buffet at the palms had not had good reviews until the recent remodel. We decided to give it a try when we saw the $10.99 (with players club card) price. I want to tell you were not disappointed at all. Everything us clean and the food looks every bit as good as any strip casino. The fun thing my wife and i liked is they serve the food tappa style (a big thing in las vegas). I (we) think this is a great way to do things. It creates less food waste and if you find something you like you can always go back and get more. The service was great with a lot of great options for all eaters and fresh.  Excited to find a new place with great options for such a great price.",

    "text": "It's a relatively new buffet by Palms Casino, re-vamped at the end of 2017. We had high expectation based on a few Vloggers' reviews . We were all very excited once we paid and got inside because the decors and layout were right on point.  Even the presentations of the dishes were impressive and inviting; many were in individual servings using small bowls and cups.  Everything LOOKED great, and we were so excited, especially when the buffet prices is about $10 cheaper than Aria which we also visited and had great experience.  Unfortunately, the hype quickly deflated when it was time for the tasting.  Most dishes were room temperature cold, and most proteins were tough and dry.  The sushi rice was powdery, not fresh at all.  After 2-3 rounds of nearly unpalatable dishes, all three of us concluded this was one of the biggest disappointment we've ever had!  And we quit in record time for a buffet -- normally we'd loiter a bit when the mind wants more but the stomach runs out of room.  There were a few good selections, such as The Korean style spare ribs, tofu steak, etc.,  but they were all poorly executed for one reason or another. The only half decent dishes we would mention were the salt & pepper chicken wings, the French onion soup, and a few desserts such as the creme brulee and raspberry tarts.  At a dinner price of $21.99, I'd rather either pay $10 more at Buffet at Aria, or $10 less for Ports O Call lunch @ Gold Coast.   A big thumb down.",

Only items that impressed us were French onion soup and turkey! Oh, and the mint ice cream.

My husband and I both don't put a lot of emphasis on the holiday, so we were mostly just looking for convenience for the night of Valentine's Day. We saw the A.Y.C.E. buffet and thought we would give it a shot.  It was a great experience! Not only were the food options good (I had three of the little personal wedge salads and then an array of choices from each of the themed sections) but the people facilitating (managers, servers) were all super friendly and accommodating.  A huge thank you to Camila, the manager! There was a small misunderstanding with table seating and we ended up needing to move tables (truly not a big deal) but she was so kind and even comped my husband and me each a glass of wine. It was thoughtful and made our experience that much more memorable. If we are in Vegas again, we will be back.",

I noticed two supervisors standing next to the (empty) plate pick up area and commented to them my observations.  They said, \"really\" and walked away.  As an example, the limited (very) choice of seafood selections was highlighted by a calamari dish.  I can't tell you how it tasted since it was empty.  I asked the server behind the counter (who was very busy doing nothing) when it might be refilled.  She said about 30 minutes.  30 minutes!  This is a buffet not a sit down and order specialty restaurant.  This was quite typical of our experience. Very small selection, inattentive servers, and indifferent supervisors.  Save your money and wait till they reimagine the buffet (again) in a few years.",

Some selections here may not seem too great or appetizing, but here's the kicker - you don't have to eat those! The brunch buffet offers plenty of different options of breakfast foods interspersed with the more savory foods.   The layout of the food type is not straightforward, so I'd suggest doing a lap to check everything out to get your bearings as the section names are confusing. Lemme tell you - I went to town on those mashed potatoes and prime rib. And mimosas.   P.S. the cinnamon bread pudding is DELISH, esp topped with vanilla ice cream! Must get!",

    "text": "My friend Tim and I came here for the dinner buffet tonight.The 2 for 1 offer was hard to refuse.We tried to come here a few weeks ago for a weekend brunch with a 2 for none coupon but the combined population of Planet Earth was on line and it probably would have entailed about a 3 hour wait and I wouldn't wait that long for a ringside seat to the second coming of Christ ! Tonight's wait was much more reasonable,about 45 minutes or so.The buffet was actually better than either Tim or I thought it would be.I always consider it a negative when Station Casinos take over a property.They tend to convert the buffets to a certain,consistent level of mediocrity.But this one wasn't too bad.They seemed a bit more creative in their choice of dishes then in some of their other places.I can also nit pick a bit and find some small things that turned me off a bit and showed me that the bean counters still have a firm grip on running this place and trying to save the Palms a few precious pennies.I didn't like that the shrimp cocktails were in these containers with only half of the contents being shrimp and the rest being shredded lettuce.Of course,that was easily remedied by taking several of them and just eating the shrimp on the top and ignoring the lettuce below.Another thing was that the soda glass could have been a larger size and would have saved the server some extra trips to the tables.Also,the Asian section left a lot to be desired,with a very limited selection.Not that I ever expect good Asian food at an Americanized buffet.If I want good Asian food,I'll go to Krazy Buffet on Sahara and Cimmaron.(You're welcome,Danny,for the free endorsement).Also,I echo some of the other comments about the limited dessert selections.They didn't have any pie dishes and if you wanted your ice cream in a bowl you had to get it in some small quasi styrofoam construct that only vaguely resembled a bowl.Having said the above complaints,our server was pretty good at bringing us beverage refills and removing the empty plates.If you can get a 2 for 1 discount and manage to get here at some day and time with less than an hour wait,you could definitely do much worse than eating here.I will probably come here again in the future;I'm just not sure when.I have no hesitation in giving them a 4 star rating.I would NOT recommend that you come here on weekends or holidays as I suspect,from past experience,that your waiting time(s) would be horrific.",

I can't say how impressed I am with what the Station Casino company is doing with the Palm's Casino. Yes it is under construction but we didn't have any problem parking or walking through the casino.  The A.Y.C.E buffet was impressive for such a great price. The servers were awesome, always bringing drinks even after we sat for 3 hours catching up, talking and snacking. I really liked the duck confit, french onion sliders, salt and pepper wings, vegetable stromboli, french onion soup and clam chowder. We even had the pasta station cook shrimp with garlic in a wine sauce without the pasta which was delicious. I only had 1 cold item, it wasn't that great for a mushroom quesadilla and I didn't like the hummus and pita. For the deserts, I definitely recommend getting a waffle cone and putting some of their ice cream or it might be gelado in it. The mini creme brulee, mini lemon meringue pastry and carrot cake were truly perfect sweet bites and I had to stop myself from getting a second plate of them.  I will definitely be going back to the Palm's Casino for the A.Y.C.E buffet and so I can update this review with other memorable dishes.",

This place is a good example of the latest Vegas trend of newly remodeled, upgraded buffets with a modern feel and higher quality food. I didn't expect much of a strip buffet under $20, but this place is actually quite good and offers decent selection of great quality food. No crab legs but some good selection of seafood, ribs and beef brisket for meat eaters, and even a vegetarian station. The selection of desserts is also quite good. I would compare the feel and the quality to a more prestigious buffet like M. On the strip I previously preferred Planet Hollywood's Spice Market buffet, but now I may be visiting this buffet at Palms more often.",

We happened to get the ending of the breakfast buffet and also the beginning of the lunch part so we had a good decent of choices to choose from.  The food was okay but nothing that I can remember.  The only reason I gave it 3 stars was because the service was impeccable as she kept checking up on us and kept refilling our drinks.  The reason I took off 2 stars was because after eating here I got sick for the whole day which wasn't pleasant at all especially since it was our first meal landing in Vegas.",

Then we got a table and took another 20 minutes just to get a drink. Food selections were minimal and mostly bland. Didn't really like any of the food that much. Won't be back which is too bad as we stay at the Palms all the time.",

The atmosphere and decor hit high marks and the staff were especially friendly and attentive unlike many other higher priced buffets, where you can't even get them to take your plates away.  The selection is smaller but the flavor of each item was on point.  If you join the players reward club they will give you a discount.  4 stars only because the ice cream in the case was very soft, a minor detail.  We will definitely be back!!",

When I asked the chef about it he said he would have some soon. My table was right next to the station so I was able to see during my entire meal if any was put out. About an hour later I asked him again and he said it wasn't ready yet. I stayed till 9pm when they close and still none was out. Wasted $50 on me and my wife's dinner. Will not be coming back. The Asian food was very hard and sticky, the Mexican food tasted unseasoned. (The elote does not look anywhere near the pictures). If you're gonna eat anything here the cookie ice cream sandwiches weren't bad and the fruit tasted fresh.",

The price is 19.99 a person we had a coupon for 1 free still not even close to what it was worth. They spent way too much time trying to look fancy they completely forgot about the basics.

    "text": "I was just there the other night to try the \"new\" buffet.   After standing in line for 45 minutes in a human maze to be $19.99 each (from my understanding it's 21.99 without boarding pass,  19.99 with red boarding pass and 17.99 for yellow or higher boarding pass, which I had but was charged a different amount regardless).  After being seated,  you will notice that you get an \"A.Y.C.E.\" pre-reprinted paper napkin (one per person and you will receive another one napkin per person if you ask nicely during your meal.   All alcohol is charged separately from your meal, so keep that in mind when your deciding what beverage you want to order and order 2 because the service for refills is slow to none.  The salad bar was nice,  just be careful with the sneeze guard because of you're over 5'6\", you will have a hard time reaching the back row of salad condiments, having to go in blind, fumbling for a spoon and hoping you've grabbed the bacon and not beets because you're nor able to reach and look at the same time(I had a difficult time and the attendant was even trying to help me reach because the sneeze guard is positioned really low) although the shrimp cocktail in little buckets was a nice touch but the soups were still the same as anything you'd find at a fiesta buffet.   The was a cold slab they used to keep these small dishes of poke chilled.  It was really neat to see but its so much waste of rice because the rice was what was being chilled, causing it to dry out and get crunchy.   If you're down for cold, dry and crunchy rice with 2 pieces of raw fish on top,  then you'll like this. THis dish wasn't well thought out but it was nice to see though.   I tried a lot of flavors and the pizza area seemed to be consistant, not the best ever eaten but more palatable then some.   The rest of the buffet was the same as any station.   They dressed up their flavorless mac n  cheese into single serving dishes with bread crumbs and processed swiss cheese shavings on top(a generic box from winco had the same flavor... move along there's nothung to see here).  The marinara sauces tasted fermented(spoiled) and led me to think certain dishes were overcooked and an after thought to get rid of quick by placing it on the line.  This buffet is not and holds no flame to any strip buffet.   It holds no flame to green valley ranch.   It does keep up with red rock and the rest of the stations only the presentation and plating is what makes you think it's new and improved.   I had high hopes that for the price they are charging that this buffet would shine.   It's not worth the effort.   And I'm deeply disappointed.  They spent so much money on napkin printing instead of quality ingredients.",

    "text": "I saw reviews of the AYCE on YouTube and it looked really good but you never know until you actually try it. I actually loved the buffet, I usually avoid all Vegas buffets since most are either way over priced and mass-produced or just horrible. I've been to almost every buffet in Las vegas. So far for the price and food quality this is the best one currently.   I actually saw the chefs make the food in the kitchen it seems nothing was brought from outside sources. I also saw the chefs blow torching the creme brulee.   I'd say 90% of the food I ate was top notch. Only thing I didn't like was the salmon poki avoid it I felt it was inedible. The smoked pork ribs, smoked brisket and everything in the Asian section was awesome. They also had a decent vegetarian section too. They had roasted cauliflower in the carving section for slicing.  The dessert section was top notch, hand made ice cream sandwiches, creme brulee, gelato, also french macaroons.   The best part of the buffet was how fresh everything was nothing was sitting around and old food. I read some of the reviews and I don't see how some people say it was bad. The buffet is not the biggest in Vegas like baacanal at Caesars but it's about quality and I think palms delivers.  Big tip: this is one of the buffets without a gap between lunch and dinner so you can walk in at 3:45pm pay lunch price and get dinner food that starts at 4pm.   I originally rated this buffet 5 stars but I first went to this buffet on a Thursday and then went back Sunday for dinner again but the quality had gone down which lead me to believe that the buffet is inconsistent In quality. When I went back again the dessert section was not very good as it was before, it seems their ice cream fridge went on a blink and the ice cream looked very melted. There also was no creme brulee and no french macaroon like few days before. This is disturbing since it was so good the first time I went. I still have to say the Asian section is very good, all the flavors pop.",

    "text": "what a great breath of fresh air the new and most definitely improved buffet at the Palms is! I must be honest when I say I was a little concerned just from my past experiences at station casinos buffets, boy did they prove me wrong! I hope this is a positive trend that will be taking place in all of the station casino buffets! Love the porchetta, mac & cheese and Au gratin potatoes. The small individual portions give you the opportunity to try a little bit of everything. Make sure you get the brisket and the highlight....the pizza..yes.. I said the pizza!   It obvious Great though and research was put into this buffet! This buffet is by far the best value on or near the strip. For three people on a holiday weekend we would've spent the same amount for one person at a very popular buffet on the strip.",

The system of getting people into this buffet is so flawed that I won't be back based on that fact.  We waited behind a party of 11 and 6 and 5 ppl ahead of us, where the cashier basically stood at her station and watched water dry while the other side which was the VIP Line moved like clockwork people going in with 3 4 2 ppl. no issue. She turns to tell me, \" oh there are just waiting for tables,\" clearly a flat Lie.  The Food was so-so Bbq ribs were dry, and i felt like i could bring them home to my dog to chew on. The Soups were Cold and the dessert tasted of Gross concoction that was not at all what it was supposed to be. The Brulee was horrifying, it literally tasted like Paste custard. Nope, Won't be back.",

There were so many \"non-typical\" buffet items that were delicious and unique. The only cons i think are the variety. We loved it so we came back the next day but most of the items were the same. And also after our first plate both servers said \"would you like tea or coffee\" basically a way for you to leave early. But they were both very nice and prompt. Which usually isn't the case at some places. It's a little off strip but free parking and valet.",

I saw this buffer advertised and decided I would try it out. Getting through the line was pretty quick and efficient. The food selection was good and the price was better than the Rio. I ate way to much and do not regret it. Our server Jennifer was on top of everything. Drinks plates and anything else I needed was taken care of. Well except the food. It is a buffet after all lol. Being the observant guy that I am I noticed that many many more people were receiving the same quick friendly service. Jennifer provided hands down the best service I have received in a buffet my entire life. Next time I am in vegas I will be visiting again. Thank you Jennifer I hope you had a wonderful evening.",

Beautifully renovated, my type of decor (nicer than Orleans and food is WAAAYYYY BETTER)   I've always love mini dishes at buffets and they have it which is wonderful.. just like all the strip buffets..  The food is GOOD except for the dessert  section, nothing special (it's a good thing for me cuz I'm a sweet lover) hehe!!  My favorites are the pork slice up on the cutting board(very tender), Asian chicken wings was crispy and flavorful, the Mexican has to be pork pastor(not a typical taco pastor type but was very yummy    I know there isn't a lot of different dishes to choose from but the quality is more important..  Presentation on all the foods was beautifully made, but some lack in flavors like shepherds , veggie pot pie and burgers ..  They have a vegan section, I didn't try it cuz nothing look appealing ..  Overall I would definitely come back again and again until the food quality changes(gets worst) this goes for all the buffets I've been to.",

It looks like they renovated recently. Very clean and nice furniture. Plenty of parking too! I mention all this because the location and environment totally affects my experience.   Now to the Buffett.... super cool decor. Clean. Organized. Nice service by staff. We had to wait one hour in line for our Sunday brunch, but to me was worth it. The price is right, $22 pp for brunch. They offer a good variety of foods and great dessert selection! Brunch Includes mimosas and champagne too! It's short of 5 stars because I though the food was a bit cold and some dishes too oily. They could do better there. I just Did not eat those.   So if you are looking for the buffet experience at an affordable price in Vegas this is the place!",

It's a good price $21.99 for us, but you can get two dollars off each ticket if you get a Palms rewards card at customer service, or you can get the buffet for $17.99 if you have the Palms yellow card. I'm not even sure what that card is, but ask about it.   There were many options for people with different dietary restrictions. There were plenty of light options as well, salads, etc.   Favorites from the buffet: Stromboli, Pistachio macaroons (highly recommended), roast beef, creme brulee  4.5/5 price  5/5 Decor and service  3/5 food",

As a vegetarian, the \"Revival\" section of vegan/vegetarian food was a little underwhelming in terms of options, but what they had was good, and the other food type/style sections each usually had at least one vegetarian dish that I could have.  As a local living in Henderson. When I want a decent buffet (with a better salad bar) at a decent price, I expect I'll continue to visit the buffets Green Valley Ranch & Sunset Station instead.  Not included in the normal buffet price, A.Y.C.E. does have a couple nice beer options, and also has wine & mixed-drinks available.  I overheard a customer in line ask about seafood -- as of now, there is no seafood station.  There are a few minor seafood options at some of the stations.   Depending on how things go & customer requests, etc. they will \"study adding a seafood station at a later date.\"",

It had a good selection of small dishes, bbq, pasta, fish you name it. The food quality was easily on par with Red Rock and other buffet's in it's price tag actually I would say it was a bit better. Some of the various dishes I tried were the Swiss mac n cheese, a few slices of the fresh pork that was SUPER good, a little dish of cucumbers in some sort of dressing. I can't actually recall everything I ate but I can say I went up for seconds on the fresh cut pork. Seating was nice and the customer service was all you can ask for for attentive on drinks and making sure you were happy. The place has a bit of a Western cowboy feel to it. I think this is a safe bet to get lunch or dinner give it a shot. Stations has def come through good on this change at the Palms.",

Many of the selections are ultra fancy, small portions of unusual concoctions that look better than they taste.  In fact, most of the food is often too dry, too overcooked or undercooked, and tasteless.  My wife agrees with me and we will never eat there again.  The buffet, when the Palms was operated by the Maloof family, offered better tasting food, more variety, and a larger selection of food items, especially meats, salads, and deserts.",

We happen to come at a time when they're switching from breakfast to lunch so we had a small taste of lunch as well and from little we tried, it was good too. Will definitely come back for dinner buffet (another day cause we're FULL haha). One more thing, service was great thanks to Will, friendly staff. I hope they don't change.",

    "text": "So many salted reviews, using the same photos amazing.  This buffet is not the Cosmopolitan Wicked Spoon, nor approaching anything like that quality buffet.    I received 2 - 2 for 1 breakfast coupons and my lady also received 2 coupons for a Palm AYCE Palms Breakfast Buffets.   We had not been to the Palms for 6 months and we went taking advantage of the 2 for 1 pricing.   My review After liking the updated buffet premises: only change I really noticed an added a Gelato section, and a few more tappa style dishes.  I believe it is difficult for a Casino not have a decent breakfast buffet: cook eggs or make a omelet to order station, and have bacon, potatoes, and sausage very close to that to order station.    The Omelet Chief was a very adept in remembering orders, he was polite but not a entertaining or cheerful type individual.  However he must be close to one of the top Omelet Chief the Stations have in their employ.  He was quick, & did not seem to confuse orders as some Station Casino cooks labor with.  Unfortunately he did not provide any pleasing customer interaction that is seen by numerous chiefs in Casino breakfast buffets.   Maybe it was good the Chief was a good cook just following customers orders efficiently, as there were no Bloody Mary to greet the Hotel breakfast guests that may have been enjoying the Hotel facilities late into the previous evening.    The remodeled Buffet was like most station's properties, similar in architectural style.  The new decor/layout in the Palm's was pleasing to the eye, food display has not changed as much from the Previous Palms buffet, but believe that is the result of three Chiefs hovering in the background that was keeping the staff on their toes.     Added: Hard ice cream (Gelato area).  Price almost doubled.  No closing down, during change over from Breakfast to Lunch (a nice change).  Missing: the round Meat carving station that extended outward from center of food display aera.  Complimentary Beer and Wine served with lunch and dinner.  No Shrimp night on Tuesdays evenings as I stray from a Breakfast review.  Overall: I liked the location and newness of the premises, Hard Ice Cream (Gelato) was a necessary upgrade, with the Complimentary Beer and Wine being discontinued for Lunch and Dinner. A small \"no added Sugar area\" that includes 1 Gelato flavor.   I am worried when the hovering background Chief's disappear the buffet will suffer and the Palms AYCE will slide into a step above Sunset Buffet.  Currently I believe this buffet is a step below both Green Valley and Red Rock Casinos owned by the same parent company.    If they send me a 2 for 1 coupon to use I will consider eating in this buffet, but I currently believe it is not worth $9 plus tip for breakfast with a Casino Card.    Recently all Station owned Casinos have raised their buffet prices $2, including a competitor of Boulder Station, Sam's Town.",

    "text": "We came here after reading all the great reviews but we were completely underwhelmed. The selection was small and we hoped they would do a great job with a limited number of items. Unfortunately, the food was just meh. The one highlight was the brisket which was available after 4pm. We had a tough time finding stuff to eat. The ribs were tough, the roast beef was dry and the mac and cheese was swimming in grease. Service was ok, not great. An inexpensive buffet and it tastes like it.",

Service by far has been the best. Larry was super sweet and had great customer service and the manager Marry was funny and understanding. They are doing a great job at the palm with their buffet. Can't wait to come back again. Thank you.",

    "text": "I hope this message serves its purpose. I am a Vegas local. I rave about Palms buffet since the first day it opened. In fact, I was an invited guest to come and try the buffet out prior to its opening.   Yesterday (7-25-18 @2100hrs) I walked up to the counter with my brother and nephew to meet up with our friends who were already sitting at a table. The nice lady \"I believe her name was Jaqueline) help and assisted us with taking our points and allowing us to join our party.  While I was standing in the waiting area, a group of basketball high school kids came up and asked questions regarding the buffet. They were speaking to (I was told the manager Key or Kya). The way she spoke to those kids was very unprofessional and uncalled for. I told Jaqueline, the lady who was helping us that she was rude. 2 minutes later, Kye or Kya asks in a rude was (You have something to say) I looked at her and said no, I said what I had to say to Jaqueline. After I told her that, she continued to stare at me for 2-3 minutes, so I looked at her like (can I help you).  As stated, I am a local and I rave about Palms buffet. To all my friends and family who come to Vegas for visits, to passengers that I pick up that are asking me questions about good food in Vegas and Palms is literally the MAIN hotel I suggest to these folks.   I will NEVER suggest Palms due to the manager (which I can't believe she is the manager of the buffet) and her nasty attitude. She was very unprofessional and what she did to those kids and to me was totally unacceptable. I am a combat veteran, senior leader. I would NEVER train any of my staff in a leadership position to treat and talk to guests the way she did.  I appreciate your time and hopefully something will be done of this concern because if she did this to that group of kids, as well as to me, I'm more then sure she is doing the same thing to others and that is a turn off for a senior leader (the manager) to treat guests the way she did.  If you decide to pull up surveillance it started at or around 2059 on 7-25-18",

    "text": "Wow! This place reopened two weeks ago and what a turnaround. The ambiance is great; the space is inviting; and the food is...awesome! I compare this buffet to Cosmopolitan's wicked spoon buffet (except that it's better because it's reasonably priced!) I'm not a huge buffet fan in generally, but the food was quite enjoyable here - someone knows what they are doing. We tried the buffet for breakfast, but will be going back for dinner. Great variety in choices; the baked goods were really well done (esp the blueberry scone and cinnamon roll). The frittata, rice w/ egg, cold salads, chilaquiles and pizza were standouts. The fresh pressed juice was also great. Very happy to see the buffet and Palms for that matter, make a comeback.",

There were some pleasant surprises that most buffets wouldn't have - like asparagus & honey walnut shrimp, which coincidentally were a few of my favorites. I was excited to try their Mexican corn, but was very disappointed. I got the cojita cheese one and it had way too much mayo & cheese, not enough lemon, chili flavor. I think they should change it and let the customers customize and add their own toppings. That would be a hit for sure.   Overall it was good and we'll definitely go again.",
