    "text": "Celebrated Mom's 80th last night at Archi's. We were a group of 10 and ordered a variety of dishes - from soup,salad,to satay and pad Thai. Our server didn't smile much or show much expression, but he was quick and efficient. Sometimes he would refill our drinks and we wouldn't even notice it!  We called him the Ninja waiter!  All the food was great as usual and no one was left unsatisfied.  I like the plush wood decor and atmosphere of Archi's as it is on par with nicer restaurants.    I've been here about 10 times over the last few years and food is always good and service have been consistent. Some might consider the service bad (sometimes the culture is just plain shy).  I just think service could be friendlier but they still got the job done.   Our party of 10, with only a few glasses of wine cost about 200 dollars with included 18% tip.  Not too shabby.  Will return often.",

Both times, my cousin and I ordered the Pad Thai and Panang Curry. Both were amazing and full of flavor! I've had pad thai many times before and sometimes it's just drowning in oil, but this was a perfect combo of everything.  The service was great, and even at lunch when it's very busy, they do a good job getting you seated pretty timely. I'll definitely be coming back my next time in Las Vegas!",

I love their Pad Thai. My daughter enjoys all their soups, but there is one they make with coconut milk and she shared it with all of us. It was so yummy. This place has decent service and is very clean. They kept refilling our water, which can be unusual.  A lot of places don't even give you water, let alone refill it. I have never had better Pad Thai in my life. The next time we visit Vegas, this IS THE place we will go!",

    "text": "I have been hearing people wax poetic about Archi's for a number of years, but had yet to get around to trying their fare.  It is always hard for a place to live up to its reputation when the expectations are so high, but even taking that into account, while the experience and service was acceptable, the food was a huge let down.  My co-worker and I went to the Rainbow location for lunch, and were greeted at the door by a short line of people and a 10-15 minute wait, which I took as a good sign.  Busy restaurants are usually really good restaurants so I never mind a short wait.  We were seated in a corner by the kitchen.  The overall service was perfectly acceptable for the lunch rush, with prompt drink service and consistent refills.  The server took our orders, and another employee came out to verify my co-worker's order just to make sure that it was correct.  I immediately mocked my co-worker for being complicated.  The wait for our lunch was a little long, but again that does not factor in to my rating as it was during the lunch rush.  Upon my order arriving, that's when the experience went downhill.  I ordered their \"Signature Dish\", the Pad Thai with Chicken, with a requested heat level of '10'.  The dish was served with a pinch of salad\\greens, and a spring roll.  It was also, unfortunately, served with a healthy heaping of raw sprouts.  Had they been cooked, no problem, but when they're raw, they're often nothing more than a snow white vehicle for e-coli.  I ate around them.  The spring roll was \"OK\" and the sauce was slightly sweet and just a touch spicy.  Then I dug into the heaping mound of noodles.  The best I can say is that they were warm.    Barely.  With random pockets of \"kinda hot\" and a chewy, overcooked texture.  The chicken seems to have been an endangered species for the dearth of pieces that found their way to my plate, and the overall flavor was just bland.  If the spiciness index of this plate was a '10' a '5' would probably put my taste buds into an irreversible coma and a '1' would perform a lobotomy through the roof of my mouth.  TL\\DR, it wasn't spicy at all.    I really wanted to like Archi's, but if this is their \"Signature Dish\" I really don't know that I have much interest in trying any of their other dishes.  The service was acceptable, the staff was very friendly, the portions were large, and the price was OK for lunch, but the best description I can give to the food is \"Mediocre Freezer Meal\".  I've had vastly superior offerings at Pin Kaow.  Heck, even Mr. Chop Chop on the east side serves palatable, hot Thai food with a side show as their socially awkward offspring try to act as servers.  Sorry, Archi's, I probably won't be back...",

We started off with the Tom Yum soup.  We all ordered rice on the side so we could put that with our soup.  It was so yum that we went silent when it got served.    For main dishes, to play it safe with everyone else we ordered Papaya Salad, Mongolian Beef, and Pad Thai.  Nothing disappointed us.  We ordered everything on Medium spicy to keep it safe since you never know their level of spiciness.  We didn't have any left overs among the four of us sharing.   This really hit the spot.  Glad its in my neck of the woods.  I usually like to go to Chinatown to get my Thai fix, luckily my taste buds and tummy was satisfied with the spice!",

Both soups were excellent; filled with fresh and tasty veggies. We split a veggie Pad Thai. Generous portion for two even. It was again tasty; filled with fresh veggies, the sauce was outstanding with perfect noodles too. The staff was obviously short handed tonight and they did a really great job despite the overload.

To find something like this in Las Vegas was a treat. So how excited was I to hear that they opened up another location closer to home?? The answer: VERY excited. The other location was nice, but this one is all new and seats many more people.  This is probably my favorite restaurant to hit up when I have a craving for Thai. My go-to dish: Pad See Ew with beef. Do yourself a favor and add to it some vinegar spiked with green chili peppers.  Other Archi's menu favs: thai iced coffee, thai iced tea, Tom Yum Shrimp soup, Panang curry, and Pineapple fried rice.  Their lunch specials have great variety (served with soup and egg roll). And you can now order online!",

I came here with my friends last week.but was too busy to write review, I like this place better than Lotus of Siam, personally I think Lotus of Siam is overrated,  we ordered papaya salad, spicy eggplant, catfish dish, pad thai, and another dish which I forgot the name, but everything blended well, and taste delicious, the portion is big enough , unlike Lotus of Siam, Would come back again, however, one down side is it took quite a long for them to cook  other than that, I would definitely recommend",

The ambience is more casual but the food definitely makes up for this. We ordered the Thai basil chicken and panang curry. A lot of Thai places have a tendency to overcook their chicken, but this place got it just right. Their spice level was also on point (if you like spicy food, go for a 7-8; it's just enough to satisfy your craving without overdoing it). You also can't beat the price for the quality/quantity of the food!",

We ordered tom yum soup, curried beef and a ground pork dish.   All of which were very good but the ground pork dish was excellent.

Wonton shrimps have to be my favorite appetizer. Drinks are great too, whether you get the sweet-tasting Thai Iced Tea or a Singha Thai Beer. The service is always friendly and accommodating.

We ordered three dishes: Shrimp basil, chicken pad thai and beef pad see ew.  Boyfriend really enjoyed his shrimp and mixed veggies in a basil garlic sauce. Spiciness=6/10. It comes with a bowl of rice. He also ordered chicken pad thai. Spiciness 6/10. He said it tasted better than Pin Kaow. I beg to differ. Archi's pad thai was just too.....sweet and tangy for me. If that makes any sense. I couldn't put my finger on why I wasn't too fond of it until I read a previous review and that Yelper described it perfectly: sweet and tangy.  I ordered my usual go-to Thai dish....beef pad see ew. Spiciness=7/10. I usually order an 8 but since this is a restaurant I haven't been to, don't wanna get too carried away. It was delicious. Good portions of beef, perfect amount of spice, and noodles came out pippin' hot. Now, I'm a pretty small eater. 98% of the time I always have leftovers...no matter what cuisine/restaurant I go to. I don't know why but my pad see ew came in small oval plate while my boyfriend's pad thai came on a big round plate. If I wanted to, I could have killed the pad see ew all in one sitting. I kid you not. I wasn't even hangry that night. Wasn't too pleased that the portions seemed inconsistent.   Archi's is a solid Thai restaurant but if 2+ months have passed, I can tell you I wouldn't have the urge or craving to come back here.",

My whole family frequently visits Archi's and we bring all of our out of town guests here too but the service is very very disappointing.  Tonight, as my husband and I waited for our check we tried to figure out WHY the waiters are always terribly slow. I said it was because they are short staffed...he said that wasn't it because when we looked over to the kitchen area waiters were standing around. There seems to be no logical chain of command. One guy takes our drink orders, says the waiter will be back for our order, another person brings the food and we never see our waiter again. BUT alas!, it's because the waiter is also fetching to-go orders, answering the phone, ringing up checks and taking orders??? This poor guy.  Management of Archi's please give this guy a break!  You lost out on us ordering another round of beers and the whole team lost out on a good tip because everything rests on one man's shoulders.  Again, the food is good but don't come here if you are in a rush or have plans for the night because it'll take you the rest of the evening to get the check.",

Even though I like this place, they are more expensive than other Thai places like Thai Noodle House. I would recommend this place for a nicer place to take a date or a more formal lunch or dinner.

We both love Thai food, and when it's our first time at a restaurant, we order our favorite dishes to see how they stack up: shrimp pad thai for me and beef pad see ew for him. Although my pad thai was too sweet for my husband's tastes, that's the way I like it. The portion was huge, and the ingredients were in perfect balance. The beef pad see ew was good, too; among the best my husband has had. They used Chinese broccoli, which is always better than the more common florets, and the beef was tender, not chewy.  We also split an order of egg rolls, which were fine but unmemorable. And I had a glass of the house Riesling, which was a little sweet as Rieslings go but a good match for my spicy entree. Service was fine but a bit slow, but since we were in no hurry to get anywhere, that was no problem for us.  Next time we're up for a float, I think we will float on over to Archi's for lunch. And by the looks of their weekday lunch specials (10 tasty selections, each with soup and egg roll), I think I'll try for a Friday next time out!",

    "text": "One of the most consistent Thai restaurants in town as the quality of food is great with a lot of flavor.  The spice level is quite tricky as the low levels seem quite spicy and I've received dishes with same spice levels at time of order but are completely different in levels when they arrive to the table.  Great selection to chose from that makes you come back to try them all!  My favorites include the tofu soup, Tom yum soup with shrimp, stuffed chicken wings, spicy basil chicken, pad Thai, and all the curries!  Make sure to try the mango with sticky rice dessert when in season I think during the summer time.  My go to location is usually the rainbow and 215 especially after a yoga session at Vegas Hot up the street.  I've been to their other locations so it's convenient no matter what area of town you might be on.  Reasonably priced I give Archii's two thumbs up!",

Walking in the door, the boasting continues with a table, dedicated and decorated for their many Zagat and other food awards. What do you not find? Good service.   They certainly missed the mark from the moment I stepped in the door. The host attempted to seat me with another party, sighed with extreme displeasure that I wasn't with the initial group. (I'm sorry; did you just do that in front of your shrine of awards and pictures of the business?) After he came back to me, I was seated with no greeting, no notice of specials for the day, and no smile. :(  I ordered the papaya salad to start off with and the red curry lunch special. Sadly, my lunch special came out and was finished by the time my papaya salad came out and I ended up getting the papaya salad to go.   As for the food, I'm not sure if this same Archie's Bistro was the same Archie's Bistro that received the numerous awards for their food, but their food was really just average. The red curry sauce was a little too runny and didn't have as much flavor as what I've had at other places. The papaya salad was average.   Overall, I'm left somewhat satisfied but still puzzled at how they could have gotten so many awards when my entire experience was lacking from the less than average service and about average food. From the high expectation that was set from their grandiose display of awards I felt disappointed by their horse and pony show.",

Ordered 2 lunch specials to share, along with pad see ew and beef salad for 3 people (which was way enough).. Each lunch special came with fried eggroll and soup.. and the prices were decent..  -LS Pad thai $6.95 Rice noodles stir fried with tamarind juice, bean sprouts, green onion & side of crushed peanuts -LS Pepper Steak $6.95 Sauteed with garlic, bell peppers, onion in our special brown gravy sauce -Beef Salad $9.95 Grilled top sirloin, tomatoes, red onion, cucumber, green onion and cilantro, hand-tossed in spicy lime dressing, served on a bed of romaine -Pad See-Ew $7.95 Wide rice noodles, stir fried with Chinese broccoli, egg and Thai soy sauce  They give you an option to select your spice preference from 1-10, I love spicy food and I would normally pick an 8 or a 9 but the other 2 that were with me cannot handle too much spice so we settled for a 4 which still surprisingly gave a little kick..  The pad thai and pad see ew was good, not too sweet- some places make it too sweet but it was delicious.. pad see ew is normally my favorite of out of these 2, I enjoyed the pad thai better... The beef salad was fresh and the beef was tender and the flavors were delicious.. The Pepper Steak, we could've done without..didn't leave a lasting impression..   We enjoyed our lunch here and the servers were very attentive and pleasant..",

But this was Thai so I didn't get it.  NEWSFLASH: It's like delicious Thai food in a super comfortable setting..which is not always the case.  The Chicken Satay is always my starter. That peanut sauce you get with it, oh man oh man! I then usually stick with the Basil Beef #1 level spicy because I am a little baby and can't handle any spice.   A friend of mine was under the impression she didn't like Thai, until I brought her here. Guess what??!!  After she had the Pad Thai, she was HOOKED. A week later, she insisted we go back. I try and tell people that I have stupid good taste in food, but it's like pulling teeth to get people to believe!  THANKS ARCHI'S for not making a liar out of me!",

My friend and I went for lunch on a Monday. It was decently crowded, but their service was great from start to finish. We had the stuffed wings appetizer, chicken Pad Thai (lunch portion), and papaya salad. They made it exactly as we requested, and everything tasted wonderful. I wanted to order my favorite dessert, mango & sticky rice, but knew i had no room to eat it. The portions were big. The price of the bill was more than reasonable, too. Always a great thing to see at the end of the meal. :)  Next time I'm craving Thai food, hopefully my forgetfulness will not fail me, and I'll head down to Archi's.

    "text": "Archi's is me and my wife's favorite Thai place in Vegas.  Sadly, it's on the opposite side of town from us.  Whenever we end up near here, it's a must that we stop in.  The food is excellent.  I recommend the Spicy Basil, the curries, and the Beef Salad.  My wife heartily recommends the Pad Thai.  The dishes are all very flavorful and the portions are generous.  My Spicy Basil provided two meals, while my wife's towering plate of Pad Thai had enough leftovers for two additional meals.  Prices are comparable to other places and reasonable, in my opinion.  We've always gone at lunch time on weekends so we've never had to contend with the crowds that other reviewers mention.  I only have two dings against Archi's.  The first is that their spicy scale (1 - 10) can be inconsistent depending on who's cooking.  I've gotten a 2 before (I'm a white boy with white boy taste buds, come on) and it absolutely lit me up.  And then I've gotten a 1 to be very cautious and it was not even remotely spicy.  The second ding is one of the more common complaints: the staff is not personable or congenial.  At all.  When we arrived, we were greeted by a hostess who looked so absolutely disgusted with existence that you would think that she was just told that Santa isn't real.  No smile, no greeting, just a begrudging walk to our table.  She ended up being our server too.  Mercifully, the rest of the staff picked up the slack and were able to fill most of the voids that she left in the service.  Don't let the occasional grumpiness deter you from this place.  The food is more than worth a few frowns.",

Peanut sauce was some of the best I've had (5/5). The fried wontons were also very good, but we weren't big fans of the plum sauce served with them. I was hoping it would be similar to duck sauce but it was way too sweet. But the wontons with the peanut sauce were amazing (4/5). Basil fried rice was a huge portion. My friend said it was really good, better than most other Thai places she's eaten at. Spice level was a little high for her and she only ordered it at a 4 (5/5). My red chicken curry was the bomb. I like to consider myself a curry connoisseur because it's basically the only food I can everyday without getting tired of it. This curry was so good, probably the best I've had in Vegas.   Spice level was 8 and I thought it was True to the scale (5/5). Will definitely be returning. Hopefully the other locations are just as good because this one is kinda far for me.",

You have to ask for the spices as they don't always give it to you but it's worth the asking as this way I can add a little more as I go for an extra kick.",

I have dined at Archi's a few different times (all for dinner) and finally had a chance to try them out during lunch. This place, despite the Americanized namesake, is one of the best Thai places in Vegas. I would avoid their beef dishes as they tend to overcook the beef. Their papaya salad is light, fresh and tasty. Also, this location is a good 1 or 1.5 star better than their location on Tropicana.",

My wife would go with friends to Archi's and I would hang back.  Then one day I decided to just give in and check it out.  So, I finally I tried Archi's and was, \"it's ok.\"  Then we met some friends here at this location and my friend's wife ordered the beef salad.  Thats when my world was turned upside down!  What was I missing?  My life was so incomplete before tasting this delicious simple menu item.  I actually had a dream about this salad, and it was glorious!  Ok, so a little over the top I know.  I really like Archi's.  I must eat here at least once a month.  It's not like other thai places in town.  Other thai restaurants always seem dingy and have weird drapes and dusty statues.  Archi's is always very clean.  When we order we get the beef salad, green pork curry, and sometimes vegtable pad thai.  I have also recently discovered thai stuffed chicken wings.  These are great too!  I give Archi's 4 stars, and I was on the fence with four stars.  Why? the service, A restaurant can have the best food in the entire world and if I get crappy service they will never get that fifth star.  The service isn't terrible, it's just very slow.  There was a help wanted sign on the window when we went so that 's probably why it was slow that night.  But, it always slow every night.  Try the beef salad and maybe some day you will dream of it too! Cheers!",

Coming from Seattle where you can find good Thai food (good Asian food actually) anywhere Archi's was like a God-send. My friend who is half Thai recommended it to me, and I haven't set foot in any other Thai restaurant in Vegas ever since.  I always dine in, and the restaurant is very clean and well kept. I usually order the chicken Pad Thai and beef Pad see ew. The Tom ka soup is also very good, and the red curry and fried rice are also decent. Their Thai iced tea is humongous; I get full just drinking half of it, but I always manage to make room for my delicious food. If you're looking for the best Thai food in Vegas, look no further than Archi's.",

Well, other than that, my boyfriend prefers their pad thai over any other thai location's recipe.   Whenever I dine here, I typically get their pad woo sen at a level 10 spice. I love the dish because I love clear noodles! The flavoring is done really well. Also, their level 10 isn't as spicy as some other locations but it's good enough for a spicy lover like me. I don't always finish my dish as well so I always take it home for next day's lunch! We've had their pad see ew as well and that was really yummy.   We came here one day for their lunch specials as well. I got their red curry while my boyfriend got their pad thai. Lunch was kind of a miss for us. Their red curry wasn't that spicy and it was kind of sweet at that. I know they should have a certain amount of sweetness to it but I still think it was too much. Same with the pad thai -- too sweet and too much sauce. Maybe it's just the chef that day? But they give you HUGE portions.   Overall, come for dinner. Decent place to eat. They do take out too.

Only reason I gave it 4 stars is I have other favorite thai restauants in the valley, however they are a bit more of a drive for me. Will for sure be returning!",

It was incredibly slow service and the waitress ignored our table and every attempt to waive her down to get the status of our order.  After talking with other staff, we finally got what we ordered but my wife meal was served cold.  We have never had an experience like this at Archi's but it was enough to consider not returning.  We discussed the situation with the waitress before leaving but only received arguments.  We were not upset about the wait but the waitress never checked on us and that was wrong since we did not even know if our order was being prepared.  Service needs to be better.",

    "text": "I was craving some Thai food so I decided to come here on a whim with my partner on a Monday night. We were sat down immediately and the restaurant had very beautiful Thai decor, which I really liked. It started to get a little busy towards dinner time so I didn't see much of the staff being attentive. The menu itself had a wide variety of Thai dishes and even though I wanted to try everything, we decided to share two dishes.  Silver Noodle Salad - clear noodles with ground chicken, shrimp, mushrooms, red onion, chili, green onion, cilantro, served on a bed of romaine lettuce and topped with peanuts. What makes the dish so tasty is the spicy lime dressing. Their heat levels are from 1-10 and since we absolutely love spicy food, we decided with level 8. The spice level was perfectly balanced and I might just go even spicier!  Pad Prik King - one of my favorite Thai dishes, consisted of stir fried beef (you have a meat option) green beans, bell peppers, red curry paste and kaffir lime leaves. Also, a spice level 8 for this dish. This dish also tasted great with a nice spicy kick to it! Only downside was there were too many vegetables and needed a bit more meat.  Overall, a great Thai place in a good location in Southwest Las Vegas. I would definitely like to come back and try their other dishes.",

I usually like mine on the sweeter side and I think I enjoyed it a lot. This time I ordered the pad kee now which is one of my favorites. Ordered it a spicy level of 4. My friend got the curry friend rice with level 8. Hers was slightly a little more spicier than mine but a level 4 definitely had kick to it, especially after eating it for a while. If you can't handle spicy get a 1 or 2.   I liked my friends curry fried rice. Heavy on the lemongrass flavor and not the traditional curry taste but I enjoyed the flavor.  My pad kee mow was good. I got it with ground chicken cause the meat is a lot more moist then the chicken slices. I liked it a lot except for one thing. It had lettuce in it. I've never had roman lettuce in noodle dish before. It was uncooked and on the bottom of the plate, hidden to make my dish look bigger and more bountiful. I had to pick it all out. It's weird. Did they make a mistake or does it always come with lettuce??  Anyways, besides the weird lettuce everything was pretty good!",

I have a gluten and soy allergy so it's difficult to eat out since there is a lot of cross contamination in restaurants but I never got any Cross contamination symptoms here. I always order the same green curry at least once per week, sometimes twice. I would drive across town for it. There has now been hair in my curry THREE different times. I know, you're thinking I'm stupid for going back after the first time but that's how grateful and hopeful I was to have found a safe, delicious place to eat! But I just can't anymore. I'll have to find another go-to. Once is gross and unfortunate, but after three times I think that's more of a hair net standards problem. :(:( Thanks for the gluten and soy safe curry while it lasted.",

They were the biggest praise of it all...  Stuffed Chicken Wing: 5/5- cooked perfect, needs more vegetables to meat ratio. But still AMAZING!  Chicken Satay: 3/5- so the peanut sauce is super oily. Cucumber salad was great. Chicken, was raw 2/4 sticks. Picture shows. It's like they forgot to flip them.   Pineapple Fried Rice Spice 10+: beef :0/5 It tasted like fish. Straight up fish. Not shrimp. Like bad fish. Touched it twice. The second without meat just to makes sure. I have had the fried rice with soy, and oyster, NEVER FISH SAUCE. It was awful.   Chicken Pad Thai: 1/10- I couldn't event get through one bite. The sauce was way off, and bitter. The bean sprouts, are awful. Just don't. The one was it didn't taste like fish.  With the cost of the place, and the portions it wasn't that great. I would choose something else. So many better places. I don't think I could even give it a second chance.",

We love Thai foods and we've been to a lot of them already so in a way, we know which Thai restaurant is authentic and which is commercialized.  This restaurant is not as authentic as others, their food are kinda sweet which I think they add sugar to all their food. My husband is diabetic so we didn't appreciate it. Panang curry was overcooked and too sweet for our taste buds, pad Thai kinda dry and sticking to one another, therefore hard to mix together. And after the server gave us the food, he didn't come back to us to ask what we need refilled.   All in all, nah...we're not coming back to this restaurant. There are better THAI RESTAURANT out there.",

    "text": "We found ourselves on Rainbow and dropped in to Archi's Thai Bistro at around 6:15. Be still my heart: people have elbow room and seats are spaced apart so nicely. They already had me with this respect to the customer. We devoured shrimp toast which is presented so nicely as appetizer. My husband had a Chang beer which I tried and it has a nice tang! We chose pad thai which was one of the best I ever had! Next was red curry with pork and spicy basil chicken. Excellent! My tough reviewing husband was enthralled. I earned my points with this suggestion, for he felt the meal was as close to top notch or 5 as any. Obviously we brought dinner home for tomorrow as portions are extremely generous. Archi's- well done!!",

The papaya salad is so good - crunchy, spicy, flavorful. Tom Kha was awesome. It almost tasted like curry but not quite as thick. Pad Thai was good and a normal staple. The pad Prik King was not my fave, but it was good. I just wasn't the biggest fan of the flavor myself. The Spicy Eggplant was surprisingly amazing! I would never order eggplant on my own but someone wanted it and instead of adding meat, we just got extra eggplant. It was really amazing and I would even think of ordering that myself next time!",

    "text": "We wanted Thai and this place is by our house. We usually go to Pin Kaow but we wanted to try something new.   We arrived Archi's almost 9 pm (kitchen closes at 9:30) and right when you open the door you're greeted by their awards-- that definitely set the expectation high!   Very clean place, it didn't smell funky (thank God), it was dim intimate lighting (good for dates), and it wasn't too loud so you can have a convo. while you eat.   I read their service is bad but they were welcoming towards us and the rest of the guest who arrived pretty late. They checked up on us if everything was alright and refilled our drinks without asking-- definite plus!  Ordered Thai tea, came in a pretty huge glass. NICE they're not stingy! Unlike Thai places in LA: where it comes in a skinny glass with more ice than Thai tea! And speaking of not being stingy-- rice was free!  We ordered: beef pan ang, spicy pork basil, and chicken pad Thai. Everything was a thumbs up except.... The beef pan ang, that was mehhhh.. The beef was over cooked and tough. I like tender beef, flavorful and easy to chew on. Cooks may have cut corners and used already cooked beef...I'll have to try this place again but around 7pm, maybe the beef will be cooked better.   Also there was a party of 3 that came in right at 9:30 pm (kitchen is closed). They still welcomed them, so I don't know where the bad service is coming from.   Overall I recommend this place. Good service, good food, and theyre not stingy (4 boxes of leftovers). Definitely cheaper than Pin Kaow by like 2 bucks.",

But it makes it the perfect place for an afternoon wake-up call.    Lunch specials offer the best deal, as they come with a large amount of food for under $10.  I can recommend Pad Thai with tofu, Pad Pak, and Kung Pao.  I would avoid the spring rolls, simply because they are heavy and very Americanized.  When ordering, be aware that the chefs know how to use spice - ordering an 8 will make it very spicy.  Go early to avoid the inevitable lunchtime rush.  If you get there after 12:30pm, be prepared to wait.",

    "text": "Well, even though there are a few hundred reviews of Archi's Thai Bistro, I figured that I should add my two cents in as its one of my favorite Thai restaurants in town and is literally walking distance from my workplace.  THE DECOR (4 out of 5) When you walk in, there is a extremely small waiting area right next to the cashier. This is fine if there isn't a wait, but if you go there for lunch during the week and you don't get there early, you will have to wait. Besides that the decor of the place is simple and nice, and the restaurant has plenty of seating available.  THE SERVICE (3 out of 5) Most of the time, the service here is pretty good. But when it gets busy, it might take a little longer to get a refill on your drink or as what happened one time (no, not at band camp), I think that they kind of forgot about or order because several other tables who had ordered after us got their food first. Hey, it happens especially if it's really busy....luckily that only happened once to me out of all the times that I've been there.  THE FOOD (4.5 out of 5) Now we get to the best part, the food. I've order either the Pad Thai lunch special with chicken, the Panang curry, Pad Woon Sen or the Pad See Ew (I've ordered this the most). All have been very good eats! The only drawback to their food is that the Thai spiciness level (you know, from 1 to 10), isn't necessarily accurate.....well, if you like spicy foods that is. Most of the time I'll order it as a 10, but often it seems like a 3 or a 6 instead.  OVERALL (4 out of 5) If you on the lookout for some really good Thai food, then check out Archi's Thai Bistro. It's definitely on my top three list of Thai restaurants in town (the other two are Lotus of Siam and Le Thai).",

After placing our order, the woman on the phone said 20 minutes. When we got there I had stayed in the car and waited while my boyfriend went in to pick up the food, however almost waiting 20 more minutes I texted my bf asking what's taking so long? He said no one wanted to help him and people were placing orders after us and getting them before us.. My bf tried to ask several workers what's the hold up and they kept on giving him the run around.  Needing to say it was right after the lunch rush and only 4 tables. Getting frustrated, he waited another 10 minutes before canceling our order.. So this is the second time this had happened, the last time that happened we waited another 20 minutes but didn't say anything because we love their food! We love everything there and are repeats customers.  Today, not cool Archi's not cool!",

I told him that I was there before those other parties yet he proceeded to seat the other party ahead of me. I decided to try the place anyway, takeout. Big mistake. I ordered the beef pad thai. It was completely flavorless despite asking for extra sauce and a spicy level of 4. The beef smelled and tasted funny on top of being bland. A complete waste of $10. I will never return.",

    "text": "I decided to try for a quick lunch today, so I finally returned to Archi's after my first visit over a year ago. Funny thing is that it wasn't quick. It was ridiculously crowded for lunch and we actually had a 15 minute wait.  Lunch specials are all $7.95 ($8.95 with shrimp, +$1 for brown rice). They have ten selections: pad thai, sweet and sour (a stir fry), fried rice, red curry, spicy basil (with ground meat), broccoli ____, pepper steak, pad pak, kung pao, and ginger ginger ginger. Yeah, that's the same word three times. Unfortunately, they didn't have pad see ew, which I kinda wanted to try, so I picked something else.  First item brought out was the soup of the day. Apparently, today's soup is something of a hybrid between chicken noodle soup (without the noodles) and egg drop soup. I enjoyed it a lot and quickly, and then there was about a ten minute wait for the rest of the items as the kitchen worked to get my food together.  My entree of choice today was the red curry, 2 of 10 on the spice level. I'm pretty sure a 3 would've tasted much the same, which is disappointing because I was trying to keep it even milder than I remember having my pad thai last time. I thought the red curry portion was reasonable, and the addition of zucchini to the standard bamboo shoots and bell peppers made it interesting, but it just wasn't as tasty as other places that I've tried. The lunch special also included a salad with some kind of sweet dressing, a fried wonton, and a veggie egg roll. Good, not great or anything.  Water was still refilled early and often and the dining room was still aesthetically pleasing. However, the failure of the red curry to meet my standards means that I'm taking Archi's down from 5 to 4. Heck, it wasn't even that red. What were they thinking?",

I got the Spicy Basil (chicken) without rice and had the spice level at a 5 (range of 1-10). It was definitely very spicy but just right for me. If you're not sure what level to choose though, I would go on the lower end of that range just to be safe as they definitely don't skimp on the chilli! The server was friendly and prompt.

My postmate called me from archies saying they were refusing to fulfill my order. I spoke to archies and they wouldn't even let my pay extra for the second portion of my order, my postmate even offered to pay the man and he refused. The person from archies refused to speak to me any further when i said I was going to dispute it with my bank. Needless to say I paid for items I did not receive. The Thai tea I did order was also a joke. They sent it in a soup bowl made with only the strong tea and nothing else. It wasn't unfortunately undrinkable and not one but all three of my roommates tried to drink it as well and couldn't. It's a shame because all four of us frequent archies (one of us is there at least once a week) but after this experience we definitely won't be eating there again. They truly don't care about their customers. I will also be posting picture of the Thai tea the sent me. Please note the other pictures currently posted of what the Thai tea is supposed to look like.",

We also got their egg rolls to share which I really liked cause it was full of vermicelli and veggies.  The location of this place is kinda random.

I ran into their lunch special, they have about 8 meals that come with a veggie fried egg roll and a wonton for $10. If you eat in they also add a small soup.   First expressions were amazing. I stepped into the restaurant and the aroma was so delicious. My mouth was watering looking at the dishes from the packed lunch crowd. I ordered the beef pad Thai and the beef red curry to go.  The first thing I tried was the Pad Thai. It was very flavorful and fresh. I loved the flavor. It had a lot of heat for being \"mild\". I would have loved more egg and a slice of citrus. We would definitely order it again.  I ordered the red curry as \"medium\", and that was probably a bit much for me. That said I ate it. The flavor was again really nice. It has a lot of bamboo, maybe too much bamboo to meat and everything else.  The egg roll was only okay, it's not something I would order by itself. The wonton was just a fried wonton. Nothing special.   Overall their flavors were on point and I'm looking forward to trying some of their other dishes.",

I think we got eight dishes for the six of us and almost finished everything. I got a small box for the leftover pineapple fried rice and ate it for breakfast the next morning. mmmm... The Massaman curry was very very good as was everything else. They asked us to give each dish a spicy rating 1-10, but I don't think their chefs have that fine control. Everything had a fair amount of heat, but some were spicier than others. We got 7 on the eggplant dish and it didn't seem any hotter than the others. Of course we had to get dessert, so we shared a sticky rice with mango and ice cream. The ice cream was a bit much, but oh so tasty.  The decor is really nice and contemporary and the service was good. The price was very reasonable considering the amount of food and drinks we ordered. A must if you're in Vegas, forget the fancy places on the Strip, this place will be worth the drive. I think they have a second location closer to the Strip, but I haven't been.",

We had the spicy eggplant with fried tofu, shrimp pad thai, chicken satay and (2) orders of sticky rice. I left to run an arrand and came back 15 minutes later with the food just coming out of the kitchen steaming hot. First impressions of the restaurant inside is beautiful- very calm, with faint traditional music playing and quality furnishing and decor. I'd definitely come back for a nice relaxing meal out.   As for the food- delicious! The pad thai was plentiful with a good amount of shrimp and it wasn't greasy like it can be at other Thai joints. The chicken satay was very tender, flavorful and came with a coconut milk-peanut sauce and the requisite pickled cucumber and onions which were good too. Spicy eggplant was tasty and it wasn't overcooked. Even the servings of sticky rice were good and it wasn't overcooked. All in all, it was good food prepared well and quickly.   Only gripe was that the serving of chicken satay was a tad smaller than  other restaurants and they only gave one box of plain rice to accompany the meal- most places issue one box per dish even if you do order sticky rice (we had 2-3 dishes, technically). Still, a delicious meal that was definitely enjoyed.",

Being Laotian and closely tied enough to Thai, i am very skeptical and picky about any asian food that doesnt come out of my mother's kitchen or my sister's (any 4 of theirs). But this place is the real deal.   The food is as good and authentic as you can get. I love it. When i am there i usually get the beef salad, the beef noodle soup, the papaya salad and chicken skewers.    The restaraunt is really nice, the waiters are usually very attentive and the service is quick. The prices are reasonable.

We ordered catfish curry and chicken penang.   Customer service was acceptable.  We waited about 20 mintues for our food.  When the food eventually came out, it was cold.  Both dishes were cold, not even lukewarm.  Both dishes was overly salty.  We had to ask the server to take it back and reheat it.  How can something take so long to make, and come out cold.  Was it prepared and just sat there and the servers just didn't bring it out?  Or the food was premade and they just dish it out?  Did the regular chef have the day off?

Now, I came here with a group of 10 on a weekday afternoon for a quick business lunch. I understand that a busy and popular restaurant such as this will have time delays when bussing a table for a group as large as we were. However, I don't appreciate being lied to about the time frame--be honest and up front from the beginning or accommodate us accordingly.   Please keep in mind: we called 10 minutes ahead.   When the host straight up tells you, \"Well, those people are eating longer than I thought they would. And when that table gets up you can go there,\" there's a big, fat, ugly red-flag and sirens blaring for the service department.   If you can take one thing from this review, it's this: call ahead, or be prepared to fight for your table.   Anyways: on to the food.   They have a really massive menu with different dish options for every palate. They also have some great lunch options for the diner on a budget (always got to love that). It was tasty, but I've had better. Nothing that keeps me dreaming, but something that definitely keeps me full and satisfied in the moment.   Sorry peeps, it's just the service...it left a bad taste in my mouth. Pun unintended.",

I rated 5 stars for that one but I must admit that this location is better than the other one when it comes to taste. I can't give 6 stars because we have up to 5 only but if you go to Vegas and decide to try some Thai food then go to this one. I don't usually eat Pad Thai but the night we came with the family I had a chance to try it and couldn't believe how authentic it was. Let me describe to the best of my ability. It's \"umph!\" OK, that's how good it was. You can translate my \"umph\" into something else but surely to something very tasty. I ordered seafood Pad Prik King and this one didn't disappoint either. I tried pretty much everything that my brother-in-law & sister-in-law & their sons' order, so I got a lot of Thai flavors that night. Of course I forgot to snap away some of the dinner pictures. When I'm with the family, I'm very busy chatting. Pictures here are from lunch (dinner portion is bigger). Believe it or not, hubby and I went back the next day for lunch. Yes, it's that good! *:)",

I don't remember what entree I ordered (it wasn't very memorable) but one of my friends had the larb and the other had the wonton soup. Both were great.. which is why I came back a couple months later.   That time I ordered BOTH the larb and the wonton soup (don't worry I shared!) and my friend ordered some sort of beef salad, which was good as well- it's just that once I find the one entree that I love, its hard to change my mind LOL  Anyways, the only reason I didn't give it the 5 stars was due to the food's spice level being inconsistent (I ordered a 4 both times but got the second one a lot spicier).  Since the dishes come out \"family style\" I would recommend coming with anywhere between 2-4 people, but the portions aren't huuuuuuuuuuuuuuuge so I wouldn't try to come with more than 4 unless you want to order the same entree twice.

Over the past couple of years I've ordered just about everything off of their menu but some items are my favorite. Beef Salad, Papaya Salad, Chicken Larb and Chicken Satayed skewers are my favorite. Papaya Salad is always the freshest no mater where else I order it. It's funny how I'd prefer Archi's to all the thai restaurants I tried while in Thailand. Is it because Archi's menu is maybe customized for an American palette?   Anyhow the service here is great as well, never had to wait too long to be seated, een during busy lunch hour.",

I've had Thai food delivered to my house, which... is kind of the most awesome Thai food of all, right? Well anyway, Archi's lands in the middle for me. I declare it to be good, okay, not amazing.   My friend and I went during a very busy lunch hour today. When we arrived the doorway was packed and as we walked in we walked into... well, people. I felt a little awkward and I wasn't sure if these people were in line or what. After about a good minute of standing there a girl slid by my friend and I and gave her name to the man at the counter to the right who didn't acknowledge anyone coming into the place. Hrmm. I headed over and gave him my name. He wrote it down. That was it. No salutations. No telling me how long the wait would be. Oooo-kay. Moving on...  We were sat in about 10 minutes (would have been nice to have known the wait time...). Our waitress arrived quickly and we were already ready to order because we were ordering off of the lunch special menu. I ordered the pad thai with chicken at a spiciness level of 7 and I ordered a Thai iced tea. My friend ordered the red curry with tofu at a spiciness level of 9 and we waited.  The restaurant is small and somewhat loud, but not so loud you can't hold a conversation. The tables were clean and the place looks new and polished.   As for the food. My friend and I both declared it to be pretty good, but nothing amazing. My pad thai was okay - but the noodles were a bit dry and clumped together. The side of soup was actually quite good and had an interesting flavor, coupled with the mushrooms, which I found to be a great addition. The egg roll fell flat with me, it was basically an egg roll - nothing more. My friend had just about the same reaction with her red curry. It was all right.   We ordered two very basic Thai dishes. These are base lines for what the rest of the menu will be like. Hmmm. I can't say Archi's is good enough for me to return to - especially during the busy lunch hour. The strange way the host was handling people as they came in the door was a BIG turn off for me as well.   Archi's gets an okay from me for now.",

Now I am used to the unfriendly servers here and the fact that they never check on you to see how your food is, that stuff didn't matter because I really enjoyed the spicy basil beef here. However, the last time my husband and I went here we sat for 20 minutes and no one took our food order. I ended up just sitting a 5 on the table to cover my drink and we left.   I can deal with mediocrity where service is concerned, but outright ignoring two people sitting in your restaurant? No thanks. Never again.",

I brought my parents here once when they were in town a couple years ago, and when they visited this year they asked to go here again!  I've never known my parents to eat Thai food, but apparently Archi's has converted them.  My only complaint is that the service is sometimes slow.  But they are always pleasant, and that is appreciated.  I love Archi's!",

I needed to pick-up and take food home, so my first thought was to call in my order-Couldn't get through so I just drove over. It was so busy I had to park in the next parking lot over. The place was packed and when the host took my order he said it would be 25 minutes. He was spot on, at 25 minutes he brought my order over.  I ordered Tom Yum with Shrimp and Chicken Rad Nar. The soup was delicious! The Chicken Rad Nar was tasty, but I have an issue with how they packaged it to go. The sauce was packaged in a soup container, exactly as it should be. The noodles were jammed into a small foil container...there were hardly any noodles and they were all gummed together. This is the reason for only 3 stars. A Thai restaurant should know the best way to package their food for takeout, and the rice noodles were not packed well. Plus the fact that there were hardly any noodles.  In summary, the food I had was tasty but I wouldn't recommend takeout.",

I couldn't taste the spice at all. And the larb definitely wasn't as flavorful as other Thai restaurants that I've been to. I also got kung Pao beef (I think that's what it was). The flavor was good but again the spice was not there at all. I thought it would at least have a little mild kick. I asked the server for some spice and seasonings and a fancy spice holder was brought out so I drenched my food in crushed red peppers. Overall it was good but not the best that I've had or anything i would want to come back for.",

The broth was so salty that it was disgusting, and the mussels were so overcooked and rubbery, that I could not even eat them. I could not cut them in half, could not fully chew them, and almost choked, trying to swallow one. All of the seafood, except the catfish (of which there was very little) was way overcooked. I  ended up not even eating most of it. I picked out a few squid and mushrooms, but it was, basically, a waste of $15.00. It was a friend's birthday lunch, so I did not complain...but I left hungry and disappointed.",

Much too much food for two petite girls but we're happy to have leftovers! So much flavor and not too much spice. Decent wine selection as well!  4 out of 5 stars only because after receiving our food, our server never returned and after waiting 15 minutes for someone to drop off our check & provide us with takeout boxes, I had to get up and walk to the host stand to ask.

It's neat and clean, service is fast, food is delicious, and it's around the corner from my house so 5 stars all the way around from me!!!  I've actually been a fan of Archi's from the early 2000's when they only had their original location Archi's Thai Kitchen off of Torrey Pines and Flamingo.. moved away from Vegas for college and came back to find they have 3 total locations, Archi's Thai Kitchen in Spring Valley, Archi Thai Cafe in Summerlin and this location is Southwest Archi's Thai Bistro. I've been to all 3 locations and I have to say that Archi's is definitely one of my most favorite local Thai restaurants. I do know that the owners are from Vegas so I'm all for supporting local business!!  I'm a huge fan of lots of the dishes here because they stick to traditional dishes, simple yet traditional plating, and True Thai spice level options (1-10). I love love love Thai sticky rice, especially to go with the Thai beef jerky!! Thai noodles are probably on the top of my list of favorite types of noodles! Pad See Ew and Pad Thai are my top favs and you can never go wrong when having these two dishes!! Papaya salad is always picked when I dine with my family as our salad option, and Panang Curry is the favorite choice of curry!   Archi's also has great lunch special!! Their plum sweet and sour sauce I find savory and unique but not too far off the traditional path. I'm all for fusion style food places, but I guess I'm more of a tradition gal when it comes to certain styles of Asian food because of my upbringing.. and Thai food is definitely traditional preference for me!   Food here is leveled on spices just right.. 10 level being Thai spicy. I'm in the 4-6 range, I like the kick in my mouth and a little bit of sweat on my brow.. but I like to still enjoy the food and not have my mouth on fire. I've never experienced terrible service, food comes always rather quickly, and never had a salty plate. Each Thai dish always is solid with the rich Thai spices and full flavor without it being salty. They also offer spice trays upon request to spice up your life or your mouth even more if they didn't add enough.   Thai food can be a bit on the oily side, but it's never swimming in oil. This location especially is very elegant in their furniture and atmosphere. Their lunch is always busy and packed and always professional individuals in suites always dining here during their lunch times so be prepared to wait during lunch or call in your food early.  Highly recommend this Thai spot and support your local business owners and drop on in here for some authentic Thai cuisine!",

Also, they ask you on every dish how spicy do you want it. It's so fresh and I love the service. Pricing is very good for the portion sizes for a restaurant in Las Vegas (I'm from Atlanta, GA). I enjoyed this place so much that there won't be a time I visit Las Vegas again, or have friends and family that do, where I won't recommend to them to visit ATB. Keep up the good work, great quality guys!",

We sat down and ordered our drinks but was rushed to order every couple of minutes they would walk by and ask if we were ready it was a little much. We ordered an appetizer of wontons ,when wontons came out there was barely any meat in them. For our entrees we ordered the ginger ginger ginger chicken and the garlic chicken. When the chicken entrees came out they were over powering with too much garlic and too much ginger. The ginger entree was so small I didn't even realize it had chicken in it. This isn't the archis we're used to. We probably won't be coming back to this location.",

I started going to the original location on flamingo which is and which will still be a hole in the wall IMHO.... The first time I ate there, I loved it!!! But as I moved further away it kind of got hard for me go there.   So when I found out that this location was opening.... I was ecstatic!! :) :) :) of course this was years ago!! Lol and I have faithfully been going to this location since it is just down the street to me.   I'll start of with the bad and end with the good. And trust me it's not even that bad. Parking can be a hassle at times when it's busy. But it's not under their control.... I'm just mentioning it so that ppl are aware.   Service here is a hit or miss! Sometimes they are all over it and sometimes they are not present at all and I have to flag someone down just to get my water refilled. :( so service for me is not great. Service (2/5)  Atmosphere is nice. Much nicer then the original on Flamingo. Lol but it is getting a little run down...(4/5)  Finally now for the finale.... The food!!! :) If u get a chance come for their lunch specials. It's a great deal. I've gotten the pad Thai lunch special and with the salad... Egg roll... Soup.... I always have leftovers. I've had their papaya salad.... Which is delicious! The papaya is always fresh and crunchy and it is seasoned perfectly. I ask for a 10 and in all the times I've gotten this dish, probably like 30...40 times over the past few years... It's been a 10 once. Which is disappointing but they normally give it to me at like 7 which is still decent. (4.5/5) Their Thai spring roll is good. If u like Chinese sausage this is delish!! It tastes really fresh with the bean sprouts and cucumbers in it.(4/5) Chicken fried rice is your normal fried rice. It's good but nothing really stands out from it. (4/5) Pad Thai... Is always good. The noodles have the perfect texture and the flavor is always balanced. (4.5/5) Pad Kee Mow... Is da bomb!!! I love love this dish. The first time I had it... I thought that it was delicious and I've never looked back. Lol the flavor of the basil is there through the dish but not overpowering... Well... It is really balanced. (5/5) I've gotten this dish numerous times and it's always been always perfect!!  I will definitely be back. :).",

We arrived at 2:45pm today, which is just in the nick of time to take advantage of the Lunch Special Menu(11am-3pm)! We both decided to keep it simple today and each ordered the chicken fried rice plate ($7.95 each). We also opted to grab an appetizer of chicken satays (also $7.95).  The service was just about flawless today! First we were served a cup of egg drop soup, which was pretty tasty! Next out was the chicken satays! Very thick and juicy, they were outstanding! We probably wouldn't have ordered the satays if we'd known the fried rice was going to be the heaping portion it was! I don't care much for vegetable egg rolls, but thats just so much personal taste.  Our drinks never even got close to the halfway mark before they were refilled! The waitress was really on top of it!  We are going to be moving to the area soon so we will 100% certainly be back! I'm personally excited to try their pad thai and pad see ew and other menu items!  Great food, great service...all at an affordable price...this is easy..  5 stars.",

Since I only live about 10 mins away, I try not to over indulge myself. And it would be easy to over indulge, since the prices are very reasonable. I am a huge fan of their Tom Yum Shrimp soup, the silver noodle soup, the garlic beef, the pad thai, the pad see ew, and the beef salad. That is actually the usual order (See, very over indulging). The lunch portions are well sized and come with egg roll and soup.   The service is quite decent. I have had a very few times that they were not as attentive. Also, a lot of other thai restaurants always seem dinky and have odd choice of decor. I shouldn't say odd, but very much \"Thai\". Archi's is very clean.  I have to give Archi's a three star. I wish I could give them a 3 1/2 star. Why? The service isn't terrible, it can just be very slow, and slow when they are not even slammed.  By the way, there are three locations spread around town.  This particular one is located right off the rainbow 215 exit. Enjoy!",

    "text": "So I came here today for lunch with a friend at her suggestion and since it's really close to my office and this friend is pregnant, I had no arguments. In fact, I was curious to try Archi's. There are several Archi's around town and I've heard that they have pretty good food.   Walk in...and this place is packed! I'm talking about a wait during lunch to get a table. Wow! I've never seen this during a weekday lunch at any establishment around where my office is. Must be good....then I look around and see that no one dining in the restaurant was Asian. Warning signals are ringing....but I keep an open mind.   Their lunch specials did not seem appetizing (there were about 8 specials) and so we ordered off the regular menu.   Our order (shared):  Papaya Salad - They were kind enough to omit the shrimp and fish sauce. We asked for medium but this thing was SPICY...I was sweating and sniffling the whole time. I wouldn't say it tasted bad but I couldn't really taste much of since my taste-buds were paralyzed for the most part  Pad Kee Mao with Tofu - Ok....this dish had about a gazillion baby corn slices, bamboo shoots and canned mushrooms. Really? Those are the 3 things I hate the most and the dish was about 60% that! Again, we ordered medium but I couldn't eat it as it was way too spicy. I have never seen Pad Kee Mao prepared this way and thankfully I haven't, because I absolutely disliked it  Panang with Tofu - The only passable dish of the lunch. The gravy was passable. There was a very distinct taste of the \"Thai Kitchen\" red curry paste you find at the grocery stores in the Panang. Also, there was very little gravy which made it sort of hard to eat with the rice.   Our waitress was very friendly, accommodating and didn't mess up our order at all so I really liked that. The restaurant had cute hardwood/laminate flooring and a very \"Asian-style\" atmosphere which made lunch a fun experience.   The food here was a joke and it's really not catered to anyone who's enjoyed eating good Thai Food. They aren't really cheap either (the bill for all 3 dishes was $29 not including tip). Don't think I'll be clamoring to come here again unless I'm taken hostage by my adorable pregnant friend...then I might just make an exception.",

    "text": "Yet another extremely solid Thai option in South West Vegas. The wife and I headed here this weekend for lunch and we were not disappointed. I'm very close to awarding this place five stars.  Archi's is a very relaxed, non-threatening sort of environment. The restaurant is clean and comfortable and the service is friendly. The first thing that struck me was that the menu was rather extensive compared to most of the Thai places you find outside of Chinatown. Eventually I decided to go for my (compulsory) Satay Chicken Sticks starter, followed by chicken \"Ginger Ginger Ginger\" which sounded right up my alley. Green onions, peppers, baby corn, lots of ginger... mmmm... They had no problems at all making mine without mushrooms which come as a standard. I was excited.  When the food arrived I discovered that Archi's heat scale for their food doesn't obey the same laws as most other places around town. My 7/10 would have been at least a 13/10 at most other places I have eaten and I had to drink after every other bite, but my ginger dish was absolutely delicious. The satay sticks were slightly different than what I usually look for (I usually like the thin strips of chicken and these were more chunky) but still very tasty. My wife was less enthusiastic about her vegetarian fare of fried tofu starter followed by Tofu Pad Thai, preferring Panna Thai's version, but still declaring Archi's to be tasty.  Overall Archi's is a quality Thai option that I hope to revisit soon, possibly dialing the heat down a little from my previous order. Conveniently located not far from the Rainbow flyover of 215, I can see this place being a great Thai takeout option for any who live in, or commute through, the area.",

My sister is the one who pointed this place out to me. It looks like just a casual dining spot from the outside. There was quite a few awards posted up on the restaurant frontage and just inside. For some reason it felt more upscale & classy. I don't know if it's the nice shutters or the shiny wooden tables. Mind you, not upscale like a fine dining restaurant on the strip. But like it would be a nice place for a date night or a business lunch. I got a very nice and relaxed feel from the general decor. Prices were fairly reasonable. I did notice they have lunch specials for $7.95($1 brown rice sub). I will have to try lunch another time. We shared chicken Pad Kea Mow, shrimp red curry fried rice, pork spicy basil & won ton wrapped deep fried shrimp. Spiciness for each dish can be customized from 1-10. I went along with whatever my sister suggested, which was a 3. All the dishes tasted good. The spicy basil had good flavor, but not spicy at all. The pad & fried rice also were both good, but there was a nice kick of heat. Service was good. Prompt with taking orders and getting our food. Waters refilled constantly. Overall a nice experience. I will definitely have to return to try a few other dishes I eyed on this first dinner visit. Like the basil fried rice, larb and the various curries, to name a few.",

You then sit down and are listening to a variety of music that just harmonizes with the environment (from bach to techno).  You order (fried pineapple rice level 5) and 10 minutes later your food is hot and ready.  For some reason on every occasion that I've been here, I've never heard much noise other than people having a relaxing conversation.  There are no noisy children present!  so it's perfect for a date LOl.  I love children, but when you have some quiet and can actually enjoy what eat, gosh who can ask for better!  The prices are very reasonable.  The food is ridiculously delicious and carefully prepared.    It is said that customer service can make or brake a place  The customer service here is great.  The staff seem very content (rare to see now a days)   management has done well with the staff.",

    "text": "I'll start out by saying this review is mostly about the service and we thought the food was decent.  However, after the service we received we will not eat there again.   We were a group of 10 at about 5:30pm on a Sunday evening, so needless to say the restaurant was not busy at all, yet it took the server over 10 minutes to take our drink orders.  Later, when our dinner came out, my mother's plate was not correct.  So we asked the server who brought the food out if we could change it for another plate.  She said we could not change our order once it had been made.  If we wanted another plate, we'd still be charged for the one we didn't want and then she just left.  We were shocked, since no restaurant we've ever been to has ever done that.  We asked again and she said \"my boss will be mad at me if I change it,\" and walked away again.  I asked another server if this was the norm and was told again that it was not possible to change your order.  I explained it was incorrect and not something my mother could eat, but was just told \"sorry\"...Finally, another server then came to our table and agreed to exchange the dish.  At this point, no one really wanted to eat, the mood was ruined by incompetent service and we ended up taking it home.  It's amazing to me how they could not take care of this simple request.  The food may have been good, but I can't get past the service.",

The sauce was not so much sauce - as it was grease. Cooked with onions, zucchini, and peppers, this dish was bland compared to some other Thai restaurants in town. My wife ordered the cashew chicken which was mediocre at best. The cashews were burnt, and the sauce tasted weird as a result. The restaurant itself is clean and the staff is friendly. However, there are plenty of other options available in the area that offer better Thai food. Overall, I was disappointed in my visit tonight and probably won't come back anytime soon.",

As an Angeleno, it is very hard to impress me because there is such wonderful authentic Thai food in Los Angeles. Archi's Thai Bistro comes close to the bold Thai flavors that I am used to. On our last visit, my favorite person and I ordered chicken pad see ew and a minced chicken chili basil dish. The dishes were cooked to perfection with the right amount of spiciness (and we like our food pretty damn spicy). The pad see ew was not too sweet, was not cheap on vegetables, and did not have gamey tasting chicken. The chili basil dish was scrumptious as well.   All in all, this meal paired well with the Thai massage that we had gotten after working long hours in the hospital!",

We've tried them all and ALL have been delicious. Their pad thai is also delicious. I've been to other places where their pad thai can be a bit too dry, but not Archi's. Perfect every time. Their pineapple fried rice is also another dish that will hit every spot imaginable in your body. SO GOOD. Also, you have to get their mango sticky rice. Just do it. You'll cry.

There was elevator music playing the whole time. The food took 32 minutes to reach the table. It wasn't very crowded, it was 7:30 on a Monday night. We didn't have a designated waiter, multiple people came to our table.

The real meat of this update is as follows.  I was pondering ordering an 8 or 9 spiciness the next time I came here according to my last review. I have long since discovered that if you convince them you really want it spicy, you just order a number higher than 10. Turns out they have a secret spiciness scale that goes up to 30.  Be warned! The Archi's in Summerlin will give me a 30-spicy dish that is edible and delicious. This Archi's I can not eat past a 20. A 25 was ridiculous. I dare not venture to 30. However, if you are a fan of spicy food this will definitely get you what you're looking for.",

They do the spice on a scale of 1-10 and a five can sometimes be hard to handle but it just depends on who is the chef that day.   The Pad Thai, Thai fried rice, Tom Yum and Pananng Curry are amazing as well. I have never had a bad meal here.   Sometime the service can be a not slow if you go before the rush but usually everything is outstanding",

My bf and I came here once before, both time the place was packed, and liked it..came back ordered different things and really enjoyed it...try the pineapple fried rice with chicken..it has a curry flavor...so if you like curry youll LOVE this.   I had to knock off 1 star because we both ordered 6 for spice level..mine came out a perfect 6 while his was barely a 3. Still good though.",

My favorite dishes here are the Panang curry, Crab fried Rice, Tom Yum soup and the Tom Kha kai soup (coconut).  Also, gotta get a Thai Iced tea.  The prices are the typical you will find around the area.  Archi's Thai Bistro can get busy, especially during the lunch time, so the waiters/waitresses are always busy.    The spicy levels can get pretty hot for some people that aren't used to spicy food.  So, choose wisely.",

Fast forward to many dates (including my first date with my now husband), birthdays , anniversaries,  friends visiting from out of town.... The food at Archies is unlike any other thai restaurant. People will try to say there are better ones in this city, but NOTHING BEATS ARCHIES!!!!!  I've literally eaten everything off the menu and it's every bit as good as the first time. you really can't go wrong with what you choose. Sometimes Archies wife is in the kitchen , we call her \"mama\". When mama's in the kitchen , you can tell, it's spicier!!! All the food is cooked with love , and the staff have been there cor years , they truly are a family restaurant. I've watched them grow over the years  to 3 awesome locations! Anytime someone is looking for something new and fresh to go eat, my husband and I always recommend  ARCHIES!!!!!!!!!",

Like a third of the time it's great, yakno that average expectation of being prompt and easy to order, knowledgeable and helpful servers.  The other two thirds here the service is slow, these guys become easily swamped, and the attitudes are bleh.      I really enjoy, going here because my errands and daily destinations line up with going to Archi's for thai food, but it would be cool to see some updates to the menu, and consistent service.  Maybe a legend for what's Vegan, vegetarian, etc.  The Indian restaurants that do so are pretty legit, it would make ordering way easier instead of debating with people over what you prefer to eat and can eat that they'll make vegan.      The food is usually pretty delicious, portions are plenty, and the number of items are what you expect or want.  All my friends that aren't following a particular diet will love almost everything here.  Picky people can still enjoy the mainstream favorites.  Vegans and vegetarians have great options at most Thai joints anyway, just double check with some items you order.  Whether they use coconut milk or egg etc.      The rating is low because the lunch special isn't much of a special, its crowder and service could be faster, the awards and records displayed out front make ya think otherwise yakno?  I know there are some terrible places that have worst food, or service, ambiance, and ends up on dirty dining.  I also have an awareness of much better this places out there, without showing off all these dumb awards xD",

When I got home I noticed in the dinner size shrimp fried rice that there were only 4 shrimp in all that rice. So I called them back to clear up how many should the dinner portion get. They told me that there should be 7. So I said to them that I only had 4. The lady says to me\" What do you want me to do, I don't know\". I said \"well what would you normally do in this situation, maybe get a manger?\" She replied that there wasn't a manger there, but hold on that she would ask someone else. I hear a lady on the other end pick up and tell me that it's impossible that I only got 4 shrimp and that I was mistaken because the manager is the one doing the cooking. After being insulted about lying about 3 shrimp, I decided to take my 37 dollar order right back to them. When the lady to the food back to the chef/ manager, she says\" Oh yea they gave you the lunch portion, we will give you the shrimp. LOL! I replied' nope, what you can give me is my money back. I prefer not to eat in a place that would accuse me of lying\". Unfortunately there wasn't a manger to even address this situation which is really sad. Maybe these people don't realize that everyone reviews all these place now n days. Wont be going back here again. I might be missing some other important ingredients next time .",

Plenty of tables indoors, restrooms is clean, food comes out looking and smelling good.  MENU They offer some lunch combination specials here on weekdays during specified times of the day but every time we come here, we want the main dish! We almost always go for the Pad Thai Chicken, Pad See Ew Beef and Yellow Curry Chicken!   While Pad Thai is usually the staple of all Thai foods, the Pad See Ew kicks ass here! Highly recommend the Yellow Curry as well. My only complaint is that the rice to curry ratio is very unproportionate. There is too little rice next to the curry, especially when the dish is suppose to be an entree.  SERVICE Not much to comment on the servers.

If you're able to go a bit earlier, say 11:45am or a bit later after 12:30pm, then you'll likely be seated fairly quickly.

    "text": "Whenever I am craving Thai food, this is the place.BY Far my favorite THAI restaurant in Vegas. They have 2 locations: one on rainbow and one on Sahara. Love how tasty everything is here and the LARGE Portion sizes. Only bad thing here is that Spice level is very inconsistent.  The spice level goes from 1-10. And sometimes you can order a 1 and it can be spicy as hell, or you can order a 5 and it can be as spicy as your one or you can actually get something as spicy as an 8. When we order take out, I always taste the food in the car before I leave the parking lot and when we eat in the restaurant, I have had to send things back multiple times for changes in spice level.  We usually order a combination of things but the things listed below are our favorite (see pics):  Tom Ka with Shrimp- 11.99$ Red curry Range from 9.99-12/13.99 (shrimp/beef option): zuchinni, bamboo shoots, red/green bell pepper, and I always get fried tofu (you can get non fried tofu)  Yellow curry- see pics  Penang curry- see pics- a little spicier than the red curry Pad Thai- VERY large order can be shared with 2-3 people Papaya salad- Bland and sour, not tasty.  Mango sticky rice-sweet and sticky, Kinda more on the sweet side  Will continue to come here and is always my go to place for recommendations for Thai.",

First, we were the only people in the restaurant who got their water served in to-go cups with lids. That just seemed odd to me, as though maybe they didn't want my boyfriend and I to stay?   Second, and this is very minor, but the pad thai I ordered was ordered at a level 6 spicy, however there wasn't much spice to speak of. The flavor was good though, and now I know for next time to kick it up to a 7 or 8.   The Thai Egg Rolls with the plum sauce was amazing! I highly recommend those for an appetizer!  Like I said before, overall we had a good experience, and the food was tasty and quick to arrive; the server was friendly and attentive; and the restaurant has a nice atmosphere. I recommend it, just up the spicy level if you like spicier foods.",

Lucky for us, Archis has many great entree and dish choices and every single one that I have tried has been delicious! My favorites are the Pad Thai, Spicy Basil, and Pad Ke Maw (excuse my spelling) archis is definitely one of the best Thai restaurant around the are. If you buy Pad Thai from 5 of the nearest Thai llace in this area, put them side by side, and try them one at a time, I can almost guarantee that everyone will choose Archi's pad thai! So delicious! Great job Archis, keep it up!",

I mean, Las Vegas off-strip doesn't exactly scream authentic Asian fare.  But with the long wait lines during lunch hours, Archi's built up my expectations and delivered in every way when I finally got to eat there after giving up once due to long lines.  As many recommended, I just ordered their shrimp pad thai to use as a benchmark, eager to compare to many fancy thai places in NYC. And my, the portion was large, noodles were so chewy, and shrimp was juicy. I washed it down with thai iced coffee which was delicious in the warm May weather.   Another time I went I had the Spicy Eggplant with beef at \"10\" spice level for dinner and oh boy, it was so good! Chicken satay appetizer hit the spot was well. A cautionary note, \"9\" would've been better because I was literally sweating from my crown chowing down the eggplant dish! I'm Korean and no stranger to spice but yeah, it packed some serious spice power!   Glad to have this gem nearby - it's my go-to lunch spot for the foreseeable future.",

They open at 11am and when I got there I was surprised that there werepeople waiting to get in. We were quickly seated. It was already getting packed with a lunch crowd. Archi's has an excellent lunch menu with equally awesome prices. I picked their signature Pad Thai with beef spicy level of 3 and Jessie ordered their Ginger, Ginger, Ginger. Our orders came out quickly. The soup they served with it was interesting, not my fav, but it was ok. When my Pad Thai came out I was shocked at how much food it was! They even included a little salad and an egg roll! Yummy! I really enjoyed the tender beef and sauce was just right and not overly salty. Next time I'd up the spice to a 5 cause 3 just wasn't enough kick. Jessie's lunch looked even better then mine cause it had a lot of veggies that I like including the little corns.   The staff was friendly and quick. I can't wait to go back and order the Ginger, Ginger, Ginger! I'm a sucker for those tiny corns. I wish they had a closer location in Henderson. Yay Archi's!",

    "text": "Finally. I made it to one of the top Thai places in Vegas. It's only taken me 5 years to do it. After reading the reviews of Jaime W. and Jessie B., two people who I totally trust to not steer me wrong I bookmarked Archi's and due to unusual circumstances I found myself craving Thai food and Archi's was close by. So off I went. Would it live up to the hype? I have to say yes....to a degree.   A tall glass of Thai iced tea started me off but the Chicken Panang Curry was my go to choice for my first visit. I've been a lot of places where the curry was barely palatable, you end up hurrying through it so you can get on to better things. Not this time. This curry had flavor, it actually made me slow down a bit and enjoy it vs. just slamming through it. It wasn't too thick, and it didn't look like something you buy in a box at Smith's in the Organic section. This was just right.  I was also impressed with the service. You can tell you're closer to Summerlin as this is not a hole in the wall place. It's definitely one of the nicer Thai places I've been in with service that was prompt and attentive to my needs without overdoing it. I was impressed with the portion sizes as well, I certainly did not leave hungry.   Misses: Spices. I was asked how hot I wanted it and I asked for medium heat. While the dish had spices in it, it didn't bring the kick that I was hoping for. Price was another slight miss. Granted it's a bit more upscale than some places and I don't mind paying a bit extra for that. If you're wanting to slam through some cheap hot and spicy Thai food look elsewhere, but if you want to sit back and enjoy a good Thai experience...you can't go wrong here.   I have to be honest, as much as I liked Archi's, I still think that Komol is superior to them. Granted Komol is not as upscale, their location needs a facelift, but when it comes to their food they are second to none. And in my book they still top Archi's. But not by much. And Archi's on one visit alone blows the overhyped, overrated, it really ain't all that Lotus of Siam out of the water. (I absolutely HATE Lotus and won't apologize for saying so).   Overall if I'm on the SW side of Vegas and start craving Thai food, Archi's is on my short list of places I'll gladly go back to again and take others with me. But if you're willing to criss-cross the city for your Thai experience, Komol is slightly better. The key word I want to emphasize is slightly. And as I try more of their offerings that slight edge may go away. It's really that close of a comparison.   4 Stars. I save 5 stars for places that are truly exceptional, or that have seen me walk in their door over 650 times and counting like Komol has. In time...if what I experienced today is any indication I see a star bump in the future.",

    "text": "I've been to this location before... But awhile back. Visited this place yesterday and I was not impressed.  Issue #1: Our server spoke a little English. There was somewhat of a communication barrier. He got our orders correct, but the spice level was off. Our family loves Thai food; when you think of Thai, we think of that delicious spicy food. I asked for a 7, and there was literally NO kick in my food.   Issue #2: Our waters were never refilled. We had to hunt someone down to have them refilled. (That's ALWAYS annoying)  So you could say service was definitely lacking. Cleanliness, I would say isn't too clean. I don't get that \"clean feeling\" upon walking in the establishment, but I had to constantly look around me to ensure it was clean. The quality of food is still good. We got the pad thai and yellow curry. Which was a-okay. Again, would've given them more stars if the above issues were resolved. Also, thai tea is GREAT here! I recommend the Thai tea here!",

    "text": "Before I start, let me say that the food here is great and the portions are huge.   The restaurant has a front area for sitting and a back area that kind of hidden. When we went during lunch time I saw that the front room was semi-filled. Our hostess was directed by another man working there to seat us and she took us to the back room. There were only Asians in the cramped backroom and we were the only brown people in the restaurant. Didn't think anything of it at the time, but it seems weird bc we had no children. It wasn't until later when I went to the front counter to pay that I saw that everyone in the front of the restaurant was white and there was a combination of groups with and without children. No Asian person in the front and absolutely no brown person either. Weird.   The lady that took our order was nice but may have been over worked. She didn't come back after giving us our food and we were confused if we would have to go to the front and pay bc she kept checking up on the tables around up and gave them their checks. I would have liked the same courtesy.   I really enjoyed the food though.  We ordered our dishes extra spicy and they really did deliver. Idk if it's 'authentic' thai, but after trying many thai restaurants I can say that this is one of the best in terms of quality of food.",

Large portion...not sure about refills, since I did not need one personally.  Yum!  Thai Beef Salad ($10.95): Grilled Top Sirloin, Tomatoes, Red Onion, Green Onion, Cucumber, Cilantro, Romaine Lettuce, & Spicy Lime Dressing. The citrus flavor was not very strong in this dish...the beef was tender and flavorful though.  As far as Thai Beef Salads go, it was a bit disappointing.  Pad Kea Mow ($9.95): Rice Noodles with Egg, Garlic, Chili, Bell Peppers, Onion, Bamboo, Mushroom, Green Beans, Basil & Thai Soy. This was very good, with a good heat behind my request. The pork was tender and delicious as well...recommended!  With so many Thai choices in town, I can't say I will be back again anytime soon...but it is a solid choice for good thai food if you are in the area.",

The Panang Curry Sauce is what sweet (and spicy) dreams are made of. The depth of the flavor is INSANE. I can taste the perfect balance of sweet coconut and kick of curry and cilantro. This sauce is consistantly a crowd pleaser at my table. I also always order the Garlic and Pepper Beef which is served with broccoli and cabbage. The meat is always tender and served hot. You can order your dishes at any spice level. I must not forget to mention the coconut ice cream for dessert. DELICIOUS. Secretly I am tempted to order seconds or take some home for later. We all know it would be devoured in the car by the first stop light!   Archi's is clean, the service is quick and the quality of the food is on point every time and cheap, too!

When it comes to Archi's, I've just been such a huge fan for such a long time, I have to give them a big \"Woohoo!\" By the way, this is the first time I've ever been there. Let me explain.  A few years ago, I went over to my cousin's place and she had some Panang from Archi's. I was blown away by how good it was. Ever since then, I've been ordering Panang whenever I'm at a Thai place, but nowhere has been able to match Archi's flavor. It's silly that I didn't just go to Archi's, but the longer I didn't, the more mythical their Panang became in my mind.  Well I finally decided to head to Archi's for lunch today. The fact that their Panang was able to live up to my meteoric expectations is enough reason for me to give them a five. Not that I'm a Panang expert. It's probably not even my favorite curry (I pretty much love all curry). It really all stems from that one experience at my cousin's place.  Also, they were packed during lunch today. They must be pretty good.",

First off, the interior decorating of this restaurant definitely is up a notch!  The plantation window blinds give this space an open air feeling and it's definitely not what you'd expect from a Thai restaurant at all.  All lunch specials are served with soup of the day, egg roll and fried wonton, which already sets them apart from other Thai joints offering lunch deals.  Our dishes also has a small side salad with our lunch dish too.  * Pad Thai with Tofu Lunch Special \" Thai national noodle dish: rice noodles stir fried with bean sprouts, green onions, crushed peanuts and egg.\" ($6.95) - The MIL got this and per the Husband, he said hers was pretty good.  * Red Curry Dish with Tofu Lunch Special \" Fresh red curry paste in coconut milk with bamboo shoot, zucchini and basil leaves.\" ($6.95) - Rich in color and taste, I ate it all up and it was good.  Yum.  * Spicy Basil Dish with Ground Beef Lunch Special \" Sauteed with house special sauce, bell pepper, onion, zucchini and chili sauce.\" ($6.95) - The Husband said he forgot they were going to use ground meat, so he wished he got it with ground pork instead.  Nonetheless, he ate it all up, so I don't think there were any problems there.  In terms of lunch deals, they really make it all inclusive with the little extras they throw in.  However, portion size varies as our size of Pad Thai was only okay compared to another Thai place I went to recently that gave a huge lunch portion.  However, you can't beat the nicer ambiance at this branch.  Service was fine, maybe a bit too quick on clearing our unfinished soup bowls and things like that.",

I also posted on Facebook about my disappointment with the service & how our complaint was handled but instead of reaching out to make amends they \"liked\" my comment . I have a feeling their Facebook page is being monitored by the server/manager that I wrote the complaint about so I'm not that surprised as he was extremely unprofessional and rude. His favorite word is \"sorry\" but his actions speak quite the opposite ! The food is great EXCEPT the spring rolls they are bland and are harder to chew than a gummy bear but I prefer being treated with respect and appreciation . Pin Kaow is now my new go to for Thai Food, equally delicious and extremely friendly service !",

No one ever came by to check up on us even after we made attempts to flag down an employee. Fifteen minutes later, we finished our meal and asked for to-go boxes and the check. Those were given to us in under a second. Giving them a $2 tip was way too generous for nonexistent service.",

I have only tried 2 different dishes here but both were delicious.   The first time a came here I ordered the chicken pad thai which was pretty good but Ive had better but the next time i went here i ordered the beef pad see ew and omg it was so delicious. The pad see ew is very flavorful i love the flat noodles they use and there very generous with the beef, I do ask for it with no Chinese broccoli I'm not a fan of that. They use good quality product and the portions are generous it got to the point where this is all I ordered and i would come at least twice a week that's how good it is.   so all in all great food, big portions and friendly service I probably wont be trying any other thai places for a while.",

Unfortunately, my friend, whom I took for the 1st time, found a hair in her Arnold Palmer drink. They quickly took it back and gave her a new one but didn't really take responsibility for it until my friend asked them to and they took it off her bill. Everything else was good, but I think that ruined it for her. Out of all my friends, she was the only one that probably wouldn't go back. I'm still a lover of Archi's. I usually go to the Flamingo location, but it was convenient for our group to meet there.   Also, a few years back, they only had one location. Now, they have 3. THANK GOODNESS!!!",

In a hurry, and need some curry... you get the picture.  I think I have visited every location around town, and for the most part, the experiences have been consistent: clean, attractive restaurant, solid service, tasty food. It is the perfect place for a tad adventurous business lunch. I visited the bistro for just that, and I went with the red curry lunch special. I am not sure it is a screaming deal at around $7 (plus some if you want brown rice), but it definitely isn't expensive.   I slurped up the starting soup, so it was a winner. The curry flavor is not my favorite in town, but I cleaned my plate with little effort. The other extras that come with the lunch special aren't notable. If you really want curry, it is probably worth it to get a bigger portion and pay a tad extra. Plus, they only offer the red curry as a lunch special. Bummer. One other little thing, I didn't ask if soft tofu, i.e. unfried, was an option, but the default is a fried tofu. I prefer soft tofu, and that may be doable if you request it. As for spice, the level here errs on the mild side. I requested a 4 and didn't experience any hot flashes.    Yes, like I said, Archi's gets the job done. It's a Thai restaurant you can bring home to meet Mom and Dad... and a personal injury attorney that isn't sketchy... and... enough with the metaphors. Go eat some curry!",

To start my wife ordered Thai iced tea (good if you like tea). I ordered Thai iced coffee which was kinda strong and bitter.  For our entrees we had panang shrimp and pad kapow with chicken. The panang was okay but paled in comparison to LOS's panang sauce (though imho, LOS's panang is probably the best thing I've ever eaten in my life, so that might not be a fair comparison).  The pan kapow was quite good and had fresh basil leaves and an anise undertone.  For desert we split coconut ice cream, which was a nice finish to our meal.",

Because the commercial success of Archi's business model, it will soon propel them out of Vegas, and onto the rest of the world, or so I hope.  I adore Archi's because it is a very reliable establishment to be the first ethnic restaurant to take my non-Asian friends.  My fiance loves the place, and for good reason.  They do not have a wide selection of Thai dishes, they have the standard fare of what non-Thais usually eat: curry, basil stir-fries, pad-thai, etc...  But of those standard fare, Archi's serves up good quality ingredients in a pretty presentation in a pleasant atmosphere.  Nothing is too risky, nothing can possibly offend, and thus nothing too hot, too spicy, or too incomprehensibly authentic (just don't order level 10).  Even though the lunch hour is usually crowded, it's my favorite time to come to Archi's.  They have an inexpensive and delicious lunch specials menu.  For $6.95, I can always count on a yummy basil chicken, with a warm bowl of soup and brown rice (a modern American healthy addition to offer to the business lunch crowd).  Archi's has three locations across the Vegas valley now, undoubtedly they're still expanding.  Delicious, clean, and safe are characteristics that make them the perfect franchise.",

    "text": "Came here and the other location on Flamingo 2 days in a row.. Biggest difference I noticed was the decor at the Flamingo location, really felt like we were in an actual Thai family home dining room?! In regards to food, both places were Outstanding!!  The orders:  Pad SeeEw (pork): Best Pad SeeEw i've had (better than Lotus). Simply Perfect..  Pad Thai (beef): Dinner portion came with a serving that could be split with another person. A little sweet but the medley of flavors all together were just right. Another hit! (3 of 10 on the heat scale, not much punch)  Stuffed Chicken: An appetizer sized dish. Came with 2 pieces of chicken drum sticks stuffed with goodness!.. Goes great with the sweet dipping sauce! The slight crunchiness of the skin just incorporates a very nice texture.  Spicy Basil (chicken): The herbs, the spices, the tender bits of chicken.. Wow, this place just doesn't have any flaws!! (3 of 10 on the heat scale, But this time it felt like 3 times Hotter!)  * I asked the waiter \"Why was the Spicy Basil MUCH Hotter than the Pad Thai when I ordered both with 3 out of 10 heat?\" She replied \"because some dishes are spiced/heated with powder chili like the Pad Thai and the Spicy Basil we use the actual Thai chili's so it will be hotter..\"   Another Exceptional  Thai Restaurant here in the Desert!! Well above average Service, Food All Very Impressive, Atmosphere Clean and Casual and Prices well worth it!! For sure coming back here!!!",

They are served with soup of the day, mini slad, egg roll, wonton crisp and rice.  My faves include the spicy basil beef and the pad thai.  Today the soup was a vinegary chicken broth with a few fleckles of chicken, tomato, and mushroom.    Other winning dishes include the spicy eggplant, papaya salad, and of course mango with sticky rice when they have it.    Their pad thai is buttery and flavorful with just the right amount of sweetness.  Regardless, Archi's will surely satifsfy your Thai food needs!",

Today, I thought I'd give them a 2nd chance and order something different, chicken Satay. It was dark, fatty and less than chicken\"y\". So I sent it back after eating a couple bites from 1 skewer.

My only \"gripe\" is that I wish they finely-chopped the dried shrimp up when they added it to the salad. That super-potent punch of shrimp-flavor you got every other bite was a little too much for me. Also, at $10, this is not a cheap appetizer-salad.  Got the Masuman curry (with chicken). Thought it was well-done and much better than the Masuman I've had at another Thai restaurant. Archi's version seemed much more refined. I'd get it again.",

    "text": "Lotus of Siam might have more menu items and stronger reviews -- some food critics call it the best Thai food in America -- but Archi's runs a VERY close second in my book for the best Thai restaurant in Vegas. In fact, I probably go to Archi's 2-3 times more often than Lotus of Siam. After all, Archi's Thai Bistro is located in a nicer building in a better part of town and you can usually walk in and get a table right away at dinner time (lunch time on weekdays can get really busy, though).   Archi's food is also some of the best Thai cuisine you'll ever taste combined with exceptional service and very reasonable prices. My personal favorites are the Thai Beef Salad, Pad Thai, Num Tok and Pad Prik Pow. Some of the menu items can be pretty spicy, but like most Thai restaurants, you can customize the spice level on a scale of 1 to 10. The servers are also extremely quick to refill your drink, usually doing so when your glass becomes half-empty.  I always visit the location on Rainbow and the 215, but Archi's also has a couple other locations (one on Flamingo between Jones and Torrey Pines and the other on Sahara between Grand Canyon and Fort Apache). If you love great Thai food, you can't go wrong with Archi's.",

I always order between the same three dishes for myself and Ruben: Red Curry, Pad Thai, and Fried Rice. Their red curry is just fabulous. I order it with level 5 (out of 10) spiciness and with its fresh vegetables, bamboo shoots, and choice of meat (or more vegetables), it's just so, so good (don't forget the always delicious Jasmine rice)! The Pad Thai (also level 5) is tasty and satisfying. I love the crushed peanuts and fresh bean sprouts. It's really wondeful with chicken. As for the fried rice, we order it with level 6. Of ALL the Asian restaurants I've had fried rice, Archi's is one of the BEST executions. The flavors are amazing and when I ate meat, I used to order their \"combination\" and the meats weren't micro pieces that were over-cooked, but rather plump and fresh, cooked perfectly. Even the vegetarian option was delicious! Plus, you seriously can't beat the prices!  Edit: I can't eat spicy food as much as I used to, so now I order level 2 for a little kick, but nothing insane. My new favorite dishes are the Curry Fried Rice, Basil Fried Rice, Pad Kea Mow, Spicy Eggplant, and Spicy Basil. Everything is really great though! I've also enjoyed the Tom Yum, Tom Kha, Pad See Ew, and Panang. Try something new when you go!!",

    "text": "My co-workers compromised with me and decided to take me here on my birthday recently. One of them hates Thai food and doesn't like to get nuts with anything \"exotic\". This time they made an exception.   I've been to Pinkow (which is very close) many times and was always very satisfied with everything. However, many people people told me to \"try Archi's, try Archi's\" so I did since it was close to where we worked. It gets insanely busy at lunchtime, so I'd go at around 11:30am for lunch or an off time for dinner. When I walked into Archi's it was a little too nice and lacked the great questionable dump factor that I really enjoy of the great Thai places I've been to in Las Vegas (Pinkow now being an exception with it's newer locations). As always, I searched the menu for \"Spicy Mint Chicken\", but only found \"Spicy Basil Chicken\". This raised an eyebrow for me since every Thai restaurant I've ever been to has had the mint version of this dish. Anyway, I ordered it. They probably could have made the mint version, but I wanted to see their take on it.  I got the lunch special which comes with soup, a wonton and an egg roll. I have to say they really do give you a lot of food for the price. I always ask for a \"10\" in spiciness and they did a pretty good job of obliging. It's never really a 10 though.   Overall, the food was pretty good, but they put big chunks of cucumber in the chicken which I've never seen before and that was kind of a turn off. I had to segregate the cucumber from the chicken like a little kid since there was a strangely abundant amount of it.   My co-worker, who doesn't really vary from Americana, got the sweet and sour chicken. It looked and, by his report, tasted like dog food. I guess that what you get when order Chinese food from a Thai place. All in all, Archi's is good. It's just not my preference. It just could have been a little dirtier.",

I have tried all the curries and the tofu Pad Thai. My fav is (yellow) veggie and potato curry. I love how when you add or subtract veggies or items they don't get bent out of shape :)  Hubby usually gets chicken Pad Thai. He has also ordered veggie Lo Mein add extra garlic and wow it was good :)  Honestly we have never had a bad meal here!",

    "text": "Great for when you're really craving Thai food!   I tried this place out recently when I had a really intense craving for Pad Thai at work. I did take-out since I was on my lunch break and waited about 10 minutes for my food, not bad. I was pretty impressed by the decor and ambiance of the place, it didn't have that grungy non updated look that most Asian restaurants have. It was pretty packed when I went and most of the customers there were people who worked in the business complexes behind or near the restaurant.   I ordered the Pad Thai lunch special that comes with an egg roll and wonton. The egg roll was bland and forgettable, and the wonton was basically a deep fried piece of wrapper with a pea-sized piece of meat in it. However, the Pad Thai was very flavorful and had the right amount of spice and sweetness to it.   I just found out there is another Archi's location near my house, so I will definitely be trying their other dishes soon!",

He came to us with an attitude like \" what u want today?\" . We ordered our food plus a togo later . The whole time, no one come and check on us, they missing my soup , my sister water cup was empty the whole time, and after we done eating, we tried  to get  our bill and i made eyes contact with 2 of the servers and they looked at me then look away ... We were continuing waiting for another 10 mins till the point i had to come up to one of them and ask can i talk to the manager please and with in 1 minute , the manager arrived our table . I told him what happened and all he said is , oh cause we busy so its the way how they work here ... Me and my sister have nothing else to say anymore....  We asked for our togo an they said \" oh its not ready , you have to wait for it. We ordered it before we got our food and now we done eating and it still not done .   Will not come back to this place ... Horrible services and poor management skill.",

I don't usually stray from my usual favorites which is Pad See Ew, Stuffed wings, papaya salad, yellow curry, and Rad Nar depending on what I'm feeling that day. I've had all of them at one point or another from Archi's and they were all delicious!  They do spicy levels from 1-10 and I haven't seen them \"dumb\" down the spicy levels like some restaurants do, which is a bonus. If you like a bit of kick without it being too hot I'd stick around the mid range, I typically go with 4 unless it's a good day. Although if you're used to spicy and love the heat definitely pump it up and you'll get what you're looking for.   I've never had bad service. They usually are able to keep it to the right amount of checking up on you without being too bothersome and make sure everything is good.   I've also never had anything too salty or oily like some Asian foods can be. They're definitely the place to go for good Thai food in town. The owners are also local so you're supporting another local business =]",

I get that they want to go home but they should change their hours to 11am-9:30pm if they don't want to remain open on their front of house.  The food is ok, they are consistent but hardly authentic, I'm Thai, I know Thai food. I also think that this \"last call, last seating is 9:30pm\" is completely misleading from their operating hours.  I also wanted to clarify that we got there at 9:31pm, after which we saw many many groups of people walked in and being turned away, so I'm not the only one that is interpreting operating hours this way.  Terrible way to operate a restaurant, wonder if the owners know about this  sure they just don't care, oh well.",

When we tried to get the server's attention to follow up on my food he wouldn't look at us.   I really wanted to like this place. For dining in, it's not worth the hype.

I love the crispy skin on the chicken with the marinade could eat chicken skin by itself. You get leg, thigh, wing, and part of the breast. Side of the BBQ sauce that really really good! I could see that same sauce on any protein being delicious. The fried rice was da bomb! Fried rice must admit that stands out LOUD. Most of the time order friend rice never any good but this one was perfect. I wish you get more with lunch special but it is lunch special all good cheap good food.   The service was great nice warm welcome walked in and fairly empty sit wherever I liked. The interior really Thai atmosphere from the decoration the paintings, couple statues, and Thai music playing in the restaurant. It kind of dark with the low ceilings so first check like ok. The service too the food really good stuff. Sure I would come back try more of the menu.",

    "text": "Perhaps I went on the wrong day, because my lunchtime visit to Archi's didn't live up to my expectations. Positive reviews and opinions from regulars have all told me that Archi's cooks up some of the best Thai food in town, so how could I not except anything less than the best?  SERVICE Upon entering, both my friend and I became confused over the seating process. Normally at most restaurants, there's a sign up front indicating whether you should seat yourself or wait for a host to seat you; we didn't see any of that. We waited in the tiny entryway for five minutes. The host up front never approached us like we thought he would. It wasn't until my friend observed a customer walk in and ask the host to take down her name to be seated, that we followed her example.   RESTAURANT It's clean and bright. Even though this is a popular lunchtime spot, it wasn't noisy when we visited, and there sure weren't any banging of pots and pans and clangs from dishware being cleaned up.   FOOD Originally, I wanted to order the Panang, but there wasn't a lunch special for it. Instead, I ordered the lunch special Red Curry with tofu, and my friend ordered the lunch special Pad Thai. Lunch specials come with a bowl of sour soup, side salad, fried wonton, and an egg roll, all of which are served on one humongous plate along with your entree. Oh, and there's also the option of subbing the white rice for brown, but that'll cost extra.   +Soup and egg roll: I liked the sourness of the soup, but the egg roll was just a generic restaurant egg roll that had rice noodles inside.   +Red Curry with Tofu: I went for a spicy level 9 on this one. The beads of sweat that I had to lightly pat off my forehead indicated that I was satisfied with its spiciness. On the other hand, there's nothing special about the curry's flavor. All I can say is that it was missing *something* and that it wasn't rich enough.   +Pad Thai: My friend said her Pad Thai was \"OK\" and could've been better if it weren't for the \"clumpy\", dry noodles.  OVERALL I'd like to give Archi's a second chance and try their Panang the next time around, but for now it looks like I'll have to stick with my go-to Thai joints that have never let me down.",

Very clean and lovely decor, a higher end feel for an Asian restaurant but still at reasonable prices. The green curry was the weak point of the mean but still good, just not up to par with everything else they serve. The server was not the best but it's unfair to yelp the server when I'm reviewing the restaurant, so that's another story. I will be back for the lunch specials soon and I'm looking forward to another great dinning experience.",

The drive for me is worth it!  4 stars goes to the delicious food and great service, which I'll get into detail below. The 5th star is for their remodel. Thank you, thank you, THANK YOU for redoing the bathrooms! They were in desperate need of an upgrade, now it's all shiny and beautiful.  Onto the food: my favorites are the chicken fried rice (best one is at this location, the other locations seem a little too oily) and the silver noodle soup (large is great for sharing, lots of tasty veggies). The Pad Woon Sen with shrimp is my chosen seafood fix. Of course, I have to order the Thai iced tea every time. For dessert, the sweet sticky rice with mango is perfectly sweet.  Service has always been top notch for me, friendly and attentive. I can only think of a couple of hiccups over the years, but they were promptly addressed and taken care of.",

The portions are better than any other Thai restaurant I've been to. I wasn't a fan of the Stuffed Chicken. It seemed a dry and not much flavor unless you dip it in the sauce. We did order a coffee and it never came. I do wish the restaurant would incorporate more Thai architecture within the restaurant, to enhance feeling of being in cultured atmosphere. When our waitress dropped the check, she did not say thank you or anything, just walked away. Not a great way to end a good meal. Makes one feel like you just want to get rid of them. Still would come back but service needs to improve. I don't think I saw our waitress smile one time.",

I chose the red curry with chicken at level 10 spice. Food was served quickly and hot. Everything had the expected flavor profile of typical Thai cuisine. It was seasoned perfectly and the level of spice was exactly what I ordered. The girls made sure I was checked on frequently and water filled at all times. The interior is nice and clean with plenty of staff to get you in and out within your allowed lunch hour. I have dined at Thai Restaurants all over the country and Archie's is amount the top 10.

We were in the area and didn't feel like driving all the way to our favorite Thai places so we tried this place out. We came a lil late, around 8:45 pm ish. Only a few people working as servers. So the service wasn't exceptional but it was good. Friendly. But really on the slow side to be honest. After we got boxes for our food it took a bit over 10 minutes for them to bring the check. Which is long for a table that has asked for boxes already. Stating they're done and ready to go.   I don't like how they have soda in a can and not in a soft drink machine. So every time you get a refill, they charge you for another can / soda. So there's no refills on any drinks basically besides water. Which is kinda stupid honestly, like a full service restaurant doesn't have refills for soft drinks ??!  We tried the chicken Tom Yum, chicken pad Thai and Mongolian beef. All pretty good but It wasn't like super amazing. It was yummy. Once you've had amazing Thai food before you automatically compare it to every other Thai restaurant you go to. And if it doesn't meet those expectations it's kinda a buzz kill. But the foods still good. It's funny though how almost every Thai restaurant I go to, the pad Thai is different lol   The food was really good, but tasted similar to many I've tried before. It didn't have those amazing spices or exceptional flavor. Very good but basic Thai food. Nothing that popped out or was memorable that was any different to places I've been before.",

We enter the restaurant and the manager is up front. He does not greet us. We wait for a server/hostess to come and take us to our table. She places menus on a table near the door and says nothing. I have to look at the Manager and ask if we are being seated there. He tells us we are & I ask if we can have a table away from the door. He points to a table in the back corner and begins to seat another party. We get to the table and there are no utensils. The server comes and takes our order and it something simple. Tofu Pad Thai with sticky rice. A party of five is seated after us. Their food arrives first. My food comes; still no utensils. I ask for chopsticks and the server comes and tosses them on the table. I begin to stir my food and there is chicken in my Pad Thai. The server doesn't return and my attempts to signal their attention go unanswered. My boyfriend has to get up to inform them we have meat in our vegetarian dish. Plate is taken and food is remade. Still no utensils. Food comes back. I ask for chopsticks and get them. We watch other tables get chili sauce and the server follows up to see if they need anything else. Yet no one stops by our table ever. Finally, my boyfriend gets up to ask for a box and the check.   Bad experience all the way around. I won't be back. Ever.",

I could go on and on about Thai food and the other restaurants that we love, but then we wouldn't have anything for our future posts, so I'll keep it short; in terms of geographic convenience, Archi's Thai Bistro is a really great place to feed your Thai addiction!  We have a real bad addiction to Pad See Ew; the Soy coated flat noodles, which has a chewy, satisfying texture along with the crunch of Chinese Broccoli stems and my favorite protein-Pork and Egg it's unbelievably tasty!!  So I love all the Apps here, but it's impossible to order all of them in one sitting, so, we'll add updates to this post when we've come back and ordered more.  This time, we ordered the stuffed wings; boneless Chicken wings that have been stuffed with minced pork, clear noodles and vegetables that are then deep fried!  It's a miniature, pre-TurDuckEn type of App that, with the Plum Sauce, is a great starter. Protein component, check! Fried component, check!  Other great Apps-Chicken or Pork Satay, with the Peanut Sauces, it's pretty addictive.  As well, the Pla Muk Tod (fishcake) is awesome to tempt your palate before the main event!  The Soups are good too, I just can't have too much cuz I sweat way to much on my head eating hot stuff-but Tom Kha Gai is my favorite  There's just nothing like Thai Curry; I'm partial to Massamum or Penang Curry (I find that the sweeter curries create a balance with the heat) but I won't turn away a Red, Yellow or Green one from the table!  This time we ordered the Country Curry- a homemade Red Curry with a lot of vegetables in a lighter soup.  It's delectable!  YUMMM!

I LOVE Thai food, and I have been to many Thai restaurants, however Archie's in Las Vegas is the place that has great quality authentic Thai food. Also, I absolutely love their lunch special sections. They basically have a majority of my favorites on the lunch special menu, and it includes soup, salad, a fried wonton and a egg roll- and on top of that, it is not even expensive! Plus, another favorite thing about this place is their Thai tea. They serve their Thai tea in a big ass cup with small crushed ice! I love that because you are getting more liquid rather than ice. Plus, there's really no need for a refill with a huge serving of Thai tea like that! I love it! Lol  The decorations of the place and it's atmosphere is clean and elegant. I would to go here on a date with my honey if we were craving Thai food.   Overall, you got to come here! The food is amazing. If you love spicy Thai food, this is the place to go! You get to pick from a scale from 1-10 how hot you want your food to be. For me, a freakin' 3 is hot enough! Lol",

I didn't mind it since it is our fave Thai restaurant in Las Vegas.  That being said, I am Yelping about my most recent experience. It was a take-out order. One of the dishes I ordered contains shrimp and since my son doesn't like shrimp, I asked it we can have extra egg instead. Guy who took my order said, \"Sure, no problem.\" Did not say ANYTHING about it costing extra. When I picked my food up, I was not happy to see that I was charged $1.95 for extra egg. When I questioned it, his response was that they don't do substitutions and he should have clarified over the phone when I placed my order. Her offered to remake the entree without the extra egg. Really?? So it makes more sense to waste food instead of just taking off the $1.95??! And is it worth upsetting a long-time customer over $1.95??!  Guess we'll be looking for a new Thai restaurant.",

In retrospect, I've been to a lot of different Thai restaurants throughout my yelp career and this was one of my favorites. According to their accolades displayed on the window outside, it seems that I'm not the only one who thinks they serve amazing food.  We had a very large party for my sister's birthday and ordered family style for the entire party. The food came out very quickly and the portions were perfect. If you're not sure what to order, here are my favorites that are easy to like. My favorite noodle dish is called pad kee mao (spelled differently at some places) and it's a stir fry noodle dish that's really flavorful. The other is a ground meat and basil dish that goes best with rice! If you like things on the saltier side, try a couple dashes of fish sauce.  I was impressed by the papaya salad because I would normally never think of eating papaya, but some places don't make it well and it tastes like what fresh cut grass smells like. Ew. Instead it was spicy and the sauce got rid of the papaya taste. The other dish I normally don't order but liked was their beef panang.  Despite our large group, the service was very quick and attentive. I don't think my water ever went below half and I always had a glass of wine lined up after pounding the previous one. Yes, I know you're not supposed to pound wine. And no, I don't have a drinking problem.  ANYWAY, you need to come here and find out what you're missing out on.",

After confronting him about what he was saying he kept denying that he was talking about us and was talking about another customer but he clearly was talking about us.  Also even if it was really about someone else (which is a lie) you should NEVER speak about it in front of other customers! Like where is your sense of respect and common sense!?!?  Like I said I have some background on restaurant management and that attitude would never float with me and that employee would be fired right away!",

I can't say I'm well versed with the menu, but the Pineapple Fried Rice with Fried Tofu is very well worth it and the Pad See Ew is delicious. Thai Ice Coffee is really good too, if you're into it.  The staff could use some better training/hiring though. They are not very attentive. You'll see them upon ordering, delivering, and then the moment you are trying to get your check (sometimes I have to get up and do it myself at the front desk). Personally, I don't really care. I just don't tip in that scenario. However, it does not give the best impression for the restaurant as a whole.  Aside from that, it's one of my go-to thai spots.",

I'm so used to the typical small Mom and Pop diner feel in most Thai places around town. It was very clean, with comfortable booths and tables.   Service:  there was nothing too impressive nor was there anything disappointing about the service. It was just good service.   Food:  this is now officially my second fav Thai place. I enjoyed everything I had. We ordered from the lunch menu, which came with a soup started. It was like an egg drop soup meets chicken soup. It was decent, but after tasting one bite, I didn't want to waste my stomach space on it, so I gave it to a friend.  Spicy Basil Pork dish - (5/5) It was so good. It had a nice spice at level 4 outta 5 and a good mix of slight tart and basil.  Pad See Ew (not on lunch menu) - (4.5/5) very good!  Had a good flavor with big chunks of pork, noodles cooked perfect, and slightly bitter greens to balance the dish.  Pad Thai - I tasted this on someone else's plate and it was good, but too sweet for me.   Overall:  I enjoyed my food so much, that I would definitely come back. Folks at my table said there are other locations, but the food is the best at this one. I believe them.",

The food had an authentic flavor, and my dad commented that the beef salad was better than any that he's had when he lived in Bangkok. Typically, when ordering seafood as a choice of protein at other restaurants there's not much variety; however, here the seafood in the dishes included shrimp, fish, scallop and squid. The servings are quite large as well. You may also customize your dish spice level (1-10), which is always nice rather than leaving a surprise on your tastebuds.  As for the dishes themselves, the papaya salad was crunchy and well balanced between sweet, sour and salty. The beef in the beef salad was tender and wonderfully seasoned. The tom yum soup had a nice deep seafood flavor. And finally the pad Thai was a bit on the sweet side but was nicely offset by the peanuts (which I personally was happy to see a large serving of them).  The restaurant itself was spacious, service was quick and the staff was very attentive and courteous. Definitely lives up to its hype.",

The menu is typical Thai fare, portions are decent and prices are in line with similar restaurants. I had the yellow curry which was packed full of chicken and potatoes but it was thin and watery. The Pad Thai was pretty good but despite ordering a 10/10 on the spicy scale, the dish was not even a 5.The big tall glass of Thai iced tea was excellent and well worth the $4. Service was prompt and friendly. There are a couple locations around town and I am sure I'll be back to one of them in the future.",

They have a spice scale for each dish, so when you order they ask how spicy, and you're meant to respond with a number between 1 and 10. I ordered a 6, and it was perfect - I would not have wanted it any hotter. I tasted my friends' dishes as well - cashew chicken and pad see ew. YUM. Ordered an appetizer of 4 egg rolls, which were tasty, no doubt, but the star of the dish was the side of plum sauce. I could have drank a glass of that tangy sauce. Quick service, no wait for a table. Wait staff was pleasant, but we didn't have a designated waiter or waitress, which was a bit bizarre. My water glass was never even close to empty. Would definitely recommend! Excellent menu, great portions, amazing value.",

Our group decided to do family style this evening. The food we ordered were Tom Yum, Green Curry, Pad Cha Cha Cha and a papaya salad.   The papaya salad came out first. It was a decent portion. We decided to add minimal spice to this order. It was really good. I liked how fresh it was. It came with lettuce leaves as well.   The three dishes came next. Each one was ordered at a level 5 spice. Their spices are from 1-10. The tom yum, was delicious. Perfect level of sourness. We ordered chicken tom yum, but I know shrimp always goes well with this sour soup.   I tried the pad cha cha cha which had bamboo shoots and  seafood combination. It was delicious as well.   The green curry somewhat threw me off. The sauce seemed a little runny. Usually the sauce is thicker. I think it didnt have as much of that green curry flavor I was looking for. It was STILL GOOD, don't get me wrong, but just a little different. I did like that it wasn't too sweet.   The servie was exceptional. The staff was consistently checking up on us and always refilled our water. They were fast as well. I'll definitely come back.  Thank you.",

They have a good lunch menu and great prices but we had specific dishes in mind and oh did we have our full.  For those who are gluten allergy/celiac talk with your server not everything is as seems. I thought I was safe with the one dish and didn't realize it had gluten in it and the lady who took our order didn't pick it up either but that's no ones fault but my own as I didn't ask specificity about this dish (papaya salad) it has little fried shrimp in it and I didn't see it with the nuts on it till to late. How ever the other dishes that were order I asked she even had them make the drunken noodles gluten free. So my advice would be ask about everything. I would love to see Archie's as a company when they redo the menu add the symbols for allergies/vegan/vegetarian etc on the menu.  The place is clean . Toilets are clean.  It has a good vibe family/friend relaxed atmosphere. Prices are good. Food is wonderful.",

They have a really great lunch deal for $8-10 until 3 pm that everyone was taking advantage of. We ordered Pad Se Ew, and Papaya Salad. Delicious. We ended our lunch with mango and sticky rice! The manager was very friendly and I enjoyed Archi's.",

Before this place closed for months I came to dine in with my family and was ignored a few times when trying to get our waitress's attention.  We then complained to the \"manager\" about this issue.. but the manager didn't seem to care. His only response was that he would go and talk to her.... and so we waited and waited and still.... didn't get what we needed or any attention at all. At the end of our meal, a different server brought us our check. We explained to him how everyone was ignoring us and how upset we were... but he didn't really have anything to say about it except that he was sorry.   LAST NIGHT I ordered post mates and found a dead BUG in my papaya salad.... but that's not all....... I open the rice and find an eye lash hair laying right on top of it... so disgusted.",

I ordered the similar dishes as before: shrimp pad thai, curry beef, stuffed chicken wings, and papaya salad.  Be careful with the papaya salad, it can get very spicy! The stuffed chicken wings are exactly what you expect them to be but better. You do not find them around too often so make sure to order some! I highly recommend their house spicy sauce, perfect for every dish imo. I also suggest asking for the chili spice rack...  This place is great for the people who love spicy. As far as non-spicy, I cannot say much.  But for a quick and casual bite, this place would be a safe bet.",

    "text": "Archi's Thai Bistro location #2 was on my bookmarked list for quite sometime. I've been wanting to try this place out for a while now. My first visit was last week when I'd been craving Thai food! Normally I would go to the other location that closer to Summerlin (Sahara/Ft. Apache). This time I wanted to do a to-go order, so I placed an order via phone since the online ordering system was being goofy.   Approximate time for pick up was 20 minutes and when I arrived shortly after that my order still wasn't ready. While I sat and waited in the lobby I noticed there were a fair amount of others ahead of me so I assume the kitchen may have been backed up. When I received my food, I checked of course to see if everything was how it should've been. I ordered shrimp pad Thai level 8 of spicy, which wasn't as spicy as I would've liked... so the next time I'll order a 10!   Overall, I would give them 3 stars at best because I just didn't get that flavor and spicy level I would normally have received elsewhere. Also the customer service was lacking in the front as I watched others come in with issues on their online and phone orders. I'll possibly try them again in the future however I won't be going out of my way to do so.",

The inside is on the small side, and there was a short wait for a table. Staff were very friendly, and the menu has a large selection of dishes.   We started with the Thai egg rolls. These were excellent, crispy, and delicious. Then we went for the Beef Pad See Ew and the Chicken Pad Thai. Wow!  Both were excellent.  The meats in both dishes were tender, and both dishes had their own unique and delicious sauces. The noodles in both dishes were perfectly prepared, and the portions were definitely ample. The only slight ding - they served sodas in cans instead of having a soda fountain with unlimited refills. It's always so silly when restaurants do this, but it's not worth taking away a star since the food was so excellent!!",

We ordered the pad Thai noodles with beef & shrimp, NO veggies and a Thai iced tea. Our noodles came with ALL the veggies in them!! I absolutely HATE bean sprouts so luckily most of them were served on the side of the plate but there were still some mixed into the noodles. I had to pick them out of every bite   We also waited about 20 minutes for our food. Understandable due to lunch rush however, she never brought out my Thai tea! And no one checked in on us as we waited. I had to ask them for it when our food was delivered  Despite the service, the food is actually very good! We also got the spicy basil ground chicken and that was delicious!   We'll go back for the food but maybe just do take out next time",

For starters, we usually get the Chicken Satay or the Beef Salad. Their peanut sauce for the chicken satay is to DIE for! And the beef salad is so good that my mom was inspired to recreate it at home.   My sisters favorite dish here is the Pad Thai with tofu. She's a super pad Thai enthusiast and this is her go to place. It's saucy, flavorful, and comes in a big portion. Another really good dish here is the spicy basil chicken, i get spicy level 4 and it's soooo good. When I'm in the mood for curry, my go to is Panang Curry. It's creamy, spicy, and satisfying. Archi's also has good lunch specials on weekdays. Highly recommend this place! I al",

The dishes were less than $11 and there was enough food to have lunch, then take the remainder home for dinner. It was flavorful, without being too complex.

The catfish was pretty crispy even though it was smothered with the delicious sauce. I also got a tofu pad thai which was pretty average but still good! The Thai tea I ordered was pretty standard. I called in for a to go order and when I came to pick it up it was quick because all of the food was ready, I just had to pay and wait for them to get the Thai tea.

    "text": "VERY disappointed.  Somewhat disappointed in the food; hugely disappointed in the service.  I asked my Thai friend for a restaurant recommendation and she recommended Archi's Thai Bistro.  In preparation for lunch with a different friend, I had read Yelp reviews and made notes on what to order.  When we pulled into the parking spaces in front of Archi's, I realized that my Thai friend and her sister had treated me to dinner here back in August 2016.  Dinner had been good, but they knew what to order.  All I had to do was enjoy.  My friend uses a walker.  She was able to park immediately in front of Archi's in a handicap space BUT there is no ramp there.  She and I had to walk to the opposite end of the building to find a ramp that accommodated her walker.  And we had to reverse that exercise when we left.  One Yelp reviewer had recommended the Thai Iced Tea.  I asked the waitress if Thai Iced Tea is good.  She told me \"It's very good.\"  It should be; it's $5.95!  She brought me a huge glass at which time my friend told me that it's all sugar and coconut milk; a gazillion calories and tons of sugar.  I only had half a dozen small sips of it, partly because there was a spice I didn't like and partly because I'm diabetic.  I wouldn't have ordered it had I known it was full of sugar.  SUGGESTION:  When an obvious round-eye asks \"Is the Thai Iced Tea good?\" consider saying \"I think it's very good.  But not everyone likes it.  I'll bring you a sample.\"  And do that:  take a guest a small sample before committing that person to a $6 drink they don't like.  As I said, I only had a few sips of the Tea.  I did drain my water glass.  Not once did any of the staff members who walked past out table ever ask \"Is there a problem with the tea?\" of \"Do you not like this tea?\"  Even when we paid, and my glass was sitting near the edge of the table almost untouched, not one employee, manager or owner cared enough to ask if there is a problem.  I lived in Central America for more than a year.  Any time someone left food on their plate, we were asked if there was a problem.  Not at Archi's; guess they just don't care.  I wanted a cup of Tom Kai Ga soup.  Tom Kai Ga isn't on their menu, but Tom Ka Chicken and Tom Ka Shrimp are.  Based on the description, I think that Tom Kai Ga and Tom Ka Chicken are the same thing.  Ten dollars for an entree of that soup.  I just wanted a cup.  Not available.  I like Spring Rolls but saw that several Yelpers recommended the Thai Egg Rolls so I ordered and shared them with my friend.  I didn't like them.  Wish I had ordered the Fresh Spring Rolls that my Thai friend had recommended.  I ended up ordering a lunch special, Kung Pow Chicken.  It was fine but came with a cup of Egg Drop Soup that wasn't even warm and an Egg Roll that was soggy from sitting in the sauce from the Kung Pow.  I only had two spoons of the soup.  Again, no one asked if there was a problem.  We were asked three times if we were ready to order.  That's a bit annoying.  The waitress brought our check in the black portfolio, placed it in the middle of the table and said \"No hurry.\"  However, just a few minutes later, she came back and started to pick up the portfolio which was still in the middle of the table.  There was no credit card sticking out of it.  We hadn't moved it to the edge of the table.  We hadn't touched it.  SUGGESTION:  Teach your wait staff how to recognize a portfolio that is ready versus one that hasn't been touched.  After putting cash into the portfolio, I moved it to the edge of the table.  The waitress came by, I told her it was ready and that I did not need any change.  By then, the lunch crowd had left.  About 80% of the tables were empty, so my friend and I sat and talked.  And talked.  For an hour.  My water glass was empty; her Iced Tea glass was empty; and the pitcher of Iced Tea was on the divider behind my friend's head.  Not once!  Not once during an entire hour did a single person offer to freshen our drinks!  This is the thing I hate most in a restaurant.  At one point, I almost got up and poured tea myself into our empty glasses, but by then I figured we were winding up.  SUGGESTION:  Customers are customers until they leave the restaurant.  We don't quit being customers when we pay the bill, so continue to treat us as if you care about us and our business.  The food was adequate at best but, in all fairness, I know it can be good if you order the right thing.  BUT based on the horrible customer service, I will not return, nor do I recommend Archi's Thai Bistro.",

If they don't, they have a space tray where you can spice it up as you please!   The only downside is that service can be spotty. Sometimes I won't get water refills for a good minute. The staff are nice, though. This will forever be the spot to grab some delicious woon sen( glass noodles with seafood) and hoy Tod (clam omelette). And this is the only place I'll grab pad Thai from. I forgot to take pics of my meal .. I only took a pic of my Thai tea. That's why you know the dishes were really good. LOL .",

The inside is spacious and perfect for groups. It's pretty quiet too. The servers are very quick to take orders and clean up, overall excellent service.  So we ordered the Rad Nai, Ginger Ginger Ginger, Chicken Fried Rice, Tofu Pad Thai, and Panang Curry. Prices are pretty ok, because the portions make up for most of it. Like I've never seen such a big portion for pad Thai before. We don't know why but maybe because we had a big group, they could've gave us a bit more ;)  I personally LOVE Thai food so much, I'm down for it anytime. I've tried lots of Thai food all over and this place would be in one of my tops...for the Panang Curry. We got the chicken, and it was one of the bests I've ever had! I would definitely want to be back for the curry. The Pad Thai however, it wasn't as flavorful as I thought. We did order low sodium for every dish but it just lacked flavor and the texture was a bit too sticky. Honestly was one of the worst pad Thai I've had, my mom thought the same.  Really recommend this place for everything else except the Pad Thai.",

Rainbow location has much larger dining room than the flamingo, but the every location has the same great food quality.   The staff has their stuff together and makes your dining as enjoyable as possible.    I really like their lunch specials, and usually have chicken curry or Chicken pad thai.   If you're not into spicy...go with the number 1.   I usually order 5, and that's nice, but not too hot.     One more thing, don't forget the ice tea.",

    "text": "\"Archi's\" is a name that always comes up when people talk about Thai in this town. It wasn't until recently, though, that we realized we had one right down the street from us.  The variety on the menu had me sold the first time I pulled up their website. (You can also submit an online order for pickup, and the interface allows for customization.) For the first time, I wondered if I might deviate from my usual \"pad thai with tofu.\" The Pineapple Fried Rice, \"stir fried with tomatoes, onion, green onion, pineapples, cashews, raisins, egg and cumin powder,\" had me tempted.  In the end I stuck to my usual, though, beginning with deep-fried tofu to share and chicken satay for Mike. The tofu was unremarkable. Not very crispy, and the sauce was ordinary. Mike liked the satay. Not the very best in the city, but good.  Our opinions bounced upward with the arrival of my pad thai and Mike's \"Ginger Ginger Ginger.\" He's still talking about it. I found the pad thai such a treat that I'll probably finally get something different next time, just to see what else the chef can do. The pad thai tasted very similar to that at Panna Thai and Pin Kaow II - not too oily, medium-sized tofu, nuts on the side - but neither of those establishments have a menu that seems as well-suited to a curious vegetarian as Archi's.   Other Yelpers had warned readers about the heat, but we didn't heed them. Oops. We always order around a \"7.\" Archi's \"7\" was more like an \"8 or 9\" to me, and my husband - who tried my dish as well as his, said the Ginger-Ginger-Ginger tasted like a \"10 or more.\" Recalibrate accordingly. We're planning on asking for \"5\"s next time, and even then with some trepidation.  Service is reliable and the decor is light and classy, with photos in tasteful frames and natural light shining through. As you enter, Zagat accolades stand propped opposite the door. This restaurant is proud of what it does. I look forward to seeing them show off again.",

Hands down one of the best is Archi's Thai Bistro. Their lunch portions are more than any Thai place I've been to in town, but more importantly it tastes great and authentic. Their \"spice level\" is accurate. I like spicy and a 6 was perfect for me. Also, if you like Thai tea their cup size is larger than most. What this equates to is great value, and that's what I want. Top it off with great service and you have the recipe for a repeat guest ... me! Not surprised they won \"Best of Las Vegas\" in the recent past.",

    "text": "I love this place! The food is definitely authentic. It has a lot more authentic \"Thai\" food selection then other places. Even though I am Thai, I just don't understand why they have to include Chinese food in the menu. HAHA Maybe it's their marketing strategy, who knows. I always stick to the Thai food. I am at a Thai restaurant, right?!?! Anyway, the food never lets me down. I'd never be embarrassed to bring my friends who are not Thai to this place because the place is very nice and clean inside. I'm not saying \"hole in the wall\" food isn't great some times. The location isn't in a bad area either. Service is OK here. I never expect great service from an Asian restaurant anyway. HAHA My mother always says the original location is better but I have yet to try it since it's a little ways out for me. This Rainbow location is it for me for now.   I've always been there for dinner. I haven't tried the lunch menu. Dinner there has never failed me. This would be my number choice for Thai food in Las Vegas. Don't forget your Thai Iced tea!!!",

    "text": "Archi's is definitely my favorite place to go to for some good Thai food.  My friend took me to this place for the first time. Back then, I had chicken pad thai and she had thai beef salad (might not be the right name). chicken pad thai was really good. One thing I noticed about pad thai when I went back a couple of times, is that sometimes noodles are overcooked. I know this happens at any given restaurant, but it happened several times I went back. I have been getting chicken pad kea mow instead, and this is also a must-try.  My favorite dish here is spicy basil pork (you get a choice of chicken, beef, pork, shrimp, or combo). It's diced pork stir-fried with spicy thai basil. Also a must-try  You get to choose the level of spiciness for your dishes, which is nice. I usually get 5 or 6, I have tried 8 before.... well, that was a bad idea  Great place to stop by for lunch (they have some great lunch specials) and dinner!",

You know it's going to be crowded and risky if you'll even get in ... but you're so happy when you walk away with your shiny new toy.  In this example the new toy is Archi's in your belly.  It's nearly as good as the new iPhone but doesn't cost nearly as much.  So yeah the lunch time rush is crazy, maybe because it's good and the specials are cheap.  You can get a full plate of Phai Thai, salad and egg roll for under $8.  No wonder it's slammed at lunch time.  The food is constantly good and the spice levels are just right.  Anything over a 6, you'll feel the heat.  If you want to avoid the lunch rush, check them out for dinner.  It's a lot less crowded and it's the same damn good food!",

She wanted me to try it and see what I thought of it.  The service was pretty good.  The ambience was relaxing and good for groups.  In fact, there was a large group there while we were dining.  They have a pretty large dining area.    The Thai tea was good, just the way I like it.  You get a whole lot of it. It's got that authentic crushed ice and sweetened condensed milk.  I got the yellow curry with shrimp and it was really good. The consistency was just right. And I like how the vegetables, potatoes and onions were nice and big whole pieces not finely diced. It had more of a bite and soaks up the yellow curry sauce better.  This might actually be the best yellow curry I've had, dare I say. The white rice also had a hint of coconut flavoring and that was a nice and pleasant surprise.  I also had some pad thai and that was also good. I would have liked to try the desserts but I was way too full. Next time.",

On the bright side, we got a lot of rice with our order, and there was an abundant amount of chicken and veggies inside the curry. Couldn't exactly finish everything.  We went right before the lunch rush, so we got our table and order in pretty quick right before the place got packed. I would've liked their lunch special, but since I went on a 'holiday' (New Years Day), they weren't offering their specials :( The service we received was as expected from a busy restaurant.  I'd probably revise my review once I find the time to drop by again. =]",

The restaurant is just like any other; good service, clean place, and almost always has table open when I walk in. I usually order take-out since the restaurant is on my way home. My only dislike is whenever I call to place my order, I typically don't get through the first time. The restaurant always seems busy around 6pm because they never answer my call around that time. I usually have to call back 3 or more times before I get a person. Overall though, it is a great place with good food and decent prices. I will still come here for my Thai fix!",

    "text": "The food here is amazing. Very authentic and fresh. I love that their dishes are super spicy - everything had so much flavor. The Prig King was delicious and the beef with green beans was fabulous and very hot. Just what I wanted. I introduced my family to thai steak salad and never having associated salad with thai food, they loved it. The pad thai was perfect as was the crab fried rice. All the flavors came together beautifully.   So the food was great, however the service was horrible. We walked into the restaurant to place our order because their voice mailbox was full when we called. After placing the order, we were told it would be 20 minutes, so we had a drink at a place a few doors down. When we came back, it was another 20 minutes before we got our food. They totally didn't even start making it until we came back!  There were no apologies, just the excuse that they were super busy. It took forever to get our food and they were less than accomodating, so I'm super pleased that the dishes were perfect. It eased the pain of an annoying inconvenience.",

    "text": "This establishment does not mess around with the heat rating. Having grown up \"native,\" I'm the type to put food on my Tabasco. So when my boyz and I came down here one evening, we naively got 10s on all the dishes without a second thought. Several extra servings of rice, beers and crumpled sweaty napkins later, we conceded and affirmed the legitimacy of the chef's diabolical schemes.  The Thai tea also is less sweet than the competition, a plus for my poor blasted taste buds. Though I felt good about not lying when saying \"I was with several 10s that night,\" I definitely give thanks and praise to Archi for the curry brutality. My ass bleeds for you sincerely. Have I learned my lesson? Does the pope shit in the woods?",

    "text": "On an errand to pick up a Halloween costume, I called in an order to pick up some Thai food from Archi's. The nice lady on the phone told me my order would be ready in 15 minutes, although she did ask me twice to make sure I was aware I was calling the Rainbow Blvd location. I arrive about 12 minutes later and I see the waiter bringing my order to the counter. Perfect timing. Paid the bill and was on my way. Note: I was there on a Sunday around 12:15pm and only about 2-3 tables were being used. Kinda empty for prime time lunch.  After going to Archi's, I ran another errand and then finally headed home. When I opened the boxes, the yummy goodies were staring at me wondering what took so long. I ordered:  1. Pad See Ew - Stir fried wide rice noodles with Chinese broccoli and Thai soy sauce. Choice of meat included chicken, pork, or beef.  WOW. This dish was really tasteful. The noodles were perfect. Soft yet with a crisp of crunchiness. I chose the pork and it was sliced and tender. I got it with a 5 on the spicy scale and it had a nice kick without being overbearing. I would definitely order this again. For sure.  2. Fried Rice - Stir fried rice with tomatoes, onion, green onion, and egg. Comes with a choice of meats (chicken, pork, or beef)  This dish was also good. I wouldn't say its the best dish ever, but I would probably order this again after trying a few other dishes. The rice had good texture and it wasn't dry or oily. Good portions of meat as well.  I definitely preferred the Pad See Ew over the Fried Rice, but I'm not against ordering the Fried Rice again. I recommend trying this place. Maybe next time I will dine in and check out the atmosphere.  Pictures are included as well!",

They do a great job with the curry and I've tested their red, green, and massaman options.  Flavorful and they offer the level of spice you want (warning: 6 out of 10 on the heat scale lit up your mouth and I'm someone that always eats the jalapenos when I order Mexican).  The pad thai didn't blow me away, but it was solid and delicious.  I've had numerous dishes with chicken, steak and tofu and overall they do a good job.  Bottom line: you will not be disappointed eating at Archi's.  It's not the greatest thai I've ever had, but it's a solid choice and good for the price.",

I didn't get as much curry as I would like, got more giant chunks of potatoes and tofu, but it tasted good so I didn't complain.  I ordered a level 7 and it wasn't very spicy, perhaps due to my high tolerance of spice.  The food looked good and he service was decent.  I will say the decor needs to be updated though. I would recommend this to others for sure it was quite tasty, I'll just order a higher level of spice next time :)",

    "text": "I have never left a negative review on yelp before, but I'm willing to make an exception for the worst restaurant experience I have ever encountered in my entire adult life.    I order my usual chicken pad Thai with extra chicken (+ $2 tip) takeout order from Archi's almost every/every other Sunday since moving to Vegas.   Today I called for my usual order to pickup, except it seemed a little off. This time the phone rang 5 times before it was even answered, and I noticed the location wasn't disclosed through the greeting, which I was normally used to hearing. I thought that was a bit weird because normally the location is told to me when I call. But I figured I've been to Archi's numerous times and trusted in their service. I was told my order would be ready for pick up in 15-20 mins.  I leave my apartment shortly after hanging up and arrive at this location within 5 mins to pick up my order. As I await my order, Palm comes to see me and tells me that my order isn't showing up on their computer screen.   I had made the error of ordering my usual takeout order at the Flamingo location instead. I apologized on behalf of my mistake and tell Palm I would cancel the order at their other location and I'll order my takeout here instead. All the while I keep calling the flamingo location to cancel that order, but kept receiving the busy signal.   I called the flamingo location 5 times and none of my calls were ever answered. (I have a screenshot of my call log to prove this statement)   Palm then proceeds to tell me that I'm NOT ALLOWED to order my food at this location because of my mistake and have to drive to the other location instead. I couldn't believe my ears! I told him that I was a frequent paying customer at this restaurant, and was even trying to contact the flamingo location to cancel my order but kept receiving the busy tone. Once again he tells me it's too late, and I cant order here. Frustrated, I immediately ask to speak to the manager.  Lo and behold, the manager \"isn't in\" on Sundays. Instead I speak to Stan. I tell him I'm a frequent customer at this location who made the mistake of ordering at the wrong location. He tells me he can't make an exception and informs me that once again, \"I'm not allowed to order my food there, and I have to drive to the flamingo location to pick up my food.\" Meanwhile, he's telling me this while giggling and smiling. Completely unprofessional and rude to do while speaking to an upset customer. He proceeds to tell me (with a smile on his face of course), \"it's our policy.\"   This Archi's \"policy\" is NO WHERE stated on your website, yelp account, or restaurant. I've read through the entire Archi's website, and I haven't found anything even remotely similar to this statement.  What a horrible way to treat a repeated paying customer. I will no longer support this establishment.",

It was a bit hard to find parking at the plaza but i guess during lunch time everyone is hungry just like us right? Haha we were greeted by the host the moment we got in we were told the wait is going to be about 10 minute but we were seated in 5 minutes. Yay! As were browsing through the menu everything looks so delicious but we just got the lunch special cause we wanted a little bit of everything. I got the pad thai with egg rolls Tom yum soup and salad. To wash down my food i got a thai iced tea. Overall everything is super filling and delicious! Serve was great. They made sure our water was filled and if we needed anything, and if everything was good. I would come back again when I'm in town.",

Very large servings and came out on time. I ordered the mango sticky rice with my lunch special.  I was barely finishing my main dish when the front desk lady just left the receipt on my table. No words, no smiles... This is a pet peeve of mine. I find it rude that people handed receipts when they haven't even enjoyed their food.   When I looked at the receipt my mango sticky rice wasn't there. My dessert loving self stopped one of the servers and requested for it the second time. Again, sticky rice was good. But my receipt got handed back to me first even before the food came out.   Irks me to have that happen.",

We both enjoyed our meal.  They add spices according to your liking and tolerance level. I like my food a little spicy - but not hot. A three is perfect for me in the summer and a four in the winter.   I enjoy their Jasmine hot tea, the excellent service, clean restaurant, and atmosphere.",

I ordered the country curry because based off the menu it seemed to have come with a lot of vegetables. When the food came out they forgot the brown rice I ordered and there was no eggplant or zucchini in the curry as listed on the description. After I told the server they brought back steamed eggplant but it was about 6 very tiny pieces.   I would think because they forgot and that I didn't order meat with the dish they would not skimp out on vegetables but they did. It was not worth the money and the curry was nothing special.",

    "text": "Let me first of all say that I absolutely love thai food and once spent a summer in Thailand with some friends primarily for the food. I live for good thai food and this place has injected new meaning into my life. Ok so maybe that's an exaggeration, but seriously they're good. This was easily the best lunch special I have ever eaten in a Thai restaurant outside of Thailand, and it was reasonably priced too. After eating so many mediocre thai lunch specials during work, I have finally found one that is worthy of the drive.  The interior is clean and well kept. The staff consists of trendy young Thai immigrants who offer excellent service. I decided to try the pepper steak lunch special. The soup came first. It was Tom Khar Kai ( chicken in coconut milk) and it was pretty damn good. Not the best I have ever had but the flavoring was solid and clearly made with an authentic recipe. The salad was pretty much your standard thai salad with the sweet dressing. The eggroll was pretty impressive--MUCH better than the standard greasy hunk of dough you get at your average Chinese restaurant. The beef was excellent-- tenderly prepared and sufficiently seasoned, accompanied by an aesthetically pleasing arrangement of green and red bell peppers and sauteed onions. I devoured my plate and sent my compliments to the chef, who by the way, brought me the meal herself. That's another great thing about this place-- you can see them do much of the preparing in their open kitchen which holds them to a higher standard of food preparation. I tipped generously and bookmarked this place. I will have to come back here with my girlfriend and see if the dinner entrees are all that they are cracked up to be, but if the lunch special was any indication, I'm sure I'll be more than satisfied.",

This place was absolutely bone chilling on a cold October night!  Nonetheless, we decided we still wanted to give Archi's a try, so the host seated us.   The servers didn't seem to establish who our designated server was, so two of them came to ask for our drink order within seconds of one another. We weren't ready to order our meals so both servers came by twice to ask if we were ready, and when we asked for a few more minutes, they both came back literally a minute later. I can appreciate the attentiveness, but to be approached four times for our order in less than three minutes was pretty excessive and annoying.  When our waitress delivered our drinks, my Thai tea came with the straw wrapper submerged in the drink. Gross!  We ordered the Panang Curry and the Country Curry.  When the food came out, we saw that they mixed up our orders. We asked for steam tofu in the Panang Curry and fried tofu in the Country Curry, but they did the opposite.  Not such a huge deal though.  We didn't like the Country Curry at all, so we didn't finish it.  The Panang Curry, however, was quite delicious.  Unfortunately, we won't be visiting Archi's again.  There are other Thai restaurants in the neighborhood that serve the same, if not better, dishes for a lower price.  We weren't fans of the ambiance or the uncomfortably cold temperature inside.  Next!",

Each day of the week the lunch specials have their own designated soup, I prefer to go on Fridays when it comes with the chicken tom kha soup (chicken, coconut milk, lemongrass, cabbage, & mushroom). I like that I can choose my food's spice level from 1-10. Remember to save room for the coconut ice cream with warm, sweet sticky rice. My only criticism is that there are 3 locations and they are not equal. The Flamingo location is very small and feels run down. The Sahara location is closed on Tuesdays, has EXTREMELY slow service, and serves sodas in cans with a glass of ice so they can charge you for each one. Not cool, the other locations offer free refills. My advice is to go to the Rainbow location. Another helpful tip, if you're going for lunch, either go at 11am when they open or wait until after 1pm. If you go between 11:30-12:30 the line is almost always out the door with at least a 30 minute wait.",

I could eat here every day and feel like I'm not eating the same dish.  They have inexpensive lunch specials although, it would be difficult to pick just one dish so we usually do family style.  Wimps that we are started with a 0 spicy (on a scale of 0-10) but, have now migrated to a 2 (adventurous, I know!)  The little spicy kick is a great complement to the flavors and textures in their dishes.  This has become our go to restaurant with family and friends.",

They take our orders, with unpleasant faces, and deliver our orders without even asking if we needed anything else.  Halfway through the meal, we still don't get checked up by the server and STILL NO REFILLS for our water but when it's time to give our check, they're so fast at it.  No matter how many chances we give them, they still do the same. To be honest, I HAVE GOTTEN BETTER SERVICE IN MCDONALD'S THAN THIS. I highly don't recommend this location.

Sometimes it's very difficult to get them to pick up their phone, and just the other day when I went in for an order I placed 30 min in advance, they had told me they gave the order to the wrong person who ended up leaving with it and then said oh he's coming back to give it back to them to give to me.. which I refused, because I don't know about you but I wouldn't want good someone had taken for a drive.. so I ended up having to wait an additional 25 min for my food and was still asked to pay the same amount and not offered any reconciliation for the mistake they had made. I work in an industry where customer service is everything and where we do all we can to rectify situations when they're our fault and I feel nothing was done, just a \"sorry.. we'll make another\" and I was on a time crunch to get to a meeting, the reason why I called so far in advance. Hopefully the manager or owner sees this review and educates and coaches their staff on a better customer service. It would go such a long way and change a negative experience like this into a positive and even more reason to rave about you guys! Again love the food, five stars for that, but service, maybe 1 Star..",

It is the only thing I have ever had there, and I doubt I will change it up any time soon.   My first visit to Archi's was with the lovely Jaime W. for lunch. Every other time, I have gotten my meal to go. This place gets jam-packed at noon, if you are planning on having lunch here it would be a smart move to show up closer to 11.  Sometimes the wait just to pick up to go food is 5-10 minutes, with the wait to get a table just as long if not longer.  The lunch specials are $7.95 (unless you want shrimp) and you get the entree, a generous portion of steamed rice, a fried wonton and an eggroll (if you eat in I believe you also get soup). I have had better eggrolls and I throw away the wonton. The delicious ginger beef dish keeps me coming back week after week... It has baby corn, mushrooms, bell peppers, onions and a ton of delicious ginger.  Every other dish at Archi's may suck, and I may never know... but based on how busy they are day after day, I doubt it. If you like Thai, you should give Archi's Bistro a try.",

My go-to dish is the ground spicy beef or chicken basil. We almost always had leftovers to take home or at least enough to fill us up, but this time around, we barely had enough for the three of us! Such a downer.  They don't offer refills on Thai tea, no one really does except for a few places but your glass is gigantic compared to the soda glasses to make you feel some what ok for the lack of refills.  Service, well, it took forever for someone to refill my water, it took about 10 mins before anyone walked by for us to pay our bill. It wasn't horrible but it wasn't great.  There are a few Archi's in town, this one isn't really my fav, but when it comes to Thai food, I'd rather go to Basil 'n' Lime.",

The fish cakes and papaya salad came out and it was pretty tasty.   Two Spicy Basil dishes came out first. Next the Red Curry dish came out. Everyone was being polite and wanted to wait for my meal to come out. We waited for about 15 mins and their food started to get cold.   It was obvious that the server forgot about my order..  I checked up on it and the runner said it would be out shortly. I tried waiting as long as I could but got so furious that I lost my appetite. So we went ahead and cancelled my order. The server never apologized or checked up on us after the food was delivered..   They simply didn't own up to their mistake or see if I wanted something else to eat. I'm a server myself and I understand that mistakes happen. The server could have easily redeemed herself if she apologized.. Which she didn't!   But after this experience, Archi's lost me as a customer...",

Definitely recommend eating here for Thai cuisine, also sampled pad see ew and pad Thai and both were tasty as well.",

Whether if it is for dining in or ordering take out, it never disappoints us. Their lunch specials are the best with huge portions (including soup, egg roll, and fried wonton) which are decently priced. My two favorite dishes are their pad thai and pad see ew and my boyfriend loves their spicy basil. Last night, my boyfriend and I ordered take out for dinner- spicy basil with pork, pad see ew with beef, fried tofu, and sweet sticky rice with mango. Everything was hot and delicious.

    "text": "Want Thai? Come by! Archi's is the way to go when it comes to Thai food in this town.   This is Archi's is the second newest (or second oldest, however you want to look at it) location and the one I most frequent due to convenience. You can find this right off of 215/Rainbow. Archi's is great because it is consistently good.  I have never had to make a reservation, but this location can get pretty busy during peak lunch or dinner time. I have had to wait before so perhaps reservations, especially on weekends, is  recommended.   Food - 4.5/5 Love the Thai tea here.   Has a lot of authentic Thai selections. If you don't like spicy, you can order a 0 or a 1. I like doing 2 because I can't really take spicy foods but still like that \"bam\" the spicy flavor can offer.   Tom yum soup can be ordered with less spicy level.. It's naturally a little tangy so I found 3 extremely too spicy (and my mom, who normally orders a 5-6 found it perfect).   Papaya salad is great for starters. Would recommend adding a little spice to this because this isn't the sweet fruity papaya, its made using shredded green papaya so it doesn't really have a flavor. Tastes very \"green\" (like vegetables, health, etc.)  Eggplant and chicken dish was pretty good. LOVE the way the eggplants taste here. Complements plain white rice extremely well when mixed together.   Pad thai is always a safe choice (especially for new Thai food eaters). There are peanuts here though so BE AWARE if you have allergies. You can get it with your choice of meat so that's personal preference, but it tastes universally good! And the pad thai made here is delish! This tastes good to me as a 1 :)  Pad see ew is another safe choice for Thai beginners. Can be on a little salty side sometimes but this is one of my favorite dishes as well.   *****LIFE PRO TIP: Order the mango sticky rice for dessert if you're in mango season. You will thank me. Unfortunately they only make this when mangoes are in season, but that's how you KNOW they are fresh!   Price - 5/5 I prefer to eat family style here just so we can get a little bit of everything. However, portion sizes are big enough to where you can order one dish entirely for yourself.   The pad thai, pad see ew, and tom yum soup have been a single dish for me and sometimes I will have some left over. The papaya salad is great for sharing but I suspect not enough for one dish.   Great portions for the price. Family style can consist of 2-3 dishes (4 if we want to bring some home for tomorrow's lunch...) for the 3 or 4 of us. This includes white rice. The price comes out relatively cheap per person this way, about $7-10   Service - 4.5/5 Nothing ever spectacular but nothing bad either. Consistently good service and helpful employees.   All in all, a staple Thai place in Las Vegas. So happy the owner has grown to be able to open up 3 locations across the valley... Well-deserved success!",

    "text": "Omg! Back to Las Vegas and once again, have to stop by this amazing Thai Restaurant. This place is so freakin good that I would drive here just to have lunch or dinner. I am still waiting for one to be opened in Orange County, Ca. That would be like close to winning the lottery. Please Archi's put one or maybe 10 in California. I wish every Thai Restaurant owner must get trained my Archi's chef prior to opening their own Thai Restaurant. Seriously readers, I am not over exaggerating or being dramatic, this place is that good and super consistent. If you try it, you will be an instant repeat customer. Don't believe me? Try it, this is my only addiction!  Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh, so good.  Price: 5/5 Cleanliness: 5/5 Atmosphere:5/5 Quality: 5/5 Quantity: 5/5 Desserts: 5/5 Side dishes: 5/5 Side sauces: 5/5",

Their food has never disappointed me. From my most recent visit there, I got the chicken pad Thai, beef pad see ew, and the basil beef (don't worry it wasn't all for me, I shared). What I loved most was the fact that the noodles for the pad Thai and pad see ew weren't dry and it was not too greasy unlike some other places I have tried. Their basil beef is also soooo good. They use ground beef and basil leaves and you can actually taste the basil. This time that I went, the chicken was a tad dry in the pad Thai so that's probably the only con I can think of. I also got the Thai iced tea and just to warn you, it is pretty sweet so I diluted it with my water a little. Other than that, I'll be back Archi's!!!!",

I was eating my chow mein and found a bug in the food. I was instantly completely grossed out and called the restaurant. The person who answered my call was not empathetic and only said sorry. He offered that I could come pick up a new dish, while completely missing the point that we paid for delivery. He then apologized again and hung up in my face. Moreover, did he think I would EVER eat there again??? My co-workers didn't even bother looking for bugs in their food and went to get food elsewhere. I'm never eating here again. The service was insulting. I will definitely be contacting the health department on this uncaring establishment.",

I like going to this location because it's closest to where my mom lives and she loves Archi's with a passion. Plus it's right next to the Rainbow and 215 south beltway where there are also a ton of pretty good food options as well.  The food here is my favorite Thai food in Vegas. My go-to picks are: chicken tom kha (sour soup with coconut milk), crab meat fried rice, chicken panang, chee choo catfish curry, shrimp pad see ew, and of course, Thai tea! If you like coconut, try their coconut ice cream. I order all my food NOT SPICY. But they do offer an option of spicy levels from 1-10.  Not once have I ever had bad customer service here. I've been a loyal Archi's customer for years and I will continue to keep coming back.",

We ordered the seafood soup which was ok, beef salad it tasted better the first time I ordered it and the red curry with chicken lunch special. The red curry sauce tasted good very well seasoned and flavored but it didn't have enough chicken. It seems like I ordered bamboo shoots with chicken. The bamboo shoots overpowered the amount of chicken that they put into the dish. Maybe because it's lunch special I don't know...not sure if it's like this if a LA carte is ordered. Will still come back next time hopefully they put bigger pieces of chicken next time. We also ordered sweet sticky rice with coconut ice cream. It was delicious.",

Not too salty.    We had the stuffed chicken wings and the rice paper rolls (sping rolls), they were some adventures choices of food.  They were ok, I love it, it was always fun to try new food.  The wings were too meaty for my taste.  The spring rolls were very different from the Vietnamese restaurants, it was different.  My hubby thinks the menu was too generic, nothing special nor surprised.  Well I kinda agree with him....",

    "text": "I've been a loyal Archi's Thai bistro customer since 2007, however, due to several bad experiences my desire of going back slowly getting less and less, here's what happens: 1. Several time I noticed my mouth has bad after taste whenever I tried their beef or pork, so my face would break out really bad a day later, so it is possible their meat quality weren't that good. 2. One time I arrived there early, but I'm still waiting for 2 other friends to get here, I already know what to order to save time since my friends have to drive all the way here from other side of town, however, restaurant would not let me order even though I told them the 3 dishes that I'll be getting, their reason is they can't take order if not all of my party shows up, but here's what's weird, they are going to charge those 3 dishes, and I AM still going to pay for all of the 3 dishes anyway, why do they care if all my party arrive or not? Of course all my friends show up later on as promised, but I wasted 15~20 minutes extra wait time while they could've just take the order and have the food ready when my party arrive. 3. Since that incident, there was this one particular waitress (she always has a pissed off look on her face, never any smile) begin to avoid me on purpose whenever I go to the restaurant.  One time I even saw her signal another waiter to serve me even though I'm sitting in her serving area, how unprofessional is that? Not to mention one time I even saw her and another person from higher up flirted with each other at the restaurant, totally gross.  No wonder she's still working there despite how horrible she performed. 4. They used to have a waiter who handles giving out water, but I notice he's like a robot, he just came and put in water without any eye contact and he just mumbles \"do you need water\", before I can even say No, he already put water in it, because he makes no eye contact, no wonder I don't see him work there anymore.  Despite the negative experience I had, they were good at something: 1. They are excellent when it comes to seating customer during busy time.....except that one time I arrived there early without all my party 2. Food is always good and taste consistent. 3. Besides that horrible waitress I mentioned, almost most of the waiter or waitress there are very good.(you will know who is good, good one will always smiles to you)  Good bye archi's, you've been good until the bad customer service, time for me and my friends to move on to a restaurant with more friendlier and more professional customer service.",

This spot is perfect for that!  We came during lunch time (noon) and I was pleased to find their lunch menu. We, also, came before the big lunch crowd.   Ordered the sweet and sour tofu and he got the tofu pad Thai lunch special, along with his Thai beef salad.   Our lunch soup of cucumber chicken soup came out and I was kinda weirded out at cucumber soup but, after tasting it --- I was like \"this tastes like chicken tinola\" WOW! After that, I was looking for it on the menu thinking I could just eat that and rice. It was perfect for the cold winter weather!    After eating my soup, I ate his while he worked on his Thai beef salad. Again with this salad, I never got what his big deal was with it so, I tried it again and I guess I liked it. It was a couple years since trying it. Maybe my taste buds are changing but, u liked the spicy and sour; and all the textures of the salad. I'm \"big on texture.\"   Our lunch specials came out and was very satisfying. Just enough to ease the hunger and even with some lefties to spare.",

They have items such as pad thai, red curry, kung pao, spicy basil, broccoli...select the entree with beef, pork, chicken, tofu, veggies or shrimp for only $7.95.  The lunch entree includes soup, side salad (which is very simple), egg roll and a pork wonton.  I chose the beef red curry, level 5 (1-10), and I packed up 3/4 of my entree to go and shared that with Earl for dinner.  This red curry was delicious.  The beef was tender (thank goodness), and there were lots of bamboo shoots in here.    I also had the thai milk tea and it was potent and yummy.  Word of caution, it is filling.  I  believe the reason why I only finished 1/4 of my curry was because of this large glass of  concoction.    Service was quick, and we all were happy with our selection.  Recommend!",

I was always trying to call to place a to go order (about 3-4 separate occasions) and they would never pick up. Apparently you have to do it online which is perfectly fine with me, but what about those who do not have internet? I ordered online and I got a call probably about 5 minutes later. They wanted to tell me that the prices online were incorrect and that it would be an extra 4 bucks total. I said it was fine because I was totally craving Thai. I was a bit peeved though since they had this whole order thing online that their prices were not correct. They should have offered me the price that was shown online regardless. However, I'm sure they have fixed this problem by now...I assume as this was about a month ago.   We decided to come here for dinner on Saturday after the mall. We ordered the Beef Pineapple Fried Rice and the Chicken Pad Thai. The fried rice was delicious but too spicy for me. I've become some kind of wuss with spiciness now only because it burns my stomach. The pad thai was a huge mistake. A soggy mess of noodles. There was way too much tamarind sauce and the noodles were overcooked.  Service was attentive, but bring a sweater ladies...its freezing in there. Overall, Archi's is a decent Thai place, but it's definitely not my favorite anymore.",

We ordered the Tom Yum soup and originally I was surprised to how expensive it was for just a soup, but the waiter assured me it easily splits between 4 people, but he was wrong because we could have had 8 at our table and it would have been plenty! The flavor was on point with plenty of largely cut chicken and vegetables, but we ordered a spice of 5/10 and thought it was more of a 7-8/10. Nonetheless delicious. My daughter ordered the chicken noodle soup and she liked it, but my son tasted it and thought it was somewhat bland, but he's older and his taste buds are more developed. It had plenty of noodles and chicken. My son and I shared the chicken and tofu pad thai which was amazing, again, a very large dish. Spice level was supposed to be a 9/10 and the waiter said that pad thai typically doesn't get too spicy, but we figured at a 9, it should. It felt more like a 3-4/10 spice which was disappointing. It was a bit oily as well due to the fried tofu but overall the flavors were very good and no doubt I would return again. Prices are excellent as well.",

They have an extensive menu, and they cook everything from a spice level 1 (not spicy) to a spice level 10 (my mouth is on fire!).  The prices are very reasonable for the amount of food that is served. My favorite dish is the Pad Ka Pow, however, their Tom Kha soup is also tasty. On a chilly Autumn night, there's nothing like a bowl of warm Tom Kha. The hints of cilantro and coconut milk really make for a pleasant experience.   Why 4 stars instead of 5? I made the mistake of ordering the Beef Salad, and the meat that came with it was quite fatty. Also, there service is 'ok', but not great.",

I was surprised with their beer menu, which had some very interesting imported stuff on it. Not your typical Thai restaurant offerings.   We ordered the fried tofu appetizer - I've had better. The fried part barely made a thin shell. The tofu was very very soft on the inside - not other thai fried tofu I've had which was are cooked more thoroughly.   I ordered the Thai Green Salad - nice combination of shrimp, chicken, and fried tofu, but the sad romaine lettuce left something to be desired. My partner ordered a curry, which was outstanding. Will opt for something a little more filling next time.  Archi's...you get 4 stars nonetheless because your wait staff was nice, food came out relatively quick, and overall, it was not too shabby.",

She always, always gets green curry.  The tofu was deep fried which complemented the curry very well and frying it makes sense so the tofu stays together in the hot broth.      I got the country curry with shrimp only because it had the most ingredients listed on the menu.  That had eggplant, mushroom, bamboo shoots, green beans, baby corn, basil, zucchini and a few other things in a red curry base.  I had that at spice level 5 which was a quality burn for me.

I was not impressed with their lunch special selection. The price of $7.95 was decent for the amount of food you get, but they charge extra $1 for brown rice substitution. Really? Around thirty percent of the lunch menu was chinese food, and I don't come to a Thai restaurant to eat the goopy concoction that is sweet and sour chicken. They did not have Pad Kea Mow (drunken noodles) as part of their lunch menu. Bummer.   I opted to skip the lunch menu and order my drunken noodles with chicken ($9.95) anyway. The portion was large and the taste and quality of ingredients used were superior to many other Thai restaurants. The chicken was cooked perfectly and was not dry -- a feat only few have been able to accomplish.  The service was a bare minimum. There was no personal interaction; it was drop off your food/drink and quickly run off. I get it, it's busy... but you're doing well so stop being stingy and hire more wait staff. They never brought out Jessie B.'s hot tea, but it was on the final check. She did take it off, but that is carelessness and lack of service at its best.  I'd come back for the food if in the area again, but I wouldn't rush off to drag people here from the other side of town.",

    "text": "Great price, delicious food, slow service  Pad See Ew with beef is a good go-to dish - generous, packed with flavorful, savory noodles. Had this with the pineapple fried rice and shrimp - also a great combination and taste. Presentation of the pineapple fried rice could be better but forget all of that - it was delicious.  Mince chicken was packed with spices and flavor. It's a well done dish and delicious with the pineapple fried rice.   Service was slow. Took a few minutes to be noticed at the front when walking in on a Friday night (the restaurant had many tables open). Took a while for them to come and take our order, check up on us, etc - I was surprised. Servers are nice - just slow.   Bathroom is clean, so I trust that the kitchen is clean.   Overall, this is my 3rd time and this restaurant is great. What brings the people is the quality of the food for the price.",

Service is always great. I don't think I ever remember have bad or mediocre service here, and the food always comes out just in time. I'm giving it 4 stars because the food to price ratio doesn't match to me. I always end up either ordering more or stopping by somewhere later because I'm still hungry. I think they should either lower the price or add more food. Just my opinion.",

I try not to spoil myself so I go only when friends are in town. I usually do that if the place is pricey but it really isn't. My friend once told me while eating at another Thai restaurant, later to be reviewed that Archie's had the best Pad Thai. I have never been and got scolded for the simple fact that this place was 5 minutes down the street. The lunch portions are a good size and include egg roll, Won ton and soup. The service is good even when they misplace your order. Yes that has happened to me here but it was an accident. I took my father in-law who I have no idea what he wanted to I over ordered and enjoyed every dish. Friends did enjoy the basil chicken which is becoming a favorite at most places now. There are three locations spread around town.  Enjoy!",

    "text": "Anyone who gives this place 4 or 5 stars must be either smoking crack daily or has never had good thai food. Since moving here in February we have been to Lotus of Siam probably a dozen times and it has never even approached disappointment. I live much closer to Archi's Bistro and got the thai bug we decided to check it out. I browsed the menu online and it looked pretty good and quite reasonable. Curries and entrees were advertised as being in the $8-11 range, but when we sat down and saw the menu they had pasted higher prices over the old ones so it was actually $10-15. We ordered a Tom Yum Koon(soup), Panang Curry, Basil Chicken, and a flat noodle and veggie dish I can't remember the name of. The soup was okay, but the broth was watery and the shrimp were overcooked and a bit rubbery. The thai basil had ground chicken which is very strange ingredient choice for a $15 entree, and was also quite a small portion. The panang was okay but waaay to greasy and oily the sauce was broken and kind of cold. The flat noodle was kind of like a chow fun with basil and green bell peppers, this was the best dish we had even though I said no meat and they gave us chicken for an extra $2. The staff was pretty much all high school kids from what I could tell, polite but hardly professional for what they are charging for run of the mill thai food. I was and am very disappointed in my fellow yelpers for rating this place so highly. I will never be back even for take out. There are places that are just as good for much less money, and places that are much better for the same prices. Don't waste your time and money, just make a reservation at Lotus of Siam...",

A LOT better. whew! at first they did give us a run around from booth to booth but third time was a charm and we were seated. our waiter was a young man who was nice. we also had my nephew in hand and he was helpful with water questions for Lennon's bottle. Our orders were taken and when the food came out everything was well with the archi food world again. i also must add that it was brought out in a promptly manner so we weren't waiting for almost an hour again. YAY! most of us ordered our food at spice set at 6, but we all agreed it was a lot stronger than last time. i'm not complaining though. i opted for something different from my normal pad see ew though and got the red curry with veggies. i don't know why i haven't gone back to that dish in a year, but it needs to happen more often. everything was so flavorful and they gave me so many veggies! i was pleased. they did forget to bring out Dan's thai tea though. maybe next time he can get his fix. I up'd the stars, but i want to go back one more time soon to make sure the service is still improving from last time. I will keep you guys posted!",

Our party of four ordered the chicken skewers as an appetizer. The peanut sauce that comes with the skewers was absolutely fantastic and it paired very well with the red wine we ordered, a nice surprise.  We all ended up having the pad kee mao and it really hit the spot. The noodles were thick and not too oily like some other places. The vegetables tasted really fresh and healthy. Everything was just simply delicious!   Service was speedy and friendly. I never had my water even go below halfway! Prices are very reasonable for around $10 an entree and portions are definitely generous and share-able.   I would definitely recommend Thai Archi's and will make a visit the next time I'm back in Vegas!",

Archis makes their beef a little bit different than I'm used to, however it ended up being better. Instead of throwing in chunks of meat, they instead pounded it so that it almost had a ground beef (but not) look to it. The texture was very soft and the taste was on point. I like things pretty spicy, an 8 here isn't too spicy, next time I'll do 10  My friend is a very picky eater, so picky last time we had Thai, he got chow mein. I had him get the pad Thai this time and he loved it so much he had it both days in a row.  My second trip I got the kung pow chicken/shrimp combination. Again, it was on point.   The prices here are reasonable for the quality of food you are getting. I'd highly recommend this place if you like Thai, or are interested in having Thai for the first time.",

    "text": "I had looked over my past reviews and felt compelled to write an update as it has been several years since my last visit, literally.  I have to admit I let the one, although pretty bad, experience keep me from dining at Archi's for quite some time.  I returned only because my girlfriends wanted to meet for Thai and I wanted to enjoy their company.  I'm glad I went!  The place was packed around 1pm (assuming most diners were from the office spaces surrounding ).  It had a great energy and service ran smoothly considering the rush.  The lunch specials they had to chose from all looked amazing and was a pretty good deal.    I decided on the chicken red curry lunch special and a thai iced tea.  The special came with a soup and egg roll.  I found the portion just right for $8.  The red curry had just the right amount of spice but the flavor was out of this world!  The ingredients were fresh and chicken broke apart easily (not chewy!) I love Thai iced tea but thought it was a little too much on the sweet side.    Overall, I enjoyed the lunch special and will return soon!   4/5 stars bc the Thai tea was too sweet and I found the soup (side on the special) was a bit generic in flavor..",

Each visit, the food has tasted better and better as we make our way deeper through the menu. We have no intentions of stopping this relationship anytime soon.  Today we may have hit the jackpot with our order of Shrimp Pad Thai (Spice level: 3) and Garlic Pepper Chicken (Spice level:6). Both were extremely fresh and served piping hot. The shrimp wasn't over cooked and the chicken was liberally sauced so that the broccoli could help mop it up. Yum! Perfect combo of two dishes, one sweet and one spicy.  Every person around us was eating lunch specials which looked delicious and perfectly sized. However, we were there to grub and two entrees filled us perfectly and even provided leftovers. Archie's is consistent and the wait if always quick. It may not be the best Thai food you will ever have but it is satisfying and delicious. I'm good with that!",

I asked about their curry sauces and the waitress said that all had shrimp paste in them. So no curry if you have a shrimp and or shell fish allergy. Not all Thai restaurants put shrimp paste in their curries. So it's good to ask. I had the Pad Kea Mow. Fist time having this. I had men with chicken. It was very very good. I also had the this iced tea. It tasted as if the tea was stale not fresh. Also, when your check comes don't expect someone to ring you up while you wait. You'll be waiting forever. I ended up paying at the front where you come in. This place would have gotten 5 stars but if it weren't for the lack of pleasant attitude from my waitress and the gentleman who checked me out. They seemed like they couldn't be bothered but *sigh* doing our jobs. There was a waiter there who did check on me and waited on other tables and he was really nice! Plus the Thai tea tasted stale. Otherwise. I will be going back. Great food and dining area!",

    "text": "Let me just state this to be clear: I have been here multiple times and I would typically give it 4 solid stars, but today I wish Yelp can give negative stars. I start this review by stating I will never, ever come back to the Bistro - Kitchen all the way!   My husband & I got here at noon on the nose today and though it was pretty packed, we got seated quickly towards the back. A few minutes later a screaming baby came in - that should have been our sign to haul ass out of there but we were starved.   Both of us ordered the same dish, the red curry with tofu, just at different spice levels - mine a 2, his an 8 (I don't even know how he does that, but I digress!) and very clearly, as the lunch specials have starters with meat typically, tell the waitress that if any starters have meat in them, please don't bring them. She repeats, \"No meat!\" and goes off to the kitchen.   Ordering is almost 10 minutes into our sitting in the restaurant. During this time, a party of 7 come in (the ones with the kid screaming like a banshee notating our exact location in hell), and the couple next to us have left and have been replaced by another two guys.   Still waiting.   The guys next to us get served. And leave. And still no food and hardly any sign of our waitress. Around the 12:40 mark she comes out and says it'll be just another minute and half apologizes while trying to scurry away from our table.   12:43, our meal finally hits the table. Guess what folks? Both are red curries - with chicken. HOW DID SHE NOT NOTICE THIS?! It took a single glance to realize it was chicken - their tofu is very distinct and looks nothing like chicken. After a minute of disbelief, I have to flag down the waitress who assures me she said tofu - oh really?? Well it does not matter what you said but that's not what came out and you should have you know, looked at the dish you were about to serve. She apologized, ran back and served our spring rolls that came with the lunch while we waited. After 10 minutes she also offered some Thai tea but we were both not in the mood - I just wanted to eat and unfortunately this gesture did not make up for the fact that our food was late and she couldn't even glance down at the food she was serving.   We finally get our correct dishes at 1 PM. The curry is decent as usual, but we were so ridiculously disappointed by this point and the busy restaurant we came into was completely cleared out. Yes, the party of 7 had left before we got our second dish.   This kind of issue is completely inexcusable and I am sincerely amazed that they even bothered to give us a check after waiting so long AND screwing up BOTH orders. I really love their curries and their willingness to cater to vegans, but if this were my first time here I might have actually tried to eat the curry and I can guarantee I would have had a fit of epic proportions.   The only good thing to come out of this is I'm going to learn to make Thai food at home. Goodbye Thai Bistro, you will never see my face again.",

    "text": "Pulling into the small parking lot there were no aromas coming from the restaurant; a small quaint, cozy decor matches with the intimacy of the Thai culture. When you step inside, it looks like a modern bistro with a Southeastern touch that lets you know that you are in a Thai restaurant. Inside the restaurant you can smell the fresh herbs that are used in the dishes such as the mint leaf, basil, lemon leaf, ginger, lemon basil and of course the chilli. The dominant aroma were definitely more citrusy. However, the aroma was not overwhelming. The place is well ventilated, clean, and the layout of the tables were carefully thought out. It is a good size bistro, not many people during the hours that I went but it was quiet yet very welcoming.  The dish that I ordered was the Pad Kee Mao. The Pad Kee Mao is a pan noodle that is stir fried with an assortment of herbs and chillies. It is salty yet there was a perfect harmony that was created with the balance of salt, sugar and spice. You will also get a hint of the citrus from the basil and lime juice which is refreshing, and it contours well with the spice from the chilli. The texture of the noodles were soft, smooshy and not overly cooked to where it taste hard and charred; there is a smooth texture to it and sometimes may feel slimy but that is just from the flavorful sauce it creates when stir frying pan noodles. Pad Kee Mao can be cooked with your choice of chicken, beef or pork. I had the chicken because I did not want to feel the the stringiness of the chicken with the smooth texture of the pan noodles. That is just my preference but it is only a matter of your taste.",

The pad thai is pretty solid - they make it pretty perfect in my opinion (well, most of the time - it was a little off a couple times during the lunch special).  If you want noodles and not pad thai, try the pad see ewe, they make it good too!    One of our fav dishes is the pad ka pow chicken (basil ground chicken).  We also sometimes get the yellow or red chicken curry.  The sauce is not as thick as I'd like it to be, but  it's still super flavorful.  I wish they would give a tad more rice, but the portions are still a great size.  On their scale of hotness, we always get 5 - its just enough heat for us (although I've heard its too spicy for some people).  I definitely recommend Archi's.  I can't speak for other locations, but the one on Rainbow is awesome and we keep coming back.",

The thai ice tea was a bit strong too.It used to be smooth and creamy to the taste. The appetizer with Chinese sausage was good  it is a new taste for me. They were nice enough to take out the  pad thai from our order . I was kind of disappointed because pad thai is a very basic and important to the Thai restaurant menu. The prices were great for the portions of food they give but the taste was a little off. Great ambiance  but I just want my pad thai more authentic. Thanks I also ordered sukiyaki but the server said I did not order or he did not hear me.I waited and waited to find out that he did not put the order in.( We ended up eating somewhere else because i was really hungry after this.",

    "text": "I go to Archi's several times a month as it is close to my house and work.  My only complaint is the inconsistency in the spice levels.  I always get yellow curry and at least 1 in 3 times I get it, it is way too spicy that it is almost inedible.  Throughout the years, I keep lower and lowering my spice level.  I am at a 2 or 3 now and still at times it is just way too spicy.  However, when they get it right, it is amazing.",

So we didn't get our food until 45 minutes later.  Unacceptable for management to run a place like this.  The place was not even busy.  This loyal customer will not be loyal no longer. Two other parties received their food before we did and they got seated after us.  Poor  management style that caused a bad dining experience and lousy tip for employees.  The only good thing is the food.",

They have a few locations now since I first discovered them roughly 10 years ago and their S. Rainbow location is their \"fancier\" one. I would recommend this restaurant to everyone and I can't wait to back for another dose of their Pad Thai dish. Also, their Tom Yum soup is one of the best I've had so far.",

Neither are nearly as good as Lotus of Siam (  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Ftinyurl.com%2Fl8hr9w&s=138b0fa43f0058542a99ac25ff64d267feb34bc2d5c9245dbd76c467fadcb300\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">tinyurl.com/l8hr9w</a> ).
