Ellis Island was recommended by a bellman at the Wynn. Yes a bellman at the Wynn. He said, \"you're going to wonder why I would send you to a seedy casino for breakfast but it is really delicious, priced nicely and they serve breakfast 24hrs a day\".  Ellis Island is always the must stop hang over breakfast before heading out of Fabulous Las Vegas. They have steak and eggs specials and make your own omelets deals. The service is fast, friendly and I have never left disappointed.   Love it!",

    "text": "Trying to figure out where to go to dinner in Vegas, for a local on The Strip, can be an epic task not to be taken lightly. The dilemma always is price versus convenience versus quality.  The Ellis Island Cafe happens to meet a sweet spot in the above dilemma. Their wait times to get in are usually 45 minutes to an hour, but after a few turns of nearby slot machines and a beer, your number is usually called.  Be nice to the staff because they like regulars. I've even brought groups of friends to eat here, they seemed to like the pub atmosphere.  Beer is made on-site, is cold and competitively priced. The food is decent enough and the steaks are pretty good. I really like the thick cut steak fries and the soups are tasty.  If you are in need of a place to have dinner without the sticker shock of a Vegas Strip restaurant, try Ellis Island Cafe, located one block East on Flamingo behind Bally's Casino.",

It never came and they charged me. When I brought it up, they questioned me for about 10mins accusing me of drinking it. WTF?!

Did I mention this plate was only 6.99. All the food I saw brought to other tables were huge portions.

    "text": "Last visit to the Ellis Island Cafe was a couple of years ago when the Canadian dollar was at par (sigh).  At that time, we arrived late into Sin City to discover that our room was still not ready at 11 pm.  Took a very long stroll to these digs and we were introduced to the excess that is Vegas!  Had an incredibly large omelette which could easily have satisfied both myself and my husband.  This time in Vegas, we showed up to a much busier restaurant at 9pm and found that not much had changed.  Ordered the broiled chicken breast, green beans and side (I chose rice pilaf) and was shocked that I'd also get a choice of salad or soup with all that for $8.99!  Even the wimpy dollar can't cringe at that!  Again, food easily could have been split for two as the plate arrived with a cup of rice and a cup of beans and TWO chicken breasts.  Salad was a mundane affair of iceberg lettuce, croutons and grape tomatoes, but not too bad for the price.    My husband had a huge chicken baja wrap and fries and was happy with his plate.  Overall, another good experience with the food.  Only minor complaint was that the service had slid a bit compared to our prior visit (eg no one took our drink order for more than 10 minutes and the water didn't arrive at our table for 15 minutes  after that and food took quite awhile to show up) but overall, we'll chalk that up to how busy it was.  Can't wait to go back later this week for one of their weeknight $6.99 specials!",

They also have very good soup. The steak is OK, but the garlic green beans are awful.  However, they got the wife's order wrong on the last two visits. And there always seems to be some group making a lot of racket - and this time it was the wait staff yelling across the restaurant at each other.   Speaking of wait staff, the first waitress (who seemed to have recently escaped from a Russian prison) walked up and stood there with pen poised over paper, when she did speak it was to tell us she was at the wrong table and was not our waitress. Waitress #2 was fine.  Basically they need a Robert Irvine or Gordon Ramsey to come in and kick some ass!",

The steak special that is not on the menu you just ask for the special , it is amazing, We have always loved this special. We remember when it was like 4.99 or 5.99!  The steak always had the most amazing taste and flavor just like your eating a very expensive steak yet so much cheaper! Believe me we ate one night at a local steakhouse paid over $100 for 2 steak dinners and there was no comparison to the steaks we have always had here. And so much cheaper! The place is older not like in bellagio or one of the upscale hotels. Ellis island is a smaller casino off the strip and is a bit older without the glitch and glamour.. This cafe is not far from the front door and sometimes near dinner time the wait can get pretty long. The only problem is service can take a little bit depending on when you go but it will be worth your wait. Some nights you will hear when they start the Karaoke next door and get a good laugh out of some people who are singing. If your here on Vacation make sure to make this a stop to try, we have brought many friends over the years who are hooked and they go everytime they are in town now.",

Up until now I could not figure out just what \"chicken fried steak\" was referring to, a flattened chicken patty? a breaded something with gobs of white gravy to hide the shoe leather? This Chicken Fried Steak defined it once and for all...a meat patty, pork/chicken that is fried just like \"fried chicken\".  This is the bomb! Batter was crispy \"fried chicken\" batter, so tasty it was almost a shame to put the white gravy on top, so no need for extra gravy .... Wow!!  Ambiance still a little dated casino like, service was slow, waitress was Olga-ish, friendly but not helpful, slow, but could be because it was very busy, again still a local casino's cafe.

She did not show an apologetic attitude what so ever. NEVER COMING HERE AGAIN.   However, the food was kind of good. I guess.",

The Saturday special was steak and Eggs for 6.99, the steak was good sized New York strip cooked well, tender, Juicy, and perfect with the eggs and potatoes with wheat toast. This was and is a perfect breakfast place.   I also tried the bloody mary, spicy and it was excellent.   The staff are friendly, expect a wait at times during the morning when they have a rush.

I got a ground bacon burger--meaning the bacon was ground up with the meat and cooked as a whole patty-- that thing was DELICIOUS! service was slow BUT waitress was excellent. no complaints here.  oh and did i mention we walked from the strip? about a 15-20 minute walk (depending on how hung-over you are) in 103 degree weather.

    "text": "Who is responsible for raising the price on the steak special? The prices went up and the quality went down. If my memory serves me correctly, the steak special use to be between $6.95-$7.95. it included a side salad, homemade Rootbeer, a 10-oz filet cut steak, your choice of potato, and garlic green beans.  Now, they want you to have a tracking device, I mean a players card (even if you don't gamble) just to get the steak special for $9.99. By the way, that does not include the homemade Rootbeer, which will run you an additional $2.50.   As a Las Vegas local, I am outraged! I'm aware that I sound very frugal...because I am!!! If I were at an upscale steakhouse, with a nice atmosphere and attentive servers, this same meal would cost me at least $80, but the Ellis Island Cafe is a hole in the wall.   In regards to their service, it was my servers second day on the job (I'll cut her some slack because she was a sweetheart),however, it was Christmas and the restaurant was slammed. Why would management do that to their employee? I guess they believe in baptism by fire.  Our server forgot to bring our salads, so they arrived well after we received our entrees.  My husband had to find a steak knife for me because the staff was so overwhelmed.   With their new prices in effect, I urge everyone to mosey on over to Outback Steakhouse for a cheap steak special and a much shorter wait.",

The chicken fried chicken breakfast ($7.99) was probably one of the most delicious breakfasts I've ever had--juicy, amazing gravy, and perfectly cooked eggs. Went back for a very late 11pm dinner the next day and was so sad to find out that they had JUST ran out of the prime rib!! Instead, I got the NY steak and fried shrimp ($12.99) which also comes with a side and soup or salad. The steak was wonderfully seasoned, but the side of mashed potatoes wasn't too great and tasted a bit like instant ones. A lot of the reviews mention significant wait time but I experienced very fast service (wed morning, thurs night). Can't wait to come back to Vegas and (hopefully) make it in early enough to try the prime rib!!!",

It was only luke warm when it got to our table right by the kitchen. Oh, and the loaded part was one piece of crumbled bacon, sour cream in a tube, no chives or green onions. They were an afterthought from staff. For the entree I had the 1/2 chicken with lemon garlic sauce, vegetables, baked potato, and salad. The salad was a nice size, but smothered in dressing. The vegetables we're barely room temperature, and when mentioned to the waiter he understood as it happened the night before. The potato was slightly warmer than the vegetables, but it either sat on a steam table to long or was not baked, it was also the first time I've been served a potato not opened or cut and with sour cream in a tube and frozen butter wrapped in foil. The chicken was overcooked and dry, which is why they serve it with a sauce. The sauce was a nice lemon sauce no garlic. My wife ordered the shrimp scampi. It was at least the correct temperature. However, it was swimming in sauce and only one part of the garlic bread actually tasted like garlic bread. The bread was to greasy she couldn't eat it. Again we we're right by the kitchen no excuse for the different temperatures. After working in the culinary field for cover 10 years I was very disappointed. This is Vegas so you take your chances.",

Open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week AND they offer THE best steak and eggs special that Vegas has. For $5.99?! You better bet your bottom dollar that's right!  I thought Mr. Lucky's was a done deal but boy was I wrong. Ellis Island Cafe is where it's at. It's a little off the strip on Koval and Flamingo and it's located inside the Ellis Island Casino. This place is perfect for a 3 am grub session after hitting those crazy clubs all night or even just for a plain and simple breakfast at 8 am. All-in-all you just can't beat those prices AND portions.  I've been here a couple times and I ALWAYS get the $5.99 steak and eggs special. It's not included in the menu but it's usually written on their chalkboard sign by the front of the cafe. The special comes with 2 eggs (any way you want it), 6 oz. sirloin steak (cooked any way you want it), home fries and toast. The portions are perfect and I never had a problem with the chefs over or under-cooking the meat. Plus, those home fries are so deliciously crisp and well-seasoned. For $5.99 what's to complain about?  SIDE NOTE: the special is only from 11 pm to 11 am. Other than that, everything is great!   So please stop by this place whenever you're in Vegas. If you're going to spend $80 on drinks at the Marquee or Tao, might as well treat yourself to the tastiest, cheapest breakfast they got.",

Mostly known to be a local spot, and as creepy as it sounds, a place local cabbies stop to take their lunch break and congregate together (ever seen that movie DC Cab? Haha!).

Best steak and eggs you'll find in Las Vegas, hands down! Skip ordering biscuits and gravy unless you aren't offended that the gravy isn't made from scratch (I am not referring to powdered mix with some sausage thrown in either...yuk!!!).   I couldn't help but continue to observe the chunky Asian waitress being extra \"flirty\" with my husband as we sat together eating our meal. She even touched his shoulder at one point. It wouldn't deter us from coming back though; she was harmless and probably the way she makes her tips with the usual crowd.

The star of the show was the tall beer for $2.75. On a side note, I saw a neighboring table eating the steak special and prime rib. The prime rib looked amazing, but the other patron was sawing through steak special. It looked extremely tough. Overall, I would come back for the beer and probably try the prime rib.",

Call ahead or go to their website, there's a way to hold your spot in line ahead of time.  But the reason this spot is always busy is their low prices, huge portions, and good food. It's not high-end dining but they put out good prime rib ($15) and Southern specials like chicken fried steak or chicken ($10?), both of which come with an awesome white gravy. Most meals come with a potato/rice and soup or salad, and you'll get filled up.  Other menu options include burgers, sandwiches, and daily dinner specials (meatloaf, pot roast, etc). The small special shrimp cocktail ($4) and French Onion Soup ($5) are decent add ons if that somehow isn't enough food for you.  NOTE: You cannot order their chicken and ribs here, you must go to their separate BBQ restaurant space around the corner. Whichever one you go to, make sure you get a root beer!",

If you are looking to get away from the craziness of the strip and experience a little more of a classic old school vibe, this is a great option. The southern fried chicken is dynamite: well battered and with a crispy crunch that's not overly crusty or greasy. It's seasoned perfectly and chicken is moist and delicious. You get a full half chicken with fries for only $9.99. Holy cow....I mean, holy chicken! The fish and chips are also well done with a tasty crunch that hits the perfect note. To be honest, service is spotty depending on when you may be there. Just enjoy a leisurely time and don't expect service to be too attentive once you get your food. Waiting for your check or a refill will give you time to strategize what you will do with all of your blackjack winnings.",

The Prime Rib was kind of bland but cooked just the way I asked. My husband didn't like what he ordered and I forgot what it was, oops. My kids liked their burgers but their fries were kind of cold. Service was just okay too as we had to hunt our waiter down a couple if times. This is a good spot to go to when you're trying to fill your drunk stomach but def not ideal for a family dinner.",

Local prices right off the strip where for the same food you will pay twice as much on LVB.  The portions are filling and priced fairly.  This visit I had the Philly steak sandwich which came out quickly even with a full dining room.  Thick chucks of steak, green pepper and onion topped with gooey melted provolone a meal like this will most definitely sober you up. Expect a wait because this place can get busy but it's well worth it. I did not see one unsatisfied customer. I will be back often.",

Liked for its' lower prices for decent foods, it's become a tradition to always come by either late at night or for brunch, Ellis Island is always good at any time of day.  I used to love their steak and eggs but I have to say their quality has definitely gone down.  If you ask for medium, chances are you'll get well-done.  The potatoes it comes with usually is pretty tough and hard to enjoy.  The winner these past couple of trips has definitely been the chicken fried chicken steak. Much like a country fried steak, it's moist, comforting and tasty in the most guilty way--certainly a gratifying hangover meal.",

    "text": "I have tried. I really have. Food is cheap. This is True. But it is so painfully obvious why. And the waitresses do not give a damn. They just don't. They have attitude. I'm in Vegas. I have money to spend here. I'm not in a tight budget. I did come because I had 100$ free play and 50$ food coupons. I like Ellis island table games.   Let's put it this way. I was there 8 nights. I left Vegas still having a 25$ Ellis island food voucher because I'd rather pay $$ in Vegas for an experience of quality then have a free meal that sucked.   The photos look MUCH better than they tasted. This is our second visit in 4 months. First time I didn't like it either.  Famous fish and chips. Well greasy soggy mess makes you famous ok. Hubby had Rueben sandwich. It too was soggy. It more edible then my fish. But I digress.   This trip good free. I agreed to give it another shot for lunch. I ordered the club sandwich hubby the 50/50 burger. Supposed to be half ground bacon half hamburger meat.   Ok. I'm from Texas. Maybe it is just here but I have never had a club salad or a club sandwich with NO cheese. Small thing right? It's a big deal on a sandwich like a club though. I asked about it and was told it was 2$ more. Nope wasn't gonna do it. At this point I was already irritated because I spent 4$ for a side salad that was lettuce and croutons. I asked for onions on it and they wanted 1$ for a slice of onion. My club sandwich wasn't toasted at all (see pics). Fries were good.   Hubby's burger was ordered medium and came dry as the Sahara. No bacon flavor in the meat. It was an odd crumbly texture. The bacon should have added grease and flavor but it did not. It wasn't horrible bad but not good either.   I'll never eat here again. Not because of the food. I'd probably try it again fir breakfast but the staff is terrible. The hostess (a blonde woman shoulder length hair 45-55 yrs old) was super sweet. We'd been seated in a section and waited and waited. No one bothered to greet us (this was after a 20 min wait for a table in a more than half empty restaurant, which I've never understood) we flagged her down and asked to switch sections which she kindly obliged. About 5 min later the waitress from that section came to our table to scold us. She said \"I told you I'd be right with you but you couldn't wait!\" I just stared at her. She never acknowledged us at all but whatever. Then she said \"well did you want to stay here or come back to my section?\"  Shocked, I said no we'd stay here. So rude. Omgosh. Our waitress was ok. She was surely, brisk. Didn't smile. Wasn't friendly but efficient enough to earn her tip (we always tip 20%)  Anyway. Come. Eat. It's not going to kill you. It's cheap. It's ok. It's not great. The casino and workers are great. Don't come expecting more than a dennys type meal however. I did, and was disappointed.",

    "text": "You don't have to pay a mint to get a good meal in Vegas, and many of the smaller casinos actually offer up great meals as incentive to draw in players. My gf read about the $13.99 prime rib dinner they've go there, so we figured why not?   This place is right off the Strip, on the main road behind Bally's. It was probably a fun hot spot back in the day, but now people only want to bother with what's currently hot. The restaurant is right up front when you walk in. There was a short wait since it's plenty busy, even on a Monday night.   The restaurant decor could be best described as ancient and dated, resembling a relic from a bygone era no one cared to update. but why fake it here, right? This building is a relic, and even if the walls show signs of being redone three or four times over it still looks like somewhere my grandparents would eat.   We both wanted the same thing - prime rib, served with a baked potato and green beans. And, best of all, a 20 oz. stein of beer. All for $13.99. That rules so hard.   The prime rib was really great, cooked to a perfect medium rare and so soft and succulent. Each piece melted upon entering my mouth. My only complaint is that they use creamy horseradish instead of the real deal good stuff. Potato and beans were both great, too. The green beans weren't even overcooked.   They brew all of their own beer here, and they've got all varieties covered. I went with their hefeweizen, which was unremarkable but tasted just like a good hef should. And to think, we got all this food/drink for under $30. Hard to beat a deal that good.",

Even our lyft driver asked us if we were local.   The building outside looks a bit older. You can see the brewery from the street. I send pictures to a relative and she was impressed with the size of their system. I'm not a beer kinda person, so I didn't find it as cool. But she did ;)  We knew we were in good hands when our sweet older waitress called us her \"babies\". Everyone around us seemed genuinely happy and enjoying their food and discussing their wins/losses.   We went during lunch and I'm sad to say we didn't get any pictures. I ordered a BLT and added avocado. It was huge, the bread was crusty and toasted just how I liked it. The tomatoes and lettuce were ripe and fresh. A classic done right always makes me happy.   My husband ordered the 50/50 burger. 50% beef and 50% ground bacon. We are bacon lovers. It was glorious, y'all. Ground bacon is a revelation. As you get close to biting into the thing the bacon smell hits you. That's a special kind of love.   The food was priced well. Much less than anything we paid for on the strip.

He didn't introduce himself and quickly was about to walk away and said \"I'll be right back\". My friend and I looked at each as in a wtf just happened look and my friendly quickly said, can we have water. He said yes and left. He came back and brought our waters and we weren't ready yet since it was our first time. But he didn't know that since he didn't bother creating conversation or seem to have any customer skills. After he left again, my friend and I spoke about changing our server sink got up and asked another server if it was possible. They sat us down somewhere else with another server and brought the manager over. I spoke with the manager and explained to him what happened. He didn't apologize but just said we'd be taken care of by the new waiter. Thankfully, we finally given some great customer service by the new server. She was awesome! Created conversation, said her name, recommended items, had a SMILE ON HER FACE. If it weren't for her I wouldve given them a 1 star and most likely just left right after the first servers non chalant attitude. In a job where CUSTOMER SERVICE plays a huge role in bringing customers back and getting TIP$ you would think that being attentive and courteous would be a no brainer. I got salad and pasta marinara, my friend got clam chowder and Alfredo fettuccine. We both liked our food but the customer service left a sour taste in our mouths.",

    "text": "I use to come here when I was a teenager, and I recently made the trip back here and it did bring back memories for me.  The menu is simple and is only comprised of a front and back of a menu. It's filled with simple American dishes that can fit nearly anyone's taste. The items on the menu are relatively cheap compared to other restaurants out there now, and so I couldn't argue with the prices. My recent visit, I got the chicken parmesan while my mom got the salmon. Both items came with a salad. I would recommend asking for dressing in the side because it was just globbed on my salad and it was a lot just concentrated in the middle, so that wasn't fun. The chicken parmesan was quite delicious. The pasta was cooked well, the chicken was delicious, and the garlic bread was good. My mom's salmon wasn't as lucky, for it was a little dry and the green beans that it came with weren't that great.   The service really sucked when we went. It was understaffed for dinner and the place was almost completely full. When I had a general question that anyone in the restaurant could answer, I tried to ask someone who wasn't my server and he rudely told me that he wasn't my server and he can't help me. That's a no-no in my book.   Their food is cheap and you can get lucky or unlucky depending on what you order. Try not to go during peak hours and the service will be more than adequate.",

At first you walk in and just know it is an older outdated place but once we ate their food not once but twice we knew we found a great spot! We came here this past weekend for my dad's bday after he saw the reviews here on Yelp. Our entire family was not disappointed.  I ordered the Denver Omelet and it came with potatoes, it was the yummiest omelet I have ever tasted! The coffee was even good!! Others in my party had the steak & eggs special- $5.99 and it looked very good. I had a bite of the steak, and it was very flavorful!  We liked this place so much that we went back the next evening for their dinner special. It was steak, choice of potato, green beans, salad and a 20oz beer. Wowza!! This steak was a different cut than the one they offer for breakfast. It was thick and a large cut, I was very impressed. This special is $8.99 but if you sign up for their casino's players card they will give you $1.00 of this amazing deal.  If you are looking for great steak specials in Vegas that are good tasting and want a bang for your buck, this place is a must when you are in town!! It is def our new go to spot!!!",

    "text": "I was not overly impressed with this place to be honest. We were asking around for some good places to eat from some fellow vacationers and someone told us about Ellis Island. We decided that we would give it a try, due to how highly this tourist talked of it.  This place had a couple of good things about it but overall I don't think I will be going back.   First of all it's really loud because it's in the middle of a casino and karaoke goes on right next door, so if you're looking for an intimate place to take someone, this is not your place. I know it's Vegas and there are casinos everywhere but I feel like this place would have more success if it was a secluded restaurant.   We ordered calamari for an appetizer and then I decided I would go with the spaghetti with sausage. It had a fancier name on the menu but that's what it was. I WAS NOT impressed at all with the spaghetti at all. The noodles weren't cooked very well and the sauce tasted like it was justo poured out of a can. The only thing that got me through it was the sausage and even that wasn't very good. I would honestly give the food a 2 star. 2 because I saw some other meals that were there and they looked decent. The hand brewed Rootbeer is amazing if you stop by here though.   What made me give that extra star for this place was our waiter. This guy was pretty awesome. He was personal, he did a great job and incredibly helpful when we were all ordering. I really appreciate that in a higher end restaurant.   Overall you won't find me back here because there are so many places that are better right around town. This place has potential to be better, they are just and missing a few elements to really progress as a business.",

After a 30-minute wait to get seated in the first place on a Monday early afternoon.  The only reason this review is getting two stars instead of one is because the food is cheap, and it did taste fairly good for the price. It took over 30 minutes for us to get our food after ordering, however. Plus, I asked for water no ice but it had ice in it, and I asked for sourdough bread on my burger, but got brioche.  Four stars for the food itself, one for service and frankly overall experience outside the food itself, which by the way is four stars for the price, not four on a universal food scale.",

I went to the cafe and ordered some food. The prices are amazing, and the quantity of food is more than enough that I constantly had left overs. But one hostess stood out to me; her name as a I look on my receipt is Brittany! She is absolutely AMAZING! Top notch customer service, friendly, goes above and beyond for her customers. She's taken my order twice since I've been here and tonight is my last night and I just had to give her a shout out! She remembered I was a guest (you got 10% off your bill) which is pretty sweet! Brittany, you rock! You are one of a kind, and I definitely see you going places! If you stop by Ellis Island Cafe and Brittany is your hostess, you won't be disappointed. She's definitely a prime example of GREAT customer service!",

The husband had been here before and had mentioned that they had a pretty good deal where you get prime rib AND a beer for less than $20. After waiting less than 10 min, we were seated and quickly had someone taking our orders. We asked about their prime rib and beer special and we were sadly informed they no longer have it. Womp womp. Still decided to give it a go. My prime rib wasn't very good but the husband's was. Mine had way too much nerves and fat which wasn't tasty for me, but the freaken green beans were super bomb! I couldn't stop eating them! They were seasoned to perfection, crisp and not too soggy. The baked potato was pretty good too. I ordered an IPA (this place brews their own beers) The beer was only $2.50. Decent place but I would maybe skip the prime rib, def not as good as the husband hyped it up to be haha. I did see the meatloaf on the table next to us. It looked and it smelled good.",

Prime rib, baked potato, green beans were very good. I even did not mind the package of sour cream and the little packages of butter. Because the prime rib was so good. Mine was I little more done than I wanted, but the taste and flavor were just fine.  The server was a little absent minded, but did get everything we needed.  There is a parking structure in back. For the price and what you got, it was well worth it.  It is a brewery, got you some beers.",

We also tried their clam chowder which is one of the best I've ever had the chance to have..and even better than any clam chowder at Fisherman's Wharf if San Francisco and San Diego! I think they've now lost the title for best clam chowder in the world, and it now belongs to Ellis Idland Cafe!  I was so skeptical at first, but their mashed potatoes and garlic string beans are the perfect sides to their juicy prime rib!  I'm in love and I think this hidden gem is the perfect spot after all those buffets! I hadron Buffet at the Bellagio and their Kobe Beef Round is nothing compared to Ellis Island Cafes King Cut Prime Rib!  Next time, I'll try the onion rings and calamari!!",

Then proceeded to look at us crazy when we did not have our side items fully memorized during the order.  He never asked us if we wanted their delicious root beer (which I saw advertised on the wall 10 minutes after my order).   Our food was delivered and it was very good and worthy of 5 stars. But because we finished without a pass by from the waiter to refill our water we ended up just leaving what we thought the bill should total in cash on the table with a little buffer.  I guess the two am crowd is not this places cash cow.",

Nowhere else compares to their steak and eggs. The steak is a good, non-cheap quality piece of meat. It's tender, not dry. Eggs are eggs, not really hard to mess up. Unlike most other places, the hash browns are little chunks instead of the traditional kind. I actually really don't like the traditional hash browns. Ellis Island has a crispy outside and soft inside potato cubes. I LOVE IT! I wipe out the potatoes every time I'm here whereas I would hardly even touch the hash browns at another restaurant.   My usual choice is steak medium, eggs over easy, and white toast. However, I think I'll switch over to sourdough my next visit. The service can be slow when they're busy but it's still worth eating here. The hotel itself is a little run down but don't let it scare you away. It's also off the strip but I'm telling you, BEST STEAK AND EGGS!",

I did get one of the few seats open in the bar where I could get food from the cafe and some in house brew without a half hour wait for a table. The beer was really good and really cheap. What I had was a beer and a 1/2lb bacon cheeseburger with fries and a beer for under $10. Was it great? no. Was it over cooked? yes. Was it worth what I paid? you bet! This place serves a lot of locals late after they work. The bar I was in becomes a Karaoke bar late many nights. It is only a short walk off the strip so if you are feeling broke you can get filled up for a reasonable price. I wish I could verify the quality of the bbq, but the beers are good. :)",

I'm so happy that, I listened to her! This deal comes with eggs, toast, steak and side of potatoes. The steak was cooked at the right temperature and not over cooked.  We got here about 9am and were seated by the hostess of the restaurant. We ordered our food with a young lady (Asian). She was so sweet with us. She was very friendly, she talked to us about her daughter being a DJ in Vegas/San Diego.   Overall, we got our food within 10 minutes and got out of there within 35 mins max. The wait was really fast for a party of 3 people. I will return soon, on my next trip to Vegas.",

    "text": "Located inside Ellis Island Casino across from Ballys Casino, on Koval just off Flamingo. It's close to the strip but finding it and parking should be fairly easy.   Been here several dozen times and usually happy considering prices and the service are on point. Some visits haven't been the best but overall they deserve 5 stars.  Sometimes the wait is bad but I think you can get on waiting lists from yelp now and also see how long the wait is before going, very cool improvement because not that long ago you had to be there to get on the waiting list.  I haven't had to wait at all the last two times I went, last visit was a busy Friday night/ Saturday morning even.   They've remodeled the restaurant and casino but they kept 'most' of the same great food. You (or one person in your crew) will need to get a players card and print a voucher to get the 'Steak Special' unlocked for anyone that wants it. I think they took away the Ellis Island Chicken meal I use to get often so maybe other changes. They renamed the chicken meal once but was told it's no longer available awhile back but with all the continuous changes they may bring it back.   I'll be back to for sure. Check them out, enjoy!",

    "text": "This review is for one of Las Vegas's hidden gem meals: the diner-style breakfasts served by the restaurant within the Ellis Island Casino, just a 5-10 minute walk off of the heavily-trafficked Las Vegas strip.  I've been doing cheap-ass breakfasts at Ellis Island since my first trip to Las Vegas over a decade ago, and still find myself inexplicably drawn there each time I'm in town.  Seating is comfortable, with both table and booth options available. Best of all, a solo diner like myself can get lost among the patrons, though still noticed by the attentive eyes of the wait staff, who have long been one of this establishment's strengths. The waitresses have good chemistry and camaraderie, helping each other out to cover a busy floor filled with breakfast bargain-shoppers.   My favorite item is their Country Fried Steak breakfast platter, featuring a deep-fried breaded pork chop smothered in a bechamel-based southern breakfast gravy, 2 eggs done to my preference, 2 slices of pre-buttered toast, and a hefty helping of home fried potatoes with onions and peppers. All of this comes to the table for $7.99 and is so filling that it takes care of both breakfast and lunch, and compels me to need a late dinner.  I also occasionally order one of their 3-egg omelets ($6.99), my preference being to have them filled with ham and covered with melted slices of both American cheese and Monterey Jack cheese. Omelets also come with the home fried potatoes and buttered toast.  Each table has a bottle of A1 Steak Sauce -- as if Ellis Island is daring you to try their 10oz New York Strip Steak with 2 Eggs, Potatoes, and Toast for $11.99. I've had this in the not-too-distant past when Ellis Island was more under the radar and you could get a surprisingly-decent steak and egg breakfast for $5 if you showed up early enough in the morning. Alas, those days are gone.  For better or worse, Ellis Island has grown up, and so have I. Although I won't have breakfast here every day for a week like in my younger days of visiting the city, I will still dine at Ellis Island a couple of times each visit -- it is the esteemed old friend who reminds me of how I vacationed in Vegas before spendy chef-driven outposts started popping up all over the strip.  Food/Decor/Service: 3.5/3.4/4.0",

The steak seemed as if it was frozen and defrosted.  As if that wasn't bad enough, it was covered with an insane amount of BBQ rub,  Like thick enough I could scrape it off with a spoon.  But it was impossible to scrape enough of it off.  It totally overpowered the steak.  The steak was just to weak to defend itself.  Two or three bites and I was finished with it.  The breakfast potatoes tasted old.  Very old.  And bad.  Like even when they were fresh, they still would've been bad.  They looked good, but they tasted like cooking oil.  Couldn't eat them.  I ordered my eggs poached, soft.  They were OK.  The toast was barely toasted at all.  More like warmed bread than toast.  What a colossal disappointment.  Maybe I ordered the wrong thing.  I don't know.  I doubt if I'll ever stop by again though.  This place sucked.    Mikey C says: only reason this isn't a one star review is because I don't like giving one star reviews.",

We ate at the Pub, again prices were great, only $2.75 for a tall microbrew beer - SO worth it! The food was pretty eh. I got the BTL, the bacon was really good, however I would have liked more lettuce. I got the \"loaded\" fries which came out a tad burned & dry and missing the sour cream & green onions... womp womp. The waitress was really nice but our food did take a while, with people coming in after us getting their food well before ours came out.   I probably would go back... just for the beer!",

They need to train their staff better with customer service skills.   There wasn't a wait when we got there, we were seated immediately. However, we were NOT greeted by our waiter for more than 20 minutes, in fact, we didn't even know who our waiter was because there was nobody in our seating area. I went up to the hostess after 25 mins waiting asking her why we didn't have a waiter, she was not being nice, she straight up told me to wait longer because there were parties before us. When I looked, the tables around us had already been taken care off and were eating already. So I went back to sit down and waited longer. Our waiter finally showed up a little bit after I sat back down, he didn't even stop by our table, he just walked by on the way to where ever he was going and all he said was \"be right back with you guys\" and left. Maybe another 8 mins passed, our waiter came back again told us \"just a little bit, be right back\". I was heated by then. Finally after a little while he came over, didn't introduce himself or anything, took our orders and left. He never checked us on our food or refilled our water. We didn't see him again until he put the check on our table and left. We even had to get him to come over to actually take our credit card to pay. It was the worst customer service I've ever experienced.   Now move on to the food, the food was cheap. I got the grilled chicken with mushrooms over rice, it came with soup of the day (minestrone) or a salad. The soup was good just a little salty, my entree was okay, it wasn't really flavorful, I guess you get what you pay for.   Overall, my experience was horrible here, wasted a lot of time waiting around, will never come back here again.",

Other than that, i would highly recommend this place! the price is unbeatable for the things you can get.. its open 24/7 !! and nothing is over $15!! I ordered the chicken fried steak and eggs. Honestly I wasn't expecting much because of the price, but after taking my first bite... i was shocked. The pork chop was super flavorful and not dry at all. The potatoes were also delicious! You definitely get your moneys worth here and more. HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PLACE IF YOU'RE IN VEGAS!",

I came for lunch on a Saturday and was promptly seated and served by the wonderful Suzie - she was awesome. I had the prime rib and WOW. Only the San Franciscan rivals in comparison. It's cooked to perfection and the cut is HUGE! Unlike its pricey counterparts, their meals come with sides, soup, or salad. My entire meal was BOMB from start to finish. The prime rib was seasoned well, was moist and tender and the au jus and creamy horseradish were perfect compliments. Oh and those mashed potatoes and gravy....somebody catch me, I am falling!!!!!   I brought my oldest kids with me the next day and it was packed! I put down my name on the list and they text you when your table is ready! I was told 10-15 minutes only for it to be less than a 5 minute wait. You gotta love it!  This visit was steak and shrimp for me, steak & eggs for my DIL and the hangover burger for my son. I also had the french onion soup. Another success!!! We all raved about the food, service, price points, and location. The soup, like everything else, is made from scratch and is by far, the best french onion I have ever tried. EVER. The broth was rich, flavorful, and full of onions. They put a hearty slice of bread and gruyere cheese on top and honestly, the soup could be a meal by itself. Our steaks were also well seasoned and cooked with an open flame, so it had a really nice char. The shrimp were not at all greasy and I did not get sick. SCORE!  Like my previous visit, the service was exemplary from start to finish. I absolutely love this place - this is my go-to casino and restaurant in LV from now on. Such a gem!!!!",

    "text": "No matter what you order you're getting a good deal on the food. My sister got the $10 New York strip and it was pretty damn good for $10 bucks. But that's no fun, you need to go for the gusto. Being on vacation is not the time to quibble over $5 (which is the craps minimum at Ellis Island's casino) so go ahead and get that prime rib!  I sure did. It was probably about 1 in the afternoon in the second day of our trip, and I had skipped breakfast. It's December, and I can tell you with confidence that was one of my top five meals of the year. I ordered it rare with mashed potatoes and split pea soup to start. It came with garlic green beans.  Let's start with the part I liked least: Green beans. As a general rule, I hate green beans, however these were buttery, garlicky and with just enough salt. I approve, but I still hate green beans.  Next stop, split pea soup. Amazing! The only problem was that I wanted a whole bowl, but if the serving had been bigger they would have had to roll me out of the restaurant. This split pea was very flavorable but not too salty. Great color, good size chunks of ham, and creamy. They definitely put Pea Soup Andersons in Solvang (the alleged capital of split pea soup) to shame.  The beer. In addition to being a casino, Ellis Island is a brewery. That's kinda cool, and not very common in Las Vegas. I ordered the IPA, which is what I always drink from the craft brew scene. It was more of a session beer than a True IPA by my standards, but still good. Very little hoppiness, but worth a try. My sister and her BF ordered the stout, which was more like a red ale than a stout. Still good with a steak.  Down to business: the potatoes. I got the mashed because my wife ordered the steak fries and we were going to share. The steak fries were good, run of the mill restaurant fries you would expect from Red Robin or the like. But the mashed potatoes and gravy were to die for. Seriously these make your mom's homemade mashed potatoes and gravy on Thanksgiving look like child's play. If you are not a huge gravy fan, ask for it on the side because the amount on the potatoes is very generous.  The main event: The King Cut Prime Rib. Holy cow, quite literally.",

    "text": "We had a big fulfilling meal for such a cheap price. I had the steak and eggs, ordered it medium and it came almost well done. Our food took forever and a day to come so there was no way I was sending it back and waiting for a new one. Unfortunately I didn't enjoy it. My boyfriend had the prime rib and he devoured it. The server said this was the best thing they had on the menu. My sister ordered the steaks and fried shrimp and her steak was way better than mines. It was a different cut from the steak that comes with the steak and eggs so that's why. I think it was a NY, or a sirloin, not sure. The salads that come with your entree are pretty damn good for a little side salad.   They have peach cobbler but I was way too full to have dessert.   $5 roulette tables in the casino!!!!! And great tasting, freshly made micheladas at the little Mexican spot for pretty cheap! Pretty cool to still see a casino that is outdated and has that old school vegas feel, even if it is off the strip.",

Some day I may raise number of stars... Based on this consideration ...  Also it is important to go at the right time.

I mean, steak and eggs for $9.99 seemed like a steal and a lot of the reviews seemed to insinuate that it was tasty as well. Now there may be a bit of a wait, if you're with a big group. We waited about 20 minute for a group of 8 people, so that wasn't too bad.   The waitress was was quick to take our drink orders and food orders. But damn, for the food to actually come out...it takes a while. When the steak and eggs came out, I was excited. I attacked the meat like a barbarian...but to no avail. My steak was very tough!! I asked for it medium rare and i was attacking the thing with my steak knife and it would not give! My brother's, however, was nice and bloody (he, too, had ordered medium rare). It's crazy the two steaks could differ so much.  I got tired of wrestling with my steak, that after eating about half of it, I gave it to my brother. I think maybe next time i'll get their prime rib instead (if there is a next time). I'd much rather pay more to have a tastier, more tender, and juicier piece of steak rather than eating a huge chunk of jerky for less.",

While by no means is Ellis Island a gourmet place, I would argue that getting cheap and good eats at a ridiculous hour in a convenient location is actually a better experience than a lot of the \"fine dining\" places that I've eaten.  The omelettes are quite good as well, with fresh ingredients and a cook that knows not to over-brown the eggs.  One of the best intermediate venue changes around!   Don't try and come here during peak hours though - waits are usually 45min-1hr for dinner.",

It also gave you a choice of soup or salad. I had the salad. Also included was the garlic green beans. The prime rib was tough and  chewy. The steak fries and salad was of average quality. The green beans were previously frozen. We also had a bottle Ravenswood Zinfandel for 24 dollars, very good for the price. We have been to this place three times before. The prime rib was always good. Don't know what happened this time. May give this place one more try ,when we come back this November.",

Went back a second time for the steak and egg breakfast same steak just as good eggs and home fries were outstanding good value for under 10 bucks can't beat the pricing highly recommend this place.  Service was a little slow for the dinner. Unfortunately some of the smoke filled in from the casino which is a little bit of a distraction. Other than that this place is a winner.",

They offer it regularly for I think $10.99 during the weekdays but during the weekends from 11pm-11am it's priced at $6.99.  (Recently raised their prices).  You get an 8 oz steak, eggs, breakfast potatoes and toast. Sometimes it's busy, sometimes it's not.  Really a hit or a miss but even if there is a wait, it's never too long.

I was staying at a hotel on the strip and it was kind of late, so I didn't want to spend an arm and a leg on food, especially since places around me when about to close soon. I hate feeling rushed while eating as well so I wanted to look for options for late night spots. Yelp brought me to this place.   I was staying at the Aria, and it took me about a 15-20 minute walk to get here.   I got the steak and egg special. $6.99... yes I said $6.99! Excellent value, also comes with potatoes which makes it even better. The food was really good, and an awesome bang for your buck option.   For what this place is, a late night option for me, it gets 4 stars. This isn't your type of place our go to eat at on the strip but it does the job.",

In fact, if it wasn't for a local's recommendation, I wouldn't have known about this place. The wait is long during peak times (about 30-45 minutes for a party of 2). BUT you can skip the wait if you chose to dine at the bar.  One of their best menu items is their $15 King Cut Prime Rib. You get a large piece of prime beef, slow roasted and served with baked potato, green beans and a side salad or soup. They'll even throw in a side of au jus and sour cream. Not the best steak I've had, but I can't complain.   An Elvis impersonator was performing that night. Let's just say that it was very loud at the bar and \"Elvis\" was making his rounds courting and singing in front of every table. Our server was great. Very prompt and helpful. Unlike the hostess. I hear that the prices go up, so if you plan on stopping by here, it's better sooner than later.",

For me, it's not really a complete Vegas trip anymore if I don't make that stop here at Ellis Island Cafe for some of their yummy food. It's kind of a tradition now. I haven't been eating meat lately, so I tried their penne pasta, and grilled cheese this time. The pasta was pretty good, better than expected. Creamy, cheesy and delicious! Their grilled cheese wasn't a joke either, it was extremely toasty, and flakey. Mmmmmmmm. I did wish the cheese was more melt in your mouth, but overall it still didn't disappoint!! I was spending forever and a day looking for it on the menu, but couldn't find it. No worries though, the servers will be able to punch it in on the register! Also, I don't know if they still do their $5 steak and eggs combo, I think it's 8.99 now! But that's still a steal!!  Overall, you still can't beat a budget meal here! Great for after the clubs too!! Definitely a step up from the chain diners (IHOP, Denny's, etc) The service may be a little slower... but well worth it!  TIP: They don't do take out so if you plan to order, you'll have to be seated, order then ask for boxes... They aren't stingy with their sauces though! Pretty awesome, they let us take whatever we needed for our food!",

Tonight my salad came with a dead fly in it. Thank god I didn't eat any of the salad when I found the fly. They took $2 off our bill and brought me a new salad that I did not eat. But I did eat the rest of the steak special. Which was fantastic.   Just check for flies in the salad. I really should have made a stink about it but it wasn't my server's fault. My friend asked for the discount but even then $2 is an insult. I gave them 3 stars because my past service was excellent.",

    "text": "This is a small Cafe that is tucked inside the Ellis Island Casino which is a bit off-strip so is mainly patronized by locals. It's most famous offering is a steak and eggs special for $5.99 available between 11 pm. and 11 am. which surprisingly I've never had it in all my visits here as I've generally come during peak dinner hours.  I've always found them to be packed and have had to wait about 40 minutes before getting a table. A good thing is that they give you a token that lights up and beeps when your table is ready so you can roam around the casino and play rather than hang around waiting at the Cafe.  Over a couple of visits I've tried a bunch of their house specials. During my first visit I got a King Cut Prime Rib ($13.99) and asked for it to be done medium, but what I got was too rare for my taste. The cut of beef also had a lot of fat so I did not like this very much. During subsequent visits I've tried their Chicken Fried Steak ($8.99) which was pretty good but the gravy was a let down, the Wild Alaskan Salmon ($11.99) which was cooked nice and juicy and the NY Stake and Fried Shrimp ($11.99) which was cooked to a perfect medium. Their service is a bit slow right from taking your order to clearing your check but it is bearable. Last word of advise would be to add a large glass of one of their in house brewed beers (Amber Ale - European style beer, Hefe Weiss - wheat beer, Dark Larger - Stout, Light - Regular beer and IPA - hoppy bitterness) to any entree for $2.25.   Ellis Island Cafe is a reasonably good place to get a cheap yet decent meal which is what keeps getting us back, whenever we are visiting Vegas.",

I ended up putting the rice in the butter and putting a bunch of lemon and some salt and it came out way better then before. The hot wings were delicious though, amazing really. The steak was supposed to be medium rare and came out medium and not as juicy as i hoped but A1 helped out a bunch. The salad that came first had a slop of ranch on top so it was drenched with dressing. Not a fan of that. Thats for the great service though.",

Then our waiter (who never gave us his name, but by the receipt I guess it was Phi) came around with waters. He never greeted, told us his name or asked what we wanted to drink. He was in a bad mood or something. He took a long time to take our order. Other groups of people who got there later than us, had their orders taken. My husband had to call him over. The wait time for the food was another long, long wait.  Families who got there after us were already well into their dinner. I had to call the manager, who was really nice. He told us to call him for put dessert.  Like 15 minutes later, Phi came over again, pretty upset and told us \"the food took long because the cooks take long to cook\".... yeah??? How did larger groups get their dinner first than us, though and they got there later than us? I didn't argue. He then came over to our table with the menu and told me to order dessert and didn't even ask the rest of the people that were with me so I had to let him know they wanted desserts too.... my husband was at the bathroom, so, I ordered a homemade cheesecake for him.  Again, we waited a long time for our desserts... he brought them and he placed a brownie dessert for my friend, than he turned to my husband and said, \"ok, you share with her\" like WTF?!!!!!! My husband was really angry and asked him for his cheesecake. Phi told him I didn't order it... I was just done with the situation and didn't say anything. So, yeah... the servers there even decide whether you share your dessert or not lol.",

Also the servers are pretty great, friendly and fun. Food and servers are 5 star to me      However, the blonde hostess late night is terrible. She is extremely rude, she looks like a hot mess, and she has messed up my phone number for my reservation every time I have gone there. I can't stand her.

Wait staff provided items on menu could not be modified. We ordered off the menu. I don't recall the actual meal ordered. It came reasonable timed. Not a bad breakfast but not a great breakfast. I have definitely have had better.  Restaurant was a bit busy. Plenty of areas were being cleaned during my visit.  My visit was okay. Not quite my cup of tea.

My daughter and I both got the prime rib king cut that came with green beans and 2 sides of our choice. The food came out quick too. It was all for $14.99 for all that food too.

I've been to expensive steak houses that couldn't have cooked it better! What a bargain! Not sure why every breakfast place in Vegas cooks their potatoes like this (would have preferred hash browns). And of course, no fruit available. But I guess, who comes to Vegas to eat fruit? One of my over easy eggs was cooked through and no dimpy, but was still yummy. This will always be one of our go to breakfast places. Apparently it's everyone else's too as it's always packed.",

    "text": "This review is for 2 visits. We ate there two nights ago, and the food was delicious! My hubby had the prime rib and I had the fish and chips! That was a Friday night. We had a wait of about 40 minutes, so we entertained ourself in the casino. The place is not one of the flashier casinos/restaurants that you would see on the strip, but they had some seriously inexpensive, great food/beer. We were leaving Vegas on Sunday, and kept thinking about the delicious $26 for 2 of us, both with beer, and thought we should eat lunch there before flying out. We stopped there around 2 pm, and the place was only 25% full. The unfriendly hostess greeted us with a sour face and told us that there would be a 45 minute wait to get seated. I did a double take because SERIOUSLY the place WAS EMPTY!! I don't know if they were expecting us to just go gamble and pass the time or what, but we had to catch a plane and did not have time for that nonsense! Such a shame that we left with an unwelcomed feeling.",

We arrived at 3pm and were told it was a 35-40 minute wait, even though there were at least 20 empty visible tables. After 45 minutes of waiting, I asked how much longer it would be and the hostess said there were still 5 people ahead of us. We left. We were starving by then and decided on the pizza on the other side of the casino. I wish we had not wasted so much time waiting for nothing.",

    "text": "Two words: steak special.    Tucked away in the smokey corner of Ellis Island is the cafe which serves up one of the best steak deals in Vegas. Its sort of a poorly kept secret but for 8.99 you get a great cut of steak with all of the fixings, a house salad, and a microbrew or house root beer.  Most places featuring steak specials serve up a thin fatty NY strip but not Ellis. The steak is lean thick cut, pretty surprising for the price. The cafe also features daily specials, steak n eggs and a few other standard offerings.   One of the best things about Ellis Island is that they feature their own microbrewery. They have about 5 different beers brewed on location for around $2 bucks. You get a 22oz draft with your meal or you can trade it in for a fresh root beer. The 'hefe-weiss' I had was refreshing and tasty, no IPA though =(.   In order to get the special at the cafe you have to sign up for the players card which isn't a big deal. During my last trip, there was a ridiculously long wait, 1+ hour despite half the tables being empty... go figure, so just call ahead to make sure you can get a seat.",

Its located right behind Bally's, and is an easy walk from the strip.    First off, the prices are amazing. For around $10 you can get a huge portion, good quality American meal.  I usually \"splurge\" and get the $13 prime rib which comes with a beer from their on-site brewery.  All of their home brews are delicious and an amazing value at ~$2-3.00 each.  The waitstaff is always friendly and attentive.    I always make an attempt to try and find some new places to eat while I'm in Vegas, but eventually I always end up back at Ellis Island for a few meals every time I come out.",

The service was kind of bad. no proper greeting from the waiter after waiting forever to get our order taken. it was a good 20 min wait. He didn't even say sorry all he did was come up to us and said \"alright guys\" flipped open his notebook and was ready for us to order. whenever we asked a question he was sarcastic about every answer. He forgot my boyfriends beer after he went through the whole process if checking the ID. his excuse was that he forgot to write it down. Food took forever but it was busy so I will give them that. But nobody came to check on us at all. The food was good and I think that is why they are so rude. Because by the time you get your food your so hungry and its so good that you can't really complain. I wouldn't recommend it.   Go to the Silver Sevens. Same kind of food and prices but way better service.",

Of course - don't expect a five Michelin Star dining experience. We're talking about a low end Casino restaurant. However adjusting our expectations to this venue, here's the scoop.  1. Before you go, sign up - via internet - for the Ellis Island players club card. (It's free) This gets you $4 off the already low price, $10 free chips to play, and a free beer with your meal.  2. DONT stand in line to eat at the Cafe. Either; eat in the BBQ cafe (cheaper and good, no wait) or ask to eat in the bar. (Same food, no wait)  3. Place is dark, dimly lit. Smells like a college bar. (Deal with it)  That said:  The steak special is a good value for the price.  A good 8 oz. boneless filet, perfectly char broiled. A good baked potato with butter / sour cream. Pretty good green beans. (Not canned) A descent bowl of soup. (Clam chowder when I visited) plus a pint of house brewed beer.  All for less than $10.  Steak had good taste and very little fat. Not fork tender but I eat it all. Soup was ok. Potato & veggies were acceptable.  The best \"cheap\" steak in Vegas? Yes... yes it is.",

Fear not however I have found a suitable replacement, enter the Hangover Burger!!! OMFG is this thing good, huge 1/2lb Burger, with Bacon, a fried pickle, and an egg along with lettuce, tomato, and onion, and a Bloody Mary Aioli. Unbelievable, and huge!

    "text": "Firstly, I would like to emphasize the fact that I am far from a judgmental person. I genuinely try to avoid acting off of the possible negative preconceived notions I can conjure up about an establishment. Even though you had to walk through a dingy, cigarette smoke filled \"casino\" to get to the so-called Pub, i STILL tried not to judge.   As we walked into the pub, we went to greet the group of people who invited us there. We are visiting Vegas, and have never been to, let alone, heard of this place. As we greet our friends one of them points to an open table that's next to them, inviting us to sit. Assuming that the table was being saved for us, we began to sit.   This is the moment that the host, LARISSA, rushes over to us and asks if we were eating here. We politely say that we are, and with the snarkiest tone she replies \"well if you're eating here you need to take a number like everyone else that is in front of you.\" As someone who works in the food serving industry, it is extremely off putting and completely rude to speak to customers that are spending money at your establish in such a manner when the customers gave you absolutely no reason to. As we go to take a number and sit in the small waiting area, another hostess who's name I was unable to get tells LARISSA \"oh they're staring at you\" in which she replies \"I REALLY don't care.\" Now, it's one thing to be an initial douchebag to a customer, but to then proceed to speak in the same manner about said customer when they are in earshot is unprofessional.   We eventually got sat, in which the rest of our time at the restaurant didn't improve by even the smallest fraction.   What I will say is the manager did hear me out while I politely informed him of the horrible treatment we were receiving and comped half of our bill. It was appreciated, even though as the manager its clearly his job to compensate for sub-par service from the people who are supposed to help keep the restaurant afloat.   The main point of this lengthy review I took the time out of my Las Vegas trip to make is that LARISSA is probably the worst host any establish could even consider hiring, let alone actually go through with it. And, if it looks like a sketchy pub that you probably should even step foot in, it probably is.",

Well the casino has been remodeled, and the cafe updated with a lighter decor. It is still a locals place with some tourist activity.  You can't get a better meal for the price.  As a matter of fact this meal for two, with Fish and chips, and my order of the King cut prime rib was out standing. Plus two 20oz beers was under $36.00.  We went to Oscar's steak house downtown about  a month ago and our tab was right at $200.00. Oscar's meal could not compare with our Ellis Island Feast. Service was quick and spot on.  Our server, Sergio, was very nice and checked on us three or four times.  Other than some price rise over five years, the meals were the same good quality.  The wife loved the Fish and chips, and my prime rib was cooked perfectly rare as ordered.   This place stays high on our list of Las Vegas favorites.",

Where can you get this? No where. The portions are extremely huge.  I went back for breakfast because they have a $7.99 Steak and Eggs special!

The menu ranged from pasta, to fish and chips, to prime rib. A large range of foods. I ended up getting the prime rib, medium - it was $16.99!! Inexpensive prime rib? Oh you know I'm in. It also came with green beans, a side of your choice (I got mashed potatoes), and soup du jour or a side salad! I got the soup of the day, which was cream of chicken - it was so good, really flavorful and seasoned super well.   My prime rib came out and I would say order your meat a little more rare than you want because mine came out medium well - a little more cooked than I would like. It was still really flavorful and I ended up finishing the whole thing! The slice didn't look big, but it was super thiccccc. The green beans were way too salty, so I couldn't finish them and the mashed potatoes were dry and needed more gravy. But for $16.99? I wasn't going to complain.   My brother ordered the fish and chips and they were super oily, so he ended up packing them to go to toast up at home. My cousin ordered the fettuccine and said it had no flavor at all, so he also packed that home to make it better. I heard the burgers were good here, so definitely stick to the meat dishes and you'll be good!  Our waitress was super friendly and I can't wait until I'm back in Vegas to get another slice of prime rib!",

You'll get both at a location like this when you're literally a block off the strip and it's 530am.   The food however is just s good as I've come to expect from Village Pub!  Lucy, our server, was the most hospitable and hardest working young lady with a personality to match!  Something not entirely common in this town built on hospitality.  My Country Benedict was delivered in timely fashion and looked incredible!  Two biscuits with large link sausages on top, two huge soft scrambled eggs on top of that, and smothered in Country sausage gravy!  No way I could finish this dish, but it didn't stop me from enjoying this overload of Country goodness!  The other dish we ordered of French Toast blew our expectations away!  Texas toast dipped in egg and fried was absolutely fantastic without being too sweet!  This isn't this safest location in the wee hours of the night, which is the reason for the three stars, but if you pay attention to your surroundings you'll enjoy a great meal and some characters along the way!",

Potato O Brian, eggs and a huge chicken fried steak with gravy. It was a little bready then most, but definitely will not disappoint your appetite.   The NY steak with eggs was a little dry, which was cooked medium, is decent. I personally didn't have it but my friend gave me his view most of the meals come with toast which was nicely buttered! Yum!  Overall not bad for the price you pay and it's close to the strip. Cheap EATS Las Vegas!!!",

    "text": "After claiming to have the best fish and chips in Las Vegas for over 40 years, I knew I had to try some for myself.   My family and I came here for a late lunch and this place was empty. I was quite surprised, considering it was a Sunday afternoon and especially after reading that it can be a long wait.  We started with apps and ordered the jumbo onion rings and fried pickles. O-rings were average, but oh my god, I loved their take on fried pickles! Not your typical sliced dill pickles, but a whole spear coated in batter and fried to golden brown perfection.   Three pieces of Icelandic cod dipped in beer batter and served with a basket of steak fries for just $9.99- It was good, but not the best, and certainly does not deserve the title for the best fish and chips in Las Vegas. The cod was tough and the beer batter was good in flavor, but did not maintain its crisp. It was extremely oily and soggy, the batter falling off with each bite. Needless to say, I was disappointed because I walked into the restaurant with such high expectations! Their \"signature dish\" is completely overrated.  Service was great, very accommodating and attentive.  Village Pub and Cafe is one of those places that made me wonder why I even had it bookmarked in the first place. I'm glad I was able to try it, but I couldn't see myself returning here in the future unless I were to come here after a night out on the Strip or something along those lines.  It seems more of a place for locals, or those tourists who are looking for an alternative to the eateries on the Strip. Definitely come here if you're looking for cheap eats.",

Every year, we travel once or twice for trade shows and the Ellis Island Pub and Cafe is ALWAYS our first stop! Everyday we stop for breakfast before the show and everyday we stop for a couple of beers after the show. Why? For a variety of reasons but NONE more important than the relationships we have built with mama Teresa, the Pub and Cafe manager and Ricio, our long-time server. Both have been at Ellis Island for many years and every year we come back, they treat us like family by warmly welcoming us in and seating us in \"our table\" and taking time to reconnect and visit with each of us. In a town with so much glitz and glamour, the Pub and Cafe is where you can come to get a great meal, awesome beers at CHEAP prices and be treated like you are family that just came back for a visit! This is the place where servers, bar tenders, and kitchen managers come to retire, with the average tenure being well over 10-years!!!   We truly love everyone at Ellis Island Pub and Cafe! Teresa, Ricio, Monica, and so many others!!!! We will see you again the first week in February2020! God Bless!!",

No crackheads and homeless camping out for $$, just nice people (clients and staff). Slight wait to not oversell the kitchen (about 20 minutes at 10 am on Saturday).   Had two eggs, NY Strip - cooked perfectly I might add, and better flavor than an $18 Ribeye from Chili's!, wheat toast and fried potatoes - $5.99!!!! Saw where they were voted best breakfast in Vegas in 2014! Cannot disagree. Easy parking and a nice small casino and sports betting area. I really feel like I've found a gem in Vegas! Oh, I won back $250 I lost the previous evening. Wow, time to go home.   Make note Yelpers, for value and flavor, you really cannot beat this place.",

    "text": "Myself and 3 buddies were on a three day trip to Vegas. I had looked up Ellis Island on the Internet before we left and it was about 1/3 of a mile from the Flamingo, where we were staying, Ellis is a little off the Strip, but felt perfectly safe.  It is located next to a 7-11, so if you want to pick up a beer on the way back to the Strip, it makes it easy.  Ellis has a morning steak and eggs special with home-style potatoes and 2 slices of toast. A heck of a deal, and the steak is actually really good and the eggs I got were a perfect sunny side up. Not too runny.   Ellis also brews their own beer, I got the IPA every time, plus you get a huge pilsner glass of it for $2.25. They also have a light, a stout, an amber and a hefeweizen.  Plus they have To-go cups. Score!  We ate here about 4 times, but it was too late for the breakfast special so I got the chicken Phillie hoagie, again, really well made. Lots of flavorful onions and peppers with juicy chicken and I got a $3 side salad with blue cheese, which hit the spot.  Our service was fantastic every time. We even had the same waitress three times.   This place is a solid five star for what it is. Old school Vegas eating with quality food and cheap prices.  I usually got the breakfast special and 2 beers, and with tip it ran about $12 every time!  Each time we went at night, it was a 40 minute wait to get seated, so Ellis also has a pizza place and an awesome hoagie shop, both were very good back up plans!  Lots of laughs on a great trip with cheap, great food and beer!",

It's just around the corner from where we stay and the cafe serves some good diner style food. Tonight we ordered the calamari special to share, then both opted for the southern fried chicken basket. The calamari was a mix of rings and babies, which was fine for us. I prefer rings, and the OH prefers the babies. The chicken was very nice, with a tasty crunch to the coating, and no excess grease. The chicken came with fries and coleslaw, both were good. On this occasion we had a wait of 35 minutes to be seated. The desk person gives you a little buzzer, which goes off when your table is ready. We whiled away the time by playing a few slots and watching the football fans in the sports book get excited. It was quite entertaining, and the time went quickly.",

When I told Cindy that they might want to do something about the potatoes she then said yeah I don't like them either! So Waite if you won't eat them why the heck are you recommending the food!

For under $10 a person you get a starter salad with your choice of dressing & then a nice juicy piece of meat with garlic green beans & a starch. I stick to with the mashed potatoes & gravy & my man always gets the big fries. Overall the meal is really tasty! Oh and you get a beer or root beer with your meal! That's a nice bonus!

The reason I only give 4 stars for this restaurant is because we found one restaurant serving the best prime rib in our opinion in a small town of WY. So, no other steak restaurants can deserve a 5-star preview.",

My husband had the $9.99 steak special and the steak was beyond delicious.  He actually said he liked it better than the $50+ steak he orders when we go to Joe's at Caesar's.  You can't beat $9.99 for an amazing steak, their garlic green beans, baked potato and a house-brewed beer!  I had the chicken parm (my favorite comfort food), which was damn near the best I've ever had, also for $9.99 with a house-brewed root beer.  Our next visit was breakfast, where I had the bacon and eggs, and my eggs were done exactly as I asked (for me, that's rare!) and my husband had the chicken-fried chicken... SO good.  It's kind of old-school Vegas - it has a diner/coffee shop kind of feel, and the servers are as nice as can be.  Definitely a hidden gem.  This place will always be on our Vegas list!",

If you sign up for the club card, you get coupons for an incredible deal:  Big, thick steak, mashed potatoes and green beans, and a 20 ounce beer - all for $8.99.  One club card covers your party so bring a friend!  Even better, this is not a one-special, take-it-or-leave-it place like many on the strip.  Many other meals are reasonably priced - more than we could sample, actually.   Other people in my group had the chicken fried steak and the chicken fried chicken, and both were reasonably priced.  We went back the next day and I had the steak special but split that with a friend who ordered the club sandwich, which was packed full of ham and turkey and just enough bacon.  It's a microbrewery too and all 20-oz beers are $2.25.  I had the dark lager the first time and the hefe weis the second, both good.  I gambled video poker \"Jacks or Better\" and had a nice long string followed by a modest hit.  While I won a modest amount, more notably the machines are set so you don't lose your money fast.  You can have fun playing and having drinks.   We will absolutely be back here on our future trips to Vegas.",

We both ordered the fish and chips. Then we waited and the. We waited.  Finally after 35 minutes two baskets of over cooked and I mean dark crusted fish that were drenched in oil were delivered.  I removed the poorly cooked dish to a napkin and it immediately became soaked in dark oil. The chips beneath the fish were so soggy with oil we could not eat them.  I brought it to the waitress' attention and she shrug and said she could bring some new ones.  As we picked the soggy crust from the fish our chips didn't arrive until we had enough of everything.

Walked in, the place was certainly not fresh and new, could use a facelift but had the food been good that would have been a small price to pay, BUT... we ordered a corn-beef hash breakfast and what should have been a simple bacon and cheese omelet. My omelet was to come with three ingredients so that would have been bacon, cheese and I asked for avocado. I asked if they would substitute tomato slices for the potatoes and was told absolutely! I am not a fan of runny eggs so I asked that they make sure the eggs were done, again was told absolutely no problem. Our breakfast arrived quickly and our waitress had been attentive, so far so good! I cut into my omelet and runny egg spread over my plate. I summoned the waitress and showed her the eggs,  she promptly took it back to the kitchen, what came back out was a horror story, each half of the omelet had been \"grilled\" hard, put back together in two pieces and new cheese melted over the top! I asked for the manager and the omelet was removed from our bill, at that time she asked about the other meal, the corn-beef hash, which incidentally seemed to just be sliced from a can (still in perfect can sized circles) it certainly wasn't made in house! We stated it was \"ok\" but edible. We received our bill and indeed the omelet had been removed but I had been charged almost $5.00 for avocado and tomato slices, needless to say it was another manager call back.  I am not a fan of Ellis Island Cafe and would certainly not return or recommend it to anyone visiting Vegas.",

    "text": "Not impressed by the seating staff, particularly the Manager. They might be to used to how Vegas customers are? Maybe they don't care because they get enough business they didn't need ours? Either way I felt really sorry for my sister and the situation we had come from here. We traveled from Riverside, Ca to celebrate the weekend with my niece for her 21st birthday. My sister kept assuring me she'd heard of this place Ellis Island that was to be fabulous. I went along with it even though, who the hecks even heard of this place? I took the family on a site seeing walk and joined them at the casino. I attemped to put our name in and was not accepted because of the amount of people in our party. What??? Who doesn't want business? Who doesn't want to work with an obviously anxious group? Who condones such behavior? Yes, we did travel in a group of 16 but when ever we've traveled before we've never been turned away. I will admit I didn't behave with the best of attitude either at this point because of the hostility and unwillingness to work with us. They were saying they only seat of to 8, and we could break into 2 groups but being seated up to 35 mins apart and not even on the same side. Really? After we were finally seated in 4 parties of 4, my party on the whole other side out of view of the rest of us, I asked for the manager! Let me tell you don't waste your time. He litterally told me he wouldn't of seated us and was trying to convey we should just be happy were seated. I had to leave, I couldn't contribute money into an place that treats customers like this. I left our family there and felt horrible for ruining what was to be my nieces 21st luncheon with her family from California-Utah...I had to taxi it back to the hotel since I had been on foot and was getting a ride back originally. And when you have a husband, 9 year old and 2 year old and try to get a taxi it really was the icing on the cake.  So word to the wise, only go there if you have 4 or less because that seems all they like.",

Waiter looked at us on and off for 20 minutes before coming to our table and then only after we asked another waiter to get his attention.  After taking our order took another 20 minutes for our drinks and an additional 30 minutes for our food.  Salads made with brown wilted lettuce.  Food was far below average.  Edible, but just barely. Waiter couldn't be bothered to serve properly but stood at the table's end and, thumb on top of the plates,  reached across everyone to serve like on a prison slop line.  Bus boy walked up with a plastic tray half full of dirty plates and garbage, held it by my face so that I could look in, and cleared the salad bowls. I called the cafe manager over to complain and, instead of remedying the situation, he said \"well, I'll let you tell the waiter\" and walked away.  I would eat at a Salvation Army homeless kitchen before going back.",

Fast excellent service, Luis Carlos is the bomb!  Food is definitely better than what one would expect.  New York steak & shrimp, $12.99. Order your steak a bit more to the rare and you will be good.  Tender and tasty, Shrimp was very nice and crisp.  Had Calamari and it was done nicely, would have preferred for the marinara to not be so chunky.  Fresh lemon & homemade cocktail sauce really made it.  French Onion soup was rich and hot with lots of cheese.  House salad was crisp and fresh, Bob's Big Boy 1000 Island lovin' hubby was quite well pleased with theirs.  And you definitely cannot complain with a $2.25 (at the bar) and $2.50 (at the table) 16oz craft Beer.",

This restaurant is inside the older casino by Super 8. I almost missed this driving by on Koval Lane.  The wait is surprisingly short given the holiday weekend.    The steak special is good and inexpensive ($10).  Please order it medium rare as i find it to be a bit on the tough side with medium.  With the price/quality ratio, i am not complaining.   I used to love hitting the Vegas buffets, but all of the them have raised prices too high recently.  Let's not compare this to Ruth Chris. But it is definitely good on the value side of things.  It reminds me of the $3.99 prime rib in the old Vegas days in the late 90s.    I haven't tried the prime ribs yet but i will when i come back next time.",

The special was by word of mouth, so it was a special treat. But now that they advertise it & require you to be a card member, I think they sacrificed quality over quantity.  Steak used to be so moist, tender and juicy but now that they probably rack out so much steak every day, lately I've been having super dry steak. You used to be able to order Caesar Salad with the special, but now you have to order it separately for almost $9, which is more expensive than the special and lastly, the price went up as well.   Honestly, I wanna love this place again. Hopefully they do improve their quality of food soon so it can remain the best deal for steak in town.",

We never received refills. We were hoping that despite the appearance of this place, the food would be decent, because we had heard good things about the food in the pub.

First impression, don't have any expectations coming in and you'll enjoy this place. Decor is old and dingy but that's what you can expect. Servers are nice and the food came out in decent time.  They are known for steak and eggs which I got. My steak was medium and came out pretty much perfect, very tender inside and still a bit red. As for the bread, potatoes, and eggs, they are very typical you'd find at any diner, nothing special. My friend got the lunch special with the meat patty 50% bacon and 50% beef. He didn't like that at all. My other friend got chicken steak which was a really nice portion.  Overall good place for a cheap lunch, I would come back.",

It also comes with a salad to start and a free beer! All for $10!!!!!  A couple people in my group ordered meat loaf and they loved it. That was $7.   You think bc of the way the casino looks that this place would be ghetto and the food would be gross. BUT...this place is a hidden gem!!

And still didn't get it right (2 stars) value: not as good a value on the price as before,  service could use some work (2 starred review).   FYI -  they must have recently raised their prices on the 8oz steak and eggs deal. There was a sign in front of the Cafe that lists it as now $6.99.   So I was hankering for prime rib without the exorbitant price tag.  We decided to hit Ellis Island for some eats after the good reviews/pics on Yelp. As their top sirloin steak special is listed perennially on Las Vegas advisor as one of the top 10 deals in Vegas,  we thought we could check it as well. This joint is no secret from the locals who frequent this place. At 11am on a Sunday,  there was a half hour wait for a table of 2.  Just FYI -  the steak special with 20 oz Ellis Island craft brew is $9.99 with their players card. (It isn't $8.99 like the signs say in the hotel) If you play $5, you will receive $2 off this deal. You have to redeem both these coupons at one of the player card kiosks.   Also,  despite what their website says,  they also raised the price of the prime rib dinner to $14.99 from $13.99.  Both the steak special and the King cut prime rib special comes with green beans,  choice of potato/rice, soup/salad and a choice of their Ellis Island craft beer or root beer.   The highlight of the meal was the root beer. Creamy with a hint of spiciness, it was pretty wonderful and I would not hesitate to get it again.   After that, our side salads arrived at the table which were pretty generic. It was basically iceberg salad from a bag with a tomato on top with really cheap croutons. Not something you would order on its own  but because it comes with a meal,  it's okay. For a side salad, it was a pretty good portion.   Next came our main entrees.  My prime rib,  ordered medium rare, came out medium well. Being as hungry as I was, I just ate it. It tasted not bad for the price with some minor fat and bits of gristle. It just isn't a superlative experience. The portion size was respectable (like a regular cut of prime rib) but certainly not a super large portion as suggested by the \"king\" cut moniker they use. The meat comes with horseradish and au jus.   The hubs' top sirloin steak special fared a bit better although the cut was a bit too lean(didn't melt in your mouth). It was done to a perfect medium rare with a bit of charred flavor from the grill.   The green beans were a bit overdone and stringy but adequately seasoned with a good amount of garlic. The baked potato was okay and large but lacked the perfect golden crispy skin.   If it were only the food,  I would give this place a fair 3.5 stars with the half star bump up purely from the awesome root beer. However service was spotty at best and I think it had more to do with our server.   Although friendly enough, she forgot things - like the waters we asked for. After we got our food,  she checked in with us once and then we didn't see her for a while. Finally,  it took 20+ minutes to get our check done incorrectly. It took her 3 corrections and she still didn't get it right (she forgot our coupons, then she didn't put all of them in, then she forgot to take off the charge for root beers which is included in the price of the meal). She did some sort of correction where the fees for the root beer were waived but we still paid tax on them... Even though the meal price included the root beer! At 25 minutes in, we weren't going to argue about it. But it is largely the principal of the matter that was bothersome.   Overall,  the food is okay but the service needs to be better. Is it worth a half an hour wait and 20+ minutes of messed up checks? Not so sure. If you consider that Station Casinos offers prime rib buffets for $16.99 on weekends, the price for the prime rib dinner is not so great (after experiencing the lackluster salad bar and cooked veggies at Feast buffet this week, it still beat the side salad/veggies offered here hands down). The price of the steak dinner however is a decent deal only if you get the aforementioned coupons. Given this experience, I give this place a 2 starred review.",

    "text": "A prime rib dinner with a salad or soup and two sides for only $14.99?!?  Count me in!  I was surprised to arrive with a 45 minute wait on a Saturday night since this was not exactly the prettiest place in town.  It's a cafe with a lot of casually dressed, possibly older crowd.      While not on par with Mastro's, Ruth's Chris, or Morton's by any means, for this price point, I would say the prime rib was pretty damn good and tender too.  They said it was only 12 oz, but I've worked at a steakhouse and it looked more like 16 oz to me.  It  was a big cut of prime rib for sure!  If you're super hungry they have a double cut of 24 oz for $26.99!  It comes with your choice of salad or soup, sauteed garlic green beans, and a baked potato, fries, or mashed potatoes.  I opted for double green beans.  I was so full from this meal I could barely eat the next day.  My brother got a steak and eggs for only $10.49 which is also good, and the rest of our party got the prime rib dinner and could barely finish, so being the garbage disposal that I am, ate part of their steak.   I definitely hit my protein macros for the day!  Katie, our server, was super quick and on top of it, knowing that we were on a time constraint and was unaware the wait would be so long.  She was incredible, so I'm not sure what these other people ragging on the service was talking about.  Everything came out in a timely manner.  The bill came out to $60 with tax.    Not the best ambiance, and it's in an old, unassuming casino behind the strip, but if you're looking for some good, cheap steak, this is THE place to hit up!",

Here's why: when they ask you how you want your steak, it actually goes into their ears and is somehow relayed to someone in the kitchen who cooks it that way. Novel approach! (And a nice contrast to the 5.99 shoe leather and eggs deals which are everywhere in vegas)  The food is good, service is quick and friendly,  and you can get your blackjack on afterwards (Who cares it's 8am on a tuesday... no I don't have a problem).  Also: sit in Rosie's section. She's amazing.",

Another couple along with my wife and myself arrived in Vegas Sunday AM and were looking for a reasonably priced place to eat some Breakfast/ Brunch.  I had read some reviews and recommended trying Ellis Island.  We were very happy with our choice.  There was a $6.99 special for an 8 oz NY Steak and eggs that was very good and a heck of a deal.  We also ordered the Chicken Fried Steak and eggs, which had a yummy beer batter on it, I believe.  One of our friends had the Hangover burger, which he devoured quickly.  Everything was excellent and you could tell it is a popular place for locals.",

I had only recently heard of this place and their breakfast specials including the chicken fried chicken & eggs but I just had to get the steak & eggs and it hit the spot for sure. I ordered mine cooked medium, stayed with the country potatoes and white toast. The steak was decent cut sirloin. I think I would order medium rare next time as it was cooked more than I'd like towards the ends. I heard later on from cousins that frequent the place for this same special that they always order down as they tend to slightly overcook their steaks. Duly noted. But my meal was enjoyable nonetheless. The steak hit the spot. I enjoyed it with the provided A1 sauce. The country potatoes were fried crispy and were just the way I like it. Perfect with some ketchup. The toast was super buttered and I enjoyed it with my runny eggs. I was tempted to put some strawberry Smuckers on it as they had some on the table but it was great the way it was. I must say, they put a lot of butter on their toast.  Service was attentive. We were checked on throughout the meal and our drinks were refilled without us having to ask. The hostess was friendly. Our wait time for that sunday brunch was about 20-25 mins for a party of 2. Free parking on their lot.",

It was my gfs first time there so I was curious how she would react as Ive had the steak several times.   The meals in the end were great. I had my steak cooked medium, baked potato (sour cream/butter), beans, chicken soup. The meals came before the soup but we didn't care. In the end, the plates and bowls were cleaned. My steak wasn't difficult to cut through and had a great flavor to it. I also had a homemade root beer to quench my thirst. My girlfriend enjoyed her meal just as much as I did.   So if you are thinking of stopping by then I encourage you to do so. Stop paying $50+ for steaks and $10 for sides. Although this isnt the same \"quality\" its sure as hell worth trying out at least once.",

    "text": "Another hidden gem! Balling on a budget.  It was a Tuesday night on my anniversary and my boyfriend and I wanted to do something fun/different but not spend a ton of money. If you know us we like alcohol, occasional gambling and local deals.   I could not believe there was a 40 minute wait at 11pm at night to eat at this little ol restaurant at Ellis island. My boyfriend raved about it and I could see others thought the same.   We sat down and got the steaks. Honey got steak and eggs. I got steak, potato and greens. Both came with a salad. The blue cheese was super tasty. Dressing came on the side which is good for those picky people. I love mine drenched and it was enough to do so. They were amazing portions. I couldn't even finish my food. The best part was the service. Our waiter was an older man with a Russian accent? I don't know but damn was he fast. Whipped in to take our order. Whipped out. I swear I could have blinked and our drinks were refilled. It was the best. I cannot explain how amazing the food, service and ambiance was. Now I'm NOT talking romantic, quiet, dimmed.. I'm talking every individual in the place was chowing down and laughing. It was a good time and that's where I want to be! Another positive point was price. Food is ridiculously cheap, I don't even see how they can make a profit. Our bill came to Less than 20 bucks with two salads and two entrees. Whew! The rest of our money then was able to be spent on booze and gambling. Score! It gets old going to super classy restaurants where I have to Get all dressed up in a dress I can't breathin and heels I can't walk in year after year. This was a perfect change.. Best anniversary yet haha.",

    "text": "It is all about the steak special here!  The service is slow, but their microbrews are good (especially Hefeweizen and stout).   Anyway if you are new to their players club and play $5 win or lose you get the deal for $7.99. If you don't want to play you can just join the club and print off a $9.99 steak deal.   The steak is really quite good. About an 8 oz sirloin. Not a bit of gristle or fat on it unlike many steaks. It was cooked perfectly with a huge plate of garlicky green beans (which I don't eat but my friends liked). And it comes with baked potato and green beans!  And their microbrew 20 oz beer are like $2.25. Amazing deal and good food!",

A seemingless endless salad smothered in a satisfying dressing. Steak soft & flavorful, sliced & placed over the salad. The bb-q chix is half a small bird. Comes w/starch, veggie & salad. Hankering for their fish that was off the menu this night. After the kitchen remodel, can't wait to come back.",

    "text": "Decent food for the price you pay, but you've gotta jump through hoops just to get it.   Village Pub is located inside Ellis Island and is the primary restaurant that has the deals they advertise all over the property and online. Their most notable deal is the $6 steak and egg breakfast deal which is STRICTLY for the breakfast period as well as the $8 steak dinner meal.   * PLEASE DO NOT CONFUSE THE TWO DEALS LIKE I DID.*  The $8 steak dinner meal comes with mashed potatoes and string beans. In order to qualify for it, you'll need to join the Passport Players Club which you can do in the casino on a self kiosk (one is also located next to the entrance) and you will need to bet at least $5 on the same day you plan to redeem the reward. Once you've betted at least $5, you'll have to go back to the kiosk to print your voucher so you can give it to the server.   If you're a hotel guest of Ellis Island, you can also redeem your breakfast vouchers here for about 20% off any entree on the menu. This is way better than the continental breakfast they have at the cafe which is basically a bread basket.   * MEALS *  CORNED BEEF AND EGGS: this meal was absolutely delicious! I loved the corned beef even though it was a little dry. They will make the eggs however you'd like it and it also comes with potatoes and toast of your choosing.   STEAK AND EGGS: much better than the one at Tuscany Suites. The steak here is thicker and juicier than Tuscany, which is flat and dry. Even if you're spending a little more here, the quality is definitely better. You also get eggs, potatoes, and toast.   HAM AND EGGS: pass on this one for sure. The ham was so dry and there wasn't any honey on the table to salvage it...  BUFFALO WINGS: delicious! The wings weren't too big and the sauce wasn't too hot. They do have additional hot sauce on the table if you need it. Comes with ranch dressing.   -- Overall, I have to give this place 3 stars because their service is alright but they take FOREVER to do anything. Too few servers working too large sections. I also disliked how there were so many conditions to redeeming their deals. It shouldn't be this hard to get a meal for the advertised price but I was always jumping through hoops just to get them. It didn't seem worth it to me in the end, but hey, at least they honored it for me!  (27/100 - 2018)",

    "text": "Village Pub and Cafe, located inside Ellis Island Hotel and Casino, is known for its inexpensive fare.  The food isn't great, but it's far from terrible (it's hit and miss, depending on what you order), and at the prices they charge, no complaints.  I had the steak special for $12.99 with a baked potato as a side, and was a little surprised that the baked potato was literally that -- a baked potato, with no toppings, although it did come with butter and sour cream on the side.  The garlic green beans were delicious, however.  The alcohol prices were also good, with a glass of wine at $4.50 or a half liter for $6.96.  No brainer as to what I ordered!    If you're looking for a relatively inexpensive place to eat, whether it's breakfast or dinner, Village Pub and Cafe is the place to go.  However, don't expect the best food ever -- it is what it is, which is solid, decent food at affordable prices.  The service is also good, and there is free WiFi that connects instantly; no annoying login page that takes five minutes to pop up.  [Yelp collections: Vegas 2018; Cheap Wine]",

Although they make you jump through hoops for the $7.99 steak special, it does satisfy (according to my mom since I had the fish and chips).  To get the $7.99 steak special you have to sign up with their players club, spend at least $5 on games, then go to the reward kiosk where you print out your ticket. Thirty minutes later and you're on your way to that $7.99 steak special... that you could have paid $12.99 regular price for.   My dad and I had the fish and chips which were so good and filling and only $9.99! I usually follow a vegetarian diet, so I felt a little guilty having the fish. But it was good! Heavy, but good.   It may look like the entire casino is closed and boards up on the outside since it's undergoing construction, but there is an entrance in the front! Parking in the back.

I asked about which soups were gluten-free on the menu and the waitress hesitated and didn't seem to know. She went to go ask, which is totally fine, and she said the French Onion soup was gluten free. The cheddar broccoli one contains flour. Alright, so I went with the French Onion Soup. When it arrived, it came out... with a loaf of BREAD inside. Lol. I think this restaurant could do with educating their staff about the allergens in the food! How could someone think this was gluten free?? I let her know and the soup came back bread-free. It was super salty and didn't have much in it, it was very light and not worth even 5.99.   The loaded fries were flavorless and looked like they just melted a slice of cheese on top. Bacon was minimal, didn't receive the sour cream.   My friend ordered the grilled chicken breast, and something about it didn't settle well with her stomach. Overall unpleasant experience :/",

I go to the front counter and ask her if we can sit at a different booth and she looks irritated and takes us to a larger booth and again repeats that it will be a long time before anyone takes our orders.  The server finally arrives and she was great but the prime rib was the worst I've ever had.  It was cold and had a rubber feel to it.  An overall crap experience.  Won't be going back.

The reviews were not far off.. my hubby and I ordered the same- both medium rare- him- baked potato, me- mashed potatoes. Mine was good maybe a tad over cooked and not very flavorful, his was a tad too bloody and still lacking flavor. Green beans were cold like previous reviews have stated.  My daughter ordered fettuccine Alfredo with chicken, she hated the chicken tasted fake. The onions and pickles were good, but between 2 people (my daughter didn't care to try both) it was a lot. We probably won't be back unless I'm drinking there for October fest and be too drunk to remember eating there! On a plus note, clam chowder was pretty good and tasty! Service as well!   If you really want good prime rib go to Silver Sevens, love it there and cheaper with the players card.. go to Ellis for delicious, cheap beer!   Cheers!",

It's too bright and really noisy. The service was really slow and the food just Meh- but what a deal!  The Filet Cut Top Sirloin is only $7.99. That's amazing value for money, especially since it comes with Soup or Salad, Veggies, and Potatoes. Beware though: the Baked Potato was a rock. The Steak Fries were good.   However, what does \"Filet Cut\" really mean? Small? Yup!   The sides were great but the meat was small and tough. Soup and Salad were standard run-of-the-mill. But again-- $7.99! Come on!   I'm giving it 3 Stars because the Ellis Island Casino is fabulous! And it is a great deal - but don't expect anything fancy!",

Philly cheese steak sandwich usually has thin sliced beef, this sandwich featured a thicker cut of sliced beef about a quarter inch thick.  My friend had the Fried Chicken which was excellent. I think it was half a chicken because it had four pieces (breast thigh wing drumstick) and it seemed like it was cooked to order.  That was worth coming back.  Also they had homemade root beer for their root beer floats. The root beer was interesting and unlike any root beer I've ever tasted. It was was pretty good but unfortunately, it was kind of small being about 12 ounces.",

Breaks my heart.   We weren't greeted by the hostess nor  manager at the front check in, despite my morning pleasantries. Once seated,  we waited seven minutes for a server to approach us, only to say \"be right with you.\" She walked by three minutes later, and in passing said, \"sorry to keep you waiting, \" but kept walking.  She returned five minutes later, only because I sat back and stared at her as she attempted to pass us again. Fifteen minutes!   Not acceptable.  Once we got her at our table, no greeting or intro with name. \"Yall know about our steaks? How do you want yours? \"  I didn't want nor eat steak.   We gave our food orders, and I had to ask if we could order drinks.   It's been 42 minutes since we were seated, and still no food. I can't believe this. Can't tell if it's short staffed today,  or what; but all the more reason for more welcoming attitudes and support from the manager.",

This place is really really busy because the prices are so cheap.  The service itself kind of sucked, but it was very busy and not many servers there.  It did take a while to get our check, but my tummy was happy so I had some patience.  The parking lot here is pretty small. The casino itself is pretty smokey because it's an older one.  And there seems to be karaoke there every night.  Some people were good and others made my ears bleed.  But I guess that's something that always happens during karaoke.  If you're in the area, you have to try this place out for some good cheap food.",

The Chicken fried steak, and even better the chicken fried chicken are better than any restaurant in the country! (At least that I've been to). Everything else is great too though I will openly admit - I've never had anything but breakfast. But waffles, pancakes, bloody mary's, steak & eggs - everything is awesome and plentiful for your vegas morning! So why did I knock a star off? A few things. Service is often hit or miss. They always seem understaffed, and it's getting more popular... Saying this, I can deal with it. The prices are astoundingly low for what you get, so I'm fine with dealing with pot-luck service. Second, and honestly this is the big one at the moment- A few months ago they changed their hashbrowns. They used to be these nice chunks, and each one was PERFECTLY fried like crisp french-fries. I could go just for those!  Well. they are gone, and now they are these small 1/4\" squares that look like they are straight out of a Sysco bag. Soggy cat food would be the best description. They are nasty. Even the staff knows and has said there have been a lot of complaints. It used to be you could clean your plate here of food as everything was so good. Well... the hashbrowns have ruined that. Pitty. I assume they are cheaper. Saying this, all in all, I\"ll be back, and maybe enough people will complain to get the nasty hashbrowns to be replaced and get this back to a 5 star yummy.",

You can just go play $5 blackjack tables or watch Sunday football during the nfl season if you need to wait. You get your steak which is decent and of course not the best but it will do.

It was quite an interesting dining experience. It was taxi cab confessions, all the men were discussing crazy cab stories so we just sat back and silently chuckled.   The steak and eggs for $5.99 was worth the price...nothing to rave about. The waitress was friendly and you can tell she deals with these cab guys on a daily. The silver wear was DIRTY...like pretty nasty looking. I felt very awkward sitting in that cafe at that time, we were pretty much starred at our entire meal...as if we didn't belong.

Had dinner here with a friend this past May and ordered the Split Pea soup. Surprise!!! Bit into a big pork bone. I could have cracked a tooth or worst, choke on it! Called server immediately and showed her the bone. She was apologetic and understanding of my shock. After waiting for about 15 minutes, a very rude woman, who said she was the Manager, approached the table. She said that she had been to the kitchen and asked for the soup to be discarded. Not apologizing nor showing any concern or understanding for what had happened. She walked away. The saying is right: you get what you pay for and Ellis Island got this woman as the restaurant manager. And I got a check for soup that I could not eat! I had actually gone back to this place to give it a second chance after a previous visit during which, after almost a 45 minutes wait after placing my order, I asked the server if my food was coming, to which she replied: EVENTUALLY!!! Needless to say, I got up and walked out. It is sad that because of the volume, based on location- restaurants have complete disregard  and disrespect for the clients that keep them in business as most of the customers are mostly one-time visitors.",

Anyways it was a GOOD steak and eggs.  Also split a greek omlette with feta cheese on top, it was okay.  They're known for their cheap, filling, and yummy breakfasts!  Of course you can just gamble while waiting to be seated.  Smells heavily of smoke in here...",

I was surprised that we got seated in 20 minutes so the experience was starting off good. We sat down waited for a waiter and we had to call one over and we asked can we move to a booth and he said go ahead so we moved.   We sat for good 10 - 15 minutes and the manager on duty approached the table and asked, were you assigned here and we told him no. Without even letting us explain why we are in that seat he just said well you need to move to the seat you were assigned to. My boyfriend asked can we move to the other booth and he said no. I felt so embarrassed and never felt so put out so I said lets just leave and instead of the manager trying to fix it he said okay you can leave.   My boyfriend and I both work in the industry and thought this was a very inappropriate way to treat customers. We go here a lot but after this experience we will not be setting foot in there for a very long time.",

    "text": "On a Saturday night (Septemer 24,2016) we entered the restaurant.  We were told one hour wait for a table--we were fine with that for a party of three.  58 minutes later we were seated.  Beverages were brought and we placed our order when they were brought.  Carlos the waiter was attentive and brewed me a fresh pot of decaf coffee.  Then the wait started.  At 9:15 we still were waiting for our food.  We called for the manager.  He came rushing over and loudly wanted to know our problem.  His name is Allen and he is the general manager.  My son explained we had been waiting an hour for our food.  Allen bent over yelling into my son's face and finger pointing demanded to know when he was seated in THAT CHAIR.  I showed him the text message that indicated 8:17 pm when we were seated.  Without word he rushed over to hostess to see if we were lying or not.  Then he came back and said our food would be the next order out.  No apology for yelling at us--no apology for not believing us.  It turned out our order was not put in to the kitchen until 8:59 pm.  The food came out.  My daughter-in-law's steak which had been butter-flied so it would be cooked to her order was so covered in pepper that she took one bite and became ill.  I tried it as well and had to spit it out because it was so bad.  They took away her meal and offered another but by then she was feeling ill.  My son was so upset, he could not finish his meal.  I was so upset I could not eat.  They did remove her meal and half of my son's from the check.  However it was not the wait for a table, or even the wait for the food so much as the RUDENESS of the general manager that made this the worst experience I have had in Las Vegas.  I am a local--you can bet that I will NEVER recommend this restaurant to anyone that visits here.",

    "text": "Food was average and service was SLOW.  Came here for dinner on a Saturday. We were told the wait would be 45min -- they asked for our phone # and said they would text us when we were up. Fortunately, the wait was only about 20min. BUT, this inaccurate time estimate might NOT be ideal for those who wander off to gamble in the casino while they wait.   After we were seated, it took FOREVER for the waiter (an older man) to come to our table and take our orders. Just waiting for the water probably took around 15min. Our food took around 45min since ordering to arrive!  I got the Penne Al Forno (~$9), a pasta with tomato cream sauce & lots of cheese. It was a small sized portion that was satisfying but I definitely could have eaten more. Taste-wise, it was good but not amazing. Definitely not something I would seek out or return to eat. Also, it came with a choice of salad or soup, but I got the salad which was just bits of lettuce and croutons.   My friends got the Fish and Chips & Prime Rib, which they both liked.   Overall, this place is an ok place to eat some all American comfort food. But expect to wait wait WAIT.",

    "text": "The date of this review is December 25, 2016.  On December 21, 2016, my wife and I decided to have breakfast at the Ellis Island Cafe located on Koval Lane in Las Vegas. The cafe is within a walking distance from The LINQ Hotel where we were staying and is open 24/7. We decided to drive there and that took us less than 5 minutes. We arrived there around 7:30 a.m. The parking lot in front of the cafe was full so we had to park in an adjacent lot and walk towards the cafe. Should have walked from the hotel and get our daily exercise. We were immediately seated in a booth.  My wife had the \"Two Eggs Any Style, $3.99.\" This plate consists of two eggs any style served with Potatoes O'Brian. I had the \"Ham Steak & Eggs, $7.99.\" This plate consists of grilled slice of bone-in ham steak served with two eggs and Potatoes O'Brian. Each plate comes with two slices of toast. Both meals were prepared to our perfection and they tasted great. Both of us enjoyed our breakfast at Ellis Island Cafe.  Our waitress was very nice and her services were perfect. The water and coffee cups were promptly filled.  In summation, the food was good for the price, parking was not as I would have expected, but the service was good. If we find ourselves in Las Vegas again, Ellis Island Cafe is a good choice.  Food = 5 stars Service = 5 stars Parking = 2.50 stars Overall = 4.25 stars",

I am a frequent visitor to LV and never make a trip w/out having a meal at Ellis Island.  You cannot go wrong with the cafe or BBQ joint here.  You will usually have to wait for a table at the Cafe' but be patient and enjoy the casino.  Definitely go for the steak special if you don't have a BOGO coupon, but I always get the Prime Rib.  IMHO it is as good of a prime rib as you will find in Vegas.  $2 Beers brewed in house, and friendly servers.  Sometimes the service can be a little slow, but this is a place to relax...no one should be in a hurry hear.  I'll review the casino separately, but it is a gem.

I am all for giving places the benefit of doubt so with that being said I agreed! Let's talk about service and how it's completely non existent in this place. I believed we arrived maybe around 2:00 AM seated quickly but that's when the problems started. Our server this morning was JOEY and wow what a smart ass he was. I didn't appreciate his service at ALL. Our table had questions on the menu and he just had this nonchalant ass attitude with us and thought that it was funny. I specifically had my issue with him because I decided on the Italian style omelet and inquired about having it made with egg whites. I asked him if it was possible and he says of course but it will be a charge ranging from maybe $2-4? I'm thinking to myself how don't you know the FIRM ACTUAL up charge on this but whatever he checked with the source whomever that was and confirmed it was $2. You are the server so know your menu! I said that's no problem at all go ahead and order it! When our food came everybody's plate came correct but mine. Want to guess what didn't get done? Yep! My omelet came full of cholesterol and yellow as ever! It was clear that my simple request didn't get put in because he was to busy being so damn condescending. We brought this to his attention right away and he brought me a small plate to scoop my plate of potatoes on and the says \"well do you want me to have them make it over\" DUH wtf? After about 20 minutes I had finished my side order of pancakes and some of my friends plate because she felt bad that I still hadn't received my order. Another person in our party didn't et her wheat toast that came with her meal and had asked 3 times for it! Just a complete train wreck he was unapologetic for all this and then when our bill came we had a random 6oz New York steak and eggs added to our bill and I was double charged for my omelette. When again we brought this to his attention he says oh only the manager can fix this hold on, took the bill and went missing! After waiting about 10-15 minutes we still haven't got our correct bill so we spotted the manager TRICIA who was behind the scenes flagged her down and said can we get this done asap?! Her response was somewhat like she cared and when I pulled her to the side to let her know the unacceptable behavior from her serve JOEY and the lack of hospitality she apologized. Did nothing about the bill though they made sure they still collected them coins! Won't be back that's for sure!",

    "text": "My family and I have been coming to the Ellis Island Cafe  for many years. The steak special has been synonymous with Vegas trips for us, so I am disappointed to write such a negative review. However, our most recent experience today was extraordinarily poor. We were seated and had our order taken like any other time. We asked for four cups of water prior to our order. We had to ask another three times before three of the four waters were finally brought. Then, we had to ask another 2x before our fourth cup of water finally arrived. Meanwhile, other tables around us received their orders of soft drinks and beer.   We ordered an appetizer in addition to 4 steak specials. We received our salads in a timely manner, but proceeded to wait an hour and a half before we received our appetizer of shrimp cocktail. We started seeing every table around us get their food (some of whom ordered steak specials). When we asked our waiter about our order he said that our food was coming and that it wasn't his fault since he wasn't the one making the food. Irritated by the brush off we spoke to the manager who assured us she would rush our order, which she did since the steaks came out rare though we ordered medium. We asked for our check so we could leave and showed the waiter the rare meat. The waiter told us he would show the kitchen how much they messed up...the waiter gave us our check and once again blamed the kitchen for messing up and gave us a $5 adjustment to our bill and a free side order of onion rings. I spoke to the manager again as I was irritated with the waiters disposition on the matter. She informed me that she does not work with the waiter often, but has gotten multiple complaints about him today...she also made sure to note she did everything she could to make things right. We felt that the manager was trying to brush us off as well, and seemed at most mildly concerned with the poor service and undercooked food. I guess what was disappointing was the fact that she wanted to deflect the blame rather than take any actions to rectify the situation.   We ultimately feel that the service was just plain poor. It was disappointing the lack of accountability taken and the lack of effort given to make amends for the ordeal. Furthermore, the waiter did not seem to want to take responsibility for his mistake and the manager only seemed to want to blame the waiter rather than make amends herself. I am disappointed that the cafe did not seem to care about providing such poor customer service and food quality.",

It tastes like a proper steak dinner. Many of the bargain steak dinners on the strip do not. Win-win. They brew their own beer too, and while I'm not a beer drinker, I'm told that it's tasty. Their other items are quite good too: I got this creamy tomato penne dish one time and it was to die for. It was only like $7 or something. So good and so cheap. Their burgers are good too. And every now and then, someone will get on the karaoke stage who will make the whole restaurant stop and listen.  I love the place.",

Fantastic and super budget friendly, I mean Super! Most places are an arm and a leg in Vegas. I would have gave it 5 stars, but our waitress was not super friendly. She did a good job, but must not have been in the best of moods. Give it a try, you won't be disappointed or hungry when you leave.",

    "text": "Our server Pedro made our visit to this establishment extremely memorable. The food was what one would expect given the menu and prices.  Pedro's authenticity in making a meaningful connection with each of his tables far exceeds any customer/server interaction I've experienced in quite sometime. In our jaded cell-distracted world we forget that those who serve us be it at a restaurant or a retail environment are individuals who are unique and are human beings deserving of our time and attention (especially in a town like Vegas). Pedro shook us from this complacency by simply fulfilling his role as a server with pride and to the best of his abilities. It wasn't through forced conversation or groveling but by being present and attentive. Watching him bounce between tables treating regulars with the familiarity of old friends transitioning to making a table with three kids laugh hysterically to the delight of their tired parents, then back to us to offer insight into how to best spend our remaining days in town.  The food won't disappoint it'll fill you up; having Pedro as your server will replenish your hope in society and remind you that decent humans still exist and it's an absolute pleasure to cross paths with one of those people if only for a brief while.",

Vee P of San Leandro, thanks for answering my question about the Prime Rib and wrote a great review!  For my main meal of the day, I had huge medium 16 oz. cut of Prime Rib for $17. With it your choice of baked or mashed potato or steak fries. Also a house salad or soup of the day.   My house salad looked pedestrian, but in this instance, plain was good. You could cut the meat with a fork. The au jus and whipped horseradish just made every bite perfect. The famous garlic green beans were seasoned well. Again, I broke training and smothered my baked potato with butter and sour cream.   I wish I could remember the name of my super sweet Mexicana server that was friendly and tended to my every need. She kept my soda full and checked in with me several times. Of course, I will look for her on my next visit. I'm going to have the Chicken dinner for the win!",

Margaritas - very delicious and great price NY Steak, shrimp & potato - only reason I gave a 4 star. The potato could have been just a little bit hotter but it was a great sized plate and the shrimp was perfect. Not what you would expect in price - we were so pleasantly happy with final coat on bill. So worth it.  About a mile from Planet Hollywood or a $8 dollar lyft for a great, filling meal!",

    "text": "We stayed at the hotel next door, but more than that there was good word-of-mouth about eating here along with good reviews....so we decided to check it out. Our findings:  DINNER: We used the voucher from the hotel for steak dinners, along with an order of loaded fries and fried pickles and a club house salad. There was a 10 minute wait for seating and service was a bit slow but they were busy. When the food came, it came hot and ready. The fries salad and pickles were above average and my medium well steak came as expected; a delightful meal.  BREAKFAST: My wife ordered a Denver omelet and I ordered steak and eggs, both orders with jack cheese. Eggs were good but the steak was miles better than what I ordered at dinner, still medium well but juicer. The server Christina was great too, talking us up and seemingly concerned if we were liking our meal or not...we did!  PARKING: We had access to hotel parking but when it was full we used the 3-level parking garage behind the casino and pub. It was free, with enough space to an SUV in it...plus, there were security cameras and roving patrols, a nice touch.  OVERALL: Probably the best bang for your buck! They also had Elvis performing 5pm Friday-Sunday I think, and karaoke every night in the smaller pub area. And of course, the casino...!  Worth checking out!",

    "text": "Conveniently located in front of the hotel I was staying at for the night! I've been wanting to try Village Pub for some time because a few of my friends mentioned their Prime Rib special. So glad I gave it a try!  PARKING: I think they have their own private lot, as it is inside the Ellis Island Hotel and Casino. I ended up just walking here because my hotel was right behind it.  LOCATION: Located inside Ellis Island. You'll see it past the casino, right beside the karoke bar.  RESERVATIONS: I think you can make reservations through Yelp, but I saw that there was no wait time, so I ended up coming here without a reservation. Once I got to the hostess, she told me that there was about 45 minutes for 3 people, which I thought was kind of dumb, but I decided to wait anyway. I ended up getting seated within 15 minutes!  RESTAURANT: Very casual dine-in kind of restaurant. It kind of reminds me of a typical casino cafe in Vegas. You just come to grab a quick meal for the night. There were plenty of booths and long tables for large parties. My friends and I got our own booth.  MENU: I was very impressed with the selection of food which varies from burgers to pasta, but my attention was drawn towards their prime rib special for about $17.99. The special came with a side of green beans, and a choice of mashed or baked potatoes or french fries, and soup or salad. It may not sound a lot, but it's actually enough to share between two people.  I ended up sharing mine with my roommate, and we barely ate through half of the prime rib. The prime rib was large and cooked a nice medium rare for us. I thought it was very tender and juicy, not bad for the cheap price! The mashed potatoes were delicious; the gravy was savory and tasted amazing with the potatoes. The green beans were okay and the salad was standard.  CONCLUSION: Definitely a decent place to stop by if you're staying nearby. The prime rib special is hard to pass, considering how much food they give you and the quality isn't so bad either! Good for leftovers as well if you're planning to save a little extra money in Vegas. However, service can be a bit slow, so be prepared for that!",

The place was half empty at midnight. We were served salad with supposedly ceasar salad dressing. It was so thick and heavy garlic taste. The salad leaf had black mold on it.    The first steak was overcooked (medium rare I wanted, instead nearly well done.  The second time it was very rare third time it was just regular steak and it tasted terrible. I didn't enjoy my meal at all. What a shame the quality has gone downhill. NO MORE STEAK SPECIALS HERE!!!! (steak, baked potato and string besns with a pint of beer included under 10 bucks, no longer offered!)    I would try this place one more time for the fish and chips I saw on the other table which looked good! My mood was spoiled so may be awhile before I ever go back.     They really need to work on quality control and customer service.",

This most recent trip we went there first for dinner, yet again having their steak special (for the cost of getting a slot card, and waiting in line to get a slip, you get a steak cooked to order, choice of potato, vegetable, and micro brewed beer or root beer).  A good meal at a great price.  Later on in our trip we also went there for breakfast, they have terrific reasonably priced omlettes and they also have a steak and eggs special (we had the omlettes).  While this isn't on the strip, it's only a short walk behind Bally's hotel/casino.",

    "text": "If you are in Vegas, GO HERE!  My boyfriend and I stumbled upon this hidden gem due to a marathon being held on the strip.  We needed to make our flight later in the evening, and the marathon was taking up the entire Las Vegas strip!  We decided to make the trek by foot to the Ellis Island Casino and Brewery, located just a block or two west of the strip.  This is where we found the Village Pub and Cafe, where we chose to have our last dinner in Vegas.  First off, service was excellent.  Our waiter was very friendly, attentive, and had a great attitude!  We both ordered the prime rib dinner, which was $16.99.  This came with a giant (what I believe to be) 14 oz. prime rib, a choice of potato, garlic green beans, and a choice of soup or salad.  This was our best meal in Vegas hands down.  I had the chicken noodle soup as the starter, which tasted homemade and is just what I needed after coming inside from cold weather.  The prime rib was so tender, flavorful, and juicy, and came with au jus that was perfect!  I thought the garlic green beans and baked potato were average, but by no means does that mean they were not good.    And one of my FAVORITE things about this place....not only was the food delicious, but it's a brewery!!  They had about 5-6 different beers on tap that were their own (Ellis Island Brewery) and 16 oz. pints were only $2.75!!!  Cheapest drink I had in Vegas the entire weekend.  The amber ale was perfectly malty and delicious too!  I would absolutely go back, and would recommend this place as a pit stop to anyone in Vegas!  It's also very walkable from the strip.",

We always eat at a lot of expensive and fabulous restaurants while we are in the city and this one is the same except...?   It is the most cost efficient restaurant I think I have ever been to.  Ellis Island Casino (where this restaurant is located) is slightly off the strip, but an easy 5 minute walk. Try not to get hustled along the way.  When you sign up for their Passport Players Club you get a coupon for a $7.99 steak special supper. This is NOT a small steak. It is a 10 oz. steak with potato, vegetables and a starter salad.   If you want to go back another time and get the same deal all you need to do is insert your player card and play $5.00 in a machine then go to the casino ATM and it will dispense you another coupon.   I gave this place 4 stars because my steak was no where cooked the way I ordered it and I had to send it back.  If you go during popular times you will have to wait.",

If you come for breakfast (before 2pm on weekends or before 11am on weekdays), they have this awesome deal on Steak and Eggs. It's a 10oz sirloin steak, 2 eggs, breakfast potatoes and toast. Definitely a lot of food, just for $6.99! Our wait was about 30 minutes on a Sunday around 1pm.   The food was great and I'd come back for sure. However, I was a bit disappointed in the service. Although our server was very nice and friendly, she forgot to bring out our toast. All 6 of us in my group got the steak and eggs and we were almost done with our plate and she still didn't bring out any toast. I reminded her and she brought out only some because she accidentally dropped it on her way to us. Some minutes later she brought out the remaining toast but it was the wrong kind. She said she would be back with the correct toast but never did. At that point, we didn't really want to wait any longer so we just let it be.  Hopefully it was just an isolated incident and they're not always so sloppy. Besides from that, I'd recommend this place to friends!",

We like to come here for the late night specials, or the very early morning breakfast specials. Very low prices, and a good amount of food here.   Recently we decided to try their supposedly amazing Fish and Chips, for dinner. First of all, we waited at least 30 minutes for the food, what I didn't mind, because I don't like my food rushed to my table either! We wanted to eat some soup while we were waiting, but the only choice was Chili beans, what we didn't prefer.  Finally got the Fish and Chips ... fish was terribly burnt and oily. Our waitress offered to get it re-ordered, but I said no, thank you, I am too hungry already, I don't think I could wait another 30 minutes. She walked away, and I thought, even she thought the fish was really burned and oily. Anyway, I ate the fish, but not the burnt batter. The Icelandic Cod was actually very tasty. It was served with seasoned steak fries, homemade tartar sauce and lemon wedges.   I will definitely come back some other times, maybe on a Friday, since they serve Clam chowder only on Fridays. And hopefully I can enjoy a better fish and chips, too.",

My steak was cooked to a medium and was juicy. The potatoes were well seasoned and the eggs were done right. There isn't really too much to complain and I've had some other steak and egg places in Las Vegas.. This place definitely has to be one of the top ones. Apparently, Ellis Island Cafe used to sell there steak and eggs at a cheaper price (it used to be $5-$7?) and now it is at $9.99.   Definitely better than Bill's Gambling Hall steak and eggs. I would come back for a late night dinner/breakfast after a night of partying. This place will hit the spot.",

I get the 1/2 rack of ribs and chicken.  The ribs fall off the bone and are seasoned to perfection.  The chicken is also very tasty.  Love the sauce.  it is sweet with a slight bite.  It also comes with two ears of corn on the cob, ranch style beans, cole slaw and bread.  You get a lot of food and it's about $12.  Plus, they are a microbrew and they have $2 20 oz beers.  And the service is good.  The only reason they don't get five stars is they are only open from 4pm-10pm (at least the BBQ part).  The regular cafe is 24 hours and I've heard it was good, too.  However, I like the BBQ too much to try the other part.  It is hard to beat this place for value and quality.   Only Adults 21 and over are allowed in the BBQ part.  Not sure why, but that's their rules.",

    "text": "I've been to Ellis Island a handful of times I can count. Recently I decided perhaps I would try their much raved about cheap and yummy breakfast served at their cafe with my sister in tow. She was staying at The Signature at MGM so Ellis Island was very close by.  When we arrived the cafe was busy. Not busy enough for us to not be seated quickly though. Our waitress came by and we were ready to order. There's not much to the breakfast menu, so you don't have a lot to mull over. I ordered the Denver omelet and my sister ordered the french toast with bacon. The prices are quite cheap, but not dirt cheap.  The wait wasn't long. Our food arrived rather quickly considering how many people there were in the place. My food was placed in front of me and I knew then why the food was that quick. I realize a Denver omelet isn't a gourmet meal, but mine looked meh. The green peppers were diced very small. The ham looked as though it had definitely come packaged and sliced into small bits. It tasted meh and it was a bit hard for my tastes. It certainly wasn't a nice, fluffy, soft omelet. The potatoes on the side were overcooked, but okay - nothing special.   My sister didn't feel good by the time our food came out, so she didn't eat her french toast. I'm not sure if it was good or not. Since we had to retreat quickly since she wasn't feeling well I was able to flag down the server quickly and get our reciept. I think she sensed our urgency and was quick about it, so at least that was nice of her.   The service, to me, was better than the food. Maybe I'll just stick to karaoke here and the beer and Metro Pizza every once and awhile.",

Ellis Island is off the strip and can be difficult to get a taxi back from, the seating is your typical sticky wooden tables, and the steak is usually overcooked and by no means great quality.  But for some reason, every Vegas trip of mine has to include a drunken trip here at 4 am for $5.99 steak and eggs. Sometimes 2 in 1 night for those friends of mine that are so drunk they forgot they went the first time around. And for the price, your drunk self will be happy eating the home style fries and soaking up the runny egg yolk with some buttered toast. I sure am every time.",

It's great for any cheap late night/early morning cravings when you're in the city that never sleeps.   Ellis Island Cafe is located in ... you guessed it! Ellis Island Casino and Brewery. The place is definitely a bit run down and it definitely shows. It's a fairly small casino which is found near the corner of Koval Ln. and Flamingo Rd.   Inside the casino, Ellis Island Cafe is just called \"Cafe\". The $5.99 special isn't really advertised on the menu, except written on a small chalk board by the hostess.   I'm definitely a huge fan of the steak and eggs here (which you can probably already tell). The steak is definitely delicious (however don't be expecting quality compared to Gordon Ramsay Steak). They also serve potato cubes instead of hash browns which I absolutely enjoy.   The service here can be a bit slow at times, and is a \"hit or miss\". I've came here and had some of the best service ever, as well as waiters that never came back to help us.   Overall, $5.99 steak and eggs really can't be beat!",

    "text": "Ellis Island is a local dive that's been around FOREVER, and they're mostly known for their karaoke. I used to hang out there back in the day when I worked at the MGM (because they used to let casino employees drink FOR FREE (!!!!! Can you imagine!!!! I can't believe I didn't get a DUI until 2010.)   Then for awhile, there was talk of imploding poor old Ellis Island for another douchey high-rise condo tower -- which thankfully, a little something called the Recession put the kibosh to! So Ellis Island still squats in squalor, in the shadow of the Strip (it's on Koval Lane, for all you non-locals...check it out!).  Either way, I'm here to tell you that the cafe here has an AMAZING steak special -- around $8 or so for a big-ass (8 oz or so) filet, with salad, green beans and a baked potato. PLUS a beer is included...but I hate beer, so I had a glass of wine (which cost extra, but not much). I thought the $7.77 steak special at Mr. Lucky's in the Hard Rock was good (and it really is)...but if you like beer, Ellis Island is the better deal. (But if you like fake tits and poseurs, then Hard Rock is the better deal for you.)  Aside from the steak special, they also serve typical Vegas cafe fare: breakfast, sandwiches, chicken-fried strippertits, etc. Something for everyone.  One caveat: every cheapass in town comes here, so if you go at regular mealtimes, there can be quite a wait. My advice is to do like me: sleep til noon, drink black coffee and bitch about stuff online til 5, hit the gym/go to work/run errands (whatever you have to do that particular day) til about 10...then head to Ellis for dinner at 11.  Hey, it's open 24 hours!",

    "text": "This place is located behind the strip and isnt the safest looking area. My friends and I went because we saw the advertisement they had for $3.99 steak, which I believe was actually changed to $5.99 or something. It was good eats for a 4am meal. I'm a fan of 24hr eateries.  Its located inside a casino and there's also a brewery inside the casino which we accidentally went into, so dont get confused, it's the cafe at the right corner of the casino.  There were two guys asleep on the bench where you wait for a table. There wasnt a long wait but they dont seat you until everyone from your party is there.  So overall, the food was pretty good but not AMAZINGLY good. We waited for maybe 15minutes after having the cashier call a cab. It's not on the Vegas strip so there's not a line of cabs waiting for you. But keep in mind, I went at 4am so it might be different at different hours of the day--- or night? lol",

During football games, they serve $1 homemade beers and other cheap appetizers that included $1 hotdogs. Overall, I really enjoyed myself. Their homemade bears were really tasty, and the $1 hotdogs were to my liking. I could tell they were a higher quality hotdog, and not some nasty piece of crap like I figured in the first place.

The food always brought me back regardless of the service however this experience I just will not be going back at all.  I spent $16 for prime rib when I requested ranch for my french fries which is prepackaged in a 1 ounce cup they wanted to charge me $.50. If I went to McDonald's and asked for a same one else prepackaged ranch they would not of charged me unless I requested six or more.  The meat had a sheen if it had been sitting under a heat lamp waiting for its side dishes to be cooked.  And when I asked for Caesar dressing on my salad, I was told it was a five dollar charge.  five dollars for Caesar dressing you're kidding me?  I don't care that we had a half hour wait and they were still plenty of tables I don't know of the behind the scenes situation. However with this experience I will be looking for a new restaurant that serves prime rib.",

    "text": "Got a tip from a co-worker that this was the place to go for a reasonably priced dinner in Vegas.  He also made allusions to picking up the tab to sweeten the deal.  Fine.  As they say in Vegas, I'm all in.  The cafe is tucked into the back of the Ellis Island Casino and Brewery, which is off the Strip just southeast of the Westin Hotel on Flamingo.  A three minute walk from there.    Once your eyes adjust from the glare outside to the darkness inside, the first thing that hits you is the cigarette stink.  Hey, it's Vegas, I know.  It's a casino, I know.  And this place is a throwback, I know.  I get it.  But god almighty, the place reeked of stale Marlboros long since converted to ash and emphysema.  Classic (some call it 'retro') vinyl booths and simple 4 place wood tables at which to dine.  Do not expect antiseptic cleanliness, however.  Everything I touched just kinda felt grimy.  Server took his time showing up to our table.  He was nice enough, but really slow.  Looking around, I saw LV bus drivers at one table, plenty of retirees, a cop or two and just a few random tourists in pleated shorts, t-shirts and sandals.  It's a local place, for sure.  Yep, the \"off the menu\" steak special is still there.  But you need to have the players card and a coupon to get it now.  Still, $8.99 for a hunk of meat, green beans, spud, salad and beer is a pretty good deal.  My co-worker ordered that.  I ordered the fish and chips with a salad and beer.  First, the beer was good.  I had a Hefe.  Coworker said his IPA was tasty as well.  SIde salad was typical iceberg with cherry tomato and croutons.  At least it was fresh.  Coworker said his steak was \"great\".  He didn't finish it, though.  Which kinda struck me as odd.  It wasn't like it was so gargantuan that he needed a stomach pump or a bucket, he just decided to take it back to his hotel room to \"have it for breakfast\".  Whatever.  My fish and chips was impressive looking.  3 huge slabs of freshly made cod, dipped and deep fried resting on a generous bed of 'chips'--you know, thick cut french fries.    But...the fish was really greasy (and kinda dry, alas) and the chips were soggy--all of them.  No amount of lemon, malt vinegar, tartar sauce or ketchup could save what really was a balloon angioplasty in a basket.  I rarely have fish and chips, but the menu said that it was one of the 'house specialties'.  I didn't come close to finishing because the grease really was overpowering.  So...some greasy food served up in a cigarette stank house where you sit on vinyl booths that stick as you move around.  Bottom line: good beer, it's cheap (for Vegas), old-school throwback cheesy (it's Vegas) and certainly will fill your gut, if that's what you want, and if you disregard what your cardiologist might say--and hold your nose for the stink.    As they say, what happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas, indeed.  Keep it there.  I won't be back.",

Their fish and chips is one of the best I've ever had. It is 3 be huge pieces served with yummy steak fries all for under 10.00. I have never seen any fish pieces as big and thick as they are here, it's the one thing we come back for year after year. I highly recommend the fish and their club sandwich have as well. Two items not to be missed!",

They serve it with soup which tonight was the New England Clam Chowder and I could gladly have called that my dinner, but then came the perfectly cooked steak, potato and veggie (had corn instead of green beans).  The food was good!  We were looking for a casual steak place for when we don't want to get too fancy or spend the big $ on the other steakhouses so this works perfectly for those causal nights.  The rest of their menu is very affordable as well, clean, and excellent service.",

Its choices you have to make.  $2.50 for a draft beer, find that somewhere on the strip.  The prices for food are very low given the location.  Other strip hotels charge double if not triple for the same things.  Decide if you want to wait or pay way more money on the strip.  Love this place!!!",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I came here for a late lunch before heading back home. I did read a few reviews that mentioned the wait even though more than half of the dining room is open, and that's exactly what happened to us yet i was still surprised. Okay. No big deal, not enough staff to have a full house. I can understand. They text you when your table is ready so that makes up for it - you can roam a little, gamble a little (which is probably what they want you to do during the wait..), and grab free drinks   Anyway, we waited about half an hour which went by pretty fast.  I do wish they had a drink menu but there's an open bar and they have craft beer at $2.50 a glass! It's on their chalkboard walls but it's not always so convenient looking for it.   My boyfriend and I wanted to try both the chicken fried steak and the prime rib so we shared the two dishes. He started with their soup (which is delicious btw) and I just had a salad. We chose fries and mashed potatoes as our sides. Being a potato lover, I was disappointed. Neither of it was freshly made and the mashed potatoes were kind of hard/tasted old. The chicken fried steak was really salty, and that's what got me to eat the fries. My boyfriend really likes it tho! I haven't had prime rib anywhere else so I can't compare but I quite enjoyed it here. We left STUFFED with plenty of leftovers for like $30!  We originally heard about this place for their steak and eggs specials and were unclear on the details so we made sure to ask our waitress before leaving. They do still have the $6.99 special and it runs from 11pm to 11am (extended to 2pm on weekends i believe).   Our waitress was really nice and friendly!",

Then decided to try something else ordered the French onion soup and I'm 99% sure it wasn't the right cheese on it. It was like sweet Swiss.. with a roll as the croissant. And so I didn't have it on me to tell them that was gross too so I just paid for it and didn't take more then one bite. My husband ordered the 13.99 New York steak and fried shrimp and he said it was good. Not great but not bad... and for only 13.99 he would order it again but it wasn't good enough that he would ever want to go back. Also his came with a side salad and the ranch tasted sour.. overall it wasn't very good. Service wasn't great either. Wouldn't go back even if it was free..",

When the food came out, I will admit, the 10oz sirloin looked really good, and tasted as amazing as it looked- no surprise there.

    "text": "Where else in Vegas can you get perfectly cooked Wild Alaskan Coho Salmon on a bed of rice with vegetables and soup or salad for $11.49??  Ellis Island Cafe is off the beaten Vegas strip, only a block or two away, but is definitely worth checking out.   The food in Vegas is pricey whereas fabulous shows are comparatively cheaper than what you'll find in places like NYC. Years ago, the opposite was True. The shows are amazing so if you're going to spend money in Vegas, I would suggest spending it on the shows, not the food (or more precisely, the restaurant overhead).  To qualify my review, I've been to Gordon Ramsay's steakhouse, the Eiffel Tower Restaurant in the Paris Hotel, and Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill. All are 4+ star restaurants and have some great food but so does Ellis Island Cafe although you'll find it at a fraction of the price. The difference is you're not paying for expensive overhead, or handsome servers with British accents.  Ellis Island Cafe is a family restaurant with a Casino (of course) attached to it and the area might seem a bit sketchy but you are in Vegas, remember, and I'm sure you've seen sketchy if you've spent even a minute on the strip.   No worries, once inside you'll feel like you've entered a time machine. Burgundy colored pleather high-back booths and antiquish framed artwork adorn the dark wood paneling on the walls. If you can get past that, you're well on your way to a delicious, satisfying meal at a very reasonable price.  Excellent service, delicious food, great value.   Kudos Ellis Island Cafe!",

We arrived in the early afternoon for brunch and I was thrilled to see that they served breakfast all day. The place was crowded and people seemed to be ordering breakfast and lunch items.   We both ordered the steak and eggs platter and my mom wasn't pleased with her meal. She stated her eggs tasted like powder eggs and she couldn't eat them. She enjoyed her steak and mostly ate that with her potatoes. Initially she wasn't pleased with how red the steak was when we both requested well done. However, the steak was tender and nicely seasoned. I enjoyed my eggs, steak and potatoes. Our waiter was real sweet, however she seemed overwhelmed with the amount of tables she was serving and it took a little long to follow-up to refill my mom's coffee and my iced tea.    I remembered their popular rib dinners and informed my mom we would come back for it. Unfortunately we never made it to see if the ribs were how I remembered them big, juicy and delicious. I remember the rib dinner specials came with two small slices of bread, a small side order of Cole slaw, baked beans and two small corn on the cob a few years ago. We saw the sign that they served them starting at 4PM.  Whenever I am in Vegas I will be sure to check out breakfast and to return for those ribs.",

Off the strip, needed an uber $6.41 which was the base price.   Or you can walk through planet hollywood, to/through Paris hotel,  to/through bailey's then exited and walked outdoors about 4 blocks off the strip.   The casino looks like nothing from the outside, but pretty laid back, cool inside. Minimum  $5.00 tables, good mix deinks, sweet little semi-divey bar.   We will return when we want cheap plays, easy drinks, and a fabulous piece of rime rib!",

It's kind of like Walmart here. You can find all sorts of people from the sober to the ones you know won't remember anything the next day. I'm guilty to say my group usually consists of both kinds.   You can't expect too much from the chef at 3am, but most of the time the steak is cooked to my liking.   During the summer, we stopped by here after the pool party and they wouldn't serve our girlfriends who only had bikini tops on. Luckily there was a store nearby that was selling t-shirts so they bought some.   Be warned: it's extremely hard to catch a taxi in this area at this time, so use Uber if you can.",

    "text": "Ellis Island Cafe is probably one of Vegas's best kept secrets. Located in the Ellis Island Casino and Brewery, this place has some good eats at decent prices. I like how they have the vibrating tablets they give you if there is a wait so you can go about the casino and hit up a slot machine or just people watch.  If its your first time here, I recommend getting a player card so you can get all the perks that come with it like the 8.99 steak special. You get a fat juicy sirloin steak cooked to order (I suggest you get it medium rare) green beans, and your choice of mashed potatoes, baked potato, rice pilaf, or fries. You also have a choice of salad or soup. Lastly, it also comes with a your choice of beer or root beer. This price applies to all people in your party. For 8.99 that's a very good deal. Just make sure to go to the players kiosk towards the left of the cafe to print out your 8.99 voucher.  They also have great breakfast specials. So for you drinkers, the steak n egg special is great for hangovers. Did I mention these guys are 24 hours? Yup. Nothing better than a decent steak at 2 or 3 in the morning.   As for the atmosphere, I thought it was very roomy. Plenty of tables and booths. The lighting is bit low but bright enough to notice your surroundings so it gives you that date night type of setting.   Service was pretty good. I was already gonna use my 8.99 steak meal voucher when the waiter noticed I also had a dollar off voucher next to it. He proceeded to tell me I can use it in conjunction with the 8.99 voucher. Wow. I assumed you couldn't use two vouchers together but after going over it, there was not anything that said you couldn't. Props to our waiter for that. I should of got his name so he can get recognition. Next time I go I will look for him.  Where they are situated I think is in a very good location. They are literally a few blocks away from the strip so its walking distance from a lot of the major casinos. So whenever you drive by this place and not even think twice about it, check it out, im glad I did or I would have never known about the great specials.",

That's amazing considering that the steak comes with a side and garlic green beans. The steak is slightly over cooked so order one off from what you normally order (i.e. You like med rare steak = order rare; you like well done = order med well.). This worked for me and others at the table. Anyways, great steak dinner. Would definitely be back of more steak. Also the calamari appetizer was surprisingly good.",

Ricardo, super nice and very memorable, always refilling our drinks and hooking us up with the steak deal that you need to ask about that isn't on the menu.

I had the salad with their homemade balsamic dressing and the soup since my boyfriend didn't want his, and it was so good. The steak, green beans, and mashed potatoes were excellent! I think this was the best meal we had in Vegas. No need to win money at the casino here when you will win with this dining experience.

    "text": "Don't believe the good reviews. This place makes a bad diner look good.   First, after waiting over and hour, they tried to seat our party of five at a small table for four when there were bigger tables available.  Then they didn't want to move us to a bigger table.   Our son just eats pasta with butter. At first the waiter said if it's not on the menu we can't order it. We had to convince him to just do pasta with marinara without sauce, yes, that's how we had to order it. Next, our appetizer came 10 minutes after the entrees, I'm just confused about that. My brother-in-law ordered the pork chops (waiter said they were good). It (one) was over done and came with canned vegetables, ew. I had the steak and shrimp which was adequate. The rest of the meals were just okay (cheap diner food).  However, about 5 hours after the meal and my stomach is still a little funky.   I do have to say that the waiter was very nice and very friendly.  I think he has to be when feeding people this stuff.   Ultimately, If you think cheap diner food is good then go here. Otherwise you can do much better almost anywhere else",

It's True, the special isn't on the menu, but stopped in after 11:00 pm, and the server confirmed the deal.  Great deal, good food, quick and friendly service!  Also, beer is only $2.  And listening to the drunkards karaoke at the bar next to the cafe is free entertainment.  Haha!",

Now mind you the steak here hasn't been aged for 6 year's in some type of sophisticated refrigerator nor are the cows given special diets or whatever.  Today, I came in to grab a late breakfast and paid a higher price 10.99 which didn't bother me, but I found that my server wasn't really on top of her game due to it being somewhat crowded but I tried to overlook it.  What bothered me is when I was given my check and I was informed that I would be paying her which is what I expected. I was sitting on my phone waiting for her to come back for at least ten minutes and I was going to leave her a 3 dollar tip in spite of the lackluster service ( tip would have been better, but I decided to leave a dollar instead as I decided to get up and pay the front instead. I ALMOST never tip so poorly and I am often chastised by my friends for being too generous, but frankly I was at the end of my rope.",

My boyfriend went w/ the porterhouse with a loaded baked potato and green beans w/ a side salad w/ ranch and a beer.  The service wasn't the best I've ever had but it wasn't the worst either.

Complete with singing Elvis, Karaoke and cheap casino restaurant prices like a bygone era, this is what I envision Vegas to be. I mean really what happened to all of the cheap places to eat? I thought you were supposed to save your money for gambling? Well, maybe it is cuz there are so many like myself who don't like gambling that most of the restaurants have upped their prices? Or maybe it's inflation? Either way, Ellis Island has succumbed to neither. Their prices make you feel like you are stealing and there food is great casino/diner food. What really puts them at 5 stars is the fact that they are a brewery and sell their craft beers for 2.50 for 20 oz. Wow! We spent $21 on breakfast including tip. Their chicken wings are quite good. I could probably eat here every day while in Vegas and be content. But at least come here once when the horrible Elvis impersonator is here :-)",

If you want an elegant steakhouse dinner in Vegas this isn't it.    But if you are looking for a good meal with Great Value and some old Las Vegas style you may like eating here.   The reviews looked good and we were excited to try \"Nevada's best craft beers.\"  We came looking for value and we were expecting a decent meal. But at just $15 it was both a great value and a meal.  Yes our prime rib came with green beans and your choice of potatoes, but It was delicious.  The beer selection was limited and the beers were just ok.  The barbecue restaurant also had good pricing and beef and pork ribs,  and BBQ chicken on the menu.  The cafe is larger and has a large menu of item including the recommended blackened salmon, the house special NY steak and the double portion prime rib if you have a huge appetite.   We ordered both calamari and onion ring appetizers.  Both were good and our appetizers arrived almost as quickly as we ordered them. Our waitress was amazing and if your lucky you'll have Mona serve you too.  So funny and friendly and didn't miss a beat.    This place is what you'd imagine an old Las Vegas diner would be like with a small casino attached and easily within walking distance Bally's and  Ceasars casinos.",

    "text": "Well, we went here mid-afternoon last Wednesday- what a disappointment! The waiter was slow, apathetic, and unattentive. There were only 2 other tables that had customers, but it took forever to get our food. I was looking forward to the \"Signature fish and chips\" (really, the only reason we went here)- got it and it was soggy on the bottom- the batter just fell off, it was so 'wet'. My wife ordered the salmon- it was way overcooked and only barely warm, as was her baked potato (neither one of us has ever had a baked potato this bad). Her green beans were stone cold, as were the onion rings that I had ordered with my fish instead of the 'chips'. So, when I was able to finally flag down the waiter we asked for replacements, which we promptly got. One of the onion rings still had the onion skin on it, and the rest was just blah, nothing special, or overcooked- again. When we finally flagged the waiter, we asked for the manager- she came over and just made excuses, no apologies at all. She did say she would adjust our ticket, which she did begrudgingly. My wife & I had gone out for a nice meal together, and it ended up a total disappointment- poor service, low quality food, at best, and we ended up smelling like cigarettes.",

My server took great care of me, constantly making sure I was enjoying breakfast and keeping my iced tea refilled.

Either that or I've been watching too much Casino lately. When we arrived we parked at this small parking lot between the casino and the hotel next door.  As we walked in we were surprised to see an old school casino with low ceilings and lots of locals. When we got to the podium we noticed the deal of the day which was steak and eggs with potatoes for less than $10. My son also ordered a skillet with a ton of meat and potatoes and my wife had the biscuits and gravy. All our food was presented in an old school traditional manner and no fancy cutting or leaves and greens on top of stuff. You are able to get a beer with your meal or just a good coffee. Our waitress was very friendly and called me Hun which I actually like when I am at a place like this because I expect no less. \"Old school and down to earth with awesome prices and good flavor,\" is all I need to say. FYI- I recommended this place to a family we were hanging out with. They ended up going the next day and they made a point of telling us how great their meal was and how glad they were about the price.",

I'm still a fan of the steak special - $7.99 after coupons and a little bit of play, but they devalued it by taking off the beer. Steak is better than you'd expect for $8 and it comes with good green beans, a baked potato, and salad (and they still make their awesome dressing in-house -- try the Italian).   The waitstaff is always on top of things and has never made us feel like a burden for using our coupons.   The beef I have is with the host staff and management. Understaffing during busy times often makes wait times 45+ minutes, we've had issues with rude hosts; recently, after questioning why our party of 5 couldn't sit in the corner booth, the hostess called security over with the manager and accused us of cussing her out.   I'll keep coming here until my hunger for steak no longer outweighs the service I get at the host station.",

The old school dining room is quintessential of what Las Vegas used to be 30 or 40 years ago and I'm sure nothing's changed through the years.  We've been coming here forever -- in fact, each time we've ever visited Vegas. Check my reviews for the Ellis Island Brewery of previous visits.  The thing to have is Steak & Eggs and after 11pm I think it is a mere $5.99. The steak dinner is $11.99 or $8.99 with a coupon and includes a piece of filet mignon, green beans and a baked potato. A soup or salad accompanies.  French toast is only $3.99.  This is the place to come if you've lost all your winnings and only have a few bucks in your pocket and wanted some decent food.  I highly suggest ordering one of their home brews. I love the stout and at around $2.50 it is one of the best deals around. And it's delicious too.  A favorite with me and now, my friends.",

Due to that, I dragged my girlfriends the following night to try out Ellis Island.  Steak & Eggs $12.99, served with Potatoes & Toast - I order my steak to be medium & to my dismay, it was bloody!  It was tender but the idea of eating more of it made my skin curl so I just ate the sides which were less bloody...",

    "text": "A local favorite. The food here is decent but the selling point is how cheap the prices are. There is always a wait when you come here but the line moves a lot faster than the estimate time given by the hostess. My favorite dish here is the prime rib. For about $16 you get a huge prime rib, potato, green beans and soup/salad. I love that this place brews their own beer. My last visit here was wasn't a good experience. After being seated, it took about 20 minutes for a waiter to acknowledge my party and take our order. People that sat after us (like literally sat down for 2-3 minutes) were getting service before us. It was very frustrating. I even had to flag down multiple people and was told they were not my server. Once our order was taken the rest of the dinner went more smoothly. This place is always busy for dinner and late night but I think I'll be staying away from this place for a while.",

Not your typical diner though, they do it right! Perfect for the Vegas morning recovery meal.   I normally opt for the corned beef hash. They make it crispy which just takes the hash to the next level.   Another favorite is the chicken fried steak. Juicy and crispy all at the same time. Wonderful!  This time I tried something new. The chicken fried chicken. Basically just like the chicken fried steak but with chicken. Wow! Same juicy result, different meat. Loved it. Of course anything greasy probably tastes good after a night of drinking, games, and whatever, but this place is now permanently etched in as the default for breakfast. Do it!",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I were exhausted on our last day in Vegas and I was getting HANGRY. Everywhere that sounded good was too far and my poor feet were too tired. As we sat at Paris trying to decide where to eat, my boyfriend found this place on Yelp and said that prime rib sounded good. I had actually bookmarked this place previously for their steak and eggs - so off we went!   This place is off the strip, but literally just the street behind Paris/Bally. Not too far at all. As we were walking other pedestrians were headed that way as well. The area definitely looked a little sketchy, so I probably wouldn't walk there too late at night. It was around 5pm so still plenty of sun.   The place is pretty small for a \"casino\" - the parking lot is in the front - but we were there just to eat anyway. The restaurant is straight back and to the left when you enter.   The restaurant was busy! I took this as a good sign. Seems like a lot of locals, but also people who discovered this place from Yelp. We decided to share the prime rib special which came with a salad, prime rib, mashed potatoes, green beans, and a pint of beer. We don't drink so we asked our waiter if we could substitute it for something else - she said root beer - which we don't like either. She said \"that's the special - take it or leave it\" so we just opted out. Would've been nice if we could just have Sprite or Coke, but oh well. Still a fair deal. The menu said to \"ask your server about the double cut\" so we ended up getting that. And BOY did we f--- up hahahah.   So as we're waiting for our food, the table next to us gets theirs. The gentleman gets a HUGE slice of prime rib, and we're thinking - \"that must be the double cut.\" Then the waiter comes over and says, \"see, that's the regular size.\" OHH. if we had known the regular was THAT big, we wouldn't of got the double cut. Hahah oh well - when in Vegas...  The salad was a standard green salad and we got ranch. Lettuce was clean and cold, croutons were crunchy - what else can you ask for.   When the prime rib came it WAS huge and every one stared at us lmao. After we took the necessary yelp/Instagram pictures, we dove in! The meat was juicy and flavorful - I expect if we got the regular size it would've been more tender, but it was still good! Mashed potatoes and gravy were tasty and green beans were good. They were fresh green beans too, not the weird grey canned kind.   Overall, very funny experience and tasty. I would return because everything is priced very reasonably and it's only a short distance from the strip! If you're looking for a local spot, try this!",

Parking is easy for this small locals casino: a small lot connected to a Motel 8. I drove my 4 drunk friends the 0.6miles from Caesars Palace at 4:30AM and we ordered and ate like college kids, all on a college kid budget. Total for the evening including tax =$56.66. The family-style order:   1. Biscuit Special ($3.99): scrambled eggs, 2 biscuits smothered in gravy, 2 bacon (or sausage) - gravy was ok, had tiny bits of meat in it, everything was standard  2. Turkey Sandwich ($5.99): turkey, tomato, lettuce, mayo on bread. Comes with thick-cut fries. We shoved the bacon from the breakfast special into this and were so proud of our delicious, resourceful creation.   3. 8oz NY Steak Special ($6.99): comes with toast, home fries, and 2 eggs how you like. We got one with over-easy and one with over-medium eggs and both were made correctly. Love smearing my toast with runny yolk.   4. Hot wings ($7.99): dozen <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbomb.com&s=bb4f996415a9c2f21137e27cfb68f439a48cec2652b53e9b50dd7e766dbe177e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bomb.com</a> wings. This was way better than we expected. It's really hard to find hot wings that make me happy- the struggle is real. These were good and although they tied for most expensive thing of the night, I'd come back and order them again and again. (RIP Hooters casino $.25 wings)  5. Chicken Fried Steak ($7.99): tied for price and deliciousness with hot wings. Fyi This is PORK. Comes with toast and 2 eggs how you like. Crispy fried pork cutlet with a ladling of gravy on top.

There's a karaoke bar in a room next to the cafe- people were having a good time. Customers/people you meet there were also very friendly. They used texting to call you if you're waiting for a seat- pretty cool, using today's technology- I could get used to this!

Of course, we were looking for a meal that wouldn't break the bank, and upon looking at the menu, this place seemed to fit the bill.   The food wasn't the issue with this place. The service was. For being not very busy, it took over twenty minutes to get the check after our server was either taking at least four other tables orders and disappearing...And then at least another twenty minutes to get the heck out.   Being stuck at the table on a $24 tab in a sparsely occupied business for ~40 minutes- not worth it.   I'm not one to leave a bad review unless the experience was downright awful or the staff is rude, but being that we're on vacation and there was really no reason for the extensive amount of time everything took.",

Often times we'll go in w/ a group of 8-10 and every single one of us will order the same exact thing: steak and eggs. We found out about this place after a drunken night at some club. We were looking for some cheap steak and eggs, they got good reviews, so we gave it a shot. Back then it cost $6 or $7 if you stumbled in early enough. That deal may still exist, but I'm not sure. As of late, I haven't gone early enough and I haven't seen any signs advertising it.  It's a pretty basic steak and eggs meal. Decent steak, nothing special, however they are pretty good about cooking it how you want it. I can't stand when I order a steak and it's not cooked to how I ordered it. You also get a side of homestyle potatoes, which are pretty good, and your choice of toast (white, wheat, sourdough were the options IIRC).   One of my friends ordered the country fried steak the last time we went. That thing was absolutely massive, unfortunately, it was super salty. She was trying to get us all to help her out, but I couldn't stomach more than one bite.  Decent joint. Try it out!",

    "text": "Yelping is about sharing cool places. I am writing this review to share a cool restaurant in the shadow of the Las Vegas Strip that charges old school prices for good food. It is the Ellis Island Cafe in the Ellis Island Casino.      Sometimes I wonder if they call Las Vegas Boulevard the Strip because the inflated prices of the restaurants strip your wallet. Maybe I am exaggerating but the prices are high. Take the Nathan's in the Bally's food court. A fast food hot dog, medium drink, and fries is around $17. A block east of the Bally's food court Nathan's is the Ellis Island Cafe where you can have a chicken parmesain with pasta and marinara sauce dinner including cup of soup or salad plus beverage for less than $15. This was the kind of deal I appreciate when I am on the Las Vegas Strip.      Ellis Island Cafe is one of those restaurants where locals and tourists mingle. It really is a short walk along the south sidewalk of Flamingo Road from the Bally's food court doors into the Ellis Island doors. The upshot is there are a sundry of tourists sharing the full service cafe with the locals. Being a local, the restaurant is familiar. Ellis Island Cafe is the flagship of the Village Pub chain that is a popular restaurant /casino lounge chain across the valley. Although I was dining in the shadow of the Las Vegas Strip, I was truly in a Village Pub.      There were two omens that Ellis Island Cafe is a great deal. The first omen is \"People love us on Yelp\" and the second omen is the hour wait. Upon placing my name, the friendly woman at the podium informed me that there was an hour wait when she presented me with a beeper. I was free to roam the smoky casino or enjoy an Ellis Island draft beer at the bar. After tiring of walking the second hand smoke clogged casino, I took to waiting on one of the comfortable plush benches in the dimly lit restaurant.      If I wasn't decided on the chicken parmesain, there was so many choices to choose from. If it were any day instead of Saturday, there was a weekday special. And this was one major difference from the Village Pub. I recall the Village Pub offering a prime rib special on Saturday. Then again I could of opted for a steak special or several deals on the sprawling menu that I am sure included prime rib. Then again I could of ordered the delicious fish and chips, shrimp, or meatloaf that I have enjoyed at previous Village Pub visits.     Subsequential to the buzzer illuminating, I sat at a table in the dimly illuminated dining area. The waiter took my order. The waiter was a nice guy who volunteerily charged me for a coffee in lieu of a Coke to lower my check; however I would have liked to seen more of him. After placing the chicken parmesain on the table, if I'd seen him again I would have kindly asked for grated cheese because it does make pasta taste better. And I'd ask for a soda refill. From all my Village Pub there is usually a flaw with service. It reminds me of a Diner serving decent food at a reasonable price with a quirk in service.      For $9.99 off the Las Vegas Strip the food was a jackpot. We are talking chicken parmesain with pasta and soup for $9.99 that is a 777 a roll of the dice from the crossroads of Las Vegas Boulevard and Flamingo Road. This time I had a cup of  cream of broccoli soup. Tasty and good! Last time I had salad with ranch dressing. Good! Both times the chicken parmesain topped with that melting cheese and delectable sauce complimented by pasta was satisfying and filling.      Just a roll of the dice away from Bally's value lives on at the Ellis Island Cafe. Thank you for taking the time to read this review. It's been a pleasure to share with you on Yelp the outstanding deals that Ellis Island Cafe offers in the shadow of the Las Vegas Strip.",

Potatoes were provided on the side, and the portions were very generous.  The most popular entree is steak and eggs for $6.99. Friend ordered his steak medium rare and eggs sunny side up, which also came with 4 pieces of bread. They were all apparently delicious.  Other friends ordered the chicken fried steak and veggie sandwich -- they enjoyed those too!  Overall, great value and delicious meal!",

    "text": "Came here only because The Orleans Courtyard Cafe no longer exists and  The Prime Rib Loft upstairs was closed and charges you twice as much for the same product. Really said the Courtyard no longer exists and even though they replaced it with another restaurant, no more prime rib (sniff).  This place is located on the backside of Las Vegas Blvd. Suffice it to say that they ran out of prime rib at 11:30 pm. How can a 24/7 place run out of prime rib in Vegas on a Saturday? Ugh, that wasn't even the worst part. The waitress took 10 minutes to find out if there was any prime rib left. Food took forever to arrive. The side salad I wanted was to have the dressing on the side, which was not done. My salad was drowning in dressing. Ugh. The baked potato with the steak felt and looked like it had been sitting under a heat lamp for the last hour because it was hard on top. The NY steak was tough. The fried chicken was dry and because it wasn't drained properly after frying, all the grease was soaked up by the steak fries sitting underneath. That's disgusting to the say the least. The salmon was dry and also had the hallmark of being overcooked with a hard crust on top.   Needless to say, we won't be coming back here even if prime were available. I'm afraid to sample what it would be like if any of the other dishes were an example of the chef's talents. For $15.99 when other more well known places are offering cheaper prices and better quality, you'd expect better. I don't know where the 5 star ratings come from, but this place is not 5 star worthy",

I was greeted by my older Eastern block waitress who took my beverage order.  I went with the steak and egg breakfast which was priced at a locals rate. The steak was cooked perfectly and was generously sized, tender and included potatoes, toast and two eggs.  For the price of a breakfast sammie and latte at Starbucks I received a full sit down breakfast with a hot tea. What a score! Heck yeah I'll be returning. BTW complimentary wifi is offered here too",

    "text": "We arrived at around 12:15am and there was no wait. Note that the sign for this place reads \"Village Pub.\"   Service was a little slow from our server. Restaurant was about 60% full. She greeted us, got our drink order and it took about 8 mins to get our two waters. We ordered around 12:30am two steak specials and a cup of chicken noodle soup cause I figured the soup would come out fast and I was starving when we got here. Soup took a while to come out too but I was just happy to get a little something in me.  When they say \"cup of soup\" it's like half a cup lol the thing was super small. It was on the watery side, barely had any noodles and chicken. It was served hot though, which I appreciated.  Onto the steaks! We finally got it at 1am! 30 mins to get Steggs, which has been the longest I've ever had to wait for it, ever.  I agree with other yelpers that the stegg late night special here, even though it's like $2 more than other places, is probably one of the best I've had in Vegas. (The cafe at Arizona Charlie's on boulder highway is a close second for me. It was a plus that you didn't need a players card to have the special here at ellis)   The quality of the steaks are actually good and cooked almost perfect. I ordered medium and my bf wanted medium rare. I got medium well and he got medium.   The steaks weren't grainy or tough and when you cut into it the delicious juices actually were retained in the steaks and you can notice it in the pic posted. They were also seasoned well.  The potatoes o'brien were luke warm and not hot, sadness.. and my poached eggs were cooked half soft boiled and half hard boiled. The toasts didn't have much butter on them.. sadness again..  The karaoke did get annoying but was somewhat entertaining at the same time lol  Overall, we came for steaks and we got steaks that actually satisfied. I'd  rather pay a little more to enjoy my food rather than rely solely on the price and not enjoy it while eating.  We did see the table next to us order the king cut prime rib and I must say, it looks darn good. That thing was HUGE! Definitely plenty for two to share as it was 2 inches thick! At a good price to boot, $16.  We'll be back to try that prime rib out the next time for sure as well as the raved French onion soup (:",

    "text": "It's a little personal favorite of mine to eat at a little casino's cafe. Just feels like more of an authentic Vegas feel. Less glitz, less glam, just tons of horrible karaoke and slot noises.  Wait wasn't long on a Sunday night. Server took our orders very quickly. I ordered the NY Steak and Shrimp / mashed potatoes / with a cup of chicken noodle soup while my Fiancee ordered the Prime Rib / baked potato / with a side salad.   They were definitely not going slow tonight. A minute after we got our appetizers, our entrees appeared. Never thought I would get all my food TOO soon but that was the case. The appetizers were fine. The chicken noodle soup had some good chunks of chicken in it. Side salad was simple, can't complain.  Main dishes. Both steaks were cooked medium rare like we asked for. That was impressive as many places get that wrong. The NY steak was decent, just needed a little salt and pepper. The mashed potatoes were very bland. Not much went into spicing it up at all. The shrimp were not very good. It was mostly breading and the breading was greasy. I envisioned something a little fresher. Homemade cocktail sauce was just as bad. No flavor and I highly doubt there was any horseradish in there.  The prime rib is the way to go to order. This prime rib won't be the best prime rib ever, but you feel like you got your money's worth. You are going to have to work for your meat a bit as this cut had a lot of gristle. Again, this needed just a little salt and pepper to get the flavor going. Once you hit the meat, you'll be having a good time. The baked potato was just that, a baked potato. Nothing fancy. Green beans were a nice touch and you had plenty to it.   A fool would go to this cafe and NOT order any beers. Ellis Island has it's own brewery and their draft beer is $2.50 a pop. $2.50! The amber ale was my favorite. It helped wash down bad shrimp.  This place isn't going to blow your mind, however, it is a great place to get some late night cheap eats and brews. Just stick to the prime rib.",

It's good enough to eat without steak sauce, and it was cooked perfectly last time I was here.  They make you use a PLAYER'S CARD to get the special now though, so make sure you print out your coupon for it while you're there!  Of course, it's free to sign up...my friend did it while we were waiting for our order to arrive to the table.  It's in the DIVE known as Ellis Island though, so make your way past all the smoke and poor karaoke vibrating through the walls, and eat your cheap a$$ steak and enjoy it!  Check it out!",

The potatoes were yummy, but it's hard for me to dislike potatoes.  I ordered the chicken fried steak and eggs. The chicken fried steak is made with pork, and they do have a chicken fried chicken option. The batter was crispy and flavorful, the meat was tender. The sausage gravy was amazing! AMAZING.

Nah, go two blocks off the strip down Flamingo, look to your right and see it. Ellis Island BBQ and Casino. Walk in, go to the bar and order a 50/50 burger. 8oz. of angus and bacon, ground together, your choice of bun and cheese with some great steak fries all for...you ready? $8.95! Add in a 23oz Ellis Island beer for $3 and you are good to go! Oh yeah, karaoke nightly and a $5 roulette table. Ellis Island, the best little dive in LV.",

The steak came and it was a 10 oz sirloin cooked perfectly to our expectations accompanied by a baked potato and fresh garlic green beans. We are both big eaters but if we liked our steak cooked the same you could definitely share this meal",

    "text": "The food is excellent and the prices are great! Issue I had was the service I received.  My girlfriend and two of our friends went here on a Sunday night. Now it wasn't horribly busy but it wasn't empty either. We get to our table and our waiter gets us our drinks. We all order appetizers, soups/salads and our meals. So far so good. A few minutes later, we all could use a refill of our drinks. Our waiter has disappeared and it looks like the other waiters are busy. We are brought soups/salads but no appetizer. Given the portion size, I actually didn't mind not receiving the appetizer. Asked our waiter for a refill of our drinks and he just nods his heads. We don't ever see a refill. Our meals then shortly came out and once again we asked for a refill of our drinks. Waiter nods his head, and still no refills and no sign of our waiter thereafter. This is getting ridiculous.   The food was amazing! Definitely made up for the lack of service we were receiving. We finish our meals and this is where Ellis Islas cafe goes downhill. So we get our check and notice we were charged for the appetizers we never received. So we grab another waiter to get our waiter. Our waiter reluctantly comes out and we tell him that there was a mistake with our check. He looks at it and says sorry he will correct it. We also insist we  speak with a manager/supervisor. He agrees to get him for us and then says \"oh would you guys like refills?\" ....we have only asked for refills a few times already and never received them.  We wait 15 minutes, manager doesn't show so we ask again. Another 15 minutes pass and he finally shows up but doesn't come to our table. He talks with our waiter, looks at us, and then rolls his eyes and whispers something to the waiter and walks away. So now we get our new tab and it shows $5 off with the appetizers we never received still on the tab. So once again we ask our waiter to please have the manager talk to us so we can get this straightened out. We never got to talk with the manager but finally after another 20 minutes, the problem got fixed.  I really did enjoy the food especially for the prices. However, the service was a little less than desired and almost makes me hesitant to come back.",

I've heard about this place for awhile so I decided to give it a shot. Ordered the steak and eggs special for $5.99. It's basically 8oz steak, two eggs, potatoes, and toast. It was pretty good for the price and where else in this world can you find this much food for that price? It hit the spot and I was feeling good. Don't expect the service to be grand, they handle service like you are in a farm house. Get in and get out! It's busy, so they have to just go from one table to another. BAM! Like a boss. So if you are needy after midnight, just save yourself the trouble and go get drive through food.",

The casino is janky like something out of a 70's movie. At 1am, there was a 20 minute wait or so until we got seated. As we were starving, we ordered right away. The waiter was very nice despite it being so late and dealing with hungry and drunk customers. So we all ordered the steak and eggs ($6.99) --medium rare, sunny side up and sourdough bread. The steak was a bit overdone on the outside and the tendons were chewy, but still tasty with the A1 sauce. The egg was perfectly runny when I put it on top of the bread. They also provided strawberry and grape jelly. I left happy and satisfied. This place is definitely worth your money and lived up to its expectations.",

It's so worth the price of $6.99; make sure to ask the waiter for the special. The home fries/potatoes are amazingly wonderful. In fact the whole menu is worth a look when you're not inebriated or on your way out of town. It's a very LOCALS location and it is right next to a cheapo hotel. But I love a bargain and I love good food and this is the place to go! It's open 24-hours and you have the benefit of being able to play some slots that are cheap and fun either before or after you eat.  I can guarantee that you will not be disappointed and a trip to Vegas in my mind is incomplete without my steak and eggs at least once.",

    "text": "This by no means is a hidden gem.  Their signature steak dinner isn't really a \"steak special\". The proclaimed non menu item \"steak special\" is always advertised, albeit not in the menu. Ellis Island jacked up the price for this dinner by over 100% over the last 5 years. Has inflation jumped that  high? Of course not.   The service is always mediocre  here. First timers will be shocked how bad it can get. Regulars know this is the norm. However, an often surprise for both is reading how EI has got into doodoo with the Nevada Health Department many times.   We always have this steak dinner when in Vegas.We don't like Prime Rib. The steak dinner is cheaper and better than McDonalds, that's why we come here and endure the long waits, but that's really the only reason.  The attached motel is frightening to even look at, their guests who stay at the Super 8 are even more frightening. As seen at the Super 8 parking lot, many Canadians from Alberta Canada stay at the Super 8 here. Those Albertans love to drive long distances, don't they?  EI used to have bogo deals for their regular menu items. I tried once their chicken chicken parmigiana and it was simply ordinary so we stopped ordering anything but the steak dinner. The steak is supposed to be 10 oz, I find that hard to believe. I never brought a scale to measure but the steak is quite tiny; however, overall satisfying. It leaves you with enough room in your stomach to go elsewhere and buy some desert or a hot dog an hour later.   Incidentally, to get the steak dinner now at the advertised price, you have to spend at least $1 per person in the casino or slots to get a voucher for the steak dinner. When ordering a beverage, avoid the root beer. While it's home made, it has no fizz to it at all. Have a beer instead. Their ice tea is simply awful.  If you're not into steak, then by all means suck up an hour or so wait for the bbq ribs grilled on a charcoal grill outside after 5 PM. It's quite large, comes with beans and other good stuff.  EI Cafe closes every second Monday. They never take reservations and customer service is not in their in-house service standard list.",
