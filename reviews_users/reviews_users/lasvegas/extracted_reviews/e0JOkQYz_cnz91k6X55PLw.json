    "text": "We were in Sinatra's for a birthday dinner.   Food is OK, nothing special or exquisite.   The minus one star goes for the slow and unprofessional service.  ATMOSPHERE: The atmosphere is nice, has pictures of Sinatra all over the walls. There is a small garden with pomegranate trees, which were light up at night and it was magical. The tables are big so you can fit in big parties.   FOOD: For starters we ordered the Caprese salad, which was very small (i.e. three slices of tomato and mozzarella) and the Panzanella con Ganchio. For dinner we ordered Branzino and Tagliata. Note that when you ask for your meat to be prepared medium well, they bring it as if you asked for a well done. The meat is a bit dry and loses its taste.  DESERT: The deserts are good; they put \"Happy Birthday\" on the plate, which was touching and cute.  DRINKS: We ordered red wine (nothing special), after that I ordered the Sinatra Smash.  SERVICE: The waiter was taking forever to bring us the food, the restaurant was not even full! A big NO NO for me was when the waiter took the fork from my starters' plate and left it for the main course without even changing it.",

The restaurant was nice and quiet with the smooth tones of Frank playing in the background. It's small compared to most Vegas restaurants, which is also nice. Also, the dining room is set back from the casino floor so you're not bothered by the loud noises of the enchanting Double Diamond Deluxe machines.   Once again Encore makes a great statement with the decor and lighting. The orange tablecloths paired with the olive green, white, beige, and black throughout the restaurant make for a very interesting and surprisingly soothing environment.  The service was excellent, my water glass never ran dry and the server made excellent suggestions for wine pairings with our meals. I had the chicken breast wrapped in prosciutto, which was amazing. She had the agnolotti ravioli. I had a bite and that one bite is still in my head as one of the most amazing things I have ever tasted in my life.   For dessert we shared the chocolate cake, which I thought was a little small for the price, but very good nonetheless.",

    "text": "A life-changing event. One of the top 5 meals of my entire life. Absolute perfection in haute cuisine: food, ambiance, service all five-star. ===  I am honored to review the heavenly nirvana that is Sinatra at Encore. That a restaurant could be so well composed only two weeks after opening is otherworldly. Clearly the gods have shone on this mansion of Olympus.  Reservations are required. Dress is extremely up; don't embarrass yourself by even walking into this hotel without a jacket or donned in high European couture: the splendour of the decor absolutely demands your highest respect. Gloriously beautiful butterfly mosaics guide your way highlighted by the RED red chandeliers above (did I mention that they are red?). You may pass by some disappointed fanny-packed, windbreakered walk-ups, turned away without a reservation as you take your seat atop a stool, one of just seven at the bar. Old blue eyes is serenading you as you are about to embark on the swankiest dinner of a thousand lifetimes.  I ordered my Dubonnet Manhattan and was proud to be the first pour from the newly unsealed bottle. History. Should have been real cherries, but I'm too overwhelmed to fuss. Hostess arrives to escort us... Hmm, not what I'd expect for the look in a swanky Maitre'd but again, I'm not fussing. I get to sit under this gigantic portrait of the man himself.  Every detail is supreme. The royal orchids table arrangement and linen-topped oil lamp shade masking the flickering flame within. The embroidered artwork of butterflies on silk napkins. The lushly textured orange tablecloth (how can I have a shirt made from that material?!?) and the orange piping framing the absolutely white seat cushions.  The wine list is eclectic and mostly complete. A wonderfully huge Amarone awaits our dessert and just champagne cocktails for now.  Lobster raviolis are absolute perfection. Mixed with buttery tomatoes, so fine. The ossobucco melts in your mouth, the marrow the finest I have ever had. I was so deeply moved that I wished hard that I might be able to pay homage to the chef; I was lucky enough to be able to present my thanks personally, but that's a story for the memoirs.  They even made my favorite dessert to accompany the vanilla gelato. Strawberries, mint and balsamic vinegar. Was there a hint of pepper?   I can't wait to go back.",

    "text": "I'm very disappointed. Let me tell you why...  I went to Sinatra early with my friend. We came 15 minutes early. The hostess was out. We talked to her, inquiring when the restaurant would open. It was very clear that we had intentions of dining there. She gave what appeared to be a very fake looking smile. In case, you are wondering, this is the smile where you purse your lips together and pinch your nose at the same time.  I thought it was my imagination-- at first.    My friend and I both had reservations at Sinatra. We were there on time and looking at the menu. We noticed at the bottom of the really expensively priced menu that there was a note saying that business casual attire was needed.  Well, since the hostess didn't say anything to us we thought that what we were wearing would be ok.  When the restaurant officially opened at 5:30pm, the hostess took down the red rope and let us in. There was a small crowd. There was some guy in a polo shirt with his wife, who happened to be in an evening gown. (I didn't know that qualifies as business casual? Unless his wife is a cocktail waitress...)     The hostess let that pair in first. When it got to our turn, she told us to please step aside and into the lounge area. This was basically seats next next to the bar, on what were ornamental aka not weight bearing chairs. We sat in these uncomfortable show-pieces. The hostess indicated that she just needed to 'check on something with the computer'. (OK.) The bar guy offered us expensive drinks. (No.)  Then, she proceeded to congregate 4 managers. Yes, four managers at the podium.  They whispered freverently for like 5-10 minutes. The male one nodded his head while staring at us.  Then, they sent over a different female manager over to talk to us.  I know the female manager was just trying to do her job, but seriously tact training is required. She came over to us and said that she was sorry but \"athletic apparel is not allowed in the restaurant.\"  But \"if you would like to stay, you can eat in the lounge area? We can serve you the regular food out here.\"  (UM. Yeah, right, $100 dollars to be fed pasta on a wobbly table made of glitter & paste. While being treated as second hand citizens-- when polo shirt boy got in?)  I'm sorry but you could have just told us about the attire policy, when we asked about eating there. Instead of congregating 4 managers, making a show of things, and then treating us so condesendingly.  She then offered 'suggestions for other places we could eat' at the Wynn.  This was like the final blow!   After that, my friend and I politely declined and left.  It soured our taste for spending money in such an uppity place.  After that, I vowed to come on Yelp and warn other foodies!  Seriously, there are much better places all around. Service is half the price you pay for.",

The food was actually the same: great but not the best I've ever had.   What changed was the service. On my last visit it was reasonably attentive, despite the fact that I was dining in a large group. When I returned, everything seemed fine until we placed our order. The waiter brought my wine, and then disappeared. We literally did not see, speak to or hear from him again for the rest of our visit.  That meant that when my glass needed refilling, busboys had to be flagged down. When our dishes came and no parmesan cheese was offered, busboys had to be flagged down again. No one came by to ask us how our dishes were and if we needed anything else. When we wanted dessert and the check? A manager came and apologized to us, gave us our check (no comps offered, if you're wondering), then went on her merry way.  Yep - even after we complained about being totally and completely ignored, the waiter never returned to apologize or explain.   Guess it's Spago for my next Vegas outing instead.",

The decor is beautiful, with comfy couches to eat on, giant mirrors on the walls, a green and black theme, with huge chandelier type lights that hang from the ceiling. Very cool place, very classy.  As for the food.. we started out with a bottle of Joseph Phelps Cabernet Sauvignon. It was one of the best red wines I've ever tasted.  For dinner I got the Pennette, which is Italian sausage ragu, bell peppers, tomato and fresh basil. It may have been the best italian dish I've ever put in my mouth, and I love me some Italian. I want to figure out how to make it now.  I can't remember what my boyfriend got other than it was a meat dish, and he tried marrow for the first time and loved it.  As for dressiness, you should probably wear nice shoes and no jeans. Jackets aren't required.  The experience was excellent, service was excellent, and at one point, some guy doing card tricks was walking around. Overall, very cool place with excellent food.",

    "text": "Sinatra \"popped my cherry\"!  My YELP cherry that is...  Sinatra in the new Encore hotel in Las Vegas is hands down worthy of my first review, after much thought about which establishment would be my introduction to this community.  I recently celebrated my birthday at this restaurant and I heard that Steve Wynn celebrated his birthday there a week prior with a host of celebrities and multi-millionaires including the \"Donald\" himself.  Anything good enough for the owner of the hotel is good enough for me.  Here is the review...enjoy  Type: Sinatra's is a modern take on classic Italian.  Atmosphere: The decor and ambiance can only be described as classic elegance.  The sounds of Sinatra filled the very large main dining room in a pleasant and subtle way and was by no means overbearing or too powerful.  I could easily enjoy conversation throughout dinner with my date.  Large chandeliers and a photo of Frank stood out in the main room.  I particularly enjoyed the high decorated ceilings and large windows that looked out into the patio dining and garden area.  The carpet was a little much, but with the amazing view of the garden and the delicious food in front of me my focus wasn't on my feet.  Staff: We were greeted at the restaurant like we were VIPs and immediately shown to our table by the gracious hostess.  As fine dining should be various staff members were on point to take our order, bring our order, and refill our drinks.  Jonathan, our sommelier, recommended an amazing Italian wine (which name excapes me at the moment) based on what we told him we were looking for and it paired nicely with the Ossabuco.  The food was delivered with precision and immpeccable timing as our silverware was switched per course.    Food: AMAZING! Pretty much that describes the overall satisfaction from my dining experience.  3 choices of fresh baked bread were served along with butter and I must recommend the Asiago bread.  First Course: Tonnata - blue fin tuna served \"carpaccio\" style with thin slices of tuna topped with finely selected seasonings.  The tonnata literally melted in your mouth and left your palette craving for more.  *we ordered originally the Capisante - Maine diver scallops, but was informed from the waiter that the scallops were turned down by the kitchen due to receiving a poor quality batch.  I really appreciated this as this shows the high standard and quality control that Sintra has.  Entree: Ossobuco \"My Way\" with risotto.  This also was pretty tasty and finely prepared.  The meat was cooked just right and the portion was generous.  San Pietro - John Dory fillet with gnochi.  Prepared nicely and the white fish was soft and left no hints of the \"fishy\" taste that is sometimes found with fish dishes.  The fresh fish was complemented nicely with the gnochi as well.  My favorite dish of the evening was the Ravioli.  The butternut squash ravioli was perfect and possibly the best pasta dish I have ever had!  The flavors of the squash mixed with the vanilla foam that was layered on top was pure heaven in my mouth.   Dessert: I was able to get quite a sampling of the desserts and I must say they were all pretty tasty.  The Bomboloni - warm little donuts filled with dark chocolate were amazing!  I was very impressed with this restaurant and will definitely go back.  Sinatra would be proud...",

    "text": "Latest visit to Las Vegas had us staying at the Wynn Resort.  After a day on the casino floor, we thought that we would end the day on a high note with dinner at Sinatra.  We called from the casino floor at 6:00 and was told that we could get right in if we did not wait until later.  Although this was a bit earlier than we would have liked, we hiked over to Encore for a fine meal.  As it turned out, it was OK, but no more satisfying than our gambling luck.  We were surprised to see that Steak Sinatra was no longer on the menu.  Our waiter checked to see if it could still be ordered  and was told that it was now called Filetto.  Since this was a different cut of meat and a peppercorn sauce would make it Steak Au Poivre, I knew my wife was going to end up with a meal that she did not expect.  I went with the lasagna because I was sure I knew what I would end up with.  Although the place was only half full, the order took some time.  That was fine with me.  It gave us time to enjoy the beautiful room, the wine and tasty antipasto.  Finally the entrees arrived.  A plain filet on a plain plate was place in front of my wife, the pepper sauce came in a small plain holder placed on the table.  My wife commented that for  $56 they could have at least placed some sort of garnish on the plate - or given her the 10 oz portion that was listed on the menu.  This looked more like 8 oz.     The food was OK, but certainly not one of the better meals that we have enjoyed in Las Vegas.   The steak was very tender, but lacked flavor.  The peppercorn sauce did not save it.  The Lasagna was unremarkable.  There are too many exceptional Italian restaurants in Las Vegas to settle for such an average entree.    Entrees, a side of veggies, a shared antipasto and a shared desert, a glass of wine and 2 martinis came out to $280 including the tip.  The cost was competitive with the other many high end Strip restaurants we have visited over the years, but the meal could not compete with most of them.",

Seeing Frank's coveted award memorabilia at the front was a great touch as we waited to be seated. The ambiance in general was immaculate (as it tends to be in Steve Wynn's newer hotels). Everything else was pretty forgettable.  We started out with the tuna tartare appetizer. I enjoyed it (the fish quality was great) but the portion was super tiny. My aunt and I opted to split the massive 20 oz. ribeye for our main course - it was pretty good, but I've had better. Overall, the food was solid. The real glaring flaw was the service. It was dismally slow, and we felt pretty neglected for most of the meal. It took quite a while for our meals to come out - I want to say about 35 minutes. That's fine, I get that making meals from scratch takes time, but no one checked up on us even once during that time, and we proceeded to get full off the bread basket (sigh).   Overall, if you poke around, there are much better fine dining options in the hotel, on The Strip, and beyond. I can't wholeheartedly recommend this one.",

    "text": "Another amazing dinner at Sinatra--with 6 in our party.  This is my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas for so many reasons.  The look and feel, the music, the people, the food--the memories.  After a couple of drinks amongst the group and appetizers of carpaccio and then a great house made truffle noodle dish that was OUTSTANDING, we enjoyed a great meal.  Plates included lamb chops, Oso Buco, Agnolotti--home made herb infused pasta, filet with asparagus, salmon, and the pork chop special.  During dinner, we reminisced about Sinatra and Sinatra Jr--and their friends and family.  You can just feel the presence, frankly.  The wait staff and entire team are marvelous as usual--as this is likely out 10th visit to the restaurant. When in Vegas, don't miss Sinatra, particularly if you are a fan of a great vibe and incredible food.",

Once you leave that area, as the caricature of non-Italians, FUH-GET- ABOUT-IT.  Living on the West Coast, truly skeptical of \"Italian\" restaurants, but we made reservations for Sinatra.   Didn't know what to expect.  Firstly, the entire staff was amazing. We had a person in our party with food allergies and they were practically on bended knee to ensure every need was cared for, not simply bubble wrapping them, but elevating the dining (read good eats) experience was more than equivalent to their regular fare.  Secondly, the food was amazingly good, given that it is the West Coast. Heck it was the best bread I have had on West of Brooklyn, NY. And that is saying a lot.  Lastly, the restaurant itself would make Frank proud, I hand it to Steve Wynn for not turning this into a spectacle to leverage a True star's name.",

This was my second visit here and it didn't compare to the first, except in price.   When you spend $300 dollars on dinner you'd expect to have the freedom to wear a hat (it's winter by the way, so being asked to take your hat off wasn't cool in my view, specially for such high prices... You should be allowed to wear antlers and a tail if you wanted to!) and that in the least you'd get clean silverware (Got a dirty knife and had to send it back).   The service was kind of slow as well, but they were pretty busy.   But the vegan chicken was soooo good I'm almost not bummed about the rest.   Come prepared to pay big bucks for a glass of wine too.   Hopefully, the bad was a one time thing. But then again, how often do you want to spend that kind of money on dinner anyway?   Hooray for the vegan menu!",

Service was wonderful from the start, which is awesome because we have had horrible luck with other restaurants in Vegas.    We both had appetizers, which were good, not great.   The caprese was very different with a variety of tomatoes, but the mozzarella was not as creamy as it could have been.   We then ordered the Osso Bucco and the lamp chops.   Both came out nice and hot and presented beautifully.   The lamp chops were spectacular.   The Osso Bucco was not the best I have ever had as it was a bit fatty.     We had a wonderful evening and enjoyed the Sinatra music and the atmosphere.  Prices are definitely high.  2 glasses of wine at the bar and then 3 with dinner, appetizers and entrees and our bill was almost $300.  It was a special occasion so we knew what we were getting into, so not a big deal.",

    "text": "This was a seriously solid meal in terms of service, atmosphere and food. Top notch and well worth the meandering through Encore to find it (we were coming from Palazzo, so it was a bit of a walk). I had made a reservation on Open Table and would seriously suggest doing so as the dining room definitely filled up. We were seated in the back room with only a few tables and had the amazing Suzanne as our waitress (she just doesn't work Sundays and Mondays so ask for her if you go any other day and she'll treat you right!). I would definitely go back here and request outdoor seating when the weather is right! We all enjoyed our food immensely - I'll focus on what I ordered and what I tried.  I started with a half order of the Agnolotti. It's not listed as a half order, but it's one of the options they can do that way (a little tip from Suzanne). The small pasta pockets were filled with butternut squash and in a lovely light olive oil sauce with great flavors infused. Each bit melted in my mouth with rich flavors, but didn't ever taste too heavy. My dining mates each ordered the Prosciutto (seriously enough to share - looked like 1 pound of Prosciutto!) and the Carpaccio di Bue (phenomenal!). The carpaccio beef was thinly sliced with a great salsa verde, arugula and Parmesan. It was melt in your mouth goodness. They bring a nice bread basket to the table and were accommodating with a special gluten free basket as we had one gluten free diner. The butter served with the bread was out of this world. For my main course, I followed Suzanne's recommendation and went for the veal Parmesan. I typically don't order a lot of veal as I think it can be done wrong and she said that it's her favorite thing on the menu after working there 8 years and she never orders veal anywhere else because this is so tender, you could cut it with a spoon. Truth, my friends - it was seriously tender. They thinly pounded it until it was the size of my plate or the size of my face and it was covered with Pomodoro sauce and melted mozzarella. I couldn't finish it all, but could barely stop eating because it was just THAT good. Needless to say, I did not save room for dessert. We had a nice bottle of wine with dinner that was kept chilled just to the side of the table.  Lovely decor with pictures of Sinatra throughout and his music is playing in the dining room. As a side note, take time to go to the restrooms, as they were a sight in and of themselves. Seriously a fantastic experience!. And, to prove how personable they were, on the way out, the hostess that I had interacted with only once at the start of the meal thanked me by name and said she hoped I would return. Oh, yes, I will!",

The restaurant plays Sinatra's music throughout the entire dining experience. It is a great place to bring a hot date and/or have a nice romantic dinner with your significant other.   We first started with wine, but since we had already had some drinks earlier, we settled on a half size bottle of the Duckhorn Merlot from Napa Valley. Oh, it was so delicious. Then, we received our amuse bouche along with a warm bread basket. The only thing that was funny about the bread basket was the two spreads that they gave us. The bread runner gave each of us a different spread, but we moved it to the center where we can both share the spreads. Finally, the Ossobuco came out, which was my main entree. It consisted of braised veal ossobuco, risotto milanese and gremolata. I thought the risotto milanese was somewhat heavy with all the cheese, but the ossobuco was on point as the veal was quite tender.   Overall, it was a wonderful experience. Most of the men at the restaurant were wearing suit jackets which added to the sophistication of Sinatra. Come dressed and ready to eat well.",

The was so amazing I had to close my eyes to enjoy it. The sauce was so good I asked for a spoon so I can scrap it on the sides of the plate and enjoy every morsel.

    "text": "Just like all things at the Wynn, this is a lovely venue and a great dining experience.  We were celebrating our anniversary and Sinatra's was a great choice for us.  The dining room is beautiful and if it had been a bit warmer, I would have loved to dine out on the patio.  It certainly looked romantic there with the twinkling lights and the fireplace. But, the main dining room is a lovely room and is lit perfectly and the decor is classy.  Our server Dina was warm, hospital, friendly and helpful. She made recommendations, but since I'd already looked over the menu online, I knew what I was having.  We started with a great Antipasto plate and a good Caesar Salad.  The Buffalo Mozzarella was fresh and delicious, as were the peppers and the meat selection.  The Caesar was good, but not awesome.  Though, I did enjoy the anchovy.  For a main course I had the Spaghetti and Clams and my wife had the Branzino.  The spaghetti was tasty and though the clams were tiny they were sweet and tender and there were lots of them.  It was the Branzino that was our favorite though.  It had a light delicate flavor and was prepared just right.  We had not planned on dessert, but since I casually mentioned there was some grit in the clams (a big no-no, but not really a big deal to me, since I liked the authenticity of them and to me the sand showed they were fresh.  As a kid we used to dig clams and a bit of grit was just part of the experience), they comped us the dessert and we had the chocolate Frank's Fedora.  It was very good, but we were full, so it was a bit much.  We are big fans of the Wynn/Encore and have eaten at the Country Club, Lakeside, SW, Botero before it became Jardin along with Allegro and Zooza Crackers and the Buffet. I think our favorite overall is Lakeside, but the new Jardin has sort of bewitched us as a upscale casual dining experience.   Overall, we'd be happy to return to Sinatra since we enjoyed the whole experience, service, food and atmosphere.",

I live in River North in Chicago, and we dine out often at world class establishments, so I am not basing this review on a unfair comparison..       My group all agreed that for the price paid the food was bland and uninspired basic Italian American fair..  I mean $38.00 for pasta with sauce and sausage...   come on man.. The meatball appetizer .. 4 small meatballs for 20+ dollars  .. wow.    $70.00 for wine that VIVINO rated a 3.2 out of 5..  shame...   Martini's are the smallest on the strip... Frank is crying...   I had the veal parm..  It was ok, but Perieo's blows this one on quality, taste, and price.   I understand you are paying for the circus, but the owners know that, and have let the quality slip, and still charging outrageous prices for what you receive..    Go if you want a quality bread basket, and listen to Frank    if not..  Spend your money else where..",

You feel the energy and vibe from the minute you walk in.  Great decor and music playing in the background.  We loved our table for two by the window.  The prosciutto and melon appetizer was great.  So much prosciutto I asked for a couple more slices of melon to finish it all.  I had the lobster risotto and my friend had the osso buco.  Both were outstanding although I thought the osso buco could have been a little larger and meatier for the price.  Dessert was an awesome tiramisu.  Our server, Lawrence, was amazing.  I can't imagine coming back to Las Vegas and not dining at Sinatra again.",

    "text": "Can't begging to tell u how overrated and disappointing this restaurant is. I ordered their signature dish, the 12 ounce veal chop parmigiana - it's huge and the meat Itself is good quality. Before you dig into it, it looks like it'll melt in your mouth. But, as several have commented it's bland and even worse, they have a most bitter tomato sauce. To boot, I ordered a side of spaghetti, cooked perfectly al Dente and then as you taste it, the same bitter almost inedible tomato sauce.  For just about $60 for a veal chop (which I'm thrilled to lay but it does come with expectations of quality and taste) it should've been 1000x better than this. I started with the Caesar salad which has a lemon zest kick and the crunchy lettuce was good and fresh too but again has a bitterness to it.  I never felt like I left a restaurant and needed something sweet to get the bitter horrible taste out of my mouth. What a bummer, I was excited for this restaurant and it's a major disappointment.  Frankly, maggianos little Italy has a sauce that blows this away, surely not the same quality meat, but at least it tastes good.",

When we got there, we were seated right away and were given a drink menu. Everything was great until they changed servers on us and didn't tell us. One of my friends did not like her friend, and told the waiter and what he said, and I quote, \"you didn't like it? But you sure did eat it!\" Very rude and impolite and not the quality of standard I hoped to get from such a fancy and expensive restaurant. We asked for the manager, she hardly did anything and didn't take our concern and irritation too seriously! Very disappointed after me and my party spent about $1k there. If you're looking for  rude and horrible services,i would go here. This happened last weekend! Do not go here if you dint want to waste your money. We got better services at McDonald the next day than here!",

    "text": "Wow. I've been waiting on this post, because I really don't like trashing a place in a public forum. Just seems like a trollish thing to do, and generally I'd only go one star for a personal offense directed at me or somebody in my party.  Thus, I'll go two stars - and the second star is only because it's in the Encore, an otherwise absolutely excellent experience from service to gaming to design to the thoughtful Wynn touch (and XS).   This is notable: absolutely the worst food I've had at a 'nice' restaurant. I'm sorry, Steve Wynn, I personally am because I almost feel like I'm slighting you by short-starring your friend Ol' Blue Eyes. Maybe I should have known naming it after a dead celeb would be a dead giveaway of its shitiness.   Let me stop for a second and say something positive: I really did enjoy the decor - a large portrait of Frank adorns two walls in a somehow not overbearing way; the use of color is prominent & sophisticated, and the patio + open-facing sidewall was very appealing, and lent an air of openness to the space. Fun setup, and competent staff, if not wholly memorable. And kudos for setting the bar tv on an endless reel of Frank movies. And of course the soundtrack (all Frank) is amazing. But the food. . .   I had the lamb ossobucco as recommended by the server - \"my personal favorite.\"  The lamb literally was so rich, crossing my lips with an almost gamey flavor. The accompanying risotto was layered in salt.  Not just that it \"was salty,\" I'm telling you I needed water for about two hours straight after he meal. Had their shrimp appetizer which tasted like a shrimp cocktail, only deconstructed - boring, but at least not bad. Had their meatballs  - which were fine, in that  they tasted like costco meatballs, which I actually like (dark secret) but when you're paying $25 for an appetizer of four meatballs, please prepare something special.   Lastly, tried the lasagna - inedible. Kid you not. Wasn't even good enough to choke down. How do you mess up Lasagna at a place named after this legend. Again - the decor was great, the service was fun but what a horrible FOOD experience. Wow.  Fun stuff though and it was expensed so like I say - a bad experience makes a good story. And because of Steve Wynn & the milieu at the Encore, I refuse to give it the one star it truly deserves.",

I'd highly recommend Sinatra for special occassions.

    "text": "[Out-of-Towner Review]  Overrated, the food, not the namesake!  Please don't get that twisted. My co-worker booked this reservation based on her daughters recommendation. Note to self - don't listen to her again!  Easiest way to put it, it wasn't bad Italian, but I've had exponentially better. I was disappointed by the lack of flavor in the dishes for such a high end restaurant, and prices that match said style.  We'd been looking at Yelp all day during the tradeshow, in excitement of our upcoming dinner here. I absolutely loved the memorabilia used as decor. I think I was born in the wrong decade ;)  We had to wait to be seated until all of us arrived, then we were whisked into the dining area -- where for high end, they stack people on top of people. It was very dim lit, so much the table behind us was using their iPhone flashlights s to look at the menu and they had to be in their 40s, not even that old!  We were all hungry, since we made an 8PM reservation. Luckily they set down two large portions of different breads, bread sticks, and some crispy cheese things for us all to share. Oh and duh, they offered butter to spread, as well as hummus too. We devoured both bowls of options!  For starters, we knew we wanted to share lasagna as an appetizer and also try something else to share with our large group. However, after ordering our server came back and told us they only had one left -- 3 had been ordered in our group. It ended up going to one of my co-workers and I was left to re-order (rude)!  Instead, she brought out a Pennette -- Italian sausage ragu, bell peppers, onions, tomato, fresh basil. to share. We also ordered 2 orders of the Polpettine -- housemade meatballs, polenta fries. The sausage in the Pennette had lots of flavor, the sauce and the other stuff was nothing to even write about, bland for the most part. Some raved about the meatballs, but again I didn't think they were that great and didn't have any robust flavor to them.  We did order a bottle of Chianti and the Somm came over and assisted in doing so. She was polite and served the table the first bottle. She also came back shortly after and brought us a second bottle. I'm not a huge Chianti fan, but after it aerated it tasted better. Again, I'm a simpleton when it comes to wine, not fancy or boughie at all.  Since I had to change my order, I went with the Veal Parmigiana* -- thinly pounded veal chop, melted mozzarella, pomodoro sauce. I also asked for a side of Spaghetti, which was easily accommodated, but they don't put it on the menu. It was good, but I'm still not sure how I feel about eating 'veal'. I'd prefer chicken, bu they don't offer that. They did have a special that night with truffles, but I thought I better not order a $115 appetizer or $195 entree on the company tab. My veal was HUGE and it tasted good, but nothing amazing. Again, the pomodoro sauce left something to be desired.  I know others enjoyed their food, but I don't think anyone was raving about their entrees.   Our server was great, as you'd expect from a higher end restaurant. She was attentive and also detail oriented. She felt bad about the lasagna and tried her best to make it work for our group.  We didn't order dessert because everyone was pretty stuffed at this point and nothing seemed to peek our interest.  Overall, it was a lackluster dinner for Vegas. The namesake draws you in, but the execution is lacking severely. If you've had good Italian food, then you'd know they are not on par here.  Go some where else in Vegas, ANY WHERE else!",

The restaurant is located in the very elegant Encore Resort, which is beautifully decorated and refined. We were able to get same day reservations at 630 pm even though it was very busy. Great selection of unique cocktails. Food menu is small but has a reasonable variety. Beautiful porcelain dinnerware, Bernardaud, and glassware. Food seems authentic Italian, well seasoned; this is not an upscale Olive Garden. The service is high end without being snooty. Menu is a little pricey but about what you'd expect in an upscale Las Vegas resort. We'll be back!",

    "text": "When? Tuesday, June 11, 2019 Who? Me, wife, my mom & dad (party of four) Reservation? Yes; 5:30 p.m. PST; made through OpenTable.  My parents are in their 80s. We've been going to Las Vegas as a family since 1965. I miss the old Las Vegas and when in Las Vegas I look forward to being in places that are \"old school\". My father, in particular, loves Sinatra restaurant although it's been a few years since he and my mom dined there. This was to be the first visit for me and my wife.  Things got off to a good start. When my wife and I arrived at the restaurant my parents were already at the bar. The bartender remembered my parents even though it had been several years. We were promptly seated at a table in the middle of the floor and freeted by our waiter.  Plusses - Service - Decor (if you like Frank Sinatra) - Music (if you like Frank Sinatra) - Food ... we were all satisfied with our appetizers and entrees  Deltas - Wine list is the most inaccessible I've ever encountered in Las Vegas. Partly this is my fault because I know nothing about Italian wines. But a large part of the inaccessiblity is the prices on the wine list. I've dined in a large number of high-end Las Vegas restaurants. I'm well aware of the richly-deserved reputation that Las Vegas Strip restaurants have for expensive wine lists. But Sinatra blows away every place I've been. The wine steward (not sure of his exact title) was of little help. When I shared with him that I was a bit surprised at the prices and asked him to find me something that is a great value he picked a wine that costs $298 a bottle. I declined the recommendation. - Ambiance ... this was a huge disappointment. This restaurant could be something extremely special. But it isn't because the restaurant management has turned its back on creating a special atmosphere and, instead, has decided to pack the place with large parties. I have never eaten in a louder restaurant. We were literally shouting at each other in order to be heard at our table.  I'm sure under a different circumstance this is a better place. But I didn't get to enjoy it because it was just too loud.",

She pretends to be super nice while never accommodating with any of your needs. Furthermore, she backtracks what her staff says and end up putting us in a corner claiming it's a VIP table. Basically we get escorted off the table we got seated on to be placed in between a drunk crowd while our table is taken over by 2 people that feel like chilling post their dinner.   To be fair, the food is scrumptious but service is key in any high end restaurant. It's a combination of things, if I were to give any macaron aka Etoi, I would never do so given the attitude of the management.    Kelly is the worst manager Steve WYNN ever hired. Too bad the man who knows everyone and everything about hospitality hires such a shady manager. A great dinner turning into a nightmare.

    "text": "After consuming so many serious dinners in Las Vegas this week (at Joel Robuchon, Momofuku, Jose Andres' Bazaar Meat, Mizumi, etc.), Sinatra was meant to be my \"fun meal,\" an excuse to shovel comfort food down my throat without thinking too much about it.  Mea culpa, I significantly underestimated this restaurant. Sinatra ended up being one of my favorite (top 3?) meals in Las Vegas this week.  My experience started on a nice note: a thick gazpacho was provided as an Amuse Bouche -- and, as one would expect in an Italian-American restaurant, Sinatra's gazpacho was more \"saucy\" than the classic Andalusian preparation -- heavier on tomato than on olive oil, though nonetheless tasty.  Next, a basket of four different different breads was placed on the table, accompanied by softened chive butter: Ciabatta Rolls, Olive Focaccia, Jack Daniels Date Bread, and crispy Parmesan Lavash. My favorite was the lavash, which tasted somewhat familiar -- think Cheez-Its, but with the parmesan cheese imparting just enough funk to make it acceptable for grown-ups. The date bread may have been a bit too sweet to serve before a meal, and the olive focaccia tasted like it was made with jarred cocktail olives rather than the freshly marinated olives I know Vegas is capable of.  The first course I ordered at Sinatra was the Polipo ($22), which featured octopus in a roasted red pepper emulsion. This was the best part of the meal for me -- of particular delight was the tenderness of the octopus which, according to my waiter, is due to the octopus being vigorously beaten after it is caught and before its muscles tighten up. (I have a running theory that no two chefs tenderize their octopus the same way, which is why I always get a different answer when I ask.) The red pepper sauce served with the octopus was umami-rich, and featured fried capers with a crispy texture, providing a nice contrast to the soft Mediterranean octopus.  My next course was Pennette Pasta ($18 - half-sized) with a ragu of Italian sausage, bell peppers, and basil. The sausage ragu sauce was good, somewhat sweet, though heavy with fennel and with enough of a trace of hot pepper to have a bite. Pasta was cooked al dente which may seem a bit under-cooked to most American sensibilities (e.g., opinions formed by consuming baked pasta dishes from the local sub shop) -- but is really the only sensible way to prepare pasta. I suspect for this reason we have Yelp reviews complaining about over-cooked or under-cooked pasta at Sinatra. I strongly suspect these assertions are utter nonsense -- the pasta on my plate was cooked perfectly.  So... yeah, don't believe all of the reviews on Yelp. Some people are complaining about \"bland\" food from Sinatra while ordering meatballs. One person expressed that she wishes she were served \"chicken parm\" rather than Veal Parmigiana. Another guy implies his \"chicken over mashed potatoes\" was nothing special. (OK, this one is on the restaurant -- serving that entree is like giving a gun to a chimp.)   My final course was the Veal Ossobuco ($53). Ossobuco and Saffron Risotto was a dish I made regularly for near-strangers when I was in the dating pool a decade ago, before I met my vegetarian wife. It's easy to prepare, looks more impressive than it is, and generates an unmistakable \"wow factor.\" Because of this, I am often nervous about ordering this dish out. I'm glad to report that Sinatra's version stands up favorably to the best ossobuco I ever made. The size of the dish was also quite substantial -- the shank they brought out for me was gigantic. I much enjoyed swirling the fork-tender meat around to pick up more veal broth reduction and lip-smacking collagen. The accompanying risotto had perfect texture and a generous amount of saffron (but not so much that the rice tasted like detergent, an error that lesser restaurants have made). The only complaint that I have is that the gremolata was nearly non-existent, and definitely not a factor in the dish. In such a heavy dish, gremolata helps as a brightening agent. On recommendation of my waiter, I paired the ossobuco with the silky 2011 Masi Costasera Amarone ($28), which was a delicious, medium-bodied wine that paired perfectly with the veal.  Speaking of my server, Sergio treated me like royalty. He was on top of the meal, made a myriad of recommendations, and provided valuable color commentary throughout. I can't say enough good things about the service I received. If you go to Sinatra and end up with a waiter half as good as Sergio, you'll still rave about the service.  For food reasons I may normally rate Sinatra a 4, but this was the quintessential Vegas dining experience. With its top-notch service and beautiful venue, Sinatra surpassed my expectations, and provided a truly delightful meal that anyone who enjoys food would love.  Food/Decor/Service: 4.2/4.6/4.6",

The veal parm which is supposed to be a specialty($59.00) is nothing better than what you would get at any local joint and so not worth it.  The john dory fish was good but not great.

The meat just falls off the bone and the marrow is pure goodness. My guy committed a mortal sin in my book here. He ordered his lamb well-done (horror or horrors). I begged him not to, but he insisted. Well, you know the place is good if they were able to prepare well-done lamb and still make it moist and juicy. I was quite impressed.  At the end of the meal, they mistakenly delivered us a birthday dessert with a candle in it and walked away too quickly for me to argue with them. Without thinking I blew out the candle, but then I guess the waiter realized his mistake and came back to retrieve the dessert. He apologized and walked away with it. I would think they would just leave it with us, since they certainly couldn't serve a cake that I'd already breathed on to someone else... Oh well, lol.  Definitely worth a trip.  I'll be back for the meatballs next time.",

    "text": "FIVE STAR RESTAURANT! I decided to spend my birthday at Sinatra this year and I must say this was one of the best birthday experiences I have ever had. As I arrived at my dining table, there was a cute little card waiting for me on the table. I opened it up and it was a HAND-WRITTEN birthday card. I thought it was very sweet that the restaurant went out of their way to hand-write a birthday card for me...quite a memorable characteristic indeed.   As for the food...I could not believe that this restaurant has an entire vegan menu. I am not vegan, but am lactose intolerant and they were able to modify all dishes to meet my dietary needs. And all of the food spectacular!   For my starter, I ordered the beef carpaccio served with salsa verde, wild arugula, shaved parmigiano, and croutons. Excellent combination.  For my main course, I had the agnolotti filled with butternut squash and served with sage, parmesan, and brown butter. They made this dish completely dairy-free for me. I have seen a similar dish at several other restaurants, however I can never order it due to its high dairy content. I must say I was impressed with these accommodations.   For dessert, I ordered  the bomba al cioccolato made with Valrhona chocolate cake, raspberries and passion fruit sorbet. DAIRY FREE. This is the best vegan dessert I have ever  tasted in my life. It did not taste vegan at all...actually tasted quite normal :) The combination of the cake the with sorbet went perfectly together.  The ambiance is elegant and lovely. There are photos of Frank Sinatra all around with charming Sinatra music playing in the background. They also gifted me and my entire party with Holiday Frank Sinitra CDs!! Can you believe that? We all left with Sinatra CDs! If thats not going over the top...then I don't know what is. The bathrooms are also beautiful. The bathrooms are technically the Encore hotel bathrooms, but regardless they have HAIRSPRAY and hand lotion in BOTH the men's and women's powder rooms. And the hand lotion smells amazing!  Finally, I must comment on the service as it was outstanding. We dined as a party of 6 and asked our server to provide each of us with individual itemized receipts (for reimbursement purposes). The server did not complain or have any problems with our request. In fact, he remembered each of our items and was happy to fulfill our request.  I highly recommend checking out Sinatra in Las Vegas. I had an absolutely phenomenal dining experience!",

The manager removed our meals from the bill. An evening was ruined. Do something better with your time and money. Fellow yelpers, do yourself a favor, don't eat here.",

You know those annoying segments that repeat over and over on the TV in the room about the hotel and the restaurants and such? Those things can be really convincing!   The biggest claim to fame of this restaurant was a meat cutter that is over a hundred years old. I am a huge huge huge fan of prosciutto so I had to try it. They serve it with this amazing baked pear which makes it 100x better - yummmmm. Imagine the saltiness of the meat with the sweetness of the pear.....YUMMMM!!!!!!  Anyways, I had literally 4 orders of the prosciutto and my boyfriend had the steak. He said it was really good as well but I was busy stuffing my face with cured meat so I don't really remember how happy he was about the meal.",

They play Sinatra music (of course) inside and on the patio. The restaurant is very old school and cozy; even the outside is cozy with fireplaces (although they were off when we dined there since it was a warm evening).   Our waiter was his team excellent; very nice and very attentive. He was also incredibly accommodating; I couldn't decide between the halibut because I loved the presentation with gnocchi and mushrooms, or the scallops because I prefer scallops to halibut , so he let me do the scallops with the halibut presentation!   I highly recommend dining outside; it is a beautifully landscaped, intimate setting.   Get the crab panzanella app and scallop entree!",

Not too soupy, not to cheesy, and certainly not to pasta-y (if that makes sense). Meatball appetizer is delicious, and the crab salad appetizer is out of this world.  So light and yummy!

None of the descriptions on the menu sounded good to me, but I tried to keep an open mind. Ordered the Quattro Formaggi starter (4 cheese plate) which was to come with (surprise) four cheeses and an assortment of seasonal accompaniments. That's what the menu said.... I was imagining fruit, bread, crackers, olives, maybe a little prosciutto or salame. Grape tomatoes... anything! Man, I wish I took a picture of this $30 cheese plate! My husband and I literally laughed out loud when it arrived at the table. It had four measly, bite-size jokes of cheese - two of which were inedible. I have no idea what they were because neither the menu nor our waiter provided any descriptions, but they didn't taste or look like cheese. And those seasonal accompaniments? Five almonds. Yep, five almonds. I was offended that the waiter didn't tell me how ridiculous this starter was when we ordered it. Beyond that, the complimentary bread was ice cold and stale. The food over-priced and ranging from unimpressive to downright awful. Im frustrated with myself for not sending everything back like a normal person probably would have. But hey, no one ever asked how we were doing or whether we were enjoying our meals anyway. We were never even asked if we wanted water refills. I'm not sure why my dining experience was so different from other reviewers on here, but I would never recommend this restaurant to anyone. EVER.

We've been told that the menu are all of Frank Sinatra's favorite foods.  We've dined here many many times.  Before we moved to Vegas, we would fly in to dine here on special occasions.    tart with one of their signature drinks...so original and refreshing.    Hubby will usually have the Veal Parmesan or the Pennette.  Both authentic and delicious.  The Veal is massive and super tender.  I'm a fish girl so it's usually the scallops or branzino.  Both incredible.  They have an extensive vegetarian menu too.  The couscous with ratatatouille is out of this world.  The service here is impeccable. We always enjoy listening to how they describe the specials.  These professionals could make anything sound incredible. Always attentive and friendly.    For dessert, the lemon cheesecake with raspberry sorbet is my favorite and is as beautiful as it is delicious.  Make sure to ask about the crostata of the day.  They are always fresh and perfect.  This is perfect for a business dinner, special occasion or if you just want to be treated to an outstanding dining experience!",

We were lucky to get a reservation around 9:30, but then really got lucky because we took the two bar seats in the corner facing the outside dining area and the fire place.  The dinner was amazing start to finish. Go.",

Hesitation from server and then said yes. ( did not look or taste fresh )  I had the lobster risotto- food poisoned ! Awful way to begin a Vegas trip.   You will see awesome Sinatra memorabilia so that was neat . But nothing too exciting here. Very over hyped .",

I enjoyed my birthday dinner here and loved every minute of it. The hostess gave me a birthday card right when we sat down which was a lovely touch. We were perusing the wine menu and the wine director came over and helped us select an excellent bottle of red that my date and I both enjoyed. I started with the Caeser Salad, which was probably my least favorite thing that we ordered but it was decent. The bread basket was great. For my main course I had the Lobster Risotto which had so much lobster in it and was truly delicious. I also had a side of Eggplant which was delicious as well. My boyfriend had a huge 16 oz NY Strip which I tried and was very good, particularly the wine sauce that came with it was wonderful. For dessert I had pistachio and vanilla gelato and they were very creamy and a great end to the meal. I had an Espresso Martini as well, which was pretty standard but good. Our server Roberto was nice and he really let us take our time and enjoy our experience which I loved. The meal was pricey but not too bad. Next time I come I want to try their light menu items, but this time I didn't care since it was my birthday. I can't wait to go back!",

The service was good, however, they repeatedly came back to tell us that what we ordered was not available.  The food was over priced and several of our dishes were void of taste. My colleague ordered the double pork chop special.  The meat was tender but had no flavor.  My other associate ordered the fish special (halibut).  Again, void of flavor.  My $54 dollar veal parmigiana was quite good but for the money it was not worth it.  The risotto side dish was quite tasty.  We ended up sharing my dish and some sides.

Suffice to say, Mr. WYNN will survive and I love his hotels.  The food was extremely baseless in True Italian taste. It's too bad. The ambiance is fantastic, with actual Sinatra memorabilia, up to par with the high cost, but the Veal Parmesan tasted like it was from late night diner, smothered in a bland tomato sauce. Our party of 7 received their meals all at different times, and way past an acceptable timeframe.  The risotto was drowned in butter and cream, a cheap and easy way to make anything taste better. I could go on, every aspect, with the exception of a wonderful Somelier, was extremely substandard. When the over $1K bill came, (that's only 2 bottles of wine) and our dis-satisfaction was communicated with the manager, he offered to remove the automatic 18% tip. We were a party of 7, not 8, so this was an additional mistake. I simply said, \"How about a Scotch at the bar, on ol blue eyes\" The manager obliged,  and proceeded to tell the bartender to poor neat, the cheapest whisky they had. One last chance for redemption, I honestly hate bad reviews, and bam! He did all he could to make this dinner a negative one. (I know it wasn't personal)",

I enjoyed this restaurant so much on a previous trip that this time, I brought my wife here to celebrate our anniversary. She enjoyed it immensely as well and can't wait to return.   With a nod to Old Blue Eyes, the sweet songs of Sinatra greet you as soon as you enter the welcoming hostess at the entrance. While there, linger a moment and appreciate Frank's awards and trophies - and some choice photos - adorning the wall.  The dining room is as exquisite as they come. The chairs so comfortable that if you lean back, you just might fall asleep. The soft music of Frank's many hits continues to play in the background as you settle into your seat and, by candlelight, examine a menu fit for kings and queens.   I opted for Frank's Spaghetti and Clams, which was one of Sinatra's favorites. I can see why. It was outstanding. I added some parmesean asparagus on the side and lemme tell you....if you don't like asparagus, you'll love this. It almost tasted like some kind of pizza!   We capped it off with an amazing dessert. I wish I could remember exactly what it was called but it really doesn't matter because they all looked good. It was so nice how they fancied the tasty dessert up with a warm \"Happy Anniversary\" message on the plate (see photo).   I should mention that everyone we encountered at the restaurant seemed to know we were celebrating and wished us a happy anniversary at every turn. There was even a nice card on the table when we arrived. How nice is that?  We love this place and can't wait to hurry back.",

Our drinks were never close to being empty and our plates were cleared and table de-crumbed immediately.   We ordered the following  Appetizer: Prosciutto (Parma prosciutto, caramelized Bartlett pears, Parmigiana Reggiano) Best prosciutto I've ever had.. The caramelized pears and cheese were also very delicious.   Dinner: Lasagna Bolognese- The bolognese was extremly flavorful and the meat was very tender. Best bolognese I've ever had.   Chicken Parmigiana- Best chicken parm ever! Huge portions and the chicken was melt in your mouth. The marinara sauce was SO good.

    "text": "We came to Sinatra to celebrate our 40th wedding anniversary.  From the very second we walked in the door of Sinatra, we were treated like royalty.  The two lovely ladies at the front check in welcomed us warmly and offered to hang my coat.  I opted to keep it as I get a little chilly, and it was tailor made for me and I rarely let it out of my sight. We were also welcomed with a card wishing us a happy anniversary. Beautifully handwritten and personalized.  I knew right then, this was going to be great.  We visited the bar first, as we were a few minutes early.  The bar tender was very busy, yet  very nice and the Pinot Gregio was probably the best I've ever tasted. So smooth and just a brilliant wine.  Hubby had a Bloody Mary and said it was nice.  When we were seated for dinner, our table had a lovely view of the garden patio and fireplace.  Had it been a bit warmer, we may have enjoyed appetizers or dessert out there, but it was in the 40s.  The dining room had such a genuinely warm feel, it was almost as if 'Old Blue Eyes' were in the room.  I believe he was, at least in spirit.  The service at Sinatra is WORLD CLASS. Actually, I will say it is absolutely the best service we've ever had anywhere, ever.  We have been all over the world, dined at Michelin restaurants across the globe. Without question, Sinatra is better than any restaurant we have experienced.  While I cannot remember our server's name, he was impeccable!  We never wanted for anything.  Our glasses were always filled, and he was so knowledgeable about each dish and was great in giving his ideas on each dish.   We started with a lovely Caesar salad that was just perfect. Not too much, not too little and perfectly plated.  To our great surprise, the chef sent out a most delightful butternut squash bisque with his compliments for our anniversary.  I LOVE butternut squash. and this bisque was just amazing.  Perfection!  Next, our main course arrived. Hubby had 'Filetto' 10 oz beef tenderloin and I had 'Agnolotti' small pasta pockets filled with butternut squash and parmesan. My dish was sheer perfection and brilliantly presented. It was so wonderful and perfectly portioned, cooked to perfection and the taste was too incredible to put into words.  Then, there was my hubby's filet. Oh, my!  There are truly no words to describe this one either. It was by far, the very best tenderloin either of us have ever tasted!  It practically melted in our mouths. SO delicious! There are no words. Cooked to perfection and beautifully plated. Again, just the perfect amount to enjoy.  I could not eat all of my dinner, but hubby would have licked the plate clean if we were at home.  It was just that awesome.  We also shared a side Purea di Patate, mashed potatoes, which were excellent.  We lingered a bit longer enjoying and savoring our memory of an awesome dinner when the staff came and presented us with a personalized dessert for our anniversary!  It featured the famous 'Frank's Hat' and a lovely layer chocolate mousse.  What can I say? That was exceptional!  Tremendously delicious and the perfect ending to a world-class amazing meal.  We waited a while and hoped the check would come, but it never did.  Our server asked if we cared for anything more, and hubby asked for our check.  He walked away and returned and said that this meal was compliments of our adult children!  OMG! I started crying. I could not believe it.  The staff knew all along and kept it secret.  It was the meal of a lifetime, one we will always remember.",

I know Vegas is more about the show than anything, but I would expect it would be a little different food wise. The food was really disappointing. I ordered the risotto and I have probably ordered Risotto in half of the Italian restaurants I have been to and I am never disappointed. This lobster risotto however, was probably the worst I have ever had. The risotto was completely al dente and I could feel every single grain under my teeth. It was a whole huge bowl of risotto with a tiny little bit of lobster heavily immersed in butter right in the middle. Food tasted so greasy and was so uncooked that I stopped eating after the first few bites. The only reason I did eat a little was that I was very hungry and had not had lunch in anticipation of the \"amazing dinner\" I was going to have. Service was really good, but for the price I paid, probably the worst risotto I have ever tried.",

I had the veal chop Parm highly recommend by our server and other reviews It was ordinary , not to mention salty with low quality cheese which i doubt  was house made.  Sadly and disappointed I would not recommend this restaurant.",

    "text": "A few hits and some misses.  Even Chef Schoenegger's one Michelin star from LA's Patina couldn't save Sinatra.    As a child of Gen Y, I don't fully appreciate the sounds of Old Blue Eyes.  There are photos of Sinatra on the way in and an autographed photo w/Wynn on the interior of each menu.  And Sinatra's tunes are played continuously through the meal.    Service was excellent.  Servers and busboys were doting on us hand and foot.  We even got a booth w/o requesting it.  BONUS.    My main problem was the food.  Some items were eh and others were just too salty for my palate.    I highly recommend: Tonnato, $23 Thin slices of veal and seared tuna with tuna foam, really light and the flavors all danced in my mouth.  Good: Lobster Ravioli, $26 Portioning was generous, about 7-8 FILLED raviolis-loved the sweet tomato halves and the al dente pasta.    Eh: Caesar, $19 Damn expensive for something that didn't have the correct measures of cheese, dressing and anchovies.   Beef Carpaccio, $24 BLAND and super boring.  BAD: John Dory, $55 Super salty and way too creamy.  Could barely taste the fish. Bomboloni, $12 This was not fresh and NOT tasty at all.  Had one, b/c I felt bad. Double Espresso $5.50 Had to get TWO, b/c they were so sissy in size.  Bonus: there was an extra charge for a bottle of wine, we didn't even notice, hey, we were having a good time, server noticed and brought out another receipt for the reconciled amount.    Probably won't be back in a while, I really enjoy Batali and Bartolotta on the Strip.",

We had our son who is 5 and they very accommodating and made a spaghetti plate for him, the food was just delicious my Agnolotti just melted in my mouth.    Our server was very attentive and even opened the door that leads to the ladies room for me.   The ambiance is just lovely. WE will be back very soon!!",

Food took a long time to come out (we ordered pasta specifically because we were in a bit of a rush to watch a show)- but I don't think that reflects on the server, who was otherwise pretty good. Apparently you can't get out of paying for water here, because I'm pretty sure I ordered \"still\" (I think the other choices were bottled and spring), and I still found a charge on the bill. Oh well, that's Vegas. Bread was OK (Rosemary focaccia very good, Italian and bread sticks run-of-the-mill. All cold. Whatever happened to restaurants serving warm bread?). Ordered the pappardelle and spaghetti with clams. No complaints  about the taste. Way overpriced though. Apparently the pappardelle was fresh made, but for  nearly 30-40$/ pasta entree, ALL the pasta should be made in house (not dry and from a box) and taste like it. This didn't , so that was disappointing. We passed on dessert, and yet with one drink, salad, and a teeny bowl of veggies (not good), the total bill with T/T was  still more than150$. A decent meal, but definitely not in my top 20 Italian eateries. Probably wouldn't go back, unless someone else was footing the bill.",

    "text": "Oh man, these guys are good.  Wife's vegan and she and I wanted a date night during our Vegas trip, so decided to sample how the other side (i.e. those who have money) lives for once.  We had heard that Sinatra was really good to vegans so we snagged a reservation and checked them out.    First thing we noticed was when I told the server my wife was vegan, upon bringing out the bread they separated the bread that had cheese on it from everything else and also gave her Earth Balance to use instead of regular butter.  That's pretty cool.  And their drink menu is gigantic.  Lots of awesome options for those who favor the harder stuff over beer/wine, those of course being me.  After we had pounded a couple cocktails we both got the chicken parmigiana (with hers being the \"chicken\", aka Gardein version).  Now, being that I don't eat at fancy restaurants like these all that often, I was curious what their entree portion size was like.  I have to admit I was a bit skeptical that we might end up in something out of American Psycho and get a $100 plate of elaborately-decorated thimble-sized food.  But such was not the case!  They bring my plate out and it's two huge cuts with the chicken absolutely dominated with cheese.    Same for the wife for her Gardein version with vegan cheese.  I KNEW YOU WOULDN'T LET ME DOWN, FRANK!   It was delicious as all hell and though we really wanted to try the vegan chocolate bar dessert, we were entirely too full.  It is still a pricey affair - two drinks, two entrees and a side ran us $140 after tip - but it's a lovely atmosphere, we got plenty of food and the staff was extremely friendly and treated my wife like vegan royalty.  Gotta say, I'm impressed.",

Alas, this classy joint is devoid of kitsch :-(   The Sinatra theme is limited to a few pieces of memorabilia in the front, and Sinatra music playing in the background. The decor and atmo are stolid swank -- nothing flashy, mobster-ish or fun... just a place where miserable old WASP couples would feel comfortable picking at their food and bickering about whether to go to Nantucket or Martha's Vineyard for the summer.  Service was excellent, and the food was good. I don't even LIKE Italian food, but it was good! I had the carpaccio salad app, and the lasagna. Both excellent. The cocktail menu is fun as well -- I had the Sinatra Smash, which was dandy.   Overall, a decent place to get an expensive Italian meal...but nothing to really set it apart from other Italian restaurants in town.",

The good was really good, but I'm not sure if it was so special it was worth the price.   We had a bit of a bad experience with the service here. We made a reservation at 8:00 pm on a Saturday. We checked in right at 8:00 pm, and were informed our table was going to be a few minutes. So, we sat down and had a drink while we were waiting. However, 45 minutes went by, and we still weren't seated. No one had come over to talk to us yet or update us on our table. The manager came over and let us know he would take care of our drinks, but we still weren't seated for another 15 minutes. I get it, Saturday in Vegas is busy. Some hiccups are understandable. But, this was totally crazy! It was nice of the manager to take care of our drinks, but there were no apologies or anything. The manager also made sure to have some appetizers ready for us right when we sat down. It was a nice touch and made up for it, but I feel like the manager should have come over to talk to us more and keep us updated.   Anyways. On to the meal. The appetizers were pretty dang awesome. We had the meatballs and polenta fries and the antipasto plate with mozzarella, olives, prosciutto and roasted peppers. The mozzarella was fresh and creamy. The meatballs were really good too. For my main I had the pennette, which had an italian sausage ragu. It was a really good dish, but not amazing or unique.   The restaurant has a really nice atmosphere too - very romantic. Overall, with the service issues and the price for the food, I'm just not sure if it was worth it. It ended up being a good night though.",

This is a five star restaurant and it has everything that you could expect from a high quality establishment.  First of all, the ambiance is set with the lighting and the music. In the background you constantly here the sounds of Frank Sinatra and many of his greatest hits dancing in your ear. The lighting is very romantic and intimate. The noise level was moderate but I really didn't mind.  You have several people waiting on your table to make sure that your every request is satisfied. I had a glass of Prosecco that night but if you're unsure of what to have with your meal, there is a Somalia on hand to assist you with any of your wine selections. I was quite impressed to see how many waiters were attentive to our table in the event that we needed something.  That night, I settled on an appetizer as my main course. I ordered the blue crab salad over tomato, cucumber and croutons. The amount of blue crab that they placed on the salad was amazing! The crab was light and sweet but not overpowered by the dressing. I also had a veal, beef and pork meatball with fried pancetta. Meatball was so moist and and cooked to perfection. A basket of various bread was also brought to our table. The assortment of bread varied from a rosemary herb bread sticks and a crusted Parmesan. They were paired with your choice of whipped butter or squash and black bean spread.   Overall, I was highly impressed and will definitely be back. As with any restaurant of this quality, they spared no expense to make sure the ingredients and the service are of the upmost quality. Yes very pricey but worth it!",

Our server Dina provided excellent service and was supported by several associates that filled the water glasses and removed the empty dishes. Since we arrived prior to the restaurant opening, our experience started in the bar with some cocktails that were later moved to our table by the hostess. We had a very comfortable 4 person table next to the life like portrait of Frank Sinatra.  Dinner began with a nice selection of breads. Our favorite was the date raisin combination accompanied with a basil flower butter spread.  The choice of appetizer was Panzanella which consisted of jumbo lump blue crab (really big pieces), brioche croutons, tomato and cucumber. Just a fantastic starter.  The entree of Branzino - Mediterranean Sea Bass was served on top of haricot vert, fingerling potatoes, tomato, yellow pepper emulsion salsa verde. This preparation of Branzino was the best I have ever experienced. The flavors were delightful and the fish filet was cooked to perfection.  Our  other entree a 10 oz beef tenderloin filet with cipollini onions and mushrooms in a red wine sauce. The steak was prepared as requested well done. However for a well done steak this one was as tender and juicy as one with pink inside. A superb piece of beef.   Dessert was Tiramisu served in a bowl with large chocolate slices on top. It was moist and full flavored.   The finale was 2 complementary Petit Four. A dark and a light chocolate.  Love it all. Service, Food, Atmosphere and Music. Next time we will dine on the outdoor patio. The patio looked inviting with the garden foliage and fireplaces",

I finally tried it last week and suffice to say it was everything I hoped it would be.  The menu is a mix of some old school Italian favorites with some dishes that are more sophisticated.   We shared the carpaccio for an appetizer and we got the branzino and gnocchi for entrees and the chocolate fedora filled with vahlrona chocolate mousse for dessert. Everything was exceptionally well prepared with descent sized portions.  Their food is the quality you would expect in a 5 star vegas hotel.  Our service was nothing short of exceptional with our waiter suggesting an off the menu cocktail when I was asking questions about different choices on the signature cocktail menu.   I forget what it was called but it had orange vodka and st Germain and was amazing!   The next time I'm in vegas I'll be back to try some of the more traditional items on the menu!",

    "text": "I left my old review up, so people can see how I used to feel about this place. My husband and will never set foot here again.  We chose Sinatra to celebrate TWO special occasions--our wedding annviersary, and my husband's birthday (they are a couple of days apart). With the infinite choices out there in Las Vegas, we chose Sinatra. Big mistake.  Our bill was over $340, and yet, they charged us for BOTH my husband's birthday dessert AND our anniversary dessert!!!  30 years of fine dining, and we've never experienced such a thing. We are the type of Wynn guests that get a rep assigned to us during our many stays--and this is how you treat us?  Obviously, with the amount of travel and fine dining that we do, and the fact that our bill was already over $340, this is NOT about money!   It's about the tackiness and low brow move, of a restaurant that bills itself as fine dining at a 5 star resort.  The server repeatedly acknowledged our anniversary, and my husband's birthday. The two desserts even had \"Happy Anniversary\" and \"Happy Birthday\" written on their respective plates--so it's not like they didn't know. We were shocked, paid the bill, along with a generous tip, and left completely aghast.  If the restaurant has a particular dessert designated for people celebrating a special occasion that they do not charge for, then the server should have TOLD US so we could make an informed decision. Also, if this were the case, then he would have presumably brought us that dessert too. Our server said \"Happy Anniversary\" and \"Happy Birthday\" and then PROCEEDED TO ASK US WHAT WE WANTED FOR DESSERT. So he completely bamboozled us into ordering TWO desserts that we otherwise would not even have ordered.   Disgusting! Completely unworthy of both the names \"Sinatra\" and \"Wynn\".",

I was not impressed with my entree, it lacked flavor. My boyfriend was happy with his meal, our biggest disappointment was for the quality of the food; the prices were too high.   He also ordered an old fashioned with Bullet Burbon and said it was one of the best drinks he's had in a long time. For dessert, we ordered the lemon cheesecake with raspberry sorbet, definitely the best course of the evening.   Our server, Roger, was fantastic, along with the rest of the staff we interacted with during the evening. Extremely professional and treat you phenomenally!  Its a great place for a romantic evening as well as a great place to dine before or after a show; we dined after watching the Beatles LOVE.",

My appetizer was good, and served hot, but my desert came out warm on the edges and cold and undercooked in the middle.   Worse, the service was terrible. Dinner took 3:15 minutes and not because we were slow with ordering. Our waiter was not on top of our table and also wasn't the least bit helpful with recommendations. For example, half the group did not realize the sides were not family style, and he didn't advise. Consequently when the entrees arrived multiple people were sitting there with just meat. Given it was well over 90 minutes since we arrived, no one was willing to order them at that point. I would only return to the bar for a cocktail to show visitors how pretty the restaurant is.",

One of the best aspects was their treatment of my wife who has food allergies. She was given a special menu which lists what you can order if you have certain allergies. At every course, our waiter--David Saunders, who gave us impeccable service--made note of how the particular dish was prepared. At many restaurants, if you have a food allergy you are treated as if you are a bother. This certainly wasn't the case here.  For our entrees, my wife had the Cioppino and I had Bistecca. It was one of the best steaks I've ever had.  I recommend the Sinatra Smash, if you want a mixed drink. It's delicious.  This place is not cheap and there is no way of getting around it. But you get what you pay for and we received a fantastic meal, a special night out, and one of the best experiences we have ever had in Las Vegas.",

Servers and host staff are very accommodating to your every wish. The decor is absolutely beautiful with a lush garden venue available for those who would like to dine alfresco complete with fireplaces and heaters for cooler weather. Menu is somewhat limited but complete in meat, fish and pasta categories. We decided to share a filet ( as ten ounce is the smallest available ) with pasta and a mixed green salad which we also shared. Our server placed everything in center of the table even going as far a slicing the filet for us. It was a True dining experience while listening to Frank croon in the back ground. To top it off we shared an over the top pana cotta and a flight of vintage ports from ten to forty years of age. There are many great  choices for Italian food in Las Vegas but as Steve Wynn says in the menu forward; I think Frank would really like this place- and so will you!",

I went into Sinatra and took a seat at the bar. The bartender Peter is a True master.  The bar was immaculate, but so was his technique. He masterfully measured and perfectly mixed nearly a hundred drinks in front of me, never dropping even a grain of salt from a rim. His workspace and technique were immaculate.   I enjoyed 3 Smashes, a delicious concoction where the main players are Gentleman Jack and muddled black berries. I can see why this cocktali has won mention from the James Beard Foundation, and numerous references in Food & Wine Magazine.  To start off the meal I had the Prosciutto & Pear appetizer, which was flawless and delicious, nothing new here, but fantastically delicious. For dinner I had the Pennette, a sausage Ragu with a smart smack of fresh and vibrant herbs added for kick.  THIS MIGHT BE THE PASTA I HAVE EVER TASTED.     I found the service here to be remarkable. This is a great choice for a casual dinner or a serious romantic affair.  Most definitely stop at the bar for a Sinatra Smash before dinner.  My highest reccomendation.  At the Wynn, buisness casual at a minimum to dressy.  Excellent, friendly wait staff, not stuffy, knowledgeable, and appreciative of the diner.",

With the almighty Sinatra's awards displayed for all patrons to see, golden curtains draping across the windows to the beautifully lit outdoor patio, and a cozy, intimate feel in the dining room, there's no wonder Encore guests deem this to be one of the most alluring restaurants to dine at.  Swoon to Frank's biggest hits as you sip on a glass of wine or one of their specialty cocktails. The bellini was peachy sweet and smooth. A bit heavy on the peach puree, but just the right amount of bubbly. Everything about this venue is classy, including the menus. A soft glossy binder with a very simple selection of pastas, meat, and seafood - I've never admired such immense detail in a restaurant.  Being forewarned by previous diners, I decided to split an order of the chicken parmigiana and a side of penne pasta with my gal pal. Originally, the side was supposed to be spaghetti, but I asked our waiter if we could substitute it to any other pasta and penne was on the list.   The chicken was superb! Moist and tender, but not overly drenched in tomato sauce. The mozzarella was baked to a browned ooey gooey perfection and just melted in my mouth. I tried a taste of my friend's chicken saltimbocca (prosciutto wrapped chicken breast w/ asiago & sage) which was rich in flavor, but the prosciutto was overcooked and didn't melt onto the chicken. The capesante (seared Maine diver scallops) was my favorite dish of the evening. 4 plump scallops crispy on the outside, firm and chewy on the inside. The chef did a wonderful job searing each piece perfectly.   The only factor that caused Sinatra to fall short of a 5-star review was that the prices were waaay overpriced for what you're getting. But I suppose it's True when they say you're paying for the ambiance. For Italian influenced cuisine, I don't believe 2 slices of chicken parmigiana should cost $30...no matter how delicious they were.   Regardless, I'd come back. I'll just have to work extra hard at the tables before walking through the front door though.",

Very impressed with the hospitality - both times we celebrated special occasions with anniversaries, and this time also a birthday - we were given a warm reception and hand-written cards - thoughtfully done.   Our wait staff was fantastic and the food was so delicious - we brought some very special wines, including a 2007 Sinatra Napa wine that they no longer make - and the staff was thrilled to see that bottle.   They made great recommendations for the meal to go with our wines and it was truly a memorable meal.   And at dessert, the plates were personalized for our celebrations.   So nice - the meal lasted about two hours and the time went by too quickly!  Thank you for a most lovely dinner and we look forward to our next visit.",

The food is definitely Italian and the best I've had in a long time. The ambiance provides for a very romantic evening with someone you love. Both my husband and I enjoyed our evening immensely. We'll definitely return. If you want to try something fun, try the Sinatra Smash at this restaurant. Other establishments in the Wynn Hotel say they can replicate it, believe me when I say they can't.   Visited July 2013",

After spending useless time in the casino, we approached  the front desk again and finally in 10 minutes they walked us to outside table without even asking if we are comfortable with outside sitting (by the way it was 40 degree F. I asked the lady at front if we could get  complimentary glass of wine as a compensation for waiting 40 minutes with reservation, she told me with an attitude, - \" You can get a soft drink\". Nobody ever apologized to offered anything complimentary. The food arrived around 10:40 pm; We ordered 1 bottle of water, they brought 2 ($9/each), which remained on the table without touching. Oh, before I forget; the meat was not seasoned well, not matching with a high price; so this was a big disappointment from the beginning to the end. The only positive thing I could say about this place is the set up of the tables, the restrooms and the location. Other than that, please don't spend $100 for each person for the restaurant that is lack of simple customer service.",

This place definitely captures that mood. However, the food was decent. It's better to make your own entree rather than picking from their menu, which doesn't have that much of a selection. They are pretty accommodating to your taste though. Dessert was probably the best part. The restaurant is kind of loud because it's so small so you can't hear the music playing or anything. The one thing that was a bit annoying was that no table has just one waiter. We were served by 5 different people, which was a pain. Next time we're in Vegas, we'll probably try something else.",

Once (also in a good way) when I saw the bathrooms (haha, they've got some nice bathrooms in there).  And the third time (in a bad, but appreciative way) when we got the check.  Was it expensive? HELL YES Was it worth every penny? HELL YES Will I go back? Certainly, after I gather a few more paychecks.  I had the Polpettine appetizer (meatballs with polenta fries).  It was 4 tiny meatballs that were ok.  Save your money and don't order this one!  Ordered the Ossobuco \"My Way\" which is the house specialty.  It is a braised veal served with risotto.  This was AMAZING!!!  Ordered something for dessert.  Don't remember what it was.  It was pretty good, from what I remember.  But the Ossobuco totally stole the show and overshadowed everything else about the meal.  The bill for 6 of us was well over $600, so it ain't cheap.  Service was exceptional.  Reservations are recommended.  There is a dress code.  The place is a very classy, so please don't throw on your Ed Hardy dragon t-shirt and your way too tight True Religion jeans and think you'll be ok.  You will definitely stick out like a sore douche.  Slacks and a button down collared shirt is good enough.",

    "text": "What would Frank Sinatra's favorite place to eat look like?  Sinatra is located in the Encore resort, adjacent and connected to the Wynn. Billed as a homage to Frank Sinatra and the only restaurant licensed to use his name, you are greeted at the entry by several of his awards including an Oscar and an Emmy.   I had made reservations over the phone that afternoon but they had been lost. Luckily it was slow for a Friday night and we were able to be seated right away. The decor is all designed to make the patron comfortable from the word go. The best description I can give is of a late 60s elegant living room. Not posh or fancy or casual, just comfortable elegance. Along one wall are floor to ceiling glass walls with a patio and outdoor fireplace just outside, all to evoke feeling of being in someone's home, perhaps at a dinner party with some celebrity friends dropping by. There are large portraits of Frank throughout, all beautifully lit. Not museum or gallery lighting, more homey than that.  The wine list is a bit pricey but offers a few sub-100 dollar bottles and the one we chose was very enjoyable. The menu is simple but there are 4-5 selections in each category of appetizers, pasta, fish, and meat. We each ordered appetizers including Prosciutto and Melon, Blue Crab Salad, and Butternut Squash Soup. All were good and the portion sizes were good to generous. There were two entree specials but we decided to stick to the menu. The entrees took a while but we weren't in a hurry so it was fine. To be fair, the waiter had asked if we had any time restrictions such as a show and we said no.   The Lobster Risotto was a bit bland so we asked for and promptly received some lemon wedges. The pasta with sausage and peppers was simple but good. The gnocchi stuffed with ricotta was also simple but good. The major exception was desert. We ordered a gelato selection that was very good and a Tiramisu that was truly excellent. No matter how many times you've had Tiramisu in other restaurants, this one gives new definition to the word 'smooth'. After your first bite, you'll know what I mean.  The service was attentive but not over the top. You'll never have to ask for your water to be refilled, your waiter will always be easily accessible, and any special dietary requests such as food allergies or special preparations will be quickly and graciously handled. You will not have your refolded napkin waiting for you when you return from the bathroom. Your wine glass won't automatically be refilled every time it reaches the half way mark.   And there in lies the rub of the restaurant. I suspect that many come here with expectations of grandeur at every turn. This is not and will never be a haven for foodies the world over. You will not get a Michelin 3-Star like impression of the selection or the food. You will not be hovered over by staff anticipating your every move, attending to you like royalty.   At the end of the day, this restaurant was designed to pay homage to one man. As Steve Wynn says on the first page of the menu, \"I think this is the kind of place he would dig\".  So what do you envision Sinatra's favorite evening with food and drink to look like?  For me, Sinatra was a man's man; a guy who enjoyed good food, good drinks and above all, good company. He enjoyed being comfortable with a certain easy elegance. That is the key to this place. Come with a desire to relax and enjoy an evening with a few good friends. Sit down, relax, get comfortable, and let it all happen. It's all designed to be comfortable and let you and your guests get to know each other and enjoy a special  evening. I'm sure Frank had many an evening like this and I'm sure Steve Wynn is right; Frank would have dug this place.",

My wife and I ate here around 9 on Saturday night without a reservation, and only had to wait about 5 minutes to be seated.  We decided to sit outside since it was such a nice night.  We were seated right next to the fireplace, and they even had heat lamps going as well in case it got a little chilly.  It was a very romantic atmosphere, as the greenery outside was very nice and well kept.  For our meal, we split a caesar salad, which was very good, except for the fact that it comes in whole romaine leaves, so you have to cut it up.  This was only a minor inconvenience, as the salad was very good.  For our meals, I ordered the chicken parm, while my wife ordered the lobster risotto.  We also ordered a side of mashed potatoes.  My chicken parm was excellent, and the mashed potatoes were very good as well.  The lobster risotto my wife ordered was out of this world.  I'm not a big lobster fan, but this risotto was the best I have ever tasted.  Everything was very flavorful and well presented.  They give you a bread basket as well which was good.  We saved room for dessert and ordered the lemon cheesecake.  I'm not a big lemon fan at all, but our waiter advised us that there wasn't a big lemon flavor to it.  He was right, it was excellent and just the right size.  Overall, we will definitely be back here.  It was around $150 for 2 people, but well worth it.  Especially when it ends up getting comped down the line by the casino. :)",

The design of the bar from floor to ceiling is interesting and great talking points. The colors and fabrics are all cool! Then there is dinner... that hits it out of the park.

    "text": "Is it not the same due to new staff?  Sinatra's always been 5-star worthy the many times we've been before; always somehow getting the same server and bartender in the bar.  This time brought us a new waiter and bartender which we didn't think twice about until our waiter got worried our food was taking too long for some reason and told us so on two different passes by our table.  We weren't worried, quality takes time, but he was and told us he asked the chef to hurry up.  Big mistake, because the $46 lobster risotto we love so much came to us way undercooked.  I was picking risotto from my teeth all night.  All else was great, but I'm a little worried that the staff changes might be a trend downward.  Four stars for past perfect experiences.",

This year when we went, it was end of July, and 110 degrees outside at 8 pm.  My boyfriend had long salmon colored shorts and a long sleeve colored shirt.  He had nice shoes and looked quite appropriate.  After checking in, the hostess came over to us at the bar and told us my boyfriend would have to have long pants on to dine in the dining room.  As we were staying at Mandalay Bay, we couldn't go back to change quickly.  So, they asked him his size and went to fetch his size in black pants.  While he was changing, I looked in the bar, and there were guys in ripped jeans, t-shirts and tennis shoes.  Needless to say, my boyfriend was not happy about it, but he did change his clothes because we were excited to eat there.  It did make him feel like a second class citizen and I don't feel like the situation was handled well.  The service is good, but everything is overpriced, and we live in the UWS of Manhattan....so we know expensive food.  Just be aware of the dress code if you want to go....",

Sinatra is a large restaurant with a bar upfront playing Sinatra movies and a large dining area filled with Sinatra songs playing as you dine. Everything about this place is top notch. The staff is extremely attentive and provides wonderful service. Our server Tim was friendly, engaging and was on top of it all.  We ordered a bottle of wine to enjoy with our meal. An array of wonderful bread was brought to our table to enjoy, as well as an amuse-bouche of a delicious creamy mushroom soup in a shot glass.  My husband had Frank's meatballs and polenta fries to start and veal ravioli for his entree. I tasted both and the veal meatballs were flavorful but lacked softness like my Italian dad makes. The polenta fries were light and airy and perfectly crispy on the outside. The ravioli were in the shape of gyoza and were full of flavorful veal. I had the beet salad to start and the grilled octopus for my entree.  The beet salad came with a round of goat cheese and pistachios, full of flavor and crunch.  My grilled octopus came with heirloom tomatoes and micro-greens, delicious. We were so full after dinner, but Tim brought us a sampling of dessert - lemon tart, melt in your mouth chocolate, a little cake and a shortbread nut cookie. The whole experience was fabulous!  Highly recommend.",

The hospitality that Sinatra provides is the reason for the 5 stars , I've never been to a place that has actual coat check, when I asked where the restroom is located a gentleman walked me to the door. We were consistently checked on and thank you for making us feel at home. My girlfriend got the filet medium but came out medium well, almost well done. I got the spaghetti and clams but it lacked seasoning. We will return to give the food another try.",

The price of all the plates are very very expensive when you compare with the quality.

The chicken was well cooked and not over done with cheese.

The sommelier Patrick was awesome!    We had the caprese and a fettuccine alfredo with black truffles as apps. The capresse was ok, but the alfredo was a huge disappointment. The black truffles had no aroma... they clearly used an oil in the alfredo to get any flavor.  I tasted it prior to the shavings of truffle and after fresh truffle was added. No difference. Look at the picture. They covered it in shavings! Yet flavorless $105 for the appetizer that was a complete bust.   For dinner we got the osso buco and veal parmesan. Both were nice cuts of meat, decent sauces but overall I would say just \"ok\"    Clearly we had only a few items from the menu so maybe we were just unlucky.   The manager cane over and apologized and offered to buy us dessert. Nice jester. Hind sight I should have told them eairlier and maybe got something different",

I even ate here on Frank Sinatra's birthday. I just happened to be in town, so I had to do it. Can't wait to come back!",

I'm not used to having so many choices, especially in a fine dining restaurant! I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND Sinatra to any vegans who find themselves in Las Vegas! A perfect place for a special occasion meal... and honestly, it wasn't even as expensive as we were prepared for it to be!  My husband isn't even vegan, but he found the vegan menu so compelling that he ordered the vegan chicken parmesan, and it was ridiculously good. I had the vegan Caesar salad and chicken marsala (which came with vegan gnocchi!) and they were both outstanding. Sadly, we got too stuffed to eat dessert!  In addition to the food, the service was perfect! They really paid attention to little details. When we arrived, they gave us a handwritten Thank You card for coming to spend our special day with them. At the end of the meal, they brought us some sorbet on a plate that had Happy Anniversary written on it in chocolate. Also, the busser originally told me they were out of vegan butter, which was no big deal for me..... we asked for olive oil instead, and it was the best olive oil I have ever eaten. Then, like 10 minutes later, he showed up with vegan butter, explaining they went and got some from a different restaurant for me! Talk about going the extra mile!   Thank you for making our anniversary so special! I'm already dreaming of returning for my birthday! :-)",

I try to stay away from ordering pasta dishes but I heard how good this was and was glad I did.   For entrees we had the Veal Parm and Branzino. Both were excellent. The portion size was very generous. The Parmesan was nice and thin with a delicious cheese and sauce. The branzino sauce was perfect and was served over potato and veggies.   We had the tiramisu for desert.  I am a big tiramisu fan and order it at least once a week. It was served in an oversized martini glass. Once again the portion was generous and taste was exactly what I hoped.   The only reason I am not giving 5 stars is the price. If price is not a concern then definitely make plans to go here.",

Our waitress, Suzanne, was incredibly knowledgeable and walked us through the menu dish by dish in an eloquent and descriptive narrative. She was wonderful. Ask for her if you can!  I had the Caprese salad which was, without question, the best one I have ever had. It had a medley of fresh heirloom baby tomatoes, perfectly placed balsamic glaze, and a salad of other herbs and micro greens. The fresh mozzarella was everything you could hope for - firm exterior that broke beneath the fork to reveal a soft and creamy inside. To die for.   I can't even articulate the rest; for if I do, I may cry of sadness that I am no longer eating it. Just go. Seriously.",

We attended on a Saturday night without a reservation. We only had to wait about 30 minutes so we gambled a little while waiting. The hostess was so friendly and called a little earlier than we expected to be seated.   Once inside we were greeted by our server Pedro who was very friendly. When we asked for suggestions on meals he went into great detail about the most popular items and made everything sound so good. We decided to order Penette and the Lasagna. Both were very delicious and creamy.   Before our food was served we were given bread with yummy spreads and we ordered a few rounds of drinks. We started with the Sinatra Smash. I'm not a huge lover of whiskey but this drink was actually one of my favorites. While sipping on our drinks we decided to order a few appetizers, the Mussels and another one that had meatballs and cheese bread(I forgot the name of it). Both were pretty good but I liked the mussels better. They were served with a tomato sauce over it that was really good. Once we were finished with our appetizers dinner was served. The portion sizes aren't big so I'm glad that we did order an appetizer to help fill us up :) Halfway through our dinner Pedro served us with a complimentary serving of the chefs soup of the night. I'm not sure if they do that every night but it was a kind gesture and the soup was really creamy and light, it was a tomato basil soup.   I loved this place and it was so nice to have a romantic dinner for our first night in Vegas. The food was excellent, the service was perfect and the atmosphere was wonderful. I will definitely come back to have another romantic evening. By far one of my favorite places to eat in Vegas!",

It is a large restaurant with outdoor seating - I could see a fireplace out there that looked very inviting. Resos recommended. The dishes to me are perhaps pricier than they need to be for what you get... BUT.. if you order the clams and spaghetti like I did ($33), you will get a ton of clams heaped on and pasta that is not overcooked, phew! Too many places overcook their pasta and you feel ripped off, not here. Some may say the seasoning is a bit too much but for me it was fine. Especially as there is no salt and pepper on the table. The clams had been properly cleaned and were not gritty. I had to ask for black pepper for my pasta and it should have been offered for my appetizer salad but, small detail.  The Riesling white wine was very good but for $16 a glass it better be! My friends each had the lasagna (also around $33) and enjoyed it. I found portions to be adequate. I do recommend the Caesar salad to start although I found it to be missing that bit of bacon to make it extra yummy. Perfectly cool and crisp lettuce, dressed perfectly, not overloaded with croutons. We also shared a Caprese salad and while this was a less hearty option, staff split it on 2 plates without us even asking and the mozza was very fresh.  We skipped dessert as we were just too full but we left feeling like we had a nice meal and would recommend if staying at or near Wynn/Encore.",

Upon arrival for our reservation, we were promptly seated at a table where a handwritten card greeted us and thanked us for celebrating our anniversary at Sinatra. We had three different people congratulate us as well - the hostess and 2 servers.   We are typically \"steak people\" instead of seafood/pasta but we just knew that anything coming out of Sinatra's kitchen would be delicious so we veered from our norms. We split the Caprese salad and I went with the Lobster Risotto and my wife ordered the Agnolotti, knowing we would probably trade plates halfway through. They also brought a variety of breads and butters/spreads - all delicious. The Caprese was a perfect example how simple ingredients can come together to be something outstanding. A variety of tomatoes and a great balsamic made this the best that I have had.  The lobster risotto came with large chunks of butter poached lobster and a light risotto in cream sauce. The Agnolotti were filled with cheese and soaked in an oil/basil sauce. We finished off the meal with the tiramisu recommended by our waiter which was exquisite.  I have absolutely no complaints. If you want to get real picky - it was a bit on the noisy side, but I prefer that sometimes.  The service was top notch and I was able to enjoy this all while sitting directly beneath a 6 foot tall painting of Old Blue Eyes. It doesn't get any better.",

    "text": "When my boyfriend and I went to Vegas over the Halloween weekend, enjoying one of Steve Wynn's new vegan meals was a definite MUST. All weekend I looked forward to it and when I called to make reservations the operator was very patient and help me pick a good restaurant. Italian, mid-ranged prices, named after one of the best singer's ever. Yes, thank you, resrevation for two! While the decor was a bit more casual than I would expect for an Italian restaurant, I enjoyed the atmosphere and all the Sinatra memorabilia covering the walls. Now onto the food...  We got both the vegan version of the beet salad (ie sans cheese) and the  heirloom tomato salad. Tomato salad was ok, very delicious ingredients with lots of flavor but the simplicity of this dish was put to shame but the flavor explosion that was the beet salad. Good Lord! You MUST get the beet salad, absolutely delicious, it was so special with the pieces of citrus and what a beautiful presentation!   The bf is not vegan but he said his vegetarian ravioli with asparagus creme melted in his mouth. I imagine they must make it on-site. Now I had eaten some \"vegan rissotto\" at Sensi at the Bellagio just 2 days before and it was sadly one of the worst meals I have ever had. Severely undercooked and bland bland bland! The mushroom risotto at Sinatra however, was bursting with flavor, creamy, and chock full of exotic mushrooms in every single bite. I like to savor my food and save the best for last but it soon became clear that this risotto had plenty of yummy mushrooms to go around. Literally several per bite. I Seriously, they do not skimp!   They also had homemade fruit sorbets that were like a punch of tart, vibrant flavor in every bite. SOOO amazing!   Also, the service was impeccable and so attentive. When a (for lack of better term) busboy saw me stand up and turn towards the right (the entrance was to the left), he stopped what he was doing and walked over to the door that leads out to the hallway with the restrooms, and waited for me to walk over and opened the door for me. One of the best meals and best dining experiences I've ever had. I will definitely be back every time I'm in Vegas to explore more of Steve Wynn's delicious vegan options!",

I had the Agnolotti (small pasta pockets filled with butternut squash, sage, parmesan, brown butter) and it was delicious. The portion size was just right, the pasta cooked perfectly and the temperature right on. There are also several dessert options to choose from. My table ordered most of them, and seemed to be quite happy. Our server was excellent as well. Best service I received the entire time I was in town.   If you go in a larger group, be prepared for a hefty bill. The prices are a little steep, but if you're looking for an old-school, classy experience, head over to Sinatra. You might even see Paul Anka there, like we did.",

It was one of my favorite restaurants I have ever been to - not only in Vegas but anywhere. Wife and I are Sinatra fans (who isn't?) but even if you are not the food, service and overall restaurant are absolutely top notch. We had Caesar salad, Pork Chop special and Linguini with clams - all were delicious and well presented. We were celebrating our 50th birthdays, had a corner table, were not rushed and the service is incredible. Our server Thomas was extremely knowledgeable about the menu and was truly the best. He was so personal that we felt like we knew him forever. When in Vegas, Sinatra restaurant is a MUST.",

Wine list was impressive. Only thing is Sinatra theme really wasn't that strong, just a couple of pictures on the walls really.

They have the best chocolate lava cake Taft I've ever had, but it's very small. Like Oreo cookie size small. The ricotta cheesecake is my favorite on the menu.

    "text": "This is where I wish Yelp had 1/2 stars for Sinatra isn't a 2 and it's not a 3.. 2.5 is more like it..  Dined while in Vegas.  Called for reservations noting an anniversary and asking for a special table near the window toward the read of the restaurant.  Told 'No Problem.'  We arrive at the restaurant which is nicely appointed I might add.  Orange table cloths and wonderful pictures of Sinatra in all his glory.  Being a huge \"Frank\" fan I'm loving it..  Lots of Sinatra music and a few \"Rat Pack\" sessions so I am thinking all is good.  Drinks were outstanding..  Time to be seated..  Well, let's just say the 'No Problem' request went out the door..  Ended up at a table near the entrance.  Seems the table in the area we wanted was given to someone else.. I asked about the \"no problem table' but after a few minutes of that \"I don't care/can't do anything for you/just take a seat\" stare from the hostess I figured there was no sense in pursuing the issue..  Not the way to kick off an anniversary celebration..  Moving on..  Waiter appears; runs down specials; hands dinner and drink menu along with wine list; advises who our waiter will be and promptly vanishes.  We sit.. We wait..  We sit..  We wait..  Approximately 20 minutes later our waiter appears.  Jovial guy..  He does the specials again..  We order another drink..  Waiter disappears..  We sit..  We wait..  We sit.. We wait..  Another 20 minutes and drinks appear.!  Order appetizers which were actually quite good.  Bread Salad with Crab was very nice as were the meatballs.  The polenta sticks were not my favorite..  Rather dull..  Main course of Chicken Parmesan which was mediocre at best and didn't stand out..  Eggplant Parmesan as a side was good..  Side of pasta with marinara was strange..  Pasta was nice; hand made and had the nice \"al dente\" of fresh but the sauce was odd..  More like a tomato cream sauce than a True marinara. \"Chef's Liberty\" I guess but not a good one.  Dessert was Ricotta Lollipops where were interesting but not overly tasty.  Wine list is long and expensive so be forewarned.  All in all Sinatra was not what I'd hoped for a special day like an anniversary.  Service was lacking; food middle-of-the-road and severely over priced; and, well, that \"No Problem Table\" is going to stick in my mind for a long time.  Restaurants are build on many things.  Service, food quality, presentation and, I think, promises.!  Frank would not have been pleased.!!!",

    "text": "Sinatra was the perfect place to dine after a very, very long day.  This had to be one of the very few relaxing and enjoyable nights I had during the week I spent in Vegas.  Unlike the Encore Hotel in which the restaurant resides, the decor is reminiscent of 1950s \"Hollywood\" class that reminds you of an upscale bar/lounge with plush seating.  The foyer houses two pedestal cases bearing homage to Old Blue Eyes, prominently displaying his Emmy and Oscar trophies.  The menu was fairly simple with some classic Italian favorites.  My colleague and I wanted to try everything but opted for some house recommendations: the Cappesante (seared maine diver scallop, with a light celery and kumquat salad); freshmade rigatoni and agnolotti; and tiramisu the Sinatra way.  The flavor contrast between courses, as recommended by our server, was much appreciated.  The Cappesante delivered a delicious, clean punch.  And our server, without even having been asked, split the flavorful rigatoni and agnolotti for us (so thoughtful and much more elegant than if we were to dig in each other's plates from across the table!).  The tiramisu is something not to be missed.    This is a place that I would certainly want to make a return visit to on my next trip to Las Vegas.",

Patrick did s great job opening and decanting a couple bottles of wine.  Wait staff started strong and we had appetizers that were wonderful.   Steak and big eye tuna carpaccio were both great.  Caprese was amazing.   Ordered veal parmigiano was the best ever.  But... yes there is a but... two of us ordered filet mignon.  Rare and medium rare.  They came out medium and well done.  And when we complained, the service went to hell.  Yes they remade our steaks.  No flavor without the peppercorn sauce.   And not tender.  Had two birthdays at our table and the waiter couldn't even say happy birthday.    Even with candles in the deserts.  Pathetic.   Management should be embarrassed.   But nothing short of arrogant.  We started to say something and we were ignored.   Will not be back any time soon.  Price point versus quality and overall service not worth it.   Best part of the experience other than great friends was Patrick taking care of us with the wine.",

    "text": "Sinatra's, located in the Wynn resort, has a classic elegant charm displaying great attention to detail along with the \"Frank\" memorabilia. Upon arrival we sat at the bar where they had High Society playing on a large flat panel above the bar. It was a playful atmosphere and I enjoyed looking out to the patio area that had fireplaces, trees wrapped in white lights as well as heat lamps. Everyone inside & out seemed to be having a fun evening.   Shortly after arriving we were promptly seated in a large dining area~ not very intimate as I was hoping but nice nonetheless. Our server was very efficient in taking our order which included the Polpettine (meatballs & polenta fries) appetizer for my husband and the Panzanella con Granchio (lump blue crab, brioche croutons, tomatoes, cucumber with tomato fonduta) for myself. My husband thoroughly enjoyed his meatballs and we were both surprised how much we enjoyed the polenta fries which I've never had before. My appetizer arrived looking much different than I visualized but I truly enjoyed the large pieces of blue crab as well as the tomato fonduta. We leisurely enjoyed our appetizers also partaking of the breadbasket & sipping our drinks. For our main entrees my husband had the  Lasagne Bolognese that arrived in a oval tin and initially wasn't sure how to \"dig in\". However, once started he said it was a very flavorful lasagna and was very pleased with his selection. I had Frank's Spaghetti & Clams which was served in a bowl overflowing with clams. The clams were cooked to perfection - tender and not chewy & the pasta was al dente how I like it. The only thing that needed some \"help\" was the tomato garlic broth which was a bit too mild and needed a bit more seasoning.   Our server  who seemed a bit overwhelmed with a very large party and several smaller parties did his best to be attentive however, he took my empty cocktail glass never asking if I would like another. So, I didn't get another scrumptious pear martini until we finished our meal.   Once the table was cleared the server brought a small plate of various chocolates, biscotti and a piece of caramel which was soft & melt-in-your-mouth yummy.    We both very much enjoyed our experience and, if we find ourselves back at the Wynn, would certainly partake in another meal at Sinatra's.",

Our group was 10 and everyone complimented what they ordered. Three of us had the chicken parm and it was really delicious. Tip, order pasta on the side. It does not come with it. Some had steak and one had the lobster risotto, again all said good things about their dish. A few ordered dessert, the cake and ice cream lollipops, which several enjoyed. I ordered fresh berries and it was a nice assortment of very fresh fruits. The blackberries were the size of my thumb! The atmosphere was quite nice without being stuffy or pretentious. We sat near the windows overlooking a beautifully manicured garden. Dress code is men just need collared shirts and dress jeans are allowed. No shorts.

It was too cold to be seated outside, but if you ever have the opportunity, DO IT! The patio area is so lovely and surrounded by gardens.  We sat at the windows overlooking the gardens, and it was very romantic.  Try the daily specials! I ordered the truffle ravioli (I am a truffles freak) which was at market price ($90).

I have to admit, I wasn't overly excited when looking at the menu at first glance-especially because I have Celiac Disease and didn't see many gluten-free options that interested me.  However, our amazing waiter was extremely helpful coming up with gluten free options for me.  He made sure to tell me that they offer both quinoa and rice based pastas along with a variety of sauces and even brought me some g-free bread!!  When I ordered my pasta with vodka sauce, he even went out of his way to look up if a non-grain based vodka needed to be used.  For someone with a dietary restriction, it was so nice to have a waiter that went out of his way to help me find a dish that I could eat and truly enjoy!!  Not only was our waiter amazing, but all the food we had was beyond delicious.  I will definitely be back next time I am in Vegas!!",

The Osso Bucco could've been a little more tenderer . The lamp chops were flavorful and moist; but the green bean sides tasted of burnt olive oil. Unaged ribeye that lacked flavor.  Truffle foie grois raviolis where the handmade pasta tasted pasty.  Small kitchen misses that ruined what could've been a more perfect dining experience.   In a town  with world class kitchens, the food tasted sadly, mediocre...maybe it was a bad night for the kitchen!",

We waited to order apetizers but the only staff seemed confused by how to bring five people who were having drinks into the larger dining area. The bartender brought me a sip of $15 per glass wine - the cheapest. I asked how much a bottle would be. $65! I had heard the osso bucco was good. Not for me at $50. We walked and ate at Magianno's , literally across the street. Same wine, same bottle, $32. Sinatras is for high rollers who get comped or tourist suckers. Save your money. Got Matteo's in Westwood, CA. , where Sinatra really liked to eat.",

It's not particularly impressive compared to those Wynn boasts.  The food also is unmoving although the 3-course prix fixe menu at $56 presents a good value.  The dining experience would have been unmemorable had it not been for their tiramisu.  Chocolate and cake lovers will definitely enjoy this moist, well balanced dessert.",

I waited at the bar for the rest of my party and was entertained by the television set showing clips from Frank Sinatra's films.  We were seated a few minutes after the balance of our party arrived. The room is smallish and the decor was somewhat subdued.  Service was friendly and prompt.  The menu is not extensive, with only a few entrees.  The lasagna entree was good, but the Osso Bucco, was outstanding and worth making a return visit for (the meat fell off the bone and was infused with wonderful flavor).   A large selection of wines including many Italian choices is available.  The portions were decently sized.",

We went to Sinatra's one night after a show around 9:30 and the place looked like a swanky Chigago/NY type bar with tons of Tony Soprano type men dressed there.  Had to wait a minute for a table, so ordered one of their signature cocktails...Sinatra Smash?...bourbon and muttled blackberries- what could be better than Antioxidants mixed with Bourbon?  VERY POTENT.  Sat down to dinner- good waitstaff- yummy raisin walnut bread.  Mom ordered Osso Bucco which was delicious- said the marrow was the best thing (served with gremollata on top and risotto) and I got the Lasagna which comes in its own cassoulet- huge portion, but some of the best I've had ever!  Enjoyed our time there- not my favorite of all time, but really good for a swanky atmosphere with good food.",

    "text": "I'm conflicted. The restaurant is classic, elegant, and sophisticated. The crowd was mixed with younger and older energy. The food was simple and uninspiring.  Perhaps it was what I ordered (branzino). Or perhaps it was the cold service. It just wasn't the dining experience you would expect from a restaurant with such high accolades.  We started off with their standard breadbasket which was good. The rest of the food just didn't meet our expectations. My friend ordered a dish that was overdone on the spice. There was so much heat in it that it ruined his palette. My other friend had a lobster risotto that looked delicious. However, the risotto was surprisingly bland and she didn't finish it.  My branzino lacked substance and was overdressed with EVOO.  The service itself was... Meh.  While we were tended by three different people, our cocktail / wine selections were slow to be ordered / reordered and our water was slow to be filled. Our primary server seemed overwhelmed and in attentive.  I was personally in a rush to get to an event and had to ask for the bill repeatedly before it finally came. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and assume that they were just extremely busy.  Nonetheless this was my experience.  I want to give Sinatra another chance but with so many fine dining options in Vegas... I just don't know if I'll ever get back around to it.  Good luck with your own experience.",

Therefore you may want to couple good food with atmosphere and Sinatra has great atmosphere and amenities.  From the generous leather backed chairs to the decorator tableclothes and polished cotton napkins the place makes you feel comfortable.    The sommelier was polite and helpful and the wait staff very attentive.  The highlights of the meal included fabulous Osso Busco, carparccio, and Branzino.    Could write more - but no need - as this place is no brainer - especially for those staying at the Encore or Wynn.  Trust me you will be happy.",

The clam appetizer, was decent but didn't taste fresh.  I had the halibut for dinner, so, so dry.  My side by side dinner companions both tasted my dish and confirmed, it was the worst fish they have ever had.  It tasted like cardboard.  I'm not sure if this is the theme for the hotel, because the night before we ate at Andreas and it was also dry.  Horrible horrible food.  Service:  Service was tolerable but not the best.  I did give one additional star for providing separate checks.  Sinatra also added on tip, when Andrea's didn't.  Inconsistent policies.    Would not go back, nor recommend.",

Of course Franks enchanting voice blasted in the background.. Delicious  The drinks - 5 stars all the way. I sipped on a whiskey concoction suggested by the bartender. I don't recall the name but it has raspberries in it and it was fantastic! Service - Top Notch! Food: We started with the quartet of duck liver crostini, crudo (tuna with fennel, Mozzarella, and seasoned market vegetables.. ALL made to perfection!  AG ordered the risotto- creamy; exactly how risotto should be.. delishh I ordered the ravioli stuffed with lobster and spicy red sauce... hmph; i didn't love it.. so instead I shared the risotto..   I give Sinatra 4 stars because everything was perfect except for my dish..  I wouldn't normally be that generous when a dish is off but the restaurant is themed after my favorite singer afterall..",

While the price tag doesn't always make it possible, I'm a total foodie in the making and my experience at Sinatra's was fantastic! The service was impeccable and accommodating and the lobster risotto was so perfectly prepared that I nearly lamented having it my first night away because everything else I ever ate between there, California, and back in New York has paled in comparison (and I've tried three other lobster risottos at various restaurants!).  My father had the lasagna and all but inhaled it whereas we all split some appetizers. I fully recommend loosening the hold on your wallet so that you can loosen your belt when your stomach is thanking you!  Plus, the ambiance (as a fan of ol' Blue Eyes) is totally worth it alone!   Shame on you Sinatra's for spoiling me, and I mean that in the most loving and grateful way possible.",

    "text": "Definitely 5 stars. My review here is of the vegan menu at Sinatra. However, I should note that many dishes on the vegan menu are also found on the regular menu with slight alterations so I'm assuming taste and quality wise, we're all on the same page.   When Chef Theo Schoenegger was given the task of creating a vegan menu, he didn't choose to treat that as a chore and create a menu chock full of salads and dishes a 2 year old could whip up. He obviously rose to the challenge and created a passionate menu with hearty vegan dishes.   As a vegetarian, I avoid vegan entrees at Italian restaurants as I'm not a fan of vegan cheese and cream-less soups/pastas. Sinatra really wowed me with what they created within these boundaries.   The vegan menu here is astonishing. There are 3 starters (a Caesar salad, a beet salad and a butternut squash soup). 2 pasta dishes and 3 main courses and 3 desserts. Some dishes use Gardein protein.   We ordered the soup to share. A smooth, creamy (?) soup with a kick in it. Marinating in the soup were vegan ricotta cheese dumplings. Neither me nor my husband are fans of butternut squash but this soup hit the ball out of the park.   For our second course (yes we did the Italian thing and had pasta and a main), we each ordered a pasta dish. My husband ordered the vegan ricotta cheese dumplings in an asparagus cream sauce. Divine. I didn't even realize the cheese was vegan. The asparagus cream sauce was light yet robust in flavors and when scooped up with the dumpling, it was the perfect explosion in my mouth. I ordered the Pennette. This is also on the regular menu. Tomato sauce and penne mixed with sweet peppers onions and Gardien Sausage. Yes....talk about comfort in a bowl. The generous helping was delicious and was definitely what I expected (if not better!).   For our main, we shared a \"Chicken\" Marsala. A Gardein chicken breast that was baked and spiced was the main attraction on the plate. On top of it was a creamy, woody, mushroom (oyster) sauce that covered the chicken. Surrounding the \"chicken\" were billowy gnocchi that were smooth, simple and complemented the bold flavors of the sauce and chicken. Considering I've never had the opportunity to have a Marsala sauce since it's usually served with chicken, I take this first taste as being an exquisite experience.   For the finale to the meal, we shared a Campari and citrus sorbet. Presented beautifully, it was a light ending to a perfect meal.  I don't really have to elaborate much about the ambiance and the service. This is the Encore and there was perfection executed all over. My favorite Italian experience thus far, has been at Aranciata Blu in Rome. Sinatra came so close to that experience that it was scary. I never thought I could enjoy such an ethereal experience just 20 minutes away from home.    Vegan, vegetarian, carnivore, omnivore or whatever palate you have, Sinatra is a well worth-it experience. Oh, and the wine list here is also very impressive.   Sinatra...keep yourself Just The Way You Are....",

The menu was a mix of classic Italian dishes and more modern Italian cuisine as well,  I thought it a nice balance. We ordered appetizers that included meatballs, buratta and antipasti boards.  I felt the apps were good but not outstanding.  The meatballs were not tender and the antipasti a little light on items.  For example it only had one type of cheese and prosciutto.  I like a bit more variety.  The entries were also good but not outstanding.  I had the lasagna.

After waiting about 15 minutes or so for their table, we were seated in their beautiful dining room at one of their large round tables.  People weren't particularly hungry, so we did not over do it by ordering starters and sides.    I started with an excellent caesar's salad.  There wasn't anything unusual about this dish, but that's the way it should be when you order a caesar's salad.  For my main, I went with their Osso bucco.  Again, it seemed like a pretty standard preparation of this dish, but it was expertly done.    All in all, my experience was very good here.  There was nothing inventive or provocative going on here, so if you want classic Italian dishes well executed, Sinatra is the place.  I would expect nothing less from a place with such a name.",

Although, even for the small portions, my family and I were still not able to finish it all.  Leftovers were delicious the 2nd day though!   I definitely do recommend saving room for their dessert.  Had probably one of the best tiramisu's I've ever had in my entire life, and definitely the best gellato ever!  I think hazlenut flavor was my favorite, but they're all amazingly good.  The flavors were powerful and busted inside the mouth with every bite.  Pricing for desserts seemed fair for the type of restaurant this was.  Service was excellent.

Jonathan at the desk seated us, plus recommended wine and cocktails to start our dining adventure.  He chatted with us, before leaving us to peruse the menu.  Then our waiter Roberto came over.  What an awesome waiter he was!  He took the time to tell us the specials, and when I asked him what his favorite things on the menu were, he didn't disappoint.  We started with the caprese salad (the man), and beef carpaccio (me).  Wow, wow, wow.  My beef was incredible.    For entrees we had the 10oz filet (the man), and the agnoletti (me).  Roberto said his favorite was the agnoletti, and that choice was perfect.  Perfectly cooked, perfectly seasoned, perfect pairing between the buffalo mozzerella, pasta and sauce.  Gosh.    Finally for dessert we had the seasonal crostini, and the lollipops.  Both were so good!  Excellent meal, we will definitely be back!",

If the do carry the wine, don't bring it.  Second, Mr Snooty Wynn will only allow you to bring two bottles of wine in no matter the size of your party.  The managers would only say \"This is Mr Wynns rule.\"   Not the friendliest of staff and managers ... we got up and headed to another restaurant that did not have Mr Wynn Rules ... sad.  Apparently the Wynn is doing just fine!",

We have eaten at several Michelin rated restaurants including Guy Savoy here in Vegas and Sinatra was at that level.  We love Scarpetta and I would choose Sinatra without question.   The apps were delicious and the Caprese and Caesar were up with my all time favorites.  I consider myself a lasagna and chicken parm expert.  The best lasagna ever was in little Italy NY and at Sinatra it was a solid B+.  The chicken parm (not on the menu) was an A for sure.   The service, wine list, ambiance and general ease of use make this an overall amazing experience.  The best Italian I have ever eaten was at the now closed Parma Ristorante here in Vegas.  This will be our new Italian go to when we are here.  Well done Sinatra.",

I ordered the same dish as last time, VEAL PARM with the BONE! Frickin' gorgeous!  It is the best VEAL PARM I have ever had and I'm 53! (Thats a lot of veal parms to compare it to) I had to stop eating when I got so full. It is a la carte meaning no side of pasta (weird huh?) So I asked for a side of pasta(it came out in a tint 8 oz copper cup for $12 !!!) OUCH!! yes, the veal parm was $52, but WORTH every $$ The cappuccino was one of the best I have ever had too! (And I have been all over ITALY several times) Then the dessert which was FRANK's Chocolate Fedora was the final ending to a perfect meal. EXCELLENT service too! (we went on a saturday night @ 6pm)  I highly recommend this place....",

Very little meat and no cheese.   Basically I paid big bucks for some sauce on mushy noodles.  We sent the asparagus back.   It was tough and not seasoned.    To be fair, one of our diners liked her pasta dish, but confirmed it was short on sausage.   Our other diner got the chicken and said it was ok.   Considering the prices, one should expect more.    Service was fine.  Our table in back room was very close to the other tables in back room.   But we did call just an hour before we wanted to eat.",

Sinatra is a beautiful restaurant, dedicated to Frank Sinatra as the name said it. The music was nice, the place is elegant, classic, and intimate.        We had our team dinner here, 12 of us, everyone was hungry and we ordered just about everything on the menu.  - Caprese mozzarella di bufala, heirloom tomatoes, red onion, basil - classic and good.  - Prosciutto - Parma prosciutto, caramelized Bartlett pears, Parmigiana Reggiano - nice presentation.  - Polpettine housemade meatballs, polenta fries - this was good.  - Insalatina dell' Imperatore n\"Caesar Salad\" anchovy, Parmesan crisp - such a smal portion, and I don't even like big portion, but this was meh.  - Lasagna Bolognese - fresh pasta layered with veal, pork and beef ragu - this was tasty.  - Risotto with lobster - this was quite nice and perfectly creamy.   - Veal Parmigiana thinly pounded veal chop, melted mozzarella, pomodoro sauce - this was an impressive side, gigantic, but it wasn't that tasty as I was hoping for.   - The Rib Eye - we ordered medium rare, it was medium. The second order came out was over cooked again, disappointed.         The wine list was dominantly Italian, very reasonable, good selection of Chianti, Barolo, Barbaresco, and Super Tuscan. Our sommelier did an amazing job to get us our wines the Nebbiolo and Barbaresco.          Our server was so busy with other table that we had to flag him down a few times. I understand that it was CES 2014, but still as a caliber of this restaurant, we expect a higher par.",

We thought this would be best experience of trip. They offered free coffee or dessert but we passed when we complained to waiter he had brought over the manager. It was just edible but ragu or prego a billion times better. We enjoyed joes steak at forum shops & Giada brunch Saturday at Cromwell. Well worth the prices there. We won't be back to sinatras unfortunately. Cocktails good. Free bread basket.",

She was so pleasant. The ambiance...lighting....colors... was delightful, so different from the crowded noisy dinner we had last night at Lago.  A shout out to our waiter Tim for his excellent service.  He was always around when we needed him and helpful with our food choices.  Food was excellent from start to finish....a unique assortment of four kinds of bread was unexpected.  Our meatball appetizer an shrimp appetizer both were beautifully presented and more importantly delicious.  We ordered two entrees and one side dish planning to take some out with us and guess what....the only bad part of the evening....we forgot to take them!!!   Less on the hips is the only positive about that. The tomato sauce tasted like the sauce my Italian grandmother taught me how to make. Dessert also exceptional, especially the creamy tiramisu. Our visit ended with Amber again wishing us a good evening....and Sinatra's made our anniversary even more special. Our compliments to all of you.  We hope to return soon. We have eaten in many of the fine dining restaurants in the hotels and Sinatra's has risen to the top of the list.",

    "text": "\"My kind of joint, Sinatra is... My kind of place....\".  Pardon the pseudo-joke, but truly, if you like Italian food, this is your kind of place. If you like Frankie's music, this is your kind of place. And if you like BOTH Italian food AND Sinatra's music, this is a not-to-be-missed stop while in Vegas.   Our party of three loves both. So we were fascinated with the Sinatra and authentic Rat Pack items on display at the restaurant entrance (intimate correspondance between Frank and Sammy, Frank and Wynn, and others, along with some of his many awards). We were seated promptly and given a window table overlooking the terrasse and outdoor fireplaces. It was a beautiful table, and the whole restaurant is elegant and understated - except for the humongous portrait of The Chairman dominating the main wall!   Our waiter was superb, catering to my very-particular parents. My father wanted a basic pasta dish not on the menu; he was told sure! No problem, the chef can whip that up. Al dente, perfectly cooked, just as my dad liked it (he is hard to please). The waiter overheard my mother and I saying how we weren't sure we could finish a whole dish and he said he could gladly order us half portions of anything we liked. Wow, that was fantastic! It totally fit the bill! I ordered Sinatra's pasta with clams, and it was light and flavorful and the perfect portion. I forget what my mother had, but she loved it.  I opted for just some coffee after the meal, but my folks had the creme brullee and the various scoops of gelato, the latter which was plated beautifully. They also put a few chocolates on the table, which was a lovely touch. We talked well into the next day about how lovely our dinner was here. Truly, a wonderful meal.",

Extremely wonderful service from the moment we stepped in to the moment we had to run out so we wouldn't be late for our show.   The drinks were delicious. My lemon drop was made exactly how I like it...on the sweeter side... And the house wine was wonderful (pinot).   We were given an assortment of bread that included sourdough, raisin, baked Parmesan and real bread \"sticks\". Also, we were given two spreadable mini cups of deliciousness. One was salted (delicious) butter and the other was a puree of yumminess...I can't remember, but I'm picky and it was fabulous.   The Caesar is a real Caesar salad. Anchovies and full cuts of lettuce perfectly dressed with delicious large croutons. I was in Caesar salad heaven.   My mom and I each got the lobster tail over el dente risotto with mushrooms and asparagus. Do I even need to go on...every ounce of the main course was amazing. I savored every bite.   Next time, we would like to order an espresso with a dessert...we just did not have the time :(  We realized we were cutting it extremely close to our 7pm showtime and unfortunately had to run like bandits. The server was quick to bring us our bill and a plate of goodies I wanted to dump in my purse...but that's not classy. ;)   We knew where we were dining and decided not to worry about the prices. It was expensive, yes, but worth every single penny.   If I could give it 10 stars, I would.",

I got vegan bread with vegan butter and cannellini beans spread. I got a complimentary beet salad amuse bouche.

Limited knowledge of staff, including the sommelier, on the offering of spirits (neither the waiter nor sommelier knew what kinds if bourbon they had, nor describe what limited offerings they did have.) Half of our group of 8 did not like the food. My Milanese tasted like Olive Garden; my friend could not finish his 16 oz NY Strip, because it tasted bad; another friend find the fish dry, and others said it was \"just ok\".  Do yourself a favor. Look elsewhere.",

Very generous servings! For the main course, my wife had the scallops (amazing) and I had the spaghetti with clams (also amazing). Definitely a splurge but 100% worth it! Great ambience filled with Sinatra music and orange tablecloths (Sinatra's favorite color). Would definitely eat there again!",

The staff throughout the restaurant places a huge emphasis on customer service and it really shows by the way they treat you. We received excellent service throughout our dining experience. The menu features all your favorite Italian dishes with a few items coming from Sinatra's family recipes. We usually start off with the meatballs as an app and you'll also receive an amazing assortment of bread shortly after sitting down. Two of the more popular dishes, and two items we frequently order, are the veal Parmesan and lasagna...they are out of this world delicious! The portions are all a really good size as well so you won't be going home hungry. They have a great wine list and a creative cocktail selection. My favorite cocktail was the Sinatra Smash, a light whiskey drink with a good flair. Their dessert is also incredible and I would highly recommend ordering their cheesecake. The taste is unbelievable! I can't say enough good things about this restaurant. Everyone really goes above and beyond to ensure a great dining experience!",

The meat was not tender at all, elastic taste, and I still wait to see the peppercorn jack daniels sauce, invisible!!! The meat was the cheapest one you can find on the market, not Angus, not prime and this for $61 without the side. See photo on my post  3) the side, well there special potato's is like chips, but no potato, just the skin with almost no Parmesan. Photo in the post!  4) the desert size is really rediculous, $14 for a panacota, 1 raspberry and 1 strawberry cut in 4 pces. Of course they are not organic at all, the cheapest quality you can find.  5) wine is really over priced, ok I understand restaurant need to make money on it, but for a bottle that you can find for $9 in the market, they sale you the glass for $23 !!! That's insane! With a bottle you serve 7 glass, just make the math...  In conclusion: overpriced, horrible quality, don't want woman with nice dress, bad chef!  For the Encore hotel, we are expecting a much better place, quality and service!  Just a quick update, the customer service ask me for my phone number, something I did provide them, but of course, it's the Encore, so not even an apology no a phone call, nothing at all !! Not sure it can be worst, this is the conclusion for one of the worst restaurant in Vegas!",

The food was outstanding.  The menu?  It was nearly impossible to choose from all the selections!    I had a steak with a side of pasta, after starting with some various appetizers.  We enjoyed some bottles of wine, and the server never let our glasses go dry!  I love the Sinatra/Rat Pack vibe and the old Ocean's 11 movie playing in the bar area.  The bartenders and servers are very nice and knowledgeable about the wines, beers, and cocktails.  Note, the bar area is smaller, so sometimes it can overflow if it is busy.  This is an old school type of restaurant.  I enjoyed it thoroughly...and made a reservation for next month when I come back!  5 stars!",

When my wife my cold they also brought her a Pashmina which was nice.   Food- We started with a seasonal White Truffle over home made Fettuccini then for dinner had the Chicken Parm and the Wagyu Gnocchi. Finished up with the Cannoli. The Chicken Parm was ok, everything else was amazing. The Gnocchi pasta dish was one of the best I've ever had.   Service- Absolutely outstanding, our server Pedro was fantastic as were all of the other staff members that took care of us.   Some of our other food stops at the Wynn were less than fantastic so we we were really pleased to have such an amazing meal and service, it was the highlight of our trip for sure. We also ate at the other Italian restaurant on property Allegro and Sinatra blew that place out of the water.",

For the staff I would give the highest score!  I have 4 star because the menu has not changed much from 2015 and some items that I ordered was just good but not spectacular.  However, I was impressed with the addition of the separate vegan menu!  Anyway, I will come back here and totally recommending to try this place for its ambience, truffles and signature cocktails- Sinatra splash ;)  Enjoy!",

We shared a truffle pasta to start and then Kathy had grilled Bronzinio on fresh spring veggies. I had a veal Oscar and both were outstanding.   It was a wonderful evening and meal. We enjoyed every minute and will definitely go back the next time we are in Las Vegas.",

    "text": "What happened here., Vegas locals who won't be back.  Planned a dinner evening with my wife and two friends. I explained over the phone we have two vegetarians in the group and we were celebrating an occasion. They actually made it a point to ask me too which I thought was really great.  When we got there on time, we waited a a few minutes and then got seated in reasonable time. That's where it started to go down hill.  First problem: Inattentive staff. They took way too much time actually getting our orders in. Plenty of people standing around literally 3 feet from us. And we are looking right at them. Likely unnecessary managers - who do very little. Fire them, and hire more waitstaff. No one was helping us out. Our waiter was busy running around to other tables. We patiently waited and even asked the server who put the bread down and he sternly replies the waiter would be right with us. I should have got up and left right there. I can't stand restaurants where others don't help you out. It shows lack of leadership and teamwork.  Second problem: We explained multiple times we had vegetarians, but no one offered us a vegetarian or vegan menu. We figured there were literally only a few dishes for us as a result. Both the vegetarians ordered appetizers, and walked out hungry. Turns out there was a vegan menu. The couple next to us received it right when they sat down.  Third problem: The food is just not worth it ($65 appetizer which was average at best and can be found at the Noodle Company) and the atmosphere is frankly, worse than the Cheesecake Factory. Absolutely nothing unique or exclusive about it aside from Sinatra's awards on the wall.  Two stars because once food was actually ordered it was brought out quickly. And the complimentary\" bread and Sinatra Smash were probably the most unique and worthwhile parts of the entire evening. Just not sure they were worth the $300+ final bill. (Yes, we left the customary tip. Although we probably shouldn't have.)  Disappointed. Be better. A lot better.",

I have done reports on him and the rat pack in school and even had my father daughter dance at my wedding to \"fly me to the moon\"  So me going to this restaurant is an absolute must, Anytime I can possibly get there.   What I love is the story behind the restaurant and the amazing friendship that Steve Wynn (owner of the casino where Sinatra is located) and Frank Sinatra have had over the years. That's something you can feel as soon as you walk into the restaurant.   On display you'll find some of Frank's most amazing awards such as a Grammy, and Oscar and an Emmy.  Those are things that to me just make you feel like your dining in Franks home.   Now for the food!  Couldn't ask for anything better OMG.  I had the chicken parm and it's always cooked to perfection with the perfect ratio of melted cheese and tomato sauce.   My mom has the short rib pasta and it was so so tasty.   Our appetizer was the polenta fries and meatballs and it reminds me SO much of the kind my granny used to make for us after school.   Our desserts where amazing...we had the chocolate mouse cake that is in the shape of franks famous fadora hat and the most amazing pistachio gelato.    They have a signature drink called the 'Sinatra Smash' and I will tell you it is smashing...  It's made with muddled blackberries and jack daniels whiskey,(franks favorite) and after one or two you'll be flying yourself to the moon!   Excellent place for family's and excellent service   Expensive yes. But you must visit at least once.",

    "text": "Of all the fine dining restaurants at the Wynn and Encore, this is my favorite. My husband and I are regulars here and my husband always requests his favorite booth/table number all the time.   Food- hands down, the best veal parmigiana in town. They also have excellent cioppino and lasagna. All their pasta is made fresh and hand made everyday. Love love their home made handmade fresh pasta! Sinatra also had the best branzino in town. I'm not kidding. But recently they changed their branzino recipe (not a fan of the red pepper emulsion). I wish they would change it back to the old recipe.   Service- service is excellent! We've had a few servers assigned to our favorite booth every time and all of them are extraordinary! There's this blond lady. She's a firecracker. I love how she's so detailed in explaining the menu. She's the one that told me they hand make their pasta at the back everyday! The most recent one was Thomas. He served us during Christmas Eve when I dined with my husband and son. During Christmas Eve, I ordered my usual branzino. I have always said Sinatras got the best branzino I've ever tasted. But I found out they changed the recipe, so I tried it and gave it a chance. It was not the same. I didn't like the red pepper emulsion they added. I was a little bit disappointed. (I've attached a photo of the old branzino and the new branzino). So Thomas was so quick and suggested the scallops. My food was replaced right away- within 2 minutes while my husband and son were still eating. That was pretty impressive.   Sommelier- our favorite sommelier is Patrick. He knows the white wine we like and the most recent one he gave us was a white wine from Spain. Excellent! Patrick knows our taste. I've attached a photo of the most recent wine he has been serving us.",

We managed to reserve a table for Christmas dinner itself only a few days in advance while we visited the Strip for the second time, can you believe that? Once we got in, what happened next can only be described as The Best dining experience of my life.  Our service was exceptional. I forget our server's name at the time, but I could have sworn he came off like a renowned radio host with years of experience based on how personable and knowledgeable he was with us. The steak I ordered was absolutely cooked to perfection. I caught myself drooling slightly just recalling how succulent it truly was. Their signature drink I ordered, the Sinatra Smash, was by far the best cocktail I've ever had to date. It was perfectly mixed and made in every sense I can think of.  Most of all, I adored this place since it was everything a Sinatra fan like myself could ever ask for. The setting, the music and decor pays a True homage to Ol' Blue Eyes you'd be hard pressed to find anywhere else in the world. You owe it to yourself to experience this magnificent, high-end restaurant even once in your lifetime.",

However if you go on vacation / business retreat with your own comfort in mind, you should probably go else where. The staff is rude and dismissive.  They have a total lack of class and interaction skills.  When we made reservations for this restaurant, they stated that they require collared shirts and nothing further.  However when we made it to the front, we were immediately refused service as my son had Tommy Bahamas shorts and a Burberry Polo (Imagine that....it was 119 degrees this past weekend).  The so-call restaurant manager had come out the front reception area, and stated that he would need to check with the hotel's senior management (Really....Over a 7 Year old?) if this could be permitted.  The manager walked behind a door behind reception, but I could see his refection in the glass, he just stood there and looked at his watch.  Five minutes later he stated that he could do nothing and he hated to loose out business but this came down from the top...no shorts for your 7 year old.  Mind you at this same time a lady in a tank mini dress made her way on in.  The manager told us that this was our fault and that his staff reads the reservations requirements from a script.  As they were on speaker phone when the reservations were made and not one of our company staff members heard this we are calling a spade a spade.  We had informed the hotel management of the situation, and they responded by telling (I think his last name was Fox), are you calling our hotel staff liars?....seriously!  These actions occurred in front of our office staff and was so classless we barely could put together words to articulate just how poorly restaurant acted.   These guys are the worst....and the fact that they are so willing to play games over something so petty is beyond reason.  Steve Wynn needs to restaff. Bottom line, I don't know how good the food is, but I would sooner recommend seeing the soup Nazi!  MAKE A STATEMENT TO THE WYNN AND DO NOT PUT UP WITH THIS GARBAGE!",

I wore a dress and my husband wore a suit to honor Frank by being dapper. Overall, people were dressed quite nice although he was the only one with a suit jacket on. Just don't wear short and sandals (duh!).   I thought the restaurant was gorgeous! It was dramatic without being too overly done up like other parts of Encore and Wynn. The chairs were comfortable and we had a nice view. And of course the music was great. :-)   Our waiter was amazing and there was a sommelier on hand.   We started with a special appetizer of fettuccine in truffle butter sauce with a huge serving of fresh shaved black truffle on top. It was like a little bit of heaven in my mouth. I had agnolotti (ricotta filled pasta) with spinach sauce which was lovely. But the real star of the show was my husband's tagliata (rib-eye). It was the best steak of the week (and we had many steaks at many steak places). My dinner was really good, but his was amazing.   I would definitely recommend Sinatra and I would recommend the rib eye!",

Sinatra is tucked into the last little corner of Encore. In fact on our last Vegas trip we simply happened upon it while walking through the casino.    As you enter the restaurant classic photos line the wall to greet you and a case holding some of his most prestigious awards mirrors the host's podium. We were seated at an elegant corner booth, serenaded by Mr. S.  We started with a cocktail, I had a light and sweet Bellini, Jacob his normal Knob Creek on the rocks. We began dinner with a caprese salad, the variety of tomatoes were sweet and flavorful especially for February.  The buffalo mozzarella was creamy and incredibly fresh, it was a perfect beginning.   For our entrees I had the lobster chanterelle mushroom risotto, so earthy, delicate, and creamy. The lobster was rich and succulent. Jacob had the classic Italian Lasagna Bolognese, with hand made pasta sheets and a veal, pork and beef Bolognese sauce. Everything tasted incredible and the quality was phenomenal.   Finally for dessert we choose the Torta di Ricotta, a cannoli flavored cheesecake with a side of pistachio gelato, a perfect light ending to our elegant meal. I definitely have \"High Hopes\" for out next visit to Sinatra.",

We knew going in that it would be somewhat expensive and I think between my girlfriend and I our check was about 135 with dessert.  We were in a group of 12 or so, and maybe that added to our time while waiting for food but it took about 40 minutes for our food to come out.  My other issue was its very hard not to leave hungry.  I got the chicken parmigiana which was pretty good. (Seriously, why the hell do I order an entree I can get at Chili's for 10 bucks when they have better things on the menu? I have no idea.) But Sinatra's portion was very small.  We had to go eat less than 2 hours later because we were still hungry. If you have the time and aren't terribly hungry, Sinatra is probably worth a try.",

My mom came with us to celebrate her birthday.  We were greeted and given a handwritten card wishing us Happy Anniversary.  Everyone is right when they say the surroundings are elegant and Frank's music serenades you.  My mom and I had decided to split the butternut squash ravioli.  We had been out at several restaurants where the servings had been large so we thought it would be a great way to try a dish and save room for dessert.    Our waiter was not personable and fairly aloof. He didn't make suggestions on food or wine and just shortly answered our questions.  Like a previous reviewer, we felt overlooked.  The restaurant was not busy for a Monday night and we observed three managers moving among the tables.  Not one came over to greet us or ask how we were.  I ordered a glass of wine and Pasta Fagoli soup which I would describe as watery broth with beans, tomatoes and pasta. Just not much taste to it.  We received our main entrees and I looked down to see that our split meal consisted of about 4-5 small ravioli for myself and my mom. I mean they were small.  My husband's lobster risotto tasted great and he shared with us. The ravioli was average and nothing to write home about.  Not once did our waiter return to ask how our meal was or if I wanted another glass of wine.  I'm not one to complain but I know when people take a genuine interest in you being in there restaurant.  Our dirty dishes sat in front of us for over 20 minutes as various staff walked by. We finally stopped someone to remove our plates.  Our waiter showed more interest in the large table nearby and finally came over to ask about dessert.  I wasn't asking for a free dessert for our anniversary but like another reviewer said, we had eaten at Botero (another Encore restaurant) and had received better service plus a cute dessert for our anniversary.  Our tiramisu at Sinatra's was good and standard.  Nothing extraordinary.  Our waiter never came over again to inquire if we wanted anything else.  I was mostly sad as I had wanted a special night for us.  A little warmth and personality goes a long way towards good customer services.  With being laid off recently, I could have spent more, but $200 for a mediocre evening was not what I had envisioned.",

    "text": "We went for my friend's birthday.  I made reservations online and said we'd be celebrating a birthday.  When we arrived, there was a happy birthday card waiting at our table - very nice touch!  We ordered drinks before dinner - my friend and her mom had the Sinatra Smash and really enjoyed it.  I had the raspberry limoncello lemon drop - amazing!  Our waiter, Eric, was fantastic.  He gave good recommendations and didn't lead us wrong.  We had 2 entrees - the chicken parmagiana and the lasagna.  The portions on the chicken parm was enough for 2 people.  Our waiter recommended we order a side of pasta because the chicken doesn't come with it.  The sauce on the pasta was flavorful, but there was so much chicken we really didn't need extra food to go with it.  My friend said the lasagna was the best she ever had.  After dinner they brought a free birthday dessert.  It was very pretty, but tasted absolutely horrible because there was coffee-flavored cake layered throughout and it was bitter and we couldn't eat it.  That's the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars.  Well, that, and it was rather pricy, but when you're dining on the strip, everything is pricy.  We would definitely go again.",

    "text": "We do very very few five star reviews. Everything -- service/food/atmosphere--has to be spot-on perfect.  And this particular evening at Sinatra was just that. \"To me, this is magic,\" said my Dad, a rabid Sinatra fan, who requested we dine here for a special dinner during his visit this weekend. He loves good food but isn't really a foodie per se, so we don't do many fine dining meals when it's just him and Mom isn't with us. So, I confess  -- although I love Wynn and Encore-- I was a tiny bit skeptical about his choice since we hadn't planned on a really elaborate dinner during this visit. Although I'd met the chef -- the brilliant and charming Theo Schoenegger -- and knew he was extraordinary I was concerned the menu items might a bit rich and heavy for my current palate/diet. I was also concerned it would be crazy expensive, and Dad insisted on treating.  I'm thrilled to report I was dead wrong! We had an amazing evening and ordered from the special summer menu (3 courses for $69) We even found a fabulous bottle of wine for under $40 - which was a pleasant surprise. (Loved Drew, the wine manager!) Dina, our server, has been there since the restaurant opened and she made our dining experience incredibly enjoyable - perfectly paced. She was very accommodating to a couple of special requests I had, such as ordering sauces/dressings on the side for my fish and salad. The bread basket was a standout.  I rarely do bread, but the cheese breadsticks were particularly amazing. Dad opted for the Osso Bucco, a caprese salad and panna cotta with fruit for his dessert. He said the veal was the best he's ever had. Husband ordered a filet, a crab appetizer salad and tiramasu for dessert. All outstanding. He's not even a mashed potato fan but loved the potatoes served with his steak. I had the fish special with asparagus, sauce on the side, and a salad appetizer. All awesome. For dessert I opted for the coconut sorbet with fruit from the vegan menu. The atmosphere is incredible and special props to the resort's design team, too. (Roger Thomas is brilliant - I'm assuming he was involved!) The restaurant is beautifully designed with comfortable chairs and stunning color combinations, along with high ceilings.  The temperature inside the restaurant is perfect! I wore a sleeveless dress and was comfortable throughout our meal -- and I'm often freezing. And the Frank Sinatra music playing throughout the evening was a lovely treat. Just the right volume.  Also - there's a lovely restroom immediately outside the restaurant. (I'm far from lazy but can't stand going to a nice restaurant and having to venture far into the casino to find the ladies room)  Our busser, Jorge, was delightful, too.  On our way to the restaurant I called with a question about parking -- I wanted to self park and wanted to park somewhat close so I didn't have to walk too far in my ridiculously high heels. I was wowed that one of the hotel operators checked with the restaurant to get my number and made a special effort to call me back and advised me on where to park.  That's Wynn/Encore caliber service.",

The beef carpaccio is perfectly seasoned with salt and olive oil with fresh arugula on top. The polpitine made fresh with great flavor. The aglonotti is out of this world with savory ricotta and a silky smooth asparagus sauce. The Franks clams is great combination of pasta and fresh manila clams that you will soak up the sauce and leave the dish clean. For entrees you can't go wrong the halibut is a nice large pieces cooked to perfection and the lobster risotto is just savory and out of this world. Of course I am still a kid at heart so I usually go with the the chicken parm which has huge portions with a fresh sauce not too bulky and chicken itself is just as fresh as it gets. Few more then I'll be done. Osso buco just falls off the bone with another well cooked risotto. The pollo which is like their version of a chicken Marsala is rich and complimented well with gnocchi. Can't go wrong with any of the desserts and Sinatra Smash as a cocktail. Service is phenomenal and the atmosphere is the a amazing blend of upbeat and relaxed. To say the least it is the best.",

We had an 830 reservation and thankfully nobody made a fuss when we were a few mins later. We were given a beautiful corner table and our server Larry right away to say congratulations and take our drink order. I got the chicken parm, my new husband ordered the filet. Both were fantastic. I think his might have been better. The peppercorn gravy on the steak was to die for.   They made us a special dessert. Panna cotta with fresh fresh and I believe a raspberry sauce. It was the perfect light dessert after a filling dinner.   I'm a huge Frank Sinatra fan so naturally I would love to be somewhere that has Frank's pics on the walls, Oscar on display up front, music heard throughout and his movies being shown in the bar!   The people here really go out of their way to make you feel special and to make a special night even better.",

Beet Salad Scallop Entree New York Strip Polenta Fries with Parmesan Tiramisu  Ricotta Lollipops  The Bruschetta is not on the menu. The server, after hearing my husband ask me if it was on the menu (he didn't know what it was called), stated that he would ask the chef to prepare it. It was a delicious treat.   I cannot remember exactly what it was called but I got the salad with lump crab meat and avocado. It was outstanding. I want to go back just to have it again. Additionally I tried the beet salad. It was perfectly dressed and fantastic.   I ordered the New York Strip Medium and, while the steak was good, it was a little too charred for my taste. I ordered the polenta fries for my side. Sprinkled with parmesan, they were very tasty.   Dessert stole the show! We had the Ricotta Lollipops. They were so good. The Ricotta cheese on the inside was sweet and creamy. The crust on the outside was chocolate with little crunchy crispies. These were to die for. Additionally, we had the Tiramisu. I'm not the biggest fan of this dish but it was very good here. The cake was very moist and the coffee flavor was not too overbearing.   The ambiance in this place is elegant but  cool. It seems like a place that Mr. Sinatra would have hung out in with his friends. We came 5 days before Christmas and got to listen to Christmas carols, Sinatra style, so that was a treat.   All in all excellent food, great service, cool vibe. I can't wait to return!",

Secondly, we didn't not plan on having dessert because we were full, but the waiter dropped the menu and asked me to pick something out for our anniversary.

Ordered the penne with sausage &peppers, and a Caesar salad also a Campari martini. S.o. Ordered a Caesar salad as well and the lasagna. The server was warm yet professional, and accommodated us politely. ( I have a very thirsty companion and prefer to not have onion anywhere in my food).   I'm not a pasta fan but the pastas both were punchy with Classic Italian flavors, were perfectly cooked and heated. The bread basket had a nice mix of items. I'd def go back if we revisit Vegas again.",

The service is nothing less than what you expect at the Wynn, impeccable. I had clams and pasta and my husband had the osso buco. My dinner was good, but his was amazing! This is a quite upscale restaurant, so you may want to leave the kids at home, but as a date place, it was awesome!",

    "text": "We haven't been back to Sinatra's for over 5 years and it was worth the wait!  I've read that some feel it is over priced.  My opinion is that the price reflects the outstandingly superb experience one receives here. You are treated like royalty from the moment you step inside, to the moment you leave. Beautiful hostesses greet you and seat you. Our waiter, Thomas, was quick, charming, and offered to get the sommelier for my wine-related questions. He explained all specials and dishes, made recommendations when my husband asked, and was on point to refill wine glasses. The other waitstaff were unobtrusive in timely water refills and other activities. After each meal Thomas cleaned our table of crumbs. NOW LETS GET TO THE FOOD . We ordered appetizers of polpettines (meatballs) with polenta fries.  Best. Meatballs. Ever. (And my Italian dad made the best.).  And we ordered the polipo octopus salad with a dash of capers. My husband kept oooo-ing and ahhh-ING over this.  I had the penne sausage ragu, and husband had double porkchop pan-seared and lived the hint of wasabi and superb mashed potatoes.  The final dishes, dessert, were Pana cotta and ricotta cheese cake. Mind. Blowing.   So... If you want cheap, non-personalized service, don't come here.  However, If you want a total experience of joy - make reservations and wear appropriate dress.  It's soooo worth it!",

Our dinner ran 3 hrs 15 minutes and that was with the fact that I told the waitress we were short on time.  Then there were only 3 bottles of Cabernet under $100 and those at $95.  My Osso Bucco was over-cooked and dry while the risotto was undercooked. The gnocchi portions were small. Others enjoyed a great steak and the salads were great.  As business travelers they kind of just own you as you don't have many places to go that are great but reasonable. Next time we will trouble and get a cab for an off-sight spot.",

    "text": "Took a four day trip to Las Vegas and had reservations at Sinatra. So far this was the best restaraunt we have been to at the Wynn/Encore complex. Very nice ambiance and of course music by Frank and others of the same style. They started out by bringing us a shot of a tomato drink that was a great way to start the meal. I cannot remember what it was called, but it was good.  My wife and I started out with cocktails and an appetizer of palenta fires and meatballs. This dish was better than I had hoped and the only problem was that I wanted more. They also brought us a selection of fresh breads with garlic butter spread.  We skipped having a salad and went for the main course. My wife had the Milanese which is a thin pounded veal chop which was cooked to perfection. It had a nice crunchy crust with a topping of mozzarella with greens layed over the top of the chop and then had balsmic drissled on top. There was also a lemon wedge  which added some nice citrus flavor to the dish.  I had the Ossobuco My Way and it was off the charts. A very tender braised veal shank on a bed of saffron risotto. Great flavor with meat that broke apart with your fork and risotto that was cooked to perfection.  We also had a side of Risotto Primivera (you can never have enough risotto). This was prepared with asparagus, peas, morel mushrooms and parmesean cheese. Again, the dish was prepared perfectly. With diner I also added a glass of Barolo which topped off the meal.   For dessert my wife had the canolis that was served with fresh berries and I had a chocolate hazelnut lava cake that was fantastic.  The server was polite and knowledgeable but was lacking in the personallity department. Overall a fantastic night at a fantastic restaurant. A good value for this type of dining. Less expensive than other restaurants of the same caliber in Las Vegas (just over $300 with tip) and every bit as good or better. A definite recommend!",

The veal came with nothing but the BIG 'ol veal meat on a long piece of bone. Seriously it is so big 3 people can share this (14oz). I shared this with my husband and it was still plenty. This was nothing close to what I imagined and drooled for. It was kind of hard to cut through and not soft at all when biting. It was hard to chew into. Thank god for the side of mashed potatoes I got.  The rest of the things I tried was nothing specially made. We got the Caesar salad, the branding which was good, and some seafood plate with random pieces of seafood.",

    "text": "Opened in the earliest days of 2009 it seems hard to believe that Sinatra has been serving guests at Encore for over a decade, yet despite the recent closures of Portofino, Fiamma and Masso Osteria the Italian Restaurant dedicated to Old Blue Eyes quietly marches on with a Thursday during Vegas' typically-slow summer finding the space nearly full around 7:00pm.  Now under the guidance of Chef Luke Palladino since November of 2017, his tenure at short-lived Salute a return to Las Vegas after time in Atlantic City as well as Pennsylvania, longtime locals may remember Palladino as the opening Chef at Onda inside the Mirage and with training both there as well as Italy the Chef's resume checks all the boxes for Food that carefully bridges American Red Sauce to handmade Pastas dressed as they may be in Tuscany.  Recently hiring Joe Marsco, the former General Manager at Andre's returning to the upscale environs in which he has previously shined, it is passing by several murals of Frank and the Rat Pack that guests are led to linen-clad tables, Wynn's Golf Course hidden behind shrubbery outside and the room itself given an air of grandiosity while a collection of its namesake's hits play overhead.  Not an overly long menu, just some of Sinatra's favorites alongside Appetizers, Pastas and Sides prepared from quality ingredients, it was with two guests poured Wine that Chef Palladino appeared porting his nightly amuse, three Squash Blossoms delicately fried around a creamy Cheese center and brightened by Red Pepper Cream.  Next taking a look at Bread service, four styles baked in-house highlighted by laminated coils of Brioche as well as salty Olive Twists, it was not long before primi arrived in the form of portioned Pastas and Rice technically sold as a side-dish, the latter highlighting early summer with Herbs and earth on a creamy background while Caramelle that tastes like Beef Stew inside dainty packages outperformed Agnolotti that were undercooked with Noodles also a bit too thick.  Unimpressed by $20 Meatballs, the orbs over-worked and Sauce skimpy though fried lengths of Polenta were excellent, it was onward to entrees at Strip-prices that dinner proceeded, Halibut bathed in Saffron and poignant Licorice notes getting a little lost while plate-size Veal Parm for $62 and fork-tender Ossobuco \"My Way\" both throw their hat into the conversation for best in The Valley.   Speaking of Hats, or more specifically the Trilby, it is in the form of Frank's iconic lid that guests often finish the evening, soft Chocolate Mousse pairing well to Ice Cream spiked with Whiskey while Harry's beautiful Berries are featured prominently inside a textbook Crostata and alongside filled-to-order Cannolis that even natives of Sicily will likely find impressive.  THREE AND A HALF STARS:  With several Italian Restaurants closing across Las Vegas in recent years, amongst them Portofino, Fiamma and Masso Osteria, Sinatra at Wynn marches on despite very little press, though dinner on Thursday leads one to wonder why as Luke Palladino's Food is very good while the service staff including Joe Marsco does a marvelous job keeping up with the large crowds readily willing to pay Strip prices.",

Bringing me \"tastes\" of things I didn't order or want...again weird. Meatballs lacked EVERYTHING! I told my visitors I would make some and freeze them, send them to New York and they would still be more flavorful. Fish? just shaking my head. God for bit you ask for salt to put real flavor in the food. Wait staff is overwhelming...always at your table with poker faced attitudes.  2 stars = Meh. I've experienced better. as Yelp says.

Noticing this, without conversation about it, the staff brought a pashmina for me to use to keep warm. I've never seen that or experienced that. The thoughtfulness was appreciated and given how inexpensive pashminas can be, it's surprising more restaurants don't keep them on hand for these types of situations.   Our waiter was great. Knowledgeable, prompt, attentive without being too much so.   The food was a bit salty and rich. We started with the meatballs and polenta fries and caprese salad. Both were good. The mozzarella was delicious. We then had the gnocchi and spaghetti bolognese. The gnocchi was ridiculously rich, but the handmade morsels were delicious. Couldn't even eat half. The spaghetti bolognese was great! The bread basket's best item are little round pizzettas. Like a tiny pizza. But so very salty.   Great option if you don't want steak at SW, the buffet, or the Asian food options on campus at the Wynn. Just know everything will be incredibly salty and stock up on water for the next day!",

    "text": "In my stays at the Wynn and Encore, I have partaken of many of their casual and fine dining restaurants. While the fine restaurants are always a top-flight experience, with great service and ambiance, the food quality is at times hit and miss, particularly at the price point. So it was with anticipation and some angst that I chose Sinatra's for Christmas dinner this year, having never dined there previously. I can happily report that the meal and evening were far and away the best that we enjoyed during our stay.  At first impression, the decor and ambiance of the place is fun and inviting, with flourishes such as Frank Sinatra pictures and memorabilia displays, and of course Ol' Blue Eyes himself crooning away in the background with his Rat Pack buddies.  To set the mood better we tried some of the signature cocktails, which were equally appealing to eye and the palate. My husband tried The Dream, a house specialty with champagne, St. Germaine and a hibiscus, which produced a libation that evolved in flavors as it was sipped. I tried the Danny Ocean and the Kings Go Forth, both very tasty with a refreshing citrus flourish.  After a noshing on a light and lovely antipasto and the chef's opening offering of a vegan vegetable soup, I selected the lasagna as my entree. This dish is a veal version that almost defies the traditional concept of lasagna. It was savory while remaining light; not too heavy on sauce or cheese, and just right.  My husband went for the cioppino which was an ample offering of clams, shrimp, lobster and scallops which were bites of heaven. Here again the sauce was full-flavored yet not overpowering. He added a side of eggplant parmesan that was a perfect accompaniment to the meal.  The literal \"cap\" to this lovely evening was dessert, where we enjoyed panna cotta with fresh berries and raspberry sauce and a sculpted miniature chocolate replica of Frank's signature fedora. Finished with a delightful cappucino and it brought the meal to a perfectly harmonic close.  As always at the Wynn, the service is professional and personable without being either fawning or snooty. They always seem to get that right.  We ate at both Mizumi and SW Steakhouse as other alternatives over the weekend and can say without reservation, Sinatra's was the standout. So, if you want to choose a Wynn restaurant to spoil yourself, I would recommend Sinatra's. You will likely pay handsomely at Sinatra's, but you come away feeling like a million dollars!!! :)",

Because that is what going to this place felt like, a delightful time machine trip to the 60's or 70's with all the disgusting orange colors that reminded me of grandma's kitchen.   Cheese and meat board was a delight. Nice way to start off the meal along with some mozzarella and some meatballs.  Got myself the sinatra Smash that was delectable followed by the my way drink which had the best cherry I have tasted in my life.   And then it got bad.  Lasagna was definitely the best part of the meal, the noodles were well cooked the sauce and cheese and meat all mixed together nicely.   Everything else honestly for the price and for having Sinatra's name was pretty lacking in substance and flavor.  Gnocci was cooked well but the sauce wasn't great and kind of ruined it.  Spaghetti and meatballs was... I go back to how hard it is to review Italian, because honestly, it was good but the amount of money you are paying you expect a wow factor. Noodles were undercooked (common theme) the sauce was okay, and the meatball was somehow worse than our appetizer.  Veal Parmagianni was a huge mistake. What a waste of meat. I have had better milnesas (which is what it tasted like) at other less \"affluent\" restaurants.   THE VERDICT: Drinks are out of this world (I can't believe I haven't done a Sinatra based pun yet, I should have done the moon song one right there). But apart from that I can't say I was blown away from anything. I am willing to be high prices for WOW moments. Besides my Sinatra Smash and liquor cherry... I was left wanting.",

    "text": "I have to say, it was because of Sinatra that inspired me to create an account on Yelp and share my passion for this place with the internet world.   First of all, my bias must be clear: I am a huge fan of Frank Sinatra. When I saw Encore had a place dedicated to the Chairman of the Board, I immediately thought, \"I must eat there!\"  The atmosphere didn't disappoint in the slightest. The first thing you see upon walking in is Frank's actual Oscar, Emmy, and Grammy awards (very cool!) as well as some of Steve Wynn's personal memorabilia harkening to the memories he shared with Frank. They have jazz standards on the sound system and old Sinatra movies on a TV over the bar. While I was there, Guys and Dolls was playing and then it switched over to From Here to Eternity. The restaurant is further complimented with giant, wall-sized pictures of Sinatra. So far, the place was definitely living up to my expectations.  What I didn't expect, however, was how good the food would be...  Appetizer: Carpaccio tuna. Light, delicious, almost melted in your mouth. Even if you're not a big fan of sushi, you will enjoy this dish.   Main Course: Chicken Saltimbocca. This was a whole breast of chicken on the bone, with prosciutto baked around it, served on a bed of spinach.  The chicken was juicy and the prosciutto was fantastic. As a side dish I had the gnocchi, which was actually kind of a let down. It was too overdone and as a result was way too soft and mushy.   Dessert: Tiramisu. Probably one of the best exampled of tiramisu I have ever had. Light, airy, and yet filling.   All in all, I had a great time at Sinatra. By the way, the cocktails are superb, so even if you just stop by for a drink you will enjoy yourself. I recommend the Negroni.",

    "text": "Since I'm Yelping everything else I went to in Vegas, why not include Sinatra?  We went last night. They had a nice table for us for two right by the window. Nice. Waiter was friendly and answered any and all questions.  The starter salads were amazing. I had a hearts of romaine salad with gorgonzola, walnuts and grapes. The dressing of olive oil and vinegar was perfect, not too strong and not too light. One of the better salads I've had. Since I've been eating a lot of cow in Vegas I decided on something different here. I had the Lobster Risotto. It was very very good. Normally risotto is topped off with a few bits of lobster (if it's Lobster Risotto obviously). Not here. I had a full half of a lobster with both claws on the risotto. Mixed into the lemony, creamy, peppery risotto with peas it was divine. Add in a nice white wine (a chardonnay if you must know) and it was a stellar meal. I was a bit surprised, honestly, because based on the other reviews I thought it might just be another overpriced Vegas restaurant. From my experience though, and I have had more than a few world class meals, this is an excellent dining experience that should satisfy the pickiest of diners.  Apparently Steve Wynn was buddies with Old Blue Eyes, hence the name of the place. That's a nice tribute and it makes your dining that much more enjoyable if you're a Frank fan (which frankly I'm not but can appreciate the tunes). Enjoy. Oh, one last thing - take out that second mortgage before coming here, it will come in handy. That is also True for most other restaurants in popular places in Vegas though, so no direct criticism here - it would be nice if restaurants lowered prices somewhat to meet the bleakness of the economy but most must still be getting the prices they're asking for, so pony up or go to In-N-Out instead.",

Big poster of Sinatra stares down on you as his laid back music plays. Had to buy a CD of his music after the dinner.",

The service was prompt and the waiter was more than patient as my 2 guys friends and I chatted it up like old New Jersey girlfriends. We got the chicken wrapped in Prosciutto, the Fillet and the Osso Bucco and we were pleased with everything. Perhaps the greatest part of Sinatra though is the bathroom, which has toothbrushes and toothpaste. So if you find yourself alone and destitute in Vegas, as so many of us do, drag your behind to the Sinatra bathroom, it's my favorite bathroom in Vegas.",

In fact, although we ordered a bottle of cab, we pounded  this and took the mostly unfinished bottle with us to the dice tables.  As usual we ordered many appetizers, including octopus affogato, meatballs, and lasagna, which were all pretty good.   We also had mini-raviolis with truffles, which were unbelievable.   I savored every mini one-by-one, slooowly.  The lobster risotto was the best i have ever had.  In fact we ordered another one when we finished the first one.  Make sure the waiter sprinkles the truffles on top.  I had the ossobuco for the main course.  The sauce was not too strong, but the meat was very tender.  Great service, so we left a 20% tip.  Dinner for 2 came to $1070.00 (wine was a bit over-priced at $380).  Oh and they are pretty strict about the the dress code which is business casual(Wynn is about the only casino with a dress code).",

When I came into the entrance of Sinatra, of course i checked out his Grammy, his Emmy and his Oscar in the glass cases and all of the old time pictures of him and Mr. Wynn and the Rat Pack. When I first checked in for my table, it was ready and the hostess showed me the way. Now, for a guy like me, from a small town no one has ever heard of in the Mid-West, this next moment impressed me so much and re-assured me that this was going to be an exceptional dinner. My waiter for the evening, came up to me at my table, and said, \"Good Evening Mr. Bedtka. how are you doing tonight?\" That blew my mind, first that he pronounced my name correctly, but that that kind of service exists that they take the time to greet you like that. After my drink order, I looked over the menu, and found the meatballs and polenta fries. Absolutely the best meatballs i have had and the fries were light, warm and airy. For my entree, i selected the Ossobuco \"My Way\". Love the title for this dish, probably my favorite Sinatra song lol. It was so tender that put my knife back down and only used my fork for the whole dish. The risotto was cooked perfectly, so creamy and flavorful. The decor, created by Roger Thomas, is so beautiful and full of Sinatra portraits. It's my new Italian restaurant that I will frequent with my trips to Vegas.",

Instead of the chicken parmigiana being the hearty, home-style Italian cooking it should have been, it was just one very large piece of greasy, fried I don't know what with a side of what might as well have been tomato paste. I'm pretty sure the Chef lied on his resume and that his previous experience was actually at Kentucky Fried Chicken or Disneyland. My dad had the lasagna and he might as well have stayed home and heated up the Lean Cuisine brand in the microwave. The server couldn't offer a smile once the entire time - and he made it clear he was there only to flip our table and move on. Actually, his personality matched the food perfectly - completely unenticing. The only positive thing I can offer is that the interior design is brilliant. An hour and $500 later for 3 PEOPLE, I think I've made my point that this place is god awful. I know Frank would agree, the best is YET to come ;)",

The service was not up to par with the fabulous Wynn name. I had to ask for things to be removed from the table etc. The ambiance is quite nice but bland.. I expected something a little more nostalgic about Sinatra. After all that's where we were. I must say the bathrooms were fabulous. The food was the biggest disappointment. The carpacio was lacking in flavor and needed salt. The absolute worst entrees are the Osso buccu, that was extremely fatty and had virtually zero sauce to accent it. The risotto was ok. The sea bass was also just as bad,, It all lacked flavor. Please avoid this restaurant, unless your up for bland food, mediocre service and generic entrees. The best part of the meal was when a magician appeared at our table with some amazing tricks, it saved the evening!",

Everything about the experience was first class. From the greeting and seating by the manager, to the sommelier, to the to-die-for food, and our favorite bottle of Domaine Ott Rose (they only had one bottle left...and we shared a bit with our server), we've been dreaming about this place since we left. The polenta sticks were crispy outside and creamy inside, and the meat sauce accompanying them put food I've had in Italy to shame. The second pasta dish we chose was a special that evening of tagliatelle with brown butter and black truffles that were shaved over the dish in front of us. I swear, the poor dog or hog that had to sniff out this truffle would have been dejected had he seen how much we were given.  Again, the strip is over-saturated with chains and mediocrity as we all know, but Sinatra was a complete departure from either. Romantic, classy, and well-executed...that is the Sinatra experience. We'll see you in two weeks!",

Pillars of funky white shapes and classic black and white tiles will have you wondering if you stepped into the past and landed in the retro decades. Sinatra's \"awards\" are plastered on the walls and pictures/posters of The Voice is everywhere.    Food is absolutely divine. The caprese was drenched in olive oil and the mozzarella was so soft and moist. We also had their poleptinne which included marinara saturated meatballs and grilled polenta.   My main course was the turbot with seared mushrooms. This dish was so delicate and full of flavor. The turbot is exquisitely tender and you can feel each piece of fish separate on your tongue palate. I highly recommend this dish to anyone who plans to pay a visit to this tribute restaurant.   Speaking of tribute, they were definitely paying their respects to The Voice. His melodious tunes were crooning to me throughout our dinner. But beware, you can barely hear \"Fly me to the Moon\" because it's so busy. But it is definitely in the background somewhere.   Friendly service, wonderful food, and intimate setting. Why would you NOT want to come here?",

    "text": "Fourth night of honeymoon, fourth great dinner.  After watching La Reve, we made our way over to Sinatra at the Encore.  The first thing that you notice while approaching is the Black and Gold Sinatra sign above the walk in entrance.   It really helps to set the mood of the evening, and like his music, the joint is classy.  We were seated within 5 minutes, even though the restaurant was full and we were 20 minutes early.   The chairs were wide comfy wooden loungers, and the decor reminded me of a Godfather movie set adorned with large oils of Sinatra, his music playing in the back ground, with reddish orange hues and elaborate rope chandeliers reminiscent of  a high end restaurant from the 50's.  Perfect for the Chairmen of the Board.  A spot where wise guys would come and at the end of the meal say \"Put it on my tab,\" the owner rightfully knowing that if he asked them to pay, he might be sleeping with the fishes in Lake Las Vegas.    Dressed for the affair, I was wearing a suit, and my bride looked so good in her black dress and new Manolos, if she had been on the menu, I would have ordered her.  I know, I know, I just got married, give me a break.    We started with a bottle of bubbly, I don't recall the name, but at about $95 it was reasonably priced, and lasted us through the meal.  We began with two aps, a crab salad and an octopus in marinara sauce.   The dish was simple and straight forward with lots of white crab meat tossed in a mayonnaise based dressing.  The octopus dish was very interesting and something that I would never have conceived in my kitchen at home.   However when I think of it now, a nice tomato gravy with slowly simmered tender pieces of octopus and capers, not only sounds but tastes really good.  Of course the service was exemplary.  We had one of the older waiters who said that he had been with the restaurant since it opened 2 years ago.  He recommended that I have the Ossobucco, paired with a glass of cabernet...sounded good to me, and my wife decided on the chicken wrapped in prosciutto served with spinach.  Both dishes were high quality.  My plate looked like something out of a French cook book circa 1945, and had flavors of red wine, pot roast, and sherry which paired nicely with the recommended wine.  My wife's chicken was perfectly cooked, and the prosciute helped to impart a smoky flavor while keeping the bird tender and moist.   For dessert,  we ordered the Tiramisu which was also good, but felt a little pre made, meaning that it came served in a martini glass, and seemed a little wet for our tastes, like it had been made yesterday, or even 2 days prior.  Still not bad, and a great way to finish the meal which after the  still water, and the bubbly, 2 aps, 2 main courses, a glass of wine, and a beer, came out to an obese price tag of $380 tip included.     A great restaurant, but truthfully I felt a little overlooked.  When I made my reservations here, I had said that it was my honeymoon.  That should at least warrant a small congratulations dessert, or perhaps a shot of limoncello, or something to celebrate with.  Botero, two nights prior went above and beyond the call to make us feel welcomed, and I still remember our sommelier and our waiter's name.  This was not the case at Sinatra.     That being said, you should defiantly eat here, just don't expect the staff or the waiter to do anything extra for your special occasion.  With a restaurant based on a guy like Sinatra, I expected just a little more generosity.  However, I would like to congratulate Mr. Wynn for really capturing the True essence of the man, and for making a restaurant that I know Frankie would have been proud to put his name on.",

To start, we were served a basket of bread (some different loaves, bread sticks, and cheese crackers), along with butter with buds of basil (they tasted like that, anyway). They were just okay.   I ordered chicken with mushrooms and gnocchi. The chicken was the most tender chicken I've probably ever had, but it was fairly bland.  I tried the scallops with cauliflower puree and blood orange. The scallops were AMAZING! Seared on the outside, buttery on the inside, and perfectly flavored. The cauliflower puree was a pleasant surprise. It had the texture of mashed potatoes, but lighter with a gentle taste of cauliflower.   My dad, who ordered the lobster risotto, said it was the most delicious risotto he's ever had. It came with large chunks of lobster on top, as would be expected for a $41 dish.   All desserts are $12 and I tried the tiramisu as well as a pumpkin cake thing. The tiramisu -- which people seem to rave about -- was kind of watery. It was served in a big martini glass and the presentation was beautiful, but it tasted overly soggy. The pumpkin cake thing (I'm sure it has a fancy italian name I can't spell or pronounce) was average-tasting, but pretty to look at!  The service was great! Our wine and water glasses never went below half-full, the hostess was extremely friendly, and our waitress was extremely attentive without being intrusive.   Overall a pretty good experience, but considering the price of the meal, it wasn't outstanding.",

(I am) They were playing From Here to Eternity at the bar and sound wise mostly Sinatra, with some Peggy Lee, Dino, Sammy, and Nat King Cole.   There was a Happy Anniversary card for us at the table as well as we were comped our first round of drinks for the occasion. This was super sweet. Nice touch!  We started with the Caresse Salad which was fresh and perfectly balanced. I ordered the hand rolled spaghetti, while J-bo ordered the lasagna. Both were delicious.   The solemner was gracious and very informative. This is a high scale restaurant and they offer pretty expensive wines.  Being from San Francisco, we know of many wines as high quality at a lower price point, but when in Vegas...  The wine she suggested was perfect with the meal and our tastes.   After all it's Sinatra's world, we just live in it.",

    "text": "Ate here for our anniversary (again). Still flawless. This time it was different in that Steve Wynn was having dinner out on the patio and the staff was trying to keep the disturbance down to minimal. They succeeded. Even with the Big Boss on site, the service was extraordinary. Always attentive, and quick to offer suggestions. This time we split the Black Truffle Fettucini for an appetizer. If they have this when you dine here, ORDER IT!! Earthy and buttery and oh-so delicious. The wife had the Chicken Marsala while I had the Special, which was a perfectly cooked hunk of filet mignon with a wine-reduction sauce. The gelato dessert was ordered again, and enjoyed again. Then they brought out a pistachio panna cotta with \"Happy Anniversary\" written on it in chocolate. The waiter suggested a dessert wine to accompany, and poured it gratis. After Steve left the manager came by the table to congratulate us, and when he found out that we had had our anniversary dinner at Sinatra every year since it has been open, gifted us with a signed picture of Steve and Frank and a private issue CD of the songs Steve selected for the restaurant. Then he was waiting for us as we left to congratulate us again and thank us for dining there. Total high-roller treatment for a couple of ordinary folk. This place is a winner and will always be on our list of faves. Thanks, Steve!",

    "text": "This is a ridiculously beautiful restauraunt with impeccable service to match. It is located in a little corner of the Encore, away from the madness of the Casino floor. You definitely want to dress nice (don't even think about Jeans guys!), but they do not require a jacket.   The interior has a sort of Mad Men 50's feel with many modern touches, especially in the ceiling and chandelier fixtures. The napkins are so nice you almost feel bad wiping your hands on them. The staff is probably the most professional service staff I have ever been serviced by. This was not just a unique trait of Sinatra, but of the entire Wynn and Encore hotel complex.  Sinatra music pumps softly through the speakers, a good mix of his tunes and adds to the atmosphere. The restaurant has a beautiful outdoor area with a fireplace and a garden.  This was a birthday dinner for me and they had little touches waiting for me such a hand-written birthday card, free birthday cookies on a plate that said \"Happy Birthday\" written in chocolate.  Don't worry, the waiters won't come out wearing sombreros singing happy birthday or anything.  The restauraunt offered a 3 course prix fixe menu from 5:30-6:30 that we took advantage of, the value was fantastic compared to the standard menu prices ($40-50 entrees are the norm). Chef Theo Schoenegger makes amazingly delicious dishes. I don't know where the kitchen finds their mushrooms, but the mushroom risotto was spectacular, as was the chicken marsala.   The deserts of Tiramasu and Gelato were really really good. The chocolate gelato was one of the most delicious examples of chocolate I have ever had the pleasure of experiencing.  Overall, this was a stellar dining experience and an extremely memorable and happy Birthday dinner. This is an italian restauraunt not be missed in Vegas.",

She made the experience that much more enjoyable and was extremely nice when I told her about my food allergies.   The dinner portion sizes are quite large so beware if it is just the two of you ordering and you don't want leftovers!  The lasagna was to die for (it comes straight in the pan from the oven) and the caprese was delicious.   If you don't want to smell the smoke from the casino, ask for a table further inward.  Perfect place to eat after going to La Reve in the Wynn!  Definitely pricey, but worth it if you want to leave full and happy :)",

    "text": "My friends and I came here for my birthday dinner before heading to XS, and as with everything in the Wynn/ Encore hotels, we were impressed.    They offer several types of bread & crackers served with fruity extra-virgin olive oil.  Balsamic vinegar can be ordered to accompany the extra-virgin olive oil.  Try not to overindulge in bread since you don't want to ruin your appetite.  To wet our appetite, we ordered a round of Under the Tuscan Sun drinks: a cocktail with vodka and a mixture of juices.  It reminded me of a mix of a sunrise and a seabreeze.  We ordered: Caprese, Capponatina, Lasagna Bolognese, Tagliata (bone-in ribeye with eggplant parmasan), and Ossobuco.  This meal was one of the best that I've ever had in Las Vegas.  The dishes come out piping hot and are worth the wait.   The food was delicious and the meat was tender.  The tomatoes in the caprese were a mix of heirloom, cherry, & hothouse; some of them were not as ripe as they should have been, but overall it was good because of the soft Buffalo mozzarella.  The ossobuco and gremalata was so soft and juicy.  The ribeye was the perfect tender medium rare.  The lasagna would make you cry, it's so good.    This place is swanky!  It's like stepping into another era.  The furnishings are impressive: reminiscent of 1950s old Hollywood, bright, stylish and bold.  There is a dress code, but nothing too restrictive.  Sinatra's music is piped throughout the restaurant.  Overall, an enjoyable experience.  If you're ever going to indulge on a Vegas whim, try out Sinatra, you may surprise yourself or your date.",

Sinatra offered a great menu and so we decided to have our last dinner there. I was a bit surprised that the vegan menu is not listed on their main menu. If you don't know it exists--you wouldn't think that they offered anything veg. We loved the vegan bread and butter basket. We ordered a pasta dish with an asparagas sauce--which was not very impressive. The Gardein Chickn Marsala with gnocchi was amazing! Unfortunately, we didn't feel it was impressive enough to warrant the price--but it gets an extra star just for having a vegan menu.",

Mozarella and freshness of the tomatoes are nevertheless not to be questioned.  Melanese - Oh baby bring it on. While I would have preferred to see the real True \"Veal Chop\" on the menu, this did not disappoint. Just plain sublime.  Desert - A selection was brought for us and did not disappoint. Outrageous would be a good word.  So in closing not much to knock, everyone enjoyed their meal and the service was impeccable. A little extra work at the beginning, slightly larger menu selection (add a Veal Chop please) and I'll be hard pressed not to give it 5 stars next time around...

This place is the creme de la creme of fine dining and the service is impeccable. You are treated exquisitely, in an utmost refined manner from the moment you step foot into this establishment and when they proclaim that the food is imported, they certainly deliver what they profess. The dining experience here was probably on my top five list of most remarkable restaurants ever encountered. If you are looking for loud music and bar-hopping that is the typical Las Vegas scene, this is not the place to dine. This place is one of the few, if not the only restaurant in Las Vegas where you can actually enjoy a sophisticated meal in a tranquil setting amongst fellow patrons who share a similar taste.

The polenta fries were crispy on the outside and so creamy on the inside. The polenta complimented the meatballs perfectly.

The chicken parmigiana had a little too much cheese, but was tender and tasteful.  Great wine list and amazing caprese salad with imported cheese from Italy which was a great way to start the meal.  Will definitely go back next time we are in Las Vegas.",

Try the Sinatra Smash, they recommend it. It was so yummy! The food was delish too! My husband had the Lasagna bolgense. And I had the Lobster Risotto. So good!!

Service is solid, portions are decent but up sells on small items, like a \"side\" of a 1/2 cup soggy spaghetti in meat sauce for $10 was silly, and mediocre at best. Like most places in Vegas these days they are not providing what you'd expect for the money. Passable, but not worth a special visit by any means. Perhaps I'm spoiled by the abundance of good, reasonably priced restaurants here in AZ. See my review of Aiellos in Phoenix - that was what I expected here - but did not get.",

THEY HAD ZERO TASTE WHAT SO EVER... i had the chicken parm for my entree it came out in a medal pan actually did not look that bad.. then i cut into it the chicken was very very thick and the cheese and sauce had no taste. after eating it i realized these dishes are 100% pre made. the side of spaghetti that was not included with the entree was so tiny and so mushy it could have passed as mashed potatoes.  all 8 of us hated our food including the pasta with shrimp and lobster sauce and the lasagna.  I'm not going to complain about the prices because we saw them before we went and i never mind paying money for a good meal.. BUT THIS PLACE IS NOTHING EVEN CLOSE TO A GOD MEAL.. STAY AWAY unless your from the Midwest and u do not know good Italian food this place is a no go. from the casino host himself i guarantee this place will be done within 6 months",

    "text": "A very upscale italian restaurant riding off the coattails of Frank Sinatra's image, Sinatra at the Encore is a good example of Italian haute cuisine.  The dress code is business casual, with almost all the men wearing jackets and boots and women also dressing up as well. However I went in with a clean pair of tennis shoes, nice jeans, a collared shirt under a sweater and it was fine.  I was with family and we ordered two appetizers to share and  5 different entrees.  Bread is served and you get your choice of individual baguettes, raisin and nut bread, or fennel bread. All three weren't very impressive, fresh, and in fact were dissapointing. The presentation of the butter however was excellent as it was already warmed for spreading.  The appetizers:  We ordered the Tonnato, slivers of tuna fish served raw and with roe and drizzled with oil. It came with a side of sauce that was I believe made from the fish and it was absolutely incredible. It's highly aerated, and looks like creamy but has this nutty, beautifully subtle umami flavor to it. I'm currently on a mission to find out how to make it myself... it'll probably require some machinery to be honest to aerate it that perfectly.  The other appetizer was the polpettine, meatballs and cubes of polenta. The meatballs were soft but didn't have any special flavor to them. They were nice and crumbly without being mealy and were savory. The polenta was excellent though And I liked it's multiple textures. It had a visible crust topside and bottom, a firm, much lighter crust on its sides, but it had a very soft crumbly center that melts in your mouth.  The entrees:  We ordered the rigatoni, risotto, a pasta dish called the chitarra, and I had a dry-aged New York steak.  The rigatoni is made with a tomato-cream sauce with a hint of cheese, fresh basil, and big huge fresh shrimp. This dish was good, and this is a nice fancy restaurant, but it was overpriced to death. 30 bucks for rigatoni pasta that doesn't taste any better than supermarket Barilla is a bit of a dissapointment.  The risotto came with baked Main lobster and it was absolutely delicious. The lobster was succulent and sweet, the risotto was reduced and flavored just right to compliment it.  The chitarra is a spaghetti dish with \"hand-rolled spaghetti\" that again tastes like it was out of a box. At least it was a perfect al-dente. It's made in a cream-based wild-mushroom saute and seasoned with chives. They screwed up this dish by making it a bit too salty and we had it taken back. When it came back, it came back suspiciously quick (especially when we were told it would be remade), and I tasted it and realized they just dumped more sauce into it to dilute it. Must've been premade.  And finally, to my steak. I had a gorgeous 14oz New York strip cooked medium rare, and it was exactly that, cooked in a broiler, great crust all throughout. The dry-aged beef was delicious, the flavor was exquisite as it let out more as I kept chewing. I especially loved how the fattier edges contrasted with the leaner center. Just great. It came with a side of potatoes and some wild mushrooms, but those were just a speck in the meal. My steak was fantastic.  The service here is nothing short of exemplary for a True fine dining restaurant. I would definitely come here again, but then again this is a town where there are just too many fine-dining restaurants to try to stick to one place. That, and overall I wasn't impressed with some of the food despite the prestige that seems to hype up this restaurant. I was happy with my meal, but for the price you pay here (think 40 bucks a person, average. Safely 50) you expect nothing short of a home run.",

    "text": "Sinatra is an excellent restaurant in Steve Wynn's new luxury tower suites hotel at Encore. I have the Yelp community to help steer me towards Sinatra, so thank you Yelp! Quick story; I was in Las Vegas for my mom's 65th birthday and were looking for a restaurant to help celebrate. Originally my aunt made reservations at Switch, another restaurant at Encore. However, I researched Switch on Yelp and saw that it had a 2 star review at the time =X I suggested we try somewhere else and I came across Sinatra on Yelp. The 4 1/2 star review seemed appealing and thus suggested Sinatra. To say the least, I was now nervous because the burden now came onto me. However, at the end of the evening, Sinatra did NOT disappoint, and my mom was very happy with her meal and experience =)  Onto the details.  The ambiance and atmosphere at Sinatra was of class. A modern decor with a hint of old-Italian, combined with high ceilings, chandeliers, a huge portrait of Ol Blue Eyes himself, and a view of the flower garden created a feeling of elegance. Even the chairs were impressive, as if it were a throne itself. However, the beautiful hostess and staff helped each patron to their seats, and hence our night began.  The service at Sinatra is what really blew me away. Our waiter, Michael, was very amiable and down-to-earth. His portly stature, combined with his friendly personality, almost made me call him Uncle Mikey! Although you might expect a bit of pretentiousness at such a classy restaurant, Michael certainly dispelled that notion. He welcomed us to Sinatra and provided us with a quick description about the restaurant, as well as award-winning Chef Theo Schoenegger. As Michael described, Sinatra is obviously an Italian restaurant. However, Chef Theo approached the menu by taking classic Italian dishes and utilized reverse-culinary engineering to deconstruct the ingredients. He then implements his influence to these dishes to create a modern feel to classic Italian selections. That said, he elegantly went over the menu, giving a brief description of the dishes he recommends. After hearing Michael's monologue, I must say, I was excited!  While waiting for our food to arrive, my dad brought a bottle of wine for the table, a 2005 Caymus Special Selection. I believe the corkage fee was around $40? After Michael took our orders, the sommelier (or wine steward) quickly came to our table and asked if we'd like our wine to be placed in a decanter. After saying yes, we observed this wine master at work, delicately pouring the wine from its original bottle into the decanter, then taking the bottle close to a lighted candle, to observe if any sediments were left. After a few minutes of allowing the wine to aerate and breathe within the decanter, she sampled the wine to taste for any tannins. Deemed ready. she brought our wine to the table, and after witnessing all that, it made the wine even more enjoyable! We actually just came from Napa Valley and consumed much wine during that trip (as expected haha), so my dad and I were having a conversation with her. She was very charming and answered many of our wine-related questions, so that was nice.  Okay, onto the food. Sorry for the wait! For appetizers we decided to share amongst the 5 of us. We ordered two orders of each: the Assaggini Di Mare ( a quartet of the sea), the Polpettine (meatballs with polenta and mushrooms), and the Cappesante (seared Maine scallops). I didn't have much of the sea quartet, but I can definitely vouch for the Polpettine and Cappesante! The meatballs were bursting with flavor, as well as the scallops. Together with celery and kumquat fruits, the diverse combination with the scallops produced a refreshing taste to my palate, as the kumquat complimented the scallops well, while the celery acted as the bridge to put the two tastes together.  I ordered the ravioli (with butternut squash, vanilla, and amaretto) for my second choice. I was a bit disappointed in the taste, for it was a bit bland for my palate. Perhaps it was the butternut squash? The vanilla foam on top, however, was a nice touch to the ravioli. My dad recommended the Agnolotti (with ricotta and herbs, parmesan sauce and chives), so maybe next time.  For my main course I ordered the Colorado Rack of Lamb, along with a side of mashed Yukon Gold potato. Yum! The lamb was so tender and flavorful! The meat tasted so delicate, it was literally hanging by a thread off of the meat. The potato puree was an excellent compliment to the lamb, which was suggested by Michael. I'm not sure how Chef Theo did it, but you have to try the meat and see for yourself!  For dessert, I had the bread pudding with gelato. The contrasting flavors and temperatures made the end of my dining experience even more enjoyable!  Overall, I greatly enjoyed my experience at Sinatra and highly recommend! This is no themed restaurant in a casino, this is fine Italian dining at its best!  P.S. Sorry for the long review =X lol",

    "text": "What can I say . I'm a big Sinatra fan. My brother played sax with his songs I sang his songs in jazz choir back in college, and his music is so heavenly that a restaurant after him is so appropriate.     Good music and what else? Good food and even better to be in the Encore.    My partner works at the Wynn so we decided on a dinner after Valentines day to ease the congestion of the typical dinner on a Sunday. A Monday is good.    Appetizer: tuna was good half way though I realize it was missing something and I was staring at it; the spiced olive/pickle that was fanned out added the perfect punch to the relishy chopped mix.     Ossobuco: never had it before and Frank(partner)(yes how ironic the name), had it. What I expected; soft and tender.meaty great yummy sauce thicker than what I envisioned. The risotto a nice touch with it. Great dish but would be better with a more onion punch. I'm Asian born in Cali so I like strong flavor.     I had the Rombo ; read reviews about it . I had to try it for myself I loved it and savores every bite. A soft white fish with a buttersquash and the nuttyness of what I called truffle oil? I asked the waiter and he said yes it's in the dish. I loved it delicate, but exotic and just could not help, but the flavor kept making me smile. Try it I dare you guys can't help but smile when enjoying this dish.   We were full but our waiter nicely brought out tiramisu and said \"just a taste\" well it was good. Yummy a nice flavor not as soggy as other reviews say. Not too rich and not too light very good chocolate and cream was fantastic.    Yes I would cone back for a different appetizer, I would get my rombo again. And loved tiramisu but I like trying new things. Beautiful restaurant, nice furniture and view by the patio. We were once again the youngest ones there so don't  be fooled by age. We gave our waiter a 28% tip.",

    "text": "We visited Sinatra with much anticipation. I was worried b/c my  expectations were so high. Sinatra exceeded them.  We went with another couple on Superbowl weekend. Our reservations were  for 6:30. We arrived promptly and were seated immediately. There weren't  many other people dining at that time. However, by the time we left  every table was occupied and there was a line out the door waiting.  I knew it was gong to be a good night when they were able to offer some  better vodkas for my martini. I had Ciroq. Last month when I ate at  Carnevino they were excited to offer Grey Goose. (please, no thank you)  I do not drink wine, but our friends did. They were pleased with the  list and found a red that they both enjoyed.  For appetizers, I had the scallop with celery and kumquats. Fabulous!  It simply melted in my mouth. The combination of flavors was  exceptional. Get this! My husband had the romaine salad with lemon  vinaigrette dressing. We both thought it was fabulous. I loved the  anchovy croutons, he was not really a fan of them.  Three different breads were served. All of them were great. My favorite  was the cheese. The olive was interesting and worth a taste. Be  careful not to fill up on these. It is very easy to do. They were  yummy.  For dinner, I ordered the John Dory fillet. I read other reviews here  and it seemed to be consistently great. It held True for me. It was by  far the best of our 4 meals. It was cooked to perfection. Again the  combination of flavors was perfect. I loved the truffle sauce and  asparagus.  My husband ordered the shrimp rigatoni. It was OK. Of the four meals it  was our least favorite. There was nothing special about it. The red  sauce was average.  Our friends ordered the New York steak and the evenings pork special.  Both were great. The steak was served black and blue. I am not really a  fan of steak and this won my heart. The pork special was also very  tasty. We ordered side dishes of mushroom saute and vegetable  ratatouille. When I placed the order I asked the server if there would  be enough for the table since we wanted to share the mushrooms. He said  absolutely and they would be served family style. Well, this was not  the case. The portions were only enough for one person. We immediately  asked him to bring more when he served them. I am accustomed to fine dining portions but  was surprised how small of a portion the side dished were. The mushrooms  were wonderful. Actually I could have had 2 scallops and a side of  mushrooms as a meal. Maybe they should put that on the menu.  We decided to order dessert as well. We ordered the bomboloni and  cappello. I liked the bomboloni better, but both were delightful. I  would definitely suggest you save room for both of these.  Service was wonderful through out the entire evening. I pick this over  Carnevino. Given the choice between Envy and Sinatra, I would be hard  pressed to choose. Both were well worth every penny!",

Hostess was very understanding and was able to get us in when we arrived.  When it came time to ordering a bottle of wine, the sommelier was very helpful and even gave my son and his friend a Sinatra Smash on the house (most amazing cocktail I've ever had) and came back often to check on us.   Food was very good and service excellent.  Even brought my son a slice of raspberry dessert with Happy Birthday written on the plate.l  Overall a perfect way to start our vacation and celebrate this memorable birthday.",

Despite the beautiful bar and grand atmosphere, the food was a disaster. My friend got meatballs so chewy that could have bounce up the ceiling a few times. The sauce was thick and flavorless. I risked getting the spaghetti and clams and I regret it. For $35 I got an overlooked Italian nightmare. The idea of adding red sauce to the dish wasn't really smart, it overpowered the clams making you taste only garlic. The pasta was so over cooked that I basically ate none of it. The eggplant parmigiana was cold and messy. We didn't dare ordering dessert. I'd go back only to seat at the bar and watch Old movies, I guess that's the most you can make out of Sinatra.",

    "text": "Sinatra has done the impossible; it showed my husband and I that you can have a fanciful, enchanting dinner in VEGAS.    Husband and I had dropped the ball making reservations for dinner on a Friday night.  Nothing looked available on Opentable.  Thank goodness for the concierge at the Encore.  She recommended Sinatra (which I knew Nothing about) and called up and made us a reservation within 10 minutes.  When it comes to restaurants in Vegas, my expectations are low.  I find places loud, crowded, gaudy, overpriced & overhyped.    As we approached the restaurant, located in the Encore, we saw photos & awards of Frank.  (They need photos of Frank & Ava; they looked damn good together.)  We were immediately greeted and taken to a quiet intimate table.  There were people, but they were far away.  Privacy at a Vegas restaurant?  Spectacular.  The decor made one nostalgic for the Vegas Rat Pack days.  There are giant photos of Frank and they had his music playing (yes, I'm a fan and have his greatest hits on my iTunes).  Its simple, yet elegant.  Then, I don't know if the host was the manager, but he stayed and chit chatted with us for about 10 minutes.  Between the decor, music & personable host, we were relaxed and in quite the amorous mood.    A bottle of Chianti-Very Good Caprese-thought this was standard but was really craving it Insalatina Dell Imperatore-they do Caesar salad right w/anchovy  Ossobuco My Way-Very Good (but a big portion and couldn't even come close to finishing)  Was it pricey?  Of course, its Vegas.  BUT, it was worth every penny (a rare statement by me in Vegas).  Hands down my favorite dinner (and my husband agrees) in Vegas.",

    "text": "A rather good experience turned unpleasant. We dined at Sinatra mid-July, as it was steps from our suite.  Reservation was made for 7pm, yet despite arriving two minutes early, we were made to wait ten minutes. Another party, arriving after us, was seated first. The mocktail I had in the meantime - Sinatra splash(?) was way too sweet and not good at all.  Eventually, though, we did receive one of the three best tables in the house, so this wait could be forgiven.     Our server was cold and pushed the sale of alcohol.  We are avid wine drinkers, but since I'm pregnant, we decided to skip libations that evening.  He still asked my husband three times if he wanted something from the bar and even went on to slowly explain that they offer wine by the glass. Despite hearing three times 'no', he insisted on leaving wine menu on our table \"just in case.\"  That level of sales push is unacceptable in a fine dining establishment.   Onto the food. We shared a vegetable salad, which was tasty. I had the lamb, and while perfectly proper, I didn't find it overly exciting. I felt the presentation was uninspired.  The plate was way too big and it seemed that the chef was trying to cater to the median palate and stomach size. The lamb was also quite fatty, but given the size, I could cut off the fatty parts and still was left very satisfied. My husband ordered the veal parmigiana, which was enormous, but he really enjoyed it.  Desserts were the highlight. Tiramisu, though not classic, was light and fluffy and very good. The panna cotta was easily among the best we've ever tried and my husband is a big panna cotta aficionado.  Sadly, cappuccinos were bad. Too much too hot water in the shot, too much milk and not enough foam - the foam not creamy.   Onto the bad. At 3am I woke up with horrible nausea.  I spent three hours battling the symptoms of food poisoning. In the morning, my husband told me that he woke up earlier, closer to midnight, with a very bad heartburn and some nausea.  The next day was tainted by my stomach playing up. Yes, I am pregnant, but seven months of my pregnancy had passed with no gastric episodes whatsoever before I dined at Sinatra. I blame the veg salad that we shared. We also shared both desserts, but it's the thought of this salad that gives me the chills.   So, my rating is as follows - the food 4.5, half less star for the service and additional star for the medical aftershocks.",

    "text": "I researched all of the menus and themes in the Wynn/Encore properties, and Sinatra seemed to best fit the bill for what I was looking for to surprise my honey with. Fine Italian Vegan dining? Check! Beautiful ambiance? Check! Soft background mood music? Umm... Yes, if you dig Sinatra music.  Upon being seated by our hostess, I displayed my redneck charm by assisting her while turning the table to seat us. I didn't realize what she was doing as it's customary in these \"fine dining\" establishments to turn the table a bit to allow the lady to sit down, then turn it back. I thought she knew we wanted to sit on the same side and was turning it to accommodate us. Once she realized that was my thought, she quickly offered to seat us in a booth, side by side. Very nice of her.  The service other than the hostess was a bit substandard. I could see the dollar signs dimming in the eyes of our waitress when we told her we would be declining the drink menu. Yes, I know this was my first trip to Vegas where I stayed near completely sober... When we requested the Vegan menu, she knew our bill wasn't going to reach the point where her take would be $20 or more. From that point on, she offered the minimum amount of service possible while pasting on a phony smile.  The exquisite food all made up for it once it was rolled out. The Chick-non Marsala brought me back to childhood when my mom would fry up some chicken breast in the ol' electric skillet, using her patented blend of Lawry's seasoning. It was one of the most authentically meaty tasting dishes I've had in 16+ years. If that's your thing, this dish is for you! Although it was slightly on the salty side, that's ok for me since I crave sodium as much as my body craves water. This sumptuous chick-non patty was laid on a bed of my favorite pasta, gnocchi. This created a meal, that was nearly worth it's $33 price tag. I can really get used to eating smaller portions when they taste this amazing.  The beet salad was good with various types of beets laid out artfully in a rectangular platter. It was a little pricey at $14 but worth ordering if you're a fan of the beets like we are.  The Cioccolato we ordered for dessert was a cocoa powder covered delight. Definitely order a coffee with this one to soak up all that chocolate flavor. Just don't order a latte. I'm not sure they make them here. They brought out something resembling espresso with steamed milk, yet it wasn't a latte as I'm used to. Maybe go for their cappuccino instead since I think they would do a better job at that. This is a dessert that is meant to be savored, so if you're feeding your partner, take it slowly...  Sinatra is where the True \"High Rollers\" come to eat <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sinatra-las-vegas#Q_78_I5-KnUrRsAqFrJ1mg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/sina...</a> You won't have to worry about remembering any of ol' Blue Eyes greatest hits, as they'll play softly in the background, all while you dine in classy, elegant style. It's nice to see how the other half lives, if only for one meal.  If you have a special someone in your life that loves Italian food, but just so happens to be Vegan, take them to Sinatra. You may just make their day as special as they are themselves.",

This place is fit for a pauper a puppet a pirate a poet a pawn and a king, except the pauper sure couldn't afford it, but heh, That's Life, that's what people say. I'd have to say one of the highlights is the vintage wine, from fine old kegs. It was also great to see things in the menu that Frank himself loved, my favorite was the meatballs and polenta fries, do not miss those. But seriously back to the bar here, if you can use some exotic booze, I'm sure you'll find it here. I myself had the special vintage Jack Daniels, with a single big ice cube, it was delicious. I feel sorry for people that don't drink because when they wake up in the morning that's the best they're going to feel for the rest of the day. I had a difficult time choosing an entree, but was very happy with my choice, the Pennette, it made me think, let's forget about tomorrow for tomorrow never comes. I decided to stay at the Wynn and not New York New York, but hey, I'm leaving today, I want to be a part of it. I think that this can only happen to a guy like me, and happen only in a place like this. Speaking of which, the physical restaurant itself is great and the photos and memorabilia sprinkled throughout the restaurant really make for a great experience. I've never been so close to an actual academy award and it was great to see that the Sinatra family have loaned the Wynn Franks', that he earned in From Here to Eternity. And now the end is near, and so I face the final part of this review. I assure you there were not times at dinner at Sinatra when I've bitten off more than I can chew. I highly recommend Sinatra and believe the best is yet to come!",

Asked for still water and promptly had the customary San Pellegrino brought to the table.  Greeted by our server after about 15 minutes.  Ordered a bottle of wine and she promptly disappeared.  Sommelier brought us the wine...and we waited further.  Finally I flagged her down again and asked for bread and an appetizer to share.  Not impressed with the caprese.  As we waited for our server to return we noted the you couldn't hear ANY of the Frank Sinatra music that was playing in the background.  Extremely loud and unpleasant atmosphere.  The filets were well done but nothing special and the sides were meager.  I was tired of steak for the week so I ordered the penne pasta with sausage ragu.  OK, but not anything special.  At every course I had to yell to our server to get her to stop at our table.  Frankly we were so disappointed that we just wanted to leave.  I can see where this place could be great but not on this night and not with this server. There are many first class restaurants in the Vegas area.  Capital Grill and Del Frisco's, to name two, were head and shoulders above this place.  Too bad we hit it on an off night.",

The meal itself was five stars (the chef, Brett LaReau outdid himself and went out of his way to prepare every single course according to my allergies....unbelievable service you will not find in many places and the meal was phenomenal!) The service we received from Russell and Humberto was top-notch....great suggestions, impeccable service, and not once were our glasses empty. Finally, to top it all off, the manager, Matthew, was highly visible and made an effort to speak to each table. We couldn't believe he came over to our table and called us by name....that is something special and shows how much he cares about the people dining at the restaurant. The dress code requires a collared-shirt (or polo shirt) and no tennis shoes for men and that women wear closed-toe shoes, but I didn't feel it was oppressive in any way. I would also recommend the Meatballs as an appetizer and the Chicken Parmigiana for a main entree. For dessert my wife and I shared a berry crostata which was light and refreshing....the perfect end to our best experience EVER in Las Vegas! Thank you Chef Brett, Matthew, Russell and Humberto! God bless and bed wishes!",

The place is awesome with a great Steakhouse-in-a-hotel vibe.   4 stars for vegetarians.",

They accommodated her travel scooter and from the moment we arrived, several members of the staff personally offered her birthday wishes.  They even gave her a hand written card....what a very nice touch!   I had their version of chicken marsala, my husband had branzino and my parents ate the lasagna.  Everyone enjoyed their meals immensely.   We appreciated all of the extra steps that everyone went to to make her special day even more special.  I would highly recommend Sinatra's to anyone in the Las Vegas area.",

The wine list was above average for an Italian restaurant. If this were in NYC it would possibly disappear in the glitz. A fine escape from the upscale modern cuisine, this is a great deviation from the normal mono-theistic gravy-over-pasta joint like Cafe Lamberti. There are just so many other choices it makes a 5th star difficult to attain. Overall a great experience.",

    "text": "You start to wonder whether anything in a Steve Wynn-managed property can be bad. Okay, I'll go out on a limb here - Sinatra may be the best of the bunch. While I can't think of anything I have eaten at Wynn or Encore that is anything worse than \"excellent\", that is a mighty noble feat.   From the moment you enter through the sit down through the overall service, you cannot help but think that this is the way 'Ole Blue Eyes would have wanted to be treated. Never mind that there isn't really a bad seat in the place. Either you get a first hand view of the spectacular interior or the large portrait of the namesake that adorns the middle of the dining room. Choose to eat outside and get views of lush shrubbery and water.   My group ordered all over the menu and it was like a tasting party - but one where you can't go wrong. Frank's Spaghetti and Clams.....Osso Bucco \"My Way\" (SO soft and braised by the gods. Even if Osso Bucco is not your thing, ignore. This is in a class by itself)....Branzino.....the prepped-to-virtual-perfection Veal Parmigiana. My own dish was actually the Lasagna \"bolognese\" which is actually served in a little pot which you must do everything to avoid wanting to lick down after you consume the contents.   Pricewise, you can make it as expensive as you want to be but you can also spend in line with a \"nice\" meal and still be well fed. As as commonplace at Wynn/Encore, there is also a Vegan Menu.   By the way, highly recommended is an opening cocktail. Well known is the Sinatra Smash (which can have with or without whiskey) but, especially if you like being a toastmaster, give the \"Dream\" a shot - a delightful mix of Grand Brut champagne and St-Germain elderflower liqueur.   Vegas is now a treasure trove of dining but Sinatra is easily a place worth repeat visiting. By the way, there's a business casual dress code. You want to dress night anyway. Otherwise, Frank would smack you with his fedora... :)",

But, I'm sure that they treat all their guests special here. It's that kind of place.  We both had a delicious filet. It was perfectly cooked, and surrounded by the most wonderful au jus and vegetables. There was a surprise with some great tasting very thick pieces of bacon in the sauce, and the best tasting little onions and tomatoes you've ever had on top. We met the chef, who has a German name, but who is Italian by birth from Northern Italy. He is a gem. Everything we had that night was simply delicious.   While it's clearly not an inexpensive restaurant, you get what you pay for. The filet was huge, and each of my side dishes was mouth-watering. We had the Panna Cotta for desert and it was labeled \"Happy Anniversary\" around the edges of the plate in chocolate. Seriously, this was one of the finest meals of our lives. Highly recommended",

From the decor to the service and most importantly the food. At first just the theme of a restaurant dedicated to old blue eyes seemed like a novelty. However the nostalgia just adds to the flavor. Had the beef carpaccio with arugula which was fresh and amazing. The spaghetti and clams was fantastic, and for dessert pana cotta shaped in Franks derby. Definitely worth a try even if you aren't a Sinatra fan",

We arrived about an hour early for our reservation to enjoy a few drinks at the bar. The dirty martinis were excellent as was the service.  Once seated we ordered several bottles of wine.  The En Route Pinot Noir is an excellent medium body with very slight accidic aftertaste - definitely recommend.  Started with a couple of appetizers, white truffle pasta and carpaccio.  No truffle oil here, True shaven truffles. For dinner I chose the chicken parmigiano with a side of spaghetti with olive oil and garlic.  Hands down the best chicken parmigiano I have ever had.  There were about 20 of us there and I didn't hear the 1st negative comment in regards to service or food from anyone.  Oh yeh, for dessert I went somewhat simple and ordered the sorbet trio, also great.    Bottom line, if you're in Vegas.. if you like Italian food...this is a must visit.",

The day we went it was raining (surprisingly) so they were able without me asking to put the two of us next to the window looking out at the gardens.  Waiter addressed both of us as Mr and Ms. which was very nice, wine and beer prices were normal; 8$ premium draft beer, $7 wine.  Ordered a appetizer, didn't wait long for that.  My date ordered Pollo Chicken and I ordered the Chicken Parm.  Both were fantastic, portion was just right.  Bill at the end came to $125, which I was okay with, I was treated with class in an upscale place, with great food, music, and aroma.  Would go there again for sure.",

Tucked in the corner of the beautiful Wynn hotel, I was greeted by the hostess with a birthday card, as I had indicated that we were celebrated my birthday for dinner! We were ushered to a lounge area and offered a drink, but quickly seated at our reserved table, where the hostess placed my napkin in my lap.  Our waiter was so friendly, recommending items, and explaining the specials thoroughly. The ambiance was amazing and I felt like royalty sitting at our table. When I used the restroom I wanted to take pictures! The decor was amazing... I thought that maybe I'd walked into another dimension.   My lobster and cucumber salad was delicious, light, and refreshing. The lobster risotto was creamy and flavorful, and for dessert, they brought out a fruit tart, with a candle in it and 'Happy Birthday' scribed in cursive in chocolate on the side of my plate. WHOA!  While this was an expensive dinner, it was worth every cent. I'd recommend everyone make this a part of their Las Vegas experience. I'm going to visit each time I'm in town.",

However, my side of eggplant was swimming in grease and tasteless. They fussed over us until we ordered, and then we were ignored. No one ever came to the table to ask if we were satisfied, and no one noticed that I only took a bite or two of it. That felt less than 4 star.  Bottom line, it's a Vegas upscale hotel restaurant.

To be honest, we stuck out a little, considering we aren't well off like many others that were dining there that evening. We were among wealthy businessmen and their wives. None the less, we weren't there for that.   We were celebrating the beginning of our lives together. We had a beautiful ceramony earlier that day, and we were ready to splurge.  I ordered my favorite wine, a crisp pino griegio, and my handsome husband ordered a beer. (Definitely more his style).  I ordered lobster ravioli(my favorite) and my husband  ordered paglioteli pasta with a cream sauce. Both were so yummy. The service was absolutely amazing.  At the end of our meal, our waitor brought us chocolates and caramels with \"congratulations\"  written on the plate out of chocolate syrup. We were so touched. The attention to detail and impecable presentation was so memorable. Thank you to Sinatras for making our evening so special!!",

Our servers were prompt and very professional and we never had to ask for a thing. Our head waiter Suzanne was phenomenal! She was so warm and friendly and made some amazing suggestions. We had the veal parm and it literally melts in your mouth. The side dish special for that night was fresh pasta with parm and table side shaved truffles. It was heavenly. Very rich though so I'm glad we did it as a side and not an entree. We finished with dessert, (a chocolate shaped fedora), a cappuccino and a little Sinatra Jack Daniels which Suzanne also recommended. The veal parm was truly the best I've ever had. The pork chop was a little dry, but as the veal was the size of a plate, there was plenty to share, but you won't want to. The decor is very cool so take the time to look at some of the pics on the wall. All of the staff had helpful suggestions as to where to pose for the best pictures. There are 4 tables outside as well, if you want a more romantic ambiance.",

The two ladies I was with had the lobster risotto and were not impressed with it at all.The risotto was pretty bland and lacked a lot of flavor. There was also not as much lobster as you see in some of the pictures here on yelp.  I had the veal chop and it was fantastic. We mentioned to the waiter that we were not happy with the risotto and he made up for it by bringing us three free desserts. A nice gesture for sure to try to make It right. That is the reason I am giving them four stars. In the past we have given them five stars because our meals were fantastic. My suggestion to anyone coming here is do not stray away from Italian bill of fare. The sauce is great and not overpowering and always deliver the goods.  Ambience is always second to none, so enjoy.",

    "text": "We had such a wonderful dinner last week at Sinatra. We were in LV celebrating a birthday and chose Sage in the Aria for the birthday dinner and were so disappointed we went to Sinatra's the next night to make up for it and they certainly did.  We were staying at the Encore and when making the reservation mentioned my friends birthday. As soon as we arrived and seated they handed him a birthday card.  Our waiter was so charming. We ordered the antipasto plate and the meatballs for appetizers which immediately erased the meal the night before.  For dinner, I had the chicken parmesan and he had the special tortellini with artichoke. They were like soft pillows. The chicken was amazing and stood alone.  For dessert we had the ricotta cheesecake which was light and airy.  This was a dinner where the service, ambiance and food equaled each other in every way.",

I called ahead and had maybe a ten minute wait. The music and lighting was perfect. We ordered the antipasto and the combination of roasted peppers and prosciutto, buffalo mozzarella was a great start. I ordered the strip steak with red wine sauce. It was cooked perfectly and the roasted heirloom tomatoes were excellent. My wife ordered the Ossobuco My Way and it is all I have heard about for a while. It was cooked perfect and the risotto was the best we have ever had. We were stuffed but wanted to see what dessert was like since everything else was great. I had the tiramisu and she had the panna cotta. Both were excellent and although no longer hungry we finished all of it. Truly one of the best restaurants we have visited in Vegas in the past 10 trips. If you want a romantic dinner then it's the place to go!",

It was a great choice.  We started out with a couple of cocktails and then we were told about the specials and given plenty of time to order. I went with the tuna carpaccio which was tuna sliced paper thin with capers and a perfect dressing. My co-diners went with a salad that was made with watermelon. I don't recall what it was called but they loved it.  I decided to go with the Chicken which was covered in wild mushrooms in a marsala wine sauce over gnocchi. It was DELICIOUS - the gnocchi was the best I ever ate - light tiny little clouds that I couldnt stop eating. The sauce was perfect and the chicken as well.   My co diners had the salmon which was served over vegetables and the pork saltimbocca which was served with a creamy, cheesy spinach. Both said they were delicious.  We passed on dessert as we were too full. Service was excellent and the atmosphere dimly lit and quiet. Perfect for client entertaining or a romantic evening.",

Tuna carpaccio was fresh and flavorful, well-paired with pickled vegetables, pine nuts, raisins, in a balsamic reduction.  Mains Branzino - phenomenal. Potentially best branzino I've ever had. Came highly recommended from our server, justified. Cioppino - hearty seafood stew of lobster, clams, scallops, shrimp, couscous in tomato lobster broth. Friend enjoyed this dish.  Service was good after initial hiccups. We requested to be reseated from a long table to a round table to allow for better conversation, which was accommodated but took awhile to reseat us. Fortunately, our server Dinah got our party of 8 ladies out in time for 7pm La Reve. Would recommend for special occasions - prefer Sinatra to Circo at Bellagio.",

I forgot to take pictures. I really wished I had taken some. I will next visit, I promise.   Our table started off with a special appetizer of Fettuccine Alfredo - $44.00 if my memory serves me correctly - with fresh truffle shavings that were grated right in front of us. I fiddled with my napkin as I tried to keep my paws from reaching up to take the delicious and rare dark truffle from our exceptional server's hand and run away with it to the nearest drive-thru wedding chapel.   Afterwards the vegan menu was presented to me and I ordered a delicious Penne Arrabiata with tender noodles and a lightly spiced sauce ($24.00 or $26.00 I believe).  Others at the table enjoyed the Branzino (grilled Mediterranean sea bass) $49.00. the Veal Parmigiana $49.00 and the Tagliata (prime bone-in rib chop) $56.00. Everybody was very pleased with the preparation of their meats and the accompaniments. I see others complaining of the prices. The prices are no different than what you would pay for a fine-dining experience in Santa Barbara or Los Angeles, Sinatra is pure luxury in every sense.",

The tiramisu was excellent.  All in all an outstanding experience.  The only thing that could have been better was for the restaurant to 'validate' and eliminate the parking charge.",

I requested a window table, which they were able to accommodate.  It had a great view of the grounds right outside, which were beautiful.  If I had known that they seat people outdoors, I would have requested a table outside.  However, it was windy that night and the ambiance was nice enough inside anyhow.  Aside from the nice ambiance, the food and drinks were really good.  First came the bread basket and our drinks.  I ordered a non-alcoholic Sinatra Smash, which was fruity and refreshing, just what I like.  I highly recommend it!  For my entree, I had their Pennette, which I really enjoyed and also recommend.  To end my meal I had their chocolate dessert, which comes in the shape of a fedora hat.  I had to get that dessert for that reason alone - very Instagram worthy :p    Service was good, and overall it was a great dining experience.  Love the Sinatra touches as well, from the memorabilia at the entrance to the Sinatra movies playing at the bar.  Five stars all the way :)",

When open it really showcased just how noisy the main room was during our 7pm dinner.   Chicken over mashed potatoes was not different from home. The Osso Buco looked way better and got more raves.   Maybe it's better in the main room but this place just seemed bored with itself in a way you don't want or expect in Vegas.   If you can't convince yourself Sinatra's in the house, you're not gonna convince your diners either.",

I didn't have a problem getting a reservation a few days out and we were seated at our reservation time.  My first impression was that I really liked the ambiance of the restaurant. The decor was in line with what you'd expect from a restaurant named \"Sinatra\" and of course the music was good. The feel of the restaurant instantly makes you ready for a relaxing meal of good food and good drinks.   The service was as fantastic as you'd expect from a restaurant at The Wynn. They were efficient at refilling drinks and clearing the tables.   For my meal I had the chicken with gnocchi, mushrooms, and marsala sauce. Everything on the plate was prepared well and made for a nice, light dish that wasn't too heavy in flavor. My husband had his usual, veal parmesan which was very tasty. We shared polenta sticks which were flavorful and not excessively salty. For dessert I had the tiramisu which was prepared traditionally and with great flavor. My husband had a tart, lemon I believe that was even better than my dessert.   This is a great place to have a relaxing evening with friends or on a date night with your love.",

I liked it so much I went two nights in a row and ate the same thing, which I never do. The bone-in veal parmesan is fantastic. It is a pounded veal chop (very thin), lightly breaded and topped with just the right amount of cheese and a light red sauce. The chop literally covers the entire plate and you will be hard pressed to finigh it, but worth the try. Also tried some pasta and some other appetizers and everything was delicious. Also an extensive wine list with some reasonably priced choices. I recommend the Avongnesi Vino Nobile di Montepulciano. Very good bread basket as well...save room for the veal!",

He is an avid whiskey and bourbon drinker and was thrilled with both. I had the martini with the blood orange which was great as well.  We ordered two appetizers - the meatballs and the lump crab meat; both were well portioned and delicious. For entrees we had the scallops and venison loin; both were cooked perfectly!  For dessert we shared the Jack Daniels milk chocolate panna cotta with the dark chocolate fedora. It was both delicious and a work of art.

The lobster and shrimp were over cooked and I though he amount of time clams was excessive. The scallops were perfectly cooked. It was very good but I am glad it was company money and not my own.",

For entree we had the Veal Parm, and Bronzino.  The Veal was a little thin, but very tasty.  The Bronzino was cooked to perfection.  For desert, the Panna Cotta and the Cheesecake.  Panna Cotta was perfect, some places you notice the gelatin... not here.  The Cheesecake was the best I've had.  It was light and airy.  Highly recommend it.  Service was excellent, very attentive.",

Sinatra's is beautiful restaurant and every table is great. Ask for a window table, but don't worry, because they are all wonderful. The service is just fantastic. You are never rushed, but you are not ignored. We had the best time. We had the veal Milanese and I have to say it is the best we have ever had. Get it. Truly delicious.  Sinatra music plays quietly in the background. This is a fine dinning eatery, so please don't walk in there in shorts. If there is a bad table that is where you will be. It is pricey so I think of it as a special occasion dinner. We love it and so will you.",

With the large picture of Frank and his music playing softly in the backround you know your in his restaurant.   After being seated it did take quite a while for anyone to acknowledge us. No menus, no drink orders and no water service. Eventually someone in a suit (Sommellier?) came by to take our drink and wine orders. The menus and water service followed shortly after. The menu is classic italian; Antipasto, caprese, pastas, osso bucco, veal parm, etc. Our waiter was pretty quiet. The service was fine but nothing extraordinary or over the top which I would expect here.   The veal parm came highly recommended so I went with that. We also ordered a antipasto for the table and the panzanella con Granchio (lump blue crab, tomato and cucumber). Both appetizers were very good. The prosciutto and fresh buffalo mozzarella in the antipasto were excellent. The entrees arrived and the veal parm took up the entire plate, it was huge. It was covered in cheese and had the perfect amount of sauce. They also leave it on the bone which is a nice presentation. The veal was so tender and just melted in your mouth.   For dessert we had the gelato and the tiramisu. If you order gelato you get to choose 3 different flavors. We had Coconut, Hazelnut and Chocolate.The tiramisu was definately a better choice. The gelato was ok but served almost melted.   Overall an excellent dinner and dining experience.",

Our server, Joao, was wonderful, we were celebrating my birthday and we were greeted with a lovely card and a very warm welcome.   The meal was fabulous (as usual). We had an appetizer of prosciutto with pear, light and yummy. Hubby surprised me and got the special, which was a double pork chop with a red wine glaze, potato and asparagus - just delicious. I had the spaghetti with clams (as usual) so delicious.  The room is underrated, so warm. We were seated along the far wall in a booth, but although it was January, there is outdoor seating and with the heat lamps there were brave folks outside. Next time, I would request a table by the window, which gives the best of both worlds, the lovely inside decor and the outside seating with a fireplace.  We were treated to a delicious tiramisu for dessert, and a greeting from the chef, thanking us for choosing Sinatra to celebrate the special day - it could not have been a more wonderful experience!",

I left the table to pick up some tickets at will call for the show we were seeing and they said they would have gotten them for us! Our servers were so nice and every time they came to our table, they Called me by name.  The servers even asked if we were going to a show so they could ensure we would be done with dinner in time to get to the theater    The food was amazing, my mom and I split an entree, we had the pork chop special :)  We also ordered the beef carpaccio which was AMAZING!!!   We had lemon  cheese  cake  for dessert with raspberry gelato    I would recommend this place because it's fine dining and not too expensive (if you share). We could carry on a conversation without yelling over loud music or loud restaurant noise.   They played Sinatra songs all night (of course) and we really enjoyed the evening!",

I had the Ossobuco and my wife ordered the Arrabbiata off the vegan menu, both were delicious. We also really loved the Sinatra Smash cocktail which is their signature drink.

I was with a high roller regular so he pressed and the manager was dancing around us, afraid to speak the truth, so he said the outside was set up for a private birthday party.  Pressed harder, they finally gave us a table for four. The outside is lovely but inside is fantastic as well.  Our server Suzanne was spectacular. We had a ravioli truffle appetizer that was $115 and was decadent.  Suzanne is a professional server and took exceptional care of us. I don't remember what else was ordered but everyone was thrilled.  When we were finishing, we saw whom the special guest with the birthday was. They arrived after the entire restaurant was close but since it was an NBA star, they accommodated him. We had his table. Too bad lol.",

For starters, my group of 4 shared the Frank's Clams Posilipo: reminded me of a cioppino.  light and not overly salty.  I ordered the Milanese, and this thing was HUGE!  My portion of veal was literally bigger than my head, so I feel less bad about shelling out the 45 bucks for this dish.  The breading was very light and just right.  Not oily or greasy at all.    For dessert, we shared the tiramusu which was perfect to share among the 4 of us.  We also shared the capuccino over gelato (I don't recall what it was called on the menu) and this was delicious!!!  You've got to get it.  By no means was our meal \"cheap.\"  It was $101 each, but considering we also got two bottles of red and three of us got post-dinner coffee, the cost of the meal wasn't all that expensive.  If you are looking for a delicious meal in a nice setting, give Sinatra a try!",

The decor is beautiful and our table was against the large windows with a view of the outside garden area. The menus are cute too, each has a picture inside of Steven Wynn and Frank himself.  The service was impeccable beginning at the entrance of the restaurant. When I arrived the hostess handed me a handwritten birthday card, and throughout the entire dinner all the staff went out of their way to wish me a happy birthday.  The food was so delicious. Our party ordered nearly everything on the menu, including several bottles of chianti. One of the specials for the night was a black truffle pasta which was heavy but delicious. I had little bites of everything. The entree item I ordered was the pennette. Italian sausage ragu over pasta, amazing.  Desserts (panna cotta and tiramisu) came out with candles on them and \"happy birthday\" written in chocolate. I will post a pic here on Yelp. It was a fantastic ending to a wonderful meal.  I'm very much looking forward to my next experience at Sinatra.",

Mr. Wynn goes above and beyond that he has the highest quality of both food and ingredients in throughout his resorts.   I had the scallops for dinner, they were ok. They need to improve on the scallops. My wife had the ciopinno, and I had it during a previous visit. That dish is a must have... it is to die for.  All of the staff were on the highest standards of service.  I will always go to Sinatra when I go to Vegas. I only stay at the Wynn Resort because it is the finest in the region.  Mr. Wynn doesn't play games... He is the Walt Disney of adult Disney...VEGAS! He wants nothing but the best for his visitors.",

So to start, this is an excellent place for a fancy-pants meal and it's sure to satisfy any vegan along with their carnivorous counterparts.  If you're vegan be sure to request the vegetarian menu, there are a plethora of options.  And to start, our waitress brought over a bread basket with real butter (for the bf) and vegan butter (for me) and she even let me know which breads I could eat - hooray because I always have to eat bread without butter at restaurants.  Next came my appetizer, the heirloom tomato soup...it was creamy (I think with cashews), flavored well, and down-right delectable!  But the winner of the evening was the entree, the Agnolotti.  It's basically little pockets filled with vegan ricotta and herbs topped with asparagus sauce, yes, asparagus sauce!!!  I'd never had asparagus sauce in my life until Sinatra, and let me tell you, I'm a fan.  A trip to Vegas is not complete without a visit to Sinatra, I'll be back!",

They will go out of their way to make sure you are fully satisfied.  Chef Theo has thought up the perfect menu. The truffle risotto is a favorite of mine - they use only the best ingredients. I always start the shrimp cocktail - the shrimp are HUGE and so fresh. For dessert, the chocolate mousse is so rich and comes in the shape of Sinatra's hat. Their tiramisu is the best I've ever had. They have an amazing wine list and the staff is truly well-trained to know what they are talking about.  They offer patio seating with fireplaces, fans, and dim lighting. It is almost like you are sitting in a garden because the landscape around the seating area is so lush and well-kept.  5 stars for food, service, quality, drinks, atmosphere, menu options, etc...  You cannot go wrong eating here.",

Sinatra or Rat Pack music playing at the perfect level. We had a great view of the garden/patio out back. The menu was really solid. The bread selection was really good- even the gluten free for my wife. I had the filet, which was cooked to perfection. We ordered a glass of Pinot and it was extremely smooth. The dessert menu was ample. The drinks totally appropriate for the Sinatra theme. The restaurant was not full when we arrived at 7 but filling up quickly so make reservations. Finally, the service was really consistently good. We will definitely make this a place to stop next time we are in town.",

The restaurant itself sits tucked away in corner, not some place that's center of a casino and a tourist trap. The hosts girls are extremely polite with charm. If your table isn't ready, have a cocktail at the bar. Once your seated in dining room the experience begins. Simple but Great menu. Wait staff can direct you toward your appetite. The appetizer meatballs are excellent. I got the Veal Parm, which they are known for, and it did not disappoint. Had a side of penne to assist. For dessert had the lemon ricotta cheesecake. Was a no brain choice. This place is amazing. The dining room itself has class and character. It's not done Sinatra shrine, as the lone images are a big photo in dining room, the bar, and the menu displays a beautiful logo. The dining room is a spectacular area in its own right. Highly recommend this place! A beautiful tribute of a restaurant for a great man!",

    "text": "So, once upon a time, I ate a large amount of Italian food. In fact, I ate so much of it that I was no longer interested in having it - ever.  Therefore, it was quite a surprise to me when, upon browsing through the food recommendation section of the Encore Hotel & Casino entertainment book this past weekend, that my gaze settled upon a little place called \"Sinatra\" - and I wanted to go there!  My date and I arrived and of course, since it was a Sunday, I didn't make reservations. There simply isn't a need and this was in fact evident based on the number of folks there.  For pre-dinner drinks we selected The Dream - a signature cocktail - and a glass of sauvignon blanc. Nothing special here.  I've been on an appetizer kick lately, sampling only appetizers. I feel this allows me to sample the most items and I can also closely meter how much food I'm eating.   We started with a lovely basket of parmesan breadsticks, parmesan flatbread, and whole wheat bread. It was good, but honestly, nothing special.   After we moved on to the mains.   Polpettine - housemade meatballs with polenta fries. The housemade meatballs were OK. Ikea meatballs are slightly better IMO, but....THE POLENTA FRIES! They were soooo good. In fact, I would order this dish again in a heartbeat just for them.  Frank's Clams Posilipo - clams in tomato sauce with garlic and oregano. Delicious. Exactly what I expected. Flawlessly executed.   My date got the Agnolotti, which is small pasta pockets filled with bufala ricotta, herbs, asparagus sauce. It was rich, but truly sublime. Small pockets of pasta, with a delicate sauce, that explode perfectly in your mouth as you eat them.   Due to the fact that we had bottle service somewhere after we declined to eat further, but I can only imagine. I expect to be back here in December when I return to the Encore.",

There are just 6 tables outside in the garden area and there are heaters and a firepit/fireplace that help to keep the chill off.   For starters we had the Polpettini ..(the housemade meatballs with polenta fries) and the Panzanella con Granchio ... (jumbo lump blue crab, brioche croutons, tomato,  cucumber, tomato fonduta) .. both appetizers were presented beautifully and were quite tasty. There were nice sized morsels of the crab which complemented the Panzanella very well. The only thing I really didn't care for were the polenta fries which I found to be a bit on the bland side.  Then came the main course .. my dinner partner ordered the Lasagna Bolognese (fresh pasta layered with veal, pork and beef ragu) which he said was almost as good as his mom's. :) I chose the Veal Parmigiana (thinly pounded veal chop, melted mozzarella, pomodoro sauce) .. which ended up being gigantic. It was perfectly seasoned and prepared, just the right amount of breading, sauce and cheese. DELICIOUS! It was every bit as delicious for lunch the next day as well.   Even though we were both stuffed after the entrees, we definitely wanted to try dessert and boy were we glad. The Tiramisu was spectacular and we both quickly forgot how full we were :) ..   The service was fast and the server knowledgeable and professional. She and her team did a great job efficiently without being overbearing. Kudos to Sinatra for a great all around dining experience and we will certainly be back soon!",

Could have made more tasty food ourselves.  Very underwhelmed, definitely would not go again and would not recommend.  Also, they were running behind so we weren't seated until over 15 minutes after our reservation.  That would have been fine if the food was good but it was definitely not worth the wait.",

    "text": "I had some girlfriends in town for a vacation weekend; we made reservations here before seeing Le Reve.    I stopped by a day or two ahead of the reservation just to confirm it (I had made the reservation online via a third-party reservation site) and the hostesses were friendly and polite.    When we showed up for our dinner, they were just as friendly--very professional.  In fact, the entire staff that we interacted with were great.  Everyone was smiling and helpful.    The food was Ah-may-zing.  I had cioppino, one friend had one of the specials (I think it was filet and truffled mashed potatoes that will haunt your dreams--they are that good), and the other had the fish special (I forget only because I was so in love with the cioppino).    We sat on the patio, the weather was beautiful, and the service was perfect.  Great dining experience!",

    "text": "Service is outstanding at this place.  We both felt very welcomed the moment we walked into the restaurant.  The staff remembered we were there for special occasion and offered us complimentary dessert at the end.  Our wait staff was very responsive and professional.  Appetizers were great and i feel they were even much better than main course for taste and presentation.  For the entree,  hubby's lamb chop carried no salt while my veal chop had uneven seasoning on the surface.  However, when hubby brought up the issue on the mashed potato, the server immediately fixed it and apologized.  Again, the service there is awesome.  We had a wonderful time and believed the entree wasn't perfect cos it was busy labor day weekend.",

The food was divine & the sauce with scallops was from another planet. The restaurant is beautiful with a comfortable amount of space between tables. Absolute perfection! + they actually have roses in a gimlet glass (for the roses +gimlet connoisseurs)...If vacationing in Vegas, this is an absolute must go to place..I can't wait to return to Sinatra's! Out of this world delicious!!! Outstanding , absolute perfection!",

    "text": "I reserved the Sinatra for a work dinner about a month before CES, and if I were paying for the meal out of my own pocket it would have been pretty disappointing. I had one of two vegetarian options: a butternut squash pasta pocket (there's a better Italian word for this) in a brown butter and sage sauce. The sauce was completely flavorless, unfortunately. Butter + sage should make me want to lick the plate, especially at $30 a plate; this made me bored and still hungry. The wine selections, breads, and the \"skinny\" panna cotta were pretty good, though. Classy service redeemed the food a bit -- turns out I like my chair being pulled out for me -- and the ambiance is charming, with Sinatra films playing in the bar.",
