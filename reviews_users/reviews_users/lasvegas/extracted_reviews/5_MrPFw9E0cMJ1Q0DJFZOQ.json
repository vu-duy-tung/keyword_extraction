Going on a football Sunday, be prepared for lots of games, and lots of volume! It is hard to have a conversation, but I guess if you're going to watch games, cheer loudly, and drink- this is your place! I actually liked the long table at the front- it is seat yourself, and the design of it makes it easy to meet new people as you eat.  The food- somewhat overpriced, but decent enough. Wings, big burgers, sandwiches. The service was a little slow, but considering that it was so busy, it was understandable. There are a few other places I'd try at the Linq before returning, but I wouldn't go out of my way to avoid it, either.",

The place was a sports bar with nice selection of burguers and that kind of food you normally eat while you have a beer in your hand and a football match infront of you.  Tilted kilt is kind of crowded, what makes the service a little slow, so if you don't like sports you should find a different place to go, food is not that bad and they got a good selection in beers (Bottle or draft), and the plus that waitresses are dressed whit short school skirts and tight blouses with huge necklines that shows more of this girls attitude, i'm definitely coming back, because of the beer and the sports obviously.",

On entry, all the waitstaff were dressed in little cute outfits and would definitely tempt in red blooded male to dine & maybe stay for a little longer than normal (also give a higher tip than normal).  Our waitress was as nice as pie but also cute as a button. She was very helpful & friendly.  The food was great too, however I would suggest that this place offer some sauces such as aioli to go with the fries as they were fairly boring.  Would definitely return and not just for the cute waitresses as my wife has suggested.",

After being seated we waited for about ten minutes before being approached by our server, with the girls just standing around talking. Ordered a Bloody Mary, had to return it, it seemed like they poured a can of salt. Asked for a Guineas as a replacement and after about 5 minutes I finally got it. The servers outfits are nice and fit the Vegas attire, pretty girls with great bodies but they lack customer service. We ordered a half rack of ribs, it was OK. Overall poor customer service, but if you want some good eye candy it's the spot.",

Sat at the bar and chatted it up with a lovely kilt girl named Jean. She was very accommodating and made me feel welcome.  I drank for an hour and a half to kill time and watched sports on the many TVs on the walls. For a Tuesday morning this place was pretty busy with tourists.  The upstairs portion seems to be seats going around a railing and had no tables whatsoever.  That was a bummer.  Overall, a good time and Jean was a cool chick to chat with.",

Without any of these three things, it's just any old place to eat.   This is a great location with great foot traffic, dragged down by no craft beer, and a bored staff.  In the city known for its endless supply of beautiful women, TK managed to not hire a single one of them.  Many locations pride themselves on their connection to local craft breweries offering some of the best beers from local suppliers. I like to come to TKs then I travel to try the local beers in the lovely TK environment. This location missed this opportunity completely.  With two strikes against them, all that's left is the food. It was fine. Nothing extraordinary but fine.  As much as I really wanted to have a good time and enjoy this location; it wasn't possible given it's obvious shortcomings.  I can't recommend this location. Try harder and I might try it again the next time I am in town.",

My boyfriend and I ordered 2 fat tires, and it took a while to get them, but we were distracted by the game. When we received it, I thought the glasses was HUGE! At least compared to other places.  The waitresses are extremely nice, however, I noticed a few just standing around by the entrance just chatting, when instead they could be helping the customers.  We did not order anything to eat because as busy as it is, we did not feel like waiting.  Once the game was over, a lot of people just left the pub. There was hardly anyone in there. We ordered another 2 fat tires and just pretty relaxed and enjoyed watching the television.   When it was time to get our check, the waitress took almost 30 minutes to get it to us. About 17 minutes in, she came back and said she forgot what we needed.  It would be understandable if the pub was still packed, but it wasn't.",

With this being said we ordered our entire meal all at once, after taking our drink order it took her 15 more minutes to bring the 2 waters and sprite that we had ordered. Alex or Alice the light skin Latina.. was nice but just not on top of it... being someone that works in the service industry and knowing that the venue was not at all busy yet at this time just makes it very disappointing. Good thing we no longer have this establishment in San Diego and now we know why... next time I'll go to Hooters for my wings at least they're a bit quicker when bring my water and actually seem Like they want to be at their job.

I didn't order any food but my friends who grabbed some grub weren't particularly fond of it (we ended up going to another bar and eating more food there).  The servers were cute and friendly though it was extremely busy that night and they weren't around very often to check up on our huge party.    This place has a pretty big bar area and also a large second floor to accommodate a large number of patrons.  The bathroom here was kind of cool though.    There's just too many place in Vegas to get drunk at.  Unless you happen to be in this particular area, I would say you're better of checking out the countless number of other bars and lounges at your disposal.",

I know Mgm properties are always a good time and their employees are well known for friendliness . Needless to say we won't be going back to the Link any time soon because I've also had a terrible experience at Chayo and Margaritaville.

    "text": "So disappointed.  Being a new place at The Linq - trying to get tourists and locals in, you would think this place would be jamming.  Very empty.  Girls are just okay - Sorry, Twin Peaks girls are way more friendly and (I'm a happily married gal) and hotter!  Tilted girls were super young - there for a paycheck and could care less about who you were.   Food:  Chicken tender wrap w/fries - regular bar food - nothing special.  Same with the burgers.  I had the chicken tenders with fries and got broken up pieces of chicken - not even full, long, big tenders - plate looked like a child's portion.  Very disappointing.  Drinks - someone had a Moscow mule said it was okay.  Beers are beers, I had a simple vodka and club soda - think it was just soda.  Seriously - you are on the strip, make a decent drink.  Atmosphere - music way to loud for eating - you are screaming at each other.  The bar seemed hopping so maybe just sit there next time - but pass on getting a table and eating there.  So not worth the money.",

    "text": "Worst customer service experience ever.   Bad service from the get go. Walked up to the front and 3 hosts standing there. No smiles or even a greeting. We were the first to speak and we said \"for 2\". Because they just stared at us. Pretty rude. The blonde girl walked us to the table, silent and seemed as she could care less. Then our server was alright until we were finished with our food and drinks and didn't receive our check until 30 min after we were finished. It was also the Tuesday block party so there are specials at all the restaurants and shops and for tilted kilt it's 20% entire check. We received our check and of course there is no discount on there. So when the server came by to pick up the check we asked where is the 20% off discount and she replied in shock, \"ooh yeah I can do that for you.\" So I suggest if you are coming in for their specials for the Tuesday block party you ask!! I'm sure she was hoping we didn't know about the 20% off.   We ordered off the hoppy hour menu. The prices are good. Range from $2-$4 appetizers. Food was decent.   Holy hell the beer is damn expensive. They have better deals at other bars at the linq. 32 for 3 beers and 2 were summer shandy?! The beer was more expensive than our food. You would think happy hour being the beer as well. Better off going to yard house. Better prices and better service!",

I won't go back, other venues right across the courtyard are less than half the price for beer, and let's face it, that's why we go out.",

The ladies at the hostess table were very nice and told us where we could sit.  We chose a spot looking out into the shopping area.  After patiently waiting for about 15 minutes without ANY service, we asked the bartender what was going on and he informed us that nobody serves that General area (thanks ladies for the heads up)  He showed us where we could sit to receive service and we even talked to a waitress who saw where we were sitting and STILL another 10-15 minutes, NO service.  Being a local and a server, I understand if it's a packed house for service to be slower than usual, but we weren't even acknowledged and there were plenty of staff standing around. Super disappointed because I've been wanting to check this place out. Definitely won't come back. Too many other options available in Las Vegas.",

We were all very tired and hungry. The Waitress Danielle greeted us and engaged us in conversation. She made food recommendations and truly took us from Fatigue to laughter. It no longer felt like a quick pit stop for some food to a great time , being entertained. We had wonderful food, fantastic service and just had the very best time. Everyone in our party loved Danielle so much. the table next to us said the same thing as we became one big party together. Because of her we came the next day too, for drinks. We asked for her and stayed long enough that drinks turned into dinner. The Tilted Kilt is a really nice sports bar. Danielle made our night an Event. We will ask for her everytime we are in las Vegas now. What a great time. Love the kilt. Can`t wait to go back!!!!!",

I definitely would have been upset if I payed full price for the small portions. It's not difficult being a waitress, but the girl who served us seemed to not get it. Every table around us was waiting on something and trying to get her attention. She'd check on one table, leave then come back for another table, making her workload seem a lot more stressful than if she would have just checked on every table at the same time. I asked her for waters for both myself and my friend and she took my glass then came back and asked my friend if she needed some. Apparently she could only do one thing at a time. Was more annoying than fun. Go to Twin Peaks around the corner instead, hot staff, better food and better service.",

So we waited outside on a bench for the fight to be over. After it was and people started to leave, we went to go get a table. Despite the restaurant being four-fifths empty at this point, all of the tables were unbussed and four hostesses were standing at the check-in booth doing nothing but talking the whole 30 minutes of our wait before we were able to be seated. With no place to sit, we had to uncomfortably stand, watching unbussed tables and talkative hostesses. There seemed to be one or two servers that looked like they were actually working hard, other than the bartenders. When we finally were seated, our experience improved. I don't remember the name of our server (she said she had only been there 3 weeks or 3 months with around 2 years experience serving) but she gave excellent service. Unfortunately the liquor that I ordered was out but the fries were able to be cooked in fresh oil and the drinks were delicious. Our server was extremely attentive, friendly and helpful. Definitely look forward to returning next time we are in the area.",

The server explained the menu was updated due to change of management.   One of our orders was the Shepherd's Pie, which looked nothing like the photo in the menu nor any of the photos people have posted on Yelp. The server again explained it had something to do with the updated menu. If they're going to update a menu, the least they could do is update the photo and price accordingly. It was in a shallow mini cast iron skillet about an inch tall, filled halfway up, and about 5-6\" in diameter. My bf doesn't ever want to complain about his food so I didn't embarrass him by taking a photo of it, but it was the saddest Shepherd's Pie I had ever seen. He was still hungry after taking his 6 bites of food, and all the server could offer is ask if we wanted to order more food. No, not after spending $14.00 on this.   We expressed our dismay but she didn't seem concerned at all, didn't offer to call a manager over. In fact, the manager didn't come to our table to verify our discount as shown in our phone app. The server wanted to take our phone away to bring it to the manager. Never, ever, take a customer's unlocked phone. Our server was full of smiles, but smiling cutely at disappointed customers does not make good service. It was a pretty dismal dinner and we don't plan on returning. Too bad Tilted Kilt -- you have great potential in a great location. New management, I hope you're listening.",

    "text": "Tasted like food from Applebees with the ambiance of a Hooters.  Actually that's a diss to Applebee's as their food has actually gotten better and it's a better value. We ordered the sampler ($14) and it came with 4 boneless chix bites, 4 skinny mozzarella sticks, fried pickles and 1 tasteless pretzel bread. We weren't impressed as ive tasted better mozzarella sticks from the freezer section of Costco.  Lol.   We decided to split an entree to save us both a disappointment and share in the misery. We got the BBQ pork Mac and cheese. It sounded good. Something you'd hear on diner, drives and dives. Well it wasn't very good. At all. BBQ sauce was sweet, pork was flavorless, the macaroni was chewy and the cheese sauce tasted like that cheese pack you get in the Kraft box.   As a plus they have daily drink specials...tequila Tuesdays and so forth and two happy hours. Server was nice, but don't expect service that excels. We didn't eat more than a few bites of the entree and the server didn't bother to ask why.  We wont be back. Yard house at least has good food.",

    "text": "You'd think that every guy would enjoy coming to a pub with female servers dressed in short plaid skirts, crop tops (or whatever they are called), and push up bras to show cleavage. It's not just about that. Good food and great service is what matters.  I came here with my friends for Happy Hour, and we almost ordered the entire Happy Hour menu! I think we might have. We were initially skeptical about the Buffalo Chips because it's just potato chips with a buffalo chicken dip, but our server highly recommended that, so we got it. Lucky we did because the dip was very, very tasty and delicious. We ended up dipping all our other stuff in that dip. Sadly, that was the best part of the meal.  The Boneless Wings weren't very good. It was prepared poorly with the batter all over the place and not even fully on the chicken, and it was bland and overcooked. Pretty disappointing.  We ordered the Sliders, which was a total rip-off. $4 for ONE little slider that looked like a hamburger from McDonalds, but even smaller and more flat? No thank you. There was barely any meat inside the two flattened buns that's just pulled out of the plastic bag to even care to type out any description.  I can throw in the steak skewers in the same category as the sliders. It was so bad that I shouldn't waste my time typing it out. All I need to say was that the beef was bland and way overcooked. Just awful.  The fried mozzarella were soft and mushy, not crispy at all. The cheese is already soft and mushy, so having the batter the same way isn't very good.  We ordered a couple of those Spring rolls, which I didn't eat, but my friends did not like it what-so-ever, and it was a rip-off as well.  The fries were pretty good though. Nicely fried to a crisp and well-seasoned.  The service was okay. When the server was at our table, she was friendly and helpful, but that's only when she was at out table, which was not often.  Overall, I didn't care much about the food that was overpriced and poorly portioned, especially for a Happy Hour. The service was friendly, but lacked attentiveness. I don't plan to return here on my next visit. Sorry, those short skirts, crop tops, and push up bras with cleavage hanging out won't make me come back. Plus, gentlemen don't stare.",

    "text": "I said in my first review that I probably wouldnt be coming back but guess what, I did and I am bumping it up one star for the food.  Getting straight to the important stuff.  We ordered: -Classic traditional wings w/garlic fries -Sweet potato fries -Spinach Chicken Salad -SpicySouthwest Chicken Wrap w/colelsaw  -BBQ Chicken pizza  The wings were good and I liked that they were saucey but not to the point that they were drowning in it.  It came with celery and ranch but no carrots :(  The garlic fries it came out with though, sooooo damn good and garlic-y! YUM.  They were seriously like the definition of perfection and I seriously could not stop eating them.     Sweet potato fries were also really good.  They were definitely different from how they are usually served as they were crinkle cut fries and I really appreciated that they weren't soggy or super soft like how crinkle cut fries usually are.  It was crispy on the outside but soft on the inside.  Perfect when dipped in ranch or ketchup.  My friends ordered the Spinach Chicken Salad to share which came with a citrus mustard vinagarette dressing that was really unique but tasty.  The salad consisted of fresh spinach, grilled chicken, hard-boiled eggs, chopped bacon, dried cranberries and bleu cheese crumbles.  Everything paired very well with each other and it is definitely a salad I'd recommend ordering.  My boyfriend and I shared the Spicy Southwest Chicken wrap again because thats his favorite thing at Tilted Kilt.  It was consistent with my first time trying it and a dish I'd still recommend to others.  It's light but filling!  I really appreciate the fact that they use just the right amount of dressing in the wrap and consisted of a good ratio of salad to chicken. The wrap also comes with your choice of fries, potato chips or coleslaw.  We opted for the coleslaw since we already had 2 baskets of fries.  It's a small portion of coleslaw but I didn't mind since I was already getting full from the other stuff.  The BBQ chicken pizza was your standard BBQ chicken pizza.  Nothing stood out about it but it wasn't bad; it was just average.  Nothing much to say about it.  The service this time was better than last as all the girls working greeted us upon entering and our server made sure to check up on us from time to time.  The food however, did take quite awhile to come out but it was understandable since we were here during the Fight Weekend and it was much more busier than usual.",

I've been to their competitors, you know the one with the two peaks, and their food and customer service is great compared to this place.  I ordered the queso dip, which was not cheesy at all.  It was so chunky it was almost disgusting to eat.  I then had the pub pretzels which were actually delicious but the cheese sauce and the mustard sauce overpowered the pretzel and had such a packaged flavor that I ate the pretzels plain.  The food was some of the worst food I've ever had on the strip.    You can come here to look at girls dressed slutty and have a good time, but don't expect to come here for a good meal.  It's a shame because if they actually invested in having a well executed menu they could do really well with their location.  The only reason I giving it 2 stars and not 1 is because the pretzel was actually good alone.",

It's definitely a sports bar kind of place so it can get pretty noisy but if you're interested in watching sports while you eat they have them all over the restaurant so you'll have a good view for that.

I feel like I'm a pretty picky/opinionated person with high standards for restaurants and I was floored by the food and service at this place.  My girlfriend and I came stumbling in here after a show at the Brooklyn Bowl. We were both amazed by how good the food was. I ordered a flat bread pizza and my girlfriend ordered buffalo strips. Now, flat bread pizza and buffalo strips are staple crops to our diets (sadly) and we've eaten a lot of pizza/chicken in our lifetimes. That said, the pizza was absolutely delicious and the buffalo strips were, hands down, the best buffalo strips we have ever had.   While I am not a fan of restaurants that have their waitresses dress a little skimpy, the service at this place was great as well. Considering that the place was loud and full of drunk people. our waitress was able to take our orders and give attention to our table effortlessly. We were able to order, eat and pay without any issues.  Please open a Tilted Kilt in San Jose :)",

We came here because of the no wait time which Yardhouse was on a 15 min wait.  We might have chosen wrong.  The place is a nice pub with all high seating but the tables had to many items on them and made it hard for 3 people to sit.  Our server was Julianne and she was very friendly and nice.  The women dress like school girls and it might be a little over done for a place to enjoy food.  We ordered the \"Irish Nachos\" where HORRIBLE!  They were made of pub cheese and just meat. Avoid the nachos because you will be sad like I was! They were not worth any amount of money.  I had the \"Spicy Mother Clucker\" which was good sandwich and the french fries were nothing special.  Overall my experience was just ok.  I would not come back due to the fact the food was nothing special and the server was just average.   I got the feeling this place will not last long.",

The prices are good especially for being on the strip in the linq promenade. The atmosphere was fun and the views of the promenade were nice.

    "text": "So, Tilted Kilt...  I have passed by other branches of this franchise numerous times in Atlanta, and have been meaning to try it for years.  With the premise being a classier version of Hooter's, how can you go wrong?  The occasion finally comes in the form of a bachelor party, as a few of my friends from Chicago make their way to Vegas for their own version of Hangover.    We meet up at Caesar's and cross the street to the Linq, and they're impressed with the short strip of entertainment.  We wait just a bit (10 minutes or so) for a table, and get seated by one of the girls.  Positives:  Girls are really nice, from the hosts up front to our server.  There are TVs everywhere for the games, and every spot is a good spot for watching.  Food comes fast, and they are pretty good - wings, flatbreads, and garlic fries.  The have Smithwick's on tap!  Negatives:  Girls don't quite reach our expectations from physical-standpoint, and are not as social as Hooter's.  Food is only pretty good, not great.  They don't have Boddington's, or at least our server didn't know what it was so I assume they don't.    While we had light fare this evening, we did drink and it only came out to about $30 each including tips.  This indeed is couple notches above Hooter's, and to me a more enjoyable place to watch the games because of their much more diverse food and drink options.  If it wasn't so far from my house (and if it wasn't in the middle of the strip), I'd probably come here more often.  3.5 stars overall I think, but since I can't give that and I'm still on the fence about it, I'll bump it down.  Table-for-1 Factor:  Large bar, but do you really want to sit here by yourself?",

The burgers were amazing. I really didn't think it would be that good but to my surprise they were cooked just right and had the perfect flavor. I'll definitely be coming here again in the future.",

This sports bar is cool because of all the numerous tv's. You can basically watch any sport in here! If it's not on one of the screens, ask them to change!  One of the managers, ivory, hooked us up this past Thursday night! We called beforehand and he reserved a large table for us and had the Dodger/Angel game (as requested) on several tv's around that table. We had a party of ten and it worked out great!  Bathrooms are upstairs near the entrance and the upstairs area was cool too. Had tv's around a bar like sitting area up there. Nobody was sitting up there but you could have some privacy if you wanted to. But no bartenders or servers up there I don't think. At least I didn't see any. A fun place to hang out.",

Anyway, it is just a typical bar serving typical pub food.  Food was not bad, just nothing to write home about.  BF got the Boston Burger, asked for MR got MW to W.  He said the taste was good though.  I got the Irish Dip (French Dip) which tasted just like a French Dip I could order anywhere.  We did get the pretzels, which were good - soft and not too much salt, but the cheese dip left a lot to be desired.   With my water and his lemonade, the total bill tip and all was $50.  I can't imagine what it would be if we had ordered drinks.  I agree with what others say in that, yes, drink prices on the Strip are typically higher, but these were way out of line with the norm.  We probably won't go back, as it isn't worth dealing with the Strip crowds to go.",

No offense to him, he was a very good bartender and knowledgeable on beers, but I can find that at hundreds of other places in town. I wanted to see cute girls!!!!  The 3 stars is because their selection of beverages, while eclectic, is pretty routine and lacks a good Hefeweizen.

    "text": "I came here the other night for the first time as we had some friends visiting and we always go to Yardhouse so we wanted to try something new.  I truly wasn't impressed.  We sat down and the whole experience was rushed.  The server kept coming to our table too quickly and only half of us were ready to order.    We ordered a few beers and I had an ancho chile margarita.  Our server didn't fill my water glass once and I drink a lot of water.    We then ordered.  I got the Fried Egg Burger with a side of the Mac & Chz, 2 others got black bean burgers, and we all shared the sampler to start.  The sampler took forever to come out.  It was truly mediocre at best.  It was a bunch of over fried stuff.  When our food came out the Mac & chz was not hot at all.  I will say, the server was nice and got us a new one.    I couldn't tell if it was her fault or if they had her working too many tables but she was just all over the place and seemed to have too many people to take care of.  I think this would be a good place to go have drinks and watch a game at the bar but anything beyond that you're better off at Yardhouse in the same area!",

The atmosphere was OK, and of course the ladies were all beautiful. So if you're in the area it's definitely worth stopping in.",

Great thing about Vegas, go across the way and spend your money at Virgil's BBQ!!

I sat there for 7 minutes, with only 5 other people at the bar and two bartenders, and was ignored.  So I got out, went out to the door and asked to be seated at a table because the bartender had been ignoring me and two other guys that sat at the bar individually after I did.   The girl seated me, and even though I was in a direct line of sight of three girls who were standing at the bar chatting with each other, I was ignored for another eight minutes.  One of the three even walked around and checked in with two tables in my vicinity drag had already been served, but still ignored me.  After 9 minutes of being ignored at a table, I just got up and left.  It's 4:30pm in the afternoon, the staff on the first floor outnumbered patrons, yet they couldn't even be bothered to acknowledge me.  So I went across the way to Virgil's and had what I believe was a superior meal based on my past Kilt experiences here in Vegas!",

I appreciate the fact that Greg called me 3 times to make sure he got our party description right, where we were sitting and able to tell us what we had with us.

    "text": "Tilted Kilt is located in the Linq Promenade. We were strolling around looking for a snack and some good beers so we stopped in. The place is pretty nice, very big and is open to the promenade so you can enjoy the fresh air and do some people watching. Lots of TV's for catching the latest sports. And of course, the waitresses are nice to look at.   The bad part is the beer selection and the food. They have a ton of beers, but it's all the standard large brewery (12 variations of Budweiser, Coors, Miller, etc) stuff. Lagunitas' IPA was the most extreme on the menu. That's not a show stopper, because hey, I like me some Lagunitas, but the food was sad. We ordered some fried pickles to start and we got a tiny portion of pickles, spread out over the plate really thin in an apparent attempt to make it look like a normal sized order. It was like that's all that was left and they didn't want to drop more into the fryer. Pathetic. We decided not to order anything else. We split and went to eat somewhere else.   So if you just want to see some pretty girls in short skirts, maybe this place is worth the stop, otherwise walk on by and check out some of the other bars in the area. We won't be coming back.",

So when I said that I need a table for 2. the ladie said it was going to be a few minutes for a table to open up. Then a guy (I think Manager) came and told me that they would not have a open table for about 90 minutes. That is a huge difference from a few minutes.  they don't have any seating outside.  After that experience I am never going to go back to the Tilted Kilt. I am even thinking of writing to the company about the Un-Customer Service. By the way this was on 4th of July.",

The whole ambiance of The Linq is puts off a perfect roam outdoor dining district, sporting numerous bars, restaurants, and shopping. Located right on the middle of the strip, with one of Las Vegas biggest attractions, The worlds tallest observation wheel, the tilted kilts overall is a must visit. Great food, service, numerous TV's showing sports, and a great outdoor view. Ashley our server was great, extremely friendly, building relationships with us as we dined. Thank you Ashley so much!!!!  All the staff was always friendly, smiling and greeting us. As a casino industry executive I can honestly say that The Tilted Kilt offers friendly service, great food, and a perfect strip location.",

    "text": "I feel very conflicted in writing this review, but I think it needs to be written. Our party arrived at 4:30pm in order to get a good view of the TVs for Game 5 of the Stanley Cup Finals.  The good: Food. Everything we ordered came out cooked well and tasted fantastic. The beer cheese? AMAZING. Pulled Pork? Fantastic. After ordering fries from the happy hour menu (more on this later), it took about 20 minutes to get them. Our server gave us a second order at no charge. That's really where the \"good\" ends.  The bad: They didn't have ANY drinks available for happy hour! What kind of bar, new or old, doesn't have drinks available for happy hour?! It's on the menu, but they \"haven't figured out the pricing for it yet.\" So you still pay Strip prices for alcohol. This was a huge disappointment that they hopefully fix very soon.  The UGLY: After being there for a couple hours (3 periods, plus intermissions and OT), someone decided to change the channel in the middle of the OT period. We waited for about 2 minutes before we bailed on our check and ran down the way to Yard House who had the game on. We did come back to pay our check and watch the second OT period, but they had split up our table and didn't put the game back on the TV we had been watching. Our server apologized, but the only comment we received from management was \"you should've stayed. They got the game back on,\" met with a chuckle. As a Kings fan, during the eventual Cup winning game, I felt this was very rude and a little bit disrespectful.  I won't trust Tilted Kilt LV to air any professional sport in its entirety from here out. I understand it could have been a freak incident, but to cause customers and fans to potentially miss the game winning goal and NOT APOLOGIZING is pathetic. They are lucky we were honest people that came back to pay the check. Get your issues hashed out and put booze on the happy hour menu and MAYBE I'll change my star rating. Until then, I won't recommend this place to anyone.",

From sit down to walking out the door I have never had a waitress act the way that ours did. Her name was \"Ash\" and I hope she sees this and takes it as a learning experience. Walking up to the table and rolling your eyes, not responding, and being blatantly rude to customers when we are simply taking drink orders... Not ok, but with me personally she got mad that I had given her a military i.d. Because the birthday is located on the back. In sorry you needed to turn it over? Then when she brought out our drinks, she hit one of the other guests while putting a drink down, did not apologize. Then spilled someone else's drink all over my lap and in my purse- again without apologizing (now see I personally am not upset about the spilling, accidents happen. But the trick is to be polite and at least get some napkins). Then waited 30minutes for our food. As I said the food wasn't bad. But when it came time for the bills, I paid in cash and was expecting my change (yes at this point I was expecting to tip her because again sometimes people just have bad days) she brings out everyone else's change and receipts. But does not give me mine, and when I asked for it she got mad and rolled her eyes, stormed off, brought back a couple bills- no recipt, not even the right change amount. And threw it I front of me. At this point- no, I will not leave a good tip. Are you kidding me? If you act like you hate your job so much I do not know why you do it. Again I hope she sees this and next time won't act this way to customers who haven't done anything to her. I will never go here again, I was so let down because I have heard such wonderful things, but they were wrong!",

    "text": "Fun atmosphere and looks are all this place has to offer. The food was sub par and the service was horrible from the start. Girl seating us was not at all friendly or greeting.  We waited approximately 8-10 min before being seen by our waitress. Drinks went empty 2x and delay in food was 40-45 min for our burgers. We had to go get utensils from another table on our own. Wife ordered well done. The burger was closer to medium with alot of pink inside. The portion of fries was a McDonald's small at best. My burger was uneventful but not bad. The elderly woman behind us had a drink spilled on her by the staff (accidents happen and the guy that spilled it was very apologetic) it soaked her, her purse and the table. The couple had to clean it up mostly by themselves as the staff had to take off to get napkins (approx 5 min) I overheard the manager offer them a lousy 20% discount. The couple was just eager to leave. The manager offered to remove my wife's burger from the tab (which about 90% of the burger remained uneaten) which is the reason for the second star. It sounds like im just trying to trash the place but this was honestly our entire experience.  I'd recommend both Hooters and Twin Peaks over this place if looking for similar atmosphere.   The poor management completely dropped the ball with hiring this staff. Great location and concept but failed to deliver in every aspect of customer service.",

    "text": "This place is gross.   I've been here an unfortunate two times while visiting the LINQ. The first time I went with a few girlfriends to grab dinner and drinks. The food took a long time to come out (over 45 minutes) and when it finally did, the wings I ordered were cold. I let the server know and she took the wings back. I think they popped the entire thing in the microwave because it came out looking the same and luke warm instead of cold. I wasn't happy about it and they were accommodating enough to take it off of our bill. I was still hungry but had no desire to order something else off of their menu.  The second time I sat at the bar for drinks. I went with a few others and we each ordered a beer right away. It was super odd because after we ordered, the bartender said he closed us out and gave us all our individual bills. Like he was worried we wouldn't pay? Usually a bartender would ask if we want to start a tab or close out and pay for the drink. I don't know why this annoyed me but it did. I also literally watched a cockroach scurry across the floor which was incredibly disturbing and speaks volume on the cleanliness of the restaurant.  I will not be back. Not sure why I even went back after the first time. It's conveniently located if you want to bar hop at the LINQ but I definitely think you should find elsewhere. Try Yardhouse over by the high roller.",

    "text": "We were in town last weekend for a wedding and attempted to eat here twice. The first time was a Wednesday night and there may have been 15 other people there at the time, all at the bar. There were literally NO tables seated in the entire restaurant. There were 8 of us and we were sat under the big screen, next to a speaker and a sub. There was an amazing mix of hip hop happening, which would have been amazing if we had brought our glow sticks and dancing shoes. Unfortunately, we all just flew into town and hadn't eaten for hours and just wanted to talk over some burgers. We asked the hostess if we could move to the table in the far back corner where there were no speakers. She replied that there wasn't a server for that table. When we asked if our original server could just take us at the other table, she stared at us with a look of confusion and said she didn't think that was possible... we left.  The second time was Sunday around 11:30 am, we were hoping to get a table to watch the Packers & the Chiefs. We approached the host stand where there were 3 gals talking to each other. After a minute or so, one of them acknowledged us and we asked if we could put our name in... she looked very confused and said that there wouldn't be a table until the game ended around 12:45. We told her that wasn't a problem the games we wanted to watch were at 1:30, we would like to put our name on the waitlist. At that time, one of the other gals knocked over the bin of silverware. Our hostess stopped talking to us, mid sentence, laughed and bent down to pick up the silverware and chat with her coworker. We waited. A minute or so later, she stood back up and said there is no waitlist. If we wanted to get a table we had to stand there until one was ready... we left.  Yes, this was the same hostess both times.",

They were \"out of\" a flatbread pizza that i wanted for whatever reason but the other food i ordered tasted good. (Charged us 0.50 extra for sauce with wings)  Normal Bud light beer is about $8 a glass which is a tad ridiculous  The service was a touch better than last time, but the waitresses still seem very clueless and scatterbrained, This certainly is still not what i remember the TK being like years ago when it was in the Rio and although i appreciate the GMs concern for our experiences i dont think ill be coming in here again because in Vegas there are just too many places that provide amazing service and where the staff is top notch. That does not include this joint.",

We were seated right away. The host were standard. Not super friendly and energetic like we prefer. They kind of just went through the motions, but at least they smiled.  Our server was nice, but pretty mono tone like the host. The restaurant was pretty slow, so they were probably just bored lol. Anywho, we ordered the Nachos, and pre game pickles. We only got the pickles because they were free if you add your email to their email list. I'm glad we got the pickles though because they tasted pretty good. The nachos tasted like pure grease, and the meat on them was blah. For our entrees we order a half rack of ribs, kids mac n cheese & the fish N chips. I didn't see ONE salad option on the menu, which was disappointing. I mentioned that to my husband later, and he said he did see 1 salad, but only 1, so it was probably a plain house salad. Anywho, back to the food. My husband really enjoyed his ribs. He said the sauce was great, and that the half rack was plenty. The kids mac n cheese was a great size. My fish N Chips was disappointing since I was really craving a tasty flavorful batter around some fish, but the batter tasted like the nacho chips, just like grease. It didn't have any flavor, no seasoning, salt, nothing. Grease.  I must say the red Sangria was fantastic. I am not much of a drinker, so many times I end up leaving most of my drinks pretty full because the alcohol is just yuck to me. Nope, not today. It was sooooo good. I was giving 3 stars, but decided to make it 4 only because the Red Sangria was great.  They have some fun games, Foosball, shuffleboard, some electronic games (darts or golf I think), and our favorite CORN HOLE!  Pretty standard overall. Nothing special. The Long Beach location is better.",

There are some dime pieces up in here.The food is good and the bar service is really good.Yes the food is expensive and yes the drinks are expensive. I don't wanna hear any complaints if you're a person that goes to Vegas night clubs. You guys pay 20$ for a bottle of water in a night club and you call Tilted Kilt expensive??? Lol laughable!!! There is a drink called the purple haze which is bomb. Taste like grap kool aid and it has you feeling good. I came here ladt summer for the Weidman vs Machida fight and was here in January for the Jones vs Cormier fight. This is a great place to watch UFC fights. The girls are trained to handle the crazy crowds during ufc fights. Like my food didn't take long at all!!! I was shocked.   My one complaint about Tiltes kilt is that they some times have the guys take drink orders................ It doesn't bother me that much tbh but prettt sure it bothers 90% of your male customers. It's cool when a guy ask you if you want water and stuff but we would rather take our drink orders from a hot chick. That's the main reason were here lol. Twin peaks doesn't do this  the guys only really ask if you want water or if you're done with your plate so they can put it away. I'm the dunke of Tilted Kilt currently so Kilt...you might wann listen. I'll be back next month",

The only reason why I'm not giving this place 1 star is because the lady with red hair in the front was really sweet, and one of the male workers was nice enough to check on me when I was waiting forever... all in all I won't be going back though.",

This restaurant is styled after an Irish pub, the walls are lined with tvs, so if you're a sports fan, this is your place. Cute place actually. The service is fast even when they are busy, I am just not a fan of the outfits that the employees wear. The girls wear skimpy little skirts with crop tops and their breasts falling out of the shirt. The bartenders stay True to Irish tradition and wear kilts. Not my kind of place to eat. I do not want bear men legs or breasts in my face as I eat.  I will not return, but to each their own.",

It honestly tasted like buffalo sauce.  I was not given any utensils or napkins even though it was obvious I would need some.  Last but not least, when I was paying, they dropped my card on the floor and the server didn't even realize it.  Had to ask the barback who then asked the server and she mumbled to him that it was on the ground...didn't even come over to apologize or anything.  Overall, service was pretty terrible.  The food was average.  The atmosphere was okay, given I was there to watch the Warriors game and they have a lot of TV's.  I've definitely experienced better sports bars in my life. I would not come back.",

I feel like something tart\". \"I don't like sour drinks either\" is what I got back.  So I guess the customer isn't allowed to have subjective taste, because she definitely wasn't going to ask one of the other bartender's, though she was fine with making the other woman a Mai Tai.   After several minutes of being ignored, I ordered a shot of tequila, only to watch her serve six plastic cups of beer to other people as they came and ordered them before I went to another bartender and cashed out.

I ordered wings and man they had a lot of meat! My boyfriend said they were the best lemon pepper wings he has ever tried.  The food took a while to get to our table (or maybe we were just starving and seemed like forever) but it was well worth it. The waitress was great!

The food wasn't mind blowing or super inventive but Irish-American style comfort food with alcoholic drinks.  Overall we had great time and the service was good. Great place to hangout with a group of friends if you don't mind the loud music. Plus they have alot of TV's all over this place with different sports and newsfeed.

I got the grilled fish tacos -- surprisingly tasty.   The buffalo mac & cheese was pasta topped with alfredo sauce  and chucks of buffalo chicken -- great comfort food.   They make a great Bloody Mary.   There was a huge bar, booths, and tables.   The 2nd floor had more seating with a view of the bar below.   Tons of TVs perfect for watching a game or two.   Not a place that would be on my list but it's great for a group of people that couldn't agree if it's time for breakfast or lunch and what they wanted to eat!   Plus when in Vegas it's good to get out the casinos for a meal or two.",

The service was mediocre at best. As many other reviews have mentioned, lots of people working, most just standing around.   My biggest complaint was the beer prices. Way more expensive than anywhere else on the Strip, and prices aren't listed. Want to pay $12 for a Heineken? This is your place. Our waitress was saying Vegas is cheap to live in, that she \"works one day for a bill\" and pockets the rest of that months cash. Our bill came out to $184 for snacks and a few drinks each. I see what she was saying now.",

The area is small (with high chairs) and a very loud band that blasts ear-splitting music (nice selection of music, they take requests, and encourage patrons to dance) that make conversing (unless you enjoy yelling into each other's ears) futile.    As for the food - I hated my fish and chips.  They were greasy and often fell apart or became mush when trying to dip them into sauce.  The \"chips\" (shoestring fries) were glued together due to the congealed grease.  My wife however had the Irish Dip (shaved rib eye with au jus) sandwich which she liked.    Service was attentive and attractive.  The waitress came often checking in on our drinks, although food delivery was a bit long, about a 20-25 minute wait.  There is a second story that houses small tables and a bathroom attendant scourging for tips.    We visited Tilted Kilt on a Tuesday around 7pm and were seated at a table without wait (they are on OpenTable).  Prices were $$, a nice find especially on The Strip.  Even though I disliked the food it was nice to find a place that advertised a \"Pub Fare Menu\" that actually had Pub Fare prices.    Tilted Kilt advertises itself as a \"Celtic-themed environment\" which to me sounds like they couldn't call themselves an Irish Pub along the lines of Nine Fine Irishmen (NYNY) or Ri Ra (Mandalay Bay) especially since O'Shea's is right down the Linq's promenade.  I didn't get their environment.  It was too small for a band that loud and although the prices were fair the food was not.",

We ordered the beer cheese soup but it reminded my niece of queso dip. A little spicy, a thicker consistency but no real pizzaz.  We decided to get the BBQ cheese burger and garlic Parmesan fries. It took a bit to come out and when it finally arrived the fries were undercooked and cold, the bun was as cold as the vegetables on the burger and the patty from just an external touch was tepid (at best). The server was quick to take it back and have it fixed.  Two minutes later it comes out. I think WOW that's fast. How did they do that and my niece pointed out it was the same plate of food. Upon inspection, it was. The fries were put back in the fryer and the bun toasted (too much at this point, it was hard around the edges) and the same lukewarm patty all places back before me. I summoned the manager. He explained he was sorry it was a mistake and would have it re-made an additional time. He emphasized everyone makes a mistake now and again. I readily agreed. I stated that when they brought out the food knowing it had been back there some time and was probably running on the cold side. When I returned it expecting a fresh hot meal and had a reheated variation of the original was returned to me.. That wasn't a MISTAKE.. It's dishonest. I kindly stated at that point unless he made it personally I didn't trust his kitchen with my food. He removed the burger off my bill and I paid for my beverage and soup. I tipped Kelly on the original bill amount (so she's not penalized for a poor kitchen) and wrote this review! I wouldn't go back nor will I recommend my clients and friends.",

I sat at the bar, which wasn't too crowded at 6 p.m. on a Sunday. The bartenders were very nice, and service there came pretty quickly. I had a Tennessee Arnold Palmer, which wasn't a bad cocktail (the drink was stiff, but so was the $12 pricetag!).  However, the kitchen was very slow in making food, and not to just me. It took about 40 minutes for my burger, and while it wasn't bad, others at the bar also remarked about the slow rate at which entrees left the kitchen.  It's not a bad bar and grill, and it'll do well in its current location. I'm not opposed to giving it another shot; hopefully the kitchen is a little quicker getting food out next time.",

My fiancee and I had walked over to go to the Hash a Go Go breakfast, but there was a really long wait. We walked down the alley and saw the Twisted Kilt. There were barely any customers. We looked on the menu and there were 5 breakfast items. Who can mess up breakfast? Let me answer that... the Twisted Kilt can. Our server finally came over after we had been seated about 20 minutes... literally there were 2 other tables. We ordered coffee and French toast and the Twisted breakfast (eggs, sausage, bacon, toast and hash browns). We waited FOREVER for the coffee. Then waited forever for sugar and cream. Finally a male server delivered the food. No utensils. I have no idea what our server was doing.  ..socializing apparently. He got us silverware.  The French toast was fine, but ruined by the fake maple syrup. Gross! Hash browns weren't special,  just fried potatoes. My fiancee didn't touch his sausage, it was bland. His eggs and toast were already cold. No butter for his toast either. He asked, but never got it. We had to call for our server to get coffee refills. She NEVER asked how the meal was... ever. I will never go to another Twisted Kilt...too many other options. I recommend any other restaurant or going hungry.",

We walk in, find a seat at the crowded bar, and order two Miller Lites.  Bill comes, and we're charged $16.  What!?  I ask, he tells me the $5 is for industry night, and only applies to those in industry.  What does that even mean?  I say the sign does not say that, and he argues it does.  I go out to the sign three times to confirm, and every time tell him it does not.  He says, well you're wrong, but because you're causing an issue, I will just charge you $10.  Of course you will, because I am not wrong (and, isn't the customer always right anyways?), and you really should check your signs, and honor them.  Maybe most of the people that come in here have really taken Vegas to the extreme so do not notice the bill, but that's just dishonest business.  Never again in this location.  Never again in any location.",

    "text": "Stopped in before a concert at nearby Brooklyn Bowl. It was a Sunday evening, and the place was  semi busy, definitely not packed. There were four young ladies standing at the hostess station, and they were very friendly when we walked in the door. We told them we would sit at the bar, and none of them had to move from the desk to show us to a table. I don't think any of them left that hostess station the entire time we were there.  The bartender(s) ignored us until we asked for their attention. Too busy chit-chatting to take care of a couple of tie-dyed concert goers, I suppose. After getting us our drinks and handing us menus, they disappeared around the bar and we had to get their attention again to place our food orders.  The food was not bad; not great. The service was so terrible that we left with a bad taste in our mouths, however. There are too many great restaurants in Vegas to waste your time in this one. We are locals and will NEVER go back to this place.",

Pretty much the worst place for service at the Linq, in my experience so far.  We left when we overheard someone get charged $24 for three drinks. One of them was a coke. Went to O'Sheas instead and were served right away. Four drinks, two of them shots, for about $30, all in the matter of 2 minutes within sitting down.",

She was too busy taking care of the larger party of guys that came in and barely came back to us or the other 3 smaller tables by us.  Their special cocktail ran out of the key ingredient (it was a Friday before 6pm). Things didn't get too crazy yet to start running out of things for your signature drinks.    The pretzels were good but the fish and chips were mediocre...beer batter was generic. The Shepard's pie was highly disappointing, bland and more mash than anything else.   Music got really loud starting around 8pm, the DJ was doing his set. Way too loud for the restaurant area IMO.  I would not recommend this place to anyone, not even with the discount. The boobs (all squished and not evenly squished either! ) didn't even save this place, there are better sets in other restaurants in the Linq.",

But the thing that I really appreciated, when we first arrived my wife asked the hostess if they had any ciders.  The hostess asked if my wife was gluten free.  She is.  She was diagnosed with severe gluten allergies earlier this year.  The hostess told my wife they had gluten free beer.  Awesome.  Atmosphere:  was good.  Loved the decor.  I love Irish pubs.  This felt removed from the Vegas glitz, even though it obviously was still part of it.  But, it still had that homey feel I like in pubs.  And I loved the mix the DJ was playing.  Prices were par for Vegas, high for home.  But I can't mark them down for charging to pay the bills.  Now, if corporate reads this, please open one is Pasadena, CA.  It's rare to find a chain that feels like a local pub.",

Waitress came by and checked on us once within a reasonable amount of time and let us know our order would be out shortly. Half an hour later we got our food. I ordered the Blackened Chicken Avocado Sandwich. The bottom half if the sandwich was soggy. Fries were the only thing that was good. My mom got the Shepherds Pie. It was a mound of bland ground beef with a pile of tasteless mash potatoes. It was also cold. She did not finish it. Also, when the waiter brought the food he did not offer condiments so I had to wait another 10 minutes to ask for ketchup. So not worth what we paid.",

The ketchup bottle wasn't even opened. I'm sure staff here changes wit so maybe it will be better next time but I'll expect some of the same.",

We ordered grilled wings with half the order guiness bbq, the other half TK sauce along with a salad adding grilled chicken. Never got the jalapenos and when the food was delivered only one sauce was on the extremely fatty wings and the salad had less than half a chicken breast on it which cost and additional $7 ( I think don't remember and the receipt it's not detailed).

Mixed bag on the food - wings & sandwiches decent, tried a sirloin and was pretty rough, overcooked, cold side of broccoli.  Probably should have stuck with bar/pub food.

And waited. While we watched all of the tables around us get their meals... and send them back to the kitchen because they were wrong. The table directly beside us received half of their tables food while the other half had to wait because the kitchen \"must have forgotten the order.\" We were still waiting when the waitress brought out the other two meals, which the couple promptly discovered were not even cooked all the way through. The man ordered a well done burger and when he cut it in half it bled like he was cutting into a live cow, while the woman complained that her fries were still frozen. It really excited me to finally receive my food. When I saw it coming, I was just happy it was finally arriving. That was about it that excited me about this meal. My chicken sandwich was placed in front of me and the chicken was so over cooked it felt like plastic. The fries weren't cooked. My friend's burger was so undercooked I think I actually heard it moo. And my other friends French dip wasn't a French dip at all. The waitress brought out a steak sub with peppers and onions. When the waitress came over to us she said \"what's wrong\" and we promptly told her we would like to speak to a manager. Which we had to wait to do, because she was busy comping three other tables meals due to the incompetent kitchen and rude waitress. When she finally came over, the waitress also had the French dip with her and when she placed it down she said \"I was confused because you said steak.\" No apology. No remorse. It was our fault because apparently the word steak sounds like French dip. Needless to say we got up from the table at around the same time as two other tables because of this horrendous experience. When visiting Vegas again I will not be returning.",

They do lose a star for the egg. Sorry.   Let's discuss the elephant in the room: the waitstaff. Outstanding. Ours was a young lady who's name escapes me, but she was from Connecticut and she was freaking hot. Yeah, I said it. Relax.

    "text": "For a place on the strip,and the high prices you'll pay, you'd think you would get a good experience while dining here. My boyfriend and I attempted to eat here last night while we were staying at the Linq. We came in and sat down at the bar. After about five minutes a bartender finally acknowledged us, got us drinks & handed us menus. No one ever spoke to us again until my boyfriend had to ask for the tab over 25 minutes later. The two bartenders on duty were even serving the men sitting next to us- but not us. We were fully expecting to eat meals and get a few more drinks, but unfortunately the terrible service made us ask for our tab and leave, very disappointed. I will not be returning to the Tilted Kilt. I don't like dining somewhere where you get ignored.",

The food portions, especially with regard to the burgers, was ample. And there were also some good choices for what's on tap. It wasn't inexpensive, but prices weren't outrageous either.  This time however, during happy hour on Sunday for game day; the burgers we were served were a sad shadow of last years in portion and accompanying fries. Bland fries and sparse toppings for the burger. The beer, of which I got the monthly special so it was a dollar off, was $11 a glass. The service was about what you'd expect on a crowded game day, but for waiting as long as we did for our order there should have been more on the plate.  The waitresses were still barely clad; but not bare midriff or amount of cleavage can distract from the fact that we got taken.",

But the food is pretty damn good and plentiful.   The husband had the panko-crusted cod (3 fillets) with vegetable fried rice and sauteed vegetables, mostly broccoli. He was happy.   I had what I thought would be small plate stuff: dinner salad with ranch dressing and the hangover tater tots. They are covered in onions, peppers, cheese sauce and a fried egg. Delicious, but can easily feed four. The salad too, could feed four. All was tasty.   Service really good. We couldn't figure out if she was Spanish (from Spain) or Puerto Rican. Her accent was adorable and she was, too. Or so the husband thought. Ha, ha.   Go there.",

Shortly after I sat down at the Bar I was greeted by Marisela who provided me with a menu and asked what I would like to drink.  I asked for a Smithwick which was served in a frosty cold glass and I checked out the lunch menu.  For lunch I had the Club Sandwich which was unique but also very good.  I also asked Marisela if it was possible to get the Dodgers game on one of the many TVs.  She said of course and changed the channel very quickly.   This is a great locaton right on the linq promenade,  The restaurant was very clean with lots of TVs.  Everyone was friendly, the service was quick and the food (and beer) was very good. Great Job!!",

I stopped in for a relatively affordable meal while staying on the Las Vegas strip.  I am traveling solo so I opted for a seat at the bar. I asked about throwback Thursday as advertised on the sign out front my server said that that isn't going on right now because of the game. I'm not a football fan so I really dread this time of year. I gave the server a bit of a stink eye and said the sign is physically sitting outside. She spoke with one of her co-workers and...I now have my $3 Coors Banquet!  If you're looking for a sports game on TV there is a high chance that one of the 33 (if I counted right) TV's have it.   The staff is friendly and my food was served up quickly. If in the mood for a drink and somewhat affordable meal and I'm in the area, I won't hesitate to stop back in. I'm giving it 3 stars because it's a bit noisy and I'm not a football fan and that is the entire existence of the restaurant right now.",

We decided on heading here to Tilted Kilt for some comfort food and drinks. The place wasn't crowded like other venues in this same corridor which was good for us. We had boneless chicken wings, a plate of battered fish and fries and beef stew. Everyone said their food was okay. Nothing to die for (hence the 3 stars), but good enough not to be considered a bad dining experience. I believe this place is more about the atmosphere more so than the food. Our Server was very nice, but the poor girl looked heck of tired. This is why I always tip 18-20% no matter what the dine-in restaurant is because they work their butts off. So if you're at the Linq Promenade, come out of the heat for a cold one here. The music is fine, and not obnoxiously club loud like some other restaurants try to emulate. The Staff are cool, so keep your shy guy shades at home if you decide to give this place a try.",

The first time we went was fabulous and a full 4 star review. However, the second time we went before we took off to the airport was barely a 2.  The 4 stars, the burger was amazing! Cooked to a perfect medium the BBQ Bacon Burger really hit it out of the park. The fish and chips were really good as well and the service was fantastic sitting at the wood.   The 2 stars, we shared an order of sliders and I asked what temp they were cooked to and our server (different than the first time) promised us medium so there was no need to change it. Unfortunately, they were dry and well- done.  Service the second time around was lacking. Again, sitting at the wood there should be no reason why my drink sits empty. The Server also got the temp of the sliders ridiculously wrong.",

No real specials, Coronas were $8 somehow on \"special.\"  They wanted $7 for a Bud Light during Sunday football. I know it's Vegas but at least give some type of discount.   Additionally, they were out of Corona by my 3rd one so I had to get a Modelo. They were completely out of almost all bottled beer because the Rodeo was in town. It's in town every year, you'd think a place like this would plan for it and not be out of every light beer they sell for a Sunday football crowd.   We got a sampler appetizer which was pretty average as well.   I'd been here before and really don't like/get the bathroom attendant. It's Tilted Kilt, not a place I'd expect to have a pushy/awkward bathroom attendant.   Overall, there are better spots to get $8 beers for a football game. This place gets by on the crowd who wants to see the girls dressed how they are.",

As we walked up the Linq High Roller had a quick song and light show playing, which was unexpected and fun. Our hostess was really funny and full of personality. We decided to sit at a table instead of the bar. There was a hockey game for the Vegas team playing so tons of people were here to watch and spirits were energetic.  Our waitress was pretty prompt and on it. We ordered wings as an appetizer with Mango Habenero and Buffalo sauces. The Buffalo was nice and spicy but Mango wasn't as spicy, still good flavor though. The chicken was nice and crispy. I'd definitely order the wings again. I ordered a club sandwich, which was cooked well and I liked it all but I wish it has just a hint more flavor of some kind. The fries were basic but good. My boyfriend got the wicked Boston burger and he said it was perfectly cooked except the bacon was not cooked as much as he would normally like. Overall we enjoyed are meal and the service was decent. It's a fun spot in a good location with decent food and decent prices on food. The only thing is I would say that was negative is the beer prices were pretty crazy. I believe the cheapest 16 oz was $9, but most were $10+. That was a little disappointing.",

It took at least 10 minutes for anyone to even come and greet our table and ask what we wanted for a drink.  It took another almost 10 minutes for the drinks to come.  Our waitress seem incapable, but was nice enough. Unfortunately, our suspicions were True.  One of our friends' orders got screwed up, and they couldn't even manage to fix the problem. The wrong sized dish was served, and it took 15 MINUTES for them to correct the mistake, and then when the salad finally came it was the wrong dressing.   Upon complaint, a manager was requested and we waited 20 minutes and they never came.  The food I had was...just alright. The only reason this is 2 stars and not 1 is because I did eat at this restaurant and paid, and so did the other two folks.   Wouldn't really recommend the place even if the service was better anyway.",

The French Dip? Was good, I am gluten free and ate it without the bun and was flavorful. I liked the hand cut chips and the price was fair for The Linq area. My friends beer, $9. I refuse to pay that much for a draught beer.  This is a sports bar, it is loud, there are guys yelling, the volume is high on the TV's so expect noise!  The windows were open, and it was hot, so do not expect to escape the heat. I am sure they have some kind of air on, we were both warm.   The tables are tight so the woman behind us had to bump our table twice to get in and out. If you or someone in your party is large, sit strategically   Me personally, I am not a fan, however, if I had friends in town that were sports fans and they were at The Linq, I would send them, it is just not for me.",

    "text": "I'd never been to a Tikted Kilt before as we don't have one where we live, but we were staying at the Linq and decided to stop in for lunch as it was convenient.  It was not crowded at all when we went, so the service was very attentive.  My husband ordered the Fat Bastard Mac and Cheese, and I ordered the Irish Dip sandwhich.  My husband loved the Mac and cheese, and said it tasted like fetucinni Alfredo but with macaroni and buffalo chicken (he loves Alfredo so that's a good thing).  The sandwhich was very tasty.  The bread was fresh and the meat was tender and seasoned well.  Prices were a little on the high side for what it was, but compared to some other places on and near the strip, we considered it fairly reasonable.    We were in Vegas celebrating my birthday.  At the end of our meal, our waitress brought us a warm chocolate chip cookie with ice cream that was divine!  Out of all the establishments we visited during the three and a half days we were in Vegas, including a rather expensive restaurant that we ate at later that evening where it was noted when we made the reservation that we were celebrating a birthday, the Tikted Kilt was the ONLY one that did anything special for my birthday (except for Sprinkles, where I got a lovely complimentary cupcake, but it was because I had signed up for their rewards program and had a coupon).  The expensive place we went to for dinner didn't even ask us if we were celebrating anything special (despite the fact that it was noted on the reservation) or so much as wish me a happy birthday. I am totally okay with restaurants not giving away anything for birthdays, but acknowledgement in the form of a simple \"happy birthday\" is always nice and goes a long way.  Tilted Kilt went above and beyond and I will remember that the next time I am near one!",

    "text": "Really, honestly, bad.   I literally dropped in 12 months ago, about the time they opened the establishment. It was kinda of lacking in many ways but service was good enough. This time I sat at the bar and ordered a cocktail and a turkey burger. Nothing about the situation was quality. I won't even go into the cocktail issues as really it was just the bartender not listening. I drank it.. Lol.  I ordered the turkey burger while sitting at the bar in an attempt to keep it lighter. The turkey burger was meant to have guacamole on it .. Which it did .. barely.. But as it was literally 24min from order to delivery of the food - I didn't complain.   The burger was boring. I know turkey burgers don't always get the best reviews overall - but there is no reason they should taste literally like cardboard. Especially in this day and age of over-priced, extremely casual dinner fare. You can at least have it not taste bad. I didn't eat it. It was not good. I ordered them with potato chips which were over cooked and cardboard like as well. When he basket was picked up eventually, it was without question of why it was over half  un-eaten.  In addition, I was asked to pay for my food before it arrived, which I found odd. I was informed that I needed to give a credit card if I wanted to eat at the bar. I reluctantly gave a card and requested that it not be charged because I wanted to pay cash. I was then told - \"anytime you eat at a bar in Vegas, you are required to pay up front.\" I was like ... what? Hahah.   After that - the bartender never checked on me once, as he was constantly talking with his friends and juggling bottles. All of that is fine - if you can give proper service. Otherwise .. Please focus on your guests.  I asked for the check - and I waited literally 18 minutes to receive the check - which the bartender charged to my credit card after I once again, asked him to allow me to pay cash. He took off and didn't even give me a pen. I went to the hostess stand and asked the manager there for a pen.   I mean it was just not a good situation and I have no reason to go back. If it weren't truly bad I wouldn't go this far as to be so descriptive - but it was that bad. I'm a believer in allowing a situation to be fixed - but I had little opportunity and I just wanted out of there. Better luck to you if you decide to check it out. Happy eating !",

My issue is with the food which is Denny's quality but with strip prices.   The wait time for said Denny's quality grub (nothing against Denny's btw), which was close to 45mins.  Maybe I wasn't paying close attention to my tab but I have been at far more established places and don't remember paying as much for drinks, again very costly.   Bar staff were uninterested, maybe I wasn't attractive enough for them which I gathered was the motivation of interest for them given the pattern of service they provided.  I happen to think I'm a solid 6.5 ;)   I enjoy trying new places and experiencing the best Vegas has to offer.   Happily though I won't be returning to this place.  It made me sad to see some of the nice girls with so much personality waste there talents in this establishment.   I would say I wish tilted kilt all the best in the future but that would be a lie.

After about five minutes without being recognized, we flagged down a bartender ask for a drink menu, then after a few more minutes flag down the server to order drinks.  I ordered their Monday Moscow mule special.  It was basically ginger beer and water.  My wife had a well margarita which was awfully sweet; she decided not to finish it.  I understand we went in for happy hour but the service and drinks were terrible.  Won't be going back during our stay here.  Shame because it's right outside our hotel.",

All we ordered food wise was the pretzels which came out slow, but hit and they tasted great. We had 3 beers and a Bloody Mary between the two of us and our bill was as $51. I know this is Vegas and things may cost a little more. However, $11 for Angry Orchard is ridiculous. I know how much they pay for their legs and they are purposely gouging you on the cost of their draft beer. $51 for 2 pretzels and some beers. Lame. I wouldn't suggest or come back based on how expensive it is. I should add I have visited a Tilted Kilt in Arizona and it was not nearly as expensive. Vegas prices will keep me from ever coming back.",

    "text": "Visited Tilted Kilt on a Friday night, around 9pm.  I expected it to be a lot like Twin Peaks.  The decor and girls in uniform were what i expected.  What I did not expect, however, was the loud blaring music coming from the DJ booth.  I'm not sure if all Tilted Kilts have a DJ on the weekends or it was because it was a Friday in Las Vegas at the Linq, but I was not a fan.  Turn down the music and I'll turn up my rating.  In order to talk to someone, you were basically shouting at each other.  Another annoyance was the fact that the restroom was located upstairs!!  How inconvenient is that??!!    Looking over the menu, all of the food was very reasonably priced, especially considering their location.  I ordered an Irish Dip which was their version of a prime rib dip for a mere $11 which came with a choice of chips, fries, or onion rings.  The onion rings were huge and plentiful.  The Irish dip, however, was on the smaller side.  Portion size aside, the thin slices of prime rib were delicious and their au jus was quite flavorful.  If you are a big eater or even just on the hungry side, I'd definitely suggest ordering an appetizer or a dessert.  Overall, the menu at Tilted Kilt looked pretty good.  There are a lot more dining options here than there are at Twin Peaks.    I didn't really go over the drink menu very carefully, just asked if they had any house brews.  Our waitresses informed us that they didn't have their own microbrew, but Killian's Irish Red was their house beer.  I'm a fan of Killian's so i had a pint.    I'd definitely go back and give this place another shot.  But if the music is blasting as it was on Friday, I'm skipping this place and going to Yard House.",

I feel sorry for the staff that has to work here. We had 2 Coors, 1 Blue Moon and a Michelob Ultra which cost $37. We didn't even eat anything.  We won't be back.",

That's almost 50 people on a regular basis weekly not paying patronage to our fellow business and I really don't want that to happen but....  Phone orders are not correct, and I ordered chicken finders hot with blue cheese.  Yes I know it's not typical hot on the menu but when I order them the girl said we don't have chicken fingers, we have chicken tenders... Um really lol wow. Then she said so buffalo? You mean barbecue? No, I went over it 4 times. And a few of my colleagues got food there recently and it was wrong.   Yes the food quality is good but it's a little ridiculous the lack of food knowledge they have here. There's so many choices for food so I would train your staff a little better otherwise you'll lose alot of business.",

We sat and waited....and waited....one of our party waved down a busboy , while I flagged down a waitress for some assistance.  Mind you there were at least 3 waitresses standing around talking in one of the stations close to us.  In all, we probably waited 10 minutes, NO ONE ever came to wait on us.  We all got up & left.

    "text": "This was my second time here, I enjoyed the Calamari the last time I was here so I convinced my fiance to go with me to give this place a try. It's a nice little pub the overall theme fits the name Tilted Kilt.   We came for lunch I wasn't too hungry so we ordered a few appetizers. From entering the restaurant to leaving I have to say one of the worst services I have ever experienced coming from the Las Vegas Strip.   You can tell that the focus of this place is on the girls. Which is great put pretty girls in cute outfits and have their bubbly personalities serve guest. Clearly sex sells especially in Vegas. The idea is there but the execution isn't. Other than the fact that some of these girls look underage I have never encountered such horrible personalities. This isn't a night club and these girls are far away from those standards they shouldn't hold themselves so high up the podium acting like their better then everyone around them.  The hostess was clueless when I approached her looking for my party. I don't know if my server was sober or just not all there cause she would just stare at us without any reaction. Started to clear the table while we where still eating without excusing herself. The girls at the front where all busy gossiping while the ones by the bar gossiped as well. They kept glancing at our table then would talk amongst each other and stare again. Don't make it go obvious when your talking about someone. On our way out not one of the 3-4 hostesses at the podium took the time to welcome us back or even wish us a good day.  This team is so unprofessional they are to into themselves/their personal lives vs. serving their guest. It's actually sad cause this place has decent food, decent prices, decent atmosphere but service plays a big role in dining for me it's the overall experience that matters.   I would recommend Yard House over this place if your looking for a decent dining experience on the Linq Promenade.",

It's definitely not a place you go out of your way to visit. It also strangely felt like Hooters for an older, rowdier crowd. Way too many other bars to visit if you're from out of town and looking king for that vegas feel.",

While in Vegas, my wife and I decided to take it easy one day, It was dinner time and I suggested that we go to the Tilted Kilt for dinner. I'm not to sure its a great place just to go for dinner, But if you are into sports that place is AWESOME. The Tilted Kilt ranks #3 out of the top 10 places to dink in Vegas according to the Las Vegas Where Quick Guide. With 30 beers on tap and plenty other in bottles, It also offers a full bar and TV's EVERYWHERE. I almost forgot the about the hottie serves walking around in red plaid mini skirts and a top to match.  Back to dinner, I of coursed ordered the One Shot Johnny Shepherd's Pie. It came out at the right temp, So I didn't burn my mouth. It had the right amount of  of meet, potatoes and veggies inside. Usually the mashed potatoes over power the rest of the ingredients but not in this one. The bread that it came with was perfect. This shepherds pie ranked #2 out of my top 10 shepherd pie.  My wife ordered the Sadie's Stuffed Breast, The chicken breast was nice and moist and had great flavor, It was stuffed with cheddar cheese and bacon. Which added to how awesome it tasted. Such a great taste to your pallet. It also came with steamed broccoli, It was steamed to perfection.  Next time that i'm in Vegas ill more then likely try something else on their menu.

Even though the reviews were not great, it is always worth one try at a tilted kilt.  Greeted by the young blonde  hostess, who was very pleasant and talkative.  Sara our waitress greeted our table promptly for our drink order.   As I ordered a pulled pork sandwich no cole slaw, the response I got was they might still put it on, not a good start to this experience. As our food came out promptly the portion of French fries was smaller than expected, or what I should say not what I'm used to. You could tell they placed Cole saw on my plate, but then removed it.  The waitress was not attentive, I felt she was too worried about rolling silver then worrying about her tables.   Not once did she socialize with any of her tables that I could see.  Not once did I see a member of management table touch, he was walking around looking busy.  As the food was not up to par with what I have had or expect from a TK, this place will not be on my list to take friends and family when they visit.",

I really enjoy the fish tacos and I tend to get them all the time. Other friends have had other things that they seemed to enjoy as well. The service was good, I have no complaints. The guys must love going to The Tilted Kilt because of all the pretty ladies working there but my friends and I really enjoyed the view as well ;) those guys in kilts are really easy on the eyes.

Typical pub food fro garlic fries, calamari, quesadilla, buffalo wings, burgers, variety of salads - nice beer on taps, wine and cocktail menu. Sports fans will be happy here as they have a number of large flat screens with plenty of sports playing. Located by the Linq/boardwalk of shops and restaurants. Plenty of parking, but crowded parking spots and difficult to find spaces during dinner and later in the night.",

    "text": "I did not know that Vegas had one of these pubs in their area now. We were looking for a place to watch the World Cup and this was the nearest spot. I wasn't expecting to find a seat being that the game was about to start but to our luck there was one table left by a projector screen. Every TV had the game on and the surround sound was turned up loud. I love it when restaurants do that!       The service wasn't as slow as you would expect for a World Cup, but my beers did take a minute to come out, but it was no knock on our waitress, she was awesome. For food I ordered the spicy chicken tenders, which on their menu, was listed as one of their fan favorites. It comes with cole slaw, fries, and their spicy sauce.... hardly spicy at all. The meal itself wasn't very large but it was filling.         The one thing I hated about this place is the restroom. It's located upstairs and they are very small. Imagine having to go to the bathroom (#2) all the way upstairs just to find out someone is in there then have to walk all the way back and wait. That didn't workout to well for me. I would recommend walking over to the O'sheas Casino just outside the pub. There are plenty of clean bathrooms there within walking distance and no incline.",

Plenty of help on Saturday, not so much on Monday, Saturday also seemed to have all the seasoned help, Monday appeared to have all the new employees fumbling around. I liked the food and the portions were decent, not huge but enough to fill you up. Good location by the Linq, reasonable prices for the location and well kept as in clean, a big plus for the wife.   If you are in the area on a weekend you should be able to get in and out quickly if you want, as I mentioned earlier Monday was a bit of a challenge. As there appeared to be just two waitress taking orders and at least ours didn't have time to check back with us to take our order, beyond our drinks and appetizers. One of the bussers finally got her attention for us and we were able to order our meal. Saturday everything flowed like a well oiled machine, no sooner than our appetizers were done and we were getting refills on our drinks along with our main course.   Another big difference between the two nights, even though the crowd seemed to be about the same the volume level on Saturday was at a modest level, You could talk without having raise your voice, but Monday the music was considerably louder.   All in all a decent meal at reasonable prices especially when you take into account the location, I would go back but I'll check to see how many servers they have working before taking a seat.",

The chicken and cheese dip was good with crispy potato chips. The wings were a nice size but were not as hot as I thought they would be. The pulled pork sliders were not good at all, passable really.  The females working the bar were attentive and nice, as for the people dropping off the food,well they need some lessons on how to address someone if they ordered food and a simple hi excuse me, just don't slap the plate down and walk away.

We were promptly seated by a wonderful hostess, where we waited for about 15 minutes before we asked our hostess if there was a waitress in our section. We hadn't been greeted or waters or anything. She quickly got us our server who explained they were having some issues, but quickly owned the situation and offered us a round of drinks on the house. Nicely done. The manager also came by to make sure we got some drinks. We got the food which was just fine. We had a Reuben and the Gaelic chicken. They messed up and gave us pasta instead of the mashed potatoes we requested. Didn't have the heart to tell our server since she had already tried so hard to make things right. She was a blast to talk to, and really she made the experience fun. Overall, I might stop by again... But the staff was what stood out more than the food!",

    "text": "My husband and I stopped in early on a Tuesday afternoon for a couple of drinks and decided to go back the next day for lunch.  The atmosphere is \"sports bar busyness.\"  Both days we sat at the bar rather than in the dining area.  The bartenders were attentive and friendly.  I ordered the spicy southwest chicken wrap with sweet potato fries and both were awesome!  The fries were cooked perfectly - I like them crispy.  The wrap was filled with chunks of chicken and veggies.  The southwest sauce added the perfect amount of zing.  I also ordered a side of the pre-game fried pickle chips.  The breading on them was super-thin - unlike any I'd had before - and I loved them.  They come with a cayenne mayo (?) dipping sauce that I actually enjoyed with my sweet potato fries.  My husband ordered the black and blue burger - piled high with blue cheese crumbles and onion strings.  The prices of the meals were reasonable ($12.50 for my wrap and $13.50 for the burger) - the drinks a little on the high side ($8 for a 16oz draft beer and $12 for a double Captain Coke).  But given that this is just off the Strip in Vegas, it was to be expected.  Speaking of the location, the LINQ shopping area provided a nice respite from the busyness of the Strip.  There are several places to shop or eat along the area.  It's also close to the High Roller Wheel.",

    "text": "We stopped into this pub for a bite to eat and watch the soccer tournament being played in Brazil.  England lost, which did not make a lot of Brits sitting in the bar very happy.  My first visit to Tilted Kilt left me thrilled and disappointed at the same time.  I was thrilled because it is a wonderful sports bar with a great business model.  The servers are probably the friendliest I've encountered in a long time. Paula had no problem spending time with us and that made us feel right at home.  They also offered us a discount simply because we were locals (people who actually live in Vegas)..  We really did enjoy ourselves, that is, until the food came.  It would probably be no surprise to our friends to hear that we chose the fish and chips on the menu.  We've been looking for a good one since our favorite place for this item closed last year.  The fish was a beer-battered cod that the restaurant proudly claims is made with Sam Adams beer.  It is proudly displayed on the menu as a featured item.  We were very disappointed.  It looked great when it arrived in the basket with fries and onion rings on the side but, we quickly lost interest as we dug in.  The breading was quite doughy and flavorless.  it tasted like grease and when I took a fork and pressed into the fish, it oozed oil.  The same for the onion rings and fries.  Greasy as can be.  This tells me the oil was not hot enough when the food was dropped in.  Why can't these kitchens test the the temperature of oil before they dip anything into it?  Why doesn't a good  line cook or chef know that it takes time for a deep fryer to recover heat lost after frying a batch of battered fish?  Maybe it's me.  Maybe I expect too much but, I don't think so.  I grew up on the East Coast having fish and chips every Friday for most of my young life.  While in school, I worked at several restaurants that specialized in making fish and chips .. or a \"fish fry\" as we called them.  I guess I'll just have to keep looking for that elusive fish fry.  As for the Tilted Kilt; it's a fine place to sit and have a beer!",
