He knew about everything on the menu and first thing he asked was is anyone allergic to any kind of sea food??? I'm allergic to shrimp so when I ordered some kind of beef, he said the sauce has slices of shrimp in it and I should not have it..There were 4 of us so be basically ordered everything on the menu and they were all excellent.  I really liked the salmon sashimi which was so mouth watering and good (you have to try that)...I also tried their beef which was excellent...I highly recommend this resturant although its not cheap and you have to pay about 100 dollars a person...",

I recommend the following:  - Drunken noodles (not the best though. tomatoes in drunken noodles?) - Gardein chicken Shu Mai - Crispy tofu dishes  On the other hand, sweet and sour chicken was a-ok. It should have been deep-fried. Oh well. It felt like they weren't sure what to do with Gardein.   Also vegan crispy roll was a bit disappointing. The crispy stuff looked like rice crispy gone healthy. It was not bad but we weren't too crazy about it.  I think Wazuzu can do better. Deep fry those Gardein and you will be surprised!  Also really expensive. If I were you I'd dine at Red 8 (inside Wynn) and get better Asian food.   On the other hand, crystal dragon is pretty fancy.",

Like the vast majority of the upscale restaurants on the strip, you're buying the experience as much as the actual food. Its not really fair to go and downgrade the restaurant on price alone. Just because the meal costs 5 times more here than panda express doesn't mean it should taste 5 times better. Its not a linear relationship.   Now that I get that out of the way...I thought the restaurant was \"nice\" and I can't think of a better word to describe it. The service was good, the food was tasty and the dragon on the wall looked cool. It took us about 30 minutes of waiting on a Friday night but that doesn't seem unreasonable.  It seemed like an older crowd but there were a couple of families with little kids eating here.  We got a bunch of different dim sum orders and they were all good but nothing really blew me away about it. The chicken drunken noodles were pretty good, they're packed with fresh herbs - basil and a bunch of other stuff I can't recall. The nice thing is that none of this tasted overly greasy like a lot of the chinese food you get around.  Nothing about this restaurant stood out and there isn't a single reason i'd come back to eat here. I mean its fine if you feel like getting some chinese  and don't want to pony up for Wing Lei. They have rolls too but why go to an obviously Chinese restaurant and get rolls...",

    "text": "For our final evening in Vegas, my friend and I were interested in trying something low-key and decently affordable.  We had been walking the Strip all day and were finishing up at the Wynn, so a convenient stopoff seemed like the best option before heading back early to our hotel room.  Both my friend and I tend to favor Asian-style cuisine, so the beautiful Wazuzu seemed perfect.  The restaurant was only about one-third full when walked in around 7 pm on a Sunday evening.  The decor was quite shocking with the brightly painted red walls and massive glass dragon hanging along the back wall.  The environment seemed to be more of a Chinese influence than Japanese.  We were immediately seated and debated over trying the sushi or the hot meals.  When it comes to modernized Japanese places, I find that it is always a struggle to know which type of food they are known for (if any).   My friend ordered some sushi rolls, which she enjoyed well enough.  However, my Salmon Terriyaki Bowl was terrible.  The large bowl was almost three-fourths full of brown rice.  A very small helping of  sauteed peppers and onions was thrown in as well.  The salmon was dry, fishy, and bland.  It tasted like something you would get at a low-budget diner.  The sauce was flavorful, and obviously I had more than enough rice to soak it up with.  However, the fish was a disappointment and more vegetables would have been appreciated.  Wazuzu was a marginal experience, but not a place I would return to.  If you are looking for something similar, I would recommend Sushi Roku in Caesar's WAY before this place.",

It's actually the reason we decided to dine here.  The restaurant is on the smaller side and opens directly into the casino.  However the service and layout provide a pleasant experience.    My parents aren't huge fans of sushi (ok, I'll be honest they can't stand it) so I didn't sample any of the sushi items.  We stuck to the specialty menu and it did not disappoint.  We started with Tom Yum Goong soup and Miso soup - I had the Tom Yum and the flavor was perfectly balanced.  Yes, $14 is a bit steep for soup, but the three large prawns made up for the price tag.  The Wazuzu Pineapple Fried Rice was another big hit for me.  I also tried the Wazuzu Smasher (beverage).  I was expecting it to be pretty intense, given the name.  It had delicious crushed pineapple and the presentation was great, but it seemed to have very little if any alcohol.  I would suggest sticking to the sizable sake list.",

With Tal Ronnen coming to the Wynn properties and revamping their vegan menus, I have to say that all the restaurants at these resorts have seriously commendable options.   Our order:  Dim Sum : Gardein \"Chicken\" Shu Mai -Considering my experience with Shu Mai has been...nada....this was a new epicurean experience for me. The dish was executed well. It had the flavors of sesame oil and Chinese five spice. The Gardien was shaped to fit into the Shu Mai wrapper and steamed well. $9 for 4 (rather small) pieces  Dim Sum : Jade Dumplings -Spinach dumplings with shitake mushrooms. Steamed to come out as a translucent green dumpling, this was a treat to the eyes. I enjoyed the simple Asian flavors of these dumplings and for the heat-lover, the side of red chili in vinegar would kick up the notch a bit. Again $9 for 4 (rather small) pieces  Cantonese Fried Rice - Crispy white rice fried to perfection with mixed vegetables and slivered asparagus. This is how all fried rice should be. $16 for a bowl. I thought the pricing of this was rather ridiculous  Sweet and Sour Gardein \"Chicken\" - Now, when I read this on the menu, I immediately vetoed getting it. You see, Gardein makes a similar dish available in the frozen aisle. But my husband coerced me into OKing this order as he was sold after reading that the Gardein was crispy. The presentation was spectacular. The mix of the Gardein pieces, bell peppers and onions and sweet and sour sauce was scooped into a half piece of hollowed pineapple. And yes, this dish was not quite as similar as the frozen entree that is available at Whole Foods. The Gardein used had a different texture and shape and the sauce was definitely freshly prepared. I would (in a heartbeat) order this fantastic concoction again! $17 for the dish.  Our waiter, Mario was efficient and got us everything we needed in a timely manner. The restaurant itself is not exactly formal dining but nice enough to wear a pretty dress and strappy heels to. Jet Tila (the chef) was hanging around the place. This to me is a positive sign since he's actually looking at what's coming out of his kitchen.   I really like the menu here at Wazuzu and yes, it is pricey. But it's also pretty good.",

Usually we just ended up walking past the Southside Bar and enjoying the Encore Society Cafe.  As luck would have it, we got in last week and i got to finally experience Wazuzu!  Ehh. It wasn't bad. I just expected better..  The Good:  - the room! That crystal dragon on the wall is incredible! How can you not appreciate that in the background as you enjoy your meal?? - the pineapple fried rice was quite tasty and I really enjoyed it! -the roasted duck was pretty good as well. -they serve Singha! My favorite Thai beer!  - nice location in the Encore where you can get some great people watching/ eye candy in! lol  The not so good:  - the prices, but it is located inside the Wynn/Encore so it was to be expected - the long wait to get our food...was borderline rediculous.. - the service was okay. Not stellar, not great. Okay. Definitely expected better from a place inside the mighty Wynn complex - I'm so sorry-not sorry, but the drunken noodles were NOT all that. Most overhyped thing I've had since Bachi Burger (yea, I said it...bring it on)  Overall, I really feel Wazuzu was the quintessential 3 star experience. It was okay, but certainly not spectacular. At this price point I honestly don't see myself returning for another try. That being said, it wasn't all that bad.  3 stars.",

    "text": "After weeks of research, my friend found this place which seem to have great vegetarian and vegan options  to celebrate her husband's birthday. All of us from the east coast were meeting our friends at the west coast for our annual reunion.   I was so excited with their menu and we started ordering. For appetizers we ordered edamame dumplings and crispy Brussels sprouts. The Brussels sprouts were great, however the dumplings was sort of a disappointment. It was nothing over the top. For entree, my husband ordered the vegetable ramen which was super bland. I had the Nasi goren which was decent. My friends ordered the vegan drunken noodles and organic fried rice which were good but nothing out of the ordinary. The buddha's feast was again bland. So the food didn't meet the hype and we were ready for dessert.  Now since it was my friend's birthday, we had requested a candle be placed on the dessert before it was brought to the table. Our waiter conveniently forgot to place the candle. He actually came back to take our dessert place and asked us which flavour we esp liked. He almost seemed like he was going to bring in a complimentary dessert. However of course that didn't happen. Such a disappointment to our much hyped trip. The prices charged definitely didn't keep up to the service. We expected better from this place",

While everything was just OK, I wasn't impressed with the quality of ingredients. ESP their raw fish :(  Ordered: x Steamed Edamame x Tom Yum Goong Soup - soon yummy! This is probably one of my favorite soups ever. It was crisp and clean. x Baked Miso Black Cod - Tried to order the seabass, but they were out. Ordered this and found that it was just OK. Miso cod just tastes the same to me everywhere :/ Boyfie seemed to love it. x Salt & Pepper Prawns - Super flavorful, but what Chinese dish isn't? Anything drenched/cooked it loads of oil will taste great. It was too heavy for my liking. x Yellowtail Sashimi Appetizer - gross. IT WAS SO FISHY!!   I'm a sucker for ambience and pretty decor so this place did not disappoint. I'd come back for the pretty drinks and edamame, but I wouldn't come back to dine here.  Overall just an OK overpriced experience :)",

Since I'm allergic to seafood and most Asian restaurants use fish sauce or oyster sauce in their dishes, I'm happy to see that Wazuzu offers the vegetarian option. This was on Food Networks \"best thing I ever ate\" for their Drunken Noodles.  I get the Vegetarian Drunken noodles level 3 spicy. Level 3 is considered on the low end for their rating but my mouth is on fire and I'm a huge fan of spicy food. The spice makes the food taste better.  The drunken noodles with Thai tea is a fantastic choice.",

    "text": "I had an early dinner at Wazuzu on Sunday afternoon before departing from the Sin City and it did not disappoint. The prices are definitely on the high end, but what can you expect from a restaurant at the Encore. Especially since they have a $1.5 million crystal dragon on their wall.   Here is what I had:  Fresh-squeezed watermelon juice - SO refreshing especially after a long night of drinking at XS   Tuna Sashimi - 3 pieces of extremely fresh tuna, and they were in thick pieces too!   Sweet Shrimp Sushi - MELTS IN YOUR MOUTH BUTTERY PIECES OF SWEET SHRIMP. so good. i can literally have 10 of these in a row   Wazuzu Signature Dragon Sliders - these were so cool, the buns actually had dragon designs on them! (see picture) and the wagyu beef inside each bun was just SO tender and perfectly cooked. one thing I did not enjoy was the asian pickled veggies inside and I just took them out and enjoyed my bun that way! They are extremely expensive though - $38 for 3 small buns.   Drunken Noodles - this was featured on the Food Network's The Best Things I've Ever Ate, so you know they were amazing. you can choose the spicy level between 1 - 5, because my stomach was not feeling happy from the previous night's drinking, I went with a 3. It definitely had a kick, but not enough on a normal day. The noodles were really amazing though, it was one of the best pan-fried noodles I've ever had! Full of flavor from the basil.   Tuna tataki roll - amazing presentation and since I am a huge tuna lover, I really enjoyed it, a lot of spicy tuna and avocado, just the way I like it!  Personally, I liked this restaurant a lot more than Red 8, which is kind of the equivalent at Wynn. I think Wazuzu is better because I get to have a more Southeast Asian flavor in addition to Chinese food, and also really fresh sushi!",

    "text": "Wazuzu is a good Asian restaurant that marries a fusion of Asian foods, including Chinese, Japanese and hints of Indian (I think they use curry powders and other spices on some dishes) and Thai.  The prices are in one breath high, in another breath both fair and on par with other high end restaurants.  Dinner for 2 which included 3 entrees to share and an appetizer came in at about $100 before tip, and was enough food to even feed 3 people lightly or maybe even a small group of anorexic club going girls on their way to Surrender or XS that want to nibble while still looking good in their form fitting outfits.  We had the Albacore Sashimi, which I highly recommend, for $22 the portions were good.  The Miso Black Cod featured 2 respectfully sized pieces of fish over a bed of Chinese broccoli for $30.  The Wazuzu Fried Rice had a hint of Indian spice maybe curry and had some dried shrimp, 4 large prawns, some chinese sausage and duck with pineapple mixed into flavorful jasmine rice.   It was a bit on the greaser side, not so much light and fluffy, but very tasty.  The portion size is good for $23 and enough for a few to share with other dishes.  The Vegetarian Sweet and Sour \"Chicken\" (probably soy or tofu based) is all about the sauce, so less about chicken or mimicking the taste or flavor more so than the texture and cost $17  The service was friendly.  They, I don't think take reservations, so we only waited about 20-30 mins around 10pm on a Friday Night over Labor Day Weekend, so easily killed time walking around the casino and they called us when the table was ready.  I'd say this is a great place for larger parties of 4 or more to share in multiple dishes \"family style\" to enjoy all of the diverse tasty flavors they offer on their menu.  If you're Asian and more working class Asian American, you may be taken aback at paying over $20 for Chow Fun (a dish you can get at any Chinatown for about $6), but you're not in Chinatown and this is also not \"Panda Express\" (nor P.F. Changs or Pick Up Stix or buffet styled cuisine) either and is gourmet Asian food.  Some negative naysayers may call it \"White People's Asian Food\" but it's to me, simple good if not great food without any prejudice other than the known price tag of the dishes clearly visible on the menu and available to see before you commit to dining, posted outside of the restaurant.    I like this place to recommend it and revisit it again.",

The food is ok and at the end you're left with a large bill. You can get food for a fraction of the price just down the street in Chinatown and it tastes much better. With that said, you are at Encore and nothing is cheap here.  When I worked here I would comp everything & that ruined me for life because I was so spoiled. I so miss those days! Now if I'm paying over $20 for a sushi roll it better be amazing. As I said, the food is good but not mind blowing. I've had better sushi, pad thai & bbq buns.   If you find yourself at Encore or Wynn, splurge a little more and go to Botero, SW or Wing Lei. Yes these places are pricier but I've never had anything at them that was just good. Society Cafe and La Cave are also good options if you're not interested in splurging even more.  The service is great everywhere at these properties and every restaurant; even the casual ones are gorgeous.",

The manager even came over to apologize for the delay (there were a couple large tables and our order probably got stuck behind one of those) and offer a free dessert or after-dinner coffee item for each of us. I'll take it!   Our drunken noodles with tofu was amazing,  not spicy at all (we said we wanted a 2/5) and the free vegan brownie with chocolate sorbet was also good, however I probably wouldn't order the dessert again if it wasn't free.   Despite the long wait for our food this time, we will definitely be back.",

Rotti with curry: the 5 thin pieces of roti tasted good.  Curry had nice balance as well.  However, the best rotti in the Vegas vicinity is still hands down \"Island Malaysian\" in Chinatown (Spring Street).  2. Mongolian beef: delicious.  Beef was perfectly tender and sauce was perfect.  3. CA. Vegetarian fried rice: too much oil!! The cook needs to use a little more rice/veggies to balance out the dripping oil.  Flavor was fine though.  4. $9 for 4 pieces of shumei (which was delicious and fresh tasting, by the way).  However, we only ordered it because one of the VIP's in our party loved them.  Technically speaking, the food was \"mostly\" cooked well (chopping/prep, cooking temperature, wok technique, quantity of sauces & ingredients, etc.). The sous chef and line chefs must have been well trained.  Extra star for the decor--beautiful crystal dragon.  Great hostesses in the front too, really sweet!",

Your restaurant is located in the casino of Encore filled with degenerate gamblers smoking their way to lung cancer while gambling their kids college tuition away. Who am I offending with my hat on? Might need to rethink your policy on this one. Ok, now to the real issue. The amount of sodium and MSG in your food is honestly lethal. My best friends foot almost exploded in her boot before we could even make it back to the room. She had to take her shoe off in the elevator to examine her foot which had turned into a damn science experiment. This is not OK and incredibly dangerous. The last thing ANYONE needs in Las Vegas is an exploding MSG foot. When I returned to my room I went to use my laptop to check on the stock market but I was unable to do so because my fingers turned into sausage links. You could have cut my hand off and it would have floated into the atmosphere like a hot air balloon, it was so inflated from your potent sodium/MSG mix. I am not sure if you have Ratatouille back there making food but all we had was ONE (1) order of NOODLES. How do my extremities triple in size and my friends foot turn into a nuclear missile after consuming one bowl of noodles. Do you have any idea how unsafe the level of MSG must be for this to occur? What's the point by the way? 99% of the people that eat with you are blacked out and would eat cat food off the floor, no needy to trick them with harmful chemical food enhancements. Worst $110 I've ever spent on noodles. You should be ashamed of yourself.",

Service was fine, though not particularly attentive.  The food was of decent quality, but much of it not all that different than you'd get in a decent noodle place in LA or SF for about 1/6 the price.  Drunken Noodles appeared to be some form of the Thai Pad See Ew, and had decent flavor.  Nasi Goreng was surprisingly light; we ordered it \"spicy\" as possible, which served to prove they are on some sort of western spiciness calibration.  It was somewhat spicy, but not particularly so.  Chicken Lo Mein was predictable, though slightly more greasy than we appreciated.  Three vegetarian dim sum - Jade Dumpling, Palm Pocket, and White Lotus came in a nice steamer basket stack - they all had the same overly sticky wrapper in different forms with different fillings and together cost more than the entire dim sum meal for four we had at Ping Pang Pong.  Taste was good, but not particularly distinctive between the three forms.  Dessert of Ice Kachang was large but disappointingly icy.  I know it's a shaved ice dessert, but the texture left a lot to be desired.  Overall - not a bad choice if you're stuck in the Wynn and resigned to paying the price, but certainly not the pinnacle of Asian cuisine.",

    "text": "We were persuaded to visit after Giada de Laurentiis reco'd their drunken noodles as \"the best I ever ate with chopsticks\" on the Food Network.   Despite being \"booked\" for reservations online, the hostess at Wazuzu seated us promptly for dinner on a Sunday evening. We were seated on the outer perimeter of the restaurant closest to the slot machines.   On the table for review:  + Tom Yum Goong Soup - Thai hot and sour soup. Serving size is for one, but is easily split for two is AHMAZING and, aside from the Wynn Buffet, has made it to my personal \"must eat while in Vegas\" list. Perfectly balanced and well seasoned, with GIANT, tender prawns. This is the perfect cure to ANY hangover!   +/- Drunken noodles w/ beef - drunken? why drunken? the common hypothesis being that the noodles and other sauteed fixin's are absolutely doused in sauce! Other than the celebrity chef appeal, these noodles had little remaining gusto going for them. It's not bad (not overly greasy, too spicy, or too small - definitely fares as a larger sharing dish), but it's not great. I even dare say that I've had better flat wide noodle dishes in a hole in the wall Asian restaurant in Los Angeles. Sorry Giada!   + Salt & Pepper Prawns - GORGEOUS. PHOTO WORTHY. WILL HAVE YOUR TASTE BUDS DANCING! TOTALLY RECOMMEND!!! For a dish that is indeed deep fried, it is perfectly crisp and light. My guilty pleasure is ordering a side of rice and scooping up the remaining fried tidbits of garlic, onion, and jalapeno and mixing it together just to get the last bits of amazingness.   Coming back for more? ABSOLUTELY! I wish Wazuzu had other locations beside Las Vegas, I would order out from here weekly if not monthly if I could.   Great destination for:  * casual date  * Asian fusion  * when you're too lazy to walk around a buffet line * before you hit up the slots",

The pad thai tasted very clean and simple without too much spice to distract the taste. The Wazuzu roll was also good. My only disappointment with Wazuzu was my expectation for the food was very high. You can find a similar pad thai dish around town and you can buy an AYCE for the price of one Wazuzu roll, which was good but not exceptional. The food is a safe bet.",

Crispy Brussels Sprouts were heavenly - and I tolerate Brussels sprouts normally. Crispy Orange Beef another winner, the seafood fried rice filled with crab, shrimp and scallops the only average dish was the Thai beef salad.  If we had room we were going to try the Wazuz White Chocolate Pear - maybe next time!   I'd go again!",

If I lived in Vegas I would definitely be back weekly! So good!",

Our server took 20Min just to take our order and when the soups came it was warm and not how you expect a bowl of soup to be.. however the main course we all ordered was delicious.  They are family style and I would recommend to order a few things for everyone to share at the table (their plates are pretty big)   My favorite was the Drunken Noodles!!!",

    "text": "There was one item on the menu that caught my attention enough to make us want to have dinner here: Gardein Chick'n Pot Stickers. These dumplings filled with steamed chick'n and cabbage had the kind of flavor that reminded me of my meat eating days (in a good way). Just this one item alone made me so happy, I would've given this place 5-stars. <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2jTUMHi&s=73f38c729017357ee2b5ec555ce98ef142c696bbaf7d788c13292e5226ed8901\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/2jTUMHi</a>  But it only got better from here!  Palm Pocket was a mix of hearts of palm, corn, ginger, garlic. I loved the bit of crunchiness from the filling. <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2kPFNQd&s=2d0a46166698c2087c5812ab36460f5e60e461d6bd2b3029548d0368424f50b8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/2kPFNQd</a>  Buddha's Feast had this amazingly tasty brown garlic sauce tossed in with baby bok choy, bell peppers, bean sprouts, and other hearty veggies. I considered licking the plate when we finished this. <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2kOX20Y&s=76ae67bab0c49e64d6d3bf45e91cb01adc420d9ee4f702ca0ec1b0287d1615b5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/2kOX20Y</a>  We ended the evening with a Chocolate Brownie and a scoop of Raspberry Lychee Sorbet. Definitely one of the best vegan brownies I've ever had! Dense, moist, light caramelization from the sugar. I loved that the sorbet was equally as awesome as the brownie. I've never had those fruit flavors mixed together and it works well. The chocolate rice crispies sprinkled on top added a nice texture. <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2jTSh7H&s=258b866c1fbde0666611cc2596dedd6bd630b02fefcceaeb2d355bd4e8ae9ba3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/2jTSh7H</a>  Note to vegans: The chocolate decoration wedged in the sorbet is not vegan. <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2keRDAt&s=a7f943f228e05b5d6379eb9283a832f5b094744080feeebeaf9f5bc3cd2e4689\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/2keRDAt</a>  The atmosphere is fancy and pretentious. But hey, it's Vegas and a little pretentiousness never hurt anybody. Our waiter was super helpful when it came to knowing the vegan-ness of the dishes. In fact, he was the one who made sure the Meateater BF ate the milk chocolate garnish in our dessert. I also appreciate that this place is open late. I'm not used to vegan-friendly restaurants staying open past 10pm.",

We checked twice with the staff that there was no egg in the prawn hargow dish and fed it to my son who is severely allergic to eggs. After the dish was over, a waiter came over and said the dish contained a small amount of eggs!! The manager came back to confirm there were no eggs so my son was safe. But it freaked us out and ruined our meal. We weren't impressed that the manager did not discount our meal as a courtesy.",

The shrimp is actually decently sized. Even my mother who doesn't like Thai food enjoyed the drunken noodles.   We also ordered the special crab roll with spicy tuna, dumplings, and Bok Choy. The dumplings aren't anything special. Personally, I'd do without.",

The chicken curry comes in a decent portion and feeds two of us. We always ask for extra curry on the side because it's that good.   The Mongolian beef is also delicious and comes with bell peppers and onions. The portion is good too, and I always ask for a side of their chili sauce to add some more spice.   For dessert, we always get the coconut crepe. My mom doesn't even like coconut and she likes this dessert. It comes with a scoop of coconut ice cream on top and doesn't taste like it's too heavy like usual desserts.   Definitely recommend this place to anyone who is craving quality Chinese food!",

    "text": "Came here with Mr. Piano for a dinner away from the rest of our traveling party, and it's a lovely restaurant with really nice service :)  I chose Wazuzu because, as one of the Wynn restaurants, it has vegetarian options. I was really hoping for vegan ramen, but while there is a vegetarian ramen, the noodles have egg and I have an egg allergy. I ended up getting the Vegan Drunken Noodles with the Gardein protein. I requested mushrooms, but I think it got lost in the order. It was a fairly standard vegetarian drunken noodle dish for me, so while it was good, it wasn't anything to write home about and probably not worth $24. I split a shitake mushroom sushi with Mr. Piano and also got the Blue Lychee Cooler, which I honestly expected to have more blueberry and lychee flavor, but really is more of a (pricey)lemonade. The sushi was really simple for what it was, and it was good, but absolutely not worth the price. It's also possible that I should have ordered different things.  Mr. Piano got the Shoyu Ramen, and was dazzled by the soy egg (aji-tamago), which from what he described was a soft-boiled egg soaked in soy sauce, likely with a bit of sugar (in case you were wondering what a \"soy egg\" was). I think he enjoyed his meal quite a bit more than mine, so perhaps the dishes are significantly better if you're not a vegetarian and don't have an egg allergy, but I can only review what I experienced.  The wait-staff were really friendly and seemed knowledgeable about the menu, which was really useful. Also, they ask right off the bat about food allergies and whether anyone would like the vegetarian menu, so that was nice. The decor is lovely, and we sat under the eponymous dragon (apparently the giant crystal dragon's name is Wazuzu, or so they told the kid at the next table).  Overall, a solid restaurant and a good place for a romantic evening out (if you don't get seated right next to very vocal children, anyway), but I wasn't as impressed by the food as the prices and decor led me to believe I ought to be.",

I had to check them out!  I am glad I did. They were amazing! and yes, expensive, but you're eating in the encore, so what do you expect? They are the best drunken noodles I have ever had, vegan or otherwise.   I also had palm pockets, and jade dumplings. The palm pockets were better, don't think I would get the jade dumplings next time. Probably didn't need either since my noodles were filling (and 21 bones).   Service was good, waitress was very knowledgeable and helpful, I would go back again!",

    "text": "At first glance, Wazuzu seems like yet another ordinary asian restaurant that tries too hard to offer the foods of various asian cultures, and marked up simply for being in the Wynn/Encore. However, don't be fooled!  While many of the dishes are merely ordinary, the Drunken Noodle here is second to none. In fact, this was featured on the food network as one of the best things some chef has ever eaten. This is simply not an exaggeration! The noodles are very Q, all of the meat selection (chicken, shrimp or beef) are of top quality, and the portion is actually quite large. If you are a fan of spicy foods, get a 4 (on their hotness scale from 1-10). Depending on the chef, the chili pepper used differs. This is probably the only consistency issue, and it really affects how spicy a 4 really is.  I've also tried a few of their fried rice, the tom yum soup, and lobster. The fried rice is also well-portioned, but probably not worth the money. The tom yum soup was interesting, but I got a 4 on the spicy scale and it literally burned my tongue off! SO, SO spicy (problem with the consistency...). The lobster, which was extremely expensive ($100+), was also mouth-wateringly delicious! The lobster is de-shelled, fried and pan-fried with garlic and other herbs. This was surprisingly tasty!!!   Anyway, come here for the Drunken Noodle. It is a little pricey at about $25, but you will not regret it!",

So gracious that she allowed my friend to enter with slippers.  Yes, that's right a pair of slippers.  After having walked 6 miles on the strip the night before, his new shoes proved to be painful.  He donned a pair of slippers for the remainder of the trip and thank goodness they let us in.    The table my friend and I sat at had 1 seat that faced the crystal dragon and 1 seat that faced the people in the walkway and red chandeliers . Both views were stunning and we relished our time here.    The food took a little while to come out, though good things come to those who wait, right? Of all 4 vegetarian dumplings - jade, shu mai, white lotus and palm pocket, we liked the palm pocket the most.     In addition, the drunken noodles were very good as was his chicken salad. Between the vegetarian dim sum, the setting and gracious help, we were enthralled to say the least.    Looking forward to getting back here as often as possible.   It is simply the most glamourous vegetarian dim sum setting I have ever been in.",

Wazuzu has a $1M crystal dragon adorning a wall and there are only maybe 15 tables in the whole restaurant.  Amazing decor.  Food is overpriced and not super good.  I give it four stars instead of three because of decor and the curry dish, otherwise it's a very three star experience and two star value.  Have tried three items:  Roti Panang Starter (5 stars/$12): Delicious!  Like a combination between traditional yellow curry and a Thai coconut milk Tom Ka Gai soup.  Neat, warm slices of naan-like flatbread to accompany.  Drunken Noodles (3.5 star/$24) This dish is overhyped.  Spicy and sweet, it is good but not something to rave about.  Lobster Roll (3 star): Again, at $30 this roll better be amazing, and it's not amazing, it's just a good, quality-prepared, but generic-tasting, boring sushi roll that doesn't have much flavor or pizzazz.  I just get the feeling this restaurant is going through the motions a little bit.",

We chose Wazuzu because other reviewers compared their Asian restaurants to Wazuzu.  Additionally, our evening was going to start at XS in Wynn, so we wanted to find a restaurant in the vicinity.  Wazuzu did not disappoint.  My girlfriend got Panang Curry and I got Nasi Goreng (look up the menu for the descriptions).  What we got doesn't matter as much as the fact that is was delicious.  Food was top quality and while its difficult for me to praise Asian food that isn't from a NY Chinese restaurant, I have to give this credit, it was superb.  The atmosphere is also beautiful.  The Wynn in general is a gorgeous resort, and this restaurant follows right along.  From the giant crystal dragon to the tables and decorations - you really feel like you're in for a classy treat.  Service was fantastic, and our waitress even followed us around the restaurant to help take our picture in a better location (under the crystal dragon).  I'd post the pics, but then Yelp would have the rights to them.  Anyway, if you want really good Asian food in a classy restaurant that might be a bit pricey but won't break your wallet, head to Wazuzu.   Piece of advice though - they don't take reservations.  We were told they tend to go on longer waits (30 mins+) on the weekends around 8:30.  We got there at around 8:00-8:15 and got sat right away.",

Don't ask me why my father in law decided to wear a tank to dinner but it happened.  We were able to get seated right away. Overall the design was beautiful and cozy. However the music was too unbeat and didn't fit the atmosphere. I ordered the nasi goreng and loved it. However, it basically just a rice dish so I was glad we were sharing other entrees at the table. We also ordered 3 other dishes, so 4 entrees for 4 people. It was way too much food! The panang curry was my favorite out of all the other dishes. I also liked that you can tell them how spicy you want any dish. I like spicy food and they certainly didn't let me down. Great spice level at #4.   I would definitely go back and would get the Panang for sure.",

My favorite dish from here is the chicken curry and coconut crepe for something a little sweeter. I also like the drunken noodles. They have different spice levels, ranging from 1 to 5. I usually get 3 and it's a little spicy but not too overwhelming.  Portions are pretty reasonable. Sometimes I can share my chicken curry with another person and sometimes when I'm really hungry, I can finish the dish on my own.  The decor inside here is top class, as are most of the restaurants in Wynn/Encore. A great stop to eat at if you're around the area!",

A beautiful crystal dragon adorns the wall the back corner table features a lazy susan for larger parties wishing to go family style.  The food here is excellent and the menu features many styles of Asian food such as Japanese, Chinese, Vietnamese and Thai. My favorites are the Red Dragon Roll, Drunken Noodles and Pineapple Fried Rice (without the dry shrimp).  The service is pretty good but I have had quite a few hiccups here over the years. Most recently, it took about 15 minutes to get the check after our party was finished and a botched order request at my previous visit.   The food quality warrants a 5 Star review but Wazuzu is no bargain as the prices are definitely on the high side. Unfortunately the service doesn't live up to the 5 stars either.   Despite my complaining, I'm a regular and love that I can order Wazuzu from the poker room.",

I ordered the drunken noodles with chicken, my boyfriend ordered the crispy beef, roti panang as appetizer, lychee mojito and mango martini as drinks. Everything was superb.  The drunken noodles had amazing flavor. Just amount of sauce and spice that I asked for. The roti panang was perfect! Creamy, flavorful, spicy, and perfect amount of chicken and veggies. I've never had it with roti (thin bread almost like a tortilla, but more bread-like) and it was genius. My boyfriend love panang and orders it at almost every Thai place we go to. Even he was impressed. The crispy beef was SO good- also comes in big portion. Our drinks were delicious and refreshing. We really wanted to order the Thai crepe as dessert, but we were in a rush.   The service was also fantastic! She made great recommendations and even though we asked many questions and did the whole \"should I get this or that\", she was upbeat she positive with her recommendations and responses. We were both extremely satisfied with our meal and would definitely come back!   The prices are pretty high, but what else do you expect from the Wynn/Encore? High prices but also high quality food and service. Also love how custom the restaurant is. It's beautiful, unique and only available at the Encore. Definitely creates that luxury and special experience, compared to going to a mom and pop or chain restaurant. Our two entrees, brown rice, appetizer, and two drinks came out to about $105 before tax.",

    "text": "Came with high expectations but left with disappointment, twice. First time, I ordered the Pad Thai, which should be a safe dish that you can't go wrong with; it was the blandest Pad Thai I've ever had. I even tried salvaging it with dunks of soy sauce and it couldn't be saved. Least to say, my $12 NYC takeout noodles surpassed their dish.   We decided to give it a second shot as we wanted some quick Asian food before our flight. I had the Tonkatsu Ramen, and, again, it fell flat. The broth was incredibly watery for a broth that's meant to be creamy and needed a huge dose of more flavor/umami taste (soy sauce again couldn't save this dish). Also, they added cooked bean sprouts, an ingredient normally used in Vietnamese/Chinese (or other Asian) dishes; I've personally never had bean sprouts in ramen and don't think it normally belongs. The crunch in the bean sprouts (which is suitable for dishes like pho or egg noodles) completely distracted and took away from what was supposed to be the chewiness of the ramen noodles.   The only saving grace in this restaurant is the portion size, but with the expensive price tag that comes with the underwhelmingly bland food, I would never come back and eat here. The chef at Wazuzu needs to really change his/her taste palette because the current flavors and standards fall well behind and cater to only Caucasian tastes. For an Asian-inspired hotel/casino that guests a large amount of Asians, we were highly disappointed by Wazuzu. You're better off eating Asian food at the buffet or even room service at Encore, which was actually really good.",

    "text": "Honestly I didn't know whether to give this place a 1 or 2 star review, but due to the decent Thai Iced Coffee that I had and the service, I've decided to give it a 2.  This is by far some of the most inauthentic Asian food I've ever had--but never mind authenticity. This is truly some bad food. First of all, I can't believe the prices are about 2-3x what I would see at any other normal asian restaurant, the food is maybe a quarter of the taste of what I would get.  We ordered the nigiri, the roti and curry, the cucumber salad, the seaweed salad, the kimchi fried rice, and the thai drunken noodles. The nigiri was the only redeeming quality of this meal--it was actually very fresh and the fish was very good quality. It is the ONLY thing I would recommend getting if you must eat at Wazuzu. As for everything else, it was pretty much too salty, not enough flavor, or really just not that good. Do NOT get the cucumber salad unless you just want to order a small bowl of cucumbers with maybe some salt and vinegar on them, but really no flavor overall. The seaweed salad was a standard seaweed salad. As for the roti and curry, I love me a good roti and this was fine, but the curry was some of the thickest, sweetest, displeasant curries I have ever had. The kimchi fried rice was just a ton of soy sauce or some savory sauce and really no kimchi flavor. They say it's a \"house made\" kimchi which is quite obvious considering even store bought kimchi packs a stronger flavor and better taste than whatever they serve here. The thai drunken noodles were also extremely disappointing. They were absolutely way too salty and honestly tasted like wide noodles and soy sauce with some shrimp on top.  Wazuzu is really one of the worst restaurants that I have ever been to and I am extremely disappointed that the Encore would even considering serving these dishes.",

You're immediately drawn to the main wall where it had a gigantic but beautiful, crystal dragon, which is rumored to be $1million in cost, it was quite impressive.   The service was on point. The waiter had a very strong accent, but nonetheless super happy and friendly. He always filled our water glasses, as well as helped us with the menu selection. Their prices and portion were decent.   We ordered the shrimp dim sum which were great little pillows of goodness. I could have just ate that all night.  We also got the drunken noodles, which were featured as Giada De Laurentiis favorite dish on \"Best Thing I Ever Ate\" and the Kalbi beef. All the food were nicely flavored and not too greasy. We ended with Rotti bread and their homemade coconut ice cream.   Over all it was a well balance meal with great service and atmosphere. I will definitely come back again this is a  5/5!!!",

And the spicy sauces are actually spicy (for those with a sensitive palate like my mother).  And be specific - \"sauce on the side\" apparently means \"the bottom of the plate is okay\".   Fine by me, the gluten-soy-spicy food lover at the table. More sushi goodness I don't need to worry about sharing.   Lovely ambiance in the lobby of the Wynn. Of course everything Steve Wynn touches turns to elegant and enjoyable.   Great drink menu and good wine list (yes I drink red wine with literally everything, even fish. I've never been one to follow the rules).   Impressive dinner, we really enjoyed ourselves, but glad my dad was footing the bill.",

    "text": "For the past 6 years, I've been here every time we have visited Las Vegas and stayed at the Encore/Wynn. We end up staying at the Wynn/ Encore because it has the best night club in town ,but also because it offers variety of cuisines to do brunch and dinner right at the hotel. Different from other hotels we can always expect food that will satisfy our palettes with exceptional service that beats NYC out of the waters. However, though I've noticed the service has gotten a lot better and more attentive over the years including Wazuzu, it seems many of the restaurants have lost their touch in their cooking. The prices have risen by a few dollars ,but portions seem to have gotten slightly bigger which balances everything out. Unfortunately, the taste isn't what it used to be. I will probably be staying at the Wynn this coming winter again. I hope the restaurants step up their game because I could tell places like Bellagio and Aria are working on their restaurant experience. We love the experience Wynn/Encore has been offering  so far. So please keep it that way because I would hate to diverge my loyalty elsewhere.",

As I walked in to the host I gave her my room number they sat us down within minutes.. We literally sat there for like 13min before someone acknowledge us. The place is small so there is no chance to miss a customer seating there with no water or no menus... One the waiter came he tried very hard to suck up. I was very hungry so i went with it. We ordered the sushi chefs special and a server put it on our table so fast , she didn't even explain to us what the \"chefs\" special was . She didn't ask or bring sauces .. i sat there looking around trying to get someones attention so i could order some ponzu sauce. this sushi was so BLAH nothing special about it the most simple rolls i could have gotten down the street at a  fast food place back home. we also ordered the wok Mongolian beef and that was okay nothing special. the only thing that i though was nice was their lychee mojito. overall i was already rubbed the wrong way by their service and than the food was not worth the money. I was very disappointed of this place after spending all my mornings watching amazing insider reviews on the wynn's tv channel. i dont know maybe this is more targeted for the vegans since i did see alot of people ordering vegan food (by the way the seating is very close so yes you will see exactly what your neighbor is eating) I wouldn't recommend this to a friend i much rather go to sushi samba in the palazzo.",

    "text": "First learned of drunken noodles from a Cooking Channel show, & w/ further research, that from Wazuzu seems a must-try.  However, being 10 hours away, my first taste had to come from other nearby places and even tried making my own. Then I had Wazuzu's the other day, and I must say it was good, but it was just as good as mine at home.  This isn't taking anything away from Wazuzu. Heck, it's the closest if not the only good pad kee mao on the strip.  If anything, I'll take it as a benchmark, and dammit, nailed it.  The place itself is fine, right by the casino.  Customer service was good.  Misis had beef curry, and KiT had tonkotsu ramen.  Both were fine considering a pretty sophisticated Asian restaurant, just fine if you REALLY must have ramen.  As for the Thai items, I say if you're in town, you have yet to have your first ever drunken noodle, and you have to have one then and there, then why not?  Expect prices to be just as up there as a cup of coffee at the Bellagio.  Otherwise, try some of your local Thai eats and have them hold the fillers except for basil, garlic, onions, tomatoes, the heat, the sauces, and the egg.  Oh, and if they offer extra-wide noodles, say \"yes, please.\"",

Got the Cantonese Assorted Barbecue Plate as an appetizer which includes roast duck, barbecued pork and cooked red spareribs.  Duck was nearly inedible unless you love pure fat, pork was just ok and the ribs were fairly flavorless.  I got the Drunken Noodles with beef.  I was asked if I wanted it spicy.  Absolutely!  Came out out fine but just not a lot of flavor and definitely not spicy.  Skip it.    One would think that in such a beautiful hotel the restaurants would be better.",

The restaurant itself was adorable and if you get a casino-side seat, the people-watching is great.    The food was just okay and certainly not worth what we paid (I know Vegas is spendy and I do not paying for good food).  My miso soup was super close to being delicious but was incredibly underseasoned. I added lobster to it and it was somewhat chewy.  I ordered the Thai Silk and it was tasty but not amazing.  The rolls we ordered were pretty good but the butter lobster roll was somewhat disappointing.  The roll itself was good but you expect a more lobster-forward flavor from something called \"Butter Lobster.\"    I almost always check Yelp before eating somewhere and I didn't here.  Towards the end of my meal when I checked in as a reminder to myself to review, I saw the 3.5 stars and am definitely in agreement.",

Excellent, and if you haven't gathered frommmy other reviews we are veey much Asian, noodle lovers,  and picky. I had asked for spicy and the waitperson was surprised when I said 4 on a scale of 1 to 5.  I could have easily went to 5.  This restaurant is super elegant, and very beautiful within the Wynn Encore Casino/Hotel.  The menunis very broad and many choices. Service was good, but not overly friendly; a bit stuffy and stiff.  I had a Japanese draft beer and it came in a really tall slender glass.    This is a very pleasant choice for a really good meal, nice decor, and not outrageous prices.",

The menu was mainly sushi and we thought \"eh, we're in the desert, sushi won't be fresh\" and BOY were we wrong!   We didn't have reservations so we put our names down and they took down our cell phone numbers to call us when they have a seat, about a half hour. So we went to another bar nearby for drinks. After the second drink at the bar, they called us and the bartender told us that we can take our drinks to the restaurant, it makes it way around so I walked over with a cocktail to get seated.  While we were waiting to get seated, 2 sets of mom and daughters were giving me dirty looks and laughing at me and made a comment about me wearing a tight dress, when they're all clad in low cut shirts and skirts (If you can't wear a tight dress in Vegas, where can you wear it, right?!!)  Then when we got seated, one of the daughters yelled \"wtf!?! We were here first!\" not knowing that we had been waiting for a half hour but they called to seat us. I think they left because I didn't see them in the restaurant. I didn't need that negative energy around me anyway.   We were seated at the booth in the back wall by the crystal dragon, I was very impressed with it. The pears? not so much, it was a weird theme of golden pears and crystal dragon. Eh well.   Our waitress was this spunky asian woman who knows her stuff and she has a personality and jokes to boot. I loved having her as our waitress, I wish I remembered her name. To start, we got edamame, some cocktails, then we got sushi and a side of pork fried rice because I love that stuff! Everything was phenomenal!  The sushi was so fresh! I don't get it! We're in the desert!?! So why the great sushi!?!? I think it's flown in every day from how it tastes. Goodness! We decided to pace ourselves and eat the pork fried rice and if we were still hungry, we'd order another sushi roll, because it was that good!   We decided against it and got dessert instead. I went with the ice chachang to finish off our meal because it reminds me of Singapore. It was delicious! Needed more shaved ice but I wasn't complaining, the flavors were all there.   Then when we're about to leave, the host offered to get photos of us with our camera and she made sure she got the crystal dragon in the photo as well! Very cool! Great food, great customer service and wonderful decor will get anyone to come back again! We will be back the next time we're in Vegas!",

I am still day-dreaming about the melt-in-your mouth dishes! I went with my cousin, aunt, and uncle on our last night in Vegas... Here's what we loved:  - pork potstickers: four big, juicy potstickers with yummy dipping sauce. These were so amazing that we had to get a second order!  - thai beef salad: very spicy with great thai flavors. I mostly ate the veggies rather than the beef... this dish tasted SO fresh!  - pork & shrimp shumai: four much small pieces; these were a bit too small in my opinion but very good and came in a cute little box  - pineapple fried rice: pork, chicken, and prawns served within fried rice served in a pineapple. Most tables seemed to order this as I saw a lot of pineapples going by. Pineapple fried rice is always good but this was the best I've ever had!  - bbq platter: tons of chicken, pork, etc in a chinese bbq style with a yummy dipping sauce  - salt and pepper prawns: good taste but I would have preferred non-fried prawns (I didn't know these ones would be fried...). The prawns were huge though!  - green tea and red tea mochi balls: I LOVE mochi and these were great ones!  The prices were a bit high ($10-$14 for appetizers, $13 - $26 for a main) but really very reasonable for Vegas especially for such unbelievable food! The servers were all very nice though not very talkative and the venue overlooking the casino is nice and comfy. I thought that Red 8 at the Wynn was great but Wazuzu at Encore is even better!",

The food was good.  We ordered vegan drunken noodles with Garden Chicken (aka fake chicken), jade dumpling, prawn dumplings, and chicken drunken noodles. (Drunken noodles are similar to Pad See Ew with some extra spices to it.) I washed it down with Thai Iced Tea.  Each entree was about $23, dumplings were $9, and tea was $5.  Total damage (including tip) was $90 for two people.  Overall, this is a good eatery on the strip.  It's not worth the $ though, so if you don't mind driving to Chinatown, then I would go there.",

We ordered the Vegan Crunch Roll and Jade Dumplings to start. Although the crispy rice balls on the roll were a little different, it didn't do anything for flavor. Kind of unnecessary. The dumplings lacked flavor and tasted kind of bland, which was disappointing, considering they were visibly packed with mushrooms and spinach.   My sis ordered the Tonkotsu Ramen, while I had the Veggie. I must say that both of our noodles were very generous with the portions, especially mine with the veggies. What was a little off/odd was the mixture of Choy Sum and Spring Salad in mine. How about either or? Preferably sticking with the Asian veggies, of course. I also had plenty of mushrooms. My sister finished the rest of my noodles, as I finished the rest of the roll and dumplings. We both agreed that both of the noodles lacked some flavor. We weren't expecting traditional or authentic Asian, but thought there would be some more flavor.  My sister also had jasmine green tea, and she was given a whole pot instead of just a cup.  Next time I'm in town, I wouldn't mind trying some of their other dishes, as they have a considerable amount of veggie options.",

When I asked the hostess if my friends name was on the list, they were already inside eating, I was informed that there weren't any names matching theirs in the list. They pretended to look while telling me this. Then i told them that it was ok, I'd just call them. Before I could get my phone out, a man that looked like a shift manager or a manager, I'm not sure, told me there was a dress code. All the while looking at me as if I was some homeless person. I then informed him that I would be back in different attire. By the time I came back, changed, my friends had long since finished their meal. They told me it was best that I hadn't been able to dine with them, because the food was sub par. I wouldn't have been upset if they had just informed me nicely that there was a dress code, it's understandable, however; to be treated so rudely all because of what I happened to be wearing is not acceptable.",

    "text": "To be fair, giving this place a 3 is leaning on the more generous side. It's not terrible, mind you, but its sooo not worth the price. Maybe I didn't try the right things. Or maybe I just had too high of expectations. But whatever the reason...I WAS SO. DISAPPOINTED.  I had really high hopes coming into this place and perhaps that was my downfall. But I mean, after my friends raved on and on about it and seeing Chef Jet Tila perform on Iron Chef, how could I not be? I just kept thinking 'Damn, Tila's gonna blow my mind with some Pan-Asian FUSION!'...but no. Far, far from it...  Panang Curry with Roasted Duck (recommended by the Server): It's whatevs. Very heavy on the coconut milk, not enough spices. Decent amount of duck but the duck was just ok. Would've been better if the skin was crispy and it was placed on top of the curry instead of cooked in it but at least it wasn't super greasy. Nothing special though.  Vege Pad-Thai: This had to be one of the worst pad-thai's I've ever tried in my life. Other than a slight sour taste from the lime slice I squeezed in, it was heavily under seasoned and the bits of tofu just blended in with all the other bland things.   Drunken Noodles: Pretty good flavor. Really not bad but WAAAAY too salty for my tastes, which is saying a lot since I usually like quite a bit of salt.  The Thai Iced Tea, however, was SUPER YUMMY!! Made the legit way with tea on the bottom and cream on the top, served in the perfect sized/shaped glass...mmMmmMmm...thick, flavorful, deliciousness!  As a side note, awesome crystal dragon decor and I did get to meet/take a picture with Tila (who was very humble and chill). So that was pretty cool. But as a wise man once said, should've just stuck with the picture...cause you can't disappoint a picture.",

    "text": "Yet another overpriced Wynn restaurant with average food. As much as I love staying at the Wynn/Encore I'm struggling to get past the grossly overpriced food.  We tried the drunken noodles and Malaysian fried rice. Both were average in taste, presentation and portion size but with the Wynn price penalty. It's like paying for an oil change on a BMW....$120 instead of $30 on a Honda. If you want the convenience of average Asian food in the Wynn/Encore at a ridiculous pride then give the up-the-wazu a try.",

The interior was nicely decorated. We sat right under the dragon, which was so cool to see. Our server was nice but didn't talk much. He was nice enough to take a bunch of photos for us, since it was my birthday. We all ordered drinks and then a bottle of the coconut sake, which was to die for! After reading the reviews on here I wasn't sure about ordering sushi, but my brother did and I split a roll with him and it was really good! I don't know why other people had such issues with it. (it was the spicy tuna roll) I liked it and I Don't even like tuna! The menu had something for everyone! I ended up ordering lo mein with shrimp, it was delicious! Actually everyone that was with me loved the food and said it was one of the best places we went to during our trip. Since they knew it was birthday they even gave me a free desert! I recommend planning on staying longer than just dinner to see the Wynn, its an amazing hotel, and this was one of the few casinos I won a decent amount on slots! And I also recommend Wazuzu! Amazing all around! Couldn't ask for a better place for my birthday!",

    "text": "Let me share with u fellow yelpers about the experience I received from this restaurant...I hope they don't delete this review just like my bad review of Red Chair Salon in SF that was deleted with no apparent reason.   It was around 9 pm that me n my friend was starving to death since we were too busy to walk around the strip to actually stop to have a nice meal. we figure that we could have a really nice dinner to make us full...so after several restaurants menu we read along the way...we stopped at Wazuzu n decide to try it out. we sat down and it took the waitress about 15 minutes to acknowledge us to take our order. the waitress came n it was this old chinese lady.....usually they don't really understand english very well but since its an upscale restaurant I decided to give her the benefit of the doubt. so I asked her \"how many pieces of sushi do you get in the Crunchy Roll special menu?\" she said \"Its a ROLL!! what do u think? its usually 6 pieces!\" she was giving me an attitude!! even my friend across the table was shocked! so being the sassy girl that I am...I replied \"Well since its not written on the menu...how was anyone supposed to know that its 6 pieces?!?!?!? some places has 8 or 10 so its not my fault that I don't know these things...not to mention lady this is my first time at this restaurant!\" I can't believe that the first question I asked her she gave me an attitude!! I mean hello???? it was $21 for that specific roll! of course I'm gonna ask u questions when its $21 per roll!!!   Then I took a deep breath n asked her \"how big is the portion for the Minced Salmon with green onion?\" and she respond \"Its in a bowl!!\"  I'm like ?????? how big is the bowl?!?!??! by this point I was just so mad n hungry so I just basically ordered my roll n spicy hot wings with rice n thai ice tea. before I finish telling u the whole story..let me break down the price of the things I ordered:  Crunchy Roll $21 Spicy hot wings $12 White rice $5 Thai ice tea $5  Now the Spicy hot wings turned out to be sweet...I have no idea where the spicy words come from. and the roll turned out to be covered in this little japanese fried balls that taste pretty weird with the shrimp tempura, cucumber, seaweed n rice (which is what a crunchy roll is) well I am paying $21 for this stinking roll..so I might as well eat it instead of wasting it. So I decided to take off this little tiny fried balls with my chopstick and just eat the plain sushi by itself. then that waitress stopped by n I kid u not this is what she said to me \"U are one spoiled girl huh????\" I'm like \"EXCUSE ME?!?!?!\" \" YEAH..I CAN TELL THAT UR SPOILED BY THE WAY U PICK AT UR FOOD\" ohhhhhh man!! I can't believe her!! I mean just because I don't like the little fried ball things n picking it out doesn't mean I'm spoiled!! n who is she to tell me that I'm SPOILED?!?!? I'M HER FREAKIN' CUSTOMER!!! WOWW!!! NEVER IN MY LIFE I RECEIVED SUCH BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE!!  So being the nice girl that I am...I dont like to make a scene instead I decided not to tip her cuz u know what?? the hell with it...I always tip at restaurants even when the customer service was bad. but this time hell no! she is not getting a dime from me n plus the overpriced bad food cannot make up the bad customer service! n really the thai ice tea was the only thing that was decent in that place. I mean c'mon they charge $8 for green tea!!!! Most places its free!!! Hello?!??!?!? if that's not overpriced I don't know what is...n rice for $5?!?!? white rice?!??! yeah u do the math and save ur money to go eat somewhere else.",

Several hours after lunch I had a short case of food poisoning. I felt very nauseous and couldn't move. I stayed in bed the rest of the day.

The panang curry was also good.  Spice level was accurate for what was requested.  A few suggestions to the restaurant:  1) too much coconut milk in the curry.  try cutting back a bit as it was too milky.  2)  add more vegatables to the curry or cut back on the sauce.  3)  if you're going to serve curry, then the rice should be included with the dish.  I've not been to an Asian/Thai restaurant where the rice was extra (particularly since they're charging $5 for the bowl on top of the curry).  Rice is inexpensive, include it in the meal.  Other than that, i'd recommend the location as a worthwhile stop.",

The one drawback I found was it was open to the casino, which really made it much more casual than it should have been.  I had the mongolian beef, which was superb, while my wife had an assortment of sushi.  For a starter we had the wonton soup, which is one of the 5 best wonton soups I've ever had (right up there with Wo-Hop's in NYC and Jade Palace in Scottsdale).",

This place deserves a lot of credit for taking dishes that are fairly familiar and raising them to a higher level with subtle twists added along the way.  Case in point - I ordered a bento box for lunch with teriyaki beef, white rice, seaweed salad and a mixed greens salad.  All of those things sound pretty dull, but they hit the ball out of the park.  The mixed greens salad had a chili/mint dressing that was incredible.  The beef was tender and prepared very well with a tasty sauce.  Would love to go back sometime and try some other things.  FYI, the drunken noodles w/ chicken was featured on Food Network - didn't try it this trip, but given the skills on display, I'd expect it to be excellent.",

But the service... we had to ask at least 2 times each time our water was empty before someone would finally come over and fill it up. Our forks were bent and everything was generally slow and the restaurant was not that full. I understand the place just opened, but it was a decently expensive lunch so I expect better service.

    "text": "Y'all.  This is Encore \"casual dining\" restaurant and it blows away every other casino's version of \"casual dining.\" The food, ambience, and service here was incredible!   I took a client out for dinner here (so unfortunately I didn't get any pics of the food) and was nervous because I thought Andrea's or Mizumi would be a better upscale choice for a client dinner.  They don't take reservations but luckily, we were able to get right in. We started with some moderately priced sake (The Wanderer Poet) that I highly recommend.   We had: Red Dragon roll Hamachi Thai Basil roll  Shu Mai Potstickers  Seafood fried rice The sizzling beef dish Drunken noodles  We were honestly impressed with just about everything. I will say - the rice and beef was a little under-salted, but hey, that's what soy is for, amirite?   In terms of keto-friendly options...I'd stick with the sashimi dishes and maybe the salads.  Long story short, this is a GREAT option at Encore. Even for \"casual dining,\" it's a little pricey, but the ambience and food are worth it. Skip the shi-shi-ness of Andrea's or Mizumi and come to Wazuzu instead.",

The drunken noodles were alright. There was spice to it and the flavors were there.   My boyfriend liked the fried rice with shrimp.  But for me, the flavors in the rice were lacking. We also ordered the duck, spare ribs and pork. The pork was dry....very dry.   For dessert, we got the chocolate brownie and chocolate ice cream. The rice krispies on top made it taste like a crunch bar. It was little portion but satisfied my dessert cravings.   Price was expensive.  $48 for drunken noodles....no thanks.  Wouldn't eat here again. Nice atmosphere though! The crystal dragon was neat, but food was not up to par.",

The flavor was so good it didn't even need any soy sauce! Try it!!  My husband and daughter ordered sushi and it both looked and tasted so very fresh! The service was great and the decor lovely!

The tuna hand roll was amazing, so fresh. My husband ordered the ramen soup with pork and said it was good. I ordered the drunken noodle with spice level at 3, (5 being the hottest) and it was incredible. Not sure why this place has three stars, but I feel like it does exceed the mediocre reviews.

Everything was very tasty, and fresh the dumplings were wrapped in a rice paper type exterior and were filled with a veggie mix and topped with Edamame the texture of the veggies and wrap were perfect, very light and tasty. The cucumber salad was very refreshing as well, and it wasn't over powered by vinegars or oils as oppose to other places, here you can really get the crunch and freshness of the cucumber taste. The brown rice was tasty and steamy as well! I love it here and would come back, however the only reason I'm not I giving 5 starts is due to their sauce. They paired my order with a store bought chili paste that is very generic in most Asian restaurants. Since this is kind of fine dining I expected them to make their own sauce to pair dishes with, but over all it's still a tasty restaurant.",

We were able to be seated quickly and got our order in ok but after the food was delivered we couldn't get our waiters attention for more water or a new chopstick (it had fallen on the ground).

The pork had a lot of fat in it and it seems it was seared with some sort of crust on it.  The noodles themselves were inspired to be al dente style and I could taste the heavy amount of egg that was used to make the noodle.  My wife had a specially roll and it looked like the just put way to much rice and too little tuna on it.  Overall for the price paid here I considered it overpriced.

Decor is beautiful and I was mesmerized by the crystal dragon that ran along the entire back wall.  Service is very good, food was delicious and typical of casino restaurants, pricing is steep.  We ordered the Pineapple Fried Rice, Cantonese Barbecue, Thai Beef Salad and Orange Flavored Beef.  All of the dishes were good and portion size was decent.  The pineapple fried rice came with large shrimp, sliced Chinese sausage and pineapple; very flavorful.  The Thai Beef salad was so good ... very spicy due to the peppers in it and my sister ordered a 3 on the 5 hot scale ... perfect!  The Orange Flavored Beef had good cuts of beef and was crispy, not greasy.  The Cantonese Barbecue had melt in your mouth roast pork, ribs and duck.  We asked for Hoisin sauce on the side to boost the flavor.  Dessert was a Korean shaved ice dish (pat bingsu) that was outstanding.  My sister, who is pretty finicky, declared this her favorite Asian restaurant in Vegas ... high compliments indeed.",

Sea bass was delicious and so were the drunken noodles. Our waiter Waymond was amazing!! So helpful and respectful. The atmosphere is more relaxed and causal. Great place to eat before a show or night out!",

We stopped by on our way to XS so we could meander over there after a few drinks.  The bar tenders are really attentive and will make drink recc,  mix up your drinks and even keep you entertained if you're sitting at the bar!   HOwever, if you're like me and youre not a fan of that dangly leg feeling, plenty of cushy couches to sit on too :)",

Even though I have dinner reservations, I still come here for a 4/5 pm snack. The orange chicken is amazing. Just sooooo yummy. He drunken noodles are prepared lovely. Everything is just great! The reason why it's not a 5 is because it is a bit pricey for what you are getting. I still pay it and I know it's Vegas, but it's still expensive.",

I'd go so far to say I've had better sushi from my favorite Jewish grocery in Atlanta. On my second attempt, the ramen bowl came out with super-stale ramen --like, out-of-the-box stale ramen. This is not the place to go if you've ever enjoyed flavorful Asian cuisine at another fine establishment in your own hometown.  Skip and go to Sinatra's.",

Since we were headed to Surrender following the meal, wanted to keep it light. I chose the eel/avocado (unagi) sushi roll for $12. When it came out it only had 6 pieces and a pile of ginger. I was so hungry and sad at the same time. Not even hangry. The other girl got the drunken noodles with shrimp ($24) and that came out pretty spicy so I couldn't eat any of that either. If we weren't in a rush I may have considered something more substantial such as Egg Noodle Soup with wonton or BBQ pork ($17). Expensive but nice ambience.",

We usually only eat at the Wynn restaurants on our annual visits but I particularly wanted to try the infamous drunken noodles and dine with the crystal dragon on my birthday.  We ordered the Drunken Noodles with chicken which was great and did not disappoint.  The noodles were fresh and the amount of chicken in the dish was generous.  However, my favourite dish was the Crispy Orange Beef...just delicious!   We also ordered Buddha's Feast which was a good vegetable medley in light garlic sauce.  The portion size was very good for all three dishes.  Overall, we really enjoyed our meal in this beautiful casual restaurant.  Service was fine and I loved dining beneath the stunning crystal dragon.  We will definitely return next year to Wazuzu during our annual stay at Wynn.",

    "text": "Steve Wynn did an amazing job with incorporating vegan dining options in almost if not all restaurants in the Wynn and Encore! Next time we will definitely be staying there as all the places we decided to dine at were in both otels/casinos! I would like to start off with the service, both the manager Fiona and our waiter Waymon were very friendly and accommodating. We originally came in a little before dinner but we were out of the dress attire which didn't stop us from returning. Guys were your sleeves on your shirts! Women, no bathing suits, it is not a pool party.  I don't want the fact that there is a dresscode derail anyone from going because the vibe is great! Its a low light setting with an open dining area which you are still able to have a nice private date night.  The food experience: We ordered off the vegan menu as we are vegan so all the! Everything we read sounded amazing so we narrowed it down to 2 appetizers, the edamame and vegan California rolls. Edamames were on point and the cali rolls were fresh and delicious. For our entrees we picked two to share, the Drunken Noodles with veggies (you have te option of veggie, chick', tofu) and sweet and sour chickn'. Both dishes were so delicious and fulfilling that we ate everything! At the end we were comped a dessert snce we left to change and came back! We had a vegan brownie with ice cream, not on the menu, so you will need to ask, but it was amazing. Overall, Wazuzu over exceeded expectations for vegan dining, it will definitely be a must eat everytime we are in vegas!",

Loved the decor which was classy and elegant, with my favorite being the huge Swarovski crystal dragon on the wall :)   Service was excellent, attentive and super super accommodating for food allergies for my mom. We ordered an item which had bread in it, the waiter said it had egg which my mom is allergic too, we said no problem just bring it. Instead the waiter had the chef make the bread without egg!!! My mom was so happy, now that is what you call service!  Now on the food! For appetizer we had the Roti Panang and jade dumplings which were amazing. The roti panang is probably some of the best I have had! Loved it!!! I still dream about it on some days....it was that good :) For entrees we had the drunken noodles, crispy tofu and chicken panang curry. Yes the panang curry was so good we ordered it again!!! All of the food was delicious including the cocktails. This was by far my favorite meal in Vegas.   If you're in Vegas and want Asian food or just a nice classy dinner out in Vegas that won't break the bank come here!! You won't regret it!! Mmmmmmm Panang.....",

We ordered it with a heat level of 3 and it was perfect! I have to say that I am officially addicted and must find a place back home where I can get it. There were 3 of us dining for lunch. We each ordered the Drunken Noodles. Two with beef and one with shrimp. Again, I was not disappointed. It hit the spot. No one in our party had eaten at Wazuzu so we didn't know what to expect. The Drunken Noodles could feed two people depending on how hungry they are. Also, the server gave us an option on the heat level ranging from 1 to 5. We all ordered a level 3. I can handle spicy food but this was just a little too spicy for my liking. It was still yummy and I ate it. I craved the panang and drunken noodles my whole trip! In fact, after laying by the pool for a few hours, I ordered some to take back to my room for lunch! I got smart and ordered the panang at a level 2.5-3 and the drunken noodles at 2. Both were perfect! Again, this was my first time trying either dish but I fell in love. I also liked the convenience of being on the property. However, the pricing is a bit on the expensive side. After coming to Vegas for several visits, I know that it is not cheap. I did expect to pay a little bit more as the Encore is one of the higher end hotels on the Strip. Don't expect to come here for a cheap and quick meal. I will say, I already plan to make this a must have during any future trips to Vegas.",

Since it's a fairly high end restaurant at the Encore hotel, we thought it would be reflected in the service. How wrong we were.  First off, we showed up with a group of 8 for our 8pm reservation, which they claim they didn't have. Fast forward 30 mins later, we finally get a table. No apologies, no explanations, just here's your table...   The menu is an eclectic mix of Asian cuisines. They have a mix of Japanese, Korean, Chinese, Thai and Vietnamese dishes.  Since we were a large group we ordered a variety of maki rolls and dim sum. The dim sum was good and so were the maki rolls. However, at $30 a pop, I didn't notice any difference from the $6.99 rolls I can get at any hole-in-the wall sushi bar.   For my entree, I ordered the mongolian beef, which was very well done in a nice spicy sauce. The portion was a bit too big for me.  The wine and cocktail list is decent with a good selection of red & whites as well as a selection of sakes from Junmai Daiginjo to Junmai.",

I had just came in from the airport and I was starving so I had checked in and headed to the room and then I saw the Wazuzu Thai restaurant and thought I would get a bite to eat. The room is very nice and the service was also exceptional. I had the drunken Noodles with chicken.  This noodle dish is one of my favorite and I try to eat every where I go, I just had to try here in Las Vegas.  The dish was good the noodle weren't over cooked and a had a fair amount of chicken.  But not great. Maybe because I'm in Vegas or maybe it was because I was at the Encore, but not as good as I thought it would be or as a lot of the Thai restaurant in Detroit.  If your in the Dearborn area then you must try Bangkok 96!  What a wonderful wonderful place.  The owner Genevieve and her family ( daughter ) have made this place one of the best Thai in the state.  A 5 out 5 stars.  Some time the best places are in your own back yard.",

Let me start by saying that if you come from a town that has real high end sushi places, you will find this place to be mediocre.  The environment is clean, nice and friendly.  The service was slow for us.  The food was OK, not great though. The quality of food did not justify the price.  We had 3 rolls, 1 soup and 1 salad, 1 beer and 1 cocktail and the bill was $110. I'm used to paying about half that for places just as nice in Los Angeles, or the same price for a much higher end sushi restaurant.   I know its in a casino resort, but I still expect a bit more.  I would have given it 3 stars but both my girlfriend and I got sick from the food.",

We were staying at the Encore,starving, and love any Asian food, so it seemed like a good choice considering their varied menu. We ordered a couple sushi rolls - they were tiny and terrible {Yellowtail scallion and some sort of Tuna- Crunch hybrid). We also ordered the Pineapple Fried Rice - this was not fresh. This was rice that was left over that they re-fried with leftover sausage, dried shrimp and pineapple. I did not taste any roast duck!! Not enough spices, not enough flavor, and so greasy. Gross greasy. And this dinner was so flippin' expensive! It was more than $100 - we both left there feeling used. The service was pretty bad and just added to the bad experience. Never again Wazuzu, never again.",

I braced myself for some overpriced Chinese food, since its location pretty much guarantees that.  What we ended up with: Tom Yum Goong Soup - pretty flavorful with a surprisingly decent amount of peppery heat behind it. Spicy Tuna roll - Bad.  Sad little roll that tasted oddly of bitterness and not much else.   That's what I get for ordering sushi in the desert, I guess. Drunken noodles - So so.  The portion was huge, but it wasn't particularly great. Egg noodle soup with wontons - Comfortingly bland.  The noodles weren't very good, but the wontons were nice and meaty.  Jazzed up with their house siracha, this was a good remedy for my hangover.  Service is polite, and the room is beautiful in that showy Vegas way.  The kitchen seemed really slow for lunch though, particularly for Chinese food- it took almost 30 minutes to get our food after we ordered, so I wouldn't come here for a quick bite.",

Uni (sea urchin) on the sashimi platter was very fresh: it was noticeably sweet and freshly briny, where urchin that's past its prime gets a dull flavor. Tom yum goong (hot & sour Thai lemongrass soup) with shrimp was excellent - I ordered it full-on Thai spicy, and it indeed arrived loaded with chili oil and thinly sliced green chili pepper. The heat and sourness was well balanced, the shrimp were perfectly cooked, and you could still taste all the ingredients despite the heat.  Drunken noodles with shrimp were very good, as well. Again, large shrimp perfectly cooked. Seasoned well, with just the right amount of chili heat. Sure, it probably shouldn't cost $20+ for noodles, but it's Las Vegas. And it's tasty, and filling. I normally don't leave food on the table, but I actually didn't finish about a quarter of the dish so the portion size was more than adequate.  Contrast Wazuzu with the Palazzo's Zine, and the choice is obvious.",

This time I ordered the filet mignon. I thought it was going to be the size of a single medallion, but I was completely wrong. It was a large dish worth sharing.

But, let's talk about the food: Yellowtail Serrano Roll: too small without enough fish; but it wasn't bad Hamachi Chili: really pricey, but super good! Cha Gio Imperial Crispy Rolls: Good flavor; Thai Chili Sauce on the side is too watered down. What I really wanted for a condiment wa some sriracha (you know, the rooster sauce!) Drunken Noodles with Shrimp: good portion size and good flavor. I love the thai peppers and jalapenos you'll see, and taste, throughout the dish! Sichuan Wok Beef: again, good portion and flavors. also love the peppers here.   The food is good, albeit pricey. Service is great. I'll return for more spicy goodness!",

Loved the crystal dragon and the red and gold hues. Here's what we ordered:  -papaya salad ($14): tart and fresh -panang curry with chicken, spiced 3 out of 5 (HOT) ($16): YUM! Spicy rate of 3 wasn't too hot. Very tasty and delish over the brown rice. -drunken noodles ($22): just like chow fun, but didn't seem as oily -brown rice ($5)  We ordered brown rice since we didn't think any rice would come with the curry, but when we were served the curry, they brought another bowl of rice so we had 2 sides or brown rice. The food was good, but I found portions to be small (except for the curry) and prices were high...but I guess that's standard for Vegas.",

    "text": "One of my girlfriends treated us out to dinner here at Wazuzu after our insane day pool party and VIP table next to DJ Afrojack at Encore Beach (Lil Jon was at our same table). We had the whole dinner comped - yay! We were all starving due to the entire day dancing. So, all six of us ordered one or two rolls, which cost about $30 each. This is pretty expensive for sushi that was wrapped in a lot of rice. I thought the vegan rolls were creative though. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great. I've had fresh sushi before in Asia and in the states like SF, Miami, and NYC, and Wazuzu is definitely not up to par. However, we were able to walk right in after a crazy day at the pool party (and after they made me put a tank top over my bikini - lol so lame).   The dessert on the other hand was DELICIOUS!!! This was my official birthday dessert moment in Vegas after four days of non-stop craziness! The chocolate cake literally melted in our mouths, the mango/lychee/coconut sorbet was so yummy, and the coconut crepe was devine. All three desserts made this three-star restaurant a four. Mmm.. sweets!",

I HAD TO GO TO URGENT CARE as a result. My trip got cut short because of this medical emergency.  What's worst is the Encore Hotel did not comp me and refused to waive the rest of the nights that I had previously booked.  I had to pay for the night I did not stay there because I went to urgent care.     What's more hypocritical and deceiving was, the front office and reporting reps said that hotel and restaurants are separate. Yet, when their claims reps called back, they said that they are part of same enterprise and the restaurant did not need to call back to apologize, and they were calling on their behalf.  It's truly sad that this type of enterprise acclaimed to be a 5 stars resort had treated their guests this way.   I see how they make SOOOOO much money....by overcharging and covering up each other to avoid reimbursing guests who rightfully deserve their money back.    On top of their poor quality services and products, their food was mediocre and overpriced.   I've traveled to LV and stayed at many 5-star hotels before, but never had I experienced such a life-endangering event from eating at Wazuzu; on top of that witnessing such deceiving cover-ups for their restaurant by the Encore Hotel.  For the life of me, I will never return to Wazuzu ever ever again, nor will I stay at the Encore Hotel even if they were to offer me vacation packages or perks.",

    "text": "More of a 3.5.  Came for dinner Saturday and was seated promptly with the place pretty busy but not fully packed. Initially intrigued by their menu and wanted a noodle soup fix, and this place seemed to fit the bill, especially as my sister is a vegetarian. Setting and decor was very nice, with a giant crystal like dragon on the wall.  We got the jade dumplings and vegan crunch roll to start. Didn't find the rice crackers on the roll to be too appealing, but it did give a nice crunch. Loved the noodle wrapper on the dumplings but it was quite bland, even though it was packed with mushrooms and veggies.  Got the tonkotsu ramen, as sis had the veggie ramen. The noodles itself were cooked perfectly with the right amount of chew to it, but it could have been eggier in flavor. My sis didn't care too much for them, as she thought they were doughy. My egg was perfectly soft boiled. I wasn't sure how I felt about the broth. It was milky in texture, but too light in taste. My pork was also dry and did not melt in my mouth like it should. The veggie ramen was odd. It was abundant in veggies, but was a mixture of American spring salad mix and Chinese veggies. Hers was not too flavorful either.  Service was all very good. It was nice that they consistently checked to see if my jasmine green tea pot was empty. All in all, I enjoyed that everything tasted fresh and their portions were very satisfactory. They also nailed it on the textures of their food. However, for flavor, everything was quite bland. I didn't expect super authenticity or anything, but everything tasted super flat and even some salt would have helped, but I guess I would prefer something that is bland and fresh over something that is overly salty and doused in MSG.",

The sushi was whatever and the sweet and sour chicken was just ok. The drink I got was the lychee mojito, which wasn't anything special in my opinion. I was actually annoyed at this place because I was wearing a sleeveless shirt and they made me go change.  It makes sense to have a shirt on, but the hostess saw me waiting for my friends to come so we get a table and waited for me to go up to her to tell me that, she could've told me that when she saw me waiting for my friends right in front of her.",

The flavors are explosive, fresh, exotic. Just as nice is the service - professional yet gracious and engaging.

Thai, Chinese, Korean, Japanese... maybe they should've focused on one or two types of cuisine at most and done a better job with those.  We started off with sushi and got the Crunchy Roll and Philadelphia Roll.  The Crunch Roll was not impressive at all for a $20 roll.  It was 6 pieces of your basic shrimp tempura, cucumber and avocado.  They made it unique by using japanese rice crackers as the crunch but they should've stuck with normal tempura crunchies because it just wasn't a crunchy roll.  They should call it something else.  The Philly Roll was average... a little too much philly cheese though.  After feeling \"eh\" about the sushi, we decided to try the Pineapple Fried Rice.  There was a lot of flavor going on with the chinese sausage and spices, it was like a party in my mouth.. not necessarily a good thing.  It did have juicy large shrimp though.  Service was on the slow side even though it was late at night.  They also brought out the wrong dish at first without any apology.  Overall, not what I was expecting from a restaurant at the Encore.",

    "text": "We've eaten at Wazuzu roughly a dozen times so I think this review will be very fair. We've been here so many times only because of convenience, and the variety they offer on their menu, not because it's great, delicious, can't wait to have more, etc.. nothing like that. Solely for convenience purposes. \"Wazuzu at Encore offers Pan-Asian flavors inspired by Chinese, Japanese, Indian, Singaporean and Thai cuisine.\" Especially convenient when one is craving say.. Chinese, and the other Thai or even Japanese.  Each time the food has been very consistent over the years, even down to plating and garnishing.  I couldn't say the same about the service. It always seemed barely there.. as though non of the servers really want to be there. It takes a while for them to drop off and top off the water, a while longer to take your order, and once the food is delivered, don't bother for any service, if you care for some, be prepared to wave someone down. They are quickest when it comes time for you to pay, each and every single time. That's suddenly when they appear, fake smile, and actually give you more water! (We normally just order a large bottle of Figi or Pellegrino along with our drinks so if and when we need water we just pour it ourselves.)  What we've ordered here: (most roughly a dozen times...we normally order the same stuff, and tack on something new to try each time)  Live Lobster $88 Ginger scallion, garlic crusted or Singapore curry (We normally alternate between the ginger scallion and the garlic crusted)  Sashimi Platter (Chefs Choice) $80  Cantonese Sea Bass $38 Choice of crispy panko crusted, steamed ginger scallion or traditional soy bean crusted (We typically opt for the healthier alternative...steamed with ginger & scallions. It's so simply and light, so can't go wrong if you plan to order many dishes)  Wok Tossed XO Filet Mignon $38 Asparagus, mushrooms  Baked Miso Black Cod $25 Sweet miso glaze, gai lan This dish was very pleasant. (Simple and light)  XO String Beans $18  Gai Lan $16 Steamed or wok tossed with garlic sauce  Baby Bok Choy $16 Steamed or wok tossed with garlic sauce  Choy Sum $16 Steamed or wok tossed with garlic sauce (We always order at least one of the four listed green vegetables listed right above. They seem to always run out so we end up having to opt for another on the list, but have gotten all of them at one point or another. Both steamed or wok tossed are simple and good, but for a more \"clean\" taste we go for steamed.)  -Combination Cantonese-Style Fried Rice $25  -Korean Galbi Short Ribs $25 Soy, sesame, brown sugar-marinated beef short ribs  Lobster Cut Roll $25  -Wazuzu Pineapple Fried Rice $23 Thai Jasmine rice, roast duck, Chinese sausage, shrimp, pineapple  -Pad Thai Kon Kaen $23 Rice stick noodles, tamarind, shrimp, eggs, bean sprouts, peanuts  -Beef Chow Fun $23 Chinese broccoli, bean sprouts, onions  -Thai Beef Salad $18 Lemongrass steak, seasonal greens, chili mint dressing  -Spider Cut Roll $16 (Softshell Crab)  -Sweet Shrimp Sushi $16 (2pcs.)  -Spicy Tuna Cut Roll $14  -Tom Yum Goong Soup $14 Hot, sour and spicy prawns, mushrooms  -Philadelphia Cut Roll $12  -Mochi Ice Cream Duo $12 Red bean, green tea  -Fiji (Large Bottle) $8.50  -San Pellegrino (Large Bottle) $8.50  -Blue Lychee Cooler $8 Muddled blueberries and exotic lemonade mix (non alcoholic)  -Jasmine Rice & Brown Rice $5 (each individual bowl)  -Thai Iced Tea $5  Fun Fact: \"Wazuzu's drunken noodles were featured on Food Network's \"Best Thing I Ever Ate\".",

This time I had the Seafood Fried Rice and it was \"broke the mouth\" awesomeness.  The hostess PIA was very welcoming and made me feel comfortable from the start.  Great service continued with Tara as the waitress, who was very quick and efficient.  She checked on me throughout my dining and had my tea always full.  John from Hawaii was awesome too, but will be returning to Hawaii.  This is a place not to be missed when you visit the Wynn/Encore Hotel & Casino.  Great service, great food....very, very fresh and great atmosphere.",

    "text": "Pretty disappointed from last nights experience at dinner. The service was kind of out of hand and all I kept hearing was excuses that it was St Patrick's Day. To me it seemed like a normal evening. Here we go.   I go to ask for a table she says it's about 20-25 min. Ok fine so I go play craps and burn some time. It felt more like 45 minutes but I could be wrong.   Anyways, I get a table and they took a chair away because it was just me. I mean leave the chair across from me so I feel decent, instead I was stuck in the back corner which is fine. I sit down and literally it took over 10 minutes just to get a water and be initially greeted. Not a good start.   So I get my water and in the meantime I speak with fellow patrons next to me. They had the same experience. Slow service and it seemed like excuses. The order wasn't right, the food wasn't right, they were sitting there with edamame.   My food came out fairly quick compared to my neighbors. I ordered the pork buns and I'm not sure if this is a thing but the paper was stuck to the bottom and I accidentally ate some of it and I had to peel it off each one. Then I got the Thai spicy basil beef dish.   Here is my frustration. I felt like I literally paid for a bowl of onions and fillers. There wasn't a lot of meat in there just a bunch of onions and peppers. I wasn't going to send it back because I was starving and I just ate it.   $40 with tip and yes I left a 20% tip despite the service (my neighbors left $0 which I felt bad for the server, a little bit) for 3 steamed buns and some onions with meat didn't really excite me. Again, let me repeat this is not about money, I blew $100 in craps before I came to eat and wrote this review the next day, it was about service and overall value of the food. Although the flavors were good in the dish, I'm at a 2.5 and no one gets bumped. Sorry guys, missed it on this one.   I have a similar review to Red 8 in the Wynn and it's the same theme and overall look, but now I'm just frustrated.   Oh and the manager came over to my neighbors table and was nice, but didn't comp anything, didn't offer a free dessert, didn't really solve their issue, didn't overly rectify the situation.",

    "text": "Looking for a great Chinese restaurant in Las Vegas I came across this place in an article, so we decided to try it and we had an extraordinary experience. I couldn't believe the 3 stars they have on Yelp. My party (+2) and I arrived, we didn't make a reservation and it was passed 9:30 pm. The place was packed but the lovely hostess told us we will have a table in 20 mins.  The restaurant:  This place is cute, contemporary Chinese looking. They have a glass dragon on the wall. Its impressive! The restaurant is red, white and black. It is not big. I think max capacity 156 people. Even though its considered casual dining, I still think is pretty enough for a date or business meeting. The menu features Chinese, Thai, and sushi. we were on the mood for Chinese.   The Food: We ordered \"Shu Mai, Shrimp\" as an appetizer, it was my first time having these delicious dumplings and I just fall in love! They tasted to good! You can dip them on soy sauce or a hot sauce they bring. YUM!!  We asked our waitress how big the Chinese plates were, and she said they were family style, so we decided to have \"Pineapple Fried Rice\" -I saw it when they brought it to another table and I said I wanted it! It was delicious! So flavorful! It has shrimps, sausage, duck breast and big chucks of pineapple... mmmm.  \"Filet mignon\" - great steak, nice and tender! Love it!  \"Drunken noodles\"- you can pick your level of spiciness in this from 1-5, we chose 3 considering I'm new into the whole spicy world. I think I can handle level 4 next time. These noodles are made with rice and were thicker. They were delicious!! Totally recommended!  \"Mongolian Beef\" -really good and it had a good kick to it!   While we waited for the food we had some drinks, I had a rum drink that was not that good. But for my second drink I had a \"Lychee Mojito\" -It was better, and great flavor!  We did really good with the food. It was just the right amount for the 3 of us. I passed on the dessert because my heart was on the \"Shu Mai\" I got one last order and they were just amazing!! I could eat those all day long!   The Service: The service was great! The hostess and our waitress gave us an excellent experience. The waitress changed our dishes and gave us new ones after we were done with the appetizers. She was considered enough to ask if we wanted something else before the kitchen close.   Overall, amazing experience! 4.5 Stars! I'll be coming back to this place!",

The service was great - they suggested the drunken noodles that were absolutely delicious! It wasn't too salty and had a great balance between the noodles and shrimp.   The Tom yum soup (level 3 spicy) is flavorful and has a good amount of spice. There were about 4 huge shrimps in the soup despite the bowl not being that large.   The sea bass was prepared great - the fish was soft and paired perfectly with the sauce. The flavors were not too overwhelming and tasted great with white rice.   Overall, a great lunch experience!",

But they did not ask whether we would like dessert but just gave us the check. I really want to try their dessert actually, so we just have to pay and left. Disappointed....",

I was by myself so I went for one dish, the Nasi Goreng, a spicy Malaysian rice dish of pork,  lap ceung and veg with a fried egg. Fried rice + fried egg = yum!   I am so glad my server talked me down from 4 to 3 in terms of heat level. 3 was the perfect amount of burn! So too often ethnic restaurants dumb-down the flavors and the spice level for their white guests. Not at Wazuzu. If you want it spicy go for it, but be forewarned.",

My friend is a pro poker player and gets take out from here delivered to the poker room next door and he's always talking about how it's \"ok.\"  I think it's more than ok.  And that isn't just because we had come hungry from a terrible dining experience at the Wynn that we walked out of.    The service is good.  The server might be a little to quick but at least he corrected himself whenever there was a discrepancy.    The sushi was good.  The rice was cooked perfectly and seasoned nicely.  The rolls had a great balance of fish to rice.    The miso cod was good.  It wasn't spectacular or anything to write home about but it definitely filled the spot.    I liked the Thai Basil chicken, even if I thought it may have had too much sauce.    The only things I didn't like were the steamed rice on the side and my guava margarita cocktail.  The rice seemed a little bit like it sat out for a long time.  The top layer was hard and dry.  Also, I didn't like my cocktail.  Like at all.  The guava margarita didn't taste of guava.  It basically tasted of well alcohol with ice.  This is a shame because my friend LOVED her mango martini.",

    "text": "The Jennifer and I went to Vegas last weekend. We had stayed at the Encore and decided to check this place out. I am a fan of \"fake\" Asian food so this was my cup of tea ...no pun intended. The decor was great, very nice and classy. It matches the people that stay at the hotel. We stayed at the hotel and got RSVP so there was no wait. The place was packed and every seat was taken. I recommend RSVP for dinner. For lunch, place was dead.   Food:  The food was very fake and very high in quality. Again to all the ASIANS reading this - NOT Authentic!! Don't complain about it. The quality was awesome.  We weren't entirely hungry but here is what we ordered:   Starters - Spicy Tuna Roll - small but good quality diced tuna, very red.  Main Plates:  Ginger Scallion Sea Bass - Very good, high quality fish that flakes right off.  Again, small portion Korean Ribs - This was awesome and smelled sooo good when they brought it out.  In fact, the server brought it to the table next to us and that was the reason why I ordered it.  It smelled that good.  The meat came right off the bone. Fried Rice:  I love Fried Rice, how could you go wrong.  Again, very tasty and this was actually a good size bowl. Sushi Nigiri:  Awesome, Fresh, and it melted in my mouth.  I recommend this place although the service was sub par at best even though they really tried.  It look like they really could have used one more server.  However that did not hinder our experience.    Prices:  This place is pricey, but all places in the Encore is.  Be prepared for mid 100s for a good meal. Everything in Encore is a rip.  Encore means \"after blowing all your money at Wynn, come to Encore for another wallet cleaning performance\".   From words of Fergie \"If you ain't go no money take your broke ass home\"  well at least away from Encore and Wynn...",

Food was excellent - we had the shrimp shu mai, pork pot stickers and drunken noodles - the star of the show. Everything was delicious.  We ate here three times during our stay in Las Vegas and loved it more each time.  Highly recommended.",

IT WAS YUMMERS. my friend ordered the sweet and sour chicken and that was yummers as well. the food came out in a pineapple! we thought the drunken noodles alone wasn't going to be enough to fill us up but there was more than enough food. i would give this place 5 stars if it wasn't so expensive. =/",

Rolls and pieces are more than double the price of sushi in socal, and no better than your typical hole in the wall spot in oc or la. Moreover, this place doesn't really have an identity-- serves sushi, chinese food, japenese food-- and there isn't even a sushi bar, which is weird. Overall I found it to be the kind of meal where you wish after you'd just gone to Subway or something, because it would have been just about as good and alot cheaper and faster. Go next door to La Cave at Wynn and have a great meal for less money.",

    "text": "My goodness, this place is so pricey. I came here with my dad because the line for the buffet at Caesar's Palace was filled and the first available table was going to take 3 hours. We decided to come here because it was the closest restaurant to us walking distance.   We ordered sweet and sour chicken, pad thai, shrimp fried rice, and the cantonese assorted barbecue plate. My dad also got a glass of wine. Our total bill came out to be around $150. I mean, I understand that this is supposed to be high quality dining, but the food certainly didn't make up for the price.  We were greeted by a hostess, but it took us a few minutes to get seated and it wasn't too busy when we came. Our server was nice and professional, but we waited about 10 minutes after we were seated to order. The only thing that truly lived up to my expectations was the pad thai. It was absolutely delicious, and it had just the right amount of seasoning and veggies. Good noodle portion too. The rest..... Not much flavor, portion size was awkward and off, and the food just didn't suit my taste.   Not to mention that I find their menu ridiculous. They have a mixture of japanese food, dim sum, chinese food, and then galbi?? (which is korean) I found it really awkward that there was a sushi section in the menu. I would imagine the quality of the fish wouldn't be too good since sushi isn't their only focus.   Trust me, I hate giving bad reviews because I worked as a server before and I know the bad experiences we would get from customers. I really feel like this place is just too pricey for the quality of food that they serve.",

We're Food Network fans and wanted to see how Jet Tila's restaurant would be live up to expectations. Located in the Wynn, at the end of The Strip, it was quite a walk for us [from the Linq] but it was a beautiful evening in Vegas. They don't take reservations but we waited only about 30 minutes. The dining room is very nice looking -the crystal dragon is gorgeous- though it opens directly into the casino and cigarette smoke wafted in - being from Oregon, none of us could get used to this. All of the service staff was wonderful: pleasant and mindful. Food choices were very tough. After much deliberation we settled on a dim sum appetizer, the Panang Curry, Nasi Goreng, and the Drunken Noodles. I wanted Ramen so bad but figured it to be tough to share. I recommend the Blue Lychee Cooler for a drink.",

Like everything else in Vegas it's not inexpensive but the food here is worth what you pay. Definitely a five star experience!",

    "text": "This review is only for their drunken noodles. My friends were staying at the Wynn and heard several people rave about the drunken noodles at Wazuzu, which was located in the adjacent Encore hotel. I love drunken noodles, so I was on board with trying it out for lunch. First off, walking from the Wynn to the Encore hotel was no easy feat. It was so far! So, after walking for what felt like at least 20 minutes, we made it here. I love the ambience - upscale, with red as their theme color everywhere. Our waiter was attentive and would check up on us often. After eating some edamame appetizers, our entire group ordered the drunken noodles at varying levels of spice and with different meat choices (chicken, pork, or shrimp). The presentation of the noodles was beautiful, but the taste wasn't as spectacular as others have mentioned it to be. Personally, for me, there wasn't enough of the Thai basil and the \"wok hey\" flavor that I love so much when I usually eat drunken noodles. \"Wok hey\" in Chinese means the flavor that the wok imparts to the dish when stir frying. Although, I have to say the texture of the noodles and the overall flavor of the dish were pretty good. Unfortunately, If I'm going to be paying more than $20 for a noodle dish, which to me was already ridiculously priced, the dish better be out of this world good. But, sadly it wasn't. Despite it being a visually appealing restaurant, I won't be back because the famous drunken noodles dish was just mediocre and expensive for what it was. The rest of the menu was expensive as well.",

My favorite dish is the ramen. The broth is so good, and the noodles are cooked to perfection. The sushi rolls are also delicious. We also loved the drunken noodles, but I felt like the portion was just a bit smaller than we thought it would be. Again, it just seemed like the price was too high for what we had.   There's a giant dragon made of like 10,000 Swarovski crystals on the wall, which really adds to the ambiance. Every place at the Wynn has many options for vegans and vegetarians, and Wazuzu is no exception.",

I ordered lobster miso soup to start since I was really hungry and I was still looking at the menu as for the main entree. Sea bass fought my attention so I asked if they could pan sear it for me because I don't like breading, she said that they could only steam it she was willing to go and check with the kitchen if they could pan sear it for me, but I didn't want to order it that way since it would not be something they specialize at. She had no other suggestions so I kept looking at the menu and there were a few different items that looked interesting but I had a few questions about the way they're prepared and I tried to stop Lorena a few different times, but I was ignored. 10 mins later (without me asking) she said \" I'll be right back with you to answer your questions\" (so clearly she heard me trying to stop her). I was done with my appetizer for about 10 mins and still haven't ordered entree.... I was quite upset at this moment and when my server finally arrived to \"answer my questions\" I kinda wanted already to leave and I mentioned to her that I waited for her for about 20 mins for her to come back, there was no response to that comment of mine. So I decided to just order dumplings and leave as my mood was already ruined. Food is decent, service is below average",

We started at the casino-free mandarin oriental and it was well worth going to Wynn to eat at all their restaurants. Wynn is so vegan friendly. It makes my transition to this way of eating effortless although we eat far more simple food at home.   Anyway the 3 sushi rolls were great, especially the mushroom based roll. The sweet and sour chicken made with gardein brand vegan chicken was very tasty and full of fresh peppers and light on the sauce. The edamame was of course easy to order. The drunken chicken was amazing! With a nice but not crazy helping of wide rice chow fun type noodles with onions and scallions and leeks yum!!  The vegan chicken potstickers were nice but a bit plain. Ask for vegan eel sauce and mustard on the side to slice it up and you'll love it. Maybe they could pan fry them even but we just got steamed.   For dessert they had an indulgent vegan brownie and chocolate ice cream sundae. Very realistic and sumptuous for two. Highly recommend this place. We also ate at allegro which had. Ice Classic Italian fare prepared vegan style with s nice room and excellent service.",

    "text": "I am giving one star not because the food was bad but because the service was hopeless. My waiter Mario took the order and then disappeared, never came to my table to ask me how I was doing. Someone else brought the food; I was drinking hot tea and wanted a glass of water but never got one. By the time I saw him again I was done with my food and my table was cleared by the bus boy. Mario was not the friendliest waiter I have seen in my life, to put it diplomatically. He did show up eventually to process my check. My question to the Wynn management is this, \"how come the waiters at Wazuzu are almost all Chinese (or Asian)\"? Why not employ other ethnic groups; Asians are notoriously bad waiters with a poor sense of humor, this place was not an exception. There were other ethnic groups working at Wazuzu but they were mostly bus boys or girls. The food was not bad at all, I had the Miso Soup which was outstanding and the noodles I had were also good. I just wish they could marry the good food with great service, cordial mixed with laughter. By the way, I love the Wynn, this one experience was unfortunate. I hope the management gets to read this and act upon it.",

I stay at the Wynn at least twice a month, and can't believe I never made the small trek to the Encore and eat here until recently.  I used to think Red 8 was the closest I'd get to Southeast Asian cuisine, other than the numerous Thai places around the city. How wrong I was....  Wazuzu is amazing. I can't even comment on a single dish without mentioning 20, which honestly wouldn't help anyone reading this review. However, I did once meet Chef Jet Tila a few years ago, who opened this restaurant many years ago, and who was reputed for having the best drunken noodles ever. I have to admit, it's definitely one of the top two I've had in my lifetime travels around the world. So, as far as I'm concerned, that is one my \"must try\" recommendations.... but really, there are soooo many good dishes to choose from.  As a part Indonesian, I can also point to their nasi goreng. It's definitely one of the better ones I've had on the west coast (a good 8, if the street vendors back home are considered a 10).  Honestly my go to place for Asian cuisine on every Vegas trip.",

    "text": "If you look at theTom Yum Soup picture, it was mostly a broth didn't have anything else in it, maybe a couple mushrooms, the few jalapenos you see and cilantro(?) maybe; that was it. AND THIS PICTURE IS BEFORE I even took one sip, nada (the level is even low on the broth, the chili spice is around  the edges from walking it to my table). If it's supposed to have more than that, because 75% to 80% was broth, I don't know.  I see in the other pictures a lot more filling in their soup for the price of almost $15, I was not impressed with the broth... Because honestly, it was just that, broth.  For my meal, or my entree, I ended up getting the Drunken Noodles with Chicken. It was \"good,\"  I did ask for it to be spicy which I thought would be you like a 3 but there was no spice kick to it. So, if you  like it on the spicier side, I would go full tilt on the 5. I was not at all impressed with any kind of spiciness in it,  I thought a 3 should have had some kick to it. I was so wrong, it was kind of bland to me, there was nothing, not even, \"Oh...that was a spicy spot.\" To me it was noodles with chicken, I know that's their claim to fame, and I know Giada went here and had these Noodles, the same thing and said it was the best is she's ever eaten...but if so, I am disappointed in her culinary adventures.  It was noodles and chicken with a bland brown sauce. Maybe she had a spicier or they put extra flavor in there for her, when she went because they knew it was her; I don't know. I don't know why everyone else is  impressed in the comments either.  Maybe next time I go I will try a different dish or this one at Level 5, because 3 apparently means bland.  This gets 3 star because it was just \"Okay\" to me, I don't think I could give it 4 stars because it wasn't something exceptional or something that I couldn't get at another place. The soup was broth and the noodles were just chicken, noodles and brown sauce. To me, nothing to write home about.",

    "text": "Wazuzu!  Where normal people go for a nice dinner in their nice clothes, but I go to order take-out and run back upstairs to my room in the Encore Tower Suites.  The interior is very trendy and sexy- super Las Vegas and perfect for date night.  I've seen people standing around, waiting for a table so if you're bringing a date here, please remember to make reservations so that your girl doesn't need to stand around in high heels.  Wazuzu offers an extensive take-out menu of a variety of Asian food- Chinese pan fried noodles, Thai curry, sushi, etc.  Basically anything remotely Asian.  To place a take-out order, you have to do it via telephone.  Super old-school if you ask me.  Where's the app?  I ended up spending a pretty penny here during my last visit to Las Vegas.  $20 uni sushi?  I'll have 2 orders, best enjoyed in a plush bathrobe on the 60th floor.  It's almost a tradition for me to order food from here because it's healthy, convenient, and better than room service.  Now here's the most important question- how do I get hotel concierge to deliver Wazuzu as room service?",

I got right in and my server was friendly and informative about the menu. After asking a couple of questions I ordered the Nasi Goreng (Spicy Malaysian fried rice, shrimp, barbecued pork, Chinese sausage, sambal oelek, fried shallots, topped with a fried egg). I asked for the spice level to be a 1-2.  This was a large portion and delicious! It had just the right amount of heat and I loved the flavor, the fried egg, and all of the different proteins in the rice.  Really good lunch! I'd absolutely return and they serve a lot of different dim sum dumplings all day. I love that!",

    "text": "Good drunken noodles and it's one of the very few places on the strip where you can get decent Asian food within tolerable price range.    After only having several super high-calorie unctuous meals in Vegas, I had to have Asian food.  I was walking all over the strip and near the Venetian hotel, there were Tao and Wazuzu... of course, I picked Wazuzu after reading the reviews.  Wazuzu is located inside the Wynn and it is perhaps most famous for its beautiful crystal dragon and being featured on Best Thing I Ever Ate, its Drunken noodle.    The restaurant itself was pretty small and intimate.  I dined by myself and did not feel awkward eating alone.  The menu offers Chinese, Japanese and Thai.  I looked around and saw people eating ramen, sushi, dim sum, etc.  They all looked pretty good.    I picked the Drunken noodle because I guess I was really curious to know how good it could be.  My food was served promptly and sizzling hot.  My honest opinion after taking a bite was that it was probably NOT the best Drunken noodle that I ever had.  I lived in the East Coast for almost two decades and I had definitely had drunken noodles better than this several times.  It is well-made drunken noodles with the right amount of oil and flavor and the noodles were also cooked very well.  Even if it was not the best drunken noodle I had in my life, I didn't have any problem with it.  I still really liked Wazuzu.  I loved its cozy atmosphere and friendly service, and the food was delicious and it was priced reasonably considering how crazy expensive other Asian places on the strip are.  If I were back in Vegas and craved Asian food, I would definitely come back to Wazuzu and try out other menu items.",

The place offers sushi/sashimi and rolls with other Asian dishes like Pad Thai and Drunken Noodles and Miso soup. It was hard to choose, but choose I did. I ordered miso soup and a Rainbow roll. Our meals came to the table but instead of having my miso soup as a appetizer they served it with everyone's main meal choices. I found this odd and expected the Rainbow Roll to come out shortly. Time kept passing and passing and no roll appeared. By the time Narrie came by, the table had finished their dishes as well As I had finished my soup. I the inquired about the missing Rainbow roll. She apologized and confirmed she had ordered it, and said she would check on it. It was at this point I said just cancel it as my table is done.  Shortly later about 3 minutes later the manager came by with the roll apologizing for the confusion and stated it would be taken off my bill. Even though it was disappointing to hold up my friends further I decided to taste it. I was very glad I did. It was well balanced and the rice was sweet and sticky and cooked to perfection. The crab was grated which made it less dense when eating while also rich in flavor. I left with my party on a good note knowing the restaurant offered to assuage my miffed state, the roll was one of the best I've had... not to forget the elevated miso soup. It was well balanced and with whole mushrooms not slices. Everyone enjoyed the meal even though it had an ooopps in the timing of serving... the restaurant took care of the mistake and the service and food spoke for itself.",

No prizes for guessing.. I ordered dumplings. Jade dumplings came highly recommended and I must say - it. Was. Great!! I just got greedier and ordered drunken noodles. Obviously, this was a lot for one person, but I enjoyed every bite of it. Food was great, no complaints.   I loved the service too, no rush or hurry. They charged the check to my room. Patiently showed me the vegetarian menu and talked through their popular options. I wanted to try their sushi as well, but for another day. Back in the Bay now and yelping for more dumplings .....",

    "text": "Maybe it's because I live in Arlington VA and the Asian food in the area is just so good that very little lives up to it? I'm not sure I just wasn't blown away with the food, especially for the price point.   We were staying in the hotel and going to see Le Reve, also in the hotel, and decided to stop in for a bite before the show. We ordered the pot stickers, hamachi crudo, spicy california roll, thai basil stir fry and the pineapple pork fried rice. Honestly, the pot stickers were not good at all... I have had better frozen from Trader Joe's. The hamachi crudo was our favorite by far because the yuzu flavor was really fresh and nice.   The thai basil stir fry was light as there were no carbs and had some nice flavor but maybe a little too saucy. Finally, we were really excited for the pineapple fried rice but it just fell a little short. It was dry, the sausage was a lil weird and I wasn't living for the curry flavor.   The drinks were really good though! For the price I think that Mizumi in the Wynn is a better bet... but for the record I did hear that the Ramen is awesome so if you're sitting in the restaurant reading this... try the ramen?",

Both are insanely good. The honey walnut shrimp has strawberries with a sweet glaze and pan fried walnuts. The shrimps are huge and crispy. The Mongolian beef was so tender and the veggies and gravy it's paired with was spectacular. Every bite was \"mmm!\" I highly recommend this place!",

    "text": "We don't usually eat this fancy, but my mom and I had been wanting to try some of the famous vegan food selections inside of the Wynn. My husband and son joined us since there were non-veg selections as well.  We decided on Wazuzu because we became entranced, or rather I became entranced, by the huge golden pears lining the entrance and gigantic crystal dragon on the wall. We later learned from our server that this dragon is worth about 1.5 million dollars.   As for food, my husband practically vacuumed down a BBQ Meat Plate, shu mai, and the roti prata. I also had some of the roti prata but the curry was a little spicier than I'm accustomed to. It was really delicious though - lots of flavor. And the curry they serve with it had the normal potato + veggy accouterments curries usually have - it wasn't just the sauce.   My mom and I split the spinach and mushroom dumplings, veggy drunk noodles, and the two kinds of vegan sushi rolls they had available. Even though I've had better vegan sushi at Chef Kenny's, this was good in a whole-food type of way. And the presentation was beautiful. The spinach and mushroom dumplings were my favorite. Chewy, sticky, and full of flavor.  I also really appreciated how well we were serviced here. Everyone was nice, very responsive, and didn't seem phased at all by our infant. Granted he doesn't have a horrible temperament, but he did get a little fussy; I know that bothers some diners. Overall, it was a wonderful experience.",

We checked out the restaurant Friday afternoon and there were maybe 3 couples there which was expected from reading the reviews.  We decided to go there Saturday evening.  It was packed.  We waited maybe 10 minutes for our table.    We had the Sashimi Platter, Roti Panang, Crispy Fish with Thai Herbs, and Thai Spicy Basil Stir-Fry (all recommended by Chef Jet).  We ordered all but the sashimi with a spicy level of 5.  I must admit... our meal was delicious!  So it was pricey... big deal... we were in Vegas!  Btw, my boyfriend is Thai and if he approves, well... this restaurant is worth returning to.  The decor was nice.  Loved the \"crystal\" dragon and the \"metal\" dragons surrounded by roses.  Service overall was great.  We didn't have to wait long for our dishes to come out.  Chef Jet came out and chatted with us.  Even took a picture with him.  Bottom line... We're definitely going back!",

They wanted us to pay another $5 for more rice, which is ridiculous--they should at least give enough rice to match the entree you buy, if they don't want to refill a side-dish, then at least make the initial helping not the meagre amount they gave out.  Additionally, the pot stickers were likely pre-made, nuked in a microwave and then lightly fried in a pan.  Really not good pot stickers.   You will have better asian food at Panda Express, sorry.

I came here with my girls and we weren't that hungry going in, but knew we had to eat something before the night so some of us ordered rolls and rice bowls.    pineapple fried rice- this was probably the best pineapple fried rice i have ever had (sorry mom!) it had Chinese sausage, shrimps, and duck meat in it.  3 things that i love!  It had the perfect hint of garlic and sweet and tartness from the pineapple.  My friend ordered this and I wanted to finish her bowl for her.  YUMMZA~  me and my friend ordered brown rice bowls which i loved.  I love eating brown rice and after eating so much junk food in vegas this was perfect!  i had mine with crispy tofu and hers was salmon.  Both were delicious! The tofu was fried perfectly without being oily and it was layered with onions, carrots, and bell peppers, all topped with toasted seasame seeds and a sauce that reminds me of eel sauce when you order cut rolls!  I really wanted to try the drunken noodles...  I was torn between that and the rice bowl, but i figured brown rice was healthier.  next time i'm back, Im def getting the drunken noodles!  i just saw that it was Giada's \"best thing i ever ate\"  ;-)  q u i c k   t i p   If you get the chance, say hi to the owner/chef Jet.  he's super friendly and really an awesome guy!  w h a t   i   d i g   huge crystal dragon on the wall.. its so perrrrtyyyyyyy!",

As for the food, it was \"MEH.\" For $500, we ordered about 5 dishes. Typical plate is about $30-$40 or so. Alcohol adds on another $30-$50/person, so it's safe to assume that it's $100 a person.  Food wasn't anything special. It was like going to any other Chinese restaurant in California. I would rather have paid an extra $50 to go to Botero. Don't get me wrong - the food is still pretty delicious, but being Chinese, it was truly nothing special.",

They treat you with courtesy and respect.  The food was really good.  In particular, I like their yellowtail scallion rolls, their dumplings.  They even have this, crazy, \"High Roller\" roll that costs $100...which I did NOT get but it was interesting.  The other thing about this place is that the servers come in and check just at the right time to change chopsticks or silverware, which is key.  The price is not bad considering it's in Encore.  Terrific place!",

Like the Encore and its sister Wynn this place is a treat for the eyes, with its decor awash in bright red hues and gold, and the striking crystal dragon on the back wall.  Our server was extremely poised and made good recommendations.    The food was pretty good.  I had the drunken noodles with chicken--the sweet soy sauce balanced the heat of the chiles well (while it's noted as \"spicy\" on the menu, you can select just how much).  My dining companion had the Thai spicy basil stir fry, which was good though we agreed the noodles won out.  Regardless, both dishes were of generous portions and were good value for the money.",

I ordered the panang curry with a side of rice and it was honestly the best panang curry  I had ever had. It wasn't too flaky or grainy, it wasn't runny, and it was a nice deep yellow color. For me the flavors were all there. I'm sure that anyone who likes really authentic Panang curry, as my cousin does, wouldn't enjoy it as much but I really liked it and still crave it sometimes.   The rice it came with wasn't too sticky or fluffy either, which is always a fear when you get East Asian rice. The prices here are about in line with Osha in SF and you get pretty much the same amount of food. In fact, the second night we were in Vegas I had the leftover panang curry and went downstairs to get some rice to-go from Wazuzu and had that for dinner. Luckily, the rice was just the right temperature that the fact that the curry had been sitting in the fridge all day didn't matter.  I would definitely tell everyone staying at the Encore to check out Wazuzu at least once.",

I haven't had a drink like that - like - ever, and it was fantastic. For an app, we started with the pot stickers. They were a little bland, to be honest, and I wasn't a big fan of them. I was sort of hungover, so I got a very simple chicken teriyaki bowl with brown rice.   The chicken was bland, but the rice was decent. The sauce really didn't have much flavor to it. I don't know, sort of sub-par for food, especially in a place like Encore.  It was good enough to go back to for a lunch, but I wouldn't make this a regular destination, there are so many better places to eat in Vegas. Like--- just next door at Okada, for example.",

So we ordered the panang thai curry, spicy tuna roll, imperial rolls, wonton soup, and duck noodle soup. The sushi, duck noodle soup, spicy tuna roll were all really yummy. The wonton soup, eh, I make better! And the imperial rolls were crap. Don't get it. Service was alright, our waitress Yoko was lurking around the table waiting for us to order, seriously Yoko, calm down. Anyways, it was a pleasant experience in all.

    "text": "Whenever I travel to a small town, say in Europe or the US, and I see that one lone 80s-style Asian take-out restaurant that offers \"Chinese / Thai / Korean / Japanese\" food, I always crack up.  Think of how much more they can charge for their food if they could update their sign to say \"Asian fusion\", put in some trendy furniture, and dim lighting?  Well, those smarty-pants at Wazuzu have done just that.  You can find everything but the kitchen sink on their menu - from sushi rolls (Japanese), to wonton soup (Chinese), to Pad Thai (Thai) and hey, even kim chi (Korean)!  So really, they should bill themselves as a \"Chinese / Thai / Korean / Japanese\" restaurant after all!  But then they wouldn't be able to charge the prices they do.  When you are a Jack of All Trades, you cannot expect to be an expert in anything.  This shows in the food at Wazuzu.  The teriyaki bowls are deconstructed plain stirfried overcooked beef or chicken slices - you have to pour your own teriyaki sauce over it.  Hmm....  This is accompanied by over-steamed green veggies on the side, dry rice in the middle, and plain stirfried peppers.  OK, this looks like an amateurish arrangement of buffet food.    Prices lean more towards the upper teens for entrees, and they charge $13 for JUST the wontons in soup.  Over at Red 8 bistro, you get a whole bowl of wontons AND noodles for the same price.  Hmm.... guess where I'm going back to next?  Wait staff is unfriendly and don't even try calling them directly for reservations.  They don't pick up their phones even though there are often 2-3 waiters standing around with nothing to do.  Yes, that's correct, this is a pretty empty restaurant even at dinner time.  I guess people are voting with their feet....",

The place is cute enough, but somewhat noisy since it's open to the Encore casino.   I wasn't that hungry, so I ordered the Chinese Chicken Salad ($16) and a pot of green tea ($8!). The server turned to me and said, \"Is that all you're getting?\" Which struck me as bizarre at best and rude at worst. As if my paltry $25 order of a salad and tea wasn't worth her time? I asked, \"Why, is the salad small?\" and she replied that it was. So, I opted to order the pot stickers as well.  My friend ordered three hand rolls and a Diet Coke.  So for all that we ordered it came out to $80 with tip. Worth it? Hardly. My salad was, surprisingly, not that small but decent sized. Was it good... eh, certainly not bad, but nothing that exciting. The pot stickers were equally middling: you only get four (anywhere else on the planet and you get six) and decent, but not great.   Best thing about this place was that it was halfway from my show at the Wynn and my hotel room at the Encore. Otherwise, pretty much a ripoff for what we got.",

    "text": "This place was a huge letdown in addition to being overpriced.    We went here while starving for lunch and read the menu outside the restaurant which sounded great- nothing uniquely special, typical thai-japanese dishes but we looked forward to ordering dishes that we were already familiar with.  Put in our names, hostess said it wouldn't take more than 15-25minutes max.  She took our cell phone number and said they would call when it was ready.  We checked back 30 minutes later after no call, still no table.  Another 20 minutes later and now even more starving, they finally seated us- they had never even called us to tell us our table was ready.  Not sure if they may have written the number down wrong.  So after the 50 minute wait to be seated we already knew what we wanted. Salmon skin rolls, pad thai, mongolian beef, bok choy, miso soup, and a thai crepe dessert.  The salmon skin rolls were fishy and not up to par of what my friends were used to at other japanese restaurants.  Even though they were starving they didn't even want to finish the rolls.  The pad thai was AWFUL! The only good thing about it was the giant shrimp that came with it.  Couldn't pinpoint what exactly made it so bad but that was another dish that went unfinished.  Bok choy was good but how badly could a nice restaurant like this one mess up a stir fry vegetable dish?  Mongolian beef was the only main dish that was good.    After trying all the main dishes we cancelled the crepe dessert in fear of getting served another plate that was another disaster version of a favorite dish!  The only upside was the service and the thai iced tea.  Such a disappointment for a restaurant that should have been a high quality meal in one of vegas's nicest new casino additions. Hoping we came on an off day, the server said that sometimes the dishes vary depending on the chef.  Unfortunately I don't intend on going back to find out if that's True.",

    "text": "We stuck to the Japanese side of the menu since we felt like a little sushi.    Seaweed salad: tasted so similar to the seaweed salad at our local favorite sushi joint, just a little more lemony Hamachi Chili:  wouldn't recommend this, the Hamachi was good and fresh and the plate looked beautiful but there wasn't much flavor or heat and it was just like eating sashimi which is fine but this was suppose to be a special plate and was overpriced for the result we got.   The rest of our meal consisted of a spicy tuna roll, avocado salmon roll, and hamachi roll.  All delicious standard rolls and just what we wanted.  Not terribly overpriced and absolutely excellent quality and freshness.  All in all we were quite satisfied with our meal and went off happy.  I will comment on the decor also, just like the rest of the hotel every detail has obviously been planned out, the dragon is amazing and I loved the chopstick holders on the table...more sushi places should have those.",

It's cool that they ask you how spicy from 1 to 5 so you know what to expect (of course I had to prove myself and request a 4 - didn't have the guts for 5).

    "text": "So we decided for our 9th anniversary we would have dinner at Wazuzu and splurge a little.  We love Encore and Wynn hotels, they are our favorite in Vegas and wanted to have dinner in one of them.  Wow, really wish I hadnt.  First, since I tend to ramble, let me put it out there clearly upfront.  I woke up at 5am the next day with one of the worst food poisionings Ive had ever.  No joke!  The only other thing I had to eat that day besides wazuzu was a sandwich and that didnt make me sick.    Back to the beginning - after reading the reviews I decided to try the drunken noodles.  Hubby got beef chow fun.  We also got some potstickers.  Well - if you love potstickers like I do...dont get these.  Im almost positive from the taste of them, thats what made me sick.  Plus my husband didnt eat what I ate at dinner and he wasnt sick - and we shared the sandwich at lunch which is why im positive it wasnt lunch either.  Anyhow, he said his chow fun was ok.  Mine was just not good all around.  For $70 bucks down the drain it was really just horrible.  Waking up as sick as I did the next day - and being in fear of throwing up on my flight home, made this experience i wont forget, or forgive.  Never going here again.  Just the thought of it is turning my stomach.",

We tried the Mongolian beef, drunken noodles, some sort of spicy chicken stir fry, and a few sides. The food was all very fresh and tasty. The sauces were perfect. Not too salty or sweet. The ambiance was perfect for the night. Beautiful decor...especially the crystal dragon. The service was great. Very attentive staff. The only down side was the long wait. We were told 20 min but ended up waiting 45. Other than that, it was a very pleasant experience.",

The waiter and my friend both said the dessert used to have a lot more ice on the bottom but is smaller now.  It was still one of the best desserts I have ever tried, but it did need more shaved ice.  We also had a Thai crepe that was to die for.  The wait staff was also excellent.

    "text": "What should have been an hour dinner took two and a half hours. We did a whole lotta waiting.   Not that I didn't want to spend some quality time with my lovely companion (who works in the casino, and yes they knew this ahead of time which makes this all the more ludicrous), but the insane wait time and overall awkwardness was just too much to bear and made this experience excruciating.   We show up, and there is a 20 minute wait time. That's fine, it's a small restaurant. But as we later learned, the wait time probably could have been cut down drastically if they had decent service. Since they don't have a bar, we ran over to Society where my favorite waiter recognized us, and even though we weren't eating there sent us over some pretzels and vegan butter. A+ service there. We hoped Wazuzu would be on par since they are only 2 doors down from each other, but they were not.  We get seated, and we placed our drink order. 10 minutes pass. Jasmine tea (lovely, very fragrant) comes out and then we order our food. First problem is the vegan part of the menu - it says vegan/vegetarian menu. Some of the names of the vegan items said vegan right in the title, but a lot did not and you had to go by the ingredients to see if it was not vegan. I wish they would have split it up differently or had some sort of marking to make ordering easier. My friend ended up ordering a vegan crunch roll, and I asked for the jade dumplings and a vegan drunken noodle dish with Gardein chicken. We expected a wait time for the food, but I was getting restless already. Food came out all at once and it was lovely.  The jade dumplings are in fact a bright shade of green, and quite delicious - I loved how it was served. The crunch roll was served just like a regular sushi roll, and even though I do not have an affinity for cucumber and avocado, it was decent; the mango sauce really made it for me, however. The drunken noodles were delicious, with just the right amount of spice. I really couldn't complain with my meal.   The one thing restaurants do that annoy me unlike no other- especially ones that have more of an upscale element - is if they aren't good at refilling water. The cups at Wazuzu are TINY so you would think they would be generously refilled at any occasion. Not so much. I had to ask for a refill, and it still took a couple minutes to come around; and when there is spicy food involved, Adina needs water NOW. We saw our waitress standing around - a lot. So much that it was very obvious. I was blown away with the lack of customer service - she did not come to ask us how we were doing once, and was very quiet.   Plates are picked up as my friend goes off to the bathroom, and she asks if I need a box for my meal. That's it. Another 6 minutes or so passes, I get my box, and only then does she ask if we would like dessert. We were going to order immediately, but she disappeared AGAIN to get menus, dropped them off and ran off again. Son of a...  We order dessert which also takes a while, which is strange since it's pretty much pre-made. We got the vegan brownie sundae, which the ice cream looked like it had a giant thumbprint in it. Not appetizing. I still downed this like crazy, but I feel like the peanuts on top kind of kill the flavor. If the ice cream was peanut butter and not chocolate, I think it would be better; or even vanilla. It was still very tasty, but I would order it sans peanuts next time.   Finally, the check is dropped off. And we wait. 15 minutes. She comes over and asks us if we want the check processed. THAT'S WHY WE'RE STILL SITTING HERE!! I don't know if she thought she was psychic and knew we were paying with the right amount of cash, but damn. We could have been paying with a card as well, cheese and rice! Just take it and ask if we want change or see how we're paying. Bachi Burger all over again.   I left this restaurant infuriated. I LOVED the food, but would only order take-out from this restaurant. You couldn't pay me to sit through that horror show unless it was with Shia LaBeouf and I was dying to spend more time with him - THIS is the restaurant I would take him to. Food and decor would be 4-5 stars, but the service was -4854789547, which is a 2 -star average. I can do math!",

I would recommend dining family style as everyone can get a taste of all the dishes.

The much acclaimed drunken noodles was a hoisin based chow fun wok dish (beef in our case), which was pretty good, I liked the fresh grape tomato and other veggies with the noodles - and the noodles themselves were thin and separated, and actually much better than many I've had previously, but the sauce was nothing special - heavy on the hoisin and salt and light on unique flavor.  If you have lived in SF you have likely tasted better for 1/3 the price.  The panang curry was neither yummy nor authentic and the tom ka gai was bland, ...really really bland by SF standards (compared to nearly any SF mission district Thai spot). Sliced Serrano chiles should not define the flavor of my favorite style of soup.  The galanga/lemongrass flavors were muted or missing and straw mushroom was almost the only solid thing in this all-white soup that really shouldn't be all-white when made right.  The few mini bites of chicken I dredged up from the bottom was downright plain.  We finished the soup, and when the noodles and curry came we had a few bites of each and felt full, but unimpressed.  Took it to go, and did have some of the cold noodles later when hunger returned, but dumped the curry.  Forgot to diss the curry properly.  It had a small amount of curry paste, more like a pink rendang curry, not a deep full red panang style at all.  It was overly thickened with corn starch, so it tasted mostly of canned coconut milk and bland boiled chicken.  We will try a different joint in the Encore next time, maby Botero?",

A giant crystal dragon watches over you as you debate which dishes you'll try this time.  And with that - the Hamachi Chili Sashimi was amazing.  Even the non-sushi eaters in our group loved it.  The Crunch Roll is a work of art that you want to frame rather than eat, but trust me, it's much too delicious just to look at.  The oversized Pork Potstickers with Ponzu Sauce are expertly seasoned and not greasy at all.  For the main course - Drunken Noodles, Salt and Pepper Prawns and Thai Basil Chicken.  All three were equally impressive and the portion sizes were very generous.  The Prawns almost look as if they need a sauce, but after biting into them, you them so juicy that a sauce would only mask their True flavor.  The noodles on the other hand beg you to finish off the accompanying sauce that complements them justly.  The crisp red and green bell pepper adds a nice touch of color to the bowl.  Wazuzu is a MUST try for any foodie in Vegas.",

Also another ding for an unknown reason...while the beef bowl was upscale-ish, it still didn't satisfy my palate for some reason...the vegetables somehow torpedoed the meal for me and I kind of left unfulfilled.",

But my friend insisted we eat here because sushi should be pretty quick but man were we wrong. We waited well over 45 minutes to get one sushi roll, salmon sashimi rice and sashimi. How long does it take to make food that require no cooking besides the rice? The sushi came out and was smaller than a average vietnamese spring roll and my god it tasted horrible. First off this place is supposed to be a high end \"asian restaurant\". The sushi was worse than those pre made plate you could buy at safeway or costco. The service was not all that great as well. This place has to be hands down one of the worst places to eat sushi that i have tried within the last ten plus years. Very disappointed in the overall experience. To top that off we had to pay basically 100 bucks for a crappy tasting roll and a few pieces of sashimi. I would advice anyone who loves sushi not do dine here. Long waits and crappy food complemented with crappy service. They need to focus less on decor and invest more money on the kitchen staff or new head chef.",

For entrees we ordered narsi goreng & the Mongolian beef - both had great flavors! My husband's favorite was the beef and he claims that this was the best Mongolian beef he's ever had. The beef was really tender and full of flavor! The portion sizes were good and more than enough for the two of us to share. The ambience & the service was good too. Overall we had a wonderful experience. When in Vegas, we will definitely go back to Wazuzu.",

We had sushi, rolls, Brussel sprouts, dim sum, Mongolian beef and sea bass. It was all really tasty and high quality.  The atmosphere is just fine and there were Kardashian look-a-likes right next to Larry the Cable Guy (figuratively).   Service was okay. Our server could have paid a little more attention to us.  Overall - excellent food!  Smiley face",

I know I shouldn't be surprised that everything here costs double what it normally would at a hole in the wall Chinese or Thai restaurant, but have to pay $24 for a plate of drunken noodles is still really steep. However, the ambiance at Wazuzu is really nice, and the service is solid, although it does take a while to get your food. We tried:  -Chinese Chicken Salad (Mixed Spring Greens, Citrus Segments, Grilled Chicken Breast, Honey Ginger Dressing, $16, <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wazuzu-las-vegas?select=0jZ04WDDRavAsXO68Ggl_A#-7NwhffgfVuwatreBEKItg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/wazu...</a>): They give you a large portion for a salad and good amount of chicken. The greens were really fresh, and the dressing was good, but the chicken was on the bland side. I would only recommend getting this if you were trying to eat healthy- otherwise, skip. -Drunken Noodles w/Shrimp (Fresh Rice Noodles, Thai Basil, Sweet Soy Sauce, Chilies, Onion, $24, <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wazuzu-las-vegas?select=0jZ04WDDRavAsXO68Ggl_A#0jZ04WDDRavAsXO68Ggl_A\">yelp.com/biz_photos/wazu...</a>): Surprisingly, really good! My friend got it spicy and it definitely had a good kick to it. This dish was flavorful, and the noodles were very fresh. Highly recommended!  Just make sure you avoid getting the Chef's Omakase since the pieces of fish were super skimpy looking and my friend said it was just so-so. it was also a rip off at $65 or something like that.  Overall, I wouldn't go out of my way to eat at Wazuzu again, but if you're already here, make sure you get the drunken noodles!",

The atmosphere, ambience and service was great as you would expect at any 5 star hotel however the taste and quality of food fell really short. Moreover, we were Vegetarians so we were really restricted in the what we could order and felt the food was awfully bland. If you're looking for better vegetarian options with the same level of atmosphere then I'd say give this place a miss and try Lemongrass at the Aria Hotel instead.",

The appointments are nice and well thought out for a sushi restaurant, but because one wall is completely open to the casino, I think you loose something special.   The service was pleasant and prompt, but minimalistic and covered just the basics.   The edamame was terrible and mushy, but the sushi itself was decent. The sake list is limited and uber expensive! For that matter, the sushi is overpriced too. I know, you're in a casino, on the strip, expect to pay high prices, but these seem more than exorbitant.   Either way, it wasn't a horrible experience, but wasn't a stellar one either. If I'm craving sushi and I am already in the casino, I'd probably go again, but I won't seek it out intentionally.",

The menu was a bit limited but that pretty much goes for most asian places so can't fault them much on that.   Atmosphere: Its inside the encore casino which is very nice. Very comfortable booths and chairs at our table.   Service: Very friendly excellent service. Better than expected for a vegas place.   Price: Very moderately priced.

Our waiter was extremely knowledgable about each dish and answered all of our questions and provided recommendations when asked. I also had a great chat about what beers he would recommend. I asked him about micro brews and he gave me a detailed run down on each.   Decor was great. Atmosphere was busy without being loud with a huge crystal dragon on the wall. The front of the restaurant looks out into the casino so it's great for people watching.  The food was great. We each had some appetizers which were delicious but the drunken noodles were amazing. Each bite tasted different from the last and the portions are huge. In fact, you could probably get by splitting an order between two people.   On my next trip to vegas I will make the trip to the north end of the strip just to eat here again.  Especially the drunken noodles.  Prices were great especially for Vegas and especially considering the serving sizes.",

How are you supposed to eat curry without rice?!  Absurd.  Careful about the spice level you get. Pad thai = *insert Obama Not Bad meme here*  Orange Beef = it's hard to go wrong with deep fried beef drenched in sauce Drunken Noodles = nothing beyond what I expected  The service was adequate, but not really to the level I thought it would be for an Encore restaurant.",

    "text": "We had a group of 10, and considering we didn't make a reservation and we went during lunch, we were seated rather quickly. About 10 minutes later, we were all seated at this huge gangster booth/table.  The waiter was very attentive and carefully took our orders. The food took a while to come, but that was to be expected for such a large group.  It really didn't seem like Asian fusion to me. Coming from LA, I tend to have high expectations for Asian food and I tend to avoid Asian fusion. But I really did enjoy all the tastes and textures the food at Wazuzu had to offer.  - Northwestern Roll- spiny tuna roll, topped with salmon sashimi and wasabi tobiko caviar Pretty typical for sushi. Nothing too fancy here. But I ordered several small dishes, so the portion size was perfect for me. But for others, I expect one would want something more substantial for a 30-dollar roll.   - Drunken noodles with beef- Fresh rice noodles with Thai basil, sweet soy sauce, chillies and onions. The waiter asks how spicy you want it from a scale of 1-5. I got 3 and the dish had just the right amount of spice, not noticeable after just one bite, but definitely present throughout the whole dish. This was a little heavy (everyone was extremely hungover), but I enjoyed it. The portion size was larger than the other dishes I got, so I think this would be a good entree for someone with an appetite.  - Tom Yum Rice Noodle Soup I normally wouldn't order $17 soup from a restaurant in Vegas, but everyone was recovering from the night before and I thought soup would be the perfect cure. This soup was pungent, very well spiced and, especially in my condition, hit the spot. The serving was rather small, but I enjoyed it and didn't feel too full after. Oh yah, HUUUUGE shrimp, I likes.  Maybe not the best Asian food I've ever had, and definitely on the pricey side for small portions, but I would definitely come back here. Quality food, friendly staff, and upscale ambience (did I mention we were seated under a huge crystal dragon?!). Yay Wazuzu (:",

    "text": "I'm an Asian food junkie. Thai, Vietnamese, Japanese, Chinese, Korean...I love it all. And living in a place like Los Angeles puts me at an extreme advantage for finding top quality Asian food. That being said, I will usually avoid fusion places because I think it's a little sketchy to be able to order a rainbow roll and pad thai in the same restaurant - how can you do such different cuisines in the same place well? After passing by Wazuzu on my way to the Wynn, I decided to throw aside my doubts and give it a try. Food in Steve Wynn's hotels has rarely disappointed me, so we put our name down (they don't take reservations) and waited. The wait was unsurprisingly long, so we shopped a little until they called us.  I ordered the drunken noodles; my mom ordered the Chinese chicken salad. I got a spicy tuna hand roll as an appetizer. The drunken noodles came out in a large bowl (big portions make me happy!) with shrimps half the size of my fist. It was love at first sight. But it tasted even better: soft noodles, sweet sauce, fresh seafood, the perfect amount of spice. They got it just right. I sampled my mom's salad and was also impressed - it was super fresh and the dressing was amazing. My hand roll was pretty good too. Overall, it was great. And we had enough for leftovers, and I left stuffed. All for a pretty reasonable (Vegas) price? I'm a fan!  We came back again because we liked it so much. This time I ordered the Thai beef salad, which was just as great - citrus dressing, rare beef, fresh greens. And the interior is absolutely gorgeous - the crystal dragon hanging in the back of the restaurant was definitely a sight worth seeing. This was definitely my favorite restaurant at the Encore/Wynn. I will definitely come back the next time I'm in Vegas!",

I give it 5 stars because of the location (in the Wynn/Encore), the ambiance, and the service. We sat in front of the glass dragon on the red wall which was a great photo opportunity. Also, the whole dining area overlooks the casino floor, which is nice too. The nigiri sushi pieces are on the small side. I got an order of toro, which was $ 30 for two pieces. Very small sizes for the price and it was good but not great, as I would expect for toro. So I wouldn't order that again. But the other items I had included salmon, tuna, yellowtail, albacore, and smelt roe; and they were all very good. This is worth a try.",

Yum! My favorite cocktail there is the THAI SILK which combines a basil flavor with a coconut based nigori sake. It's a very refreshing drink!

The beginning of the dining experience started off quite nicely. They take your name at the front, so that the waiters can refer to you by name.  I ordered the drunken noodles with beef, which was delivered piping hot and quick.  While not life-changing, the noodles were quite tasty. Would've preferred a bit greater proportion of noodle to beef. It's a bit heavy if it's your sole entree, but probably great for sharing.    The loss of stars comes from the service after my food arrived. I was asked once about the status of my meal, and no acknowledgment was to be found until I waved down somebody to get my check and leftovers wrapped up. I'm pretty sure my original server's shift was over as he disappeared into thin air.  I waited probably 10 minutes for the check to arrive.  The lady apologized for the wait, but there were probably 5 other tables in the entire restaurant.  I waited a bit for the receipt to return as well.  Bummer ending to a highly anticipated meal.",

If you want seaweed, don't get this- there is a separate seaweed salad.  Next, for our shared main dishes we had  miso glazed black cod, Nasi goreng, and XO green beans.  Cod was delicious! I wanted to lick the sauce off the serving plate but did not given my wife's look when i suggested doing so.  Green beans were crisp and fresh with just that right snap and the XO sauce was salty and savory as it should be.  We ordered the Nasi at heat level 3.5 which was perfect for us but not super hot. If you like spicy, turn it up to 4 or 5 for more kick. Big prawns, little shrimps, and tasty bits of Indo sausage made this dish a winner. We might have liked a little sambal olek to go with, but it was tasty without.   And yes, there is a really cool, giant glass dragon on the wall, so there's that. All in all, good portions, relatively fair prices, and tasty grinds.",

The drunken noodles are no where close to the best thing we ever ate. Bland. No explosion of taste. Boring! Below average taste at best.

Had the Korean BBQ ribs, great flavor and texture of meat was tender too. Fried shrimp was awesome. Peeled and ginormous. Chinese broccoli was tender and sweet. Also ordered a beef dish with green beans or asparagus, can't remember now, with brown sauce, great flavor and very tender meat. The cucumber salad was refreshing but defiantly too small of an order to be worth $10, just thinly sliced cucumber. Tom yum soup was good, had a few shrimp in there, a bit on the sour side.",

The Hamachi Chili (yellowtail) is a must, and if you order the drunken noodles, (heat level 1-5), go at least a 3. We had a \"4\" and it made me sweat in a \"good way.\" Plus the new GM did a fantastic job making sure our experience was top notch. This is why the Wynn properties are the best in Vegas!",

It came to our table in 1 bowl and server took it back to split.  Flavor was ok, temperature of soup almost room temp.  Ordered beef drunken noodles...again, food was almost room temperature.  Flavor was lacking.  Not impressed!  Husband ordered spicy basil beef.  I had a hard time finding any basil in the dish.  Not impressed.    At end of the meal, I told the waitress about the temperature of the food.  She was very nice and apologized.  She removed charge for the soup.  She said that \"there is a fan in the kitchen that was not well placed and when it blows it cools down the food.\"  She acknowledged that it is something they are looking into to remedy.

We were seated right away and actually ordered fast as well. We probably waited a little longer than 15 mins for the food but it was soooooo goood! We got the Mongolian beef and chicken lo mein. Both dishes were excellent and plentiful. The beef was steak slices and very tender with the right amount of sauce to veggie meat ratio. The chicken lo mein was really great as well. Actually both dishes went great with each other. They did offer rice but the hubby said no to it. Not sure why but I guess he didn't want to get filled up on rice. The ambiance is stunning with a crystal dragon on the wall and the tables were really fancy. The place was packed at 12 am so we knew it had to be good. The prices are reasonable for a 5 Star Hotel. I think our meal ended up being around 40 and we had soda. Overall I will go back here when I'm in Vegas. Pricy but worth it when you kinda drink and need some food.",

The selection was fresh and has a crisp taste to it. They also have a wide variety of hand rolls u can choose from. It ranges from raw to semi cook.  Overall great experience !",

It was nice and quiet and no children were there to take away from the ambience.   The sushi wasn't overly pricey and it was some of the best sushi I've had in a long time. We tried a bottle of \"Rock Sake\" which was fantastic! Not too strong but had a great flavor if you like saki. I haven't tried a \"cloudy\" sake so don't let it catch you off guard that it is clear. I'm already trying to find out where I can buy it in CO.   FYI they don't take reservations. We went on a Monday evening so there was no wait but I'm sure it is full during the weekend so I would suggest calling ahead to see their busy times.",

I was initially put off by the extremely high price tags, but hey, this IS Las Vegas. The sushi roll and faux chicken were excellent-far exceeded my expectations! Really fresh tasting ingredients and flavorful without being too salty. Perfect ratio of vegetables to fake meat. The dumplings were mediocre but enjoyable (not enough filling). The real star was dessert-HIGHLY recommend the vegan brownie, which comes with a delicious caramel sauce and ice cream.   Staff here was sweet and friendly but not very attentive. Had to go out of our way to get the attention of our server many times. Lovely atmosphere-a great spot for a date or to come with friends. I will definitely come back here the next time I am in Las Vegas.",

The serving amounts seemed to increase compared to before. Although they usually don't, they took my reservation over the phone as I explained I have kids which makes me hard to wait there in person.

We started out with a couple of signature cocktails - one was a lemonade and the other was a Thai style mojito with Thai basil.  Both were great and really refreshing.   We tried the Shu Mai (pork & shrimp dumplings) and the Cha Siu Bao (Steamed Pork Buns) to start.  The dumplings were awesome...they came with a great spicy thai chili sauce that we both loved.  The steamed buns were so light and fluffy...I have never had a bun that was so delicate.   The pork was a little on the sweet side for me but I added the chili sauce and it turned out perfectly.  We also had the Drunken Noodles which I can understand why they were on Food Network's \"The Best thing I ever ate.\"  The noodles were super flavorful and the shrimp was awesome!    I would totally come back here, the food is delicious and the service was great!",

We had to check in with the host a couple of times and they seated us after 35 mins of waiting. I will say that it has a very Chinese feel to the restaurant. We ordered some steam buns (which were good, you really can't go wrong here) and some sushi rolls. The spider roll felt like it was a baby crab in there and given my luck of testing my crab allergy, I got sick at night. No fault of Wazuzu but my own of course. We each got a noodle and rice dish. I ordered their pineapple fried rice and it was pretty tasty. Must have been the chinese sausage. Now that I've tried it, there are many other better Wynn/Encore restaurants that's worth eating at.",

Chang's. Man, terrible thing about Vegas is really the unfair food prices. Hunt down rundown places that have fantastic food.    I came here as the final dinner with my coworker before heading back home after a trade show. The service is friendly and superb, so these ladies out here are out to make money forsure. The attire can be casual, but the employees look great.   Anyways, I tried sushi with popped rice (like unflavored rice krispies), and it was bizarre. The popped rice was overpowering but had no seasoning, lol. The tuna in the sushi was good though... just trying to justify paying the ridiculous price out here. I split fried rice and an orange chicken entree with my coworker. The food is great, but the entrees are not work $55+. Thankfully we shared, and we were able to leave without leftovers. I was full pretty early though.   I got a lychee alcoholic drink, and it was amazing. I don't remember the price on it, but it probably needed more alcohol. The hot sauce they had lacked severely. I'm not sure if it's toned down for tourist reasons or what. Well, at least our waters were kept full with people on top of their customer service.",

The pad Thai is missing its base flavor. And i have eaten at high end restaurants and cheaper restaurants (Convoy St in SD and SD in general have lots of great ramen place and Thai food), I am not a picky eater either. Just sad it did not work out for me. My server was really nice and offered me to try other dishes. As much as I would like to give it another go, I think twice is enough.

The pineapple fried rice was a little dry but the flavor was good and the prawns were big and juicy.    The pad thai was pretty good, no complaints there.

However, Wazuzu just left me a little \"meh.\" I ordered the vegan shitaki w/eel sauce which was pretty on point. I also ordered the buddha delight and the string bean with fried tofu and mushroom dish. The string beans came out kind of cold, so I had to get that reheated by them and I really just wish the buddha delight was more special. I was secretly hoping for a claypot presentation for that dish, but it just came out with some veggies sauteed in garlic and sesame oil which is something anyone can easily put together at home. What leaves me \"meh\" about this place is that for $20 entree plates of veggies, I'd expect something a little more \"special.\" But hey, this is the Wynn Vegas, and I guess if I really wanted Chinese food, I should have just taken a cab to Chinatown, but my lazy ass was, well...lazy, and my pocket paid for laziness on a plate.  I'd go to this place on an asian food bind, but would stay clear if you've got time for better things in life.",

Surprisingly, everything we had was quite delicious and even better than what you can find from most establishments along Spring Mountain!!  First off, I like how the menu is influenced by various food from several Southeast Asian countries.  In this case, everybody's taste buds can be satisfied as each person can have whichever cuisine they desire; i.e., one can order Thai and the other Japanese.    One dish worth noting is their Nasi Goreng--spicy Malaysian fried rice with shrimp, barbecued pork, lap cheong, sambal oelek and topped with a fried egg.  Not over-hyping it but it actually brought me back to my last trip in Malaysia!!  This version was actually even better especially with the sambal oelek, lap cheong and tiny dried shrimps.  Overall, Wazuzu is definitely worth the hassle going to the strip.  Due to its location, prices are steeper than your typical Pan-Asian restaurant but that won't stop us from eating delicious food.  Trying out their Drunken Noodles next time!!",

I highly recommend the drunken noodles with chicken and the Thai Basil Stir Fry with chicken.   Their 1-5 spicy scale is rather accurate; so choose wisely.",

    "text": "I must admit. They're food and cocktails are pretty good! Although, the service here needs a little tlc.  I had their famous drunken noodles and thai beef salad.  Their DRUNKEN NOODLES were delish! That perfect texture too their noodles (not too moist and not too dry or chewy). We all know the drunken noodles is all about the noodles.   THAT BEEF SALAD was definitely a personal favorite out of the usual salads I have. It has that nice, perfect beef slice to it. Very tender and juicy. This I ordered a level 2 in. While usually spice rating range from 1 to 10. I assumed that since theirs is a 1 to 5 it's double the spice. So I ordered a 2 which was perfect (just don't chew the jalapeno unless you're into that).  I also ordered this really good cocktail as well which was a coconut base. It had a really good light coconut taste, but with this spicy kick to it. It was pretty good. If you've been to the Lucky Rice Market Festival at the Cosmo it is a lot like that Thai Curry cocktail, but with a coconut base rather than a curry base.   Service was a little bit off. They kept confusing orders with a bunch of other people's tables, and they also got our checks wrong too. They didn't add our discount, and then forgot to charge us our drinks, which after we had divided, had to redivide again.",

I've never done this before but when I asked, they were more than accomodating - much much better choice than room service.  I opted to go with a bit of \"dim sum\" for myself. I went with the pan fried pork dumplings, spicy tuna roll and shu mai (shrimp and pork dumplings steamed). All were delicious, served with enough sauce, utensils and napkins. Very delicious and flavorful.  The restaurant was quite busy when I was waiting for my order so I would say whether eating in or taking out, go for Wazuzu if you want a great Asian meal at Encore (or Wynn which is attached via a corridor).",

I understand why everyone photographs the crystal dragon, those are probably not just for Yelp, those are for the photo album and on permanent display.  It's hard to awe in Vegas, where everything is just trying to outdo everything.  But this space does stand out.  Because it is open to the lobby, the red is not overpowering.  And actually, that openness is partly a detraction.  I was seated at a table right where I could see everyone walking by.  A bit of a distraction, that was.  The staff was able to provide me with some gluten-free dishes.  I also had high quality and delicious green tea.  I found the food to be a bit pricy, even considering the location within a high-end (even for Vegas) hotel.  But since I had just dropped a month's rent in the spa, I was for a moment immune to the sticker shock.  It was much later, perusing the credit card bill, that I said, \"That lunch cost HOW much? And with NO liquor?\"  It is a problem when the diners don't perceive value.  And I guess I fall in that camp.  I may come back to sit here and just have a cocktail, if they allow that sort of thing, and contemplate the crystal dragon.",

She wanted to eat soup noodle, so we decided to go to Wazuzu (even though I was looking at yelp reviews on my phone and it wasn't that great). She got Egg noodle soup and I got Tom Yum rice noodle soup. Maybe because I wasn't that hungry, but I seriously didn't care too much for my soup. Her egg noodle soup was really good though.   Ambience 5 stars, Service 5 stars, Food 3 stars.  I would give this place a 4 star if it wasn't so overpriced or the food was better. We got 2 glasses of white wine and 2 bowls of noodle soup, and paid over $80. Definitely NOT worth the price. I don't mind eating mediocre food when it's cheap, I also don't mind splurging on really good food, but Wazuzu fits neither of the two scenarios. If you are at Wynn or Encore and want to eat Asian food, go to Red 8 in Wynn. It costs just about the same, but I think their food is worth the money.",

While standard tourists will complain about the \"high prices\" Wazuzu is easily the most reasonably priced fine asian restaurant on the strip, especially for what you are getting.  The Korean short ribs are some of the most amazing things I have ever tasted, and their sweet and sour chicken elevates way above an 8 dollar styrofoam box from Panda Express.  Everyone I was with had a difficult time finishing their food, although everyone tried as it was all so delicious!  Like the semi-casual arrangement of the restaurant that looks out on the casino, keeps it open and energetic, and not the standard quiet secluded bamboo garden of a typical Asian restaurant.",

The food was excellent this time, and Narine, our waitress, was hilarious and such a sweet girl. She did a great job even though the restaurant was extremely hectic.   HOWEVER, the customer service at the Wynn contacted me after I left a poor review for this business and offered me $60 of credit to wazusu. Today when I informed the manager of the credit I had because of my bad experience, the manager said that when customer service offers credit to guests they then send the guest a confirmation in the form of mail. I never received anything, but the kind manager took care of our appetizers and desserts. It was unfortunate to feel as though I was begging the restaurant for the credit I had been offered only because the customer service representative did not properly document his offer to me.",

With plenty of other offerings along The Strip, dining at Wazuzu should be more a matter of geography (i.e., you're hungry and staying at Encore) than a journey for particularly tasty cuisine.  The Miso Soup was pretty good--chock full of mushrooms, greens, and tofu.  The Cha Siu Bao had a decent filling, but I suspect may have been sitting around a little too long.  The Drunken Noodles also tasted okay but didn't really stand out in any way.  I would recommend it as a plate to be shared (perhaps with one of the specialty dishes) as opposed to enjoyed on its own.  Kudos, however, to the server for nailing my desired spice level after asking for what I was looking for on a scale of 1 to 5.  Overall, Wazuzu did not seem like anything special but adequately fills the obligatory space in the design of a casino resort.  I did consider it a plus to be able to look out on the Encore gaming floor from a slightly elevated standpoint while dining.",

There was way too much going on in that roll. There were onions on top that were marinated in what tasted like gochujang (korean spicy sauce). -The food took a while to get out.

Although many of the dishes have familiar names, there are slight variations that make it different than your average Chinese restaurant.  The biggest difference and in my opinion where the real fusion comes in is the quality of the ingredients.  You will taste the difference in the beef, chicken and pork in every dish.  In addition to the expected Chinese dishes, they have noodle dishes, sushi and dim sum.  So whatever your craving is, you can satisfy it here.  The other fusion which was unexpected was fine dining service.  The little details like pulling out your chair, unfolding your napkin for you, walking you to the restroom instead of pointing and keeping the table clean without being intrusive all add up to a great meal and a great experience!",

    "text": "We just went to the Wynn and ate dinner there last night.   Really a great place !  We were overstuffed from the Buffet and wanted something lighter and Asian.  This was perfect and the portions were large !  Okay... so we got stuffed again people...hey its Vegas !   We had the Drunken Noodles (Chicken)... it was right on yummy.   And, we got the Chinese Chicken Salad -- that was also very good.  Overall a great place and good pricing for Vegas food at a great great hotel.",

    "text": "Anyone who likes Wazuzu must not know how real Pan-Asian food is supposed to taste. Not only is the food here not authentic whatsoever, it's overly-saucy, overcooked, and packed with more salt than you need for a week.  ------------- FOOD:  Drunken Noodles = Way too salty and saucy. We asked for very spicy and it was just barely spicy.  Korean Short Ribs = Meat wasn't very tender and it just tasted very cheap. The flavor was more like Teriyaki than True Korean Galbi.  Crispy Tofu w/ String Beans = Horrible. There was so much sauce in this dish, filled with so much salt, that it ruined something as simply good as crispy tofu and string beans. The tofu was overly-fried and the string beans were undercooked.  Yellow Curry = A huge bowl of bland yellow liquid. This is not curry -- this is watered-down curry broth. --------------  It's such a shame, because Wazuzu has great decor (their crystal dragon is definitely a sight to be seen) and is inside one of the best hotels in Vegas.  I mean, even being slightly starstruck from having Jermaine Dupri sitting at the table next to us (I'm a 90's hip hop fan) couldn't even remotely salvage how horrible food is here.",
