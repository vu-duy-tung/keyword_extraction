First off, they didn't say cash only except for a dinky sign....had to make the BF do a little ATM run. Ugh. All the other Sam Woos took card so I didn't think of it.  The Hot Pot of Eggplant pork and Salty Fish was actually pretty good in flavors and the right balance with the salty fish. I liked this a lot but the rest is so inconsistent.   The roast duck was a bit dry . I'm used to the fatty ones with plenty of juiciness... how does a fatty meat get dry? Granted it was a bit skinny....and usually half is plenty but it wasn't. I had to order some BBQ pork and it was dry like it was sliced this morning and left out. Boo.    I have gone to Sam Woos in Cali and they are a good chain of restaurants there....did not hold very True here. First those SW take card. They are very clean and have good service. The food is consistently good and the place is usually housed in a big space and it actually fills up. One even gave nice hot desserts at the end for free like a bowl of sweet corn or taro with tapioca. I liked Sam Woo in Rowland Heights, Ca so much that I indeed was a 1-2 times a month regular with my mom.   Sorry, but Sam Woo will stay on my CALI repertoire but not here.",

The prices are bay area prices for strip mall cheap eat, which one would expect with Sam Woo. The jook lacks flavor with out a traditional broth base and tofu skin. It tasted like over cooked rice with added hot water. The salted fish fried rice was without the Chinese anchovy which make it tasted like cardboard. The chow fun lacks what Alton Brown calls \"wok hay\". It was more like fun with soy sauce and sprout. To top this, they are a cash only business. How stone age can this place be?",

It was hard to communicated with the sever, he didn't speak English well. None of the servers do. When the food came out, there were little pieces of pork in it.

    "text": "The past reviews pretty much said it all. The only redeeming part about this place is the pork and ducks setup on the racks when you enter the restaurant. But I'll just try to explain how this place seems popular, but still sucks.  There are 3 ways to get people to eat at a restaurant: 1. Establish your name. example: In-n-Out 2. Make your business appear busy. If the place looks busy, it must be good. 3. Word of mouth. example: Yelp  Sam Woo is highly regarded in California. So, when Californians see Sam Woo in Vegas, they must think this place is good as well. The reason this place is busy is because, particularly Chinatown Plaza (where  Sam Woo is located) is because everyday Asian Tour buses stops here, all of which are from California. So naturally, these people are aware of Sam Woo and decide to eat at this Sam Woo. The casual observer sees this place is busy, so it must be good. Don't be mislead! As long as tour buses continue to stop here and Sam Woo has a name in California, the tourist will continue to keep this place a float.  Summary: Tourist trap that uses its name to get people to come, but won't return because of mediocre unflavored food and horrible service. But they're duck and pork is what saves this place.  Recommendation: If you want Chinese food that doesn't suck, check out Food Express on Decataur and Sahara (not in Palace Station). Spend the extra couple of bucks on taxi fare to Food Express to avoid Sam Woo. Yes, the name makes you go WTF, but its a lot better than this place and is NOT fast food.",

Waiter brought my wife's dish in about 5 minutes, but not mine. She didn't think it looked like BBQ pork -- I didn't know. She tasted it, said it wasn't and asked me to taste. I wasn't sure, but she called waiter over and asked if it was pork. He said no, that it was duck. My wife said she's ordered pork. Waiter disappears and a minute later appears with manager who tells my wife she can't return the dish b/c she's already eaten half of it (not even close). Manager says she can bring out BBQ pork, but cannot remake the dish. Waiter returns wife small separate plate of just BBQ pork & my wife has to separate the duck (which she doesn't like). Meanwhile, my food arrives about the same time. It was very tasty, but we'd planned on ordering something additional which we didn't do after the duck incident. Bill arrives, and they've charged an extra dollar for the pork replacement, plus added a $3 gratuity to the total. (Menu states gratuity for 6+ people; we were two adults + child.) We point this out to the waiter and he says, \"OK, OK, you don't have to pay that.\" Really, it doesn't matter how good the rest of the menu might be (and judging by my dish, some of it might be really good). What matters is the TERRIBLE customer service and handling of the incident. Will never ever return, especially with so many other options nearby.",

That seemed to pique everyone's interest...the hungry group was ready to go as soon as I had mentioned it.   We managed to cram 8 people in the backseats of the Jeep Commander. Luckily, as the driver, I didn't have to feel like a sardine.  We headed toward Chinatown Plaza and reached our destination and piled out like clowns at the circus.  Sam Woo's was a blessing to many who thought they'd only be eating at the casino's the whole trip.  I've been to Sam Woo's many times and have not been disappointed with the food.  It's typical HK/Cantonese food and reasonable for an individual or group.  They have Chinese BBQ, which includes roasted duck, roasted pork, BBQ pork, salted chicken, and soy sauce chicken, as well as other staples such as chow mein, chow fun, porridge, won ton, and other meat, vegetable, and seafood creations.  For this particular feast, we decided on a beef chow fun, chicken chow mein, honey walnut prawns, roast duck, bbq pork, spicy tofu, salted pork chops, Chinese broccoli, and Westlake soup.  Everything tasted good and seemed to satisfy everyone's palate.    The Asian restaurant row along Spring Mountain Road has grown over the years, and there are probably similar restaurants that can deliver the same or better quality than Sam Woo.  But it's nice to have a goto place that you can rely on when you're craving Chinese food in Vegas.",

    "text": "This Sam Woo used to be very popular years ago, especially among my family who would always want Chinese food whenever we would visit Las Vegas. It was the best place to come for all your Chinese food favorites, especially the BBQ pork and ducks. Back then the restaurant was also busier, dirtier, and more hectic than now but they were always able to roll through customers without hiccups. Now the restaurant has upgraded its look with new furniture, but the service has gotten worse than ever before. No wonder the lines aren't as long as they used to be.  I recently went on the Monday after Christmas weekend and the wait was about a 20-30 min wait which isn't bad but the hostess didn't seem like she was able to organize a good table for us, let alone for other people who were already seated. They complained to her to change tables because their party was split and wanted to sit closer together. This caused more confusion for her to assign seating to following groups. Eventually, we were stuck with being put on a joint table with another group of 4 whom had already been seated. She didn't bother to move our table slightly away from theirs because that would've caused another problem; there wasn't enough space to walk by. It is good they have nicer tables, chairs, booths but it felt like they're not able to accommodate as many people within the confined space they have in the restaurant.  We ordered our usual food but it took at least 40-50 mins for everything to arrive at our table. Bussers would be seen running around, clearing tables, delivering food but I noticed they were getting a lot of orders mixed up. One of our dishes, the beef tripe, arrived AFTER we were almost finished with our meal that we didn't even want it anymore. They served it to us anyway because why not, let the customer eat the cost.  Sam Woo used to be one of my favorite Chinese restaurants to go to but just within a few years ago the quality has fallen quite significantly that I don't think I'll be coming back here to this Vegas location. I'll stick with the few surviving Sam Woos in California.",

There weren't many people in the restaurant and the service was quick just like other Chinese restaurant I've been to in Vegas, except that their food sucks here! We ordered roast duck wonton noodles and double BBQ Lo Mien (BBQ duck and pork over noodles with sauce). The roast duck wonton soup was bland, wontons are small ( not hongkong shrimp wontons like the waiter claimed  ) ,and only 2 pieces of duck. The double BBQ Lo mien has very little meat also, and the duck is bony with very thin meat. Too me it's very disappointing because I love roast duck and I came here for roast duck.  Worst thing was, the bill came up to 24 dollars including  tax, and we paid 26 bucks including tips, for two bowls of bland noodles with very little meat!!!   We will never come back.",

    "text": "Okay, when my wife found out there was a Chinatown in Las Vegas, she just wanted to try out a restaurant to see how it compared to our areas of San Gabriel, Monterey Park and LA Chinatown.  Well, simply put, there is no comparison.  I don't know how these restaurants survive, when compared to the inexpensive casino foods and buffets.  I asked the server where to find good dim sum, and she says she goes to the Rio for the best dim sum.  Mind you the restaurant did not serve dim sum, so I felt safe asking the question of a local.  As for the food, it was meh, in comparison to the Sam Woo in Alhambra, which I have patroned for over 20 years.  I think it would be a nice touch to have the peking duck, roasted pig in the front showroom of this restaurant, but possibly, not many tourists order such dishes and so may not have experienced these fine dishes we have available in southern California.  If you have a hankering for Chinese food, there is no place like home.",

I looked careful at where he pointed and didnt see the note that says will dishes don't come with rice, so when he came back i asked politely that I didn't see it. He then got really inpatient and walked away with the menu without saying a word, then came back and said \"it's here\" and left.  TERRIBLE! NEVER EVER GO!

    "text": "Folks, consider this review a friendly warning. I gave SAM WOO one star, but I would have given it half star if I could.  My wife and I had eaten at this place many times before when we visited Las Vegas in the past.  Face it, when you had several buffets, steaks and pizzas. you would really crave for a bowl of hot wonton noodle soup topped with roast duck on a cold night.  That's exactly what we ordered.  The food was decent before. This time, it had left a bad taste in my mouth.  For my story, first, let me set the scene so that you get the picture. We arrived Vegas on 24th.  After a few buffets and burgers. we wanted some Chinese food, so we decided to go to SAM WOO.  When we walked in, the place was completely mobbed and many large parties for 5 and up were waiting. Customers with waiting numbers were literally standing in front of the table where sat down customers were still eating. So it didn't take long  for a table for  2.  We were seated about 20 minutes later. We were given a small table very close to the aisle. The hostess slapped the menu on the table and since we knew exactly what we wanted, we waved at the waiter to order. He came but the whole time during my order, he never had eye contact with me. He came back minutes later with a pot of lukewarm tea and put down 2 tea cups which his had his thumb inside.   The tea tasted like it was served to the previous customer. It was barely warm. So we asked him for 2 glasses of iced water.  The wonton noodle soup and the chow-fun came after about 20 minutes. The soup was terrible. it was not hot and the wontons tasted like old chopped pork wrapped in soggy wonton skin with no shrimps them. It didn'ttaste like traditional wontons. After 30 years in business, this is how SAM WOO makes the wonton! And the noodle was soggy ( probably it sat in the soup too long. At this point, I thought a cup of Roman Noodle sounded pretty good, Chow Fun was ok though. So my appetite was somewhat ruined. We wanted to get out of the restaurant so bad as we were not happy with the food nor the service.    I waved at the waiter for the check. He gave me a bill for $24 but along with it, there was a white slip of paper with $27.60 written on it. I knew the 2 items should be about $20 before tax. I waved down the waiter and questioned him about the total. He had the gall to tell me, because of the holidays, there is a $ 1.00 per head tea charge, with tax it is 24. The 15% tip calculated after tax being added was mandatory. I said I didn't asked for the tea (which was cold), and if  tea charge is the new holiday policy, he should inform the customers before serving the tea. Anyway, I didn't want to hash it out with the waiter, so I left the money on the table for the check amount plus tax and 10% as his service. And I told the table next to me which was a family of 6 ordering many dishes about their sneaky practice. I advised them be watchful of the bill. I did notice a couple of big parties leaving cash tips on the table on top of the snuck-in tip on the bill without realizing the tips were already included on the bill. A large party could easily run up to a $100 - $120 even for noodles and soup. If the waiter sneaks in a 15% tip on a $100 bill, that is $15 dollars for service on the bill. If customers didn't look at the bill carefully and tip him again. That's shady practice! I hope the restaurant's management is reading this so that they can change their way of doing business. I truly believe the waiters would not dare to carry out this practice without the consent of the management. I used to work in the hospitality industry. There is no such thing as mandatory tip. Gratuity is a reward for good service rendered.  If an establishment forces the gratuity on the customers when the service is sub-par. the sneaking in the tip is bordering line committing a consumer fraud without prior information given to the customers. Every charge should be clearly listed on the check and additional special charges must be informed to the customers. When we make a reservation for a party more than 5 people, some restaurant will inform the customers there will be a 15% ( sometimes 20%) service charge on the bill. SAM WOO did not inform the customers and took advantage of the holidays and gambling on people feeling hesitant to make a fuzz.  I was about to ask to talk to the manager, but second thought, it was Christmas and the placed was crowded with people. So I did the next best thing, get out of there leaving what I believed the correct amount was plus 10% which is more than what he deserved.    I will never go back again. I believe a restaurant has to try hard to gain the customers' business and trust. As a customer, would you get yourself upset by eating in a place serving low quality food  and service was so lousy that you had to spend an hour writing and bitching about it!  Folks, stay away. If you do decide to eat there, watch for any discrepancy on the bill, the waiters are sneaky.",

She later decided to just try to order something Togo over the phone and they said they don't take orders over the phone. WTH???? When she finally went in to order the girl was pretending she didn't understand what my wife was ordering. This place is dirty, food overpriced, and the staff is rude and stupid.  We definitely won't be back. This place gives Sam Woo a bad name.",

They forgot one of our four dishes and when we reminded them, we didn't get a response. There was a piece of plastic found in our tofu dish and it was dangerously large.

Not the cleanest Ordered:  Westlake Beef Soup, Flamebroiled Pepper-Beef Steak, Ginger Chicken, and Seafood-Tofu claypot Total incl gratuity: ~$  Expensive.  Definitely gone down-hill.  And quite simply put, not worth it.  The only thing worth mentioning was the soup.  The pepper beef steak was sliced way too large and quite difficult to chew.  The ginger chicken was terribly dry.  And I wasn't interested in taking another bite of the seafood tofu claypot.  To top it off, each entree ran $12 - $18.  $60 for four entrees at a Chinese restaurant?? Definitely not worth it it!  I've typically gone here for lunch and ordered noodles.  Now I'm scared and likely not to return.  I'm going to stick with pho in Chinatown from now on.  Fellow yelpers: any suggestions on other better Chinese restaurants in the area? ;)",

The service is poor, the waiters look pissed off all the time, the water is definitely from tap and they charge you 75 cents if you use a credit card with less than twenty dollars in your bill. But if you do come here, don't come for the service, just come for the food. The roast duck is decent and a lot of their dishes are fairly inexpensive. Is it oily? Hell yeah. But those who frequent real Chinese restaurants should expect that. Don't come here if you're gluten free, on a diet or have special instructions on your meal. This is a no frills Chinese restaurant and they're pretty much just here to serve what they want to serve whether you like it or not. This place is pretty authentic, right to their servers. On a good note, the hot tea is free. So give it a try and appreciate their fast service, a plus if you're in a hurry or really hungry!",

Our inner-Asians were dying for some noodle soup to start the recovery process so we swung by Sam Woo in Chinatown.  At the Sam Woo(s) in CA, I always order the Siu Gow Noodle Soups over the regular Wonton Noodle Soup. Unfortunately the guy who took our order informed me that they didn't offer it at this location. I opted for the standard Wonton Noodle Soup and we split the roast pork and gai lan for the table.  My bowl was packed with a TON of noodles and HUGE wontons. Unfortunately the broth and the wontons lacked flavor. \"all this needs is a little soy sauce...\"--NAME THAT MOVIE!  But the roast pork was delish. The meat was juicy and tender....and the cracklings were wonderfully crunchy.  Over all, it definitely was not the best but hot soup hits the spot after a long partying binge :)",

    "text": "So I ordered late night for delivery via door dash. The food arrived quickly and hot which is always a bonus. I ordered two items, the Mongolian beef and the roast pork lo mein. The Mongolian beef was well seasoned and flavorful and had lots of scallions which I appreciated. It had enough sauce to coat with some residual in the container but not over done and drowned like some places in town can do. The roast pork on the lo mein was actually excellent. It was tender, rendered well, flavorful and still had very crispy skin (another surprise considering it was delivery). Unfortunately the noodles were a big let down and is the reason why I had to subtract a star from my review. I was expecting the classic American-Chinese  style thick soft wheat noodles. They were instead the thin \"chow mein\" style wheat noodles. I am aware that lo mein dosent have to be the thicker noodles and I would have been ok with that if they were prepared well. Unfortunately they were not. They were not crispy like I expect from chow mein style thin noodle nor were they sir fired with some sort of seasoning, sauce or aromatics like I would expect from a thicker style lo mein noodle. In fact they had no flavor at all. They seemed to have just been boiled, strained and placed in the container with the slices of pork (delicious pork) on top. I had to pour the little bit of sauce from the beef on top, as well as soy sauce and lime (from my own fridge) to make them palatable. Once I doctored them up they were quite enjoyable but I don't feel I should have to adjust my food to that extent. I will certainly eat here again for the pork and go try the Peking Duck and maybe some other entrees. However I will be getting my lo mein (and probably noodles in general) fix somewhere else.",

I've been searching this city for a long time for authentic char siu and haven't been able to find it. The chat siu here was quite good and I would say the best in the city (though still not hitting the mark for my search). The duck came with bone and all and a nice crispy skin. The platter was actually very large which was fortunate as $15 is quite expensive when there's other similar Chinese BBQ joints in town for about $5 less (albeit significantly smaller meat portions). The platter came with only the meat and rice which left me wanting a little as I like to have some greens in this type of dish, but I'll know for next time to order a side of Bok Choy or the like.   The restaurant is actually quite large and would be a nice sit down destination in the Chinatown shopping center. I'm not sure if they have lunch deals with soup, side, meat, etc. around $10 like the other comparableS in the city, but if so I think this could be the destination if craving close to quality Chinese char siu.",

Here are the reasons for the 1 star:  - The food tastes so-so. - There were 26 of us and they were going to charge us $1 per person for rice even though we had ordered many (overpriced) entrees. I mean, really?! - The baby-sized cups for water. I can't tell you how many times the cups had to be refilled because they were mini sized. It was laughable. - Lastly, we were celebrating our uncle's retirement party and brought a couple cakes. We asked to use their knife. As we were leaving, a lady (hostess? owner?) accused us of taking the knife even though we told her that we had left it on the table. She specifically told one of my cousins that if he didn't hand it to her directly that she would charge us ... this is after we had just spent $300 for our so-so, overpriced dinner.  Never going there again nor recommending it to anyone - should have looked at the Yelp reviews before coming here, especially when there are better places nearby.",

We walked in, and immediately saw the \"Cash Only\" sign.  Luckily, we had enough cash to cover our charges for 4 people.  Once seated, we placed our orders, and were struck by how expensive everything was, especially for an establishment that is cash only.  The meal itself, was adequate.  We ordered a 3 bbq meat combo (Approx. $14) and I was expecting to see 3 dishes filled with 3 separate meats.  But, instead we were served a small plate with thinly sliced, smallish pieces of meat.  We also had wintermelon soup, which hit the spot to warm us up on that chilly night.  We shared some snow pea tips and braised tofu as well, which were OK.    At the end of the meal we received our check, and did a double take when we saw that they added in tip automatically for our party of 4.  While we were somewhat annoyed that they had already added tip for a party that I wouldn't consider large, we were also amused that their additional tip was only 10%.  I guess they don't think much of their own service if they only give out 10% to the automatic tips!",

He also told me I could not get a lemon in my water, which was weird considering they served tea with lemons and lemons with other beverages. Overall I was not super impressed by the location and the food was not good enough to outweigh the lack of service.",

It came out hot but the beef was kind of thick. There was a good balance between bean sprouts, beef and fun.  2 choice meat (BBQ Pork and Duck): The BBQ pork was not cut right. It should be thinner but I've noticed a lot of butchers at all restaurants aren't cutting it right. Duck wasn't meaty at all. They just gave mostly bones.   Wonton Noodle Soup: Soup base is light so it seems that they had a broth but added more water to make more.  Service was ok. Only one waiter working and a cashier. They were also switching shifts when we came because we came here for an early dinner.   The restaurant is big enough for large parties. You can also take food to go.

Food is not tested good like before, small portion, pricey ($58.35 for 3 per.) and slow service.  The worst part is: the cashier lady tried to over charge you!!! Here is the trick: she printed our a credit card receipt with amount $58.35. Then, she stapled another small sticker on top of it with a $7.00 item (no details shown what it is), so the amount became $65.35. If I didn't pay attention, I may paid $58.35 + $7.00 + Tips! I asked her what is that? She quickly took it off and said it was for another customer!  Big liar! Be careful people!",

The first one had miniature, ridiculous looking shrimp (probably imitation ones) while the second one had a few minced scallops and no shrimp at all. We told the waiter who took the dish back to the kitchen only to bring same dish back a minute later. He said that the cooks told him that the shrimp were chopped very little but were there. Of course you could not even smell the shrimp nor see them. Why would they use shrimp in one dish and none in the other is a mystery. all I know is that they will never see us again and we suggest you to do the same. The waiter also said that their food is authentic Cantonese. PS: We eat shrimp fried rice at Cantonese places all the time so we know how it supposed to look.",

My husband and I went to dinner last Friday night...we were not super hungry so decided to order salt and pepper shrimp (with shell), combination BBQ plate that consisted of BBQ pork and BBQ duck and combination fried rice.  Everything came in a split second which made us question the food before we even tasted it. The BBQ plate was horrible - the pork was burned and the duck was soggy instead of crispy. For a place that has BBQ in it's name, this was a complete sin.  The shrimp looked like it swam in mud before it got to the table - I've never seen such black shrimp in my life! and the worst plate was the fried rice which we completely sent back since the shrimp was old and tasted funny...we ran out of there and drove home asap (right on time for our stomachs to turn). I'll leave the rest of the details out.  I'll say it one more time - NEVER AGAIN -",

But my main complain is the rice, why serve rice and sit on the table get cold whole waiting for the main entree. So we end up eating cold food instead. Rstaurant is not even busy. Just 5 table, 2 waiters. And then we needed water,  and not one of them came and check if we were ok. I could have been choking to death and they dont even know it.",

You can get better deal in other BBQ joint at Jones ave.  I felt like I was eating garbage, I could only finished half of the food because it did not taste good.  The quality of duck was so-so, very little duck meat and too grease.   To make my experience worst, the service person added too much soy sauce to my rice, to test my sodium intake to a daily new high.   I can't convince myself to come back anytime soon.  Strike One.",

I ordered salt and pepper fish and the fish was not hot, the salt and pepper pork chops had about 5 pieces on the plate, and the sweet and sour fish had minimal sauce. On top of the food not tasting good, I don't know how 3 sides, rice, and hot tea turned into an $80 bill. FYI a dish in the San Gabriel Valley is under $10 a dish for lunch and under $15 for dinner for simple Chinese food- and, it tastes so much more satisfying that this LV Sam Woo. I mean, I'm glad I tried it so I know never to go back. I would recommend going to a buffet to get Chinese food instead..",

    "text": "There is a huge reason why I check reviews before attending restaurants, but every once in a while. I'm super hungry and get the first thing available. Today, that was unfortunately here.   I ordered the scallion and garlic lo main, tofu and pork in a spicy pork, and roasted duck (because why not).   Let's start with the worst, which was probably the roasted duck. The skin wasn't crispy and the duck itself had a weird aftertaste that my stomach is already unhappy about. Which makes me suspicious of the freshness of the duck before it was roasted, or when it was roasted. It definitely was cooked all the way.... too much, which made it dry and I needed a lot of water to swallow it down.  What was a little better was the lo mein, but it was super bland, it need of fresh scallions for a crunch, and  and as super sticky. Most of it together in globs what I was unable to separate. I did use it as a base for the pork and tofu which weren't half bad.  I have learned to embrace that tofu in Chinese cuisine is usually overcooked. I did like how it took in the flavor of the sauce that it came in, but it didn't come with slices of pork, it came with ground pork that I found to be oddly grainy. Out of the three this dish was the most edible.  Because I took my order to go, I can only just on food quality and food time, which was super fast.   I do have to add that if you are sensitive to MSG in any way, I am almost 100% sure that it plays a large part in their cooking methods.   I would suggest to not come here, but if you need emergency quick Chinese food, this could do.  Happy Eating",

    "text": "My wife and I had to stop by 99 Ranch Market to pick up food for some recipes and wanted to grab a bite to eat afterwards. The criteria we used to make our choice is that we window shopped every restaurant on both levels of the Chinatown Plaza and whichever food looked best, we would stop in. We gazed in at a family of four dining through the window at Sam Woo like they were a puppy we interested in buying at the pet shop and it looked appetizing enough for us.  We had no wait to be seated on a Saturday night at 8 PM with the restaurant around 25 percent full. I didn't see the 350+ review, 2-star rating until after I checked in while we were sipping on some hot tea. So I told my wife we better play it safe for our order. We split the 3 item BBQ combination with chicken, roasted duck, and subbed roasted pork ($1) for BBQ pork ($17.95) and a bowl of wonton noodle soup ($8.25). I was actually very pleased with the combo. The meat wasn't overcooked topped with a vinegar based sauce with a herb aroma that I couldn't figure out. The meat went well with an order of steamed rice. My wife had the majority of the soup, which she was happy with, but had a strange odor to me.  Service that night was typical of many Chinatown restaurants: greeted, seated, menus dropped off with no other greeting, come back 5 minutes later to take entire order, food is dropped off, maybe see the waiter again, and pay up front.  The menu is very large with items numbering into the 200s. You can also take your order to go by ordering at the take out area up front. All in all, our meal wasn't miserable, but I'm not sure I would come back.",

    "text": "Maybe my experience was colored by the many great Sam Woo restaurants in California, but this location is just average.   My aunt and uncle were in Las Vegas with some guests from Taiwan, and we decided to have dinner in Chinatown. Instead of Yelping, he picked this plaza, and then as a group we picked Sam Woo because of the brand name.  It wasn't until I checked in after sitting down that I noticed the two-star overall rating, which honestly shocked me a bit. In the end, I don't think the food is so bad that the whole restaurant deserves only two stars, but I will agree that it is not quite up to par with most Cantonese restaurants.  The eating bowls, plates, and cups were plastic, not ceramic, and looked a little cheap to be honest (and were this strange light blue color). Even some of our dishes were served on similar plastic plates (at least serve on plates with a little design if you opt for plastic)! I was surprised that the presentation of the dishes was so lackluster, given the pride the people from this region of China usually have about their food.  As for the food itself, it was decent but a bit too salty and oily, even for Chinese food. The menu was extensive but it was lacking some of the more prestigious/premium dishes, and where were all the quality soups? We ordered a vegetable dish, a tofu dish, a beef dish, a BBQ plate, and soup to share (see photos/captions).   The interior of the restaurant is still relatively nice looking, though not as sleek as some other Cantonese places. And while some others have mentioned poor service, I thought that the service during our meal was fairly attentive from both waiters to bussers (maybe it helps if you speak Mandarin or Cantonese).  This Sam Woo is not terrible by any means but I feel like it's not quite up to the well-established Cantonese restaurant standard, and there are a lot of options in Chinatown. Granted, I still have to try more places in Vegas Chinatown to get a baseline impression of food in this region, since my gold standard is still California restaurants and we are spoiled there.  P.S. I've come to the conclusion that pretty much all of my lower-rated reviews have been at places that I didn't Yelp beforehand. Lesson learned: trust Yelp! If a place has more than just a few reviews by regular Yelpers, there is reason to take stock.  P.P.S. Oh yeah, I almost forgot. The waiter explained when he brought us our check that gratuity was already included. I thought this was kind of strange since we were only a party of 5. It looks like they do take credit card now (in reference to some older Yelp reviews of this place), but they have pretty high minimums (e.g. $20) and several categories (see the paper taped to the register).",

For ten people we ordered: roast duck, gai lan (chinese broccoli), chicken congee, yin yang rice, 2 bowls of won ton noodles, yu xiang eggplant, fried rice, stir fried fish over vegetables. I can't recommend any of it, except that it was edible.  Roast duck: the skin was not crisp and the duck was not flavorful. Most bites were greasy.   Gai lan: overcooked. Everything was mushy. I would recommend this for people with dentures or weak teeth  Chicken congee: tasted like plain rice with a couple pieces of chicken tossed in. No flavor whatsoever.  Yin yang rice: passable. A little more gloopy than the typical rendition, but it was one of the first dishes we finished as a group.  Won ton noodles: really fine thin noodles that were overcooked to mush. The shrimp in the wonton was so unnoticeable, we made a game of finding shrimp in the wonton.   Stir fried fish over vegetables: Not bad! The fish were alright and the vegetable mix was fine.  Fried rice: Alright, pretty salty but had a good mix of char siu bites and shrimp in the dish.   On the way out, we took a closer look at the crispy roast pork hanging on the bbq hook, and the fat had dripped down but re-solidified on the pork. Really unappetizing  Service was alright and the food came out relatively quickly, there weren't many others in the restaurant though.",

The waitress looks like she just came out from a funeral. We ordered 2 entrees for 2 adults and 2 children but she had the nerve to give us only 2 bowls (because we ordered only 2 entrees).

Anyway the bbq pork is hard like a rubber while the chicken is decent.  Anyway our request for ice water never came. The bill came out about $34....too expensive for such crappy food and service.

My family and I entered this establishment entrusting the ICONIC brand we have all come to associate with Chinese BBQ...\"Sam Woo\"...This was more like \"Sam POOP\". I cannot fathom a more deplorable restaurant where over flooding restrooms foul and pungent odors flooded the whole restaurant. Initially I suspected it was some preserved or fermented dish. After ordering and realizing with other patrons that this had to be a health hazard. The food was served and that was the more egregious aspect to this restaurant. I express with utter honesty that not one dish was cooked with the faintest of care or desire to warrant returning customers. Bland overcooked or an oil slick is how I would describe it. I am bitter...absolutely bitter at the lack of service/ half [donkey] food dishes and value. I dare anyone who wants to be infuriated to try it and oppose this review. Otherwise visit them and thank me for trying to warn you from this hazmat establishment. YES THE FOOD WAS GARBAGE AND THE RESTAURANT EMBODIED THE LANDFILL I SPEAK OF.",

HUGE MISTAKE! service was the worse i got. We asked for water and this waiter gave us 2 tea kettles and one was supposed to be \"iced water\" which was clearly tap water and the other one was tea. He gave us those small white tea cups while the rest of the tables have the big blye cups of iced water. I asked the bussboy who was kind enough to give us decent cups with iced water. Mind you, the good service we had was from the bussboy. Fried pork was so dry it is so obvious it wasnt newly cooked and had been around since. Chicken wings was bloody and nasty! All the other foods werent tasteful and it tasted to me just like some nasty chinese food from a restaurant that no one goes to. I have tasted CHEAPER AND MUCH BETTER BIG PORTION FOR BETTER PRICES of chinese food elsewhere. This one is just beyond gross. NEVER EVER EVER EVER WILL I BE GOING BACK HERE. oh and by the way, the lady (might be manager) who was wearing casual clothing and working there seemed irritated with all our complains. INSTEAD OF BEING ANNOYED WHY NOT FIX YOUR SERVICE AND FOOD?  We ended up paying $140 for bad food quality and bad service. Not worth it!   If i could not give any stars i wouldnt.

There were about 4-6 waiters just standing around looking soooo sleepy & bored, but our waiter was very attentive to us and nice. Once we were ready to leave, more people came in for brunch.

Here's the reason for a one-star:  Congee (rice porridge) is BLAND! I'm talking about pure rice water bland. You'll need heapings of salt, pepper, soy sauce, whatever! Congee is supposed to have a saltiness to it, flavored from boiling it with salted pork or beef.   Milk tea tastes neither of tea or milk. It's kinda like watered down, ovaltine-ish...?   Beef ball was \"lukecold\" in the center. I think they throw the frozen balls into the broth and call it a day.   The only thing that came out right was the wonton noodle soup (how could you mess THAT up?)   Service is subpar, even for our low standards. Greeting is weird, requests for various utensils are ignored or forgotten, and the guy cleaning up the table is auditioning for a heavy metal band.   I think this place gets a lot of business because of location and because it is very busy (yes, misinformed social proof... A downward spiral, if you will).  Well, I guess you could always come in and look at the girls...",

    "text": "Chinese food: the great American comfort cuisine. Whether it's a late night where you don't feel like cooking or if you feel like splurging on your diet, there is always loyal wholesome Chinese food you can rely on. Flavor and exotic taste is the promise of the American Chinese cuisine. Unfortunately \"Sam Woo BBQ Restaurant\" is NOTHING like what was mentioned in the previous sentences. Instead of the familiar tasty Chinese food we all know and love, it was a mashy mish slop of poor cooking and over priced bland food. We had a few dishes, but more than enough to complain about. After a week's trip at Las Vegas we entered this small, dirty establishment in hopes of being greeted with a fine Chinese dining experience. Our hopes were very very wrong.  First we had ordered the Chinese white cut chicken, a salt marinated dish usually served as an appetizer or main meal. This was neither, instead it was an offensive dish to Chinese standards. There was literally no taste as if the cooks just had dumped the chicken in plain boiling water and went off to go do something else half-assed with their weak culinary skills. Several of the dishes after this were also the same, missing on any type of taste whether it was suppose to be a spicy beef cooked with eggplant or pork slices which were really soggy. They eventually served us the ong choy (chinese spinach) we ordered but upon closer observation we could tell that the vegetables were old and withered, all the parts that should be green were a sickly yellow.   And maybe all of this could had been forgiven if it weren't for the smudgy dirty plastic dishes they used, the lack of a function AC in Las Vegas summer weather and especially the price the put on all of this tasteless food. For only 6 dishes the whole meal cost near $100 dollars! And they already threw in gratuity onto the check even though it was just 5 people eating. I guess this is the only way the waiters could actually make any tips because they seemed to lazily shuffle about and place down your food farthest from your seat.   Overall this probably is the worst restaurant I have ever been. Definitely the worst chinese restaurant. I'm surprised how this place is still open after all the bad reviews. If these owners of this restaurant had a single shred of pride they'd do something and work toward fixing this dump and horrible imitator of real Chinese American cuisine.",

I had to flag one waiter down again just to make sure we got them. They charged us $14 for a combo of  roast pork and chicken, and the plate was small! The fried rice was mediocre at BEST. The tea was not great and our server should not have been given a tip but this place automatically adds the tip to your final bill. What kind of restaurant does that? Never coming back here.",

I'll upload an image of the bones. Duck breast meat bones are flat and long.   The fish fried rice did not actually include any fish.   The deep fried tofu was bland and uninteresting.   It was one of those, \"wow, these people really suck at their job\" moments and one of the worst dining experiences of my life.",

And could not get the attention of waiters for forks. And when we did get our forks, they were nasty with food stuck in the crevices, all three of them. (Used forks or they just don't know how to clean). Ordered 4 items for to go. Only receiced three. Although it may be understandable because they are pretty busy, this place is not the place to be if you expect any attention from the staff. Im not asking for the service a super expensive restaurant would give but the staff here are just plain rude. Food not good enough to come back. The staff here just frustrates people. No wonder their reviews are so low. Shitty service = no tip. Id rather go to mcdonalds.",

Example: the BBQ Combination Plate which had the BBQ Pork, Roast Duck and Chicken.  We were excited to order it but when we received it what a huge let down.   The serving size was pretty small and for the price (I believe it was $16.99) you'd expect it to be much larger. As far as the actual taste.....Hell, I've had better Chinese BBQ at the 99 Ranch in Chino Hills here in Cali.  Also, it had to have the filthiest bathroom that I've seen in awhile which really made wonder about the cleanliness of the place overall.   Overall an underwhelming experience I'd say don't waste your time here.",

At most restaurants you would end up having to wait and we thought this one would be packed. It wasn't, and for good reason. I've been to several different Sam Woo BBQs and this is by far the the worst one. This can only be described as a Sam woo in the name only. The food is terrible, the service was terrible. When we got to check, they did not to mention that the tip was included in the check. Most of the tables at the restaurant had paid the tip twice! And they didn't deserve any tip!Service was so bad I was looking forward to going to the DMV for my next meal. Trust me there's no reason to find out for yourself how bad it is. I wish we had checked the reviews before we came. We ordered roast pork, roast duck, house special chow mein, wonton soup, and one vegetable dish. Roast pork was disappointing, cold, and cut super thick. Duck was cold and thin. The special chow mein was too oily and flavorless. And wonton soup was unimpressive. Just don't go. And if you go don't leave a tip. It's already in your check.",

It comes down to if you don't mind slow service it's perfectly fine. Their food was excellent.   Sam Woo only excepts cash so make sure you have some on you. We were seated quickly and green tea was brought out to us. Their menu is gigantic! Omg talk about all the things. It seriously made it hard to pick. I knew I wanted something that had their tasty duck. When you first walk into Sam Woo's you are greeted by ducks that are cooking behind glass. After looking over the menu several times Joel and I both decided on the Duck Wonton soup with noodles.   It took a while for it to come out. But when it did that was one huge bowl of soup. It was literally filled to the brim. I was shocked the waiter didn't spill any out of either bowls on the way over to our table. On the top of the soup were sliced pieces of crispy duck. Mmmm duck skin. The broth was delicious and omg the wontons. There were probably 6 huge wontons and when I broke them open you could see actual shrimp in the meat mixture. They were so tasty. At the bottom of the bowl were noodles that I'm pretty sure we're made in house. What a tasty bowl of soup. All the ingredients worked so well together.   Now the wait for the check and a to go container for my soup. It was about 15 minutes until we got our check. Once our waiter came an got our check and money he did bring our change back quickly.   Not really sure why the service is so slow at Sam Woo. There weren't that many people there, but then again there was only one waiter. The food was so good it really didn't matter. If I'm in the Chinatown area I'll for sure stop in for that crispy duck!",

The staff here is crazy rude and botched our take-out order to hell which didn't become obvious of course until we were home. It's insanely overpriced for a Chinese restaurant at $15 a dish and we were left with cold and tasteless food for dinner. Flat noodles and beef tasted like cardboard, clams in black bean sauce had four or five clams and the rest were empty shells, chicken wings had visible thick chunks (CHUNKS, not flakes) of MSG on them, and the vegetable dish we ordered was something else entirely. Bonus: we called back to point out this wrong order and they hung up.  Avoid this place at all costs. Yelpers got it right.  Oh, and cash only so they can duck the IRS.",

    "text": "Don't let the average rating deter you from trying them in Chinatown. Yes, service isn't going to be spectacular or super friendly, but the food is ok.   I'll be honest, the food wasn't as tasty or great as back in LA.  The salted fish and chicken fried rice didn't have any salted fish flavor and the chicken was rubbery. In LA, there might be variations that have shredded lettuce cooked with it and maybe that would have made this dish better.  The fish filet with veggie dish was average, nothing special. There was definitely more fish than veggies.   The beef with green onion dish was average as well. We were joking that this dish might taste good as a sandwich later on.   The pan fried chow fun was decent, but was oily like it normally should be for a dry noodle dish.   Sam Woo is know for their chopped meats (char siu, duck, chicken, cuttlefish, etc). When we ordered the char siu and fish combo, I was kind of disappointed because the dish was small and the cuts for duck weren't very meaty (mainly bones).   On the plus side, they serve their tea with very large tea cups!!!  Yelp 100 challenge - 40 of 100",

Even the manager, who eventually was called over to assist - had an attitude displayed all over her face like it was a burden for her to take our order. They were pretty quick in bringing over the bill though.   I have to say - I did enjoy a few of the dishes however, the entire experience was spoiled with how the servers provided very little service, that was heavy on the attitude.   I won't be back.",

The place is not clean by outward appearance, but an A is in the window so hopefully the kitchen is. The restaurant is tiny, old and worn. The place appears to be beat up from all the traffic. Had KungPao chicken on recommendation from the hostess who was very nice. It was good, nothing amazing. The rice included rib, shrimp and chicken. It was delicious.

    "text": "What legitimate business in the food industry does not accept credit cards in this day and age, or at least have decent signage for it right as you enter? Apparently that place is Sam Woo BBQ. My friend took a wrong turn on the way to Firefly and we ended up in Chinatown and she took me here saying it was decent. The bitch lied.   Walking in my appetite was immediately turned off with the hanging poultry and pigs in the entrance, but we carried on because we had a limited amount of time to eat with very limited options around. The place was dead which should have been a sign, but we got seated immediately but the decor was very.... off. I felt like I was in the 90's, maybe late 80's with the outdated surroundings. They did have hot tea that was waiting for us which was nice on the cold day, but this was essentially the only luxury we would be afforded.   Not much to be had for the vegetarian set, but I got some mixed vegetable fried rice for $9 freakin' dollars. Granted it was on a huge plate, but I expected a mountain of vegetables with my rice. I could hardly find any damn vegetables in the entire thing. Not okay. My friend got a pork fried rice dish which she said was okay, but that was $9 as well. Two people eating just fried rice with a bill of $18. A bill of $18 which could only be paid with cash as we found out. And you know where the closest ATM is? All the way back in the Chinatown mall. It took my friend 5 minutes to run out and run back in. This had to be a joke, or maybe a conspiracy with the ATM people. We left a $20 bill and got the hell out of there, the service did not even try to exceed minimum expectactions.  I was thinking about giving this place two stars because we did get seated quickly and the food didn't completely suck, but the experience sucked enough that I know I will never come back and there was no way in hell a very simplistic plate of VEGETABLES AND RICE costs $9. Also, they really should have decent signs or tell you BEFORE you sit down and order that it is cash only, something I have not heard in about a decade or so. And then on the way to class, my stomach was NOT happy. 1 star for you, you time-warped cash-only poultry-hanging freaks.",

She lives in San Francisco, and my parents were very skeptical about her excitement about this fabulous duck that she begged them to fly back with on their recent visit. (They refused.)  The Husband and I wanted to see if it was all quacked up as she said it was supposed to be.    Mission: Roast duck to go.  We did the quick take out side, although a peek at the menu definitely reflects that it's a better deal to take out if you can.  $12 for half a roast duck $19 for whole roast duck  It was pretty easy to go for the whole duck.  We also ordered a couple of boxes of steamed rice as well so we could eat on the run.  It was good - but then again, we haven't had any other roast duck in Vegas and it's been a long time since we've had roast duck in general.  Sure, I've had fattier ducks though than what Sam Woo offered, but there was definitely a good flavor in there.  The skin is the best part, but they could definitely have more meat on them.  We ate half last night and the other half tonight.  We think we got a pretty good deal on the duck and we were satisfied with that.  I spent some time living in SoCal, so I've had a few visits to Sam Woo BBQ there.  It definitely has me looking for other places that serve up roast duck though.  Cash only on the take out side.",

I would not recommend this place if you've been to Sam Woo in LA (lots betta') or if you truly have had good duck over rice recently. It'll put this place to shame. Service was as bad as the poorly roasted duck. I don't know how many times the waiter kept pestering us to see if we were finished eating yet. Seriously, try elsewhere in LV.",

You can't go wrong with a fast and affordable meal.. not to mention familiar. Not to die for, but if you have the craving it's worth the taxi fare. Haha.",

The waiter didn't even ask if we were done with our food and took away our meal when I wasn't even done with it.  I find that it is very rude of the waiter to not even ask if we were done with our meal before taking it away.  I would never come back and would definitely not refer my friend to this restaurant.

    "text": "Sam Woo, my favorite Chinese BBQ restaurant in the San Gabriel Valley.  Where else can I go for some good Cha Siu (BBQ Pork), Si Yuo Ji (Soy Sauce Chicken), etc.  So when I saw the LV location when we're driving around looking for a place to eat, I was definitely interested.  Going in, it looked the same as the LA locations, as is the \"Cash Only\" sign.  Being an expert of Chinese food in the SGV (Most are cash only) and being in Vegas, my friends and I carried plenty of cash.  We ordered a few dishes: Ping Pan (A mix of a few different BBQ), Lo Mein, Fried Rice, and a few stir-fry dishes.  The food was OK, I mean pretty much tasted the same as the ones in LA, so I had no complaints.  My only complaint was why did they jack up the prices by $2-3/per dish??  I mean in Vegas, the real estate is cheaper than LA, so are the gas prices, what's the need for a Lo Mein dish being $9?  Then, I remembered the Banana Cream Pie I had at Emril's in MGM being $9, so I guess this was a steal!  If you're sick of Buffets and in the mood for Chinese food, this is a decent location.",

We didn't wanted to go to Mandalay Bay which charges $25 for a Seafood Jook as compared to $4 in SF Chinatown.  So we picked the next best thing...in LV Chinatown and came about Sam Woo.    We ordered  a Fish Porridge which still had a strong fishy smell and taste, (usually removed with ginger) and the porridge was extremely watered down. We also order the \"Sam See\" chow mein (Duck; Chicken; and BBQ Pork)  It was ok, but tasteless...probably by the extreme amount of water sprouts!  Somehow, when we got back to the hotel that night, our stomach wasn't feeling too good.",

My hubby and I are new Vegas residents, and we ventured into Chinatown hoping to satisfy our craving for good Chinese food.  We stumbled into Sam Woo, figuring it was a good bet since we knew Sam's in the Valley was the favorite restaurant of one of our friends.  WELL.   Strike ONE = the \"hostess\" didn't bother to get off her cell phone call when we walked in.  She handed us 2 menus and pointed to a table.  Yeah, didn't even walk us over.  Just chatted away while we seated ourselves. Strike TWO = the \"server\" wasn't friendly or anything.  I guess he was upset that we were making him do his JOB.  Of course the language barrier was no help either.  When he came over to our table, he didn't say hi, just \"what you want order\"?  WTF?  He slammed the tea pot on the table and spilled it.  What an A-hole. Strike THREE = the \"food\" sucked.  We ordered the BBQ Pork lo mein and the BBQ Pork fried rice.  The lo mein noodles smelled like FISH.  EWWW.  The fried rice was BLAND.  No amount of soy sauce could help it out.  NASTY.  The prices were ok, IF this had been a restaurant worth the money, about $8 per plate.  But since it ISN'T, $8 was too much to pay.   And, they only accept CASH - wanna roll into the 21st century like the rest of the world?    I will NEVER go here again.",

I think the foodie invasion of Chinatown possibly ruined Sam Woo's reputation, but I had a great visit recently. I have fond memories of whole roasted pig and duck on holidays like New Years from here and they are delicious memories.  My best friend works graveyard and we aren't into The typical American style breakfast or Brunch all the time. We do however crave pork for breakfast. You can't put a time on crispy pork belly!   Anyways after deciding on Sam Woo over Chinese BBQ on Jones because Sam Woo takes cards we arrived right at opening around 10am. We were the only customers dining in and it was super cold.  I don't have much to say about the service but the food was great. We ordered fried intestines, roasted duck, crispy pan fried noodles, and crispy roasted pork. Man the food was great. The meat on the pork was so fatty and the skin was perfectly crisp and rendered. The duck had an awesome flavor and was cooked just perfect.  We had the restaurant to ourselves the whole time and enjoyed our food immensely. My only complaint at the restaurant was the cleanliness. Our table and silverware were clean, but the window I sat by had so much dirt and rice and old stuff on the bottom I just couldn't NOT mention it. It was like the bottom frame.  Anyways I did check out the reviews before I went in, but at the end of the day the food we ordered that day was just delicious.   So do check them out, don't sit by a window, and don't expect western style service and you will enjoy your food as well.",

Well, none of that happened.   Apparently everyone's gut decided to speak up and send many to this restaurant, so it was packed and must be good! The place easily sat 50+ people but the place was staffed by 2.5 waiters (includes the host), so the service was bound to be slow. The staff wasn't very attentive, which made me heavily regret not going to a buffet and the plates of food I could have already stuffed my face with while waiting to order. Food is moderately priced, but what should be the focus here is seasoning in moderation because the saltiness of the general atmosphere there must have began to infiltrated their dishes.  The familiar ring of the words \"Sam Woo\" had too much influence and expectation centered around it, so it's honestly a bit of a tourist trap. Skip this line, get into that buffet line, and live it up while you're out here!",

    "text": "(2/22/2019)  Came in for a late dinner with a family group of 13 travelling from LA.  We were pretty tired and hungry.  Ordered a dish each, it's not exactly like the usual family-style.  The concept is like Hong Kong butcher stalls/noodle shops, but the styling is definitively American.  Portions are enormous, way more than for 1 person, but it's not exactly a sharing environment.  Tried the 3-Flavor Chow Mein, a mix of three of their meat specialties, roasted duck, roasted chicken, and char siu, on pan-fried noodles; Seafood Chow Mein, a mix of bay scallops, squid, and shrimp on soft noodles, and Beef Stew Noodle Soup.  Good wok hay on the stir-fried dishes, but they were incredibly salty, and seriously over-sauced.  This is probably part of the American-style preparation, where people expect a lot of sauce on their noodles, like a plate of spaghetti.  The beef brisket in the noodle soup was pretty tender, broth was lacking on beefy flavor, lightly scented with star anise, soup noodles sufficiently springy.  Service was mostly attentive to the UNLV basketball game on TV, but came over when hailed.  Probably the best Chinese BBQ you'll find in Las Vegas (it's at the Chinatown Plaza).",

We ordered a noodle dish and a rice dish. Large portions  (or similar to that of other Sam Woo establishments) but a little pricer that usual - perhaps because it's the only Sam Woo in Vegas?  My total came out to be $23.   Overall, I didn't have too much of a expectation - I left a happy camper with a full tummy!",

    "text": "The Sam Woo name has strong reputation in Southern California, so it was a no brainer to stop by in Vegas for a good hearty Chinese meal.  Upon arrival you're greeted with a wall splattered with awards and top rating Zagat reviews.  But a closer look at reveal dates from the early 2000s.  I should've known this was a precursor of what's to come.  We arrived after the lunch hour and the restaurant was not full.  There was one waitress serving about 5 tables and a busboy cleaning up.  No one greeted us for nearly five minutes. Finally the busboy waved at us over to a table. After we sat, he notified the waitress of our arrival.  The waitress didn't even look over but rather continued over to the wait station to grab plates and utensils to set a table that was just cleaned up.  It was the busboy who grabbed some menus and brought them over and gave an apologetic smile. Behind the cash register the owner was busy with a personal call on her cellphone.  Meanwhile another family stood waiting to be seated for next several minutes.  When it was time to place our order,  it was again our heroic busboy who grabbed the waitress' attention.  We ordered a combo BBQ pork, roast duck, chicken rice plate, wonton noodles and chicken porridge. The BBQ meat was bland and chewy as noted by other Yelpers.  The BBQ chicken and duck were all the boney parts with little meat. The porridge had great texture but unfortunately tasteless. The wonton noodle soup was nasty as hell as the broth tasted like a mixture of the daily soup base mixed with msg from instant wonton noodle packages.  This place was probably the best Chinese food in town 15 years ago, but it's obvious now the restaurant relies solely on past reputation to stay in business.  Negative stars for the business but 5 stars to the heroic busboy.",

Granted, this is a Sam Woo and they generally serve decent Hong Kong BBQ along with other Chinese dishes. This location is not as good as the ones in So Cal, but not bad overall for Vegas. Can't go wrong with staples like the roast duck, sauteed ong choy, steamed chicken, etc.  This place will work for those wanting some traditional Chinese cuisine while in Vegas.",

The food was pretty good, especially the Mongolian Beef. That was the best! The worst had to be the soup as it was very bland and had absolutely no flavor at all. The service was alright as we got our food quick and everything we needed. However, there was no water and we got tea instead which was kind of sad ;(. Overall the place is ok for casual dining and such. Not highly recommended but, still an ok place for quick Classic Chinese food. :)",

They told me it would be $3 more if I wanted the same seafood as seafood and fried noodles. I decided not to order at that point but they wouldn't accept that answer and I had 2 people around my table going over the menu offering suggestions that had nothing to do with what I wanted.  I finally settled for the bland and tasteless wonton noodle soup just to get then to leave me alone. No water served ever and you get tea whether you want it or not.

Food:  Had the (a) combo BBQ pork and roast duck and (b) Chinese watercress as a veggie for about $30 total after tax but before tip. The roast duck was very good, very crispy. The pork was pretty tender, but could have benefited from soy sauce on the side. (Pictures below)  Service:  Food aside, the following part of this review is for the restaurant owners themselves: you need to train your Asian workers to treat the Latino busboys better. I may have gone at a dead hour (1:30/2pm on a Monday), but the person I saw working the hardest was the Latino busboy. The guy, whose name I found out to be Louis or maybe Louie because people shouted at him so often, busted his butt taking orders at 6 tables (by my count) and went back and forth between the front and back of house duties.  As someone who worked in immigrant rights, I understand (but am ashamed by) the uneasy tension between various immigrant groups. In any case, I always try and support immigrant businesses in every city I visit. During today's visit, it was very appalling to watch an Asian immigrant female restaurant worker push Louie/Louis as he backed up into her as he waited on a table. A simple \"excuse me\" or \"behind\" (in restaurant parlance) is not hard to say. Teach your workers kindness!  (FWIW, I tipped 30 percent, hoping Louie/Louis will receive most of that tip)",

Mapo Tofu had no flavor, tasted like thick, bland soup. Seafood Hot Pot wasn't too awful but still plain. Ong Choy also lacked flavor even though there was garlic in it, might as well have been without because you literally couldn't taste it. Honestly, don't even get me started about the Orange Chicken. I ordered it as the \"safe\" entree as in how could anyone mess up orange chicken?! But when it came out, it looked nothing like orange chicken and didn't taste anything like it, it was chicken bits drenched in a pool of a dark brownish almost black sauce that made me think it was sweet and sour, (emphasis on the sour), nothing like orange chicken that you get from anywhere else!

Yeah, I can see the service being not stellar but I'll be honest, this is pretty typical for a lot of Chinese restaurants run by Chinese. You'll probably fare better if you can speak the language, and since I do I can't say how it would be if I didn't.  Our waiter wasn't like exceptionally friendly or anything but he didn't scowl or was rude; just doin' his job, really. We ordered their specialty meats and Hong Kong style wonton noodle soup--excellent. Perhaps some people might find it too greasy, but I thought it tasted excellent. Especially when it's 9:30pm and you've been driving all day and you're tired + hungry.  I will say it is on the pricy side compared most restaurants like this; but hey, at least for me the food was worth it. Didn't have to wait long either, though I did got well after most dinner hours.",

I ordered the char siu and the roasted duck, nothing was very memorable and the price was just too expensive for the amount I received.  After paying and picking up my bag, I was surprised how light it felt for the amount I paid.    If you think I'm being \"chang\" (i.e. cheap), be my guest, go there and check it out yourself!   Now onto the food.  One question, where is the flavor?    One bite into the duck, nothing...just meat and fatty skin and the sauce over the duck, but no flavor within the meat.  Usually roasted duck should have a smokey flavor to it, this duck lacked it!    Char siu (BBQ pork) was ok. Again, not much flavor and usually char siu has a real distinct flavor.    All I can say is I am still on my quest to find the best Asian BBQ place in town!",

Our server didn't hardly come over to check on us or ask if we wanted any refills at all. But later on a very nice lady that happen to be working in the front, checked on us by the time we was ready to pay the bill. Also when we first came in, it took awhile for someone to come seat us. Also when the server came to get our drink order, I ask for ice water but he gave me ice tea instead. Other than that, the food was delicious and the lady that came to our table that was working in the front, was very nice. I do recommend this place though, not bad pricing either. Me and my friend order a few dishes, and we had like our own feast, we split each dish. Then we each split the bill, wasn't alot of money. Last thing I recommend, is the restaurant should have silverware on the table, not just the Tia sticks cause not everyone knows how to use those.",

As you step in the restaurant, you are surprised with the roasted pig and chicken hanging behind the glass wall.   I came here with my family. We were seated in one of the large tables and right next to us was another family. It was practically just two parties in this restaurant, cramped next to each other. I was unsure why they didn't seat us separately so we would have more room.   We ordered honey walnut shrimp, Mongolian beef, house fried rice, wonton soup, noodle soup, roasted pig, and flounder fish. (very typical dishes)  Fried rice and flounder fish was okay. The honey walnut shrimp and Mongolian beef was nothing I've ever tasted before. It tasted very different. I expected it to be the same taste with what you would usually get from a Chinese restaurant. But these dishes were so off.  The only thing I liked was the roasted pig which is filled so much cholesterol!   Cash only!!",

Reminds me of Taiwan's salt and pepper pork chops, but, of course, nothing compares to Taiwan's salt and pepper pork chops. $11  CHAO XIAO with RICE (3/5);  Unfortunately, the Sam Woo here does not compare to how we do it in Los Angeles.  The chao xiao was super lean and tough, but it was sliced nice and thin.  I think it would've been even better with a side of sour veggies or veggies.  The rice was mushy-- kinda like eating porridge.  $9  SERVICE:  The owners (the son, daughter and mother) are super nice, but the other wait staff are hasty and give the same fast, no-smile service as you would expect from a Chinese restaurant.  I'm not hating though-- haha, I totally knew what to expect, so it's okay.  WAIT:  It was fast.  We waited about 15 minutes and got to our booth.",

Isn't it almost a norm in restaurant to serve water to the guests whether they ask for it or not?  My friend wanted to order a tofu fried rice. Its not on the menu but since he saw they have some tofu dishes, he thought he could order it. We've been eating out together for years, and everytime he ask for it usually theres no problem. Instead, the waitress look at him like he's dumb and said \"I'm sorry we don't have that on the menu. But I could ask the cook to make veggie fried rice if you want.\" Well why can't you ask the cook to make tofu fried rice? Both are not on the menu! Whats so different between those two? He ended up getting fried rice with egg only. He asked for a fried egg on top of the fried rice and again, the server said he CAN'T. The eggs are blended into the fried rice. Really.. what's the difference?? At this point my friend was pissed off, so he agreed to anything.  Check came out with gratuity included and original tab with chinese writings on it and no english at all. Since none of us read hanzi, we asked a waitress to translate it, which she did, but she saw one of the dish has wrong price (it was written $9.50 instead of $13.50) so she took the tab without saying anything, added $4 to the total price, gave it back to us, and left. Wow. Just... wow.  Terrible service. Food is not even that good either. There are tons eateries throughout this area that offer better service and better food. Find those places.. SKIP this one.",

The food did get cold really fast, because it was not piping hot when it came out, but that's not really a huge deal.  The biggest issue was just the service, I guess. Not rude, just more of a \"I don't really give a crap\" attitude. My guy was actually more upset about it than I was! But If you are really not bothered by just average, whatever kind of service, then stop in. The food makes it worth putting up with, for the most part.

I ordered the cod with tomato Sauce and he ordered the duck and pork bbq lunch special. When we got our  plates we both looked at each other with disbelief. The kiddie size cod portion with pile of rice, an egg role, and soup were all squished  on the plate as though it was just thrown together. The sauce tasted like sweet and sour rather than tomato sauce so I asked the waiter and he said it was the same thing. His duck portion looked like 1 small piece(small drumstick size) cut into small slices. Same with the pork. So small u could spoon up the slices in a spoon and eat it in one bite. The taste was just as worse as the appearance. Both  duck and pork were dry. It looks as though they just served the left overs. The egg drop soup salty. The bill was $19.36 for both. Such a waste of money. We just wanted a great meal before our long drive home. Instead we left feeling like we got conned and ripped off. NEVER will I ever step foot in that place! Oh, and before we even ordered the table next to us complained about a hair in their food. To make up for it we went to Thai noodle house across the street! Awesome food and geat prices!!",

WTF we told them that they definitely did not deserve 15% and how dare they expect it. We were a table for 2. It's not like we were a group of 8 or more where they like to tack on an automatic 15% or what not. All I remember was how pissed my BF and I were vowing we WILL NEVER COME BACK TO THIS SHADY place!!!",

    "text": "We heard great things about this restaurant (elsewhere than yelp) so we decided to check it out.  We should have turned the other way when we saw the filthy walls behind the BBQ butcher area but the menu sounded good and figured the portions would be huge.  We were sat and ordered the BBQ duck/pork combination and a plate of sweet and sour chicken. The food came out almost too soon and in super tiny portions (I'm suspicious they gave us the leftovers of someone else's order). The pork was dry and no better than the usual stuff you get on the side at every chinese restaurant. The duck was the most depressing part of the meal: almost all bone and skin on a tiny plate. The chicken wasn't as flavorful as I was hoping. All of it was mediocre at best. My boyfriend ate most of it because he was starving but I just nibbled at the food. We will not be coming back here.  After being totally disappointed and wanting to get out of there as quickly as possible we looked at the bill and they had charged us for the rice that came with our meal without even asking us if we wanted it. What chinese restaurant charges you for rice with sweet and sour chicken? They took it off the bill, literally pulled the rice off our table and brought it back to the kitchen (probably to serve to another guest).   Our bill was $28 and the food was just enough to feed one person. My boyfriend is already getting hungry again and it's been about an hour since we left. My boyfriend suspects racial bias was the culprit here.  The plates being served to all the asian guests looked better and bigger than ours did. I think we got the worst part of the duck as well.  All in all I wish we would have gone to Ichiza down the street. :-/",

Max  We sat down didn't get any service..finally after 10 min we received water, and we order. food came out pretty fast.   It was OK! we ordered usual dishes chicken/broccoli, beef chow mein, and some other noddles. They are very cheap with their meats. I felt I was caveman I had kill for a piece of meat.

First off this place is dirty as hell, the food was horrible, maybe because i have been spoiled by the best Chinese food the San Gabriel valley has to offer. I ordered the duck noodle soup and the soup did not taste good at all and to top it off it was really expensive. bill came out to 50$ for 4 people which is only about 30$ when your eatting in California.   Don't waste your time here........... it is better to drive 4 hours back to California and eat at the SAM woo there.",

The staff leaves much to be desired - hosts seem to always be in a pissy mood, wait staff is not much better. My chinese isn't that good, but I can hear them talking to each other using crude language - not so cool in a restaurant w/ patrons around. oh well....typical of many casual chinese dining places. The place needs a good clean up.   I got the roast duck and roast pork on rice. Simple dish...cost $9??? a bit pricey...but what are you going to do in Vegas. Back in Boston this dish would cost $7 and taste a lot better. There was more roast pork than duck. Duck was ok, roast pork was a little on the sweet side. and the sauce that is one of the best parts of the dish was off/odd. I left more than half the rice on the plate.   I think I'll go to other places from now on.",

I have to admit i really liked the sauce but my mother didint even believe it was chicken. Even after we left she said no way it was chicken. It was nasty and tasted like nothing and looked raw. We also ordered the chow mein pork and chicken....the chicken was the same and the pork...no one could even eat it..it tasted nasty. Me and my mom ended up eating the rice with hot sauce because we could not eat any of the dishes. They never asked if we wanted anything to drink. The served tea at the start which almost made me throw up because it tasted like hot water. I will say that my mom thought it was okay. She drank almost all of it. My dad was mad that he had to pay so much. It was 60 dollars for 3 plates. the last plate was chicken and mushrooms..no one even touched that. The mushrooms were hard to chew and weird tasting and the sauce was gross. My dad did not eat anything and when we left he went straight to the chinese grocery store to buy some mangos because he was starving. My mom left hungry and she felt sick all day. Never going back and telling everyone how bad this place is. I've tasted some nasty stuff but i have never had such bad food.",

It used to be hard getting away from those all you can eat buffets in the hotels, but now that there is a small chinatown away from the main strip-- it is easier to find other dining options esp. if you're in the mood for some asian eats.   Sam Woo has been around for awhile and they have many locations all around SoCal as well.  Decent quick dishes for reasonable prices in pricey Vega$.  Not the best we've had, but they always seem busy.  Lots of other choices in this Asian plaza with the Ranch 99 market.  This is the 1st place I ate at while exploring this area. Rice plates, noodles(chow mein/fun), take out(siu yea) are all available.  **cash only place$",

Everything is double from the price at L.A but the quality is ten times worse than any Sam Woo or equivalent at L.A.  The lunch special char siu with rice was a joke. It tasted and looked like the char siu from Manchus Wok or Chinatown Express with red/purple dye penetrated down into the interior of the pork . The color of the interior was dark instead of white that a good char siu pork supposed to be. I feel sorry for the local Chinese who have to come to this place to satisfy their need for comfort food. Honestly the quality of this place cannot survive in bay area or southern California at any moment. Whoever doing the cooking in kitchen must be those unwanted from California who have to make its way to Vegas to make ends meet.",

It's just not the same anymore. I hate to say this but I think MGM's Grand Wok is a lot better than this place. Not only that...........the prices are comparable to casino restaurants.

Initially we were planning to eat at Ichiza, in the next complex, but because they had a long wait and we had a show (O at the Bellagio) to go too, we thought Sam Woo is a safe bet. I had good memories of Sam Woo from a few years ago, and I've also been to other locations in LA.  So they messed up our combo BBQ order.  We ordered the triple combo: bbq pork, roask pork, and soy sauce chicken.  But when it came we got roast duck instead of bbq pork.  So we sent it back, and it took forever for the waiter to come back with our 2nd plate. And it was STILL WRONG!!! this time they changed the duck to the steamed chicken!! DId they not understand English??  Anyways we were not happy but decided to leave it alone and just ate since we were hungry and didn't have much time to spare. But even if we wanted to complain it would be hard to call back the waiter because the waiter dropped the plate without looking at us, almost like avoiding us and walked away instantly.   We also ordered a bowl of wonton soup which I had high expectation for - and it was just blaaah.. I found 2 big bones inside the wonton.  Couldn't really taste much shrimp in the wonton as I like it.  The third item we ordered was Yang Chow fried rice and they messed this one as well!  It was so dry my husband commented that even the free fried rice you get at chinese fast food place is better.  The last dish was Braised Tofu (Hong Shao To Fu) and it was okay.  Everything is overpriced!  Those 4 items cost us almost $50.  We left the place so unsatisfied and angry, what a waste of space in our stomach!   Oh and the front hostess who showed us our tables was also so unfriendly. Stay away from this place!!",

    "text": "Avoid this place at all costs. I do not care if you read that it was one of the ten best Chinese restaurants in Las Vegas. Whoever wrote all those reviews in any of the restaurant review magazines, websites, and articles giving this restaurant a positive light should be shot. Twice.  I decided to use the 10best website to find myself an interesting place to eat, and discovered that my favorite one--Joyful--was number 10. Thinking that their taste was opposite of mine, I chose their number 9 spot-Sam's BBQ-and headed to Spring Mountain Rd. and Arville to try it out. First, Chinatown has horrible parking, so I circled for five minutes before stealing a space from some pissed off old man. After that, I walked into the restaurant, not impressed at all by the scenery.  As you walk in, there is a barbecue to-go station right in front of you. A small entryway to the overcrowded (fire inspectors should check this place out for safety) dining area. The hostess was not there, and it took us another five minutes to be recognized to be seated. Their menus felt greasy, only indicating how clean the place would be. I was worried the minute that I touched the menus about my food, but I was a trooper and pressed on.  Since this place is a barbecue place, we ordered bbq pork (you know, the one with that red outer coating), honey walnut shrimp, and house special chow mein. The waiter rushed us to order, stood there with an irritated look when we tried to change our minds, and finally--and literally--ran off after closing the ordering with a rude \"yeah\". The food took about eight minutes, and the table next to us returned a bowl of soup after discovering dead flies (yes, SEVERAL) in her bowl. In the end, she still had to pay for it, mind you.  We receive our dishes and steamed rice that I was hesitant to eat. I've seen too many incidences whre rice is recycled from one table to another, but I had a bit because I could not have my walnut shrimp without it.  In short--for Chinese people who run this place, I believe they were raised in hicktown USA. They do not make good or even decent food. I am one to eat what I buy, but in this case, I couldn't torture myself any longer.  To be nice, I'll leave out the gorey details and state that it was the worst Chinese food I ever had in my lifetime.  Do not expose yourself to this place. You will definitely have food poisining, as was the case this morning for me.",

Everything else was literally bland...Instead of Beef noodles, they gave us seafood noodles that arrived after everyone else finished their dishes, and me just sitting there waiting to eat! I didn't bother telling them they made a mistake, it wasn't worth it at all..  The Fried Rice lacked seafood, making it mostly bland rice.   Soup was bland also but the flavor of the roast duck definitely helped spice up the soup a lot.  I think you got the point of this review... BLAND ALL THE WAY!  Why is this place so packed? Is this really the best chinese food that Vegas has to offer that everyone comes here and forms lines in front of this place??

    "text": "Since we were in Las Vegas we decided to take a gamble on Sam Woo BBQ Restaurant.  Well, we tossed the dice and lost big time!   To describe the service as horrible really does a disservice to the word \"horrible\".  The staff were like a bunch of zombies from a low budget Chinese action movie -- when I asked for chili sauce, you would think I had asked the women at the counter to give me her first born child.  She just stared at me, and when I asked again she said, \"I already heard you\".    I would describe the ambience and vibe of the restaurant as \"post Hiroshima\".  It was like what would be left over after some horrible. unspeakable disaster. Though the food was bland and anything but fresh, they served it up in incredibly small portions, like we were prisoners in a World War II Japanese death camp.   I would recommend Sam Woo BBQ Restaurant if maybe your car died in front of the restaurant and you could not go anywhere else.  Or perhaps if there was a terrible lightening storm and you had nowhere else to hide.  In other words, if you are hungry, please consider biting off and eating your own arm before you dine here.",

It's too bad the soup broth ruined the otherwise decent noodle soup.  The mongolian beef is actually good.  They're huge pieces though so you'll need their dull butter knives to help you cut the beef.  Doh!  Forget it.  Just gnaw on it until the beef breaks off.",

    "text": "We visited over Memorial weekend wanting something quick after arriving.   This place was good 4-5 years back. I hesitated this time because last year I had a bad experience but thought it may have just been a fluke, but after this weekend there is no question we CANNOT come back to this place. It was awful.   They sat us at a table which had a dirty order ticket on it. This thing was nasty, had what looked like dried meat juices from what must have spilled from another dish.  The place was actually quite slow, about 4 tables in total.   After we were seated tea actually arrived promptly.  We waited about 10 minutes and wanted to order. I tried to flag a server who, even after making eye contact and turning his head towards me as I said, \"Excuse me\", completely ignored me and went to another table. I finally walked up to the cashier and asked the hostess if we could order. She brought over the very waiter who ignored us.  Our order: 4 won-ton noodles and a plate of garlic bok choy. BAD!!!  The broth was bland and the won-ton had what tasted like nothing more than left over pieces of roast pork as a filling. No shrimp or minced pork or mushroom. Every other won-ton I have eaten consisted of a filling of shrimp and pork minced together. The bok choy was actually okay. Total.... $49.00 + tip.  I should have listened to my intuition when we first pulled up.  Funny enough when the hostess brought our bill she apologized for the dirty ticket they used. Why did they even use it in the first place?!?! That gross, dirty ticket was the first thing we saw when we sat down.   We were disappointed.  Service... poor.  Food... almost as bad as the service.  Price ... way over priced  How do they stay in business?  For our next meal we landed up the street at KJ Kitchen which is only about 5 blocks away on Spring Mtn. Much, Much better. The Vietnamese Restaurant next door to Sam Woo was actually pretty good as well.   Do yourself a favor, save your time, appetite and money by avoiding Sam Woo BBQ.",

But this POS place that serves not only mediocre chinese food, but stale, sometimes inedible crap on a plate, put on top of that some of the most rude waiters in Vegas and you have a recipe for disaster.  I got what I usually get from Sam Woo, which is the three delicacies plate.  This is what Sam Woo is known for, and yet these guys somehow screw this up, and they charge about 50% more than their other stores.  I mean come on?  What's up with the standards of this place.  I wish they get they're act together, because their is nothing better than some chinese BBQ from Sam Woo.",

    "text": "Feeling like some authentic Chinese food during my last trip to Vegas, we decided to head over to Chinatown and try out the food at Sam Woo.  My family had been here before and said that the food was good, especially their BBQ sausage.  Unfortunately, our expectations for good Chinese food were not met.  We ended up getting a variety of dishes- the BBQ sausage, wonton soup, the house special HK-style fried noodle, the rock cod with tomato sauce, the beef with satay sauce, the beef tripe with black bean sauce, the lemon chicken, and lastly, the deep-fried crispy intestine.  Yes, I know, I am a big fan of offal.  Too bad Sam Woo had some intestines that were deep-fried to the point of becoming intestine-flavored potato chips...sounds gross, tasted worse.  All the other dishes weren't anything special- the sauces just weren't very tasty, especially the tomato sauce and lemon sauce.  Both of these sauces were gloppy and too sweet.  The satay sauce barely tasted of any satay.  The BBQ sausage tasted more of salty kielbasa than any authentic Chiu Chow-style sausage.  Overall, a huge disappointment.  The food was not good and they charged too much for the quality and amount of food you receive.  Service was pretty bad, even considering Chinese restaurant standards.  I definitely won't be back, especially considering the cornucopia of culinary delights Vegas has to offer.  And what's up with the cash only policy?",

    "text": "Wow a lot of bad experiences for people at this restaurant. It's not the greatest looking Sam Woo either. I've been to the one in Irvine and that was looked much classier. This just looks like your average Chinese restaurant.   My family and I got seated right away, and as soon as we sat down, one of the waiters casually chucked the tea kettle onto our table, stood there for a couple seconds, and walked away. My sister and I exchanged glances and laughed at how awkward that was. Minutes, later another waiter came by to take our order, and kindly gave us forks and glasses of water.   Now, I liked the food in Irvine's branch, so I expected the food to be just as good. However, the food was expensive also. Walnut pr0nz came out to 17 doll hairs, which is probably one of the most expensive pr0nz I've ordered. Seafood fried rice and shrimp chow fun came out to $10 each. We also ordered sauteed rock cod filet, which was about another $13. As you can tell, we only ordered seafood items. Yes I came here on a Friday and us Catholics are in the later stages of Lent.   Our food came out in a reasonable amount of time, one item after another. As I hoped, the food came out excellent and cooked just right. The gravy on the chow fun was the perfect amount without masking the taste of the noddles and shrimp. The seafood fried rice had a good mix of suqid, scallops, and shrimp in it, and the rock cod was stir-fried to perfection with the wine sauce. I liked the walnut pr0nz too, but there was way too much mayo coated around it. It was a little overwhelming to be honest, and it was the dish I was looking forward to the most. Sigh.   I had a good experience here with the food and service, which I suppose is rare based on what other Yelpers have said. I'd take my family here again, and hopefully I'll have just as good of an experience next time we go. Cash only. For a restaurant that charges a lot, they charge cash only. Come on!",

I also see that they have to go boxes for rice AND DUCK. I asked the guy if I could have duck wings and feet on the to go box. He said, in his broken English, they only sold whole, or half a duck. I asked how much was the whole duck because I couldn't see where the price was on top of the board. He just ignored me and turned around. Now I was in disbelief and that pissed me off.     Hate being ignored. Can't he cut up some effing duck feet and wings from the whole ducks? Shit if this place doesn't sell that, like he says, which is bullshit because they have the prices and boxes. Hes lazy ass just didn't want to take the time to make it. Mind you that place was open BEFORE the scheduled time of 11AM. But closed to customers. So what the hell was he doing before that he didn't have any already cut up?    Oh I know! He was just sitting on the table where you CUT THE DUCK reading a newspaper. Now that I write this down I am so glad I didn't get anything from here. After this I went to the 99 market and bought me some frozen ducks legs and I felt like going in and launching them shits at his face and saying, \"You don't have duck feet?\" \"Here!\" *throws them at him* \"Cook them shits up!\" If someone would have filmed me I would have done it. Asshole. Hope he chokes and dies like those ducks!",

But anyway when the chicken dish came, it's was so dry. There was no moisture in the meat. I told the waiter and he took it back. When he came back, I thought we would have gotten a new order. But no!! All they did was drizzle more soy sauce to the chicken!! Chicken is still dry as shit! On top of that the rice they charge us had a funky smell. Couldn't eat it.

The waiter just plopped the water pitcher down and quickly walked away.  After that, I was expecting the waiter to tell us that we needed to prepare our own food. Not once did a waiter or waitress ask if we needed more water, etc.  The only time our waiter forced an unconvincing smile on his face was when it was time to pay the bill.  On the plus side though, the food was pretty good. My family enjoyed the choi sum, chow fun with beef and the fried calamari.  It's too bad the horrible service outweighed the tasty food. Highly unlikely we'll ever dine here again on our next visit to Las Vegas.",

    "text": "EKKKKKK! Are You Kidding ME? This Sam Woo restaurant location is RIDICULOUS! Disgusting food for a ridiculous price! 90 DOLLARS for SIX DISHES!   Came here for lunch before leaving Vegas - and obviously not a good one at all.  We were a party of 6 adults and 2 children - we ordered 6 dishes:  House Steamed Chicken with the ginger onion dipping sauce - there were barely any meat on the chicken - quite frankly it was nearly all bones and skin.  Seafood Tofu Pot - this dish was okay   Soy Sauce Beef Chow Fun - it was like they pour oil all over it before serving it - it was very hard to eat when it's slipping off your fork/chopstick.  Beef Stew Lo Mein with Wontons - the noodles were disgusting! it was soggy and not to mention tasteless.   Duck Noodle Soup with Wontons - again the noodles were disgustingly soggy...wontons were bland and there was not much meat on the pieces of duck.  Chinese Broccoli sauteed with garlic - pretty greasy and it was definitely very aged broccoli   They also charge for rice - per bowl..  Normally at the Sam Woo back at home (San Gabriel, CA) ordering 6 dishes for lunch amounts to about 30 dollars - 40 dollars at most but here it was unbelievably 90 dollars!    The service was just as bad - it wasn't busy but had to ask several times for things plus one of the waitress openly and loudly complained about another table of diners that left - how they asked for utensils but didn't use them.  One last thing I have to say is - I can't believe this place is still in business!",

We were seated, a pot of tea literally thrown (it landed and slid) on our table, our order taken, order delivered by the same throw-slide......and that was the last time we saw anyone. Our waitress sat at the booth behind us, with another waitress swatting flies in the window with a swatter, and never even said a word when I made eye contact with her.  My Sam Woo Hot Pot was simply soy sauce, salt, and a variety of seafood, a few pieces of chicken, and a few of pork. The fish was like wet cardboard (I think it was fish?), the squid was just the body--no tentacles, and there were all of two shrimp.  It was hot, it was in a pot...that part did not lie. But it was not worth the $14.95.    The Mongolian beef, ordered extra spicy, had no spice and nothing except beef and scallions.  Want rice? That's extra.  $30 for just those two dishes and a bowl of rice.  Save your money (and the ATM fees).",

We ordered for half roast duck, sauteed watercress, seafood hotpot and salted fish and chicken fried rice. Our orders came in fast and they were all good except for the seafood hotpot which hubby said seemed to be mushy. Initially I thought since they are known for their bbq, they would have chicken bbq but it turned out that when they say bbq it only means \"pork bbq\". It was just disappointing though. Then when I asked the server if they have grilled chicken she seems to not know what a grilled chicken is so I just let it go but would have been nice if they have chicken bbq too. Overall it was a good foodie experience here in Sam Woo BBQ Restaurant. Maybe if we crave for roast duck we will come back again and try their other dishes as well.",

The minced beef on rice, nasty and wet like they drowned it in the sauce, which wasn't even that good.  Rice was dry and clumped a lot.  It was just a mess.  Service was surprisingly fast, making me assume it was warmed up in a microwave (because of the dry bits) or precooked.  Just seemed very sketchy, and wouldn't recommend.

They tend to have a bad attitude and are not very customer oriented.  Other than that: Food is okay. What you would expect from Sam Woo. Roasted BBQ like duck and pork is good. Other stuff is okay. Green onion beef is good. Tofu dishes are generally good as well. The fried chicken wing was meh. It just wasn't seasoned very well.

I've been here a couple times just because I wanted to make sure that they didn't just have a bad day, but I was wrong. I've never back since and will never plan to go there.  Let start my review of their BBQ side of the restaurant. I used to go here to buy BBQ duck or roast pork because they were the only one selling it. Their BBQ duck wasn't that good, but either that or driving to CA to get some. When you're threre, they treated you like #$%@ b/c it was crowded they didn't need you. Anyway, when King BBQ opened up a few block down the road, I didn't need SWBBQ either. KBBQ has much better roast duck and pork, definitely recommend it there. Now there are other places starting selling BBQ duck too, example would be the 168 market. Now let look at their restaurant side. We ordered a varieties of items on different trips there and all of them ranged from eehhh to mediocre. Most of the food were too oily.The floor and tables were dirty and the service was kinda suck. Summary, if you want Chinese BBQ, go to King BBQ down the road on Spring Mountain (and Lindell???)",

Wth?!?   The three dishes golden shrimp, garlic pork ribs and clams with xo sauce. The garlic shrimp was terrible! $20 for 10 pieces and they don't even get rid of the intestines! We fought to not be the one to eat it. The shrimps were so soggy and the shrimp were not very golden. The ribs were fried beyond redemption and were not marinated prior to frying. The only garlic in the dish were a little bit of minced pieces scattered on top of them extra crispy and dried ribs. The clams was the onlu edible dish and it was also only mediocre.   This place is a trap. They know customers would never come back so they charge insane prices to stay open.",

    "text": "Sam Woo is practically a household name in Southern California, much like Panda Express would be in most cities.  There are dozens of them all over Southern California, from Monterey Park to Orange County.  I used to go to the one in Irvine quite often, and loved that they had \"on-demand\" Peking Duck.  Most Chinese restaurants make you order it 24 hours ahead of time, but here you can get it whenever you want.  Some of the Sam Woo's are BBQ, some are seafood, but all of them serve traditional Hong Kong style Chinese food.    The Sam Woo in Las Vegas is a BBQ restaurant, which means they have the Peking Duck on-demand.  This is my favorite part about this Sam Woo. They also have a lot of other BBQ items, such as BBQ spare rib and Chickens.  These can be either bought at the sit-down restaurant, or at the counter at the front of the restaurant.    The restaurant is always pretty busy, but they handle the crowd well, and always have room for new tables.  I really enjoy their Hong Kong style crispy noodles, and their Honey Walnut Shrimp.  I also like the Pork Chop with Salt & Pepper.    The reason I give Sam Woo's in Las Vegas a 3-star review is because it does not live up to the hype of the southern California restaurants.  I have found that the one out here in Las Vegas is hit or miss, having had very mediocre food on several occasions, while also having the typical great Sam Woo cuisine on severl other occasions.  This is what left me at 3 stars.  If they were consistent, it would be a 4-5 star, but until I consistently get the Sam Woo quality, they will never earn the other stars.    This being said, I would suggest Sam Woo for anyone looking for great Peking Duck or Chinese BBQ.  There are not many other places in town that do it as well as them.",

We ordered the 2 item combo that had roasted duck and roasted pork, 3 Flavor chow mein, and Chinese broccoli.  The chow mein and broccoli came out pretty quick but then we waited for 15 min or longer but the duck and pork still had not arrived!  We saw another table get a big plate of duck too.  WTF?  We finally asked our waiter where our duck and pork is and he said \"Oh, we're out of duck and pork.  I'm sorry I forgot to tell you.\"  Are you fucking kidding me?  You \"forgot\" to tell us???  Then my friend asked \"Do you have duck?\"  The guy said no but then when we asked again, he said that they have duck.  OMG!  We got the plate, which is $9.20 for 2 pieces of duck.  There's 3 size servings for duck.  Whole, half, and plate.  When we got the bill, they charged us $14.95 for the 2 pieces of duck!  We didn't really question it at first and the paid.  As we walked out, I said \"Fuck that, there's not way that duck was $14.95!!!\" and I went back inside to look @ the menu.  They never took off the charge of the 2 item of duck and pork that we never got!!!!  They gave us the $6.25 that was due back to us.  Yeah, not going back here again.  Always scrutinize the bill when eating out and don't be afraid of questioning the bill if you see something wrong.",

Today's experience was just unacceptable.   A woman in her mid to late thirties helped us today. Not only did she get our order wrong, but she gradually got more and more rude. We ordered 2 steamed chicken and rice boxes to go. After a few minutes we also ordered  the soy sauce chicken and rice box to go. Both times she made me repeat myself like she didn't understand what I was saying. Mind you, I was speaking fluent Cantonese to her. When our order was ready, I was checking the bag for utensils when she rudely, excessively, and repeatedly told me spoons and forks are all in there in the span of 20 seconds. RUDE.   I walked out, checked the bags. Only 3 spoons. No forks. Walked back in. She still questioned me about there being forks in the bag. Is she some kind of utensil nazi? WTF. In my blind rage, I didn't even realize she only gave me 2 boxes of food. Where's the 3rd box? She gave me 3 spoons but only 2 boxes of food? I'm already 2 1/2 hours away. Not only did she give me  just  2 boxes of food, but the wrong items. 2 soy sauce chickens instead of steamed. Imagine my disappointment...",

It has all the making to be a nice spot to grab a quick bite... but the food isn't up to par.  We had a Tofu dish and a bbq meat dish.... everything was quite bland.  Their BBQ pork was the only saving grace.  As expected, service is crummy at best, cleanliness is questionable, and decor is... well... I don't know if you can call it decor.  Good location though... was able to get a Milk Tea right afterwards from the neighbor =)",

Srzly can't go wrong.   It was quite expensive here though - bill came out to be around $50 or so. I mean sure we ate for 3 MORE meals but.... AND it's cash only.

    "text": "My mom in disbelief wanted to buy BBQ take out from Sam woo because she thought this place was good,  just like the one in LA. We order roast duck, chicken  and BBQ pork.   BBQ pork was fresh when we got it, it came out fresh in front of our eyes.  The color and the char was there. But eating it was a disappointment because the nice piece of red BBQ pork was just food coloring and nothing else. We were fooled by the looks of the item. There was no taste to it, totally bland. Only color....   The chicken was over marinated by salt. The meat was rough. There was no possible way for my family to eat it because it was too salty. I know my mom would hate me if I threw the chicken out, so I suggested maybe we can make porridge out of it? I don't think the chicken porridge would taste any good either. But it's in the fridge. Maybe I'll throw it out tomorrow without letting her know?   Lastly, we had the roast duck. It actually wasn't bad. They had the duck right....  But hours later, I felt very thirsty, hinting that there was a lot of msg. It was weird cuz I haven't had msg over shock in a long time.   I'm not going back here again. Originally, I just wanted to prove my mom wrong about their food. Although I succeeded in proving my mom wrong about their food but I really shouldn't attempt the idea of letting her try this place out. It was a bad choice on my end.",

We ordered the wonton noodle soup, beef chow fun, house special chow mein, bean curd tofu, and shredded pork fried rice. And none of it was good.   The beef chow fun was greasy and bland. The chow mein was soaked in so much sauce that it could've been a soup. If I wanted the soup, I would have ordered it. The seafood that was on the chow mein was small, frozen, and overlooked. Not to mention it was so bland. Let's just say that everything we ordered was greasy, bland, and overall disappointing.   They also add the tip to your bill. So don't even bother tipping them on the table. Not like it's worth it anyway. Overall, a super disappointing and expensive meal. Never coming back again.",

I suppose with all of the other Asian restaurants in the area this one falls a bit short. It really is a shame though because it is in a good location right at the mall, but it may be past its prime.   I really hope that they are able to rejuvenate their restaurant and put forth something with more passion.

He was saying okay to every request, like waters and stuff, but I don't think he understood very well. Like we would ask \"does the food come with rice or is it separate?\" And he just kept continuously saying okay?????  When the food came, we asked for another bowl of duck sauce and he literally took a rice bowl and just poured it in there SUPER messy and got it all over the table. BUT the food ended up being super delicious and we finished our plates. The only thing is that service was terrible, and was basically the bare minimum.

Service is hit-or-miss due to language barriers but they try their best it seems. The food arrives in ample portions and as expected it tasted wonderful and authentic.   This is your typical Chinatown atmosphere, large families eating and having fun, lots of natural light coming through the windows and the awesome aroma of your order being prepared. I can only equate this experience to every other experience I've had at a Chinatown restaurant and its a positive experience that I wouldn't trade for the world.

We bought togo and ate in the car about half box. Two hours later, we ate again and the meat was still tender as the skin is still crispy. The quality of meat was so much better than the Sam Woo in CA. If we ever go to Vegas again, we will definitely come back and also try other food.",

Chinese restaurants have this reputation of mediocre customer service, dirty dinning, but delicious food. Sam Woo, however, has all the mentioned above PLUS TERRIBLE food.   FOOD - Ying Yang Fried Rice: half tomato & half cream based. The rice tasted old, the tomatoes were very limp and soggy, and the sauce was flavorless. We had to add salt to make it bearable to eat. 1/5 - Salt Pepper Shrimp: this dish over salted but there was a good crunch to it so I give it 3/5 - Fried Tofu: over fried and over cooked. I prefer a crunchy outside and soft tofu inside. The ginger dark (maybe soy?) sauce saved this dish. 2/5 - Beef Noodles: over cooked. The beef was tough and flavorless, the noodles were mushy, and the entire plate was dripping in oil. 1/5  SERVICE - Garbage. They were quick to seat us (party of 3), rushed us to order food (even though there were only 2-3 other tables occupied), and never checked on us or refilled our water/tea.   OVERALL: Don't recommend and I won't be returning. I am giving it 2/5 stars because they were quick with getting the food to us (15-20 minutes) and I didn't get food poisoning (yay).",

Sam Woo BBQ restaurant you can see roasted duck hanging right as you walk through the front door so that caught my attention and made me want to eat here.   Interior was very average nothing really eye catching or picture worthy. Our waiter service was very average somehow we ended up ordering our food before we ordered our drinks which was odd. Their menu selection was very large but it looks like a lot of their dishes were no longer available by them crossing the price out with a black marker , also a lot of the dishes have gone up in price.   The food was good , this was my first time trying duck and I enjoyed it! The meat was flavorful,skin was crispy. But they're is so many bones ! Lol. It was a good size for lunch. They also have roasted pork which I wanted to try but i forgot to order.    Well this restaurant isn't trendy at all ,and a long shot from being a foodie destination . This place is more family oriented like if you have older relatives this is the spot for them!",

    "text": "Hey!  Why all the 2 star reviews?  I am not sure what the deal is, but for a basic Chinese restaurant with a deli serving all the favorites like Soy Sauce Chicken, BBQ Pork, Salt Baked Chicken and Roasted Pork, I love to come here to buy Chinese Deli meat by the pound and the flavors are perfect.  So do I actually order food here?  I always order from the deli and will order even Beef Chow Fun to accompany all the meats I order.  However, I haven't ordered food to sit down and eat for awhile.  This is not what I would consider a real foodie type place.  This is your more basic Chinese American normal eats that you won't find at a Panda Express and also it won't be as fancy as all those new Asian type places popping up.  This is just good ole food for the soul.  If you are looking for a great ambiance, great service and etc, try somewhere else.  This is just your simple place to grab some good ole basic food that we grew up eating.  Try buying one of the soy sauce chickens or the Salt Baked chickens.  About 15-19.00 depending on the weight.  Excellent taste.",

Ordered light but sampled the roasted duck and found it flavorful and juicy.  Salt and Pepper Chicken wings I wasn't happy with the batter and the amount of salt applied.  Golden brown Vegetable egg roll with their house sauce was fried were super crispy.  Egg drop soup needs salt and frankly tasteless.  Menu had pen corrections to a massive menu.  Restaurant was clean but for some reason the menus where greasy and oily.  A nice pace from the strip to visit a location like Sam Woo. Going to have to try it again for their more famous known dishes.",

Just a quick summary of our experience last weekend, because it's not worth my time to go into much detail, is that the broth was devoid of flavor, my meal was cold, the roast duck hard. When I went up to the cashier counter to pay, I found out why. The dishes were being passed from the kitchen shelf to the messy counter and they just sat there for ages! Everything was dirty and unorganized. Way too many commendable Asian places to frequent--my advice is to stay away from this joint.",

How dare them call it house special when there's hardly anything on it but rice, shrimps & finely chopped up leftover pork bbq. Usually a house special fried rice has beef, various seafood, pork, veggies, eggs & sprinkled with green onions. The one they served me was tasteless!

We ordered the BBQ Combinations, Lemon Chicken, Fried Rice & Fried Beef Rice Noodles.  Have been here a couple of times, food is great and affordable. Comfortable atmosphere that resembles a typical Cantonese restaurant. There's even a selection of organs at the front counter you can choose dishes from.

One waiter did answer my inquiry by saying that they did not usually put a tip on the bill. Service charge in noodle houses, are you kidding?  I guess they saw an opportunity to rob tourists whenever they could.  Be careful! Food quality has been going downhill.  Service was hit & miss. Some of them talked more than they worked.

All you can taste is the saltiness of the food.  Prices are much more expensive than you can get from real Sam Woo's in the SG Valley.  Let's just say anywhere from 30-40% more and the portions are like almost 30-40% less.  There is an upcharge of $1 for rice.  Infants and toddlers are not exempt.  Most places are exempt or even kids under 4 eat free.  Guess this Sam Woo figure that a 2 year old and a 4 year old will eat lots of their crappy rice since their entrees have no flavor.  First time going here and will be last time.  The panda express at the Venetian tastes 10X better and costs 3X less.  OMG!  How can that be???...",

We ordered several dishes and most were served cold and tasted like, really prefer not to say it. I would encourage patrons who love chinese food to go to the Pin Pan Pon in the Gold Coast Casino.

We were right next door the other night for tea so didn't want to go  back to the same place, so we tried this place seeing there was a good amount of people in here compared to other places.  So sitting down, I ordered the Roasted Pork and Roast Duck combination. I these are 2 things I like to only eat once in awhile so I can truly enjoy the flavors. Our plates took a little longer than usual to come but it did.   When it did, it was a disappointment. The roasted pork was very dry, must had been stuff from the other day that they decided to reheat and sell. The roast duck was all bone, giving me all the lower sections of the duck where little or no meat is found.",

The food came in large amounts in huge dishes. Each plate had a similar boring taste. It was either sweet, salted, or overly filled with MSG. (maybe i exaggerated more then i needed).   after a long day of work and eatting with 12 people, everyone managed to stuff 2 bowls of rice with lots of water and food. personally i thought this restaurant was managed better then Cathay House on the same block. But the food was more expensive for the price and the amount served.",

The two kids and their parents came late, but we were clear with how many people were in our party. Still, the hostess gave us room for only 14 people. When the last family arrived, SHE got pissed at us. She also got indignant when we insisted on having the rest of our part occupy one of the empty booths; she wanted to seat other customers in there. Then, when the kids' parents ordered the roast duck for themselves, they were served a raw one instead. There was no denying it. The duck skin was still white!  NEVER NEVER NEVER AGAIN!",

And so were some of my girlfriend's friends that happened to be in Vegas the same weekend we were in Vegas.  So like any good motley crew of Chinese people, we decided that we would go try some Chinese food in Vegas.    Sam Woo is a great chain found around Southern California, so know the  food well.  However, instead of doing the traditional family style like good Chinese people would, we ordered individual plates of noodles and such.  One dish we got was zazang (black bean) noodles.  (See my previous review of Zazang Noodles in SF for a quick history of the noodle).  However, these people here serve zazang noodles HONG KONG style! WTF man!? Who DOES that??  Apparently the way to know if it's HK style is in the Chinese name.  HK people will call it Zazang Lo Mien, instead of the normal Zazang Mien.  Bunch of wierdos.  Girlfriend included, who is Cantonese and apparently likes the HK style. WTF woman?!  That's like blasphemy, since my familial roots (from my dad's side) is from San Tung, and we happen to be the ORIGINATORS of zazang noodles.  I never even knew that our very own Chinese brethren would bastardize my beloved noodles so much that I wouldn't even recognize them.  Even the Korean copycats actually copy the recipe pretty well.  Other than that dish, the noodles were good.  And since the gf liked the HK interpretation of San Tung's great noodle dish, I won't dock stars for that.  Four stars cuz the food is good.  But I'd also like to check out some of the other smaller restaurants in the plaza.",

To get the really good Chinese restaurants, you have to ask the Locals...  I will try to get the lowdown on that since I have a few friends that live there....

The fried noodles we ordered was basically blanched egg noodles with heavy starch gravy on top. Absolutely NOT acceptable in any Chinese restaurants, maybe it's acceptable in a mom and pop Chinese restaurant in the middle of nowhere. And for $12.95? Rip off.  Seriously, this place is a rip off, $7.95 for a bowl of won ton noodle which normally is $3.95 to $4.95. $8.95 to over $20 for normal Chinese dishes? Are you kidding me?  Place is not so clean consider the decor is decent.   The army hair cut waiter digs his nose while serving you the dish as if to add extra flavor to the tasteless dishes.  Save yourself time, money and aggravation, DO NOT go to Sam Woo in Las Vegas. And if you do because it looks attractive on the outside with the BBQ meats hanging, ask to see if the army hair cut waiter is working or not. Otherwise, extra 'black bean' in your dish.",

So I would like to think I know what quick, effecient, yet pleasant customer service means when it comes to dining experience.*  We were pretty much ignored and not acknowledge from the moment my family and I walked in. We chose this restaurant by random since we were hungry and wanted to be out of the heat. Though it looked quite busy, we were still able to get a seat within a few short minutes. However, I guess their servicing was slow since we weren't helped after they left their menus on our table. By the way, we were never acknowledge when we walked into the restaurant, so after a few minutes of standing there waiting to be sitted, we just chose an emoty table to sit at. Since no server came to our table asking us on our choive of drinks, we asked for water from a nearby worker who was wiping a table. He didn't even acknowledge the request because he continued to look down and wipe the table. We thought he just didn't hear us since it was quite loud in the restaurant. He came back with the requested water later though. Experience at this location was pretty much going down hill after not being acknowledge for that request. While waiting for a server to stop by our table so we could place our order, I decided to do a quick YELP research of this restaurant. Was quite surprised to see such low ratings and bad reviews on the food taste!! I was ready to order since the menu had pictures which looked delicious, but from so many reviews on YELP, I started to second guess it.   Since the experience was starting to go down hill and the reviews of this restaurant's taste is questionable, I informed my family of the reviews and after a quick decision, my family and I decided to leave. My mother was quite pissed at the lack of customer service already but still decided to be nice by leaving a $1 tip on our table since the worker who we thought ignored us when we requested water, still bothered to (however, not so nicely and solemly) place cups and a pitcher of water on our table.",

I got a receipt that was rounded to an even number and they just assumed the remaining change was going to tip. They did not ask if I wanted anything to drink. I ordered two different entrees and the entrees came 20 minutes apart. I don't even want to give them a star but I have to give them atleast 1 star.",

When we walked in the waiter gave us a dirty look,  We asked for drinks and he told us all they get is soft drinks.  We ordered 3 won ton noodle and one beef brisket noodle soup.  The soup was luke warm and the won ton was not even heat all the way through.  Tjhe beef brisket was very fatty in a bad way,  The soup had no taste,  When we were half way through our meal the waiter said they had to closed down the register and want us to pa right the wayy.  The other staff was all standing in the dining room and staring at us while we eat.  Overall, the food was bad and expensive for what it was and the service was horrible and they only take CASH.  Would not recommend anyone go there and waste their money.  It is too bad they carry Sam Woo's name and this might lead customers think they are all the same quality.  The ones in LA are much better in terms of food quality and serive.",

This place is located in the \"chinatown\" that's off Spring Mountain Road.  It's that street that's next to Treasure Island and  the Fashion Show mall.  It's away from the strip, so you'd need to take a taxi here.  The food is okay and typical of a Chinese restaurant.  I think they overcharge for many things here, but is a bargain compared to the 25 dollar fried rice you'd get at the Mirage's chinese restaurant.  I never come here when I'm with friends.  I think the place is okay if you want Chinese food when you're in Vegas, but if that's what you want, I need to ask you why would you want more Chinese food in Vegas when theres so much of it back home?!  I'd rather try something else.",

I don't mind paying premium prices for a good meal, but it's not that impressive.  The service is poor - the waitress botched our order and we had to reorder.  And they're slow, except for the bus boy hovering over you to take your plate the second you put down your fork.  I really cannot recommend this place.  If you visit China Town in Las Vegas, check some of the other Asian cuisine restaurants that aren't chains.  They've GOTTA be better than this!  Never again!",

I'm a pretty big noodle fan and, to me, Sam Woo has the best Lo Mein in Vegas.  I always order the lo mein with oyster sauce and I always leave satisfied.  A lot of people complain about the service here but I really don't mind the waiters and their 'tude.  I think it's a kind of entertaining but that's just me.  The only thing keeping me from giving them a 5-star stamp is the simple fact that they have a sign that says \"CASH ONLY\".  What year is this?  Get with the times people!  I never carry cash so I really have to plan ahead and remember to pull some out of the ATM before I get here.  Remember.. the noodles are key here.  Just make sure you bring cash or the Chinatown mafia will probably come in and make those same noodles come out of your nose.  Or worse.  Just kidding... I hope.",

I notice one napkin on top of the plate being served to me slightly lifted into the air when the waiter was putting it down, but one corner of it did not. I inspected my napkin to see what could be causing the corner to stick to the plate, well to my surprise it was a booger!! Disgusting! We left shortly after. We didn't even bother to stick around for our drinks to come. Between angry patrons and boogers on my plate, I'd rather try somewhere else.

Everything was just okay, nothing spectacular. About 1/4 of the BBQ pork slices had more fat than meat. The Chinese broccoli is just flavored with garlic and vegetable oil. The seafood in the hotpot wasn't the most fresh. My brother found a short strand of hair on his fish from the seafood hotpot, and when we showed it to waiter, he tried to deny that it was hair... if it wasn't hair, what else would it be? He took it back, and we decided to just cancel that plate order. I never really expected Chinese restaurants to be extremely clean, but denying the blatant appearance of a hair in the food was rather ridiculous.",

Beef chow fun was bland and the Hainan steamed chicken tasted like it was boiled until it lost flavor. The overall trend seems to be the low quality seasoning or just bad cooking for most dishes. Will likely not be back.",

We didn't order a much since it's just me and my husband. He ordered the usual favorite salted fish fried rice, fried shrimp and we had wonton noodle soup and Peking duck. Over all the food is not too bad, we just have to add some seasoning on our soup. It satisfied our craving for Chinese food.",

The place had only six tables occupied so it was not crazy busy  We waited for 15 minutes after we were seated .. and I had to ask if we could get some menus. When the food was served to us on a table for six. They kept just leaving all the dishes on one side of the table. And we had to pass it on . We had no space on  the table but the empty plates and the menus were not being picked up even though they kept passing by. They did not serve us water or ask if we wabted drinks till half way thru the meal we had to ask them for water. When done we had to ask them for take home boxes and the check.  So basically no one followed up. When we got the check . They charged us gratuity for 4 adults and 2 kids . Will not be going back to this place again. This place does not deserve a star. But to post I have to give it a star.",

The positives: + Food came out very fast.  We were very hungry, so this was a bonus. + Food was tasty.  We had: beef chow fun, kung pao chicken, roast duck, roast pork, scallops with vegetables, choi sum, fried calamari.   The negatives: - Cash only.  - Extremely RUDE service.  Staff was more interested in eating their own lunch than taking our order of filling our water cups.  Actually, they never filled our water cups, just plopped a pitcher of water on our table and walked away.  As a matter of fact, that's how all of our dishes were delivered - server just dropping the dish on our table and walking away.  Never asked us how we were doing or if we needed anything.  Also forgot to give us the rice we ordered - had to remind the waiter.  Only made an attempt at being pleasant when it was time to deliver the bill.  Won't be going out of our way to eat here again.",

    "text": "CRAPPIEST CHINESE JOINT I'VE EVER EATEN AT! AVOID!   I don't want to give it one star, but there's not an option for NO STARS on here. This place is CRAP.  It's located in Chinatown about 10 minutes away from the Las Vegas strip. My family and I entered and waited to be seated. We waited for about 5 minutes. The joint was pretty empty except for two tables. We really shouldn't be waiting that long since there is a hostess stand, but the hostess was no where to be found. Weird...  Anyways, we were seated and were immediately asked in Mandarin what we wanted. My mom asked them to speak in English and the waitress said, \"What do you want?\". Rude much. We ordered and our food came 10 minutes later.  What we found most surprising? Charging for rice. We're Chinese and we frequent Chinese restaurants a lot and it's always complimentary rice whenever you order a dish. We ordered roast duck, soup, beef and broccoli, and the beef chow fun. We asked for rice and they gave us two small bowls and there's five grown adults here. I see other tables had the large red containers of rice while we didn't.   When we got the check, they added 18% to 20% gratuity even though we were not a table of six. On their menu, it says they add in gratuity for tables six or more. We didn't want to tip at all, but they already included it.   Don't dine here unless you want to be mistreated. There are numerous plazas and restaurants (pho/Vietnamese, Japanese, etc) surrounding this crappy place.  The service sucks as the servers are lazy and give you attitude if you try to get their attention. Also, PLEASE speak Chinese to them if you MUST dine here. My mother made the mistake of NOT speaking Chinese which I think made them believe we weren't Chinese and thus, gave us bad service.",

You should be expecting this when you eat at an Asian restaurant. Maybe they are comparing it to a 5 star classy restaurant on the strip. --NO, it's an Asian restaurant, that's right, it's not going to be 5 stars, and it's not going to be clean--hence it's in China.   We got roasted duck lo mein, beef chow fun, orange chicken. I must say the orange chicken wasn't the best, but the roasted duck was sooo juicy and flavorful! I guess you just gotta order the right thing, or just don't expect too much.   We weren't expecting CUT or some fancy place. We knew what we were getting ourselves into, and it was delicious! I would definitely come back because hey, you can't beat the price (even though it's not as cheap as what Chinese restaurant normally would, but it's cheap for Vegas, so I'm comparing it to Vegas cheap--not OC or SD cheap).   It is CASH only, and you can't pay by chips. So just don't expect anything, get some greasy Chinese food for that hangover. That's it.",

We usually make it a point to come here right before heading home after a Vegas trip.  Our experiences have always been positive - in their service and food quality. This last time that we were here, the kind older ladies that usually work the counter were not there and instead there was a 30-something hateful lady who was taking to-go orders.   You know sometimes you get those service people who randomly go out of their way to be a jerk \"just because\"? Well, she was doing that. I'm pretty sure she was pretending not to understand Cantonese, just for the sick pleasure of making us repeat ourselves over and over. Strike one.   When she handed us our take-out, my sister was just trying to peek in the bag to make sure there were enough utensils for everyone. Mind you, no one was behind us in line, but the woman kept insisting that there were both forks and spoons inside the bag. Like a malfunctioning robot \"Forks and spoons are in the bag. They're in the bag. They're in the bag. They're in the bag...\" Um, crazy much? Strike two.  Of course when we get to the car and check, there were no forks to be seen. When my sister went back in to get some forks, the woman feigned surprise like \"Oh really??? I thought I put them in there... oooooops\" To top off this bizarre experience, our order was totally wrong, and one box was missing from it altogether - which we unfortunately didn't realize until we were already on the road. Strike three.   I would have given 1 star, but I will leave the extra star in hopes that the next time I'm in town, those sweet older ladies are back.",

At the other Sam Woo's, my favorite dish to order is the salted fish and chicken fried rice.  However in this location, there didn't seem to have any salted fish flavor.  The beef chow fun is lacking in beef.  And to top it off, the place is not as clean as the others.

However, I do have to say it has been about six months since I have actually sat down to dine there. When we have in the past, the hostess was always very cordial. As for the servers, it usually averages out each time I had gone - ignored this time, really good service the next time. Most of the time I order the Hong Kong pan fried noodles, some bbq pork or if I am with my mom also some roast pork. Most of the time we also get sauteed Chinese broccoli (yes, I do broccoli if it is of the Chinese variety.) Everything is usually very delicious, very flavorful and not \"Americanized\" at all.   Lately, I find that I mostly go here during lunch time to order from their take away counter. It is always their bbq pork and rice. The old man behind the counter is pretty friendly and the young lady who rings up my order is pretty nice as well. For me it's a carnivores delight. So I guess if you don't want to risk the service at least try the counter where you can see them weight your food for the correct price :-)",

Always leaving us disappointed with the service and our appetite...Always leaving still hungry, a stomach full of grease and a mouth full of desiring for H2O for rest of the day because they used so much MSG. and a big chunk of money from our wallet! Food is really mediocre that goes perfectly with their crappy service that yells at the guests for just standing because they're isn't any place else to stand!   Sam Woo is best known for their BBQ and noodles and rice dish, but when you ordered that, the waiter gives you a nasty dirty attitude for ordering the cheap stuff. (Which is NOT cheap!) How the heck do you get a wonton soup wrong in a Chinese restaurant?.. well they do! add a couple spoonful of MSG into a barely warm tap water and frozen wontons and voila! GROSS!   These days... They're are so much more Chinese food around Las Vegas, this is the last place I will ever step in! Mark my words!",

Dish was small for $10.  - Tofu bowl with seafood, chicken, and veggies - Okay dish. - Mixed veggies with fungus and various mushroom - Yum! This was delicious.   Prices were a bit higher than what we're used to back in the Bay Area.   Watch your food. Our dishes has plastic and foil pieces.   Cleanliness - 1 stars Check your utensils for leftover food. Tables were also not wiped down very well. Lastly, the floor had lots of napkins, chopsticks, and food. I can't believe this restaurant received an A grade!   Service - 2 stars  Even from the beginning of the experience, service was not great. The person at the front pointed to our table and gave us our menus.

    "text": "What a disappointment this place was! I was told by a friend about the amazing duck dishes this place used to serve and last week found myself with an opportunity to check the place out. Let's just say I will not be going back.  My colleague and I walked in at 12:30 pm. I was afraid that we would have to wait for a table as this was right in the middle of the lunch rush, but shockingly, there was not a table occupied in the whole joint. This should have been a red flag but we stayed, regardless.  While looking at the menu I realized it was a cash only restaurant (and the menu items are all fully priced). This relegated me to the cash that I had in my wallet -- bummer.  They have an excessively long menu and after a great deal of reading decided I'd just get the chicken lo mein since I thought that was un-mess-up-able. I thought wrong! I was presented with a huge dish of the nastiest tasting, ugliest pile of beige. The chicken was little more than tiny pieces of salty poached rib meat and gristle.  Side note: the server had a fungal infection under his fingernails. That's not exactly the last thing I want to see before I dig into a meal...gross.  I wound up eating about 6 mouthfuls of noodles before I could tolerate no more. The horrible taste stayed with me all day. I will never return.",

Well the last few times I ate here, I recall having a bad experience; waters left alone, food came at super different timing, waiter ignored us,..etc. but NOTHING beats our last experience, which was last Thursday 5/10/2012.  We arrived at 12 pm and being a weekday, the place wasn't crowded at all. We stood there waiting to be seated for a couple minutes now. We looked around, and no hostess/waiter to be found. Just people eating starring at us. Then, to our left we saw this lady (at the counter where you pay) and she made direct eye contact with us and clearly saw that we're standing around dumb, yet she reaches her cell and sat down. I was heated!!!! Finally, the waiter came and sat us down.   We waited some more for our water, and by the time we were ready to order, he was no where to be found once again. Then we saw him took two tables' order and we arrived looong before those people! ugh!  We ordered the combo; duck pork and chicken. BIG MISTAKE  I honestly could finish the whole thing alone. How do you expect 4 people to eat from such small servings!!!! Then we didn't get our rice. After flagging him down for rice, he asked 'how many'. WTH!   our bill came to 34$ . rice was $4.30  What a disappointment ending to our trip. boooooo",

Well I can say that has gone by wayside as well.  Ordered the COD IN TOMATO SAUCE  got COD doused in sweet and sour. Similar but Not the same thing. Duck was dry and shriveled made me want to cry. For a place famous for barbecue I was left with an underwhelming sense. Please folks you have been forewarned of this location. Instead go across the street to Thai Noodle House where the food is cheaper, tastier and most importantly cleaner  Went back with friends 6.01.15 even after my initial warning. Sad to say that they did not take my harsh review to heart..... Still stinky restroom  All around bad service...and the food was sub par.... Perhaps to some this place is worth the risk...but compared to the other Sam Woo's and the other great businesses in the area...JUST TAKE A PASS.....",

Sam Woo BBQ was one of my childhood favorite places, my family would always come here when we visited Vegas. Years ago, this place was packed and hard to get a table. However, progressively this place has gone downhill. Now, this restaurant is almost empty with only a few tables during the dinner rush hour. Now I know why. We shared an order of duck and chow mein noodles. The duck had very little meat and was very salty while the chow mein noodles were very bland. Only two dishes and the meal cost over $30.

Never was disappointed...  ...until I visited this Sam Woo.  Somehow this Sam Woo is different.  While it offers the same type of dishes found at other Sam Woos, the food here is not especially well prepared, on the very greasy side, and quite surprisingly expensive for what you're getting.  Upon my latest (and most likely last) visit I had the wonton soup noodle bowl and chicken lo mein.  There was nothing wrong with the soup noodle bowl but it could use some more Chinese broccoli.    The chicken lo mein was (in my mind) an utter disaster.  Instead of the fat roundy smooth lo mein noodles, it was prepared using thin wiry egg noodle which was all degrees of \"wrong\".  I ate this stuff all my life...you can't fool me!  The chicken pieces were bland and the noodles where swimming in grease.  The only thing on that plate that was decent was the Chinese broccoli.  Besides that I would never ordered this plate if I've known.  Prices here are typically $3 more than any other Sam Woos I've been to.  Service was of course crappy with minimal acknowledgment.  I even had to ask for change back as they assume the extra $8 were for them.  Giving them such a big tip for sub-par service...I think not!",

We ordered crispy pan-fried noodles, beef chow fun, seafood hot pot, BBQ pork, deep fried calamari, and beef pepper steaks. All dishes were authentic Cantonese style and delicious. The only negative aspect to the foods was that the pepper steak was too chewey.   Service was super fast and attentive.  We didn't encounter any service problems as described by some of the Yelpers.

    "text": "I lived in SoCal and love, love, LOVE the Sam Woo there, and was so happy when I first moved out here to Vegas in 2008 to see a familiar restaurant in Las Vegas Chinatown.  It was one of the first 3 off-strip restaurants that I tried on Spring Mountain.  Unfortunately my expectation for quality Chinese food at a reasonable price was quickly shattered by the huge mound of rice and miniscule amount of chicken and vegetables on the plate and the tourist trap prices being charged.  The flavor was okay, but trying to justify the price tag by shoveling extra extra rice is not the answer.  And I recall thinking WTH!  Did this restaurant steal the name of a well-known and much loved restaurant from California???  2.5 years later, I am still not sure if the restaurant is operated by the same family or is part of the same franchise, but I do know that I didn't want to go back to this crappy Sam Woo ever again, and have been True to my word.  And to those reviewers that think real Chinese restaurants do not or should not be bother with offer good service along with good food and still rate this poor imitation of a restaurant a 5 star, I think you should qualify your reviews with disclaimers that the reviews and ratings are for food only.  And if I want to pay Casino Chinese restaurant prices for at least mediocre food, why do I have to leave the Strip?  Plus, I dare say that a lot of the Chinese restaurants in the high end casinos offer better food than the ones you can get here.",

Overall, plenty other authentic Chinese restaurants on Spring Mountain. Although the location is great, not worth the hassle with food quality/quantity, poor service, dirty utensils, & inappropriate charges on your bill.",

That I didn't trust my first instinct when I walked in, I wanted to walk right back out, and I should have  (this should be #1 but I don't feel like switching it.)  Okay fellow yelpers, so let me clarify that I cannot attest to the entire menu (but you see the other reviews), all I ordered was chicken fried rice. Nothing complex. Omg I had been craving fried rice for weeks now. I was actually near china town for other reasons, and figured what better place to grab chicken fried rice.  Just a quick something to hold me n the kiddos over until dinner.  China town was maybe a good idea, probably not at the time (bc lots of joints were closed and that limited my choices...but the again, it's China Town for crying out loud!!!!  You can't mess up fried rice!!!), but Sam Woo was a bad decision.   I guess I can award my one little (it's a little star) star to the service. The hostess was helpful, friendly, and gracious.  The server behind the to-go buffet was nice, we had a bit of a language barrier, but some nice patrons translated for me.   I thought I took a picture, but apparently not.   How was the chicken fried rice...awful!  My kids and I all agreed that it was completely flavorless.  I only like light soy sauce when I eat my fried rice, it can be overwhelming and too salty (on a good batch of F. Rice). I have never in my life used 3 packets of soy sauce on my portion...I did that night...and guess what!?!?  It was STILLLLLLL completely flavorless!  It was so bland that the dish absorbed the flavor of the soy sauce and neutralized it/canceled it out!  My eldest daughter wouldn't even eat hers bc she couldn't get past the presentation and the texture of the chicken. The chicken looked like little worms, or like noodles. It was weird!  I wish I had the picture, but I think someone else captured it in the yelp photos. The chicken had absolutely no flavor/taste. It was so \"tender\" that there was no sign of the meat fibers.  My daughter thought they were tentacles. She refused to eat it.  I tried and I couldn't finish mine either.  What a waste of money!    So yelpers, BEWARE...",

From here on everything just went downhill. The guy who took our order was straight up rude. I asked if the steamed chicken could be made spicy due to a misinterpretation on my part of the menu. He literally could've just said \"sorry, we don't cook it that way\" but instead he gave me a dirty look and belittled me for even asking. I know that at more traditional Asian restaurants the bar is low for customer service but this was just on another level. Then he began to walk away before we even finished taking our order!  We literally asked for waters 3 times only to either forgotten or ignored. My mom eventually had to get up and get the cups and water pitcher herself from the kitchen because no one was even looking at us when we were trying to get their attention. I rarely write reviews on Yelp, but the way they treated me just left me beyond annoyed.  The food was mediocre at best. Everything was bland, we had to add a good amount of salt and pepper to even get some taste. So save your time and money and hit up literally ANYWHERE else because it will be better than this shithole.",

We only ordered Mongolian beef and a small combo platter of chicken, pork and duck, it came out in about 2 minutes. The food was nothing to write home about. It was just sustenance- which was disappointing due to the price.  The server never came back to refill drinks or ask if wanted anything else. Due to the restaurants in this area, the food taste and the service, it's a definite no- I will not be back.",

When writing order, she just want to rush you complete the order and very unprofessional.  Food wise, the bbq pork meat looks like cooked and sit here for a long time. The ribs are in giant pieces and majority of them are bone. The vegetables are not fresh.  Overall, One star is way too much for this restaurant. What a joke!",

No warning, so that was real pleasant. The pork was dry and the crust of it was so hard I couldn't even bite it. Rice and flavor was good. Service was horrible. Don't know if that's a common thing, cause we received bad service at the last Asian place we ate, or if it's cause we're not Asian. I will not come again. And I'm pretty sure I'm won't be checking out any more restaurants in China Town.",

We personally felt that this place has excellent customer service! All of the waiters were very attentive and friendly! Two of us ordered the roast pork wonton, which was absolutely delicious! I really should have taken photos of all of our dishes. But I only took a photo of my own roast duck wonton bowl.   Even though this place is in the heart of Las Vegas' Chinatown, we felt like the meat, dishes, and bowls were much tastier than some of the meat we had at the hotel/casino buffets on the Las Vegas Strip! And the food at Sam Woo is so much more reasonably priced, too! I would highly recommend this place to anyone who is craving good Chinese food!",

One thing that should have raised a red flag is that on the menu a lot of the prices are blacked out. The rest are poorly written over on white tape. My friend pointed to a pictured item in the menu and asked the waiter for a price. When the final bill came, we noticed that my friend's item came out +$4 above what he was told by the waiter. My item is $2 more than what I saw in the menu. We talked to the waiter to no avail as he kept denying what he told my friend. We decided to pay and get out of there but don't tip a cent. The whole experience kinda left a bad taste. Won't be back there again and learned the lesson to avoid unfamiliar places where the prices are blacked out.",

We asked 3 times for somebody to wipe our table. After that, we waved our hands to get the employees attention so that we can order. Nobody noticed us. One employee said she was off her shift, but she was still working the entire time we were there. She lied to us. Finally, a waiter came and took our order. We ordered three dishes and were told it's all sold out. He then asked us what we wanted to eat and we asked what they have available. We asked about the lobster, he then looked at his watch (indicating he doesn't want us to order). I didn't expect good service from this place but not horrible service. The good thing about this place is that it made me write my first review ever!",

    "text": "I grew up shopping around this restaurant. My mom stopped letting us come here because she said they had \"bad attitude,\" but I'd always assumed that maybe it was just a one-time exception that left a bad impression on her. Came back today for the first time in years with my dad to try it again. It was one of the worst experiences I've had at a Chinese restaurant. I usually don't give low ratings on Yelp (\"if you don't have anything nice to say, don't say it\"), but the service was so rude I'm still upset about it.   We came in around 2pm, and there was barely anyone there. Half the tables weren't cleaned and they said we could sit in the corner. My dad wanted to sit by the window so we asked if we could wait for one of the tables after it was cleaned. That must have ticked off the waitress because when she came to take our order, she wouldn't even look at us in the eye. My dad asked her if they had a certain dish and she just said, \"Whatever's in the menu is what we have.\" I asked for the BBQ pork and duck combo which is what they are known for. It took them twenty minutes to bring it out, and they intentionally (I say intentionally because I saw plenty of other meat available) served us the end pieces of the pork that were not even chewable. I am not exaggerating.   We paid for a combo plate and we couldn't eat half of it. I am not by any means a picky eater, but the pieces of pork were so hard that there was no meat, just crust. My dad couldn't eat it at all. I didn't even know what to say because I was pretty sure at that point they were trying to piss us off. I know that yelp reviews shouldn't be based so heavily on service, but if anyone's reading this, I'm giving you fair warning: I tried to give this place another chance but it will ruin your appetite.",

We asked for spoons, lady said \"no more spoons\" , like say what?  Our orange beef didnt come. The eggplant tasted \"fishy\".The pan fried \"crispy\" noodles was all sauce/gravy...even before mixing it - noodlles already limp and mushy. Yang chow bland. Maybe I wAs noticing things too much since it was pretty much on a downward spirAl eversince we got seated. Never again. They were still packed though , go figure... either new optimistic patrons like us or just some people who gives no Fu**s about service or food... go try at your own risk.

Just the right thing to keep you going, especially since I've been up for almost two days straight (man, am I tired!).  Looks like this small restaurant has a little take out \"to go\" section, and they even make their own roast pork, and roast duck.  I can see that Sam Woo's has won many awards in the past. The last was a Zaget award back in year 2012.  Lots of parking in the strip mall, service was fast.........but when you go during off hours, it shouldn't be a problem correct?",

I came here a few days ago since we were in Las Vegas and my co-worker was craving Chinese food.  First off, the prices were way inflated for a Sam Woo restaurant.  Then when the food came, it was bland.  We ordered the Beef with chinese broccoli, house special chow mein, and sweet and sour chicken.  I am sad to say that the best part of the meal was the chow mein, which was only okay at best.  I guess we should have ordered duck, but that might have been a disappointed as well.  I should have known when there was only one other person in the entire restaurant before we sat down for dinner.",

The service was another story.   I can see what the other reviewer said about how if you're not Chinese (my bf and I are half viet) they totally disregard you. My boyfriend and I waited on our checks and boxes for our food for over 30 minutes! The servers were moving super fast catering to every other table except for ours.   I had to give it only 2 stars because the service was just that bad. Will probably never come back, even if the food was good. Don't recommend this place because it's not worth dealing with the bad service!",

Of course it is more pricy than its counterpart in Los Angeles since a lot of ingrident had to be shipped from Los Angeles. The service is alright.  They took our order and bring our food in a reasonable time.  Neither fast nor slow.  Typical chinatown service and decoration.  I came to eat not to look at the decor or talk to the waiter.  If you want to look, go to the casino located in the strip.  If you want to talk, talk to your travelling compansion or watch a comedy show. We ordered: Beef chow Fun.  Very tasty. BBQ pork on steam rice.  Generous portion of pork.  Pork is a little bit on the salty side. Shrimp Fried Rice.  Good wok Flavor but low in salt to bring up the taste.  Shrimp is small. Seafood pan fried noodle.  Could use a little bit of soy sauce. Overall, the food is Ok but not very delicious.  Service is OK.  Portion is not as generious as the Los Angeles counterpart and more pricy, however, this is located in the middle of a desert.  Everyone here charge more than Los Angeles.",

When you first walk in, you are greeted with a wall of awards, recognitions, and accolades from websites and critics. I've been to a Sam Woo BBQ before, and this was uncommon. I thought it would lead to a good start, I was wrong.  Those awards were issued in 2001, and boy, did they really change the restaurant till now. I ordered the roast pork and roast duck rice dish. Just to let you know, the prices for the food served here are double the price if the Sam Woo back in SD ($7-$10, Las Vegas Sam Woo $7-$20). Came pretty fast. The duck was OK, but the pork was really fatty. In fact, it was almost ALL fat. Not too good.  My dad, on the other hand, ordered the Singapore noodles. While we were eating our food and finishing up, his food hasnt even left the kitchen yet. We asked if they forgot his order, and one of the waiters jus rudely replied:  \"Its coming out, wait.\"  After 10 minutes we asked again. Turned out they JUST started the order the second time we asked. The waiter didnt even acknowledge the chefs in the kitchen to see if they started. The food came, but the service spoke for itself already.  NO GOOD.",

As soon as that came out, we ordered the rest of the dishes. Chinese broccoli, mushroom with fried tofu, fried fish cutlets, fried chicken. All decent.

Cheese prize tickets.  The place is downright filthy, so much so that roaches wouldn't even inhabit it, and it's not for a lack of water either (as they are water bugs), because you have plenty of liquids (water + oil) on the kitchen floors, clearly visible from the cashier.  Also, my entire family once got sick eating here, and this fine establishment was in the papers the next day (this was before the internet achieved prominence). Hint, they were not featured for their signature roast duck either.  But yes, to those who are still heedless or with intrepid iron stomachs, continue to eat here, just wear diapers or take some Immodium beforehand.  Oh, and the char siu pork was dry.

My mom tipped only $2 because they didn't do s**t ( I didn't think they deserved a dime) and that b**** had the nerve to sneer \"that's not even 15%!\" and gave us a nasty look.

Since we had such a large group, we all sampled each other's entrees. I couldn't believe how disappointed I was with the other meals! The fried rice that my friend ordered was just so stale. And the Lo Mein that my boyfriend ordered was made with wonton noodles, which were tasteless and overcooked.  The language barrier we had with our waiter was difficult as well. I wish they would state to their customers before they take orders that they only take cash. The sign they have at the cash register wasn't eye-catching enough for us to notice on our own. I would also advise everyone to reevaluate your bill when they bring it to you. They write everything in Chinese so if you have a big order, it's hard to distinguish which item is which and whether they charged you the correct amount. Our large group has multiple separate checks and we found THREE miscalculations where they charged us more than the price that was displayed on the menu.  Overall, this is not a restaurant that really cares about their customers. They find small ways to gyp you and just because my group looked Americanized, doesn't mean we like our Asian food Americanized. Not worth going to unless you're going to order the BBQ Pork and Duck. I would've given them 2 stars, but since my dish was good, I'll add an extra star.",

One thing that I noticed was that the servers favored the other two tables. This might be since they were not Asian! This place shows favoritism over which customers they want to provide good service to! This is just wrong. Service should be equal among all!  I will probably never come here again. My table called over the boss and server to talk to them. We asked them why our food had not come yet and told them that the other half of my table had already finished their plates.

Simple stuff - I can do this at home if I'm ever there!  But oh man the Won Ton was nasty.  It tasted like broiled ground pork - there was no flavor and the texture of the meat was all wrong. *shivering*  The BBQ port was okay, but it sat in the broth for too long and it was starting to get stringy.  This simple fare is a staple for Sam Woo man! How the hell did this joint nuke it this bad?  You know, I was so tired of hotel food that I was willing to take a few bite of this and move on.  But I'm never coming back to this place.  Amazing how this place managed to embarrass the already mediocre reputation that is Sam Woo...",

    "text": "This place used to be really good. I would go there once a month or so. Hadn't been there in a couple years and decided to stop in...  They had no iced tea, very weird for a restaurant. They brought my water out in a cup that stank like mildew or something and had some sort of white residue caked up on the insides of the cup.  I wasn't too hungry, the person I was with came to eat, I was just sort of tagging along, so I ordered the salt and pepper chicken wings. The person I was with got their food and ate more than half of it before my wings showed up. When they did show up you could taste the filthy oil. I'm guessing they haven't changed their fryer oil in quite some time.   On top of all of this, the servers lean against a wall in the dining area and stare at the customers without ever addressing them. After you get your food and drink, if you want something else, you have to get their attention and call them over.  All in all, this place is pretty terrible. Do yourself a favor and stay away",

The waiter looked like he was ready to jump off a bridge. Service with a frown. Every menu item was over $10, even the stir fried chinese spinach. I can understand paying up for an upscale chinese eatery, but this place ain't even close.  Cash only is ridiculous given the high prices. But then again this is Vegas, where cash is king.",

    "text": "For a while they were known as the go to place for Chinese BBQ. Now I wonder how they stay in business. With crooked practices, you have to watch them carefully.  On a few occasions, my family and I have been cheated by them. They have calculated our bill wrong. Then there are the times that they have taken a duck leg when we ordered a whole bird to take home. A one legged duck is not a common sight, so I do not know how they thought they could get away with it. My dad did not let this slide and raised hell. They of course apologized, but the next time another part was missing.   The food is nothing special compared to the prices they charge. Go upstairs to Capital Seafood or go down the street to Cafe Noodle. If you like Chinese BBQ go to the take out restaurant connected to the International Marketplace. They are a fraction of the price and do not try to pull the wool over their customers.",

We still went in and sat and to our surprise, the food prices weren't what they used to be. All items are $10 and up and nothing under. A small cup of white rice is $1.00. They used to be included free in some entrees. This perhaps explain why the place was unusually empty.",

    "text": "We went here over Memorial weekend for brunch after church. We wanted to go to Harbor Palace, because that's where we usually go...but it had a long wait. Sam Woo was our second stop. It was pretty crowded, as expected. When we walked in the hostess station was empty, so we made our way to the cashier and asked to be put on the waiting list. She rudely told us to go back to the hostess station and wait for her there. We were given a ticket with the number 1 on it, so I was pretty hopeful. After about 20 minutes of waiting, we noticed that people that arrived after us were being seated. We got even more suspicious when the hostess asked us again how many were in our party & gave us a ticket with the number 8 on it. Things were obviously very disorganized.  My mom then caught the hostess' attention and asked her exactly how their seating was conducted, because we had been waiting awhile, parties were being seated before us that arrived after, and she wasn't calling any numbers. Her reply was, and I kid you not \"You know, don't worry about it. They have the bigger party and their table became available first. You just have to wait for a smaller table, so don't worry about it.\"  It was so rude. I think she realized she said something wrong, because as were were leaving (didn't want to patronize a place like that) she said \"I have your table ready for you now.\" My mother turned around, handed her the ticket back and said \"You know, don't worry about it.\"  The look on that hostess' face was priceless :)",

    "text": "Most of us that go to Sam Woos have been to the ones in OC and LA, so we sorta have an expectation for some decent Chinese food. However this place fails to deliver far below on our expectations. Not to mention they even have a Vegas markup on their prices. I guess they figure that most of their crowd are going to be from the casinos and want to save a bunch, why not gouge them anyway.  I ordered a chicken dish and beef dish, throw in some steam rice and we are already close to $30? How? I could've had a decent buffet meal at that price. I wouldn't complain if the food tasted somewhat comparable to the location in OC, but it was just bland Chinese food. The service was non-existent. That would explain why I left a penny for the tip.   I highly recommend staying away from this Sam Woo. There are probably some better Chinese options in the same parking lot that I would go with.",

The BBQ items are very flavorful and succulent, the service on the other hand is horrible - comes with an attitude and a smirk :) The last time I visited the Vegas Sam Woo we didn't order family style like what I'm use to. Instead I ordered an entree of the Triple BBQ Wonton Lo Mein and it was AMAZING! A combination of lo main, wontons, and BBQ totally satisfied my appetite in all sorts of ways.",
