However...you did neither...in fact when I flagged you down..you said \" oh you don't like it\" and kept walking....  Another note to you...not a good idea to make me get up and ask another waiter to refill my drink....

I am SO glad that I'm a tightwad and looked at the <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FVegas.com&s=815df335831efd1e460521ad580e06c20729c8d21a1b3ec4986fca500635ab53\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Vegas.com</a> cheap eats page.  If I had not, I would have never known about the gem that was around the corner from where we were staying.    The off menu Gambler's Special ~ 5-6oz steak, grilled shrimp, mashed potatoes, and a side salad ~ $7.77.   (Looks around and whispers)  \"I'll have the $7.77 special.\" I felt dirty ordering it.   LOL  Salad - Decent sized.  Cherry tomatoes were a nice touch.  Steak - Cooked medium rare - OMG THE BOMB!  Perfectly cooked.  Nicely seasoned.  This was just like the steak we grill for ourselves at home.   Mashed Potatoes - Pretty good.  Nice and smooth. Not gluey.   Shrimp - Now, I love shrimp.  J on the other hand does not.  He actually ate his!  That's saying something!!    Now the portions are probably on the small side, but they were more than enough for J and I.  I was a little worried that J would still be hungry afterwards, but said he was stuffed!  We were not expecting much from a steak dinner that costs less than $8.00 and were pleasently surprised!    We went back a total of 3 times in the 4 days we were there.  The last being Monday morning for the $6.99 steak and eggs breakfast (steak, 2 eggs, hash browns, and toast).  Its $4.99 if you have a players card.    Service:   Friday Night - Seemed our server had other things on his mind.   Sunday Night - Improved.  A little more attentive.  Monday Morning - This server ROCKED!!!!  We were techinally 2 minutes late for the steak and eggs special, but he gave it to us anyway.  On the ball with the drink refills.    I definitely think Mr. Lucky's will be a regular spot for us on Vegas trips in the future.",

However, if like me you want something fair priced, and like  a diner which is nice if you have a group, been out partying, or just want some comfort food this will hit the spot! I loved their burger and their SHAKE if you like shakes was amazing! And the food is quick.   My other half was celebrating his birthday and his cousin ordered a piece of cake, well this one slice may have well just been a big small cake by itself. It was amazing.   The service was ok, great at getting the food but not as much checking on you but frankly to me the food was good enough that I didn't really care. This place will not disappoint if you are looking for something to hit the spot this definitely will!",

    "text": "Came here with my girlfriends for breakfast and a late dinner (after the club) one weekend. The diner was packed when we came early for breakfast. There was about a 10 minute wait before my party of 7 was seated. I ordered the Classic Rock entree which is your typical breakfast food - eggs, toast, hashbrowns and your choice of sausage or bacon. Food came out hot and was pretty good, however I didn't find it to be anything spectacular. Some other entrees my friends had ordered were their country fried steak, omelette burrito, and the aloha - all that looked a lot more tasty than mine! The proportions were decent and the prices were moderate.   Dinner on the other hand, not so great. We noticed on Yelp that they had a $9.99 prime rib special, but apparently it was only available on Sunday nights!! There was another special going on that evening (or should I say morning at 2am) which was their steak and shrimp special with a side of mashed potatoes and salad for $7.77! What a DEAL right?! Well, you really do get what you pay for! The steak I thought was super chewy and I took two bites of it and was not able to finish the rest. The mashed potatoes were salty as heck and I was NOT the only one who thought so!! The chef's taste bud was totally off that night. Of course we complained, but the waiter was rude and said there's nothing he can do about it and that's how the mashed potatoes are seasoned. Considering I was incoherent, I spooned him some mashed potatoes and told him to try it himself and tell me it's not salty!! He walked away careless of what he had to say with no sincere apologies what so ever! But moments later, the jerk waiter returned back with complimentary fries along with the remark of telling us he told the chef to add no salt to the fries because we don't like salt. (Okk...whatever!)   Anywho, breakfast here is pretty good. The dinner here may also be great, but I would highly recommend you not to order any of their dinner specials! It comes with a side of rudeness topped with extra ATTITUDE if you don't like your meal!!!",

It came with a large portion of orzo that had no seasoning at all, I didn't eat any of it. The side salad add - on for $2 was a pretty good portion of nice baby lettuces and cherry tomatoes. The $4 side of broccoli was kind of a bummer, steamed, and again, no sauce or flavorings at all. Overall a decent experience and I'd probably eat there again but I'd order something different and wouldn't have too high of expectations.",

    "text": "Another day, another gamblers special.  I have been to this restaurant more times than I can count. For starters, the HRH houses one of my favorite clubs (Vanity). It also happens to be the host for several annual events that I attend. So even though I have never stayed here I always seem to wander over to this off-strip hotel at least once during each Vegas visit.  And since Mr. Lucky's is open all day, has decent prices and is conveniently located... it is my go-to stop whenever I get drunk munchies, regular munchies or just need a place to sit down for a while.  Most of the time I order the Gambler's Special. It isn't on the menu but those \"in the know\" know that it is a sirloin steak, choice of potato, side salad and 3 skewered shrimp. It is only $7.95 and always has been.   The Gambler's Special is usually great. I have only had one bad experience where the steak was inedible. The shrimp has always been well seasoned and the salad is a decent side salad.  Other items I have ordered are full size salads, sides of mashed potatoes and the hummus/pita appetizer. The hummus/pita appetizer is a large serving. If you are ordering it for only one person... don't order anything else.   Some of the items can be a bit over-priced so I don't think I would order a regular on-menu entree.   Service can be great or lacking. Either way, the meal comes out quick.  Bonus: They now have a slew of flat screens to keep you entertained in case the people you are with are lame or passed out.",

I mean really its like they put a whole stick of butter in on each serving nom nom. I am thinking about coming here one of these days, ordering 3 large sides of it and eating it all shamelessly in some corner booth.  These Cadillac of potatoes is served the $7.77 steak dinner deal, which I think is the only reason anyone would come to this otherwise average casino cafe. Get a players card and ask the server about the deal, its served 24/7 but isn't listed on the menu. It comes with 3 grilled shrimp, a decent cut of steak, salad, and of course... the mashed potatoes that Jesus must have made. The $7.77 is sort of a poorly kept secret but something that alot of tourist probably don't know about. In fact, its probably the only reason I would even come here.  Other than that, everything else on the menu is pretty average and very overpriced. $17 for a regular cheeseburger? pfff go to Burger Bar. They also have a pretty good happy hour that starts at midnight. This should be on anyone's Vegas cheap eats list.",

It used to be a good value and a decent meal.  However, I went yesterday and asked for the gambler's special and was informed by the waiter that the deal has changed.  Now you need to have a player's card (one per table) from the Hard Rock to get the $7.77 deal and you must purchase a beverage, which brings the price to over $10 at the very minimum.  If you don't have a player's card or don't want to go get one (signing-up for one is free), the gambler's special is $10 plus the purchase of a beverage, which will bring your total to over $13 at the very minimum.  I was told by our waiter that the policy changed just a short time ago.   One last thing I'd like to comment on is the quality of the gambler's special itself.  It seems that the quality of the meal has gone down over time.  It's just not as good as it used to be.  I hope this review helps.",

I had the steak and eggs, which come with hash browns and toast, and it was perfectly fine.  The problem started at the end of the night. Our check came out to $22, and I gave the server two 20s. Twenty minutes go by and I still haven't gotten my change. After trying to flag him down several times, I finally get the guy's attention and ask for my change. He looks annoyed and says he'll go check on it. Five minutes later he comes back and plunks it  down on the table. I didn't leave a tip.  I understand that people aren't tipping as much these days, and that has to be hard on service industry people. But there's a line, and this guy crossed it. He made it all but obvious that he was trying to hold onto all the change (like I was going to leave him a nearly 100% tip) and that really ticks me off. I love the food here but the service has really gone downhill to the point where I almost don't want to go back.",

    "text": "Oh my, where do I begin? My girlfriend and I came to this establishment because we were staying at the Hard Rock so it seemed like our easiest option for some \"quick\" breakfast. Boy, were we wrong. First of all, this Place looks and sounds like an overcrowded cafeteria, and the workers uniforms are extremely unprofessional and it's hard to recognize them throughout the hubbub. Second, it took forever for us to be waited on and when we did it took 20 minutes to get water, let alone a mimosa that was absolutely disgusting. Well when they finally decided to take out order I ordered the Belgian waffle with strawberries and my friend ordered the bagel sandwich. Lets just say we were thoroughly disappointed 45 minutes later when the server brought us our food. My waffle was hard and cold, the 2 strawberries they put on it were sour, and the syrup was ice cold. I flagged down a waiter somehow, told him, ordered something else, and when that came back I felt the need to read reviews immediately. This place is horrible. So thoroughly disappointed. Will not return nor recommend.",

It was $7.77, and it came with a 4 oz piece of steak, three shrimps on a skewer, and a few dollops of mashed potatoes. It also came with a small side salad.   The food was good, but I was a little let down with the portion size. I guess we really did get what we paid for. Not bad, though!  The reason why I gave it a 2 star is because I felt like we had a neglectful server. He didn't come to our table at all during our meal, and that means no refills. No one came to our table for a good 25-30 minutes, actually, and we were waiting for a while to pay for our meal. Not trying to act all snobby or anything (we could have easily came up to the counter to pay), but our excuse was that we were on vacation.  Bottomline: I'm sure there are better options, and I wouldn't mind coming back to try them out. Hopefully we don't get the same server.",

    "text": "I wasn't able to partake in the super cheap NY steak and eggs combo that everyone else is raving about in their reviews so I'm going to judge this based on the two unfortunate meals I had there.  My first and main incentive on eating at this place was to get a \"Pass the Line\" / VIP stamp to use at the hotel's big concert venue, The Joint. I consider myself to be a seasoned concert attendee in Las Vegas because I go to Vegas at least twice a year for shows. But it's only as of this recent visit that I've been told about about this Pass the Line VIP thing for the Joint. If you're familiar with this program at the House of Blues establishments, it's almost the same thing at the Joint where if you order an entree or spend a certain dollar amount (not just drinks), you can get in another line that gets you in the venue before the regular general admission line does.   So I find out this information about an hour and a half before doors are set to open and I run over to Lucky's, sit at the counter and tell them I'll need the cheapest, fastest meal I can get so I can have that Pass the Line stamp. Even though I sat at the counter thinking I'd get faster service, the wait for an available server must've been at least 8 minutes. When the server came by, he suggested the chicken tenders. The order came by surprisingly fast. But no amount of ranch or barbecue sauce could've helped those dry and rubbery chicken breast pieces. McDonalds chicken nuggets taste better than this crap. I ate at least two of the four pieces to try to get my money's worth, paid my meal, got my stamp and ran over to the VIP line at the Joint.   I should've left the Hard Rock as soon as the show was over but my feet and back were killing me. (How could you not  dance your heart out and lose your sh*t watching Arcade Fire?) I thought I'd give my feet a good rest before heading out again so I went to Lucky's one more time to see if they could redeem themselves. It was only 11 PM so I was an hour too early to get the steak and eggs. I went with the sliders because I didn't want a huge burger or sandwich and not that many places can mess up sliders, right? This was the worst set of hamburger sliders I've ever had. The buns were dry and seemed like they were days old. The meat was tasteless and too thin. I was annoyed the sliders didn't come with french fries, and after the server told me a side order of french fries was huge, I just went with hash browns. The hash browns were ok and that was the only part of my meal I enjoyed.   Mr. Lucky's 24-7, you are on my Las Vegas sh*tlist. I always have good meals when I go to Vegas, and after eating here twice, I'm only going here if I desperately need that Pass the Line stamp.",

    "text": "TLDR: 24 hour facility inside Hard Rock Hotel & Casino, Triple 7 special available, but only if you ask for it, inadequate customer service, ok/overpriced food, $1 discount with players' card on most items  After a long night on the town, my friends and I decided to visit Mr. Lucky's 24-7 for some late-night eats to end the debauchery. I regrettably did not order the Gamblers Special which contains steak cooked to your preferred temperature, a skewer of shrimp, mashed potatoes, and seasonal veggies. The 777 special is only available with a Players' Card and is not offered on the menu. Instead, I ordered the veggie burger. If you have the players' card, however, most items di receive a $1 discount.  It is my belief that, within reasonable doubt, the hostess and servers are overworked and underpaid as we were greeted with a forced, robotic greeting, no eye contact and rushed tones. Our server was responsible for multiple tables and we had to flag her down just to get a refill of water and soda.   With regards to the food, about 60% of the order was accurate. The funny thing was that the orders with special requests were accurate, but the regular orders were incomplete often missing things like lettuce, sauce, or the side of toast. The veggie burger did not taste like Morningstar Farms (thank god) and was actually pretty decent for $13.99...Needless to say, I will not be returning to this location any time soon. The sub-par service matched with overpriced/adequate food encourages me to spend my money elsewhere.",

After a standard Saturday night out in Vegas, we ended up at Mr. Lucky's to demolish an early morning bite. As to be expected for Vegas, the food here is both mediocre at best and severely overpriced. I don't think any of the items were under $15. Granted, the portions were fine and large, but they're slightly delusional charging an arm and a leg for the worst chicken fingers I've ever had. I asked for \"teriyaki\" because it sounded better than plain, and the chicken fingers were so over-sauced I might've been drinking them. The teriyaki concoction was mostly a sugary, additive-laden disaster.  Even worse (and why I'm writing this): their lazy waitstaff. I gave my order to a disgruntled employee (who had just received a bad tip from another party) and he was stomping around the kitchen pouting. NOTE: This was a grown, older gentleman.  It took roughly 20 minutes for someone to take my order and then another four years to get it. In fact, another customer came in, sat down next to me, ordered the EXACT. SAME. THING, AND GOT HER ORDER FIRST.  Needless to say, when I finally received my food 45 minutes to an hour later, I got up and walked out.",

    "text": "VEGAS! The Hard Rock Cafe has been on many travel channel, food network, and crazy websites telling you to go and ask for the not so secret $7.77 plate. So my group and I came here for a quick meal before we hit the road about 7am. So here are a few tips on this famous special. * First go get a players card to receive discounted price. (this will get you $5 dollars of play on the same day on certain games but you need to put in $1 to activate) * Second you need to order a drink (does not have to be alcoholic but always a good choice in Vegas) * Lastly you are looking at about $12 per person after tax and tip if you stick to the special and soda or coffee at 7am.  The food was good and my steak was cooked perfectly. The rest of my group loved the shrimp and even the green beans. So I definitely recommend this special even after the extra hoops you have to jump through.",

Cool, we all need that H2O. About five minutes after not receiving my Coke or acknowledgement of a coke I should be receiving, I got my microwaved unseasoned mashed potatoes and dog chew of a prime rib.   My own fault for coming back after my encounter last year, when I didn't receive any horseradish or water and had to eat a dry piece of meat like a bad seventies porn. This bill was the same cost as the Prime Rib Loft at Orleans, which was 100% better. All in all, Hard Rock is a nice Casino.",

I have been eating here late night for about 3 years but I have to say I feel the food has gotten so much better recently.  I love all the new burger options but the crispy chicken sandwich at this place is the absolute best around.  For breakfast i really enjoy the pancakes & cornbeef hash but to be honest in about 10 visits we have never had a bad meal. O and did i mention its a great place to people watch!!",

I knew I would be hiking on this particular day and doing a lot of walking, and so I wanted to get in a filling meal to tide me over.  The breakfast was above average. I got the standard eggs, hash browns, and toast. The breakfast was perfectly prepared. I also had some fresh-squeezed orange juice.   Not much else to say about this place. It's ideal for those looking for a 20 to 30 minute break from all of the action going on inside the casino.",

Finally found it, seemed the font on the place was a tad easy to miss. In any case, turns out you need the player's card to get the 7.77 meal along with the purchase of a drink so I got a players card and ordered a drink. The food was ok. I think I got a fairly tough cut of steak, but not bad. The 7.77 meal with the purchase of a drink almost gives the Ellis Island $8 steak meal a run for its money.",

    "text": "My hubby and I arrived around 8:30pm on a Friday night and were seated quickly.  It wasn't very busy, so our drink orders were taken quickly. However, it took a little longer to have our food order taken. We each ordered the Gambler's Special, which is $7.77 for steak, 3 shrimp, mashed potatoes and a side salad. We were asked by the waitress if we had a player's club card. We told her that we didn't have one, so she told us that instead of $7.77, the cost would be $9.99. Had we known this, we would have signed up for a player's club card to get the discount. Having our hearts already set for steak and shrimp, we proceeded with our order.  We also ordered a few adult beverages - My hubby ordered the Monster Circus and I ordered the Blushin' Russian.   The reason why I give Mr. Lucky's 3 stars instead of something higher is because of the wait time and the quality of food. When our orders came, my husband's steak was cooked medium instead of medium rare like he asked and my steak came out completed well done, when I had asked for it medium. I thought about sending it back, but by then I was starving and in no mood to wait for another steak to be cooked.  The steak and shrimp were just ok. Nothing spectacular about it. The mashed potatoes came unseasoned, so we had to salt and pepper it ourselves.  Overall, for the price, the Gambler's Special isn't bad at all. Our drinks were really tasty, no skimping on the alcohol either. You can taste it, but not in an overwhelming way.   I'm not sure if we'll be back, but I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a cheap, decent meal. Just remember to get your player's club card!",

We all vowed to be back the next time we're in Vegas.  Well, 3 years later and we're back, but this time the experience left a sour note in our mouths (pun intended).  To get the 7.77 deal now, you have to order a beverage and sign up for a player's card.  The worst part is that the steak is no longer of good quality like previously.   In fact, our steaks were dry and chewy.  The shrimps were excellent though.  The price of the beverages were quite high and the deal no longer includes a salad.  Sadly, this makes the 7.77 special no longer a deal.  Go elsewhere and have better food at a cheaper price.",

When we came for breakfast they were out of corned beef for the corned beef hash so I had the steak and eggs. The food was cooked nicely but the steak was poor quality and tough and the potatoes were bland. Next day at lunch I had the spicy chicken sandwich and the chicken was really overcooked and dry. The hints of flavor I got gave the impression that if the chicken was cooked right it would have been a really good sandwich but as it was, it was very dry. They also advertised $2 Thursday pie but when I asked about it the server said they didn't do that promotion anymore. If that is the case, they need to update the specials card. On my last day there I got the not so secret special steak dinner and again the steak was cooked nicely but was tough and had a piece of gristle which I've never been served anywhere and I have eaten in some real dumps. The shrimp and mashed potatoes were great, the green beans were raw and covered in a bad garlic paste. They would get more stars if the prices were more in line with the quality and the staff was nicer. My experience at Mr. Lucky's made me skip the rest of the restaurants in the resort.",

    "text": "Loved our waiter, Joey!!! He definitely was very considerate and patient, especially considering that it was around 6 am in the morning and that he had a few \"knocked\" out customers experiencing one of their worst hangovers ever (not me, I was one of the people taking care of them).  Anyways, we stopped by here because we met up at the wrong place (originally thought it was the Hard Rock Cafe). We decided to stay and eat here instead. Joey was very patient because around 1/2 the people were ready to order and a few weren't, so he made sure to come by and check every so often to take our orders. He supplied us with water to drink quickly (especially for those hung over).  I ordered the CHICKEN FRIED STEAK with HASHBROWNS, WHOLE WHEAT TOAST, and my EGGS OVER EASY. Mmmmm..... Three of my friends decided to order the SIRLOIN STEAK AND EGGS for $17.99, which truthfully, I thought was a little expensive. I think we came at the wrong time because I'm reading all these reviews about how the steak and eggs are no more than ten bucks? Ehh...   Anyways, another reason why our waiter was cool was he gave us updates on our plates, so that we weren't randomly sitting their waiting. When our dishes arrived, mine looked like heaven!!! I was so famished.   Man, a bite of that CHICKEN FRIED STEAK.... so delicious with the crispy, crunchy outside and the juicy inside all covered in a savory sauce. When my friends, the ones who ordered the steak and eggs, saw it, they regretted their order and wished they ordered the same dish as me. They were so jealous. My eggs were cooked over-easy just the way I ordered, which makes me very, very happy (I like dipping my toast in the yolk).   Furthermore, I'm a \"Yay! I'm a fan\" with this place becasue of their service. Joey was very considerate of my friends who were out of it and were trying their best to eat if they could. In the end, we asked for a couple of extra bags to bring in the car just in case. Instead, he came out with several bags and a hand full of napkins in case anything happens in the car with them throwing up and all. Really great person.",

I particularly like the Wild Turkey Sandwich, with a side of slaw (in lieu of fries) for $11.99.  It's a turkey sandwich on grilled sourdough, both cheddar and jack cheese, mushrooms, 1000 island dressing, and a lil kick with some jalapenos.  Yum!  Make sure to bring your Rockstar player's card with you to get the late night specials (12am-8am), which include steak and eggs ($4.99), or a \"burger basket\" ($3.99).  I haven't had the burger basket yet, but you just about get what you pay for with the steak and eggs.  Regardless; great late night drunk munchies.  Tip: Check out the off-the-menu \"Gambler's Special\"; which includes steak, shrimp, mashed potatoes, and salad for only $7.77.",

It's super laid back and the decor is very simple. It's a good thing they have rock and roll memorabilia scattered all over the walls and some nice plasmas posted to watch the game.   We came with the intent to get their $7.77 deal but somehow we ended up with salad, bbq wings and fries. My friends decided to share the chinese chicken salad and fries while I got the bbq wings. The waitress put enough thought into it and split the salad into two bowls to save us from the trouble of splitting it ourselves. We were very impressed! Too bad it didn't live up to their standards. They mentioned the dressing wasn't right for the salad. Definitely one of the worste salads they've ever had.  I was Mrs. Lucky because I was pretty happy with my bbq wings. It comes with celery and carrots so you can get your vegetable servings for the day. The wings were super meaty and the bbq sauce was sweet with a bit of a kick. The waitress mentioned their popular flavor was the \"wild than,\" but I didn't want to take my chances. I'm not down with Tabasco sauce if you know what I'm saying. Overall, it was a solid meal but we weren't entirely over the moon about this place. Come to Mr. Lucky's if you want to grab something cheap and fast.",

It's a decent place to chill before  heading out to party or gamble.  I used to frequent Las Vegas quite a bit and we used to come to the Hard Rock to chill. Had so many memories and some entertaining ones.  Like the time we were up all night in the wee hours of the morning seated and looking at our menu.  The next thing we know, I see a transvestite walking into the restaurant. Of course, my friends stare thinking it's a woman. Lol.. He/she meets ups up with a group of transvestites. While we're ordering, the next thing we hear are glasses being thrown and tables being knocked over. That's right, a transvestite brawl!! One was on the floor holding back the other preventing the other from stabbing him/her with a butter knife.  Security came in time to break it all up.   Or that time when we saw some drunk guy wearing his shirt backwards but wearing it like a crop top and wandering side to side and double fisting his Bud Lights.  Or the time we were rolling dice on the crapps table with Bruce Willis.  I miss those days...",

The first day I had the 'Rehab' breakfast, with a spinach & mushroom omelette and fresh squeezed OJ.  The omelette was barely edible, with the thick overcooked eggs (I sub'd real eggs for egg whites), and nasty unsalted spinach. The fresh squeezed OJ was excellent though.  2nd day I had the eggs over easy with hash browns and grilled ham.  The eggs were decent, but the hash browns had way too much butter (or margarine?), and the ham was well, ham, with grills marks to boot.  3rd day I had the chicken noodle soup, opting to avoid any more wasted calories at this joint.  The puny bowl came with an overly generous serving of celery, onion, and carrots, with few chicken and even fewer noodles, maybe 3 noodles total.  Do not eat here, even if you're drunk.",

Even wasted I remember the nachos to be soooo deliciously spicy and smothered with melted cheese and chunks of chicken.  My mouth was on fire after a few nachos and I can normally handle my spice!

Much better, but I had a bagel and my husband had the corned beef hash which was great.  The orange juice was really good too, but pretty pricey ($4.75?/small glass).

When we got there, there was no sign to wait to be seated, no one at the front, so we sat down.  We then asked another couple after waiting about 5 minutes, if we sat down or wait to be seated.

    "text": "Mr Luckys, located inside the Hard Rock Hotel (use the new parking lot on Harmon) has been there for me for over 5 years with consistently well-made food and a familiar but diverse menu.  Many visitors are fans of the $7.77 steak and shrimp special or the $9.99 all you can eat prime rib.  Personally, I prefer to venture away from the specials here because there are so many gems tucked away throughout the offerings.  The Fire-roasted chicken nachos would be just another order of good chicken nachose except for the cheese sauce - in my lifetime i havent found a finer queso. Its heat comes from the fire-roasted peppers and its creaminess versus most heavier cheese sauces makes it a great appetizer (most nachos ruin the meal for me).  Dont hesitate to explore the apps - there's not a wrong call in the bunch and the diversity allows you to create some interesting sampler platters (build-your-own).  You cant go wrong with a burger or pizza, but I've found myself at Lucky's at 3am more often than not, so breakfast is usually my urge, and the all american breakfast plate always satisfies.  For the meat, request the apple chicken sausage and youll find out what makes this breakfast special versus so many in Vegas.  Finally, dont leave unless you order a coffee and chocolate shake (i usually order one with my drink to get an early start).  The service is almost always on point, but the Hard Rock gets busy a LOT so try not to go after shows, after the clubs let out, or on weekend nights if youre in any hurry.  Atmosphere-wise, there are a number of tvs over the diner counter, Americana,especially Vegas-themed, scattered about the walls, and the casino is right outside and open for you to watch the gamblin' fiends.  The price is casino-average, with most meals costing 10-15 each.  Last i checked, Lucky's is on <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> and you can get a certificate for $25 off of $35.  For you travelers, the Hard Rock is conveniently located near the airport and a fairly cheap cab ride in... make this your first and/or last stop in Vegas!",

My second piece was very different, quite dry, and not too tender. These cuts were also very different in size. So this lack of consistency is definitely what will hold this place back. Another problem I had was that they didn't have any beers on tap, which is a BIG problem in my opinion. How can you not have ANY beers on tap?   So for the value I give 3 stars, but as far as the food goes, nothing to write home about. 3 stars.",

Like all the other big casino diners, Mr. Lucky's is too brightly lit, too loud, too crowded, and too impersonal to give them 5 stars.  It is one of those, \"it is what it is,\" situations.  They have meticulously studied flows, and patterns, and they are designed to serve the maximum number of people in the space available with extreme efficiency.  That does not generally make for a happy or pleasant place to eat, but Mr. Lucky's seems to have a slightly happier staff than most of the other casinos, and if you push them, you can break them away from their script for a sentence of human conversation or appreciation.    I LOVE the 7/7/7.   Despite the micro managing of the staff there are still common restaurant errors, wrong drink, messed up order, not cooked to order, missing item, the usual restaurant errors.  I saw an error one night that was truly gross, but ALL RESTAURANTS make these mistakes.   So, Mr. Lucky's is too brightly lit, too loud, too impersonal, but it is one of my favorite bargain casino diners in Vegas.  Oh, and they have the best music.  Duh, Hard Rock.",

The first visit was my first morning here I sat at the counter and ordered 2 eggs sunny side up with bacon and hash browns. The rye bread was a marble rye and served with an assortment of jellies and butter. I asked the server why two prices for everything on the menu. He told me if I go to the cash office in the casino they will give me a card for free and I can collect points as well as get discounts. So while my breakfast was cooking I ran over to get the card.   My breakfast came up quickly and was delicious. Especially the hash browns cooked to perfection and seasoned just right. This was a 5. However my last morning here I came with my husband we were in a rush I ordered the french toast my favorite that was coated in corn flakes. It was awful the only thing that helped was lots of syrup. My husband had the croissant breakfast sandwich. Breakfast with tip and discount card was expensive at nearly $50. I would come here if I was staying here at the hotel but not worth a trip other wise.",

We have read the reviews for this restaurant and we wanted to try it. They are open 24 hours.  We arrived at the place around 10:40 p.m. The hostess informed us to get the Player's Card to get discount for their dinner and credit for gambling at the Casino.  My wife and I decided to have Mr. Lucky's famous Gambler's Special. I asked the waiter about this special and he informed that in order to get this special, a drink must also be ordered with the meal. He informed us that the meal consists of a piece of steak, mashed potatoes, and green beans.  The steak was decent size, but not too generous! Both our pieces were tough to chew. Our green beans were undercooked, almost raw, making them also tough to chew. The mashed potatoes were OK, not too great but not bad either. The normal price of the Gambler's Special is $9.99 but you get a $2.00 discount with the Player's Card.  For this night, our experience at Mr. Lucky's 24-7 was a less than average one. If we find ourselves in Las Vegas again, we may give Mr. Lucky's 24-7 another chance.",

Its not as busy as i remember it anymore. They changed there menu and renovated the look of the restaurant.    We ordered the poutine fries which were good but the gravy was salty and then just kept it simple with a decent  buffalo chicken wrap.   The service was quick, water was always refilled and the check was quickly presented and processed. Nice to know they are back on their game.",

The place was mostly empty, it's usually a hit or miss spot depending on what time you go there. We just went for a few drinks and a quick snack before going out.   The server was nice, he was quick and had a good personality. The drinks were good & cold. The problem came with the food.   We ordered sliders and their disco fries. The sliders come with 3, with cheese, caramelized onions pickles and thousand Island dressing. They're $12.99 and came out cold. Even though they tasted ok (not really good) I had concerns about the food temperature, because food poisoning is not fun.   The disco fries were atrocious! The description makes them *sound* fantastic. For $8.99, it's \"supposed\" to be French fries smothered in gravy, cheese, and bacon. They came out cold dry and looked old! (See attached picture.   We won't be back.",

Once I checked in with the hostess she advised that I should head to the back counter and someone would help with my order. I would say I went unacknowledged about five minutes. When I finally was greeted it was by a \"busser\" who brought water. I let him know I was looking to place a Take Out order, he stated someone should be with me soon.  I would say I waited another few minutes and was greeted by a waitress who took my order. I got small sirloin burgers, chicken strips, sausage gravy and biscuits and a side of fries. That totaled about 42$ which didn't surprise me for hotel food.   My issue was the fact that my Sausage gravy literally had NO SAUSAGE. The burgers were the only thing truly edible.The chicken strips were over cooked.   I enjoy the variety this menu had to offer but the service was slow and many of the staff were standing around talking to one another instead of providing timely service. They even had someone not on the clock walking behind the counter.  Overall the food was OK but I won't be going back again. Which makes me kind of sad because I really wanted to try this crazy hangover bloody mary they have on the menu.. It has a slim jim and deviled egg in it..haha",

    "text": "Ended up coming to Mr Lucky's 24-7 (located inside the Hard Rock Hotel) because the restaurant we had originally made dinner reservation was no more.  I did not mind coming here, since I have never heard of them before and will be a new restaurant to try.  Boy, I am glad that we ended up here at the HRH's version of an all night cafe.  Because their off the menu specials, which everyone at the table all know about (except me), are some of the better deals for Las Vegas.  $9.99 AYCE Prime Rib (comes with mashed potatoes and steamed vegetables).  The prime rib was tasty, and definitely one of the top meal bargains in all of LV. And compared to the $3 sodas, the value proposition is a no brainer.  If that is not your cup of tea, they have $7.77 Steak and Shrimp.  Pretty cheap for what you are getting.  Again, definitely an attractive offer for those saving their money for other expenditures (gaming, alcohol, etc.).  Mr. Lucky's 24/7 now features two new graveyard specials for guests to enjoy daily from midnight to noon.  * New York Steak & Eggs - 8 oz NY Steak, two eggs, hash browns and toast for $4.99 or $6.99 (without Rockstar Players Club card)  * Burger Basket - classic old-school burger and French fries for $3.99 or $5.99 (without Rockstar Players Club card)   Besides these specials, they also have a diverse line-up of food that is on the menu, from Breakfast, Chinese, to Burgers and Pizza.  Definitely something for just about anyone, at a low-end price range for a major LV casino property.  Service was good, considering how busy the place is.  Never had to remind them about refills, getting seconds on the prime rib was fast.    Convenient and fairly accessible location, even for tourists.  Price is excellent.  Food overall was good.  A trifecta of winning combination sure to please guests of Mr. Lucky's 24-7.  Yay! I'm a fan!!!  4 stars.",

What came out was a massive plate of food to include eggs, hashbrowns, toast, and a huge cut of meat deep fried and slathered with gravy. I honestly only ate half of it before I was stuff and felt like I left a huge portion on the plate.  Top notch.",

I ate the eggs benny even though the eggs were over cooked and the hollandaise sauce was horrible, but sent the prime rib back.  I asked the waitress if their prime rib was good before ordering it, she lied.  It was the worst piece of beef I had ever received eating out, anywhere.  I've had better prime rib at local greasy spoon diners.  It was tough, and flavorless.  Even the mashed potatoes were trash.  Who screws up mashed potatoes?    They should just close this joint along with the rest of the renovations going on at the Hard Rock.  Pink Taco and Culinary Drop Out are much better eateries at the hotel.",

Be sure to get that.   The first time was shortly after our arrival. We were pretty hungry and this seemed like a good quick fix. Had the $10.99 prime rib and shrimp special. It was pretty good. I have definitely paid more for worse prime rib. They also give you three decently sized shrimp that appear to have been cooked on a flat top with a nice little crust. Be sure to get the creamy horseradish to round it out.   Second time there was for a quick breakfast prior to heading to the airport. I had the pancakes for $9.99. It's a stack of 4 enormous pancakes. The vanilla butter it comes with is a must do. The menu says it comes with maple syrup, but I'm pretty sure it was table syrup. Nonetheless, pretty tasty. Coffee was a bit steep at $3.99 but whatever. At least they had soy milk.   Overall, great option for some solid, fairly priced diner food. Everything came out pretty quick, and service was friendly.",

    "text": "It was our getaway day and we had an hour for breakfast...plenty of time to eat, grab our bags, check out, and catch our flight.  The restaurant was crowded with early risers wanting breakfast or other who were looking for something to eat after a hard night of clubbing before going to bed.  Still, we were seated immediately.    We ordered and received water and coffee (Mr. Lucky's still serves it up in a huge mug!)...and then we waited...and waited for our food order to be taken.  Roughly, 15 minutes later our server took our order.  I had the Waffle Wich, two scrambled eggs, ham, applewood smoked bacon, cheddar cheese, with sweet & spicy mayo sandwiched between two Belgian waffle halves and served with a side of hash browns.  Carol W ordered the California Omelet, a three-egg omelet with avocado, tomatoes, artichoke hearts, quinoa, onion sprouts, tomato, and mushrooms folded in and served with a side of hash browns and toast.  We noted that despite a nearly full dining room, we didn't see a lot of food coming out of the kitchen.  We waited...and waited...causing me to wonder if we'd have time to eat without inhaling our food.  Almost 20 minutes later our food arrived, and as expected, it was a big plate of food.  The contents of my Waffle Wich were bountiful, savory, cheesy, and filling.  The waffles were light and fluffy, but were also just plain Belgian waffles, lacking that \"something\" like sweetness that would've provided a contrast with the savoriness of the other components.  Perhaps a bit of maple syrup served on the side?  I should've asked for it.  I ended up eating everything but the waffles.  Carol's omelet, though, was delicious and definitely the better of our two selections.  Thankfully, getting and paying for our check went much quicker than getting our food.     The lifespan of casino restaurants, even the 24/7 places, is often quite brief.  Mr. Lucky's has been a veritable pillar within the Hard Rock since it opened in 1995, providing a constant and consistent dining experience throughout the casino's existence.  Prices have noticeably gone up over the years and service can be hit or miss, but I can't imagine this place changing much otherwise in its next 18 years.  Fine dining, it ain't, but Mr. Lucky's still provides decent value with its generous portions and relatively tasty fare.",

There's also a military discount but depending on the person serving you they may not honor that. I think because it's a hassle to get a manager to do it for them. Other than that, the food is top notch and usually sized well above your needs, so order accordingly.",

I went with the breakfast sausage the other time, it was extremely greasy and mushy, it melts in your mouth but not in a good way.  The best part was substituting the toast for fruit.

    "text": "They call it Mr. Lucky's @ HRH (Hard Rock Hotel).  More like \"Mr. Lucky for us it was opened at 7am in the morning!\" Nothing spectacular but from a quality perspective, an order of \"chicken fried steak & eggs\" after an evening & morning of heavy drinking was very satisfying.  Keep in mind, there were only 1-2 staff working at that time in the morning so don't expect customer service to be at the top of its game, however, it was good enough for us. During the day and early evening there's usually a full complement of staff on hand.  Price wise, there are some good deals and there are a variety of selections to choose from. Some ask, is it pricey? Well, it is Vegas you know. The venue itself is clean and a definite plus is the fact it is located within HRH which makes it convenient.  As far as seating goes, they can accommodate table and booth seating for larger groups.   Definitely consider Mr. Lucky's after an eventful evening at Body English or a day at REHAB.",

The first night we went about 2am we got seated right away and had quick service. Food was so so, my only gripe about my first visit was the cheese fries. Instead of using shredded or even regular cheddar cheese, they used nacho cheese which made the fries really soggy and gross. All the plates we ordered were large in size and had to take to go boxes for our food.  The second time we ate here it was during Rehab. We had called the front desk to ask what the dress code was cause we were just wearing swimsuits. Front desk put us on hold to probably ask someone who knew how to answer the question better and was told that dress code wasn't enforced until 6pm. So that being said we showed up to Mr. Lucky's to only be turned away because we were in swim suits and we were required to wear bottoms. It's one thing to let us know hey sorry there's a dress code and it's actually enforced all day long rather than giving us a dirty look up and down saying \"front desk doesn't know anything. It's been the same rule for like...forever.\"  All effin right beezy! No need for the attitude! So I suggested for her to get in contact with front desk to let them know the rules so that they aren't misinforming hotel guests and yet I got another smug look.  Yet she continued the attitude and was trying to shoo us away when another waitress came up and offered us to order to go. The nasty waitress with the 'tude was pretty snappy when I asked for my cheese fries to have shredded cheese instead of nacho cheese \"we always serve it with shredded cheese\" and I quickly served her back with \"well that's not what we were served last night!\"  Anyways besides my rant, everyone else seemed pleasant but like I said Mr. Lucky's is only good because it's convenient and cheaper than the other restaurants Hard Rock Hotel has to offer.",

The steak was flavorless, dry, and small. The mashed potatoes were taste-less as well. And they did NOT have gravy. Shrimp was OK. Salad was lacking French dressing as an option.  It's cheap, and you don't find cheap meat options near the strip. I'll go back and try the prime rib. Service was fairly quick. Waitresses were dressed very skanky. They were there every few minutes to check in, very nice.  It was $7.77 for the steak. I guess I got what I paid for, but I'd rather sit in an incredibly smoky Ellis Island for their great steak.",

The steak and mashed potatoes were mediocre, but for $7.77, you don't expect the taste of fine dining.  Other than the $7.77 deal, everything else on the menu is over priced.  I really enjoyed the duck appetizer for $15.  It was a good sized portion ( half a duck).  I would order it as an entree.",

The next day, I had the Salmon Rice Bowl, which was very nice.  The portion is not huge, but a good size, perfect for lunch.

This deal works if 1. your waiter is nice and doesn't ask you for your Hard Rock member club card. (or else it's 9.99)  or 2. if you have an HR member club card.  For that price, it def wasn't bad, but don't expect it to taste like a Donovan's steak.  The mashed potatoes were yummy though. haha",

This place seems to cater to that crowd the most.  The food is okay and the service is polite but neither one are worthy of the prices they charge here. Viva Las Vegas, right? Like I said, the restaurant is open all hours and they offer a full service menu of diner-style food such as burgers, fries, sandwiches, and they serve breakfast 24/7.   I ordered the Pepper Steak & Fries which is a grilled t-bone with sauteed bell peppers in marinara sauce with French fries on the side. It was alright but not worth the money I paid. For $26, a steak shouldn't taste like it was fried on a hot plate in a trailer park somewhere.  Our server was a friendly, high-energy guy with lots of drive. He re-filled my Coke three times without my asking him to. Me made us feel welcome and stopped by several times to see if we needed anything else. He's too good for this place.  Mr. Lucky's is a loud busy atmosphere too. If you want a quiet dinner, this ain't the place. They have an open kitchen and a wide open view of the casino floor which allows for a lot of people watching if you're into that.",

I ordered the Eggs Benedict, the portions were small. The small portion of hash browns they give was a little ridiculous, maybe about 5 bites.

You'll want to have a big appetite and or be prepared to bring a doggie bag home since the portions are quite large. The restaurant is open air right near the casino floor. So if you are sensitive to noise or casino smoke smell, you may want to ask to be sat further back in the restaurant. The food is so good that the average person wouldn't be bothered by ambiance or noise though.",

When I told the manager there they said they were going to take a report but after the security asked me if I needed to go to the hospital I said no not yet. And manager and security just walked away and that was the end of their concern. DO NOT EAT HERE!  They are not investigating the food born illness in their kitchen.",

    "text": "I came here earlier today for lunch after I walked out of Pink Taco because of poor service.  Here, the service is always fast and friendly!  Earlier today, It took 10 minutes total from walking in to receiving the nachos I ordered.  The downside was that the nachos were very American, which equates to gross for someone who has lived in San Diego for over a decade.  $18 for nachos with steak that did not taste much like steak.  To Lucky's credit, it's huge and will easily feed 2 people.  That said, I come here often and most of the food is good, especially the breakfast me he and the prime rib dinner, which only cost $18 and rivals what I've had at fine dining restaurants.   I came back here again this evening to have the \"boneyard special\", which is steak, eggs, hash browns, and toast (I declined this item), which was delicious.  The best part: this entree was only $7.77 if you buy any drink with it.  It was around $9.59 if you buy it without the drink, so you might as well get what is equivalent to a free drink.  Delicious. The downside: this desk is only available from midnight till 6am.  Overall, I recommend this place for breakfast, lunch and dinner.  I would never suggest you go out of your way to eat here if you are not staying at Hard Rock, but this place has excellent service, above average food for a reasonable price, and it's open 24/7!",

I ordered the create your own with lots of veggies and a couple protein choices. The omelet was so full with ingredients and left me completely satisfied. The fruit was fresh and delicious too. The coffee was just okay but the OJ was yummy. Next time I'll order the Breakfast Bloody Mary (jumbo shrimp, beef jerky stick, deviled egg, waffle slider with sausage, bacon, and cheddar cheese, and a pickle spear). It looked amazing! The servers and staff were nice everyday. Eat at Lucky's!",

In all seriousness, it was great having a place that was not only open 24/7, and was not only in incredibly close proximity to our hotel room, but a place that also served amazing food.   I ordered the Prime Rib French Dip. The sandwich was a decent size, with a more than decent amount of both Prime Rib and Provolone cheese inside. The meat tasted fantastic, and the sandwich as a whole was very delicious. The fries on the side were enough to feed two people, and the au jus was good enough to drink, which I did.   The service wasn't great. Our waitress did not look happy at all. I can understand not liking the midnight ship, but at least fake a smile.

First things first, get in line and get your hand stamped so you're at least 'in' already to the concert.  Now it's time to grub!  Thanks to Erik S. for mentioning Mr. Lucky's $7.77 Steak and Shrimp meal, it was an easy sell to the Husband and our friend.  With no wait, we got our orders in right away.  (I looked at the menu just in case and couldn't find this special, but I asked about it and it's there!)  We all started off with a side salad and then our steak arrived with three shrimps on a skewer, mashed potatoes and drawn butter.  (Yeah, the container for the butter was dark, so we all were dipping our beef in there before realizing it's butter!)  Our steaks were cooked as we liked it, rare, and service was efficient.  One really can't complain about a full meal for that price!  (And I have definitely paid more money for a lot less - quantity and quality!)    They are busy, especially when events are going on, but your food comes out in a timely manner, and it's not hard to wave down a busboy for a refill.  Up next - their AYCE $9.99 prime rib special from 4 pm to 4 am.  (Myke R.- you down?)",

I'm a big fan of all day breakfast, and will order it at all chances if given the opportunity.  Mr. Lucky's is a old school diner in the casino (think johnny rockets, just crappier).  The casino actually has about 5 some odd restaurants, but I think this is the only one open at weird hours.  One thing I always get at breakfast is pouched eggs (cause I like them).  The thing that kinda bugs me about some restaurants is that they steam them into this little perfect briquette of a egg.  This is NOT how to poach an egg...  I mean, how hard is it to boil water with vinegar in it?  I also got the ham.  The piece of ham I got was about 1.5cm thick.  Seriously gigantic in terms of breakfast portions.  Apparently this is where you get ham steaks in vegas at breakfast.  All in all with the price through the roof (it is vegas...) and the mediocre food, I'd probably recommend going somewhere else.  There's a coffee shop that has sandwiches on the other side of the casino.  Go there... end of story.",

First time I had the kung pao shrimp, I wasn't all that impressed, I've definitely had better. My accomplices had the steak sandwich (which she said was fab), french dip (another fab), veggie burger (ditto), and veggie omlette (ditto again).  So I was kind of disappointed by my choice when everyone else seemed to love theirs.  Second trip around, I had the potato skins appetizer, it probably set me back a few lbs on my diet, but it was worth it!  Or was it?  I also dipped into JM's chocolate fudge sundae, which was not that great, I honestly prefer the one at McD's.  My other girlfriend had an omlette, with the hugest serving of hashed browns I've ever seen (I should have let my fork wander over to her plate but I was too full from the skins).  Thrid trip before we left for home, one of the gals and I decided to stop in for a quick bite.  She ordered that french dip again, and I did the same... I asked to sub cole-slaw for the fries.  It turned up with fries.  (strike 1).  Sloppy waiter (Nicholas Cage look-a-like), wasn't very careful bringing the plates out and spilled the aus jus all over, so I had soggy bread.  (strike 2).  First bite.  (strike 3!).  I don't see how it can be so different from the other night when my girlfriend said it was delish.  They were pretty slow at dinner time too.  The only really good thing about this place was that it was convenient, being located in our hotel, and open all day and all night.",

We asked for the \"steak and shrimp special\" and off he went. In no time our salads, with the dressing on the side, and our drinks were on the table. Not too long after we finished our salads our food was brought out. Our waiter did appear to be really busy, but we didn't hurt for it. My husband who would have needed a refill got one before he even thought about mentioning it to anyone.  The food: Salad: nothing special. It was just lettuce, 2 cherry tomatoes, and croutons. But the lettuce was green and tasty, the tomatoes were perfect and juicy, and the croutons were crunchy.  The shrimp: 3 of them were just grilled. If any spices were used on them, it was subtle and did not come through. It was plain shrimp, and for the price, no complaints.  The steak: Wonderful! We both got ours medium and it was flavorful and tender!   The potatoes: Yummy. Nothing very amazing, but definitely yummy. Not lumpy, just smooth with a good flavor.   And all for $7.77 plus the cost of whatever you got to drink.   We enjoyed our experience. Only reason it only got 4 stars is that, well, in Vegas, I usually expect really high quality food. This was good quality what I ate. And definitely could make Dallas restaurants run for their money for the price!",

While most of the carnivore fare isn't that great, they do serve a decent veggie burger and fries as well as a huge spinach salad for people looking for a hit of B Vitamins without a metric ton of saturated animal fat.

Being a former hostess myself, I get annoyed at stuff like this. I'm standing there with look on my face like \"Hi, Im here to be seated. Soo....lets get a move on, people.\" Finally after a few seconds, they decided to turn around and acknowledge me. GOOD JOB!  So we sat down and looked through the menu...  Tuna Poki- Horrible. Had no flavor. The crackers it came with can dry out the Atlantic Ocean. The menu description boasted and said it was amazing. I was disappointed.  Batola Pasta- Was pretty good, I guess. Nothing amazing. I specifically told the waitress that I don't eat spicy food so she offered to tell them not to put pepper flakes in it. I get my plate and LOOK whats in it! PEPPER FLAKES! Awesome! ....ugh...  Steak- The steak was just like any other steak, the mashed potatoes was just like any other mashed potatoes ,...eh moving on.  The Sliders- Not bad, Nothing amazing, but not bad. Jack In The Box sliders were better, to be honest.  Nachos- Pretty much the saving grace of this place. It was actually pretty good. HUGE!  So yeah, sorry, this place doesnt do it for me.

Thankfully the salty, dirty au jus, which had been sitting simmering somewhere all day long, was there to soak up some of the dry. But, the fries my friend - no excuse. Boooo I say, just boooo.",

    "text": "My husband and I had the unfortunate experience of trying Mr. Lucky's again after a long time away...  We heard things had improved, so we thought why not?  Here is why not:  I ordered the chicken fried steak and my husband got the breakfast skillet.  After some time, I saw a plate of chicken fried steak on the counter under a hot lamp.  After ten minutes more, I asked and was told by our waitress that is wasn't my meal.  Well, after another five to seven minutes, my husband's dish was put next to it.  Low and behold it was my order.  The eggs I asked for 'over medium' were sunny side up and the yolks were hard (my husband's were the same).  The steak itself was cold and the meat grey, the potatoes were cold and undercooked, and the sausage gravy had congealed on the top.  The toast wasn't even browned and was simply dried out bread.  Both meals were awful to look at and worse to eat.   We even had to ask for refills on our soda after sitting with empty glasses.  Did I mention we were sitting at the counter where we could see everything and they could see our empty glasses?  This is not the Mr. Lucky's of the 'good old days'.  We live in Vegas and are at the Hard Rock every weekend.  This is not the first time we've had bad service and sub par food, however it is the last, despite the fact that our meal was comped.  Don't believe the hype; things have not changed since it started going seriously downhill over a year ago.  Reduced menu options, staff with bad attitudes, awful food, long wait times, and no cohesive management...",

    "text": "Mr. not So Lucky!! So I'm currently staying at the Hard Rock hotel and had a bit of a sweet tooth going on so I decided on the chocolate cake from here. Wow what a disappointment. First I will start off stating that the gentleman who took my order was very pleasant and quick with order. I ordered to chocolate cake without even looking at the menu. I wish I had because then I would have maybe seen that they add nuts to the cake and I would have ask for the slice without it. Anyways I get back to my room and break out the cake and after the first bite it was downhill. The cake itself was extremely extremely dry. The kind of dryness that comes from a cake made days ago and has been sitting out in exposed air....going forward I figured its just that part of the cake, but no it wasn't. I took a total of 5 bites throughout different parts of the cake all with the same disappointment. The only moist textured pieces of the cake were locked in between the frosting by even the flavor was lacking. Sadling I've had better chocolate cakes from home and my local grocery store equivalent to the price of and entire cake for a about dollars more. $8 buck and change plus a $2 tip for a Togo order that required little effort was an absolute waste of my money. Its sad that my first impression of this restaurant is tainted by a slice of cake, bit if the rest of their food taste anything close to that horribly tasting cake I'll pass. Mr. lucky I know my one comment is not going to make or break you, bit I do hope you rethink the chocolate cake, the baker, or the recipe to something more better tasting and worth the $8 your charging. If I wasnt so tired I would have taken the cake back downstairs and asked for my money back..",

I would at least give it an \"A-OK\" 3 stars for that but geez it runs high in price for the level of average you taste.  I had their feta cheese burger with their spicy fries and the fries came out cold.  These are just frozen shoestring bag type fries where they dump Tabasco sauce and spicy mayo on top.  Even with the replacement batch there were only a few that were edible.    My friend ordered the Hard Rock Breakfast which was your typical breakfast stuff like bacon, eggs and hash browns--at a cost of $15.  It too was really forgettable and overpriced.  The only good thing going for Mr. Lucky's is the fact that it is open 24/7, a handy thing when you are spending time at a type of casino like The Hard Rock.",

Open 24/7 to satisfy that late night after party hunger, or that mid afternoon hangover you are nursing after a night out that you can barely recall. Mr. Lucky's is there to take care of you with a fusion menu of American and Chinese offerings. Even the prices are not too painful considering it's in a casino where most things are overpriced.  After the concert at The Joint last night I was starving so we made the no-brainer decision to hit Mr. Lucky's and glad we did. They serve breakfast all night and I went right for thee \"Rehab\" Breakfast - healthy style which I appreciated! It included scrambled egg whites with mushrooms, sauteed spinach, sliced vine-ripened tomatoes, lettuce, and a choice of bread or English muffin. The eggs were cooked just right and there was a lot on the plate. Along with whole wheat toast and a huge cup of coffee this hit the spot.  They also have a few late night specials which are not usually on the menu - a \"secret\" $7.77 steak and eggs that is pretty darn good that I had a few times, and a $9.99 all you can eat prime rib deal which starts at 12 midnight. Who says you can't eat good for cheap in Vegas anymore?  Service is cheery and attentive with some cute waitresses. This place is a scene for late night people watching, and kinda fun especially after a big concert lets out. Sure, it's a glorified diner, but where else can you listen to great rock music while chowing down? Rock on! \\m/",

For my first trip, I went there for the off-the-menu $9.99 ayce prime rib, but we had to take round one to go and call it a night due to some overly drunk friends.   In either case, the prime rib was fantastic, even though it was cold and eaten an hour after it was served. It blows Carrow's $9.99 prime rib out of the water (yes, I go to Carrow's, it's a cheap and quick fix for prime rib cravings- don't judge me). My sister, who regulars the place for this special, explained that while the prime rib is ayce, the sides are not. Therefore, if you like sides, you should ration them out as long as you'll need them.   The sides weren't that special. Veggies, mostly- green beans and squash. However, the potatoes were heavenly.   I must add that my to-go portion was eaten without utensils as we failed to ask for them with our meal... still worth it.   My second trip was the night after as I was searching for a sandwich. The turkey club with chipotle mayo did the trick. It was topped off with a delicious apple pie that, for a crust person like me, didn't overload me with toppings.   I will say the the place looked and felt cooler and more \"happening\" after drinks, rather than stone cold sober (duh?), but it's still a good spot.",

I was very very very disappointed with Mr. Lucky's.  I went there around 11:30pm, because I needed a quick dinner after getting out of a late night meeting. After the hostess sent me to the counter for a take out order, literally FIVE WAITERS COMPLETELY PASSED ME BY, apparently because I wasn't in their section. I finally had to flag someone down and ask to place an order and they still passed the buck to someone else.  When I finally was able to place an order, I ordered a steak medium rare. It came very well done. IT WAS DISGUSTING. The mashed potatoes accompanying it were also terrible.  I used to think that the off-the-menu \"Gambler's Special\" was a good deal. (You can look it up with a quick internet search.) However, even that is no longer anything worth trying. You must have a casino player's card, order a drink, and their steak is horrible anyway.

    "text": "Great food, even better people watching.   We have stayed at the Hard Rock for the last 5-6 years annually while we attend a convention in LV (no, not that one;-)) each January.  We have really come to appreciate and love Mr. Lucky's 24-7.   We eat breakfast there each morning during the show, plus, dinner or a late meal at least two additional times.  Total, were in the restaurant 5-7 times during each convention.  I normally order the same thing each morning which is the egg white Rehab Omelette.  It's fantastic, and really a healthy option when you'll be on your feet all day.  It's full of mushrooms, broccoli, green onion, and tomato, plus a large slice of avocado on top, and either hash browns or fresh fruit and toast on the side.  At dinner time, I have tried almost everything else on the menu. All of which have been delicious.    The real star of Mr. Lucky's 24/7 is the location. Located just off, and open to the main casino, the people watching is 2nd to none in the city.  This is especially True during the \"other\" convention that is actually being hosted in the hotel.  It's just never boring and we could sit there all night watching.  So much fun.",

    "text": "Staying at the Hard Rock Hotel. When planing your days and nights of debauchery is it a good idea to find the always open eatery. Here we had Mr. Lucky's 24/7.  I ended up grabbing breakfast here to take back to the room. Pretty much your normal breakfast diner food set up. Sticky menus and greasy food are sometimes just what you are looking for.   I ordered the oatmeal and a stack of pancakes. The oatmeal was fine with a small side of brown sugar. The pancakes were better. Huge stack of 4 that were about the size of the plate. Sweet buttermilk and butter on top hit the spot after waking up to a hungry tummy.    If I hadn't taken my order to go I would have definitely dined in. The restaurant is spacious and looked nice looking out to there casino for some people watching. Speaking of - name drop alert - David Spade was there eating when I stopped by. Vegas Baby! Ahem anyways the food is good and available. Service was decent and prices didn't gouge me too much for hotel food. Get and use your Backstage Pass players card to save some $$.",

The salty pretzels that are supposed to be hard were soggy and disgusting. The caramel popcorn at the top was stale. Complete waste of money. Definitely not worth it when the food poisoning kicked in later (although it's hard to tell whether it was from the shake or the disgusting wings.)  Would never dine here again",

The lady had biscuits and gravy with some fruit. The food wasn't bad but it wasn't dynamite either. The restaurant is convenient because it's the only place open in the hotel before 11am.

Between Mr. Lucky's and Pink taco my husband and I have had to put up with hostesses with awful dispositions & bartenders that feel like they can't be bothered doing their job.   (Keep in mind we have been coming to the place & staying at the hard rock for our vacations since 2012)  My husband and I decided to come to Mr. Luckys for breakfast, upon arrival there was no one at the hostess station for atleast 20 minutes because the \"gentleman\" was gossiping with one of the waiters. When he realized we were stand there waiting to be seated he treated us with silence and a dirty look. When we said good morning and smile at him he didn't even acknowledge it what so ever , not even a smile, he just ask \" how many? \".    Then turned around and said \" yea, so I'm sitting you guys at these tables by the casino\" mean while the entire restaurant was open wand filled with empty tables. When I expressed to him that my husband and I would like a seat inside the empty restaurant he picked up the menus, looked up at the ceiling , rolled his eyes and sucked his teeth as if I was inconveniencing him. He then walked ahead of us put the menus on the table and walked away from us. I have never experienced such rudeness in a restaurant in my life.   Our waitress how ever was a complete gem !! So friend , polite and extremely attentive. I wish I knew her name (she was a pretty blonde older woman, I know she has been working there for a long time because I've seen her in 2012 when I first started coming here and every year after that )  When people go on vacation to get away from the bullshit of their real lives at home they don't want to deal with or be served by someone whom acts as if you are a burden to them, or better yet as if they loathe their job.",

The food itself was severely greasy and stodgy. Not a pleasurable meal at all.   Most of the tables we saw leave a massive amount of food due to the service/quality of the food.

My wife had never had prime rib before and I wanted to treat her without paying a arm & a leg at LAWRY'S. After jumping thru all the hoops to get there and being seated the waitress told us she \"was new\" and unfamiliar with the \"off-menu prime rib dinner\" but she would \"check on it\". Some dude showed up and told us the prime rib dinner was \"not available\". No explanation, just \"not available\"!   To be fair, MR. LUCKY'S may have an excellent menu and be a great place to eat but they should make it known to the public that they no longer serve their \"off-menu prime rib dinner\".     We wound up at LAWRY'S after all and after waiting almost 2 hours till they opened at 5pm, paid $83.50 (tip included) to share one of their prime rib dinners. Its been about 12 years since I have eaten here and the food is good but to a Vegas local like me, its hardly worth $100. For that kinda dough, I can get any cut of meat at my meat market and cook it myself for a fraction of eating at some overpriced \"tourist\" joint.   So today was a learning experience for me. I learned where NOT TO GO the next time I want a prime rib dinner. I miss those good old days of cheap food 30 years ago when I moved here.",

My roommate Adam and I wanted to try their new off-menu special, $9.99 all-you-can-eat prime rib.  We sat down amongst all the other concert-goers and were told after a long wait for a waiter that they were out of prime rib.  Really?  After a big show at the Joint you're going to be out of prime rib?  There was even a sign out front of the restaurant advertising it.  I wasn't pleased, but we dined there anyway.  Oh well.",

    "text": "Wow. this place is absolutely great, you can't beat AYCE Prime Rib for $9.99.  I think it's a max of 2, but still you get pretty damn full even off the first one. It's about a pound or something like that -- and you get the sides and salad. Probably one of the best budget dinners i've ever had in vegas, sh*t was amazing for the price.  The 7.77 is okay, it's not as huge as the prime rib but it comes with 3 pieces of shrimp or so.  For a smaller appetite...which obviously isnt mine.  The prime rib is just so good for the price and it tastes great.  The morning after though, i wouldnt say it was pleasant.",

I read about the $7.77 special and decided to go with that! The steak was ok, the shrimp was delicious, and it came with a salad so yaay for that. Can't really complain since it's so cheap! A bunch of people in my group ordered the chicken fried steak and oh boy THAT WAS SOOOO GOOOD!!! yum yum. I'd probably get that next time around. Next time we'll probably also go after 4pm so we can try out that AYCE prime rib special!",

    "text": "Every time we are around this area for a concert, or event, the first place we think about is Mr. Lucky's for their $9.99 all you can eat prime rib special. The first cut is always large, served with mashed potatoes, and a side of steamed veggies. The veggies are good enough to ask for seconds, but that is not part of the deal. After the first plate, you will begin to receive slimmer cuts of meat by itself. Truth be told, I am stuffed on the first serving alone, but I usually go for seconds to pretend like I'm getting my moneys worth.   The rest of the menu is over priced. Some friends will order burgers or corn beef hash, but I can never get myself to do so. Most of the time they seem less than thrilled with their orders which makes me want to veer off less.   The last time I went, the service was not satisfactory. Our server barely paid attention to us, probably because five out of seven of us ordered the special. Our drinks were not refilled in a timely manner, and everyone else around us looked to be higher priority. There have been times where we have received excellent service, but it seems hit or miss. Still a party of 7 with specials will get the bill to $70. If you provide good service, you will get a $14 tip. That is not something to frown upon.",

Great for a quick meal after a night of drinking. Do yourself a favor and try the breakfast quesadilla or the country fried steak and eggs, both are amazing, specially if you got that good buzzin from the night out. Service is ok, tell you the truth I don't even remember the staff, I just remember the menu and the food, and that's all it counts. So next time you're in the vicinity, and you're craving for a late night snack, make a stop at Mr. Lucky's and you won't be disappointed.",

So we decide to order something else since we already made the trip!    Typical bar/Denny's food. Nothing special.   The issue I had was the overall service and the location. The place is busy, I mean BUSY!  The was waited by one server another took our order. After 22 minutes, we got our food. We ordered a buffalo chicken flatbread and lamb sliders!    The flatbread was over sauced and salty. The chicken was a breaded chicken breast or strips, very dry and greasy. Only are half.   However the lamb sliders was decent, nice and juicy.   Never saw our sever again until we flagged her down for the check.   But the biggest reason I give it a one star is the hotel itself!  Never been to Hard Rock Casino before, WILL NEVER EVER STEP FORWARD IN IT AGAIN!  The place just has a creepy, dangerous vibe to it. Not to mention the smell of marijuana and people snorting some white powder-like substance in the ladies bathroom.   Avoid at all cost!  It's not worth the risk, hassle, and horrible service!",

Instead my server was pleasant and very helpful throughout the meal: from getting me signed up for Backstage so I could get the 777 special to making sure o had ample refills. Not sure on the complaints from earlier, as I stopped in at 1, when the place was fairly busy during lunch  The only reason I don't go full 5 stars here is because of Backstage. I understand that getting someone tracked in a customer service system is fairly standard for many places now, but it's sad to see a special like this hidden behind the wall of a memebr's club, even a free one. I'm definitely coming back as the meal for the price was more than a steal, just make sure to sign up Backstage before ordering!",

    "text": "Went last week during the week at 10pm and ordered the $7.77 steak and shrimp special. Slow service as only one waiter for the 5 tables occupied in the restaurant. Know before you go that the \"special\" to get you have to have a players club card or it's $2 more, BUT you have to order a \"drink\" of alcohol, soda, etc to get the special. So the soda adds almost $3 more onto the bill.  After 25 minutes we still didn't have our steaks and other tables around us that had come after us had been served, it was obvious that the waiter forgot to put our order in and said \"the medium well steak takes a little extra  time to cook\" which is not True. He just forgot to put in the order.  5 minutes our cold steaks were served. My \"medium well\" steak was tough and well done. Shrimp had no taste to it and garlic mashed potatoes were regular tasting potatoes with the skins. Waiter apologized for the wait and gave us free dessert. The bacon breakfast sundae was much better than the meal to be honest. It's served in a waffle cone with maple bacon ice cream and bacon strip on top.  To be honest a manager should have come by the table and apologized for the long wait and slow service.",

    "text": "Ok, so I've been to Las Vegas many many times. And, I have stayed at the Hard Rock and eaten at Mr. Lucky's multiple times. This time was such a disappointment! We usually order the French toast and a quesadilla. The French toast is usually really good, hot, crusted with corn flakes and crispy. The quesadilla is as expected, nothing spectacular but still good. This time I don't know WHAT was going on. First off after we sat down and told out waitress, Paulina we were not ready she walked away without saying anything (I'm sure working in a 24hr spot in Vegas is not easy but still there's no reason to be rude). After we figured out what we wanted and placed our orders we asked for lemons for our water. We waited approx 20 min for our food. During that time we never got our lemons, nor did Paulina check in on us. When the food did arrive, Abby brought it to us. She was very pleasant, asked if we needed anything extra (at that time we asked for our lemons we never received from almost 30 min prior) Abby, brought them, along with the rest of our food. Now let's get to the actual food in this story. The quesadilla was not hot, the cheese was not even melted. The temperature was just above the cheese crumbling. The French toast which is usually an unexpected bonus, was a total disappointment! It was barely room temperature and the flavor was completely off from what it usually is. After the disappointing food, we waited another 10 minutes (at least) to get our check ( from a different server) and ended up having to pay the bill at the front counter. Mind you it was not like the restaurant was anywhere near full. Abby, thanks for being a bright spot in a disappointing trip to Mr. Lucky's. Needless to say I will not be returning to this establishment any time soon!",

First of all, the service was horrible...it took literally forever to get water or even greeted by a server! They weren't even that swamped but no one paid any attention to our table for a good 15 minutes. I think we had to flag a few people down before our waiter came by. At least our food didn't take as long to come out but it still didn't make up for the sour first impression.  veggie burger ($9.95) - The patty was really thick and made with brown rice and chopped up veggies it seemed. Not what I was expecting at all and not in a good way! It also came with onion sprouts and some kind of mayo. The patty was kinda lukewarm in the middle and I didn't enjoy the taste much...blech. The multi-grain bun was good though and the fries were thick cut and well fried.

I thought cheap dinners like this would only be found in downtown Las Vegas.  The service was fast, the patrons who were there were eye candy- my guy friends can vouch for that, and the prime rib was soooo good. The mashed potatoes and the veggie which accompanied it was also good- but the mashed potatoes was better. I ordered my prime rib medium well and it was soft and juicy. Dipped in horseradish and au jus (sp?), it is the BOMB! I considered ordering a second plate like all of my other friends, but my clubbing dress wouldn't permit another plateful. I will definitely come back here again (with looser clothes on). And the best thing about it is that this yummy AYCE prime rib dinner is the same price of one drink at the bar.  Love it!",

Only in Vegas...  My friend and I were frequent visitors to Mr. Lucky's since it was the 24 hour diner located in the Hard Rock Hotel which is where we stayed Halloween weekend.  FOOD: *Hot & Sour Soup - Way too spicy *Chicken Noodle Soup - My perfect hangover cure *BBQ Bacon Cheeseburger - DELICIOUS and way more than I could eat so it was taken to go to eat as drunken food later on *Ham & Cheese Sandwich - Ohhh so yummy and filled with thinly sliced ham and gooey amounts of cheese  WHAT TO KNOW: *Breakfast food is served all day *Chinese food is only served until 2am - why I wanted Chinese food at 5am is beyond me *Apparently if you have one of those players' cards, steak and eggs will cost you only $3.99 (I saw the guy next to us order it).  SERVICE: The one time we dined here, our server was friendly.  He was also nice enough to take off the hot and sour soup that I thought was way too spicy.  The rest of the time, we ordered food to go to take back up to room and eat in bed.    To-go service is a bit slow.  They have you order at the counter.  While you're waiting, be sure to talk to random people, that's always fun.    Or if you can, if you're sober enough to call in your order, do so and you'll be able to pick your food up in about 10-15 minutes.",

    "text": "WHERE: Located inside the Hard Rock Hotel.  WHEN: Open 24 hours for all of you partiers!!  WHY: The Orleans is taxing way to much for their steak & eggs now!! I've heard it's about 7 bucks?! No way, Jose!  WHAT:  One of my friends has actually worked here for a couple of years, but she never mentioned all the amazing specials they had to offer!! The first and second time I sat down and ate, I remember having the quesadilla and a swiss sandwich! I did not have any complaints about the quality and quantity of the food or even the service!  A couple months passed, my friends and I happened to be in the vicinity for a concert, so we chose to stop by before the concert (we were too excited and had way too much time). Beforehand, I prepped myself and read reviews about the specials, and stumbled upon a review that mentioned the $7.77 steak & shrimp special!!  Right then and there, MY EYES LIT UP and I definitely had to see what I had been missing.  (Tangent- Don't you DISLIKE it when they ask you how rare or well you want your meat, and it comes out the opposite of what you had expected?! I definitely do, and the cooks at Mr. Lucky's proved me wrong! My steak came out perfect! Everything was great!)  The steak and shrimp special comes with a side salad and mashed potatoes or french fries. It was finger-licking good and worth every penny!! I was surprisingly back the next day! Haha!! Oh, and I cannot forget to mention how quick and great the service was, that deserves 5 stars!  *NOTE: There are also other specials such as the 3.99 burger box, and also for 9.99, you may eat as much steak as you want!!!  THANK HEAVEN FOR MR. LUCKY'S 24-7! ;)",

Most casinos have over priced food, especially nicer, boutique'esq hotels, but the Hard Rock has pretty decent prices for a cafe at the Hard Rock.   I've tried their breakfast and one of their burgers. Both had good flavors, and I didn't spend more than 10 bucks on each of them, I think about the $7-8 range, not bad.",

The food was nothing spectacular at all. The bun was hard and the fries were soggy. The decor around the place was cool, but that was the only thing good about this place. I wouldn't recommend this spot for sure. Take a trip outside the hotel to the surrounding spots for a better meal.",

    "text": "We didn't get into Vegas until midnight and while that didn't worry me too much so far as finding places to eat, when we arrived to the Hard Rock hotel and Casino was told this was the only open place - I was slightly anxious. SILLY ME!  Must have been the nerves of the double drive time we had to get here because as soon as we slipped into our leather booth, we were comfy, and completely ready for Vegas!  My son was ready for a hearty meal and the spaghetti and meatball (mountainous!) delivered! He chowed down on the meatball and was getting full but slowly worked through the pasta as well. It was just as he hoped.   I ordered the buffalo chicken wrap and the chicken strips were so crunchy!  The sauce was just as I hoped and the fries crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside!    Bottom line whether looking for a meal with your family or late-night munchies after clubbing this is the comfort food you want, the flavors you'd expect kicked up a notch for Hard Rock standards!   We reviewed the hotel as well if you are considering staying. For more ideas of what to do in Vegas with families, check out my blog.  #makesmewander",

    "text": "Do you know what's so great about Mr. Lucky's? They serve Breakfast and All Day meals 24/7. Their menu is simple, convenient, and their most requested items are framed with a triple border. There are indications if the item contains nuts and if it's vegetarian. Also if you like pancakes and waffles, you do have that option to order Gluten-Free. Now if you have a Backstage Pass Rewards Club, you earn points and pay a dollar less for the entree with exclusion of Breakfast Additions and Beverages.  I figured it would be best to order take-out and get the Blackened Alfredo Chicken ($13.99). It's Penne Pasta mix with tiny asparagus tips, diced tomatoes, sauteed in roasted garlic oil and creamy parmesan sauce, then topped with a generous chunk of blackened tender chicken breast and parsley. The meal comes with two pieces of Crispy Garlic Toast. The Blackened Alfredo Chicken taste really good and I think it's just enough to share with another person. They do give a good amount of food for take-out and it is well worth the price.   My only concern is the Garlic Toast, it taste kind of salty. Rather than Tomato juice ($4.99) I probably should've ordered Grapefruit juice to balance the saltiness. Nonetheless, I feel content with my meal. Considering they have Gluten-Free options, I'm eager to try their pancakes and waffles on my next visit.",

We were disappointed that they no longer do this. It was one of the only affordable meals in Vegas when you're looking to eat on a budget. We looked at their menu and passed on dining there because even burgers started at $15. We know this is typical for Vegas, but disappointing if you're expecting the $7.77 special. If you like diner food and want to eat at any time, I'd check it out. Just wanted others to know the special is no more :(",

    "text": "We stayed at the Hard Rock during our recent Vegas trip and stopped here for brunch one afternoon.  We got seated immediately as it wasn't busy and the place is large with ample room. I ordered a \"build your own\" omelet with cheddar jack cheese, green onion, mushrooms, bell peppers and bacon for $16.99, which came with a side of wheat toast and potatoes. Note that you can add as many ingredients from the list as you want for that price. The omelet was pretty standard, good but nothing special about it. The potatoes were good as well, slightly overcooked which made them crispy. They provided a few slices of toast which I thought was pretty generous. I ended up feeling a bit bloated for the remainder of the day due to the food being on the heavier side.  Other items ordered by others in our party included the sweet cream pancakes (a stack of 4!) and shrimp cocktail. The pancakes were good and definitely shareable! The shrimp cocktail was pretty standard as well.  Overall good diner-quality food with large portions, good for a predictable meal. They have options for all times of the day (which allowed some of us to get breakfast items while others got appetizers) and it's really convenient that they're open 24/7. Service was decent as well.",

    "text": "So let me get this out up front before I dive into the review.. Gamblers special $7.77 has been on my mind for awhile now and while I have visited Vegas for the past few years I never got to try it so we ventured out to give it a shot and review it but a surprise was at hand. Upon arriving it turns out it's now $9.99 plus you need to buy a drink.. Boooo I mean come I know Vegas is on the rise in prices vs the old days but $7.77 uniqueness factor is what set it apart. Anyway the steak was very chewy and fatty, string beans were basically over cooked, shrimp were the best part but at $7.77 I might not have barked so much but for $10 it's not worth it nor worth a return visit when we got some other places in town slinging there own specials that don't require a players card to sneak your way into the deal or buy a drink with it on top. Hard Rock don't mess with success. Service on the other hand was good and I like Hard Rock as a casino but I'll do my steak special somewhere else where cheaper quality food matches the cheaper price or higher quality vs the higher price.There is a dividing point and there on the other end of the wrong way street move it back down to $7.77 simple as that.",

I thought that the biscuits and gravy were good - not great, however certainly made fresh.   My mom ate all of her muffin and most of her fruit - blueberries.  No complaints.  If I had any concerns, it's that the charges for the coffee and the OJ seemed a bit exorbitant for the time and the location.  The coffee was almost as much as the biscuits and gravy!  However the service was prompt and courteous and we didn't have to wait for anything - the food was ready almost as soon as we ordered it.   Overall, I'd come back again for breakfast if I were staying at the Hard Rock again.",

    "text": "I found out about the old secret menu at Mr. Lucky's 24-7.  Thanks, YELPERS!  When I can, I try to eat Paleo-type meals, meat and veggies!  And on our family trip to celebrate my parent's 50th Wedding Anniversary, we tried to balance our budget between the pricey meals and the cheap ones to get more bang for our buck.  This is just a little diner with lots of other options, but depending on your budget or how you spend the rest of your money on your visit, it can be a great saver!  There is something called the Mr. Lucky's Special for $7.77 -  it's not on their menu.  So, we trekked there and I asked for it.  (You have to ask for it and they ask you the secret question of how much it costs before they will get it for you).  It's a small New York strip steak with shrimp and a side of veggies. You also get a side salad. It's a decent meal for a cheap price.   For late night, they also have a Graveyard Special $6.99 - steak, eggs, hash browns and toast.   The cooks do a good job cooking a cheap piece of steak and the eggs come out the way you ask for them.   And in classic hard rock style, the people watching is fun.  :)",

Went to this restaurant when I arrived at the hotel..when I walked up the girl just looked at me didn't say anything just stared at me blankly..so I said hey how's it going, for 3 please - she seated us and still didn't say anything...   The guy who brought our drinks wasn't our waitress but he didn't bother to say anything either..  The waitress was at our table bare minimum & seemed like anytime we asked for something when she was actually paying attention - like a side of ranch or a refill we were bothering her and she quickly would bring it to the table and rush off, didn't ask if we needed anything else when we did!  The food was simple and good so I came in the next day to give it another chance, thought I would just do to-go since dinning in wasn't all that & I already knew what I wanted - went to the bar area to order, there was 3 waitress behind the bar and I sat for 15 minutes waiting for a waitress to even ask if I wanted something to drink - that didn't even happen & I was giving eye contact like hey! I'm obviously here for a reason... So when one of them finally spoke to me all she said was I'll be right with you and went to assist the table behind me!   So I was over it by that point and didn't feel like giving them another chance anymore. So I went next door to culinary drop out to hope for a better experience and just get something to eat! - awesome food & awesome service!!!! (5 stars for them)   I obviously didn't have a very memorable experience here so I don't have any names of these less than mediocre people but you're better off at any of the other restaurants in this hotel!! just fyi",

I was really excited to split it with someone as this baby will put you back roughly $25.  Overall it was pretty good.  The pancakes didn't have many bananas cooked in so I began to loose steam with the bland flavor.  I was impressed at how perfectly the bacon was cooked to my liking, not too soft and not too crispy!  The pancakes don't come with a lot of glaze as it's just put on the top cake, so if given the option I would try and get an extra side of that.  Our server was very friendly, but didn't always come to the table and had to be flagged down.   This is understandable considering it was brunch time on Sunday and they were almost 100% capacity.  Not sure if I would come back, but if I did I would speak up about extra bananas and more glaze!",

No better deal than this, I mean c'mon guys.....$7.77 for a decent slab a meat n skewered shrimp, mashed spuds and a salad (good green mix) but go for the Caesar salad, tasty greens they are....  Just get in, order, eat n shut up, don't ruin the special with \"service\" or \"ambiance\" or \"tablecloths\", this is a 24/7 grubb joint.  So I finished off a night of Craps here after hitting the hard eight twice, one with $100 on it, you Crappers know the odds....yeahhhhhhh boyyyyy! Did I say you Crappers?  til next time, Steak ya later.....",

We only drink water and our total usually always just comes out to $16. Next time you're here... Ask for the Gamblers special and its off the menu! :)",

Biggest complaint: $7.77 Surf and Turf no longer comes with a salad. You can add a salad for $3.99 if you would like. I chose not to out of my own stupid little protest. I really loved that little salad with Bleu Cheese Dressing. Even with adding a salad it is still less expensive than many other items. I hope management will reconsider and bring the salad back.",

We had heard about their 777 special (Steak and Shrimp for $7.77) so we decided to come back for lunch after a UNLV graduation.  The waitress was terrible.  I wish I could remember her name so I could warn other potential patrons.  She took our order, checked on us once and then never returned until we asked the hostess for our waitress.  We were parched the entire meal.  A few of the other entrees we ordered were, an open faced turkey sandwich (good), cheese pizza (gross, no flavor), breakfast plate (my daughter go sick afterwards), and the 777 special was ok.  I don't think I'll ever return.",

    "text": "Prime Rib Lovers Take Heed!!! The main reason my friends and family go to vegas is to enjoy their excellent prime rib, buffet or not.  HRH's Mr. Lucky's was recommended (with a picture to go with it) by a friend, so off we went (4 hour drive). My friend's experience was a 4 star rating; unfortunately, he failed to mention that if you happen to crave another serving, you will get about less than a 1/4 inch slice with more fat than meat.  In addition, by the time they delivered the second serving, you may as well go for a walk and a cigarette. (I actually got tired of twiddling my thumbs and looking around at the dark decor). The delay on a third serving as i have tried was even WORST. The server (servers, since at least 2 other servers came to our table) seem to be concerned, but it won't make a difference for the lost appetite.  Note: this occurred at 4pm on a Tuesday, with servers running around like chickens wit their heads cut off, not sure who they were serving when the place had only about 4 other customers. I would never go back, unless Robert Irvine of Restaurant Impossible shows them what good customer service is all about.  If you really want good tender Prime Rib, go to Terrible's Hotel Casino! Their prime rib is about 1 inch thick, tender meat less fat.  You wont need to ask for a 2nd serving, the huge plate is full of prime rib you may even have to ask for a box. Plus, you get a mug of free beer to boot!!",

They serve traditional American cuisine from breakfasts to burgers around the clock, so after you spend a wild night around town, you can relax with some good ol' American comfort food. For a tourist, the prices and sales tax can hit your wallet. This place has an open-format that looks onto the casino floor, so this place isn't the place if you're looking for a quiet place to recover after a long night. One of the best kept secrets is that if you are attending a concert by the nearby Joint music venue, you can get your receipt validated that gives you front of the line access for the often disorganized lines leading into The Joint.",

What you get is really a good deal for the money......a decent sirloin steak, three grilled shrimp, garlic mashed potatoes, and a salad.  Just right for lunch.  My only complaint was the $3.00 glass of iced tea, which I thought was exorbitant and boosted the tab up there, making it not quite as good a deal after all.  As a side note, the Hard Rock Casino was virtually deserted at lunch time in the middle of the week when I was there.",

Plus super slow service.  2) Late night- Mr. Lucky's redeemed itself with the Midnight - 8am steak and eggs special. When stumbling in from the strip at 4:30am nothing says cure my hangover like over-easy eggs, hash browns, steak and toast for an awesome price. I woke up the next day feeling fantastic... whether it was the steak and eggs or not i'll never no. But it sure hit the spot!   Bonus points! When our group of 9 did stumble in at 4:30am at the end of our meal our waitress offered to split our checks up for us.   However, for a real culinary experience seek elsewhere, but for kids on a college budget I can't complain too much.",

He looked like some Filipino dude who was just hella slackin'. We got seated right away and our waiter took like 15 minutes to come by and ask us if we wanted anything to drink. He talks so low and the music at the restaurant is soooo loud so it's was pretty hard to communicate with him. We got the lucky 777 amazing. It took forever for our waiter to get back so we could order desert which was the amazing apple pie. My fiance had to raise his hand and yell excuse me, when he was passing by to get his attention after how many times we tried calling him. Took him forever to give us our desert. He never refilled our drinks, or take the plates that we just finished, not even ask how we doing, like ewww this guy was just trying to give me a shitty night. The first two times I went here it was soo busy but service was still great and consistent. This guy made me rate this place 4 stars instead of 5. Told the manager that he needs like a cigarette or 5hour energy coz he was just a slob probably pissing off other parties. The manager was just like \"sorry about that, ummm you guys have a great night.\"",

One of the biggest problems now is the servers are not well trained and many apparently cannot think for themselves.  We'd had steak & shrimp the night before so we skipped the special this time: big mistake.  While the Chinese chicken salad (ripped off from Wolfgang Puck) was OK (but a little bland and over-dressed,) the turkey Reuben was awful and what was advertised on the menu as fresh rotisserie turkey didn't appear to be anything close to that.  The best thing was the White Russian spiked milk shake.  Meanwhile, while our waiter kept coming over and asking us if we needed anything, when we said we did he never did anything about it.  For instance, when I ordered the milk shake, my brother asked for an extra glass so he could taste it...it never came.  Even though we made it clear we were sharing the sandwich and salad, no one bothered to bring side plates, (which should've been obvious,) and even after we asked and they said they would, no one ever did.  (It was not crowded!)  We only got mustard because one of the bus staff was more on the ball than the waiters and saw that we needed it.  Also, this is just me, but any 24/7 casino joint ought to have a shrimp cocktail on the menu.  They don't.",

The food was pretty good but nothing spectacular and the service was great (though a tad bit slow, given how the place wasn't very busy).  So given the fact that Mr. Lucky's sounds pretty average, you may be asking yourself the following question: what gives it the extra half star? The answer is their 6 shots for $10 deal.  I mean, what better way to start off your Vegas vacation than with a trio of Three Wise Men shots, right?  Right.",

    "text": "I detest the HRH and its patrons, but this restaurant is bad-ASS!  It's just a 24-hour coffee shop, but it has pretty good food for decent prices, and excellent people watching.  The $7.77 steak special is legendary, and rightly so -- a good-sized, decent quality steak, salad, potato and three skewered grilled jumbo shrimp, for a great price (it's not on the menu, but they serve hundreds a day so they will DEFINITELY know what you're talking about).    Basically, if you want a good cheap-ass steak special in Vegas, it's either this or Ellis Island. Ellis includes a beer instead of the shrimp skewer -- so take your pick. Personally, I prefer the down-n-out clientele of Ellis Island to the poseurs of the Hard Rock...but there is also something to be said for watching heavily Botoxed ex-groupies stumble around drunkenly with their wannabe rockstar abusive thug husbands. Dinner and a show -- it's the great Vegas tradition!",

    "text": "This Cafe/Restaurant was beyond awesome!!!  They had New York Steak+Eggs Graveyard Specials from Midnight to 6am in the morning when I visited Vegas this past March's last weekend between March/25-March/27.  Eating here helped me save sooooooo much $$$$ from the start n' gave me great feelings about playing the slots in the hotel my friends n' I stayed at which was Harrahs on the strip.  You'll be a winner eating here during a time like this because this dish I ordered WAS beyond fabulous.    The New York steak was cooked very tender and enjoyed the hashed browns and the wheat toasts that came with it.  I'm suggesting future customers to plan going to Vegas in an economic way by trying out this Cafe inside Hard Rock Hotel and Cafe.  Two of my other friends who went with me ended up ordering the same exact dish I suggested.  Everybody left the Cafe extremely satisfied.  The dish was only $7 before tax and tips.....can't beat that for the size of the New York steak they provided!!!!  ~Hope this review helps those who are planning a future Vegas trip~",

    "text": "This was my first visit to Mr. Lucky's since its minor renovation last June. They didn't change much, except they blew out a wall, opening it up on one side to the casino.   After a long morning of walking the Strip I was excited to treat myself and my freeloading brother to the 7-7-7 Special. We took up residence at the bar and was promptly treated by our server Zach. Service was very good as he delivered our drinks and prepared our fresh salads right away. Anticipation built as we watched several dishes leave the pass line, Mini corn dogs, pancake wrapped sausage, pastrami sandwich.... All looked awesome. Then we noticed our steaks. Zach promptly snatched them and presented us our lunch.   Food review: Salad = Simple, fresh and delicious.                       Shrimp = Seasoned nicely with a peppercorn spice, grilled well.                       Potato = Didn't disappoint.                       Steak = Smaller cut than on previous visits, a little over cooked for           medium, but still a solid choice for the price.",

Late evening both times, the service was really slow in a nearly empty restaurant, and the BLT in particular [with avocado added] was dry, boring, and not worth the money. I regretted ordering it.  Early morning, in a nearly full restaurant, and the service was smiling and faster than I'd imagined it would be. They kept checking back, and the California omelet [three eggs, avocado, tomatoes, artichokes, onion sprouts, goat cheese, minus the quinoa] was amazing.   Late morning the next day, there was the same full restaurant, same great service, and the Bacon Blue burger [melted blue cheese, applewood bacon, caramelized onions, avocado] was the best I've ever had. I was in heaven, and almost considered staying longer just so I could have it one more time.  I could be wrong, but I got the sense they put their better servers and cooks on during the morning rush. Not sure I'd bother with Mr Lucky's again before 3 am or after 11 am. But in between those times? I'm all there.",

I even called back again to hopefully get a different person to answer the phone and confirm this information. No dice... Same woman answered and confirmed. So I decided to drive down there from Summerlin. When I arrived the same woman said that this special was only on Saturday and Sunday. She claimed that she there was a steak and shrimp special everyday from 2-8. It's quite amusing/unbelievable to confuse ayce prime rib with steak an shrimp. SAD!!! I think that person's only job was to greet,seat, and answer the phone. Decided to not donate my money to this fraudulent establishment. seems that I'm not the only one that feels this way since the hotel is a ghost town.",

The relaxed space comes complete with a long counter, loud open kitchen, and trashy waitresses...ours even wore a necklace that said \"Cougar\" in large script writing.    Hard Rock Hotel guests make the most of the space for their hangover breakfast woes, late night munchies, and room service deliveries.  However, the food is good enough to warrant the trip from outsiders.  Of course my friend and I fell into the category of those seeking mid-afternoon hangover relief, so we joined the line waiting for a table at the casual American staple.  We were starving, so when the host asked us if we would be willing to take the two remaining seats at the counter, we jumped at the chance.  However, when we walked through the diner, we noticed several available tables.  We had been duped into the counter seats, but we wound up enjoying the kitchen view so it all worked out in the end.  I appropriately ordered the \"Rehab\" Breakfast, which included  scrambled egg whites with mushrooms, sauteed spinach, sliced vine-ripened tomatoes, and my choice of toast or English muffin.  My eggs were well-seasoned, and the balanced plate satisfied every inch of my weary palate.  A delicious glass of freshly-squeezed orange juice was also included, which provided the necessary dose of sugar to energize for an afternoon at the pool.  My friend's Smoked Atlantic Salmon plate included a crisply toasted bagel, red onions, capers, sliced tomatoes, and cream cheese.  The salmon slices were perfectly smoked and salted.    Mr. Lucky's was a great option for affordable Vegas dining around the clock.  The atmosphere was purely diner-centric, but the food surpassed expectations.",

It comes with a salad, a steak, 3 grilled shrimp, and the most fabulous mashed potatoes ever.  Our waitress was awesome and totally unobtrusive since she could see we were chatting.  The salad was really good and the croutons on it were delicious.  I'm not a big crouton fan (I usually pick them off) but I ate every single one of these.  The steak was cooked as specified and tasty and juicy.  The shrimp were a little overcooked but still yummy.  The mashed potatoes were soooo good, seriously I'm pretty sure I licked them off the plate!  I wasn't expecting the food to be as good as it was so this is a great deal for $7.77 and one of the better meals we had while in Vegas.  I'd definitely go back!",

We had some unpleasant conversations with so many different restaurant and hotel management that we almost didn't even try on this last trip to Vegas, but we tempted fate and went to Mr. Lucky's...and surprise of surprises they had prime rib.  My partner in crime and I each had 3 large slabs of prime rib. It is not the best prime rib, but it is certainly acceptable for the price. The dinner also comes with mashed potatoes and veggies.

Rather than having to go down to the business center and pay to go online and pay again to print out a coupon we had for lunch she allowed me to email it to her and she printed it out herself. I only had the certificate number on my iphone but she was so cool about it.   This is the kind of customer service that I'm talking about that makes a establishment great.

Crunchy on the outside and juicy and soft on the inside with gravy that is flavorful without being heavy at all.   It's open 24/7 which is awesome and they serve breakfast ALL day so who cares what time you wake up in Vegas.  I only had to wait once on my visit there but who doesn't have the drunk munchies at 4am, right? Service is quick and too the point, on each visit water was brought out automatically which I appreciate.  The waiters could be more tactful but for the most part they are friendly and they get what you need.",

The food was good, the service though...sheesh! It was just straight up awful. Our server was nice enough but he had way too many tables to give good service to anyone.   Example 1: We got our salads AFTER our meal arrives. Being a former waitress, that has to be the biggest restaurant faux pas that could ever happen. We actually had to tell the person that brought our food (not the server) that we hadn't received our salads yet.   Example 2: We had to flag several other servers down for drink refills. If you have ever been to Mr. Lucky's and ordered their coffee, you'll know that it comes in these mammoth sized mugs so it takes the average person a REALLY long time to finish a cup. He never came by once to offer refills.   Example 3: We had to ask another server for our check. We just wanted to get the hell out of there.   If you've got a whole lotta time and want something cheap and pretty tasty, Mr. Lucky's may just be for you!",

Ordered a burger for myself & my gf had the french toast plate & don't forget the Mimosa's!! Those were just as good as the food. Hit up this place several times while staying at HR & each time the food was just as good as the last   The menu is a little pricey but what isn't in Vegas  I did not know they had a secret menu until I read the other reviews on yelp :(   I will be sure to hit up Mr Lucky's the next time I'm in Vegas, the staff was cool & prompt considering it was always crowded I don't know if it was due to Tgiving weekend or people just love this place but I know I loved everything about it",

We were simply going to the Hard Rock to pick up some Vegas memorabilia (but they were closed) and the 6.99 NY Steak special caught my husbands eye. We ordered and our food was served quick and efficiently. Our server was a nice guy named Joshua. Now, I must say that for 6.99 I was not expecting alot, but what I got was so much more. The steak was cooked perfectly and was a very good size. The eggs and potatoes that it came with were awesome and I was pleasantly surprised at how good the meal was. We did order a couple of drinks, which far exceeded what we spent on the actual meal.   So in a nutshell, the food is great, but the drinks are overpriced.",

What makes Mr Lucky's special though is what's not on the menu. Namely the $7.77 steak & shrimp and the $9.99 All-You-Can-Eat prime rib. Are they amazing? Not at all. But after a day of Vegas drinking they definitely satisfy.  I recommend subbing fries for the mashed potatoes though, those things look...just... take my word for it - fries. At $9.99 the AYCE prime rib doesn't put too much pressure on, because it turns out all the prime rib I can eat is about 3/4 of one. I've failed gluttons all over the world.",

We were 4 ladies celebrating a Bachelorette Party coming in at 11am for Breakfast. We sat in the back corner booth. The server guy with \"The Hair\" came and took our order. Our coffee and waters were brought but then nothing for 45 MINUTES!! Seriously? Where's the food?Where's our server? Can we get more coffee? What about more water? BUT THAT'S NOT ALL. After not making eye contact with any of us waving or obviously checking our watches, he comes over, he apologizes that the kitchen is working on our order, the manager will bring it  right out, it's on them and here's some donut holes to hold us over. Okaayy, except 15 MORE MINUTES GO BY, the tables around us, that were seated AFTER US have eaten, paid and left and new customers are being seated AND served food BEFORE US! Outraged that we still have not gotten our food or refills on water/coffee we flag down another server to get the manager for us. The \"Manager\" arrives and assures us that our plates are coming right now. When he returns he has food! However, after setting down a couple plates and calling out the different orders, NONE of these are what we ordered. :( WTF. Confused, the manager took the plates back and again, we were waiting for food.  Finally at 12:15pm, our plates came. The classic rock with eggs and bacon was delish. My friend got the french toast crusted with corn flakes and vanilla butter, YUM- I recommend this. I also recommend not sitting in the back corner booth, you'll get ignored and horrible service.",

We weren't really planning on using it, but on the last day, we decided to check out their breakfast menu since it seemed like the most convenient option at the time - we had very little time left before we needed to leave for SoCal.   Since I was attempting to cut my calories and focus on consuming more protein-heavy meals, I ordered the  \"Gambler's Special,\" which included a bowl of salad, an 8oz sirloin steak, three jumbo shrimp, and garlic mashed potatoes for $7.77. For the size of the steak I got and the jumbo shrimp, $7.77 is definitely a steal.  Did it taste good? Was it quality food? I don't know. It was definitely a little on the oily side, but I did appreciate that the shrimp was not overcooked. As far as the steak is concerned, It seemed like your regular USDA Select cut of meat, and was a little on the tough side.  Overall.. my expectations were very low, and appropriately so.",

The seasoning on the breading was weak.  The hashbrowns were tasteless.  Everything was also fairly overpriced for the lack of flavor impact.

I had ordered a drink for a friend that was visiting at another table that the waitress forgot. This late friend ordered her food 15 minutes after us yet got her food 10 minutes before anybody else did. Bizarre. Overall, we  had waited about 45 minutes for our food.   When this fact was pointed out, she brought her manager out instead of just telling us what was up. All he could do was assure us the food was coming out. When it did, my dish was cold and seemed like it had been standing under the heat lamp for a while.  The other visits were not remarkable but neither was the food.",

That is if you get anything off of the specials menu otherwise the food is somewhat pricey for the food where you can go anywhere else on the strip for a better deal.  Always check out the specials that they have to offer when I was in Las Vegas we stayed at the hard rock and I ordered the famous triple 7 special which comes with a steak, potatoes, shrimp for $7.77 and the steak and eggs for $4.99 remember to show your rockstar club membership to get the discounts and to double check your receipts just to sure they get it correct.  Overall next time I'm at the Hard Rock and its 4am going to stop back in for my fix.",

    "text": "My 3 friends and I ate at Mr. Lucky's for breakfast twice. The first time it was take out; I picked up all the food and brought it back to the room for everyone to enjoy. We were delighted with our delicious breakfast! We raved about it so much that we decided to sit down in the restaurant the next morning, to each order a different plate than the morning before. The next morning, we found the place packed to the brim. We were waited on by a very courteous and friendly server but it took forever for our food to arrive. When it finally came, everything looked just as amazing as the morning before; pancakes were fluffy, omelettes loaded and cheesy, and fruit ripened and scrumptious. We were about 5 minutes in to a conversationless calorie fest when suddenly, a small creepy crawly creature decided to join in on our meal. He boldly scampered his way to the right side of my plate, stopped, moved his little antennae, catching my eye. Now I have to admit that I have seen roaches before, and I'm not saying this was a roach. But damn it, this had to have been a distant cousin, because familiarity seeped in, and I jumped up and screamed! I caught the next woman with a badge on her shirt, and unsteadily exclaimed, \"there's a bug!!\" She swiftly grabbed a napkin (I'm sure she didn't want to alarm the already-curious neighboring guests), captured the bug, and then surprisingly calmly proceeded to ask us \"do you still want to eat here?\" To which I replied, \"hell no!\" She then said, \"I understand. I will take care of it.\"  Her quick reaction, as I discussed later with my friends, told a story of the past; this has happened there before. They have seen these bugs there before. This may not have been the first time. My advice, if you decide to eat here: Granted, none of us fell ill. Just know that if you dare, you may have to share your food with some 6-8 legged critters that are braver and hungrier than you.",

I picked up one end and it picked up a large ball of salad like a fist sized disco ball.  The waiter came back and took a glance at my head like I was trying to get a discount. Thank goodness I had my hair pulled back into a slick bun that night. When the manager walked into the kitchen, I saw a man with long, dark, curly hair standing behind the door.... We all know who the culprit was!! A paper hat isn't enough. Pull that mess back into a ponytail at least!  Everyone else that came that night had the AYCE prime rib. They said it was decent but the prime rib was cut so thin, you could practically roll it up like cold cut hors d'ouevres on a platter. It appears from others' pictures that this is not always the case with the thickness of the meat...  Go to Jerry's Nugget for a good prime rib...  BTW the replacement salad may have tasted fine. I was just trying to choke it down without grossing out the rest of diners at my table...",

We were immediately seated before waiting a good 15 minutes to be acknowledged by a less than excited and far from enthusiastic member of the wait staff.    We asked our waitress about the 7.77 special, and she claimed to know nothing about it.  It's clearly plastered all over the interwebs that you can get some food for $7.77 and we all know that the everything you read is always True.  Anyhow, we were hungry and ordered breakfast.  It was slow to arrive, tasted like average diner food and cost more than it was worth.    To top it off, we were able to enjoy the accompanying cigarette smoke from the nearby slot machines - perhaps that made the wait for service and food to be even longer.    Not planning a return trip to Mr. Luckys...or the Hard Rock.",

His name is ABE!! That's it! lol he was perfect! After we got everything we needed and half way thru the meal this random lady walked up and asked if we needed anything else.. so confused I said no. Well needless to say we left the tip to Abe instead of Ashley! They should make him a server!! Thanks so much Abe",

Apparently you have to have a player's club card, but maybe they don't ask me for one because I've frequented the establishment so much. The steak has always been cooked to my liking, mashed potatoes have varied between buttery, creamy goodness, or delicious chunky bites, and the salad is a nice complement even though I don't even like salad!  To me, this is a 5 star meal for the quality and price. There are 2 stars missing from my rating because every. single. time. I have visited this diner, the service is wack-tastic. Especially the last 2 times when I had the same lifeless, blunt, unpleasant and slow server. Short for no reason (in manner, not height) and just someone I would not want to interact with. I'm pretty sure my demeanor is friendly and respectful at the least so there is no reason to come at me with that rude ish. And WHY does it take 15 minutes to get a check when my food is obviously gone? I hate looking around like I lost my mom at the grocery store (we are actually both short in height so that has happened quite a bit).  It won't hurt to come here for the special, but make sure you are in the mood to not let anyone ruin your experience.",

I hadn't eat in a few days cause of srhfest so i was hungry and ordered the pancakes. When i got them they were barely warm,not surprised it was so cold. After eating them i was even more disappointing because they weren't that great for $13 pancakes. I mean really how you screw up pancakes WITH bacon,its bacon that alone should make it taste great but it didn't. I was disappointed by the HR as whole customer service is terrible and ramp id threw out the hotel. They've really let the HR name go down hill.

Ask for the $7.77 special- a smallish size steak topped with a skewer of 3 shrimp, mashed potatoes and a salad for less than $8 and available 24 hours a day or night!  Good, solid food to quench your 3am hunger. I had a huge seared tuna steak salad. It's sometimes hard to get your vegetables in when you are in the middle of a  fried food, cinnabon coated desert land.",

I normally won't eat Eggs Benedict because most people can't make Hollandaise, but it was awesome here. Oh, and the Huevos Rancheros...",

I would understand if it was really busy, but there were maybe 7 people eating at the place and 6 workers standing around doing nothing. It took our waiter 15 minutes to come over and take our order.  We (5 of us) all ordered the 777 special and he asked how we would like our steaks cooked.  We all said medium to make things easier.  Once we all received our steaks, they were all burned on the outside and the inside was either very rare or well done.  We would have complained if we could have found our waiter, but he was no where to be found.  The mashed potatoes were very bland as well.  Overall, the meal and service was horrible and we will never go back here.  If everything was this bad when they were empty, I would hate to see how things are when they are busy.",

Great deal in Vegas.  ...and apparently, there's a $9.99 All-You-Can-Eat Prime Rib special? WHAT?! WHY WAS I NOT INFORMED. That's a great deal anywhere, much less Vegas. Has to be the best deal in the city.   I'm mad at my inside sources. I was not informed of this prime rib deal. I feel cheated. But then I kind of cheated everyone else who paid $12 for a sandwich.

But now it is just your steak, 3 shrimp, mashed potatoes, and now instead of a salad it's green beans, which are delicious. However in order for you to get the deal at $7.77 you have to have a players club card with them, which in case you don't have one yet they'll just sign you up right there, super easy. But if u refuse to sign up for it, then the meal is $9.99.   This deal is not on the menu, so u do have to ask for it yourself, but it is available everyday and 24hrs a day.",

We had to order a drink to accompany this steak special and it could be either alcoholic/non-alcoholic. The reason why I gave this place a 3 star is because there were certain things on their menu that was way overpriced. The menu didn't mention any additional costs. We ended up ordering a loaded baked potato that came out to be $7- almost as much as the steak special. If you're watching your wallet than be careful what you order, otherwise it might end up being very costly.",

I was hoping it would remind me of the best (and only other) pie shake I had in SF from Chile Pies & Ice Cream (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/chile-pies-and-ice-cream-san-francisco\">yelp.com/biz/chile-pies-...</a>), but it unfortunately didn't come close. This place isn't my cup of tea, but it does some like a reliable and inexpensive hangover helper for those in need.

    "text": "Serving guests at the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino for two decades it can safely be stated that Mr. Lucky's is a Las Vegas icon, and although plans for the space have not yet been announced as Virgin looks to renovate in 2019 the new menu from Chef Chad Castanino offers a level of diversity and craftsmanship that many may not expect from a 24/7 spot just off the gaming floor.   Visited twice prior for Breakfast and Dinner, the new collection of plates doing away with arbitrary definitions and truly all-day, it was with greetings from a young woman at the hostess stand that five guests were led to a long table overlooking the open kitchen, the week preceding Thanksgiving predictably quiet with only two other parties occupying the vast space decorated by Rock paraphernalia.  Treated to tunes by Queen, The Rolling Stones and Aerosmith while dining, an order focused on variety seemingly the best approach, it was with one Tequila-based Bloody and a seven-Spirit mix called \"I Wanna be Sedated\" that dinner got underway, a first round of $6 Parker Rolls in Cast Iron just a glimpse of what Hard Rock's bakeshop is capable of while Nuggets of Pork Shank slipped off the Bone with complex flavors prior to digging into an Antipasto Salad highlighted by Artichoke Hearts, Provolone and chopped Charcuterie.  Leaving behind some items such as Country Fried Steak bites for another time and progressing to Sandwiches, the two-handers first presented whole then cut into fifths by Chef Castanino, it was expected that Horseradish Mayo on the Beef & Cheddar would be polarizing though in the context of everything else it was quite mild while \"Nashville Style Hot Chicken\" won't challenge the likes of Howlin' Rays in LA for Heat, but still presents a multi-layered spice profile comparable to the Medium at Cosmo's new Hattie B's.    Not seeing any Fries go to waste, the crispy Potatoes definitely a cut above those at PT's Tavern or other 24-hour joints, it was with two Pastas that savory plates came to a conclusion, the al dente Bucatini standing up to slowly cooked Pork, Beef and Veal plus Parmesan to thicken the Sauce while Wheat-Free Vegan Gnocchi is plenty garlicky but also light and tender amidst juicy Tomatoes and Sage Leaves.  Turning the program over to Pastry Chef Mickey Harden from here, the man responsible for almost everything sweet in the whole Resort making a rare appearance outside the kitchen, it was beginning with Cookies & Cream Cakes that guests quickly realized they'd ordered more than anticipated, each of three moist Chocolate rounds nearly the size a dinner plate and liberally topped with crumbled Oreos plus Cocoa-infused Mascarpone.   Ordering Coffee for the rest, just good Beans and Water though some of the new Java-based Cocktails sound great, Mr. Lucky's actual Dessert menu next followed in three rounds - the first featuring soft Cheesecake and cubes of Pound Cake with Berries plus a blend of Bananas and Nutella atop a robust Crust that is most certainly decadent but eats lighter than it sounds.  Moving next to items with Ice Cream, the \"Parfait\" a pretty standard Sundae topped off with one of Chef Harden's Fudge Brownies, those looking for something a bit more fancy will want to check out sliced Bread Pudding ready to be topped in warm Toffee Sauce or conjoined Profiteroles shellacked in Raspberry Sugar and filled with Peanut Butter Ice Cream...though that certainly should not preclude ordering what might just be Sin City's best Cinnamon Roll, currently Pumpkin spiced and topped with boozy Cinnamon Frosting.  ****1/2:  Having said before that all Restaurants can be compared on the basis of intent and execution Chefs Castanino, Harden and Manchester have taken what was already one of Las Vegas' best 24/7 Eateries and raised the bar even further, a truly \"all day\" menu that outperforms expectations from Pancakes to Pasta not exactly unheard of in Sin City but when paired with legit Hot Chicken and some of the city's best Desserts at a great price definitely something special.",

Ok, now let's talk about the reason we chose this  place. Three beautiful words: Breakfast Bloody Mary.  It is worth every dollar ($22). It's a meal and a cocktail all in one. A full stalk of fresh celery, a pick with an Olive and lime wedge, and a pickle spear, a large fresh shrimp, a beef jerky stick, and a slider that consists of two mini waffles, bacon strips, sausage patty, and cheddar cheese, all topped off with a deviled egg. The food is delicious and it was so filling, it was difficult to finish! And the cocktail was perfectly seasoned and not light on the liquor, surprisingly. And, some of the ice cubes are made with the mix so it doesn't water down. Genius! I would eat this for breakfast every day, if I could. Ok, maybe every Sunday. Parking is FREE and it's off strip, so easy a access for us locals.  I do wish management would allow us to purchase this without the HRH souvenir glass, as I don't collect that stuff. I also wish managing would bring back the secret menu! Don't punish us regulars!",

We have gotten room service from this menu as well. Never have I ever had any unit tasty or even mediocre from here. They seriously have good food and a variety to surely please anyone. The service is outstanding and I love that we see the same faces working each visit. This visit I had pancakes with bananas and chocolate chips! I also had a few cocktails over our stay. Strawberry fields is my drink of choice for day or night. So delicious! Use your backstage pass to get food discounts!",

Super happy that I was able to grab a booth considering I was dining alone on a Saturday night! More fun for me!  This time I ordered a simple sexy Bloody Mary and the fish/chips. First of all the Bloody Mary was tasty than came the perfect order of fish and chips! The texture of the battered fish is excellent. The fries are the bomb! I like big long tasty fries, lol  Service was 5 Star and the price was decent.   Thanks again!",

You either have to buy a $20 pot of coffee to be delivered to your room, or you need to leave your room and go hunting for your morning coffee.  This place is open all the time, so decided to stop in and have a quick breakfast along with the largest coffee possible. The server, Paige, took very good care of me. All I really wanted was eggs and ham, and boy did she deliver.  This may be the biggest ham piece I've seen in my life. It was also served with a side of toast and fruit and the total bill came to $20. I only ate a fraction of this and brought the rest back to my room to have the remainder of the ham and fruit for lunch, so really this is to meals for me!",

    "text": "Another one of Vegas' worst kept secrets. This 24/7 coffee shop runs an off-menu special called \"The 777.\" That's a portion of flat-iron steak with some shrimp, potato and veggie, for $7.77.  I tried this out (again) a couple of months ago while out on-the-prowl with a wingman. What's new about this secret since my last visit here is that a beverage purchase (of some sort) is now required. After adding on my diet cola, tax and tip, this isn't exactly a special to shout-out to your BFFs.   And HRH's Backstage Pass Players Club is required. And they made me walk back to the parking garage to get it to show them. (I keep a slim pocket-card-case with just all my players cards in the car; too bad I forgot to bring it in when I actually needed it!)  The steak was just OK. A good cook can bring flat-iron up into a decent plate if he/she knows what he/she is doing. And since this \"secret\" deal has been available at Mr. Lucky's going back at least a decade, you can be sure even the steady-extra cooks have got the flat-iron system down cold.  The best attribute of this venue is, actually, its location. You can take a booth right up against, and fully open to, the casino floor, which (as most of you likely know) is circular (with its famous-and-infamous Center Bar at its core).  Pedestrians circling about the floor, heading this way and that, are passing right up against your booth yet you, being in the coffee shop, are entirely tuned out by them. So it's a comfortable spot to enjoy some tight-in people/drama scoping&eavesdropping  ... without actually having to be in-play.   I'll done the 777 several times over the years, and I'd say I've now seen it at its best. Next time I land here, I'll see what other quality coffee-shop grub can be found ... on the menu.",

It's not our usual spot for late-night eats, but since I've had good experiences (breakfast) here in the past, why not give them a try again?    Walking from the parking garage, we were amused passing by and witnessing some inebriated folk, dog-tired folk, and several trick-turning folk (freaks DO come out at night).  SInce it was 3 am, we didn't have to wait in any line upon arrival.  The turkey burger was decent-sized and was served with sprouts and avocado, however I had much better in the taste department.  The turkey lettuce wraps were my favorite....with noticeable lime, ginger, and garlic flavors.   Service was prompt  MOST of the time.  Prices were pretty average, for a popular casino diner.    Aside from people-watching, I wouldn't mind coming back to try out their Asian dishes and desserts.",

I send her away and go find the manager and advise I got there before 8 and because she took too long to get to me I apparently missed the special.  He said he would speak to the chef and see if it was still possible.   Without so much as a word, the same waitress comes by less than two min later and just drops the plate, saying nothing.

Once we ordered, the wait was long, but not unusual in a late-night casino joint. However, the problem came once we got our food, which was subpar in general, and mediocre at best. For instance, I got the Southern Burger, and the burger patty was barely visible between the Texas toast slices. A friend ordered the mac and cheese and prime rib. The only cheese flavor only came from the box of cheese nips crushed up on top, and what was supposed to be a medium-rare prime rib was only slightly cooked past blue-rare. One would assume a table full of drunk people would marvel at such a selection of food, but after hearing unanimous complaints against each dish, we concluded that yes, Mr. Lucky's sucks.",

Wife and I....... well mostly I, was starving after a night of a little drinking. We stayed at the HRH and I definitely needed some coffee ASAP. We arrive and are promptly seated. Its a decent sized dining room with a wide open floor plan. We are given our menu's, and my eyes are instantly fixated on the french toast sandwich. Im a sucker for french toast to begin with, but in a sandwich?! Bring it! Our waiter comes around to drop of our coffee, and take our orders. If you have been paying attention, what am I going to order???? Thats right, I ordered the french toast sandwich which is packed with eggs, a slice of ham, american cheese and bacon. It is served with hashbrowns on the side.  Let me just say that it was nothing short of amazing. Everything in the sandwich tasted great. The ham was juicy and tender, the bacon and eggs were cooked to perfection. Of course hashbrowns are always great no matter what. The wife ordered eggs, 2 pancakes and a bagel. Her pancakes unfortunately tasted like they had been re-heated.  Still good. Just did not have that moistyness you love in pancakes. Other than that it was all good.  The service from our waiter was awesome. He was always making sure our coffee did not need refilling, and always checking up on us. The service was spot on.  Overall I only gave it 3 stars due to the fact that this was our first time here,and would have to try out some other dishes before giving it anything else.  But so far it is off to a great start.",

First off, Vegas is my second home, and my boyfriend LOVES this place, so when we are at the Hard Rock, I indulge him a visit for his off the menu 777 special (which looks ok and he loves, but he will pretty much eat anything). We shared a Vietnamese shrimp roll appetizer on our first time here and I ordered a cheeseburger the 2nd time we ate here.  Shrimp rolls were DRY and tasteless, so you really start hoping that sauce they served with it is gonna work it's magic as a cover up, and then it doesn't! The sauce honestly tasted like a bad culinary version of children's cold medicine: sickeningly sweet, gooey, can't quite name that fake fruit kind of sauce with a rancid vinegar after taste. Didn't go well with the dried out shrimp roll, but then again what does?  The burger was ok, but it was just a burger. Plain patty on a generic roll. The fries they served with it were pretty funny: the potatoes they used for the fries obviously had a lot of black spots and holes in them, because each fry showed the spots. Limp and brown is not appetizing (***That's what she said! Hahaha***)  Waitstaff and hostess: hard to distinguish from ex-cons and North Vegas hookers, but that's just me.   Anyway, expected way more from this place, considering that they flaunt a new remodel and menu. Will try to direct my hot honey To eat a quick steak dinner elsewhere from now on.  :o)",

We ordered plenty of items from this place from the $7.77 meal which was awesome for the price! We also ordered the spicy nachos for an appetizer, was delicious. The nachos came with regular cheese as well as melted jalapeno cheese and sour cream. We were almost full after this!  We then ordered some flat bread pizzas - pepperoni and 4 cheese, which were also bomb!  We then came back a few hours later for deserts both alcoholic and non-alcoholic. We ordered several shots, the banana split, and the alcoholic banana chocolate milkshake (wow, awesome!).  The first time we went there, the waitress had an attitude and I was going to rate it a 4, but when we went back the service was 5 stars, which this place deserves!",

Me and by boyfriend were talking and waitress didnt bother to at least say, We will be with you in a momment, I went up to her and asked, So what do we just sit our selves or what?  She replies that a waiter will come to seat us, I said \"ok.\" Our server was friendly but our food wasent the best. I like to eat some chicken nachos with ranchero sauce and when I got it they gave more chips than anything, not enough chicken. They werent that warm either. If I could give this negative stars I would, Bottom line, It nothing special and is expensive for the type of food. Will never come again.",

You'd think for the price, the quality wouldn't be the greatest, but to my surprise, the steak was juicy, tender, and delicious. The shrimp were huge and full of flavor, and the mashed potatoes were very good! I recommend to anyone looking for a quality meal for a great price!

This was at 4am which is why i ordered just a soup, didn't need anything heavy before going to bed. The soup wasn't great, the salad on the other hand was HUGE and well worth it, especially for what you can find open at 4am in Vegas without a car. We decided to go to dinner there because the cab-fees were getting a little steep. I had seen this place on the Food Network on \"The Best ....\" Cheap Eats edition, and remembered it. I ordered the $7.77 deal, which isn't on the menu but they will honor it. I ordered my steak -medium (i usually order medium-well) but this time Medium was just fine since it is a diner. The meal came with mashed potatoes and a side salad. Worth my $7.77 and will be returning. Can't beat the price for a steak dinner!",

The second time I got Lucky's club and it was simply enormous ($12.99). To make a dent I had to deconstruct it. The turkey meat was real and not that processed stuff.

The signature burger was alright but not my favorite which is disappointing for the price ($17). Overall I enjoyed this restaurant but it is pretty pricey.",

The signature burger way over priced  $16 for late night or as a meal you better of go to the hamburger joint down the road or any coffee shop at $3.99 advertised on the billboards.

And I don't know why everyone keeps talking about a player's card, because I just asked the waiter for it and he didn't check or anything.)   Only 1 reason why you should be here, and it's for the Steak & Shrimp Special! Order comes with a small salad, steak, 3 pieces of shrimp, and bomb-diggity mashed potatoes. Like, seriously it's so creamy, buttery, smooth, with small chunks of potatoes mixed in that I want to ask if I can just get a whole tub of this to go. I'm sure they use Paula Deen's recipe, when she cuts off a small piece of butter, puts it to teh side, and adds the left over big end in.   Not the most amazing steak and shrimp, lets be honest. But for that price it's a steal! Especially considering how you can order this 24/7.   Mr. Lucky's was super packed when we came during the lunch hour, or maybe it was because it was just a busy weekend in Vegas. Service was a bit slow, but not because of the waiter or anything, it was just so packed busy with people. He was still really nice and attempted to meet our needs.",

Thank god for A LOT of A1 sauce...  The shrimp was good...  The service wasn't very good either.

So we walked up and the three girls at the hostess stand didn't acknowledge us. But all three looked at us. After a minute of them chattering we actually had to say hello. Then we were walked all over the place before we were finally seated. Really it could have been a straight line not zig zag through passing every table. The place was empty except 4 tables. Our server was not friendly. He came up asked what we wanted to drink, I said ice tea extra lemon, my friend got water. When he came back he asked if we were ready. At no time was he nice or polite.   We ordered he had the chicken parmesan and I had some bbq burger. The food was bland. The bbq burger had an onion ring, bacon, mac n cheese. The bbq sauce covered up any flavor in this this burger. There were gobs of the sauce and it tasted like a bottled sauce. I had bbq everywhere and had to actually flag our server down to get napkins and refills. the other table by us never got their food and walked out.   I am going to give them another shot on breakfast one day.",

They have $5 margarita's.  No, it isn't a steak you would get at a fine dining steak house (In Portland, Oregon where I live that'd be El Gaucho or the Ringside) but it was pretty darned good and they cooked mine \"well done\" just like I asked. That doesn't sound like a big deal, but it actually is, considering they usually end up somewhat bloody.  After spending $16 on drinks in the clubs, this was a breath of fresh air and a huge sigh of relief to my credit card.  The only downside is that it's a cab ride away and too far to walk.",

Generally I'm a bit of an oddball when it comes to Corned Beef Hash where I usually actually prefer the \"Canned\" (Libby's or Mary's Kitchen) hash, when it's cooked crisp and has those mini potato cubes.  I usually don't like fresh corned beef hash because usually it's just chopped up pastrami or corned beef slices shredded a bit.  Here, it's different, for the better, the corned beef is fresh in cubes, so it's deliciously  awesome.  The service is good, I went to the counter of the diner, and it was attentive.",

I had soup and a salad and my friend had a cold sandwich and chips. We waited 50 minutes and my soups was served ( it was cold) and I almost finished that and the waitress came over with another bowl of soup for my friend and she said \" start with this, I'll get you food in a bit\".  Another 20 minutes went by and she brought my salad. The salad looked as if it was sitting out for a while and I had asked for no dressing just greens and BBQ chicken. The salad was drenched some sort dressing. My friends food showed up a few minutes after and he only ate a half of it. We had tickets to see a show at the Hard Rock at 8:30 and arrived at Mr. Lucky's at 7 pm to have time to eat. The meal, service and food were disappointing. There were several other people there were seated after us who ordered and got there food before we did and ate, paid and left before we were served. We have eaten here several times before without any problems.  Please see second review below.   On 5/12/17 we were here again to eat before the Journey Concert. Our server was friendly, quick and very attentive. She took our order and the food arrived just as we ordered it. They were full in here due to the concert and being a Friday night. Our service was better than a day or so ago. We never have any issues here at Mr. Lucky's at the Hard Rock so the rating would have to be a 5 star rating as usual. This place is a great place to have a meal or snack. We will be back.",

We were not disappointed with the food, everyone enjoyed what they ordered. You MUST get the French toast, it is the best I have ever had! They are covered with crunchy Frosted Flakes super  yummy! The portions for French toast and pancakes were huge so sharing is not a problem.  I could not give them a 5 star because they did not offer a kids menu and the service was slow considering the place was pretty empty when we visited.",

However is it open 24/7 in a city that never sleeps, you bet your ass. It has gone through renovations along with the casino, but is a great late night eatery or a place to grab a bite after you have gambled all your fun money away or better yet treat you friends to a late night meal after you have cleaned up on the casino floor.   Overall the five star is more for their convince, than the service and food. I always enjoy what I eat, however, the price would dictate a four star rating (its a little crazy to want nearly $15 bucks for a basic 2 eggs, toast, and bacon meal. The late night service is still decent, its a bit slower obviously at 4am with a smaller staff, but its filling and you can order from breakfast to dinner.",

This place is in the Hard Rock hotel next to the casino, so make sure and bring a sweatshirt or something because it's freezing in here. It's a little on the pricey side, but most things are in the larger hotels in Las Vegas. The service has been pretty good each time, regardless of how busy they are.

Also, they're avocado toast IS amazing. It's not huge, but it's not small either - but worth the flavor! And, they're open 24/7!!!!!!!! They have good quality salads, as well - like dark greens!!!

A hearty medium cooked steak just pink enough in the middle and seasoned decently. The eggs and the hash browns we're pretty basic, but after a rough night of drinking I just needed to be brought back to life.   Like I said, the service was slow and I only got one coffee refill. Maybe I wasn't so lucky.",

    "text": "My friend and I were staying at the Hard Rock in June and made this one of our must stops to eat at while we were in town for 36 hours. We were hyped this place was open 24/7 so we could stop in at any ungodly hours of our stay. The menu sounds like a real hit unfortunately, it did not live up to the hype and expectations we had.   We roll in around 6am, no one at the greeting stand so we wait awkwardly until someone decides to come up after 5 mins of waiting, I noticed a few of their employees looked at us standing there but did not come up and assist with seating us. Also mind you there was 1 table that had people at other then that the restaurant was DEAD!  So we finally get seated and order food and drinks, drinks and food took FOREVER to come out which idk why they had about 4 waiters on staff and full kitchen staff just standing around. The manager noticed I had an annoyed look on my face due to wondering what the hell was taking so long and he said our food would be right out. Food finally came, nothing was to write home about. The Nashville Hot Chicken wasn't spicy at all, you can get a hotter one at KFC. The bacon was cold and bland, I asked for a side of butter for my waffles that took an additional 10 mins so by the time I got it my waffles were cold. This place is a joke, do not waste your time or money here. I cant imagine what this place is like on a busy day.",

I mean, I'm the first to say that Yelp ratings are typically spot on, but unless Mr. Lucky's is different than it once was I'll have to disagree with this one.  Steak. And. Eggs.   Seriously, this was the best \"diner\" style steak and eggs that I've ever had. Most places serve a sad and slim piece of beef but not here, friends. This cut of NY strip is big and was cooked absolutely perfectly. Drag each slice through the runny egg yolk and you're in heaven.   Will I be back to Hard Rock again? Probably. Will I be back to Mr. Lucky's again? Absolutely!",

Because me and my friend were hungry, we opted for the nachos with chicken and steak as well as the spicy bacon burger.  Our server was really friendly and the service was fast, but I found the food to be very average quality. The nachos has cubed pieces of chicken like the ones you defrost from a microwaveable meal, and the steak was very tough. For being supreme nachos, there wasn't much variety in the toppings and everything was bland. The guac is what gave the dish the most flavor, even the cheese didn't have a kick.  The burger was good, the patty was nice and thick. It was juicy and cooked medium well the way I like, but it wasn't very memorable. It was seasoned enough to give it flavor and there were some veggies to top off a normal bun. The fries were okay as well, overall nothing special or exciting about the meal but it's what was open late night.",

Yes it was super busy in here and staff seemed really limited on a Friday night.   Ordered the pot roast and everyone else ordered the steak and eggs. Overall I'm shocked that they wouldn't serve this special of $7.77 since it seems so famous even on Yelp! Well no more they don't have it.  The food was alright but our main idea of even coming here was to get the deal. Overall if your looking for this steak deal they do not have it and everything on their menu is about $20.00.",

We each signed up for a Player's Card so we could partake of this good deal.  We were immediately seated since this 24/7 restaurant was almost empty. We were given the 24 Hour Menu which didn't include the $7.77 special. The explanation was that the kitchen was being cleaned. Wow...we were so disappointed.   I settled for the Farmer's Market Omelet with Fresh fruits and Wheat Toast. I was starving, so I devoured everything...even the unripe cantaloupe. I chomped on the wheat toast and wondered why the two pieces of bread were different shapes.   One slice of toast was square and the other was from another loaf.  Oh, well...they taste the same...haha!  I buttered my toast, but the cold butter didn't melt on it.  I finished my Omelet with ketchup because the cheddar cheese alone didn't provide enough flavor.   Overall, I was satisfied. Service could have been better, but our waiter did fill our water glasses,  make separate checks, and gave us a dollar off each meal with our Players cards after we asked about it. We seemed to wait a long time for our order to be taken. While waiting for my meal, I played some video poker and won!    Alana and i went back the next day to get the $7.77 special.  Our server said that it had been discontinued as of November 1, 2018.  Why didn't the first server tell us that the day before?    Needless to say, we left and went elsewhere for dinner.  How disappointing.   On a positive note... we appreciated the free parking and enjoyed looking at the rock and roll memorabilia!",

Intrigued by some of the menu options seen online, we were looking forward to a culinary adventure. Ummmm.... no one told us that at 9pm on a Tuesday night they clean the kitchen so their full menu isn't available. We got the \"short menu\" which was only a small selection of the menu. Bummer.   Our group ended up ordering breakfast items. Honestly, not much was looking good on the menu and we had debated leaving and going somewhere else. The restaurant was empty. Literally. Empty. Isn't this Vegas?? We were starving so we stayed.   Breakfast was just breakfast. An assortment of omelets, chicken fried steak and a regular egg dish with bacon. Eggs were over cooked. Not sure what kitchen cooked our breakfasts, but it wasn't the kitchen here. Over medium was actually over hard. Over easy was over medium and lacked gooey ooze. Meh. Quite a disappointment all the way around. We are leaving here full, which is a good thing, but by no means satisfied. What a sad meal.   I definitely won't be back. Too bad because the items on the regular menu actually looked pretty good.",

On to the food. The presentation was nice. I ordered the Nashville hot chicken sandwich. I've eaten plenty of these. There wasn't even a remote hint of hot. The slaw was overly wet and the sandwich tasted mostly of thousand island and pickles. I will say tho the side of ranch I requested was very good.   As a local, I probably would never recommend this place to anyone. Only reason I came this time was bc I had family staying in the hotel.",

I got the grilled cheese sliders and the tofu rice bowl. He got the cheese quesadillas and the pesto pasta. It was okay. The portions are huge. The cheese sliders were enormous. More like cut sandwiches with Texas style bread. It comes with tomato soup which tasted like it came out of the can. The quesadilla was okay, very cheesy but nothing special. The rice bowl was horrible. I couldn't even finish it. Service was good. The waiter was fast and attentive to our needs. Overall...a good place to go if you are drunk at like 4 am or if you are up late with no other options close by.",

    "text": "My only reason for going to Mr. Lucky's because I was looking for a cheap meal, and heard of the Gambler's Special that cost $7.77 and consisted of steak, grilled shrimp, mashed potatoes, and side salad.   I told the rest of my party and they agreed to try it out so off we go. I knew it was at or by the Hard Rock. I never been to the Hard Rock, so this would be a first for that as well.   I was expecting some run down place to be honest with you. Most of the places that offer cheap deals like this usually are. Hard Rock seems to be a nice place of its own.  Mr. Lucky's is conveniently place right by the casino IN the Hard Rock. It's open to the casino floor so while your dining you can people watch. The staff here at Mr. Lucky's is very friendly and helpful. Our waitress was great.   As for the food, there was only one item my party was getting. It is NOT listed on the menu, but they are aware of it. They ask how you like your meat cooked and what dressing you want on your salad.  I was a bit skeptical on the meal being so affordable for such a nice looking establishment.   The salad is served first, and it was not a small basic salad I was expecting. It was a pretty good portion garden salad that was very fresh with dressing on the side. The steak and shrimp came shortly after. Cooked just like I asked for. The shrimp however took the spotlight from the steak. It was goooooood. The steak was still satisfying and no complaints there.  If you are looking for a bite to eat and are on a budget, yet still want to impress, stop by here and order the Gambler's Special.   As an added bonus, we got a booth with some drunk club chick who was stood up by some guy who started hitting on some other club girls who were sober, while leaving the girl she came in there with drunk and falling over around in her booth, and then followed by throwing up all over herself and her table. Management came and spoke to her, didn't hear what he said to her but I have a feeling it was, \"I'm sorry but you are causing a scene and if you don't pick yourself together and leave we will have to escort you out of here\". Shortly after a bunch of big guys came in suits, and with a wheelchair rolled her out of there.   haha, some might have been disgusted, I called it dinner and a show..",

    "text": "Granted, every restaurant should have great service. But c'mon, you gotta do some research to find the path of least resistance. So here's the advice on that path for Mr. Lucky's. Use your casino card to get off-the-menu steak and shrimp for 7.77, must order a drink with it. Sit at the counter to get the best service, watch when your food comes up, and get it hot and fresh. Don't be afraid to send it back if not cooked right. The shrimp was delicious tonight, buttery light charred garlic herb outside and moist tenderness inside. I had to send the steak back because it wasn't cooked as specified and a really tough cut of beef. They corrected it quickly and replaced the first 3 shrimp that I already ate, awesome! It was cooked perfectly the second time. Our server, Niki, was pleasant, made good suggestions, and didn't get flustered although she was slammed. Even the green beans were tasty enough to finish off, garlic and butter seared. This place is good but they will tend to understaff it to cut costs. So be smart from the start.",

Still, it's a cool room and the food is good. They used to have daily specials, but my past few meals here have been late night so I don't know if they still have the specials. People like the $7.77 special, but I don't like it too much. The 3 shrimp you get are kind of dinky and the cut of meat they use for the steak isn't the best. It is pretty good for the money though and it is edible, which isn't always the case with all the steak specials in Las Vegas. If they are running the all you can eat prime rib, I usually get that. They give you a big cut each time and really do let you eat as much as you want. The servers seem to actually get a kick out of seeing how much you can eat.   It's a good place. Service is usually pretty good. Give it a shot and don't judge it by the steak special alone.",

As we were finishing our meal, the server came back to our table and asked \"are you done?\", to which I promptly replied \"yes\" and he said that he needed our table for a party of 8.  As uncomfortable as that made me feel, I brushed it off. I'm in the service industry and I can relate to a busy night, but the lack of interaction by Ramiro and his overall impersonal demeanor, will encourage me to never return. The food is a solid 4, but the service is a 2. So overall Mr Lucky's is a place I won't be returning.",

Really nice guy, I saw him before the show too, but was too intimidated to say anything then, as I was sober at the moment haha. At Mr. Lucky's, I asked him what his fav band/artist is. He said it was Neil Diamond. He had alot of surprising answers to questions.  Anyway, this is a good place to go after a night out at the good ol' Fruit Loop or after a show at the The Joint or the pool :)",

Like a bed bug you can leave your bite track at Mr. Lucky's 24-7 at the Hard Rock hotel as it is open around the clock.  Now there are deals that are not on the menu but spread like herpes over yelp reviews, those are the:  $7.77 Steak shrimp deal $9.99 All you can eat Prime Rib  The second deal, I just found out about and didn't get a chance to order, but my friend and I order the lucky 7 deal and my other friend ordered the club sandwich.   The lucky seven comes with 3 moderate sized succulent shrimps. The cut of the steak was fair for the price you pay. It is grilled to your preference, for me medium rare is the only way to go. My friend ordered her's medium well. The ice cream scoop of mashed potatoes were unremarkable, a little gravy could have helped. Also there's a salad that also accompanies. Not a bad meal for a baller on a budget!",

    "text": "Family came into town last weekend and we desperately needed 24 hour food service. Since we are off the strip, I worried that we wouldn't have anywhere to go without a taxi ride, but then, we found Mr. Lucky's.   I enjoyed my experiences here. We actually ate here three times, and each time it was fine. My husband devoured the tater tots that came with a massive container of ranch. We both had the 7.77 special, steak and three shrimp with mashed potatoes. Everything was fine. For 7.77 I wasn't expecting Carnevino-quality food. I loved it, and it was perfectly cooked in every way.  That night, a standard drunken breakfast was in order, so I got steak and eggs plus some breakfast potatoes. From what we all remember, it was all delicious, perfectly cooked over easy eggs and the steak was again cooked a perfect medium rare.  The next morning, we hobbled into Mr. Lucky's after a very short wait and sat for breakfast. Up to this point, the service was fine and our food came out in 12 minutes. This time, the service was okay, but our food took almost 30 minutes to get to the table, and the waitress didn't stop by to inform us of the longer wait until 2 minutes before the food came. By then, we already knew it was going to be a longer wait for food.  My sister got a Belgian Waffle that had a guitar design in the middle of the massive waffle. My husband said it was good and she said it was okay for $15. I liked that it had the design and was geared towards the casino crowd.  My sister's boyfriend ate steak and eggs which was again, fine. My husband got the huevos rancheros and they were surprisingly good but needed a little heat and spice to make it even better. I had the corned beef, and it was not too bad. I like my corned beef has to be a little crispy on the edges and with a little less potato, but it was fine and I enjoyed it.  Don't expect fine dining here. It's a 24/7 spot and amidst being near Nobu, it doesn't advertise itself as anything other than a nice diner with casual eats and decent service. If the restaurant is busy, know your food is going to take a while, but if you're worried about that take the shuttle and go to the strip and get something else.  *** UPDATE ***  Mr. Lucky's (and most of the restaurants at Hard Rock Casino)now has a gluten free menu which includes gluten free pancakes and a gluten free Belgian pancake. I did try the Belgian Waffle with chocolate chips, and even though it wasn't anything incredible, I love that they are even more GF friendly and that people with this allergy have more options!",

    "text": "Why did I only discover this place last night? And why did it take an out-of-towner to suggest it?  True to the cafe's name, they serve a Steak and Shrimp dish for $7.77. Lucky number 7 was on the money last night. Sure I was a little drunk from the Open Bar event at the pool, but I'd have to say that was one of the best steak specials I've ever had. It's not as cheap as the $3.99 Steak and Eggs at South Point, which is pretty good in its own right, but you get what you pay for. The cut of meat was pretty flawless and cooked perfectly. You also get a skewer of 3 shrimp, a mound of mashed potatoes, and a side salad.  To be honest, the steak is on the small side, so that might throw you off a bit in this land of plenty. However, I'd argue that it's the perfect size. A couple of people ordered the all-you-can-eat Prime Rib for $9.99. I tried some that was cooked medium and it was tough. My steak blew that prime rib out of the water. I convinced my cousin to get another done medium rare and it was much better, but still not as awesome as my steak.",

    "text": "I've been coming here for the past couple months.    The service sucks.  The food or the chefs are so inconsistent with their food and presentation.  I always order the sides or the extras on the dinner/lunch or breakfast menu.  You can order basically whole meals for $8-$12 if you order a few of the sides.  I usually get a garden salad with ranch, a side of tator tots or fries, and the Mac n Cheese (which they literally change every time).  I don't know if a chef messes up every week making the Mac n Cheese but it's different cheese almost every week.  I recommend getting the short stack of pancakes since it's the same thing as the $12 order of pancakes on the menu.  I have also been to one of their group interviews for a server position here and the manager said they pride themselves on their excellent service.  All I could do was laugh to myself in my head because their service sucks but some of the servers are nice.  I have also ordered the chocolate cake a couple times and it's been different both times.  I just don't get this place and how they can be inconsistent with simple American diner food.  Also, their steak special is a good deal but the steak is the cheapest slab of meat that money can buy.  I don't even know what part of the Cow it comes from but it's very thin and cheap.  Good deal though for $10-$12.",

A group of us six girls got seated right away and everyone seemed pretty happy with their food. I ended up ordering a pesto chicken sandwich that came with a side of fries and a pickle. The only complaint I had with my dish was the bread fell apart as soon as I bit into the sandwich. Probably from the oil or whatever they used to make the chicken. The second visit, a group of us (four) decided to grab some late night grub. I ordered the chicken quesadilla, which was grease heaven. It was a mediocre quesadilla. My friend got a banana split and you would naturally assume that would take the least amount of time making out of quesadilla and a flatbread pizza. We had to flag down a different waiter to check the ETA of the split. Our waiter came a few seconds later to tell us it would be out soon. The banana split was pretty big...definitely enough for two to split. Halfway as my friend was eating her split, another friend had asked if there were bacon bits in her ice cream. That would probably explain why her split tool so damn long. We're thinking that they had completely forgotten about the split and were in such a hurry that they accidentally grabbed the wrong shaker. We first thought maybe we just missed the minor detail that bacon was on the split, you know since there's such a big bacon craze. We were laughing by the end of our meal...I wish I had taken a pic...maybe next time!",

She seemed a bit bored after playing for a \"short time\", which actually meant 6 hours at the table.  Turns out she was Randi from <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.savelv.com&s=9cf19c890b565255d595afc92b41ba8907b708a6e1c045ab789d7b326b2b55a4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">savelv.com</a>, which is a really great online resource for finding free and discounted things to do and eat around Las Vegas.  Aside from being a good resource for food deals, she also knew some interesting Vegas factoids (like that the tallest Christmas tree on display in the US was this year was a 109 footer at M Resort, north of the Strip).  Taking her advice on steak deals around town, our hero made a mental note of the off-menu special at Mr. Lucky's in the Hard Rock casino for the next morning.  The $7.77 secret special for an 8-oz. steak, mashed potatoes, and 3 shrimp on a skewer is a steal of a deal that's available 24/7.  It comes with a basic (but fresh and leafy) salad as well.  Our hero had his steak medium rare, and it was cooked to perfection with nice blackened criss-cross grill marks on it.  The cut of the steak was surprisingly good for the price and was very tender and moist.  Our hero's hungry and hungover cohorts ate it extra slow so that they could savor the juicy meat.  The mashed potatoes on the side were excellent and tasted very smooth and creamy.  Even if you aren't lucky at the tables, you can still get a lucky deal on a meal at the Hard Rock!  PROS: - Excellent off-menu $7.77 steak and shrimp special. - Friendly service that checked up on us frequently.  Even the manager walked around and personally checked on all the diners.  CONS: - The regular menu items are somewhat limited and they have an odd combination of Western and Chinese food to choose from.",

We waited roughly an hour for our food to even make an appearance; what appears to be the manager comes out with two of our dishes with no mention of an apology for the food being so late. About 10-15 minutes later, the rest of our food arrives, one meal of which was done incorrectly so we had to send it back. They were transitioning from breakfast to lunch and we saw people getting their lunch food during that hour we were waiting for our food, so it was extremely frustrating to see that.  The waiter, very nonchalantly and awkwardly, mentioned that our food took so long because sports were on tv. Not an apology, not an excuse. It's March Madness in fucking Vegas. Put more people on staff. Thanks.  The only reason I am giving this place an extra star is because it was actually a pretty tasty breakfast. Would I go here again, though? Absolutely not.",

A coworker and I needed a quick bite to eat and all of the other options seemed too slow and were were on a time crunch. We stopped by here and had definitely come to the right place for a quick meal. It was fast and easy...and not too bad.  I had the French dip - the fries were really thick and kind of soggy but the sandwich was pretty good. We remarked that this place probably wouldn't have tasted so good had we not been travelling all day and had we not been ravenous.   We had a hard time getting our check toward the end as our service had slowed down some but it served our purpose and we were full.",

I've been here many times before and overall think the food and service is good.  Tonight I got the hot pastrami sandwich for $12.  A little pricey but I expected that with being in the Hard Rock.  Black pepper pastrami, pickle chips and dijon mustard on a marbled rye bread.  I'm not partial to rye bread as I think it's a little dry, but with the mustard and juicy pastrami, it works!!  I loved how much they gave in this portion.  My tummy was doing a big dance!!  If you want to treat yourself to a good meal in the Hard Rock, check this place out.  They're 24/7!!",

The last time I came in here, I also ordered a clam chowder, and I found it to be slighter better than average.  There were chunks of clam, which I love, but the soup was slightly runnier than I like it to be.  The service is always fast and if they screw up your food, there's like 10 other workers who will offer to fix it for you.  It's a good late spot for late night cravings.",

I think it was the attraction of the $7.77 steak and shrimp that brought us here and kept bringing us back.  When we turned 21 this was the place to come and people watch from morning until the wee hours of the night.    The food is actually good.  Had the usual steak/shrimp combo, and was not disappointed.  Steak was a little overcooked, but not overdone.  We also had the chicken nachos, which I think are fantastic.    90% of the time we walk out and say how we are not going to order the nachos, and what happens...we order them again.  But it's worth it.  Not to pricey (even by Hard Rock standards) and you can get a seat by the walking area and people watch as you down your lunch.",

I was about to order the country fried steak and eggs in an attempt to get somewhat of a fix since our Tuscany trip failed, but thanks to Yelp, I found out about their steak and eggs special! $7.99 when you order a drink. My group and I were really excited so most of us got the steak and eggs but a few were more intrigued by other items on the menu. I got a medium well steak with scrambled eggs and wheat toast. The portions were large! Two slices of toast both cut in half, I feel like that's a lot of bread. The eggs were great, but the steak was so so disappointing. It was so dry, I couldn't even finish it. I ended up wishing I ordered something else.   TL:DR 3 stars for sad, dry steak.",

The food was acceptable, the coffee mediocre, the coffee cups pretty nifty, and no difficulty getting the check and getting out of there.   The TVs over the counter had sports on, with no audio, so I watched about 15 minutes of titles of people talking about the NFL referee lockout. Fascinating.

Usually at the wee hours of the morning after a super late night or late dinner.   I have to say that I've been happy with breakfast, lunch and dinner options. Tasty French toast! More than Delish mini pizzas. Excellent burger and fries! I'm telling you, you can't go wrong with the food here.   I am sure the steak and eggs is next on my list to try! Hard Rock has two good places to eat.  Mr. Taco is good too!",

    "text": "Good value if you stick to the specials and is open 24/7 to fill that late night void.  The Lucky 7 has unadvertised specials (Thanks to my fellow reviewers at Yelp! Without you I would be in the dark!)  Try the $7.77 special consisiting of steak, potatoes and salad or the $4.99 breakfast special of steak and eggs. These specials are NOT on the menu so you have to ask for them! Keep in mind you aren't getting gourmet fare for those prices but a basic, tasty, comfort meal. The mashed potatoes were not homemade but instant. It's OK to fill the void at 2AM when nothing else in the complex is open. If you are on a tight budget you can eat  well with the Lucky 7 specials.  They also have some Asian selections that I eyeballed which were artfully presented and looked delicious but when we were there at 2am a group of people had placed a large Asian order and we were told that since there was only 1 Asain chef preparing meals at that hour, the wait would be longer than if we ordered off the regular menu. The regular menu consits of salads, sandwiches, burgers and familiar Americana fare.",

Atmosphere: Just a regular restaurant in the middle of a casino nothing much.   Service: Our large party was served by two servers. One whom was an excellent man and kept our water food and made sure everything ran smoothly. Another was a lady who couldn't even put on a normal facial expression, and took her sweet time doing her work.   Food: I ordered the luck 777 deal which was 7.77. Decent price for vegas food. Comes with a steak, hash browns, grilled shrimp and salad. Warning, when the chef cooks your food your Rare will end up well done, so how you order your meat cooked add on another two levels to that. You can imagine our faces when we saw the food of some of our friends that ordered well done, more like well burnt. I even decided to give it a second chance for a rare steak, nope well done yet again. I didn't even want to waste another 7.77 to eat another steak so I cancelled the order.   Overall: Do not go here, not worth the 7.77 no matter how cheap that is. I would rather shell out the extra money to get decent quality food at McDonalds.",

Serving, obviously, all meals, all courses, including desserts and drinks, Mr. Lucky's was a nice respite from the crowd for late dinner on a pre-New Years  Eve weekend.  Located inside the Hard Rock Hotel, it's easy to find once inside. We were seated on the spot and were visited by our waitress quickly. Water showed up almost immediately. Food didn't take long either. Hubby had a club sandwich that was more impressive to look at than to eat, according to him. I opted for the Blackened Chicken Alfredo. I probably wouldn't get it again. It wasn't bad, but I've had better almost everywhere.   Service was decent, covering pretty much everything. No big missteps. Not terribly friendly, but we probably didn't foster that either, being road weary and hangry.   It's...fine. You'll get a decent meal without spending a fortune; your mom would be happy.",

This place was hopping at 6PM but there were still available tables although seating at the counter seemed to be a popular choice.  We were shown to a big booth which I preferred over a table and chairs.  The menu has all day breakfast in addition to sandwiches, burgers, and salads.  I wanted something 'lighter' than my previous dinners we had in Vegas where the portion sizes were big so I decided on the Lucky's turkey club sandwich with a salad.  The side salad was a decent size served on a plate.  Nothing special with iceberg lettuce, other vegetables, and the dressing on the side.  The sandwich was 2 halves served with a pickle.  It was like the other meals, and very big portion.  There was so much turkey in the sandwich, it was more than I would eat on Thanksgiving and I could barely fit it in my mouth.  I ate half and gave my husband most of the other half.  Although lots of food, turkey was a little dry.  For $12, lots of food to devour.  The server was good at bringing us refills on our drinks.  Decent food and service.",

At dinner, my party melt was really overcooked (they asked if I wanted medium, I said yes, it came out cooked like a nuclear fire had worked on it for an hour), and was wildly unappealing. Similarly, my breakfast was overcooked - over easy eggs were nearly deep fried, toast was dry and really terrible.   Disco fries were good, though. Fries, cheese, bacon, gravy. Those were tasty.

It looks pretty basic from the outside but I would highly recommend it to anyone staying in the hotel! If you're coming from elsewhere, honestly, you can do better, but it's a convenient little joint with a great view of sad-looking men playing the slots at 10 am.   I ordered the Triple Deuces and added strawberries to my pancakes. The pancakes were huge and so delicious, the bacon was great, and the scrambled eggs were sad but passable.   The good thing about the coffee is they give you a mini pot to pour your own refills. The bad thing about the coffee is the way it actually tastes. There's good diner coffee and then there's this, which was not even worth the caffeine intake. I tried consuming it just to feel like, \"yeah, I'm on vacation and I'm drinking coffee in the morning,\" but it didn't work. It sucks. Don't order it.   My gluten-free sister LOOOVED her pancakes. Fluffy, moist, and flawless. She says that normally GF stuff is dry and crumbles when you eat it, but these were so exceptional that she wondered if they were poisoning her with real pancakes on accident. Nope! Just a job well done. Good for you, Mr. Lucky.",

Our server was impatient with us when we reacted to the price hike of the special, and didn't give us time to reconsider our order.

Not your cheap, break-your-teeth croutons I dread with most salads; crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.  Oh man.  I am fangirling just remembering.  The veggie burger was also delicious.  (Then again, it's hard to go wrong with veggie burgers, since I've never met one I didn't like.)  Plus, they're open 24/7, and the prices are good for Strip or near the Strip.  I'm sure I'll be back here again.",

Later I looked into Yelp and see everyone orders the $7.77 steak and shrimp special, and most people really like it.  So here is my bottom line:  we sat down and thought the waiter was a nice guy but we ended up buying $24 worth of burger plates that were just OK.   So I'll have to say I wasn't happy with the service and the policy of a \"secret off the menu\" item that we missed.  I'm sure our waiter appreciated the nice tip we gave him even though he didn't help us.  Thus \"2 stars\".",

This place is two streets south of the strip but because of construction, detours and then getting lost it took us about 45 minutes to get there. Ridiculous. Unfortunately, it wasn't worth the trip. It's a run of the mill uninteresting restaurant that looks out on casino machines and has no atmosphere. I ordered the veggie burger with fries. The waitstaff are the one positive note. They were super attentive about making sure my meal had no dairy and the service was fast. However, the veggie burger just wasn't good. Whatever combination of veggies they use to make it just wasn't my forte. My boyfriend had a french dip. He didn't like it either. Definitely wouldn't recommend this place.",

The only good value is the famous off-menu $7.77 special, which gets you a salad, steak, shrimp, and mashed potatoes. It's decent enough, like something you'd make at home.

I'm 60+ years old and this was the toughest piece of beef I've ever been served. I was even tempted to send it back(which I have only once that I remember. ) but I was running out of time to go to the show so I decided to eat what I could. If I'd not been pressed for time, I would have returned it.

It was also so moist that the texture of the cake was that of the same as the cream cheese frosting. Yuck.",

The meat was lukewarm and not flavorful AT ALL.  I'm pretty sure they were the worst sliders I've ever had.  The fries were ok, so I tried to compensate for the very mediocre sliders with the fries, but potatoes just cannot substitute for meat. I should've known better.  Service was not very good.  The server screwed up on a couple of our orders.  Totally not coming here again.",

Others in my party were not as disappointed as I was, but I really was sad about my meal.  The eggs, ordered \"over medium\" which is supposed to have a runny yolk and firm white, had very runny whites.  The grits were tasteless .. I had to add a lot of salt and I rarely need to salt anything except eggs at breakfast.  The shrimp was definitely not even recognizable as whole shrimp and definitely not blackened.  The sauce was marginal and pretty spicy even for a Cajun-type breakfast.  I shared a side of pancakes, which was decidedly the best thing I ate, and the Farmer Brothers Coffee was good.  This meal was on Super Bowl Sunday so maybe the cook wasn't paying attention ... but I wouldn't go back.  I couldn't even finish the skillet, and that wasn't because it was too big :(.",

My friends thought I was a genius because I knew about this little trick. Could not eat it all both times. Steak, jumbo shrimp on a skewer, mashed or baked potato and a salad. The salad was ridiculously big and the ranch was yuummy!  If you order to go..they charge a buck and it's still worth it to eat on the floor of my room. Service wasn't spectacular.  Ate breakfast here one day on our trip and wasn't impressed with the omelette...too much milk and cheese and not a lot of veggies. Go cheaper and get a few eggs and hashbrowns. Perfect before you hit mid-day drinking :)  What a deal! I heart you Gambler's Special!",

She said it was homemade there and it was great so i ordered it! After a few minutes my food came. Low and behold the chicken fried steak was the pre-made nasty ones! Arg! I was disappointed. The food wasn't that great. My over medium eggs were sooo frigging runny i could have scrambled them on my plate. My bisquit was hard as a rock. I couldn't even cut it with the steak knife.

    "text": "after moving to vegas, i needed a few \"local\" spots to hit up. went here for the first time because of a review i read about an AYCE prime rib and their red velvet cake (which is no longer on their menu. sad face.)  AYCE prime rib is definitely tasty! comes with mashed potatoes and veggies. the au jus is on the plate for you, which kinda sucks because i'm a dipper and because the potatoes soak up the au jus. the 2nd piece wasnt as great as the first, but that was expected.   since i wanted dessert, i ended up getting the apple pie, which is absolutely amazing! its served on a skillet and the server pours caramel right on top of the ice cream and it trickles down the pie and on the skillet. im a little picky about the apple:crust ratio and it was perfect! probably not as good as the red velvet cake that no longer exists, but it definitely cured the sweet tooth.  since its a 24/7 spot, we come here a lot during midterms/finals to grab a study meal/comfort food to get us through exams. and of course, when we're craving prime rib and dont wanna drive to fremont street [i cant remember the place, but we went last year and it was the best prime rib ive had out here! must research...]  the ahi sashimi salad is good. as well as the beef dip, french onion soup, cobb salad and the mr luckys salad. still thinking about trying their asian dishes...but we'll see if i ever get to that [asian food in an american chain isnt promising...just sayin].  definitely a fan, and will be back for sure :]  note: avoid going on rehab sundays, unless you wanna deal with the hungover crowd that wants to get something in their system before going out to the pool to get wasted again.",

We were struggling to order food to meet the $35 minimum.  My husband and I both ordered the American Breakfast, his with bacon, mine with the sausage.  He loved his english muffin, and I was pleased they served egg whites and multi grain toast for something healthy to go with my saturated fat.  I would not order the sausage again, as it did not really seemed to be made of pork and had a weird flavor like it was some unidentifiable meat.  We also ordered a chocolate milkshake and it was very very good.  There were thick ribbons of fudge through the shake that gave it great chocolately flavor.   Still doesn't compare to the booze filled shake at BLT, but those were more than double the price.  I would go here again with <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> certificates as the check as under twenty dollars.

I heard of the 7-7-7 deal, which is a salad, steak, shrimp, and mashed potatoes for $7.77. When my friend told me about it, I didn't believe it. Seriously, $7.77? I was told it its not on the menu, which makes matters worse; I don't want to look like an idiot and order something that doesn't exist.  I was seated and got a cute hostess, I ordered my drink, and then ordered the 7-7-7 deal without any problems.  The salad came out first, which is a nice portion size and not too filling.  Up next was the steak, which I ordered medium rare, but seemed more rare than anything else. The shrimp and mashed potatoes were perfect. The steak was great, but was more rare than I would of liked. It'd been about 24 hours since the last time I ate, so I didn't care and stuffed it down.  The mashed potatoes were especially delicious and the service was just as great. I was amazed at the food, value, and service. I would of really liked to come back and try other dishes, but the nightlife in Vegas doesn't allow for any pre-planned plans.   However, I will be back, Mr. Lucky's 24-7.  Ambiance: 3 Stars (out of 5) Food: 4 Stars (out of 5) Service: 4 Stars (out of 5) Price: $ (out of 4) Overall: 4 Stars (out of 5)",

Chicken tenders, club sandwiches and potato skins have always been my go-to dishes here - and they've never done me wrong.",

    "text": "I've heard all sorts of things about Mr. Lucky's - most notably about the $7.77 special.  I tried to come here once around 1am or 2am and the line was prohibitively long so I just haven't had the chance to try it out.  Lucky for me (see what I did there), I had a meeting at Hard Rock this week, and it turned into a breakfast meeting.  I generally dont eat breakfast during the week, so this was a rare occasion for me.  I tend to save my breakfasts for brunch or when family is in town.  My plate of Huevos Rancheros would definitely fit the bill for either one of those occasions.  The tortillas underneath were crisp and the beans weren't mushy.  The ranchero sauce was chunky and spicy.  The best part is that there wasn't an oily layer of cheese like you'll find at Egg Works.  All in all, this was a pretty damn good plate of food.  I came here recently for a breakfast meeting, so keep in mind that I wasn't necessarily paying attention to the service or the attentiveness of our server.  She did leave a pot of coffee on the table for us, and I do recall her checking in at least twice - but we had a computer out and it was pretty apparent that we didn't need anything else so I won't say it was any reflection on her.  I'm only giving this three stars, however, because the prices are a little steep - bordering on room service prices.  I understand that this is a casino diner, but it's still a diner (and it's not like this is Center Strip).  Their standard breakfast of three eggs, hash browns, and a meat runs $15, and a short stack of pancakes is $10.   Pricing aside, I'll definitely come here again.  It's a nice place to know about if you're in this general area and want some decent breakfast food.",

There was another table that was also waiting for our mysterious server. It wasn't until we asked another server and talked to one of the chefs that our server finally showed up to take our orders. And that was the first and last time we saw him.  Shared potato skins and chicken nachos. The potato skins were dry and unappetizing. The nachos, however, was bomb! BOMB! Huge plate with goodness piled on! The roasted peppers gave the nachos a spicy kick. And the mixture of nacho cheese and melted cheese, guacamole and sour cream made this dish oh-so divine!  Still, the nachos did not make up the lack of service. We were wondering what that other table ordered since we were almost done and they still haven't gotten their food. And surprise surprise. Next thing we saw, a server brought out three plates of salads for that table. OMG.",

These people have no respect for teenagers/people who look like they didn't have tons of money.  We went downstairs to find food around 11-midnight and this place was open, of course after travelling we aren't in our expensive attire, so we go to pick up and we asked for menus, the lady was very nice and showed us, then we kinda found our way to their barstool area and waited to grab someone's attention.  We went up to one male worker and as my friend asked him a question about where to order he kinda looked at him like \"why are you speaking to me?\" A Very rude look.  If it wasn't for him, we probably would've spent more money! So then we get to this lady waitress and she gladly helped us, bless her.  So as we are waiting we kept getting weird looks from staff as if we were loitering when in reality we were waiting for our food so we could go to our room, eat, then sleep.  I expected more professional attitudes at this restaurant but I guess the Yelp reviews for the hotel in general are True.  Sucks, but definitely won't be returning!",

Its not on the menu, you just ask for it as steak and shrimp special.  this is really good quality steak and tasty.  Now there is a prime rib special not on the menu that i have not tried but how much of this can you eat in las vegas.

We were there last Friday we ordered the following:  A BLD salad which was a caesar-salad like concoction served on toasted rounds (really good), a Turkey Burger with Avocado, Sirloin Burger and Red Velvet Cake.   I would NOT recommend the turkey burger as it was not cooked very well and a bit mushier than it should've been. Needless to say, I did finish half since I was starving. The fries are really good.    M said his burger was \"fine\" and ate half as well. The Red Velvet Cake was alright; not too sweet and not too dry.

Intrigued i made sure to put this place on my list of spots to visit when i was in vegas.  It is located within the Hard Rock hotel. Opening the heavy class doors as you enter you are greeted with the sights, sounds, and smells of Vegas. People gambling, the ringing of the machines and the smell of cigarettes. You walk though the hotel into a \"food court\" style area with different restaurants and clubs to choose from.   Mr. Lucky's didn't seem to really shine in the middle of the other places, but we entered anyway. You stand to be seated, which only took a few minutes. The waiter was friendly and quickly got us our drinks and order. All we said was \"two 777 deals\" he then kinda quietly asked us how we liked out steak and quickly left. Not sure if that was to hide the deal from others or that was his personality. The meal was surprisingly good for only 7 dollars YES 7 dollars for Steak, shrimp,salad and potatoes. The meat was cooked as ordered and was nicely seasoned and tender. The shrimp had a great flavor and was seasoned nicely. The potatoes were almost whipped and had a very smooth texture. I was very satisfied and full after finishing my meal.  This is something you must do while in vegas especially if your on a budget.

But then the next four meals really wore me down to the bone. The food was simply sub par. I don't think it helped that a number of the meals I wasn't sober (although my guess is most patrons will be n a similar state) but one evening I had there pad thai and it was literally the worst pad thai I've had. One of the worst meals. I don't know what it was about it but the quality was just terrible.  The service was helpful, tasty bloody mary's and even a breakfast option that I didn't need to make a single modification to--The Rehab breakfast. So thankfully, the final morning I found out about their pool side lounge restaurant, not rehab, and loved the experience there (the view wasn't so bad either). I can't seem to find that on Yelp though.   Late night you can't do much else just don't get the pad thai.",

    "text": "\"LUCKY\" is what you'll have to be if you walk away from Mr. Lucky's 24-7 with a pleasant dining experience.  Here's why.  I've lived here in Las Vegas for 13 years and dined at Mr. Lucky's 24-7 numerous times, mostly after my guests asked about it and/or to take advantage of the dinner specials (e.g.: the \"off the menu\" $7.77 steak & shrimp dinner).  Sounds like a great special, right?  Well, THAT'S where the experience always derails at Mr. Lucky's.  First, the wait staff tends to greet you and treat you like they're doing YOU the favor of taking your order; they ALWAYS seem to have chips on their shoulders, which dampens the whole tone of being in the hip surrounds of the Hard Rock Casino/Hotel.  Second, they don't tell you that you have to order other items with the off the menu specials, like drinks, and it can get a little testy when THAT shoe drops.  Finally, especially with the $7.77 steak & shrimp deal, while the shrimp are usually just OK (often overcooked and spongy), the steak has ALWAYS BEEN AWFUL!  Every time I've purchased this meal, hoping it would be satisfying, the steak was a grisly, chewy, over-cooked shoe-sole slab of meat that tasted awful.  It has NEVER been a pleasant experience!  In fact, you'd be lucky to consume more meat than fat, gristle, bone or other un-chewable portion of the low-grade steaks they serve.  It's as if the \"chef\" deliberately asks for the worst shoe-leather grade beef from his purveyors to make this meal.  Shameful!  Here's a tip--go down the street to the Ellis Island Casino and Brewery (on Paradise and Flamingo), where for $9.99 you can get a delicious higher grade steak meal with steak, potato and salad AND a choice of freshly brewed beer or root beer (both which are brewed right there on the premises)!  The ambiance is a big step down from the \"hip\" Hard Rock, but the you WILL walk away thinking \"WOW! That was a really good meal!\"  SO, SKIP MR. LUCKY'S and head to ELLIS ISLAND JUST DOWN THE ROAD!  You'll get much more Lucky there. . .",

She's allergic to gluten and was really happy to see gluten free items on the menu such as flatbread, pasta, pancakes and waffles. She ordered the gluten free pancakes and confirm and reconfirmed they were gluten free before she started eating. She got sick shortly after breakfast and we weren't able to get lunch. We told the manager the next morning. The manager did everything imaginable to make us feel they take food allergies seriously.",

But apparently that backfired, because this place has seriously gone down hill since the most recent rebuild of the restaurant space because i hadn't visited in a little over a year. The 777 special still rocks at a good value although I've gone for the upgrade 999 more often than not, but so much has gone downhill with every aspect of the place from their slow service to the total lack of attention to the customers, to the poor food, and the very prevalent wrong food sent to wrong tables or extremely  incompetent servers . (I don't normally hold many servers at fault for incorrect food being served but as an example of the last 2 times I went there vegetarians were served actual sausage and gluten free people were served cartoned eggs and white toast.)  I want to love this place again but maybe as it has grown the charm and good service have been lost too. Oh well I'm sure next month when visiting the Hard Rock again I will stumble in for an amazing Black and White shake and maybe try the food again.",

To make sure I wasn't consumed by my hunger and fooling myself into thinking it was some of the best food ever, I came back during lunchtime later and tried some of their lunch specials to which I was again impressed with the caliber and quality of food they had prepared. The service was equally attentive at the late night hours as it was during the day. The decor is fun, makes for a trendy and hip eatery.

    "text": "We had an unfortunate experience at this location last night, 12-25. After a night of exploring the town,  we came back to our hotel anxious for a bite to eat. This was the only reputable spot open,  so we asked to get a table.    Though not even half of the tables were full,  The host let us know that the kitchen was backed up,  and his boss had told him not to seat anyone for 45 minutes.  Having worked in restaurants for years,  I understand that long ticket times lead to unhappy tables... While I've never seen anyone turn away tables,  I know this can be a rough spot for a restaurant,  especially if it's under staffed...   While we were told we couldn't eat on spot because of the kitchen back-up,  we were told that we could place a to-go order which would be out in 25 minutes..  This made no sense since a kitchen backup should affect both dine in and carryout orders. Ticket times for both should be the same.   Given the circumstances,  we chose to re-evaluate our food choices,  7 minutes later,  with nowhere else to go,  we chose to return to place a carryout order. We returned and noticed the host seating other tables.... The host informed us that they were now able to seat tables. We were confused,  irritated and couldn't help but wonder had this been something personal or just a show of poor restaurant management.   We were sat,  ordered an omelet and a salad,  neither of which were great and our server wasn't particularly friendly.   The food was ok, and I have to say it's truly  nice to have a 24/7 place to eat... Unfortunately,  the service,  especially on the part of the host was despicable.",

    "text": "So I give today's server, Marvin, a 5 star...I give the establishment 1 star.  This is strictly under the dietary restrictions that I have as a celiac. The restaraunt is convenient, service is relatively good, but extremely uneducated in regards to food allergies (I will go into further explanation).  After a week of coming here as I have been staying at the Hard Rock, I have been pondering where on earth I was afflicted with cross contamination. I have been enlightened today by my server (Marvin) who has gone above and beyond.  The menu has a few gluten free options... pancakes, Belgian waffles.... great, except I don't care to get fat on this trip, and well, those gluten free options are not dairy free. Little known fact (apparently), many people who suffer celiac disease cannot consume dairy..  I have learned how to piece together meals at restaraunts where the staff are not properly educated/aware/trained/give a shit  about food allergies, but I deal with it by asking questions and making myself knowledgeable of things I need to avoid. Despite my efforts to check what I could eat on the menu and  the reassurance of the staff (prior to Marvin) I have gotten sick and remained sick throughout most of my time here in Vegas. The culprit? The couple of times I ate hashbrowns and a salad where after consuming 2/3 rds of it, I found pieces of croutons.   If you peer at the menu you would see hashbrowns arent listed gluten free, I ask about the ingredients for each item (yes my body has forced me to be that person) and every single time until today (tuesday-monday) I have been reassured of the hashbrowns being potatoes and oil ONLY. The non gluten free aspect was simply the toast. Wrong, most hashbrowns use flour to make them crisper and these are not the exception (thank you lazy servers for not only making me sick but compromising my immune system for a couple of weeks).  So the food here is good but if you need to avoid anything in particular I recommend going elsewhere, unless of course you encounter the server Marvin who was capable in helping me find something to suit my cravings as well as dietary restrictions (corned beef hash utilizing the corned beef from the Reubens vs. The breakfast where it is cooked in butter and so on so forth).  Next year, unless something dramatic happens, Mr. Luckys will not even be considered a last resort for food. This was by far the best meal I have had here and most likely my last.",

No player's club card required.  For $7.77, the mash potatoes were delicious. Everything else was lack luster. Salad was salad. Shrimp skewer had three large shrimps that were a little heavy on the salt. The steak was never cooked right. I ordered medium rare every time and received medium, medium well, and well done instead. Since I could never track down our server and we had such a big group, I didn't waste my time trying to get them to correct it.   It can seem like a long wait since there's always people here, but the lines move quick. The servers are very good at refilling waters and running off as soon as possible before you can ask them for anything.   No longer doing the $9.99 AYCE prime rib. Sad face.  One star for the price. Another star for the convenience of it being available 24 hours. Oh, and the awesome mashed potatoes.",

    "text": "*cue old man voice* Back in my day (late '90s), this place used to be something, something good. Value and quality has certainly dropped since I began going to Mr Lucky's in '96 when the steak and shrimp special was $5.95 and you weren't required to purchase a beverage and included a salad. The lemonade back in those days used fresh squeezed lemons not the powdered/concentrated crap they use now.  These days, you can still find the off the menu steak and shrimp special (show your players card to get the deal), but for $7.77 minus the salad (really? how much money did you save by taking off the salad?!) and you are required to purchase a drink ($3 for a soda/tea/lemonade) so in reality, your special is not so special at $10.77. The steak, I believe has also shrunk in size since the special began. The two things that remain awesome is the grilled shrimp and the garlic mashed potatoes.   Service, even sitting at the counter is spotty at best.   If you happened to look at the menu for other food, it includes overpriced breakfasts and other items.   I guess if you are starving at 3-4 am, drunk, and don't want to stumble anywhere else outside of the casino, this will fit the bill, but I won't be rushing back here anytime soon. Instead, I will head over to Eillis Island for the steak, potato and beer special (which includes a salad!)",

The Tall Bloody Mary for $20 was awesome    It comes with a mini sausage waffle sandwich, large shrimp, and a pickle spear.  I asked for it spicy and strong and that's what I got.   Is it enough for a meal?... Not really.   I stole a few slices of buttered toast from my hubby's breakfast plate and that made it a meal for me.     So at 11:00am at HRH there isn't much to do.

If I were paying Bellagio prices this would negatively impact the rating. With a beverage and tip the $7.77 special adds up to approximately $14. In Vegas this is a value.

Contrary to some of the Strip casino cafes, Mr. Lucky's is expanding. There are additional tables and menu options. Recently they added to their Chinese food selection.

Open 24-7 Is it the best one? I think not but it gets the job done at 3am, 1pm, or 8am. Very convenient.  Meal #1  3am Sat. I had me a prime rib french dip . Pretty damn good, the added provolone was perfect and the au jus was not too salty came with fries $14   4****stars <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/BCAw9a_kyx2RddRH9tMmKQ?select=PFSFpAUNnnkEWOK7xpGDDg#ZGGpedpfIQZytPdLFb8Mxg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/BCAw...</a> It was bigger than the pic shows. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/BCAw9a_kyx2RddRH9tMmKQ?select=PFSFpAUNnnkEWOK7xpGDDg#aI12KGJQ0UQn4lNwXN3ZBg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/BCAw...</a>  I had to go back to the hotel to fetch my swim trunks for later on so I treated everyone to lunch. 1pm Sat. afternoon Meal #2  Mini corn dogs. My 6yo daughter loved them. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/BCAw9a_kyx2RddRH9tMmKQ?select=PFSFpAUNnnkEWOK7xpGDDg#SvQquFEig7bnz0iIJezYgQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/BCAw...</a> Nachos, Deep Fried Mac & Cheese, Buffalo Chicken Wings, my Son and I split these three.  With the Deep fried M&C and the wings we got our veggies in the nachos as they came with broccoli and chicken. 3***star average (nachos were kind of cold) <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/BCAw9a_kyx2RddRH9tMmKQ?select=PFSFpAUNnnkEWOK7xpGDDg#-sXr7xVDEOrK2jVxXpLhxg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/BCAw...</a> Others had: Spaghetti & Meatballs 3***star kind of bland sauce Chinese chicken salad no rating both said they liked it. Angus burger no rating but said he liked it <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/BCAw9a_kyx2RddRH9tMmKQ?select=PFSFpAUNnnkEWOK7xpGDDg#k0ojIzMlzJGaT7MvY1K9EA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/BCAw...</a> $110 for lunch with the family ....priceless  Had to be up early for a basketball game so with little time to spare back to Mr Lucky's I go 8am Sunday. Meal #3 This time I ordered huevos rancheros... good pick very flavorful and just the right size. the sauce and cojita cheese went well with the egg and avocado.  3.5*** stars.  Next time its the $7.77 steak n shrimp or the $9.99 AYCE prime rib deals for me. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/BCAw9a_kyx2RddRH9tMmKQ?select=PFSFpAUNnnkEWOK7xpGDDg#6vE7WYKbZh-08oDTqs0lUA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/BCAw...</a> <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/BCAw9a_kyx2RddRH9tMmKQ?select=PFSFpAUNnnkEWOK7xpGDDg#oLd6a_s2MkgnrIvfz6HN_w\">yelp.com/biz_photos/BCAw...</a>",

It was very annoying trying to have an exchange. When we gave our order, he didn't ask any of your basic questions, such as; 1.'What kind of bread would you like for your toast?', or 2.'How would you like your hash browns?'. When I ordered the pancakes, I mentioned WITH BLUEBERRIES. As soon as Clay heard the order, he immediately said 'Got it!!' and walked off.  Our food came out fairly quick, which was nice. First, the HRH Breakfast plate; I received wheat bread and barely-brown hash browns, 2 yolks w/ 1 popped, and sausage & bacon. Had Clay of asked how I wanted my breakfast, I might have received sourdough toast and well done hash browns.  Secondly, the Sweet Cream Pancakes w/ Blueberries; I received plain pancakes with 3 pieces of A single 1 strawberry. When I reiterated what I ordered, the rebuttal I received was, \"That's not what the ticket said\". Server Clay comes back and we send it back.  Throughout our meal, we got checked on twice... TWICE. Clay would repeatedly walk right past our table to speak with a single(1) gentleman sitting at the table right next to us. It became very bothersome for our server to walk past our table with zero regard. I don't want to call it discriminatory, but it very much felt that way.  This was my first time coming to and eating at the Hard Rock, unfortunately it will also be my last.",

    "text": "Thank God for 24-hour restaurants!   My husband and I were famished after completing the Rock N Roll Half Marathon. After battling the cold and rain and wind gusts for 13.1 miles, and making the trek back to our hotel to get cleaned up, and hopping in the car and getting stuck in ridiculous traffic on the strip, we were staring midnight in the face.   My cousin (who had a fabulous meal on her own while we were pounding the pavement) came with us to keep us company, and was the one who suggested this place.   They were doing a brisk business when we got there, but I was thrilled when we were shown right to a table. I was afraid we'd have to wait, as no good would've come from that. There were several other race participants at the restaurant when we got there, some still wearing their race day gear. Ick.   Anyway, our waiter was fast and friendly, telling us about the specials of the day - from entrees to desserts to shakes - before leaving us with the menu.   I know immediately what I wanted: the prime rib special for $7. It came with a baked potato and grilled shrimp. For seven dollars! I mean, come on!   My husband ended up ordering one of their massive burgers and the pumpkin pie shake.   The food, when it got to us, was yummy. The prime rib piece I got was massive, and I couldn't finish it. I had to wait a bit to flag down our waiter to ask for horseradish (who serves prime rib without the horseradish?), but used that time to dress my baked potato. They didn't really offer much by way of garnish, just butter and sour cream, but by then I was so hungry I didn't care.   My husband loved his burger, making quick work of it and the tater tots (an upgrade, of course). The shake was also very good, though the pumpkin pie flavor wasn't as strong as I would've liked.   This is one of those places I probably never would have ventured to, had circumstances been different. Still, I'm glad we went and that the food was delicious and the prices fair. Can't really ask for much more than that for a midnight dinner.",

    "text": "We 'just happened to be in the neighborhood', so we decided to give Mr. Lucky's a go.  Going to see John Carpenter playing at The Joint may have had something to do with it, too, BUT...  The food here is great for the HRH's version of a 24-hour 'nosh pit', something you can find in most of the major hotel/casinos. And as it goes with many of them, the portions at Lucky's are enough to take home and feed your entire neighborhood with.  Think I'm kidding? I started off with the sliders, which came with a HUMONGOUS portion of hot, fresh, crispy tater tots...just the way I like 'em.  I could have just stopped right there, but I moved on to the Lucky's Club Sandwich, because I wanted insurance that hunger pangs wouldn't keep me from enjoying the \"Theme From HALLOWEEN\" live!   I needn't have worried. To call this monstrosity \"generous\" would be a backhanded compliment.  I JUST managed to get through it, and when I was done, I couldn't have gone with dessert if I'd given it the old college try! Our server, Rick was great, and I'm really sorry that we didn't return for dessert following the concert, like we told him we thought we would.  I don't know if we'll be back to the Hard Rock anytime soon, but if YOU happen to go down there, ask to be seated in Rick's section, and tell him that Sam sent ya! And by the way - since I didn't have a slice of that killer chocolate cake I saw on the menu, have a few bites for me, mmmkay?",

    "text": "Mr. Lucky's has been bookmarked for quite sometime now and I finally made my way over there to try it out early this morning. Everyone knows that a steak dinner sounds the best when its 1am and you're in Vegas!  So, the steak dinner or the \"Gambler's Special\" is a steak cooked to your liking, a hefty amount of mashed potatoes, sauteed green beans and three grilled shrimp on a skewer. This special is not advertised anywhere on the menu, you have to ask your server for it. There are a few conditions to this deal-- you need to purchase a drink. It can be alcoholic or non-alcoholic. You also need to sign up for their players card beforehand, so you can get the special price of $7.77. If you do not have a players card, you pay $10. Not bad at all.  Even at ten big ones, I think that this vegas steak special is worth it! I have tried my fair share of steak specials from Ellis Island and other casinos, but Mr. Lucky's has the best quality by far. I've heard from a few friends that this deal has changed over the years (you can even read about all the changes in the yelp tips and the reviews, this deal has been around for a while)-- but even with all the changes, I still think this deal is delicious!  They also have tons of drinks specials (4 for $10 shot) if you are in the mood. I also am a fan of their disco fries (fries with gravy, bacon and all sorts of fatty amazingness)-- but then again, anything greasy sounds amazing after a crazy night in Vegas!",

I ordered a Blushin' Russian shake (shake with vodka) and I felt buzzed after 2 sips, haha. That never happens in Australia! A had a decent burger here too and a great breakfast another time. Solid! Not fancy.  I like it.",

Excellent food selection and went here 3 times during the weekend I styed at Hard Rock. I ordered a French dip & that was amazing. Ordered onion rings and tasted legit. A custom burger was well worth it and the staff just was exactly on point. Thank you Mr. Lucky 24/7 for the good food and services.",

After years of being bookmarked in my mind, I finally stumbled in during the wee hours of the night for their gambler's special.  The gambler's special is an unadvertised plate of steak, grilled shrimp, mashed potatoes and veggies for $7.77.  You have to have the Hard Rock Hotel's backstage pass players card and also purchase a beverage in order to get the special, but it's a good deal.  The steak was cooked medium, just as I asked, and it was good enough for a $7 steak.  I really liked the shrimp, they were a good size and seasoned well. The mashed potatoes were creamy and delicious too.  My friends and I enjoyed the food so much that we came back again the next night.  The second time we shared the Fire Roasted Nachos ($13.99) with chicken (+$3) and good thing we shared because it was huge! They were good nachos and the cheese stayed melty which I love.  Mr. Lucky's is open 24/7 so it's very convenient and they have many different specials depending on the day and time.  Make sure to get the players card because you get discounts on most of the food on the menu with it.",

Service was always excellent. Even my to-go orders were great. I highly recommend this place. The food is far better than most places and won't make you cringe when the bill comes.

As the name suggests they are open 24/7 and that goes for serving breakfast around the clock too!  We have dined here 2x already more because of convenience. When we found ourselves getting back to the casino very late one night, they were the only ones open so ,for that, we are thankful.  I have had the veggie omelet with potatoes and wheat toast. Very filling meal. On our second late night visit, I had the veggie burger which was decent but nothing special. Service is kind of hit or miss.   Also, obviously the restaurant is rock and roll themed so lots of cool memorabilia around the restaurant. There are even tvs playing music videos . Overall, decent and affordable place to eat if you're hungry . It wouldn't be my first choice for places in town but it sure saves the day for late night munchies!",

First off, the $7.77 steak and shrimp deal requires a drink purchase which isn't a big deal. But having just stumbled in from a night of quite a bit of drinking, I really just needed to hydrate. In this case, the boneyard steak and eggs on the Graveyard Happy Ending menu was exactly the booze mop I needed. Decently tender 7oz sirloin steak (especially for a plate under $10) with over easy eggs, toast, and hash browns. At 2am, it hit all the right spots.   I sat at the counter and the late night manager/server was absolutely lovely. For all-day comfort food, Mr. Lucky's 24-7 is a dependable diner with great daily specials to boot.",

Went with my standard eggs, wheat toast and well done potatoes and everything was perfect. The potatoes were nice and crispy on the outside and perfect texture inside. Coffee was kept refilled the whole time. Prices were reasonable considering everything in Vegas is so expensive now.

I am in Vegas for work and go to the diner at 5am for breakfast before I start my day.  The diner is empty except for a few ppl including our crew a total of ten ppl at most. The servers pay zero attention to the customers and when they finally come to the tables to take orders average wait time from the moment you sit is approx 15 mins we wait for an additional 30 mins for our breakfast to arrive. We get our orders to go and most of the time the orders are wrong. Oatmeal comes with fruit but if you take it to go don't expect fruit to come with it, and asking anyone other then your server for the missing fruit you are met with \"I'm not your server\". Tried switching things up and ordered cakes and eggs to go and when I opened the bag two syrup containers were not sealed and leaked not only in the plastic bag but all over my jeans.  I can't believe the service this establishment provides. I understand when restaurants are busy and the servers are running around for things to get mixed up but when you have four servers for ten ppl there is no excuse.",

We knew we would get a good Amount of food for a good price. Away we went and what we got was what we expected. Excellent service!!! Our waiter, I can't remember his name, was just awesome! He was prompt and attentive. The hubby chose country fried steak and got eggs and hash browns. I chose the blueberry pancakes. Yum and wow! The portions are huge for a reasonable price. And the quality of the food is outstanding. So yummy! Everything  cooked perfectly and seasoned well. My pancakes loaded with blueberries and delicious! Oh and my drink, the lifesaver, loaded with alcohol and only $9. I would and hopefully will be back.",

A little on the steep side but it is Vegas! Now we only lunched here but if it wasn't for the other staff giving us service we would still be sitting waiting for the  check! It is proper etiquette to inform the patrons when someone is taking over and actually introduce! Good food and back up staff make up the Stars!  Maybe an off day! They do serve a good cup of coffee !",

    "text": "The lure of the Gambler's Special brought my family to Mr. Lucky's at the Hard Rock Hotel. For $7.77, you get a steak topped with a skewer of shrimp, mashed potatoes, and seasonal veggies. The gambler's special is not on the menu and patrons must have a player's card to redeem this hyped up deal.  GAMBLERS SPECIAL x 3 ($7.77): The epitome of the saying, \"you get what you pay for\". My mom described the steak as a poor man's steak, and both my husband and my dad complained that there was a lot of of chewy fatty parts in the steak as well. My mom loved the green beans and mashed potatoes, everyone else not so much. My husband said the shrimp was chewy and over-seasoned, probably to mask the poor quality of the shrimp. Most people who rave about the gambler's specials are intoxicated while consuming their meal, so there's that. 2/5   VEGGIE BURGER ($13.99): A veggie burger made out of lentils and nuts piqued my interest, but the burger ended up being completely boring, taste wise. It had far too few toppings and needed some zing! It definitely could have been spruced up by some greenery or color of any kind. 2/5  SERVICE: All of the food was served room temperature and took 30+ minutes to arrive. It took a while before our waitress came to take our order. She barely checked in on us. Mr. Lucky's was not busy at all, so she just sucked. 1/5  Worth a Return Visit? Never again. This visit was below mediocre and the menu items basic. My husband argued that they could have gotten better steaks at Denny's.  YELP 100 CHALLENGE 2016: #3",

After waiting quite a while for food it came out but was not warm and was not very appetizing. The gravy on my Country Fried Steak and Eggs was very bland and tasted very much like processed gravy from a jar. My wife's scrambled eggs also seemed processed, not fresh. Overall it doesn't seem like they use fresh ingredients and that is reflected in the taste and texture of the food. Great atmosphere but not worth the price or lack of taste.",

SO, as soon as I cancel the order, the chef comes out to the table and addresses the situation. I was done..headache from cig smoke, 1:30AM and no food.... Did NOT stiff the waitress, but at least the chef on duty came out and apologized.    He said to come back and our order will be 1/2 off..well maybe in a few months..not anytime soon.

Nothing I've had has ever been horrible. But also nothing has been above average either. Service, for the most part, is usually always attentive and friendly.

Overall we were pleasantly surprised by the quality and creativity of the food, though i have to ding them a star given that if not for the freebie, the prices are a little on the high side ( though the steak special is a great price. )  The highlights:  Chocolate chip pancakes ($11) - chocolate chips and the ganache were high quality.  The maple syrup - delicious.  Chicken Tenders ( $11 ) - very crunchy and flavorful  Fire roasted chicken nachos ( $12) -  the chicken was so-so but we LOVED the cheese sauce.  Suggest you ask for the sauce on the side since for some strange reason most, if not all the sauce is at the bottom of the pan so not easily accessible.  Regular cheese is melted throughout the pile.  mini-corn dogs ( $9) -  five \"mid-size\" corn dogs had great crunch, and a decent beef hot dog.  NY half-half ( $18 ) - corn beef/pastrami - i personally did not try but my fried said it had a large portion of meat and tasted great.  Slight ding for the bread being a little soggy.  Reuben sliders ( $12) - we ordered without sauerkraut.   perfect combo of pastrami, cheese and thousand island and the rolls tasted great.  Bleu Bacon Cheeseburger ($14) - i was surprised how good this burger was.  I suspect some might feel it had too much bleu cheese.  I personally like more cheese.  The bacon and grilled onions and the juicy pink center - Yummy !  Spaghetti and meatballs ( $14) - need more sauce the two times we ordered.  Interestingly, they used different spaghetti both times.  spaghettoni the first time and standard spaghetti the 2nd time.  The meatballs were tender and great meat mix.  Chicken parmesan ($16) - big chunk of chicken, crispy and nicely coated.  Side of spaghetti.  The garlic bread is below average.  pics added  Average/below-average :  Mac and cheese fried bites ( $7) - more cheese please ( maybe use the queso sauce from the nachos !)  Desserts - not much of a selection.  we tried the shots of dessert ( $3 each; 5 for $10) The cherry cheesecake was good.  The creme brulee - ok.  we actually ordered the heavy metal banana split but later canceled the order - i'm guessing that was the dessert star !  Next time i hit Hard Rock for a concert, definitely going to Mr. Lucky's after.",

Mr. Lucky's is ok, and even more so because of the prices they're charging...a cup of coffee will set you back $3.99! How ridiculous!   The gf and I had a Hard Rock Breakfast and country fried steak, which both came in decent portions. I ordered eggs over medium and they served them over easy, which made them extra runny which I don't like. Our toast was also burnt and too dry to eat. Seriously, how easy would it have been to re-toast some bread and serve it correctly? Our 2 breakfast entrees and 2 coffees came out just under 50 bucks with tax and gratuity since we had a large group, which is a fortune to be spending on breakfast, especially at a diner style place like this...  We also didn't have any utensils until we asked for it AFTER our food had arrived. Other than that, service was decent, and we kept getting our waters and coffees refilled. They also cleared out our plates as people finished their meals and they were able to split our checks into groups of 2 or 3 people, which made it a lot easier for us to pay. And because of that...extra star, otherwise this would've been a 2 star review  Not sure that I would be back for breakfast unless I was stuck at HRH and didn't have a choice. I did see that they had an AYCE prime rib special on Sunday afternoons/evenings that I might have to come back and try, but only because I know I won't get gouged!",

    "text": "sorry to report Mr Luckys has gone down hill from what it used to be years ago. The menu has changed and no longer has such favorites as BBQ Chicken Pizza and Shrimp cocktail . We were seated way back in a corner , that hard to see, maybe that's why our sever did the minimum trips to see if we needed anything  like refills on out drinks.  The food was fair , nothing special So after over 20 years and many trips, this was my Last to Mr Luckys",

    "text": "Great late night spot.   Want to eat but still maintain your buzz? They've got a 4 shots for $10 special running all the time. The Conundrum shot was pretty good - it's Kahlua and Bailey's with some whipped cream. Nice for a nightcap, or at least to tide you over for a bit.   I kept it simple and got a burger, which tasted good enough but by the time it got to me the bottom bun had soggified (I think that's the scientific term...) due to the juices and heat of the burger. I hate that shit. But luckily this was pretty late at night and I may have imbibed a bit, so a freshly-cooked burger is a step up from the kind of crap I normally would shovel down in that situation.   I need to come back and try their boozed-up shakes, which I hear are awesome.",

    "text": "I visited Las Vegas for 5 days and a friend coincidentally came in during my visit and staying at the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino.  She recommended us having dinner at Mr. Lucky's 24/7 Cafe because they were reasonably priced and the food was decent.  I had previously read about their $7.77 Steak and Shrimp dinner, so we agreed to have dinner there.  First of all, the restaurant was near empty and the service sucked.  We were waiting for about 20 minutes before the server even walked over to greet us. She apologized for the delay but it was still uncalled for being the restaurant was near empty. I didn't find the restaurant to be that reasonably priced at first sight of the menu.  I asked about the $7.77 Steak & Shrimp meal and the server told me that it was that price as long as you ordered a beverage.  I ordered the meal. It was a 6 oz Steak with 3 grilled Shrimps on a skewer, mashed potatoes and string beans.  For the price it was adequate. The taste was good and service size was decent.  I do feel the Steak special at Ellis Island Casino & Brewery (see my review for that) is a better deal for a little bit more $ but this wasn't bad.   The onion tower was huge but over priced.  The onion rings were very tasty but not worth the price.  The tater tots side order was enough for the entire table and more.  It was priced well.  I enjoyed my meal, but there are other places around that are much better quality and better service.",

So on Saturday and Sunday I ordered the Chicken Fried Steak for breakfast.  It was pretty good. Anywhere I go, if a place has chicken fried steak, I'll try it.  This place did not disappoint.  On Sunday everyone at my table ordered Chicken Friend Steak accept one person, because I thought it was good. After they tried it, they were glad they ordered it.  It has the right amount of batter to meat ratio.  I didn't like the coffee shake.  It didn't taste like coffee, and Jack in the box can make a better shake.  But I will go there anytime I stay at the Hard Rock and really there is either this or the Pink Taco. Pink Taco was good too, but that is another review.",

I went for the noodle bar which was being advertised outside the restaurant. Too bad the noodle bar is closed on Mondays and Tuesdays... and I was there on Monday. Instead, our FABULOUS waiter Anthony suggested the teriyaki bowl which I had with chicken and the teriyaki sauce on the side. He even went and got me some of the chili sauce they serve through room service. He really made our dinner enjoyable. I had enough leftovers to last for TWO more meals.   We also had the chicken nachos as an appetizer because one of my friends could not wait until a beer or two in to order/enjoy dinner. Surprisingly they weren't super heavy. I didn't eat much of it but there was still plenty of leftover after three of us attacked it. The queso was really good, the chicken was tender and Anthony brought us the garlic habanero hot sauce (which wasn't so hot but definitely tasty) which topped off each chip nicely.  One of our friends ordered the chocolate cake with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Very rich but SO good. We all had one bite and were happily satisfied.   We also had the $25 off $35 from <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> which worked out great. For the nachos, $7.77 special, teriyaki bowl, dessert and 3 beers we paid $35 including tip and tax. The portions make it worth it.  The trip I previously made to Mr. Lucky's involved late night eating after throwing back a few drinks. I remember having one of their breakfast specials and MAN, it was amazing.",

It is pretty much just a diner thats open 24/7 and you can usually get seated with little or no wait. Food is average, service is average but I still gave it 4 stars simply because of the variety and flexibility of their menu...if you have a group of picky eaters that all have a taste for something different, this is the place to go. You want pankakes at 7:00pm...they've got em...you want a flatbread pizza at 9:00am they've got em. You name it and they've got it 24/7. Like I said the food is average but I have never had a bad meal or bad service in all my visits. The simple fact that I have eaten there so many times and never really had a bad meal or service puts them at a 4 star rating in my book and the fact that they usually have little or no waiting is novel in a town with no clocks LOL.",

    "text": "Hostess was nowhere to be found. 3 parties were standing at the entrance confused as to whether we were supposed to seat ourselves. When we finally did get seated our waitress was just as scarce as the hostess. It was easily 30 minutes before we finally got our order taken and she didnt even ask if we wanted anything to drink. This was when the place was only like 1/4 full.   While we waiting for our food to come a table was sat to our right. They grew visibly frustrated as they waited...and waited...We told them it takes the girl like half an hour to realize she has a table. Eventually the manager, looking awfully professional in jeans and a polo, took their order and blamed it on his son \"falling behind\". So I guess his son was the cook, or one of the cooks...For how slow he was he's lucky daddy scored him a job.   We finally got our food and the waitress never even asked to refill our waters. Waters we only got because one of the bus boys brought it. We finished eating and knowing how useless our waitress was we just got up and asked for a to-go box ourselves. Then we had to find our waitress wherever she was hiding to get the check so we didnt have to wait another 30 minutes just to be able to finally get out of there.   We confronted the manager and all he could muster out of his useless mouth was, \"Yeah, I dont know what happened.\" Not even an apology. You're a manager and you dont know what happened in YOUR restaurant? How pathetic of a worker do you have to be? What happened was, the manager is useless and should be fired. He hired an equally worthless staff including his son. All of that equals a place that shames Las Vegas.   I know Vegas is a tourist town and these places dont have to rely on repeat customers but for the love of all things holy, have some professional pride. If I was a manager and that was the experience I was providing my customers I'd quit the job because I obviously am terrible at it. This pathetic human being could care less what service he provides. It takes a special kind of crook to pull that off.",

Food was prepared in 10 minutes, but our waiter took 30 minutes to serve it (we saw the cook serve it up under the heat lamp, but didn't know for sure whether it was ours until the server brought it to us).  By the time we received our food,  it was cold, rubbery and tasteless.  The breakfast potatoes were oily and chewy.  The eggs were cold and seemed more like room temperature jello than sunny side up eggs.  Even the check took 20 minutes to bring despite the fact that the place was nearly empty and our waiter was not waiting on anyone else. Oh well. Can't win them all in Vegas. On the bright side, our waiter seemed friendly enough when he took our order and when he brought the check.",

    "text": "Had our AYCE Prime Rib fix for $9.99 the other night.  It came with side veggies and mash potatoes.  The roast itself was a bit chewy and tough (mid-rare).  My lady and I thought it was bit barbaric halfway through the meal since the quality was controversial, but we did managed to get most of it down.   I mean sh*t, we paid for an AYCE, so we might as well go for seconds too right?  This method of flagging down our server for the next serving was a trial because the timing can be tricky. We're more accustom to buffet style when we're having Prime Rib.  Once you're acknowledged the server would have to put your order in again, and you'll have to wait until your next plate is delivered.   The waitress put our 2nd order in and was nice enough to bring us a to-go box for our leftovers.  During the drive home we decided it was best to just toss it away.  Something about our food did not settle well with us.  It was not worth the risk to keep it.  Kind of bum because I love Prime Rib and was hoping this would be my new spot for it.    side notes: -Your next serving is just the Roast in Au Jus minus the sides. -The Sour Cream Horseradish Sauce must be requested.  -Nearest restroom is in the new HRH -$7.77 Steak and Shrimp special -$9.99 AYCE Prime Rib (4pm-4am)",

I've stayed at the HRH tower before, so being so close by and staying a few days in town, we had to eat here at least once!  The decor is pretty nice! They have a rather large space and can accommodate quite a bit of people at any given time. Prices here aren't bad. The breakfast here isn't to die for but it isn't bad either. I've had the chance to eat breakfast food and also things like the chicken soup.   Overall it's a place to check out if you're staying at this hotel. I can't ever think of any good places to catch a breakfast so late and this place definitely comes in handy on my Vegas trips. I hope they've bumped up their customer service since  I was last here in Feb. It was the worst! My waiter not only forgot our drinks, neglected our table, and did nothing but talk to other workers, laugh around, and talk to what looked like customers that were just standing around waiting for who knows what. When those people left, our waiter still took his time getting our meals that were already plated for a while.   Although disappointed,  I know that miserable experience won't discourage me from neglecting this place. I have had too many goods here to reflect on this one bad.",

You get a salad, mashed potatoes, two skewers of succulent shrimp, and steak.  note that: if you ask for your steak to be cooked at medium/rare or however you desire your cow, sometimes it doesn't come out that way. i don't know if they suck at cooking steak or what. but for $7.77, I ain't going to complain and I will continue to make a stop here every time I am in Vegas.",

Its one of the best deals going out there.  I was here a couple days ago, and it looks like they are expanding, which is great news since this place can get crowded at peak hours.  It does seem to take a bit for your food too arrive, especially after a night of partying, but its worth it. I have never been there with anyone that didnt really like their food.  Like I said, the gambler's special is great. Hard to beat a salad, mashed potatoes, a shrimp skewer and a well cooked steak for under $8. Its not the best steak you will ever have, but thats not why you come to a diner type eatery.  Do yourself a favor and hit this spot on your Vegas trip.",

GJ Yelp :)   My wife and I had just gotten out of an MMA competition and were STARVING! Of course, I jumped on the Yelp app, which lead us to \"Mr. Luckys\". I glanced through some \"Tips\" and saw that they have a $7.77 gamblers deal, which was off the menu, and sounded great. After we were seated, our waitress came over, took our drink order and asked if we had any questions. She told me I had to have a players \"Backstage Pass\" to get the $7.77 deal, and directed me towards the players reward desk. She was nice enough to put the order in while I went and picked up my card.   My wife and I ordered the \"Chicken Nachos\"(refer to pic) to start. They were good. The cheese, which was smothered throughout, was gooey, deliciousness. The nachos weren't amazing, but they were very good and they were served on a hot skillet. Pretty cool presentation for sure. The $7.77 special(refer to pic) came with a salad, (looked like) 8oz Strip Steak topped with 3 grilled shrimp, and mashed potatoes. It was rather large for the price, and extremely tasty as well. My steak was cooked to a perfect medium. It was very juicy and flavorful. The shrimp, on the othe hand, were rubbery, and I actually forgot they were on the plate until I looked back at the picture I took. My wife ordered a bacon cheese burger, which she thought was good, but nothing special.   The restaurant started to become packed, so we didn't want to keep the booth occupied for any longer. The waitress, even though she was noticeably busy, was still on point, and got us out the door in no time. The only thing I noticed while enjoying my meal was, all the servers, and food runners were not happy, and walked around like they were the s#%$. I know, I was in the \"Hard Rock Hotel\", but at least look a little happy when all these guests, including my wife and I, are putting $$$ in your pockets. Other than a bit of pretentious attitudes(not from our server), the place was good.",

Not on the menu, you have to ask for it, which gives you an insider status with your server and with your friends who you tell about it. And in my case it's been dozens of friends.   This year, the steak & shrimp was a disappointment. The steaks were uniformly tough and gristly, the salad is now a $1.99 add-on, and your choice of potato is mashed and that's it. There used to be garlic in the mashed potatoes and they served it with butter for the shrimp and/or potatoes but the shrimp has a spicy rub on it now so butter would be superfluous. The vegetable -- there were garlic green beans and broccoli -- was fresh and well prepared, but by then it was too little, too late.  You also need a players card, adding a little inconvenience (especially if the server never asks to see it) and the service is spotty, with some servers STRONGLY recommending ordering a drink and others totally cool with whatever you choose to order or not order.   I can't recommend it any more.",

It comes with a steak, 3 shrimp, mashed potatoes and broccoli. The steak was overcooked and very chewy, the shrimp was overcooked and the mashed potatoes and broccoli were extremely salty. It was horrible. It was my first meal in Vegas and I'm getting this?? Really! Yuck.   We went back on our last day to try breakfast since the rest of the menu didn't look too bad.

Sometimes service can be a bit slow but I will say go between the breakfast rush and the lunch rush if you can - Lines to get seated can get long...",

We ordered the graveyard specials: - New York Steak & Eggs - 8 oz NY Steak, two eggs, hash browns and toast for $4.99. The meat wasn't the best of quality, but it was a good-sized steak. And TOTALLY WORTH IT for 5 bucks. We had $25 steaks for dinner earlier that night at Mon Ami Gabi, and we felt much better about this one. Blame it on the alcohol? - Burger Basket - classic old-school burger and French fries for $3.99. Not so good. The burger is smaller than I thought, and it was extremely dry. I had to steal one of my bf's runny eggs to stick in my burger in order to redeem it.   I say stick to the steak. For $5 you won't be disappointed. And your wallet will thank you :)",

The service is not spectacular anywhere in this hotel (known fact), but we usually get decent service here and the food is great and quick enough.  The only restaurant open 24 hours at the hotel.",

The other great value wash the steak and egg's for $5.99 now thats gone!!!!! the prices are now ridiculous!!! I'm not a cheap skate at all but I can't justify paying $14.99 for a three egg omelet thats half ass good!! I've lived in vegas a long time this place was packed all the time years ago and you walk by it now and its not even half full. So sad won't get my business any more!",

No players card the price goes to $6.99.  Add a egg its 3.99.  Very average food.  Total bill for a simple, nothing special breakfast was $15.10.  Don't mind paying the price for something good but this was a Vegas rip-off. By the way this was my first review and I use this app all the time.",

The perfect meal to satiate even the mightiest case of drunken munchies.  I also came back for the Prime-rib special between 4  PM and 4 AM. For ten bucks you get a cut of prime rib, mashed potatoes and some mixed vegetables. My buddies and I were finished with out plates when our server came by and asked if we were ready for another \"round of prime-rib.\" We all smiled and shrugged it off as we thought he was joking, but it actually turned out to be all you can eat! We couldn't eat another bite of beef but for those who might be interested, all you can eat prime rib for $10 bucks at Mr. Luckys!",

It had been a long time that my husband and I had gone to Mr. Lucky's but we were recently in Vegas and craving their prime rib. When we sat down we didn't even look at the menu as we just wanted the same delicious prime rib that we always get there. Needless to say we were heart broken when our waiter told us that they don't offer it anymore. We ended up leaving and going to a different restaurant :(",

    "text": "Being a born & raised Vegas girl I appreciate the 24-7 spots that cater to locals. In fact, I've dined here at least 3 times previously and enjoyed it. But as such places like Firefly, and Joes Crab shack, this place has just FELL OFF!  First, I ordered a Luckys Bloody Mary because it was served with a celery stick, a slim Jim, and belvedere Bloody Mary flavored vodka. Well I do not believe I was served even one of the 3, they simply got a house Bloody Mary from the closest bar. We ordered (between the party of 3) a chicken fingers appetizer, 2 locals $7.77 specials, and a half&half sandwich. (Half pastrami half corned beef) Now let me first say, I don't expect much when I order a $7 steak. Other than it to be cooked, medium, how I ordered it. Instead of bloody and barely warm. My shrimp- undercooked and fishy. The only good thing on the table was the pastrami which is why this review has 2 stars instead of 1. Did I mention our food and apps all came out at the same time? Before the people who were next to us and ordered before we arrived. I could see their flames of anger as we were served. Also, the service was just eh. Not horrible but by NO means good. Bottom line, this place knows the tourist keep em alive, so what's the point in good food and service?! It's officially off my list of late night dining options!",
