    "text": "This order is for delivery service only.  This place is usually hit but sometimes miss. Of the several times we've ordered, the food has been delicious almost every time (we recommend the beachcomber scramble and blue Hawaiian smoothie) however literally almost every single time there was something wrong with our order, some small mix up (regular eggs instead of egg whites, extra cheese on the wrong dish, etc). This time we ordered two of the exact dish but one with extra chicken. They both arrived with extra chicken which is fine except there's a charge for it and we didn't want it on the second item and one arrived with the toast and potatoes it's supposed to come with and the other one inexplicably just didn't, the sides just weren't there. This type of thing is just extremely annoying but not worth complaining about and waiting for the correct food to arrive.  That's the next thing... The wait. They say the food will be there in 45 minutes to an hour but it's almost always 30 minutes late (takes about an hour and a half) like it was today. On the upside, it arrives very fresh with the food hot and smoothies still frozen.  There is only one time that was an absolute disaster. We didn't eat more than a few bites of any item. We aren't sure if this was due to our food choices as we had tried some new things off the menu or if it was due to whoever was cooking that day. Everything was soggy and tough. Blech..   In the end, we keep ordering from here so it's obviously not that bad. It's usually delicious, just a little mixed up and late. If they fixed those two things and were open a little later for us night owls it would probably be perfect.",

It is a little hard to find as it is hidden by a gas station,  Maybe I'll give them another try one day.",

The customer service was friendly and we were at least updated on how the progress was going with our food.  When we got the food it was pretty good.  My husband and I shared French toast with strawberries and whipped cream and it was just what I was craving.  I also had the Cali Bene which is a different take on eggs Benedict that adds tomato, avocado and spinach to the classic dish.  It came with home fries which were also good.  I would definitely eat here again.",

I'm a server so I know how it goes. But I have never and would never give such terrible service to anyone. Working on the strip being slammed, dealing with drunk and obscene people I have not even treated them so poorly, yet for us being the only guests in the building? There is no excuse for not once saying, \"You're welcome,\" after I say thank you multiple times upon receiving waters, food, the extra roll up we asked for, her taking our order... She just turned and walked away each time. The only time we received one was when she realized she forgot the smoothie my boyfriend ordered at the end of our meal and finally brought it over. We received no proper greeting, no social interactions, nothing... Not to mention when she finished taking our orders she just threw the menus on the table next to us and left them there. On top of it all she never even gave us her name. She was probably aware of her shit service and didn't want to risk being called out.   On to the filthy restaurant and terrible health standards of our server. Upon walking in we immediately realized the floors and tables were disgusting. There was dirt and pieces of trash in the corners on the floor next to us. The manager along with our server and another employee were all handling a dog, which yeah not really okay to have the dog behind the bar but I would have let it slide had ANY of them bothered to wash their hands. Our server literally held the dog and was petting it, turned around; and grabbed the gravy I had asked for off the food window... Brought the gravy to me, bussed some plates, answered the phone, handled money, and put some items into a fridge all without once pausing to wash her hands. I was disgusted to the point where I debated even eating the food she brought to me. The other employee didn't even bother washing her hands after handing the dog off then going to portion ice cream.. Do they even have health cards? Working in the restaurant industry for the past almost 7 years now and attending culinary school, I cannot fathom how these two even managed to get hired at a restaurant.   Here's to hoping the kitchen staff know what  health code is.",

    "text": "I walked in and experienced the same thing Raymond B. did: stood in the middle of the room and looked like a lost sheep. After a minute of deciding I didn't have time to wait around, I sat at a table in the corner.  After no one even looked my way for about 5 minutes, I thought, \"Okay, maybe this is an order-at-the-counter kind of place\". So I walked up to the counter and asked if I could order. The lady at the counter seemed sincerely surprised that I was there, and said I could take a seat as she called the waitress over. The waitress apologized for the wait and after that bumpy start, service was fast and friendly.  I was dying for a smoothie and realized that they had all the tropical flavors I loved, so I ordered the Hawaiian cooler. I didn't realize that they didn't use fresh fruits, like I was expecting, but the smoothie was tasty nonetheless. A little on the sweet side for my tastes since they use fruit juices from the box, but with a little water mixed in it was fine.   I had the fish tacos, which had fried pollock according to the menu, and they were really, really delicious. My only gripe about it is the salsa. I prefer a salsa verde with fish tacos because I think the tomatillo is a better complement for fish, but they didn't exactly have a salsa bar going so I didn't ask them about it. If they had at least 1 other salsa option that wasn't red and didn't taste like something pre-made, I think I'd definitely say these would be my most favorite fish tacos in town. Also, I thought they would come with tortilla chips, but they didn't and normally this would be a huge no-no for me but the order actually came with 3 really yummy tacos so that was more than enough to fill me up.   I'm excited to come back and try their breakfast menu because... well, because I really freaking love breakfast food. Also, the sandwiches on their menu looked really good too.",

    "text": "Its unfortunate that this place has such horrible service because the food is good when you actually get a chance to order.  We have been here a few times for lunch and finally are sick of the poor service and will likely not go back.  We attempt to go here for lunch from time to time during a lunch hour from our regular 9-5 jobs.   This is borderline impossible.  Today we waited for five to ten minutes while we watched the wait staff take a phone call and help two counter customers who came in after us without even acknowledging we had entered the establishment.    We got our own menus off of another table and were ready to order if someone would just acknowledge that we were there.  If we had to wait for our menus until the wait staff finally got around to us then we would have probably never gotten them.  The only time the staff acknowledged our presence is when we walked out to go to a different establishment, one who was more sensitive to our time constraints.",

The worst I've ever had. She forgot our drinks we had to remind her. The food took decades to come out and only 3 out of the 5 meals came out at first then it took another 15-20 min for the other two meals to come out. I asked for sauce on the side got sauce all over my food. Sister asked for no bacon she got extra bacon. Friend asked for ranch dressing with her fries never got ranch. Asked for a refill on ice tea got a cup of water back. Asked for ice tea again got a fly in the drink. If she wasn't so goddamn busy trying to flirt with these guys maybe she would have been able to pay attention to what we asked for and we would have left a tip and would have given a better review.",

Food was ok, but the big thing was that one member of our party found tac pushpin (bulletin board kind) in his potatoes.  It was in his last bite of food... Luckily he found it before swallowing it. Not quite sure what was going on in the kitchen, but we seemed to be singled out. (Since everyone else was getting food in a timely manner, and I think we were the only ones to get a push pin).",

My 7yr old usually ordered the cafe breakfast and substitutes the fried potatoes for fresh fruit, and the folks here are always accommodating. The fried potatoes are fresh. Nothing frozen about them.

Found out later that they came with fries, though the menu didn't specify that so I'd ordered an extra side. The burgers were pretty good, cooked properly, and the toppings were fresh (no slimy lettuce). They also got the special order correct, having left the tomato off one of the two burgers, which is nice--it's easy to find a place that will add things correctly, but harder to find one that remembers to take them *off*, or at least remember *not* to put them on. The fries were pretty good; it's hard to entirely gauge the quality of food when it's been delivered after a decent amount of time by a third-party outfit, but we were pleased with our meal and I'd order from this place again.",

She actually had a chair behind the counter and was eating a knife and fork meal. I waited to order and for minutes, she never looked up from her plate. Finally she came and took our order, and went back to eating. She did not wash her hands anytime in between and then brought food.

However, I quickly discovered that it was a nice homey little local diner.   The food was tasty, but nothing mind-blowing either. We tried the Frisco Bay Burger (1/4# burger w/bacon, cheese, avocado, 1k island dressing on grilled sourdough) and the Reuben sandwich. Both tasted a little bit oily, but had good flavor. They have waffle fries and crinkle fries available and both are good as well. If you like Arnold Palmers (1/2 and 1/2 ice tea and lemonade), they have a Sun Kissed Ice Tea which uses their tropical blend ice tea and lemonade--easily my favorite part of the meal.   Overall a good experience. It's nice to have a cozy local place to visit.",

Here was our biggest issue - There were two other people in the restaurant and we waited WAY too long for our meal, now I didn't actually time it but here's my best idea: The kids came out first, after over 5 minutes, then they were 1/2 finished, then mine came out, hmmmm, where's my wife's scrambled eggs??? The kids were done, I was more than 1/2 done, then hers came. What was the cook doing? Seriously, no one else there, it took about 20 minutes. But here's the kicker - a few people came in while we waited for our food and a guy that looked like the owner just sat there and talked to some girl the whole time. I guess he wasn't concerned about running his business and he definitely wasn't concerned about us. I am not a restaurant trasher on Yelp, and I hate to rate anything this low, but I felt inclined to share. There are too many other restaurants trying their best and this place isn't one of them.",

    "text": "Great breakfast. Great service. Fun theme and atmosphere. I had the biscuits and gravy, which was about the best that I've had so far at a restaurant in Vegas. I'm from NC & I'm very picky about gravy,  especially breakfast gravy \"country style\". Beach Cafe was a vey close comparison to True country style sausage gravy that I'm accustomed to. I will definitely go back for the biscuits and gravy.  My husband had the breakfast sliders, which he said were really good and would have them again. Our server was very friendly and helpful with our choices. A huge plus for Beach Cafe is that they also deliver. Their menu has a lot of healthy choices for breakfast and lunch and they also serve breakfast all day. I will definitely go back, probably my new fav breakfast place!!!",

    "text": "It is common knowledge among my friends and family that I am a fanatic when it comes to brunch. That being said, there is nothing worse than a lackluster plate of eggs. Oh, but I'm wrong! Couple mediocre eggs with poor service, Beach Cafe showed me all sorts of low.  Walking in, it is generally expected for you to seat yourself - after you overcome the awkwardness of glares from the bar patrons in the back. Service was generally slow, leaving us to scramble for menus and wait a few minutes before even being greeted.   I had ordered the Cali Bene - eggs benedict with avocado, tomato, spinach with a side of home fries. One of my friends stuck to her favorite of chicken fingers (with the sole intention that the ranch was made in house). While one of my other friends, wavering with indecision, chose the Redondo Beach Egg Salad Sandwich with a side of Chicken Tortilla soup. The food came out promptly, so I'll give the Beach Cafe that. However, taste was lacking. Hollandaise sauce soaked half the plate, which normally I do not mind. However, it was so salty that I attempted to dissect the parts of my benedict that had not been attacked with sodium. After three minutes, all hope was lost - my Cali Bene was fairly inedible. The home fries were decent, better in comparison to the salt fest next to it. As for my friends' food, the chicken fingers were good (not a difficult accomplishment). My other friend quickly demolished her soup (as much as I love brunch, so has the same affinity for soup). However, her egg salad sandwich was primarily two pieces of bread with a thin layer of egg salad. I took a bite, and was unimpressed - my school's dining hall has done better.   What really set in my apathy towards this place was the lack of cordiality demonstrated by both the staff and the longstanding patrons. After a couple had left the restaurant, one of the staff members had engaged in openly mocking and criticizing them. The heckling riled the customers she had been talking to, and soon spread like wildfire. My party felt fairly uncomfortable afterwards - both out of shock for their lack of propriety as well as the fear that our departure would result in insult.   Honestly, mediocre at best food. Service was fairly nonexistent, at best spotty. The only thing that could remedy this was 99 cent ice cream far, far away.",

The first time I ordered food they told me there was no delivery charge since I lived so close. Huge bonus to me! But when I ordered today delivery they charged me. Then when I went to pay the guy thought on top of the delivery charge I was going to give him a $10 tip! Didn't even ask if I wanted change! It was so awkward, when I asked for change he just looked at me baffled! I live 2 mins from the place, paid a delivery charge and the guy really thought he deserved a $10 tip! Then he forgot my drink in his car and was going to leave without giving it to me. I've never felt so uncomfortable and awkward in my life. Needless to say I will NEVER order from this place again! And I eat takeout like every day so they're really missing out on a great customer.",

It was a small little place, but we were immediately welcomed with friendly smiles from the entire staff.  Everybody was extremely pleasant and cracked a few jokes here and there.  The menu was bigger then I had expected, and a lot of the menu items looked really good.  I ordered a breakfast scramble with potatoes and a smoothie.  I thoroughly enjoyed the meal.  It tasted like a breakfast I would make at home.  It all tasted very fresh and the potatoes were deeeee-lish.  They had a little sitting area outside and I am very excited to come back with the dogs and have a nice breakfast outside.  I'm a fan!",

When I arrived my order was all ready to go, love that I didn't have to wait. The sandwich itself was nothing special though in my opinion, and not really worth the price. The fruit cup was the best part, it came with kiwi, pineapple and melons.   I may try Beach Cafe again but I'll order a different sandwich.",

My wife ordered the Cale Bene Eggs Benedict ($8.75). She was very satisfied.  On the second visit: I ordered, what has now become, the best biscuits and gravy ($4.25) I've ever had (used to be the B&G at the free breakfast for guests of the Abby Inn in Cedar City, UT). You get 4 melt-in-your-mouth biscuits, with a perfectly peppered meaty gravy. For $3 mor, you get 2 eggs + bacon or sausage.  My wife got the Surf's Up Veggie Scramble ($7.95). She couldn't finish it all due to the serving size.  Plus they have free WiFi which was nice so I can follow my Fantasy Football team on my iPod touch.",

The salad was huge but had a lot of romaine hearts which made it hard to eat so I picked apart the salad and what was left was amazing. The asian wrap was great and it came with fresh fruit which tasted delicious. The 2 smoothies, Wipe Out and Jamaican Me Crazy, were right on key! The coffee could have been fresher.

I'm also pretty sure the Tabasco and Tapatio on some of the tables were ancient, as evidenced by their off color. There was a dead fly on the bench where we were seated. There was dust all over the swimsuits hanging from the ceiling. Not sure the arcade or gum ball machines did anything for the ambience. As for the service, ours was fine - I appreciated the server's honesty when I asked if the hollandaise sauce was made in-house for the eggs Benedict and she truthfully told me it was not.

I've been here a couple of times and I can say that most everything on the menu is very well thought out and what I've ordered has had a great taste. Good portions and a decent price. Nothing to fancy or out of the norm here.  The last time I walked into the Beach Cafe 11-9-2011,  there were two couples at the tables and one person sitting at the counter. I counted five tables with dirty dishes or large food items, napkins, or empty drinks on them. Kind of limits where you can sit when the place only has about twelve or so tables.  After finding a clean table (and I'm not a neat freak or OCD in any way) I waited about five minutes for one of the girls to break away from laughing at the counter to come over and take my drink and burger order.  The Bacon cheese burger is outstanding, little heavy on the onions, but there's a gas station in front of the cafe if you need some breath mints later.  Never got a refill on my drink (wait staff was back to laughing at the counter).  While I was waiting, I looked around a bit and realized how dirty the inside of the place was, under the candy/gumball machines by the front door there are dead cockroaches, large dust balls and other assorted items. The tables that were dirty when I walked in still hadn't been cleared off and the wait staff were still at the counter laughing away.   Overall the food was good, the price was right, but I'm not risking my health going here again. If someone goes here and finds that the place has had a deep cleaning let me know I might check this place out again.",

I chose the sausage egg  in an English muffin with a side of bacon.  I ate as quickly as I could and then tried to pass out just as fast.  It worked!  Basically, it's a Denny's on Wheels!

They saw us sitting there but chose to ignore us for a long time.  It is very easy to simply look at someone in the eye and say \" I'll be with u in a minute\".  Here they would rather ignore you.  I tried ordering for pick up but the order took 35 minutes for breakfast.  Wow!  Never again.  I live minutes from there but still refuse to go there due to the horrible service",

Delivery estimates are usually an hour, though.   Ordered lunch two times and breakfast one time. I can't say I recommend any of the 2 smoothies I've had because they really taste so sweet it's like diabetes in a cup.   The smoothies: Wipe Out and Jamaican Me Crazy Smoothie. Super sweet. Not advised unless you're a sweets person.   Grilled chicken sandwich - portion is huge (for me, at least) but it was pretty good.   Mission Beach Fish Tacos - I wasn't disappointed with these. They were pretty good and definitely filling for me. Managed to even eat all 3 pieces since I don't typically eat a lot in one sitting.   Breakfast order today:   Since I'm a bit iffy about their smoothies, I ordered a Frozen Mocha (blended iced espresso, low-fat ice cream, and chocolate).

I've ordered from here three times, from uber eats; and both times within 45 minutes had debilitating stomach cramps and no doubt some form of food poisoning.. and was out for 24 stop.  This is so concerning and disturbing and this restaurant needs to take note from this.   What's strange is the foods taste isn't terrible. It's just the sick feeling you get after eating their food.

She also never came back to ask if we'd like refills on our drinks.  The eggs Benedict was really great as was the price for it & that's what the two stars are for.   Our check came right away, but took 20 minutes to be picked up by the waitress as she was socializing with other co-workers.

There was another girl who stayed posted behind the counter watching tv ... she must be the owner or something because she didn't do anything or interacted with any customers NOT sitting at the counter.  My boyfriend and I ordered eggs benedict and it took over 40 minutes to get our food.  Eggs benedict came with a very small serving of really greasy home fries (aka potatoes) ... it was nothing special.

The young one always has a waffle and side bacon but the other youngin had these breakfast sliders and mother had a breakfast croissant that she approves with crispy hash browns that were perfect..

    "text": "First time here just now having brunch with my 6 yo boy. The food was decent. Only thing is I may be wrong but the potatoes tasted...\"piggy\". I don't eat pork. So that was no bueno. I don't know if they cook everything together??? Not sure. Didn't like it. The eggs Benedict was decent. My son enjoyed his Swiss something burger. It was big. My only problem here is there was a blonde waitress working. She barely paid any attention to us that I had to go up to the counter 3 times during my 30-45  minutes dining there. The only things she said to us was \"I'll be right with you guys \" and she never came back. Finally a brown haired older woman who acted like the owner came by and asked if we had been helped. No. So she then proceeded to take our orders. She was excellent but by the end of our meal I was so irritated I couldn't help but tell her the truth. The other waitress took the couples check to them ( right beside us) all the while never looking our way. I also got up to ask for more napkins. The blonde girl overheard me ask and said she would bring them and so she did. Then the brown haired woman came and also brought more napkins. Thank you. I also approached the counter my way in because it was my first time. I wasn't greeted until I came to counter which the nice brown haired woman helped me. I felt maybe they could've directed me more promptly as to what to do because I thought it was like a tropical smoothie cafe. Finally, the third time I had to get up was because when we were done with our meals we needed a to-go box. My son couldn't finish his meal. And we needed our check. While everyone else is being handed their checks I was the only one who had to go up to the counter yet again ( third time) to ask for some customer service. My check came out to about $24. Decent price. I tipped $5 which I only gave because the owner was so kind and I could tell she was doing her best. Perhaps her fellow teammates should follow. I most likely will not return.",

Everything from pancakes and omelets to soup (corn chowder was yummy) sandwiches, salads and yummy desserts!!!! I got delivery and was hoping to make a half decent healthy decision so I got a bowl of the chowder and the chicken salad with avocados. Soup came hot. Salad came cold. Yum! Oh and their tropical tea is yummy too. So 3 items with a Delia we charge was 17.00$ pretty great. Will be ordering again soon!!",

    "text": "Beware.... The poor reviews for this place mainly come from the shotty customer service and so far they are living up to expectations... I've lived close to this restaurant for a few years now and have yet to try it due to the reviews but decided to go for it this morning.   I was searching on yelp for some delivery and this place popped up. Yelp offered the option to place the order on my iPhone app so I went ahead and ordered. I was able to place the order very easily and it have me a window of about 45min to an hour which I was fine with. Since this place is right around the corner from me I did follow up after an hour had passed just to check on the status. I was less concerned with the time and just wanted to make sure the order went through since I haven't ordered on my yelp app yet.   I was greeted by a women on the other line who must have been having a bad day. I don't even think I was greeted with a hi or hello... Just beach cafe. I informed the women I ordered on yelp and wanted to see if everything went through, and when I could expect it. She began to tell me I couldn't have done that because they don't offer it... Well if your reading this review you well know there is an option for placing an order. I politely told her there was an option and I ordered a few items and have already been charged for it. She continued to tell me I was wrong in a rude tone and then asked where I lived to which she mentioned someone just left to deliver it. I thanked her for checking and also told her she should take a look on yelp to see the option offered since it got them business.   When the delivery guy came I showed him the yelp app with the delivery option and informed him of my experience with the women on the phone. He apologized and the only thing I do feel bad about is I wish I would have given him a bigger tip than what I left originally but the women really bothered me with her rude/condescending tone. You would think after so many similar poor reviews these people might make an effort to change their ways.   Overall the good was good and I would like to give this place another shot and re-review at a later date to see if maybe I just caught this place on a bad day....",

    "text": "We got here about 7:30, they had been open a half hour and we were their first customer. Even then, it took the waitress 10 minutes to get to our table. The place is small, she was working at the counter about 10 feet away, so she couldn't miss us, but it looked like her \"mornng routine\" was not to be interupted, so we waited.  We ordered right away, I had eggs benedict and the kids had pancakes. It took about 15 minutes for the food to come out.  The food wasn't bad, wasn't great, either.  Nothing at all remarkable.   The reason I'm giving 2 stars is because of the service. The waitress was not friendly, she didn't come back to our table at all after she brought our food. We waited 15 minutes after we were done eating for our check, I finally asked my grandson to go ask the waitress for it (at this point, its 8:15 and we're still the only diners). He stood at the counter and she ignored him, finally looking at me like \"what does he want\"? I told her we needed our check. When I went to pay, the woman at the register was talking to a guy at the counter who had just come in. They chatted for a few moments about his new apartment and she finally walked over to ring me up.  As she was doing that, the phone rang, she answered it, and then stopped checking me out to take a phone order, as I stood there. and waited. and waited. and waited.  I was finally rung up and we were out of there by 8:30.  Its pretty obvious this place makes their breakfast business on takeout orders. Walk in customers are secondary.  The food wasn't bad, and if it weren't for the service, I'd consider going back, but I'm not spending my money for mediocore food when the service is so lousy.",

I like that feeling of knowing the owners and knowing it's family run. Very laid back and cool - SoCal. But that laid back also goes for the service which is a bit slow. I guess it matches the vibe there - laid back.   But don't be fooled! The food speaks for itself and it is loaded with flavor. Everything I have tried is delicious - French toast to Cobb salad - which was great! There was tons of goodies on that thing.  I've had chicken tenders for kids - can't mess those up! Like I said I really enjoy it here and can put up with the slow service for the good prices and great food.",

We rode our bikes since its not too far, enjoyed some yummy breakfast then worked off the calories on our bike ride home. Calories sooooo worth it.

I ordered the \"big island scramble\" for $8.95.  I found the potatoes good, but the egg scramble tasted very bland.  Even the english muffin was bland.  The cook puts these itsy bitsy pieces of bacon, ham and sausage in the scramble.  You might need a magnifying glass to find them.  Even the cheese was cheap.  No taste.  The waitress twice asked if I liked it, but I think she could tell by my face that I didn't.  I told her my scramble needed some pineapple chunks to spruce it up.  She offered a \"side\" of pineapple... for extra money of course!  I declined.  I don't mind spending $10 for breakfast when it is good.  This breakfast was not good.  Plus it took at least 15 minutes to get my meal.  Much too long!   The pleasant waitress brought me the water I asked for.  But it wasn't until I was ready for the check did she offer a refill.  Moreover, the lemon wedges for the water were tart and sour.  Maybe the sandwiches at beach cafe are better?  Doubt that I will return to find out!",

Upon my arrival to pick up my order which was put under my email address not my name, the cashier (an older white woman) decided it would be funny to say my \"name\" sounded like a stripper name! Now, this was loud enough that other employees LAUGHED, and the restaurant had 3 tables full of people there for lunch. Talk about embarrassing. When I said well that's me actually, she just goes \"oh sorry\" in the most unapologetic way. She made fun of my name even more before even saying that. That was embarrassing, rude, degrading and honestly so wrong. This is Las Vegas, exotic dancers are common here and make a living and it is so wrong to literally make fun of them to a costumer, so far as to saying that costumers name sounds like a stripper. So insulting so degrading so ignorant! Because of this I will not be ordering from beach cafe again unless I receive a proper apology. That was so embarrassing and RUDE! She made fun of my name for about a minute pronouncing it funny and then laid on the sounds like a stripper name when everyone but me laughed. I've never seen such ignorance from a place I thought was full of amazing employees, this was my first time seeing this woman there and I hope it's the last. Jealousy and ignorance make older women completely rude!! Hire better people!! This was about 12:45p today Dec 10.",

    "text": "It was 10 AM. And just less than a mile away from my home, Beach Cafe has truly hit me both its food and its scene. As soon as I walked in, not only I was welcomed, but I was hit full-on of nostalgia. As a former islander of 12 years from Hawaii, I was longing to find a new eatery, scenery, and grinds that will not only satisfy my longing stay in Vegas but at least make me feel welcomed as a new local. And, to my surprise, my new home has never felt so close when I first entered Beach Cafe.   As soon as I sat, I looked into their menu right away. Ranging from scrambled eggs, south-of-the-border breakfasts, to benedicts and burgers, to pancakes, french toast, and waffles as well. But of course, I just had to take a look and feel the scenery, too. The vibe was great. The morning atmosphere truly does help represent the scene of a beach. But next is the food.   My first order of course: coffee.   It was fresh, no fancy gimmick, just classic. The overall result: sublime.   Now, straight into the entree: The Surf's Up Veggie Scramble. The eggs were fresh, smooth to chew along with yummy peppers blended with cheese, tomatoes, onions, mushrooms, all sauteed well within the eggs. The bread was perfectly toasted, the diced potatoes were cooked very well to the point that it's not hard but not too smooth to chew (Yes, I'm anal like that). The overall result: Seconds, please. I beg of you.   Overall, the place was fantastic. I could stay there and have a relaxing read, or just stop by for a quick breakfast or brunch. They do delivery as well. But, just knowing the fact that this wonderful place is close by?  Well, let's just say, that I truly and finally feel at home.   Now, if you'll excuse me, I must get back as I am starving for what they have in store.  P.S If you're jonesing for some desserts afterwards? I beg of you, try the Copa Banana. No regrets.  -AC",

I have ordered from here about 10 times using amazon delivery and most the time the food is decent. Amazon service is good but the food prep was lacking sometimes.   Fruit was small, didn't seem very fresh, and gave a lot of hard pieces of melon. They should use something to wrap the breakfast sandwich to hold the stuff in place because sometimes the cheese is only covering half and stuff was falling out.  The other thing is they send advertising for grubhub when I ordered on amazon. Showing total disrespect to the company that brought you the 10+ orders I've gave you just shows again the disrespect they have for others.   I wanted to give at least a 4 but I know my concerns will go ignored like the other reviewers.   Step it up Beach.",

Beach Cafe definitely has the best Corn Chowder I have ever had. It is so creamy, with big chunks of chicken, sausage, peppers, corn.   They also have an amazing Southwest Chicken Salad, served with a tortilla on the bottom.   I have ordered several items off their menu, and shockingly for me they have the best frappachino's too! They are made with ICE CREAM = yum, especially on these hot Vegas days.   I would highly recommend going there at least once. I have never eaten in the restaurant I always order the food to go, and they have offer free delivery service which is very convenient.   There service is a little slow, it usually takes me about an hour to get my food, so I always order it prior to my lunch. I have never had any problems with the staff as far as customer service, but honestly the Corn Chowder is amazing that I will wait any day for it.",

At first it seemed like a pretty laid back environment until we sat down and actually looked around. First of all they have the most uncomfortable chairs in town, and the seating was just crappy, they need to upgrade their tables and chairs desperately. The decor was awful, they have old bathing suits stapled to the ceiling and everywhere you look. It was overkill.   Then we waited for our friend for a while. It took a long time to get refills on waters, our friend ordered a water and didn't even get it until our food finally came, which took quite some time, and the waitress was behind the counter texting half the time.   The food, once again, took a while to come out. I ordered the grilled monterey chicken which was soaked in grease. I was expecting something somewhat healthy, but this was just nasty. I felt awful afterwards. My boyfriend go the Frisco burger, which was ok, but once again, greasy as hell. Our friend ordered fish tacos, which were mediocre and served with a lemon instead of a lime? Kind of odd. We did get a smoothie which was good... But it was almost $5, kind of expensive for how much we got. Better off going to Tropical Smoothie.   Needless to say, this place was mediocre at best. Maybe it was just a bad experience? Their menu was intriguing and I was excited, but after I left I had a stomach ache due to the greaseball that I was only able to eat half of. Sadly, it wasn't even flavorful, it was really bland. SUCKS! Don't go out of your way.",

Well, even with the sign just a block away pointing to the shop, it was blocked by another building that made it difficult to spot, going south on Jones blvd.  Disappointing orders:  Eggs Benedict: A pretty straightforward dish that consists of english muffin, layered with a slice of canadian bacon/ham, poached egg and the most important - hollandiase sauce. What would make or break the dish would certainly be the hollandaise sauce. Well, from experience with more than a handful of different versions of \"eggs benedict\" dishes I've had in the past, their sauce wasn't great or even good in my opinion. The home fried potatoes weren't any better..  Ortega Burger: Came with chili, grilled onions, pepper jack cheese and jalapeno mayonnaise. I didn't think I could've gone wrong with this one but it wasn't nearly as satisfying as the description. The meat was on the dry side, the chili was blah and I didn't notice anything special with their jalapeno mayo spread. Fries were fine, better than anything else offered this morning. I'd rather have Carl's Jr's.  \"Santa Fe\" Chicken sandwich over this any day.  Service was great, prices weren't good for quality nor quantity, decor was island casual and food was lacking in all aspects",

I've eaten here with friends, family and alone and have always gotten the same great service. The hamburgers are great if you want to gorge yourself, they're big and come with lots of fries! Crinkle fries by the way, and they're legit. I love the Cali beach theme menu items, the fish tacos are great and fresh and the salads are big and crunchy. Lots of wraps to choose from, the Thai one is really tasty. The smoothies weren't my fave, a little heavy on ice, but I guess it depends on how you like your smoothie. I prefer more fruit and yogurt.  The decor is really cute too, bathing suits hanging everywhere. They take the beach theme seriously. Overall a great lunch spot if you're in the area!",

    "text": "I came here because it is just down the street from the new house and my husband and I were craving breakfast, and we were debating whether to try this or go to one of the \"egg\" restaurants that my husband likes, but I am not really crazy about because of the disgusting, harsh seasoning they put on everything.  We were extremely pleased to find someplace that we didn't have to wait forever, but we weren't expecting much as far as both service and food.  I ordered a chicken apple sausage scramble, and they were insanely accommodating when I asked if they could substitute egg whites and add lots of spinach.  They were more than happy to.  I also had an iced tea, tropical flavor, and I wasn't sure if I was going to like it so they brought me a free sample without charging me.  Husband had a blueberry banana smoothie (it was excellent and low fat to boot, and I absolutely hate smoothies), and a big island scramble which essentially had tons of breakfast meat and cheese.  The dishes came out quickly, and they had probably the best home fries I have ever had.  They were huge chunks of red potato, that were crisp on the outside and soft and velvety on the inside, just like I love potatoes.  And perfectly seasoned.  This is how potatoes should be folks, not that petrified over seasoned crap from the egg works, egg and I, and that other crap.  I'd eat these every day, seriously.   Everything else was delicious, and both my husband and I decided at that moment that this was the best breakfast we've had in town, and lucky us, it was just down the street.  And they DELIVER.   If you've seriously thought this place wasn't great before, give it another try.  I'd give this place a million stars if I could.  I love you Beach Cafe, and if I wasn't married I'd have lots of your babies!",

I'm hopelessly addicted to the turkey grill sandwich, and have to force myself to get something else now and then.  The salads were about the only thing I've had that weren't very interesting.  It may be beach-style food, but there is nothing lightweight or bikini-body-ready about the food (which is what makes it so tasty)!  The turkey grill is well-buttered grilled toast, mayo, cheese, avocado, bacon, and turkey, with fries on the side. Yum!  They also have the added advantage of delivery service, and they know our office well.  So when I am hopelessly chained to my cubicle, I can still get my sandwich and a smoothie to thoroughly stuff myself for the afternoon.  Delivery can run slow sometimes, but I've never had any problems with it eventually getting here and being fresh.",

    "text": "This was my first time ordering from Beach Cafe and it was great!  I ordered the Mission Beach Fish Tacos and Tropical iced tea online. The online form was very user-friendly.  It was a little difficult to find at first, but that wasn't a problem.  My order was not ready when I arrived so I was able to sit down and observe the little restaurant. I talked to one of the owners and she told me that they were modeled after a place on the beach in So Cal. I had also mentioned that my husband liked Eggs Benedict and that I would be coming back with him and she suggest the Cali Bene and that once a month they have a lobster Bene for a week.  When my order came out it smelled delicious! The iced tea was pretty standard but the tacos were breaded pollock with cabbage and sour cream on corn tortillas and salsa on the side.  The fish was very fresh and the breading did not overpower the light flavor of the fish. Everything was fresh and yummy. I will be returning to this cafe more often.",

    "text": "HOW in the world is this place still open?   Never have I experienced such an awkward and uncomfortable dining experience. The rudeness and lack of customer service that was grossly displayed by the waitstaff left me with a taste in my mouth so sour that I had to write a review and warn others.   I've tried Beach Cafe a total of three times. The first time, service was bad and the food wasn't much better. Second time, I walked in to get take out....and twenty five minutes later my sandwich was prepared. I, stupidly, decided to give this place ONE more chance (a year later) because of the close location to both my home and my work.   My colleague and I walked in to a COMPLETELY EMPTY restaurant where we waited for a server to come to our table for SIX MINUTES. Six minutes of us awkwardly waiting in the middle of an empty dining area while the four workers, including who I assume is the manager, all talking, laughing, and gossiping along with staring at us but never making any acknowledgement towards our presence. I have managed several successful hotel and restaurant chains for over twenty years, so I understand that while customer service always comes first, with high volume and overcapacity issues, sometimes it takes a little while to get to everyone.  I have had instances where everyone of my tables was filled with people waiting around the block, and every single one of my servers made sure everyone was greeted promptly and taken care of.   WHAT IN THE WORLD is the excuse for such behavior when there is no other customers in the place?   I was truly baffled.   Finally, I politely walked up and asked \"I'm sorry, do we order at the front\" to which a heavy set lady rudely responded \"uh, someone will come to you\"  Alright, here we go. Finally a young lady walked over to the table and said \"what are you getting?\"   That was her exact words.   I need to remind you all that she was doing absolutely nothing but gossiping with the others while we waited to even order a drink.   We ended up walking out absolutely disgusted by the lack of customer service.   This place should be shut down and the manager running this establishment should be ashamed of herself.  I would love to contact whoever the manager is personally and explain it to them, but from the sounds of the reviews, I think I know who the manager is they're describing and considering she was one of the \"waitstaff\" that was rudely staring at us instead of being a server, I don't think the conversation would get too far.",

    "text": "I have ordered online from Beach Cafe many times over the past several months. Usually like to order food on the days I am getting homework done because I am strapped to the computer. I change my order up and rarely have food issues. I have had biscuits and gravy, croissant breakfast sandwich, Turkey sandwich (avocado, mayo, tomato), the rueban, and more...and all were delicious.   I added a bagel to my order the other day (like I have many times before), and it was dry and tasted like cardboard. First time I was disappointed with the bagel. Occasionally the potatoes will get to my house and be less than average, but I understand they deliver it so I cut them slack.   My two favorite drinks are the frozen coffee (not Carmel or white chocolate) and the tropical iced tea. The Carmel and white chocolate frozen coffee drinks have a gritty texture that is not the sugar, but is sweet (like a powdered flavoring). It's strange. I get the regular frozen coffee and it is perfect. The tropical iced tea is incredibly refreshing. I recommend this place. However, do not be in a hurry. Delivery usually takes 45-60 min. It's fine with me because I do not mind waiting for the greatness at Beach Cafe. Someday I may even go to the shop just to check it out. For now, it's my homework/study break treat delivered to my door.",

The specialty drinks are pretty good too. You really can't go wrong on the menu.   The Service: Absolutely horrible. We order food from them a few times a week so we give them pretty good business. We always tip their drivers out nicely too. Be aware you are going to wait at least an hour-hour 30mins for delivery. The dine-in service always was bad, drinks never refilled in time, the girl would forget things. Not to mention the seating is the most uncomfortable ever. So after 3-4 trips we refrain from visiting here for Dine-in.   They have forgotten stuff on delivery several times, and when you call they get all defensive about it, second guess you, call you a liar and they definitely don't apologize for their mistakes and on top of it, they don't try to make it up to you. In our business if we don't keep our customers happy, they leave and go somewhere else. I think we really need start looking for someone else to service our breakfast/lunch needs in the area.",

    "text": "Beach Cafe, what can I say (haha that rhymed). I have always been weary of trying new places, I mean I love doing it but at the same time you're always scared it's a miss. But considering it was in walking distance and I was in Vegas this is the place to try new places. Me and my friend walked to here and from the get go it's a nice little cafe. Plenty of seating, and everyone is pretty friendly. There menu is nice, I mean I wish they were in Cali where the beaches are. It makes me kind of sad cause honestly it beats out the one breakfast/lunch place we have here. But at least it gives me somewhere to look forward too when I come back. Me and my friend ended up coming six days out of the seven days we were here. I ended up mainly getting the cafe breakfast with a bagel and bacon. And their iced coffee. I'll admit the first few times it was kind of watered down, but it did its job and it's free refills. Their sun kissed iced tea is yummy and sweet too. I did have their bbq bacon cheeseburger and fries and they were good too. I mean I wish I had tried more variety but I'm kind of a plain jane kind of guy. The cafe breakfast ended up being my go to, and I'm not a huge breakfast person. They also have specials here and there. They had a captain crunch French toast that was to die for . The prices were fair, I usually ended up paying about 10 for my food and drink. On top of it if you're the type to frequent this place. Ask for a meal card you get a free meal after about I believe 10 or 12 meals. But hey, free food is always good.",

The outside of the place is understated.  It's part of a shopping center-style area in an unfamiliar part of town for me, but I wanted to see what their breakfast was about.  You'll have to drive into the lot to see where the place is (behind the gas station).  Inside, the beach decor is also understated (but nice), and while there was some wait associated with my order at times as some reviews stated, the service on my day was very friendly and conversational.  I wasn't in a rush, so I enjoyed the extra time.  A fellow needs time to wake up on a lazy Sunday morning.  I ordered the chili cheese scramble.  Honestly, a meal of this magnitude could go either way, but it was excellent.  The chili they used for it in particular was pretty darn tasty, and the meal wasn't greasy.  I thoroughly enjoyed the entree, the side potatoes, and the toast that went with it.  I was actually sorry to have seen the meal ended.  I kept picking at the remnants of the sauce until they took my plate away.  The server was a very nice girl.  Very warm and personable.  And beverage refills came pretty regularly.  At the end of the meal, breakfast for two was just at $20.  For the amount of food and the taste, I really couldn't disagree with anything.  I will definitely come back.  It's a bit of a drive for me, but it was a great breakfast.",

I would recommend to order the brown gravy on the side. The nutella stuffed french toast was amazing. There was just the perfect amount of cinnamon.  The menu is a bit overwhelming, but everything we had was tasteful.  Melissa was really friendly and was really welcoming. We ordered everything she recommended. Don't forget to ask for a punch card. Your eleventh meal is free!",

Everything was fresh and had excellent flavor.    It would be nice if they added a green smoothie to their smoothie menu (e.g., spinach and pineapple/mango).  They have a lot of business from take-out and delivery.  However, I enjoy the decor which has a well executed beach theme.",

I ordered from here via Uber Eats because I had a busy work-from-home morning, and it was first on the list. I ordered the California Benedict and the French Toast. The latter was solid. The former, however, had one completely overcooked egg (including a photo) AND one poached (still a bit overcooked) but with eggshell!  Now, I wasn't planning on posting at that point. Just wanted to call the restaurant and let them know about their mistake so they won't do it to someone else.   Made the call, put on hold because busy. No problem. Told hostess who picked up who then got the manager. I tell her what I just told ya'll: overcooked eggs, eggshell.   Manager (in dismissive tone): \"We don't give refunds, go back to Uber Eats\" Me: \"Um, that's not even why I'm calling. I just want to let you know so it doesn't happen again. Maybe let the cook know?\" Manager: \"...\"  That was it!  No taking of responsibility, no \"I'm so sorry!\" No \"What can we do for you?\" No offering of an action to take to do better next time.   THAT is when I decided to write this. That kind of attitude is not conducive whatsoever. Mistakes happen. I can forgive that. Being dismissive when you are caught in a mistake in managing a business like this is problematic.   Never again. Do better, please.",

I never had the greatest service here before and this time was the absolute worse.  It seems like they don't know how to prioritize customers and instead favoritize them.   I get that it's a \"beach cafe\" but don't take the full beach mood to the max.  They seemed very laxed when it came to serving people and answering the phone.  They said they'll bring the condiments over but completely forget and never refilled our drinks.  I suggest go at your own risk if you want mediocre food and no service.",

A buddy of mine and i shared an order of Sliders with Waffle Fries aka Crisscut Fries and a Grilled Chicken Sammich with a side of a fruit bowl.  I was given the impression that this was supposed to be a healthier alternative than most eatery given they served wraps, salads, smoothies, and stuff.  So I was quite let down when i held the CK sandwich and my fingers were all greasy and oily.  Wish they would slice up their grilled chicken too because that first bite took out one of the two piece of CK i had in the sandwich.  It's loaded with Mayo, Avocado, lettuce, and tomato. The sliders came in 4 but it was pretty small and dainty.  Forgot if it had caramelized onions, but it at least had some sort of cheese. The Waffle Fries are good but who doesn't like Waffle Fries?    Service was standard, and i hear they have good brownies.  But then again it's from my friend that raved enough about it to take me here. Soooo.. I need a second opinion before I ever come back.  Maybe I'm being harsh but my experienced was almost like eating at an EDR rather than spending money on food I want to eat.  It gets the job done.",

We order the chicken fingers which were crunchy and juicy (the side of housemade ranch was perfect). The burger was cooked well and the toppings on it were fresh. We ordered their chili cheese fries and they were, by far, the best chili cheese fries ever, hands down. My only gripe is that the menu didn't specify that fries came with the burger and chicken fingers so we got a lot of fries and the majority of them went to waste.   From the other reviews, I don't think I'd ever dine in just so my experience with this restaurant isn't ruined. I'd order delivery again though.",

It comes with home fries and the were okay, a little too greasy for my taste, not something I will be getting in the future. They forgot to give my toast which is funny because they gave me plenty of jam. I also order the twisted lemonade and wasn't great, it tasted pretty watered down I'm not sure if that is the regular taste or maybe the ice melted while it was being delivered. They were priced pretty well and the delivery was fast, I will be using them in the future.",

    "text": "Perhaps the best way to describe this place is consistent... consistently BAD. I have been in the somewhat unique, albeit unenviable, position to have sampled a large variety of their lunch items. From their fish tacos to burgers to various chicken and deli sandwiches, corn chowder, and smoothies, I have yet to discover something that is at least half-decent.  Perhaps, more specifics are in order. The fried fish had a cold, thick, and dried-out texture of cardboard. The greasy burgers were overcooked and had a soggy bun. The chicken is dry, lacking in flavor, and smothered with oily cheese. The corn chowder is a nasty gelatinous goo. The smoothies are extremely sweet and not as thick as they ought to be. You get the idea...    Why would I continue to subject myself to such awful food? One of the facilities, where I work, will order lunch for us from various places if we are working through the lunch hour. I'm not completely sure who is responsible for picking the place each time, but there must be some kind of kickbacks taking place because I cannot fathom why they seem to keep picking this place over a vastly superior alternative like Tropical Smoothie Cafe.  One time, when they asked me what I wanted to order, I told them that I would pass. However, this woman felt really bad and insisted on suggesting something that I would like. I ended up ordering some sort of chicken sandwich which was, surprise surprise, terrible. The most recent time they ordered from here, to avoid hurting anyone's feelings, I just ordered some random sandwich. I took it with me when I left the facility but dumped it in the nearest trash bin. I felt bad wasting \"food\" and for a moment thought that maybe I should give it to some homeless person. Then again, if I had, they might think that I was trying to poison them.",

After placing our order, we received notification that it would be 75 minutes instead. It arrived almost 90 minutes after we placed our order. My sandwich came slightly warm and with wax paper melted into it. It was supposed to be on a ciabatta bread and it came on a plain roll. My husband's order had avocado in it and it wound up being one small piece for the whole sandwich. The fruit cups we selected with our orders had a total of 6 chunks of fruit each, 3 cantaloupe and 3 pineapple. The fries we ordered on the side were cold and soggy. Very disappointed. I would not recommend.",

That's fine I understand that...I called back and they were still busy. ( I gave them my number and she never called me back). I paid over 45 dollars worth of food. It was sub par at best. When the manager never called me back I decided to write this review. If you truly care about your customers not only their well being for food safety violations... You must not care for your customers at all. I really think this restaurant needs to reevaluate a few things, before someone gets really sick and reports you for food code violations. The Turkey burger I had was a cold gelatinous hockey puck with old onions and drenched in their \"secret sauce\" (thousand island dressing). I know what a fresh onion tastes like... This onion was flimsy like it sat out for DAYS. My fries were ok. That's all I ended up eating. Last chance for the Manager to redeem herself... However I still don't expect a response. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.",

Nestled inside of one of Las Vegas's notorious strip malls right between a gas station and bar, this nifty little eatery was a decent find.  The service standards in this town have declined so poorly that most dining experiences are a let down when it comes to great customer service. With that being said, the service at Beach Cafe was just that: mediocre.  The name of the restaurant, Beach Cafe, is exactly what it is: an island themed eatery complete with bathing suits hanging from the ceiling.   Our very friendly waitress (insert sarcasm here) took our orders and shortly thereafter our food and beverages arrived.  My eggs, potato's and pancakes were delicious, and the orange juice and coffee weren't bad either.  But if you're super thirsty you might be waiting a while for a refill, if you are even asked if you'd like a refill at all.   I love the idea of supporting local businesses so I would most certainly eat at Beach Cafe again should I end up in that area.  Though the service was not spectacular (the norm for most establishments these days), it's fine eats for breakfast!",

I was expecting a really awesome meal considering they have some nice reviews and they have quite a variety except for only having 2 omelette options but nevertheless it sounded like it was a good place.   I ordered the Big Island scramble with no sausage but added spinach and avocado. It came with potatoes and toast which because I do keto, I don't eat them but I try them just so I can review it then give them to my husband or kids. The potatoes were seasoned well and tasted good too. The Big Island Scrabble was very filling and with a little hot sauce wasn't too bad.   Now, let's talk about their deluxe grilled cheese with bacon, tomato and mayo. One word, AWFUL. There's so much wrong with it but let's start with where's the bacon? I know! It's underneath all those tomato slices and tubs of mayo. There was such little cheese that in order to chew it, you'd think someone was eating a steak. My husband did not like it at all and the fries are literally bagged fries that are soggy and have no taste. No salt.   The breakfast burrito looked good but it wasn't for me so I haven't received their feedback as of right now but overall, I would never return back here.",

We were the only customers in the restaurant as it was 9 am on a Wednesday morning. Our order was taken after the waitress and owner finished their conversation across the room while we waited. Food came quickly. Unfortunately my Eggs Benedict was mediocre at best. The descriptive word that keeps popping into my head is Generic. Sauce was missing that hint of acidic bite and was just blah. I did order a side of avocado and did get a nice whole half. My sister had ordered the same and expressed her disappointment too. She ordered a side of bacon which came out undercooked and when we told her about it, she came back clearly with the same pieces that seemed to have been quickly microwaved and completely inedible. My niece ordered the kids half waffle with strawberries and a side of bacon. Hers was crisp. No complaints from the 4 yr old. It is a quiet, quaint and clean place to eat. Do I get the impression everything isn't tasty... no. It is clear that they staff care about their business. We did not complain, asked for a to go box and left but honestly feel like they would have tried hard to do whatever necessary to please us. They did offer us to go sodas. Nice touch. I will give them another try. Maybe it was just an off day. It happens. Atmosphere and friendly will be the reason to try again to give them a glowing review.",

Sat down at a table and realized the waitress was behind the counter chowing down and chatting with another man at the bar. Took some time but She did come over took our drink orders. Two of us both ordered the white chocolate mocha which was very good. Food ordered was chili scramble and sourdough breakfast sandwich. The food here is good, sides of potatoes came with both dishes are awesome. Employees not so much. One talked on her phone at a table for pretty much the whole time we were here and the other was pretty unattentive. I guess the fact we were the only people in the entire place at 9:30am should have been the first sign. Oh also not to mention there was a table that had used plates on it that never got cleared the entire hour we were.   Long story short: only order to go.",

    "text": "We actually found The Beach Cafe right here on Yelp. We love trying new places in the neighborhood and with great reviews already we knew that we had to make this a destination.   My wife and I are breakfast people. In fact, though I don't eat much we would often get two entrees when it comes to breakfast so we can try a couple options before raking the rest home in a to-go container.  We kept my simple though. She ordered French Toast with a side of bacon and I had the breakfast croissant which featured eggs, cheese, and bacon and served alongside a choice of breakfast potatoes or hash browns. I had the hash browns.   The food quality was really good. The croissant was flaky and the overall plate was filling. The French Toast was great even without adding syrup to them, so when we poured a little on top anyway it was like a bonus. The Caramel Macchiato my wife had was pretty epic as well.  Pricing was nice and affordable and the guest service was outstanding. Our server maintained a warm smile and was very knowledgeable about the food choices.   I loved the decor in the shop. Made me think about how much I enjoyed my time on the beaches of Waikiki, even if it was just for breakfast. We'll definitely be taking a breakfast vacation with the Beach Cafe again soon.",

I absolutely love the decor, especially the swimsuits dangling from the ceiling!  I had not been in for a while, since I am now plant based, but my friend was craving turkey bacon. I remembered that Beach Cafe has turkey bacon so I suggested we come here.   We were greeted as soon as we walked in, and received amazing customer service throughout our meal. My friend ordered an omelet with a side of turkey bacon, and she loved every last bite. There isn't really anything vegan on the menu, so I asked the server if I could get the Veggie Scramble with hash browns instead of eggs and no cheese. I was almost expect a look of confusion or annoyance, but instead got a \"sure thing!\" This made me very pleased, but I was even more impressed when my meal turned out to be super delicious. Best believe, I ate every last bit of my veggie hash brown amazingness! I promise I will be back more often now that I know there are some veg options.",

I even called and asked if it was ok to bring her in for a little bit! Lady, you're an embarrassment to the industry and you all shouldn't even be working at a call center. There were customers all around too! What the hell? I've been a customer for a while and I always tip but that dollar I tipped you is the last you should get pretty much ever.   The cooks are great at this place and their sandwiches are on point. Especially the Reuben or just their regular burger. Hire better staff or look into automated service because your FOH just lost you this customer. I am severely disappointed to say the least.",

And this place has THE BEST I've ever tasted! The English muffin was crispy on the edges and soft in the middle. They use a lot of lobster and not just a small lump like other places. The hollandaise sauce was seasoned right. Some places leave it bland. And the eggs were the perfect consistency. The flavors just popped. And those potatoes??? Oh my! They fry that up in some flavored oil or something lol! I usually keep away from potatoes but I ate everything! They ruined lobster Benedict for me now. I can only go here for my fix!",

He takes me to this super chill, unassuming little beachy diner for lunch and yes, it did have all the beach trimmings, even the boards and suits hanging all around.   The menu was a step up from your typical diner fare though. There were sammies, plates, salad and a board with specials. Since it was brunch time and once I saw the main special, I knew I had to have it - the tamale omelette! You know i posted a pic of that bad boy too. So basically it was a chicken tamale chopped up in the omelette then covered in pepper jack. My friend got one of their sammies, but i didn't even pay much attention since mine was so damn tasty.   The prices were quite reasonable too, especially since I'd been on the strip for about three days at this point. It was quite nice to get out into the area and try a little hidden gem like the Beach Cafe.",

    "text": "Back in the summer of 2010, my father-in-law suggested this place. He had read somewhere that Beach Cafe was one of the \"best places to eat breakfast in Las Vegas.\" Ever since that first visit, we have become regulars who dine here at least once a month. When my husband and I lived in California, this would be our first stop after that 3-4 hour drive from Cali to Vegas. We used to drive in really early in the morning, so this place was perfect because it opened at 7am!  I like the laid-back beach theme of the restaurant, with swimsuits hanging from the ceiling and surfboards on the walls. I was born and raised in Hawaii, so it really feels like home! It also makes you feel like you are enjoying a relaxing day at the beach!   The food is pretty good. I'm not really a breakfast person, but I do like the Ed's Biscuits and Gravy. The sausage gravy is just right, not too sweet and not too salty. My only complaint is that the 4 biscuits they give you are kind of small. I just tried the South Shore Sliders the other day, and they were great! The perfect size with the right amount of French Fries and they are served on those yummy Hawaiian Sweet Rolls! My favorite thing on the menu is the Lava Flow Smoothie, which is a sweet mix of strawberries, bananas, coconut, and vanilla ice cream. Very delicious!   Robyn always helps us. She is very nice and friendly! The other employees are great as well. If you sign up for their emails, they will send you coupons and let you know what their weekly specials are.   Don't forget to ask for a stamp card. Buy 10 meals, get 1 free!",

    "text": "A neighborhood cafe serving up breakfast and lunch fare in a laid back beach-like atmosphere.  Sure, they have swimsuits hanging from the ceiling and a tiki theme going on.    Walking in, the waitress told us to sit wherever we wanted.  Using our Entertainment Book coupons, we thought we were restricted to the Breakfast menu only.  But the waitress was nice enough to let us use it for anything on the menu, which we definitely appreciated!  I chose the Del Mar Melt ($7.95), which consists of their homemade tuna salad with melted Swiss cheese and tomato on perfectly grilled sourdough bread.  Their tuna salad has crunchy bits of celery and was to my liking.  French fries also came with my order.  The Husband saw their Specials board, which meant he was getting the Chicken Fried Steak Sandwich ($8.75).  For those who crave a chicken fried steak but it's too late in the day, putting it between two pieces of bread easily does the trick.  The sandwich had lettuce, tomato, and mayo, with their homemade gravy on the side. French fries also came with his order.  I didn't see any complaints coming from him as he ate it all up!   We also had a BOGO free smoothie, so we took ours to go.  My choice was their Sunburn smoothie ($4.50/16 oz; $5.25/24 oz) which consists of passion fruit, mango, peach, strawberry juice, and crushed ice.  It was a super sweet smoothie, which had me wondering how much sugar was in it.  The Husband had their Tropical Passion smoothie ($4.50/16 oz; $5.25/24 oz) which had guava, passion fruit, and mango blended with crushed ice.  He said it tasted like baby food, which was a good thing.  We went on a Tuesday and they had a steady stream of customers - those taking a leisurely solo lunch break or colleagues gathered together to enjoy their tropical iced tea.  It looked like there was one waitress and she was busy the whole time we were there.  I did have to ask for refills on my water, but only because she was constantly moving around.   Overall, Beach Cafe served up a decent lunch.  I don't know if we would be inclined to go back without a coupon though.",

Have my favorite big island scramble with massive fresh home fries. I suggest getting a side of the out of this world blueberry pancakes. The are fluffy and packed with blueberry and the flavor actually reminds me of birthday cake. Thumbs up beach cafe, thank you for feeding me on my way to a 14 hours shift!!  Unfortunately since my last review the food quality has gone a little downhill. On my last visit , my wife and I came in for our favorites a stack of blueberry pancakes and my island scramble and for her the Hawaiian burger with grilled pineapple and teriyaki sauce. This time around my scamble was missing the flavors that I became accustomed to. It was pretty bland so I skipped ahead to my favorite pancakes. I was very upset when my light fluffy delicious cakes ended up being wayyyyy too sweet and were crunchy. As for my wife's burger , it was over cooked the pineapple was soggy and they forgot the teriyaki sauce. As they did bring her a side of sauce, it ended up being extremely salty. I have never tasted a teriyaki sauce so salty and yet so thin. It ran and tasted more like a soy sauce with a sugar packet dropped in it. I want to give it another chance , but paying $40 for two meals that were hardly edible. Not going to happen anytime soon.",

You can keep your trendy eggworks and all those overrated places, I'll take Beach Cafe any day of the week.  The food is always delicious and fresh.  I suggest the breakfast scrambles or sandwiches.  Weekly specials are innovative and I haven't found any other place that serves Captain Crunch french toast.  For all you cheap people out there that don't like to spend money on going out to eat; first off, you are annoying and second this place is right up your alley.  It's not expensive.  If you think it, you have issues.  Food is rarely more than $8 so don't let cost deter you from coming in.  Furthermore they have a frequent diner stamp card so after 10 meals, you get one free.   The coffee is excellent and so are there vanilla creamers!  They also have excellent passion ice tea.  The staff and servers are also wonderful.  Again, I'm not sure why there are bad reviews of the service here.  I've had nothing but wonderful experiences.  You are not treated like a random patron, they treat you like family here.  I don't even need to order, they always remember what I like.  I even get secret menu hash browns sometimes.    The dining area is always clean, and there is a nice little bar area complete with a TV to watch my fantasy football team get destroyed on Sundays.  I don't just give out 5 star reviews on yelp, you have to earn it; and Beach Cafe definitely did.  It is by far; the best breakfast spot in the SW part of town.  Do yourself a favor and try it.",

The potatoes were pretty bad, but I'm pretty picky when it comes to breakfast potatoes! We also had a smoothie (Blue Hawaii) with blueberries, vanilla, and banana. YUM  The service was the only disappointing thing about this meal. I guess I was expecting \"friendly\" and \"warm\" from a cute place off the strip that caters to locals, but it was pretty flat. It wasn't \"bad\" service, but it had more of an IHOP feel and less of a cute locally feel. Either way the food was good enough to warrant a return visit when we're in the area!",

Its over priced. But its decently tasteful food. Takes forever. Owners a witch. And i'm pretty sure that they continuing forget to pack my extra ranch just to piss me off.   End Rant.   PS- I've never gone in there to eat because i frankly, i'd rather tip the nice delivery driver then the ignorant imbeciles that work in the dining area.   PPS- My hot chocolate today was cold. They should call it Cold Chocolate. Or start caring if their hot chocolate is hot. One of the two would be great!",

    "text": "Great little cafe hidden away in a strip mall.  Coworkers and i come here for lunch every so often, as they have great burgers and lunch specials most of the time.    Some of the more memorable lunch specials are:  -Ranch BLT (more like bacon and bread burger, but tasty ranch mayo) -Bacon grilled cheese with tomato soup -Cuban sandwich  But my favorite thing to get here is the Ortega burger.  The tangy green chilies and the melted cheese is a great combination with the toasted buns.  Burger is usually cooked to perfection, and the fries are always fresh and piping hot.  Get it with a side of ranch and you got yourself an awesome lunch.    Friendly staff and usually open seating as not many folks know about this place.  Go check it out!",

Everything is pretty much as it is described in their menu.  No surprises.  Good service and great prices, as well.",

I feel like it's the brain child of a guy who decided to open a beach-themed eatery without considering the decor, the food, or the service.  Understaffed and uninspired.  Located in a strip mall off Jones and the decor inside is bland, at best.  Tables are tiny, the chairs wobble, the whole place feels super cheesy.  The service is the slowest I have ever experienced in my life, and possibly the least friendly.  The menu is very plain- just the usual egg dishes, nothing made from scratch or in house.  With so many great breakfast places in town, I am not sure why anyone would chose to eat here.  It is no cheaper than anywhere else and is nowhere near as good as Egg Works, Baby Stacks, Crepe Expectations, etc.  I like to support local businesses but this place blows.  Skip it, or you'll wish you had.",

    "text": "Came in from my gf searching Yelp reviews to give this place a try and right off the bat im hesitant the floors of this place are filthy not like I'm picky dirty but like my garage floor is cleaner. Already a bad first impression then the table next to ours is pretty dirty and this place is not busy at all. Even worse then all of this is some staff member was behind the bar with a dog in her hands and went back and forth between there and a bar stool and handed the dog to our server and then our server played with it and handed it back and then brought us the gravy we asked to try without a single pause to wash hands. Scarier. Then the girl with the dog goes back to work in the kitchen preparing food and the dog has completely disappeared. No way to know if she washed her hands either since it seems to be pretty lax here. Very unprofessional not to mention unsanitary who's in charge here letting this happen?  So now to the food. Belgian Waffle. Add bacon $2 for three pieces of bacon. Tf? Waffle was whatever.  The four burger sliders were pretty good.  The beachcomber was bland with very spicy salsa to make up for it.  And the lava run or something along those lines shake i ordered our server completely forgot about and then when she said \"oh did you still want that\" about 10 minutes after we got our food. I said yes she makes me a pina colada icy sort of strawberry thing which yes was good but the drink I ordered was a strawberry banana with vanilla ice cream shake...  Now during this whole process hand washing is very questionable and I don't even think it even happened at all to be honest. During majority of our visit we were the only ones there except for the dog lady who looked like she worked there too. Our server was terrible. I would probably get better service from someone if I walked into their own house slapped them in the face and told them to make me a sandwich. The worst service I've ever had never looked us on the eye or made any sort of conversation or greeting or anything and when she took our menus after we ordered she literally just threw them on the table next to us and left them there. One of our roll ups also literally looked like it had a booger on it so we asked for another.  Bottom line is this place is really only for those who are brave and adventurous and going LOOKING for a bad experience. If you came in with that mindset it would probably be amusing. I would go there just to see the worst restaurant you've ever seen in your life it's extremely dirty and questionable with terrible manager presence and customer service. The worst part is that the food is really cheap and I would love to explore the menu but wouldn't come back ever.  Jokes aside avoid this place at all costs absolutely horrid sanitation and health code violations literally everywhere and no one seems to know its a massive violation or no that it just makes the establishment look horrible",

There are bikinis hanging from the ceiling, and everything is decorated in a 'beach style'.  We talked to the server about our next stop - Reno - and she wrote down a list of places to go for dinner, as well as suggestions for things to see. We'll definitely stop by here on our next trip to Las Vegas, even if it's a little out of the way. Very family-oriented.  Love ya!",

Walking around nearly 1 1/2 hours with empty stomach, I was starving by the time I was finished with my business!  So I looked up a breakfast & brunch in the area.   I had several choices:  Baby-Stacks, Egg works, Cracked Egg, Daily Egg, etc.  But I chose this location because I have tried Baby Stacks and Egg Works; and I figured Cracked Egg and Daily Egg would be very similar to Egg Works.  So I decided to try this place.  I ordered Surfs Up Veggie Scramble and Cappuccino....  I ate the whole thing, but I would not say that it was good.  I mean. I was definitely hungry and so I ate.  Usually when I'm hungry, I feel like the food tastes better... However, I just thought I should eat because I'm hungry...   The cappuccino was a little luke-warm and not hot enough.  The roasted potatoes(?) were decent but the scrambled egg (the main dish) was a little bland and too oily.  Adding ketchup to it helped the bland flavor.  The service was very casual and I'm not complaining.  It is a casual dining place, and I do not expect much.  I cannot say that the staff is friendly though... The server did her job definitely.  She wasn't mean or rude.  She just did her job. So I would just a smile would have been nicer.    I am not sure if I will go back.  I mean, if I am in the neighborhood again, I would probably hit up another breakfast cafe to try.  However, I wouldn't mind eating here again and trying one of their burgers and smoothies... IF this is the closest location.",

The girl on the phone had a nasty attitude, told me why am I mad at them and with a pissy attitude demanded I call UberEATS. Now as a person who is in customer service I would have done my best to accommodate the customer considering it was our fault who forgot to give the Uber driver the missing item not UberEATS fault!",

Or stranded in Vegas with your last $20 trying to figure out  how to feed yourself so you don't have to stop on the drive home at some overpriced McDonalds or gas station convenience store? Look no further! Don't be dismayed at the prospect of a beach themed eatery in the middle of the desert.   This Beach Cafe has excellent food for those who are sick of fast food and Denny's quality without the hassle of navigating the strip. Only about a 10 minute drive away, this gem has a lot to offer. There is plenty of comfortable seating, clean bathroom facilities, great food, and excellent service.   I picked up an Ed's special: biscuits with gravy, bacon, and eggs to nurse myself back to good health. To wake myself up I also had a mocha drink. All the above items were fresh and well prepared, for about $10 total.   Note: I came in around 3 pm on a Wednesday (open til 4pm and still serving breakfast!) and it was the best idea i've ever had.",

Let me first say, that I have never eaten in the restaurant. All of my experiences with Beach cafe have been via carryout or delivery.  As I mentioned, the food is good, the problem is getting the food you actually ordered.  Of the 5 times I have ordered from them, 3 of them we wrong. Not just a little wrong like \"oh bummer they forgot the ranch\" wrong, but like \"WTH?! This isn't what I ordered at all\" wrong.   When you can manage to get the food you ask for, this place is great unfortunately, that only seems to happen about 40% of the time.",

We came in at 7:15am to eat breakfast, we were here before work so we had about 40mins we could spend here. At 7:30 our order was taken but the cook was doing some sort of inventory so our food wasn't going to be getting prepared for some time. We asked them to cancel their order and said thank you and the woman upfront just ignored me. I was at no point being rude with her but she felt the need to be dismissive towards me. She didn't even great us when we walked in, they actually looked at us shocked that someone would come in within their business hours.  I pretty much only shop local and if I can't shop local I at least purchase products manufactured in the U.S.A.  It's a real shame to me when I go to try a new LOCAL place and the service is that bad, I know we weren't there for that long, but you can tell right when you walk into a place how the service is going to be by how you're greeted or lack there of.  I wish I had an opportunity to try their food, had they been more focused on the customer and not on inventory that should have been completed prior to opening then I'd probably be writing a different review right now.",

Anyways, the food was mediocre at best. And I ordered a coffee with my food which never came, so I called the restaurant and they said they would deliver it now and apologized. An hour later I still have no coffee and they are about to close. So I contacted the app I ordered through and since I paid with cash I couldn't get a refund unless the restaurant decided to grace me with their presence. I won't be ordering with this restaurant again.  Update: I received my coffee, I ordered a frozen white mocha, they brought me a frozen caramel coffee, and the caramel tasted burnt.

I ordered the ultimate oatmeal with the bagel and eggs and potatoes. Someone else ordered the waffle - beach style. It was amazing!!! I had been craving a hot chocolate but figured it was just made out of a packet and didn't want to pay the price of a whole box.  We paid and when we got home I realized I had left my oatmeal on the counter. We live less than 5 minutes away so we went back to get it and I decided to order the hot chocolate. It was amazing!!!! Got a to go menu and noticed they deliver for free!  Woke up today and decided to order delivery since it's a gloomy day. I didn't mind the wait even tho I live really close because I knew the food was worth it! Once the food arrived, I was so disappointed. It was lukewarm. Our hot chocolate was not hot and had no extra chocolate or whipped cream. They also forgot the honey for the oatmeal. It just wasn't the same. Probably because it was delivered. I will return to the cafe regardless of today! If I didn't have that experience today I would've given them 5 stars!",

They opened that freg multiple times and stock freg w other useless drinks but doesn't bother to store milk in there. When I asked for a check this lady (I don't know if she's at training) just starred at me say nothing and give me a blank face. I mean, what about a smile and a OK?

My order the South Beach Burger - sauteed peppers and onions, pepper Jack cheese and a southwest sauce. The burger was decent and was decent sized. I've had better and worse. Fries were average also.   Our waitress, who was Asian and cute took good care of us with the exception that I had to go to the counter to pay.

It's more like 3.5 stars for me. Inside, the place seems like a basic cafeteria with some beach decorations. They have your typical \"mellow music\" playing as well. I know it's supposed to be relaxing but the place was a bit too sleepy for me. That being said, the patrons that were there were clearly regulars so they must be doing something right. Service was... ok. They weren't really that attentive to me, however that being said, it did look like all of them were pretty busy doing things such as putting things away, cleaning, restocking, etc. so at least it wasn't because they were just slacking off on the job. Food was good but nothing really special. It also took a little long to come out. They do look like they have a lot of tasty brunch items. I like the fun facts that you can read on the back on the menu while you are waiting for your food. They only open until 3pm, so get your brunch fix in before then.",

Our sweet waitress made me steamed milk to make it more acceptable for me.  thank you!  The owner is very nice.  We chatted for a bit.",

    "text": "I really can not believe all the good reviews of this place... Maybe they just had a bad day when I went.........   If you have ever walked into this place it has a different vibe... I am assuming they are going for the beachfront cafe, swim suits hanging from the ceiling, surf boards leaning on the walls and palms everywhere. I had never been here before so upon my original scan of the place it looks like you walk up and order then go sit down.. After standing in the middle of the room looking like a lost sheep for about 5 minutes they crabby waitress walked by and crudely said, \"  just sit anywhere\" and kept on walking. We sat down and both comment to each other, \" Wow that was rude!\"    She came back a few minutes later and handed us 2 menus and quickly said, \" do you need a kids menu?\" we again said Yes and it was a good 5 to 10 minute wait for the kids menu. Once we finally received the kids menu and decided what we all wanted we ordered..... 2 Cabo salads and a kids chicken fingers.. Now, just to set the stage here. There was 4 tables with people at them and all of them had there food so we happen to be the only ones without food so in my head I figured it would be fast. The waitress came by to see if we wanted something other than water to drink and I said sure, Ill take a iced tea. She brought the iced tea pretty quick which was nice but a few minutes later my iced tea was about half empty and she came by and grabbed it....... Now.. I was thinking that this entire experience was turning around, I could not be more wrong... Remember that Iced tea I was talking about? Well I didn't because she never brought it back. She even came by the table 5 minutes later to tell us that the food we will be out in a few and sorry for the wait. Now I know i could have said can i have my iced tea back but i figured she may have been busy and i would give her a minute. The food came out and I was half way through my salad and decided i would really like my iced tea so she came by to ask how the food was and I just mentioned, \" It is good, when you get a chance can I get an Iced Tea!\" it took another 5 minutes for that to come..... At this point I was done and did not want to be on the beach any longer. The food was okay but the wait service was less than horrible.   I'm sorry Beach Cafe but I will not be back!!!! You need to hire some new wait staff and get rid of the grouch you have in the front... I have never seen a waitress walk around with such a horrible attitude! I know we all have bad days but in a customer contact position like that you need to be able to detour your pissiness for a little while.  I can get good food anywhere, good service is what i am trying to find and Beach Cafe had no trace of it.",

There's no way a lunch for 4 people should take 1.5 hrs or breakfast for 2 when there's only one other table full should take over an hour. Not sure what the deal is here, but it's become such an issue that we're hesitant to go back in to dine. We used to go here a ton with co-workers, but no one can afford to have that lengthy of a meal-- it's just not worth it.",

The food is good- I've only been there for breakfast, so there isn't much you can say about eggs, no matter how they are cooked. I once tried the eggs benedict sliders, which were a little bland, but I usually get one of the scrambles or a croissant sandwich, which are great. The portions are big too, with lots of buttery toast or homefries, and it doesn't take very long to get your food. The service is always wonderful. Drinks get refilled quickly, and substituting veggies or fruit for my homefries is no big deal. I am not a regular, but the woman working there is always very friendly and provides service with a smile.",

My mother's favorite is the waffles; they are cooked to a perfect golden brown and served with butter and syrup. For lunch she usually gets a hamburger, but the salads and sandwiches are also good.",

I called and explained about the mix up the lady said well call eat247 (the site they use to take on-line orders) and get a refund from them! she was completely rude saying that she isn't in the business of giving free food!! the nerve! a mistake on an order is simple remake and keep your customers.. not only was she rude and vicious i mean vicious, she proceeded to say that if i wrote a bad review on-line she would call my Boss at Hilton and get me fired.. she stated the last person who had a problem here she got fired!!the owner told me that!!!! i was completely flabbergasted!!! i couldn't believe the ignorance and sheer disgusting way that the owner of Beach Cafe talked to a regular paying customer.. Beach Cafe wont get any future business From Hilton if I can help it.. I write this review to say no business owner should ever under any circumstances talk this way and say these things to a paying customer..a bad day?? it was 8:30am!!! I wouldn't support this business..She needs serious etiquette classes in dealing with people and she should be completely ashamed of herself for threatening to have someone fired from their job for writing a bad review...!!!!SHAME ON YOU JULIE JANE OR WHATEVER YOUR NAME IS HILTON IS A WONDERFUL COMPANY TO WORK FOR AND WOULD NEVER LISTEN TO A DISRESPECTFUL MAD WOMAN LIKE THE OWNER OF BEACH CAFE!!!!!!!!

One thing I liked about it was that it was grilled on sourdough bread on the flat top instead of toasting the bread. It was cut in half instead of the silly 4 triangles. My wife had the San Francisco burger which she liked but thought it was a little greasy. It is a burger on grilled sourdough w/ avacodo, bacon, and swiss cheese. The homemade chili was very good also. The staff was very friendly, the decor has a casual Hawaii theme. The prices are good and the place is clean. I am going to try breakfast there this weekend.",

    "text": "Today my office treated us to a lunch catered by Beach Cafe. I had the Roast Beef Sandwich on multigrain bread. (These were all half sandwiches) I could taste a hint of horseradish it was tasty but a little salty. I also had their Bow tie Pasta with Alfredo sauce that had little bits of corn in it. It was yummy. Their was an amazing looking dessert plate with brownies, little cookies...BIG cookies with cream in the middle. I just had a tiny shortbread cookie drizzled with chocolate. It was good... the consistency reminded me of a Mexican Wedding Cookie. I only took one cookie because I thought I would have time to go back but It was too busy. One of my cubicle mates was raving about their wraps ..saying it's the best wrap she's ever tasted. She was like , \"Why don't you get one ? \" I told her I already chose my sandwich...she was like, \"So get another one\". I told her I didn't feel like getting hijacked up there because I went to get seconds. (It was still early and not everyone had a chance to eat yet) My other neighbor offered to give me hers because she doesn't eat sandwiches. So she gets me this Chinese Wrap (we didn't know the wrap my co worker was raving about was the Southwest Wrap) The Chinese Chicken Wrap had chicken, celery, carrots and those crunchy noodles you usually put on top of salad. It was spicy yet too salty for me ..I'm super sensitive when it comes to salt. I was so full by the end of the day but before I go home Sharr E brings me another Chinese Wrap not knowing I already had one. (My co workers are so caring!) Needless to say I couldn't eat another bite !",
