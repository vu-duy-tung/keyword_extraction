    "text": "Wow, this place has really changed! They used to have great food with a homemade flavor, now it taste processed and like any other food service menu and portions are smaller as well. Probably the worst meal I've had in a while and a couple hours after eating my youngest son ended up getting sick. So adding possible food poisoning onto a bad meal, it's a solid guarantee that we will never eat there again!   Ohhh, and the delicious garlic knots, are now greasy tasteless balls of dough! No knots and no garlic!   So sorry to see what was once a great takeout place become a failure!",

    "text": "I think it is about time I write a review on this place. I've been going to Rocco's Pizza for about 4 years now maybe more. 1st time we went, the food sucked and the service was excellent. Over the years, going back as a family the food was getting better but the service was getting worse (we were told it was new management) . About 2 months ago we had a server with black framed glasses who gave us the worst service I have ever experienced. Not only was her conversation with her co-workers foul and inappropriate , she never came back to the table to refill drinks or clean off the extra plates or dishes. Every time we looked for her, she was on her phone or running her mouth off to the staff. Not sure if she was the new management but I can see why the service there sucked. We got a coupon in the mail and as a family we decided to give it one last shot before we completely write off this place. I guess we like to torture ourselves for good food. As we walked in, lo and behold... It was the lady with the black framed glasses. I was ready to walk out if she took our table. She fortunately was not our waitress that night. We had a server named Sarah. She was a breath of fresh air. She was definitely a pro at her job and knew how to treat paying customers right. Even though we watched her own coworker (black framed glasses girl... BTW, not a manager but a server) sit on her butt and did absolutely nothing AND walked out in the middle of her shift while this poor girl ran around serving over 6 tables on her own, she kept her cool and still managed to find time to make sure we were okay. Why Roccos hasn't fired the glasses girl (or maybe they did after what we witnessed last night) is beyond me. Hiring Sarah was probably the best thing that has happened and definitely saved us customers from returning again. I hope this girl is there every time we go in. I can finally say, this place has excellent food and FINALLY a great server. Let's just hope they hire more people like her. That girl was a saving grace to this place. If ever you are there, I hope you get to experience this servers skills.",

When we called they offered to deliver again but why would I want to wait another 2 hours again, they should have just offered 1/2 a refund, a new pizza at a different date or something. Had to microwave all the food so then it was soggy.  Then they had the order messed up to boot. Won't be doing this again.",

My wife and I ordered the all-you-can-eat pasta, salad and pizza (cheese only).  Let me tell you, the salad was terrible (literally came straight from a package), the pasta was extremely bland and of extreme low quality, and the pizza was a greasy mess. If you want all you can eat, you have to keep pestering the waitress to bring you more stuff, as you are only brought one item at a time.  When we went, it was so crowded that our waitress literally didn't have any time to attend to us, so we ended up with a single piece of pizza for each of us.  We just left because we didn't want to deal with the fiasco of chasing down our server to eat mediocre food any longer.    As for the quality of the pizza generally, it's decent.  Honestly, Vegas has the worst pizza options I have ever seen, so maybe that explains why people are raving about the pizza here? I don't know, but don't be fooled by the rave reviews about this place.  It's really not that great.",

But we made a mistake going there last night. I couldn't believe the service. We had had this waitress before, and we just know every time that it is going to be a huge pain every time. But we still go! But last night.... We arrived about 10 after 7 or so. There were two other occupied tables there. I think we were greeted, but then we sat. And sat. And sat some more. Finally, the girl came to take our drink order. By this time, we were ready to order our food. She seemed surprised that we were ready to order, but it had been about 20 minutes by then. We order food and drinks, and then we wait! There were other people working on the counter side, but I am not sure if they're not able to help fill drink orders. We got our drinks, and waited some more for the salads that came with the combo. Finally got the salads, and we overheard the waitress talking to another person about our pizza being messed up. The other person asked her what we wanted her to do. Well, she never discussed it with us! Finally my husband asked her if our pizza was messed up. She said yes! We figured out what we would be doing about it, and all should have been well. Drinks went dry. There was absolutely no pep in the step of anyone working. The place was empty! I don't understand what the issue was! But this has been a problem with this waitress in the past, so I guess we should not be surprised.   I really hope that some changes are made with regard to the lack of enthusiasm with the staff. I had a coworker suggest checking in to see if that particular waitress is there, and if she is, we just go elsewhere. That sucks to have to do that, but maybe that's what we will do.",

Despite the place being only half full literally at 7pm, took a good 20-25 minutes just to get the garlic twists (appetizer ordered separately)--way too long considering they weren't busy.  We watched a seated couple walk out and a couple later coming in walk out because the service was taking so long.  Then the waitress gives me my husband's salad after another 10 minutes (wrong one).  The last straw is when she (the smiley waitress) finally serves me a salad with ROTTEN PIECES OF LETTUCE IN IT.  Very gracious to take my order off the bill--my stomach was strongly turning/ready to barf and my appetite vanished.  We used to be regulars (going on average once a week) but the service has severely deteriorated in the last two weeks...last time we went took an extremely long time to receive food (same pizza salad and pasta they serve everyone else at this time--only difference is the salad dressing!) and the same waitress was slow to catch refills.  In a city like Vegas there's plenty of competition out there--not sure what is going on with them lately, but they better tighten down their process, service, and food quality or pretty soon they're not going to have any customers--no matter how good their prices are.  I can only think of picking out all the pieces of ROTTEN LETTUCE after waiting so long for my food...my STOMACH TURNING/HEAVY NAUSEA ...then seeing the pizza and spaghetti, I piled the plate on top of the other, and walked right out of there, my IMMEDIATE GOAL being to get THE NAUSEA to SUBSIDE!!!  It was a horrible experience and I will never patronize this establishment again--EVER!!! : (",

We ordered a large pizza and it came with free garlic knots with a yummy dipping sauce. The cheese pizza had a thin crust, which I love. They also have beer and wine available. The price is beyond reasonable for the great quality and quantity of food that you get. We will be back!",

When you are paying, you can try samples of desserts!  The first night we got garlic knot sliders and stromboli and maybe something else and the next time we got stromboli, garlic knot sliders and a couple other things.  So far we have not tried the pizza, but give us time.  Everything was exclellent and both times we got garlic knots while we were waiting for the food.  Portions are large and all was very tasty - love the garlic knot sliders!!  They have a lot of specials and prices are very reasonable.  We found out they deliver to our area, too - bonus!!  and let me just mention again, excellent customer service!!",

    "text": "I came here on a Friday night with my boyfriend. We ordered 2 sodas and 2 pieces of pepperoni by the slice. The waiter (the tall one with the spikey hair that stands with his hand on his hip like he's bored and has better places to be) gave us a dirty look and said \"that's all?\" Yes that's all. So he walks away and we wait and we get our pizza and it's a pretty huge slice, like equivalent to probably 3 regular slices, which is awesome. It tastes pretty good, but I felt it was slightly bland and could use a little more flavor. There was hardly any sauce either. Overall the pizza was very enjoyable. But when the waiter came back with the check and my boyfriend commented on how good the food was, the waiter just stared at him and then walked away. So we decided not to come back because mediocre pizza isn't worth being treated like we weren't welcome. It was cheap though, the bill for the two sodas and slices was about $10. Still... Not coming back.",

(turns out I would not like anyone with a mushroom allergy to die....go figure).  Rocco's has never, ever dismissed this request....until tonight.  When I told the gal our need and that we had requested this a number of times she said, \"well, I can put it on half the pizza otherwise, not tonight.  We are very busy.\"  ummm..  what?  it's that hard to NOT put mushrooms on a pizza and them in a teeny-tiny container as they have done a number of times previously?  Sorry Rocco's. Work on your staff and then I'll come back.  Congratulations Hungry Howie's.  You now have my every Thursday football order!!!",

We ordered a corn beef and pastrami sandwich and a corn beef melt with a side order of onion rings.  I was so disappointed with the quality of our food.  The onion rings were drenched in oil and very soggy.  My corn beef and pastrami sandwich was served with the heal of the rye bread.  It was served with the heal on the bottom, as though they were hiding it.  The bread was stale and dry on both sandwiches.  The meat tasted so processed, for the cost of $17.00 for the two sandwiches I could have gone 5 doors down and bought fresher bread and better tasting meat.  Please don't pass your stale heals off to carry out orders,  because the customer will not return.  I am Italian and this is not quality I was raised with.  We believe in fresh and good quality, not the garbage you are serving.  Good luck, if this is the best you can do.",

    "text": "After the poor experience that we experienced from Rocco's the owner of the establishment contacted us to see if there was any way he could make it up to us.  He indicated that they had a new chef on duty that night and that due to several complaints he had been let go.  Not wanting to seem greedy or overreaching, we had the same meal delivered that we had previously had delivered.    This time around the meal was considerably better.  The chicken strips were cooked well and were actually quite tasty.  The french fries were okay and were not stale.  The shrimp dinner for my wife was good, had a good number of shrimp, and there was a nice amount of pasta and sauce.  The only complaint she had about the shrimp was that she has never had a shrimp dish served with the tails still on them when it is mixed in pasta and sauce.  Not a huge problem, but plan on getting a little messy.  The house salad's came as advertised and were fine.    Based upon the new meal that was delivered and the concern expressed by the owner, we are now willing to give Rocco's another shot in the future.",

Unfortunately this location doesn't even come close to its sister store. I ordered online a few hours ahead to ensure I wouldn't forget to order and I could pay ahead. When I arrived they had trouble finding my order in their system and expected me to pay again but after refusing they found my order and handed it to me. Before I turned to leave once of the managers (I believe) awkwardly asked how tall I was (6'2 if you're curious) and when I answered just hummed to himself. It was weird.   Despite the awkwardness and mix-up about payment I was pumped to return home and dive into my cheese pizza and chicken fingers with mild sauce on the side. The pizza was under cooked with a chewy dough and the fingers were a burnt and stringy. After all that, it was a disappointing meal.",

Unfortunately, that has changed now. :(  The delivery driver was a bit late, which wasn't too big of a problem. But the food was DEFINITELY not on par with what I'm used to with this place. The garlic knots were hard, burnt and hardly seasoned. The fried mac & cheese bites used to be cooked in like 6 triangles and had good flavor but now they give you a bunch of bite sized pieces which have to be basically soaked in the marinara sauce to be tolerable. My boyfriend got a stromboli which he liked. The fries were just ok.  For dessert, we ordered two regular cannolis but were given four small ones. The filling was good but we didn't care for the shell much.  Like I said, I used to love this place.. but unfortunately, I don't think I'll be ordering from here anymore. :(  They get three stars because delivery didn't suck, my boyfriend liked the stromboli and because the cannoli filling is good.",

I was,however, very disappointed by the fried zucchini. $7 for an order and they were burnt and nasty. Anyone could have seen they were way overdone when they packaged it. Now I'm not judging this place off the zucchini since it's probably frozen and then just fried. I'm judging based off the fact that you could not only see they were burnt but also smelt it. Just disappointed in the quality. Did pizza well then gave up on something simple.",

Just like other places by the slice they add toppings on a cooked pizza and throw it in the oven for a few minutes.  I am generally good with that.  The service was friendly and the places seemed pretty clean.  All good so far.  I posted a picture and you can see my problem.  They added suasage that had been shaved so thin it was practically translucent. It was sliced so thin I could hardly taste it!  One slice of the pizza was soggy so I couldn't fold it the way I like - I had to fold it in half and then in half so I had a wad of pizza.  The other slice folded a little better.  I never thought I would say a pizza was too thin... but the pizza was too thin.  There was nothing to it...  The flavor of the pizza was just okay - I was underwhelmed by the whole experience.",

Now my brother ordered one and he end up getting a vegetarian yet he ordered a custom meat lover I fortunately got what I ordered. I ordered also a side salad which  took over and a half an hour to recieve. From the looks of the waitresses. And owner face after 35 minutes it appeared that they had forgot our order. All and all it took 1 hour and 25 minutes to order and eat a Stromboli and salad The best suggestion. Forget coming to eat because the Dittzy airhead waitresses might forget your order. Call in order to go. Much faster",

    "text": "It's called Rocco's NY Pizzeria! Well, I think that is not such a good name for this spot. I ordered the Italian sub. Now here's where you really will need to pay attention. The cashier R2 took my order. Not sure if each person had his or her own pass code or number when they used the register. Back to my order of the Italian sub. Server asked what I wanted on it, my reply exactly: lettuce, tomato, onion, oregano, oil, and peppers on the side. The server looked at me and said \"oil?\" We don't have just oil, it's pre-mixed with other ingredients. Ok, now I'm stunned a little. This is supposed to be an Italian restaurant, right? What Italian restaurant doesn't have Olive Oil?! What the??! He than asked me what kind of peppers? My reply, was hot wet peppers. His reply, we don't have them. At this point I was really tempted to run outside to look at the name of the restaurant displayed on the window, just to make sure I was in the right place. Maybe I had walked into the place next door by mistake. I am still really confused, disappointed and really hungry, so I decided to, shake it off and go with my gut and give it a shot.  Now a female customer comes in, she ordered over the phone. The server had plenty to say to her and told her to enjoy her pizza and her sub. Welllllllll, he called my name, handed me a stapled!!!!! bag. So I looked and wondered why they would staple it closed. And that's all I got. Not \"have a good night\", \"enjoy your fake NY Italian sub\"...NOTHING! There isn't a sub house or place that sells sandwiches on the East Coast that would have given me the responses I got from this server. They would not have questioned my asking for oil...or peppers on the side.  Once I got home, opened fort knox and saw that my oregano was in a container and not on my dry Italian sub! That really was it for me. I won't be back! I am now on the hunt for a real Italian sub shop that can make me a sandwich that reminds me of home, and when I ask for oil instead of mayo, they will say \"sure\".",

The slices were huge and filling, the cheese was good and the service was pleasant. Speaking of the service, I went during lunch time and the place was empty, but since I planned to eat it, I had to be waited on. I didn't think it was necessary and it cost me more since I felt compelled to leave a tip, although not that much work was done on their part.   Overall though, I would go back there again and try the garlic slider, that looks interesting.",

You can choose pizza by slice or small medium and large. Pizzas are massive so choose wisely unless you want to take some home for later.  The menu goes beyond pizza and I am looking forward to trying the wide selections of pastas, soups, and breads. Roccos also offers Italian Gellato is also available to complete the meal. Soda, milk or juice for the kids, and a decent selection of beer or wine for mom and dad. Roccos is much more than pizza.  The dining experience is enjoyable at Roccos as well. A recently expanded dining area with added tables, arcade and small play area for the kids and flat screen TVs add to the family atmosphere.  Customer service is small town like, something rare in this city. Employees have paid for arcade games for my kids, given us free garlic bread as we waited for the pizza, lets us taste the wine and other warm gestures. They make you want to be generous with your tip!  In conclusion, after reading this review, you are now informed enough to not choose Domino's!",

There's no way I could eat more than 2 slices, and it's a shame, because I don't want to stop eating cuz it's so good! So far I've tried 4 of their toppings: cheese, pepperoni, meat lovers, and supreme. All very delicious. My favorite has to be meat lovers because the sausages they put on it taste like real authentic Italian cooked sausages.  Another thing I have to mention are tier garlic knots. We get the order of 6 knots for $3.99. & Just like the pizza, the knots are pretty big. It comes with marinara sauce but the knots are made with such a perfect blend of butter and garlic that they taste perfectly fine the way they are.  They have daily lunch specials for really cheap. I got the 1 slice of cheese pizza + side salad and my bf got 2 slices of cheese pizza and we also ordered the garlic knots. Our total was under $17 which is pretty good if you ask me, considering how much food we get.   Last but not least the service was great. The people there are super friendly, they gave the place a homely vibe.",

The meats plentiful, but mostly a boiled ham and not salami or pepperoni. That's pretty typical of most fast food places. It felt like the food took longer than needed to get to me. No one else was ordering at the time.   When it arrived, the ends of the stromboli were steaming hot, as they should be! But the middle was mildly warm. The dipping sauce was cold.   Everything tasted okay. I've had better as the 2-stars indicate. I don't see me returning.  PS- I posted a pic.",

I got charged $84 dollars for 3 large pizzas. One of the pizzas was ok, one was under cooked and all the toppings fell off, one was burnt and missing a topping. The owner was not willing to refund my money and take the pizzas back. Unfortunately, I guess I have to take a loss as the consumer as the pizzas sits in my trash. This was my fifth bad experience at this restaurant and I've finally learned my lesson. The worst part is I had house guests, so embarrassing. Save yourself some frustration and never order from roccos.",

    "text": "A little over a year ago, this had been a favorite spot of ours, but suddenly,  the pizza seemed completely different, so we gave up on it.  Thought we'd try it again about a week ago, since it had been a while, and im glad we did.  The yummy pizza was back!  ( It might have been even a little cheaper than it used to be? )      We ordered our food online, through Eat24, it was ready on time, and we even used PayPal.  Super easy, no problems with our order.   Had an Xtra Large pepperoni pizza with Xtra cheese,  and we got the fried ravioli, fried mushrooms and zucchini.  Mushrooms and zucchini tasted like your regular 'fried bar food.'  (Nothing special, but it was exactly what we wanted at the time.) The fried ravioli was also very good. My kids loved it.         But we thought the pizza was outstanding.  Everyone seems to like their pizza a certain way, or a certain style.  It can be so different from one place to another, so I try and take all these 'pizza place' reviews in stride.     But Rocco's pizza was definately back to the kind of pizza I prefer.  it was SO yummy!   Its what I describe as the 'big, cheesy, floppy kind.'   Where you can taste the garlic just a bit.  Thin crust,  and HUGE pieces you can fold over.  (My hubby prefers the thick crust, 'pan style pizzas.'   but I prefer less bread.  But he did still really like it.)           And the marinara sauce is the BEST.    I forgot that Rocco's used to have this amazing marinara, and thankfully, its still as good.   We'll get even more next time to dip our pizza in!          (And i'm guessing the pizza you get with the 'all you can eat' lunch special is different than the pizza you actually order.  I've never had the lunch special, but it looks different from their 'real pizza' in the pictures i've seen.   I imagine a lot of people would complain about not getting the same quality pizza, but it makes sense to me.         So if you gave up on Rocco's, and it's been a while, you might wanna give it a try one more time.  And get some marinara!",

Place looked very welcoming and so, why not?! Our server (didn't get his name) young guy was extremely helpful and was very attentive of our needs. Immediately took our drinks orders, and brought out a basket of garlic knots-on the house! Knots were fresh out of the oven, cheesy and soft. 4/5.   I ordered their chicken fingers and fries from the lunch menu and they were BOMB.COM! Someone in my group ordered wings and a pep Stromboli, but they were not too pleased. The server never failed to come for refills and was on point at all times.   I've tried them prior to remodeling and have always been satisfied with their pizza. Today's visit also was pleasant. Overall, 3/5.",

We started with the onion rings which were seriously the best onion rings I've had since I can remember. Next we had the antipasto salad, which unfortunately was their one \"miss\" of the night. The lettuce was pretty wilted and brown, and it didn't have any dressing. The waitress offered us ranch or blue cheese. I asked if we could get the dressing an antipasto usually comes with and she said \"Well is don't eat it\". It also had kidney and garbanzo beans listed on the menu and we asked for those to be taken off, and she said \"Whatever barbanzo beans are\" and kind of rolled her eyes. The service fell short in that she wasn't knowledgeable about the menu at all. We ended up sending the salad back because it was just gross.  Our pizza choice was a large meat lovers, and it was amazing. When our pizza came out, Rangel, the GM came to check on us. He asked about the service and could tell that we felt it was questionable. He explained that there was a discount for first time customers and told us he would check on us again. Our drinks weren't refilled until one of us approached the server and asked for them to be filled which is a pet peeve. The pizza was amazing. I don't love pizza-I didn't grow up eating it often because my Dad was stationed in Italy and was particular about pizza. This pizza would have met Dad's stringent expectations. The crust was thin and soft, and the toppings were plentiful. It was delicious. We boxed it up and took two mini cannolis to go. They were the real deal! I got mini cannolis because most places hit the mark on the cream. These were perfect, and I wish I'd gotten the full size ones. The cream was amazing and the shell was perfectly flaky. Oh and that first time discount? 15%! It definitely made up for the other gaps in service. We'll be back!",

Our first time in here today and it's totally \"cute\" okay maybe I shouldn't use the word cute to describe a pizza joint but It's decorated in a sports theme and it's very comfy.  Ryan who welcomed us as soon as we arrived told us to pick a seat anywhere. He grabbed the menus and came over and conversed with us.  Telling us all about the breakfast and what he enjoyed the most about the menu (of course I asked).  We ordered pizza and fried ravioli. Ryan brought us some complimentary garlic knots which personally I'm not a huge fan of. These garlic knots were hot and fresh. They were tasty and not overwhelming in garlic (why I usually don't like them). These were pretty good I have to say.  The manager Rangel was friendly and can by. The customer service here is outstanding and the food to follow was pretty awesome. I wish I wasn't so full, the gelato and cannoli look delicious!!

My husband and I both picked from her list and got a calzone and the vodka penne pasta with garlic knots.  She even talked us both into dessert which we usually skip.  Everything was delicious.  The marinara sauce was flavorful, the crust was crisp and flaky and my cannoli was lick your plate good!  The customer service was perfect which in my opinion makes or breaks an experience.  So thank you to Jessie and we will for sure be back.",

Tonight we ordered delivery, as we have done multiple times before but it was a complete disappointment. We ordered at 7pm and did not receive the order until past 9:15pm. At the time of delivery we were quoted 45 minutes. The food was very cold. The pizza was thrown together. Half of the slices had pepperoni the other half did not. The bag with the wings looked like everything was thrown in there. The girl who answered the phone could not understand a thing we said. The delivery guy hung up on us because he didn't want to walk up to our apartment. The only upside is we got a discount on our order because of the inconvenience of the time. Just ridiculous. Super disappointment.",

Tonight I decided to try dining in.  Big mistake.  Wait staff did not notice us for probably 10 minutes.  TV was blaring some odious ultra left wing anti-gun agitprop special.  I asked 3 times for the channel to be changed or the volume turned down but my request was ignored.  Allegedly there was someone watching it on the other side of the restaurant...but no one was there, as the TV was on the takeout side.  Rocco's - you lost a lot of business tonight.  This will be posted in multiple places.  Update.  Owner responded privately to the Yelp review and apologized.  He states he is a gun owner and 2nd Amendment supporter.  He says he plans to keep the TVs on sports from now on.  You can make up your own minds.  As for me...I'll boycott for a month or two.  I hope some of you will join me.",

They don't go over the order when u pick up and had my order in a brown bag with about 10 pieces of tape keeping it shut. I get home and missing items. I call and am out on hold for over 10 min. I called back and again, girl says she's getting a manager and back on hold. I call back a third time after being on hold for 7 more minutes and FINALLY Ryan gets on the phone. No apology for the wait, actually no apology for anything. He tells me I can come back and pick up or a credit. I don't want to go out again as I am watching the game and I live in Aliante right across the street. I ask him to deliver them since it was their mistake and he refuses. Tells me his drivers are busy with REAL orders. What a joke. This place used to be good, but is garbage now. I have lived in this area for 8 years and it's sad to see how far this place has fallen. Don't waste your time or $$. Ryan, get another job where customer service is not required as you have none.",

Being from NJ, but only 15 minutes away from Manhattan, I think I have a pretty good idea of what NY pizza is supposed to be like.  Actually, forget that.  ANY pizza should not be like what I'm about to tell you.  Like what I saw at Rocco's, we have our pizzerias that keep the pizza out for a little bit; it cools down and the cheese starts to harden and turn a little translucent, but after heating them up, it's just fine.  Not a big deal.  Both times we were here, despite being reheated, it looked like crap.  They were really dry -- I don't mean just the cheese, which was still kinda hard, but the whole thing was really dry.  Why is my pizza so stiff?  I wondered how long pizzas were sitting out and made me wonder how their business is doing.  It didn't taste bad, but I'm used to having greasy, gooey cheese on my pizza.  Gooey, as in it's melted, and I can fold my slice in half easily because it's soft.  I live only a minute or two away from Rocco's, but I've had Vincenzo's pizza (on Craig) twice and really liked it.  I will gladly travel the extra distance to get some good NY pizza.",

The orders took a little longer to be prepared, because they were made fresh.  We had garlic knots, pepperoni/sausage pizza, and the garlic bread.  All the ingredients on the pizza were fresh.  The dough was delicious when it was hot, but when the breading got cold, it became a little bit rubbery.  The crust was just so-so.  The factor that really got Rocco's an extra star from average was the customer services.  The server Ashley went above and beyond.  She was so friendly and accommodating, that she changed my mind about not wanting to give the restaurant a chance. Overall, I would come back for another visit.",

I place my order over the phone and they said they'd have it done in 15 minutes, very convenient. I got there and everything was ready I hand over my gift card to pay, and one employee starts arguing with another employee whether or not they accept it, as I awkwardly stand there. They finally come to the conclusion and I take my food and leave. I ordered a Cobb Salad, and 2 sandwiches (not all for me). The salad had slices of ham the size someone should get on Christmas and looked as though it had been cured during the revolutionary war. The sandwiches we're not very appetizing either.

My friend and I shared a medium half everything, half pepperoni pizza and rainbow cookies.   Pizza: What the heck happened to their crust? It was like eating a cracker - pale and flavorless. What the heck happened to the pizza? It's just not as good as the last time I've been here. I had to fix it by dousing it with hot sauce. 2/5  Rainbow Cookies: When I think of rainbows, I think happy thoughts. I tried their rainbow cookies and I was hoping my trip to New York was soon enough so I can get the real deal. This brought me great disappointment. It was dry and tasted so artificial. Never again will I try rainbow cookies from this town if it's not from Bagel Cafe. 1/5",

    "text": "Almost 2 hours for what was supposed to be a 40m delivery. I usually don't review a place after the first try (well, this would be my second one in just a couple of weeks so I guess I can stop saying that now) but I'm gonna guess this is not unusually for Rocco's. Though judging by some of the recent reviews it seems they may have changed some.  I was disappointed because being from NY I love trying places that claim to have NY style pizza and use the term \"Pizzaria\" in their name (plus they have NY Giants memorabilia in the shop, what's not to like :)). The delivery guy was very kind and apologetic for the late delivery and when it comes to hard working young men and woman I never hold it against them. I wish I could say that the late delivery was a cause for the pizza not being to NY standards but the crust and the sauce just weren't up to par. This place came highly recommended by co-workers several times over so I just had to try it, again, maybe at some point they were but not anymore. We had friends over that day and ended up having to order a pie from DeLucia's because I didn't want them to leave thinking this was the so-called famed NY style pizza I've been raving about for so long.   I'll definitely try Rocco's at least one more time in person but as NY pizza goes in this town I've realized that there are places that are pretty consistent in how they make their pizza and can't imagine Rocco's recipe changing enough to satisfy my occasional craving for a taste from home. Maybe they have Zeppoles? That would make me come back for sure!  Happy eats ya'll!",

Please don't confuse this Rocco's with the one on Buffalo near Charleston because they don't have anything to do with each other.   Walking in I noticed they have 2 sides. The right of the restaurant is for customers that are dining inside (they have an all you can eat buffet all day for $8.49 plus tax) and the left side is for placing and picking up to-go orders. The people working were very friendly. The lady who helped me went over the specials and told me what was most popular. I ordered the 2 slices of cheese pizza and a drink special and waited for my order. The guy making pizzas took some slices and put them in the oven for reheating. He asked me how I was and was courteous. After he boxed up my slices I was on my way.   2 slices of cheese pizza and a drink ($6.49) - The price threw me off a bit at first. It's kind of high compared to the average $4.99 - $5.99 cost for this type of common special at other pizza joints around town. Then I saw how big the pizza slices were and figured the price was actually on point so long as the pizza tasted good. Too bad the pizza didn't taste good. Yes, the slices are huge and I was impressed  by that, but just because the slices are huge doesn't mean the pizza is going to taste good. There was a good amount of cheese however it tasted rubbery and when I took the second bite all of the cheese came right off the top. The pizza lacked flavor and I didn't even eat the second slice. I gave this place a try and while the people working inside are very friendly, I have definitely experienced better pizza elsewhere.",

I think this Pizzeria is trying to be all things to everyone and should focus on what it does best, which is clearly not NY style pizza.   Here's a stumper, their Gelato was pretty good. So my advice is to skip the pizza and just get a Gelato.   By the way the parking in this strip mall is pretty lame so plan a few extra minutes to find a place to park and walk a bit to get to the front door.",

This man literally verbally assaulted me. When I confronted him with the actual owner Robert he became more irate. He said to me if you don't like my pizza go somewhere else.DO NOT ORDER FROM HERE UNLESS YOU WANT TO BE DEGRADED!!!!!!!! Worst service I have ever had. Not only was he rude ,but lied about everything including owning the place said he was the owner for 9+ yrs. We ordered pickup and as I was paying the guy started being extremely confrontational and the pizzas were just thrown together with no care whatsoever I wouldn't be surprised if they spit on them or put something in them. Never going back if that is how customers are treated. Also I asked for light sauce not no sauce and to think I payed $23 for something that made me literally vomiting sick pretty sure I got food poisoning . I have never been more insulted and felt more uncomfortable especially when he kept coming over making nasty comments to me as I was trying to just pay and get out. Also he kept speaking Spanish to others obviously talking about me which is completely rude.I will never go back this place is horrible... trust me steer clear unless you want terrible food and people disrespecting you ... guess he thought he could say/do whatever.Also they do not honor the prices/sizes listed on their menu. Update:next day still vomiting sick no response from owner about horrible treatment I am telling everyone to stay away from this place.",

If all the Rocco's in Las Vegas are owned by different people then this makes Aliante's establishment the runt.   We stop in for a quick dinner, was not greeted when we walk in. The waitress sees us but just keeps staring without saying a word, we start walking toward her maybe she wants to help us? Nope. She walks right by us to the table just behind us!! Errr..Hello? She would have walked right through us if she could! Pizza was disgusting, it was as bland as cardboard and it broke into pieces...! I ordered a seafood pasta in white wine sauce (can't you tell I like to live dangerously?) The measure of a decent restaurant is how they handle their other items. This was a really bad idea what the hell was I thinking?! The sauce looked like homemade glue paste with calmari tentencles and some scallops that had seen better days. The worst part was the smell, it was so strong with the odor of way too much garlic, calamari and vinegar; our neighbouring tables wrinkled their noses in protest - had to cover it completely with red pepper flakes to mask the odor.  Did I mention this was a REALLY bad idea??  I took a few bites in a daze, omg am I actually eating this here right now?? Incredibly it didn't taste bad, just BLAND, is that even possible?  They are so bland that they can't even bring out the flavor of an obviously gross dish!",

    "text": "A \"hole in the wall\" restaurant that you can't pass up! I've been looking for a unique pizza place since I moved to N. Las Vegas and haven't found one that's been worth writing home about. I was going over to this area to eat at China Go Go but decided to check out Rocco's instead which is right next door. I made the right choice.  The ambiance of the place is really cool - decorated with NY sports memorabilia and that old school Italian diner feel. To start we ordered the fried ravioli as an appetizer, these were tasty but weren't the greatest I've ever had. The pizza though....YAAASSSSS! If you enjoy thin crust, large slices of Pizza you will thoroughly enjoy Roccos. We ordered half cheese (because I'm boring and original as fuck) and the other half pepperoni, bacon and ham and both sides were so delicious. We paid like 10 bucks for a large and we each only ate two slices since the individual slices themselves are so large.   I can't speak on the desserts - they have a gelato bar as well as cakes and cannoli's but we were far too full to adventure into those.   Overall I highly recommend this place. It's cheap and for the price you get an amazing pizza made full of love and deliciousness.",

The pizza was out of the oven hot, good flavor, crust was thin (not my favorite) but good. We also had a salad and then a bowl of pasta.... The server was on it and made several stops at our table to see if we wanted anything else! The menu is large and they have everything for Hamburgers to sandwiches and of course pizza.  The location is good with plenty of parking. They also have seating outside, which will be nice when it's cooler out. We will be back!",

This location has friendly staff and the food is good. One of my favorite aspects is they used to do karaoke. It's on hold until they can find a karaoke DJ. They also have TVs for the games and they serve beer too if you like a cold one with your pizza.  I give 3 stars because this place has good food and good service.

The overtly obnoxious New York memorabilia on the wall may be shouting New York but the pizza whimpers, \"meh\". This doesn't even compare to the most mediocre slice I've had in NY.   There is a certain quality that makes a pizza a NY style and that's what's missing here. They either use the wrong flour or do not let the dough rise long enough to create the gluten necessary to give the slice the right \"bite\". Simply put, the slice should not break when you fold it. The toppings were fine. It's pretty hard to screw that up. But a pizza is made by the dough.   Granted, this was my first time here and it could have been an off night, maybe. But with much better options relatively close by, treat yourself right and go somewhere like Grimaldi's for an authentic NY pizza.",

However, some areas need a good cleaning especially the ceiling fans and the memorabilia on the walls, so much dust.   This was my first time trying Rocco's NY Pizzeria & I don't know if I will be back.",

Not sure how it goes from good to bad but it did and should be addressed. None of the 6 people that are were happy with it so that's saying something. We ordered around 5 pm , order was prompt and everything but the food was not good. Garlic knots were stale, not even edible and had to be thrown out . Pizza had hardly any sauce , and the rest tasted like reheated day old pizza. Not fresh at all. Chicken was fine I suppose although they were for the kids and kids don't really complain about chicken fingers. Thankfully they were not raw I guess.   All in all we are disappointed and won't return if it's such a flaky place. It's not like this is cheap food and expect better.",

Ryan was wonderful, always attentive from the time we sat down until we left. And the Owner, Rangle was such a pleasure to talk to. He made us feel like we were guests having dinner at his home. When, (not if) you decide to try this place out - let them know Haley highly recommended you to do so! Enjoy and you're welcome!",

Chicken parm was so thin it was an insult to Italian cuisine. Pasta over cooked, and the marinara sauce was a joke, marinara sauce more like watered down tomato soup. The work of them all the pizza was just plain awful, greasy, oily and to add insult to injury we asked for thing crust yet the dough was still raw. Owners and management need to get their heads out of their asses, Costco has better pizza, I would even consider eating papa johns cardboard pizza than this place again.",

To top it off, I ordered a Stromboli #4 which comes with ham, pepperoni, salami...and I added peppers and onions...and I was saving that for the Walking Dead premier tonight.

    "text": "The prices are on the high side but the pizza, knots and calzones I've had are definitely above average. I only give so few stars simply because the place constantly seems like it's \"crashing and burning.\"  The staff are constantly in the weeds, in each other's way, behind on orders and genuinely confused. It seems to be that way even at 3-4 pm. There's a lot of kids working there, so it's understandable to a point. Honestly they are all trying to be attentive and helpful.   My experience has been okay for carry out. But with about 7-8 orders under my belt I have NEVER been given an order that was correct or complete the first time. And always with a \"you're all set,\" then me pointing out the missing or wrong item, then the staffer reading the ticket and realizing the mistake.",

Lots of angry people waiting in the pick-up area tonight! They are sure quick to take your money though.  Had to wait in line for another ten minutes to get my money back.  No apologies, no nothing! Not a good way to conduct business. I will gladly go back to driving clear across town to go to Bambino's.  The pizza is much better anyway.",

    "text": "So we have lived in this area for a year now and never stopped in, so looking for something new, we decided to give Rocco's a try. We were not sure if this location was just pizza only or had other offerings but as we walked in, you really felt like you were in a traditional Italian restaurant with the memorabilia on the walls for the New York teams, traditional checkered table cloths and TV's on the wall.  Food wise Rocco's has everything from Italian offerings to more traditional American food like hamburgers and sandwiches. Me personally, I like their thin crust pizza with extra cheese and meat toppings. Next visit I want to try one of the Italian dishes. If you can't stay, they do take out orders.   Service is really good with the staff being attentive and nice. It looks like once they get to know you, they will treat you like family. While having dinner some regulars came in and the staff all knew them by name.   I would say if your in the northern Las Vegas and looking for a cool neighborhood restaurant, I would stop in and give them a try.",

    "text": "First off, I love pizza. I've eaten it in every state I've traveled to and order it regularly from multiple places in town. By far, this has to be the worst tasting pizza I've ever eaten. It truly pains me to say that and I will explain why.  First off, no issue with delivery and the older gentleman who brought it to the door was so pleasant. Usually when you get a pizza delivered you expect it to be hot. It was luke warm at best when I opened the box. Another thing I noticed was that it lacked any type of aroma which was weird to me. But now I know why, it is extremely bland. The sauce and the cheese had absolutely no flavor. The best I can describe it is it tasted like watered down tomatoe paste. There was no hints of salt, oregano, basil... flavors you expect in a good sauce. Now for the crust, I wouldnt even call it a crust because I don't believe it was baked long enough and that would explain why it was only luke warm. There is no color to it and it lacked any type of flavor. Now I understand the saying, \"It tasted like cardboard.\" You can see from the photo is just looks like plain dough.  Overall I'm very disappointed and unfortunately I don't believe I will be ordering from them again.",

    "text": "Review Update!   After being majorly disappointed in my meal from here the General Manager, Rangel, reached out to me.  He apologized for the meal, explained that they were having some issues with the new kitchen staff and asked if I'd give them another chance.  They delivered the same meal originally ordered plus added a Chicken Parm to try as well. It was WORLDS BETTER! The Chicken Francese was juicy and had a yummy lemon butter sauce (as it should), my husbands sandwich was done right, it had fresh veggies and was stacked. We were so full after that we didn't get to eat much of the Parm but my two kids devoured it.  I want to thank Rangel for having amazing customer service and to the cook who prepared this meal correctly. Everything was delicious and handled with such class. We will be back, thank you!   ----------------------------------------------- ORIGINAL REVIEW    Absolutely bad. We've been here before, in the distant past, and it was delicious. We just ordered delivery and it was one of the worst meals I've ever paid for.  I paid 14.95 for chicken francese and what I got was an abomination. 2 TINY flavorless chicken thighs and a bunch of noodles with not only zero flavor but you can tell they didn't even salt the pasta water (hello FoodNetwork 101).  It was a container filled with greasy noodles and nasty bits....Pictures below.  My husband ordered the Staten Island sandwich... which doesn't come with fries and for $1.50 you'd expect more than a itty bitty side but also comes with....... NO- lettuce, tomato, mustard, mayo........... I guess it's a good thing we have condiments because it wstraight meat and cheese there.  I WILL NEVER ORDER HERE AGAIN AND AFTER A HELLA DISAPPOINTING $35 MEAL YOU SHOULDN'T EITHER.",

I use to order the all you can eat special but after taking a better look at the menu I've discovered that a large cheese pizza and two small house salads is plentiful for a family of three. This way is much more economical and just as filling. Special thanks to our waitress tonight she was super kind and very attentive. She made us feel right at home. The pizza was piping hot, a nice and cheesy slab of deliciousness.  Again quick recap; three drinks, large cheese pizza, two small house salads, and an order of garlic knots came out to roughly $32!!! That's an awesome deal!!! Total must try if you're new to the area or just craving some quality piz",

It was wonderful how it was all arranged on the walls. They had TVs going with the game on. Also they had a section for our Vegas Knights ( nicely done)  Staff was beyond courteous with suggestions. I got some items to eat there, and a few to take home. Our waitress suggested the Zeppoles done half and half, so of course I had to try it. These were wonderful dough bites deep fried and tossed in powdered sugar, and cinnamon & sugar for the other half. Plus we got the cheesecake. Both were very good.   My take home was the Cannolis of course, and this pastry called a Cannolis Slider.  The sizes are very generous. Prices are very reasonable.   Location is 215/ Alliante Pkwy. Ample parking.",

Here's our story: We've been eating at Rocco's pizza ever since they opened, when the restaurant was only half the size. We went there with friends all the time, unfortunately that will not happen again... 9 out 10 times I ordered the lasagna. It used to be the best in town! Used to be.  As the years gone by, so did the taste of the food. Finally I have decided to write a review because our last order was not eatable. My lasagna was dry like the desert. Once I added marinara sauce and cheese, I was able to eat some of it from the middle. The garlic knots however, were hard as a rock. Seriously - not over baked, just solid rock hard. No worries, I made some garlic toast at home. What happened Rocco's pizza?  Be careful with the food quality because people might stop eating there.",

I regularly get a sausage and pepperoni here, and it is refreshing to see that they use shaved sausage instead of out of the bag uniform sausage spheres. Even though I consider myself more of a carnivore, I regularly get a cheese pizza as well and it always has enough cheese and is just as good as any meat topped pizza.   Toppings and cheese are always spread out evenly and goes to the edge of the crust. The crust itself is always chewy, not too thick, cooked thoroughly, and never burnt.  Customer service is always top notch. When I come in to get my orders they are always ready to be picked up and are always correct.  This has become a go-to spot of mine to get a good pizza.",

Long Island!  I was so happy to have found this place and it has served our family well for many years.  I don't know if they switched recipes or if they've just gotten sloppy.  The pizza used to be a perfect balance of cheese, sauce and the most delicious crispy crust.  Over the last year, we have received the soggier, greasiest goo.  Can't complain about delivery or anything missing from our orders, just a gripe about the quality of food and ingredients.  We will miss you, Rocco's!

I really appreciate the shaved sausage they used on my NY-style pizza, rather than the crumbles and lumps most other pizza places use. The prices are very reasonable. I have also ordered the eggplant calzone, which had a little less eggplant that I would have hoped for, but had very tasty ricotta-mozzarella blended with tasty spices. I'm just an eggplant fiend, that's all. The shrimp scampi pasta was a little disappointing. Not a lot of flavor and the sauce was very watery. Garlic knots they bring to your table are AMAZING, and the calamari appetizer is equally satisfying.  Most of my experience at this store has been takeout ordering. They seem to have to have a lot of extra people behind the counter and I never know which one is supposed to take my order at first, until someone addresses me. Then again, I tend to come in at times when their dining room is not very busy.  Overall great service, and I still frequent here.",

Finally, one waiter had no choice but to address us since he was bringing the bill to the table we were standing next to. At this point, yes I wanted to walk out...but my son was dead set on eating here. So he seats us, then walks away. No menu, no drink order. They stand in the back doing who knows what, look over, continues doing who knows what. Several minutes later we get menus. I dont care whether the food is decent or not, the service is sh*tty!!!! I have no idea what kind of system they have going but clearly they can care less. This is my last time dining here...EVER. and for the food, its ok. The pasta fagioli is simple but good.

Drove around the area looking for something, wanting to avoid a chain sit down restaurant or fast food, we saw Rocco's.   Walking in, they have New York photos, sports memorabilia and such adorning all of the walls and most of the flat surfaces. Their menu was surprisingly huge for a pizza place as well. The cashier seemed a little cold and distant when we got there, almost like a True New Yorker, troubled that we would show up and make her do something.  Settling on a special of a salad, slice of pizza and drink, we sat down in the slightly cramped dining area awaiting our meals. Our salads came out first, they were decently sized, with lettuce that was almost fresh and not that brown around the edges of some pieces.  Next came our pizza, good sized, NY style pizza by appearance. Once it hit our mouths though... it was very bland. The crust was tough and crunchy, to the point of being tough to rip bites away from the slice.  I can't say that I was impressed by their take on NY pizza, or pizza in general, nor can I say that I will ever want to go back.  On the other side, the staff did seem less stand-offish once we were heading out, one gentleman held the door for our group and wished us well for the day.",

    "text": "I knew the original Rocco and while he's no longer a part of this restaurant I was hoping that the food would be the same. They have a $7.99 all-you-can eat dinner that consists of picking from the following menu: salad, cheese pizza (toppings extra $) and pasta with marinara sauce.   They serve garlic knots complimentary, I thought these were quite good and enjoyed the dipping sauce. The salad was a bit disappointing because it was plain. Some lettuce, a few strands of carrots and tomato slices. The cheese pizza was OK. It's better when you ask for it to be well done when they heat it up, it makes the crust crisp up. The pasta - while I appreciate that it was served piping hot, the sauce didn't taste the same as I remember so I was a little disappointed with that.   Overall, it was OK.",

So my intent wasn't to be wow'd by some gourmet offering.  I just wanted some good pizza.  My measuring stick ended up being a standard Hawai'ian, and standard it was.  I didn't set out to be impress, and I certainly wasn't beyond expectations.  Was it good enough? Heck yeah.  Decent thin crust which was cooked till crispy and not beyond -- which I find cheaper places either get right or royally screw up.  There were enough toppings to get the job done.  Order was made and good to go in a very acceptable amount of time.  Friendly service, and their pizza boxes support recycling.  All-in-all, mission complete.",

    "text": "My husband and I were having a lazy Friday night so we decided to order delivery and found Rocco's menu in our stack to try. It was over an hour before our food was delivered and even though we were both starving, I could not force myself to finish the food.  My husband got the calzone- there was a severe lack of seasoning. The crust was like eating cardboard. It was chewy and had absolutely no flavor. Usually pizza crust is my favorite, but if their pizza crust is anything like this calzone then I would highly not recommend. Even dredging the calzone in marinara sauce did not rescue this sad little dish.   I ordered the Chicken marsala. The menu said it came on a bed of pasta. So I assumed that the pasta would be dressed with sauce, maybe some cheese? Salt? Seasoning? Anything? Nope, I was wrong. The \"bed of pasta\" was literally pasta drained from the boiling water straight into the take out container.... now why would I want to eat plain pasta?? Disgraceful. I even tried to find some marsala sauce to toss over the pasta, but it was non-existent. The Chicken marsala completely lacked flavor and seasoning. Completely under-salted - and I normally hate salty food. They might as well rename this dish- plain chicken breast over a bed of plain pasta.  Garlic knots- When i heard my entree came with garlic knots I was very excited! I love anything carbs and bread. Boy was I disappointed. These knots were hard and extremely stale. What a let down.  I have to admit that we did not try the pizza and I know this place is a pizzeria, but based on the dishes that we did try, I will not waste anymore money and time order from this place. Sorry for the harsh review, but if you can't make the dish right, then take it off the menu.",

But very good however. I've always felt they hastily make their pies because the ingredients at times are unevenly distributed as was the case with the mushrooms on my pizza this time. About 20% of the pizza had no mushrooms and since I'm stating my observations I will say that they could have used some more pepperoni too. After saying all that, the potential for outstanding pizza is there. It was very good and hot.   I'm warming up to the idea of making more frequent visits to Rocco's as I'm trying to avoid Blaze Pizza as much as possible.  But try Rocco's yourself. I don't believe you'll be disappointed and you may be able to provide insight in which I have not noticed. Try it and let me know by your review.",

    "text": "5 years ago, this place was a favorite of my household and the business i work for. I rated it a 5 star and would recommend to everyone. Now, myself and my friends have had multiple terrible experiences with the online ordering and customer service.   More than 6 months ago, my business did a lunch order. We ordered a bunch of cold sandwiches and they all came with meat and cheese. no veggies available to add online or condiments. When I drove all of the sandwiches back to the store to say \"ummm why did you not include anything on these 7 dollar sandwiches?\" They blamed the eat24 site. I told them there is no option to add veggies or condiments on their sandwiches. They said they can't alter their own menu on the website...which i find hard to believe. I'm sure the manager didn't mail their menu board the EAT24 headquarters for them into input. So i said fine, but make sure you guys get that fixed because it's going to piss a lot of people off if they get sandwiches like mine. Well, months have passed and they have not fixed any of the issues with their online ordering.   My friend also ordered wings and in the notes section literally typed \"NO SAUSE NO SAUSE NO SAUSE!!!!\". When she went to pick them up, they had sauce. She said \"my notes clearly said no sauce\" and instead of just remaking the order of wings and that being the end of the issue, the employee just said \"well they are made, so there is nothing we can do\" Even admitting the mistake was their fault but still not willing to make it right.   I understand having young people work your storefront can lead to bad service from time to time. but not fixing your web menu is costing you money. If you don't understand how to fix it, call or hire someone to do it. They have probably lost nearly $1000 dollars in sales annually just from my small circle of friends not wanting to deal with them anymore over the past year. I love their pizza and their sandwiches too.",

Last night my family and I dined in, the waitress was a bit too casual for me.  She was very nonchalant and when she would bring things to our table, she'd just toss is on the table. They've got large heavy menus, I turned away from her direction to put my phone in my purse and as I turned back I was startled because she plopped my menu right in front of me, it was loud lol.  She was very polite and friendly though.  She didn't check on us often so we ended up having to make our own drinks a couple times.  The pizzas we tried were Cheese, Fresco, & Chicken Alfredo. They all tasted good, but nothing amazing for the price you pay.  I picked this place because it was close to our house and it was a $, I would have listed this as a $$.  Their cheese pizza tasted & held together better than the gourmet ones.  The other two were pretty hard to eat without everything sliding off.  The drinks need to be addressed, we all got Sierra Mist or fruit punch.  Their Sierra Mist tasted horrible to me, like algae or mildew, I couldn't drink it and sent it back and got a bottled water instead.  For some reason the fruit punch tasted fine.  Not sure if they have that pre-made/mixed, and the Sierra Mist needs water added but I'm pretty sure they're using faucet water for that.  Absolutely disgusting!",

The service was outstanding, so will be back again and again. Can't wait to try the lunch and dinner menu, too! Update: I went back the same day for dinner. Amazing slice of eggplant pizza, a side salad, and garlic knots. I am in 7th heaven.",

    "text": "This really sucks because their food is actually pretty good, but they can't get an order right to save their lives. I've NEVER had an order delivered 100% correct. From something as simple as forgetting a ranch dressing, to getting someone else's order entirely.  Also when you go to their website to look at their menu and hit \"hot sandwiches\" the only thing that comes up is a breakfast menu. Anyway, just a heads up I learned the hard way their meatball sub DOES NOT come with cheese. It's extra.  Like I said, the foods decent. But they need to hire people that can read tickets..",

All acted like they couldn't here me and I get the excuse of \"well when we only have one driver it's very hard\". As a consumer that is not my fault your establishment only had 1 driver on a Saturday... in the summertime where let's face it Pizza is the way to go. Plus I'm sure other customers are utilizing the grub hub drivers offered thru the yelp app. I called you guys directly. Either way really disappointed. We order from here all the time. Not anymore.

We each ordered a sandwich from their lunch menu and my comments are limited to those. I had the meatball sandwich and I'm giving that a great review. The meatballs were delicious and the roll really added to the flavor. My issue was with the lack of sauce that was on the sandwich. It made the meatballs very dry to not have an adequate amount of sauce. It could have been served on the side which would have been a perfect choice. I also didn't understand the side of French fries served with my sandwich. I inquired about the possibility of a different side but was told that it would be an extra charge. I feel a perfect side with a heavy meatball sandwich would be a small green salad instead of the fries. Perhaps management could consider a request like that instead of serving a side that just didn't work for me!!",

My pizza finally comes out at 6:00pm.(nearly an hour after ordering, for a pick up?) It didn't even go until the oven until after I got there. The least Rocco staff could have done was been honest and maybe offered me a drink or something while I was waiting. Terrible first experience. I called to see if this was a normal procedure and I'll I got was a disingenuous \"I'm sorry\" then silence. She didn't event put me on a phone with a manager- Definitely won't be back. I'm huge on customer service and it was non-existent here. If I could leave zero stars, I would. Edit: Also asked for double cut. Did it arrive that way? No. Hah!

The 5% discount they offered me was insulting, eat24 ended up eating a chunk of that bill. I've also received someone else's entire delivery order on a few occasions. The food is usually hit or miss. It's a surprise every time! The dining room is truly an enigma. The last time I was there, there were 4-5 wait staff running around like the three stooges. I've seen an entire Chili's run on less floor staff. As an Italian from one of the 5 boroughs, I'll admit to liking your red sauce, which is a big deal. See you soon, I guess.",

Today the combo had mushroom, sausage, and pepperoni. I had a drink with me so I asked if I could get the combo without the drink. The cashier gave me $1 off. The pizza could have been heated another minute longer, but it was still good.  They recently started a AYCE for $6.99, which includes pizza, salad, and pasta.

Never eat chain store pizza, what a waste of time. If you are within 5 miles of the Aliante then you need to make Rocco's one of your choices for Italian.   Here is a little strange tidbit about Rocco's. I give their fresh pizza about 3 and 1/2 stars. However, I give their day old pizza (you know, the stuff that sits in the box all night and you warm it up in the toaster the next day) 5 out of 5 stars. It is by far the best day old pizza I have ever had. The crust has an excellent flavor the next day. I think I am going to have to buy two pizzas from now own, one to eat fresh and one for the next day.",

And the broccoli OMG!! I generally do not order alfredo with broccoli as the broccoli is not cooked or has a bad taste but Roccos knows how to cook the broccoli in this dish its wonderful! I have also had the piccata, i read on a previous review that it was too lemony and that is not the case... the chicken is lightly breaded and very tender. The zeppoles with powder suger are really good some places make these really tough but these are very light! The stromboli is my husbands favorite and the pizza is equally good.... the meatballs are so flavorful and are really good we get them with the spaghetti!!!  This is one of my favorites and i order from them often!!! At least once a week!! Definitely a must try! Also the guys that deliver are very friendly!! :-)",

The mac & cheese bites are good but just so you're aware, there's 6 triangles of mac & cheese bites per order. Their cannolis are also very good. I've had the regular and the chocolate.  In addition to their great food, I've also received great customer service! It can be noisy while ordering on the phone but the service you're given despite that kind of helps in having to repeat yourself due to them not hearing you well. Though I wish I didn't feel like I have to yell while ordering food on the phone.  I have yet to sit down and eat there so I can't comment on the speed of service or anything related to that but my order is always ready for pickup when they say it will be or not too long after.",

When asked if we could be put on hold we said No we were just on hold and noone helped us.  So the girl began to take our order.

They expanded the small shop to include a dining room within the past year or so, so you can comfortably dine in here if you prefer. There are plenty of other options besides pizza (available by the slice), from hot Italian sandwiches to linguine with clam sauce. The pasta dishes are decent, priced a bit high, but the portions are quite large for one person. They also have gelato, which you're probably not going to find too many places around the area. The service is very friendly, alcohol available.",

I ordered a Stromboli and garlic knots online at EAT24 at 135pm.  The food was promised at 205pm.  At 229pm, I still had not received my order.  I called Rocco's and spoke with a manager (Robert) who told me the Stromboli I ordered is cooked fresh and takes about 20 minutes.  I completely understand, however it was almost an hour.  He apologized and basically said the delivery man should be knocking at my door any minute.  It wasn't until the end of the conversation, when he sensed I still was not happy with his response, he then offered to take 10% off my NEXT order...next order...that's a pretty BIG assumption that I'm going to order from you again.  Sadly, this evening (on the same day as my order) I had already planned to order a pizza for my family for dinner, I may revise that plan.  I will give them one more chance to earn my business, they are always kind when I go to the restaurant; anyone can have an off day..but surely for an hour and ten minute wait (finally arrived 250pm) for a Stromboli and some garlic knots, you can offer more than 10% OFF my NEXT order...SMH!",

We got a flyer in the mail advertising a salad bar which was perfect because I could take my family for pizza and I could eat the salad bar and 2.) Because when I went on YELP to check it out I read bad reviews from what seemed like someone trying to sabotage them. So we decided to give it a try and support the local family business. We stopped in about 730 on a Sunday night after driving in from California. The first disappointment was that there was no salad bar. So I was a little's pissed off, but my family wanted pizza and it was getting late so we decided to get the pizza to go.  Not complaining about the service. Everyone seemed friendly and it seems they have quite a few regulars that dine there. Plus they had football on so we could see the game while we waited for our food. We ordered a large pizza and it was HUMONGOUS.  OK, in all honesty, I don't eat pizza so I personally didn't try the pizza, but my family said it was pretty delicious. They liked that the crust was thin and not thick and \"doughy\" and said it was pretty decent. I didn't see what all the bad reviews were about we personally had an OK experience. Besides the False advertising of the full salad bar which I'm still kinda Mad about, but in all fairness everything else was not bad. We most likely will wait until they really DO HAVE the salad bar before we return, but if your in the mood for pizza and live close by this place isn't bad. Don't believe the yelp hype.",

I picked up my large pizza with black olives (DD loves olives), and headed home.  It tasted like...pizza.  A step above Costco pizza (which isn't saying much), it had a good sauce-to-crust ratio (a nice thin layer of sauce), and they were generous with the olives.  The crust was soggy and droopy in the middle, crispy on the edges, lacked flavor (some salt could've helped), and had a chewy/tough texture.  I'm glad I didn't pay the full price of $13 for my pizza, and I probably won't be going back to Rocco's anytime soon.",

Nothing NY about any of this.  Hot sandwiches had stale TOASTED rye bread (was supposed to be marble rye-and what NY deli routinely toasts the bread on corned beef and pastrami sandwiches? ) and corned beef and pastrami were heated in a pan-yes a pan. Meat had no flavor either-couldn't have been that fresh. When we first tried them, my wife said meat tasted like  it had been heated in a pan and when I called to complain they confirmed that yes, we do heat the meat in a pan.   What NY deli (or any deli for that matter) have you ever been to that heated sandwich meat in a pan?  Thought at least their salad would be edible- was, sort of, if having fresh lettuce isn't essential to you. Did have a lot of feta on it, which is fine but not if it's intended to hide the lack of freshness of the lettuce. Seems like everything we ordered was stale and they attempted to hide this fact  any way the could.  At least the order was delivered in a timely fashion.

The spaghetti was good, stuffed shells really good and the pizza was awesome.  The service was excellent too. I waited there and they kept checkin in on me, offered me a drink and everything. The cashier even helped me to my car as I had my 2 year old neice with me.",

Sauce seemed a bit off, can't put my finger on it, but it seemed too bland almost watery.  Maybe I'll go back, maybe I won't.   There are enough other so-so places around that aren't as far away.",

    "text": "I thoroughly enjoy Rocco's - the lunch special of a drink and two slices of cheese for $5 is fantastic, and the slices are huge.  If you like New York Style pizza, this is the best in the neighborhood.  I always get straight cheese.  The crust is perfectly done, just the right amount of sauce, and there isn't an insane amount of cheese.  All in all, for a neighborhood pizza place, it fits the bill.",

    "text": "This place was mentioned to me today and being a pizza lover, decided to check it out.  When we walked in, I was a little turned off by all the pizza pies laying around waiting for the pizza by the slice orders.  But, I decided to put that behind me and order a Large pizza with Pepperoni, green peppers and mushrooms.  Unfortunately, my favorite pizza topping is green olives, and they do not carry them.  I was told it would be 15 minutes until it was ready.  It took approximately 30 minutes :-(  I have to say, the pizza was fresh, hot, and surprisingly VERY good.  the only issue I had is that it was a little greasy.  I am not sure if that came from the cheese or the pepperoni, but it was one of the better pizza's I have had.  If they would only have met the time commitment they provided me, I would have given them 5 stars - even with the grease.  The place overall could have been a little cleaner, but it was, afterall, Saturday night.",
