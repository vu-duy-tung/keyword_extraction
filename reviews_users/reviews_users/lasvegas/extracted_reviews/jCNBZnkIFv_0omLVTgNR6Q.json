Although I like those deals I'm always a bit bit weary that I may get blindsided with disappointed. Therefore I cross reference with Yelp! Fellow yelpers are totally on point with how fabulous the location is. The view of the planes taking off (and at dusk) was spectacular. So big thumbs up for that! The service was very good, Cash was our server. We had a bit of confusion with our groupon and he was very helpful in resolving the matter smoothfully. Being an Atlanta Native I've been lucky emough to experience dozens of Indian restaurants (ie.street food, Gujurati vegeterian, North and South Indian to name some) so the food did not get me too hyped up. It was descent, the spices we're a bit off for my taste. I can def say that their portions are very nice. We ordered 5 meat entrees, 4 vegetarian, an order of Nan and a Roti, and 3 appetizers. The white rice was a complimentary, and 4 were brought to us. We had two bags full of to go containers filled to the top with a little of everything. This was enough food for another full meal for all 7 of us. Side note-the roti was not the type of roti we expected to get. It was more like a lighter and crispier version of their nan. So their spices weren't my fav, but for sure expect a great view, some good service and tons of food!",

Quite tasty and quick to eat.  Loated in the industrial area on Sunset Road, right across from the Las Vegas airport.  You can watch the planes take off and land right on the airway strip.",

So lets go a bit into more detail on each one:  Amazing service - This place has a great staff that really knows how to take care of their customers.  My friend and I spent quite a bit of time talking with the owner who is an amazing and very interesting guy.  Service is super fast and very attentive.    Great food - There is a reason why all reviews rant and rave about the food at this place.  The menu has authentic Indian cuisine done to perfection.  I definitely want to stop by here for lunch to try their Lunch Buffet.  Hookah - If you are a hookah person this is among the top three places in the valley.  This is the only one that I know that will serve hookah in a quiet, intimate atmosphere where you can go and enjoy the hookah with friends or on a date and don't have to worry about loud music and a bunch of underage kids.  Also the only place in the valley to serve all glass hookah for the price of what you would usually get a regular hookah for.    PS.  One thing I have not mentioned is the view.  This is the only place in the valley that has a perfect view of the airport and the strip.  You won't find that ANYWHERE else.",

Well, to say the least, this spot won't let you down if you are craving -   A) Authentic Indian Food B) Phenomenal Service  C) Unbelievable Views  Situated in a nice little shopping center on the 2nd floor, Pure looks right out at the airport as well as the strip, leaving you with an unobstructed view of Las Vegas as well as the ability to watch planes land and take off, quite fantastic to be honest.   The food, well the food was awesome. The chicken curry, definitely hit the spot and the spices left my mouth tingling in every right way!   As awesome as the food was, what really took an already fantastic Indian spot to a whole new level even for Vegas terms, was the service! Mani! This guy is determined to to make sure this restaurant remains successful. He recommended what to get, we got it, and HE DID NOT LET US DOWN! Genuinely a good man, we were able to talk about anything and everything with him and he made sure every step of the way we were 110% satisfied, no matter the request.   We took out a long time employee from Mexico, who thought he knew spices like no other, but he had never tried Indian. The goal of outspicing Jesse... Accomplished!!  Thanks so much Mani as well as the other gentlemen of Pure Indian!",

We enjoyed the clean, bright interior with the airport runway view and found the staff kind and efficient (though one of the gentlemen cleared our napkins and drinks while we dished up a bit of rice pudding for dessert--but I'd rather have the \"mistake\" be efficiency versus slow service).

    "text": "I've tried to cater food twice from this place and both timed were failures...  The first time was for a wedding and we pre-ordered some snacks including samosas, various pakoras, and chicken tikka. We placed the order about a week in advance, and deposited half. When we showed up to pick up the food at the agreed time, they told us that the food wasn't ready and we would have to come back in 1 hour. No big deal - we came back and got the food. When we came home, we realized that they didn't give us our full order! Since we were already an hour late, we just let it be.   The second time, we only catered 50 samosas. We prepaid in full about 3 weeks before the event. When I showed up to pick up the samosas, they didn't have it ready and told me that they didn't even have the normal samosas, and instead only had the tiny triangle ones and will give me 150 of those for the same price I paid....those triangle ones cost $4.99 for a pack of 100 and they were trying to charge me $50. The people said they didn't have my order, so I showed them my receipt and told them I paid in full. Instead of making it right, they hassled me about giving me a refund and tried to get me to take something I didn't want...  Pure India was better when they first started, but due to the negative experience with catering, I can't recommend them at all.",

It can be slightly confusing to find this restaurant since the lit-up sign does not actually say \"Pure Indian Cuisine,\" but just follow the paper signs up to the entrance on the second floor. The atmosphere is quite modern and hip, and there are large windows with amazing views of the airport tarmac just across the street. This would make a great date place!  We were given some complimentary papadam to start, which also came with mint and tamarind chutneys. Service was friendly. I will say that it took quite a while before our food came out, but I suppose they make everything to order.  Unfortunately, the portions were not the biggest, so even after two entrees and an order of garlic naan, my brother and I were not full. The garlic naan was a decent size (four pieces) for the price though, and the eggplant and chicken dishes we ordered were very flavorful and tasty.   There was also live music when we visited, which was nice.  Overall, this is a very pleasant restaurant, but maybe consider coming for the lunch buffet if you are super hungry; it would yield better bang for your buck.",

This is niiice!\".  Not having luggage really does make all the difference.  Entrees for dinner are a couple of dollars more than other places, but they do make up for it with slightly larger portions and some seriously delicious fare.  Their version of chicken korma was fantastic.  The nutty cashew flavor was definitely amplified and those occasional hits of raisins were like lapdances to my taste buds.    Even though our other entree was billed as \"Palak Paneer\", which is supposed to be all spinach, less creamy, and no garlic, the server informed us that they used saag for this dish.  That was fine by us as it was still very good.  I appreciated the slight coarseness of the greens and the firmer than usual blocks of paneer.    I would choose a meal here over 70% of the eateries at the nearby Town Square and look forward to crushing the lunch buffet soon.",

I got the Lamb Korma with 9/10 spice level and my wife got the Chicken Vindaloo with 8/10 spice level.  Both dishes tasted excellent perfect combination of Indian spices and flavors. They certainly lived up to the level 9 heat level as my nose was running halfway thru my meal. Only drawback is that they only gave us one small saucer of rice to split for both of our meals but the waitress was nice enough to give us a little more rice complementary upon request.  Service was good. Our waitress was friendly and the food came out in a reasonable time but it wasn't busy in there when we were in there so it's hard to tell how they perform when busy. Otherwise, nice place to visit if you want some Indian food.",

    "text": "Indian cuisine is an interesting category on Yelp. I feel as though a lot of non-Indians in certain parts of the U.S. really haven't experienced truly outstanding Indian food, so they don't have much of a frame of reference when reviewing Indian restaurants.  If you ate at Pure and felt you had great Indian food, then you're going to be truly blown away when you finally do eat great Indian food. You didn't have it at Pure though.  As someone who's lived in India and also eaten some of the best Indian food in the U.S., I continue to be extremely disappointed by the quality of the Indian food offerings in Las Vegas. Overall, Indian cuisine lags far behind many other ethnic cuisines in the City.  Pure is somehow a 2-3-star restaurant with a 4.5-star rating on Yelp, which is very misleading in my opinion. Many of the curries, which should be more distinctive, are just slight variations of the chicken tikka masala, which is average.  I've had 4-5 of their curries, including the butter chicken, korma and vindaloo, and all were average at best. If I had to pick one, I'd go with the butter chicken.  The quality of their naans and rotis is poor. The samosas were average. The soups were not authentic.   If you eat at Pure, notice that there's an Indian banquet hall in the same shopping center that attracts large numbers of Indian clientele, yet very few Indians eat at Pure. Indians do not like to pay a lot of money for mediocre Indian food, which is unfortunately what you get at Pure.",

It's a little pricey compared to what I'm used to paying for Indian food but so worth it. We tried our favorite dishes - chicken tikka masala, butter chicken, palak paneer, and dal tadka. All of them were great. Often dal is watery but there's was perfect. Good consistency and great spice flavor. The chicken tikka masala was probably the best I've had. The tomato flavor shined through without being overpowering. And both palak paneer and butter chicken were above average. The place is hard to find. There isn't clear signage and when you walk in it would be hard to tell it's necessarily a restaurant. The decor is bizarre for any restaurant but the food is so good. Definitely worth a trip out to the airport!",

Arrived 2:05 sat down and waiter said kitchen might be closed and I said I was the one that called and he said it's up to the chef. He said they might only be able to do takeout and I said \"No\" and he came back and said it's all good and we ordered. (He was very polite and friendly during this whole ordeal). We ordered right away we were starving, and food came out 15-20 min later. I was worried they were just going to microwave the food to get us out as fast as possible but nope! Everything made fresh you could tell. The cheese naan is absolutely the best naan I've ever had AMAZING! The eggplant n peas veggie dish off the top flavorful! The butter chicken, tikki masala chicken and shrimp vindaloo were all great and the rice was perfect. Awesome Indian food our favorite so far in town (I have to say we've had better tikki masala chicken other places but theirs is really good too) We will be back!!!!!

    "text": "Decided on Indian food today for lunch, all five of us got there at 11:40 and had no wait. I perused the menu and opted for the lunch buffet for $11.99.   They had a wide variety and all the naan bread you can eat :-). I tried the tofu curry, vegetable curry, butter chicken and veggie spring rolls. I also tried some f the sauces with the spring roll. The basmati rice fried rice and white rice was very good. Love to soak up the excess curry with it and dip the garlic naan bread.   The views from this second story restaurant are amazing as it overlooks the airport runways and excellent views of the strip. Could be a great place for a New Years party as you could see the entire show!  The lunch buffet was delicious and I will be back. After looking over the menu I might come for dinner as well so that I could try the chicken or shrimp vindaloo varieties.",

I dragged another Flight Attendant along to share the joy of the spectacular views of the airplanes taking off and landing from the restaurant table.   Some of my favorite dishes at pure Indian: 1.

You must take the elevator to the second floor to access properly.  Passing buy the empty hookah lounge, you'll eventually find the restaurant.  View of McCarran airport is what you will see - delightfully interesting!  Finally, I entered and garnered a table.  Service was quick and to the point.  The typical Indian buffet was the offering; however, on second inspection, it was anything but typical.  Selection more traditional and separated via meat vs vegetarian.  They put signs everywhere to describe each item.  For entertainment, they had the baliwood blaring on one TV and an interesting game of cricket on the TV at the bar..  I watched the both.  I would give this one higher stars, but I was served a water in a dirty glass!   The food was tasty enough and well presented.  If not for the water, I would think about 4 stars...anything higher would be disingenuous.",

The naan here has a layer of crunchiness on the bottom. The puri bread was soft and i used it as a holder for my entree. The mango chicken surprised me completely because i didn't expect what i was given. I asked for mild since i don't eat spicy food. I was destroyed when i took my first bite of the mango chicken inside by puri bread(made a taco out of it). It was sweet, soft, warm, juicy, heavenly, and at the end a small Ka-Chow(it had some spicy flavors). This is by far the go to dish if you come eat here. The shrimp garlic masala tasted like a garlic baby spicy shrimp from hot and juicy. It was good but not great.",

One thing I wasn't a fan of is their loyalty card, you sign up using your phone, for every 10 meals you get a free one, if you normally eat by yourself it works perfectly, but if you have a family or eat as a couple you are screwed, they required each person to have their own card, so if you bring your husband or wife or friend with you, you can't put everyone in the same card, I feel this is wrong, I been to so many other restaurant with the punch card and they are all under same card, so I feel like it really isn't a deal at all if you eat there with family member, due to this reason I quickly know I won't be coming back as often as I wanted.",

Pricing: It was very reasonable for all the food we got. There were 5 of us, we got all the things i listed above, plus a Taj Mahal beer and 2 Sprites, and the total w/tax was just over $120 + tip. Full disclosure, we had a groupon, so we got a few dollars off, but I did not include that in the total for my review. We were all stuffed and 4 of us have plenty of leftovers for lunch tomorrow.  Ambiance: Like I said, quirky, but pleasant. It's set in with a bunch of office/industrial park kinds of places and it's on the 2nd floor (there is an elevator and ramps outside, so it's accessible). The table settings are semi-formal, seats in the booths are comfy, there are colorful lights set into the ceiling by the bar, the walls are full windows, some facing the airport (you can watch planes take off) and some facing the strip (lots of lights, which is fun), a small spot for live music, multiple TVs on and muted (some on Indian channels, some on the hockey game), and it's attached to a hookah bar (totally separate area, so you don't smell the smoke or even see the hookahs from the restaurant - I walked through, though, and it has a very relaxing vibe with another wall of windows - if I smoked a hookah, I would enjoy that space). The musician that they had playing, Miko, sounded great, was very nice, and played jazzy versions of a wide variety of pop type tunes. He didn't take a break for the whole 2 hours we sat there, so I definitely tipped him, too.  The final judgment: We will be back. I enjoyed the experience.",

The manager refused to accept my groupon for the value I paid for (my 2 for 1 offer had expired, and I wasn't asking for them to give me the promotional value, just what I paid for). I brought a group of 10 people and when I requested to use my groupon the manager refused, told me they would \"lose money\" and that I had to deal with groupon to get my money back. Regardless,  this is not the way to treat a frequent customer, specially when she brings you 9 more clients who had never tried the place before.  We eat out as a group frequently, next time, I will recommend a pkace where customers are actually valued.  What a shame!",

    "text": "I haven't written a review in a while, but after discovering what is THE BEST Indian food in Las Vegas, I had to speak up.  Pure Indian Cuisine on Sunset is definitely a hidden gem with an amazing view!  Pure is on the second floor of the building, directly above Kabob and across from the McCarran airplane viewing lot on Sunset.  I was taken back to my youth, when my parents would bring us to a restaurant called the Flight Line that also overlooked McCarran's runways...couldn't tell you a thing about their food, but watching the planes come in and out really stuck in my mind.  Pure on the other hand actually made me forget about the planes and focus on the amazing scents of Indian spices wafting through the restaurant and the pleasant anticipation rumbling through my stomach.  Rohani, our server, welcomed us warmly and seated us near the windows overlooking the East/West runway along Sunset.  He started us off with Indian beer, Taj Mahal & Flying Horse, both very tasty lagers and a great way to cool off the curry!  Rohani suggested the Lasoni Gobi as an appetizer (sauteed cauliflower) which didn't sound all that earth shattering, but when it arrived and the munching began, three words came to mind...Ah May Zing!!!  It will be very difficult for us to try another appetizer the next time we go, as we won't want to miss out on this wonderful dish!  We went with Lamb and Chicken curry along with Muteer Paneer and the garlic nan bread.  My nose thought it had died and gone to heaven when every thing arrived!  The presentation was very nice and I can't say enough about how savory and unique the flavors of each dish were.  The lamb was tender and juicy with the curry providing a tasty backdrop with a multitude of flavors that never outperformed the star of the dish.  The chicken curry was also up to the task and I literally had to stop myself from licking the bowl of the Paneer!  The nan bread was crispy on the outside and tender on the inside and bursting with flavor.  Needless to say, we didn't have any left-overs to bring home, which sort of sucks now since writing this has got me seriously jonesing for more!  I see many more trips to Pure in our future.",

Add in the warm, friendly, attentive service, the excellent view of the airplanes taking off across the street with the backdrop of the world famous Las Vegas Strip, the comfortable modern decor, the TV screens showing Indian music videos, and I am absolutely charmed.  This review is for the $10.99 weekday lunch buffet. They have those classic Indian buffet dishes you expect to see - tandoori chicken, channa masala, saag paneer, etc, but they also intrigued me with a few items I was not already familiar with. I tried the goat curry, as well as a couple of other interesting and tasty dishes that I was unfortunately too lazy to note the names of. The goat was surprisingly tender and delicious. While I personally did not care for the flavor of the curry it was in, my husband greatly enjoyed it.  The other dishes I tried were all superb. Rich, distinctive flavors, and just the right amount of heat. The garlic naan that was brought directly to our table was light and crisp. The rice was fragrant and perfectly cooked.  Dessert round: They had a mango custard dish that was just so lovely. I could have eaten that all day. It had chunks of fruit in it, including papaya, and the custard was so light and refreshing. The Gulab Jamun were scorchingly hot, which, of course, is when they taste the very best, imo. The fresh fruit on the buffet (watermelon, honeydew, and orange slices) was all ripe and sweet.  All in all, a delightful meal!",

There was a large family there that kept cutting in and out of the line like it didn't matter at all so it was chaotic, coming up for seconds etc. so that lessened the experience. The food was pretty decent. I would try it again but prefer not to deal with a similar experience in the line for the buffet. The cost was $11.99 + tax so it came to $12.97 for lunch at about 1pm.",

Tandoori Chicken could b better, but the masala and cooking level was good. Biryani was not the typical biryani-rather it was a mixed blend of Tomatoes, Onions along with Meat/Seafood. Lots of colors and it tasted like a Spicy curry mixed with steamed rice. Don't order Biryani if you like to have a taste of typical Dum Biryani. Not a good choice. Garlic Naan were fresh and soft. Punjabi Chicken was hot and spicy.  Overall a good place to rely and eat on.",

    "text": "You take the good. You take the bad. You take them both and there you have my mixed impressions of Pure Indian Cuisine. Only the bad isn't really bad. Simply a matter of my expectations being inaccurate.  I found a Groupon offer for Pure Indian Cuisine and saw that my Yelp friends had given it good reviews. So of course I had to try it. My Groupon offer was valued at $30 so I had to get a few items from the menu. Darn the luck. I tend to plan my adventures out so I knew going in what I wanted to try. I diverted from my path slightly.   To start, I was brought the customary papadum and sauces. This was some of the best papadum I've had and the sauces were very herbacious and HOT. Well, not overwhelming but they woke up my taste buds.  On to my order, I knew for sure I wanted to try the homemade Indian tea, vegetable samosas and garlic naan. The tea and samosas came out first. I was expecting a hot tea. This was not hot. Nor was a iced. I suppose tepid is the right word. A tea with cardamom and milk. It was fine just not what I had in mind when I ordered. I was offered a refill but I declined. It wasn't necessary. The samosas were pleasing to the eye. A good size and crisp. Lets not forget hot and fresh too. The potato and pea filling was on the dry side so I spooned some of the leftover papadum sauce onto them. The naan came out with my meal.  For my entree I ordered chicken korma. I changed my mind from chicken jalfrezi which was a departure from the Punjabi chicken I orginally wanted. Either way I was getting something I had not tried before. The korma was a perfect choice. Indian food has such remarkable depth of flavor which is why I love it so very much. This was no exception. The sauce was rich and creamy with a subtle hint of nuttiness from the cashews. It was so soothing. And the chicken was tender. Of course I had to spoon it over the rice which on its own was stellar. Some of the best rice I've had any where regardless of cultural origin. Long grains of seasoned rice that I could make a meal of by itself. Finally the naan. I ordered garlic naan and there was no small amount of garlic on it. It was loaded. The bread thinner than I am used to. And more charred to crispy. Perhaps more authentic than the chewy pizza crust style I usually get. It was different but good in its own right.  At the end of the evening I spent $28 of the $30 voucher I had. Not bad. Plus I brought home some leftovers for lunch. Score. I got to see the planes taking off and landing. And I was called \"dah-ling\" by my waitress with the ever so slight New York accent. All in all it was pretty good meal that left me full and content.",

Found this place on Yelp with good reviews and I thought it's a nice location away from the strip. The view of the airport and strip in the background is beautiful, our server Mani was great and the food was delicious. I have a friends from India who have spoiled me with authentic dishes, so I've been dissatisfied with most restaurants I've been to where the dishes are too salty for my taste. Indian food can be, but I don't eat a lot of salty foods. This place seasoned their dishes perfectly. Not greasy or salty.  I ordered the dishes I love for Michelle to try: Navaratan Korma (creamy veggie cashew dish), Palak Paneer (spinach and Indian cheese), dishes came with basmati rice and we ordered two types of naan - garlic and a naturally sweet one (forgot the name) with figs and nuts.    When we were seated, we were immediately served with water, asked for drink order and server returned with a complimentary variety  of chutney and Indian 'crisps' like chips (forgot the name for it!).  Finished off dinner with traditional Masala Chai. It was Michelle's first time trying authentic chai. She loved it as I do.  We were satisfied with our vegetarian dinner. No bloating from salty Indian cuisine is a plus. Will come back again to try their lunch buffet and other menu items!   In addition, they have live dinner music - Mr Montgomery played some smooth jazz reggae fusion that night.  They also have hookah at 7pm in another room.",

    "text": "My fiance ordered from this place using door dash so I'll only talk about the food since we weren't at the actual place.  We got an order of \"lamb rogan josh\" which contained lamb chunks cooked with yogurt, onions and spices with basmati rice. We had a choice of choosing the spice for our lamb. We chose mild spiciness and it was a good kick. We also originally chose \"chicken tikka naan\" but the person preparing our food got our order wrong and gave us regular naan instead. So to go off on the lamb rogan josh, it tasted very delicious and fresh despite it being delivered to us from a 20 minute drive away. There was enough sauce from the meat to drench into our rice, making it perfect to dip our naan bread into.   Overall, the food was great. We would come back to try everything else on the menu.",

The mango lassi was too good.  The ambiance  wowww! U see flights taking off and landing every half a minute, unstoppable view of the runway. You can have delicious dinner with fabulous view of STRIP The food quality is so fresh and the best part is they have hookah lounge beside the restaurant so you can have hookah as well as food. The best part is they play cricket on big TV and I'm big fan of cricket. Have a big bar you can sit and have beer which is available on tap, watch football if you are a football fan. I wish i can give more stars to this place! Definitely the best food and highly recommended for your friends. Thank you Pure Indian Cuisine  I'm in love with place.  Manni ( Mangager) is soo nice and friendly. He gave us complimentary gulab jamun for me and my friends.",

    "text": "DO NOT GO HERE TRUSTING THEIR YELP RATING!!!  This is one of those places where you wish Yelp let you put down 0 stars. I had the most horrible food and experience of my life here.  We went in around 9 and they are open till late so it wasn't close to closing time etc. We were in the mood for Indian-Chinese so we ordered the fried rice, veg Manchurian, chili chicken. EVERYTHING TASTED LIKE CRAP, I mean how can someone cook so bad at a restaurant. The Manchurian was so awful that we took a bite and had to spit it out. The food was practically inedible.  We thought that maybe Indian-Chinese is not their strong suit so we ordered a portion of chicken Biryani in an attempt to fill our starving tummies. We sat there waiting for 40 mins for our biryani to arrive. When we asked the server who came in to refill our glasses about the status of our order, upon checking he told us that the guy who took our order FORGOT, he conviniently forgot to convey it to the kitchen so nobody was actually making our Biryani. He said he will fix us the biryani in 15 mins. We had no patience and sadly no more appetite after being in that place for over an hour and 15. While walking out the owner asked us about our experience so we told him that the food was no good and half of the order never came. He told us all sorts of crap about how this restaurant is his passion and he would like \"Our People(=Indians)\" to go back very happy from his restaurant and what not. My point is if your passion tastes so shitty, maybe you should take up a new passion and hire better people while you are at it.",

I was craving Indian last night, so after a quick Yelp search, I decided to give Pure Indian Cuisine a try. SO glad I did.  I was alone and went to grab a to-go order, but oh-my-goodness - that view of the strip. If you want to go have a sit down dinner, you HAVE to do it after dark to appreciate what a great view this place offers. Next time I go, I will definitely make time to eat in just to enjoy the scenery. The restaurant itself is nicely and tastefully decorated as well. Whoever I bring there is going to be very impressed, and I'll be the hero.  ;)  Oh yeah, the food.  YUM.  And I'm pretty spoiled having enjoyed great Indian Cuisine from Brick Road in London to Curry Row in NYC, and if what I brought home last night (Coconut Curry Chicken and Saag Paneer) is any indication of what the rest of their menu holds, then color me impressed.  I'm going to have to get back there again soon to find out.... and next time I'll sit and enjoy the view while I dine.",

The lamb biriani melts in your mouth, on a bed of extraordinary rice with cashews and veggies. The butter chicken is so tender i don't know how they did it, with a sauce i could eat every day.

I called GrubHub who called the delivery driver and then The restaurant. The restaurant admitted they didn't send it and would credit me for the missing rice from the 4-5 items. My credit given is $3.24! I guarantee if I ordered 2 sides of rice my total would be more than that. I wouldn't be upset but this is the 2nd time this has happened to me at this establishment and the last time I picked it up myself so it is not a delivery person issue. It is a restaurant issue.  When I spoke with the guy at restaurant he didn't really care.  The  food taste ok which is why I gave 2 stars.

I would like to try all their (vegan) dishes... maybe we try to come to their lunch buffet on the weekdays one of those days, their price is a stealer for now, $11.99 from 11am to 3pm. definitely worth eating here.",

    "text": "Very mixed feelings with this place. Upon entering on a Saturday night, there was a 1 man band playing which was kewl. We were seated and a few minutes later we were greeted by a slender gentleman and asked if we'd like anything to drink so we gave him our drink order and asked for his recommendations since it was our first time and he said everything is good. So I asked if he's eaten here and he said yes, so I asked what is his favorite and he said everything. Not very helpful at all. So me and my friend asked for more time. As soon as he left, the guy performing leaned over and suggested the Chili Chicken. So the guy came back and we ordered the Vegetable platter, Chili Chicken, Shrimp Tandoori, and Garlic Naan. About 5 minutes later another guy comes by and asked to take our order so we asked him what he recommended and he said the Chicken Tikka Masala so we asked him to change out the shrimp dish for the masala.  He was able to do that. The platter wasn't that bad, it came with various options. The main dishes were another story. Both recommendations were more than satisfying. They were packed with so many flavors that all worked well together. The garlic naan was soo good and if you dipped it into the masala sauce it was more delish.    When it came time to pay, we gave them a gift certificate for $100 but our bill was only $60. They took the gift certificate which was won at an FBI fundraiser and came back and said they can't accept it because someone had wrote in the restaurants info and their GC are different. They claimed anyone could come in and just write it. First it came from the FBI? Second what the restaurant didn't disclose themselves but we found out after some research was that the restaurant changed ownership in the past year. The manager didn't even come out to talk to us and explain. We had to ask the server what the problem was and lastly, it makes us the clientele feel like you're accusing us of scamming the place or lying. So after that interaction, that left a bad taste in my mouth.",

I must have ordered 4 things off the menu and they kept coming back and saying they were out, with 10 to 20 minute breaks inbetween each time. So, after waiting all this time and being out of everything we finally left without having dinner. For this adventure we sat in the Hookah Lounge portion. Thier hookah was terrible as well. Super harsh.  After dropping one of thier managers off while driving for Uber, she talked me into trying them again. The second time my date and I sat in the restaurant section (same waiter as first time). This time amazing service and delic ous food. Thier Naan is my only complaint, tough and boring. One of the best Aloo Gobi I have ever had.   If I had to rate this place on first experience it would be a 1. If I based it on the second experience 4 to a 5 (I love Naan so it disappoints me) So average rating 3. We will see the next time if I adventure into there.",

The Mulagwatawny soup is excellent and hot (temperature) and very peppery. Which is good for pepper water soup... I loved the lamb korma.   My wife had the Paneer with sauteed onions and she liked it as well, so all in all excellent experience highly recommend it.",

Apart from the location, the buffet was awesome.The mini samosas and the pakodas should be tried with the mint chutney. The butter chicken and the goat curry were good, the chicken biryani was well cooked and I liked the flavour. They give both plain naan and garlic naan (with no extra charge). I was so much full with the Non vegetarian items that I could not try the vegetarian food. My friend loved the vegetarian dishes though. Overall I loved the food here and the five star is for both the food and the view.",

The goat curry was pretty much bones, cartilage or fat.  The dishes that were available were hardly replenished.  I am unsure why this place gets great reviews.  On top of that, they automatically add an 18% gratuity to the bill for mediocre service.",

I like how the restaurant has wide windows to look out of while dining. I got a punch card for 10 buffets get one free so I'll try my hardest to make that happen. I would definitely recommend this place if you're having a hard time finding an Indian lunch buffet. Staff is friendly and considerate. Comfy booths. I will be back.",

    "text": "This is probably the strangest location we have eaten at in Las Vegas so far. It's on the outskirts of the airport, but it makes for an absolutely beautiful second story view of the Las Vegas Strip AND the airstrip! There's extra parking underneath the building if you are having a hard time finding parking that is not reserved, and the restaurant is on the second floor.  They have a really affordable lunch buffet, check their hours! When we arrived for dinner, there was a live musician playing really pleasant, entrancing music. The place has a good ambiance, and the front of the building is all windowed, so like I said, really great view! Get a window seat and go on a date as the sun sets! We were hungry and in need of a place close by, and we were honestly blown away by how amazing the food was here.  The prices are higher than any Indian food we have had in Las Vegas so far, with an average of $18-20 a dish, but it is well worth it.  Everything, and I mean, everything we had was phenomenal.  We ordered a butter chicken, garlic naan, mango chicken curry, and a mango lassi.  Their tamarind and mint chutneys are absolutely delicious.  Maybe the music was putting us into a trance but this food was.. AWESOME.  At the price point this place is at, I'd say save it for a date night! They also have what seems like (almost, possibly- not confirmed) a full bar.  Their menu has a lot of variety, whatever protein you want is probably there and they cook it so well. You can tell just by the smell in the air when you walk in. The smell of Indian food done right is enough to bring any strong person to their knees.  Do yourself a favor and schedule your next date night here, around sunset, with a seat facing or near the window- it's beautiful and the food will taste just as beautiful.",

Pure Indian Cuisine combines two of my favorite things--good Indian food and a view of planes taking off and landing right across Sunset Road.  I came here with two friends yesterday for the lunch buffet.  The price as mentioned in reviews is $10.99 which includes naan.  After we were seated, we just chatted for awhile catching up on  news (OK, gossip) each one of us had to give.  A young woman from the restaurant came by and told us politely that we could go to the buffet anytime we wanted.  She held off ordering naan for us until she saw us go to the buffet.  One of the first things I chose was the papdi chaat.  This is the first Indian buffet that I remember serving any kind of chaat and it was very good!  I also tried the pakora mix, mutter paneer, and navaratan korma.  Everything was very good.  As we were starting, the server brought our garlic naan and it had a great garlic flavor.  For my second plate, I got some butter chicken and more standard Indian fare.  For dessert. I got a small bowl of mango custard and one of of kheer.  Both were delightful.    Service was very good.  Our water was refilled several times.  I need to go back for dinner and try their regular evening menu.  Oh, yes, and I need to see some more planes.  The restaurant is right across from the Sunset Road parking area for McCarran so it's easy to find.",

The view was exceptional, I really enjoyed watching the planes land and lift off.

The restaurant is simple and clean. The dining area is quiet which makes it a nice option for a relaxing lunch.   The lunch buffet is $10.99 which was a great value for the variety and quality of the food. There were plenty of options for carnivores and vegetarians alike. Upon being seated we were offered plain or garlic naan. We ended up trying both and I loved both. The plain might be better if you are using the naan to scoop up sauces. The buffet has all of the fixings for a green salad, several meat entrees, several vegetarian entrees, chutneys, sides, and a dessert option. Everything I tasted was delicious and flavorful.

    "text": "Okay so I've tried a new Indian place every other week here in Las Vegas off and on for about 6 months. Most of them didn't even have buttered chicken or Naan!! This place though, amazing Stuffed Naan with yogurt dip, then the lamb vindaloo was so delicious and spicy( they ask you how hott you want it). I was really amazed how big their menu was so many dishes to try and a really great atmosphere being that this place is on the second floor overlooking the airport. Just for myself I spent about 30 dollars on my meal Naan vindaloo and Taj Mahal beer but they do have a 10 dollar buffet for peeps that don't wanna spend a lot. Bottom line you want some outstanding authentic Indian food without taking a long international flight or dating an Indian girl and service to match GO TO PURE INDIAN CUISINE!!! I will post pictures next visit unfortunately I ate it all too fast okay had lunch and dinner here in the same day dinner butter chicken cheese naan so amazing and served enough for five but I ate it all soooooo good",

We ate there this evening though and the service was horrible. Our waitress was non existent. She never came back after taking our order. A gentlman (not our waitress) brought the food and another gentlman brought our check after we sat for a while. Nobody checked in with us to see how our meal was. The restaurant was not busy at the time (only a couple other tables) so there was no excuse for such terrible service. Our bill was $4.33 after a $30 Groupon. We left a $5 bill and got the heck out of there. There was nobody around to complain to about the service. I hope the restaurant reads this in order to understand why we essentially \"stiffed\" our server (what server?). Perhaps it was an off night. Again though, the food is wonderful.",

    "text": "The low down  Location: easy to get to on Sunset Rd about 5 minutes east of the Strip. The restaurant is on the 2nd floor over looking the McCarran runway. Kind of cool of cool to watch the planes take off and land. As the sun goes down you can get a decent view of the strip. Their signs aren't the most prominent so being able to notice it while driving by may be a little hard. They are directly above a Kabob restaurant.  Ambiance: very clean and and nice looking. kind of open with a lot of windows. We ate there for dinner an got there before sunset. They had shades pulled down on the west side to keep the sun out of our eyes. The only drawback as it started to get dark outside was their light. Although there isn't much they can do without spending a ton of money but they utilized the fluorescent lighting in the ceiling. Most of the fixtures were covered with blue panels but there were a few that weren't. One being right above out table. Which turned out to be bright and obnoxious. They might want to use a warmer type of lighting. There was a man with a keyboard playing live music which was quite pleasant. I'm not sure how often he is there.   Food: we ordered Chicken Saag, Chicken vindaloo , garlic naan and rice. The Naan had a great flavor and slightly thicker than normal. The Vindaloo was awesome. I think I might have ordered it a little too spicy but I was able to handle it. The Saag was the best that both me and my girlfriend had ever had. The naan seemed to be very pillowy and fresh. All in all. Extremely good food.  Update: we went back a few days later because we wanted to try the buffet. All items that I tried were delicious. Especially the Butter Chicken and Palak Paneer. The chicken tandoori was slightly on the dry side but flavor was very good. And there were other delicious items that I don't remember the names.",

Lasuni Gobi was limp and soggy, Samosa Chat was spiked with too much Garam Masala and the dal was watery and without flavor and I dont have much to say about the Paneer and Chicken.   I do have to say we received excellent service. The waitress who was serving us was polite, friendly and attentive. When she noticed the leftovers and food on our plates she got worried and asked after it. She also requested that we dont give a negative feedback on Yelp.

The one criticism I have is that it's a little hard to locate, being on the second floor, next to a hookah lounge, and the signage could be much clearer.  But once we arrived it was wonderful all the way.  The menu is a little overwhelming with so many delicious choices. [Nice problem to have!] I literally could eat here 3 times a week for 6 months and never have the same thing.   I ended up getting the spinach paneer and a lamb curry. Wifey, a picky  vegetarian, got something just as delicious. And she was able to enjoy the paneer, too. I'm carnivorrific, but I could eat Indian  vegetarian forever and be happy.  And THE VIEW! It's really cool being across from the airport on the second floor. I couldn't stop watching the big ol' jet airliners landing and taking off.  Even the ToGo containers are the best, those little Tupperware bins that won't leak on the way home and can be used again and again.  Go to this place!!!! It's great!",

    "text": "Food was amazing. My husband and I started with the Tandoori Fish appetizer. The fish was fluffy and flavorful. It didn't need any sauce, it was awesome by itself. We then ordered Lamb tikka masala(lamb curry), Chicken tikka masala(chicken curry), with Garlic naan(separately). The portions looked small, but it filled us up just right. The food was so amazing we had to end our course with dinner. We ordered the Gulab Jamun (mini donut holes soaked with glaze) and it was amazing. They only give you two donuts, I wished they served more because it was so delicious. We are definitely coming back to show our friends and family.",

The interior of this place had really nice metallic colored wooden floors and the views are a 360 view of the strip as well as the airport.  This is the perfect place to have brunch in the afternoon and a lounge drink at night. The owner, Raj has such great hospitality and they also have live music that was relaxing to my ears.   The Indian spice level for the buffet is perfect but the dessert \"gulab jamun\" was too sweet for my taste. It's a fried dough ball sugared with sugar syrup!   I would love to come back again.",

The restaurant has a great view, quick service and friendly staff. The prices are reasonable for their food and drinks. They have a live performer there usually on the weekends. I like the overall ambiance of the restaurant. We can always count on getting seated right away when we go. And they are open late which is convenient.  Regular orders are: garlic naan bread and vegetarian tikka masala.  4 stars because we have had a few experiences when we order for delivery where the garlic naan bread was burnt and the tikka masala was too oily.",

    "text": "One of the worst Indian restraints I've been to.   We ordered off the menu and did not eat the buffet in hopes of fresher food.   The garlic naan was burnt. The center had been rolled out to thin and was charred to a crisp. No garlic flavor.   The chicken dish we ordered was wrong and had to be sent back. The redo was just as bad.   The vegetable curry was mostly  frozen vegetables tossed in with some fresh bell peppers and onions in a nondescript yellow sauce they called curry.    The basmati rice was over cooked and dry. Normally you get light fluffy long fragrant grains.  We got the opposite. Small broken grains of poor quality overlooked dry rice.   Service was poor. There is no organization. We had three different people trying to take out order which would sound like s good thing. But when you ask one person a question or dietary requests and someone else takes your order it leads to mistakes.   Location: was this an office space before? There is no real entrance to this restaurant. Just a series of hallways and if you figure out the maze you get rewarded with poor quality food.",

Nikita was SUPER NICE!!! Very genuine and knowledgable about the menu.   The food was REALLY good. The \"naan\" bread was amazing  unfortunately, I can't pronounce what the hell I I ordered.

There is a cool belly dancer too who is dancing on Bollywood music. It was great fun with hookah, belly dancer and enjoying Indian food. Four best parts 1) Best food, its fresh and north Indian 2) service is best, all the waiters, manager and hookah waiter are all down to earth and fast in action and to the point. 3) stunning view, you can see Vegas airport from window and see flights landing. 4) Hookah +Belly dancer +Bollywood  I would definitely recommend this place and you will have best time.",

All ordered mild as we're wimps, but the food was excellent. The only odd part of this place is the hostess/server (she provides water, menus, etc) had water in hand, had given us water glasses but still took a good 5 minutes to get water. It was bizarre because she came to the table with the water pitcher, walked away with it, walked around the restaurant with it (filling others' glasses) and finally got to us again. We've been here twice and twice the same server/same issue. Otherwise it's a 5 star place!",

The tikka masala was so flavorful and pretty much made the lunch. The samosas weren't overly greasy, which is usually a problem for me. I also loved the fresh hot garlic naan the waiter brought out to my table.   One of the best things about this spot is the view of the airport. It's so relaxing to watch the planes go by.

I had questions regarding the menu items, which he also took the time to help me with. Being that it's 1:30am and slow (about 6 others here) I think that he working as the host and the server right now. But after helping with my decision he took my order, I ordered spicy basmati fried rice w/ chicken (I can't remember the name of it lol) It was wrapped up very nicely for me when he brought it out and it looked delicious. The flavor was awesome! It was definitely spicy and had big pieces of chicken. I'll definitely be back to experience the full restaurant experience.  Ok. I'm back. Im gon leave that up there  because that's how it started. This is my edit a few bites later...  My mouth on FIYYAA (fire)  I had a choice between mild, medium and spicy. I chose spicy  When Adrian said \"are you sure?\" That was my que to run   I love spicy food. Jerk chicken, spicy curry, etc. But this is a whole nother level of 'stupid spicy', that's what they should call it, Stupid Spicy. I'm still eating it though. But man it's a struggle. My nose, forehead and even the top of my head is sweating, my sinuses have fully cleared up  and my tongue is on FIYYYAA. But it's still good. I'm just going to have to put the rest up and try again tomorrow  Maybe I ate a seed or something",

I have been here twice before and both times the food and experience was better, now understand that it is a weird location and bot very warm or welcoming. This time the food was dull and uninteresting, me and my wife did not finish out plates, the only reason for 2 stars is because of how apologetic the staff was when we told them.  We wont be back.",

Saw that the reviews were pretty good so we decided to check it out.  First, the place is super clean and has an amazing view of both the airport as well as the strip. We are already talking about coming back and timing it to catch the sunset.   The service we had was impeccable! Everyone was great but especially our server Mani who was incredibly attentive to our needs throughout dinner. Very friendly and helpful!  We started with some drinks and samosas. Then we moved on to some tikka masala, vindaloo and garlic naan. Everything was excellent and nice portions which is important to me since I love leftovers!  Prices were very reasonable but an even better deal if you can still score the groupon. Looking forward to coming again soon!to coming",

You sit in the car thinking \"there cannot possibly be an Indian restaurant out here\" ... but you are wrong! There is, and its a good one. Worth the time to drive out to.  Its peaceful too and you can see a great view of the strip out the window on the horizon.  Ate here twice in one week of visiting Vegas. Was consistently good both times. Staff super friendly and open to meal customizations and explanations.  Definitely will visit again if I find myself staying near the strip again.",

We got palak paneer, chana masala, and chicken curry. The food was so-so. Worst of all, we ordered roti with our food. They gave us 4 pieces for $12. That's freaking absurd. I make roti at home and that costs me maybe 50 cents for a DOZEN full rotis. They cut one roti into 4 pieces and charge freaking $12!! Ridiculous. When we contacted them to tell them we were missing roti, they told us they would give us a credit- but took no name, number or order reference. Buyer Beware! There are MUCH MUCH better places for Indian food. The Kabob place downstairs from the Pure is a great deal with much better tasting food. I'm sorry, but I can't say under any circumstance will I every be going back.",

While I've had better (and more expensive) Indian cuisine, Pure Indian punches above it's weight. I'm disappointed by reviewers complaining about the food selection. The lunch buffet features all the staple dishes, pakodas, rice, tandoori chicken, daal or lentil soup, vegetable masala, crisp garlic naan, etc.   I've been hosted by several Indian families over the years. Dishes like chicken tikka masala are put out to appease an American palette. I stick to the core menu. It's delicious and satisfying. I could easily eat here everyday without getting bored.  The panoramic views of the airport are a bonus. I come here for the food.",

We showed up at 12, in my opinion what should be height of lunch, and expected the freshest hottest food, sadly we were disappointed. The food was good amazingly flavorful and everything, but it was not hot, not cold either just warm. The tandoori chicken was dry as though it was reheated from the day before. I also didn't care for the lamb. Being that I'm not completely familiar with all Indian food I rely on the labels. There were some, but not enough and asking the staff didn't help because the person I got was less then capable of communicating clearly.  All that being said I have gone for dinner and had hot delicious amazing food. The chili chicken is wonderful. As well as paneer tiki masala and samosa chaat, vegetable pakor. I didn't care for their bhurtha bharta but it wasn't bad.  have so many things I still want to try!!",

Sadly I feel while the food is not bad by any means,  the evolved flavor profiles have been lost while the amount of salt has increased.   In addition some items were just bad,  like the veggie pakora  was more chewy and dense than crispy.   It's a shame, and I hope they make the changes needed to have the same quality they offered when first opening.",

We had butter chicken, palak paneer and lamb josh rogan.  All were gourmet level, savory and delicious.  The garlic nan just melted in our mouths!   In addition to the exciting views of the Strip and the McCarran landing runway, they have also added a musician on the weekend playing soothing, dinner conversation-appropriate, contemporary tunes.  Service was excellent and the management very caring.  Mani is best.If you haven't tried Pure India, you're not enjoying the best in Las Vegas Indian cuisine!",

    "text": "Honestly I don't understand all the glowing reviews. It's an Indian restaurant  in the airport district with an unappealing second floor entry, sitting alongside hookah up bars and low end restaurants. That was a warning sign but I thought Vegas reviewers know their secret places. Not the case.   As far as the food goes, you could do much better in a run-of-the-mill Indian buffet restaurant than this place. I was there for dinner, and prices for basic vegetarian entrees run well over what I would pay in high-end places in DC metro area.  The samosa chickpeas had cheap oil fried samosas and canned chickpeas with powdered spice.  The naan disappointed with its low end flour.  The potato cumin had burnt cumin seeds taste. The dal makhani had honestly been cooked for half a day it seemed.  Maybe this is appealing to first timers and folks not too familiar with Indian food.  But anyone who has tried mainstream Indian or cooks at home and understands fresh, whole spice taste of any cuisine would know better.   The waiter was a good natured guy. I wouldn't ding the service. Nothing out of the ordinary.   The lighting was off with a stark tube light shining above and two endless looped Indian entertainment of second rate Bollywood.  But even novices know decent ambiance. This place disappointed.   I'll venture out to say many of the reviews may be gamed.  It was a sad start to a spring break in NV/AZ.",

The outside was crisp and fluffy but not to greasy and the inside was warm and delicious.  Would certainly order these again.  Not to mention it paired perfectly with the Indian Beer the host recommended (Taj Mahal).  For the main course we went with butter chicken along with some Garlic and Cheese nan.  Spice level we chose was a level 8.  I would probably do a level 6 next time, but it still had excellent flavor.  The thick and rich curry was everything we were hoping it would be.  Certainly the best butter chicken that I have had in Las Vegas to date.  The Nan was also great.  My girlfriends cheese nan - which was quickly nick-named the nan-adilla - had cheese stuffed in the inside of the nan which offered a very refreshing twist in the midst of the spicy curry.  To top the evening off, I have to mention the view.  You have a spectacular view of the Las Vegas Strip, the Beautiful mountains, and if your a nerd like me, front row seats to all the jets flying in and out of McCareen international.  It was pretty great all around.  Will certainly be back. Had a great time and looking forward to returning soon!  Their lunch buffet is going to be our next visit, and we will most certainly be coming hungry :).",

    "text": "Decided to go give a local business some support as I yearn for a curry every once in a while. We don't eat out that much. We did a groupon. Found the place fairly easily but when you get there, there are a couple of businesses on the lower floor. The entrance is on the side of the building and you have to go upstairs so a little odd. The decor is kind upbeat almost night-clubby feel. Definitely not the  traditional Indian curry house set up. Still the spices wafting through the air made us hungry and it wasn't long before our order hit the table. The place was not busy at all.  The waiter was friendly and attentive. The view was great as you could watch planes coming in to land at the airport. The meal was good although on the smaller portion side. We enjoyed it all overall and will go back for another shot unless we decide to try somewhere else. Got to spread the love!",

As far as the food goes, some of the best Indian I've ever had. Samosas were as expected, but the chutney was pleasantly spicier than elsewhere. I love Tikka Masala and lamb dishes. So when I saw Lamb Tikka Masala, it was a no brainer. Astounding! Medium heat ended up being VERY tame, just the right amount of salt, good amount of meat. Friend got Rogan Josh, which was also fantastic. Garlic naan was flavorful but not overpowering. A single order of it was very generous. One way I always judge Indian restaurants, is their \"water service\". My cup never got below halfway before it was refilled and they didn't waste my time with ice (though they would if you asked).  I wish I could have eaten there twice in a row. For myself, This will become a must visit place when in Vegas.",

We are North Indians and we quite frequently try out different Indian restaurants. We can easily say the food here was amongst the best we have ever eaten in the U.S. The aloo gobi reminded us of the fare you would enjoy in Delhi dhabas! The staff was courteous and the view of the airport as well as the Vegas strip were like cherry on the top! For the location and the food, the price was appropriate (and they did not charge extra for onions lemons and chillies on the side like a lot of posh restaurants do!). Do give this a try if you are craving good Indian food in Vegas!  PS: we missed our flight this morning, so we are going back here for lunch before the next flight :D",

Some places in town will straight out tell you that they don't let you sit after a certain time.   Delicious food, amazing services, reasonably priced and on top of it all one of the best backdrops of Vegas. You can watch planes land and have the view of the mountains and the strip! What more could ya ask for.   Oh yeah, I know! Hope they decide to sell fixed dinner on New Year's Eve so everyone who dines there can watch the fireworks from their dinner table!",

It was a good experience . You get to see flights land at the airport across the strip while you eat .   I ordered the chicken vindaloo and lassi which was well prepared. I didn't realize that  the curry actually comes with complimentary rice and hence ended up ordering more naan's than necessary.  Over the week, I visited during the lunch hour as well and tried the buffet . The variety was great with a choice of north and South Indian food items.   It definitely seemed to be busy with teams from a number of offices seeming to come in for the lunch buffet.",

The Butter Chicken,  The Chicken Tandoori, The Garlic Nan. You also get a choice of beverage, I just get the refillable soda.  If you come at any other time, Ordering a la carte is even better than buffet sometimes but you have to know what is what.  You can't be an Indian Foodie Newb because once you get it, you're committed. They don't sell combination things or whatever,  you pick the stew with the \"Indian protein\" of your choice and you better like it.  There are no photos, so ask ask ask, because a vindaloo, a korma, a curry and a Tikki masala are worlds apart.   If you've had indian food and like it, this place makes good food. If you've never tried indian food before, it might not be for you but that doesn't mean this place didn't make it right.",

    "text": "Best Indian Food in Town!!!   Whether you're a local or visiting from out of town and craving Indian food, Pure Indian is the place to go.  We usually go to their lunch buffets.  You get to try a variety of items and the views are pretty spectacular too.  You see the strip and the airport right outside the window.  I can't even tell you what is the best item to try because they are all amazing.  My favorites are Saag paneer, Daal, and aloo gobi.  My husband loves the butter chicken.  They bring out hot fresh naan that is delicious and soft.  I have yet to be disappointed.  I would also like to say if you're ever in need to throw a party, celebration dinner etc.  Manny (manager) will help you out! He was our man.  He helped us get together a menu, organize and execute an awesome party for our 4 year old.  Their staff was on point and very helpful.  Thank you Manny and Pure Indian staff for always exceeding our expectations!",

This was my first time trying Indian cuisine and i assure you it won't be the last. If you ever plan to visit this place, you must try the Aloo Tikki, Vegetable pakora for appetizers and for the entre, order the Navaratan Korma. It's so good you will melt In your seat. Oh and be sure to let them know that you want it mild (unless you have a high tolerance for spicy food) I don't so getting the mild was perfect for me.  As if the ambience itself wasn't enough, you look outside and there is the beautiful strip with airplanes zipping across on the runway.   Just as we were departing, a woman joined the band and started singing in one of the most beautiful voices I've heard in a while. Come here to relax and eat like a king.   The best part about this whole experience is that it's only about 10 minutes from me. So I will definitely return.",

I ordered chicken curry,  butter chicken and tandoori chicken along with 2 orders of garlic naan.  My favorite  was the butter chicken.   The best i have ever eaten.  Even better than what i make.  The food was packaged nicely and still hot and fresh.  There were two complaints.   My son said I should have ordered more naan and the dishes were too small for the price.  For the items and tax, delivery, total was over $60.00.   I agree but I also realize that you pay for convenience and we were being lazy today.  There wasn't one bite of anything remaining.

    "text": "Well-recommended.   This venue is easy to overlook; I've driven past it a hundred times ... and eventually became curious about it. It's directly across the street from the McCarran viewing area on Sunset Road, up in the second floor of a two-story building. (Down on the first floor is a restaurant named Kabob.) All the parking out front is marked \"Kabob only.\" So I swung around to the back of the building, into the underground parking area. There's an elevator in there that shoots right up to this restaurant on the second floor.  The space is nicely appointed, with a bar section at back and a separate hookah area facing west. But the star of the show here is the view. Pure-five-star, that is. Huge windows, on three sides. Not only the close-up look-see of all the landings and take-offs at McCarran, but, at a distance, an entirely unobstructed view of the length of the Strip ... and, better yet, an entirely unobstructed 270-degree view of all the gorgeous mountains that surround our Valley.   There's a $12 AYCE Indian lunch buffet until 3pm, with many of the usual suspects on display. I don't know Indian cuisine very well, but I've certainly dined many Indian lunch buffets and found plenty to like here. I dipped into a bit of everything (except the Tandoori Chicken). There was Butter Chicken (in butter-tomato sauce similar to Tikka Masala) that I especially enjoyed, a chili-fish entree that was spicy indeed, and savory goat curry. And the kheer rice pudding desert, sweet and minty. All thumbs-up yum. The garlic naan was the fluffiest, most generous portion I've ever seen anywhere.   This venue apparently also offers a $15 Saturday/Sunday AYCE brunch deal here as well, that comes with a bit of bubbly. And it appears that it is open very late, some nights until 3am. And there was a sign promoting live music 6pm to 10pm on Friday & Saturday. My entertainment was one of those Indian music video channels ... that are always entertaining over lunch.

    "text": "Me and my boyfriend were craving Indian food, so we decided to come here for a late night dinner after shopping. Checked Yelp for the hours of operation & fortunately enough, they close at 3am. We kinda got lost on which building in the complex it was because it was dark out and the sign they had outside wasn't very visible unless you're really looking for it.   The restaurant is upstairs, where we passed by a hookah lounge (which I believe has the same owner as the restaurant). Came in and was greeted by the staff. The guy let us pick our own table, especially because there was only one other table there at the time.   They provide an appetizer of thin bread with a green and brown dip. I personally preferred the brown one for the crackers/bread. We ordered:  Chicken Tandoori - it's a big \"appetizer\" which we ate as an entree. Try it with the green dip that came with the thin bread appetizer  Chicken Masala - great with rice. All their entrees come with rice. It's $3 more for each extra order of rice.  Both our orders were definitely five stars! They were delicious and full of flavor. The two were plenty for the both of us.   I appreciate the most: the view of the restaurant. I enjoy watching the planes land, so the view was great.Especially at night. There was also live music there and an open bar.  Improvement: it was a little hard communicating with the staff so it caused us to ask so many questions and ask for items every time they came back.",

The food is very tasty and everyone in our group enjoyed it - most of us vegetarians, and were pleased that there were plenty of veggie options along with the non-veg options .  Cons: we were charged 14.99 the first time we visited and 11.99 the 2nd time for the buffet. The one star that I have taken off is only due to the fact that we felt little cheated on being charged extra the first time, when we didn't really want to order any drinks (were not told about the 11.99 option).",

    "text": "OMG! So, so, so good. We continually told each other how amazing each bite tasted. They served Pappadom with mint and mango chutney. We started with Lasoni Gobi, which is butter fried cauliflower in a spicy, tangy sauce. This is our first time trying it. Again so, so amazing. As a new vegetarian, it was a revelation about just how wonderful vegetables can be. Yes, I know it's not the healthiest item I could have chosen, but it was worth it.  Next was the Navaraton Korma. The sauce was different from other Kormas I have tried, but I loved it more with every bite. The veggies were just crisp enough to stand up to the sauce. We ordered garlic Naan and scooping the sauce up with that was a mouthwatering experience. My D/H ordered Mushroom Masala. It was also0 wonderful. For dessert, which we questioned even ordering, we shared a rice pudding. Now, I am not a big fan of rice pudding, but I didn't want to stop eating this one. I did though and pushed it to hubby.  I am aware that this is a gushing review, but the food was seriously that good. The service was wonderful also. They were almost tripping over each other to check in us and take our orders.l There is a nice view of the airport and the decor is simple.   I hate to tell you to try this place because it might make it harder for us to get in, but seriously,  check it out. You won't regret it.",

    "text": "At last, at last, we found amazing Indian food in Vegas. We have tried quite a few places in town and had decent meals but nothing that we ever craved so badly that we changed all plans to get tikka masala pronto. Until now.  We have a toddler so instead of bringing him to the restaurant and disrupting the meals of other diners, we've ordered take out from here 3 times in the last 3 weeks and I have no plans on stopping. I also can't wait to actually dine here and try some of the seafood dishes.   The chicken and lamb tikka masalas are the best I've ever had. I love ordering raita and having that in between bites of the rich masala dishes.   We've also had the tandoori chicken which was also excellent. The garlic naan is fine, just what we expected. We've also tried the coconut curry chicken dish and it was good but similar to the tikka masala. So I'll stick with the TM and try something different next time. I also saw they have a lunch buffet so we'll be sure to check that out.   We've loved everything we've tried and can't wait till our next Pure Indian meal.  Since we order to-go quite frequently (see toddler above) I also very much appreciate the care they take in preparing the to go orders. Everything is wrapped and sealed to preserve heat and prevent spilling.   We typically spend about $50-$60 for 2 and a 1/2 of us which is an expensive to go order but I'm telling you it's worth it. We should have leftovers but we rarely do because it's that good. Go Now.",

What was a bonus was the hookah place managed by the same peeps!  Food: 4.5 (we were so into the place and music, we couldn't finish everything we ordered) Ambience: 5.5 if I can give Management: 5 Cost: 4.5  Just one of the best places to have gone to at 4.00 in the evening and having the best 4 hours with service throughout!   Going back today just to have more fun if not the same from yesterday!   Thank you guys for being amazing (to the team)!! Cheers",

Since I am here in town on vacation, I decided to pay them a visit! Unfortunately I was completely disappointed. I had drove ridiculously far to only get turn away. They said the Groupons couldn't be applied to lunch. The waiter said \"there is a sign on the door\" which doesn't even justify why it still couldn't be applied to lunch. The sign said \"no coupons allowed this week\". Pissed, I walked out and re-read the terms on the Groupon deal. However, there was no statement or terms that declared lunch wasn't an option. Never will return back. I don't appreciate taking the time out of my day to head out and only get turned away rudely.",

I have been struggling since getting back from India to find authentic Indian food with lots of flavor and spice that isn't watered down or full of butter, tomato or cream as filler.  Everything was super flavorful, even the white rice had whole peppercorn and coriander in it... they really went the extra mile to make sure that the food was an experience and that each component was flavorful.  Just be mindful that's what you're getting, lots of flavor and lots of spice... so if you're used to bland, creamy, mild, weak stuff, it's not going to be for you....",

Love love the food at this place. There is a reason why this place gets a 4 star and I want all yelpers to make a mental note of the fact that not to visit it between 2:30 to 3:30. Around this time the restaurant staff is just don't with their buffet and are busy cleaning/winding up that to start Ala carte. They wouldn't tell you this but you would be impacted directly as your food would take a good 45-60 mins to come. Even the waiter wouldn't come to take your order for 15-20 mins. I get that they might be busy after a busy morning but then shut the restaurant down for couple of hours to clean up. So all you yelpers I don't want you to miss on the awesome food but just take into account the timing before you visit.  In terms of food this place does take spice levels seriously so when you choose 8/10 in spice level it is good spicy. We ordered paneer karhai, dal tadka, mango lassi and garlic naan. Portions were pretty generous for just the two of us so I would recommend only getting either the curry or dal if you are not that hungry(of course assuming you are a party of 2 or less). They serve complimentary papdam with two chutneys too. Food was really authentic and delicious. It seemed a little pricey but I am willing to pay more for good quality food. Even the basmati rice which comes with the curry seemed good in taste and flavorful. Definitely would recommend this place to anyone who is in Vegas and craving for Indian food!",

Curries, rice dishes, vegetarian and vegan dishes, and copious amounts of spice are associated with this type of food -- and not surprisingly, Las Vegas has multiple Indian restaurants in town, testifying to its great popularity. Pure Indian Cuisine is one of those restaurants, with the added bonus of boasting a great view of the Las Vegas Strip and McCarran Airport due to its Sunset Road location.  As it is close to my workplace, Pure is one of my go-to places for lunch when work is slow -- though I haven't gone often as of late due to being both overly busy and not being in the mood for spicy food when it's already oppressively hot outside. This visit was a result of my Indian food craving winning out over the weather, LOL.  Though I was seated in the middle of the restaurant, the dining room is open enough that you can get a good view of the Strip and McCarran Airport from anywhere you're seated -- of course, the window seats are prized for a reason!  When it comes to the food, the restaurant has the usual selection of curries, rice dishes, and vegetarian options -- however, to my pleased surprise, they had both butter chicken and dal makhani available among the offerings! So of course I got plenty of both dishes; spicy, flavorful, and very decadent, both these dishes ( chicken and lentils, respectively ) are among my favorite Indian foods for a reason. However, they also had plenty of other go-to options like tandoori chicken, salads and dosa that ensure you'll be coming back for more!  Of course, I had to be cognizant enough after lunch to be able to stay awake at work, so I ate less than usual -- which isn't that much of a difference considering how rich Indian food tends to be. Still, everything I had at Pure was delicious, which is why it is one of my two go-to Indian restaurants in town ( the other to be reviewed in the future ). One could even say it was purely divine-- okay, I'll stop, I know that was bad. But if you're near the area, why not try Pure Indian Cuisine? A world of flavor awaits your taste buds.",

    "text": "So Happy!   Yep, so happy to have tried out this place and I love it.  Having been to India several times, and enjoying also Indian food in other places of the world, I have to say that I really enjoyed Pure Indian Cuisine.  1. Location - What an odd location, on top of a two story building where all the parking is reserved for the Kabob restaurant downstairs.  Good news, you can park in the basement and take the elevator right up to the second floor to the restaurant.  2. The View - It is still odd when you are on the second floor and you first see the Hookah Lounge.  But once you go down a small hallway, you get to Pure and then you are rewarded by the most wonderful simple view of Las Vegas and the runway of the airport.  It is simple, cool and fun just to check out the view and the plans landing!  3. Ambiance - Night and day, they have done a great job with this place.  Most seats have a great view and there are plenty of seats for a cozy party of 2 or 4 or they can string together a table for more!  4.  Service - Top notch!  I have enjoyed the service by them.  Nice recommendations and they can customize dishes for you.  5. The Food - While I love Indian food, I am 100% not an expert. I cannot tell you about all the curry's or the spices and I cannot remember all the types, but I can tell you when I am craving comfort food, Indian food is one of my go-to dishes when I am traveling!  Based on several visits, here is a sampling of what we tried.  Everything is sharable!  Pappadam- First out they always serve you some Pappadam with some Chutney.  Fresh, hot and crispy, a nice way to start the meal and to nibble on this thin bread/cracker.  Garlic Naan - We have ordered always the garlic naan bread to accompany our meal. Nothing like some nice naan to soak up the sauces.  They have regular naan, garlic naan and about a dozen or so other types of naan.  I like my naan plain or garlic since I am using it with my main dishes and the other selections they have are stuffed with many other lovely things.  Veggie Dishes - Have tried the Channa Masala ( Chickpeas), the Aloo Gobi (Potatoes and Cauliflower), Hyderabadi Vegetable Curry (Mixed Veggies) and the Bhindi Masala( Chrispy fried Okra).  My hands down favorite what the Hyderabadi and first time every to try it. The waiter recommended it for my daughter who is vegan and she loved it.  All the dishes were tasty by the way. The Bhindi has a crispy texture and perhaps while all the other dishes were empty, there was a bit of the Okra left...  Chicken - Who doesn't like chicken.  We love it, but we can't take the heat, so we have tried over time several.  The Chicken Korma, in a nice creamy mild curry sauce was good. So was the Chicken Tikka Masala, yes, I did have to try what is basically now a British National Dish, chicken in a nice red creamy sauce.  I still wonder if this was invented in India or in England??? We also have had the Tandoori Chicken, 8 big pieces of perfectly tender baked chicken and just a perfect blend of moist and spicy morsels of goodness.  Baaaaa- Yep, we had some Lamb and Goat.  For the Lamb, we had the Lamb Rogan Josh, a wonderful red curry with boneless bits of lamb.  Obviously, I needed some meat on the bone, so I also ordered the Goat Karahi,  I never had the Karahi style before, but the waiter recommended it.  I have ordered it now three times, or every time we have been here!  Bone in pieces of goat meat cooked in a tomato onion blend of mouthwatering and bone gnawing joy.  Beer, wine and everything for your thirst quenching needs.  They have quite the bar, so you should be pleased.  Note, I did not use a menu for this, just a glass of red or a bud light...  GK says, check this place out. I think you will like it a lot!",

I was dining alone on a Saturday evening. He never asked if I wanted something other than water to drink. I ordered vegetable samosa, dal soup, garlic naan and goat vindaloo. The samosas were a little greasy but tasty. The dal soup tasted watered down like someone was trying to stretch the pot. The naan and vindaloo were amazing. It was too bad that my server disappeared and I had to wait for more than 20 minutes for a togo box and my check which was brought to me by another server. Once I ordered, I never saw my original server again. Strange if you ask me.",

Had to keep asking for things over and over that they had forgotten. It wasn't incredibly busy either.  The winners were the lamb keema naan (stuffed ground lamb inside the bread) and the paneer tikka masala.  The rest was just 'okay' and heard they have a lunch buffet that is only $12 per person and on the weekends they have a brunch.  Would love to come back and sample different items. Hope they can work on their service as it was painful.",

This hidden gem is upstairs from a Kabob place and next to a hookah lounge in what feels like a business park. The best part is, they're open until 3am.   I've only been here a couple times but the service has always been great. The tables and booths are very clean and comfortable and the view is amazing.   The food is also great - we wanted a gobi manchurian (basically general tso's sauce on deep fried cauliflower) but they only have a vegetable manchurian on the menu. The chef was nice enough to accommodate us.   Also ordered the Punjabi Chicken curry - the chicken was so tender and breaks apart so easily on your fork. Full of flavor with a nice thick curry sauce, just the way I like it. Came with some beautiful fragrant rice, freshly made.   The best part - this was at almost 2am. I can't think of anywhere else that you can get quality Indian cuisine at this hour. I'm dying to come back and try the lunch buffet.",

They have plenty of space to be seated and a nice view of the runway to catch plane land or take-off from the table (exciting).   There is a hookah bar adjoining the restaurant which plays loud music and shares a door that open in the restaurant. A big turn-off was the music playing in the restaurant or adjoining hookah bar. The restaurant was loud may be due to dance and music in the adjoining bar. At the time of my visit post-midnight the doors between the two were kept open and not just the music the smell of hookah was also free flowing. If I wanted to enjoy loud music or hookah smell, I wouldn't be visiting the restaurant for a peaceful dining experience.  It would be best if they keep the door between the bar and the restaurant closed. Also play a soft music in the restaurant than a loud one.  Their food is to the point and delicious. Rest assured, for better north Indian flavors, visit them and you won't be disappointed.",

Our waitress Nikita was amazing and her service was on point. The food is cheaply priced, but the quality is amazing. We began with the pakora and the samosa chat and they were delicious. The garlic cheese naan was just perfect. For the main course we had a lamb dish and a birayani rice with shirt and it was probably the best I've had here in Vegas. I definitely recommend this place and will be coming back soon. Thank you Nikita for being extremely attentive.",

We love the view of the planes taking off and landing from the big picture windows, but most of all we love the service!  Manny is a excellent manager and server, keeping a tight ship running and always having the time to make all the guests feel like the family.

The chilly chicken was smothered with tomato ketchup making it terribly tangy. The garlic naan was soft but again had no taste of garlic to it.

The service was a little slow but the employees were attentive when they were bringing your items to you.  The food was delicious.  I must say as someone that frequently has stomach issues eating unfamiliar food, their food did not do that to me at all so that is a huge plus!  I had something that was curry as I usually in an Indian restaurant. My husband had a smoothie like beverage and said it was very good.   As someone with an avid interest in aviation, being located with an end to end view of the Las Vegas airport's runway was a great treat as I was watching it during the meal. The restaurant is located adjacent to a hookah lounge and parking is limited and we had to go underground into the parking for the building which is similar to an office building.  We plan to return on a future visit so that may be the best sign of it being a good place to check out.",

Easily the best Mixed Vegetable Curry I've had in a very long time - colorful and tender ingredients with a refreshing made-to-order vibe. So good! Palak Paneer was savory and delicious, as was the Dal Tadka. I got every dish 7/10 on the hot (spice) scale. I could've done 5 or 6 and it still would've been sufficiently spicy. Dinner portions are generous, which is nice because you *will* want leftovers.  Looking forward to trying the lunch buffet before/after my next mid-day flight at McCarran.  Mint and Mt. Everest have some serious competition in Pure! For the last couple of years, I've been declaring Mint as the best Indian in the city, now I'm definitely not so sure. Pure could very well be the hands down best in town!",

They put the menu up on their Facebook page so you know what they're serving that day before you show up.   The view of the airport and strip is gorgeous and they sometimes have live music that's pretty decent!   Their butter chicken is amazing and garlic naan is to die for!

    "text": "I went here for lunch today and all I gotta say if that it was bomb!!!  So why the 4 stars? I minused one because the ladies bathroom was in very sad shape. There were 3 stalls and all three were filthy and no toilet paper....:(  Now onto the nitty gritty....:)  Ambiance was very nice. The restaurant was clean and the tables were set up nicely and the view of the planes taking off and landing was great. The only drawback is the location. The entrance for the restaurant is on the side of the building and the restaurant is upstairs.  There really are no signs pointing to where the restaurant is located. So as soon as u enter.... U see a small lobby with stairs to your left right next to an elevator. But no signs as to if the restaurant is upstairs. Go upstairs!! :). When u go upstairs u will see some red signs saying restaurant and lounge and for the life of me I can't remember the third sign....:( follow the hallway under the red restaurant sign and u will start to smell the deliciousness!!! Follow your nose!! :) (4/5)   Service was impeccable! There was only one large table of 6 ppl when I entered. I was told that I could sit wherever I wanted so I chose a booth and I was served with water and iced tea and mango lassi which were the drinks that I ordered. :) the ice tea and water were your run of the mill.... But mango lassi was delicious! Perfectly creamy with just a hint of the yogurt and just perfect for putting out some of the heat from the dishes. My water glass/tea were constantly filled and they came and touched my table constantly to make sure I was good. (5/5)  Food.... They had a great selection of sauces.... I'm normally not big onto the sauces but I saw a green sauce that reminded me of this salsa Verde I had back home in Texas... Of course it did not taste like what I remembered but the green sauce was delicious nonetheless! It had chilis, mint and cumin I think.... All I can say was that I just wanted to eat it up... So good with the vegetable samosas....I just didn't want to stop. Lol. I skipped some dishes like the rice and the French fries. Why load up on carbs when there were so many other flavorful carbs like naan coming your way.... Puhahaha  The saag paneer was done right. So flavorful and so balanced. It was delicious!!! The chicken tandoori I did not touch as there was a customer there before that kept on going back to the buffet line with a half full dish and that's what he was grabbing and it looked like he had touched the tongs to his plate of half full food.... I couldn't be sure but I wasn't going to touch it. I wished the staff working there would have said something about using a new plate every time. I guess I figured that everyone knew not to bring an old plate but just to grab a new one??? I'm guessing not. :/ I digress.... Back onto the food...  They had salad which I skipped... For obvious reasons as there were more flavorful things waiting for me. :) there was another curry dish with chickpeas in it... Forgot the name but it was good as well. The chilli chicken was very tender and full bodied and delicious. The butter chicken like the name implies was like \"butta\"... Very very tender almost melt in your mouth deliciousness!!  But my all time favorite dish was the coconut potato and to think that I almost passed this one by. The coconut flavor balanced out the curry flavor... It was so creamy and yummy!!  Overall my impression was that they are trying very hard to please and the good speaks for itself. The chef came out of the kitchen to check on the food a couple of times as I was eating there...I appreciate that. :)  Will I be back? Heck yeah!!! :) I can't wait to come back and try the dinner.",

It is situated in a little shopping center on the 2nd floor, on Sunset road. Once seated I couldn't stop looking at the view of Las Vegas as well as the planes land and take off.  The food we ordered are - Pure Indian Mix Grill $21.00-Tandoori chicken, chicken tikka, sheekh kabob and shrimp tandoori. This is good variety to try.  Shrimp Korma $17.00-shrimp soaked in a special almond and saffron sauce. Served with basmati rice. The sauce was indeed special.  Kabuli Naan $4.00-bread stuffed with cashews, pistachios, raisins and dates.   and for drink -mango lassi. The Nan was so tasty and the food were delectable.  The waitress was attentive. There was a live music, musician Milo was good playing some Jazz.  We will be back to try buffet and dinner must be a beautiful view at night.",

The people running the place are very nice and pleasant, but you rarely see them.  It took forever to place our order and then once the food was delivered we never saw them again.  If we had we would have reminded them that we all ordered wine, but not one glass of it ever showed up.  We had to flag them down for some to-go containers.  Then flag them down for the bill. Then flag them down again when we were ready to pay said bill.  The food is awesome, but the service gets a well-earned \"F\".",

Outside near the parking lot is the entrance to a Mediterranean restaurant, but next to that on the side of the building is an entrance with the restaurant name on the window. It's located upstairs next to a hookah lounge  The restaurant is clean and modern. It also has a view of the outskirts of the strip and the airport which was nice.   The food was very tasty. They have a variety of Naan to choose from and my family and I became obsessed with the cheese naan. We also ordered butter chicken, chicken tikka masala, matar paneer, and a lamb dish (I forget the name). Everything was excellent and full of flavor.   Best birthday dinner!",

    "text": "This is a one star because there is a stocky build guy who works the dining room and does not care about food allergies at all.  To him it's nothing more then a big joke.  My wife likes the food here, the few times prior to this visit the food for me was good as well.  Normally we've had one of the female servers who do listen to customer needs and made sure the kitchen made my food properly.  On this visit however, after several dishes were served to include the rice and we started eating, I immediately noticed an issue.  We called the waiter over and asked him if there was cinnamon in the rice and/or anything else?  He said yes.  Really??? Cinnamon in jasmine rice as well as other dishes?  We all looked at him in disbelief stating we told you there was a cinnamon allergy.  His response?  You've been here before for the lunch Buffett, did you eat the rice and other stuff that time?  Really?  You don't deserve to be working here.  Our response...we asked what dishes on the Buffett had cinnamon that day and they took the time to ask the chef.  As I was headed out the door to try and get medicine to counter act the allergy, I noticed the girl staff yelling at him for not checking and taking this seriously.  It was a very rough night that came very close to the ER.  He's lucky he's not facing a law suit, he was just rude and did not care.  My wife says he seemed to feel bad and took 10% off the bill and gave her free desert, really?  My wife likes the food here and it's good for her dietary needs so I will take her back if she so desires however, I will NEVER eat here again as I do not feel I can trust this place to take food allergies seriously.  Luck of the draw on servers does not work for me.",

Ever since I tried Indian food for the first time last month in New York, I have had cravings for this amazing cuisine. I was so worried I would not find a place in Las Vegas. So I asked my friends and read reviews on yelp. I stumbled upon this hidden gem. Mani was  a fantastic server. He helped us pick the items I described from the menu. The view from our table was of the airport runway and quite entertaining.  I can't wait to tell everyone I found the this spot. I am so happy that I found a place that by far exceeded my expectations. These items are a must order...chicken Tikka Masala, Garlic Naan, Dal Makhani, Chicken Tikka, and don't forget the rice pudding. The service was just as good as the food. I no longer have to travel to NY for what is now my favorite cuisine. You won't be disappointed with this place.",

I heard Fleetwood Mac, red hot chili peppers, Chris Isaac, that black velvet song, Eurythmics, Beetles, etc. They play for tips so you can probably make requests.   Good view of airlines landing from this second floor location.  Most Indian places seem to only have waiters, this place has waitresses. So I guess that means they aren't culturally sexist - yay!  Usually on Groupon app so you can save $14 ($30 dinner for $16). So that makes it worth a try if your unsure. Nice booths. Great for date night. Full bar means they can add rum to your mango lassi making it even more awesome.  I've been here twice and both experiences were enjoyable!",

We immediately told the server that it was very spicy and he offered to replace it for a medium offering. 2 minutes later he came with the \"new\" concoction and we soon realized that it was the same dish we had returned and he added some rice to it. Needless to say, my wife did not eat it. It gets worse as the owner came over and asked us how was dinner to which we replied \" not good\". To our amazement he said that he ate our returned dinner himself so he could prove that it was prepared fresh. We saw him sit in the bar area and we specifically saw the waiter take the returned dinner to the kitchen. What a liar! We just wanted to get out of there and told him to charge us. Again, with no customer service skills he charged us for everything including the dinner my wife did not eat. Incredible audacity of a liar! PLEASE DONT GO THIS RESTAURANT.

It is buffet style and they change their dishes daily. I have co-workers come into town regularly and we stop by at least once a week. The staff is extremely friendly and they ask you how the food is and will actually make it more or less spicy! You have a choice of garlic or plain naan. Very fresh and delicious! They raised prices recently :( It was $9.99 an now I believe it is $11.99 per person. However, not enough of an increase to keep me from visiting. Since most visitors I bring are on business, we need separate checks. They are happy to help. I like this because some restaurants really give you attitude for separate checks.

My grandmother tasted the tandoori chicken and she said that it was just as moist and delicious as it looked. It's a little hard to find but the view of McCarran runway is beautiful! Pure is 10X better than the buffet I usually go to and even though it's a nearly 40 min. Drive from my house I'll make it a point to frequent here more often, especially when I'm in the area!",

The first person who came to take the order was staring at us as if \"why are you guys even here\". We were around six folks and since we just ordered snacks and light dinner I suppose the number of items were few and he was not pleased with it. The service just got worser from there, they never came near the table when we needed something and since it was evening the sun was shining right on our faces and the guys didn't care. They just stood far off near the kitchen and it was difficult to get some attention and close the window curtains.   To top that when we ordered tea they brought cold tea whereas the item was supposed to be hot Indian tea. Again we had to get their attention and the get the tea re heated which took like 10 minutes, one of us just drank the cold tea not bearing to wait to get their attention ( we had order 2 tea and both were cold).  The rest of the food items were good for which I would have given a 4 star but the service was just horrible.  And the really worst part was they added an automatic gratuity of 18% when they deserved none.",

We stop into the building with an excellent view of the planes landing and taking off.  We had saag paneer, lamb saag, chicken kimerh and lamb naan.  Hands down the best Indian food we've ever eaten and we're all veterans of punjabi and the depth and balance of spice and heat was superb.  The rice was fragrant and was a perfect foil for the sauces.   We started with pakora and samosas and weren't disappointed at all.  We rounded it off with the BEST kheer I've ever eaten.  Definitely worth visiting again!",

    "text": "Surprising little gem!   Walking into the downstairs of the building, you wouldn't guess what you're going to find in the upstairs. It's kind of shady feeling, and normally I'd have taken one sniff of the lingering cigarette smoke and walked out. However (and thankfully), once we made it upstairs and figured out that it was NOT in the hookah place next door, it was quite a relief to see an airy, clean restaurant space to walk into.   There are big windows where you can watch the planes take off and land while you have your meal, and enjoy the sun (or lights).   The food. Yes, the food. Definitely some of the best we've had in the city, especially for a very reasonable $12.00 lunch buffet.   The salad fare was standard stuff. I wish I'd taken pics of the rest of the buffet, but I was too damn hungry to remember..LOL.   After taking our drink orders, the waitress brought a combination basket of plain and garlic naan to the table, that was obviously right out of the oven. It was thicker/more doughy than I personally prefer, but still very good. I like it thinner so I don't fill up so easily, and also to sop up the sauces better.  The palak paneer and butter chicken were the standouts for us. Perfectly creamy and lots of flavor. The spinach was slightly spicy, just the way it should be.  The vegetable korma was also well flavored and not bland. The chicken tikka was rather dry, but the fresh batch they brought out was just fine.   There were a couple of other chicken dishes that were tasty as well, but my favorite dish hands down was the curried goat. Lots of flavor layers and decent chunks of meat amongst all of the little bones. (why there always are so many in goat meat, I have no idea...I don't recall seeing micro goats with micro bones everywhere..lol). That was really that only purpose for me to have any rice at all on my plate...just so I wouldn't lose that yummy sauce!   Service overall was pleasant. Our water glasses were kept full, though we did have to ask for more naan, and it wasn't busy when we were eating.   The rice pudding was good, nothing unusual though. The mango \"custard\" was very sweet, cloyingly so for me. I'd never had it before, and a woman diner warned me about the sugar and how it was more to be used in small amounts, like a dip . It was not custard like at all in presentation, more like a somewhat thin pudding consistency. Maybe that's standard, I don't know, but just throwing the discrepancy out there.   Anyway, we found the place to be worthy of a review, and we will definitely return once I can risk the million calories again :-)  **UPDATE**:  Upon making a second trip here, I have to say I'm pretty disappointed. The quality of the first visit just wasn't there this time, and so, I'll likely continue going to Mt. Everest instead as they are quite consistent, and very accommodating there. My initial review was 4 stars here, and I've adjusted it down to 3.",

One of their best items is the Chili chicken which is usually a buffet item on Fridays. Buffet items consist of 4 different meat dishes in addition to 6 vegetable type dishes:  Goat curry - standard dish Butter chicken - standard dish Chicken Tandoori - standard dish  Navaratan korma - standard dish Palak paneer - standard dish   Let's talk about dinner, of course it turns into fine dining and is brought out in splendid Indian flavor.  As a repeat customer I've found myself making friends with other repeat customers.  The gang at Pure Indian Cuisine go out of their way to make your visit a memorable one so that you come back and it works. Go visit you'll be glad you did!!!",

All food label in their Indian names, which to me would not help someone who does not know anything about Indian food.  ( am I going to each chick, pig, or moooo.. it's a guessing game or ask them to tell you each and every item there.)   Ugly: was told previously by calling that they charged children 4-10years old $7.99 price for lunch.  When paid . They charged my 10 years old adult price. I asked why that was. The waitress stumble a bit then said well up to 10. So I said yes he's not 11 , why am I paying adult pricesfor him??  she then said  she will double check. Came back and now said completely something different, children up to 7 ..  lol   Whatever, that's not good business , considering I didn't even ordered Champaign with my lunch.",

Our server was Alex, the manager, who was very friendly and attentive and after asking me what my preferences as far as spice levels go, suggested the chana but instead of masala, in a korma sauce. The restaurant was empty upon arrival but I noticed as it started getting dark outside, the restaurant became full. The view of the airport and the strip makes it a very positive experience. We ordered kabuli naan which is a sweet naan but worked so well with the spicy and salty food. My dinner date ordered lamb tikka masala and I ordered chana korma. The flavor and spice Ievel of the korma was outstanding but a little too salty for my tastebuds. My dinner date said his dish was tasty but the lamb tasted like beef. I have been wanting to try this place for some time now and foresee a return visit in the near future.",

The restaurant-bar-lounge is somewhat hidden in the second floor of a business park, but well worth seeking out if you enjoy Indian cuisine.  Their menu is expansive, opt for something beyond Butter Chicken and Tandoori dishes- though they likely do those just as well. We shared the Lamb Rogan Josh and Shrimp Saag entrees, with basmati rice and garlic naan. Dishes were amply portioned with flavorful sauces and a nice heat, and the proteins were fresh and juicy. If you enjoy the kick, upgrade to spicy!    The service for dinner seemed overwhelmed even before they got busy, with items forgotten, check errors, and a delay receiving our food. That said, I would come back for their lunch buffet ($12/pp?) to try more of their dishes before returning for a dinner. Good date night spot for the food quality and views!",

They also gave us 2 plates of rice for 3 entrees.   The service started off ok, but towards the end we were neglected. There was a Yelp coupon for a \"free samosas with the purchase of 2 entrees\", we were unable to click on the coupon from an Android and iPhone so the waiter took this opportunity to ignore the deal. When we showed him that it wasn't pulling up, he said he would look into it. He never did...   We were a party of 3 adults and 3 toddlers (2 year olds). The toddlers didn't order any additional food from their menu, SO I guess they made up for the lost revenue by adding a 15% (large party) gratuity to our bill. I had added a take out order to my bill and the 15% was added to the take out order.   This place was good, but I would probably not go back. The way that they handle business really turned me away.",

    "text": "Okay, the fact that this restaurant is located across from the airport on the second floor allows for pretty nice views -- the Strip skyline in the distance peppered periodically with planes making their descent into Vegas. I'll round up a star for that alone. You can ponder the logistics of aviation while waiting for your complimentary papadum and chutney. (The minty green sauce is better than the red.)  The entrance is a little odd. You walk in through some double doors, either take the elevator or stairs, pass the hookah lounge, and make a turn at the long hallway. We went on a Sunday evening. There were about two other tables there. One of them consisted of tourists, clad in Vegas memorabilia, and the other was an Indian family, so that's a good sign.   I got the PALAK PANEER ($14) while my dad got the LAMB KARAHI ($16). Both came with Basmati rice, but it was merged onto one plate (could've used another scoop or so). We also got an order of the garlic naan, but it was served kind of cold. My entree was the palak paneer, which is my favorite Indian dish. I barely ate a third of it and got full. No one thinks you can get full off of pureed spinach and cheese cubes, but those spices and seasonings do their job of pumping up the flavor. I didn't try the lamb because I'm not a fan of gamey meats, but my dad said it was good. So there you go.  Service was mediocre. Our two waiters didn't seem too friendly. Also, it was Easter and so I called ahead to make sure I could use my Groupon and the lady had said yes. When I tried to redeem it, one of the waiters was adamant in declining it. (In fine print, it states not valid on federal holidays, but Easter isn't a federal holiday.) He replied that he had not been accepting them all day. Well, I guess those grouponers got swindled. He ended up redeeming mine after I explained I had called in to check. There was a lady bussing tables that day and she was the friendliest out of all them.  Overall, Pure Indian Cuisine has a great location/view, worth checking out with the Groupon. I'd stop by again, but it's not my favorite. There are plenty of Indian restaurants in the city deservedly vying for your visit.",

However we ordered the butter chicken and garlic nan. Both were cooked well and tasted good. The service was good, However my 1 criticism is that the chicken in the butter chicken wasn't cooked in the tandoor and if it was then there was so charred umami to the chicken which made the dish something lacking in character. I might come back here to try some other dishes when we are in Vegas next.",

It may seem strange when walking into the entrance but just go up to the second level and follow the signs.  A long little hallway leads you back to the dining room and bar.  Windows span the restaurant which gives you a great view of the planes landing. The view is outstanding!  Of course I am a bit biased if you know what my husband does for a living.   We came here for their lunch buffet.  With Indian food I always enjoy a variety on my plate.  Their buffet has good offerings from soups, salad, vegetarian and traditional.  Unfortunately I am really bad about the names of their dishes but the intense flavors of each selection really hit every taste bud.  Of course they bring out a basket garlic naan bread which was inhaled immediately.    The service here was welcoming and very attentive.  With good service and good food, there wouldn't be a hesitation to come back.",

The buffet is open 11am- 3pm and has a lot of great selections, especially if you are new to Indian food and not sure what you'd like. Buffet is the way to go! My husband & I have also gone for dinner. We got a couple of appetizers and split an entree, totaling $30- with leftovers! Such a great deal and delish food! The only recommendation I would make is better quality in service.",

You'd be surprised just how calming and enjoyable it is to see the plans take off and land.  Service is on-point and the food is delicious.  You never quite know what you will get from one Indian restaurant to the next, so it's a delight to find a great place near where I work. Come for lunch or dinner.  You won't be sorry!",

Entree items run up from 15 and up but it tastes pretty good and how Indian food usually taste like. For locals better off avoiding the hassle of the strip traffic. If ur on the strip already this place is way better than urban turban which stinks",

The restaurant reminds me of one from India, especially walking up the stairs and through the hallways, but it does have a pretty cool view of the airport's runways. The staff was a little scatter-brained and the food wasn't being refilled on time, but it was very tasty nonetheless. It'd be better if they included more options, like more desserts and chai in their buffet, but all in all, we'll be back. Parking was a little difficult because the lot got full, so you may have to go to the lot below the building.",

We've eaten some pretty great Indian food both in the UK and in the US, especially in the Chicago area where we live; Pure Indian was just as good as our favorite restaurants in more promising locations (right outside the Las Vegas airport didn't seem too auspicious).  The saag paneer and chicken tikka masala were both very flavorful, and the garlic naan was excellent.  The service was also stellar, with multiple servers checking on us regularly; if anything, they need to pull back a little on the number of times they ask to refill your water.  It turns out that an airport strip mall is in fact a great location for a restaurant, since you can sit at the window and have a great view of the Strip and of the planes taking off and landing at the airport.  Overall, this was a great experience, and we will most definitely be back if we return to Vegas!",

It's on the second floor so you have to take the stairs or the elevator.  As soon as I walked in, I was wowed by the view of the runway with the plane taking off!! I was welcomed by the waitress, Nikita. She was nice and sweet. There are so many different curries in the buffet area. From vegetarian ones to chicken ones to lamb ones!! I tried everything and they were all delicious. The chicken was tender and flavorful. I liked \"Navaratan Korma\". It's cashew nuts pasted curry. Nice sweet taste but a bit spicy. It was delicious with their garlic naan.  I met a guy here that explained me about all of their vegetarian curries (How nice!). He said he's a vegetarian and he comes here every week. So, if you are a vegetarian and love Indian food, you still have a lot of choices you can eat at this place!! Vegetarian friendly. I'd love to come back here at night for the view!!",

The food here is not too hot and spicy,  a beautiful blend that is just right.  I would recommend their garlic nam and their rice pudding.",

Great food and very attentive service. Manni was great and we felt very much like valued patrons. We came at sunset and enjoyed the great view of the strip. I highly recommend this not only to people who like Indian food but even those who are just looking to try it for the first time.",

It serves delicious food and everything about the place is incredibly authentic - from the entertainment, to the decor, to the flavors of the food. The servers are so kind and cater to your every need. You have a great view of the airport runway while you're dining which is exciting for me and great for families. The entire experience at Pure Indian Cuisine is phenomenal.",

    "text": "Lived in Las Vegas for 56 years. I've eaten at a lot of places. I was thrilled at how delicious this food is. The Menu is a bit hard to decipher but with the help of the charming waitress I decided on a Chicken curry dish with a buttery sauce (Chicken Tiki Marsala *not sure about the spelling.) WOW! Excellent portions, chicken was tender. I asked for spicy, it was not unpleasantly hot.  Lots of perfect rice. More then enough to take home left overs. We ate  at 4 pm, after the buffet had ended to avoid any rush. The restaurant is on the 2nd floor and over looks the airport runways with the Strip in the background. It's clean and pleasantly decorated with a full bar. We took our time and never felt rushed or ignored. The only thing is it was in the middle of summer and about 116 that afternoon. They needed to boost the air conditioning as the food was hot and so was the weather. I can't wait to visit again.",
