Our drinks weren't filled until the end of our dining experience; at one point, it took us quite a while to get the attention of our server so we could order more. However, I would give this place another chance as the food made up for the service. The Screaming Orgasm sashimi was mouth-watering, and the rolls I ordered were flavorful and filling.",

Our server was Hayley, after we ordered our first items, we tried to get her attention to order more items. We didn't place our 2nd order for almost 30 minutes.    If we're ordering all u can eat, you would think she would be at the table more often.  They have no team work.  We asked 2 other servers there to order something, even a drink and they all told us that only our server could get it.  If I was the owner, they would all be fired.   It's called team work.   Help each other out.  After we were done, we had to ask for the bill cause no one seen to check if we were done.  Tables around us got their bill. before us and they didn't seat till after us. Smh.  Never again.   I will let people know that this place sucked!!   We had a piece of hair in our mussel and no manager came by to apologize.  We don't want nothing for free but as a owner/manager they need to go to school and take up business.",

We starting ordering nigiri and we were at about 6 different types but they only come 2 per order so it would have only been 12 pieces shared between the both of us and the server told us to stop ordering because it would be way too much to eat. So we just kind of looked at her and said okay. We got the order and finished it quick because it was little and we were hungry. So my girlfriend ordered an udon and the waitress said that it came with a lot of noodles so we shouldnt order anything else.  Last time I checked it was ALL YOU CAN EAT. We can eat a lot and we were starving. And worse the little bit of food we were allowed to order didnt even taste good. It was mediocre at best. There are many other AYCE sushi places around and I'll definitely be going to those instead now and I recommend you do as well.",

    "text": "SUSHI Waa--heres my order?   Sushi wa-s the server ever gonna take an order?  Sushi wa-it.   Sushi wa-tttt theee FUCK?!  Im sitting in \"bamboo jail\" as I write with all the Yelpers here for a UYE. We started at 6pm, it is now 8:50pm as I start this review and we are sitting waiting on them transacting everyone out.  Food is still decent, however service is rude and inefficient from our main server. One half of the table was getting service and the other half where I was sitting was kinda ignored a lot more, waited more to put orders, etc. He'd take their order, leave, come back with something for them and then we would have to try to flag him. We'd wave him, he'd say he'll be back and doesn't come back to us or he would walk passed us like we didn't wave at all. A few people had lost orders and instead of saying something kind like \"sorry, let me go check on that and get it out\"....it's more of remarks like we never put the order, you got it (no someone else got it) ,etc. One of our Yelpers asked three times to get her first order when the other side already on their 2nd round of orders.   I was gonna do 3 stars but now with tge transactions, I'm miffed. First, they wont split the bill and kinda told us we had to just deal with it because they're busy.  We computed what we all owe and wrote in the back which cards to charge what. Now something with POS being the only one for orders and transactions so they don't want to back up orders by transacting all us out so they'll transact when orders aren't coming in. We had a Korean speaking Yelper go talk to him and he was rude about it so she went to talk to the manager who said he will do it in a bit. We had to wait for him and explain everything. It took like 20 minutes of discussing things and explaining how we wrote down what before they went to the back to start. We have no choice but to wait. I'm sorry, but one thing I learned about restaurant hospitality that turnover is important because waiting for a check lowers the impression farther than waiting a bit for good food. People are done and want to just go. We finally got our receipts back and......  they charge my credit card for two drinks and two AYCE.   We wrote everything down clearly on the back on to receipt. We put the last 4 digits of each card to identify them and what amount to charge to each card. HOW is that NOT clear enough? They charged me for someone else.   Okay, so basically then they should give me some cash back then bring back the cash people some change. Well, first time they not only gave me less than what I was owed, but also no change for people with cash. They finally gave it and we left at 9:40pm.  50 minutes to transact is pretty crazy long.   I know it's easy to say that well, it's a pretty a-typical effed up situation. That maybe with the busy place and a waitstaff that doesn't micromanage it well it went down south fast. However, I do have previous visits where I do specifically state how odd the service was odd, not friend and inefficient so that holds True that the waiter service isn't that good here. Also, it got super busy on my last visit towards the end of my dinner and I also waited 20 minutes to get a mochi and 15 minutes more to get my check back to sign so I was held hostage prior to this. So no, it can happen to you in some degree.   Please retrain the staff....and HIRE some good servers. The busboy was polite and did more than just remove plates by checking orders and refilling drinks. PLEASE make him a server and maybe make your rude server a busboy until he learns how to talk to people.   I don't deny the AYCE is good, but if you go then don't go at peak hours, don't sit at a table- ONLY with the nice sushi bar guys and do cash if you have a party splitting the check.   Look at how thorough I was in taking pictures and reviewing individual items because I wanted people to come with my last review. However after this incident I am not recommending it or coming back. I was frustrated all throughout the meal and exasperated at how I was charged and then shortchanged cashback. I haven't felt this way about a dining experience in a long time so 1 star isn't out of line.  There are many AYCE areas in the area including my favorite, Island Sushi whose staff is pure aloha hospitality.  Update- Owner sent a apologetic note....I give him kudos for that and would've given a star for his professionalism. Then a week later I get a anonymous note from someone in henderson talking about me giving bad reviews and how dare I \"destroy families\". Given that I only have 15 1 star reviews out of nearly 500 and havent given a bad review in ages, it made me wonder. Then I found out other people got the same message that dined with me here so it doesn't take two to figure out our crabby server didn't like what we said. SO unprofessional and cowardly! Your server really made sure we don't come back.",

    "text": "It pains me to write this review, but not as much as the guilt I feel for subjecting my friends to the disaster that occurred on Friday night. What I thought would be a fun sushi night turned out to be a nightmare. I left before witnessing said nightmare, but from hearing what really happened, my review would be much lower if I had been there. If I had known what I know now about the service, particularly one waiter, I would have picked one of the many other sushi joints in the area.   Anyways, the sushi was pretty good. Highlights of the AYCE were the very crunchy calamari w/ two choices of dipping sauce, the Hamachi Kama, and the Seared Tuna Nigiri. Portions are big, especially the rolls. Some of the seafood could have been fresher, like the Uni; but, overall, the sushi was satisfactory. The food alone deserves 3 stars.   What doesn't deserve 3 stars is the service. At first, the service was good, our server was nice. At this point, my review was sitting pretty at 3 stars. But as the night progressed, I could tell our server was getting frustrated due to the orders and the amount of people at the restaurant. Large parties are always difficult, I understand that; however, if everyone in the table is ordering AYCE, it shouldn't be difficult to split the bill. Having to leave early, I needed to pay early. After asking our server multiple times if I could pay early, he finally agreed (after saying no initially) and took my card. However when I got the bill, I immediately knew something wasn't right. I was overcharged by $3 or so, but I was in a hurry, so I just paid and left it at that. Service deserves 2 stars.   Maybe the server was having an off night, but I made reservations in advance for our large party, so they should've been more prepared. I'm kind of relieved I missed the fiasco that occurred after I left because if I had stayed, I definitely would have lived up to the Sushi Wa name and cried (*Wa wa*).  For small parties, Sushi Wa is a-ok, but large parties beware!  *EDIT* One of the owners contacted me and apologized for what happened, hence the bump to three stars.",

    "text": "When I moved to Las Vegas, Sushi Wa was the first place I had sushi. That was years ago, before they changed over to an AYCE format. My husband is not a sushi eater and Sushi Wa was always a place we could go together for dinner because they serve teriyaki chicken bento boxes all day.   Fast forward a few years... My mother was in town with her boyfriend visiting and wanted to go out for dinner. My husband suggested Sushi Wa. I was a little concerned, I had read about the less-then-amazing experience some Yelpers had at a recent UYE. Since our group was fairly small, we decided to risk it...   The hostess allowed us to select where we wanted to sit and brought out both the AYCE and regular menus. We decided pretty quickly that AYCE wasn't going to be worth the money (it is $26.95 per person, and they limit sashimi to one order per person) since we weren't super hungry.   The three of us split a Philadelphia roll, a spicy tuna salad, and the sashimi combo (4 pieces each of tuna, salmon and yellowtail). My husband had the bento box and we all split an order of edamame as well as two bottles of nigori sake. The sashimi was sliced nice and thick, and I love that Sushi Wa makes their Philly roll with asparagus, gives it a nice yummy crunch.   Total damage with tip was $100. This isn't too bad for dinner and drinks for 4 people, but we really did not have that much food. The decor is very nice and service was decent, we had multiple people check on us throughout the night and never waited long for anything other then the bento box which was understandable.  Will I be back? Maybe someday. There are a LOT of other sushi options in the area though...",

    "text": "Sad that I HAVE to give one star.  We came in tonight as it was my fiances birthday. He looked all over yelp to find a good sushi restaurant that he has never been to as we go to them all the time. We saw good reviews and decided to dine here but I will say it will be the first and the last. I am not a fish eater at ALL! I always order my regular katsu chicken. When my fiance ordered ayce and I didn't it seemed to be a red flag to the waitress. Needless to say we know the rules are for ayce and she made them clear several times. Almost to the point that she was accusing us of sharing. We were there for about 2 hours and after our initial dish was served she came rarely to see if he wanted anymore of his ayce sushi. Which is unacceptable. I mean to be served 3 times in 2 hours with no refills even on our water let alone sushi is nonsense. The food was not amazing and the service terrible. Sorry to the others who chose to dine here based on the yelp stars.",

    "text": "Man, this place was so much fun to eat at.  As we all know, I tend to dine solo.  If I'm hungry, I'm gonna go eat.  I can make friends where ever I'm at.  Cue scene: Saturday night 10pm.  I'm starved... After my disastrous breakfast, I realized I hadn't eaten since then. So I check out my trust Yelp for something close yet tasty.  Enter SushiWa and their AYCE.  I think what hurts this place is you have to know what you're looking for or else you will pass it.  I don't like the fact that I can't enter this center off of Eastern if I'm heading south from St. Rose.  If you turn on Coronado Center, it's the first driveway.    I stroll in, and the place is practically empty.  Bad for them, but that means I get my own sushi chef. Yay! As other people have mentioned, the fish is fresh... Very fresh.  Also, they are known for their rolls.  The rolls are very Americanized, which is something that I have a love/hate with.  Some of the rolls had a bit too much sauce for me (I like to taste my fish).  Don't get me wrong, they have sashimi and a limited traditional sushi menu, but it's pretty American.  I can understand the why behind it.  The cool thing is that when I just started asking for things not on the menu they could make it, which sparked an interesting \"where are you from\" conversation.  THE CHEF EVEN STARTED TO LEARN MY PALATE AND CATERED THE SUSHI TOWARDS ME!  That's service.  That's five stars!  Now, there is a bit of a language barrier with some of the chefs as English is definitely not their first language.  One of them even apologized to me at one point, I told them don't worry about it because it's not like I can speak his language anyway.  Also, I found the Korean influence on the menu interesting.  I'm certainly gonna go back and try the bulgogi.  I also loved that I could keep getting oranges for dessert-- orange that looked like a pumpkin, orange that looked like a cat.  Oh and they have Orion and another beer that is slipping my mind right now.  Whatever it was, it was $9, and boy was it tasty!  The best part was the staff themselves.  Did the waiter forget to refill my tea once?  Yes, but when he saw me pick up my glass and rushed to me apologizing profusely for his mistake.  It actually made me feel badly that he felt so badly about it.  The chefs were so much fun to hang out with.  I was laughing so hard at one point that I started crying.  Joon, Ken, and \"buy one get one free\" totally made my night.  I didn't feel like I was out to eat by myself, but like I was at a friend's house that could really cook.",

    "text": "The following is my opinion of this establishment.  I WOULD NOT COME BACK.  I wish I could give this place 0 stars.... besides having very bland and in my opinion not fresh fish (I have been there twice - hoping the first time was just a fluke, but it wasn't), last time I was there I SAW 3 COCKROACHES behind the sushi counter!  IN PLAIN SIGHT!  Also, I saw a different kind of bug in their bathroom.  Someone PLEASE PUT THEM ON DIRTY DINING.  Then to make that even worse, I saw a sushi chef drop a piece of salmon and then wash it off.  SERIOUSLY?????!!!!??????  If I hadn't paid for AYCE, then I would have just walked right out right there.  I asked to talk to the manager and this Korean guy named \"Joon\" asked me what the problem was, and when I told him, he said that was not possible.  I said I SAW IT WITH MY OWN EYES.  He said I had \"my own interpretation.\"  So, when the bill came, I paid it and didn't tip (obviously).  Then as I was walking out, the waitress asked why I didn't tip her.  I said that it was because the place was horrible and there were bugs, then I walked out.  Then that guy Joon followed me to my car asking why I didn't tip!!!  He harrassed me and my friend IN THE PARKING LOT, only 20 minutes after saying that I was wrong when I saw bugs at his restaurant... so then he was saying that I had to tip... and I said that the menu said gratuity was added on for parties of 6 or more, and I was only a party of 2, and frankly ARE YOU KIDDING ME????  Needless to say, I won't be going back.",

    "text": "Oishii desu yo!  Man, I wish I had tried this place long ago.  Why have I avoided Sushi Wa in the past?  Mostly because their menu used to be pretty pricey and it looked too upscale to take my two rambunctious rug rats to.  Unfortunately, that relegated me to eating at too many sushi bars that wouldn't know a fresh fish even if it was thrashing on a cutting board.    But along came my chance when some clients thought it'd be a good idea to try this joint.  Upon arriving, there were comments about how nice the place looked.  In fact, the place looked like it didn't quite belong in a strip mall tucked next to U-Swirl (no offense to U).    Sitting down, everyone chose to do AYCE, which meant I had to suppress the desire to order everything on the menu (and to order 10 scoops of ice cream).  Yes.  I am a pig.  When it was time to order, I probably should not have been the one to do so.  Here's the rundown of what I can remember:  Oyster Shooters - suckas was HUGE!  Best to shoot the sake and quail egg, then pick out the oyster.  Raw Oysters (3 per order) - too big for me, but good flavor.  Soft Shell Crab - I love it that you don't have to have it with rice.  Nigiri sushi was impressive for the way the fish drapes over the rice and the quality of the hamachi in particular was notable.  Mexican Roll - This was so not my cup of tea.  It's like they took the leftover spicy tuna and mixed it with a bunch of crap.    Deserts were AYCE, which, if left unattended, I would have shut this place down.  Lucky for them I was with clients and didn't get crazy.  I actually ordered one of each of the 6 or 7 flavors of mochi ice cream, but I changed my order to two scoops of green tea ice cream and the banana tempura.  For better or worse I didn't order sake...this was supposed to be business meeting, after all.  But I did check out their alcohol list to see what I was missing and they actually have some really good sake on there.  Try the Wakatake or Kurosawa black - good stuff you don't find in most local sushi restos.    Why have I avoided Sushi Wa in the past?  I don't know!  They have it all, ambiance, fresh fish, good sake and all the desert your tummy can handle.

The service and staff were incredibly attentive, beverages were constantly refilled and food did not take long to arrive.   The one part I felt lacked was the food itself. The miso soup lacked in taste, I am not sure what kind of broth was utilized but I expected more from it. The sushi rolls, while affordable, were not incredibly distinguishable, it was not enough to make me come back for more.  It was ok sushi, but nothing to write home about. Perhaps it's due to the fact they offer \"all you can eat\" at a very affordable price ($27 at the time of my visit) which means they may have to skimp on quality.   While the atmosphere and staff really shine in the place, I feel there are better locations for sushi in the area.",

    "text": "No. WE ARE NOT GOING TO EAT HERE. First, we called the restaurant today 04/08 at around 12:15 and we spoke to a girl to ask questions for takeout and she doesn't even know what kind of food they have and she said SHE WAS BUSY. So we went to the restaurant and there's only one server (who answers the phone as well) and approached her if we could order for takeout. 30 minutes later, my husband was waving at her to order as there are only 3 tables so we thought itll be okay to already order as it was more than 30 minutes wait time. The server said, \"Sorry I'm busy\". So my husband told her \"if you couldnt take my order, let me know so I could already walk out.\" We then left very disappointed.  So we understand that she was by herself taking all orders, taking the food and dishing out. But at least acknowledge the PEOPLE who comes to your restaurant. Despite the good reviews that you guys have, WE ARE NOT GOING TO TRY IT AND WILL NEVER RECOMMEND to anyone due to the fact that the service was horrible.  To whoever that server was (on 04/08, 1am), we really hope the management could read this and fire you. The restaurant doesn't deserve you.",

I came back today, and was pleasantly surprised. When I asked our server why the salmon was so unique and fresh, she said the owner imports fresh every day! Extremely rare for Vegas, as we aren't near the ocean, most sushi restaurants are frozen and costly.   Whereas the AYCE closely resembles Sushi Mon, with fresher fish and closely detailed presentation and flavor. Definitely worth the price, with Kabuki sized salmon sushi that tastes even fresher.",

Then we ordered the albacore/onion/pickled jalepeno sashimi...it was okay, couldn't really taste the fish. Then we ordered \"pimp my roll\"...again it was okay. I felt like the salmon sushi was the best and freshest thing we ordered. The rest tastes like they were trying to cover the fish up with a bunch of sauce because it wasn't fresh. We paid more for a la cart and it wasn't worth it. Our favorite places in town are Momo Sushi (on Stephanie) and I love sushi (on eastern).",

Again the service (Jenny) was great. Perfect timing. We weren't rushed. Atmosphere is subtle and has great subdued lighting. We had the AYCA for $23 lunch special. The dinner AYCE is $27. There are many, many traditional (and cooked) and Hawaiian choices if that's your thing too.  The food: The fish was fresh and well constructed. One or two of the rolls were a tiny bit loose on the wrap, but I really have to nit pick to find a complaint. Well presented. More roll choices than your standard sushi place were included. They have this amazing little ball of wonderful call the Pocky Roll, which you dive into with your chop sticks like a blooming onion at Outback. It's albacore, crab meat, a bit of red onion, jalapeno and then covered with a perfectly ripe avocado. It is a little ball of deliciousness! My only improvement would be if they changed the music to Japanese zen background music instead of 80's pop. It's a tiny bit distracting from the whole vibe. Loved it. Will go again for sure!!",

When my family and I came here for the AYCE, we expected a great meal. After a few orders, the waiters (and what I assume is the owner) got tired of coming and we were forced to wait 15-20 minutes between orders. The owner brought us our check before we even asked for it and kept staring and laughing at me. I assume this is because I'm a big man and can eat quite a bit. They forgot quite a few of our orders as well. If you have a big stomach but no soul, I suggest you eat here because the owner seems to lack one as well as soon as he sees customers who can eat quite a bit. Otherwise, if you want a non-hostile and nice service staff, I suggest you eat at another restaurant.",

Ordered our appetizers and first entrees.  Once the food started coming to the table, it all came at a nice pace.  Rolls were a bit loose, and tended to fall apart easily.  They were a bit large in portion as well, which makes it hard to eat.  They restrict how much of certain items you can have for each person and when we tried to order the Uni and was told they were out.  Service was very good, constantly clearing the dishes and taking orders for next course.  Overall, very good atmosphere, great service, good food.  No complaints.  Will be returning!",

You have a wide variety of rolls to chose from plus sashimi (AYCE places usually do not offer) and a great selection of appetizers. Extremely satisfied with this place. It is a little more expensive then other AYCE but the quality of fish makes up for that difference. Strongly recommend!",

When someone at the other end of the sushi bar said that they saw a bug, both my dining partner and myself tried to put it out of our minds.  BAD MOVE.  We continued to order and eat, only to have a small brown roach crawl right in front of us, on the sushi bar.  When we wigged out and pushed away from the counter, I happened to look down and saw another one at my feet.  Crap on a cracker...I was GROSSED OUT.  The worst part??? The waitress wasn't even freaked out by it....she simply walked over and went after them with a napkin....like she deals with it all of the time.  Googly moogly.  They took 30% off of the check (really????), which we didn't even ask them to, we'd have paid full price...we just wanted to leave.  I didn't know upon leaving what I wanted to do more...throw up or shower.  Super disappointing because the place looks elegant and clean.  Nasty.",

The big perk for me was the \"1/2 Off Lunch\" special, which had sushi (6-8 pieces) for anywhere from 2.50 to 5 bucks.  They no longer offer this, and the 'new' lunch specials are meh. I dont go to sushi places for california rolls. $9 for a few pieces of veggie tempura, chicken/beef teriyaki, and 4 cal rolls with a small salad.  The food itself is good, and service is nice.. But I usually planned to gorge myself on decent sushi for $10, not a cheapie bento.  Of note, they do have an 'all you can eat' for $21.",

Decor is semi modern and there are some intimate looking booths to sit in, but we were not even given that option for some reason. Service is very good and refills of drinks happened very frequently. Good rolls, but like I said nothing that really stands out. I had a order of UNI, but it wasn't really that tasty. It needs to have that fresh ocean taste that only True UNI fan will understand, mine had that unfavorable \"mediciney\" taste to it. I often order UNI at sushi places and it takes 10 to 15 minutes for it to come to the table for some unknown reason, maybe it's frozen and needs to be thawed out? Well the UNI at Sushi Wa came out right away, but tasted off.  The All you can eat price is a few dollars higher than all the rest, but then again it's not a huge negative, but just saying. I REALLY  don't like to hear loud obnoxios hip hop music when I am trying to have a decent dinner. I guess they are catering to the young crowd, but it would be cool to have some traditional Japanese lounge music playing softly in the background? I would actually trade loud conversation from diners than listen to loud music.",

Sushi Wa came up displaying a 11:30 closing time.  We got there at 11:10 and set at the bar, the owner came up and told us they closed at 11:30 and that our choices were limited.  I told them we only wanted Sushi and they said no problem. Roy and Ken were the chefs and did a great job.  I served them a few rounds of Black Raspberry Saki and they were more than happy to stay and talk to us.  Great guys and they really seem to love their job.  We ordered their version of a Screaming Orgasm which was very good.  It has a more liquidly dressing but is spicier. There was so much dressing left over that we asked for more Daikon. Ken obliged us with a mountain of the stuff.  We also had the Blue Fin sushi-mi on Roy's recommendation, which was excellent.  Sushi Wa is nicely decorated and very elegant. Perfect for a nice romantic date with plenty of booths that seem to be pretty private.  I will go back if anything just to see Ken and Roy again.  Great guys.",

There are a mixture of booths and tables that are all spaced out perfectly so you never are too close to another group, unlike some other sushi places that can be very crowded and you feel like you're sitting with the table next to you. I always get the AYCE sushi, such and amazing deal! The cucumber salad is some of the best I ever have had, and I have never not enjoyed a roll I have gotten. Unfortunately I live on the other side of town now.. closer to places like OYSHI, but every time I go somewhere else I just miss this place terribly. The staff is always super friendly and the owner is usually there and says hi to tables. My one friend is a regular and they always take great care of us and everyone who dines there. I truly recommend this place for anyone who lives sushi, it's THE BEST! You won't regret it!",

This place is Yelp friendly as I noticed they suggest you ask how to get a free drink or app from the server.  My only confusion was that they wanted my to write the review before I obtained my free drink right there on the spot which didn't make sense to me as I don't review a place for he most part until after a few times even. So I mentioned I'd show them my review next time I come in !  I tried a variety of nigiri, sashimi, hot appetizers and they were all good. I generally don't go to all you can eat sushi spots but this one hit the spot ! Their service was more than exceptional.  I think next time I go i will try the Ramen!",

I stopped the server to tell him I wanted to add a roll to my order and he said no he was busy And he told us how he's been so busy he hasn't been able to go to the bathroom ( comment was unnecessary) he never came back we had to stop a different server to tell him to bring us the check. At this point we just wanted to leave. Service was awful the few rolls we were able to get were good but won't be going back.",

It was nice, but I hope they get busier during the late hours.   Our server was very nice and polite. She took our orders promptly and the sushi chef was very nice too, checking in on us.   We liked the salmon sashimi, I liked their ikura too. Their spider roll was one of the best ones we've tasted too.   The bikini and lava rolls were also ones that stuck out to us. They were pretty big portions.   For dessert we did strawberry mochi ice cream, pretty generic but good:-)  Would definitely come back for the ayce when I'm back in Vegas.",

    "text": "Say it in a Snookie voice... \"Sushi Waaaaaa\". Wow, what a dated reference.  This location is right next door to my barber and I've been wanting to try this place for the past couple of months. Sushi Wa has the basic look and feel of the old standard sushi bar, but with food items like the Super Spider Roll, Shrimp Killer, and the Superman Burrito Roll, needless to say the menu is far from basic.   I rolled in (pun intended) around 3pm and the place was empty, perfect! My lunching partner and I sat at the bar and ordered a small meal because we were in a bit of rush. We stayed on the beaten path as far sushi orders go with Spicy Ahi Tuna Roll, Calamari Tempura Roll, and a bowl of Udon. Like I said, \"we were in a rush\", which now I realize is bad idea to go to a new place and not take the time to snack on their interesting and funky faire.   The Calamari Tempura Roll was plated beautifully and set the tone for my hunger right off the bat. The large rolls filled with crab, avocado, and coated in a tasty fish sauce were not only easy on the eyes, but they didn't stand a chance against to my chopstick to mouth skills. This plate was accompanied with a generous helping tempura calamari along with little dollops of japanese mayo and dots of spicy oil in the center. Amazing!  The Udon was a nice break from the calamari munching mayhem. The noodles were cooked to firm perfection and the broth would have been slurped down with a straw if the server would have obliged my gluttonous tendencies. The fish cakes and tempura veggies that came with soup were a welcomed addition to this large bowl of awesome.   The Spicy Tuna Roll, fell flat. I mean like Wile E. Coyote falling from a cliff flat. So much so that I didn't finish it, which says a lot. Who doesn't finish sushi? I can't quite put my finger on it, but it just had an interesting texture and a weird flavor profile.   This location still gets a 4 stars because just like the majority of the meal, the service was stellar and I didn't walk out feeling like my wallet was just bent over and taken advantage of. I will be back to try aforementioned rolls and this time there will be no time crunch, just seaweed wrapped, saki soaked, sushi eating enjoyable dining.",

My friend decided we were doing AYCA sushi for me, lol, and I usually worry about these decisions because I usually don't down a lot of sushi in one sitting.  Buuut, this AYCA includes sashimi,  and appetizers, and dessert.  There was LA kalbi on the menu, and I get it's portioned small because it's an app and it promotes variety, but damn they were good.  They were done so right, and this was my friend's first opportunity try some Korean BBQ. Yeah, this is another sushi place run by Koreans, and it's good.  She got their garlic edamame and I got the spicy one, it's actually spicy.  I liked it more than I usually like edamame.    We got the rose roll, and it had lobster and baked scallops and sauce and sweet  onion and was really tasty, her favorite is the ultimate garlic tuna roll, it's on a plate surrounded by garlic sauce.  We got salmon sashimi, and this other roll with white tuna on top and I forgot what it was called, and bunch of other stuff I can't remember the names of, I can't remember the menu, but just eat it.  We got coffee and green tea mochi ice cream, it was a nice little end.",

Fish quality, awesome!   We used to come to this place all the time. Used to brag about this place to all my friends. Now, I cant.. I seriously can't anymore. When we brought to the manager's attention that the rice portion was ridiculous (now I wish I could have taken a picture of it) he was totally cool about it and told us they'll fix it but the server came up all irritated and told us they can't tolerate it and will have to charge us next time we can't finish the rice. Server barely checked on us, it was mainly the manager. Server didn't smile for the most part.  Just super disappointed. We thought so highly of this place before & loved it so much that no matter how long the drive was,  we would go for the overall quality of the restaurant.. heartbroken Still tipped them good ;) cause it wasn't all bad.

To top it off, I think it's silly that you can't share with others in your party that ordered AYCE. The sushi wasn't all that great and I'm pretty sure I won't go back there.",

I wasn't aware that it was put together with our orders put together. SMH.",

The Kobe, omg melts in ur mouth like butter. Very very good.  The uni sushi was AMAZING!!!! Sweet and flavorful.  We ordered a couple of more things but I forgot.

When I asked her about the hours of operation and confirmed that the restaurant did not close for another hour her response to me was \"it takes too long to clean up.\" I couldn't believe it.

    "text": "I'm a little upset about my visit tonight at Sushi Wa. My family and I go there just about any chance we get, but due to changing schedules, new jobs, etc. it has been about a month since we came in last.   We were seated quickly, in a booth that we requested- there were a couple at a table, a few people at the bar, and one other booth occupied when we arrived.   We noticed right off hand that the menus were new. Which made us wonder if the management or owner had changed- because it was a completely different style.   The waitress, who didn't introduce herself wasn't one that we had ever seen before. She brought back our drinks rather quickly, and took my boyfriends order, but as soon as I opened my mouth to ask for my rolls-she walked away. And she didn't come back until she delivered our first order of food.   When I did ask to order, her face completely changed. It was shocking to me.  At first I thought it was just me, but my boyfriend saw it as well. It looked as if I was severely an inconvenience to her, and as if she had somewhere to be.   I know that menu items take time, however, with a restaurant that isn't even 1/4 full, waiting 30 minutes for two rolls that were ordered by my boyfriend the first time is a little silly.   The food was still delicious, I recommend the sex bomb, bonsai, crispy rice, and the seared peppered baby tuna. However, it's the worst service that we have ever experienced-and I'm disappointed in sushi wa. Hopefully this was just a fluke.  Also, they do not have child pricing.  So a five year old will cost you the same $28 for an adult's dinner.",

Why not have one menu for ala carte and a different menu for All u can eat? Also, so many confusing restrictions on one order per person on sashimi, mochi, etc. Id rather go to other AycE sushi places like Kaizen or Umiya etc.",

The food was decent but their sashimi selection is very small and very limited. Their sushi selection, rolls, and hot foods were good but nothing \"wowed\" me.  2. Every single time our server would come to take our order (we were 4 people doing AYCE) she would ALWAYS have to comment about how much food we were ordering and if we were 100% sure we wanted what we just ordered. This made no sense to us because we were well aware that there can be charges for left over food. This honestly ruined the mood and the food which is why I took an additional star from my review.",

Highly recommend trying the email and ask for it to be crispy. The yellow fin tuna is so fresh and delicious. Everything you order is delicious and very fresh. Definitely try the plum dessert. Reasonably price and plenty of parking. We've never waited more than two minutes. Prices range from $20 on up depending on how many people are in your party.",

It was much more robust than imagined with the albacore seared and wrapped around pickled red onion and then topped with a sweet garlic-ginger sauce. The sauce, for me, was too sweet, but then, I just don't love super sweet things in general. Once I dabbed off some of the sauce, it was great.   I also had the 911 roll with no rice. They were so accommodating, and it was fabulous! I loved the fresh fish, and the spicy & savory sauce. The avocado added a wonderful richness, and the micro greens gave it a nice peppery taste. I loved every bite, though I probably could have only ordered this and a glass of wine and been completely full!",

    "text": "Went here around 9:30pm on a Sunday and asked to sit at the bar. The place was pretty empty just a few people inside. The waiters were a bit slow given there weren't many people, but the sushi chefs were talkative and friendly, especially Joon, he's funny. The inside was a bit dark, had like a fancy restaurant layout. I recommend sitting at the bar if you want your sushi quick. The sushi were well made and the rice to fish ratio was great - small portion of rice and large portion of fish (as seen in the photo). I recommend getting the Rose Roll (Sushi Wa Specialty Rolls) was amazing. It was like a sushi roll piled up with the Dynamite. There were mushrooms, scallops, and baby lobster smothered with their special creamy sauce and oven baked. Yum!  The sashimi (part of the ayce) was fresh and thick. The Ebi (Sweet Shrimp) Nigiri was interesting because it had a special sauce on top that was very delicious and went well with the sweet shrimp. First sushi place I've went to so far that had this done.   The menu, as a first timer, was a bit confusing something I think they should work on because for example, the menu made it seem as if you can order one order of sashimi for each type of fish. However, it is one order of sashimi in general, so choose wisely. Another was how difficult it was to tell which was included in the AYCE and which were not. Also, I didnt know what kind of appetizer was appropriate to order from the waiter/waitress or the sushi chef. Those made it a hassle having to remember.   **If you want a free soft drink, sake, draft beer make sure to write a review and show them so you get it! :) **They are open pretty late, I think until 4am. Nice if you have those late night sushi cravings. ;)",

I will definitely come often especially with friends or on a date. The decor is nice, with high backed circular booths and high backed dining chairs. This place is packed on a Friday night. The appetizers are delicious, they have one order of sashimi allowed with the AYCE. The sashimi is thick cut and fresh. I ordered the Superman Burrito roll and it is indeed big and tasty. Must try appetizers are pork belly and soft shell crab tempura. The nigiri are small so you don't have to worry about filling up with rice. I have to mention the pork belly which is amazing. I rank this as good as Naked Fish and Jayde Fuzion in terms of taste and quality. Definitely 5 stars.",

The LSU game was on (SO went to LSU) and it's a nice place to watch sports. It was interesting...all of the sushi chefs were into the game, but normally at other places that means the rolls take forever to get finished and are low quality. All I can say is...great multitaskers! The rolls were awesome, the fish was top quality, it wasn't busy, very attentive staff.  Try something new and order a roll that sounds intriguing.

I thought the salmon was gonna swim off the plate and it tasted like butter.  We also tried the Pocky roll which is about 10lbs of avocado with some crab and albacore inside. I love avocado so this was yummers but it might be too much for some.  I've been back 2 more times, we did the all you can eat once. The price for all you can eat is competitive with other restaurants at this level but maybe even a little better as you get at least one serving of sashimi and one or two other specialty items which you wouldn't usually get with A.Y.C.E.  Highlights: -Pocky Roll -Mango Salmon Roll -Pokey Ahi Salad -Salmon Nigiri -Hamachi Nigiri -Banzai Roll -Good selection of asian beers including Hite which I didn't see on the menu but they did have in stock",

The first visit was with a sushi group from <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fmeetup.com&s=077f03ca6fcbacbd8626f92bdc3557d252b3b93aff296ea2aa3ca0c4cf2ca2c5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">meetup.com</a>. The fish is as good as it gets in the middle of the desert hundreds of miles away from the ocean. The rolls inventive enough to keep your interest.  The service while attentive isn't top notch. Too many rules to follow should you choose the AYCE option. Tonight, while entertaining friends from out of town, I had a truly unpleasant experience paying the bill. Without looking at the check, a credit card was presented and charged. They added an additional 20% gratuity and labeled it as TAX. Then they added sales tax to the total INCLUDING the gratuity.  When we questioned the charge, the manager said they automatically add a 20% gratuity to parties of five or more. I pointed out their menu states 18% on parties of SIX or more. He said they've changed policy but have not changed the menu. SAY WHAT? Had to argue with the manager to have the charge reversed. Told him that if he didn't immediately reverse the charge, I would dispute the charge with the credit card company. Time to find a new sushi bar.",

However once you roll in its definately upperclass.  the interior is very spacious, with private booth seats, regualar tables and an expansive bar area which we graciously occupied.  You can get the regular-whatever's-trendy in west LA fancy rolls here, but we befriended the Head chef (by ordering daiginjo sake and pouring a round to all the chefs;-) ) and asked for Chefs choice (Omakase style) but on the traditional side... and it was just crazy good! I think the constant Kanbai's with the chefs helped, cuz we got all the usual, but high grade toro, ikura, uni etc, but he also showed us a flying fish, live and whole, then fillet it before our eyes, and we had flying-fish sashimi, garnished with flying fish wings. Ditto with the Uni Rice where the rice was mixed with seasoning and Uni and served inside the Uni shell. I don't recall all that we ate here, i lot of stuff was new to me, but thats part of the fun in going to a new restaurant! oh they had Orion beer here too, which is a plus. The head chef also showed us a picture he took with the Princess of Belgium? who is apparently a regular there, but what i couldnt understand was, what the heck is the Princess of Belgium doing living in Vegas...",

Beautiful interior and really authentic Japanese, but modern like I like it!  Very Spotless inside!  The place quickly filled up for lunch!  I started off with miso soup and a house salad!  Soup was good salad was not! Old lettuce for sure!  Then I had tuna sashimi and it was excellent!  Good Value for the amount! Usually doesn't work that way!    Proceeded onto a Veggie tempura and Salmon roll both excellent!  The  service was perfect and I liked the fact that there were real \"Japanese\" sushi chefs and employees, kept it authentic this way!  Whenever I come back to Vegas I will make the trip off the strip to come back!  It's only a few miles east on the 215 off Pecos Blvd.   I",

The short story is:  I love it.  The $22 all you can eat lunch is a great value when you consider virtually everything on the menu is available, fresh and super delicious.  While the exterior of the restaurant is seriously underwhelming, the interior is very tastefully decorated with a cool modern vibe.  I also like how people can store their own chopsticks in these big racks with their names on the boxes.  I've had probably 6-7 different rolls, regular sushi, desert items (great Mochi) and have found portion sizes generous - and I reiterate most importantly - the fish was very fresh!  The service was also exceptional.  I've only sat at a table, so I can not comment about the Sushi Bar service experience.  All in all, I can't wait to return!",

It's a place I'd imagine in Santa Monica or West Hollywood only not as crowded and not pretentious.  The tofu salad was very tasty. I generally don't like Japanese salad dressings but the one on this was quite good. On the other hand, I had a seared tuna salad that was a little too heavy on the dressing and I couldn't taste the fish.  I'm a purist when it comes to fish. Give me sashimi! However, it's fun for me to look at a menu and see that mango is being used in rolls. I tried the salmon skin roll the last time I was there and can honestly say I'd recommend it.  There's something on the menu called, \"monkey brains\" but I noticed it on the way out.",

Every time we are trying to order, the server always give us this bad look.  And we don't really eat that much, trust me.

She immediate change her story saying it is not limited \"BUT I THINK EACH OF YOU HAVE 1 MOCHI ICE CREAM AND 1 REGULAR ICE CREAM I THINK THATS ENOUGH FOR YOU GUYS\"  I seriously start to laugh and tell her forget about it.

My husband and I discovered it one day after they first opened and went back several times.   The fish is very fresh and the rolls are very very tasty. If you sit at the counter the chef will prepare a special dish for you; we had something called Screaming Orgasm, and well, it speaks for itself. If you live in the area or have a local who can point the way for you, definitely give it a try.",

Maybe the location is the reason why it's always deserted, but that's no reason to miss out on fantastic nosh that tastes as great as it looks.  Joon, the owner, is a fantastic and the service is excellent.  They're attentive without being intrusive, which is always a treat to find in a restaurant where you aren't paying over $60 a plate.  Joon also treated my boyfriend and I to real wasabi--not the green kind, but the kind made from real wasabi root--because we had mentioned that we had never tried real wasabi before.  The fish is fresh, and the rolls are creative.  I would recommend the monkey brains and the tuna tartare for appetizers.  You will also be offered miso soup with your dinner, but there isn't anything standout with the miso soup.  It's good to cleanse the palette before your meal.    For their rolls, try it all out.  I like the tiger roll, superman roll, Joon's special.  I don't have them memorized, but I've never been disappointed with an order.  Overall, the food is wonderful, the people there are friendly and unpretentious and the decor echos their menu: modern, chic and tasteful.",

So I stood there and waited, and waited, and waited, and waited, and waited and waited. After 5-6 minutes of waiting, none of the 4 waitresses came over and asked me if I wanted to be seated, or if I wanted take-out or anything.  No one said a word to me and no one came over. So then I started to feel like an idiot just standing there, and so I left and went down the street to Spicy Tuna. Spicy Tuna was busier than SushiWa, but they took my order almost immediately as I walked in.  So sad SushiWa!",

The prices aren't too high for what you get, and there's a good selection of different rolls, unlike some sushi restaurants whose rolls are all very similar (i.e. all filled with tempura shrimp or cream cheese). The service was good, although a little inefficient--our table was served by multiple people, so it was sometimes a little confusing who we should be asking for what. Still, everyone was fast, friendly, and attentive. The decor is simple and elegant, and we liked that there aren't too many TVs to distract you from your conversations. We love how convenient the location is to us, and we can't wait to go back for all you can eat sushi!",

We were both excited as we haven't been back for a minute.   Initially, I was going to order just a bento box with one salmon skin handrolls but, BF convinced me to do AYCE.  We order about 6 (4 spicy for him, 2 regular for me) salmon skin handrolls; and since they don't do half orders, we went light on ordering too much.  So, 3 specialty rolls, hamachi kama, and gyoza to start.   I got my handrolls and they were just as good as I remembered.  Then got the specialty rolls SMOTHERED in mayo...ugh, I forgot they like to sauce up their rolls.   BF got his 4 salmon skin handrolls and they were double the size of mines...I thought they put a lot of jalapeno in there. Turns out they STUFFED the roll with rice! Like, really...That's their game of making you full.  I mean, I've seen other sushi spots do this but, this place used a ridic amount of rice.  BF ate about half the rice for each roll and they leftover rice coulda made 2 specialty rolls.   The waitress picked up his plate with all the rice and showed the sushi chef.  I didn't see but, my BF said they were pointing, looking, and talking about him.  So disappointing as we were excited for our lunch and this just kinda ruined the mood/day.  Thankfully, they didn't try to charge us for that rice but, that is most def our last time there.  The sushi itself isn't anything to miss anyways.  So with that: BYE SUSHI WA!",

The waitresses are very nice and are always refilling your water and tea. The male waiter was pretty good looking lol. And very prompt. The food came out fast. They don't do half rolls, which is a bummer.  First things first. We got a miso soup, two cucumber salads, agedashi tofu, and two rounds of nigiri to start. The miso soup was huge and delish. The tofu was GINORMOUS and sweeter than any agedashi tofu I've ever had. Nonetheless, still tasty. The ikura was good. The salmon and yellowtail was also very thick, minimal rice, and fresh. The baby seared tuna was AMAZEEEE. The cucumber salad, I would avoid. Pretty tasteless.  We got a rose roll, which was again, huge. But okay. Lots of baby lobster and scallops. The superman roll was the hit. We loooove spicy garlic ponzu. It was delish! The pockey roll, or avocado lover was odd. Not what I was expecting at all. The jalapenos inside were pickled? Which I found odd. Fresh minced or deep fried would have made it better for sure. The bikini roll was also pretty yummy, this was a riceless roll.  All in all, a pretty good place to go. Definitely coming back for that superman burrito roll and try some more stuff.",

    "text": "My friend and I were looking to try out a new AYCE sushi place. Although Sushi Wa didn't have as high a rating on Yelp, my friend wanted to give it a try. There are so many sushi places on Eastern, almost too many options.   This place is adorable. It seems like a nice, high end sushi place. When we arrived there was basically no one in the place, but by about 20-30 minutes later and the place was pretty busy.  We both ordered AYCE and each started off with Baked Lasagna and Mussels. Mussels were pretty good but neither of us cared for the Baked Lasagna. I've had better at any other place I've been. There was a lot of cream cheese on top if that's your thing, I'm not that into it so I usually take half of it off. Regardless of that this roll doesn't compete with surrounding spots. There is definitely some kind of distinct, additional flavor being added and I'm not really into it. It wasn't bad, just not as good as other places I've been.   We also ordered the Fire Cracker ($6) and it really good. Equally as good as any other place I've ever had it. I highly recommend trying it. I don't think it's as spicy as it sounds, but there is definitely a kick to it. Popcorn Scallop was also pretty good. The sauces they served with it were ok.   Beef Teriyaki roll was ok. My friend liked it more than I did. I don't think I'm ready for a meat/sushi infusion yet.   Rose roll was pretty good, description says that it's a baked baby lobster on top of California roll with eel sauce. I'm not sure but that doesn't sound like what we got. It was a roll covered in a lot of stuff, I tasted scallops, there was definitely a really good creamy type sauce. This dish looked kind of messy, but as actually not that hard to eat. The only thing I didn't like about it was the red onion that was mixed on the top. They were pretty easy to remove but one snuck through on my last bite.   Screaming Orgasm was pretty good, but again I've had equal or better at other places.   My friend ordered the Las Vegas Roll, I didn't try it. 4 Kinds of fish, crabmeat, avocado all completely deep fried. It's not my thing. I don't mind some light tempura, but I'm more of a raw sushi kind of girl. I did try the sauce that was in the bowl because my friend didn't like how spicy it was. I usually like anything spicy, but this didn't have a great flavor.   So for my first visit here, I'd say it went ok. I mean I don't think I'll be rushing back here. I feel like I can get better value at any other place. The best thing about this place is the ambiance. Service was ok. Servers seems to be friendly, but also ambivalent. It's also one of the more expensive AYCE places that I've tried. I don't think that mixes too well with the level of deliciousness. Sushi quality seemed legit, but I also want quality flavor.",

I ordered 2 yellow tails and one bake mussels, the bake mussels came out at 2:45 and the sushi came out at 3:05am  I have been to many sushi spots and never in history have a chef took over 30 mins to make 4 pieces of sushi especially in an establishment that was SO EMPTY.. The chef was talking instead of working which I let it be known, he also look more Hispanic instead of Asian(I added that in there because I don't know his name).. He needs to be fired or cleaning, not cooking. He is talking over the sushi with one lady that was sitting at the bar about \"what she's doing this weekend\"  and he moves very very slowly....(maybe he need to learn how to multitask)? Again, I have never been to an empty sushi spot where the chef took over 30 mins to make 2 little yellowtail tuna not even in a busy one.  Oh and since it only takes about 2  mins to make two order of yellow tails, my mussels shouldn't have came out first... I am very mad I drove that far for all you can eat to deal with a slow incompetent chef! I paid for my soda and LEFT still hungry, I didn't eat anything because I was upset and lost my appetite",

All of the rolls are fresh and the presentation is impressive. I usually order Tuna sashimi to start which is always good here, but my favorite rolls are bikini, hawaiin, mango salmon roll. I finish off with Unagi Nigiri because the sweet eel sauce tastes more like a desert to me. Sushi Wa is also on the Uber Eats list and they give you a 10% coupon for your next in restaurant visit.

I also was pleased that they had gluten free soy sauce in an identifiable container. The sushi chef was fairly attentive until he got busy. This is where things began to take a turn. I ordered an Alaskan roll (salmon, crab, cucumber, asparagus and avocado -also the roll in the picture) it didn't come with the cucumber or asparagus. The avocado was barely there, when I mentioned this to the sushi chef he said \"sorry wonder been really busy and are out of a lot of stuff\" that would have been nice to know before giving me a roll missing a third of it's ingredients. My husband and I say idle for about 10 mom waiting for our check, server or someone to notice us. The other thing I was most disappointed with is that the \"green\" mussles were not green mussels and instead regular black mussels see the picture not a hint of green. They aren't even close to the right size either. I will still go back I just won't get rolls or other things.",

They have a bunch of sushi rolls with ingredients I haven't really seen in other places and their modern, intimate decor adds a really nice touch to the experience.  My favorite rolls include the rose, bikini, dragon, fried salmon, and fried scallop. Rose roll is pretty good because it isn't too saucy and the combination of scallops and mushroom is really good! Bikini roll doesn't have any rice since it is wrapped with a cucumber shell which provides a refreshing and healthy alternative to the other rolls. Dragon is a favorite for those who like eel and eel sauce on top of a california roll. The fried salmon roll is delicious because it is basically a sushi roll stuffed inside crispy salmon. Fried scallop is good too, imagine popcorn scallop on top of california rolls.   Service is really good: the staff refills your drinks periodically without you having to call them over and they are very polite. I would definitely recommend checking this place if you are within the area. The price is comparable to other AYCE places even if this place seems a bit fancier (at least on the inside)!",

Every dish I tried was super sweet and I didn't expect that. The only reason I give it 2 stars is because they were speedy. (Possibly  why quality was subpar).

She returned about 10min later with our order and took our specialty roll order. We waited almost 30 min for them to bring out our first two rolls. It then took 40 min for our kitchen order to come out. Food is great. Service behind the sushi bar sucks. We put in another round of sushi til orders. We have now sat there for almost an hour  and fifteen minutes and still have not received our second round of sushi rolls... wouldn't come back again.",

    "text": "it really is hard to find a sushi bar that pleases you in every way.  Some places have great sashimi, but so so rolls.  Some places have great rolls but horrible sides.  some places are just horrible.  Here at Sushi Wa - EVERYTHING is great - decor, service, dessert, rolls, sashimi, appetizer sides - even the water.   Though everything is great, I highly suggest:  -Screaming Orgasm - the best orgasm sauce ever!  not too sour like other places.  4 pieces of fish served atop radish noodles soaking in a bowl of their sauce.  only one per person for their AYCE dinner.  Don't think you can order one for yourself, and one for a friend, hoping that your friend won't like it, so you can have more than one.   because he will.  and so will the next friend after that.  and the next after that.   - Firecracker - a small piece of crispy wonton, a cube of tuna and a cube of avocado, drizzled in firecracker sauce - Rose Roll - baked roll with lobster, scallops, mushrooms, onions - Who's Your Daddy - cream cheese and crab meat and sweet mayo and shrimp and it's deep fried in panko and crispy - Ahi Poke Salad - a little spice by thats ok.  mixed with seaweed salad.    all in all, my sushi palette has never tasted sushi this good.",

They were not particularly busy when I went, which was surprising for a Friday night and we got good, attentive service. A lot of their rolls are very unique. Some of the rolls were phenomenal (like the pocky), but some of the flavor combinations and their sauces really did not work for me. I also got some nigiri where the fish did not taste fresh.   Overall, this place is a decent all you can eat option in Henderson but there are better places in other parts of the valley.",

    "text": "I came here for lunch because I have been craving sushi after passing on a trip with all the Yelpers. It has been some time since I came here, but it is close to home and I remembered liking this place a lot. A couple of years later, it is still good and they have AYCE. I sat down at the bar and did the AYCE lunch ($21.95) The restaurant was quiet, at noon, since they open at 11:30. Not too long after 1pm, people started to come in. That gave me a 45 minutes of my own personal sushi chef. I got the Spicy Sashimi Salad to start. It was light on the dressing, not too spicy, and overall delicious. It could use more heat, but the mound of greens, diakon, and seaweed was a plus. The Agedashi Tofu  had an odd taste or maybe too much flavor. I usually drink all the broth, but I left mine this time. The Shrimp and Sweet Potato Tempura was good. Spears of sweet potato were wrapped in shrimp, lightly battered, and fried. Simply perfect. I also like their Monkey Brains appetizer. Spicy tuna, cream cheese, shitake mushroom which they fry up tempura style before cutting into quarters and placed on their spicy and eel sauce.   All of the nigiri I got were good, but nothing mind blowing in flavor. I do like the attention to detail though. My Ika came out looking like a baby squid. The Unagi was also better because they took a torch to it after putting on the sauce to give a nice char. Sang has some nice knife skills.  I am a sucker for a Screaming Orgasm and must try it anywhere I go. I know saying I like their orgasm sauce because it is not too creamy is going to set me up for a razzing, but I don't care. It is True, because the sauce is more on the citrus side than on the mayo and I am fan. I finished my sushi course with a half order of this roll. I wished I saved more room or asked if I could get it as a salad, because it was my favorite. Ordering a half roll is like declaring a cease fire. Once the white flag is up, there is no more sushi to be had. Make sure you are ready to call it quits before asking for this. The chefs are upfront about it, but just a warning in case it slips their minds.  At the end of my meal, I got the banana tempura with green tea ice cream. I don't normally order tempura items at Japanese restaurants, but Sushi Wa does it so well.   The service was polite, attentive, and quick on refills of my green tea and water. I had an enjoyable lunch. There can be a wait if they get hit with too many eager AYCE diners, but patience is rewarded.",

Service staff was pleasant and attentive, but out of three chefs, there was only one who was pleasant, and he wasn't the one serving me. The menu was explained poorly. One order of sashimi per person, (huh?) and one order of sweet shrimp.. description that took much longer than necessary to get across. I had eaten the rest of my food (2 rolls, 3 different orders of sushi, the sashimi, and a couple of appetizers) and the sweet shrimp was MIA. The one pleasant chef, upon my inquiry, mentioned it was coming. But it felt like every time I spoke to my chef, I was bothering him. And what was his name? Well, according to their chef jackets, they were all named Joon Choi. The sweet shrimp came out right as I was asking about dessert. I had given up. To be fair, the quality of the fish was good. 4 stars for that. But there was so much more that was wrong. The rolls were poorly wrapped, the carrot in one of the rolls should have been thrown away. I had to pick it out! Seriously. I tried their Korean Bulgogi. Bad. Just Bad. And then... the sweet shrimp arrived. I. Have. Never. Had. Shrimp. This. Bad. I couldn't eat it. I asked for the red bean mocha. The waitress asked if I wanted it as I finished the rest of my food. When I indicated I was not going to do so, she told me they charged for pieces I didn't eat. I understand that policy is in place to keep down waste... but when I told her the food was undesirable, she didn't really say anything. In the end, they took it off my bill. But what a waste of a night of sushi! I ended up feeling full but  extremely dissatisfied. Never again.",

I recommend going in a group and all getting AYCE so that you can share and try more things without getting full on a single item. It is good quality, made to order sushi. They limit very few items, like you can only get one order sea urchin and of sashimi per person. I loved the Screaming Orgasm and the Pepper Seared Tuna sashimi, definitely getting those again. Appetizers are also included in the AYCE deal ($26 at dinner) which was a pleasant surprise - almost everything on the menu is unlimited. But leave room for desert because the AYCE also includes your choice of ice cream, mochi ice cream, tempura ice cream and banana tempura. I was stuffed but I couldn't resist tempura green tea ice cream.",

Another highlight was the chocolate mochi for dessert  :)  The service was excellent as well. The waitresses were all very funny and accommodating. They also were very good at moderating how often they came to the table with the next round of rolls so we were never overwhelmed by the amount of plates on the table.  Definently a great place for a good AYCE deal on sushi! Come if you're hungry for fresh fish at its best!",

Our waitress was very attentive, as were the other two men that were on staff. Some AYCE sushi places I have been to that have a time limit will let you order a few items and then just ignore you for a while to let the time pass before they can kick you out. This was not the case, they constantly checked on us and even when we were waiting for food we had ordered, they asked if we saw anything else we would like to order. They had great suggestions too. We had a few rolls, the superman burrito is a must try and the gyoza's were great. They had a large choice of cocktails and sake as well! Thanks for the great experience Sushi Wa staff, I will be back!",

Our waitress was so incredibly rude and recited the AYCE rules and time limits on top of trying to charge extra for things we've always gotten in the past. The halibut was disgusting. With no one in the restaurant you'd think they'd try and be accommodating to our party but it was exactly opposite. Won't be coming back here ever.",

I came in with folks that ate and left and i was still waiting for my order to go , rainbow roll and a sashimi  combo ,40min really? I had a hungry husband and a baby waiting for me . The food quality was really below average , avocado on top was brownish , my edamame  was falling apart coz it was over cooked , fish was small and not so trusty so I microvawed  my salmon and gave tuna to my cat  . Never again !",

    "text": "This place is definetly one of my favorite all you can eat sushi places that I go to. 2 of my favorite things that I ordered during my last visit was the pepper seared baby tuna and the baked mussels. Last night was my first time trying the pepper tuna, but when I tried the first one it was so good, I swear I ordered two more orders, it just melts in your mouth so nicely. As for the mussels. If you are a fan of baked mussels, you need to try theirs. One of my top two places to order mussels from. Most sushi places in Vegas has them either too burnt or the cheese that they use gives an odd taste, but Sushi Wa's is perfect. Also ask for Jenny if she's working. I haven't really bothered to make any reviews about this place, but she was the best server I've had there so far. Very friendly and constantly checked up on us to see if there's anything else she can get us (we are A LOT) thanks again Jenny! :)",

From the very beginning while ordering our food on AYCE, he stated \"this is a lot of food\" he made us feel right away that we are \"too much\". (We are eating sushi AYCE almost 3x a week so we know what we can eat and we know what we want..  Secondly, im surprised with the sushi theres a lot of RICE and very thin fish.. And the sashimi you can only order one..almost seems like they actually prepared it with more rice on the fact that we ordered a lot..   third, he is watching us like we are criminals eating sushi, hes like the walking camera which is so annoying!!!! He likes to question us every time we are making an order.. Like \"are you sure?\"  I don't think ill be coming back here.. The food taste good tho and the place was really nice, the other staff seems very friendly and nice but MARK..",

Decided to go for the all you can eat $26.95.  We were told she couldn't because the sashimi she ordered wasn't part of the deal.  Expressed my frustration because we TOLD him we were thinking of that option.  The manager gave her approval though we had to pay $9 for the appetizer.  Things were going well. The food was quite slow coming out of the kitchen and we were not getting plates at the same time.  It was throwing off the tempo of the meal.   We were talking and then the waiter decides to tell us that we will be charged for any food left on the plate.   We did NOT over order. It was that he brought 2 plates out at the same time.  Then after we expressed our irritation with him. The manager came over again and said, \"I see you are really trying.\"  Gee thanks, so you won't charge me MORE money.  Left there spending $80.00.

    "text": "Everything about this place was ehh. We won't be returning or recommending.  We get there when the place first opened, and upon walking in I'm thinking that because it looks nice, we'll probably have a really good experience here. Yeah, not so much.  It took the waitress a few minutes to acknowledge us after she gave us the menu to get our drink orders. Upon returning to take our order, there's like 30 thousand rules that are already listed in the menu, but the waitress decided she had to make sure we knew. I know that with AYCE sushi, you're supposed to finish your food or they say they will charge you so that people don't just order a bunch of stuff to waste. So when we're ordering the waitress made sure to tell us we needed to finish all of our food eor we would be charged.   Another issue we had was when we tried to order, everything we wanted, like plain roll were on the dinner menu. Don't get me wrong, I don't mind paying dinner price for AYCE sushi during dinner, but it was lunch. This lunch ended up costing 70 bucks with tip.    The food was meager. The sashimi was good, but nothing spectacular. The screaming orgasm was really good along with the peppered tuna. Philadelphia roll was very plain. The shrimp tempura roll my bf said tasted \"super fishy.\" The Japanese lasagna was delicious.  Cucumber salad was bland. Ice cream was ice cream.  The waitress did, however, keep refilling my bf's soda without having to be asked. Which was nice. Usually, drinks are ignored. Here, it wasn't.  This place is very close to home, so we were hoping we could find another neighborhood favorite, but I guess it's back to SushiMon.",

With that being said, the service at this place was terrible. I understand when call-outs happen or being understaffed, but there is no sense of urgency in either the Cook or our waiter. First we ordered our appetizers, and when we noticed that they were taking a little bit longer to come out, we asked the waiter if we could place our order for our roles. He responded give me just a second, and then took 20 minutes to come over and take our order. We ordered three different rolls at one time and it took 30 minutes for them to come out because they serve them one at a time. Then we look over to the sushi chef and watch him having a conversation with which I assume is the dishwasher, and he is taking his sweet time and continually touching his earphones in his ear with his gloves on and then touching the rolls that he's making. He was more interested in his conversation with the person that he was talking to then he was making sure that the rolls went out in a timely fashion, or in the order that they were ordered. We ended up canceling our last roll because after sitting at the table for an hour and 15 minutes, and only having two rolls, needless to say we ran out of patience . All in all I would not return to this establishment. There were plenty of other sushi places in town that care about the people that come in.",

I also saw the cook touch his air pods multiple times with his gloves on and go back to touching other peoples food. We received one roll at a time even though we put in our 3 roll order 30 minutes ago, in between him making our rolls, he would make other peoples orders between our order and those customers just came in.

Very few items are limited or not included.   This place is consistent in quality of fish and service. Its simply not worth the money and time to attempt a match at any other sushi restaurant within the Las Vegas area. I've tried; and been disappointed each time.

The eel had a lot of bones in it, the salmon was was too fishy tasting to where we couldn't even eat it, the Uni was very brown (although the waitress explained that it had to do with the time of year), overall the quality of the food is just ok.

My server/waitress had not taken my order correctly and did not admit to her mistake. I told her many times and had asked her please do not put Tuna in the many assorted fishes in my roll of sushi and she said oh yes the chef will simply just out more of one of the other kinds of fish. That seems like it was ordered easily and understood. Then she had mentioned many of the other dishes and rolls I had ordered alsoi had tuna but they were spicy tuna...They were different because they are slightly cooked and not if the same texture I said those are Ok. I'm fine with those. So then when the meal came to the table I told them the order was,taken wrong they admitted fault and asked if they could make a new one we said no we didn't want to order a new one because we were full already. Then when time came to pay they said those were considered left overs. They wanted to charge as left overs.  How ridiculous? Also ayce is only allowing 1sashimi per person. That's really not ayce  then.   There are so many restrictions for the price we pay. They expect us to eat sushi with the fish so that we get full quick. What a scam.   They want to charge if there is even 1piece of food left on a plate. How ridiculous.  This us what management had told me when I needed to speak with manager because he wanted to back up his worker.    This restaurant does not know how to guide the customer on ordering the right things on the menus and letting customers know the rules in the restaurant. Don't assume the customers know they have to clean the plates.   Buffets ayce don't expect people to eat everything off there plates.   You ridiculous restaurant.  Frozen Salmon.  Not so fresh salads. Seasoning is so spicy Mayonaise is so sour. How can you expect us to eat all if the food is not great.  Please get better chefs.",

We will not be returning due to the horrible service we received last night. Rude, inattentive, rolling eyes at us when we ordered multiple items. Refusing to even offer suggestions for the kids we had with us when we asked for rice and shrimp he shook his head no (we all know they serve rice!) We only got half the things we ordered and when we asked where they were he told us we never ordered it (we clearly did). Told a member of our party who came in late she couldn't order yet because it will confuse the chef. Put all of our desserts at the end of the table making us pass them out our selves. Very disappointing night for our out of town guest from NYC. We won't be returning. Kaizen across the street is our new place now.",

The host/ waiter was not very welcoming and the entire experience was ruined from the start.  Very poor service from the waiter.  I felt very uncomfortable throughout the night because he truly did begin the dining experience by being aggressive and not helpful (with suggestions, etc.).  It was my first time eating at his restaurant and certainly the last.  Maybe the food was fantastic but I am having a really hard time overlooking the horrible service aspect of the dining experience.    The biggest restaurant sin is when a waiter or waitress attempts to be nice(r) and/ or genuinely friendly towards the end of the dining experience.  Perhaps, that is a way of securing a good feedback, gratuity or a future visit?...  Nah, neither one was warranted because the service was such a disappointment at sushi wa.    I will never discourage anyone from trying this place.  Some of the dishes (especially the uni) were fantastic.  I will, however, caution to potential customers to be aware that the service can be rated a 0 out of 10.  Sometimes a balance of great food and excellent customer service is the best way of attracting and retaining customers... Tonight, I am walking away from sushi wa.  That's okay though... They seem to be doing well, anyways.",

    "text": "This place is just okay in my opinion. A friend's birthday promoted my 2nd and probably last visit here. I had been here one other time, and thought it was just okay, but I like to give a place the benefit of the doubt before I decide whether or not it is worth coming back. The second visit confirmed I will probably not be back.  There were 6 of us and the service started out good. We were given waters and menus and after a short while we ordered at least a dozen rolls and appetizers between the table. I was surprised at how quickly the first round of food came out. The rolls were just okay, some better than others for sure. My favorites were the Superman Burrito and the Japanese Lasagna. One thing I don't like is they are very heavy handed with the sauces. They are not very flavorful and don't complement the rolls as a sauce should. I like to taste the fish and not have it covered up with sauce. I also don't like the batter that they use for their deep-fried rolls, but that is no fault of theirs, that is just my personal preference.   Anyway after the first round we didn't see our server for a looooong time. We asked whoever we could flag down to get him to come to our table, but he was no where to be found. He finally emerged and we ordered more food. He was a nice guy, I just wish he came around more often. I enjoyed dessert the best. I got the banana tempura which comes with 6 pieces of fried banana, a scoop of vanilla ice cream and chocolate sauce. That was deeeelicous. They also have tempura ice cream, regular ice cream and mochi. Bonus points for having coffee flavored mochi :) I probably wouldn't come back here. It's on the other side of town from me, and I just don't particularly care for many of their items.",

Well I guess tonight was just \"too busy\" for good service. Our server was nice but I think she might have had to many tables. She rarely came back to ask how we were doing. When we wanted to order she told us to wait until our other 2 rolls were out so when she finally allowed us to order we sat for 25 min waiting for our food. We also asked if we could have a poki roll with only crab meat and avacodo and the manager said the were not taking special orders because they were again \"too busy\" I should take a picture but it's really not that busy. Haven't even had a wait for the hour and a half we have been here. To say the least we will not be returning. I feel like for $150 we should be able to order what we want. But obviously at sushi wa they don't care.",

    "text": "Came here for a Meetup event with the I Love Sushi group.  We had a fairly large party, and we ended up placing a huge order right from the start as every one was marking down what they want on the order sheet without much group coordination. We were warned about not ordering too much, but as a group we failed to heed the manager's warning.  So a lot of food was prepared and served almost on top of each other.  Anyway, at the end of the meal Chef Joon (owner) came to speak to us, and said that they do their best to make the best food they can for the customers, but when they get a huge order they will rush it and may not be able to put as much attention as they normally would like, so it is better to order slowly for the best food.  Plus they do not skim for their AYCE customers, and the rolls were larger than we were accustomed to at AYCE sushi restaurants.  The restaurant itself was beautiful.  You can tell someone invested a lot of time and other resources into the design and the final look of the restaurant.  It is very modern and artistic look to it, which pairs well with the beautiful food served.  The lighting is fairly bright, so you can enjoy the food visually before savoring it with your other senses. Plus it almost feels like you are eating in a modern art museum, or a restaurant within one, since it is roomy!!! and you are not crammed in there like 7 Vienna Sausages in a can.   We ordered a wide range of items from their AYCE menu, which is practically their entire menu (with some exclusions).  Below are the highlights and my personal recommendations:  APPETIZERS:  Monkey Brain (basically spicy tuna and cream cheese stuffed in mushroom and tempura fried) - small enough to eat solo or share with up to 4 ppl. Soft Shell Crab - Tempura fried and delicious. Served san rice makes it even better (more room in the tummy for other awesome food, plus it is low carbs!)  SALADS: Tuna Poki Salad - good portions.  ROLLS: Crunch Albacore - looks good, and tastes great. Mango Salmon Roll - sweetness from the mango just pairs well with the salmon. Energy Roll - one of the deep fried rolls, great flavor, especially if you like unagi (eel). Tiger Roll - They make a good version of this popular roll.  NIGIRI: Uni, Super White Tuna, Ama Ebi were all good and they do not skimp on these just because you ordered AYCE, so you get a nice proportion of fish to rice. And most importantly the fish were fresh! Pepper Seared Baby Tuna - big fan of this!  HONORABLE MENTION: Superman Burrito (Shrimp Tempura, Soft shell Crab, Tuna, Salmon, Yellowtail with special spicy Garlic sauce) - it is a ginormous roll, be sure to bring a lot of hungry friends, or you will not get to try too many other items on the menu.  Sushi Wa offers lunch specials and 1/2 price sushi menu offers from 11:30am-3pm and dinner specials from 6-9pm, which you can check out on their website. <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sushiwavegas.com%2Fmenus.html&s=644705ed0f854d2e85b53b8268a56f1792e6e8fb2110e7d423f940a9b24f9b47\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">sushiwavegas.com/menus.h...</a>  If you live near here, be sure to get their frequent visitor/loyalty card.  In hindsight I should have picked up one of these, as I am going back to Sushi Wa next week.  The staff here are nice, and checks up on their guests frequently.  Our drinks were frequently refilled.  And as I have mentioned earlier, Chef Joon (the owner) even came and spoke to us at the end of our meal.    The restaurant is located in the SE part of Las Vegas (Henderson), where there are also a lot of other really good AYCE Sushi restaurants nearby and unfortunately for me a little far (by Vegas standards), but I think it is worth the drive or if you happen to be in the area.  Decor: 5/5 I love the look of the restaurant. Ambiance: 4.5/5  Very nice Food: 4/5  I found some favorites already, while others I am glad that I have tried and will likely pass up in order to try other items. Service: 4/5  Good. Location: Worth checking out if you have your own transportation for out of town visitors.  Otherwise cab fare will be more than the price of the meal.  Solid 4 stars.  Plus it is still a hidden gem (even though they have been open for a few years already), as you don't have to wait a long time for seats compared to some other well-known AYCE sushi restaurant in the area.",

The service was fine, though there were a few odd moments and they forgot to bring a few things. I ended up ordering the AYCE sushi, not because I was that hungry, but because the individual roll prices are so high (most around $13) that you have already hit the AYCE price once you have ordered two. I found the roll selection pretty much standard with a few surprises, but there was something off with all the things I ordered. I couldnt tell quite what it was, but I have a feeling the fish wasnt the freshest. There was that slightly bitter aftertaste that you get from fish that has been sitting around just a little too long.  Overall Sushi Wa was decent, but there are several other better AYCE places around town that I would prefer to spend $26.",

As the Mr. said, Sushi Wa's fish is super fresh. They cut nice thick pieces of Yellowtail. Their sashimi plates are creative and delicious too.   If this were my restaurant, I'd remove the TV from behind the chef station but, otherwise, the Asian decor takes me to another country, far away from the strip mall this restaurant actually resides in.

Pricing for AYCE is like anywhere else, but they do offer sashimi with AYCE, but limited to one order per person. And the Pepper Seared Tuna, yum!! And the yellowtail.... mmmm  The service, though, definitely lacking. The 2 times I have been there has been on quite nights, with only 3-4 other tables, but yet still takes forever to greet the table. Okay okay, so we usually have 8-12 people and we order a lot, but we make it easy for the servers cause I do all the ordering and I keep it organized. But she had troubles getting all the orders, and some of the orders never made it out, and some got confused, etc.   But they got uni, amaebi, raw oysters, soft shell crabs (very small orders, but no limit), and the superman roll was good too. I usually don't go for many rolls cause they fill me too quick, but they are good! And handrolls... at first they were amazing, but after the first order, we ordered 6 more hand rolls and they went cheap on the fish!  Still, a good place to dine, if you have the time. Good and simple decor, TV at the bar for sports, and fresh quality fish. I recommend this place to lots of friends and family. Had the commute not been so bad, I'd be here every week. Well, maybe in the winter when I don't have to watch my weight.",

And especailly great for an all you can eat sushi bar! Much better quality than the best buffets on the strip. The service was stellar. Manager Geo and server Mark made sure we were all taken care of!   There are rules to the all you can eat sushi, so you need to plan well to get a nice variety of sushi. You need to finish all your sushi, or they will charge you, so don't over order. Even if you get a few rolls, it's totally worth it. You even get an amazing dessert. I recommend the tempura banana!

Too bad you can only have one per person if you're doing ayce. And here's the negative part why I'm only giving them 3 stars...service was mediocre at best. Server is rushing to drop plate on the table and by the time she says what the food was she's gone and they are not even busy! Our orders were wrong and our drinks were not filled for the last hour and had the balls to tell my husband he can't order drinks after we paid. Menu needs a lot of work. I don't think we'll come back.",

    "text": "I don't say this often (sad to say because a friend of mine swears this is the best Sushi place now in the Las Vegas area), but this is the worse sushi buffet/place I have ever been to. Maybe it was because it was lunch time, but everything stunk!  First of all, there are limitations to the buffet, like one of each poke salad, dessert, etc. In addition, uni, sweet shrimp, oysters were only offered at dinner time. They also don't have sashimi for lunch time. After seeing this, I had a second thought of maybe leaving because my hubby already had several things marked off of his \"must-have\" list at a sushi place, but I decided to stay.  After ordering a few sushi/nigiri, the waitress asked us if we were \"sure\" we wanted to order all of this because there was 16 pieces for the both of us. Keep in mind, we haven't even started eating yet. Ok, I guess she doesn't get customers that eat a lot of sushi?  Again, we just brushed it off, and said we still wanted it.  When we got our sushi, I was disgusted. The raw fish was breaking apart already (most likely 2-3 days old), wasn't as cold, and the rice also wasn't as sticky. Ewwww! Gross.   The best part of the lunch was probably the mochi, and the banana tempura with green tea ice cream dessert I had them make for me.  Don't go here unless you really have to.",

    "text": "... Where to start... I first tried sushi wa based on some awesome reviews I read and really wanted to find a place in Henderson that can be my Togo place... Well when I arrived I was immediately told to try the tuna because it was fresh well this was sad because it was far from fresh so I began to try things that they didn't recommend and I ended up having a good meal the freshest fish that day was the super white tuna.. So I only killed 2 baby cockroaches on the sushi bar table that day and despite the not so fresh fish I decided to go again and take a friend the next week... Because I liked their dynamite and mussles  We had a sushi chef named waldo .. Waldo seemed to have a bad attitude and didn't like the fact that we Ordered a lot of food in fact one order he doubled the portion saying we ordered two orders instead of one which I know I wouldn't have ordered two orders ... Also I found out that they charge you if you order fresh wasabi I had it last time I was there and when I ordered it today they said there would be a charge come to find out I was charged for it last time but was not told so watch out ...  Now to the worse part of this meal there... I ordered the super white tuna and ate the first piece quickly I swallowed everything when I should have spit it out.... The fish was rank and bad and didn't even smell right I pointed this out to Waldo who smelled it and told me there was nothing wrong with it ... I asked his sushi chef friend to smell it himself and that guy said it was bad and apologized....   It's now Monday evening and I'm finally over the terrible bout of food poisoning That overtook me for the past 3 days since .. I'm finally eating solid foods rather then chicken broth and burnt toast... I never ever want this to happen again ... I believe that sushi wa does not keep fresh fish or quality control as I've read a lot more reviews about their quality issues.. Needless to say I will never eat here again nor will I recommend you eat here either I will also tell everyone I know about my ailment and 3 days of bed rest acquired from their poor quality control performance",

    "text": "I'm sad for 3 reasons.  1. Sushi Wa is a far drive from my residency and from work.  But because my friends raved about this place, I really wanted to take the time and drive to try it.  2. My favorite kind of sushi which is the simple Salmon Sake Nigiri was laid on top of a super huge portion of rice and more importantly, the fish was NOT fresh.  HUGE disappointment!  3. My favorite roll which is the spicy tuna over crispy fried rice here was bland!  The fish looked like it has been out for days and they don't use fresh jalapeno?  Makes no sense.  I was a bit disgusted.  I also had their Yellowtail Nigiri; also not fresh.  I tried their garlic edamame; no taste and not even a hint of garlic.  When you say there is going to be garlic in a dish, I better taste it.  It's as if they like they completey forgot the ingredient and it's in the freakin' name.  Boo!  Then, I had their Ultimate Garlic Tuna Roll...and THUN THUN THUN.....again, no taste of any garlic.  The roll even sits on a bowl of soup that only makes it even worse because the soup base doesn't taste like anything but yuck.  I couldn't believe my dismay!  The one star goes to one appetizer: Fried Oysters, and one roll: Volcano roll.  The volcano roll was a little too much on the saucy side that if I had to finish it myself, I would feel guilty for my because of all the mayo clogging up my heart valves.  But because it had sauce, it was the only roll that had any flavor.  This was a huge disappointment.  Not only the taste, but the fish wasn't fresh.  Fresh comes first!  The wait  staff though was really nice, and the place is decorated nicely; kind of too fancy though.  Also, they over do the food presentation.  They need to work on the food taste rather than the presentation.  Just because something looks good, does not mean it tastes good.     I'll end on a positive note though.  They do have coffee mochi for dessert.  Not many AYCE sushi places have this mochi flavor.    If my friends convince me to go back to try their orders, I don't know.  Because the fish might still be from today.",

Sushi rolls and appetizers have zero flavor and they love to serve things one at a time with a 5-8 minute wait time in between each entree as well as use tons or rice to get us full much faster.  As for the service, the lady at the door wasn't very pleasant but our server was nice.  Doubt we'll ever come back.  Goyemon seems to be at the top of our list and the best ayce sushi restaurant by far.",

I am a sushi lover and have been to VERY expensive sushi restaurants all over the US.   Obviously, fresh fish is the most important criteria for finding good sushi!    Sushi Wa goes the distance in this catagory.  Believe me, if it isn't fresh, I'd know!  Sushi Wa provides a very nice ambiance in their restaurant.   Semi circular booths and tables are all very comfortable.  If you want one of the booths, come early or see if you can arrange for a reservation before heading out to eat.  What is fabulous here, is the all you can eat menus for lunch and dinner.   Yes, they have rules, but the wait staff was very good in helping us with our choices and explaining the rules to us.   I thought the rules were very fair and simply created to stop people from ordering food they weren't going to waste!    Seems logical to me!  The sushi is amazing!    The presentation is superb!      Cons:   I would like to see the people who bus the tables do a better job of cleaning off the tables!      Sushi can be messy, and the tables need extra care in cleaning them.  Believe me when I say, \"I'll be back!\"",

SIN CITY SUSHI - sit at the bar.  better service. better sushi. better experience.",

    "text": "WA WA WA.  Yep, every time I passed Sushi Wa, I promised myself I would never eat there.  Why?  Because I had eaten there for lunch one day with the wife and mother in law.  I found the food was average at best.  However, one of my kids friends from 808 said that this was one of his fav places so I said, okay what the heck....  So, on a Saturday night about 8:30 pm, I came here with my young son who has never had real sushi before, only the western style sushi...  a.  Ambiance - We sat at the bar, which I never do due to larger crowds and we want to have conversation.  The bar is the best place here to sit. Everywhere else seems a bit too \"cold\".  but the bar is really simple and comforting at same time.   b.  Service - Very, very good.  Attentive to our needs, mostly Korean speaking, but basic Japanese words are discussed.  Small amounts of rice, that is cool!  c.  Food - here is where it is amazing:  a. Tobico - Flying Fish Roe with squid ink to a black caviar style look.  what a cool dish. Tasty and unique.  b. Amai Ebi - Here the sweet shrimp was perfect and the fried shrimp heads were suckilicious.  Meaning I  was sucking and chewing on these fried heads like it was fried chicken!  Yummy.  c.  Maguro - I always ask for Maguro with a sliver of lemon and jalapeno I did not get this here when I ordered it. Instead of a sliver of lemon, with the rind and all, I got a peeled lemon with the meat only and sprinkled with shavings of jalapeno.  this was AMAZING  d.  Uni - Fresh, awesome texture.  My young son ate it too!  That says it all.  e. Breakdown - OK, broke down and had a Dragon Roll, the quintessential westernized plan for sushi.  even this was good and I was most impressed.  This place is my newest and most favorite sushi place in the 89052 area code.",

Usually we order the all you can eat sushi which in and of itself is amazingly priced and encompassingly delicious. Everything from the udon to the seemingly endless list of rolls. But Last night my girlfriend and I decided to try something new: Omakase.  For those of you who are unaware, Omakase in Japanese roughly translates to \"I leave it to you.\" Meaning the chef has free reign to give you whatever they think you'll love and you as the customer must have full faith in the chef that they will provide you with a meal that won't be forgotten.  Joon blew us away with amazing attention to detail. The fish he used literally fell apart in our mouths before we even started to chew and the flavorful combinations this 15 year veteran delivered to us were nothing short of daring and delicious. If you have the budget for it, I would highly recommend that you try Omakase from Joon, you won't regret it and I'm positive it isn't the last time I will do so either. (Oh and don't forget to tip your chef with some Mu Sake after the meal!)   Bravo.",

My dragon roll looked like there was barely any unagi on top and the shrimp tempura was so small I couldn't taste it.  The salmon skin salad needs help.. just doesn't look like anything, random veggies put together and the salmon skin tasted like some other fish since it was way over cooked and cut so small....  The sushi was all very good and again service was awesome. I would definitely come back but I know what not to order and what to order.  Ya feel me? Oh plus I appreciate how late it is open!",

    "text": "I'm assuming this place is better during dinner time?!?   My daughter and I came in for lunch before hitting TJoes across the street. I've never been here until today. When you walk in it is quite impressive, tall half round booths, dark rich colors and a hip atmosphere. We were seated right away by friendly staff.  We decided to go with the lunch box and a couple of rolls. I opted for the salmon for my lunch bento. I highly recommend NOT getting the salmon with your lunch box. Apparently, \"cooking\" fish isn't their thing. It was a flimsy piece of salmon but it was the $9 lunch box so I get it. But did they have to overcook it? The edges were hard and dry, thank god for the teriyaki sauce. The tempura was tempura, the rice was rice and the California rolls were California rolls, no biggie.   What I found interesting and cost efficient was placing shredded iceberg lettuce underneath the mixed greens. Did I sign up for that? As Cher said on Clueless, it's like a Monet. From a distance it's pretty but when you get up close, it's a mess. It's not word for word but you get my point.   Then after we were finished, our soup arrived?!? Our server forgot.  I'm going to leave the review on the rolls alone. Just look at the pictures.",

Was very pleased with great service,  great sushi and some excellent green tea. I had spider roll, mango salmon roll and veggie tempura. The spider roll was one of the tastiest I have ever had. The crab was just perfect and fresh. So was the mango and salmon on the other.  Very fresh tasting. The vegetable tempura was also very fresh tasting and not overcooked or over fried.  If you like green tea,  try this one, you will be pleased. Best of service by waiter and sushi chef. I Would recommend this restaurant if you want fresh and tasty sushi.   They also had lots of other options for people that don't like sushi, including bento boxes, teriyaki and traditional Japanese.  If I lived here I would visit regularly. Keep up the good job!",

Fire cracker and the scallops were AMAZING! My family and I had 2 orders each of these appetizers YUM YUM!  Spicy garlic edamame is terrible, dry and ours looked wrinkly. Pimp my roll was okay. Masago was yummy. Miso was perfect. Red bean was good. So overall a decent sushi experience. Service was quite fast and my only complaints are that the special rolls don't seem very creative and the spicy garlic edamame is really bad. The appetizers are beyond fantastic and the nigiri is decent.  This is a pretty good place for sushi.  Will come again mainly for the fire cracker and scallops!",

    "text": "My girl and I were coming back from a film screening and it was already 10PM. We weren't feeling like getting fast food so we jumped on the yelp and found a couple of places that were open late past 10pm.  As a rule of thumb we don't like to eat at any restaurant especially a sit down restaurant when it's 30 mins to closing. From our experience the food quality isn't as good, the staff wants to go home, and the overall service can be less than standard.  Well it turns out Sushi Wa stays open till 4am. WTH? Who does that em' I right? So we dropped in to give it a shot.  We went on a Wednesday and the place was empty except for 2 other dining parties. We were seated immediately. The interior ambiance is best described as on the darker/dimly lit side. I guess it's to make things seem romantic, but I didn't care for it. I prefer a brighter setting so I can see my food and the menu easier. My weary old eyes aren't what they used to be.  The menu has alot of rolls, noodles, and bento box options. They also have all you can eat (AYCE) with specific items designated only order once meaning you can only order that particular item once. They don't want you scarfing down the super expensive sashimi and premium goodies too many times. This is typical in an AYCE sushi place as Yama Sushi and Goyemon (the two AYCE sushi joints I typically frequent) do the same.   We weren't feeling super hungry so we went with their Teriyaki Bento Box meals. We got one with the Tonkatsu and one with Salmon Teriyaki. They were both identical in content except one had pork and one had salmon. Overall the bento was pretty tasty with the shrimp and veggie tempura, miso soup, salad, rice and california roll. Everything tasted good, but wasn't extraordinary. We had the teriyaki on the side so the grilled salmon was un-sauced and pretty tasty on its own.  Overall I'd give Sushi Wa another visit because the food is decent and more importantly it's open super late. 4am late. Nothing good ever comes about around 2am, but if you manage to survive till 3am then you might as well get some Japanese food if you're in the area.",

Juan is knowledgeable about the menu and easy to talk to. Always checking in to see how full you are and if you want more to eat. Thank you for having larger mussels! They are a decent enough size now where you can eat less to satiate that craving, while also having a good mussels-to-toppings proportion. I do wish they raised the order allowance for sashimi in AYCE. You are only allowed one order (about 4 pieces) for one fish type! And for someone who could care less for seaweed and rice, you're better off doing one of their sashimi platters that ranges in prices depending on number of pieces.",

    "text": "WORST SUSHI EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE!!  we came around 11pm because we were craving some sushi and ramen. We got spicy tuna tempura roll, energy tempura roll, screaming O roll and green baked mussels.  The mussels were actually good, but the energy roll had way too much too it and we couldn't even finish it, halfway through I started gagging, there was something about it that did not taste good at all. The spicy tuna was decent but it was really spicy compared to the other spicy tuna I've had before. And the screaming O tasted extremely spicy and the fish tasted off. The waitress only came to top off our waters twice, which I  kinda get since she was the only waitress working there. The manager however stayed in the back the whole damn time when he could of been helping, he did nothing to help out at all which pissed me off even more.  It took us 30 minutes to even get our Check. I have never left a restaurant more angry and disgusted until now. I will never be recommending this place to anyone OR be coming back here, you guys f***ing SUCK. Please for the love of god DO NOT COME HERE!",

    "text": "Sushi Wa isn't the top option for AYCE but they're good enough to get regular visits. We can always walk right in when our go-to spot is busy. The sushi is consistent as is the service for us.  With plenty of seating, including some high back booths for privacy, there is rarely a wait here. On busy nights, they'll have two to three servers running the floor with male manager/owner that's doing all the seating, running food, and helping out with take out. I've noticed two servers that are consistently there, with frequent turnover with the other servers which may lead to an occasional inconsistency with service depending on who is there.  The AYCE menu is pretty standard with your regular lineup of nigiri and hot apps. Some of the hot tapas aren't that impressive such as the soft shell crab and pork belly and I would suggest you steer clear of to save room for sushi. I usually don't make it to the rolls, but when I'm there with friends the do prefer rolls, they have decent list of interesting and unique ones. For the non sushi eaters, the bento boxes are a good value with Korean BBQ short ribs being the favorite of my wife.  Pricing is $23/$27 for lunch/dinner with super late hours for the night owls. Some people get their panties all bunched up over non Japanese owned sushi joints. But for me, you can come from Mars and have an extra arm coming out of the top of your head, as long as you can make sushi rice and can place a fresh piece of fish neatly on top of it, I'm a fan and you'll get my business.",

    "text": "My friend is a sushi enthusiast and raves about this place so I decided to give it a try! I think Sushi Wa has THE BEST rolls and I normally don't go for rolls when we get AYCE sushi. Each roll was so flavorful and really well put together. I usually always go for nigiri and overall, I think nigiri here was okay. However, the peppered seared tuna is amazing and I haven't seen that particular nigiri at any other sushi place. My friends also said that their uni was really good. I wasn't able to try too many of their appetizers but they all looked good and I look forward to trying those next time!  The only thing I didn't really understand was that they said they started a timer and I believe the limit to dine is about 1.5-2 hours. But at the time we came in it was not busy at all and so I felt a little rushed. Also, if we put in an order we weren't allowed to put in another order until everything on the previous order came out which I felt really delayed our dinner. Towards the end of our meal we were planning on ordering a few more items but our server was already asking for our dessert orders so we assumed our time was coming to an end.",

It has only gotten better over the years. Straight up, you need to get the all you can eat and immediately order a dozen garlic tuna's, it will change your life. Also make sure to get the screaming O right off the bat because you can keep the sauce around and dip the other items you get for the rest of your meal. The salmon sashimi is soooooo buttery.  Seriously can't go wrong here! Love this place",

    "text": "This is my second time here, not by choice but because the other sushi place was closed.    But my first time here I thought that this place was just okay.  Decent, but okay.  I didn't like that they didn't have half orders and the sauteed calamari was INSANELY INSANELY salty.  Other than that the servers where nice and service was great in general and the food was good as well.    My second time around, I kind of enjoyed it a lot more.  I think because we had my brother with me and he would finish whatever we didn't finish which allowed me to try more rolls.  Plus, if it weren't for the table across from us and me asking what they were having I would have not know of the other rolls.  I saw the other table with a no rice sushi roll which I didn't see on the menu the first time.  Maybe the rolls need to be sectioned off so you can tell from the no rice or deep fried rolls. Or maybe because the menu look so busy with words like \"NOT A.Y.C.E\" and the numerous sections that I didn't pay too much attention to the ingredients in the rolls and/or how its prepared.  The way some things are worded on the menu confused me too when it came to the Sashimi part.  It sounds like I can have one of each time in that section one time but its not the case.  The servers this go around where awesome again.    So with that being said, I wouldn't mind coming back.  Happy Eatings!",

The beginning of April I pre ordered my role at probably 2am, and when I got there I stood there at least 5 minutes before being acknowledged.    This late at night I usually let service pass because I'm just greatful I can get food so late.  However,  the rolls are not cheap if you are doing Al la carte rather than doing all you can eat.  The fish and execution are on not high enough to merit those prices.   It seems artificially inflated to get you to choose the option of gorging yourself all night.     The roll I got was bland,  it was wrapped in cucumber, and the decorative cucumber on the side was not even cleaned. I rubbed my finger on it and dirt came off....if this is what you offer who would want all you can eat.",

The waitress was not helpful, nice or attentive to our needs. I understand you already know that you're getting an 18% auto gratuity but it does not create cause for bad service. We like to eat a lot and it means 3 or 4 rounds of ordering. We had to keep flagging the servers to put in additional orders. She didn't ask how we wanted to split the bill or provide eye contact as we were hoping to get another dessert round since it wasn't limited.   The meal was $28 each for AYCE which some items were included and others not. I really liked the nigiri and sashimi as well as the other dishes but it's not enough in a service based city.  We will not be coming back to Sushi Wa or recommending it to anyone. The location had a trendy look and feel when you walk in. Music was loud playing with hip hop music, it was a low lighting environment and the part that bothered someone in our party was that we were told to put the menus on the floor for more table space which means dirty menus in our hands.",

Sure certain restaurants (starts with a T ends with odai and the other place starts with an M and ends with akino) serve AYCE sushi and sashimi but the quality's poor.  Although there's a limit to how much sashimi you can order at Sushi Wa, you're guaranteed to have fresh fish that looks and tastes superb. It's a 20+ miles away from where I love but it's worth it.

The amount of rice they pack into the Nigiri sushi. I'm not one to fuss about eating the rice. I enjoy it quite a bit but this place over did it.  Some of the sauces were terrible and do not belong on the Nigiri that I was ordering.   The jalapenos on my sushi were dark forest green, pickled and cut to the same diameter as the canned ones you put on a ball park hot dog. Gross!    This was the worst sushi I've had in town.   This place could be excellent if they would just use proper recipes and ingredients.",

Ayce sushi usually means a little bite of fish on a huge chunk of rice but not here. The fish is usually ample and so amazingly fresh! My favorites have to be the salmon and garlic tuna! They also have a great selection of rolls that do not leave you wishing you had gone somewhere else. The superman roll is by far my most favorite roll of the restaurant then the screaming o roll! Those two rolls are what keep me coming back time and time again! So if I were to rate this place on just the quality of the sushi and the rolls it would definitely be a 5 star place but unfortunately there's another part to the stars which is service. The wait staff is awesome some are more attentive then others but generally they all make yoy feel welcome and treat you well and keep your drinks filled up the sushi chefs though are not all wonderful! I feel as though sushi chefs should be personable and care about the people they are serving which I do believe two of them do but there is one sushi chef ( I think his name is danny) (I could be wrong) he is scary and he makes you feel bad for ordering more stuff and even though he's speaking in Japanese you can tell he's complaining about all the people who are there to eat or what they are ordering. He does alot of huffing and puffing and eye rolling sighing and complaining. It's horrible and every time I walk in and see him behind the bar I give a quick prayer that I don't have to sit in front of him or that he's not the main sushi chef for the night cause he makes the other chefs grumpy also. So food is amazing, prices are average for ayce in vegas and the service is great if you don't get the one chef that can make your night rough.",

I sat at the bar and was immediately asked if it was my first time here by the chef. I said yes, and he told me to ask if I had any questions. The food selection is great with many variations. I  chose to wat AYCE and I definitely got my money's worth by eating here. I ordered and I got my foos right away. Also, Chef Joon oppa was very accommodating and nice to me.

The disappointments were the Ultimate Garlic Tuna Roll, which surprisingly lacked flavor, and the Green Tea Tempura Ice Cream, which wasn't very crunchy at all. Also got a very oily sweet potato tempura, which we didn't eat. And one shrimp tempura with the Shrimp and Vegetable Tempura left me wanting more shrimp. They should offer half roll options too, not just for the last roll.",

I don't know if it's because we came for lunch and it wasn't busy, but everything was AMAZING!   We were immediately greeted & seated upon entering the restaurant which was surprisingly large & beautifully decorated. We sat at the bar and chose to have the AYCE. Our waiter was extremely polite and helpful in explaining the menu. His timing on checking in on our needs was perfect. The sushi chef even checked in on us periodically to see if we wanted to order anything else. So to sum it all up, it's unfortunate that so many yelpers had bad experiences here with their service but thankfully, ours was PERFECT! We'll definitely be back!  And the icing on the cake... SUSHI WAS FANTASTIC!",

I don't use wasabI and soy for this roll because I like the eel taste, but I did here.  The crunch scallop roll was generous. This was also on the bland side of the taste spectrum, but it's scallop so that's not surprising.  The spicy tuna roll was all heat and no flavor. This was disappointing.  The cucumber in the rolls was chewy. Cucumber is supposed to be crisp and crunchy.  The service is great though. My water glass was never empty and the server was always available for questions.  The pricing was fair for what I got and I left full, so that's good.  But I really was not a fan of the taste of the food.  It was an ok choice for a sushi lunch gamble on the other side of the world from where I usually am.  Would I come here again? Not likely.",

Which surprised me because it's just water, it shouldn't be that hard to screw up.          After 20 minutes of waiting for our sashimi our waiter came up and asked us if we were ready to order, but our sashimi still wasn't there. We asked him if our sashimi was ready, and he said that he had totally forgotten that we had even ordered. So we waited again for them to bring out our sashimi. After they brought it out we were already feeling weird. They were serving everyone else in the building, but we felt neglected.          The sashimi was thin and crunchy, after we asked for the check because we just wanted to leave after all of that. We had a terrible experience. After we paid we walked out, and went to Osaka.",

Super friendly staff, not pushy or overbearing but always available when needed. Can really tell that they have fun and enjoy working there together. Ordered bulgogi bento box, tonkatsu ramen n chicken katsu bowl. Everything was awesome, yummy and plentiful...next time we just gotta share a bento box or get two bowls cuz we failed miserably at trying to finish it all.  They offer AYCE also for $27 and the menu choices are extensive, will definitely try this option out one day when we are much more hungrier. Can't believe they are open to 4am!

AYCE and the dudes are quick and the food is delicious and fresh. The screaming orgasm is great, but if you're just a simple fish guy like me know that everything is fresh and delicious so just ordering perpetual salmon orders is good too.

The environment was awesome, large alcohol range, and the menu is huge. The staff was also friendly. My first complaint is that you can't order half rolls until your last order. Personally, when I come to all you can eat sushi, I like ordering half rolls to have more variety. My main problem with my first and only visit here was that the staff, while they were very nice, they kept forgetting or messing things up. As someone with experience in food, I get mistakes happen. But after an incorrect drink, two plates that we didn't order, and our forgotten tempura ice cream, it got annoying. I would be open to visiting again for the food, but am open to finding another sushi joint.",

    "text": "Im taking stars away for a few reasons.   1- my sisters and I are practically professional at AYCE sushi. So we may have frightened our sushi chef when we ordered 20 different items right from the get-go! Need I mind you, 20 items mostly consisting of sushi that comes 2 to an order at which we order 3 of each can seem like a lot of orders but not between 3 girls. Our server came back to tell us \"you know you have to eat everything in all you can eat or you get charged from left orders?\" My sisters and I looked at each other with a smirk. Oh yeah! We know!! She proceeded to tell us that they are going to break up our order in half just in case we don't eat it all. Needless to say we shocked the staff by ordering more and desert!! We weren't worried about them breaking it up in half because we knew we would eat it, the timing between was just slow. Hence why we order everything first. There's nothing like a 10-15 minute gap between orders.   2- this might be TMI but I'm breastfeeding, so I can't have spicy food without burning my son's butt. I am also lactose so I can't have cream cheese. My one sister doesn't like to try new things so she likes to stick to what she knows, while my other sister is adventurous. The fact that they don't do half orders during AYCE is disappointing. The half orders are a good way for us to try a little bit of everything so we can see what we like. But we were told we can only have our last order be a half order. Bummer!! I honestly Never heard of that, and I frequent sushi!   I will say the sushi was good, and the service was ok. But what sets this place apart from the rest is their AYCE- it really left us disappointed. Being a big sushi lover, I'm sad to say neither of my sisters nor myself will be coming back and is no longer on our recommended places of sushi.",

For two people the portions were big for us like the rolls it would have been nice to just do half of them. Too rich to each eat four of the same thing. My only complaint!!  Portions were big for a sushi place lol ! Weird I know but my preference only!",

Sushi Wa has a great vibe and the food is amazing. Probably some of the freshest, most flavorful sushi I have yet to have. My favorite and I think we ate almost every item in the menu because we came multiple days is the Sushi Bomb! I can't get enough of that stuff! The staff is friendly and so helpful. I only wish there was a Sushi Wa back home in Texas!  Go, eat and enjoy! You won't be disappointed! Thanks Joon, your food was delicious! I will be back next time I am in town!",

Really was great for the rare late night sushi craving.   Dont be fooled by the number of check-ins, I've been here more than enough times to love this place. Highly recommend the Pepper Seared Baby Tuna and the Scallop Roll. For those looking for a fried treat, try the Who's Your Daddy and if you like spice, try a Sushi Bomb! It's spicy level is from 1 to 10, with a 4 being like tabasco sauce and a 6 being like Habanero levels. Order 10 at your own risk!  Highly recommend this place for couples, groups, or for anyone looking to get their sushi fix!",

At night, the tables are dimly lit and the seating areas are nice. The interior has a modern feel and overall, it felt pleasant.  The food was great. One of the main pros is the size of their menu. It probably has the best selection of appetizers that I've seen, which I consider to be equally as important as the sushi. The portions here are extremely generous. The size of the sushi rolls are definitely on the large side.  One of the strongest aspects of this place is the service. Our server was Aaron. He had some great energy, and was just a generally fun person. Always came around when we needed something, and filled up our drinks often. The sushi chef even checked up to see if we enjoyed everything. Aaron and the sushi chef that night (sorry, I didn't catch your name) were very cool people.   Overall, this place ranks pretty high among the other sushi shops in Vegas. I recommend trying it.",

It was packaged well so nothing would be soggy upon arrival except no soy sauce was provided in the bag. It did however come with chopsticks, ginger and wasabi. The edamame was cooked perfect and extra salted like I had requested. The roll was good but a little too spicy for me. But the tuna and salmon tasted very fresh.   They have a large menu of both hot and cold tapas, sushi rolls, sashimi, bento boxes, noodles, soups, and desserts. I had a difficult time trying to select just one roll! I'd like to try more next time!",

Everyone is very friendly and the staff is attentive. Definitely give this place a try if you're craving some good sushi.   What's better than an AYCE sushi restaurant? One that's open late - this place is open until 4am folks! I love having a sushi place on this side of town that's open late. My first few experiences with this restaurant was with take out orders only. As far as take out - some of the rolls can be a little pricey, but hey - you're ordering stuff that's normally AYCE if you eat in, so it's bound to be less cost effective than eating there.   I went in the other night with my friend to do AYCE, it was fairly late - around 2:30a and there were a few tables in there. The server - (I don't know her name but she's always there) is very nice. She was very prompt in getting us drinks and patient with us as we looked over the menu. We placed a few kitchen item orders from her and ordered our sushi directly from Juan the sushi chef since we were sitting at the bar anyway. Our food items and sushi came out really fast! I was impressed.   They have a very extensive list of different kind of rolls. I'm not really big on rolls but we did get a volcano roll that I thought looked freakin cool. Pieces of sushi were stacked up like a volcano and had an orange lava sauce coming down from the top. Pretty creative.   I usually like to only eat nigiri - while their fish quality was good, I was a little disappointed to see that they put a ponzu like sauce on several of the pieces of nigiri. I'm not a big fan of ponzu on my nigiri - I think it's overpowering and masks the flavor of the fish. If I were to do it again, next time I would say hold the sauce.   Ordered a couple kitchen items too - pork belly - a little over cooked and dry, salmon kama - also a little over cooked (on the outside) but somehow still tender on the inside. Perhaps their heat was just a little too high in the kitchen that night.  All in all a good experience, especially at almost 3a on a Wednesday night. Friendly staff, decent menu selection, and pretty good value at about $27pp",

My friends and I went for a little bite before our night out and we were pleasantly surprised by the quality of the sushi/food overall (especially for the price). Our waitress Sarah was so sweet and she recommended a few things for us to try. We got a whole bunch of things but I personally thought the sushi platter/combo (?) was the best bang for your buck. You get 10 pieces of sushi + any roll for $22. Loooooves me a good deal :)   I'll have to come back next time and try some other things from the menu! It's a little far from the strip but better than paying 3x the price",

The service was excellent from the time we sat down until we left. Several people, including the manager, always checking on us to see if we wanted to order anything else and water glasses were always refilled without asking.   We did the AYCE which was $27 for dinner. Besides the large selection of sushi, sashimi and rolls they have a huge selection of appetizers, salads, ramen and dessert that is all included. Sushi Wa is quite generous with the sashimi, uni, and other higher priced items being part of the AYCE.   We started with gyoza which I didn't care for. Too greasy and I prefer pork or chicken over beef. We also shared a seaweed salad, cucumber salad and 1/2 order of tonkatsu ramen which was huge. The broth was little bland for me but everything else was very good. We continued with several pieces of sushi with the cajun albacore a favorite, as well as spicy tuna roll, philadelphia roll and the sex bomb which was our favorite roll. They put asparagus in the spicy tuna which I don't like so will have to have them hold that next time. Overall the sushi was very fresh and tasty.   For dessert we both chose the banana tempura with ice cream. This was a perfect ending for our dinner and at $27 I think we definitely got our money's worth. They have several lunch specials including bento boxes so I am looking forward to coming back!",

The RICE was terrible!!! Maybe it was left overs from the night before but it was hard and dry! I've had better rice at a fast food sushi joint!!!! The tuna I attached we spit out because it was sour. The fish in general was not fresh. I've never wanted to walk out of a sushi place more... It was national sushi day and we wanted to try a new place and it was not good at all.... Maybe we had bad luck but I will not go back. I ended up ordering a California roll so can get full and leave. I've never had sushi this bad and I'm not very picky!   Also- the flow the was bad, we waited really long in between plates and we were the only ones there. I hate giving bad reviews but stay away! It's not worth it.",

Second: the staff here is always very nice, we haven't had a bad experience here, and we go here a lot! They make great recommendations for my husband, who loves to try the different rolls they have. (I usually stick to my nigiri)  We've always done the AYCE (all you can eat) since it's a great price (I believe $27 for dinner? Give or take a dollar) and we tend to eat A LOT, so it's better for us to go this route.  The fish to rice ratio is good, and they come out FAST. The fish itself is also good. Not the \"best\", but still really good (especially for the price lol)  It pretty dark in here, which isn't really a BAD thing, I'm sure it's brighter during the day, but we have only gone here after the sun has set.  OVERALL, We love this place and always suggest it to our friends and family that visit (:",

I did the AYCE and my husband and 1 year old daughter shared chicken teriyaki.  My husband thought the chicken teriyaki was alright.  I always order nigiri sushi. Hamachi, my fav, is very fresh and good here! So is the tuna! The sweet shrimp is one of the best I've had!  Although the sushi was great, the service is slow. The service is friendly, just really slow.  Don't do AYCE at the booth because the service is slow for that, so sit at the bar. I don't recommend to bring your kids here at night because there is a pub right next door. Outside of the pub there is an outdoor seating area. I didn't like walking out at night into crowds of smokers with my kid.  I would love to come here again with just my husband. I would come here during the day with my family. My husband is not a sushi person, so it'll be awhile till we come back.  It wasn't bad for our first time. I just wish the service for me was quicker.",

She offered us more ice cream, which we declined because obviously the whole batch was contaminated. She offered to take a 5 dollar drink off the bill, we declined and said that we come here once every month, and that they would be losing a customer. Waitress gave us a gift card for us to come back but we will NEVER be going back to this place. To top it off, I got home and got extremely sick and was in the bathroom all night.",

Over the past 10 years or so I have eaten at dozens of sushi restaurants in this town (on the strip as well) and I can't say I have enjoyed any as much as this place. The fish is stellar, the customer service is amazing, and the rolls are innovative and flavorful.  What brought me back is the fact that I can easily eat $100 worth of sushi in one sitting. I prefer all-yo-can-eat venues because frankly, it's cheaper. Most of the time you find yourself at one of these places, the rolls are basic and not very good, or you are prohibited from ordering any of the \"good\" rolls. Not this place!!! If it is on the menu, you can order it (and as much as you like). Any app, roll, sashimi, nigiri; it's all fair game. The funny thing is the place is almost always empty! It's a really nice place right next door to Shakespeare's (a trendy bar). I am positive that this is just a secret among those who live in Green Valley. This place is a must-go for any Vegas sushi-addict.",

The ambiance is nice, I like the booths...I always feel that the service is good- one time I felt neglected by the female waitress, but today we had a different waiter (cant remember his name) but he is my favorite.

For the amount of people here for lunch on a Tuesday I did expect food to arrive a little faster. But considering I wasn't in a hurry I didn't mind at all. Now my review of the food is based on nigiri because I do not like rolls. I'm not a sushi elitist by any means, I just like to taste the natural fish with little to no flare. To that aspect, the food was amazing. All the fish that I had was very fresh and minimalistic. Definitely will be coming back for dinner, might even bring the wife.",

The fish portions were good not extravagant but alot better then most ayce places. Also they had alot of appetizer options  which are unique and not skimpy  in meat or chicken.

    "text": "After reading all the raving reviews here and seeing that it was in our new neighborhood, we gave this place a try. Why oh why oh why?! Let's start with the positive. The contemporary interior was a pleasant surprise considering the banal exterior facade.   Now for what really matters, service and sushi. Much MUCH! to be desired.   1) The temakis served were overfilled with unseasoned, mushy WARM rice. Nigiri rice appeared about 2 inches x 1 x 1.  Required two bites or a disgusting crammed-mouthful. Length of fish was not slightly longer than rice and sliced too thin.  TWO stars off.   Sushi rice properly cooked and seasoned and freshness/quality of toppings are key to the success of a sushi establishment for more discerning patrons. Fish quality here was fine considering you're in the middle of a desert.   2) twice reminded server that I had not been served my uni nigiri yet. Never got it although we were seated as dinner AYCE diners. ONE star off.   3) took 20 minutes for server to return to take second order. I'm a very patient person--still tipped 20%. Perhaps understaffed for the night? Not server's fault.   4) didn't appreciate being reminded to finish rice. See #1  5) 7:15 pm and they were out of hamachi kama. Perhaps they were slammed earlier. No star off for that.",

This was a total buzzkill. I understand the server was probably trying to help me by informing me, but after the 1st time was plenty enough. Food was great, customer service was not.",

    "text": "We have been here multiple times over the years. The food itself is good and the decor and dining ambiance as well making it a good choice for group occasions. But the service is actually pretty terrible for a few reasons. First reason is they don't greet you in any sort of nice fashion. Then you sit there and wait quite a while for a person to give you water or menus. After they come, they walk away so fast and they don't come back. When they do come back for the order, they take a bit of time to make it. Then they don't come back for your next round of ordering. We know how they roll, so we just try to order all we want in the first time, rather than smaller rounds. But then we end up over ordering and becoming overstuffed. All you can eat sushi problems. I just wish they would get their service game together, because then we would definitely go here more. There are just better options with better food and better service around here. When I bring in people from out of town I would prefer to bring them here due to the seating and ambiance, but I just can't after past attempts. I brought my brother there from out of town with his wife and kids, and we ended up with a free voucher card with $15 on it because we were there for two hours and they knew the service was bad. I can't bring people here until I know it's fixed. Edited: I edited my review to remove the part about the ordering with paper and pens, I must have remembered that part wrong, we do have two sushi restaurants we used to go to with that same issue. But yes, I do know this is the proper restaurant and I do have the free voucher gift card somewhere that was given to my out of town brother when I brought him there with his family. This was a couple years ago, and we have been back a few times since. Its the size and shape of a credit card and If I can find it I will take a picture to prove it. One of the last times we went we were with another couple who had also been there before and we joked about the service as it unfolded again to be sub par. When we do go,  we know what to expect but we keep crossing fingers that it would have gotten better by now. It's definitely not a good business practice to respond how you do to patrons. Best advice is to learn something from what you are reading and make improvements. Not try to appear that everything is perfect and your patrons giving you feedback are crazy. This review is real, but the service is still a joke. We have been back a handful of times since, but not in the past 6 months. We will try it again when the time is right.",

Couple years ago, this was my go-to sushi place but now, wont be coming back. The screaming orgasm and the amaebi nigiri was still really good but all the other nigiris were all very thinly sliced over an overly large portion of rice. It seems as if I'm just eating a big chunk of rice. Couldnt even tell if there was fish on top.   The biggest factor of this one star review is really the service. I'm not sure if it was just our server or just generally speaking. But, it was terrible. On the get go, once we said our first batch of orders, he just questioned us if we would be able to finish all those cause they charge for leftovers, etc. Now, we've been eating AYCE sushi for the longest time and we already know what our limits are. But making that statement seems more like an insult rather than a reminder. Then he kept asking the same question after every order. Now we felt like we were challenged.. so we had like 4 batches of a ton load of orders that we finished (no leftovers). With those statements and questions, we felt totally uncomfortable throughout our dinner which just ruined the whole night. Towards the end of our dinner, we kinda had the attitude of anger and sarcasm not just towards our server, but with the whole restaurant as well. Btw, server's name is Mark.",

The server, Mark, we got was very rude right from the beginning. Really, why will you question our quantity of orders if we could finish it? Every time we order \"Are you sure?\" It made us very uncomfortable the whole time especially when we try to order. Just awful! Never coming back! Nigiris have very thin slices of fish portion; rice portion was a lot. They try to make you full because of the rice not because the fish portion. Also after the first batch of orders, we noticed they take longer time to get our orders out. Place wasn't even full at that time. There are other much better sushi joints around town. Friendly, better service, and muuuuch better tasty sushi. Pass on this one!",

I think makes the roll taste too much like fried dough rather rice than sushi, which would be fine, except these aren't carnival prices.

Oh, and the $10 sake was not even hot, but warm. Minus one more star!  The service here was good, but when we asked for a table in the corner the hostess/waitress asked why...

    "text": "About a year ago, the boyfriend and I went in to SushiWa and immediately walked out when we saw not one single customer inside.   A year later, it seems like SushiWa is what everyone talks about if you live in the 89052 area code.  We finally gave it a try yesterday, and I was reasonably pleased.   The decor inside is very modern and roomy.  Not like your typical AYCE joints in town - where you can reach over to the table next to you with your chopsticks to try out their dishes.    Their menus cover your basics but with a little more.  This AYCE actually gives you sashimi (one order per person).  That was pleasantly surprising.  We then ordered our usual sushi and rolls.    The fish is VERY fresh.  The boyfriend claims that the super white tuna there is by far the best he has had, even better than the ones in California.  I must say that the freshness of the fish is comparable to the freshness of the ones in Hong Kong, so that's saying a lot.    The sushi was made of little rice and a big chuck of fish - just the way I like them.  The rolls were somewhat difference because they were cut very thinly.  Must try the super spider roll made with soft shell crab and shrimp tempura - yummy!   Their fresh oysters are also very delicious, but also one order per person - boo.   Overall, I enjoyed my experience at SushiWa and will definitely return since it is so close to my house.  Another nice thing about it is that there is no wait.  AYCE sushi joints usually have at least a 30 minute wait, and it is just plain ol' obnoxious.    Aside from the thin rolls, this place lost a star because of its strict rules about how many order per person.  By the time we had our third rounds of orders, I was getting so frustrated about what we had already order or what we can't order.  But it is what it is!  Oh, our server, Monica, was a sweetheart.  However, you guys must be mindful that this restaurant is owned and run by Koreans, so it is not your typical/ordinary Japanese place.    Lastly, this place plays awesome music!  Fresh fish, great service, awesome music!  You should be sold by now.    Enjoy!",

Upon entry, our waitresses were nice and friendly. It was a good start. Ambiance is nice and quiet, but dark inside. If you're like me and really love to take pictures of food it'll be hard without flash cause it's very dim in here.   We got served by 3 different servers. The waitress taking our order had issues with her pen not working twice and it felt slow. We were told we were not able to order half rolls unless it's for our last orders. Weird.   Ice cream is only limited to one kind per person. So if you want both the tempura and mochi ice cream, you can only pick one. :( Sad face here.   We ended with a waiter named JooSun (spelling?) and he seemed distant/apathetic but he was also nice. He let my a la carte friend get ice cream anyway. He gave me this bonus card when I asked for the stamp cards.. not sure if they have those stamp cards now. I'll find out soon enough.   All in all, it was a pretty good experience. There was this halibut that I tried which I could not for the life of me finish it nor swallow it. :(  Next time I'm back would most likely be in June for a birthday celebration. I'll update then. :)",

It was almost as though an exorcism needed to take place. She told us that we only had 19 minutes more to eat our food and that she would not bring out any other food because \"we had been here too long. \" According to my last text to my friend letting her know that I would be there soon I know the we were at Sushi Wa for no more than 45 minutes when she told us this erroneous claim. In addition, we did not receive our food on time after what Geo had given us and couple of the orders were for other tables. Save yourself trouble and go elsewhere. By the way, the store owner ended up calling Gio back to the restaurant because this was such a serious issue. Harassing a customer is never ever acceptable. And she never apologized., but Geo and the store owner did for her.  Don't risk it if the waitress from Hell is still working there!",

Fresh fish that makes you forget you live in a desert. But what really stood out here was service. Everyone made eye contact and smiled and they all worked together as a team and never made you feel like \"oh you're not in my section let me go get your server...\" (I hate that by the way) and instead, you leave feeling like you had ten servers, all of whom were nice, friendly, knowledgable and accommodating.   There was one young man who chatted with us for so long happily answering all of my questions, seeming excited at the chance to educate us. Haha.   Try the baked mussels appetizer, the himachi, octopus, any signature roll, a seaweed salad, and a bottle of the strawberry sake with some fried ice cream... I know its a lot, but you won't regret it as it is all so worth it!",

Impressed! And of course everything else was really good too.  And one more thing I like about this place was the interior. They have some good interior there. I heard this place is about 10 years old but place looks really clean and nice. I thought they just opened up or something. Really good place to have nice sushi night with either family or group of people. Even good for by yourself at the Bar. They have some really friendly sushimans ;P I will come out and have another event there! Really nice place!",

I enjoy their specialty rolls, and especially the Superman burrito roll and 911 roll for those that love avocado. Very good sashimi with great tuna.  Try the Baha for nice yellowtail with jalapeno, if you like a little spice.  The 911 sauce is a must for spice. The tuna poke is also very good. It can get busy, but generally service is very good and prices are reasonable.",

I'm not going to go into detail because I'm not going to hold it against them... but my tea was cold, they forgot to provide: the individual small plates, the soy sauce dish and the wasabi/ginger side.  But all was remedied quickly once we pointed it out.    They are OH-SO-NICE.  So.... definitely not going to hold the minor infractions against them since the sushi and rolls were Killer Grinds.  Enjoyed the AYCE... started with the edamame and seaweed salad.  Both were great starters... fresh and fast.  Then started in on the fish... salmon, yellow tail, white tuna.  All very good and fresh....and big pieces of fish too which just a little bit of rice.... so they are more than fair with their portions.  Ordered the albacore with jalapeno... it came wrapped in red onion which I'm not a fan of onion so I picked the onion out and ate it.  Was Great without the onion.  :)  Then we ordered the Scallop Crunch, Mountain and 007 rolls.  They were all different and all good... I can't say which I liked better.  The Scallop Crunch had a nice crunch to it while the scallops were tender, the Mountain was a baked roll that was served with a spicy sauce that was awesome... just a nice little kick nothing shocking... and the 007 roll was so simple it was refreshing.  We ended with Tempura Ice Cream... it was 'ok'.  Nothing to expound upon... should have gotten the Mochi instead... next time.",

Go somewhere better, or definitely don't go for lunch on a Sunday. I would love for them to respond and explain",

Last night I went there with my boyfriend and felt sick towards the end of our meal. When we got home, I vomited and am still feeling unwell today (tender stomach, bad 'movements'...).   I called sushiwa and told them what I ate so that they could check their ingredients and to prevent this from happening to someone else, but a rude manager, who I believe is named Gio, told me that I could not have gotten food poisoning because the rolls we ordered had cooked fish. Even so, if the fish had not been handled or cooked properly, or if the other ingredients in the roll had gone bad, there are a number of factors could have contributed to my feeling sick.   Gio did not apologize for my sickness after eating at sushi wa. He was very short with me on the phone and did not say that he would check the ingredients from the rolls I ate.   I do not post this out of anger or for vengeance but because, terrible customer service and lack of empathy aside, it is unacceptable for a restaurant not to investigate such a complaint thoroughly. Indeed, all Gio had to do was apologize for my poor experience and promise that he would check the freshness of the ingredients and the handling and cooking of the food.   Needless to say, we will not be going back to sushi wa. Eat at your own risk.",

In my opinion, this is the best AYCE in Vegas. Their menu is expansive and all items can be ordered (for dinner, some limitations for lunch). The one thing that got me for an AYCE was their uni (urchin). It was tasty and fresh, not the best i've had, but it definitely tasted the way uni should.  Other pros: The waitresses were so nice. One took my restless 1 year old for a tour around the restaurant and gave her some chocolate. So awesome.  Their rolls are creative. I strongly recommend the mountain roll and the superman burrito, soooo good. The screaming orgasm is also good, up there with I love Sushi's, slightly spicier which my wife and i loved!  Only cons were that the salmon sashimi tasted as though it was washed with water prior to serving, giving it a less fresh taste.  Overall, we've definitely found our spot for when we're craving AYCE sushi!",

    "text": "Some people eat just to eat as they routinely do to fulfill their three squared meals a day. I, on the other hand, eat because I have a love for food. My facebook photos can attest to that.  Knowing that, Sushi Wa is my answer when people ask me what the best AYCE sushi place in Vegas... with a grain of salt. Although Sushi Wa has its high points, it also has some low points, thus not earning its full five stars. Here's a list of likes and dislikes...  Like:  - Each person gets one order of sashimi as part of their AYCE experience.  - Fresh and thick cuts of fish  - Best tasting Unagi I've ever eaten. Generously cut and quickly seared to get a crispy edge to contrast the soft texture. (I usually never order Unagi since its rather unhealthy)  - A wide selection of side dishes  - Small details that make each dish a little extra... For example, in the Udon, there are shiitake mushrooms. You normally wouldnt see that in an order of Udon from the AYCE menu.  Dislikes:  - No half roll orders unless its your last roll.  - Limited selection of dessert... And I hate how they drizzle chocolate on every piece of dessert.  - Slow service. Some of the male wait staff seem lost.  For me, the list of likes out weigh the list of dislikes. I mostly order Nigiri so the thick slices of fresh fish are more important than desserts. Slow service? Well, that just means more time to talk with my dining date. I've eaten here well over five times and each person I bring has come back to bring other people. Sure, other AYCE eat places might have a thing or two that is done better, but Sushi Wa has the best Nigiri.  Photos included!",

Monkey brains a mushroom stuffed with spicy tuna then fried then a crab shrimp and cream cheese fritter thing killer green mussel a few others that slip my mind  ohh and fresh wasabi",

    "text": "\"Wa-Wa\" (sound of failure).  Sushi wa-da-fa!?!  I got held hostage by a sushi bar!!! and not in a good way!  I came here with good intentions - going to Terri K's first UYE, sitting in the \"bamboo jail\" table with 12 other awesome yelpers and yelper friends, eating raw fish galore.  However, it did not turn out that way.  We came early (6 PM reservation) but could not leave until after 9:30 PM.  The only reason this gets one star from the restaurant side of things is that our bus boy was awesome.  He was polite, refilled drinks super fast, and cleared empty plates like Flash.  The service was deplorable.  We really only had one waiter, and he only liked one half of the table.  That half happened to include a lot of people that speak his language, so he spent all of his time taking their large orders and giving them food.  These are all my yelp friends, and I am glad I got to be with them, but the server only waited on them essentially.  When it came to our table, he never gave us what we ordered - 30 minutes passed and we had never received items, whereas our companions on the other side got several orders in and food was coming out in group portions.    The waiter argued with me after I asked 3 times for my mackerel sushi, one of the 3 things I ordered...after waiting 30+ minutes - he finally said he already brought it to the table (but it was someone else's order) and said I never ordered it.  After I asked for it 3 more times, couldn't he just put in another order?!  When I asked him a question about an item, he answered and ran off before I could order food.  I never got to order more than once, and most people on my side of the table had to re-order food or wait forever to order.  If only we spoke Korean!  The payment was a disaster too.  We asked for separate checks (for parties of one or 2 - we all did AYCE so it was same price all around) and we asked before we ordered and again before we asked for the check.  We were refused.  Our waiter gave attitude to Bobby Y. when he brought our credit cards and cash that added up exactly to the bill with gratuity.  Another waiter came over and Jieun spoke Korean with him - he said if he rings all of the cards up, he cannot put in any orders for other guests and they are BUSY (well, we were already there 3 hours hello!) so it would take him awhile.  Instead of going to start ringing our cards up though, he stood there and kept repeating the issues with their system - so I told him to go do it already!    It was an igloo in there - when Eric R. asked for them to turn the a/c up, I think that caused our waiter to hate us.  I had to borrow Nelson Q.'s jacket to survive the hours of hell.  I finally went to our car and put the heat on for 10 minutes.  The only reason I ate enough was that Jane shared some of the food from her side of the table with me, very generously (amaebi, ikura, saba, oysters) - because I never got my full and only order from the 6:15PMish range.  The upside -hanging with great people and meeting new people (Jane, Maria).  The envy - Terri K. bolting after convincing jerk waiter to give her a separate bill.  The downside - Wa still has a sticker on its door saying \"People love us on yelp.\"  I call BS on that!",

Several times she tried to deliver our items to the tables next to us and then did the same with the other table's order.  Kind of strange and not so good since it's food related.  Now onto the food!  They do not offer half rolls for the AYCE however they do offer your choice of 1 of the sashimi options which is nice because that is not something that is normally offered at AYCE.  The sashimi came with 4 nice size slices of fish.  Delish!  For the sushi options, they give a lot of rice and are pretty strict on the leftover policy.  They probably give about double what a normal AYCE sushi restaurant would do in terms of rice.  They have a nice selection of mochi flavors including coffee which was so good!  Overall the experience was just OK.  I liked the variety that they offer but the rice overload, no half rolls, and mix ups with orders were a bit too many flaws for me to go back",

I spoke to a gentleman at the front and told him my situation, he told me to hold on walked to the back and came back and said he knew nothing about this. I described the person for him in detailed, and he stated he was the manager and nobody has told him anything. I told him ok that's ok and I was about to order, but then i thought to myself why should I give someone business if they cant even honor what they said, plus their food was okay, nothing to rave about, and they are over priced!!

One person ordered a tempura roll which she thought would be a roll with tempura in it. Nope, it was a roll made tempura style. The ramen I ordered was a little disappointing. I'm sure I'm wrong but it just seemed like top ramen noodles with some added stuff to it. We wanted to come back and try the all you can eat but after experiencing some of the food they served we all agreed that we would t be coming back. Some people might like the sushi here but it was such a departure from the norm that I just didn't like it.",

    "text": "Mixed feelings towards this place.. I had come here for dinner around 5pm on a Wednesday evening, and I had all you can eat sushi.  The pros of this place is the service and cleanliness! Especially from our specific bus person - a tall lanky fella - who I didn't get to catch the name of, but he definitely was on top of asking if we'd like any plates out of the way and our drinks were always refilled constantly.   Now for the cons which really had to be brought up.. The food quality.  Now I'd understand if it was really busy (which it wasn't whatsoever), but the sushi rolls seemed like it was meh. 6-7/10. Example: The rolls ordered that had unagi (fresh water eel) on top had tiny burnt pieces of eel on top. And the nigiri I had ordered always had a fat piece of rice under the fish.   Now for my lady's bento box she ordered.  She decided to go with the teriyaki beef bento, And it came with everything any other bento box would come with (vegetable tempura, 1/2 roll of California roll, house salad) and it wasn't anything special. Yet it came out to $16.. Definitely not worth it as much.  Sadly I wish I captured photos but I didn't get to..   Overall this restaurant ambience was nice. Dimly lit, and decorated nicely. Nothing bad to say about the servers or restaurant itself.  A good date night for anybody craving sushi in general. DISCLAIMER: *I'm just nit-picky about my sushi quality after going to so many ayce sushi spots* lol.   Thanks Sushi Wa.",

The guy who took our order came and said it will be 5 minutes, they thought it was miso soup and walked away. I grumbled and said well I never got any miso soup if that's the case!!

    "text": "Sushi Wa has always been mine and my family's first choice to visit when we want to dine out for Sushi. Past visits have been good, sometimes great, but to say the least never bad. Food is good, ambience of the restaurant is also good with great music. Last night's visit however makes me think twice about visiting this restaurant.  We were seated in a booth (there were four of us) across from the sushi bar. One server came and took drink orders and provided us with the menus. He appeared to be out waiter but to find out he wasn't. After the drinks arrived and we made our selection we waited for a bit. The server than showed up with our plates, took our order (AYCE). After the first round of order was almost finished we wanted to put in another order and this is when the issue began.  We got our server's attention and asked if we can put in another order - her response was \"please wait a little bit\". She then proceeded to walk the restaurant, checking on other tables, booth, and bar area, giggling and talking with these guests. About five minutes passed and I again flagged her down and asked her if I can order. Her response \"If you put in another order now, because the kitchen is backed up, it will come out slow.\" All of us with exception of my husband ( as we were all speaking in Korean) looked at her with shock. She was actually telling us that we can't order the food because sushi chefs were busy! It felt as though she was scolding us about our pace and how orders should be placed based on the convenience of the sushi chefs. After the shock settled we advised her that we will be understanding of the wait (as few large tables arrived) and she finally took the order. She continued to \"ignore\" our table and only visit when we flagged her down throughout the dinner.  At the end of our dinner my mother asked her if we can order dessert. Her response was even more shocking to use. She began looking around the table and noticed three lumps of rice that was left on the plate. She began to lecture my mother how that is not the policy of their AYCE and the restaurants need to charge us for the left overs. She also pointed to where her boss was seating and told us that He had pulled her aside and spoke to her about our table, how we can't continue to leave lumps of rice. She also added that she can be fired by all of this. Then she called out to one of the servers to come and take our dessert order.   I am not sure if this is the service that is given to all patrons at this restaurant or she feels that she is comfortable enough to talk or provide lack of service to us because we are Koreans. I have received better service at Dick's last resort in San Diego and their motto is to be rude (fun rude) to their customers. The way that our table was served and spoken to is definitely not something I expect to receive when spending over $100 at a restaurant. In addition, to be told when I can place my order and getting scolded at the end of the dinner is certainly not the way I wanted end my dinner with my family.  To say the least, Sushi Wa will never be our first, second, or last choice to dine. Our server's performance definitely left us wondering if the money spent was worth is and obviously it is not.",

We've been to sushi places everywhere and we know what we like and we know how much we can eat. Oh did I mention my husband started off as a sushi chef? Well, we went to Sushi Wa with high expectations from one of our best friends...and I must admit...the sushi was great as we were told. But here's the sad thing...the waitress we got every time we go there always limits our orders! I mean c'mon...we know what we wanna eat...and we're paying all you can eat and if we can't finish it you still charge us for unfinished food...so why limit us? That type of service is not needed...and on top of that they always take forever to bring the food and the bill. You would think if we placed a larger order in the beginning then you wouldn't have to worry about coming back to our table. I think it's rude to limit your customers when they're paying to eat All You Can Eat!   I'll score 2 stars on great food and deduct the 3 stars for service.   Sad thing is..my husband and I miss their sushi (especially the nigiri and sashimi sushi). We are not sushi rolls type of people :/  We'll see if we go back or not.",

Instead you keep ordering a little bit at a time and all your sushi is fresh. I love the pepper seared ahi nigiri and garlic ahi (garlic ponzu sauce drizzled over ahi sashimi) nigiri. Anything on the menu is game for you to order and as much as u want (they limit your uni and ama ebi to one per person). You can pay dinner price during lunch if you want sashimi. I recOmmend that if you are there for lunch to just pay the lunch price because whatever sashimi you may be craving you can order it as nigiri. Examples of things to order are specialty fusion sushi rolls, nigiri, salads, tempura, bulgogi, kalbi, teri salmon. Dont forget dessert...mochi ice cream, tempura ice cream.",

I only ordered one roll and saw that it was an AYCE place good thing i tried it first the place was terrible. I had the Tiger Roll from there, i tried alot of tiger rolls, but this had to be the worst it was so bland the only taste i got from the roll was the tuna on top that tasted like metal..... seriously if your going to charge $14 for a roll make sure it is good. Needless to say I will not be back",

    "text": "Where to start... This is not an authentic Japanese restaurant!  We sat at the sushi bar, but can't order directly to the chefs in front of us. Why??because we had the all you can eat menu.  When you have an all you can eat menu and put tons of restrictions;  it is not all you can eat. I guess that's why we had to order from the wait staff. They were the ones to make sure we didn't order anything not on the \"all you can eat\" menu. The good part.. The fish was decent, but something is always lost in translation when non native people try to present themselves as authentic! I would have given this place a high rating, but they choose to play the bait and switch game with their customers. We got our bill and saw that they included gratuity in all our bills even though we had separate checks. They even charged more than the percentage stated(also mentioned by Andy S.)  So, I won't be back!",

    "text": "Me and my best friend come to this place the most for our sushi craving for this very reason: Best quality of fish with the most affordable price.  I always start out with a seaweed salad- their portion size on this one is small but it's not a big deal because you get so much food later on that it's a great starter.  Then I pack on nigiri, everything from big belly tuna to seared pepper to yellowtail and salmon. Their fish quality versus some cheaper joints like Blue Fin & Daisho knock them out of the water and give the most bang for your buck if you're a fish lover like me. And for these, they don't scrap you on portion- I could barely fit the whole piece in my mouth. Still did and it freaking MELTED with flavour.  My friend ordered Shrimp Killer- good for people looking for a lighter choice. It didn't come with much eel sauce but when we ordered a second one with extra it was overkill so just compensate with soy or something.  I ordered a Salmon Crunch- much more on the heavier side which is why it only came with six pieces because one piece feels like an entire roll. But very cooked and comes with two sauces on the side to dip them in.  We picked off the rest of my friends scallop crunch roll when the manager Gio (who'd been serving us all night as well) came up to check our IDs for some complimentary drinks for being such frequent customers. This really made up for the off putting vibe we got from the female server who silently got our menus and took our plates with frozen ice on her face.   Nonetheless he really made us feel welcome by remembering us and appreciating our feedback on social media. I got to sample a light peach sparkling sake while my friend got a raspberry sake straight. I would've enjoyed more of it if I weren't driving but it was a great cap to a great meal next to the always amazing banana tempura that is a must for leaving room for!  Beyond satisfied for this trip, already looking forward to next time!",

Our server was very friendly and helpful. The only complaint about service I have is that we didn't see her again toward the last 45 min we were there. We had a different waitress and we weren't asked if we wanted anymore rolls( not that we did ) just if everything was ok once and then once when we asked for the check. we did get our waters refilled many times so that was good. The rolls were very good. I didn't get to try too many since they don't do half rolls (least favorite part about this place). So it made me feel like I didn't get my money's worth. But I would return. I just couldn't give it 4 stars due to the original waitress disappearing.",

Three things blow it away from every other sushi spot; 1. The food 2. The cleanliness 3. The friendly staff. The entrees that are available to eat with AYCE are delicious along with the fresh, mouth watering sushi! The tuna sashimi just melts in your mouth! Also, every time you walk in, and once seated you are in awe of how consistently clean the restaurant is. Dirty dishes never stay on your table for long at all! Lastly, but not least the staff here is always greeting you with a smile from beginning to end! Their priority is making your lunch/dinner a meal to remember, and eventually return to dine on the amazing delectable food! SUSHI WA IS THE PLACE TO BE PEOPLE!!!!",

First thing that impressed us was the menu sign at the door telling us they are open til 4am!! We were further impressed when we walked in & saw how nice the ambience & decor was. Some people were walking out as we walked in & I asked them how it was. One guy right away said \" it's always good!\". Because of what he said my expectations were pretty high - I was not disappointed! We decided to do AYCE so we could try as many things as possible to see what we liked. They had a lot of items to choose from. Our favorite was the kalbi (beef short rib on the menu). The only thing I didn't care for was the ponzu sauce they put on the nigiri I ordered. They did offer to remake it without the sauce but I decided to try it. I have just never seen it served that way. Our server was Celeste & she was great. She checked on us often & got everything we ordered right. We're definitely coming back!",

The waitress was already having an attitude the minute we sat down. After a while, we couldn't finished some rice on a couple of rolls. They were really upset, and we offered to pay the extra charges on it. And they still coming at us at the table, about the regulation, on and on. For 4 different times with different people (servers). The situation escalated, when the Sushi Chef ( The OWNER ), came at my brother at table like a PUNK, so angrily,.. We already offered to pay all the extras, but still they wanted to make a scene out of nothing. They did threatened to call the cops, because we couldn't finished the sushi rice. They could've diffused the situation, but no, they wouldn't let go. Seriously, who would act like PUNK, as an owner of a restaurant. After we left, my brother forgot his phone at the restaurant, so he has to go back. The waiter followed him outside, waited and stood there staring, after they gave his phone back. Bad Bad Business... Sorry, felt disgusted.",

(I found out later that this was, in fact, the case.)  Same went for the baby tuna, and the salmon, and it was simply amazing.    I'd definitely try the Monkey Brain, it was amazingly good, with a shiitake mushroom, cream cheese, and spicy tuna on top, covered in tempura and fried.  Very good.  They have an interesting selection of other fish, as well, and the rolls are pretty good, too.  Keep in mind, from 11:30 to 3, Mon-Sat, they have happy hour, which many of the sushi items are half off, and this is what I recommend to just sit and sample the fresh nigiri.  If you come at dinner, get the rolls.  All of them are gigantic, and more than worth the full price.    The place itself is very well decorated, with stone and contemporary stylings, although the music in there can be hit or miss.  I've been there about 3 times now, and one time it was bouncy loud hip-hop crap with repetitive rhythms and vocalists who talk the whole time instead of singing.  The second time it was techno remixes of pop songs, and that was more bearable.  The third time was nice, with more Japanese style singing and a little bit of a trance feel, and a little bit of a big-band feel.    Very good place over all...  Freshest fish I've ever had.",

    "text": "I hadn't been to SushiWa in forever and decided to revisit the first place I had tried Live Uni (YUM!!) earlier this week. To those who've never dined at this sushi joint, you need to look at the specials board BEFORE you peruse the extensive menu. That's where these talented folks showcase their fresh, seafood delicacies, and you can decide how adventurous you want to be with what you eat! This time around, my bizarre food moment came with my first taste of torigai (Japanese Cockle)... last time, it was geoduck (large clam). That's not to say that the folks at SushiWa don't do everything else... you can certainly find your fair share of fresh sashimi (their yellowtail, salmon and tuna are always good), and all the crazy rolls you can eat. I would also highly recommend their crispy rice -- a thin layer of crisped rice on top of which is a perfect portion of spicy tuna and other accoutrements including some caviar eggs -- DELISH! SushiWa is a little bit more expensive than some of the other sushi joints in town... but I don't mind paying more for a food adventure now and then. GO. And make sure to have your own Andrew Zimmern moment.",

Two things that are easily comparable between restaurants.  Tuna was overly dyed dark red and the yellow tail was the toughest I've ever eaten.  However, the spicy tuna roll was a generous serving.  On top of the disappointment of my dining, I started experiencing food poisoning symptoms a few hours later. Sushiwa put a damper on my plans the whole next day.  Too bad Vegas has no exceptions on their ticket refund policy.",

    "text": "Good sushi, however last time I was there I had a very unsavory experience. The sushi bar was full so my parents and I sat at a booth. I ordered All You Can Eat, and my parents ordered a la cart. When my food was delivered the manager set mine down on the opposite side of the table and said if I wanted to eat I would have to move so that he could see if I was \"sharing\". I HADEN'T EVEN TAKEN A BITE! I told him that I was happy where I was and that I would not move. He argued with me and I told him that I was a very good patron and that my family owned a business in the same complex and that I have been a regular and that I didn't appreciate being treated like a criminal. He huffed and puffed then left. Another waiter who overheard came over and apologized saying that the manager was awful and a 'dick'. I had to agree. The owner was not there that day and apparently the manager got a big head with the little responsibility. He continued to circle my table, watching me like a hawk while I finished my food. While the food was great, I couldn't enjoy it. And honestly, if I hand't been so hungry I would have gotten up and left in the beginning. My dad was fuming and disgusted and the manager. After years of going there, we haven't been back since.",

    "text": "I eat out at least 5 days a week, and this was the worse experienced ever.  The food was good and well presented.  It would have getting a 4 stars but the service took them down to 1 star.  There were 3 of us and we all getting AYCE.  It was almost 30 mins before our order was taking.  Even we sat at the sushi bar, the waitress takes our order not the sushi chef.  The order then put in to the head Chef and only then the other chef only make what the head chef tell them.  After finished our first orders,  we wait another 20 minutes and the waitress never came by, finally my friend stop her as she dash through and rudely, raise her voice at my friend, \"YEAH!!!\" my friend reply, \"can we order?\"  she gave him a mean, dirty, irritated look. It seem that we are inconvenient them.  As I look over to my friend, I noticed the waitress was complain to anther waitress and pointed at us.  And I can only assumed that she was complaining how much we order.  Even we only order 3 items each time.  We thought that we were having AYCE???? are we not??? I can deal with the slow service  but straight out rude to our face,  It got me so pissed off that I want to write a review right there and then. Then my friend did not know that one of the dish that he order was consider a sashimi, he thought it was an appetizer so he order a sashimi plate,  instead reply nicely she sound like she was wanting to fight him that he already order 1 allow sashimi per person. I got my order and another 30 minutes gone by she finally come by and wonder if we need anything else,  my friend say that he still waiting for his order and she act surprise after she notice that I was on my phone writing a review, she was nice and apologetic.  Then she ask if my daughter and I want anything else, we told her that we had order desert from the other waitress 20 minutes ago.  At this time All I want to do is get out of this place, before my blood pressure goes up.",

Really didn't want to even tip 10% but I could never do that even as horrible as it was. We tipped 18%, thinking maybe she was just having a horrible night, or maybe the customer service field isn't the right choice of profession.

But that's a really hardly a quibble when you're talking about the fantastically savory menu--food and drink--here. I love the decor and the service has been splendid whether I've come as two or twenty-two (the latter being my first experience and we damn near ran the kitchen out the house with the all you can eat option). Speaking of that opportunity--they call it the AYCE--if you've got the hungry and the stomach space to match, do it. You won't regret it save for the weight gain. Get your sushi here.",

The food here is exceptional, all of it! The sushi chefs are great! The only downer here, and keep in mind we come here often and this has occured a lot lately, the service is not the best. We noticed that if you sit at the bar this is not an issue but if you sit at a table, forget about it. Our last visit was the tipping point, waited for ten minutes and nobody approached us to order or even ask for our drink order. The guy who seated us passed by and we had to flag him and ask if we could order, he signaled to a lady and said she would take our order....well we waited and waited and she didn't even acknowledged us. Well he came back with his note pad and asked if we would be doing all you can eat. After ordering my appetizer and some sushi, the sushi arrived first and no sign of my appetizer? Asked the waiter and he was was like \"oh yes\" and went to the back and then brought it to us. Best advice, just eat at the bar.  Update: we came here again and sat at the bar this time. Everything was excellent!",

Today was my Mom's birthday and she chose to celebrate her birthday here, at Sushi Wa. They don't take reservations, which is a bummer, but we were able to walk in and be seated in a booth in about 5 minutes. Aaron was our server and was awesome! The service was super quick even though they were short staffed and busy for a Monday night. The food was delicious, the atmosphere was great and the staff was super friendly. All of the staff, including one of the chefs and the manager, joined our server with singing my Mom Happy Birthday while presenting her with her dessert. The staff went above and beyond to make this night special for us! We will continue to come here for all of our sushi cravings- there's no other place in town that I'd rather go for AYCE Sushi.",

Because of this, they asked that we move seats, abuelita was uncomfortable moving seats at the triangle shaped table so they watched us like hawks to ensure we weren't sharing between a la carte and AYCA. At one point, the manager got loud, waived his finger at my kid yelling, \"you cannot share!\"  He was wrong- they were sticking to the \"rules\" and sharing between a la carte orders. I had an exchange with him and for the rest of the meal he sent his largest statured busser to circle our table.  It's a shame. Chefs are excellent, server was fantastic and visibly uncomfortable with her manager.  ...we're not returning.",

This is my first Yelp review ever and I just felt I needed to write it so maybe the staff can sharpen some of their skills.  The wait staff was incredibly disorganized, we had about 5 different waiters/waitresses and we never knew who to order from. When asking someone to take our order they seemed annoyed but with the various changes we didn't know who to ask.   Additionally, the staff truly did not check in on us at all and also were rude about the rules for AYCE, even though we have eaten AYCE before.  The only person who seemed to have POTENTIAL was the young girl who was waitress. However, truly bad service overall.   If you are looking for a quick bite, don't come here you'll be here hours waiting for your food or someone to check on you.",

You can pick just about anything off of the two-sided menu to order. However, be mindful of the color-coded symbols next to some of the items, because some items can only be ordered once as part of the AYCE special. And, it's more than just sushi: soup, teriyaki meals, appetizers, etc. Rolls are customizable (within reason) and I haven't had anything that I didn't like.   They sell Coke! In town that seems to be pro-Pepsi, it's so nice to have a nice cold Coke.  Service can be a little slow at times (not the wait for the food, but the initial acknowledgment from your server, which is a little odd since the restaurant isn't that large). However, their overall staff is pretty attentive, refilling drinks and clearing plates at a healthy pace.   This has become our \"go to\" sushi place for us. I can't wait to start bringing our out-of-town guests here.",

Don't you think we should have been charged the lunch rate for the AYCE? Well, we weren't. We started ordering rolls and eventually, they started coming out-- everyone's but mine. I waited over a half hour to get my first roll. My family had already received-- and eaten-- 3 rolls before my first one came out. When I asked one of the servers if he could please check on my rolls, he was rude. The service was truly deplorable. We had to ask over and over again about the status of our rolls. It took 2 hours to get out of there. Why? Because they repeatedly forgot to bring us rolls, and then, to make matters worse, their payment system went down. They asked us to wait while they tried to get to get it up and running.  Forty-five minutes later, they brought me a piece of paper (handwritten) and told me that this was the \"approximate bill\". Sorry, but I don't work with approximate bills when you're dealing with over $100! I told them this and then miraculously, their point of sale system began to work again. And they had charged us for dinner AYCE, rather than lunch. Ridiculous! This was a big occasion for me and Sushi Wa ruined it. I will NEVER go back!",

    "text": "Came in yesterday with my bf. We'd recently been going to this place in Henderson by pink box donuts that also has ayce but on Sundays they close at midnight and our date night didn't start till around 11:30pm so we had to find another place. We decided to give this place a shot since it was open until 4am and also offered ayce. I am sad to say I was disappointed. We got seated right away and our server was really nice, unfortunately I didn't get his name. But he is the reason I am leaving 2 stars in stead of 1. He asked if we were doing ayce and we said yes, I ordered the California, shrimp tempura, 007 and the caterpillar. Don't remember what my bf ordered besides the bikini roll but he didn't enjoy any of them. As for me I didn't really care for the California or the caterpillar which is my typically my favorite. I did enjoy the 007 and the shrimp tempura however. What I typically love about ayce is that you're given the opportunity to explore the menu and try new things which I was eager to do since this was our first time here. But as we were giving the menu a look over after stacking up some of the plates we were done with we noticed this section of rules for ayce in the menu. One of those rules is that you'll be charged full price for any rolls you don't finish. Then I looked over at the plates we had decided we were done with and had a few left over pieces. Then our waiter came around to pick up our plates and let us know about the \"if you don't finish your entire roll you'll be charged full price for it\" rule. We told him we had just seen that. It would've been nice if he would've let us known about this rule when we first got there and said yes to doing the ayce. Luckily he was nice and told us he would let it slide this time because it was our first time here and wasn't a big deal to him but that if we ever came back and especially with him not being our waiter we will be getting charged full price. We thanked him and then decided to just not order anything else because we knew we were bound to have more leftovers and didn't want to take advantage of him saying he would let it slide this time. This just ruined the whole experience for us if I'm being honest. I've never been to an ayce sushi place or any place for that matter  that makes you pay full price for something if you have any left overs. Kinda ruins the whole point of ayce to me. That being said they should definitely let customers know about this rule once you tell the waiter you're doing ayce. Another rule that was off putting for me was that for any parties of 6 or more people an 18% tip will be added to you bill. I work at a coffee shop and whenever I turn the screen for customers to let them decide if they'd like to tip I let them know there's no pressure and no matter what they tip I thank them because they are in no obligation of having to tip. Leaving a tip is a choice made by the customer not something they are pressured into.",

I've had a few okay things here but over all the sushi quality is very poor, the only good thing about this spot is that they're open late. Today we came here cause we didn't realize Kazien was closed till 4 pm on sundays. Our service was slow even though the place was dead. I had to ask our server on 4 separate occasions to fill up my water, they never pre bussed our table, I will never come back here. If you're looking for good sushi kazien is just 1 minute down the road (literally) same price and great quality !!!!!",

Never did I think I was gonna step foot in this spot again...if you read my previous review, this was way back during the Yang Dynasty and was our first Yelptern's UYE where we were held captive....Ugh!  A former Goyemon employee suggested I come try this place out as they made some changes and things have gotten better and that they're still in the process of making things better...okay cool, so we arrive with an open mind into a comfy booth, go with AYCE ($26.95) and we order an assortment of things. Assorted nigiri, a few appetizers, hot items(dynamite, kalbi), a Pocky Roll, some sashimi one order per person, AYCE Dinner only,  also some uni and Amaebi which are also one order per person.  The atmosphere is cool and the fish quality and presentations are solid, and the apps were delicious. The only downside is that the sushi rice was totally bland and needs work. I'm glad we got to try Sushi Wa out again,  but they need to also offer half rolls, a few more side dishes,  and add flavor to the rice in order to compete with other AYCE Sushi spots around town.

    "text": "Tonight I came here with my husband as a treat to myself for dreadful month end accounting that I am about to endure.  It pains me to say that I did not truly enjoy this place; maybe I would have a year ago. A year ago, my sushi preferences had no standards, sauce me up and make it crispy.   When we arrived, we were kindly seated to a large booth for just the two of us. We for a moment felt like kings and the bar got set really high. Within a minute of sitting down, a young gentleman came and took our drink order. He got our drinks (me water with lemon and my husband an Asahi pint for $5). As soon as he came back with our drinks a minute or so later, he asked to take our order. We weren't ready and asked for 5 minutes to look over the menu. He said \"sure\" gave a wink and went on his way. My husband and I found him charming and we both exclaimed how much we thought he was going to be a good waiter.   Unfortunately, he did not come back. We had a female waiter who was nice as well who replaced him, it just kind of came out of nowhere.  The female waiter came to our table and we asked a couple questions to determine if we understood the rules correctly before getting AYCE for dinner. At that moment, we put in an order for 4 rolls and a white fish with ponzu sauce sashimi.  The rolls we got were: Mountain Roll, Pocky Roll, Bonsai Roll, Energy Roll. The rolls came out within a few minutes of ordering and we were ready to feast.    At a first glance, each roll looked good in appearance. They weren't particularly bite size and I found a roll to be more than my mouth could handle at one time. Additionally, the Pocky Roll should not be called a roll. It is really a mound of imitation crab meat with a few accents of fresh fish covered in avocado slices. This was good, but also not very \"fresh\" tasting even though it is on the \"fresh fish roll\" menu portion. I believe this item should be moved to the appetizer portion of the menu, because we were surprised when it arrived. My husband was not interested in this, so I struggled to eat it by myself.  Now my criticism for the other rolls, Mountain, Energy, and Bonsai is all the same. Each of these rolls were over sauced. We love sauce, so when we say over sauced, we mean over sauced. Out of all the rolls, the Bonsai was our favorite because it tasted the freshest and most balanced. However, it was not good enough for a return visit. The sashimi was the best part of our meal thus far.  So we finish our first order, and we are waiting for the waitress to come back by. I had been out of water for a while now and we hadn't seen our waiter since being served.  Thankfully, there was cross fit silliness being shown on TV to distract me from my empty water glass and dry mouth. Meanwhile, waiters were helping out families at other tables and refilling their cups.   By the time she came back, we were kind of ready to give up. I asked for a miso soup, and we also order ice cream deserts. Weirdly enough chocolate sauce came on our ice cream (strawberry mocha and green tea ice cream) and I never received the miso soup .I didn't bother to correct the wait staff because I was ready to leave.   Oh yeah, for whatever reason, the central table in the restaurant was being used a busing station. It was collecting dirty plates and it had the water pitches waiters were filling patron's glasses with.  Overall, if Taco Bell is good Mexican food to you, then you will think this is good sushi. Otherwise, it is what it is. This is the most expensive sushi place I have been to that provides this quality of food. I do not see myself returning for a visit until I hear about positive changes in the quality of food and improvement with wait staff tending to guests.  I apologize if the review seems harsh, but I hope that it makes a positive impact on this restaurant.",

The atmosphere was nice and the service was great. The music is a bit loud but not too loud where you can't hear each other and the booth provided nice privacy. Definitely going to have to make this a regular spot.",

I sent it back  just to let them know since it was AYCE so the price doesn't change.  The Chef tried to convince me it was Hamachi belly.  He backed off when I told him truthfully that I eat sushi weekly.  Even if it was Hamachi belly, it should be fresh.  It tasted sour and has obviously been sitting around.  They said they would give me another part of the fish.  I asked for Hamachi from another fish.  I didn't get any.  I didn't get much service either.  One of the chefs perfunctorily asked how everything was.  I began to complain and he shut me down and ignored me.  What is the point of asking?  To add insult to injury, I waited for a long time for my check to be processed.  I asked about it and the waitress rudely said that their machine was offline and that I'd have to wait.  Well, wouldn't it have been nice if somebody let me know they are having tech difficulties instead of letting me sit there and stew?  No attempt at service recovery was made.",

Not only was everything fresh and delicious, IT WAS ALL YOU CAN FREAKIN' EAT.   YES. I believe it was about $26 for dinner...my party and I probably ate over $700 worth of fish...like to the point where I started feeling BAD that I practically ate the whole entire ocean...but in a cruel sort of good way...my bad Ariel XD  Food aside, the restaurant itself is very, very nice. It's dark but sophisticated and feels very fancy. Their presentation is impeccable as well. They make sure every slice of sashimi is placed perfectly and that every plate is fresh and clean. The waiters are exceptionally kind and so are the sushimen. They carved up A LOT of fish for us that night. KUDOS!   All in all, if you're near Henderson or Vegas and looking for some legit sushi/sashimi, hit this place up. No regrets. I promise! :]",

At first glance I thought I might be disappointed because the use to have a half price lunch special, but has been replaced by the all you can eat and if anybody is like me they go in on the sushi when its good. The menu for lunch is pretty much all inclusive except for a few items like the sashimi and other more expensive items but every things a go for dinner. I fell in love with this place for their unagi and albacore, but everything is delicious and the portions unlike many other in Vegas are big.   Even though I've tried most sushi places in the city I always come back to Sushi Wa, so give it a try if you're in the neighborhood......and if you're brave try the oyster shooter which is included in the special, the oyster is huge but delicious. Enjoy!!",

Like other people have mentioned the other issue we've had is service. They can take too long even on non-busy days and the lady everyone describes as a \"manager in a red polo\" is a BITCH. She kept hurrying us through our order and would constantly remind us we had to finish everything we ordered..WTF?.. The food is that good that we refuse to leave..(unless we find a new sushi place that blows this one out of the water);)   BIKINI ROLL!! AMAZING Firecraker Baked Mussels SHRIMP KILLER ROLL!!

    "text": "Took my dad and 2 brother here for dinner to celebrate my dad's belated birthday..  THE FOOD: 4/5 First and most importantly...the food was really good. Albeit desserts, the banana tempura and coffee Mochi were amazing and is one of the main components that would favor the odds in me going again. The diverse variety of interesting  Rolls and side dishes is what I liked most about this establishment. Some definitely better than others, but it all ultimately comes down to personal preference.  SUSHI CHEF/SERVICE: 1/5 Now the service was on the other hand was very disappointing and unwelcoming. When being seated, we asked to sit at the bar to where we could have a view of the tv. (which had my dads favorite team playing that night for Thursday night football) We asked to seat near the middle of the bar and was told they were closing this section down for the night. I asked if they were reserved but was told that section of the bar was not going to be available for customers and would not be seating anyone on that side for the night. So, we were sat in the left corner of the bar near the restrooms where there is little to no view of the tv, which isn't a huge deal to be honest because we were all talking/enjoying each other's company, & if we wanted to eat somewhere to watch sports we'd of gone to Buffalo Wild Wings or something lol. Really not an issue, but definitely a bit annoying considering the fact that within the next 5-10 minutes, as new customers arrived, they were greeted more welcoming and provided more favorable service with no restrictions when asking to sit at the bar, \"Yes, of course, please sit anywhere you'd like.\"Couple that with the fact that every time we'd order anything, our chef was lacking professionalism and displayed bad manners/service. He kept insisting on making it a point that if we didn't finish the food they'd charge us extra. Which is understandable to let your customers know this, especially considering we did order a lot of food, but when your out trying to celebrate a birthday it definitely gives off bad vibes when your chef keeps reminding you of this rule every 3 seconds. Definitely lost major points with us given the fact that with each additional order his body language and tone continued to become noticeably more and more negative/pissy. Several times while he came over to collect new requests, he would hear the first one and while myself or someone in my party would begin to make a new request for other items he would ignore, cut off or immediately walk away while we were speaking to ignore additional requests. Needless to say we did finish everything we ate. But the service from being seated to dealing with the pissy-attitude chef was very underwhelming to say the least.  WAITING STAFF: 4/5 The waitresses/waiters who were running out drinks and side dishes however were extremely polite and professional and were very prompt and attentive to our needs. Outside of the seating situation we had initially had upon arriving, they were exceptional. The servers, specifically the middle aged Asian women who was working that night, were the only reason we decided to tip 20% and are the main reason we did not leave the place with a a bad taste in our mouths from the shortcomings of the chef.   Overall 3/5. Food was good. Service needs to get better. Sucks because all it takes is one person to ruin it for everyone. However in this case that \"one person\" happens to play a very important part in your restaurant. Hope for the future customers that they do not experience this as this NEEDS to be corrected. That chef is NOT an accurate representation of how the overall staff was. I do not over react like others who when experiencing bad service will immediately bash and do the most to make an establishment look bad. Not a horrible/unbearable experience by any means, the food was good and dishes were more creative than your typical sushi bar, but when there is so much competition here in Vegas, places like this simply cannot afford to underwhelm in the service department.   Food for thought.",

I was suprised that although it was Weds there was no one else in the place. The decor is nice but they don't serve vodka, just wine and beer.   Would definitely return for more monkey brain!!",

The server had to correct my friend when he pronounced the menu wrong. Also, she had to correct me when I did not remember what they DId NOt have. ( I personally think that all the items on the menu should be available and customers do not have to memorize what they have and not). Also, the server forced us to finish all the foods. like when we tried to order more, she said, \" you know you have to finish all\" and we said okay.   I wouldn't have to go there If i was going to get that service. I would have not went even it was a Free Meal.",

When we sat down the waitress in her 40 or 50 with short hair came over with a not happy face.  We were trying to order our drink and she wasn't patient and just said I will bring you all water and hot tea.  We had a toddler with us and had to stop her from leaving to order our child an apple juice .  She did not seem happy.  Near the end of the meal we were satisfied except the rice has a weird vinegar taste.  However, we had left some rice and shrimp heads on the plate.  She informed us that she would have to charge us for not eating everything.  SHRIMP heads.  Not everyone is gonna eat that.  Come to our surprise she charged us an additional $35 for these items.  It is only $27 per person for all you can eat.  We were also automatically charged a 18% tip because we were in a group.    Moral of the story.  If you order all you can eat from this place be prepared to eat everything or they will charge you.  We won't be coming back and we will tell everyone we know not to go there.",
