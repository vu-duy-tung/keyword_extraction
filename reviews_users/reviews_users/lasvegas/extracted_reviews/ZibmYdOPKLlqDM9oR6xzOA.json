    "text": "I've been to the one on Windmill and it was packed so when I heard there was going to be one in Summerlin I was stoked.  The thing that sold me on this place was the fried egg.  Almost every burger I get now everywhere has to have a fried egg on top.  I feel like it just completes the meal.  It's a much larger location that the one in Henderson and it is right next to the movie theater so it makes a perfect dinner and date movie.    Started off with oxtail chili cheese fries with the garlic chili aioli and fried egg.  Then the next thing was our rare burgers.  Very juicy, with a fried egg,  Kiki burger.  Quite honestly the best burger bun I've ever had.  My friend finished it off with a marshmallow shake with salty caramel sauce.  My server(s)- (shift change) - we're very informative.",

My wife ordered hers protein style and all the lettuce came out coated in oil. She's ordered it this way before, and it's never been served with oil. Forget about sending it back, we would never see it again. The host was setting the tables up for doom. Too many tables sat at the same time in the same servers section made it a 10 minute wait for drinks. Oh and pointing to my table from across the room doesn't feel like seating me. Our server forgot our drinks twice, and when our burgers finally did come, it only took another ten minutes for our fries to arrive. After we had to ask about them. I watched two other tables sending back food.  I loved your food, but I'm not headed back anytime soon, last night felt like a waste of money to me.",

    "text": "I'm not sure when the last time I reviewed anything, but this place is worth mentioning and telling our story.  We had a total of 4 adults and 2 kids under 3.  We ordered 3 burgers and some shakes.  Our bill was $75.00......   So if your bill is kind of high like this I wouldn't really care if the food was good (which I had last year  and it was great), and service is also great.  Service was HORRIBLE.  I understand people get busy and they need to help other tables, but this lady was rude and non helpful through our whole experience.   First off this place doesn't have anyone working the hostess stand.  This lady came out of know where and yelled at my mom and was very rude to her about how long we had to wait and that was that.  I was pissed and wanted to go somewhere else, but my mom insist we stayed.  Unfortunately we got this chick that yelled at my mom for a server!!!!  She took over 15 minutes to order our food.  People sat down after us and ordered and got their food before we even ordered.  It took forever to get our food, our drinks including a soda (from the time we ordered our drinks, she said the shakes will take a while but the fountain coke also took 10 minutes too).  Overall the food was good, but I was so pissed I ended up hating it and couldn't enjoy it at all.  I'm so mad that we went there when I already got a bad taste from the wait time and that lady barking at us.  I suggest if you want to go here, go to fuku burger.  If your going to spend $75 on 2 burgers, 1 kids burger and a salad, at least at fuku you will get better service.  Or you might not get that disgruntle employee from bachi.  Bottom line is they don't care about customer service or making their patrons happy.  Order #111753 Table:23 Station:3 server VID   p.s., shakes were really good, not sure if I would want to go there and experience that again for a shake......",

We heard so much about this place and we are so glad we tried the food here. I had the \"kiki's burger\" which was a burger with caramelized bacon, guyere cheese and enoki and eryngii mushrooms (I've never heard of eryngii mushrooms but they were delicious).  Even before the burgers came out, the sweet potatoe fries and the truffle, Parmesan fries with sun dried tomato aioli and porcini cream sauce were awesome!  You HAVE to try that.

    "text": "This location is so close to the house that it could be dangerous... With that being said, I've been to this location 3x already.  On my first trip, the Spicy Miso burger was mind blowing!. Being a hybrid Yoshi I though that putting Aka Miso on a burger was ingenious! It had me hooked at first bite. The burger had a nice zing to it however at the same time you could taste the quality of the meat. It was so good that I came back a few days later for one. Unfortunately the encore came up a little short. It lacked the same zest and boom that made me fall in love with the first one. The first one was popping with the spicy miso flavor however the second was lacking all of the above and was just a burger...  On my third visit I got the Kalbi burger, I was hoping that it would be something crazy like ground kalbi but it once again was on the mild side and just kalbi sauce. Very timid, but decent nonetheless.   I would go out to say that the only thing that was consistent was the fries. The garlic fries were nom each time. I really didn't care for the truffle fries as they were a bit messy and more confusion vs fusion (but that's just my opinion).   I will address the reviews with issues about service. Each time we dined here, service was fine. I never had to ask for water refills and was consistently checked up on so I will put my neck out and disagree with the service issues.  I really hope that the next Spicy Miso I get will blow me away and make me fall in love with this place again. The last star depends on it!   AND word on the street is that Buldogi's (right down the parking lot) has Korean fusion burgers on the menu.",

It opened while I was on vacation so this is the first place I ate after we got off the plane. I have been here two times so far and have been delighted each time! The first time I came here I ordered the Lobster Roll which was tasty but if you don't like a strong curry taste then don't order it. The curry is strong in this dish. It came with root chips which were nice and crunchy. We also ordered the truffle fries which were delicious!  My husband had a cold so they suggested their green tea which really helped him.  The second time we ate here I got the Kiki burger which had these yummy mushrooms! I love mushrooms especially if they are sauteed. They warned me ahead of time that the burger is not made well done. That was perfectly fine with me because I like my burgers juicy! It was amazing! I also tried one of their drinks that had jasmine in it.  The drink was good but if you don't like your mouth feeling flowery then you may not like it. I thought it was cool!  I love that this place is so close to home!",

On the first visit we didn't have any problems.  We tried the Myagi-san?? Grassfed beef burger.  It was delicious.    Our last visit was such a mess that it would leave a sour taste in anyone's mouth.  I was disappointing because we had a first timer along and I had been raving...needless to say, she wasn't impressed.    Both times I've been they have switched servers on us mid-meal.  This seems to cause a little too much confusion.  Our edamame took 30 minutes.  That is just a wee excessive for edamame.  We ordered tea, never got it, but were still charged for it.  My hubby didn't get peppers on his burger so they said they would get him some - everyone finished eating and his burger was cold and still no peppers.  They never even ordered them.  Just one thing after another,  It was frustrating.    The food was still great.  I tried the chili chicken app, it was lightly breaded and flavorful.  I also tried the toasted marshmallow and salted caramel milkshake - very tasty!  I won't give up on bachi burger but they need to get it together over there!  At this point I'd probably drive the 25 miles across town to ensure a good experience.",

Just waiting for that perfect moment to spend $10+ on a burger. Yes, it is a tad expensive, but honestly it is worth it when you decide to jump in.   Overall the experience was spot-on and the food was pretty much perfect. I had the Miyagi-San Burger, grass-fed Wagyu beef, Chili Mayo, Fried Egg, Furikake, Caramelized Bacon, and Crispy Onion Rings, and I added cheddar cheese for an additional charge. This burger came out perfectly, the bun glistened, the egg oozed, the onion rings were crispy, and the cheese was melted perfectly. The beef is high quality, the grilling to medium-well done very nicely. The flavors all work together to make it truly one of the best burgers I have ever eaten.  My friend and I also shared the Grilled Shishito Peppers, which are sweet and tasty, with a bit of char. And the sweet potato fries - long-cut, skinny, deliciously sweet and salty as the same time - not one soggy one in the bunch! I highly recommend these fries if you like sweet potatoes!  Also of note - they have a good happy hour, with food and drinks. I had a white wine for only 3 bucks, and it was a decent one at that.  Highly recommended - and my personal return factor is a definite YES.",

No tomatoe on both burgers and they both came with it. My burger fell apart and was a mess,,, wouldn't even stay together and the bread for so soggy ... Granted there was a fried egg on it. For 2 burgers for fifty bucks it just wasn't worth it for the service/taste of the food. Would not recommend this place and will not be returning",

    "text": "Just when I thought that fusion food was nothing more than sad attempts to gimmick people into eating their food and was going to give up on the trend completely, Bachi Burger came along and completely changed my mind. This place does fusion right by taking it seriously and putting tons of detail into everything on their menu. The ingredients are fresh and diverse. All the items on the menu have a unique taste which makes you want to try everything on the menu at least once.   If you are not a burger person that is fine, they have great non-beef options like the crusty-crab burger and the salmon burger. Both are great and possibly healthier alternatives to the normal beef burger. Also the Pork Belly Buns are freaking amazing and really make you doubt getting a burger when you could have those. All the burgers I have tried are great especially the special ones that are not included on the menu.   If you go and it is your first time you have to order the Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries. They could just serve those and I would keep going back for more.  They also serve craft beers which gives them an automatic bump in the ratings. :)",

It's nice to see local eats getting well-deserved attention.  I'm just happy as a clam that Bachi Burger #2 opened up in my neighborhood and it's just as good as the original.  It was my date's first time ever at Bachi and mine at this new location in Village Square.  We walked right in on Thursday night and were seated immediately.  Service was very attentive; our waitress checked on us often and certainly knew her beer, recommending a good one for me, who seldom drinks the stuff.  We started with steamed edamame, moving on to the Black and Green burger for myself and the Ronin burger for him with regular fries that we shared. The food came out quickly and we enjoyed every juicy bite. Bachi joins Firefly at Village Square in being two great food choices for those of us on the Westside.  Welcome to the neighborhood; we'll be back!",

This place is great for after a movie, lunch, dinner, or just to grab take out as I've done before.  What I really enjoyed here was the variety of types of burgers whether you enjoy beef, fish, turkey, or chicken.  I've only had \"The Lonely Bird\" and \"Bachi Fish\" but everyone I've eaten who's joined me here has enjoyed what they've ordered.  The key to making this place different is their delicious buns and variety of sauces both really add to the flavor experience.  I do recommend going with a few people and ordering sweet potato or garlic fries with a variety of sauces.",

(Sorry Whopper bar).    Bachi Burger may have it all.  The texture, the color, the flavor.... YUM really says it all.  The place is a bit dark but the service was good. The combinations of beef and toppings, whether you prefer Angus or Wagyu, all seem to work well.  Their fries are good too.   If you prefer a traditional burger, or to pick your toppings you can do that too.  All in all this is one of the better burger options.",

    "text": "Watching food porn before bed can be as dangerous as going to the grocery store hungry.  About a year ago while watching Diners, Drive Ins, and Dives, they visited Bachi Burger.  Now i live in Canada, and i was close to debating a road trip, just to have some of those chili fries.  While planning a recent trip to Vegas, i remembered Bachi, and immediately put that on the itinerary.  They have two locations, we went to the newer one, and only had to wait about 5 minutes for a table.  I didn't have to look at the menu, i had it planned months ago what i was going to order, the oxtail chili cheese fries with garlic aioli and a fried egg a top.    It came to the table and it was everything that i wanted.  The fries, even with all of the toppings remained surprising crisp, and the gravy was more of a ragu, and it was rich and delicious.  The problem with restaurants being on TV is that they will showcase a few dishes.  Now coming from another country you want to try as many dishes as possible, especially the burgers.  At Bachi they have sliders, so it would be nice if they could make the fries in a smaller size, so that you can try a burger as well.  My sister ordered the kiki, which they made on DDD's, and she gave me one bite, and it was my biggest food regret from that trip of not ordering a burger because i was so full from the fries.   Overall, it is a very basic strip mall restaurant from the outside, but where they knock your socks off is in the flavour department.  They are not shy, their food is bold, and i cannot wait to come back.",

I had the spicy miso - came out hot, flavor was great, but I think I prefer the Miyagi San.  My wife had the regular burger.  Between the 2, mine was a lot better.  Side of truffle fries were very good too. For some reason our server wasn't on top of her game.  Tables that sat after us had food before we did.  Our burgers came out first and our server said she'd bring our fries out right away, but then she started clearing the plates from her other table first.  I had found an old gift card that I had received from this location and the server said that they didn't have the equipment to honor it.  It didn't look like this was typical of the other tables, and I've always had excellent service in the past. I'd go out of my way to come here.",

First off, bison meat is so tender and juicy and taste 100 times better than a beef patty! The Brie cheese was a great touch to the burger instead of the other classic boring cheeses. Their was caramelized onions and a fig jam that brought a tangy sweet taste in the burger.. I thought the fig jam was a genius ingredient to add.. it reminded me of a Barbour sauce burger except tastier because BBQ sauce seems to over power the flavor of the burger itself.  The fries were okay.. but the ketchup was awesome (it was pineapple ketchup). Definitely made it to my top 3 burger list",

A different waiter visited our table as my order came out a 3rd time and I asked if it was company policy to just wipe off burgers made incorrectly (obviously his response was \"no\"). Ridiculous and lazy!   Will not be returning any time soon, seeing as there are plenty of other burger places and service generally sucks at this location, anyway. Service at this location is slow and every time I order, my meal arrives with some error requiring me to send it back (last time it was cooked incorrectly and took several tries to get to right cook- the cook this time was past well done and had no furikake for some reason, but mayo was more important issue).  When service is better, or if I move closer to the windmill location, I'll be back.",

We thoroughly enjoyed both our food and service, as well as the ambience of the location.  Shortly after we entered, we were greeted by the seating host, who kindly showed us to our table. We were seated near the kitchen, which was a real treat because we got to see where the magic happened as we waited for our food. They have a wide array of beverages, both alcoholic and not, to cater to people with all kinds of tastes. I ordered the Thai iced tea, which was simply heavenly.  We skipped out on appetizers, which--after seeing how delicious they looked--rang through as a clear mistake. The burgers offered at this restaurant are unlike any I've ever seen in my years of burger-devouring: fresh, unique, and packed full of extraordinary flavor combinations. I ordered the Black & Green burger, which was cooked and prepared to perfection; it included spinach, bacon, blue cheese, and some of the best sauteed mushrooms I've ever tasted. The bun itself perfectly complemented the burger, in both taste and texture.  A majority of the burgers on the menu unfortunately don't include fries, though their selection of fries is godly. My particular favorites are the Truffle Parmesan fries and the Salt & Pepper Garlic fries. Each is served in a massive cone with some highly delectable condiments, including their homemade pineapple ketchup. I didn't have any dessert because my meal was so filling, though I'll definitely be giving it a shot when I return.",

They did have a a ground chicken / turkey called the lost bird and I have to say it was huge and good.  The bun they used is not your typical burger bun, but what u get when ordering a baked pork bun, if you ever had it.  I loved the bun they used.  Good twist to make it an Asian fusion burger.

Aside from a really long wait before even meeting our waiter, bringing us the wrong burger and informing us we'll have to pay for it still (even if it was a couple bucks more doesn't matter to me) But it still wasn't what we ordered, already fed up with the service at this point I agreed in hopes of just enjoying my meal with my father who was a first timer here. This wasn't really the impression I wanted him to get.   I think next time I'll just head to the other location.",

It's an Asian infusion restaurant . Pretty much the whole restaurant has that vibe. The moment people discover that Asian infused food require a Much more complex and acquired taste, that only those who know the honest delicacies of \"food\" will know. On top of it all the best server to give me this experience is the man that goes by Marquis. He makes this restaurant glow, and without him the vibe will never be the same! Keep it going Bachi!

Lunch specials start at $19 and go up from there and I didn't feel like taking out a loan for a burger lunch  I ordered a la cart the regular 7oz Bachi Burger that only comes with lettuce, onion and tomato (no cheese) for lunch because it was only $8 (hear anything special so far for $8?) plus I had truffle fries for $4.50. Ok so now you all know I am cheap, on to the food -  The burger was cooked very well but simply nothing at all was on it except those three items. It was comparable to any other burger I have purchased. Now, they had burgers with all sorts of exotic ingredients available but those were too pricey for me ($12-$16 range).  The fries were good but you could get some just as good at Smashburger in my humble opinion.   I don't mind paying good money for value. Maybe I'm not \"chichi\" enough for this place?  I definitely think value is overestimated here with the prices and have trouble because I could have eaten a steak at Outback down the street for less and been more satisfied.  We all know that's nothing to brag about and neither is this place.",

When I signed the slip with no tip the cashier became rude and brushed me off with a halfway goodbye.  Why should I have tipped you when you obviously ignored me and then acted like I was bothering you from your duties. C'mon have some common sense. The hiring manager needs to reconsider who they accept as employees because judging from other reviews I am not the only complaint. Other than that GREAT FOOD!",

The sauce tasted like a somewhat less sweet General Tso's.  The burgers were unique and very tasty.  I had the Banh Mi burger.  It was very good, with a complex flavor and a dipping sauce.  If I hadn't known that it was a burger, I wouldn't have recognized it as such.  My brother had the Miyagi-san burger.   This was more recognizably a burger, but a bit different too.  The parmesan fries were very good.    Overall an interesting meal.  Don't go here if you're in the mood for a burger.  Go here for a change of pace from a burger.",

I ordered the Miyagi-sans Grass Fed Wagyu Burger. It was piled high, mostly with the beef patty and onion strings. It was hard to put in my mouth, but once I managed to smash it in, it was like biting into my dream food. Juicy, plump meat with fresh, perfectly cooked bacon and onion strings. Ahhh, so good.  We also ordered a sangria, which I didn't care for, but finished anyway. It was a tad too bitter for my taste.   We also tried their Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries, which came in a large portion, and were also very good, but had slightly unusual toppings. I've definitely never had chili cheese fries with fried egg before. But it was good!  We'll definitely be hitting up this place again the next time we're in Vegas!",

The one thing that stuck out to me about this place was that it has a very sleek and modern feel to it allot of hard wood everywhere and very little decorations making it feel very clean.   The service was really good. The server was attentive and very knowledgeable. We ordered a Mr. Myagi Burger and some garlic pepper fries to be split between my wide and myself as I was not sure if we'd truly like the place. When the food came out the presentation of it was definitely top notch. You could tell that they use high quality beef just by looking at it. When I cut into the burger immediately the juices started flowing out letting me know that this was going to be a very tasteful burger. The beef on this burger was to die for it is definitely some of the highest quality beef that I have seen used on burgers. My wife is not a big beef eater and even she loved it which says allot. The fries were ok they definitely lacked a taste of garlic.  The reason for my 4 stars is because the meat was that good. I'm not a fan but I can't down high quality. However the price to me seemed a bit high, but I guess you do pay for what you get, but if that is truly the case then I truly didn't get my monies worth on the fries but the burger was stupendous.  Will consider trying this place again perhaps with a gropoun or some type of deal.",

A bevy of Dogfish Head & Rogue seasonals and special brews (this particular trip was My Antonia, an imperial pils with hops that'll kill a lesser man) plus a sake menu that propriety dictates I shouldn't wade into for the simple fact that I'll have to drive home following this foray.   Service: Very attentive and not shy about suggesting their favorite burgers, which was helpful for me as a newbie. Water never got less than half full (and was refilled & looked after by everyone walking by, not just my primary server).  Food, the meat of my review (har, ha... Nevermind): I got the Kiki Burger, taking the recommendation of one of the wait staff, because mushrooms kick ass. Holy double-hockeysticks, this is one delicious burger. I ordered medium-rare (the cognoscenti's level of doneness...) and it is fantastic. The bun's toasted like Texas Toast, the spring greens are crisp, the burger is juicy. I've long-since forgotten the type of sauce that it comes with (which I quickly taste-tested with a tempura-fried onion ring) but it's all over my buns and has a nice complimentary sweet-spice to it. The mushrooms are delicious and, as a previous reviewer has said so eloquently, \"d@mmit, Bachi Burger has ruined all the rest of the burgers I'll eat in the future because they're so d@mn good\". Or something like that. Either way, I'm in heaven - great big, beautiful beer, unbelievable burger and light, crispy onion rings in a happy environment.",

    "text": "I'm so happy that Bachi Burger opened this new location!  They make one of my favorite burgers: The Lonely Bird.  I know most people don't order this one, but it's a sleeper favorite :)  It's ground chicken/turkey prepared tsukune style with strong flavors of soy sauce and ginger, with an herb pesto, lettuce, tomato, and beer battered onion rings.  So incredibly flavorful and delicious!  My husband ordered the Miyagi-san grass fed wagyu burger and declared that he liked mine better!  I liked his too though...the beef was perfectly cooked and the combination of drippy fried egg, caramelized bacon, chili mayo, and onion rings was pretty amazing.  I wasn't a big fan of the Ronin burger.  The regular salt and pepper fries were thin and crispy, just the way I like it, although they could have used a bit more salt.  I will be back for my Lonely Bird burger...perhaps I will branch out one of these days and try the Banh-mi burger :)",

    "text": "So we decided to give bachi burgers one more try and we were still disappointed. When we arrived , the restaurant was not busy. A couple tables were already eating and one table was having their order taken. We waited at least five minutes before a waiter decided to take our drink orders.  We ordered appetizer fries with the drink order.  We saw our fries sitting on the hot line for awhile before they were brought to us.  And our burgers arrived right after.  So much for an appetizer.  Sadly the service was worse this time and it really doesn't matter how you order your burger temp ...med , med well and well done are all cooked med rare.  The service is slow and inattentive.  If I am paying 15$ for a burger I expect better than 2$ burger service.  I am always shocked when waiters and waitresses expect big tips when you have to practically beg for an order to be taken, drink refills are ignored and the waiter doesn't bother to see how the food is before the bill is left!  It's a shame they aren't reading their reviews, if they were they would know they haven't done a good job training their waiters-- lots of reviews comment on the bad service.",

The burgers are simply fantastic, and are in the conversation for best burgers in all of the valley. Highlighted by the KiKi burger and Parmeasan truffle fries. In addition try the Jasmine Strawberry Lemonade!! It really doesn't taste like lemonade, more like tea. But very unique and refreshing!",

The Truffle Parmesan Fries with the Sun Dried Tomato dipping sauce was so good. I can't wait to try their other fries that sounded great too.  Had the burger and the meat is so good. The tastes that all come together really create an amazing burger.  Must try!  Heard they are going be on Diners, Drive Ins, and Dives on Food Network and I can see why!",

    "text": "did to go order this evening and they repeated the entire order back to me over the phone which was nice. something odd was they took cc # but i suppose they might have a lot of ppl order togo and not pick it up. windmill location doesnt do that which is quite funny. different clientele perhaps. order was ready when they said it was since i arrived 25 mins after phone call and they quoted 30 mins. food was amazing as always got the kalbi burger and ronin both amazing. dont like kim chee so i substituted japanese coleslaw for it and it turned out good. caesar salad had amazing flavors and i love avocados so nice touch with that in the salad. only downfall was i ordered the parmesean truffle fries and they made salt and pepper fries with ginger on them. i called the restaurant to notify them that someone elses order might be mixed up and they apologized and could tell it was sincere the gentleman asked if they could do anything to make it up. but not a big deal in my eyes. fries were still good just took ginger off. no truffle or parmesan so looking forward to them next time. always a good choice when looking for a burger. side note they label everything when you do a to go order such as caesar dressing, for fries, for ronin, etc. great touch. deserved a little extra tip, being as i did to go orders back in the day i always tip on to go orders. even a $1 or $2 for a cheap meal makes the service staff smile. at least it made me smile.",

We try to find the hostess to ask whats up and she says the kitchen cant handle the orders and have asked that noone be seated at this time and that it would be @another 20-30 mins, and that even the people that are seated have been waiting over an hour for their food-unreal.  The place is very small, holds @40 people, and the tables were only @ 60%full and they could not handle that capacity??????   I could understand if they just opened, but they have been around for a while.   What sh!tty management.   Food might be great (would know cuz i didnt want to wait who know how long) but they need to find a person who knows how to manage the kitchen!",

    "text": "Just ate a Bacchi Burger and would never go back.  I am not a huge burger fan so I ordered the crab which was so fishy with more filler than crab.  My friend ordered the Kiki burger which was delicious.  I asked to order something else and by the time I received it, was not that hungry so got it to go.  When we were presented with the check our bill for 2 burgers/ fries was 56.00!!!  I noticed they didn't take the crab off and when questioned was told that the chef tasted it and thought it was fine and that was their policy not to credit any food item just because you didn't like it.  I told the manager she should have told me before she reordered another item for me and if I have to pay for it I wanted to take it home, of course it was thrown out.  She then proceeded to lecture me about their food policy.  It seems to me when you are charging extra for an additional tablespoon of sauce and burgers and fries are 50.00 for 2 people you should get what you want without being lectured from the manager!!!  The burgers were ok but not worth the hassle and price.  Islands Burgers just as good, less expensive, and better customer service.  If the manager would  have stopped at crediting the crab cake; I would not be writing this.... Is a 13.00 burger worth this??",

Add that with a side of Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries and appetizer of Pork Belly Buns and you have a meal so rich in flavor that the trek off the strip is 100% worth it.  I've been to Bachi twice (first time was at the other location) and have been thoroughly satisfied with both my experiences. I don't remember the service at the other location but this location had superb service. Very attentive with ordering, clearing dishes and refilling water. What more can you ask for?  Definately for me a must go every time I'm in Vegas. Honestly, I'm not sure how far off the strip both the locations are because we had a rental car and have local friends, but if you have a chance, go HERE!",

It's about 8:30pm and I finally convince him to go. First if all, the 2 start reading is because if the large portion.... that's all. We walk up to the front where someone is waiting to stay you. We tell him we just want to order the oxtail fries. He directs us to the back where the cashier is. We wait around for a few minutes then finally another guy and the original guy we spoke to up front to ring us up for oxtail fries. He does, we thought, then we go sit and wait very excitedly to finally taste what we've seen in pictures. A lady hands us our order and we leave. It wasn't until we got home that we realized that what we actually got was chili cheese fries, not oxtail. My 6'4\" 320 lb husband who loves food took about 4 bites and refused to eat the rest. $11 worth of fries down the drain! On top of that, he kept saying the taste was nasty and tasted burnt to him. He refuses to give then another try. Oh well, I tried.",

Naturally, I had to give them a tour from the local's POV, starting off with getting them fed properly.  I can't speak on behalf of my friends, but the fact that they were finished every bite speaks for itself. Or... they could've just been hungry, but they seemed quite satisfied so I'll leave it at that.  Had the kalbi burger and I gotta say that it hit my burger craving right on the head. Though it only made a small dent in my Korean food craving, the burger itself was cooked medium and was moist and tender as it should be. The kimchi wasn't too overpowering and blended well with the gochujang mayo.  Between the five of us, we split an order of truffle parmesan fries and sweet potato fries. Personally, I like the sweet potato fries more, but I'm working on discerning the truffle flavor. The aiolis are matched well with their respective fries.  Service was great and pricing is typical for an upscale burger restaurant like this.",

    "text": "My little brother and I went here randomly the other day for lunch, I had been meaning to do so for a few months now. We walked in to a quaint restaurant with an adorable vibe. We were seated and instantly greeted with water and started off our meal with \"Bachi pickles\" which, at the time, I wasn't sure what they were. I also had a nuclear green, green tea and my brother had strawberry lemonade. The \"Bachi pickles\" was an assortment of pickled things, like garlic, beet, and peppers. So delicious!    For my entree I ordered the special spare rib sandwich, it was delicious! It was super tender considering spare ribs can be tough and weren't as fatty as I had expected, which is fine by me! My brother enjoyed a Ronin burger which was massive, he only ate half, that never happens! We shared a side of sweet potato fries, fried to perfection and sprinkled with salt. They were served with a sauce I can't remember the name of but it was super lemony, if you will, that I devoured.    Ericka was our server and she was super attentive and sweet. She never left our water glasses unattended and always made sure we were perfectly content. We will be back!",

The burgers are fantastic and range from mild to spicy. The beef is juicy and never over cooked. Their sweet potato fries are heavenly and so are the truffle fries. Thankfully, there is a jogging trail close to my home cause running that trail is a must after eating here, but it's soooo worth it. =)",

All of us ordered different burgers.  However, the burgers did not include any sides.  The only good thing about the burger were the buns.  Very soft and moist.  The oxtail fries were not what we expected.  There were only 3 thinly sliced jalapenos.  The oxtail stew looked like regular chili.  You can hardly taste the oxtail.  It was a bit salty.  We were expecting more out of this place.  We've tasted better burgers.  Even home style burgers tasted better.  I would have rather had In-N-Out.  At least they have combos which include fries and a drink.  The only reason people come to this place is because of the name.  Would not recommend anyone to Bachi.",

We had the sauteed edamame, very good, but the fire from the chilis was starting to get overwhelming when the food arrived - great timing.  I had the special, a Loch Duarte Salmon sandwich and Just Fries.  First, the fries.. sheer perfection, and the pineapple ketchup was surprisingly delicious and perfect for such a hot day.  The salmon sandwich was nicely balanced, with the bacon being beautifully caramelized and giving a nice smoky crunch that kept the salmon from being overpowering.  I was expecting good, I got great instead.    I was stuffed when I left, and I had half a sandwich and over half the fries left.. made me want to cry to leave it behind, but couldn't squeeze in another bite and didn't want to deal with leftovers.  Hubby ordered the Ronin Burger and the Salt & Pepper Garlic fries.  First his fries.. he couldn't leave them alone.  As for the burger, he had ordered it medium and it arrived well done, but that didn't stop him from eating every single bite and practically moaning with ecstasy with each bite.  He didn't even care that there was no ketchup or mustard on his burger, he just knew he was in heaven.  We'll definitely be back.. and soon :D",

    "text": "Finally got to try this place! Went last night around 7:30 with a party of 8 for a family dinner. The wait wasn't too bad but it did take about 30 minutes to seat us even with seeing quite a few cleared tables.  First things first, the table they sat us at was broken. One of the feet were missing or broken basically making the table a seesaw. Luckily they had some Vegas Weekly magazines up front I was able to slide under the leg to get it even, though my wife gave me a hard time about that! :P  Ok, on to the food (well appetizers first). Since we had a decent sized party we tried a couple different things. The stir fried edamame were great and cooked just right. And since everyone raves about the pork belly, that was definitely a must try. Those things are spectacular, the pork is super tender and the steamed buns are amazing. I wasn't a huge fan of the sauce, it's a little too sweet for me but still great flavor. We also got a couple different types of fries that I didn't care for much. The salt and pepper fries along with the truffle fries were just ok. Definitely not staple items off their menu. I will say though that the dipping sauces they give with them are awesome. Another thing I want to mention, even though aren't really an appetizer are the milkshakes...you can't leave without trying one. We tried the mocha nut fudge and salted caramel, just altogether awesome milkshakes!  As far as the \"main\" items go, there were a few things I did and didn't like. I've never tried wagyu beef so I substituted it into my Kiki burger and it is delicious! Not everyone at my table agreed with me but there's definitely a flavor difference and it's unbelievably juicy. They also use some great toppings and everything just tasted really fresh. I also can't say enough about their buns, super soft and really tasty. One of the main gripes I had about this place was their burger cooking temperatures. I love some pink in my burger but my wife doesn't and I'm used to seeing \"medium\" with some pink in it...not at Bachi. Their medium is extremely pink and in my opinion, was a lot closer to a medium rare. If you aren't a fan of pink in your burger, make sure you order your burger medium well at least.   Even though pretty much everything was good, they are a little pricey.  For 7 adults and 1 kid, our bill was $210 and some change, before tip. They have decent service but it slowed down quite a bit by time we sat down at 8 and the food took a while to come out. I have a feeling that now knowing a bit more about Bachi, I could probably easily bump this up to 4 stars next time I eat there since I'll definitely be coming back.",

    "text": "Ever since I saw this place featured on Guy Fieri's hit show \"Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives,\" I had to try their Oxtail Fries. Oxtail Fries looks better than it taste which was a little disappointing, but I will come back again for their Truffle Fries and Salted Caramel Shake.   SERVICE Friendly and prompt. Service was on point.  FOOD Everything was ordered by my self-proclaimed food critic friend. Here's what we got:  Shogun Burger: Consist of wagyu beef, unagi, foie gras, poached asian pear, miso butter and yamamomo peach. $26 for a burger might scare some away but I personally liked this a lot. Asked the beef to be cooked medium rare and it was perfect as it could be, so tender and juicy. My main gripe about this burger was the unagi being too fishy. I would have enjoyed this more without unagi.  Truffle Parmesan Fries: Wow, flavor on fleek. Black truffle porcini cream drizzed on the fries had me asking, \"Can fries be this tasty?\" Apparently, it is possible.  Must get this if you are coming to Bachi Burger.   Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries: As seen on TV. It can get spicy because of chili and jalapeno. I personally enjoyed Truffle Parmesan Fries more.  Salted Caramel Shake: Screw Starbucks and their caramel frap. Salted caramel shake with marshmallow here was next level. Perfectly sweetened with caramel and icy texture was super refreshing for me.   CONCLUSION Unique and tasty burgers/fries and good service. Can be on the pricier side because of high quality ingredients but worth it in my opinion.",

We got sat down rather quickly even during peak hours.  They seem to have a larger space compared to their other locations, and the majority of the crowds seem to be the local residents.  We started with the usual Ox Tail Fries.  The portion did seem a bit skimpy when compared to their other locations, usually it takes about two to three people to finish one, and the ox tail was a bit chewy in comparison as well.    We got the Kalbi Burger and some Peking Duck Sliders for entrees.  The kalbi patty in the burger felt a bit lacking on seasoning, but the flavor was ok overall.  The duck meat on the sliders were a bit dried, it really could use more sauces.  There were three of us, but the waitress was a bit rude to one of our companion (maybe he was the only white person?), and he did not end up ordering anything in the end.  It was probably a onetime thing, I guess the bad service had made this visit rather unpleasant, usually I love Bachi Burger.",

They are stacked high so biting into them will be a bit of challenge but when you're starving the challenge is easily accepted.

The flavors are amazing. I didn't think I was going to like it, so I ordered a kalbi burger, while my friend ordered the kiki. And I am so glad she got this so that I can walk away in peace, knowing where to come back when I want to stuff my face with the amazingness of burger heaven.   I personally am a huge fan of a burger tasting closer to a classic burger, but to the next level due to something special. If that's you, then the kiki burger will satisfy your needs. The kalbi burger, on the other hand, would be enjoyable for one that really likes fusion flavors. I love korean food, and korean flavors, but for some reason, I've noticed that I don't like it when it's combined with other food types (like burgers, tacos, burritos, sushi, etc.)   Fried Calamari- 4/5 Pretty dang good. The breading is on the lighter side, which I love, but I've had better. I can't complain that it comes with different type of veggies, and the sauce was amaaaaaaazing.   Service was ON POINT, but they can get a busy so you'll have to waive down a waiter for your water/drinks to be refilled. I'll have to come back and check out the HH some time.",

    "text": "Growing up in Hawaii, I always thought of \"bachi\" being what goes around comes around and usually with a negative connotation. However in this case, Bachi burger is serving up some pretty awesome burgers and sides and putting a new spin.  Asian take on an American classic is definitely not anything new, but doing it well is definitely the tricky part. Bachi Burger is definitely putting its mark on it and in a good way. The Miyagi-san burger uses a beautifully cooked wagyu patty with caramelized bacon, chili-mayo, onion rings, and a bit of furikake (dried seaweed) for salt.   The oxtail fries was a good starting point with well cooked fries that were crisp on the exterior and steamy soft in the center. It was more chili style topping, but the the chili flavors were a tad overwhelming and didn't showcase the flavors of the oxtail, rather muted it.  Pork belly bao was well prepared with soft, but still firm pork topped with scallions, and a nice hoisin bbq sauce that gave the right balance of caramelized sugar and salt. The sliced boiled egg was decent and gave it nice color, but didn't really do anything to add for me.  Service was stellar and our server clearly knew the menu well and was ready to offer not only explanation, but reasoning behind suggestions. Food arrived in a good orchestration that kept our mouths busy and our tummy ready to digest. Ambiance is casual and nice, while its location seems to offer a plethora of parking and convenience to the neighborhood theatre next door.  All in all, if you are jones-ing for a new take on a burger, check out Bachi!",

For appetizer,we had the fried calamari for $10. It came with this creamy tar tar sauce type and some lime sauce. It was ok. It wasn't crispy. It was more like they tried to fry it but not long enough because it was kind of soggy.   For entrees, I chose to do the \"famous\" oxtail chili cheese fries for $11. First sight- presentation is beautiful. The fried egg was perfectly cooked to where you break it and the yolk just oozes. The taste-SALTY. The fries were crispy but that meat sauce was so salty and spicy because of the jalapenos. Was not impressed at all.   My Bf got the Miyagi San burger with the Wagyu patty. First of all, you don't get a side with it so don't forget to order fries if you want a side. The burger patty itself was good but for $15 he wasn't even full.   In the end our bill came up to $45. It's kind of disappointing because we had high expectations for the place. We ended up throwing away the leftover cheese fries because we couldn't even eat it anymore. We were better off getting In and Out or Shake Shack to be honest and we would've been alot happier.",

The restaurant is spacey with plenty of space, and the waiters were helpful and quick with service.  For the food, I ordered the Miyagi-San grass fed wagyu burger, with a side of salt & pepper garlic fries. The fries were well seasoned and crispy as well as decent size (was able to feed to two people). The burger was amazing, cooked to my liking, and juicy. It came with an egg on it which I absolutely love. Overall the flavors of the burger  mixed well together and was delightful. Definitely recommend if you have a craving for a burger.",

Oxtail Fries make for a delicious start to the meal and the Bone Marrow Jam adds a subtle savoriness to the flavor explosion.  The Pork Belly Steamed Buns are another delicious choice either as a side or as a meal.  If given the option, be sure to upgrade to the Waygu Beef on your burger, you will be glad you did!

(should've gotten the garlic fries! darnit!) it came with a side of spicy sriracha-mayo sauce, i believe. the sauce was delicious!  overall, i think i'd have to come back again to give it a decent review.  there is A LOT of parking, so don't be afraid. service is 5/5 as well.",

They were delish, we scarfed that down within minutes.  We then moved onto the Pork Belly Buns, one order comes with 3.  These were good, but weren't to die for.  Then on to the main course...Kiki burger and Miyagi-san burger, they were both so yummy!!! I'm just sad that I couldn't finish my portion of the Miyagi-san.   Why the 4 stars you may ask...They seemed a little under staffed that day.  The staff was really friendly and attentive, but everything was a little slow. I'm sure the service would be amazing, if they had maybe another person on the floor. I'll be back to sink my teeth into another burger!",

My go to burger is the Miyagi San which is a grass fed \"Wagyu\" burger with Chili Mayo, Fried Egg, Furikake ,Caramelized Bacon, and Crispy Onion Rings. DELISH! Always cooked just right with just the right amount of everything. Get that burger alongside some regular or sweet potati fries and a shake... BAM! in food heaven.  Definitely worth the hype",

It wasn't busy at all, if it had been busy I would've been more understanding. We finally sit out butts down and order our food.. our food took almost an hour to be served and everything that arrived was salty except the fries which lacked any form of seasoning.. our drinks were never refilled.

    "text": "Food: 5/5 - we loved it. I ordered the meatless burger and I think it may have been the best one that I ever had. It was made from red beans and it was nutty which was great for taste and consistency. The bun was wonderful. Similar to the bread use for baked BBQ pork buns at dim sum/Chinese places. My brother got the Bachi fish sandwich which I believe was cod. He really like it, the fish was fresh and a generous size. We shared sweet potato fries and my brother also got the mocha shake which he said was delicious.   Service: 3/5 - It wasn't bad just slow. There was one waitress (it was memorial day late lunch time) with a support guy, who I think was new, and served as drink/food runner. There was a manager-like guy and another woman-maybe owner (?) but, they were not really helping out when clearly the waitress was busy (maybe 7+ tables). I asked for lemons for my water and had to wait and ask several times. Finally, about 20 mins in, our waitress brought lime slices saying they didn't have lemon which I really found odd. I'm not sure I have been to a sit down restaurant where they didn't have lemons.  Space: 4/5 - nice, new, darker lighting. I've never liked the parking at this set of stores/strip mall. It is near the movie theatre so, parking spaces can be a far and once you are in a row, you can't just turn and go down another row. You have to drive a ways down.",

    "text": "We were a party of 10 on Tuesday night originally going to the Windmill location, but with a broken AC, went to the one on Sahara instead.  There was no wait, and the restaurant was about 1/3 full.  The service was great - waters were never empty and plates were cleared accordingly.  Our server made sure everyone's burger was cooked at the right temp (asked us to cut it open to see).  Also, with such a large party, I was impressed that the food runners knew exactly which burger was whose (I think it's so tacky to bring food to the table and \"auction\" it off).   On to the food.  We shared the oxtail fries, sweet potato fries, and truffle parm fries.  A member of our party commented that the oxtail fries tasted \"like fries with canned chili on top\".  I thought they were over salted and were nothing special.  The sweet potato fries were good (but Boiling Crab still has the best in town) - thick cut, seasoned perfectly.  The yuzu aioli, however, didn't quite compliment the savory-sweetness of the fries.  The truffle parm fries were a huge letdown.  I love truffle and was expecting to taste a little truffle flavor in each bite.  I got zero truffle flavor.  The mushroom cream drizzled on top was reminiscent of stove top mushroom gravy made in the microwave.  The tomato aioli, while good on its own, added nothing to the fries.  If the fries were truffle and cheesey enough, I don't think it would need any kind of sauce to accompany it.   I got the Kalbi burger and my bf got the Kiki burger.  The meat was of great quality and cooked perfectly.  The bun was nicely toasted and buttered.  I really wish I loved the burgers (everyone else in the party did), but I really did not think they were anything special.  The Kalbi burger tasted like a burger slathered with kalbi sauce with some kim chee on top.  The Kiki burger tasted like a lot of bland.  All the ingredients sounded like it should have come together to make a great flavor combo, but it just didn't work.  I didn't even know there was caramelized onion, bacon, and guyere chesse on it until I looked back on the menu!  I thought it was just meat, lettuce, and some mushrooms.   The price isn't considered cheap either.  $5 for frozen fries drizzled with stove top mushroom gravy does not a happy girl make.   All in all, kudos for trying to come up with a fusion burger place, but at the end of the day, the flavors (or lack thereof) just didn't work.",

    "text": "On Nov. 29, 2013, Fri, we were extremely excited to dine at Bachi Burger since it would be our first time.  And to say that we were satisfied with our meal is to say the least.  We were not disappointed with the food, the burgers were really good and the steamed buns with pork belly was awesome.  However, the appetizers were ok...nothing exciting.  I would actually give the food a 4.5 stars.  Now on to the service...this is the reason for the 1 star.  I am TRUELY upset with the service of the Summerlin location.  The wait time to be seated was decent.  After we were seated and finally ordered our food, we waited 45 mins to just be served our appetizers.  The restaurant wasn't even crowded, there was still a station that was closed and they were not seating anyone there.  We were so hungry by the time we got our food, we excitedly ate it and enjoyed it very much.  So we didn't even notice that we did not get our calamari.  Being satisfied and full, we paid our $159.99 bill, along with the automatic 18% gratuity of $26.64, totalling $186.63 and left. When we got home, I had looked at the receipt and realized that we never received our $12 calamari appetizer.  With that, I called Bachi Burger right away to let them know what had happened and the hostess that answered the call said that they were TOO BUSY to have me talk to the restaurant manager and that she would have him call me back later on that night when they slowed down.  So of course I waited and did not receive a call back.  I then called on Saturday when they opened and was able to speak to the restaurant manager, PHYROM.  I told him what had happened and explained that I had called the night before and let him know that we not receive our calamari appetizer.  He then started to interrogate me as to why I did not bring it up when we were there.  I explained that we were excited about being there, extremely hungry due to our 45 min wait, and then being satisfied at the end.  In not so many words, he basically accused me of lying about it.  REALLY?!!!! I would seriously call that night and then the next day to lie about not getting our appetizer.  If the appetizer was say $5 I could care less about calling back but this was the most expensive item on our bill.  All PHYROM kept saying was \"you have to understand my point, why did you not tell us at the time of your meal that you did not receive your appetizer?\"  I basically told him that all I want is to get the $12 refund and that's it.  I guess PHYROM got tired of my complaining so he said that he would research it and give me a call back on Monday, Dec. 2nd.    So today is Dec 7th and I still haven't gotten a call back from PHYROM.  So I guess his answer to me is \"you're one family and your satisfaction doesn't matter us\".  So my answer back is a BIG MIDDLE FINGER TO YOU AND YOUR RESTAURANT CAUSE I WILL NEVER GO BACK AGAIN!!!!!!  CAUSE ONE BAD REVIEW DOESN'T COUNT when all the others are over 4 stars.",

The Kiki burger was delectable and simply drowns your palate in rich burger juices with a touch of their unique sauce.

If you're not up for the chili fries and like slightly spicy I recommend there salt and pepper fries which comes with fresh sliced jalapenos tossed in.

So far i've in one way or another have tried the: Spicy Miso Mr Miyagi  Ronin  Kalbi   Each and every burger has it's own unique savoriness and bite. It's hard to pick a sure winner since they're all amazing.   The oxtail chili fries...also amazing.  Look i'm not gonna go into a lot of detail seeing as so many have already beaten me to it. If you havent been here yet GO. if you need someone to go with make a UYE and they will come.",

Recently, my friends and I went and I ordered the Kiki's Burger and the Parm/Truffle fries.  Very yum...I'm salivating right now.   My friends ordered the Ronin Burger and No Meat Burger, along with the roasted peppers; they loved their meals and it all came out perfect.  We didn't leave a crumb and felt fat and happy.  One of my friends is a regular, like me, and the other friend has become a new fan.  Although we didn't order them this time, I love their boba drinks and will sometimes will order just the drink when I'm on the go.  The brothers Watada did an amazing and creative job.  Their staff has always been polite, friendly and the food has been served in reasonable time.  It's a must-try in Vegas if you haven't!",

Ordered 3 burgers.  1 was right, 2 wrong. 1 was burnt, *raw* grilled onions, asked for fully cooked egg got runny, ate about 1/2 and had to stop. 2nd wrong one, asked for mayo didnt get it. Had to go to the kitchen and flag someone down as no one would stop when i was calling to them or waving just to get it. The salt and pepper garlic fries where horrible, taste too much like rosemary and no garlic in the whole basket. If we were not in a rush we would of walked out and went elsewhere. This is a chain and my 1st experance is -1 but i can only give 1 star as the lowest. As a foodie who just started yelping this place is horrible and the rest of the locations suffer because I wont go in one ever.",

I typically try and hit up different spots on each trip out here to Vegas, but I may have to make an exception and make Bachi Burger a staple.   The restaurant is very clean and inviting, and the service was excellent from when we arrived, all the way through.   Haha, it's always funny when we see transplanted locals who recognize locals (From Hawaii) whether it me our \"look\", the way we talk, or in this case my clothes.   Anyways, on to the food.   We were a still a little full from breakfast, but I had to try a few different things.   Pork Belly Bao Buns.....excellent.   The pork belly was still very juicy, and super flavorful, yet with just the right amount of fat.  Oxtail Chili Cheese fries.....OMG .   At first sight it came out and was a mountain of fried, chili and cheese goodness!   I thought it was just a little chili, and a ton of fries.....nope.   It almost seemed like the chili was layered in there and was actually just the right amount. For our burger, we split a Kiki Burger which also didn't disappoint.   The mushrooms were sauteed nicely and not overdone, and the chesse and bacon were very nice compliments.   Oh yah, and the plantation iced tea was some of the best I've ever had!

A bit too much sauce...couldn't really get too much of the burger flavor. I washed it down with the matcha green tea milk shake. Yum! Maybe I'm spoiled with the burger joints in LA.

The menu is amazing and I must say they have created some ideas for burgers that my brain could have never fathomed.  I got a burger with shrimp and pork in the beef and curry aioli and a fried egg on top.  Great apps and fries too!  Service was flawless and the price isn't bad.  The only reason I didn't give it five stars was because I was hoping the burger itself would've been a little bigger (but I'm a country boy) and the atmosphere is a little bland.  But I'll be back no question.",

They'll tell you to order one of their burgers and to substitute ingredients instead. A major flaw in service and a pain in the butt.  They are slow to seat you as well. Even in an almost empty restaurant.  I'm still rating them 4 stars because that's how good the food is here.  Just pretend your in New York and you won't notice the bad service so much.",

The kim chee on my burger was just right, not over powering. We went on a Monday evening. There were 8 tables occupied & 3 servers. I had a beer & we both drank water. The water was filled once & the napkins we asked for when the food came never arrived. That was the extent of our servers attention. Beer & water were dropped off as she took our food order, she dropped off the burgers. That was it. The manager brought the appetizer & we had to ask him for the check after we finished eating, after waiting 20 minutes. Don't recall who filled the water, but wasn't our server. I do recommend this place as the food was great. I will give them another try.",

    "text": "Ok so to start the food is actually really good and consistent. The reason i rated them lower is because of the customer service. I have been several times and usually have good service, however there is one waitress that needs to have customer service lessons. Im not sure her what her cultural background is but she is Asian, prob thirties or late twenties. The last time i went there was with a group of seven. On this occasion, there was plenty of seating but there was a sign to wait, so we did. There were two waitresses one was white and one was Asian, both saw us and continued working, one was even clean a table. The  after about 5 minutes the Asian lady came over to us and sat us at a table. The first thing she said to us is \"How are you planning to pay?\" i thought that was really strange and kinda rude. Im used to waitress telling u about the menu before discussing money, we looked at each other with a puzzled look and answered her and that some of us were paying cash and some were paying credit cards. Right away she responded, \"i can't do that. I can only take up to 4 payments.\" we tried to figure who had cash and if we needed to sit at separate tables in order to have lunch (literally talked about payment stuff for ten minutes before we were allowed to look at the menu) . After we go that worked out, she gave us a minute to look at the menu and came back and stood at the head of the table and requested our orders, requiring us to yell across the table to place our order over the noise. Isn't it a common technique of waiters to walk around the table and the order, unless your at a booth and there is sonly on place to stand? I felt it was rude. To make it easier, i placed my order over the phone as a to go order, that way she didn't have to worry  about splitting the bill and the number of payments she could take. To this day each of us talk about this experience and how we are not planning to go back. I really do like the food and want to go back but I'm tone on supporting that type of customer service. If I go back my order will be to go 100%. No need in staying there, i rather eat at the picnic table by the movie theater than be in there with that customer service and feel obligated to tip someone who isn't doing their job from a customer prospective. Overall I think they could improve their customer service, especially for seating. I typically wait about 5 minutes and every time i have gone it has always been between 2% and 25% full.",

    "text": "I went here on Sunday night around 8:30PM with 3 others and the wait was about 20-25 min.  I was staying at Mandalay Bay and from there it was about a 10 min taxi ride which was about 10 miles but there was very little traffic and its way off the strip in a tiny strip mall.  We saw this place on Food Networks- Diners Driveins and Dives and had to try- btw all the TVs in the joint were tuned to Food Network- wonder why?  :)  The wait was well worth it. When we were sat down we ordered a drink, I just got an iced green tea which was perfect and refreshing. Bummed they had very little selction of sweeteners but whatever.  They had a TON of drink items to choose from such as thai tea, passionfruit, boba etc.  Love the Asian drinks! We started with appetizers of:  Pork Belly Steamed Buns- yummy but only came with 3 small buns and a hoisin based dip sauce, the pork belly melted in your mouth, but for our party of 4- not a lot to go around Salt and Pepper Garlic Fries- delicious. your basic skinny fry with a pop. had jalapenos so they were spicy as well as a mayonaise dip sauce. I woudl have preferred the Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries- saw other ppl order they looked good! Chili Fried Chicken- My favorite- well seasoned crispy and a mayonaise based spicy dipping sauce- perfect accompaniment  I also got the Spicy Miso Burger.  I love miso but I barely tasted it in this burger. This burger was the reason I deducted a star. (If I could give 3.5 stars I would have but I rounded up) It was well-cooked and beautiful looking but nothing special. The egg was cooked over hard and I barely tasted garlic or the Shisito peppers (which I am nuts for).   My friend got a Banh Mi burger that was waaaay more flavorful.  Overall a very positive experience. I am from LA where trendy burger places are rampant- so it takes a lot to impress me- this was good and the asian fusion was a nice twist from the regular ole- 5 guys, The Counter and Umami.",

I had no idea what to expect when we walked in, but I was pretty happy to see the menu had a large selection and even a kid's menu. It was obvious to me as a Hawaii resident that the owner/chef must have been from Hawaii as well based on their menu. I had the customized Wagyu burger and it was delicious! The buns are buttery and a little sweet; I would buy their bread separately if I could. We also had the garlic fries which were okay. It tasted more like parsley than garlic, but my husband loved the garlic aioli sauce it came with. He had the pork bao buns which were cooked to perfect. The buns were steamed perfect and the pork belly just melted in your mouth. I also had the haupia coconut panna cotta which was also perfection. Service was fantastic and the restaurant is definitely kid-friendly, a major plus for our two-year-old son.",

My burger tasted good, but for 10 bucks you think you would of had more beef in it. I was still hungry when I left. None of the flavors really made me any kind of impression on me. Instead of ketchup they gave me what looked like tomato paste for the dipping sauce of the fries. It wasn't good.           I'm a huge burger fan and I felt like this place just takes gourmet burgers a little too far. Is a burger even really Gourmet in the first place?

We came during lunch time so the crowd wasn't too crazy. The last time I came it was in the evening and this place was packed and now I see why.  I ordered the oxtail fries and Miyagi san's burger. The burger was coined to perfection and I asked the waiter to cook my egg over hard with NO runny yoke and that he did. The burger was flawless.   The oxtail fries were soooooooo good!! I accidentally ate a pepper and burned my tongue but it was worth it.   Bachi burger ruined every other burger joint for my bf. He loves burgers and could eat it everyday and now he compares other burgers to bachi burger.   I will be back to this place and with more of my family and friends!!!  Mahalo to the bachi burger staff for being on your A game and giving us incredible service and amazing tasting food. I'll see you in September..",

That's why it's perfect for trying if you are coming to Vegas only once in a while.  Their fries are amazing also! Don't forget to try those. Service is good and attentive and the food is great.

We decided to try something new rather than the same old restaurants on the Las Vegas strip the first night we got in. We've been always been going to the same places every time we come so we decided to change it up. Since I've heard such good things about Bachi, we decided to make the trek out the strip to some random plaza I would say 5-10 off the strip.  Upon walking in, Bachi is a fusion between Asian and modern cuisine. I decided to try their oxtail chili cheese fries and shogun burger and the bf ordered the black and green burger. The oxtail chili cheese fries were the highlight of the night!!! The oxtail was tender and flavorful and the mixture of chili was a little sweet and egg to top it off was the perfect amount of salty you needed! Ugh I just want to go back for those chili cheese fries!! My shogun burger was amazing!! Huge piece of foie gras within the burger perfectly seared and nice and fatty!! So good!   I definitely would love to come back and try their other burgers! Their bun is so soft and they pair the best ingredients inside of it!! Such unique and great flavors!!",

For my actual burger, I ordered the \"Kiki's Burger\".  Same as everything else- it was perfect.  We were so stuffed at this point, but decided to give dessert a shot.  The Portuguese donuts were not my favorite (a bit too sweet), but the trio of ice cream sandwiches was incredible.  I loved the sesame seed one.   In the end, I was very happy with the atmosphere, customer service and food.  I cannot wait to go back soon and try out the pork belly steamed buns and more!",

Only thing I liked there were the plain fries and Plantain iced tea.    15min in after ordering and the people who came after us got their entrees before we got our appetizers. The dishes they gave us were still stained, I had to ask for replacement. Even then, we still wiped the plates with napkins, just to be sure. The people who left after we arrived, their dirty dishes stayed there till right before we got our entrees. And there were only 3 tables filled, even then they weren't attentive. I don't get the hype, especially for the price.    If my experience in a place is bad, no food can ever make up for it. No thank you.",

Mr. Ho's was served on a taro bun, as in the root! very good bun, with lup cheong sausage, which is a Chinese dried cured sausage,  great on stir fry noodles btw. I have to say the black n green burger edged out mr. Ho's. american wagyu grass fed beef, with point reyes blue cheese, and bacon, salty, stinky, and juicy. What more can you ask for? the truffle parmesean fries was just as good as i remember them, when i went to the Windmill location. Great experience all around",

Their burgers are asian-esque and honestly, if you throw a fried egg in any burger, sandwich, pita pocket, what have you... odds are, I'm going to love it.   The burgers are delicious. The shoe string fries are delicious. The lychee green tea (i think?) is refreshing. But the oxtail chili cheese fries are where its AT! They give you a a very generous amount and it can easily feed 3-4 people or just a really hungry (and selfish) ME. (but I guess I'll share)  Funny, because after I ordered the Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries, I saw them on an episode of Triple D. I got to watch how they make the cheese fries and was surprised that they add semi sweet (or was it dark) chocolate chips! So deliciously weird and you'd never know but I bet it makes one hell of a difference!  The service is quaint. Polite. Quiet. Accommodating. Nothing mind blowing, but when you put an order of Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries in front of us, nothing can really ruin the mood.",

We waited almost 20 minutes after being sat down at our table for anyone to tend to us. It wasn't that busy and they asked other customers if they were ready for a check or for desserts. The only thing we got to taste was water, and look at the menu. No one tended to us, when they finally did, the waitress, with an attitude, said, \"You ready?\" And when we said we were going to leave she just said, \"oh.\" We weren't even rude about it, but she was. Customer service should ALWAYS be your priority. Hopefully, the other locations aren't as bad as this because I'll be letting everyone I know that this place has terrible customer service.",

    "text": "I came here for brunch with my boyfriend visiting from LA. We've had many different burger places and decided to give Bachi a try.   Service:  Gary served us and he was very attentive. He was the only one at the front of the house and greeted us as soon as we walked it. He gave us the freedom to choose our seats but that's because we were the first ones in restaurant. :) Once we got our food he came to check on us but wasn't overbearing.   Presentation:  The presentation was above par of most burger restaurants. The plates were clean, the garnishes were bright, and the food looked very appetizing and came out in a timely manner.   Food:  We ordered the pork belly steamed buns, bone marrow, the Bachi fish sandwich, wings, fries and a Thai tea.   Pork Belly buns - came with 3, the pork belly was tender and cut thick, comparable to thickness of your index finger. The hard boiled egg added a nice to it.   Bone marrow - came with 7 pieces of bread (a little less would've been okay). The marrow was slightly sweet because of the jam and not too oily.   Bachi fish sandwich - served with raw tomato and raw unions giving the sandwich a fresh taste. The tartar sauce was light. None of the ingredients overpowered the fish and it was a nicely balanced fish sandwich.   Crispy tebasaki wings - fairly large and crispy. It was garnished with pickled radish, which went perfect with the wings. The flavor tasted like a sweet soy.   Salt and pepper garlic  fries - the fries were crispy and seasoned perfectly. Unfortunately, it lacked the garlic flavor. The garlic chili aioli sauce paired great with the fries. This had a perfect amount of heat and acidity.   Thai tea - Their tea is average and less sweet than most. If you are a Thai tea lover, you know the sweetness level I'm talking about!   Overall, excellent dining experience. Compliments to the Chef and Management Team. We will definitely be back again!",

Not a huge deal, except for the fact that if you order the fries separately, you'll find they really aren't that good. Nice and crispy, but they lack in seasoning. I tried the truffle fries, and the sauce was good, but the fries were still flavorless.  The last time we were here, I ordered my drink and waited 20 minutes for the server to get it. He had completely forgotten about it, and the restaurant was empty. And no, he didn't magically remember, I had to flag him down to inform him of the obvious. No refills either.  Come here for a tasty burger, not for the service, or for the fries.. You want that, go elsewhere.",

    "text": "Sigh. So this definitely wasn't the best dinner experience I've had. Jacob and I decided to have dinner with friends from school. We are all hospitality majors and a few of us had heard of this place and wanted to check it out (specifically me).   We arrived a few minutes after Jake, and Sam with his wife and son RJ. It was a little stuffy, but we assumed that was because of the multitude of people in the restaurant. It was extremely easy to find parking close to the restaurant.   Our server quickly introduced herself, and was super friendly, but might have miscounted, as we didn't have the right number of menus for all of us. I had been dying to try the Bahn Mi burger for days, so that's what I ordered, only to find out that they were or of that specific \"patty\" so they weren't able to make the burger. She did state that it is a very popular burger, so I asked for recommendation... which were not what I was expecting. Like her recommending the burger they have with fish... she also stated they were out of red sangria, but managed to get me one last glass. So I will thank her for that.   I decided to order the same burger as my boyfriend and Sam, which contains a multitude of mushrooms, arugula, gruyere cheese and caramelized onions.   At this point. Let me summarize what happened. We ordered a plate of pickled items, and calamari. Sadly, Jacob and I weren't too impressed with the pickled items. But 1 year old RJ was, so they didn't go to waste. The calamari was a table favorite.   We were never offered refills of water or any of our other beverages, and had to wave down the bus girl who Jacob and Sam said reeked of weed and apparently likes to reallllly focus on filling only one glass per table visit. We also had empty appetizer plates for almost 20 minutes after finishing.   All of our food came at the same time. Except baby Rj's who's food came a few minutes after ours. I really wish they would have brought his food at first, because I hate when a kid gets his food after the adults.   The caramelized onions in the burger were superb and they cook the burgers perfectly, but the sweet buns and onions overpowered EVERYTHING else in the burger, and the Parmesan porcini truffle fries only tastes of Parmesan, lacking in salt and truffle.   I would have told our server all of this if she had checked up on us after taking our order, but we only saw her at the end of the meal when we asked for our check. The checks were also split incorrectly, but because of how hot it was inside and because we were all really thirsty, we decided to pay for it and leave.   This was not what I was expecting from this establishment. The food itself was 3 stars, but the service brought it down to 2. Sorry Bachi Burgers.",

Hostess said that it would be about a 20-35 minutes wait. Like I said, only 3 parties were seated. When asked the reason for the long wait, the hostess politely replied that it was because everyone arrived at the same time. ?? We tried. We tried to give Bachi Burger another try after many years of frequenting there. They've gone downhill fast with their service. It's too bad because their product is delicious. Our last experience there over a year ago was a disaster with snarky service. This time, their service was rather lacking, but with a smile. That won't keep my loyalty. Bye~bye, Bachi Burger!",

The oxtail chili cheese fries are also awesome, but are meant to be shared.  Finally, their shakes are also quite good.  SERVICE:  this is their major weakness.  I've been left alone forever before and they have had technical difficulties with their phone system for togo orders.  The serves range from competent and friendly to carless and aloof.  AMBIANCE:  is modern, nice, and clean.  There is plenty of room for parties of different sizes.  They are in a big mall with plenty of parking but it can get busy.  VALUE:  is decent for the quality of the food, but service needs to improve.",

I had the same burger I had last time, (Spicy Miso), but this time the patty was dry and there wasn't much flavor from the apple vinagrette.  My wife had the Bachi fish and her sandwich was much better than mine.  The worst part is that I think I got food poisoning because a couple of hours later I needed to find a bathroom BAD.  I was in Bally's and was hoping to make it back to our room at the Delano but I wasn't going to make it.  Luckily I found a bathroom in Bally's and was able to get some relief.  But I had to stop at bathrooms 2 more times before we made it back to Delano.  I was the only one in our party that had the Wagyu beef so I think that was the culprit.",

Order drinks and wait 15 minutes for them to arrive, with only two other tables occupied? Nice start. Ordered water without ice? What did we get? Water with ice. Ordered food and drinks at the same time, but it took 45 minutes to get our burgers. Ordered the burger medium-well, which should have a tinge of light pink. It didn't. Good thing I didn't order them well-done as I'm guessing it would amount to a self-defense weapon with otherworldly hardness!!! Add bacon for $2.50, which is one piece of bacon cut in half. Yes, we speak Russian, among other languages, but why in the world would one of the other two tables rubberneck themselves into what they apparently considered a stare to the death. That was extremely unpleasant.  In conclusion, terrible service with even worse food.

    "text": "I've been twice and the second visit reinforced the flavorful experience of the first.  In fact, it was probably better the second time.  After hearing a decent amount of buzz about Bachi Burger, the time came to give it a try.  Very tasty and definitely satisfying.  The first visit I enjoyed a Spicy Miso Burger with a side of the Salt & Pepper Garlic Fries (with Maui onion sea salt and garlic chili aioli).  On the second visit I tried the Ronin Burger and had Just Fries (with sea salt & pineapple ketchup) on the side.  Both burgers were delicious and I can't recommend one over the other, although I think the flavor of the Japanese Cole Slaw on the Ronin makes it my favorite of the two I tried.  My wife had the Myiagi-San's Burger and Just Fries both times.  I loved the garlic fries, but also love the pineapple ketchup that comes with the \"Just Fries\".  I'll face a difficult fry choice next time!   A burger and a side of fries is a very satisfying portion, so unless you have a huge appetite your tummy will be happy with these basics.  If you're at lunch with someone and want the same kind of fries, you may want to consider splitting an order to leave a little room to try something else on the same visit.  Needless to say, there's a lot left for me to explore on the menu:  an assortment of appetizers, Bao sandwiches and salads , and I intend to do it soon.  This location is in the Village Square shopping center located at the intersection of W. Sahara Ave and Ft. Apache Rd.  Because it's nestled between the Regal Cinemas and Rocket Fiz Las Vegas, there's tons of parking.  Hungry?  Swing in and give this regional chain (with locations in California and here in Nevada) a try.  It's definitely worth checking out the Asian influenced spin on the traditional American hamburger.",

They have a new location that opened up in Summerlin which is great because there is rarely ever a wait!   We ordered some Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries to share - it is served with garlic aioli dipping sauce and a fried egg. These fries are a must order if you ever come to Bachi Burger. I have tried the Ronin Burger - angus beef, caramelized onions, Japanese cole slaw, miso goma dressing, with a fried egg and katsu BBQ Sauce - delicious burger and a group favorite.   On my most recent visit I tried Miyagi-san's Grass Fed Wagyu Burger - Wagyu meat with chili mayo, caramelized bacon, crispy onion rings, topped with furikake and a fried egg. This burger was bomb, loved every bite of it.   They have a nice selection of milk tea drinks and specialty sodas that are worth a try as well. Great place for an upscale burger.",

First walked in and took awhile for servers to acknowledge and walk over since they don't have a dedicated hostess. Noticed the decent sized menu but a bit pricey. Known for the oxtail chili cheese fries at $11.00 and it was aright. The chili and beans were too sweet which just threw off the whole dish. The miyagi-san burger at $15.00 was small but had wagyu beef and was cooked well.   Service was a bit slow at times. I wouldn't drive all the way out here from the strip or cab it but instead just get another burger with so many other options available.",

    "text": "Best burger in Las Vegas??? Getting there, if only the meat gets better. A burger should be juicy and hot. It should taste meaty, manly almost. Bachi has all the right ingredients for a fantastic burger joint. Great decor. Perfect bread. Exotics like Foe Gras. Right size burgers. Fries cooked and seasoned to perfection. I just wish the meat is better. I mean, Wagyu patties should taste significantly better than regular ground patties. But it doesn't, it's indiscernible because their side ingredients are cooked so well.   My advice (I'm not a professional chef by any means) they need to: 1. Add more fat to the meat 2. Do not over cook or squeeze the juices out 3. Don't let it rest for too long and cool down.   My final advice and too late, is if you have a liquor license, why not make a cool bar to hang out at? So much potential to be amazing!",

I don't usually go for the specialty burgers because they all usually have great ingredients that I love but one too many that throws me off.  So I just ordered my own with whatever I wanted on it.  My one complaint, and this happens at a lot of burger joints, is that they over cook the burger.  For instance, medium came out medium well or almost well done.  Appetizer was the fried chicken.  My god that was cooked perfectly and exploded with flavor.  I love their fries as well.  Still though, as a whole this was a great experience.  I know it has just opened, but by the way it was being run, looks like it's been open for years.",

The fries were skinny fries and were crunchy with a hot soft center.  Very flavorful with a hint of lime.  The burger was beyond good.

The dark bamboo decor  is very reminiscent of many sushi spots in the valley, but that's where things get remixed (reee-mixmixmixmixmix)  I just remixed the remix in case your mind was blown.    A diverse selection of beers and sakes go very well with the Asian influences on this well-executed burger joint.  They have offerings from Rogue, Dogfish Head, Sapporo, and a few other Japanese breweries I wasn't familiar with.    A very nice waitress informed me of her favorites, and I chose to take her (and many other yelper's) advice.  My order:  Fried Chicken Appetizer - Similar to orange chicken at many Americanized Chinese restaurants, these little morsels were lightly breaded and flavored with ginger, garlic, and shoyu.  I thought these were good but I wouldn't rush to order them again.  Kiki Buger - Shitake, Enoki, and Enigii mushrooms with caramelized onions, a delicious bacon marmalade, and an aged gruyere.  A very delicious burger for sure, I got mine medium and it was cooked exactly to my request.    **Bachi uses a soy/ponzu base with all it's burgers, so expect a \"Japanese\" flavor more than what you would get at any other Hamburger place. I thought it was very tasty, and welcomed it as a refreshing change from the typical flavors of the beef elsewhere.   Fries w/ sea salt - Average and forgettable.  However, the fries were served with a pineapple ketchup that was delicious.  I've heard of flavored ketchups, but this was my first experience, and I'm convinced.  If you see pineapple or banana ketchup on a menu, don't listen to your friends, they're jealous, and not as cool as you are, just get it and you'll be happy.    I see where all the hype is coming from regarding Bachi Burger.  They offer a unique approach to an American staple, and execute with the mastery of a Karate Black Belt.......HIYYAAAAA!!!",

I have to take 1 star off for service and a ridiculous story. My roommate used to work at the Blue Diamond location and knows the menu fairly well. He ordered a burger medium rare and it clearly came out on the verge of well done. When he said something the head chef had the nerve to come out and say that's how that particular burger looks when it is medium rare. Apparently he was trying to make sure he didn't have to cook another burger but obviously that's awful customer service. Shame on you Bachi Burger.

My burger came charred. I ordered med-well and was advise it would be pink in the middle. I said,\"perfect\"....well, that wasn't the case when it showed up. The Bun and Veggies were up to par. I ordered an egg with it and it was cooked perfectly. It was the patty that ruined the meal- the flakes of charred matter killed the burger. I couldn't even taste the red onion  *Just Fries -  Over priced ($3.50) for plain skinny fries.   *Root Beer -  Soda machine needs calibration. $2.50 for a flat soda. I asked for another and they cranked up the carbonation mix and it tasted too carbonated.  The only reason why the place gets 2 stars instead of 1 is the atmosphere and its employees.The manager was very apologetic and asked what she could do to make it up.  Sorry Bachi, I can get a decent burger, fries and \"coke\" for $10 at fuddruckers or fatburger. And for a little over $5 I can get an In-n-out burger.  For $20 - go to the Eiffel Tower Restaurant inside Paris Hotel and Casino and order a Lamb Burger (5 stars). There's a dress code; so no flip-flops and shorts",

We were pretty stoked to finally make our way to Bachi Burger, a lot of people we know LOVE it.   The restaurant is nice, almost too nice for a burger place. People are dressed in shorts and tank tops and there is low mood lighting and fancy serving plates. I never got comfortable there, can I slouch in my chair and relax, or do I sit up straight with my napkin in my lap? (About 10 minutes before we were about to leave, someone hit the switch and glaringly bright cafeteria like lights blasted on. Holy crap! Blinded!)    We ordered burgers and fries. The burgers were good. Interestingly good. The garlic fries, not so much. It was an expensive cone of bits with no flavor.   My husband and I both agree that it's a place you have to try but we're in no hurry to go back. Our burgers where good but didn't fill that \"I'm in the mood for a good burger\" craving.

When I arrived to pick it up I found a somewhat charming little sit-down burger place with a surprisingly large number of people dining in (considering that it is in a strip-mall and I was there at an odd time - around 3pm).  The item I had is not on the menu, but I saw a delicious-looking photo on their website, so I asked about it when I called. The Shogun Burger - kobe beef burger with seared foie gras, BBQ eel, and a special sauce. The bun was perfectly toasted and fluffy, the burger was medium rare, juicy, and delcious, and the toppings were awesome. It was a little heavy on the sauce (I'm not sure exactly what it was) so I would definitely ask for less next time, or even on the side. Also, it was a very very rich sandwich, so make sure you're in the mood for that before ordering.  Service was friendly and quick! Can't wait to go back and try their other specialty burgers.",

    "text": "Finally, I made it to Bachi Burger. Burgers ordered were the Spicy Miso and Robin Burgers. I must say these burgers are magical. They tantalize the taste buds and magically disppear leaving behind a satisfying grin from ear to ear. The combination of ingredients not only boggles the mind but mistifies the thought that any other burger could compare. My Spicy Miso Burger had just right amount of spice and at the suggestion of my server opted for grilled onion to top it off, what a treat. I'd eat here everday if not for spending $42 for burgers and some edamame keeps me from doing so. Five stars all day.",

The burger was a solid 8.5 with the wagyu beef and onion rings dominating the flavor profile. The crunch of the onion ring was reminiscent of a Carls Jr. Western bacon cheeseburger. The oxtail chili cheese fries and truffle fries were super savory, although they were a bit salty. The sweet potato fries come with a citrus, horseradish sauce that I cannot reccomend. I made the mistake of sampling it last and the aftertaste ruined all the goodness I had earlier in my meal,  This location is a good size and can accommodate large groups. When I'm in Summerlin ill definitely be back.",

This is just poor management! Then it took them 30 minutes to bring out our food. It was obvious they were more focused on their regulars because they got their food first yet we arrived at least 15 minutes before them. Finally, the food was not that great, kid's burgers were hard and overcooked. Cooking burgers is what they should know how to do correctly yet they sent it out for my kids to eat. I guess they assume since it's a kids meal the kids won't know any better. In all I spent $75 for burgers that's were not good! Never coming back!",

I didn't know this until the last time I went a few days ago, but they have a lunch special for $19- appetizer, burger, fries, dessert, and drink (soda or tea)! Amazing deal for such high quality eats, especially considering some of their burgers by themselves are $15. My husband and I got the smoked salmon soup, brussels sprouts, Ronin and Kiki burgers, truffle fries and the doughnuts and panna cotta desserts, and everything tasted amazing. What made it even better was that for all of that, we paid $50 including tip! Very reasonable considering how much food we got.  Whenever I'm in the Summerlin area, Bachi Burger is definitely a must.",

Well my curiosity has been satisfied and I'm sure I'll never feel the need to visit this place again.  It struck me as a typical trendy place that yuppies feel they need to visit as all the other yuppies do.   \"Oh the food is sooo good!!\" \"Really? You've eaten there?\" \"No. But all my yuppy friends have and they say it's good so it must be.\"  I only give it a two because the service and presentation of the food was decent.  We ordered something called oxtail fries which were horrible. I'm sure an actual oxtail would probably have been tastier.  My girlfriend and I each ordered a different burger so we could sample each others. Sorry I can't remember what they were called but we didn't care for either one. The best compliment I could pay them is to say they were at least edible.  So as mentioned the service was decent and the food looked presentable but as far as taste I can't recommend this place.   Perhaps it's just me. Maybe the asian fusion just isn't my type of food.   I'd rather have a Wendys burger over this place.",

I've gone in there 20-30 min before closing and it hasn't been nearly as bad as this recent visit. The girl that sat us down turned out to be a waitress. She took almost 5 minutes to offer us drinks. We literally had to ask who our waiter was. We placed our order and it took longer than usual, the restaurant was not busy for us to experience terrible service. She didn't bother checking in on us or asking if we needed something else. The only time she checked in on us was when we would call her over for condiments. We asked for our burgers to be wrapped in lettuce as we had done so on our previous visit. When our burgers arrived we laughed they literally put lettuce on the bottom and the meat and veggies on top. Needless to say this was the worst experience we have encountered at Bachi burger,",

    "text": "So, I'm already a big fan of Bachi Burger as I've visited their Windmill location numerous times. What prompted me to visit this location was based on the last three unsuccessful experiences I had at the other location -- hour-long waits and unhelpful individuals. I almost gave up on Bachi Burger, even though that would have hurt me more than it hurt them. One evening, my friend and I remembered their Summerlin location and fortunately, it was approximately the same distance from our homes, so we decided to give them chance.  Our experience was wonderful from start to finish. There was no other parties waiting and we were approached immediately. After checking in with us, we were told that it would be 5-10 minutes (though a little odd since, again, there was no one waiting and half the restaurant was empty tables). We were just happy that it wasn't 45-60 minutes! However, before we could even get comfortable with a Seven magazine, we were escorted to our table with a sincere apology (for the wait) from the hostess. We told her, \"Don't be ridiculous, we hardly waited!\" Our server was friendly and attentive; we were so delighted.  I went with my usual Spicy Miso Burger and Salt & Pepper Garlic Fries. All very, very delicious. For dessert, I opted for a boba milk tea drink. I couldn't decide between Almond and Taro Coconut, so our server recommended a blend of the two, exclaiming that it was her favorite drink! Of course, I had to and it was delicious.   I'm definitely coming back, however, to this location only and hopefully they don't let their popularity get to their heads like their sister location.",

Every time though, awkward situation with the host/hostess situation. Perhaps they've fixed it by now.  I always ordered the mushroom patty burger (forget the name). Super delicious. Seriously, ground mushroom patty here is amazing. It's wicked. They have cheaper/smaller apps on happy hour menu, oxtail chili fries! Complete with an egg on top. My boyfriend and I could never stop eating these, even if it meant stuffing our bellies pre-burgers. If you like sangria, try both. I love the white, but red is great, too.  Like I said, our waitress is always great. My drink is never empty, and we rarely had the same girl. Odd part, as I also mentioned, is getting seated. There are tons of empty tables, but we'd wait 15 minutes to get seated. Every time. A few times, we'd wait so long the hostess would forget and seat someone who rolled in after us first, and we'd have to remind her we weren't waiting for pickup or just chilling there for the hell of it. Really awkward. So...not sure what's up...however, don't avoid this place because of it. I came back to eat, the situation before being seated is just like sitting in traffic to get here. You deal.",

This spot here on Sahara and Ft Apache is a bit bigger with a less waiting period. Actually, I don't ever recall having to wait at all at this location.  Tonight I met up and made great new friends from the yelp community. Terri, Chad and Mel. Terri looks like she's pimpin' Asian males around her haha. But on to the good stuff. Tonight's choice of burger was the spicy miso burger but this time with a change to the beef. Instead of the angus beef it usually comes with, I took our server's recommendation to try it with the wagyu beef and wow was she right. This beef is so much more tender and juicy, especially when done medium rare. It literally did melt in my mouth, had me drooling like Homer Simpson. It also came with all the goodies I like from the spicy miso burger (Onions, Shishito Pepper Mayo, Lettuce , Roasted Garlic, Cheese, Fried Egg, Apple Vinaigrette). All the burgers I order from here are ones with fried eggs in them. I just love the taste of yolk melting over the beef.   It's a must that you also try their oxtail or garlic fries. Simply irresistible taste. Unfortunately I didn't get any tonight because I was still planning on going for a run and didn't want to get too full.    I can't remember the names but plenty of good beer to try out here as well. This place is a must to those who have not been here yet. Sucks to be a vegetarian!",

The bad: We waited about an hour after placing our order. It wasn't even busy. They served one of our party way way earlier than the rest of us. I ordered the bahn mi burger and it didn't have any of the ingredients that  make it a bahn mi burger. They ended up comping me the burger, but given that they got so much else wrong, it didn't matter.  If our hostess reads this, escape while you can. You are so much better than this place!",

    "text": "Oh Bachi, I didn't want to love you. But love you, I did.  My brother was visiting and Bachi was a must do on his list. So off we went.  We ordered a kids menu grilled cheese and fries, oxtail fries, fried calamari, bahn mi burger, kalbi burger and bachi fish burger. Since it was our first time, we all shared our food since we wanted to try a little bit of everything.   I actually loved everything except the oxtail fries. They were good, but I wasn't impressed.   The fried calamari was good. However, you get such a small plate for $12. Definitely not the best calamari I have had in town, so for the price I would pass on this.  The bahn mi burger was Amazing. I could really taste all the flavors expected out of a bahn mi and the burger itself was juicy and cooked perfectly. Nuoc cham for a dipping sauce too? Oh yeah, you can't go wrong.  The kalbi burger was Delicious as well, just a little bit salty. I was a huge fan of the cucumber kimchi served on the side. I wanted more of that. I couldn't get enough.  The fish burger did not let us down either. It was very moist and delectable.   The winner for me was my son loving his kid friendly meal. It is important that a kid meal is actually kid friendly and I wasn't too sure at first but his grilled cheese was perfect. Cheese melted in between a hamburger bun with a side of fries. My only complaint - too expensive.   So yeah, I am on the Bachi Burger Train. We shall return. And return soon.",

Left side of the restaurant had 8 tables open and another 7 or 8 tables open on the right side but was told the wait time to be seated was 10-15min, not sure why when there were at least 7 staff members on the floor. Then a couple who arrived after us got seated first.  Finally got seated (must mention another couple left after waiting for so long to be seated) and we told the server our orders of what we wanted. Our appetizer arrived along with my green tea but then never got a refill or even offered another cup although it was bottomless tea. The couple who got seated after us, got their appetizer and half way through that they received their burgers -WTF?! Seen 4 burgers on the pass and none of them delivered to us after waiting another 15-20min. Sad thing is that our burgers were the simplest ones to make, and we got deliver the wrong fries. Our server never came to our table to check on us until it was time to give us the check.  NEVER going to this place again!",

    "text": "Gordon Ramsayesque review - Looks like someone took a crap on my plate.  It taste like it too.  Putting it gently, three years later, gone are the crowds and for good reason, the food has become shockingly bad.  To start, the once good oxtail chili cheese fries has become a disgusting mess.  Stringy, over braised, oxtail meat stewed in excessive quantities of cheap (taste like dirt) chili powder then slopped atop soggy fries.  An overcooked, rubbery egg with almost no yolk, processed cheese, wilted cilantro, and shriveled, rubbery Jalapeno peppers round out the dish.   No.  To the patties used for the burgers, yes, adding a little sauce in the raw mix adds flavor.  Adding too much makes the meat wet with an odd texture and causes the burger to break apart when eating.  The toppings lack freshness and now passe sauces are so heavily slathered on, the flavors are completely overpowering and off balance.    Epic fail for the Kalbi burger (patty fell apart, kalbi marinade and ko chu jang mayo dripping everywhere).  The Spicy Miso burger not far behind, it too oozing some sweet miso concoction, mushy meat falling out with almost no toppings except a hardened piece of cheese in the center of a apple vinaigrette soaked bun.  No and no.  Service is off the Strip friendly and fast but with only three other tables at peak lunch hour, it better be.  Maybe just trying too hard to up the ante in Asian fusion flavors.  Not recommended.",

There was a variety and they're house made. Only complaint was I wanted MORE.   The fries were hot and crispy. I didn't taste much pepper or salt so that was my only complaint. Still yummy though.   The burger was ginormous and delicious. I cut it in half which I'm not sure was a good idea...it just made a bigger mess. Overall it was so delicious. The burger patty was very \"meaty\" tasting and had a nice crispy outside. The veggies and bun were fresh and everything tasted great. Def the kinda burger you can't put down...messy and lots of napkins needed.   The service wasn't great but nothing bad either....just neutral. The restaurant was clean and comfortable.",

Around 2pm today (Friday) I walked in looking around to see if my party have already seated, I did not find them so I went to use the bathroom, I came out from the bathroom, went back to the front and ask one of the server if I could get a table for 4. The place is very small and had about 3 tables being occupied.  I'd say 4 young male and female employees, most of them are  gathering in the back and no one had greeted me until I asked.   Our waiter can use some advice on how to become a better waiter. You don't say \" oh ya, he has one, he can hand it to you\" when someone ask for a menu. You just don't!  and... I was the only girl in my group, my order was taken last and handed me the bill at the end... what a treat!  Bunch of kids working here and can definitely use some guidance.",

    "text": "I'm not happy about this, but I had to bump one star off of their rating due to our second visit here.  Overall I loved the concept of the banh mi burger (plus I'm Vietnamese), but in regards to execution and flavor, it failed for me. The burger wasn't moist like the Kiki's burger. I soon realized that it's not moist or juicy because it's a ground pork and beef mixture for the patty. The ground pork definitely caused the patty to dry out. The patty also was extremely bland, it could of definitely used more time marinating. Lastly, the nuoc cham (fish sauce) dipping sauce for the burger was watery and didn't do the burger any justice.   Also, we ordered a side of grilled shishito peppers. The sweet soy seasoning was delicious and enhanced the shishito peppers natural sweetness. We enjoyed the entire bowl until the very end. Out of nowhere, the very last 2 peppers were aggressively spicy! It took us by such shock since we didn't know that shishito peppers could be that spicy. We popped the entire huge pepper in our mouth and we were both soon very irritated and uncomfortable by the spice level of the pepper. Mind you, we are spice eaters and avid fans of spicy food. But this was like a very bad prank. We were not expecting something to burn so bad, it was so intense! Plus we chomped the entire pepper not knowing any better. It ruined my taste buds and my throat was swollen for a good 30 minutes. Yep, it was an episode of punk'd. Be careful you non spice eaters! That one is a doozy!",

We ordered:  Shishito peppers: It came with a sweet sauce and it was smokey in flavor with a bit of FIYAH! as you get closer towards the stem (those sneaky seeds...) absolutely amazing...especially in between bites of burger!  Kurobuta sausages: Tasted very similar to hot dogs, yet at the same time, not quite. Very salty and sodium-filled, if you like extra savory apps. The mustard that came with it def cut down on the overwhelming saltiness and made it much more delightful though.  Kiki burger: I love shrooms (no not those kind!) and this really made my day. Delicious, juicy patty, oozing with deliciousness, topped with equally appetizing medley of mushrooms (all types!). I killed my burger within minutes! Yummiest burger ever!!  I had a great experience here, just as I did at the other location, and I can't wait to be back! Definitely a MUST-GO when you are in Vegas :)",

    "text": "How much do I love thee, Let me count the ways... You had me at first bite with the oxtail fries. Then fell more in love with the pork belly and it was game over with the shogun burger. Dammnnnnn... So good. All of it... I had been wanting to eat here for a few years now but never could align the stars whenever I was in town. My friends that had tried it, raved about it and I've been kicking myself ever since. I finally went here a few weeks ago and am so glad I did. I saw the light. All the flavors I tasted were delicious.  We first had the oxtail chili cheese fries that was topped with an egg and drizzled with garlic aioli. It was delicious. I love oxtail. I love chili cheese fries and this was a perfect marriage of both things. The fries were perfectly fried and the tender oxtail covered in cheese, cilantro & jalapeno slices were great together. The latter two i'm not big on but I ate around them and would probably eat them if it was the only way to sample this great appetizer. I definitely recommend it. It was great. I really enjoyed it.  The other thing I had before my burger was the pork belly steamed bun. It was very VERY good. 4 come in one order. Perfectly cooked and tender pork belly (a little crisp on the outside) in a small steamed bun sammich with some slices of hard boiled egg, radish, cilantro (again!), scallions and hoisin sauce. It was perfect. It was so good that I ate the cilantro and i was good. And i HATE cilantro.. I always tell my friends I don't eat weeds. Hahah... But seriously, I dont like the after taste but soldiered through it cause I figured that the chef meant it to be eaten that way and the least I can do is follow suit. That and it looked so good & I was hungry and couldnt wait so I just dug in. Order it... trust me.  On to the burger... I ordered the shogun burger because I was on a mission to have foie gras as I miss having it at Los Angeles restaurants such as Animal & Mozza. The shogun burger has a patty that's wagyu beef. It's topped with unagi, yes unagi... pan seared foie gras (YUM), asian pears & peaches and a delicious butter on the bread. It  was all good. All the unique ingredients worked well and it was quite tasty. The wagyu patty was nice & tender. The unagi was soft & tasty. The foie gras was heavenly and I wish there was more. MORE. The asian pear & peach slices helped break up the richness of all the other ingredients. It was really a nice compliment to the burger. I really liked the burger big time. Glad it had foie gras. So glad I ordered it.  I had some of the sausage platter. There were 2 types of sausages (kurobuta & arabiki) on this plate. They were tasty. Good flavor. Nice smokey & sweet taste to them. The dipping sauce was honey mustard. But it didnt even really need one. The sausages were that flavorful.   The drink I ordered was the plantation style sweet tea. It was good. A different kind of sweet tea. Hard to describe. Also tasty...   Service was very good. We had a nice Filipino girl help our party of 7 that quickly became 9. She was friendly, was a good sport and got all our orders right. She also split the bill 3 ways which was nice. Thank you Bachi... Looking forward to eating there again soon. In fact, I'm flying out to Vegas in 36 hours. Wanna guess where I'm having brunch as soon as I land??",

So, I was seated promptly and was advised that tonite was cash only as their computers were down. No worries. I ordered a glass of Malbec which they were out of, so I asked for a $9 glass of Cabernet. When the waiter brought it to me I couldn't believe how small the pour was. The glass was a short wine glass to begin with, and I would say that he poured barely 5 oz of wine it. Decided to order the $8 angus burger with cheddar added for $1.50. Since no sides came with this $9.50 burger, I ordered regular fries which came with pineapple ketchup for $3.50. I asked for extra ketchup and the waiter replied \"regular ketchup?\" so I replied \"sure\".  The burger came and was cooked to my liking and I have to say that it was delicious! Not \"$9.50 delicious\" but still very good! The fries came after my burger and was a decent sized order. Waiter brought one small side of pineapple ketchup and one regular. I loved the pineapple ketchup and asked for extra but was told that it was .50 for extra. I said no thanks as the $3.50 was already enough for plain fries. Also, I had to send the first side of regular ketchup back as it tasted old or was a very cheap brand. The waiter brought back ketchup from a different container and said they use Heinz. It was fine.  The service was very good and the burger was very, very tasty. However, my bill came to $23 which is crazy for a burger and fries and a 4oz glass of wine. Sorry, but I won't be back.",

Pretty disappointed when I took my first bite )=  Salted Caramel Milkshake (4 stars): Strong yummy caramel flavor! Best thing I tried here. But it's so small!! I finished it so fast. And the marshmallow topping takes up some of the glass filling so you really don't get a whole glass worth.   Salt and Pepper Garlic Fries (3 stars): The sauce it was with was okay. Maybe the truffle would have been better. Not very spicy at all.  SERVICE (3 stars): Got our food and never saw the server again until we were done. He also told me the chili fries were good if you like spicy food. Um, was not even spicy at all, haha, maybe I just take spice better than he does.  Wasn't impressed by this place. My friends really liked the Oxtail Fries so maybe that's what it's all about. My milkshake was good but the Burger Bar milkshakes at Mandalay Bay were better.",

    "text": "If you want a huge party in your mouth - Bachi Burger is the place to be.  There is absolutely nothing bland about their burgers. Simple it is not.   I am embarrassed to admit it but I actually first tried Bachi the day after seeing an episode of Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives.  And I am even more embarrassed to admit that my husband and I ordered everything that Guy ordered and even we found it to be \"burger bomb.com\".   We started with the pork belly sliders and loved it.  The steamed bun was nice and fluffy.  The pork belly was more pork fat than meat, but that is what makes it so delicious (and dangerous).    The oxtail chili cheese fries are also good and I am glad we tried it our first time.  I wish there was a half order because it is a huge portion. It is meant to feed a family. Regardless, we prefer the truffle parmesan fries and it is a much more reasonable sized serving.  I am not a fan of the sun dried tomato aioli that accompanies it, but at least the fries are flavorful enough that they do not even need the dipping sauce.    The Banh-Mi burger is the very first one we tried and it was filled with tons of flavor.  I love the hint of lemongrass and ginger.  The curry aioli puts this burger over the top.  We have also tried the Kiki's burger, Miyagi San's grass fed Waygu burger, and the Ronin burger over our multiple visits and they have all been quite delicious.  My favorite, however, is still the Banh-Mi.  My only complaint is that whenever we ask for \"medium\", it always comes out well done.    My kids also enjoy the kids menu of a grilled cheese or bachi burger, with fries and fruits and veggies.  Everything is delicious.  The menu is creative.  There are also tons of boba milk teas and milkshakes if you still have room in your belly.    I love the decor- it is so modern and sleek.  The service has always been fantastic.  I have never had to wait for a table for lunch, but on fridays and weekend dinners- definitely expect to wait.",

    "text": "We've heard good things about this place, so we were really excited to try it. Sadly, we didn't get the chance due to crappy service when we walked in the door. There were several empty tables, but we were told there was a short wait. That wasn't a biggie, so we sat in the waiting area & perused the menu. Lots of parties finished their meals & left. About 20 mins went by & we noticed that no tables had been cleared & no one waiting had been seated. Another customer asked the hostess if they were saving tables for a large party or something & she said \"no, we're just backed up\". 20 more mins went by & more tables became available- still they were not cleared & no one was seated. The hostess was rolling silverware & doing other side work instead of trying her best to get people seated. After 45 mins of waiting, we counted 12 empty tables & only one other party had been seated.   Having worked in restaurants in the past, it is unacceptable to me to have a hostess doing side work when there are seating issues. It should not take more than 10 mins to get empty tables cleared & people seated, especially a party of 2 like us. If you are short staffed, the hostess can help bus tables to get your wait times down.   I can't review the food or waitstaff service because we decided to leave after waiting for nearly an hour & still not being seated. I'm loathe to give this place another shot after this experience.",

    "text": "I'm a frequent visitor to LV & was there for the July 4th weekend. I've been wanting to try Bachi Burger after having it on my bookmark list for sometime...  I went there with my family for dinner (around 6:30 PM) & we had to wait for about 30 minutes. The small waiting area was packed, but the restaurant area still had some empty tables. Another couple commented about the empty tables, but the greeter said something to the effect that they didn't want to overload the kitchen and have a backlog of orders...not a good 1st impression.  However, once we were seated I found our waiter to be friendly & attentive. We ordered the following burgers: Mr. Ho's Burger, Miyagi-San's Wagyu Grass-fed Burger, Kiki's Burger & Black & Green Burger. My daughter ordered the Bachi Fish sandwich. We also ordered the Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries & the Bachi Pickles for appetizers.The fries were good, but not \"out of this world\" good...The Bachi pickles were a variety of sliced Japanese pickles, such as takuan, radish, etc. something you definitely have to have an acquired taste for... We all enjoyed our burgers, it was a different experience (positive) with the Asian fusion taste. My daughter said the Bachi Fish Sandwich was good too.  Everything was definitely pricier, but if you're looking for a different twist/experience  on eating a hamburger, I recommend giving Bachi Burger a try. Service was acceptable & the restaurant had a nice atmosphere. This particular restaurant is located at a nice location in the Village Square Shopping Center in the Summerlin area which is about 30 minutes west of the strip (movie theaters are located in this center as well :)",

Let's get one thing out of the way: I hate all things Guy Fieri but a lot of people have said a lot of good things about this place so we wanted to give it a shot.  We started with the Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries. I'm not an oxtail person but I am not lying when I tell you they were delicious. Seriously rich flavor, absolutely heaven. We also had the Crispy Fried Onion Rings, which were addictive. There is no other word.  My husband ordered the \"Banh-Mi\" Burger while I had a Bachi Burger with Swiss and bacon. The meat itself had a wonderful taste and the burgers were done perfectly. To drink we had the Thai Iced tea and a Plantation-Style Sweet Tea. My mouth is watering again thinking about the Sweet Tea.  Our waiter was awesomely attentive and it was a great experience. My only complaint would be the not-great-sounding sound system. Aside from that, I can't wait to go back again!",

The wait time was ridiculously long, but I guess that's understandable considering the popularity of the place. WHEN MY BELLY WANTS FOOD IT WANTS IT NOW.  I tried the Banh-Mi burger and I enjoyed the various flavors (minus the lemongrass) and the juiciness of it. Overall, it was just another overpriced burger. The two other friends I went with also were unsatisfied with their orders.  I'd like to give you another chance though, you're not completely friend zoned just yet.",

The service was absolutely horrendous. We got there at around 6:40 p.m. There were probably 3, maybe 4 tables that were already in use. They tried sticking us into a corner, which my mother said \"No way!\" We ordered our waters and drinks. We had to tell Gabby (our server - hoping that's her name) 3 times about the water. It didn't arrive for a good 8-10 minutes. She apologizes, saying that there were a lot of people and she was trying to keep up with everyone. ....Really? 3 tables was that overwhelming? She kept acting like she was extremely overwhelmed and flustered. We finally order our food. My mom got the Banh-Mi burger and I got Spicy Miso, as well as the truffle parmasean fries. That was another 20 minutes on top of the already 8-10 minutes of sitting there without anything. Not even the fries came out early. Two tables came after us and received their food faster than us. It was ridiculous. It wasn't even that busy in there! We finally got out at 7:20 p.m. Honestly, this was the worst service I've ever experience here. I will not be back any time soon, and she's lucky she even got a tip. The worst part was she was fully aware we were unhappy with the service and never asked \"What can I do to make this right?\" We don't want free crap, we want better service! Disappointed.",

The \"No Meat Here... Burger\" was the biggest target of gravity, and I ate most of it off the plate with a fork.   The \"Banh-Mi Burger\" had good flavor intentions. I tried cutting it in half and squishing it down in order to have all components together, but my hands were a mess afterwards.

This is a classic case of poor management. Both times I went there, we found tables available, but were told to wait 15-20 minutes.  The first time, I had a plane to catch. By the time I was seated, and they finally came over to take our order, I had to leave.  The second time, I gave them a chance. Long wait, and by the time one of the \"hip\" waitresses came over, the ice in my soft drink had melted.   The burgers were decent, but honestly, there is a Japanese Burger truck that goes to various locations. It's a lot better, a lot more fun, and better priced.   As I said before, the crowd that goes here seems really \"in\" and \"trendy\", and act like they are sitting at VIP Tables in a Club.  The waitresses act like they are cocktail waitresses at a club. The management thinks they are really cool.  If they had a product that justified this arrogant attitude, fine. My wife thought they had great Sweet Potato Fries. That's about it.",

My wife tried the grilled pork belly buns and they were also delicious, cooked perfectly and full of flavor.   I tried the 7 oz. Angus burger which was perfectly grilled and coated with a tasty soy based sauce.   Service was terrific even though the restaurant was quite crowded.    There are many delicious sounding items on the menu, not just burgers, so I am looking forward to our next visit.   I highly recommend Bachi Burger.",

    "text": "Decided to try this place after a few recommendations from some friends, As soon as we walked in, we noticed that it wasn't too busy and assumed that we would be able to get more attentive service. When the host asked if it was just us two, he seemed to have an attitude and looked bothered. When we were seated we were given water right away and asked if we wanted anything else to drink and that's when everything went bad.  We decided right away what we wanted from looking at the menu on line and closed our menus to show that we were ready. After about four minutes we timed to see how long it was actually take someone to notice that we were ready to order. Again, it was not very busy and a lot of the servers were just walking about aimlessly and didn't give us a second look. After 8 minutes we were just amazed that no one even attempted to ask us what we wanted. After 11 minutes of waiting my girlfriend finally asked one of the girls clearing the table if someone could please take our order. Now, I understand when a place is busy and you might have to wait a few minutes or even remind your waiter you're ready, but when you have a bunch of people in the back who give the appearance of not doing anything but chatting and just walking around is not acceptable.  Once we finally ordered our food from our server who apologized for the wait, we thought that everything would be OK from there. Again we were wrong. We decided to try the oxtail fries, spicy miso burger, and the miyagi. The oxtail fries were alright and landed up being the only appetizing part of our meal. The miyagi burger was just OK. It was pretty greasy and I could barely taste any of the bacon. The spicy miso burger was not good at all. It was not remotely spicy and after eating less than half the burger, it started to taste really soggy. We opened the burger up and the meat was just falling apart and looked like mush. It was more rare than medium. At this point, it was about an hour that we had been there. We didn't want to send the burger back for fear of having to wait longer when we just wanted to leave.  Finally the check came and again we waited another ten minutes before my girlfriend had to hail the waitress to ring us out. She apologized again but at this point, apologies didn't mean anything.  We might've just come here on an \"off\" night but even off nights have some redeeming quality. I will not be coming back to this place ever and was very disappointed.",

It looks to be larger than their original spot but only half of the dining room was being used the night I went.   The wife went with the kiki burger -- always a good choice. New to the menu (at least since the last time I went to Bachi Burger) is their lobster roll ($15). It's two mini buns stuffed with lobster mixed with fennel and a curry spiced aioli with lettuce. It may not be a traditional lobster roll flavor, but the curry creates a unique and tasty asian-inspired version of this classic. The freshly fried taro chips that accompany the dish were delicious as well.  Service was good, especially considering that the place just opened earlier this week. Although it was odd that my wife's burger came out several minutes before my food or our son's food did. But, I'm sure minor issues like that will improve over time.  4.5 Stars",

My waitress was knowledgeable and personable. She really did cater to my every need with a smile to boot! I love sauces and she brought me some of the sauces I was interested in. They were all wonderful and so different! I was dipping my truffle fries in a variety of sauces which made every bite different and exciting. It was quite evident they were using high quality ingredients to create these interesting flavor combinations. Burger cooked perfectly! Finally pink in my burger!!!  Something else unique that I really appreciated was the spin on \"salt and pepper\" at the table. For the pepper they had a very find ground red chili pepper that has a lot more luck than the basic black pepper. For salt they had some smokey black bit more course salt. As if that weren't enough, they also have a chili water to drizzle on whatever you please. It has a nice flavor and kick.  If you like fun interesting flavors, premium ingredients, awesome sauces, friendly knowledge staff, and a full belly, do yourself a favor and check out Bachi Burger!",

What's not to like?  We ordered the onion rings, the kiki, and the truffle fries.  The onion rings were delicious! They're tempura style so they're nice and crunchy.  You also don't get the problem where you take a bite and the entire onion falls out of the crust.  The truffle fries were good, but I wasn't the hugest fan of the gravy on them.  I guess I'm a \"purest\" when it comes to truffle fries.  The only things on them should be garlic, truffle oil, parmesan, and maybe some parsley.  On to the kiki.  How can you go wrong with onion jam, mushrooms, and bacon??? It was very good, but not the best burger I've had.  The Taiwanese sweet bread bun was really tasty, but the burger was lacking the meat flavor I'm accustomed to getting in a good burger.    However, I hear that they're opening a location in my hood (West LA) so I'll be sure to take my fiance there to check it out.",

    "text": "This place is ok, but I definitely don't get the hype that surrounds it- there are 1/2 dozen or more places on the strip that are substantially better. Many reviewers go here frequently it looks like- I have only been twice but based on those visits I won't be returning.   Everyone raves about the Oxtail cheese fries- but the ones I ordered were essentially mush. The cheese was extremely greasy- something I would usually be all for- but they lacked any clear flavor and the fries disintegrated if you tried to pick them up. I consider myself a bit of a cheese fry connoisseur- I didn't attend 7 years of cheese fry medical school to be called Mr.- so this really hurt the rating for me. The addition of cheese to fries is a sacred act in my religion and must be treated with respect.   Truffle fries- these were much better.  I have had two burgers there-the spicy miso and the Ronin. Both came a tad overcooked (grey throughout when ordered medium rare). The flavor wasn't that strong - I don't know a better way to put it- the burger just tasted weak.   Service- as other reviewers have mentioned at least the Summerlin location is not very busy/it is easy to get a table. However, despite not being full the service was not very attentive. The meals probably took an extra 30-45 minutes due to slow ordering/check bringing etc.",

    "text": "Bachi used to be a favorite for me. However I was there Friday night and the experience was sub-par to say the least. First, the server was very slow and inattentive. We got our drinks (sodas and iced tea), but we had to ask for waters 3 times. The host finally came over and brought them. The server seemed annoyed, but that's OK. In fairness, the appetizers were GREAT! Calamari and Ox Tail Chili Fries - awesome. There were 5 of us at the table and we all loved them - even got another order of calamari. Dinner comes - my girlfriend gets hers, then almost 10 minutes go by before the rest of get our food - our server, the hostess and another server brought the orders (along with apologizing for the delay) finally. Back it up a bit, 2 items we ordered were 86'd (out of the item), OK - ordered something else, no big deal. So, I ordered my burger VERY well - done, do't judge, that's how I like them. My friend ordered his well done. When the server brought our burgers  asked which was which, she said (and I quote), \"Uhhh, the more well-done one should be the smaller one.\" Um, OK. So it wasn't. It was medium at best, my friend who ordered well, ad the more well-done burger. And they were cold. I didn't send mine back, because I didn't want to wait. They were also obviously thinner than they used to be. The only thing the server did quickly was bring our checks. So quick in fact, one of was still eating! I'm not talking about 1 bite left, I mean half of his meal. She dropped off the checks and was back in less than 90 seconds for the payments. I know because I timed it out of curiosity. Unfortunately for her, her tip was commensurate with her level of service. Couldn't blame her for the under-cooked burger or the 86'd items, but I can blame her for the lousy service and bum's rush at the end. I will add that Bachi Burger is normally very busy and you need to wait for a table, this time it was barely 1/4 full. I see why now. Very sad to see this place in this condition. A final note - the bathroom - the urinal was out of order and judging by the dust on the Hefty bag covering it, it had been for some time. And the curtain separating the dining room from the bathroom hall was very obviously filthy.",

The dining area is small and crowded so there may be a wait during peak hours. And this isn't your run-of-the-mill burger joint so the prices are higher. That being said, whoever came up with these delicious burgers infused with Asian ingredients certainly knows what they're doing.   This was my first time so I went big. Really big. Miyagi-san's Grass Fed Wagyu Burger ($13) is a tower of burger perfection, much as the other options I saw pass our table appeared to be. The toppings on this one are chili mayo, fried egg, furikake (a Japanese condiment that includes sesame seeds), caramelized bacon, and onion rings that are lightly breaded and crisp. All in all, one of the best burgers I've had in a long time. Bring your appetite!",

We visited on a Saturday afternoon. It was busy, but not overly crowded. We were seated in timely fashion and the waiter was there for drink orders quickly. The food was unique and very tasty.  I think it was a little pricy, as my thirteen dollar burger did not include fries which were an additional charge. Forty-one dollars for lunch for two without alcohol or appetizers is a little on the high side for me, however the side orders of french fries were probably big enough for two to split. I would have rated four stars had it not been for the leak in the ceiling that we were seated under. When we brought the leak to the hostess's attention, she responded with \"well, we've had problems with that in the past\".",

I don't know how you can come here and not get the Shogun burger. I mean, it's a burger. With foie gras.  I don't understand the question. However, fair warning, the burger is pretty rich and I think if we hadn't gone halvsies with another burger that involved a taro bun which was interesting, I definitely wouldn't have been able to finish an entire Shogun burger by myself. We also ordered the oxtail chili fries which was huge and basically impossible to finish. After this super rich lunch, I was very happy but also just wanted to unbutton my pants and lie down for a few hours.   Also they have a nice beer and sake menu.",

I ended up here because my stand-in date for the evening, Kevin P. suggested it after seeing a show downtown. When we were seated, we were spotted by 2 of our Yelp buddies and ended up joining them for dinner. This was the first time any of the four of us had been here before, so we were a quad of Bachi virgins. Our friends had already ordered so we hurried and got our order in too.  My first Asian Fusion Burger... a little scary for me, so I opted for the BBQ Bachi Burger with bacon, not really Asian now is it? <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bachi-burger-las-vegas-2?select=aoukR51Zn9nC8SLHQ9Nuvw#CMhdPUkwikeURGRpixQYOw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/bach...</a> My burger was good, not too sausy  which I appreciated, but decent flavor. Their bun was soft and a little sweet. Kevin went all out and ordered the Shogun burger, he has more balls than I do. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bachi-burger-las-vegas-2?select=aoukR51Zn9nC8SLHQ9Nuvw#JrpSQPuPkCuqcSXkLeE93A\">yelp.com/biz_photos/bach...</a> For me, if I spend $25 on a burger I better be raving about it! He seemed to enjoy it but definitively wasn't raving... he also ordered the Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries (he's a big spender - $11.50 just  for french fries) <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bachi-burger-las-vegas-2?select=aoukR51Zn9nC8SLHQ9Nuvw#cOTkdWIsTkh4Gu4mLgsLZg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/bach...</a>. These scared me too because they came with a fried egg piled right on top.. am I the only person who thinks this is odd? But I was so glad he ordered them because they were delicious, the jalapenos were were a fun taste explosion with the egg! I'd come back just for these fries!  Our server was top notch, she was friendly and joked around with us. She was patient with our meal requests and checked back on us frequently, she was 5 star all the way.  Our fellow Yelpers ordered the No Meat Here \"Burger\" <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bachi-burger-las-vegas-2?select=aoukR51Zn9nC8SLHQ9Nuvw#VLK240RnTcPEkeIX2MOAoA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/bach...</a> and The Lonely Bird. No one seemed to complain about their burgers, but no one was really bowled over. They tried the Garlic Edamame and thought it needed more garlic, they didn't care for their sweet potato fries, but they did enjoy their truffle fries <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bachi-burger-las-vegas-2?select=aoukR51Zn9nC8SLHQ9Nuvw#4pQmh02OeugST4oQtepO2w\">yelp.com/biz_photos/bach...</a> - good to know.We all seemed to enjoy our meal and conversation. I don't think any of us would mind eating here again, but I also don't know that we'll be rushing to come back.",

The Kiki burger blew away the kalbi burger in terms of transcending flavors bursting in your mouth. People love in n out, fat burgers, smash burgers, but they're just burgers.

Highly recommend the Chili Oxtail Fries as a starter. You can't get it anywhere else! Its a huge serving so sharing would be good. Or try the salt & pepper fries for a smaller serving. They also have bachi bites added to their menu now for happy hour, so little plates if your not feeling a burger. The salted marshmellow milkshake is to die for. I love this place! The only thing I would say is on some days the food might take a while, but if u got good company, you wouldn't even notice.",

We came for lunch on a Sunday and there was a lot of seating open; no wait whatsoever.  Oxtail Fries:  This item is a knockout.  VERY large portion.  It was enough for six of us to share.  Think \"chili cheese fries\" but with chopped up oxtail chunks.  It also has a fried egg on top.  A perfect combination of both salty and sweet.  This item is a MUST TRY if you come here.  Just be prepared because it is a very large portion.  Kiki Burger:  Again, a perfect combo of sweet juicy meat on a buttery bun.  I don't have \"sweet\" burgers very often, but this tasted just like sweet marinated Korean meat but made into a burger format.  Black and Green:  I actually didn't like this as much as the Kiki Burger.  For whatever reason, it had a bit of a bitter aftertaste to it.  Not sure which ingredient caused that.  Not a bad burger, but I preferred the Kiki Burger to this one (and the Kiki was cheaper too).",

They put like 8 diff types of meat into 1 patty, (pork, beef, pate, shrimp...I can't remember the rest), add some tasty lettuce, picked dikon and radish, and give you a sweet dipping sauce on the side.  The patty was succulent and a great combination with the fluffy, soft bun...  had the tasty flavors of banh mi with the best parts of a burger (big bun, juicy patty)   Everything great fusion should be. Can't wait to come back.",

Asian inspired burgers and a complement of great sides (e.g. salt and pepper garlic fries, pork belly stand buns) make this place unique. Sometimes the time from food to table can be a bit long, but it takes time to make great gourmet food from scratch. A must try if you've never been.",

My friend and I dropped by and sat at the bar and looked at the list of burgers and was ready.  Because the two of us could eat, we ordered:  1 Miyagi san Wagyu burger (you really can't go wrong with any of the burgers) 1 Kiki burger 1 Parmesan truffle fries 1 Oxtail chili fries 1 Steamed pork buns (it came with three and I seriously could've had six)  And because it was my birthday, the server brought me deep fried donuts with coffee flavored ice cream.  With bellies full, my friend and I made our way out feeling good despite the $40 taxi ride from the Paris hotel to the restaurant.",

I also love the spicy fries with aioli.   I have tried three different fusion burgers and still haven't hit on one that works perfectly.  My latest was the Myagi-San, complete with bacon, egg, fried onions and furikake.  The onions were a little soggy, but the bacon and egg were tasty accompaniments.  My two dining companions both received burgers that were under-cooked.  One only slightly, but the other that was to be medium-well looked far closer to medium-rare. However, there is enough here that is being done right, to keep me going back.",

Ever since we landed we have been running here and there so I'm really tired. But as soon as the food started coming and from the first bite, I had a new sense of awaking and caught my second wind.   Appetizers:  We started out with some brussel sprouts ($8.50). It is sauteed with Asian pear, with bits of smoked bacon, in sweet soy glaze.    Truffle Parmesan Fries ($4.50) it had a black porcini cream sauce drizzle, topped with Parmesan reggiano and a sun dried tomatoe aioli dipping sauce.   Last but not least the Crispy \"Tebasaki\" Chicken Wings ($10.00). It was really good. Two thumbs up!  I tried the Kiki's Burger ($13.00) which is an Angus beef patty with sauteed shiitake, enoki and eryngil mushrooms, caramelized bacon, sweet onion marmalade, gruyere cheese with garlic chilli aioli. It was really tasty that I real didn't want to share even a bite of it with my better half.   They also have beer and wine as well as desserts but we were all full so it will have to wait until next time.",

    "text": "Loved the burger! Definitely pretty pricey, but delicious. I got the Miyagi-san burger with wagyu beef. The beef patty was soooooo goooooood. Slightly sweet, definitely tasted the beef and the slight char flavor from the cooking process. The burgers took a while to come out, but I quickly forgot how long I've waited after eating the burger. I always love the fried egg in burgers. Makes a creamy consistency and texture to the burger itself. I didn't know how to eat it because of the onion rings in it. But that also gave it amazing flavor. It was my mistake, but I didn't know it didn't have any vegetables in it, which would balance out some of the strong salty/sweet/char broil flavor that was in the burger.  I wish I had gotten the oxtail fries because we got the salt/pepper garlic fries and they were perfectly fried. Soooo goood. It had garlic chili aioli that complemented well with the fries, but it didn't have enough garlic flavor (in either the fries or the sauce). Though, take the quality of the french fry and mix it with the oxtail and I think I would've enjoyed it soo much.  My friend got the Lonely Bird sandwich and it came with a herb pesto which I loved so much and took that for myself to put in my burger to give it some herb flavor. I wonder if I could get the herb pesto in my burger instead of the chili mayo that my Miyagi-san burger came with. Maybe that would have a better rounded out flavor.  LOVED this place still. Will want to come back for more!",

The staff are all very accommodating and professional. Service with a smile. Very chill vibe. Dim lighting. Good for a casual dinner or lunch. Just be sure to bring your appetite. The portions are very generous.  Ample parking and right next to the Regal theater for the dinner and a movie kinda of night out. Btw, Katherine is on of the nicest and sweetest servers I have ever met. Thank you!!!!!",

That being said, I'm a sucker for anything with foie gras and the shogun burger was no exception. The Wagyu patty was delicious, but I've had better hence my 4 star review instead of 5 stars. I'm guessing the beef quality of the wagyu was toward the lower side since I couldn't really taste the fat I would normally find in a beef known for its fat content and flavor. The preparation of the foie gras on the other hand was perfection. It melted over the patty like a piece of wilted cheese. A nice and surprising twist was the fruit had been smoked and had a flavor similar to char sui. Overall, This was a wonderful experience and I would order it again. On a side note this burger would best be ordered somewhere between medium rare and medium.",

I wasn't a fan of the oxtail chili cheese fries with fried egg. It was good but too much going on flavor wise.   If I were to come back again, I would come back for the ramen.

He walked in alone and had not seemed to had fusion burgers before she took the extra time out to explain everything to him and really went the extra mile.",

    "text": "Flavorful!! Oh So FLAVORFUL.  Sunday evening-- Arrived around 6:45PM. No reservations needed.. although the place started to get busier by 7:00PM and seems like Han (who was great) was serving upwards of 7 tables simultaneously.  Everything at Bachi Burger, this Asian fusion burger restaurant, has so much taste. We made the fortunate mistake of ordering too much food-- thus having lunch for the next day.  1. Crispin Blackberry Apple Cider- Delicious tasting juice alcohol.  2. Oxtail chili cheese fries- Fries are crispy and good. It's a huge plate-- heavy enough to be a meal in itself or shareable between 4 people. It tastes just like chili cheese fries with shredded beef rather than ground beef. I think I would've rather gotten the bone marrow because I wanted that unusual meaty taste.  3. Pork Belly Bao Buns- I wanted only 1 but ended up with 3 (due to my lack of ordering clarity). They were delicious. The bun is soft and the cole slaw cuts nicely into the overall taste.  4.Risotto Loco Moco- I ordered this expecting the typical patty (Bachi style) drenched in gravy and a light risotto. When I say their food has so much flavor-- this is what I'm talking about in particular. Their patty is deliciously charred with the sweet, signature Bachi Burger taste. The onions are plenty and a good supplement (although there were too many onions for my taste). The egg and the scallions were a good top off. I also liked the risotto--- but not with this dish. Since the patty and everything on top is super tasty.. the risotto (and its cheesiness) was too much and out of place. I would have preferred plain white rice with the meal. The risotto is great-- but perhaps pair it with another protein or one not marinated so heavily.  Had the opportunity to enter their Disneyland giveaway by posting a photo of my food on facebook. I'm definitely a fan and enjoy coming here every so often.",

It wasn't bad, but it was beef didn't taste like BEEF --it just took over the flavors of all the seasonings. It reminds me of when you get a slab of tofu and you just marinate it with a bunch of stuff till it loses it's original base flavor --yes I personally believe tofu has a flavor.  I think if this place ever wanted to go vegetarian they have a real shot!   I'm not impressed. The fries were okay and everything was just okay.

    "text": "We've eaten at Bachi plenty of times before however it was our first time in this location. Came here at 5.30pm on a weekday- we were hungry and it was quiet, so we thought we would have a great experience.   We ordered fries and two speciality burgers. The fries came and we didn't have any utensils or napkins until the main food which was kind of annoying because we had to ask for it.  The Spicy Miso burger did not come with peppers like it was supposed to nor the aioli sauce that we ordered extra on the side. When we told the server, he came back to apologize and said that the kitchen was \"out\" but \"they are cooking them right now.\" Fair enough. So we waited and the server brought WHOLE peppers to the table which SHOULD have been cut up inside the burger anyway, like it is on the menu. So we had to cut them up ourselves.   By far the worst experience we have ever had at Bachi. Service was horrible. Really disappointed as we work in the industry and were really looking forward to this date night on our day off. I was really upset when I left this place.",

    "text": "Not much more can be said about the amazing food you will experience at Bachi Burger when a restaurant has over 800 reviews already.  However I will chime in anyway with my own opinion.  This is definitely must try burger spot in Las Vegas.  Since its spotlight by Guy Fieri on Diners, Drive Ins, and Dives Bachi Burger has gained a national following.  I cannot wait to go back myself.    I had the MIYAGI-SAN on this visit and I surely was not disappointed.  From the sweet fresh baked bun to the perfectly cooked medium patty this burger was delicious.  I did not even ask for ketchup and mustard because that would just make it another burger.  I could go on and on about how good it was but I just recommend go and try one asap.    We also had the Organic Edamame with Garlic and Truffle oil and one again I needed no sauce to did the beans were just fantastic the way the chef prepared them.  The Truffle fries were also very tasty and the Sun Dried Tomato Aioli was a fine substitute for ketchup any day.     The No MEAT Burger was very flavorful.  The red bean mixed with other ingredients gave the patty a sweetness that was very tasty.  Finished with a slice of tofu over the top accompanied with mixed greens, red onion and tomato this burger looked like a masterpiece.  Overall we were very satisfied with our meal and we are eager to come back and explore the menu.  The service was friendly and attentive.  I did find it funny that when I called and inquired what they had for vegetarians, the response was \" We have a chicken burger and a fish burger\"??  Then when we visited the restaurant we asked to see the menu prior to seating and asked the same question, a different person responded with \"we have a fish burger and a chicken burger\"??  I was laughing on the inside and maybe a little on the outside thinking that vegetarians eat chicken and fish.  Oh well nothing that a good informative book and a little more training could not fix.  I chose not to dock Bachi Burger a star on the staffs absurd answers to my questions.",

    "text": "My love for Bachi Burger is for reals. The OG restaurant was so banging that they opened a second location on West Sahara. Now before you think it's going to be a quick commute from the strip, it's really not that close. It's nearly nine miles from the Palazzo hotel. That's a $30 one way cab ride. Unless you don't mind a $60 to and from taxi fare, then I would suggest you come here when you have your own ride. It's situated in the Village Square shopping area right next to the Regal movie theater. It is however closer to the strip then their other location which was closer to Henderson. So if I had to choose between the two, I'd probably come here. Plus this location has a lot more working space especially for our party of 10 on this particular night.  There's no doubt about it that when I think of Bachi Burger, I fantasize about their Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries $11.50. It's practically a must order and it's a great appetizer to share right out of the gates. Did I mention that is topped with a fried egg? That's how we Asians do it!  Although the Kalbi Burger $9.5 (angus beef, kalbi marinade, green onions, house made kimchi, ko chu jang mayo) is my original go to, I have found a new love. The Ronin Burger $10: angus beef, caramelized onions, Japanese cole slaw, miso goma dressing, fried egg, katsu bbq, and yuzu citrus aioli. I'd like to forewarn you that it may be a little on the sweet side but like the Kalbi Burger, it is dripping with greatness. Personally, both of these burgers are neck and neck and if I had to choose between the two, I'd rather rely on a flip of a coin to determine my fate.   I had their Kiki's Burger $10 on the most previous trip and although it is stacked with lots of awesome ingredients (angus beef, sauteed shiitake, enoki & eryngii mushrooms, caramelized bacon, sweet onion marmalade, ages gruyere cheese, and garlic chili aioli), it just didn't measure up to the other burgers I have mentioned. It's not bad but I probably won't order it again. The Banh-Mi Burger is probably my least favorite. I'd rather hit up Banh Mi Che Cali and get a real Vietnamese sandwich. It's a nice attempt but I'll pass.  There are a few other burgers on their menu that deserve a glance like Miyagi-san's Grass Fed Wagyu Burger. For you non beef types, they have a Crusty Crab burger, an Alaskan Cod burger, a ground chicken and turkey burger, and even a No Meat Here burger.   Bachi Burger is by far one of my favorite burger joints and this is coming from a guy who has cut back on consuming one of America's favorite bites. The food always seems fresh and full of rich ingredients. The acute tastes leave nothing but awesomeness on your taste buds. The great thing about the post meal is that you walk out satisfied and not overly stuffed or in a complete lethargic state of mind.  Until the next time we meet again Bachi Burger...I'll continue to miss you.",

They have all kinds of combinations to choose from. The burgers at Bachi are influenced by familiar and not so familiar, Asian and Hawaiian flavors. Burger like: \"Mr. Hos Burger\" (Angus Beef, Pork, Garlic, Ginger, Sauteed Mushrooms, Lup Cheong Sausage, Mizuna Lettuce, on a Taro Bun), \"Shogun Burger\" (Wagyu Beef, UNAGI!!! Foie Gras, Poached Asian Pear, Miso Butter, Yamamomo Peach) I mean c'mon!!  AND - I had a rare \"Spicy Miso Burger\" (Angus Beef, Onions, Shishito Pepper, Mayo, Lettuce, Roasted Garlic, Swiss Cheese, Fried Egg, Apple Vinaigrette) - and to say it was delicious is an understatement! To accompany my burger I order the Ox Tail Chili Cheese Fries - equally as awesome as the burger! The only problem is that its way too much for one person to eat!  I could really write on forever but I will spare you. The choices here are endless. creative burgers, Boba drinks, milkshakes, sodas (made in house), milk teas, coffees, micro-brews, and even SAKE.  Enough reading now go try it!",

I ordered the red sangria, a black and green burger, and salt & pepper garlic fries.  The sangria was good, the burger was alright, and something in the fries made me have a reaction that left my tongue tingling and a little swollen after the first couple so I ate no more of them.    Really the burger was not all that great with the meat actually being a bit on the tasteless side.  For $14 with no fries included I expected something really good and I just got \"meh\".  Service was also a little slow but not horribly so.  I probably will come back and try some of their non-burger items if I'm in the area again but it won't be soon since there are other restaurants I want to try.",

Today we tried the oxtail fries, pork belly buns and Miyagi San burger, and a tall glass of Sapporo.   The oxtail fries where good but a little more meat and chili don't hurt. The burger was go to hell and go to heaven at the same time. Juicy, plenty of flavor for all the extra stuff especially the crunching of the onion rings. The flavor profile of the burger or meat itself can't get it. You could taste the grass fed part if it was plain.  The pork belly buns melt in your mouth, the radish tasted as a lettuce. Why? I don't know but it work good all together. Overall was good and the service always on point. Well definitely come back and try a different burger for sure.",

    "text": "Hands down, my favorite burger in Vegas! I don't even go for the fusion burgers (which are incredible) but rather a purists' version. Wagyu beef with cheddar, lettuce, onion, tomato, and ketchup. Simple but sweet and a classic all the way! Why mess with perfection?  The burgers are always cooked on point here. I fluctuate between med rare and rare, and the fact that each time I switch it up and can tell the difference is a testament to the deft hands working the grill back there. The beef itself is pure, juicy, fatty indulgence. Add quality cheddar? A masterpiece. The buns here really set it over the top- a Taiwanese style sweetbread that's crunchy against the patty and veggies but supple on top, so that it melds itself around the rest of the burger.  If that's not enough to bring you in, the Bachi pickles should be. With a great variety of about 6, each made in house, it's such a great way to start- and end!- the meal, especially with its digestive properties. Crunchy sweet garlic, bracing daikon, vibrant radishes.. The rotation changes on any given day.  Out of all the fries, the salt and pepper are my favorite garnished with fresh leaves of cilantro, thinly sliced jalapenos and fried ginger. I love it with the Yuzu aioli.  Endless matcha iced green teas, a great beer selection, creative desserts- there isn't a reason for you not to drop by.",

The menu also seem to be more extensive with seasonal specials as well.  I've waited over an hour on the weekends at the Windmill site....which puts a downer on the eating experience.  Most of the burgers are $10-13 and I think a lot tastier than some pricier burgers you can get on the strip.  My all time favorite is the Miyagi-san burger with the wagyu beef, fried egg, onion rings, and furikake.  The flavor balance is perfect and the soft fluffy char siu bun completes the package.  I branched out this last visit and tried Mr. Ho's burger and I was pleasantly surprised by the taro bun which I like even more than the original bun they have.  However, I wasn't a big fan of the pork/beef combo and wish they had more lap cheong (Chinese sausage).  My favorite appetizer/side item is the oxtail chili fries that comes with a sunny side egg that you mix into the piping hot combination (big enough to share between 4 people).  I may forgo the Windmill site for the rest of my eating life now that I've discovered this location.",

I think we'd arrived at the time of their usual dinner rush because there were six other couples waiting to be seated along with us. But, it didn't take too long before we were brought to our table and attended to. The server we had was very attentive, and was always there to get things to our table and reassured us throughout the night that our order would be out.  At first glance when looking at the menu, the boyfriend and I were honestly pretty suspicious about burgers in the $7-10 range, considering we're very stingy people who aim for what we feel is a fair price. All he could say was, \"This better be worth it.\" And that it was. That it was.  I've always heard that Bachi is great for the Asian fusion. That's why I've wanted to come here for a while. I love burgers, but something different for a change has been on my mind for a while. And they really did it right.  Boyfriend got the Peanut Butter Milkshake to start, and it was heavenly. Do try it if you're craving for something sweet, especially if you're willing to spend the extra $5. It's worth it. He also got the Banh Mi Burger, which he says had lemongrass, pickled veggies, shrimp, pate, pork, etc. There was also a sauce that came with it that he enjoyed.  We both shared Truffle Fries and I LOVED it. I was curious enough to try the Ronin Burger, which has onions, japanese cole slaw, a fried egg, katsu bbq, among other things I missed, plus some interesting sauce on the side. Personally, I liked it the way it was without it.  Overall reaction? Dinner was a-ma-zing. I'm giving it five stars for outstanding quality, plus the fact that the burgers were great and were at a pretty good size for $9.50 (Banh-Mi) and $10 (Ronin). I'm very much able to overlook the fact that the kitchen was backed up when we were there and that we spent about 20-30 minutes of our time waiting. Those are things I can hardly blame anyway. Plus, the burgers really lived it up for me, and I'm itching to come back soon. $30 total for both of us for was not bad at all.  Next time, I'd love to try the Kiki and the Kalbi. :) And, I'm not a spicy food person but plenty of my friends have raved over the Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries, so I'll suck it up one of these days and give it a shot. Apparently, it's to die for, and I'm curious enough to try it.  Oh man, now I'm hungry for some Bachi.",

After everyone in our party was finished eating, they began to prepare my shake. Apparently they put an item on the menu that they don't have a clear process for delivering. As well the server did not ask if we wanted fries with our burgers. Considering how often they come as a set, they should remind the customer to order fries if they do not. Do eat here, the food is amazing. But do not be too patient if what you ordered does not arrive - if you don't insist, it may never.",

The kiki (mushroom) burger I had was very good and the Mr. Ho's burger I had a few bites of was also tasty. The strawberry lemonade was delicious, though I'm not sure why they can't just hook it up with at least one refill.  The main thing that detracted from the whole dining experience here was the service. There were a billion empty tables (I am exaggerating but there were a LOT), but we still had to wait 5-10 minutes even when there was nobody in those seats. Also, I felt like we were getting pushed out the whole time. We hadn't had a chance to look over the menus for more than 10 seconds when the waitress wanted our order. The bill also came without asking for it while we still had a third of our burgers left and the food was cleared away before we could tell them to stop. The timing of the service is just really off here.",

Never thought of using oxtails for the meat in chili, but why not? However, all in all, I will likely not return because the service was very, very slow. I couldn't understand why we had to wait 20 minutes (or longer) to be served the beer we ordered. The food started coming before we got our beer. Ridiculous!",

Some may think it's a little salty but I happen to be a salt fanatic so I thought it was perfect! We also got the garlic parmesan truffle fries.  And after devouring that, we had to try the oxtail chili cheese fries as its seems all of my fellow yelpers raved about those fries!  They were outstanding!  The only thing though is that I like my fries thicker.... the fries were skinny and thin - like McDonald's fries.  I prefer the crinkle fries or something at least that thick but nonetheless the flavors were still amazing!  The prices are somewhat high for burgers but that's because you're not just getting a burger. It really is a meal.  And this is not your typical burger joint - it is a restaurant.  So no it's not a counter where you order your burger and have your own tray and take it to go or sit inside.  It's a restaurant with a menu and servers....probably why it's a little more pricey as opposed to let's say In and Out. But if you like burgers, then you have to give Bachi Burger a try.",

The fries had the perfect amount of crispy and zing.  The second time I tried the oxtail chili fries and green and blue burger. I actually liked the Kiki's better.  I was sceptic about the oxtail fries.. But again so tasty.  Not skimpy on the chili at all and the fried egg added so much flavor on top of flavor.  The strawberry lemonade was sweet with a touch of lemon.  The plantation tea was so refreshing.  The sizes were perfect and didn't worry about not having free refills.  We will visit again!!",

I had wanted to try this place out after seeing it on the food network, especially since the oxtail chili fries were on there. I loved them, they were really delicious! I also shared a burger since I pretty much ate all the fries. I got the miyagi burger, and I really enjoyed the mixture of flavors and the burger was perfectly cooked. Try this place out! Service was really slow though when I was here, but the manager apologized and gave my friend and I two free drinks :)",

It had blue cheese and spinach anyway. Was very tasty. The bun was very soft and the meat melted in your mouth. Apparently my boyfriends burger was tasty too. We also had a side of Salt and Pepper Garlic fries. Very nice. Will try the oxtail ones next time - didn't want to order too much as on here, the burgers look HUGE, but in reality, they are just right, we both walked away feeling content-not too full and not still hungry, just comfortable. They also give military 10% off the bill. Will come here again to try some other options of food. Recommended.",

Well, seems I was wrong..  My girl and I decided that we were not that hungry, so we ordered a burger and a Dao (I think this is what they called it) sandwich to split. The Angus burger, the duck sandwich, calamari, and sangria. Only thing that I was actually impressed with was the Sangria. It rocked! It is a little pricey, a craft was $26, but was really good. So that was the highlight. Calamari was over cooked so it was like having gunny bears. The Angus burger was basted with a sweet sauce that wast my style at all. Almost like a white people BBQ sauce, you could taste the brown sugar. Now the mini duck sandwiches have potential. However, again it was so white it just wasn't right. Some spice would be nice! Flavor was okay but it was pretty blah and I would need $100 worth of them for a real meal. So, I guess I am headed back to Chinatown to savor some flavors.",

Burgers were great -- my girlfriend said it's the best she's ever had (although it's also the first time she'd ever tried wagyu beef).  I got the banh-mi burger, which has beef, pork and shrimp in it.  It was good; not amazing.  Couldn't taste the shrimp and that Asian pork flavor got old about halfway through, but no complaints about it otherwise.  The only downside was that service was slow.  We went there right when they opened and were the only ones there at first.  Our server was on-point until she got ONE more table, and then we never saw her (her tip reflected that fact).  On that basis, 3 stars instead of 4.  Still, on the basis of the food, would recommend visiting here if you happen to be in the area.",

This easily could be a meal for two people or 3. Size is meant to be shared. Delicious. Also had pork belly bao buns. Nice. Would have liked a little crispness to the meat, but still inhaled it all, because it's pork belly. Friend had lunch special: selection of app, entree, & dessert of the day. She had roasted Brussel sprouts, fish burger, and donuts.",

Beef is definitely higher quality than your average restaurant or steakhouse, and their creativity is admirable but two burgers with one order of fries should not come out to $40 with tip. Sorry guys but the high end burger joint is the answer to a question nobody is asking. Service was also just okay. Waited a few minutes for water, order was taken timely, but the food arrived about 10-15 minutes later. The restaurant was not packed. Just an okay burger with a high price tag. Not going back.",

I didn't think I'd care much about this place since there are many burger joints around the valley, but I was really impressed. We were seated shortly upon arrival and was given enough time to look over the menu. I ordered the Bachi Fish and my family's orders consisted of Kiki's Burgers, The Lonely Bird, No Meat Here... 'Burger', Kid's Grilled Cheese, Salt & Pepper Garlic Fries, and Truffle Parmesan Fries.  The Bachi Fish was reallllly gooood!! The bun was nice and soft and perfectly toasted. The veggies were fresh and crisp. The fish was a good amount and very tasty. The fries were very good as well, crispy and the seasonings and sauces complimented them very well. I think everyone with me enjoyed their food too because they cleared their plates!  Our server was friendly and attentive enough, answered our questions, and did her job with a smile. The looks of the restaurant was nice and welcoming.  Overall, I'd be back again to try other things on the menu.",

Now I have no excuse ;-)  So what happened here to make me so giddy about this place.....Well for starters they gave us these fried pillows of veggie goodness as a thank you for trying the new location :-) I love getting little free goodies to try, it just makes me feel loved;-) Then they gave my daughter who is 2yrs some things to play with since they saw she was getting squirrely...again another thing to make me feel loved :-) Those with toddlers know eating out can be a handfull sometimes and when you have a staff that cares about your experience they tend to help you out as much as possible. The waiter was on it with our beverages and making sure we are good yet not hovering over me like I'm his only table which I might have been because the place just opened so it wasn't very busy.   Now lets talk about the main reason why I wanted to come here...da foood! We ordered Oxtail fries for starters and boy you could easily share them with 4 people! My buddy and I had to stop ourselves from eating any more for fear of not being able to even start eating our burger :-/ I ordered the popular choice the Ronin and it lived up to the hype which was always good :-) My buddy got the Waygu Burger which was good but he liked my Ronin better and I ordered a Ban-mi slidder for my little girl and that was so scrumptious :-D   I can\"t wait to go back next time cause I'm thinking about the Ban-mi burger and a salted caramel marshmallow milkshake to top it all off ;-) Yippee for gym memberships and cheat days or else I would be screwed!!",

But, they did have a savory burger, which hit the spot! It's called the Black & Green Burger. I always like my burger prepared this way (smoky sharp cheese such as blue and gouda with some spring mix greens and vinaigrette).  Their appetizers are also very indulgent. My personal favorite is the truffle parmesan french fries. It tastes the same as the truffle parmesan fries at Eat Chow in Newport Beach, but I think it has a stronger flavor than Eat Chow. We also got their famous Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries. This is good if you like meat on the sweet side combined with your traditional chili cheese fries.  Overall, good burger place in Las Vegas if you're looking for burger places like the ones in LA.",

I thought it was great back then, it was even better the second time (much more oxtail meat this time around).  Crusty Crab - Yes, please, more.  I've had one burger here the last time - truffle burger?  I don't remember.  Either we added an egg or it came with it - either way, it was amazing.  I came here with my cousin, who is very much a fast food type of burger guy and he was seriously blown away.  Before I could even finish Instagramming my crab cake burger, he was 3/4 the way done with his burger.  Seriously - I can't imagine you could possibly go wrong with any burger on the menu.  It is seriously divine.  Service - top notch.  I came here on Thanksgiving weekend and it appeared to be really busy or just understaffed.  The food was seriously worth the wait and the staff was very very friendly and helpful.  They were not as attentive as I would have liked (which was completely understandable given their circumstance as previously mentioned), but if you are observant, you can see that they were absolutely trying their best and hardest to accommodate the demand.  Five stars for the pulling through and their efforts.  They kept their cool and didn't let it get to them.    I highly recommend this place and will definitely be coming back with more friends and family for delicious burger goodness.",

It's a tradition of ours to try calamari ( 9.50) anywhere we go and I will say it was good, a little oily for my taste but otherwise cooked beautifully and included tentacle pieces which is a must so points for including ! The burgers were beautiful and deliciously juicy everyone at the table was giddy at their yummy juicy burgers   I had high hopes for the truffle parmesean fries and I was so disapointed they were underseasoned and eventhough they had a bunch of stuff on them it was just a flat flavor profile. A suggestion if you get any of their speciality burgers don't add or take away anything including any sauces that come with and I say that because each burger are handcrafted and intended to have all the flavor components work together and if you don't you will miss out, so live outside the bun you won't be disappointed. The staff were impeccable, they were attentive without being annoying and answered any questions we had since this was our first trip. We will be back",

I had wanted the Mr. Ho's Burger but the server said that's a popular item and they were out of it at that time. - My friends enjoyed their Spicy Miso Burger (they split it), the Sweet Potato Fries and the Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries.  They graciously shared both types of fries with me and they were pretty good. - Service is quick and attentive.  I drink lots of free ice water and the servers refilled my glass about 6 times.",

When i went i really wasnt too thrilled about it. It was whatevers to me. I decided to give it a second try since my friend says its good and was surprised i didnt like it. This time it was what i expected! It was really good. That juicy, tender moist Asian flavored burger was bomb... It was called Spicy Miyo .. For apps we had the fried calamari with a side of their flavored sauces and jalapeno on it. Yumm!! For desert i had the Portuguese donuts .. Which was ok!the side of the coffee gelato was good. Deff will come back next time i crave something exotic.",

    "text": "Just like everyone else, my family and I came here because it was featured on Food Network.  I'm a huge fan of that channel and I wouldn't pass up trying something that Guy Fieri got to eat!  Of course because of this we had high expectations.  What do you expect?  First thing's first, this place was really crowded. There were limited seating in the waiting area and the wait was about 45 minutes.  Now I'm not going to tear this place a new one just because the wait was long and I can feel people practically breathing over my shoulder.  Food was really pricey however, they were delicious. We ordered the ribs as an appetizer and they were fall off the bone.  They used great sauce and plating was really nice.  Only downside is that the ribs were so tiny and for $9 it only came with 4. it was kind of ridiculous.  We each ordered a different burger and we all felt they were surprisingly good.  They were just so many flavors embedded into each burger, almost too many flavors, but it wasted great.    I also ordered the Almond Boba Milk Tea.  Worst decision I've made.  The boba was just disgusting.  It was so tasteless and I was tempted to ask them to strain it out, but that would be rude.  Every initial sip tasted good cause the milk tea wasnt bad, but after drinking the tea you're left with several balls of boba in your mouth that you're just chewing and chewing... and chewing... and chewing....  So far, food was definitely a 4 star or 4 and a half star range.  However....  The service was awful.  Just so terrible.  Service is what brings customers back.  Just because you're on Food Network and you get a continuous busy flow of customers does not mean you can completely disregard customer service.  After we were seated we were completely forgotten.  We were seated closest to the hostess and the front doors as well.  Our waitress was rude.  Her name was Claire.  She was extremely pushy when suggesting appetizers and she just sounded like she wasnt havin it.    If it wasnt for the tasty food, which sadly took an hour to get, I'd give this place a solid 2. Actually I'd give it a 1, but the hostess was nice.  She had to personally get our check for us because we were waiting for it for maybe 30 minutes after clearly finished eating, and then it took another 20 minutes for them to take the check away.  Near the end we were all simultaneously bashing the restaurant's service and it made us forget how good the food was entirely.  If its your first time, sure, try the food just to say you've tried this place.  We probably wont come again though, it isnt worth it.",

    "text": "Bachi Burger is at the top of my list of restaurants to visit when I come to Vegas.. and I'm in Vegas on business at least every other month! It has also been a sure win every time I bring friends and family here, to the point that they've all caught the bug and now make this a regular pit stop of their own as well. This place makes the big chef name franchise burger restaurants on the strip, look like a cheap novelty in comparison. (Big words, I know, but that's my sincere opinion.)  Customer service is consistently friendly and accommodating, but it seems they are on and off with under staffing, which leads to long waits if you are a needy customer. (Guilty, sorry in advance!)  I've only ever had to wait for a table less than a handful of times, and never more than 5-10 minutes even during their peak hours.  The ambience is lovely, in a clean environment and great location!  The food is extraordinarily PERFECT every time! -My go-to is the KiKi's Medium Wagyu Burger, add egg! Yummmm, Shitake AND Enoki Mushrooms, Crispy Bacon, Onion Marmalade, with a perfect juicy  burger and delicious Garlic Aoili sauce to match! -You really can't go wrong here.. Miyagi-San, Spicy Miso, Kalbi, Ronin, Shogun, Pork Belly Bao. It's seriously an All-Star menu! Each burger has something different to offer your lucky taste buds. -Ox Tail Fries, a self-explanatory MUST TRY! -Sweet Potato Fries are some of my favorite I've had anywhere. They're perfectly balanced with sweet and salty crunchiness, paired with my favorite Yuzu Sauce! -Their Crab Cakes are perfection! -During one of my visits, they were offering a mind-blowing special.. Baked Bone Marrow Jelly with Duck Butter. Holy umami! -I've had a handful of other unique appetizer specials from this place, and I can't remember them all. However, I do distinctly remember that each and every one of them has blown my socks off! -Last but not least... I'm always way too full to even look at the dessert menu by the end of the meal, but I can't believe I've been missing out this whole time. I've only recently had the chance to try the MATCHA TIRAMISU, and wow, just wow. It's different and delicious.  Basically, like everything else on the menu.",

I had to ask another employee to find out who is supposed to take our order. Another waitress, seemed a little pissed off, took out order. Turns out, it wasn't even supposed to be her. Hopefully no one spit in our food...   anyway, the food was delicious like always. My yuzu aioli had a discolored layer on top, but luckily the french fries came with a fresh aioli cup, so I used that one. Besides that, I took some first-time bachi burger people with me and they loved the food. Loved it to the point of overeating bc it tasted soo good.   I think I still prefer the one in Henderson better, but this branch is definitely larger. Will be returning... To the Henderson one most likely!",

I the Spicy Miso is hands down the best burger Ive had in Las Vegas since I started coming here for work every other week since April '13. Ive had at least one burger on each trip at a new place and Ive come back to only 2 places so far and this is one of them (The other is Hubert Keller's Burger Bar for his namesake burger, also incredible). If you can get yourself off the strip, the burger is worth it. The only reason I give it 4 stars is the service leaves something to be desired. Very rushed and both times way understaffed. Not unfriendly, but just not at the level it should be for a sit down burger joint of this caliber.",

No big deal just bring it. I felt like it was a chore for them to bring us extra napkins and refills on the coffee. I will not go back to this location. The original location will get our business even though it is farther away.",

The waitstaff was on top of their game and even as the place filled up the waiters managed to make sure our glasses were full and we had what we needed. As with other trips we ordered the oxtail fries which are one of my favorite things on the planet. This time they were a bit underwhelming but still good. We also ordered the duck steamed buns which were cold when they arrived but still good, particularly the dipping sauce. We split a Kiki burger which was very good but not nearly as good as blue and green. Maybe we were there on an off night but the food was just mediocre and when you are paying $60 for two appetizers, one burger and two domestic beers you expect excellence.",

The only thing that wasn't that great were the prices, my burger was $14, just for the burger, the fries are separate ($4.50), but whatever I didn't wanna just go to McDonalds, and Bachi uses grass-fed beef, so I'm not mad!! :) It wasn't that busy in there on a Sunday and the service was good, they got you on the water refills, your glass will never be empty!

Other than those things. This place is good if you want a twist on the original burger. Little pricey if you ask me. Fries don't even come with the meal. Service is good and I would come back.

There were so many choices on the menu i wanted to try a lot fo them.  I don't live near one so I can only get it in Vegas, for now so I wanted to pick the right burger.  Unfortunately this may not be a place I would go to because there are other places I rather go to when i am in town. The onion rings and fries were pretty good.  The aioli sauce is delicious.  I saw the ox tail chili fries It looked pretty big as you see in the photos but not worth the 12.00 to me.  If you want to get something juicy and favorable try their burgers.  I ordered the hamburger medium.  It was perfect..  My friend likes the Kalbi burger but you will have to like kim Chee because that takes over the burger (my friend got the kim chee on the side).  It is not that spicy according to my friend who does not like spicy food.  I didnt go with her so I didnt get to taste it.  We went there the next day I shared my burger with my husband it was filling for us.   I got the Ronin Burger and it was yu,mmy.   My son enjoyed his meal and plans to go back.  I think he will try the kiki burger the next time.  A good hamburger place with good service.  It took a little long but it is made fresh.",

    "text": "After hearing and reading so many good reviews of this place, I had to give it a try. Unfortunately, I was disappointed.   I'll start with the good: -They have a good variety of burgers and they are big enough to split if you are planning on having sides as well. (note: you have to order the sides separately)  -I split the meatless burger which was pretty good. I could have done without the huge piece of fried tofu that was layered on top. -The onion rings are SO good. Definitely order a side. They are sliced thin and have a nice crisp.  Here's the bad: -The truffle fries were soggy...would not recommend  -The kids menu is limited to 2 things: a $9 kids burger and an $8 \"grilled cheese\" which was basically a hamburger bun with melted cheese. My kid took one bite and put it down. The kid's burger was burned on the outside and pink on the inside but my other kid liked it anyway.  -They don't have any pickles! They do offer a funky mix of pickled vegetables but it just didn't taste quite right. -It's a bit on the pricey side for a not so classy joint.  The ugly: The service was pretty bad. The waitstaff was very awkward and so was the manager. Not personable AT ALL. Absolutely no personalities. I paid attention and not one person on the staff that interacted with our table smiled...not once. I was with a group of 4 other women and 2 very well behaved kids. They looked depressed and annoyed half the time. When I told the manager that they should make it more clear that the kid's grilled cheese is not traditional and is on a thick bun he just looked at me with a straight face and said \"okay\". He wasn't necessarily rude...just so bland. The hostess that sat us needed to brush her hair...she looked like she just rolled out of bed. She wouldn't even make eye contact.  I could go on and on but the bottom line is that your food can be amazing but, if the service stinks, you won't want to go back for seconds.  (This may have been an off day for this place. The other reviews seem to be very good. Whatever the case, it wasn't an experience I'd want to pay for again. There are plenty of other burger joints in the sea!)",

Well, that moment arrived, when one of our friends said he wanted a really good burger not on The Strip.    We ventured off The Strip... I'm telling you this is way off The Strip.  If you have heard of the LV residential area, Summerlin, it's in that neighborhood.  The trip there didn't start off well... 1)  We went the wrong direction on Sahara.  2) We were crunched on time... my boyfriend and I were leaving Vegas that night.  3) We were all hungry and wanting the burger!  We finally made it there.  It's shares the parking lot with many other businesses like a movie theater.  When we entered there were many empty tables... it was a Monday.  We looked over the menu, since there was four of us we were thinking to get four different burgers to try a little of everything.  Sorry I put a crack in that plan because they wanted one with blue cheese... I don't like blue cheese.  So we just ordered what we wanted... the guys ordered the Miyagi-san's Grass Fed Wagyu Burger, my friend choose the Black & Green Wagyu Burger, and I choose the Kiki's Burger (According to the server, this is one of the most popular burgers).  My burger was okay, I wish I had ordered one with the Wagyu just because the quality and taste of the beef is soooo much better than the Angus.  I think the next time I go, it will be the Miyagi-san burger for me.  We also ordered the ox-tail chili cheese fries.  I think they were okay, personally I don't like cilantro and beans, which they have to the chili.  I think the flavor of the chili was good with the cheese and surprisingly the fried egg on top.  Personally, I wouldn't order it again, unless someone else wanted it.  Overall, service was good.  Nothing to complain about.  A point of advice is... if you like your burgers well done... do not order the Wagyu, it will just throw off the texture of the beef.  As your server will advise, as did our server. This is definitely a place to try if you're in Vegas!",

    "text": "My friends and I went to this location because the original one had a broken air conditioner and said they couldn't accommodate our large party.  We came here and waited a ridiculously long time considering the restaurant wasn't even at  full capacity.   They were definitely short staffed and adding in the 115 degree heat outside, our party was not in the best of moods.  Anyhow, when we were seated, we ordered the oxtail fries, the kiki burger, the ronin burger, and a strawberry guava smoothie.  The quality of the food was exceptional just like the other location.  The bread of the burger is buttery and soft.  The meat is tender and juicy...the best I've had in my opinion, and the oxtail fries were delicious.  For the price ~$11, it was a fair deal.  Its definitely a must go if you've never had a gourmet burger.  It will for sure be one of the best hamburgers you've ever had.  The only reason I gave a 4 star was because the service was disappointingly slow and the waiters were a bit sweaty while they ran around.  I didn't want to see that right before I ate my food.  To be fair, it was a hell on earth because of the temperature but I think the business should hire more staff, especially on friday  nights during peak dinner hours.",

    "text": "Awwwwwfuuulllllyy sloooooow service!!!  We arrived today (on a Sunday) and were greeted by a very minimal ambience. The restaurant was nearly empty and we were told there was a 15-20minute wait...hmmm.   We decided to wait because we didn't believe it would be a 15-20 minute wait..we were wrong! We waited 20 minutes to be seated at a table that was opened the whole time we were there!!!!!!   I ordered the custom made BBQ burger. I added Shishito peppers, avocado, and point Reyes blue cheese.  Our waitress wanted to up sale us on everything! It was soo annoying!  Fries are extra which made me upset because I love fries with my burger...i got them anyways.    My brother ordered the onion rings. They were good I liked the Asian flare to them but the taste reminded me too much of Funyuns.    45 minutes after ordering, our burgers finally arrived. They were not worth the 45 minute wait! Everyone at our table ordered our meat to be medium well and 3 out of the 4 burgers were rare!!!! I couldn't even eat mine because it was sooo chewy, gross. The fries were not worth the extra $3.50.    I was disappointed how expensive everything was. And how additional toppings, fries, and so on are extra. And the slow service was insane!!! We had to give our card to another waitress because ours was off in her own world.    I can't say I will be back...ever.  There's too many affordable, better quality and places with way better service out there.",

    "text": "I try to eat off the strip as much as possible when rolling out to vegas so I had to give Bachi Burger a try.  The Sahara location is in a plaza with a movie theater and other restaurants.  On the particular day I was dining, the weather in Vegas was extremely hot and it felt really warm in the restaurant as well.  The thought of eating greasy burgers and fries and sitting in the heat wasn't so pleasant but nonetheless we had arrived already and extremely famished from partying the night before!  My friends and I shared some oxtail chili cheese fries and they were really good!  I loved the fried egg on top with the oozing yolk, yum!  We ordered some onion rings and they were very average, kind of bland to be honest.  I ordered the Miyagi san burger it was good but nothing mind blowing.  I always compare burgers to the likes of Umami burger and father's office. Bachi's came a little bit short.  My patty was requested at medium but came out extremely well done and charred.    It wasn't particularly busy for lunch so I'm not sure what happened.  I also thought my burger was a little bit bland.  It was pretty juicy but just lacked a bit of seasoning.  The portion size is large enough to fill you up for sure.  When Bachi opens up in LA, i'd definitely give this chain another shot. 3.5 stars",

It's not too sweet and just right!  2) Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries 2.5/5- It was heavy, I was expecting more savory and salty but this dish is on the sweeter side (probably because of the Asian fusion). With it being sweet and heavy, it made it very difficult for me to enjoy this dish. Half way finishing this plate, the rest of the fries were soaked in this sauce and I could not bare to eat anymore of it.  3) Pork Belly Steamed buns 4/5- It was my favorite thing here! The pork belly was juicy and flavorful, the sauce it came with is just right for it.  4) The Bachi Burger 4/5- Pretty delicious especially if you like kim chi. I was scared that there might be too much going on but I was wrong. Everything complemented each other well. I kind of wish my burger was a little more juicier. I ordered a medium but felt like it was on the borderline of a medium well.  Overall, this place is okay. Almost all items have some sweetness to it and it's probably because of the Asian infused flavors. I think some of plates were too complicated and involved too many ingredients/toppings. Sometimes simplicity is good.",

The bun was thick and didn't compliment or add to the taste of the burger at all. The carmelized bacon was good, but I couldn't taste it much on the burger, unfortunately. I wanted it to be awesome, but was a little disappointed.  That said, the service was good and I do wish I could give them 3.5. Maybe I'm being too harsh and they deserve 4? It's just hard when I read the reviews and expected them to be like Bareburger in NYC, and they were not, even though their prices are laid out the same way and they don't have fries come with their burgers.  I'll have to go back and try something people recommended on here so I can make a bit of a better assessment. But for now, this is what I have to say.",

    "text": "Dear Bachi Burger,  I cannot wait to go back to Las Vegas just to have your savory burgers in my mouth.  I would love to try your Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries, Banh Mi Burger, Miyagi-san's Grass Fed Wagyu Burger, Spicy Miso Burger, and The Crusty Crab.  So basically the entire menu....  I wasn't able to experience the feel of the restaurant since I was sitting in the hotel room aching with tremendous pain, but luckily my best friend (Erica) and her boyfriend (Son) brought back the Pork Belly Steamed Buns as well as the Kalbi Burger.  That initial bite into the Kalbi Burger helped temporarily alleviate the sharp feeling in my leg.  And let me tell you, nothing could really get my mind off of it, so that means a lot.  What I loved about this burger was that it came with a side of Korean-styled, spicy red-pepper cucumbers also known as oh ee ji (Korean) or liang ban huang gua (Chinese) which is my absolute favorite Korean side dish of all time.  Their menu has Bachi Pickles but I'm unaware if they are referring to the cucumbers as described above. On the inside, the Kalbi Burger is light pink with juices oozing after each bite.  It has a thin crispy, brown layer from the sweet kalbi marinade and has kimchi, ko chu jang mayo, and green onions for added flavor.  Wasn't able to get a snapshot of the burger since it disappeared before I could get my camera.  Yeah, it was that good.  Love Korean food?  You'll love the Kalbi Burger.  Bachi Burgers' Pork Belly Steamed Buns were equally delicious!  These Vietnamese-inspired pork buns consisted of pork belly, hoisin, scallions, cilantro, Chinese black vinaigrette, and a boiled egg (which was excluded in our order).  I just remember the pork fat melting while the soft puffiness of the buns filled my mouth with the saltiness of the hoisin and the distinct taste of cilantro.  Bachi Burger is known for their creative Asian fusion burgers, but this wasn't necessarily the first time I've had something like the Pork Belly Steamed Buns.  Can't remember where else I've had this dish, but its still a must-have especially if you would like order it as an appetizer and share with other people since they are bite-sized and comes in an order of three.  Thank you to both Son and Erica for introducing me to Bachi Burger, my new favorite, creative burger joint of all time.  Lina Chen",

Like usual, Guy was on point in his decision to visit this restaurant. Bachi Burger has so many burger and other food options available. I got Kiki's burger and I have to say I eat a lot of burgers and this is a top 3 burger of all time for me. It was cooked perfectly (mushrooms galore and beautiful carmelized onions) and assembled so well that nothing fell off the burger or out of the bun. I also had the oxtail fries, which melted in my mouth. Oxtail needs to be cooked for a very long time or in a pressure cooker and Bachi does it right. I love how the fuse together food genres like Hawaiian and American, Jamaican and Asian. I cannot wait to try another burger. They will not disappoint. Overall, service is fast with a Nice wait staff. Prices are a little above average but these burgers are gourmet. I only have one issue with the restaurant. While there is a kids menu, it won't satisfy all kids. Burgers with fried eggs are more upscale and may be too eclectic for some kids and adults. In total, 4.5/5 stars. (Wish there was a half star button.) I will definitely be back.",

Nice appetizers, especially the oxtail chili cheese fries and the sausages. The pork belly steamed buns are like sliders so they're also a good appetizer for three.  Amazing burgers. You can get a standard burger on bun with lettuce and tomato if that's all you want, and I'm sure it'd be great. But this is a place to have fun pushing your culinary boundaries. The specialty burgers here are amazing so be adventurous! At least try the Black & Green Burger. I love the Ronin Burger and the Miyagi-san's Burger.",

    "text": "Bachi Burger is pretty damn good. It is hyped up beyond belief, and some of that hype is definitely warranted. I'll get out the few negative things right off the bat. This place doesn't do reservations. There is always a wait because they don't seat you regardless of the vast amount of empty tables in the restaurant. My hunch is that because they take a while to prepare your food, they don't want to seat everyone at once so that it seems like you're waiting forever for your food. So this way you wait forever in the little waiting area up front before waiting a good while for the food once you order. The food is cooked pretty inconsistently. It's a crap shoot whether or not your burger gets under or overcooked. Also, the food is a little on the pricey side, $14 is one of the cheaper options on the menu for what amounts to a cheeseburger with no sides. I really don't mind it, but I can definitely see some people taking issue with that.   Now onto the good stuff. The burgers are really damn good here. The buns they put these on are ridiculously good too! I would love to eat everything on those sweet, soft, buns if it were possible. You can tell the ingredients are all quality and you do get a good sized burger. You can easily leave here stuffed. They have tons of unique signature burgers, along with many ways to customize them. They even have options for non beef lovers. I have opted for the Miyagi Son each time. It's a Wagyu burger that has fried egg, crispy onion rings, and a chili mayo and caramelized bacon that I usually opt out of. But if you like those, then definitely leave em on. I also tried a friend's sandwich. It was basically like their BBQ ribs thinly sliced on a bun. But the meat was delicious. We tried their Chili Fried Chicken appetizer, it was also really good. It's basically chili boneless wings. Nothing too spicy, but they had a good flavor nonetheless. Also, the truffle parmesan fries are pretty on point. But do you want to know my favorite thing about Bachi Burger, like the thing that fills my dreams most nights and always put a smile on my face when I think about it???  Well I'll tell you anyway... It's that insaaaane Salted Caramel Toasted Marshmallow Milkshake. That was the most amazing milkshake I have had in my entire milk shake drinking life. Whatever black magic is used to make that thing so incredible, it is well worth the ridiculous amount of calories it most definitely has. Try it and then thank me later. And nothing says thank you quite like a Salted Caramel Toasted Marshmallow Milkshake. ;P",

    "text": "If I didn't have to wait for a table for two for 15 minutes this place would have got a 5 star review, but unfortunately that wasn't the case. I came with one friend and waited 10-15 minutes for a table in a somewhat empty restaurant all because they were understaffed. Luckily the burger surpassed my expectations and that one star will be docked until the next time.   I ordered the salt and pepper fries, the spicy miso burger, and I tried a bit of my friends' Kiki's burger. It was hard settling on a burger choice because every combo looked so damn interesting. After reading Yelp recommendations for the spicy miso burger I finally decided on it and boy was that a GREAT choice.   First bite in and I tasted a crunch and then a parade of asian flavors dancing around in my mouth. From the potent ginger and soy sauce aroma in the restaurant I assumed that the burger would have the same pungent asian flavors. I asked for my burger to be medium well and it came out perfectly cooked, same with my friends' burger (which rarely ever happens, pun intended). I wish there was a way to explain how great the flavor pairings were but it is something you need to experience first hand.   The size of the burger was perfect, not too filling and worth all 10 of my money. I love having some type of carby side dish and even though oxtail fries were a highly recommended menu item I sprung for the salt and pepper fries. You would assume from the title that they would be just that, but their was a kick of jalapeno, some cilantro, garlic, but the True taste changer was the maui onion sea salt, it was perfect with the aioli served with the fries.   I am definitely going to come back on my next Vegas trip, even though it is a far ways away from the strip (I don't mind traveling for food though).",

    "text": "First time here this past weekend! I'm a True burger fan, I love Slaters, the Counter, and many other places, but this place definitely makes my top 2. I have never had trouble picking out what I wanted while ordering because every burger on their menu sounded so good... Definitely a new experience because this restaurant is Asian fusion and what a great idea it is... a chinese burger. lol   First off, Garlic. Parmesan. Truffle FRIES. Best one I've had yet. The truffle oil/sauce they sprinkle over the fries are just so delicious.. and the tomato dipping sauce? Damn. I also wanted to get the oxtail fries.. but I think I would've exploded or something.. I pretty much breathed the truffle fries in, cause it was so good lol I ordered the Black & Greens burger with wagyu beef (grass fed beef) and it was definitely a noticeably good quality beef. And the way they marinated brought out so much (asian) flavor on top of the caramelized onions and mushrooms.. I could barely finish it cause how filling it was (I also blame the fries). My gf got the Miso burger I think and it tasted more like a Korean burger lol very sweet and spicy, super flavorful. (I preferred my burger more lol)  We came to this location cause it's less packed, yes it's farther but it was worth the 0 minute wait. and very spacious seating and parking outside too!",

Maybe I'm one to expect more at a seated burger joint, but it didn't meet my expectations. The service was slow, the burger was okay but nothing I'd come back for again. The plus--two years ago I commented on the original location that the patty was the consistency of baby food and that is no longer the case. I was shocked to find that the wagyu patty is glazed in a sauce.  Why?  If I pay that much for a burger, I want to taste the meat.  The miyagi burger had tempura onions piled a few inches high under the bun, a fired egg, bacon, the glaze and their other sauce. It killed whatever taste I should have experienced from wagyu beef.   I'll come back in another year or so and see what they come up with next. I guess I'm too much of a burger simpleton to truly appreciate the trendy thing they have going.",

    "text": "Came with the BF and Angela H. for lunch. I went to the OG location quite a while back and liked it, but it is just out of the way for us.    The BF and I went to a place with the name burger in it, and didn't get burgers. Hah.   We shared two items that I believe are new to the menu:   Fish and Chips - these were pretty good. I don't know what kind of fish was used but it seemed denser of a fish than what is in usual and they batter it with a shiso leaf. The tartar sauce had nice zest to it. The chips are their usual fries which is a bit skinny and not the thick kind of British chips.   Lobster roll - the lobster salad had some curry flavor to it and was really a great twist! They serve it on a bahn mi like baguette which was decent, but like some other reviewer said previously, they were hoping for the same soft buns used with the burger and I agree that would be aces. I'm just used to lobster rolls don't go in crunchy rolls but soft buttery ones. These come with \"root chips\" which remind me of those Terra chips.   Salt and Pepper Fries for the table - these were nice. it had jalapenos in it and the seasoning I can't quite place that added more spice to the fries and the chili aioli was nice. I liked these and ended up polishing off the rest instead of my chips.   Angela got a Lonely Bird which she reported was good, though the onion strings were a tad salty.    Also a plus is the matcha iced tea! I love tea but sometimes I get tired of the standard ice tea offered at most places. Other than the green, there were a few other tea flavors that I don't think is refillable. I'm a beer person and it is definitely nice to see some respectable craft beer choices.   Service was pretty decent and filled my drink a few times, but just fairly standard.   Bachi is definitely a welcomed addition to the West and I definitely come back for other offerings.",

    "text": "Just tried Bachi Burger with a friend.   Short - creative Asian fusion burgers that taste great but leave your wallet a bit lighter than you would expect.  We started with pork belly steamed buns  (bao). They were very tasty, but the pork belly was a bit tough and didn't have a crisp sear on it. The addition of soft boiled egg slice was a nice touch and the flavors were good.  For our mains we ordered the Kiki burger with waygu and the Bahn-mi burger plus a side of sweet potato fries.  Both burgers were excellent but the Bahn-mi burger was the star. It's a beef, pork and shrimp patty that comes on a bun stuffed with Vietnamese herbs and a side of fish sauce for dipping, really unique and super tasty.  The sweet potato fries were a bit soggy. It's nice to see they are cut fresh in house,  but they need to be a bit thinner or dusted in starch to get crispy. I wouldn't recommend them.   We followed up with Portuguese donuts and Coconut panna cotta for dessert.  The donuts were good, although nothing special.  The coconut panna cotta desert special was not good, it just tasted bland. There was a blueberry coulis on the plate that was delicious, but it was such a small amount that it was gone after the first bite.  The prices here seem high relative to what they are serving. The $16 burger turns into $21 when you add fries for example. Watch what you order as the prices will add up fast.  Overall this is a fun and original upscale burger place that you should definitely try at least once, but the prices may be prohibitive for most locals to make this a regular spot.   There's very little value for your money to be had here, despite the dishes being hit or miss.",

    "text": "I usually love Bachi Burger. I first turned my parents onto this place and now whenever I'm in town we try to go there. So I was super excited to learn that they opened one in Summerlin's Village shopping center!  Here's the thing, overall the food was good but the service was terrible. Our server (I think her name is Erica) was just rotten. From minute one she was miserable and started to make us feel bad for wanting to eat at this restaurant. Why????  She was training someone and I think he felt bad because he kept coming over separately to make sure we were ok.   So for the food, we started with the garlic edamame which you can skip. They are sauteed instead of steamed and not that great and the garlic aftermath just ain't worth it for that one. My parents got the duck bao and said it wasn't great but they loved their Kiki burger. I got the lonely bird which was awesome as usual. The truffle fries were delicious as were their sweet potato fries, but I liked them better with a side of honey (just my personal preference).   So if we decide to have Bachi burger again, I'll probably hope that we go back to the Henderson location instead for the better experience. And Erica, if you are reading this, I'm sorry for calling you out, but I hope you find a job that makes you happy, but Bachi burger just ain't it!  P.S. I can't wait for the one in west LA to open- so excited!",

    "text": "Items selected:  Foie Gras, Apple/Celery/Cranberry Salad, Duck-Cherry Fritter Chili Fried Chicken, Ginger, Garlic, Shoyu Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries - Garlic Aioli, Fried Egg Salted Caramel Marshmallow Shake Peking Style Duck Bao - Cilantro, Scallion, Radish, Boiled Egg, Black Vinaigrette, Hoisin BBQ Kiki's Burger - Angus, Sauteed Shiitake, Enoki, Eryngii Mushrooms, Caramelized Bacon, Sweet Onion Marmalade, Aged Gruyere Portuguese Donuts with Coffee Gelato  Generally eschewing ground meats it was for myself something beyond Angus, Kobe and Wagyu that brought me to the Summerlin location of local darling Bachi Burger on Sunday, though I will say from the start that the \"Kiki's Burger\" ordered by my mother was potentially the best dish in an afternoon where only a single dish failed to impress despite the best efforts of our server to misinterpret the phrase \"please course things out and do not bring everything at once.\"  A surprisingly large space featuring slick woods and polished surfaces throughout it was just after 3:00pm when we arrived for late lunch/early dinner and selecting widely from the menu inclusive of a $15 foie gras appetizer it was with the hunger derived from nearly 8 hours of unpacking that we waited, only to have every single plate arrive simultaneously thirty minutes later resulting in both an overloaded table and tough choices about what would taste best at room temperature or below.  Focusing on the food it should be noted that much of what was ordered actually came to the table exceptionally well prepared and beginning with the foie gras I was immediately impressed by the quality and presentation, a single vein the only flaw in an otherwise Robuchon-quality prep featuring a caramelized medallion alongside a semi-sweet salad plus creamy, rich croquette and moving next to crispy, complex chicken alongside the equally crisp but decidedly spicy fries it was with good fortune that the milk shake, albeit small, was present to quell the heat.  Overlooking the spongy, dense bao and tepid duck entirely lacking for crisp skin and instead assisting my mother with the lightly charred burger topped with woodsy mushrooms and aromatic marmalade it was perhaps with recollections of the zeppole at Settebello the day prior that I ordered the doughnuts and although not quite as impressive, the eggy brioche stood strong beneath a dense lacquer of sugar rounding out a fairly impressive afternoon largely warranting the $75 tab, if not a significant tip.",

The waiters are very unexperienced; forget orders and not attentive. After ordering our food, we got our drinks and did not get our food until an hour and a half later. Geees! Our guest were beginning to complain from hunger. I asked for the Manager and a guy with dirty finger nails and t-shirt said he was the supervisor. I told him our issue and asked if he can compliment us with any appetizers in the mean time while we wait for our food because everyone was hungry and he said that 10% of the check is all he can do. We were so disappointed. I suggest getting some experienced staff.",

I went straight at the kalbi burger and ronin burger which are both magnificent creations that contain dope sauce like gochujang mayo and citrus yuzu aioli. The buns were reminiscent of the golden shiny bbq pork buns you get at dim sum. We also ordered up salt and pepper fries topped with garlic and jalapenos and truffle fries covered with black truffle porcini cream, both solid accompaniments. To wash it all down i opted for the hitachino ipa and the hitachino ginger brew which may be one of the greatest beverages ive ever put in my body. My mission in life from this day forth will be to destroy the remaining burgers on the menu.",

I needed a protein so I went with the waiters recommendation of adding cod.  While the salad was good individually, the fish was overpowered by a sweet teriyaki marinade.  In turn, overpowering the entire salad.  I also ordered a passion fruit boba tea being a fan of boba teas.  I wasn't expecting it to be milk-based so unfortunately this missed the spot too.  Our table did have some fries that we shared and those were good.  The service and atmosphere are good too.  Take this review for what it is... I look forward to coming back again in future for another try.  However, ordering a burger next time.  (I'll update my review again then)",

The food tasted good, but the prices are a bit steep. I order a burger that was $12. It was very good, but it was also (almost) the cheapest. There were $18 burgers all over the menu. That's a bit steep for me and it didn't even include a side of fries or anything. The burgers were a decent size, but no one in my party of 4 had any leftovers, including my 9 year old sister. So obviously they weren't huge entrees for the price. And speaking of kids, the kids menu consisted of 2 items: an $8 grilled cheese and a $10 burger. My little sister ended up just ordering an adult $11 burger and added avocado (+$1.50). There were plenty of burger options that sounded amazing, but I just couldn't bring myself to pay $18 for a casual restaurant burger. So overall, the food was very good, but I don't see myself going very often because I personally don't like spending $15-20 for a burger. But if you don't mind the pricing, I have no complaints about the flavor of the food.",

I eat my burger, which was delicious. However I get my check to find I in fact did order fries and they never were brought out. I showed the waitress and she apologized. She offered to get a refund for the fries or to get them to go.. I replied no due to already being 40 minutes or so into my lunch here. It came to $20 for my burger and water.

It's pretty sad being a certified chef & having the manager tell me that it doesn't matter on the cooking temperature that you'll still receive it. If you order a medium rare burger it should be the first one done, not 45 minutes later from a burger that we received that was medium well. So please tell me why his excuse was \"my dad ordered separate\" but he was the one who had ordered first out of the 9 of us. But the manager I believe Mike did everything he could to make my dad happy which was great. Hopefully when my dad comes back from Hawaii we will take him again.

    "text": "My boyfriend and I have heard a lot of people talk about Bachi Burger. We are always looking for a new place to try out. I guess you can say that finding new places to eat is our common interest. Bachi Burger is a burger restaurant with an Asian fusion taste. They offer all the milk shakes burgers (of course) sandwiches and also salads all with an Asian spin to it. Once I found out about this place I had to find out a little more.  I went onto their website and I must say that it was horrible. I don't know if their web designer decided to stop working on it or maybe they don't know about this issue. The web page does nothing but play music. You are unable to enter anything on their web page. I wasn't able to look at their menu, but we still decided to try it out.  Once we got to the restaurant (Sahara location) there hostess was a young lady who seemed to enjoy her job. She sat us down right away; a man gave us a glass of water but didn't say much, which made it a little weird. Finally after waiting, which wasn't very long by the way, our waiter came to get our drink order. She was very friendly but never introduced herself, which to me I like to know who I'm speaking too. Everything was great food was amazing and the meat was cooked just who we order it, a lot of places don't cook the burger just right. Our waiter came around and checked on us, and always kept our drinks full. When we got our check, we were never told that the lemonade that my boyfriend orders was not free refills, or else when she came around to refill we would have thought twice about or intake on the beverages.  We got charged for 2 lemonades at $4.50 each almost $10 for lemonade that's a little crazy if you ask me. Over all everything was great.  I would recommend this place to all my friends and family, they have a great staff that is friendly and honestly one of the best burgers I have had. Just make sure that you see if your drinks are free refills or not, most other places let you know if there is a charge for another drink.",

    "text": "I soooo wanted to love this place.  I still haven't found a place I'd like to regular in Summerlin;(  We arrived around 7:30 pm on a Thursday, there was a lively crowd...maybe about 20 people.  It only took a moment to be acknowledged and then seated by the hostess.  For some odd reason, the hostess seated us  at the least desirable table (nearest to the restrooms) although there were plenty of open tables.  The restrooms were not separated by a door or curtain from the dining hall.  So my husband (the polite gentlemen he is) sat in the seat that looked into the restroom hallway. Anyway, we did ask to move, which our waitress happily obliged.    We ordered our drinks.  Plenty of beers and signature Saki cocktails, but only a few wines by the glass, but in their defense that had atleast one of each of the most popular varietals (e.g one chard, one pinot grigio, one cab, one merlot, one zin, and one pinot noir).  The waitress took our order as soon as we came back with our drinks, because we were ready.  While I didn't see it on the menu, but saw it on their website, I asked her if they had the Shogun burger (which was my main draw to this restaurant), she said they don't serve it at the Summerlin location.  Bummer.  I had to pick an alternative...more on that later.  Between ordering our drinks and our meal, we had a chance to look around and observe the atmosphere. The scene is young, hip, kind of alternative, yet still had a bit of that \"Chinese restaurant\" look due to the chairs.  Not tacky by any means, but did take it down a notch.  I appreciated that the restaurant attempts to support its local roots by hanging art by local artist that can be purchased and also being mindful of the environment by sending their compostable waste to Cowboy Trail Farms for reuse.   I did think it was a little too much to be showing Food Network on one TV and The Cooking Channel on the other TV...I suppose it could be a good plug for them if DDD comes on, but then again the dinners already know about this place;)  Our order came in a timely manner. We shared an order of the salt and pepper garlic fries, my husband got the Miso burger and I got a bunless Kiki burger.   We expected the fries to be thicker cut, but they were shoe strings garnished with salt, pepper, jalapenos and cilantro with a side of garlic aioli. They were tasty, especially with the sauce.  The first thing we noticed that the burgers were appetizingly big, which justified the price, even making it seem like a value.   We took our first bites, we both thought they were overly sweet.  While I understand the presence of all flavors, we thought there was an imbalance towards sweetness coming from the burgers being overly dressed with sauce.  In addition the burger meat was not seasoned but maybe that was intentional as to not compete with the sauces and condiments that are on top of it. Either way...both burgers were too saucy to eat neatly..my Kiki had too much onion marmalade and his Miso burger had  too much apple vinaigrette.  Besides the bun of the Miso burger was too flimsy to hold up to the saucy mess.  As we continued to eat, we really felt the need for salt to counteract the overly sweet toppings and to season the beef.  Adding salt did enhance the meat, but didn't really blunt the sweetness.  Sad since, the beautiful meat that has been so consciously sourced and carefully selected should be highlight, and possibly a light sprinkle of salt would have enhanced its greatness.   As we continued to finish our burgers, we became more and more bummed it was not what we thought it would be and definitely didn't live up to the hype.  Still I like Bachi Burger's expression of its passions and consciousness of the environment and its local community, I just hope it can improve on its uniqueness!",

    "text": "The best burger in Las Vegas in my opinion!!! I'm not really a big fan of burger and would only eat it due to cravings. But this place makes me a huge burger fanatic! I really love the Kiki burger.  I've tried the Banh mi burger and Ronin burger which are also good and flavorful. But the Kiki burger is by far my favorite.  Don't forget to try their truffle parmesan fries and stir fried garlic chili edamame. Mmmmnnnn, so good! I can't wait to come back to this place and try their other specialty sandwiches and burgers.  The service was excellent as well. Food came out right away, cooked just how we liked it.  The servers were prompt in refilling our drinks and clearing stuff away as we lick our plates clean...okay, that's an exaggeration! I think the prices are reasonable for the portions it comes in.  Try this place and you won't regret it :)",

It's in the corner of a strip mall next to the movie theater.    I would come here again for sure.  Aw, hell no! I just got my bill and they charged me for a tiny bit of bbq/hoisin sauce.  It's only $.50, but I hate that.  Where's my credit for the other sauce that I didn't use?!  Seriously, I hope the owner reads these reviews.  So much though went into the menu and plating.  It's a shame to ruin an impression over silly pricing policies.",

    "text": "So the last time I was in Vegas I went to the location on Windmill street. We had the best service and the best food. However this time we thought we would try this location which was closer to where we were staying. The food was great no complaints there. It was the service that lacked. My party of 10 and I were running late and I called to them know and they were fine with it. When we arrived, we still had to wait 15 minutes before we were actually seated. Mind you, the restaurant wasn't busy at all. Our waiter was Marcos and he did a mediocre job at best to help my party of 10. He forgot to ask if we needed beverages, didn't clear the table off because we had dirty plates everywhere. When we were seated for a bit and he came back to the table, he asked if we were ready to order. I said yes we are, I'll go first. He dismissed me and stated we are doing appetizers first then we will order the entrees in a very dismissive rude way. I had to correct him and let him know I'm trying to order an appetizer but he rudely cut me off. From there, it was down hill. I just wish we had better service and not a server who would cut me off. It was my bday and the place wasn't busy but we waited forever for our food. I just hope this location models after the windmill location and pics up their customer service and learns how to treat their customers.",

The hostess was so rude to my parents and when I tried to communicate nicely to her she became rude to me.

The waiter goes n the back and says yes they will change it. So we get our appetizer of oxtail fries and the channel still hasn't changed.   We basically finish the platter and still haven't seen our waiter 2 remind him about the channel so we flag down another waiter. This waiter says something like we don't change the channel and y would u want 2 watch it with out volume but I will see what we can do.  By this time our burgers come out. I am semi enjoying my Kiki burger when our first waiter approaches. He remembers that he was going 2 change the channel and ask us y the channel hasn't changed. OMG @ this point we just ask for our check and leave.  Idk what the big deal was it was 530 on a Sunday with 3 other people in the restaurant and they were not even facing the tv.

I ordered the Miyagi-san, which was just bursting with taste. I will say that they put maybe a tad bit too much sauce, and the menu doesn't really do a great job of explaining what the size of the burgers are, so I ended up with the Miyagi-san, which is the size of a f'ing brick. Otherwise, you can't really beat the price and taste at this level.",

    "text": "Two years ago I dined at the original location and left with slight disappointment. I loved the food and servers, but was miffed by the long wait for the food. After refraining from going since then, I made an effort to visit their new location to see if things changed, and I'm glad to report things have improved for the better.  The new location is larger and the aesthetic darker, sleek, and comfortable. Service throughout the entire meal was attentive and kind. Drinks were filled without being asked. One of the waitresses sweetly made conversation and our main server checked in good intervals. The apex of the night was the food.  The meal was delightful and fulfilling. The steamed edamame was a nice beginning; the portions were generous, hot, and lightly salted. The parmesean truffle fries were heavenly. The fries were served in a shiny funnel container and tasted hot, crispy, and cheesy. I enjoyed the tomato aioli sauce that was paired with it, too. However, I wish the fries were thicker. As you work your way to the bottom of the funnel, they begin to shrivel into little pieces that start to resemble crumbled potato chips. I ordered the no-meat burger and requested avocado. The presentation was simple and cute. The burger itself was tall and I had trouble biting into it. The flavor of the mushroom patty was a notch better than store bought veggie patties. What really elevated the burger was the toppings and airy bun. The sweet tofu, mixed greens and salty patty created a pleasing experience for my taste buds. Although, next time I would say no on the vinaigrette that comes with it because it became a little to greasy for me. Overall, Bachi retained it's good food with improved service. Hopefully it stays that way.",

We started w/ the specialty appetizer, oxtail chili cheese fries-- great balance of flavors and there was a perfect ratio of toppings to fries, which were crispy and cooked perfectly.  The burgers are sublime. Unique, and full of flavor on the perfect bun. We literally just got back and had to write this because we were so inspired and happy to have such a satisfying and delicious meal.  Can't wait to return to bachi burger to try something else.  The ambiance of the restaurant was very nice, casual but modern and elegant.  Our server was knowledgable, friendly, and attentive.  Prices are extremely reasonable.

As an example, I arrived last night with six others in my party, and we were told we would need to wait at least 45 minutes. The dining room was about 2/3 full with nobody waiting. The host explained that the chef \"wouldn't allow anyone to be seated as they were having trouble getting the orders out fast enough\". I find it hard to understand why the management of this restaurant would promote this type of info to be given to its customers, or how, on a Friday night, they would not have enough staff to handle any expected or unexpected increase in volume. My guess is that the management has changed, or the management is overwhelmed, or the management is asleep, or the management is stupid or the management doesn't care. Either way, I would avoid this place until they get their act together or don't go there ever because they will soon be out of business!

Bachi burger used to be one of our favorite restaurants, until last night, and we would come here at least once a month. We became dedicated customers since the first Bachi that opened on Windmill. We were so stoked one opened near us.  I was being quite observant last night because the change was that noticeable. The usual atmosphere of Bachi Burger is now different and uncomfortable.  I almost wanted to leave because it was freezing inside. My boyfriend and I sat down and the vibe of the place was completely off. The lights were extremely bright. The feel of intimacy was no longer there, which makes it a horrible place for a date night. The music was no longer smooth, jazzy electronic music, which gave it that Asian fusion vibe. Wasn't that the whole concept of Bachi? You could barely hear Frank Sinatra playing in the background as the blenders and customers conversations were actually louder than the music. It also seemed like they were short on waiters/waitresses, no greeting hostess,  and everyone in the kitchen looked confused. Our food arrived quickly, but it wasn't AS great as usual. My medium well was more medium RARE and slightly chewy, I couldn't even finish it. I was so hungry. :(   My experience this time was different. I hope Bachi gets it together... The food is such a delicious concept to give up on all because they can't run a stabilize business.",

    "text": "Pure burger perfection is what I can summarize this place to be.  Seriously, where I come from, there isn't any kind of burger joint like this.  From the Wagyu burger to the kalbi burger, even the kale chicken salad, Bachi Burger does is right with flair!  Both times I've been here, I have been blown away.  The oxtail fries are to die for, creamy in sauce, deliciousness in the oxtail meat, seasoned perfectly with the right amount of seasoning. Fries cooked very well to taste, crispy and flavorful.  Top it all of with scallion garnish. It's definitely an order to share, unless you're feeling extra gluttonous.  The kalbi burger with the kalbi sauce, fried egg, kimchi is amazing as well. Cooked medium rare, the juices were bursting with beef flavor, balanced out by the fried egg. A medley of kimchi, and kalbi sauce, complimented each other perfectly.  Also helped tremendously are the buns.  Soft and flaky, border lining on buttery, rounded out the burger, elevating it above the rest.   On my second visit, I had the pleasure of eating the Shogun burger, with its Wagyu beef (a $30 burger no less) patty.  Creamy, thick and tender.  Arguably the best burger I've had in my life up to this point.  The tenderness is balanced out by the crispy onion rings in the middle, and did I mention the bacon?  Somehow, even the bacon tasted like it absorbed the Wagyu flavors, and a creamy fried egg makes this burger to die for!   The spot is very inviting, and warm.  Very spacious in the ebb and flow, staff friendly and efficient.  They handled our party of 14 like a pro in my second visit.  Everyone received their food within 5 minutes of each other once food came out after 15 minutes of ordering.  It's ways off the strip, but if you have a car, definitely make your way out to the neighbourhood of Summerlin where Bachi Burger is located.  If taking a cab, it's about $30 each way from the strip and back and a 30 minutes ride.  There's also a movie theatre next door if you want to take it easy in your visit to Vegas.  Side note, the burgers are cooked on a flat top Hibachi grill, hence the Bachi in the Bachi Burger.  Definitely one of the top spots to visit while in Vegas!",

    "text": "One of the best burger joints in Vegas. This spot is better than the other Bachi Burger joints in town. Better atmosphere, nicer employees, etc.  My boyfriend and I shared the Shogun Burger and the Oxtail Chili Fries. The Shogun Burger was one of the more expensive burgers ($26), consisting of Wagyu Beef and Unagi, pan seared foie gras, poached Asian pear, miso butter, and a Yamamomo peach. The other burgers ranged about $10. We ordered it medium, but got it medium well. It wasn't really a big deal, but I know many people talking of having miscooked burgers. Other than that, it was amazing! Very flavorful, juicy, and well worth the money.  The oxtail chili fries are to die for. It comes with a fried egg on top of it, beans, peppers, etc. It was featured in an old episode of Guy Fieri's Diner's, Drive-In's, and Dive's, and it is well worth the hype.  I recommend this place to anyone who wants a nice Asian fusion to a regular American burger place. Have a little extra money to spend and craving a burger? Skip your McDonald's/In 'n' Out! This is the place to go!",

    "text": "My coworker had been telling me about Bachi Burger for a couple months prior to my trip to Vegas, so I made a point to stop by for lunch since we had a rental car this trip. We went to their location on Sahara Ave, which is a 20-25 minute drive from the Strip, and kind of in the middle of nowhere. Their other location is closer to the Strip, but much busier. This location didn't have a wait at all (we went on a Tuesday around 11:30am), so we were seated right away and placed our order quickly. We tried:  -Pork Belly Steamed Buns (Duroc Pork Belly, Cilantro, Scallion, Radish, Boiled Egg, Chinese Black Vinegar, Hoisin, $10, <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bachi-burger-las-vegas-2?select=lxq7Rgfk1DvnFYx8IArVlw#86Acu6zecLZU6FiYGJcb_A\">yelp.com/biz_photos/bach...</a>): Yum- really good pork belly buns. The buns were nice and fluffy, and held up to the pork belly well. I loved how all the ingredients worked together in this dish- highly recommended! -Shogun Burger (Wagyu Beef, Unagi, Pan Seared Foie Gras, Poached Asian Pear, Miso Butter, Yamamomo Peach, $26, <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bachi-burger-las-vegas-2?select=lxq7Rgfk1DvnFYx8IArVlw#lxq7Rgfk1DvnFYx8IArVlw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/bach...</a>): There are a LOT of ingredients in this burger, and most of them work really well together. However, you really had to smush the burger down to get the whole burger in one bite. I think there would be less clash in the flavors if you took out the unagi and peach, but I just took my pieces out and ate those separately. Although I enjoyed trying this burger (and the richness of the foie gras), I wouldn't order this again since it was too flavorful for me.   Overall, I enjoyed my lunch at Bachi Burger, and it was a nice change from always dining at a place on the Strip. They have a very extensive burger menu as well as Asian influenced snack type dishes, so I would love to come back and try other items/burgers. The parking lot at this plaza is big, so you should be able to find a spot easily.",

First of all, another table received their food before us even though we were seated and ordered before them.  To add insult to injury, I was starving and they ordered the oxtail chili cheese fries ($11.50 w/ fried egg on top).  This plate looked awesome!  Despite the foregoing, the fries and rings were good when we finally got them.  Both burgers were ho hum - Nothing Special.  The B&G did not have much blue cheese and it was missing bacon on one side.   The Miyagi was just missing - it came out 15 min after my burger (and at the same time as another customer who was seated well after us).  When I asked the Mgr where the Miyagi was, all he said was there was a problem in the kitchen.  The real problem was that my friend's burger was served to another table because I saw Miyagis being served to other tables where the patrons came after us.  The Mgr did try to show us some luv by giving us complimentary Portuguese donuts.  We were eagerly expecting pao doce (sweet bread) or malasadas.  Unfortunately, what we received was fried dough that was the consistency of a cake donut on the inside, w/ the taste of cinnamon from a stale churro on the outside.  One word description:  NASTY!  I would not make the trek from the strip to come again.  The food is nothing special, the prices are high and the service is spotty.  I can get a much better burger and service back home in OC at Umami, 25 Degrees and Haven.",

A colleague and I arrived at an off-peak time, so there were not many people in the establishment, but good atmosphere nonetheless.   We ordered a burger a piece and shared an order of the oxtail fries.  MUST get the oxtail fries.  Can be eaten as an entree for one.    I ordered the Shogun Burger.  My buddy had the Miyagi San Burger.  Both featured wagyu beef and were cooked to temp and were stupid delicious.  Will definitely come again.",

    "text": "For some reason, all the threads in YT about burgers made me feel like having one. So I decided to head back to Bachi Burger and eat inside the restaurant. In my last review I had the Ronin burger which was very good. This time I went with the Kiki burger, which has applewood smoked bacon, 3 different mushrooms, guyere cheese and chili aoili mayo. $12. I also ordered a Mocha Almond Fudge milkshake.  The restaurant was less than half full on a Friday night at 8pm. I arrived expecting to have to wait a bit, but was warmly greeted by the cute hostess and seated immediately. My waiter came over after about 8 minutes and took my order, and my food was out within 10 minutes. Pretty quick.   OK, why only 3 stars this time? Well, it would be 3.5 because the burger was pretty good, although the flavor of the bacon seemed lost inside. But what really bothers me is paying $6 for a milkshake, and getting it served in a small 10 oz or maybe 12 oz glass, with a lot of whipped cream on top. Really? Take notes restaurant owners and managers. A good milkshake that you are making me pay a small fortune for should always be served in a 16 oz glass, with the remaining shake served in the silver cup it was made in. This is not an option. Milkshake lovers like myself will thank you, and if you don't serve it this way, I will never visit your establishment again no matter how good the food is. Rant over.",

I'm typically not a fan of \"fancy\" hamburger creations, but it's hard not to like this place. Not my favorite burger, but still very good. I had the Spicy Miso Burger, which wasn't spicy, and the Salt & Pepper Garlic French Fries. The burger had fresh, quality ingredients and tasted very good! It also looked perfectly built, so it was a shame I had to make a mess of it. The fries were ok, but not what I'll remember. Plus, I was too full from the burger to finish them. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants to have a good Asian inspired hamburger.",

    "text": "Bachi Burger is a hidden gem.  If you are in for an adventure and are not looking to eat an everyday burger this place is a must try.    To start the place was a little hard to find at night.  Their signage is not lit and the place is tucked in the corner of a strip mall, off the main road (Sahara).  As you enter the entrance is very dark, but you are quickly greeted with a warm welcome from multiple members of their team.  The place is clean and has an urban feel to it.  Also great service from beginning to end.  The food.  For starters we had the Oxtail Chili cheese fries.  This is a winner!  Beware: it's a large quantity so you probably should try to order a half order(not sure if they offer). If you are there to have some beers this would be the one to order.  The burgers we tried: The Miyaji San .... its a 5Star!  We shared and both enjoyed.  The Kalbi burger was underwhelming .... was more like a Teri glazed burger.  Could be it just wasn't for us.    We'll be back.  We enjoyed the atmosphere and when we travel to Vegas next year, we'll bring our friends and try some of their other offerings.",

Their wedge salad was crisp, fresh, and loaded. Light on dressing which was perfect!  Wife had the Just Fries for the sole purpose of trying the pineapple ketchup. Both were very good. Funny but she said fries reminded her of McDonald's!  Strawberry lemonade made from scratch was outstanding and bottomless. Not too sweet. Just the right amount of tart.   I had a Sapporo draft. Bonus was a free glass if I checked in!  Sure!  Was told it was a fresh keg, but it could have been colder and the pour was a bit light, a finger short of the rim including head.   Overall a solid 4 stars.   Note their ramen shop next door is opening soon.   I will be back each visit!",

We ordered the Bone Marrow Jam: it was decadent, and since it's a jam, it's a little sweet. The bread was nice and crispy, and the foie gras butter just adds that extra umph to the bite.   Black and Green Burger was cooked perfectly. Medium rare was just the way we like it. The meat also has some sort of sweet flavor to it and the blue cheese complements it.   I really liked the Banh Mi burger.  The mix of shrimp, beef and pork patty made it a unique and flavorful bite.  Their burgers are large and their sides are reasonably priced.  The service are on par.  Oh! we found a new love, a very flavourful sake called Wakatake \"Demon Slayer,\" fruity with a nice aroma and hints of peach and tangerine. We purchased a 720ml bottle to take home. $42 seemed high but hey you get what you pay for.  Bachi has won me over with their delicious burgers, delicious fries, and friendly and laid back atmosphere.",

I ordered mine medium rare and it always comes out just right. Always packed with flavor !  Another favorite is the Spicy Miso burger.

    "text": "With some friends visiting they wanted something different to try on this trip. I normally go to the Henderson location but they were staying downtown so I drove to this location. I noticed the menu to be a little different but the food was just as good. The service was on point. The waitress missed one of our burgers but she expedited it and also gave us a Thai Iced tea for the trouble. It wasn't that long of a wait anyway.  Since I was familiar with the menu I ordered appetizers for the group. We shared the oxtail chili cheese fries which are a must try and the pork belly bao. Our friend really enjoyed each of the appetizers and the burgers they had. I never had a bad experience with Bachi and I will keep dinning here with visitors or without, keep up the great work!!",

The feel of this restaurant is definitely more family friendly as the other location gives off more of a trendy vibe. The food here was just as good as the original. Ox-tail cheese fries and wings are my favorites to order. I usually eat so much of the appetizers I take my burger to go, so I can tell you with confidence their burgers hold up well as a midnight snack. When we were there I counted 4 families with young children and I believe they had both booster seats as well as high chairs.",

On top of the amazing food, was our amazing waitress Diana! She was friendly, accommodating, and she made our first meal at Batchi Burger one to remember! Thank you so much Diana. She should definitely get a raise, she's the bomb!   I would recommend the Kiki Burger, Bachi Fish Burger, Spicy Miso Burger and the Ronin Burger and the Miyagi San Burger. Out of the 5 burgers we had we all rated our burgers a 5/5! We would recommend you opening a location in Hawaii! We are so amazed by the quality of the burgers here!

The downside about this was that the sauce was only on the top so the bottom had no sauce. I recommend asking for the sauce on the side. It came with another sauce on the side but that overpowers the truffle so I don't recommend using it. As for the veggie burger, I loved that it came with a slice of tofu. The patty was breaking apart as I kept taking bites. There wasn't much flavor to it but it was better than my other experience of veggie burgers in Vegas. I enjoyed the bun a lot!   The meat burgers looked better.",

Usually the newer locations to restaurants have a hard time competing with the original spots reputation but I prefer this location to the Windmill one. Our waitress was awesome and handled the group well.  So Bachi Burger does a lot of Asian inspired foods: wings, burgers, fries. I love the concept but have never really been a fan. I think the unique ideas never really translated to a good tasting burger and I normally only go because everyone else wants to.   I had a pitcher of sangria, oxtail fries, regular fries, and the banh mi burger. My food was just awesome. The white sangria was delicious. The oxtail fries were topped well. The banh mi burger is delicious.   Maybe it was the sangria, maybe it was the server, maybe it was the joyous birthday celebration, but I had an awesome experience.",

I wanted to take the plate back to the strip, find a drive-through wedding chapel, and marry it. For dinner, he got the spicy miso burger and I got the Mr. Ho's burger (both bun less, of course). The meat was high quality, and the toppings were super tasty. I wish they would open a Bachi Burger in Phoenix. I'll be back the next time I'm in Sin City!!!",

More like Bachitty Service Burger.\"  Here are some of the highlights:  We had a group of 12 people.  Plenty of room to sit. It took about 20 minutes to get seated.  It took 15 minutes for anyone to stop by our table.  That's when the busboy spilled water.  Which is no big deal, but he didn't wipe it after he spilled it.  10 minutes later we finally place orders.  I tell the waiter about the spill, the busboy comes back, wipes the water on the ground.  I tell him about the table, uses the same towel he wiped the floor with.  Gave 4 of us plates for the 4 orders of fries we got.  We had to flag another busser down, but we never got more plates.  Asked for napkins, never came.  Water is completely empty for half the table, they see it, we have to ask again for a refill.  Honestly, it's frustrating to write all of this.  It shouldn't take 2 hours to have a burger with your family.  It's a shame too because I thought the burger was pretty good.  I've just never seen such horrific service, and a failure to understand that bad service was being offered when it was clear as day.  There were too many workers there to not understand.

The one they sell the most was the miyagi, which was good, the crunch from the onion rings were good, and the flavor of the yolk mixed well.   Spicy miso for me was just another burger. The shredded lettuce overpowered the whole burger, and wasn't the most pleasant over power flavor.   The burgers were really big. Between three people this was more than enough food, I think 5 people could have split all this food and had a good bite of each and still be just full.   I think for flavor, I still like Unami burger for the juiciness of the meat, but I think you get more value and more uniqueness for what you pay.",

However both burgers were over cooked and so were the eggs. The burgers leave more to be desired for, especially at close to $14.   Also they have happy hour 3-6 but didn't tell us that or give us a menu.   Overall if the food was cooked better the way we wanted it I would rate it higher.

When we first got there, there were only 3 tables that had been filled. So the place was still mostly empty. We walked up to the host/hostess station which was empty. When someone finally came over, he said that we needed to wait 5 minutes for the service to kitchen to catch up? This was well after the lunch hour and the kitchen did not look busy at all. So I asked if we could at least look at the menu and get an order ready, to which he replied no because we would still have to wait anyway. This made no sense at all since the kitchen was clearly NOT busy. When we were finally seated, the waitress took over 20 minutes to come greet us and when we got our order in, it took over 40 minutes for us to get our meal. Keep in mind that the restaurant is still very much empty at this point. When we got the bill at the end (which also took forever), we had been overcharged and then had to wait another half hour for the waitress to adjust it. So a meal that should have taken maybe just over an hour ended up taking over 2.5 hours due to their incompetence and general neglect.   I'll probably try out their other location, but honestly the only thing saving this review for them is the fact that the food was actually good. It was just horribly tainted by their incomparably bad service.",

The kalbi burger was a little on the salty side, but still good. Fries are good side dish. Oxtail chili chest fries are okay, like my fries crunchy, big portion. Also, a good side is the pork belly steam bao. The summerlin location is clean, not loud and never have to wait in line.",

I was a bit disappointed however with my experience at this Bachi Burger. The  burger I had was so so, nothing I would come back for, the after taste from eating it reminded me of the burger for longer than I would have liked. Also had the infamous ox tail chili fries which was good and I would recommend. Ambience was a kind of like Applebee's, lot of screaming kids in there which kind of took away from enjoying my meal. Bottom line place is average, I think you can find a better burger for half price elsewhere in town.",

Every 3 months I try to give this location another chance, and it never gets better, sometimes even worse.  I can tell the staff is polite but they are often inefficient in taking your orders, fulfilling requests and come across as being inexperienced. Even though it's been a whole year since they've opened.  Once you order with the waiter, expect to wait more than half an hour for a burger. Don't ask me why it takes that long to cook up a burger.  And god forbid if you need to change something on your bill. Because they will have to ask someone else to do it, and who knows what happens after that... but I found myself annoyed and tapping my feet next to the register after 15 mins of waiting and trying to catch someone, anyone's attention.  I'm going back to the days of driving to Windmill to have a Ronin Burger. You can't go wrong with the original and the staff there is fast, efficient and friendly.  I hope they don't bring this horrible service to their soon-to-open LA location.",

First no one was there at the front to greet me when I walked in, after few minutes I was seated. It took another 5 minutes before a waiter came by. I ordered the Furikake  Teriyaki steak-cut fries for $3. The fries was okay, I think they just fried the fries & put Mr. Yoshida's sauce with some sesame seed. Then I ordered the Crispy Calamari, I told the waiter, Bobby that it was okay. Bobby said he didn't believe me. I ordered Calamari every where I go, Fleming's is a great place to get Calamari, If you ever want to have good calamari, this place isn't it. The good news is that at least Bobby didn't call me a liar!! I must say that their Kiki's Burger is really good. Believe me, I want this restaurant to be successful. My parents owned a Chinese/Japanese restaurant for 18 years. It's so hard to please customers. I was not happy to be charged $8 for the Crispy Calamari. That's on their Happy Hour menu.  In this town their are many restaurants that offer better Happy Hour foods. I hope by December 7th, for my friends party, they will have better Happy Hour appetizers. I really hope this restaurant will have better service on December 7th. You will be impressed with their Kiki's Burger.",

    "text": "Short, sweet and to the point. That'll be my review (at least, I'll try). Not the actual experience.  Let's get the inevitable bad part out of the way now. Service:  Overall, not very good at all. I won't blame the wait staff, but will wholeheartedly blame the management. Obviously properly scheduling staff is not a required skill when applying for a managerial position there and that lack of restaurant 101 expertise results in a devastating cascading effect on quality of service. Too few waiters = lots of empty tables = long wait before getting seated = very long time before server acknowledge you = past the point of dehydration before any water on table = alcohol withdrawals symptoms creep up before getting chance to order any drinks = you have whole menu memorized by heart before server finally take your order = hunger pain substitute for the tremors caused by the earlier lack of alcoholic content in our bloodstream = you sob with joy when your much anticipated meal is being displayed before your teary eyes.  There was very little happiness and smiles, just busy waiter bees trying to catch up, no team effort. It all comes back to bad training and no business culture.  Food: I have to be fair and can't really complain about my own stupidity defying common sense of food pairing. So, I'll refrain from any negativity until I try again in the future. See, what I did, was a giant \"fusion-nouvelle-burger cuisine\" faux pas. I dared to customize my options with elements that probably did not compliment each other and  it took away the taste of the meat. Next time, I will order without customization and render a proper food review.  3 last important notes:  1) Do not order the Kobe option if you plan to have various condiments, sauce, etc. Kobe beef burgers are meant for burger purists and cooked rare to medium rare and not meant to be overwhelmed by options. You'd waste your hard earned money as chances are that condiments and toppings would overpower the beef's taste.  2) Fries are good and options are tempting, but in most cases the toppings are also too sparse to make a huge difference. Maybe ask for extra to make a difference.  3) Website: Don't bother, It doesn't work very well and is the least informative. You can't see the menu because Mr. Webmaster decided to be creative with flash, yet failed to deliver basic needs for information.  Sorry for breaking my promise to make a short, sweet and to the point review.",

My boyfriend and I had heard lots of great things about this restaurant and wanted to check out the hype, but once we arrived we waited in the front lobby for five minutes for a host to come to front and seat us. We were seated at a table in the midst of the busy restaurant and while everyone was either served or acknowledged, we were not. Plenty of employees walked by and yet no one said a word to us. After about ten minutes of sitting at your table without a single employee acknowledging our presence or apologizing for the wait, we got up and left. We would've appreciated at least an employee that apologized for the wait or said \"I'll be right back to take your order.\" But no. If a restaurant doesn't want to act like our service is important, then I don't need to dine and spend my money there. Overall just horrible service for what's supposed to be a \"gourmet\" experience.",

My mom ordered sweet potato fries, which was good.  The happy hour menu also had the option for sliders.  My mom got it, she does not like sweet things and this burger was sweet so we switched food.  I got the Black & Green Burger with American Wagyu Grass Fed Beef, Sauteed Mushrooms, Spinach, Bacon, Point Reyes Blue Cheese, and Roasted Garlic.  The burger was good but seems to be a little on the bland side.  My husband ordered the Miyagi-san's Grass-Fed Wagyu Burger with Chili Mayo, Fried Egg, Furikake, Caramelized Bacon, and Crispy Onion Rings.  This one was a clear winner!  The flavor combination was just amazing.  It was not too salty, not too greasy, it was just perfect!  I'm coming back here to get a Miyagi-san for myself and have more of the Oxtail Chili Fries.  We've seen a lot of tables ordering the Bao Sandwiches.  I will have to try that next time.",

    "text": "Messed it up and then made it right!  Another stop on my DDD tour and those of you, or that one of you, that reads my reviews know that I do not just dole out the four stars reviews.  We were greeted nicely and ordered some adult beverages and some sausages.  Three stars could go for the sausages alone they were fabulous. Seriously, my partner loves when I give her \"sausage\" and she seemed equally pleased about the Kurobuta  and Arabiki sausages we received.  I must admit, I was a little jealous. (Just a little jealous, the sausages aren't that big.  Wink Wink) Only two main hiccups.  When we asked what was the difference between the red sangria and the white sangria, we were told that one was red and one was white!? Really!?  Uhmmm....Ok.  Seeing our bewilderment the waitress went into small detail about the differences, but I am still not convinced that she actually knew.  I am sure that she will do better next time. It was good, but I still want to know what the big difference is, especially if they are both made with sake.  I'm quite sure that there is no red sake.  The second hiccup was that  my dining partner loathes, simply loathes mushrooms.  She thinks that they taste like dirt.  And according to her palette she order the black and green burger without mushrooms.  And of course it came covered with mushrooms. I don't really get upset about the addition of the mushrooms, mistakes happen, but it throws off the entire pace of the meal when something like that happens.  Luckily the item was taken quickly back to the kitchen and the annoying fungi were removed. A manager came out and did his best to make up the mistake.  The conversation was a little awkward between him and my dining partner but in the end we felt that he was making a solid attempt make up for the earlier error and that's what counts. Oh let me talk about my burger.  I had the \"Shogun.\"  It was as epic as it sounds.  Wagyu beef, unagi and foie gras.  Foie gras!  You had me at Foie! It was delicious, the only thing is that it comes with a sweet sort of chutney that works, but I am not a big fan of sweet with my savory.  When I come back again I will see if I can order it with the non-carne items of the side. We also had the ox-tail fries.  I have red other reviews and would agree that for an entree that they  might need more meat, but as a side they were spectacular and a wonderful addition to our burgers. Dessert was fresh doughnuts and coffee ice cream.  Excellente! Hai! I will be back and you should go.",

I had the Miyagi burger which was 7 oz of American Wagyu and a fried egg and bacon and...  Pretty juicy and big and cooked medium rare-medium.  They also had $5 shakes that looked great but we were too full after eating burgers, sharing the chili cheese fries and also Parmesan truffle fries.  We remarked how many crispy shoes strings there were in one $5 order of fries.  The three of us shared it and didn't finish (your mileage may vary).  Both Bacchi Burgers are 15-20 minutes from the strip so you need to look for them.  The odd thing was the wait even though half of the tables were unoccupied the entire time we were waiting and eating.",

    "text": "Oh my goodness my goodness my goodness goodness gracious. I don't even know where to begin with how epically delicious our meal was at Bachi Burger... The Ronin is just the very best burger I can ever remember eating. Potentially there was a more insanely amazing burger somewhere in my infancy and I can't recall it. But that really seems unlikely, especially because we were eating dinner with my parents and I think they would have reminded me. But I digest..;) Our hostess, our waiter and the manager helping to check on tables were all absolutely friendly and gracious. The hostess even set up a high chair at our table for my son before escorting us over to it, ix-naying the unnecessary chair and making sure the sharp knives were well out of reach. When we first got to Bachi Burger it was a young professionals at happy hour type of crowd and I was worried were wrecking the vibe (as my baby was nomming puffs of cereal and gumming teething toys like a villain). But later in the evening two other families with young children came in and I got the impression that Bachi Burger does a good job catering to a wide variety of crowds. It was already pretty busy at 7pm on a Monday so I would definitely recommend making a reservation. On a future visit (who wants to come back with me tomorrow? And the next day?:)) I would order the salt and pepper fries to accompany the Ronin. The salt and pepper fries had just enough going on with their seasoning, the crunchy slivers of jalapeno and hot chili dipping sauce to complement but not compete with the burger main event. The Parmesan truffle fries I got were just a little too heavy to go with such an already complex burger, but they were definitely deserving of another visit in their own right. I also really enjoyed the Kiki burger and the iced matcha green tea (oddly much better-tasting with the meal than on it's own).  Oh my goodness, Bachi Burger. I can't wait to see you again!!",

Ordered my norm of the Banh Mi burger. I had asked for it Medium Rare & it showed up medium to medium well. Three others were dining with me that day & their burgers did not come out as ordered either. Fries were just ok. Between the 4 of us we ordered Oxtail Fries, Salt & Pepper & Truffle fries. Didn't seem as crispy as they should have & as they do @ Windmill location. Ambiance - place was too loud. We were there for a Tuesday lunch around 12:30pm. There wasn't that many people in the place but the walls just made all the sounds carry & even louder. They need some soft deco on the walls to help the noise. Overall I wouldn't go back to the Sahara location. I'd much rather go to the Windmill location.",

    "text": "We happened on this place by pure serendipity. We were out shopping for something else, got hungry, looked around, and there was Bachi Burger. Neither of us eat burgers as part of our regular diet but I had been having a hankering for a burger for couple of week and I jumped at the opportunity.  Boy, did I hit the jackpot!  We both ordered their Kiki Burger. This variation includes carmelized bacon (you read right), sweet onion marmelade, sauteed Shitakee, Enohi, and Eryngil mushrooms, Gruyere cheese, and an interesting mix of chopped baby greens including frisee and maybe arugula and baby spinach. They include a garlic chili aoili on the side that adds a nice little heat kick. For the bun, they toast a Taiwanese sweet bread. The hamburger is a flavorful Angus beef. I ordered mine cooked medium.  This is the first burger in memory that I didn't want to slather with ketchup to boost the moistness and the flavor. The Kiki Burger didn't need it and held up until the last bite. The textures enhance the experience. You bite the sweet bun and hit the crispness from the toasting until you encounter chewy bits of the carmelized bacon then the beef patty.  The other burgers offered didn't look as appetizing and the descriptions veered into Asian-influenced wierdness. A burger with kimchee? Maybe another time...  The burger by itself was $10, an incredible value given the inflated prices we'd been paying for food along the Las Vegas Strip. Fries are extra but one burger is more than enough unless you are a glutton or on a weight-gain diet.  I learned from doing a web search that Bachi Burgers is a little Las Vegas phenomenon with about ten locations. The manager told us they are opening their first location outside of Vegas in Los Angeles. Remember the name. If you are in  Vegas, get off the Strip and make this a destination.",

I got the Spicy Miso Burger, tasted amazing. It was moist and they used the miso flavor very well.   The reason for the three stars is because my group of friends received terrible service. I don't recall our server's name, he never introduced himself. But this guy just did not seem like he wanted to be there. He couldn't recall any of the milkshake flavors (turns out they don't have a regular chocolate milkshake, and the server had to come back and tell us that, guess he didn't know that in the first place). He literally replied with \"chocolate peanuts butter, strawberry and something...I don't know.\" Well geez, don't you work there?  He also forgot to add on the extra party that my friend ordered, and my friend decided to go without since it would've taken another 5-10 minutes to make. When it came to the check, I told him specifically what amounts is like split, he still got it wrong. My group resorted to asking other servers around us if they had a regular milk tea (apparently they only have flavored...makes you wonder if it's all powder back there), and another server to grab ours so that we could ask for the check. All the other servers there seemed lovely and helpful, even the new guy, but ours was downright unpleasant.   I'll probably eat here again...just to go!!",

Having lived here, and having family here as well, I've been to most everywhere else anyway.   So, as it's my birthday month, yes, as we get older, we celebrate the month, as opposed to the day because we don't know how many more we'll have - I ended up at Bachi Burger up at Peccole Ranch. Went for lunch on a weekday to avoid the evening and weekend crowds.   Nice restaurant and pretty good service. The server, even while in training, I believe her name is Brittany, was very attentive, friendly and nice. She kept her composure as it started getting busy as I opted to get in right after opening to avoid the lunch crowd.   I ordered the Iced Green Tea Matcha. Enjoyed it! Especially the unlimited refills.   I also ordered the Kiki Burger. Enjoyed it. Angus Beef, Sauteed Shiitake, Enoki & Eryngii Mushrooms, Caramelized Bacon, Sweet Onion Marmalade, Aged Gruyere Cheese, Garlic Chili Aioli.   I also had an order of Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries. It wasn't quite what I was expecting and I ended up leaving about half of the order untouched. Not that it was bad though.   All in all, I enjoyed my meal and I'd go back if I have a burger craving and I happen to be in the area.",

    "text": "I visit Las Vegas often and have eaten at this location twice and at the Windmill Ln location once.  All three experiences have been excellent not only in food but in service.  All three times I've been with Bachi virgins.  They all leave raving, some saying it's the best burger they've ever had.  This is an account of my most recent visit.  Four of us arrived around 1:00 after hiking at Red Rock and had to wait about 10 minutes to be seated.  Our waiter asked us if we had ever been there before.  He then explained the concept, how their burgers are cooked and some of the ingredients.  Over the course of the meal he checked in with us often but not too often.  We ordered the brussels sprouts and oxtail chili cheese fries as appetizers and each got a burger, one Ronin, two Kiki and a Lonely Bird.  Everything was delightful with one exception.  One of my friends had ordered her burger well done, and when it came it was very pink in the center.  We convinced her to send it back (she's always hesitant).  A new, perfectly cooked burger was produced in minutes, and she pronounced it delicious.  About ten minutes later, the waiter set a Salted Caramel Toasted Marshmallow shake on the table in front of her and said \"from the chef\".  We each in turn tried it and orgasmed right at the table.  My friend said she would like to dry hump the chef.  That is all.",

    "text": "Hey Yelpers...I did it. I finally had a burger from Bachi.  A bunch of you guys have given me a hard time about this (Terri and Gigi to name a few).  I've been to both Bachi's out here a combined 15+ times and have never had their burgers.  To me, it's all about the Bachi Fish baby.    Because I was giving up red meat for the next 6 weeks, it was perfect to attend Terri R's Fat Tuesday UYE at Bachi.  A few other Elite Yelpers were in attendance along with new Yelpers that are elite in life. Everyone ordered a burger and when it came to me, I was so close to getting their Alaskan Cod Sandwich.  But because it's Bachi and I won't taste red meat for awhile, I got their Black and Green Burger which is their Wagyu with mushrooms, spinach, garlic, and blue cheese.  The burger itself was good and I have no regrets.  However, I thought that the blue cheese was way overpowering.  If I could rename this burger, it be the Black and Blue Burger.    Overall, I had an great meal and excellent time meeting some new Yelpers.    Bachi UYE Roll Call (Message from Mel C):  Nelson S:  Nice to meet you, let's go on a hike.  Remember this week's 5K is a walking event, not a running event.   Chad S:  Everyone was right.  You're too cool and glad I've finally met you. See you at your UYE later this week.    Susan K and Noah R:  Again, congratulations on your engagement.  Some of the best peeps you can ever meet. Yes, I know this just from one night.   Francisco A (aka Cisco):  Another great elite to meet.  Another rhyme every time. He's the check in king that has the ability to check in from anywhere.  All you Dukes and Duchesses watch out.  He's a check in eater.  Watch out boy, watch out boy.   Terri R:  Thanks for putting this together.  Meeting your friends was definitely the highlight of the evening.  Another good meal with a great friend.  Bookmark checked!!!  Peace out and stay thirsty my friends.",

    "text": "Okay, so much hype, so I had to see for myself.  I warned my other half in advance that it wasn't the BOGO of Montana Meat Co., and it also wasn't going to include fries.  I'm big on self-preservation.  What I didn't know was how big and unpreposessing the place was going to be, with its abundance of unadorned tables and lack of any decor save for some modernistic Asian-influenced \"art\" on the walls.  Kinda like \"Decor by Bed, Bath and Beyond\" on sale (and don't forget those 20% off coupons).  You can eat the ambience, and my appetite wasn't getting all that stimulated.  Luckily, the burgers were excellent (we both had Ronins, medium).  They had a Pear Cider special for $4, so we had a couple of those, and shared an order of Salt and Pepper Garlic Fries.  We liked the aioli that came along with that, but the dressing for the burger worked as a dipping sauce, too.    When the burgers were delivered, I didn't see how I was going to bite into that gargantuan creation, but figured out quickly that if I press down and hold the chrome-dome top of the bun, I could compress it enough so that I didn't have to eat with with knife and fork.  That would have been way too difficult, since no forks were provided, just one serrated knife to share, presumably to cut the burger in half.    While we enjoyed our burgers and fries and the service was excellent, Bachi is somehow missing that je ne sais quois that would compel us to return on a regular basis.",

Facility: there are many locations, but we went to the one in Summerlin. It's tucked back behind some businesses off the main road, but I eventually found it. It's got a nice modern feel with tables and chairs and some bench seating. They have some alcoholic drinks and even a few beers on tap.   Service:  our waiter was super nice, even dare I say...fun.  He was very informative, but still playful, making the experience even better. Wish I would have remembered his name to give him all the credit. :(  Food:  ok, I was super lame and only ordered the plain Wagu burger with tomato, lettuce and mayo.  The patty of meat was marinated delicious!!!!!  It almost tastes like its marinated in teriyaki sauce. However, I ordered it med, but it was more med-well. The plain fries were good. Crispy and hot, small shoestring style.  We did order the pickle appetizer, but I wasn't really a fan. My friend loved it though!  Overall:  I liked it. Not my fav burger in town, but not the worst. I will come back someday I'm sure, because I did enjoy the flavor of the burger patty and the service was good.",

The place was packed with other couples in love this special night of course and we only waited 15 minutes to be seated which was good considering the crowd!  My boyfriend and I started off with the Oxtail chili cheese fries, mmmmm soooo delicious and flavorful we really enjoyed sharing this large dish as an appetizer! I was doing a lot of moaning while we devoured this delicious and massive dish!  I opted for the bahn mi burger which was very tasty and juicy with all of the right ingredients. I had an order of the plantation sweet tea which was delicious and refreshing!  My sweetheart got the Wagyu spicy miso burger and he really loved the great quality meat and sensational flavor of the burger! He also enjoyed his giant glass of root beer in which he had many refills!   We enjoyed our romantic and fun dinner out on Valentine's day then off to the movies!",

First, it probably took maybe 10 to 15 mins for us to even make an order. It was not busy at all so I expect for the server to serve us. This is our first time there so we wanted to ask the server some questions. She looked as though she was annoyed of the question. Plus, I asked for her to speak louder because I could not understand her soft spoken words. She repeated the same way she was speaking before. Basically she didn't care. Then as we ordered, she's basically suggesting we order this because it's higher quality. I'm like what? Did u throw an opinion on how we should order? I'm like no. I want to try this other thing.   I believe we finally got our food after a half an hour. I'm Like oh gosh. How tough is it to make burgers??? Food was bland. I kept adding the sauces that were on the table to add some flavor. Throw in a whole bunch of chili powder so it could be spicy. I ordered the spicy miso burger. Didn't taste spicy at all. The burger tasted high quality and that's fine.   But I don't think it's like amazing.   I would rate this place a little higher if it weren't for the horrible service.",

I can't even eat a burger without thinking of Bachi Burger.   The thing that separates BB from other burger places (and there are a lot of them) is their bun. The sweet (asian-y?) bun melts in your mouth and soaks in the deliciousness of the meat and sauces. Not only does it taste great, it's addictive.   We also tried their famous chilli fries - the one that Guy tried - and I found them pretty OK. They use thin cut fries, which I personally like better than the chunky fries, but then again that's just preference.   My favorite burger was the Kiki since the sauce they put in it was killer, in a good way of course. I'd say skip the milkshake - not too good. Just try everything out, it's great!  Obviously people know about this place since it gets super busy so be sure to get there early!",

On April 7, 2015, I took my girlfriend and visited the Summerlin, Nevada location and was not very impressed with anything.  It is safe to say I was very disappointed.    Let me first state that when I selected the lunch special (a three course meal), I was told that we were prohibited from sharing the meal.  We never eat much anyway and usually share one lunch every where we go and have never been told at any other place we could not do this.  I was instructed to add another Entry or pick another selection.  As if this was bad enough but I was hungry so I complied not wanting to embarrass my girlfriend by leaving.  Second, the assistant waiter did not know hot tea was not an option and delayed getting me a drink and eventually brought me a cold tea.  The meals came out and were burnt on one side.  I mean the crab cake appetizer and the burger.  I did not send them back since my lunch hour was almost over by this point.  We got the desert to go and it was some form of parfait that they just dumped into a to go box without any other container.  How sanitary was that.  I filled out the satisfaction survey at the restaurant and got attitude from the main waiter since I not only gave the wait staff low scores but the presentation of the food as well.  They rushed me out as quickly as possibly because they were upset.    Do not go here unless you have no where else to go:-(",

Since it had been so long, I  needed a long time to look over all the things on the menu.  I was thinking of not doing a burger, but in the end, that's what I ordered.  I ordered the Miyagi-san's burger--Chili Mayo, Fried Egg, Furikake, Caramelized Bacon, and Crispy Onion Rings.  I got an order of salt and pepper garlic fries.    While I had been looking over the menu, my server brought me an iced tea.  The burger came and I asked for a knife.  There's the burger on the bottom topped by a fried egg,  caramelized bacon, and four onion rings.  It's quite a stack and needed to be cut in half to eat properly.  It was an excellent burger.  The fries had lots of lightly fried garlic.  I did put a bit more salt on the fries but that's my taste.  I'm glad I made this stop.  I'm in that plaza enough.  Six years was too long!",

    "text": "Far East comes to America to conquer the burger!  Sweet juicy burgers covered with melted cheese, infused with a zing of deliciousness from the Far East! Some of the tantalizing spices that will pass over your tongue when you explore this new cuisine.  The burger that includes all of the seven deadly sins. Are these claims True? Let me wet your senses at the end you decide. Bachi Burger is this local flavor that one must experince.  The menu is infused to explore flavors that one never knew could exist together. This exciting menu adds a bit of flare to most dishes that are usually blah. One of my favorites and must tries is the Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries! These are the famous fries that put Bachi on the map literally. Guy from the travel channel show \"Diners, Drive in's & Dives,\" visited this place with \"his boys,\" loved the tremendously unique concoction. The rest was the lights, glitz, and camera glam. This impressive mix takes the traditional chili which is sweet and saucy poured over fresh cut fries. Jalapenos complete the look of this delicious plate with fresh cilantro, garlic aioli, and green onion all placed selectively with ample coverage. The variations of these wild greens evoke a sense of freedom when munching them down. If these fries could not be any better;an egg is the centerpiece to finish and complete your tango with the oxtails.   One can appreciate the health my benefits of their appetizers choices. Many selections are so unique curiosity peeked its head with the appetizer dish called: Not Your Dill Pickles. No dill anything here. It's fresh veggies that are pickled in house with a delicious variety of carrots, beets; house selections. These are an awesome attempt to deliver such variation. A must try are the brussel sprouts which are flavored with Asian pear. These are native to Japan, so there is that far off mix spin. Once you have had these succulent pears you will demand only this variety. These pears are sweet but tangy! That tangy Asian pear sauce is a sticky sensation is a wonderful compliment to the smoked bacon. Soy sauce is the piece de resistance. These wild rides are the appetizers Imagine how the burger tastes!  Finally, burger time! Bachi leaves the topping and burger size to the guest. Many wonderful choices are available for those specific specialty type burgers. Staying with with the classics was the route I went dressing that 7oz patty with Swiss. Cheese, bacon, and an egg are an extra charge. As burgers come out of the kitchen the allure grows and builds. My mouth waters and time draws near to when it's my turn. Success my server sets the burger in front of me with the steak knife to the side. My senses are tingling it's time to complete the process. As I cut into the burger, it's smooth as those juices run down the plate. The aromas that come from the middle are overwhelming. The burger is so soft that it melts in your mouth. The brioche bun cradles that burger with Swiss as I eat away. It's temptations are now a memory that I share with you. Come experience the happiness that a burger at Bachi creates.  The environment that Bachi has created for your burger enjoyment feels fun, fresh, and modern. The colors are a warm industrial style with that modern technological touch. The crew is happy and youthful. The cuisine is ridiculously delicious. The healthiness of the menu is a great way to enjoy a night out but, without all that heaviness of American type food causes. The Asian fusion adds that delicate balance. The drinks lean towards both Asian/American mixtures. The Sangrias are this delicate balance with matcha teas, fresh fruits that are added to one of their flavors. The Red Sangria is a raspberry flavor combination pairing with Rose. So unique. The Peach Sangria is much lighter than the Red in my opinion.   Savor in the sweet delights that Bachi has created. Their burgers are a memory that will haunt you until you savor another and another. Come and have a good time with the crew here at Bachi. The atmosphere is very trendy but laid back. Relax and have a drink, then be entertained by the oxtails. Finish with a raise to your glasses to brilliance in burgers!!",

I used to live down the street and ordered take out seriously at least once a week and gained 30 pounds by doing so, ha.   I ordered the Miyagi burger and truffle fries which is the order that I've never strayed from, and was disappointed to say the least. The burger was undercooked from medium to medium rare which isn't that big of a deal to me, but know a lot of people would freak out over that. It was also drenched in the sweet sauce and killed every other flavor in the burger for me. The fries were the same as I remembered but the truffle sauce was awful and it didn't come with the tomato aioli I used to love. For $7.00 you expect a little more from fries.   The whole experience was just underwhelming as I wanted something satiating and amazing and I remembered them always hitting the spot. Maybe it was my error from straying from the usual Windmill location, but I don't think I'd be willing to go out of my way to come back.",

The oxtail chili cheese fries were a bit heavy, and we could have gone without them, but their flavor was so addicting. I had Kiki's Burger, which was equally sweet and salty. The mushrooms were my favorite part of this burger, as well as the buns because they also provided a little bit of sweetness. The Ronin burger is also delicious, with the coleslaw adding a nice contrast to the patty.   All in all, high quality burgers",

First, I wonder how different it tastes from their Angus blend as I didn't find the beef overly tender.  That said, the flavor was awesome.  I flattened it as I like them thin versus towering monstrosities, so much delicious spice broth oozed onto my plate.    The caramelized bacon were in strips, Unfortunately, I thought it was some sort of relish.  $15...mmm...kinda pricy; I recommended the build-your-own Angus for a much better value play.  The pineapple ice tea was delish.    I was the only customer at around 4 p.m., so a great time if you want to avoid the crowds.  Staff was very cool.  I usually mention parking, but this is Vegas and not Portland, so there was plenty.",

At a medium rare, the burger was oozing with flavor. Extremely happy with the burger especially after climbing a mountain.  There are a lot of beverages here including beer, hard cider, wine, sake, cocktails, milk teas, and tea. For some reason I went for a sangria AND matcha green tea. The sangria was tasty and pretty stiff. The tea though was a bit watered down, but you do get unlimited refills of this. After that scrumptious burger, I did opt for the Portuguese donuts with coffee gelato for dessert. The donuts themselves weren't anything special and a bit dry and I wasn't a fan of the 'gelato' since I didn't think the it paired very well. Still that mixture of hot and cold is hard to pass up.  Bachi Burger is very unique to Vegas only, so it's a must stop if you're from out-of-town. I sense that the locals think it's whatever, but for what it's worth, I thought the burgers certainly were one of a kind!",

We watched a movie at the Village theaters and this place was right next door so it was convenient because we were all starving. My nephews and I ordered the Miyagi burger (wagyu hamburger patty, over easy egg, chili mayo, crispy sweet bacon, and onion rings)...this burger was amaaaaazingly delicious. My wife ordered the Lonely Bird (ground chicken and turkey) with pesto sauce)...according to my wife, it was very flavorful. My oldest son ordered the Ronin burger (angus beef with Japanese cole slaw, onion rings, and sauce) and my youngest ordered the kids cheeseburger..they both loved their burger. My brother-in-law ordered the Kiki burger (angus beef, mushrooms, sauce, cheese, and crispy bacon)...according to him, he thought it was yummy. For sides, we also ordered the famous oxtail chili cheese fries, salt/peppered garlic fries, and pork belly steamed buns. They all were very flavorful. Although the oxtail flavor was overpowered by the chili in my opinion. For drinks, we ordered Thai tea and their restaurant favorite, the Plantation iced tea. The were yummy. We aren't even burger peeps, but we enjoyed every second of it.  The parking lot is huge and is shared with other establishments in the area. Our waitress, Elaina (I think that's how you say her name lol), was friendly and helpful. She recommended a lot of the meals that we ordered tonight. Overall, it was a bit pricey for burgers in my opinion, but the flavor was amaaaazing. Like I stated earlier, we're more of a plate lunch kinda guy so offense to any burger lovers lol. Our tab tonight was about $145.",

I ALWAYS start with the oxtail chili cheese fries which is a generous portion of French fries topped with the most amazing chili , a fried egg , and jalapeno. Once you cut the egg and let the yolk cover everything buckle yourself in for a tastebud take off.   For burgers I get the Lonely Bird. This is a mixture of turkey and chicken grilled and caramelized to perfection. It comes with 3 onion rings and a herb pesto perfect for dipping.   None of the burgers come with fries and there are different types you can order. I always get the truffle fries with their pineapple ketchup (soooooo goooood).   It seems like every time I go I always get served by someone that doesn't seem like they want to be there but I can look past that for the amazing food !!!!",

We also had their vanilla milkshake in between which was BOMB. I've been craving a milkshake so it was just really amazing. They put like cinnamon or something on top of it that tastes amazing mixed in.  I had the Kiki burger which came with a nice glaze of one yummy sauce on the meat, mushrooms, bacon I believe. I wasn't paying attention too much to detail honestly, when foods that good you kinda lose focus. But very fair to say it HIT THE SPOT. My fiance got a Wagyu beef burger and just added some toppings of his own. They have  Shisito peppers which he's loves. By far some of the best burgers we tasted.   We payed about $50 for the two of us, more than we expected to pay for burgers but the quality of the food was an exception we fairly made.",

Zach was our server and gave great help in picking what to order. He did not disappoint and neither did their chef. Our burgers came out medium (perfectly pink) and juicy.   I don't eat bread often but these buns are to die for...   Truly the best cooked, full of flavor burger I've had in a long a$$ time.   We also ordered the oxtail chili fries to start. YUMMY   100% customer satisfaction. Thank u",

And while I was a little tempted to order something different this time (was looking into getting either the Bachi Fish, Banh Mi Burger, Tsukune Burger), I ended up getting my all-time favorite burger, The Kiki's Burger once again!  Kiki's Burger -- <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2lhHfbU&s=01d824a2ae86ca2eb039a2e8e5adf8cb5aeb5fceabd6c40952a1a4b920594a0d\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/2lhHfbU</a> Angus Beef, Sauteed Shiitake, Enoki & Eryngii Mushrooms, Caramelized Bacon, Sweet Onion Marmalade, Gruyere Cheese, Garlic Chili Aioli It really is hard to resist!  The combination of the mushrooms with the bacon just add a serious amount of umami flavor to the burger.    I also ordered their Salt & Pepper Garlic Fries -- <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2lg9CY4&s=e2a460dd99794b162ae2018c4c9f79a080d8f084fdd4d074081d1a7d52cb6b23\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/2lg9CY4</a> No complaints with these fries.  Nice and crispy, garlic not too overpowering and the jalapenos added some heat.  It's really too bad there's not a Bachi Burger in the Bay Area where I'm from.  I think they could do very well there.  Plus I can go more often to try their other burgers and sandwiches.  But for now, it'll just be something I can build anticipation for whenever I go back to Vegas.",

I substituted one of their aoli's instead of tartar sauce which was a tasty option. They still have some kick ass french fries! The truffle Parmesan fries are awesome. I was slightly disappointed that they change the sauce that comes with these. They gave me a dark brown mushroom type sauce which was not very good. The kids meal is a great option for the little ones. It came with a burger, fries and a small icesundae. This is still a great place to come for an awesome upscale burger or sandwich!",

There were only 5 people working this evening and customers were standing at the \"Please wait to be seated sign\" for at least 20 minutes.  The staff should at least seat people instead of letting us stand there unacknowledged.  Multiple parties waiting left unhappy but we decided to stick it out.  Even with the kitchen and staff backed up, the food came out in a decent amount of time though.  Here is what we ordered:  1) Kiki's Burger - I love the mushroom and aioli flavors paired with the gruyere cheese and caramelized bacon.  2) Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries - I loved everything about these fries!  The oxtail was so juicy and the fried egg on top was a great addition!  It was worth the try!  I'm sad a lot of the California locations have closed but it was worth visiting it this trip!",

Our maitre d' Alina is most pleasant and entertaining to our needs. She is well educated on the full menu and provided insights on what to order.   On the table:  Plantation iced tea!!!! Home brewed tea infused with mint mixed with pineapple juice. It was the right amount of sweet and mint flavor tea! Thanks for handmaking our drinks Alina...best service ever!  Spicy miso on wagyu patty.   First time biting into a wagyu patty and I must say there is a marked difference.   Food for thought: the meaning of wagyu translates to japanese cow. The patty originates from any of four Japanese breeds of beef cattle. The cattle undergo a process called marbeling in where they are fed a high energy diet which contains corn and barley thereby producing a marble pattern carcus yielding intramuscular fat that provides a good amount of fat to lean ratio.   The result...the meat tasted juicy and lean. Every bite had a filling sensation and a creamy texture. The spicy miso sauce is spicy indeed. The sweet bread balanced the spice and the egg gave the burger that wet texture to mix in with the balance of sweet and spicy flavor. The size was a good bread:patty ratio both more than a mouth full. I would have licked my plate clean but my mouth was on fire. The burger holds True to its given name: \"Spicy\".   Pair this entree with oxtail fries which is a blend of beans, jalapenos, oxtail meat, bacon, and a cocktail of spices.   The overall meal gave me a belly boner! Hats off to the chef! It would be a crime to not join the culinary experience that only Bachi burgers can deliver.",

I got the Meatless burger, with truffle fries and my boyfriend got the Turkey burger and sweet potato fries. We also got a bowl of garlic edamame with truffle oil to start- which wasn't very garlicy, or truffley, so it wasn't worth the extra dollar in my mind.  The Meatless burger was not the best I've ever had- but it sure as hell was the most invent! You get two types of veggie burgers: patties made of a mixture of veggies, or a 'patty' of a vegetable (mushroom, eggplant).This burger had a base patty of rice and beans and other veggies, but also had a thin slice of tofu and eggplant, both breaded and seasoned, which gave it a very different dynamic. The flavor was good, but mostly just sweet and sour tangs- I didn't taste much in the veggies or the tofu.  My boyfriend liked his Turkey burger, but wasn't impressed with his sweet potato fries. My truffle fries on the other hand were really good, and the sun dried tomato sauce they come with is ADDICTING!   This place turned out to be cheaper than other gourmet burger places we have been to.",

    "text": "Damm this was a tasty fusion burger!  I was expecting Bachi to be overrated.  I read reviews about how it was over-priced but most of their burgers are $10 and for the quality and unique fusion of all of the fresh asian ingredients, it's great value.  I got the Ronin burger which came with caramlized onions, cole slaw, fried egg, a yuzu sauce, and the BUN.  If you're familiar with the buns they use for the chinese bbq (Cha Siu Bao), this is the bun.   Sweet, soft, and heavenly.  Now only if I were 10 years younger and they had these buns Fudrucker's size, I'd be going to town!  All the ingredients are in perfect harmony.   In addition I had the parmesean truffle fries and the famous oxtail chili cheese fries.  The chili was no the sweet side - I would prefer some more heat but still very delish.  Be sure to flip the egg to get that runny yolk all up in your fries with the garlic aioli.    If you're looking for a different burger experience and don't wanna shell out $20+ for on the Vegas strip, come check out Bachi!",

I love a good burger, but the ones we had were both just ok. The menu descriptions sounded really fantastic,  and having seen this place on Diners Drive Ins and Dives I had really high hopes.  We were totally underwhelmed.  Also our server was nice but not incredibly friendly or helpful. Also the couple next to us had some questions about the menu and she was of zero help to them.   If we could get the fries for take out we might consider it, but otherwise we won't be back.",

I drool just reminiscing about the Miyagi and the Kiki.   However, the oxtail chili cheese fries didn't taste as amazing as i hoped it would, not that it wasn't good, it just didn't seem to be as special as some hyped it to be. Service was also a bit on the slower side for it not being busy.   O well, I still love you regardless",

How can you be short staffed on a Saturday afternoon?!  Sat down after a 20 minute wait. Ordered chili fries (came after 10 minutes, tasty) and 3 burgers. The burgers didn't come until an hour later. I'm not exaggerating, we literally marked the time we sat down until we had a burger.   It wasn't just us, we commiserated with people around us to determine who would get their burgers next.  One kid next to us was almost in tears and screaming \"I'm hungry!\"  This is obviously a problem w/ the management, not the wait staff. Being short staffed on a Sat afternoon and taking an hour to make a burger is a huge problem.",

    "text": "After a disappointing experience at Fleming's where I wanted hubby to try their brioche burger, we went to plan B and hit the foodie jackpot.  3 fabulous experiences in a row (see my other 2 reviews at JW Marriott n Hash House A Go Go) We heard about Bachi Burger on Triple D.  And yes, I have to say these burgers are off the hook!  For starters, we ordered the oxtail n chili over fries.  Yum.  Then, I ordered the signature banh mi (Vietnamese fusion) burger and hubs got the spicy miso burger.  Kiddo ordered the grilled cheese.  Hubs stated he could tell the beef was really fresh, not frozen.   I tried a bite of the spicy miso burger which was very delicious.  However, one bite of the banh mi burger and I was in foodie heaven.   The crunch of the bean sprouts and mint leaves gave it a unique freshness parallel to cilantro in salsa.  If you're a fan of pho, check it out.  The service was friendly.  Chris was super nice and our food arrived timely.  The decor is industrial, modern and clean.  There's a certain warmth to this place.   For sure, we'll be back or may check out the original location.   I can't wait for this place to open in L.A.!",

Everything I've tried has been great but I'm willing to keep at it and try more menu items until I've exhausted all possibilities.  You gotta appreciate that they started here in Las Vegas. Usually we import culinary talent and restaurants, but here's a good example of us exporting it.  Side note: the steamed bao sandwiches are yummy but are best as an appetizer and not an entree. They are more like 3 mini bao tacks than a sandwich. Luckily we over ordered so I wasn't expecting that to fill me up.",

Any time it's on the menu you almost have to order it. This place does a great combination of all the flavors in the dish. Oh n baby jesus they put an egg on it. (of course they do)  Banh-Mi-Burger  I was pretty much sold before i got to this burger but man their presentation and flavor profile they put in is amazing. Good Angus beef and all the sauces do it justice.   A must go if your within a tank of gas!!",

    "text": "Bachi Burger is hands down has the best tasting burgers I've ever eaten at a restaurant. What is it that I love about Bachi Burger? The fact that I can have Wagyu patty burgers with any of their superb combination of toppings. So why am I giving it 4 stars? Its simply because the food is very pricy for what you get. Don't get me wrong, the portions are reasonably sized; however, the amount you pay for what you're getting and the amount you're getting is a bit unbalanced. You pay roughly $14 for a single burger with no sides included and you pay roughly $5 for fries with a truffle sauce. So your meal of burger + fries already comes out to be $19 not including tip+tax or drinks/dessert.  But enough of the bad, this restaurant lives up to its reputation in terms of food + service. I've always been professionally served by my waiters and waitresses. They are kind and always attentive the few times I've been here. The food has always been consistently good too. I usually ask for medium-rare to medium depending on my mood and my burgers have always come out perfectly every time. I also love the blends of flavor that they created in their menu. I usually have a hard time deciding what my palate wants when I read their menu. The ambiance is also nice here. The atmosphere is not too loud, although I was seated by one noisy table once. The seats are comfortable and they usually have ESPN/Food Network playing on their televisions.  All in all, if your wallet can afford Bachi Burger, I highly recommend it. Its a great treat to take yourself and a date to every once in a while.",

Service was good but expect a wait...the system they are applying to seat ppl will is weird cuz there would be empty seating but it would not get filled when another table leaves. I guess it's to keep the order load to a certain level. The steam bun sliders are very good, but I prefer the pork ones. The oxtail fries I thought was okay....chili seems to over power the oxtail so it wouldn't have matter if oxtail was in there or not. I would prefer the mushroom truffle fries and those are Delicious. A must for me when I'm in Vegas.",

I got the Kiki Burger and my other half got the Kalibi Burger.    There wasn't too many people at the restaurant but I think they were understaffed?  We had our waiter stop by and apologize for the service and that it will take a few minutes for our food.  Good thing is they did comp us another set of Salt and Pepper fries for the wait...although the second batch wasn't as tasty as the first.  They had more cilantro in the second batch than they did in the first.  Kiki Burger - it was okay.  Nothing really too good about it but nothing bad either.  I tried it for the mushroom, I was in a mushroom mood.  I did like the kimchi from the Kalbi Burger (it was served on the side in a little dish).  I didn't get to try that burger.  Overall the food was okay, was told the one on Windmill is better.  Wouldn't come back only because the service took forever...an hour to wait for food is a little much, they did apologize, and I'm sure it's an \"off\" day...  OH also tried their Lychee Milk Tea.  Not the greatest...more like Milk Tea than Lychee.",

They have a nice selection of beers and ciders, however the last time we went there, all the Dogfish Head's were out as well as some other Japanese beer I wanted to try, so that was a bummer, and instead I ordered the same Apple cider I have already had in the past.   The burgers are yummy. I've tried the Ronin Burger and Kiki's Burger, both were pretty darn de-lish. We've ordered the Jalapeno fries which were friggin' amazing, only weird thing is that both my boyfriend and my mouth were tingling and numb afterwards. It wasn't a bad thing, just completely odd. I sort of liked it though.  The Summerlin location seems to have a bigger and perhaps a better menu, so for dessert we tried the Portuguese donuts (Malasadas) and some almond shake. Both were pretty good, however I will say that I have had better Malasadas, but seeing as those are limited around town, it's whatev.",

I don't think I'll be coming back after reading one reviewer having issues getting a $1.50 cole slaw removed from their bill.

I really like plain old burgers and cheeseburgers like 5 Guys and In N Out, etc., but for a really excellent gourmet burger treat, this place is super!!! Will be back...repeatedly.",

I was assured both times that nothing was charged until I came in with the card. Found out after the fact that they DID charge me twice. When I complained, they finally managed to figure out how to get me a refund and a weak apology. Other than rightfully getting back what was taken by them, there was no real attempt to right my negative impression or earn my future business.

We stopped in for a weekday lunch. There were only a couple other tables with customers. Service was fast, friendly and helpful. She answered all our newbie questions and patiently waited for our decisions. I decided on the Miyagi-san burger since I wanted to try their Wagyu beef. I had it cooked medium to their recommendation. I loved the bun! I think my burger and egg were over cooked. So my burger was a bit dry and I was hoping for a nice runny yolk egg on my burger. It was tasty but not all that special. I had a bite of my husbands burger which was had an Angus beef burger and we both agree it didn't seem any different from my more expensive beef. Disappointing. My husband got the Spicy Miso burger also cooked to their recommendation, his burger and egg were cooked better than mine. It was an interesting burger, good taste. My husband wished it was spicier, he thinks the egg made it bland. We shared some Truffle Parmesan fries, they were okay. Again nothing special. The fries were nice and crispy and not greasy, but not a lot of taste. I liked the Porcini cream on top but there wasn't enough, I didn't care for the Sun dried Tomato AiolI dip. My husband had the complete opposite feeling on the sauces. The prices are pretty similar to other gourmet burger places in town. I'd go back if some one wanted to go, but I wouldn't go out of my way to go back. I would definitely order something else, there are some yummy sounding selections on the menu.",

I've eaten at the Bachi Burger in Henderson. also crowded and very busy. but in Henderson, the serving staff was friendly and welcoming. The waitress we had in Summerlin was almost hostile from the moment we sat down. The restaurant was very noisy, so it was hard to hear what was being said by the folks at the other end of the table. Our Kiki burger was very good. we also ordered the duck sliders to share. They came on a bao. While the bao was good, the duck was not. The fries were ordered to be made crispy. They were not. None the less, the sweet potato fries were outstanding as were the truffle fries. So the 4 star rating was for the high quality burger and the excellent fries. I couldn't give a 5 star rating due to the rude server and the noise (a pity since it it next door to my favorite movie theater). I will go back to the Henderson Bachi Burger, not the Summerlin location.",

We expected it to be popular since it was on Triple D.   Our server was very nice and accommodating.  The atmosphere was a little loud but not obnoxious. The table full of kids next to us was annoying... SMH!   Food...   the burgers were very flavorful and we really enjoyed the fries. Both were cooked as we requested and all in all.. it was a nice experience.  I would recommend this place to others. Well worth a visit if you want to enjoy a great burger with a variety of flavors.",

(And I'm risking the wrath of crazed throngs of Umami burger fans by saying that!)  I had the  Miyagi burger which was excellent.  I ate the fried onion rings off the top, so when I got to the burger it was largely pristine and it was just great: really fresh, really good quality.  I may be the only person in the world who doesn't like fries, but the others told me they were really good and tasted almost grease-less.  My only issue was it took them a long time to bring the beer I ordered.  The appetizers arrived.  No beer.  We almost finish the appetizers.  Still no beer.  Finally someone (not our waiter) notices us looking around and gets it straightened out but I mean, how long does it take to pour a draft beer?",

We tried a couple of their specialty drinks that included Sake.  Pretty good!  For lunch there was a variety ordered among our four.  I had the \"Just Fries\" with sea salt and a homemade pineapple ketchup.  (YUM!), and a bunless (Im GF) burger patty with swiss and avocado.  So good!  Among the rest of my group we had the grilled sausages appetizer plate, the handmade crispy onion rings, truffle parmesan fries, and a couple more burger varieties that I didnt get to try due to the GF issue).  Every single thing placed on our table was fantastic.  One of my companions had eaten here on a previous visit through the area and loved the oxtail fries, as well.    I think the only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 was our server.  She was nice, and friendly, and pretty quick... but each time we asked her opinion of something, or to explain the preparation a little she put a menu in front of us and walked away.  Obviously we had already read the menu (online while we were en route, and again at the table once seated)... I was looking for a better explanation, or an opinion on these items.  The food was great enough, that I would come back again, however, and give it another try!",

    "text": "My Mom's cousin had seen this restaurant on the Cooking Channel so many times she was thrilled to finally try it!  This review is based on the impression of all four of us.    I uploaded a photo of some of the decor.  They have cool Asian themed backlit panels on the wall with large screen TVs.  Black tables with a line of black booths dividing the dining room in two.  The black painted ventilation shafts against the ceiling lined with halogen track lighting and hidden speakers give it a slightly industrial feel.  The rest of it feels like pre-club trendy.  I dug it but others in the party thought the alt rock was out of place and the spotlight effect due to the angle of the lighting was distracting.    The waiters and servers were all very nice and knew their product.  We ordered the Kiki, Ronin, Banh Mi and Lonely Bird sandwiches... and the oxtail chili cheese fries.  The $11.50 price tag on this immense appetizer should have given away the size of it.  Rich piquant chili, sweet beans with a creamy cheese sauce and jalapenos on a mound of tasty fries perfectly cooked and crisp crowned by a sizzling sunny side up fried egg (see uploaded photo).  Loved these!  But then I had no room for anything else!    My party each loved their burgers!  Two managed to finish theirs but the rest of us barely managed half.  I had mixed feelings about my sandwich.  The bread was awesome.  Reminded me of Hawaiian King sweet bread with a beautiful egg white finish.  I don't care for mayonnaise and the sauce they served on the side had a great flavor but I couldn't get past the texture due to aforementioned mayonnaise Fear.  The marinade on the turkey-chicken patty was wayyyyy too sweet for me.  I ended up boxing most of it for my sweet-loving family.  I'm a savory gal all the way!   Good experience, great fries and overall good sandwiches depending on which side of the sweet-savory fence you sit.",

    "text": "After seeing Guy rave about this place on \"DDD\"  and having many yelper friends telling hubby and myself that we needed to try this place I finally gave in. A lot of the reason it took so long to try is because I am not fan of burgers. While hanging out with one of our best-est buddies Joshua G and his wifey we decided to give Bachi Burger a try.  Upon entering there were plenty of tables open but maybe not enough servers or something. The hostess told us as well the customers coming in after us that there would be a small wait so the severs could catch up. After being seated our drink orders were taken right away. I have to say the service here is great. Our server was fantastic.   I knew I wasn't going to order a burger so I took a look at what sides and salads they had to offer. I decided to go junk food style and order some \"Crispy Onion Rings\" priced at $3.50 and \"Salt & Pepper Garlic Fries\" priced at $4.50. The onion rings were pretty good. The fries were good but I sure didn't taste any garlic. Paying extra money to have the garlic fries I do expect it to actually taste like garlic fries. My man ordered a \"Bachi Burger\" and added cheddar cheese and bacon. He did enjoy the burger but not for the price. I feel personally that for the price of the burger it should have came with fries instead of paying separate for them. I don't want to go to a burger place that looks like they just threw a few random *fancy* things on the walls just so they can charge me a la carte for everything. I have no problem paying a la carte for a establishment that enforces a dress code and doesn't have kids running around the tables.   Bachi Burger doesn't taste terrible but is not worth another trip for me. It doesn't have any *wow* factor for the price.",

I have had some fantastic burgers in my life, and while bachi burger is good, it's not my end all be all.  I really like the concept.  They have some great flavor combinations, and I love the creativity.  Don't get me wrong, my burger was good, it just wasn't the best I have ever had.

    "text": "Finally had an opportunity to try Bachi Burger with my boyfriend this evening. When we walked in we were greeted by crystal who did an excellent job sitting us down and explaining the menu. Since this was our first time we had a lot of questions. My boyfriend is on a gluten free diet so we really wanted to make sure they offered something he would be happy with. Crystal recommended a tofu burger for my boyfriend  but still had the manager Juliet come by our table to go over the menu with us and get his specific request for his tofu burger. She really did a stellar job with accommodating his requests and making sure our order was correct . I ended up going with building my own custom angus burger with just onion lettuce and cheddar. When the burgers were brought to us my boyfriend was blown away by how delicious his tofu burger was. He loved the teriyaki sauce that they make in house that was drizzled on his burger. My burger was very well cooked well done, super tasty and very flavorful. My boyfriend ended up getting a tofu burger to go for later. I wanted to satisfy my sweet tooth so I got the salted Carmel milkshake to go . What made the milk shake even more tasty was the toasted marshmallows they put on top. If you haven't tried Bachi burger you have to check it out . I don't feel overly stuffed everything is fresh ingredients and most of the meat is organic. The price point is excellent for an upscale burger. We will be coming back soon ! We enjoyed the dining Experience as well as the customer service .",

We were given water, them asked if we wanted something else to drink besides water. We sat for 30 mins with only water.  Ordered appetizers and our meals. About 30 mins later we got an order of fries, asked which ones they were, the gal had NO idea what they were. Then more fries came out, I said they were to come with the meal and we ordered apps, the server came over and said sorry I forgot to put the app order In, after she told us they would be out in a few mins. So our apps came after our meals came.  We were never asked if we wanted more drinks.  The fastest thing to come was the bill. We were never offered desert. $150 for 6 people is ridiculous for burgers and fries. Food was ok, service sucked.",

However , it took them about 15 minutes to approach our table and ask us for our drink order. I would understand if they were busy running around, but when I see the servers walking around aimlessly or texting/on their cell phones in the kitchen it makes it unacceptable.  It was kind of embarrassing that another family of 4 complained (before I had the chance to) asking where the server was as they had been waiting for 15 minutes as well to get approached.  Once we finally got a server to come to our table we made sure to order all at once so we wouldn't have to wait any longer.  The actual burgers were good. But again we didn't get approached the entire time we ate, or get a refill of our waters, and when the server finally came back I asked for the check and she then asked if we wanted a refill of water...but at that point it was too late and we just wanted to leave. The service was so terrible we definitely won't be coming back. Very bad experience..",

After I saw them on an episode of Triple D, a visit to Bachi was highly warranted during my recent visit last week to Vegas. They're located 7 miles west of the Las Vegas Blvd. on Sahara Ave inside a huge shopping center. Though a little ways from strip, it's not far of a drive and took us about 15 minutes to get here.  We arrived mid-afternoon on Saturday and were seated fairly quickly, waiting only 5 minutes for our table. The place presents a casual, laid-back atmosphere with a modern feel that compliments their unique Asian fusion style menu. You can choose from a variety of gourmet type burgers or simply build your own; and compared to most high end burger joints, prices are reasonable considering the quality of food you receive.  For starters, we ordered the oxtail chili cheese fries and pork belly steamed buns which came highly recommended by our server -  Oxtail chili cheese fries ($11.50) - this top selling item was awesome and delicious. The chili really makes this dish standout so flavorful, sweet and spicy. Using oxtail instead of traditional ground beef adds richness and appropriate texture to the chili, complimenting the light crisp fries. I love the way the egg yolk oozes over the chili when you break into it. It felt like I was eating luxurious French boudin fries. Very savory and exquisite.  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=HzPMWDKQZw-5RjpfUICxRA&userid=M6id0az7Q4wJUZyZHibkTg\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>  Pork belly steamed buns ($10) - Thick cuts of pork belly nestled inside 3 soft pillowy buns and amped up with a boiled egg for the ultimate deliciousness was scrumptious.  The perfect foundation for any great Asian bun. You get a nice balance of sweet and tanginess from Chinese black vinaigrette and hoisin which works well with pork and vegetables.  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=WuQ91GCuI00TwNG_nXNLLA&userid=M6id0az7Q4wJUZyZHibkTg\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>  I've eaten a lot of good burgers and I'm amazed to say that these have got to be the best I have eaten anywhere, including some in LA. The buns on both of these dishes were huge, and presentation was great. We ended up ordering the Bachi and Miyagi-San Wagyu burger which were both well crafted and on point -  Miyagi-San Wagyu Burger ($15) - infused with Furikake seasoning and priced a few dollars more, this kobe beef quality patty was freaking delicious. It was cooked perfectly medium with a nice crust and pink in the middle. Of course, you can't go wrong with a fried egg which to be the norm nowadays. It offers a buttery, rich flavor that makes the basis for any tasty burgers.  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=5KMqeSMu9yyz5gO8BWUR-w&userid=M6id0az7Q4wJUZyZHibkTg\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>  Bachi burger ($13) - It came with standard lettuce, tomato, and red onion. For $4.50 more it was upgraded with apple wood smoked bacon, shredded onions and cheddar cheese ($1.50 each extra for each item). The burger was juicy, tender and so good! Everything held together nicely without getting to messy. Each bite was heavenly.  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=otpbLYzI-V5l-W4fXALoag&userid=M6id0az7Q4wJUZyZHibkTg\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>  To wash it down, we ordered the salted/caramel shake ($6) with toasted marshmallows. It was smaller portion than we're used to seeing (maybe 12 oz glass), but very delicious. They have wonderful selection of craft beers and premium sake, which added to our yummy the dining experience. The 22 oz Sapporo Draft ($6) paired well with the beer and chili fries.  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=KeHL8-6ZQdi9DFKNkyRdmQ&userid=M6id0az7Q4wJUZyZHibkTg\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=IkLn0ClatO7yflj4mqumaQ&userid=M6id0az7Q4wJUZyZHibkTg\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>  All in all, this restaurant did not disappoint. Service was excellent, the atmosphere was cheerful and the food was remarkable. Triple D was dead on with this one. It is a bit out of the way, but definitely worth the drive. We will definitely return.",

It was a very slim Oriental young man and he had a major attitude like he was either stressed out or upset. They were not even that busy. So we ordered the lonely bird and he told us that they're out of that. This is a Friday night and they're out of their turkey / chicken burger that from what I understand is a popular meal. Great management.  We are historically very loyal and great customers. I will never go back to her again",

    "text": "When Bachi Burger opened in my hometown of Los Angeles, it received average Yelp reviews and closed before I could try it. I now see why. The carelessly prepared food fits at this suburban movie theater location, but not in a food-centric district like Little Osaka in West LA.  The pork belly steamed buns were nicely constructed with a savoy cabbage and carrot slaw, slice of hard-boiled egg, and hoisin sauce, but the meat was sloppily inconsistent. Of the three buns served, one had pork that was all meat and no fat, another had all fat and no meat, and another had the right balance (much like the three bears). A 33% success rate might work in baseball's batting box, but not when dining.  I liked the fries in the chili cheese fries, but that was about it. There was too much of the heavily spiced oxtail chili in ratio with the fries and the scant amount of cheese. The chili also showed signs of age. The meat had broken down to almost a paste, the mixture lost its ability to emulsify which caused the excessive amount of oil to separate out, and there was a sour taste like it hadn't been cooled properly from the night before. The fried egg on top didn't fit the dish.  I guess I should have tried a burger and plain fries instead of the fancier sounding appetizers because I incorrectly expected food of greater quality.",

I don't eat pork or red meat - I only eat poultry - so I ordered The Lonely Bird which was a ground chicken and turkey burger. My +1 ordered the wagyu burger with avocado, Swiss cheese, and a fried egg added to it. We also shared the salt and pepper garlic fries between ourselves and that was by far my favorite dish.  The buns were soft and sweet, the meat well cooked, and the added vegetation was fresh and balanced out my burger. I was only disappointed by how long it took my fries to come out. I like to switch bites between burger and fries but by the time my fries came out, my boyfriend was already finished with his burger and  I was half-way done with my mine and already full. Being quite the gluttonous person, I still ate the fries I was waiting for and it was worth the food baby/coma that came afterwards.",

We were expecting some delicious and unique burgers based on all the hype (reviews, friends, etc.) but were extremely disappointed. First off the service was bad. He had a bit of a smart aleck attitude. My girlfriend got the Spicy Miso burger and even though she ordered medium rare she got medium well. No color at all. The egg that came in the burger was overcooked and there was no actual spice in the burger which was misleading by both the menu and server. They switched out our fries twice because they kept bringing us the wrong ones and when my girlfriend asked for honey mustard she got a very sarcastic \"no\" from the waiter.   I ordered the famed Ban Mi burger which I liked. Nothing mind blowing but something new and tasty. Overall we probably won't be returning anytime soon....\"If at all\" my girlfriend adds. In our opinion we will stick with the In n Out staple or the surprisingly tasty Bobby Flay's Burger Palace.",

On my last visit to Bachi Burger, I ordered the Miyagi Burger cooked medium rare. The juicy burger patty was topped with lightly battered and fried onion rings, chili mayo sauce,  and a fried egg -- this was actually what \"made\" the burger. Adding a fried egg to burgers is probably one of the best culinary ideas ever. Also ordered was a side of sweet potato fries with a container of aioli for dipping. I do like the seasoned fries I've ordered in the past, but nothing beats the simplicity of these sweet potato fries.   Bachi Burger is open until midnight. I came here for a late dinner (10:00p.m.). It wasn't busy, but there was a steady flow of diners entering and leaving.",

Like Wylie Dufresne when he meets a perfect egg and Anthony Bourdain when he eats that perfect egg. The moment is in the egg on top, people. On that note, you can add a nice fried egg onto any burger because they're so cool they totally let you add and even substitute. You can also create your own burger which is fun with so much quality ingredients. My man like this option.   Also favorites: The Ronin and The Kiki. But my number one is The Lonely Bird. Or The Bird: a turkey and chicken burger and I add on bacon because their bacon is maple. Not lonely anymore.   Fries are not bad. The dip sauces elevate. Oxtail fries are yummy with potential. These guys are consistent and the burgers are always cooked to your exact order. I've never once had to send my burger back. They're huge towers of fancy by the way, and damn expensive.",

Where to start - if you like fries its just unbelievable. Sweet potato fries are usually kinda soggy but not here - crispy like regular fries. Garlic/asian fries awesome. Everything served with superb asian sauces.  Steamed buns with duck - five stars, best I've ever had, the several filipino friends at the table said the same thing. We all had burgers, again just five stars plus. If you need or want the typical bacon-n-chedder burger with mayo and ketchup (which obviously is great itself) this might not be your place. But if you're looking for what I consider the best burger ever had in Vegas or Phoenix where I,m from this is your place. Six stars!!",

The sausages tasted like the kind you'd get at the grocery store.  I asked my coworkers and they were equally underwhelmed. The general consensus was we wouldn't be going back for lunch.

    "text": "PROS: The service was great and the place was very clean and inviting.  Ordered the oxtail chili fries and kimchi burger.  The portion of the oxtail fries was great, they give you a lot, so you'll definitely be full afterwards.  The kimchi burger also had great sauce and the buns they used tasted great.  CONS: First off, I was turned off by the fact that the oxtail chili fries had barely any oxtail meat in it (but had lots of fries).  For around $13, you'd expect a little more.  If they're trying to save money, they'd might as well use a cheaper cut of meat and give the customer more bang for their buck.  Second, the burger didn't come with fries.  Again, for around $10, you'd expect a little more.  I know this place is supposed to be \"gourmet,\" but I can easily buy a burger of equal quality at Cheesecake Factory and get fries and complementary bread.  Last, the burger was a little on the burnt side.  I don't know if this was the chef's intention or not, but the surface was charred, not carmelized.  The meat was cooked perfectly, but the outside just tasted a bit off.  Maybe I just came at the wrong time.   All in all, I was a bit disappointed in this place. I've been looking forward to coming here for ages.  But I'm not giving up yet, and hopefully the next time I come around it'll be better.",

Since it takes a plane ride to eat here, we made sure to order and share so we could try as many different things as possible. The burgers come on a light and fluffy bun...almost like a sweet bread and are piled high.  I was worried that these would be one of those impossible to bite burgers but once you push the top bun down, it's totally manageable.  Spicy Miso, Miyagi-san's Grass fed Wagyu, Banh-Mi, Kalbi, and Kiki's burger were all sampled.  I loved them all except the Kiki.  I don't know what it was but something just didn't agree with my taste buds.  The burgers mentioned above were so different in flavor that it's impossible to individually review them all.  Just know that they're all good and you'll just need to try them all to find your favorite.  We also tried the oxtail chili cheese fries...delicious!  The shakes are really good too.  I tried the salted caramel marshmallow.  So, SO good.  Everything here is a little on the salty side but I like salty foods.  The wait staff was upbeat and friendly and the wait wasn't that bad.  Maybe 15 minutes. The one and only draw back is I have to get on a plane to eat here again.",

Ok, I did do that. ( Once a server, always a server). The prices are a little high, but I think it was worth it. The music playing reminded me of my visit to the W hotel lounge in NY, but the lighting was like track lighting disaster. They should soften it up in there and put some plants around or something. I wanted to eat an amazing burger, thumble through Las Vegas Weekly drink a couple, make it one beer due to the cost and start my weekend early. I did love the Kiki Burger..perfect medium rare as I requested and yummy sweet caramelized onion jam with a mix of mushrooms and cheese. My $4.00 fries I could have done without. I wanted to take them out of the silly cone display. I ordered the salt and pepper fries which were decorated lightly with fried jalapenos, fresh cilantro, and grated ginger. They were shoestring thin and were luke warm upon delivery before my burger so were kind of cold after a few in. I like thicker fries though.The burger and the BUN was off the hook. If I hadn't spent $5 on a pint I would have spent another $5 on a special milkshake like the one with bacon in it. But, they ran out. Do look at the chalk board as they had a special milkshake of the day: white chocolate cranberry was the one when I came in Valentine's Day week.",

We had 2 order of fries, jalapeno and truffle and burger for each of us.  Halfway during lunch, my husband spit out something while he was chewing on the fries, it was a TOOTH with decayed fillings.  I turned on the flashlight on my phone and started examining my husband's mouth thinking that he might broke a tooth.  It wasn't his.  We called the waitress and showed her the tooth and she said \"ewwwww\".  She took the tooth with her and asked the people who is missing a tooth.  While she was gone, the 3 of us was grossed out and don't want to finish our food.  She came back and told us that she will replace the Fries with no charge  and then later told us that she will take out 10% of our bill.  She explained to us that they order the fries from a place, I'm guessing the fries are not really fresh.  We were just all going to forget what happened. But I think people need to know.  It happened on 10/30 between 1:30 to 2:30. I didn't get the server's name but she was Asian.",

My husband and I shared a burger, oxtail fries and duck bun. They truly know how to perfectly cook the burger to the finest taste. This place is very popular and does get packed really fast. My 1st visit we waited over 2 hours to get seated but now i go after midnight and there is no wait what so ever. It's great that they open till 2am. Every vegas trip from now on Bachi Burger is a must have before we go home.",

What i love about this place is the relaxed and cozy atmosphere, the aroma of the burgers that is truly engaging and inviting whether you are a \"meatatarian\" or vegetarian, there is a burger that would suit you. Their burgers were really cooked to juicy perfection combined with truffles fries and pineapple ketchup on the side, what is there to ask for... Thumbs up!",

Sweet potato fries were great, the salt pepper fries were spicier then expected & also came with cilantro which hubby hates. Ordered the marshmallow milk shake which was pretty good! Only thing it's pretty pricey for a burger joint but I guess equal to a place like Johnny rockets. Also service was good until it got busy then our server was over worked and hardly checked in with us n took forever for the bill.",

Village.....Square is now the new home of The new Bachi burger, and even though I've been at this location to eat many times before, this is my first time at Bachi burger. Yes this is one of those cursed locations where restaurants open and close, raising sun Turned to sunset, route 66 was too slow and others that I can't even remember faded into oblivion.  Is time for something new, learn from the past, classic Hamburgers didn't work, Japanese didn't work, put them together and you get... Bachi burger......... Is that translates to karma burger? If it does, then that's what's coming to me, a nice and delicious juicy burger, cuz I deserve it.  We ordered the fried calamari for appetizer, nothing different from other places, except the dipping sauces and the price, I'll skip them next time. We also had the Bahn Mi burger and the Ronin burger with The truffle Parmesan fries. Both burgers were excellent and the fries delicious. We also had the sangria special by our waitress recommendation, which it wasn't that good, a nice cold beer would've done the job.  Yes! Bachi Burger is good, yes Bachi service is good, yes Bachi place is nice. Is Bachi here to stay? Only time will tell, and if you don't try this place  karma is gonna get you!  A new Roberto's will take over and you would only be able to eat here after  a long night of partying and heavy drinking and your taste buds are gone for the night.",

    "text": "We went here last Saturday night around 7ish and were met with a 30 minute wait. Not a problem, as it appears this is a pretty popular place. Once we were seated and our orders were taken(Kiko(or whatever the one with mushrooms was called) burger with the garlicky pepper fries(again, I forget the real name) for me, kids bachi for the little one, Caesar salad with burger patty for the wife, oxtail chili cheese fries for dad, and whatever mom got), the wait began. After a while(and several others who were seated after us getting their food as we sat hungrily) the server informs us that there was some mix up with the chef, and that he was bringing a free appetizer to apologize. I like the way they handled it, and we especially liked the chili fried chicken they gave us, so I'm not going to tear this place apart in this review. Once the food did come, it looked good and the portions were not bad. The food itself was OK. None of us were wowed(I was actually happy he missed that I'd ordered fries after tasting my mom's, which were the same I ordered), but it wasn't nasty. I guess it was slightly disappointing given the hype(DD&D) and wait(which we somewhat enjoyed in the old school candy and soda store a couple doors over. I do recommend going in here), as it isn't somewhere I will likely return to. The wife didn't particularly care for here either, and dad thought it was just OK. For all the L.A. peeps reading this, I consider it of the same genre(and price range) as Fukuburger(feel free to read my review of that joint), but I think Fukuburger taste a lot better. For everyone else, feel free to try for yourself and see what you think. I will neither recommend nor not recommend this place, so you're on your own.",

    "text": "Hooray!  Bachi Burger, the famous fusion burger joint in town has expanded and landed in the west side of town.  Hearty burgers and delicious sides were calling my name!  Walking in, looks like they've done a swell job of decorating.  It looks modern, clean, hip and still features photography from artists posted on their walls.  Service was snappy, responsive and done with a genuine smile.  On to the food! 1.  Calamari - Bachi Burger has taken this appetizer to a new level.  The bits of squid are fried delicately and they stay crunchy.  Tossed in are bits of mint, grilled cherry tomatoes and slices of grilled lemon, turning the dish into something light and flavor blasted.  The sauces paired were the traditional tartare sauce and a green chili sauce.  What I found was the best flavor combo?  Double dipping the tarter and the chili sauce! 2. Ronin Burger - My Angus Beef was juicy and tender.  The caramelized onions and miso goma dressing enhanced the beef flavor.  The Japanese Cole Slaw added the perfect refreshing crunch and the runny yolk from the fried egg always add a extra bonus factor - GOOEY!.  If the sauces inside weren't enough, I also chose to dunk the burger in the citrus aioli for an extra flavor blast. 3.  Miyagi Burger - Is this a new one?  I'm not sure that I've seen it at the other location, but this tasty as well.  Where the Ronin provided a \"refreshing\" burger (if burgers could be refreshing), the Miyagi provided a \"extra savory\" experience.  It too had a juicy meat patty and a fried egg, but what makes this one stand out is the sea aroma from the furikake.  Mmmm mmmm seaweed bonus. 4.  Truffle Parmesan fries - Of course we need some spuds to go with our burgers!  This is a seriously addicting side dish.  Shoestring fries drizzled with their special concoction of truffle oil and sprinkled with parmesan cheese.  Conclusion:  These past few years have grown in the fusion food world, and Bachi brings it to the next level with the excellent quality of food and service.  They have this new location dialed in!",

Very nice place, clean and new. The staff was very friendly and welcoming. Our server was attentive, and professional.    We started with the house pickle sampler. Very good flavor, and we strongly recommend you try then. Not what we were expecting, and the variety was perfect.   We ordered the sweet potato fries, with the citrus aioli, Yummmmm!!!    We both decided to order a different burger, and split them. My wife ordered the Ronin burger, I ordered the Kiki burger. The flavors were bold, eclectic and the burger was cooked prefect. Both burgers were outstanding, the portion was filling.   We can not wait to return and continue trying different choices. We are returning in a few weeks, and another review to follow. What a great find, and we are so glad to be moving close to this amazing burger find.  Thank you, Captain Cook for the recommendation!!! We're gonna miss you guys.",

    "text": "My husband and I wanted to try something new for date night and I've known about Bachi Burger for years through Yelp as \"one of the best burgers in Las Vegas\" as well as all of my friends constantly obsessing over it. We got here on a Friday night with a 25 minute wait which wasn't a big deal because we just walked over to Patty's closet to kill time. My in-laws said we have to try the salty caramel toasted marshmallow milkshake and we did. I'd say this was the best item of the night! It was a bit overly sweet, but still so addicting.   We then ordered the oxtail chilli cheese fries as our appetizer to share. Upon first bite, I told my husband it was cold. I don't know if they made the fries and chilli and were just waiting for the fried egg to be put on top, but the food was definitely lukewarm by the time it was brought out to us and I like my food super hot, like it was made fresh. There wasn't much oxtail that I could taste and the warmth issue was very off putting. Lastly, we settled for the Miyagi San burger and Ronin burger. I LOVE fusion food, but I was not impressed by the flavors of the Ronin. Something was just missing to make it amazing. I did appreciate the crunch of the coleslaw and the caramelized onions, but all the other flavors cancelled out the taste of the fried egg. My husband's Miyagi burger was much better, but we asked for it medium and it was WELL done. There was no pink or anything, but the taste of the fried egg was amazing and the onion strips were crispy and fried to perfection. Overall, I would say that Holsteins has better burgers for this price range, and to not believe the DDD and Yelp hype. Come try it for yourself, but I don't think I'll be back.",

There were 3 empty tables for 2 on the left side of the dining room and the right side was completely empty. The staff member who greeted us said we would have to wait for a table. HUH?? I pointed out the empty tables to which he replied, \"We do not have enough staff to seat you now.\"  We were about to leave when another waitstaff person came and sat us immediately. Once seated the service was fine, but the food was overpriced and unremarkable. You will be hard pressed to find much oxtail in the salty chili cheese fries and the burgers were nothing to write home about.  PS Why does a half empty restaurant have to have the music so loud that you cannot hear the person across the table from you?",

However, we were EXTREMELY disappointed to hear that they use breadcrumbs as filler on all their burgers except the Wagyu beef.  There is no allergen disclaimer on the menu.  The servers were not very knowledgable on allergy issues.    Anyone who is celiac beware when you order a burger at Bachi that it is not just meat!  SO DISAPPOINTED.

So as far as the food, some of the best burgers I've had. This recent visit was kind of strange. I believe our waitress was trying to be sneaky by casually getting my kids to order extra toppings on the burger. My kids didn't realize that each addtl topping cost $1.50-2.00. She asked my son if he wanted \"everything\" on the burger. He said yes. But I immediately stopped that transaction and politely said that he will only add the cheese. I can only imagine that my bill would've been $20/burger. I don't know if she was annoyed that we only ordered water; thus lowering our bill and her potential tip. I don't know. Only speculating. Well, I will give the service 3 stars, but since the food was excellent I decided to give a 4 star rating. I really do like this place. I was just a little perplexed by her motives.",

I was excited about checking it out! Plus brother had only positive things too say about it.   The menu love because simple not reading novel and they stick too their strength and whole concept of the restaurant. It all about speciality burgers (still have basic burgers for the kids; two nieces got they enjoyed their burger). They have lot too choose from too. I had the Ronin burger, brother had the Miyagi burger, and sister-in-law not remember. Both my burger and brother burger had the fried egg. FRIED EGG and burger are peas in pod or heaven on earth. It done right on from the burger being perfectly cook medium (nice juicy), fried egg another perfection (the yolk ruining just right. fingers get messy), and my burger RONIN combine fried egg too japanese cole slaw, too kalbi sauce.The bun fresh, right size too the patty not over or under, and toasted just right. It reasonable price for high end type of burger. We got sides of sweet fries and skinny fries came with pineapple ketchup (the ketchup only thing not like about the meal; felt like it was way too sweet more like dipping fries in jelly then ketchup). The fries and burgers good eats.  We started with the oxtail chile cheese fries. Talk about prefect appetizers for four or five people. It great! The chili was so good could have order just chili with rice be happy in life. You add the cheese plus fried egg some jalapenos. Layers upon layers of tasty stuff. Get too the bottom still something on top of the fries!!  The atmosphere is great. It brand new location one that never knew about thankfully my brother finds these great local spots! The service our server was great she was very attentive, asked if ever been too Bachi burger, explained the menu throughly, great suggestion with appetizers, checking up on us constant basis, and management walking around asked us about our meal.   If you ever have need for different burger not norm tBachi Burger is DA BOMB! Sure after having Ronin burger makes me want too check out the rest of the burgers on the menu. Sure be seeing me back.",

Both of our burgers were so overcooked they bordered on being hockey pucks. But the worst part was when my friend chomped down on something hard in the burger that we both jumped.  We really thought she had broken her tooth as it was that loud and hard.  The manager was almost in disbelief that it happened. He did comp her burger...although he didn't respond to the hockey pucks being over cooked. Needless to say we were put off food for the rest of the day.",

I love gourmet burgers, but there's something about this place that grosses me out. I love all types of ethnic food, so it's not the Asian twist on the burgers I'm talking about. If you want a delicious gourmet style burger go to Gordon Ramsay Burgr in planet Hollywood. It's about the same price too!",

    "text": "My cousins & I were visiting Vegas over the weekend & we decided to try this place because that episode of Diners, Drive-Ins, & Dives was just haunting us. That goofy, blond guy made all the food seem so good, like best shit you will ever put in your mouth good. So I had high expectations.  We got two orders of Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries to share among the 7 of us & also an order of the Peking Style Duck Steamed Buns as appetizers. We then ordered our burgers and I am glad that I got to taste not just one burger, but three.  Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries ($11.50) - I have an obsession with fries that is pretty unhealthy. But I would not mind clogging my arteries with these fries all day, every day. My mouth is watering right now just thinking about them. The oxtail meat was tender as can be and the chili had a little kick to it which I loved. My cousins and I devoured both orders in seconds. THEY WERE THAT GOOD. Shut up and take my money good.  Peking Style Duck Steamed Buns ($12.50) - It comes with only 3 steamed buns, so my cousins & I just cut them in half. I kinda shoved my half in my mouth so fast that I didn't savor it to the point where I remembered it. I pretty much inhaled it. I remember that it was good though & that I forgot to dip it in the sauce.  ANYWAYS. Onto the good part...  Miyagi Burger ($13) - Ooooh, this burger was good. I only got it because when am I ever going to eat a waygu burger again? Probably never! The patty was medium rare and tender and oh so juicy. The fried egg dripping onto my plate & all over my burger adding an element of flavor and richness to it was the best thing ever. The onion rings were crispy and good. Is your mouth watering yet? Because mine is.  Kiki's Burger ($10) - My cousin ordered this & blessed me with a bite of it. It came with a garlic chili aioli that when spread on the burger before you bit into it tied everything together. The meat was cooked perfectly & was absolutely delicious.  Mr. Ho's Burger ($9.50) - This burger got passed my way so I took a bite. I don't know what the fuck was in it. But it was soooo good. I remember the burger being juicy and sweet.  Overall, the food met my expectations & the service was great. I will be back soon, Vegas, for those Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries. I wants them in my belly. Ugh so good.",

    "text": "Husband: \"Let's go to this new place.  They have Asian hamburgers.\" Me: \"What the hell is an Asian hamburger?\"  Thus began my discovery of the Bachi Burger.  Located in the Village Square on Sahara and Ft. Apache that is trying its darnedest to recover from a slew of closed businesses, I think Bachi Burger is going to be one of the flagship places in that renaissance.  SERVICE: Very attentive.  Also, the host guy who sat us is hot, so that's always a plus.  We had about 4 people who work there come up to us and ask if everything was to our liking.  I really admire that when restaurants have multiple people checking on tables, so you don't have to search out your server if you need anything.  DRINKS: They have some really cool, interesting sodas (that I think are made in house, but not 100% sure on that).  They also have many shakes, and sake inspired drinks.  I did try a glass of the sake-sangria, which I thought was pretty weak.  I wouldn't get that again, but would definitely get one of the before mentioned sodas or shakes on my next visit.  FOOD: Ok, listen.  You need to get the oxtail chili cheese fries.  It's like a piece of art when it comes out, and there is a freaking egg on top like a cherry on a sundae.  Spicy, meaty, tangy, cheesy, and huge (it could feed 4 people easily).  Burgers were top notch.  I got the Mr. Ho's Burger, which came on a taro bun!  What?!?!  I don't know what Taro is, but I went for it.  It had a slight purple tint to it, but was super tasty.  The burger also has a nice heaping helping of mushrooms on it and the Hoisin sauce was on point.  My husband got the Ronin burger and asked for it medium rare, and by God, they made it medium rare perfectly.  Nice and bloody, not overcooked.  VENUE: We went on a Friday night at 7:00 and there was ample seating, which surprised me.  I thought it would be packed.  Maybe people don't realize it's open quite yet?  Fine by me!  That means less of a wait for me to get another delicious Asian hamburger.",

If you go I suggest going with 3 or more people, because the fries is a must to order. (The portion is so big that if you share it between 2 people you'll be full by the time you finish it). Additionally, ALL of their burgers are SO unique that it'd be a waste to just try one. Sharing the burger by splitting it into portions is definitely more worth it. (I tried the spicy miso and Mr. Ho, i would recommend the spicy miso).  Secondly I would order any type of drink because their drinks are very refreshing.",

    "text": "I had the Angus burger and asked for it well done and it was, but still juicy and nicely charred and seasoned. With avocado, it was 3 inches tall and the bun was fast-food caliber, so no way of eating, other than dismantling and using cutlery. My complaints don't pertain to the food. The space is enclosed in plain, smoked glass curtain walls, with no ornamentation, nor architectural features. The entrance is double doors even with the wall and with a tiny sign, so no indication at all of up-scale dining. Walking up, the tinted glass almost obscured any view to inside and I thought for a moment that it might be closed! The impression is that this location for this small chain was opened at minimum cost with the expectation that the chain's rep would ensure success. My other gripe is that the table was wet from wiping down and the seat of the banquette seemed damp as well. The person that seated us had no intention of drying off the table when I mentioned it, but offered us the option of sliding down to the next table.",

    "text": "I had really wanted  to go to this place for such a long time. I think I have been to almost every eatery in this shopping plaza give or take but Bachi Burger was my elusive Triple Crown that kept escaping me....California Chrome I feel your pain.   For a few years I heard that the burgers here were great and it's True. I have been on a personal search for the best burger in LV and Bachi Burger is a bonafide contender.  This is simply a great burger! I chose the Kikis burger and it was smooth as a Ferrari Modena gliding up the PCH... headed for the Strawberry Festival of course. 805 stand up!  I don't know if any other burger has Bachi  Burger's flavor.  It's definitely not a big burger by any means. I could knock down three of them and be looking for number four!  However, size is not a factor here because quality wins you over. First off, the bun is of a superior quality,  baked fresh and brought in daily from an outside bakery.  It shows. The bun is shiny and moist which helps to make the whole burger pop. I usually need something to wash a burger down, but with the Kikis I could've dry dropped it- I mean I could've... but I didn't. I recommend ordering the burger medium well because it comes out perfect. Just enough pink so flavor is not lost with a well done burger. They give you a tasty Aioli sauce on the side but you won't even need it. The burger speaks for itself. The burger is presented very well also. Ordered the garlic fries and was not disappointed. Excellent! They come sprinkled with a good portion of jalapenos on top and are very tasty and they are enough to share.  Service was good. The rap on Bachi Burger has been the long wait times to get your food, however I didn't find that to be the case in our experience and this is serving four adults and two small kids. The kid's grilled cheese looked awesome by the way, garnished with an apple slice with a few carrots. Parking is not an issue here either- you could park a tractor trailer in this lot if you needed to. I hope you don't need to. For this quality of burger the price was not bad. The Kiki's comes in at about 12 bucks. For desert, go next door to Rocket Fizz and go hog wild reliving your childhood with some retro candies and sodas. So the bottom line is that my search for the best burger in Vegas has yielded a top ranked contender here...who else can step in the ring with Bachi Burger?",

My glass had a lipstick stain and was dirty, I asked for a new glass. Instead It appeared I got my same glass back but the rim was wiped off. Sorry but no one likes lipstick stains on their glass! Maybe it was because they were closing soon but that shouldn't mean that their service should go down. I've also been to the location on Windmill and although they're packed quite a bit of the time their service doesn't suffer because of it.",

    "text": "I'm from LA. We went last week on Friday ( 3 of us, after we picked our friend who's local) around 2:00 pm. We were seated immediately, put in our order, got the food quickly, good burger( had better and worse ones). I paid and we left. As walking to my car, I realised I don't have my sunglasses. I immediately walked back (within 40 seconds) and told the host I'm back for my glasses and pointed out were we were sitting (2 tables behind his podium). It was all cleaned ( I'm thinking, WOW, fast service). So he goes to the back towards the kitchen( 4-5 tables away) and talks to couple of people and returns with no glasses. So I doubted myself, I went back to the car and searched with no luck. Went back to the restaurant and asked the host to look again. He went back again, asked and returned empty. He then pulled a square plastic container and pulled a woman's glasses but not mine. He said \"sorry sir, I don't have it and no one in the back has seen ANY glasses. So I gave him my cell and asked him to call if anyone turns it in,and btw, it's PRADA ... $450. But I was so confused now that even asked my friend to we go back to his house and look there. We did, but, NO glasses. We left to gas station. As pumping, I pulled out the receipt and called the number. A lady picked up the phone and after explaining, she asked me the server's name... Haha, I looked at my receipt... \"PHYRON\" I said proudly and with high hopes. \"SORRY, NO ONE has seen any glasses\" she said. By now, frustrated and deeply disappointed,  I got little angry as it was not making sense, so I spoke slightly louder. She immediately said..\"Oh wait a second, your glasses are here\".... I was \"WOW\" I'll be there in few.  I went back. Asked the host and he directed me to the back ( this back area is not enclosed, it's visible and open to everyone). A lady/waitress??  working on the monitor pulled my glasses from \" a square plastic container\" and gave me my glasses. I asked to see the manager and me. PEREZ??, I think, young tall guy approached who so happened  to be in the back right next to her.  I explained to him the situation and asked him why my glasses we not found shortly after my table was cleaned, since sun glasses do not end up with the utensils , and why did I have to come back twice , call , then come back the third time. Even thought from my seat to the host and to the back is oh 40 feet. He said he doesn't know and it was a miscommunication issue at the LOST AND FOUND DEPARTMENTS. REALLY??? ..... Read that again. Man, were was I , at a department  store?? Wow, I felt lost in their lost and found department. He forgot my table was 30-40 feet from his DEPARTMENT , not 30-40 floors.  I told him that was not cool....He said HE WAS SORRY THAT I FELT THAT WAY.... With a careless posture, standing tall, hands behind his back , and looking up then down with no eye contact to me....Amazing!!!!!! He didn't even apologise for their mistake!!!! What an unprofessional manager. And btw, I mentioned my bill with 20% tip. He asked me to come back and he would give us better service . Better service???? Shouldn't the service be at best to begin with???? I didn't know what else to tell him and left.   Everyone, I'm not a difficult customer and I tip well.  I think who ever cleaned the table was VERY AWARE of the glass and didn't bring it out till perhaps found out that I was not giving up.  I just think managers like him who work in good restaurants MUST be more courteous to their patrons and always remember, there is YELP and other social media reviews. If they care. We are going back this weekend to Vegas again. Wish he was pleasant and professional, i  would've recommended my friends( this time 16 of us) to go back and eat there again. Well, to be even FAIR, I hope the management reads my review and replies.  4 star for food,the chef, and the front host.    1 star for the manager, waiter, and the bus-boy if there was one.  For now, I'm glad they didn't get the chance to steal and keep my glasses.",

I was a bit scared of the oxtail, too exquisite, but it was okay. a bit sweet. To compare, not as good as carne asada fries or the fries from buldogis. - Burger was made medium and was very juicy and flavorful. It was also too sweet for me.  - Bun came from in-n-out? haha - AHEM...water please? haha - Overall, the fusion was a bit strange. okay concept. I'd prefer just American or Korean fusion, but it's a good try for once. do it!",

    "text": "I have been to Bachi- both the Summerlin and the Green Valley locations quite a few times now. Either my husband or I usually gets a severe Bachi craving at least once a month, and then only Bachi will do. Between us we've tried every burger on the menu, with the exception of the crazy-spendy Shogun, which I think will call for a special occasion, and we've settled into almost ritualistic favorites.  The Ritual: - If I'm at Windmill, I will start with the Yuzu-Cherry soda, Summerlin, beer. - Then salt and pepper fries with those glorious little jalapenos, so perfectly crispy and salty and share-able. - Then I order the Kiki Burger, which is pretty much my favorite burger of all time. Juicy, sweet, and just the right level of sloppy. Mushroom heaven.  - My husband orders the Spicy Miso burger, and eats it in approximately six seconds and moans softly to himself in joy.  The prices are a bit on the high side for a \"burger joint\", but Bach isn't really that, so don't go with that expectation. It's more of a unique local \"nice, but lower key\" bistro or something. It is one of the Go-to places both my husband and I drag our foodie friends and family when they fly in to visit, and it always gets rave reviews.   I personally think I like the Summerlin location a bit better (except they need the cherry-yuzu soda. seriously.) I've feel as though I've just had my burgers a little bit better put together and more well cooked there.   I've never had anything I didn't like there, other particular favorites were the Ronin and the turkey burger I can't remember the name of, but we just like that order so very much it's hard to deviate. When I go to Bachi, it's explicitly for that glorious mushroom-y Kiki. Mmm. Now I need to go to Bachi.",

The staff super friendly and on point! Mad props Bachi crew! The food here was just as awesome as the original location. This time i went with the Mr Ho Burger and let me tell you, the mixture of that burger was amazing. Cooked medium well but still flavorful and juicy! The bun when you see it might look a little odd if your not used to that kind of thing but that taro bun blends so well with the flavors of the beef and pork burger mixture. To add there is diced Lup Cheong Sausage in there as well! This is by far my new fav burger. If your from Hawaii you would feel right at home and i felt right at home haha. The deserts are another thing to add to this place. SO GOOD! You just have to go down and try it for yourself!  The prices are decent, there is abundant parking in the lot and as for a wait, i guess we went a little late so there was none but every time i go to the original on windmill location im stuck waiting. This is a def place to hit up if your down to try fusion styled burgers, and fries!!! BACHI!!!!!!!",

Once we finally sat down though, things got better.  We shared their brussel sprout appetizer and oxtail chili cheese fries, both of which were very tasty. The actual burgers are massive, and two of us could have split one burger.  I tried bites of the Ronin burger and the Pork Belly Bao.  I enjoyed all the fusion flavour combinations.

I fueled up on coffee and was feeling jolly enough to even pick up my co-workers orders. I knew we had food coming in for lunch at work so I wasn't too concerned with that. My main concern was dinner. What to eat for dinner?     Bachi Burger.     For those of you who are unaware of what this is don't worry; I'm about to drop some knowledge on you like you've never heard before. Actually, it's pretty simple. It Asian fusion brought to the all American favorites. It's as if a cheeseburger has relations with a geisha and they had a child. It's an amazing combo that I need more of in my life.     I text my buddy Dave and it was on. Dave and I have a love for food that can only be examined on a neurological level. When I text him, he was already preparing the same text o be sent to me. It's like we have ESPN or something, a 5th sense if you will (that's a Mean Girls reference, I'm well aware ESP is considered the \"6th sense\"). We made plans to meet at 8 and as I backed into my spot I discovered I had even parked directly next to him without even knowing. It's a food friendship made in heaven.     Anyways, we made our way in and did everything in our power to make it non-look like a Grinder meet up (that's the gay Tinder). In his words, it was a \"gentlemen's gathering over fine foods.\" Right off the bat he knew what he was getting as he had spent time on Yelp prior to the meet up. It took me a little more time.     When the waiter arrived, we ordered like two kids recently kicked out of fat camp. I ordered the Ronin Burger with a side of Parmesan Truffle Fries. He ordered the Banh Mi Burger with a pickle plate on the side.     Now, the Ronin burger was the tits. In fact, it probably will be one of those burger I look back and tell my grand kids about. Dave's First bite of the Banh Mi was also love at first bite. After the first bite he concluded it was the best he's ad n his time in Las Vegas. The Ronin was made with Angus Beef (miso glazed), Asian slaw, caramelized onion, miso goma dressing, Katsu BBQ sauce, a fried egg and a Yuzo Citrus Aioli. Fuck me right? And Fuck me it did, right in the mouth. It was amazeballs right down to the bun it was served on. The best part, it stayed in tact the whole time. This is one of the most over looked concepts of a good cheeseburger. If it falls apart, it could be the best burger in the world but it would get points taken off because it was over topped. The Banh Mi was something only a mad genius could dream up. It also had the Miso glazed Angus but came with Pork-Shrimp Lemon grass Pate, curry aioli, pickled veggies and nuoc nam sauce. It was similar to the scene in Step Brother where Rob Riggle can't stop saying \"POW! Right in the Kisser!\"     The truffle fries were on point. I had the pleasure of having these once before and the second time was no let down at all. Shoestring fried with white truffle oil, porcini cream, Parmesan reggiano and a side of sundried tomato aioli. The pickle plate was also right up my alley. Pickled, beets, cauliflower, garlic, daikon and shallots. The beets took the cake. Dave's a bit of a connoisseur of the pickled arts so I took his word for it and gave my thanks.     All in all, it was an awesome meal as per usual. Definitely a good place too eat at a slightly above blue collar pricing. In the words on Nike, if someone asks you to go, \"Just Do It.\"     For even better posts, if your interested, give dave a follow on Twitter or Instagram at @davenadkarni",

She was slow and we had to constantly get up to flag her or someone down. Please keep in mind there were only 2-3 other tables and they had their own servers. I can understand when someone is having a bad day but this girl was ridiculous. If you get annoyed when even taking orders then maybe you need to get a new job.",

In addition, their special mayonnaise taste original and fresh.  Tip:   Order your burger well done if you like it medium;  Order it medium is you like it raw;  Order it extra well done if you like it well done.  As long as you know this secret to get your burger cooked the right way you should be good to go!  Like it so people can see this and get their burger cooked properly because this place is very good! Burger is fresh and yummy btw.",

I couldn't keep anything down, even water, for 24 hours, and had to cancel a business trip as a result.    I'm trying to figure out what was it that made me so sick?  The beef, the blue cheese, the spinach.Or did someone not wash their hands?   I will never know but this experience was one of those defining moments. If I ever muster the courage to eat a burger again,  no more medium rare burgers for me,",

Our order: (I will upload a pic too)  -Sangria (just ok...no pieces of fruit in it, none) -Banh mi burger -Miyagi-san wagyu burger (requested carmelized onions to replace the carmelized bacon) -Sweet potato fries (the dipping sauce is heaven, a little dill in there maybe?) -House salad  I literally ate the entire Miyagi burger...the whole thing. The carmelized onions along with the fried onion rings inside the burger was just heaven. Sweet, salty, meaty, my tummy is rumbling just typing about it! What I also really liked was the bun. It wasn't overly thick and bready like other hamburger buns can be. It had good texture and consistency to it.  I'm usually a dessert kind of girl, especially with cheat meals...but I absolutely could not fathom eating dessert after downing the entire burger. All I wanted to do was curl up and take a nap :)  Until next time my sweet Miyagi-san (with carmelized onions instead of carmelized bacon) xo",

What I enjoyed most ironically was their chili cheese fries because it had egg in it. That doesn't sound great, but it really was delicious. I also had their green tea iced tea. It took a while to grow on me, but then I kinda enjoyed the idea of it!   The atmosphere is quiet and the restaurant is clean. It is conveniently located next to the Regal Movie Theatre. Our service was good.  I think the major set-back for me is the cost. The experience was worth the cost, but I am not sure that I would frequent the establishment due to the cost.",

The buns are like clouds and all the sauces and condiments are full of flavor. My favorite thing to get are the pork belly steam buns. They satisfy all the cravings. Sweet, salty, crunchy, porky...they're divine. This time I came and had the bone marrow jelly. This surprised me. It was so well balanced. The little salad that came on the side gave the acidic break needed to counter the rich duck fat butter. The bone marrow isn't just marrow it had some meat in it so the actual bone it sits in is more for presentation. (Gorgeous btw. Not complaining) Overall. Excellent food. The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because of the service. Its always pretty crappy. The servers are kinda rude and they're not really excited about the food. I think I asked for plates 3-4 times before they were brought to us. I got refills on 3/4 filled water before I got plates. Just not the greatest.  I'll keep coming back again and again though. The food is to good not to.",

Very Exotic and fresh, made to order, salt and pepper fries are insane, order one per person, kinda small.  Burgers are NOT small, just right, and so very perfect.   I recommend anything on the menu, I have had a few items and the are amazing.  Matcha Green Tea Banana Shake and all Shakes are off the richter, Myagi-San burger, amazing!  All the burgers are crazy good, pick one you wont go wrong.  Beef is fresh and juicy, fried to perfection.    Its a great burger for $12 with fries, $15 with drink for one, but its the best deal in town.    Bravo!  Try it, you will wont be sorry, if you like BEEF and FLAVOR!    Highly recommended.",

    "text": "I'm a huge fan of Asian cuisine and I love me a good burger as well, so when someone suggested the new Bachi Burger location for dinner a couple of weeks ago, I didn't complain.  We had a party of four and showed up for a later dinner (9:00ish) on a Wednesday night.  The restaurant was quiet but I instantly liked the ambiance and modern feel... The hostesses that greeted us were not the most welcoming, or perhaps they were confused since we asked if we could sit at a table that was vacant but hadn't been cleaned yet instead of sit elsewhere.  Once the seating situation was settled, the staff was friendly-ish, but the service itself was on the (very) slow side.  We were all pretty hungry, so we ordered some apps for the table to start with: Bachi Pickles, Edamame, and Truffle Parm Fries.  The pickled plate isn't ideal for sharing, but the others made  up for it and our party demolished both.  For my entree, I went for the Bachi Fish sandwich and added shishito pepper.  I happen to love shishito pepper, but when I've had it at Asian / International inspired places before, it's cooked. The shishito pepper on my sandwich was not - oh well.  Lesson learned: I like shishito pepper best when it's cooked!  The fish itself was cooked to perfection and of course the fluffy bun it was served on complimented it well.  It was fluffy and sweet.  The others at the table had a Mr Miyagi burger, a Spicy Miso burger, and a Lonely Bird.  Everyone seemed to enjoy their respective orders.  Most of us had iced matcha green tea to drink...  From what I hear, this location is fairly new, so they likely just have to work through some kinks with the service.  I'd definitely be open to returning in the future once that happens.  If you're craving a simple burger, or even something a bit more creative, you can't go wrong with the food at Bachi Burger.",

The exact same goes for this place.  Drove off the strip with the gf and her siblings hoping to have a positive experience.  Another couple entered right before us.  Then,  we were seated shortly after. The 4 of us ordered a total of 3 burgers (fries too but that's besides the point).  It must have take them literally 30 minutes for our orders to come out even after asking our server about  the status.  By this time,  there have already been other customers who have come in after us and left before we even got our food.  Is this acceptable?  Certainly not.  Their excuse was that because we requested one of our burgers to be cooked 'well'  instead of 'medium',  that it would delay it.  Really though,  what's the time frame difference between the two?  I'm no chef but I don't think it's 20 minutes.    Anyway,  we finally got our food and honestly,  it tasted good but because of our long wait,  I feel it's fair to give them a 2 star. We almost walked out due to the long wait time.    Although the server apologized and offered a discount,  it does not make up for the experience we had.  Will not return to this location..",

Here are the other items I tried:  Chili fried chicken - a bit disappointing, as the chicken was a bit soggy and not crispy. Good flavor, though.  Ronin burger - this was the burger I ordered for myself, and I liked it a lot. The smooth and silky caramelized onions was a nice contrast to the bright and crisp cole slaw and miso goma dressing. The runny fried egg just put it over the top.   I personally still prefer the richness and extra \"beefy\" and robust flavor from Miyagi san's Wagyu burger. Plus, I just love those damn onions rings.  Spicy miso burger - overall, great flavors from roasted garlic and the shishito pepper mayo, but the burger was not spicy at all. I say if you're going to put the word \"spicy\" in the burger, at least put some kick into it!   Bachi fish burger - the pan seared alaskan cod was super moist, flaky, and full of flavor. This fish burger is the KING SUMO of all fish burgers, and would crush (literally) all other fish burgers of the world.",

    "text": "I have been suggesting that Bachi Burger open a second location in the SW since my first visit to the original location.  So when I found reviews on the new, and much closer, second location on W. Sahara, I was happy just like a lot of other Yelpers living in the vicinity.  So when fellow foodies suggested we meetup and give this Bachi Burger a try, it was a no brainer for me.  Perhaps in keeping with the theme of being bigger and better, the Summerlin location sports a larger dining room, as well as, a more extensive menu. The menu now spans four pages, instead of the original two sided menu, and looks great in their silver color menu cover.  Milkshakes, sake sangria, fried calamari, and Grilled Loche Duarte Salmon Burger are just some of the new items that are new additions to the Bachi lineup.  The hostess and our waitress were impressively knowledgeable about the menu, and did not hesitate to demonstrate their Jason Bourne-like photographic memory recall talent.  On a side note, how come \"Insert country\" Got Talent never showcase individuals that can recall the value of Pi?  Maybe that was part of the reason she knew who ordered what and checked on our table regularly.  Okay, moving on to the good stuff. This is a burger joint, with a lot of beefy burgers and other alternatives.  I however have always thought that their seafood burger lineup were better than their Angus or Wagyu fusion burgers.  Therefore, I opted to try their Grilled Loch Duarte Salmon burger, which I was told was only available at the Summerlin location.  I was not disappointed with my decision to order this burger. It was made with grilled smoked salmon from Scotland, with crunchy bacon, plus tomato, red onions and arugula to keep it healthy, and lemon herb mayo and ponzu vinaigrette for flavor, moistness (sounds inappropriate) and that \"if it doesn't get all over the place, it doesn't belong in your face\" and ability to moisturize your sticky fingers leaving them smelling like fish for the remainder of your delicious meal.  Sticky and odorous fingers aside, it is highly recommended by yours truly.  My dining companions ordered the Mr. Ho's Burger (comes stock with meaty Chinese Sausages just for the ladies), Spicy Miso Burger (personallyI think it sounds moreinteresting calling it Mi So Spicy! Burger) and the Ronin Burger, and all seem satisfied with their menu selection.  So the consensus is that the food we ordered were yummy.  But I am in the camp that felt for a $10-$20+ burger price tag, you should be able to walk out satisfied, not wonder over to Archi's or Jollibee or drive over to Anime Ramen for dinner part 2.  Just sayin'  Decor/Ambiance:  4/5  Felt more upscale, even without the dim lighting.  Food:  4.5/5  NoM nOm noM Nom!  Service:  4.5/5  Good!  Price/Value:  3/5  Tab could add up fast if you have high metabolism, eat like a growing teenager or on the LV No Buffet List for threatening the profitability of buffets and other AYCE establishments (you know who you are)  Parking:  4/5  Better odds of landing a decent parking space here than hooking up with one of the Anime Ramen girls (already factored in enticing them with Panda Pocky).  4 stars.",

After 25 minutes for them to put sliverware on a table we ordered the \"pickles\" appetiser,  not a good choice. Not sure what is was supposed to be. But it wasn't good.  The friesthat  came out cold  - on both of our orders. And then when my caesars salad came out with chicken - I ordered it with a crab cake - I wanted to rage, but, instead I just asked for them very politely, to make me a new one? Instead of picking the chicken out - She goes, \"Oh, I can take the chicken out.\"  I said NO I have a reaction to chicken. Please make me a new one she said Okay, I will take the chicken out.. I was like, HUh? No please do not do that..... WEll, I inspected the salad when it came back and was hopeful I had a new one. But, half way down the bowl I ate and Uh-oh, what did I see but chicken chunks.... I almost blew chunks rite then and there!! After asking for the Mgr -20 minutes for the manager to come over. 25 more minutes after I told her what happend. I was having a panic attack. My stomach was doing flips. I didn't know how much I ate or what \"juice\" of chicken I had. When I asked for the Manager again - seriously, yes, again... (what was she doing, hiding from me?) she came out with the chef. At this point I was gagging and had to leave. I didn't want to listen to the excuses of why  - - just get me out of here. Oh, yeah, and thanks so much for the phone call to see if I was okay??? You people have no clue how to cook, run an eating establishment or give any and I mean ANY type of service. This fly by night opperation should be shut down. It was awful and not just a fluke how they didn't handle this whole ordeal. WHO PICKS OUT CHICKEN AFTER SOMEONE TELLS YOU THEY HAVE A REACTION TO IT?? ARE YOU JUST OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL ELECTIVE COOKING CLASS 1O1 ? No, I am sure they would've taught you guys to re-make it espcially when I had to ask - And still, you didn't. Clearly, you can't get a salad right. Or fries. So, people beware! They are fakes. Real chefs don't do this. Either do real kitchens. And real wait staff would never take shortcuts like this gambling with peoples health.",

A few minutes later he comes back to get our beverage order- we attempted to order for the kiddo, but he already walked away again... The sodas come and we order a beer and again try to order for the kiddo and same as before- gone within a blink of the eye.... About 7 minutes go by- no beer, no server and a handful of other patrons looking around to see if anyone was coming back to perhaps take a dinner order for anyone. Please keep in mind this is a Wednesday evening around 545 and there were only 6 tables in the place total.

Waited 25 minutes and ready to walk out but they finally seated us. 10 minutes went by before we got to order. A couple who walked in right after we were seated got there meal before us. Crappy customer service. The burgers were o.k. but with this kind of treatment I don't think i'll be back. Customer service is #1.

But the \"Bachi\" in Bachi Burger is just Hibachi abbreviated, because if you've been to Bachi Burger, the Asian gourmet style burgers are the best.  Got there early, enough to beat the crowd, like 5:30pm.  The atmosphere was retro, with a mixed crowd--and I was surprised at an extensive menu to suit everyone, from children to the old--Appetizers galore, and desserts too.  For those meat lovers, Angus beef and Wagyu (similar to that Kobe steak) and the Lonely Bird (turkey chix mix) and fish too.  Love the design of this place.  As it got busy the hostess, was busy running around, should have one stationary, and one seating guests  The change in waiters and waitresses kept us busy wondering who was actually waiting on us.  But overall, it was a good experience and the burgers, were the best.  Looking forward to returning.",

Alexis--the server told me after I told her that I didn't want the Iced Matcha Green Tea, that the item would not be removed from my bill. I told her the drink tasted horrible like matcha mix and tap water and I did not want to drink it, because it did not taste good. She was extremely rude and I asked to talk to a manager. As a former food server, I know that removing an item from the bill is no biggie. I saw the manager coming over to our table and  I thought the problem would be rectified. The manager was rude and confrontational, instead of fixing the problem he actually made things worse; but eventually decided to take the $4.00 item off of our bill. The excitement my husband, son and I initially felt walking into the place subsided after all of this hoopla over a drink. We felt unwanted, negative vibes the entire time we were there. Despite all of this we decided to stay, like dummies and try the food. While we were eating, Alexis threw the check on the table. She did not bother to ask us what we thought about the food or whether or not we wanted refills on drinks, or dessert. I know as a server you never bring the bill over until you see that your patrons are done eating. She obviously did not get this memo. I seriously would not recommend this establishment and not because the food isn't good. A place of business should treat anyone who walks through the doors like family. The service provided by the server Alexis and the douche manager was absolutely horrendous. I will not be returning and I will tell everyone I know not to go also. SERVICE SUCKS!!!",

We arrived and had to wait about 5-10mins, which was no big deal since there were a few people in front of us and the restaurant looked busy.  When it was our turn to be seated we went around the partition and half the tables were empty, so I'm not sure what the wait was for. Our waiter was prompt and our drink/food order taken in no time.  ( Quick Side note: We were seated toward the back and across from us a table filled with folded dish towels and aprons were sitting out...not sure why it was on a table for customers to see.  I will give them credit and the items were moved half way through our meal.) The food however took a while to come out.  I know this isn't a fast-food place but it took about 25-30 mins  for our 2 burgers and fries to hit the table. (No we didn't do appetizers).  The food was good, but I don't really see what the hype is all about.  Will we eat here again? Maybe, but this won't be on my top 5.",

    "text": "I wish I would have been feeling better than I was; even given my state of ick, I found Bachi Burger to be quite tasty. We got there around 4:30 on a Saturday evening & there were only a few other tables occupied (by the time we were leaving the movie theater at 7:30, it looked like there were people waiting outside). We were immediately given waters yet never asked if we wanted anything else to drink. We could've asked on our own but the water seemed sufficient. The menu is fairly concentrated but the selection is not lacking. Our waiter was the perfect level of attentive, smiled alot & handled my inquiries (i.e. neurosis) like a champ. The menu clearly states \"no substitutions\" (i.e. don't start changing $#!% or it'll take away the integrity of the dish) so I wanted to be respectful of that. We ordered the chili fried chicken (appetizer), truffle parmesan fries w/sundried tomato aioli &, while we could have just split a Kiki burger, at this point, we wanted them cooked differently. I would go back for the chili fried chicken alone. For an appetizer, there's a generous serving. Quality meat cooked perfectly (very filling!). Somehow, I've never had truffle anything so the fries were a treat. I'm not a meat person- I eat meat but I don't want it to taste like meat- so I order everything \"not quite a hockey puck but well done\". What Bachi managed to do is cook it just to the point of thorough where it was still pillow soft inside. There was an intense char on the outside that was deliciously crispy (not hocky puck'y). Since I didn't have much of an appetite & since the chicken & fries filled me up, I didn't eat much of my burger. But what I did eat left the impression of being unique & worth going back for. I'll admit, I was a bit nervous to try Bachi, after reading reviews of both locations & questioning their customer service. Due to the concentrated menu, there's an opportunity to obtain alot of regulars who go back for the same, special item(s) that can't be found elsewhere. But if they can't get the customer service issues under control, something with amazing, long-term potential could be tarnished over something so easy to fix. I just hope my positive experience wasn't luck & that it'll be equally pleasant the next time I go.",

    "text": "'Discovered' this place via watching \"Diners, Drive-ins & Dives\" on the food network.  Decided to give it a try and glad we did.    Short version: if you like hamburgers, you must try this place.  Long version: LOT of flavors happening in this food.  The fries are excellent in their own right, and topping them with oxtail chili, cheese and jalapenos turns a side item into an appetizer (or a meal).  The bahn-mi burger was both delicate and hearty, with perfect layers of sweet, savory, spicy and sharp notes in each bite.  My wife had the miagi burger and I got a bite of it, but it was much more subtly delicious and did not stand up to the flavor-forward burger I was already consuming.  She loved it, and the onion rings in her burger were extremely good.  The place is nice with a modern feel, clean and well-ordered.  We experienced no problems with service, our server was spot-on before and during the meal, though after finishing we waited a little longer than we wanted receiving the check.  We will definitely return and bring friends to try it, and I look forward to tasting some of the other really-interesting-looking stuff on the menu.  P.S. You can get a 'regular' burger and fries if you're not adventurous; I will one day because the quality of ingredients and skill of prep promise to make it one of the best burgers in Vegas.",

The service was pretty good when I had gone. I went with a group 10+. Waitress was friendly and was usually there when needed. Also when the check came we asked her to split certain things on certain checks and she had no problem with it.   Good service and good food. The only thing is that its a litte pricy for a burger drink and fries.",

    "text": "I had the good fortune of having a friend living in Henderson bring me to this place when I visited Vegas this past weekend. I would never have known about Bachi Burger otherwise because this place isn't on the strip or anything, but it's still wildly popular. We waited an hour to get seats, but that might have just been a particularly busy day, still it was worth the wait.   I highly recommend the Oxtail chili cheese fries. It's the best chili cheese fries I tried to date, albeit their take on it is a little different from the traditional (less cheese and beans) but that's what makes it so great.   Next, I got the Ronin burger ordered to medium well and oh man.... I always considered myself a fan of good burgers and after trying this, I'm going to have to place them in my top 5 list.   My friend tried the Spicy Miso burger. After swapping samples we both agreed the Ronin was better. I'm definitely looking forward to trying some of the others on the menu when i come back to Vegas next time or when they open in LA.   Definitely recommend people come out to try this place if you have the time to travel a bit off the strip.",

    "text": "So time finally came when was in the area and me and the fiance were hungry. We sat there for awhile to de ide where to go...Mac house, kona grill, CPK, then it hit me! Its time to give bachi burger a try! We get there around 10pm and Its. Wasn't that busy being they close at 11pm. We were seated immediately and the hostess and servers were great! Very friendly and knowledgeable. The restaurant was clean and I liked the decor, pretty cool spot to hit up if you want a burger! So we ordered, we started with the butter truffle edamame and while it was good, it was oily and had lots of butter taste which was a nice change from the usual steamed veriety, but it didn't really have any truffle flavor. While we still enjoyed it, it would have made it a hit to have a stronger truffle flavor present. I orderedsalt and opera garlic fries with a side of pineapple ketchup (side of pineapple ketchup is $.50 extra) the fried were cooked well and were not greasy, the fresh jalapenos were a nice touch and added some kick, both the aioli and ketchup were perfect and the balance of those two being spicy and savory to sweet and salt was awesome and I will def get that combo of chili garlic aioli and pineapple ketchup again. I looked over the menu and while the burger to get with what I've gathered is the miyagi san, the ronin really appealed to me. So for this time I got the ronin. We didn't get the wagyu patties and stuck with the Angus and it was cooked to perfection! Med cooked with pink center was done to my liking! The flavors that stood out to me on this burger was the caramelized onions, Katsu sauce, and the miso gonna dressing. The bun was soft, chewy, and just a perfect way to round out this burger. The fried egg was a nice tough and everything worked in harmony. Nothing to over powering or lacking, the burger itself was seasoned well, juicy, and a very easy eating burger.  My overall first impression got better and better as I continued to eat the burger, the best burger in Vegas?? I don't know yet. I will have to try the miyagi San next time around but from what I've had this time, it is very close. I don't mind spending some decent money on a good burger and this was no expection. We will be back as the flavors of our first visit was the hook!",

I felt like I'd gained 30 pounds and blocked a few arteries after my meal, but... it's a burger joint.. I love the grass-fed option. I won't give it 5 stars, because it was a bit greasy for my liking, but nothing near 5 Guys' status. It was $39 for 2 meals. Pricey but nothing insane. Great option to have in Vegas!",

I had the salmon burger, he had the cod burger and both were fantastic.  THIS is how any fish sandwich should taste, PERIOD!  Fresh flavors and seafood with sauce that doesn't over power the flavors.    We like Bachi Burger so much we went back again today, I had the crab cake burger, he had a house burger.  The crab cake was light and fluffy, with nice lumps of crab, the chutney it is served with compliments the crab perfectly and leaves a spicy/sweet taste in its wake.  Mmmmm!  The burger he ordered was perfect, I have never had a better burger, REALLY, never.  Bachi Burger is doing it right, you will pay for the quality and fresh flavors but it is sooooo worth it.  ENJOY, I will be back next week!",

This time it was still fairly good, I guess this branch just opened up, so it's very new and clean.   I usually get the Kalbi Burger, although for some reason, this one didn't taste as great as the one I had in the south. I had a bite of my mom's Black and Green Burger, which is her favorite, and it also tasted good. I like their variety of fries. So far I've only tasted their Sweet Potato Fries and Salt and Pepper Fries; both very delicious, especially the dipping sauce that comes with.  My only complaint is that this branch was freezing when me and my mom went in. We kept debating whether or not we should just take the food to go, since it was almost unbearable waiting for our food to come out. It was a windy day, so I wasn't expecting the AC to be on that high.   Anyways, service was great. We had two servers; both were very friendly.   My only other advice is come here on an empty stomach, because I had eaten a little while before coming in, so I got full pretty fast.   I definitely plan to come here again. It's much better than driving all the way to the south for Bachi Burger, especially if you're from North LV, like myself. Just bring a light coat, perhaps? ;)",

    "text": "This review is about the service & not the food... Had dinner with my two friends & my 10 month old daughter last night. We were seated promptly & waters were given right away. I thought \"how nice, they brought my daughter a plastic cup with straw for water!\".  My third friend came a few minutes later. I didn't notice until our server mentioned it, but there were only 2 menus. I had told her there were 3 adults & the baby. Ok, no biggie. My guy friend had never been there before. He asked our server what kind of cheese is gruyere? She states \"white cheese\". Awkward silence. I explained to him it's more of a pungent cheese with a sharp flavor. So, the fries came out before the burgers which was great because we were starving. The burgers came out quickly as well. The food is usually really yummy & it was last night too! So, the aforementioned plastic cup for my daughter was a big hit with her. All she wanted to do was drink from this cup. Well, my daughter dropped the cup and water went everywhere on the floor. Thankfully, there wasn't anyone next to us on either side. The server came by to check on us & I asked her if she had any rags for me to clean up the water. She came by with a few napkins & then saw the mess. She tried to to sop the water up with the few napkins, then realized a mop would be better. Well the mop never came. Mind you when the water dropped, another server was walking by & saw the whole thing. He ignored us. Our server came by twice to tell us \"we will clean when you leave, you probably don't wanna exit over here since it's wet\". Ok thanks for pointing that out. So, the plates were not even cleared for dinner when out came our check. I gotta tell you, my last review I raved about the dessert I had! I may have even dreamed about it for a week! I wasn't planning on having any last night but to not even be asked was a major insult. Sorry, my daughter spilled the water. Sh*t happens. My friend asked while we were leaving, \"how come our server asked that other table if they wanted dessert?\". That was the last blow. I ended up tipping 22% since we had the water mess. I should have written a note \"if it wasn't for my daughter spilling the water, you wouldn't even have received 15%.\" Looking back, I shouldn't have left the 22%. Will I be back? Probably. But not for a while. The food is good but when you receive bad service, the food can't always save it.",

    "text": "Came tonight for a late lunch/early dinner around 4:00. We were seated right away and our server was attentive.  Boyfriend ordered the $12 calamari appetizer which was all fresh and tossed in red peppers, mint and tomatoes. You get the rings and full tentacles. Served with a side of green oil which we couldn't figure out the taste. He loved it but me I cant stand seafood lol so of course when I took a bite to try I was sick the rest of my meal.  Everything is served a la carte so we ordered Parmesan truffle fries for $4. Boyfriend ordered the Mr. Miyagi burger cooked medium. Presentation was cool but the amount of onion rings was a bit much. He really enjoyed it otherwise.  Honestly wasn't that impressed with my own burger. I ordered the Standard Bachi burger this only comes with lettuce, tomato, onion and a subtle BBQ drenched meat patty. All other toppings including cheese are an additional $1.50 each. I added cheddar cheese and applewood smoked bacon. Bacon portion was a little chinsy 1.5 pieces, really?? Why not give the full 2 pieces? Ok so I ordered medium well and it was pink/almost red all the way through. I didn't want to send it back but it definitely was not what I like. The sauce that covers the patty was such a subtle taste but was pretty good.   The buns are amazing, some sort of Asian sweet roll that is baked daily and delivered fresh daily.   Really wasn't happy with the soda choices, first off Pepsi eew. But to make things worse they only have Pepsi, diet Pepsi, Sierra mist and root beer.   Total bill came to about $50 and we just weren't that satisfied for the price. Cool concept and I'm sure we will be back because the variety of items they offer. Definitely want to try the pork belly sliders !",

Only differences I noticed were that this location has much more space and was less crowded when I showed up.  Service was quick, food was cooked perfectly, and everything was great!  Banh-Mi Burger ($9.50): Angus Beef, Pork, Shrimp, Lemongrass, Pork Pate, Fresh Herbs, Curry Aioli, Pickled Vegetables and Nuoc Mam Sauce. This was a great burger! Lots of diversity, consistency, and taste...each bite was perfect.  Highly recommended :)  Truffle Parmesan Fries ($4.50): Parmesan Reggiano, Black Truffle Porcini Cream and Sun Dried Tomato Aioli. I've had these a long time ago and wasn't too impressed...gave them another go, and felt the same way. Not too much truffle taste here! Go with the Oxtail fries or the Salt & Pepper Garlic fries if you are solo!  I've tried quite a few of the other burgers here as well...Shogun was pretty good!  I thought the unagi/eel was a little distracting from the foie gras, but overall a good value and yummy burger at around $25.  Come check it out if you haven't already!

    "text": "I've been to Bachi Burger three times now, and I absolutely LOVE it here! I brought my man here (he's from Utah) and he's definitely in love with this place more than I am. They serve gourmet burgers here and yes, they're on the pricey side BUT it's worth it because of the quality of the foodies that they serve here.   Quality of food: DELICIOUS! I usually get the Kiki Burger (I haven't tried any others), and it never disappoints. There's loads of flavor and the meat is just so tender and juicy! I almost always pair it up with the Parmesan Truffle Fries. BOMB DOT COM EXPLOSION IN YO' MOUTH! I actually tried the Salt & Pepper Garlic Fries today & it's still pretty delicious! I still prefer the Truffle Fries over it. My man and our daughter get the sweet potato fries - And they love it! I've tried it and I actually really like it as well.   Service: Variable, and this is the reason why I docked a star from them. Because the food is made to order, it takes awhile. But HEY! Not complaining because when you taste that burger.. Oh goodness, you'll be in Heaven! Servers are actually really friendly here, and they're accommodating. They check up on you every so often.  Other than their variable service, what's there NOT to like about this place? Great ambiance plus great food is definitely what'll keep me coming back.",

Give me a good In-N-Out instead.  Bachi finally met the challenge of a worthy gourmet burger.  I had grave doubts as I shoved the enormous burger into my mouth, but the burger won me over.  We indulged, ordering three different types of fries (the pineapple ketchup the nicest surprise).  We got milk shakes (excellent).  Edamame were wonderful -- both flavors, though a bit oily.  The burgers excellent.  Good service.  Nice interior.  A nice happy hour.  We'll be back.  There's a reason why this is rated as the best burger in Vegas.",

We celebrate birthdays, special occasions, promotions, all kinds of things at Bachi Burger in my family. Okay, we might actually look for reasons to go to Bachi Burger.   The Asian style burgers have a lot of flavor, plus there's a great bun-to-everything-else ratio, and our favorites are the Ronin Burger (onion strings, fried egg, generally awesome), the Kiki burger (mushrooms, bacon sweet onion marmalade), and those chili oxtail fries which are heaven in a bowl.   Perfect for a family outing and arguably one of the best burgers in Las Vegas, this place is home.",

    "text": "So we finally tried Bachi Burger!  Another bookmark to check off of my list!  Bachi Burger has been on my radar since I saw it DDD on the Food Network.  We were finally in the neighborhood and hungry at the same time, so we popped in for lunch.  When we walked in, the place was almost empty, but the hostess (who thought very highly of herself, if I do say so) said we needed to wait to be seated for a while.  We weren't in a hurry, so we waited, but thought it was weird.  We were finally seated 5 minutes later at a table that had been empty and clean the entire time.  We then waited at least 5 minutes for our server to come by to get our drink order.  When she came back with our drinks we were ready to order since we had been there quite some time by this point.    We ordered the Mr. Ho's burger and the Miyagi-san burger with the sea salt and pepper garlic fries.  The burgers were quite yummy and we liked the different flavors going on, but they weren't extremely special.  We did really like them though.  The fries were good as well, but not anything spectacular.   I didn't taste any garlic, onion sea salt, or really anything exciting.  They tasted like fries from a regular fast food joint, not gourmet fancy fries.   The prices seem to be really high here as well.  I get that they are uber-modern, doing the hip fusion menu thing, and you have been on the Food Network, but I expected a little more umph for the price.  Our burgers were $10 and $13.5 dollars and we had to pay another $4 for fries.  The burgers were delish and probably worth the price, but I think the mediocre fries could have been thrown in, instead of a side item to add on.   As for our service, all I can say is ugh!  I don't know what it is with my hubby and I, but we always seem to get the worst server in the place for our server.   We are so super easy and never high maintenance, especially since I used to work in the restaurant industry for years. Our server just seemed overwhelmed, even though I only saw her waiting on our table and 1 other.  She rarely checked on us.  I think we saw her 3 times the whole meal.  We got better service from surrounding servers, bussers, and the food runners.  So the food warrants a return visit because we did enjoy it.  I just hope we get a better server and tastier fancy fries.",

I don't think there is any doubt that this is hands down one of the best burgers I've ever had.   I'm definitely going to go back next time I'm in town.  Prices were very reasonable at about $10-15.

The unfortunate part is I've been looking forward to trying the burgers, but I had one somewhere else for lunch so I wasn't in the mood for another.  No worries though, Bachi Burger has a full menu with quite a few options besides their extensive selection of unique, gourmet burgers. I'm actually kind of grateful I didn't want a burger this time, because I ordered the Bachi Fish sandwich, which I probably never would have ordered from a burger place. It was awesome! Wonderfully soft bun, perfectly seasoned, seared cod, veggies, tarter sauce.   My wife did get a burger so I was able to try a bite of hers and it was not disappointing at all. The beef here is high quality and well prepared. I'll definitely be coming back to have one of the burgers.  The salt and pepper garlic fries were incredible. Served with chili aoli, topped with sliced jalapenos and diced green onions.  Some of the best fries I've had in awhile.  This place would be near perfect if it had a better draft beer selection. They only had Sapporo on tap. There is a pretty nice selection of bottled beers but they're terribly overpriced for a bottle. Unfortunately I went without a brew during my visit.  Overall I'm digging this place..",

The place is nice and clean and had a bunch of TV's playing the local sports teams. The service was pretty good and the food quality was definitely top notch!   We ordered chili cheese fries but it came with a sunny side up egg on top of it. Anything with a sunny side up egg is instantly that much better, this definitely helped! I don't remember which burger I ordered but I had it medium rare and it came out pretty near perfect.   Overall the quality was great and the service was tremendous. Really have no complaints about this place. The price was more than reasonable.   I would say the only bad thing about this place is the distance from the strip. You really have to go out of your way to get to this place and it's definitely not a short drive.   Tips:  1) Try the fries 2) Happy hour milkshakes 3) Enjoy",

    "text": "Let me preface this by saying I normally don't give bad reviews, but the experience we had at Bachi Burger is worth mentioning both for the diner's benefit and the restaurant's.  We were off to a bad start when we waited to be seated (the restaurant was almost empty) longer than we should have. Someone finally noticed us and started seating us: \"this way please, er nope, sit here, ah no, I mean there, nope nope, there sit there\"--please make up your mind and stop giving us a grand tour of the floor--we can do that after lunch. Finally, after all the confusion, the guy settled on a location and sat us down. A few more minutes of wait and our server showed up and took our order. We really didn't mind the waiting at this point so we just waited like normal people do.  After our orders came in, we noticed there weren't any napkins or utensils--basically our table was bereft of a proper table setup. Yes we know you eat burgers with your hands but we wanted to cut ours in half to cross-share, plus it's messy, plus other self-respecting restaurants do this. So we then asked a passing server/busboy if we could please get some napkins (while wiping the food off our face and hands with our hands) and at the very least a knife, he said \"surething\" and never came back. WTF. Our IDGAF server finally checks on us and we re-requested for the same napkins and knife we asked for earlier (she was appalled that we needed napkins and utensils, by the way).  So, let's get to the food review bit: the burgers are great, I forgot what we had at this point due to the irritations, but I remember it was Angus, medium well, and very juicy. Mine had the taro bun and both were suggested initially by our server which was a good thing. We also had the onion rings, which I must say is how onion rings should be done. The breading is thin and doesn't slide off when you bite into it, the flavor is savory and it's very light and crispy. The food was good enough that I almost forgot how irritated I was becoming until we had to wait again for our bill.  After our check finally came, there was another long wait for it to come back for us to sign off--our server did give us lip service that something was wrong with their system. Mmmkay. Then my wife noticed our bill was off by $6+ so she had to walk to the counter and ask our server why the price discrepancy from the check to what was charged. The bill was rectified but instead of refunding us the amount, the server says they have to charge us again and wait 48-hours for the other charge to be refunded to our bank.  At this point my wife just wanted to GTFO and leave. Yes we left gratuity because we're civil and nice people despite being treated wrongly. Will we ever come back here? Never. Will we recommend this to any of our friends or visiting relatives? Never. For a restaurant that offers premium burgers at premium prices ($12+ burgers  with no fries or drinks ain't cheap), their service sure isn't up to par. End rant, and back to Islands Hamburgers or In N Out.",

It also was pretty dead .... at 8pm on a Friday night. So we kinda wondered if it was gong to be as good as all the reviews claimed.  I'm so glad that we didn't let any of that stop us from dining here!  First .... food taste/quality:  No complaints here 10/10! They don't have a gluten free burger bun. So I just had the meat and toppings. But that is fine ... room for more fries!! And we tried 3 of the fries, ha. The burger was cooked perfect and very yummy  (I had kiki but subbed waygu. that sweet onion sauce on it is SO good) and all the fries were PERFECT (we had the regular ones that have jaleps, the sweet potato fries and also the oxtail chili cheese fries as an appetizer.) You must get the oxtail fries. So different and so good. Also the sweet potato were MUCH better than the others (that had jaleps) but they were good too! Perfectly crispy!   Gluten Free Options/Knowledge: They have to make your burger without some sort of sauce they normally put on all the burgers. But with so many toppings (and all the other sauces being GF) ... I certainly don't think I missed out on anything! They also let me know that they DO NOT have a dedicated fryer for the fries. They are cooked in same oil as onion rings. I decided to take the risk since I usually don't get sick from that. I may kick myself tomorrow .. but the fries were WORTH IT, ha.   If I do end up getting sick ... I will have no way of knowing if the meal itself indeed had gluten or if it's from cross contamination. So that is why I chose to write my review now instead of later. If I get sick it will likely be my own fault for taking the risk with cross contamination! They did seem knowledgable ....so while it seems odd that some things are GF (all condiments, the chili on the oxtail fries, etc) .. because they did seem to know about gluten .. I trusted them!  I can see why this place has been voted one of the best burgers in Vegas. Burger was great .. but it was the fries that made the meal!",

    "text": "Largely regarded as one of the best places in the city for burgers- the reputation is justified! I'd rather spend $12-15 on a burger here than on the Strip- quality of beef and other ingredients is comparable (that is, top-notch) and combinations are fabulous.  KIKI'S BURGER: Angus Beef, Sauteed Shiitake, Enoki & Eryngii Mushrooms, Caramelized Bacon, Sweet Onion Marmalade, Gruyere Cheese, Garlic Chili Aioli. Duh-licious. BF took one bite and said it's the best burger he's ever had. It will blow your mushroom-loving mind.  MIYAGI-SAN'S GRASS-FED WAGYU BURGER: Chili Mayo, Fried Egg, Furikake, Caramelized Bacon, Crispy Onion Rings. An Asian take on a breakfast burger, the chili mayo kicks it up to awesome. Add more if you dare.  Service is stellar, call in your order for pick up- they require a card to place the order but you can use any form of payment when you get in to pick up.",

    "text": "After hearing my girlfriend rave about this place for months, we finally got a chance to dine in and I got to see what the hype was about.   My review is mostly about the service. These guys were on top of it. We had came in just before the dinner rush so not want too busy. Our server was very curious and not overbearing. They were quick to bring out food and refill my drink leaving me with an amazing dining experience.   Now personally I felt the food wasn't anything I haven't tried before. We started with the truffle fries. The serving portions were a bit smaller than I expected but they were still good. Personally I wasn't a huge fan of the tomato aioli they used, but that's just me being picky. My girlfriend got the Ronin Burger and I ordered the bahn mi burger. The timing burger was good and the Japanese coleslaw on top was a nice touch, but like I said before nothing I haven't had backhome in the Bay Area. Now I'm a huge fan of banh mis and I felt like this burger would be \"the one\" for me. Unfortunately it felt a bit flat in that regard. While it was delicious it felt as if it were lacking something (that something TBD).   I would still be more than happy to come back as there was a lot more than burgers on the menu.",

    "text": "So, this is Bachi Burger's newer location and one of the first things I like about it is the elbow room.  It seems a lot spacious and less crammed versus the original location plus there's options of things I could do before or after going here. There's bars, a theater, and restaurants just walking distance. Yea and it's located next to the movie theater.  The must have are the Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries. It's not amazing but just something they are known for, just get and get it out of your system. It's a pile of your usual French fries, kind of wished they were thicker maybe use tater tots or steak fries, topped with a oxtail chili cheese mixture, cilantro, jalapeno, and a fried egg. Order it with your burger and divide it among a group of friends.  I almost alway get the same burger, the Spicy Miso Burger. Don't let the name fool you it isn't even spicy. It's an angus beef patty with shishito pepper, swiss cheese, onion, mayo, lettuce, some sauces, and a fried egg in a bun. Not bad, tasty but the only way I'm satisfied with it is adding lots of sriracha or other other hot sauces on it.  I like what they're doing with their menu, creative and would impress many. The service here has almost always been good except when you want to divide checks, I think the max was up to 4 split checks no matter how large the party but they'll let you charge as many cards if you want on one check so it usually works out.",

    "text": "Where do I even start! If you have a chance to get off the strip, this place is amaze-balls! I dont think there's anything on the menu that I didn't like AND theres a No meat burger for all you vegetarians out there!  I came here with the family and a game plan. We ordered a total of 8 burgers and split 6 among 5 people (the \"No Meat Here.. was for the vegetarian and we got 2 spicy miso). BEST IDEA ever, since we rarely come to vegas and wanted to try a little of everything. Everything we got medium except the wagyu - medium rare. Here are my rankings from best to good because let's face it, all the burgers were delicious.   *Shogun Burger - Wagyu Beef & Unagi, Pan Seared Foie Gras, Poached Asian Pear, Miso Butter, Yamamomo Peach.  The is probably the most expensive burger on the menu but so worth it. Slightly sweet from the pear and peach but savory with the melt in your mouth Wagyu beef. AND unagi (eel)!!! they do not skimp!  *The \"Banh-Mi\" Burger - Angus Beef, Pork, Shrimp, Lemongrass, Pork Pate, Fresh Herbs, Curry Aioli, Pickled Vegetables, Nuoc Mam Sauce.  Who needs Lee Sandwiches when you got this burger. Absolutely perfect! You don't even need the pickled veggies on the side because it's perfectly balanced without it.  *Spicy Miso Burger - Angus Beef, Onions, Shishito Pepper, Mayo, Lettuce, Roasted Garlic, Swiss Cheese, Fried Egg, Apple Vinaigrette. Perfectly fried egg! When you cut into it, the yolk just oozes. Not spicy like Sriracha  spicy but as in a little kick for your taste buds.   *Mr. Hos Burger - Angus Beef, Pork, Garlic, Ginger, Sauteed Mushrooms, Lup Cheong Sausage, Mizuna Lettuce, Taro Bun.  That Taro Bun though! So good i'd buy the bun if they sold it separately. Flavors are light, sweet and salty and savory.  *Miyagi-sans Grass-Fed Wagyu Burger, Chili Mayo, Fried Egg, Furikake, Caramelized Bacon, Crispy Onion Rings. Onions Rings on a Burger?! I'm sold!   *Kalbi Burger - Angus Beef, Kalbi Marinade, Green Onions, House Made Kim Chee, Ko Chu Jang Mayo.  You definitely need to eat this with the picked cucumbers on the side. This burger was light in flavor so it relied heavily on the kim chee and pickled veggies to give you that punch.",

Oxtail chili fries, pork belly buns, duck buns, sweet potato fries, salt & pepper garlic fries, and all the burgers are great.  Good selection of craft beers and my kids love their milk shakes.    So why only 1 star??  Management (or ownership) here is terrible.    There is never a host at the front, so you have to wait for one of the servers to free up some time to seat you.    They don't have bussers, so usually we bus our own tables by putting our empties on an empty table next to us.    They don't have an expeditor in front of the kitchen, so sometimes your appetizer will come after your entree.    The servers are very nice.  They try hard.  They work hard.    Finally today after several mishaps, I asked our server why the quality of service is so poor.    He explained that the owners expect the servers to seat customers, bus their own tables, make milkshakes, etc.  I assume it is the reason the restaurant was 1/2 empty during 7pm dinner on a Friday evening.  Oh yea... and then we ordered two burgers to go.  Each cost $15.   They wrapped it in paper and but them in a bag.  lol.  Not a box.  Not a container.   They put it in paper like fast food drive thru.",

Not too many people during the nighttime.   Service: 3 - Our server was funny and really kind, but they were too slow with everything after we were done eating, such as the check and getting boxes. Took way too much time than it should have!!   Food: 3 - Some tips!   (1) If you're not getting a grass-fed burger, you really should. You can taste the difference, and to me, the regular is just...yuck! I realized I should have payed $16 for the grass-fed beef.  (2) The fries are good, and the quickest thing on the menu! I suggest the truffle fries and the regular fries with the pineapple ketchup..I'm gonna start doing that to my ketchup whenever I have fries at home!  (3) My burger favorite is Miyagi san's Grass-Fed Wagyu burger. One word: Delish.   In all, I suggest the other location of Bachi Burger for a more pleasant experience, but if all you want is Miyagi and fries--this location isn't half bad!!",

It has hard chairs and is very cafeteria-style. It's also usually loud and cold feeling.  My service there was awful last time I was in, and when I have been in I often wait for service and am not checked up on. The servers are friendly, they just aren't attentive, which makes it hard to enjoy a meal if it is cold by the time you get your sauce or your side.  The burgers are great though!",

Our server this time was really patient as we had a bigger group. This time I got to try the oxtail chili fries, which was a really good combo of spices and beef. The Banh mi burger reminded me of the sandwich was was perfect replica of flavors. This is a must try with lup chueng sausage!   The pork belly steam buns are always the best appetizer, I highly recommend this. The hoisin sauce , am the egg and pork belly all flow together right .",

The servers are super friendly and talkative.  We were seated immediately as there weren't that many people there on a Wednesday night.  I ordered the coconut taro milk tea $4, and my friend had one of their IPAs on tap.  The coconut taro milk tea wasn't very good, it wasn't creamy or taro tasting at all, I think I will just stick to their burgers from now on.   We ordered the oxtail chili cheese fries $11.5 to start, this dish was huge!! They gave a massive amount of fries, chili, and cheese.  I think this dish could easily have been split between 6 people instead of 3.  I ordered the Miyagi burger medium rare.  The burgers took about 15 min to come out, which was totally fine because the burgers here are always cooked perfectly!!   My burger was delicious, the perfect combination of savory and sweet ( not too sweet mind you), the beef was soo juicy, and the bun was soft and fluffy.  Sadly I couldn't finish my burger because it was just too big.  I have had 3 -4 burgers here and have never been disappointed.  Next time I will probably try their fish or their \"no meat here burger\"!!",

    "text": "Bachi!  After a long morning of sight-seeing and driving, we decided to stop for a late lunch before continuing on to nearby Red Rock Canyon.  I had Bachi Burger bookmarked for a visit on my recent trip, but decided to visit this location on a whim after we realized (thanks to the trusty Yelp app) that it was midway to our destination.  ALOHA:  Ever since Bachi Burger was featured on DDD on the Food Network with Guy Fieri, and discovering its owners/chef are originally from the 50th state, I was beyond ecstatic to finally have a chance to eat here.  LOCATION/AMBIANCE:  Ample parking available as its located in a shopping center/strip mall.  The restaurant is spacious and inviting with plentiful seating.  MEAT:  The melding of Asian flavors and ingredients is paramount as diners peruse the menu.  Asian fare combined with traditional American burger toppings are fused to create an outstanding burger.  *Kalbi Burger:  I love Korean food.  I really like kim chee.  And so, having house made kim chee as a component of this burger sold me immediately.  Other ingredients included kalbi marinade, green onions, and ko chu jang mayo.  I can't begin to describe just how much I enjoyed this burger.  It was perfectly cooked and the toppings fresh.  Easily one of the best burgers I've had.  *Shogun Burger:  My dining companion's choice.  Wagyu beef and unagi combined with pan seared foie gras , poached Asian pear, miso butter, and Yamamoto peach.  I can't speak for my friend's fondness for his choice, except to say that he ate nearly everything on his plate.   We shared with the regular fries and onion rings as sides.  As lover of french fries, I of course loved the fries.  I also liked the batter of the onion rings, as it wasn't coated too heavily and therefore you could actually taste the onion as opposed to just a mouthful of hollow batter.  Both were excellent choices.  SERVICE:  Exceptionally good.  The restaurant wasn't crowded when we arrived and we were seated immediately.  The server was a friendly young man who gave us ample time to look over the menu.  He answered the few questions we had about the menu, took our orders, and returned with soda and waters shortly after.  He checked on us periodically throughout themeal and readily provided soda and water refills.  Good service overall.  BOTTOM LINE:  Phenomenal burgers.  Good service.  I'll be back hopefully on a future trip.",

The kids burger came with fries and a milkshake. The burger was huge! My daughter could only eat half. I tasted my hubby's salad. He liked it but I thought it had too much dressing/cheese.

They were good. The texture of the oxtail was like pulled pork. It wasn't the best chili I've ever had, but it was tasty. It overpowered the flavor of the oxtail, but was still good. There are some jalapenos jn there and a fried egg on top. French fries are skinny fries, and during happy hour fries are $5 off.  I also ordered the Miyagi-San wagyu burger which was $15 and includes the wagyu patty. It comes stacked pretty high at first because of the onion crisps which are really good. There is caramelized bacon which is good, along with chili mayo. The bun is also really good, it's soft, but not chewy. Overall the burger went together really well, the only regret was having it made medium. The server suggested it, but I think the flavor of this meat would have been much better if I had ordered it medium rare.  I also ordered dessert to go, the salted caramel shake with toasted marshmallows on top. I'm normally just a chocolate lover, but this shake was great.",

However, I did see that they had some veggies on their on line menu that sounded really good, so I was pretty excited. It was pretty empty on a Tuesday night around 8pm.   Our server was a little dry, but he was on point with filling drinks and patient with my complicated order. I ordered the meatless burger, no bun, bed of lettuce and no sauces (Made vegan). My boyfriend and two friends ordered their burgers and the oxtail fries. I opted for edamame (it was so good). The food came out pretty promptly and with no problems (I didn't have to send one thing back)! They loved the oxtail fries and their burgers! I really enjoyed my food as well. I would totally recommend my burger to any and all of my meat eating friends... The texture wasn't meaty (being vegan, I hate anything that mimics meat), but it was definitely a versatile dish that anyone could of enjoyed!   Oh and they carry my favorite red zin! Seven deadly sins and at a fair price per glass considering it's price everywhere else. Our friends enjoyed the beer menu as well. We will all definitely be returning!",

Our party tried the wagyu, angus, and veggie burger patties accompanied with various condiments. We also tried the sweet potato fries.   I thought the wagyu was exceptional Anne the angus very good. The veggie was just ok but then again I'm not usually a fan of veggie patties. The fries were crispy and exceptional.  They had a solid beer menu as well.   I would come back to Bachi as the menu is very extensive and will cost you under $20 for a quality higher end burger. Hopefully they have everything we want in stock next time.",

    "text": "This review is for: January 1, 2017. I haven't visited this location in almost two years, however after this experience I fell in love with it all over again. I walked in around 5pm and after we were seated it seemed as if the parties after us were getting bigger and bigger. I'm impressed with how fast paced the workers were that night.   Ordered the highly recommended KiKi's Burger (Angus Beef, Sauteed Shiitake, Enoki Mushrooms, Caramelized Bacon, Gruyere Cheese, Sweet Onion Marmalade and Garlic Chili Aioli) with a side of Just Fries. I was not disappointed in the quality of food at all. Everything was delicious.   I read through other reviews of this location before I walked in and paid very close attention to the customer service I received (considering that was a main complaint). The waitress I had was enthusiastic and knowledgeable about the food. It was friend's first experience there and my waitress was patient and kind enough to ensure he got a great experience.",

    "text": "You live this life once; so why not treat yourself to a nice meal once in awhile. After hiking in Red Rock Canyon that is what my brother did. Except, that it wasn't intended for here. We headed to the Gordon Biersch in Boca Fashion Village only to find that it was gone. Bummer! In Sambalatte my brother and I went on Yelp where our fingers did the walking and the Yelpers did the talking. The Yelpers were talking positive things about Bachi Burger down Rampart Boulevard in the Village Square Shopping Center at the northwest corner of Sahara. Now it was time to do the eating.       I am no stranger to Bachi Burger. Oftentimes I drove by the Windmill at Bermuda location. I had read glowing articles about the famed burger in the local publications. Articles that included Las Vegas Weekly's reviewer Brock Radke placing Bachi Burger at number 19 in the most important restaurants of Las Vegas list.     I have been unfamiliar with the meaning of \"bachi.\" For your information, \"bachi\" means karma and a Japanese type of grill.     Bachi Burger blends in with the neighboring businesses of the renovated Village Square Shopping Center. It is hidden from both Rampart and Sahara Avenue. The movie theatre is the landmark.     On Sunday, February 14, 2016; at 6:30, we had the restaurant practically to ourselves. Immediately upon walking inside, we immediately landed a table. There were zero patrons between ourselves and the distant open kitchen. The picture below shows the restaurant scene. But anything can change in a Las Vegas minute. Near 7 pm; the tables surrounding us were filling up.     Bachi Burger reminds me more of an Asian restaurant than a burger place. I remember the drapes by the hallway leading to the restrooms. I also remember the comfortable seats and relaxing dining environment.      After examining the choices of burgers in the menu, I had my mind set on the Spicy Miso Burger plus a separate order of Just Fries, and Coke. At this point of the review, I need to bring up that a burger, fries, and beverage will come out to at least $20.      The Spicy Miso Burger was a colossal sandwich. I felt like I was in the dentist opening my mouth wide. Below is a picture of this beast of a burger. And this is a first-rate burger. The Bachi Burger website states that their burgers are made fresh from a combination of wet aged chuck, short rib and brisket certified beef. It was over and above the meat that delivered my taste buds to an elevated state of nirvana. Surrounding the Angus beef were onions, shishito pepper, mayonnaise, lettuce, roasted garlic, cheese, apple vinaigrette, and a fried egg. This brought back a recent memory on the Las Vegas Strip enjoying a unique Fukuburger. A consequence of my food exploring is an appreciation of an egg on a burger. Let me also state that in contrast to the name, there was an infinitesimal amount of spiciness in the Spicy Miso Burger. Colossal sandwiches are not meant to be enjoyed alone. The Just Fries complimented the burger. The fries were hot and fresh. They featured sea salt. The fries were part for the course of this dining adventure. This is the first time that I recall dipping fries in pineapple ketchup.      Throughout the dining adventure, our waiter Hugo provided commendable service. Past the conclusion of the meal, he never pressured my brother and I to leave when we were hanging out shooting the breeze. Additionally he was friendly.      You will live this life once. Why not experience Bachi Burger once. Local publications and several Yelpers rave about Bachi Burger. This review is confirmation that Bachi Burger lives up to the hype:   The pictures from February 14, 2016:",

At the end of over an hour ordeal, we had to wait another 20 mins b/c \"only one register was working & they're backed up.\" They def need to work out some kinks.

I was not impressed by their food. We ordered 2 different burgers and their specialty fries and everything was sweet. The fries made my tongue numb from one of the seasonings they use. Lol. I did order the wrong fries but I still had hopes that the one I got, salt pepper garlic fries was going to be good. It looks good!!! The 2 burgers we ordered were the Miyagi-san and Ronin. Again, both had a sweet taste to it, too sweet for my liking on a burger.",

    "text": "I've been here a few times now and Bachi has not yet disappointed.  If you wanna come for a premium burger that tastes even more awesome on an egg bun, do come and check out Bachi and try it out.  For me, it's been the Miyagi Wagyu burger for the win each time...but the last time we were there, one of the servers told us that the burger that all the staff has and swears by is the miso wagyu burger...he said to definitely try it the next time we come out there.  And as an added bonus, they joined up with the ramen joint a few months ago and now serve both on their menus.  I come here for the burgers, but you know me and my love relationship with ramen; so of course I tried it out too...just the tonkatsu though.  The broth wasn't as tasty as I had expected, but the chasu was prob one of the best I've had...nice and fatty and super tender.  If you can split it amongst your group, I'd definitely go for it.  The fries: sweet potato, truffle, oxtail, and regular, are all awesome, and DEFINITELY can feed more than one person, as we learned to our doom the first time we came in and each ordered fries.  The oxtail is quite heavy so you might wanna split the burger...but then again, this is vegas, INDULGE!!!!  This place can get absolutely packed, which is a sign of the good food, the popularity of the burger, and just the fact that Bachi rules!  So I would come at non-peak times, which is hard to determine for Vegas, Thursday night at around 10 the wait was 40 minutes, Saturday around 9:30 the wait was 5...so it really does follow along with the vegas theme of just gettin lucky.    PS - there's a new bigger spot also about 15 min away from the strip...but with traffic, can actually take much longer to get to, but if this place is too busy, at least you have a second option.    Staff - Great!  Esp with the recommendations and the good humor.  Thanks Bachi! :)",

    "text": "I have a love hate relationship with Bachi Burger.    Food: I've been here a couple of times and there is still not a burger that I would call my favorite or go-to burger.  All of the burgers are over $10 and they are cooked with a lot of unique Asian ingredients.  I recently had the Banh Mi inspired burger and it came with a fish sauce to dip in.  It was pretty good.  I had one in the past that was served on a purple taro bun.  Very interesting.  Sometimes I feel that there is so much going on in the burger that I kinda get lost in all the tastes trying to decipher the flavors.   I do love their oxtail chili cheese fries though.  Skinny fries slathered with soft oxtail meat and chili.  There is a crapload of scallions and a sunny side egg on top.  Delicious!  I usually come when we have visitors from LA and need to take them somewhere that will satisfy everyone, LA loves their asian fusion burgers and tacos lol.  (FYI They are building a Bachi Burger on Sawtelle in LA!)  It is kinda pricy to just come here to pick up a burger but it is a crowd pleaser.    My main gripe is there is often a long wait and a lot of tables available.  This kinda angers me and other people have experienced this problem too!  Fill your restaurant and don't tease me with empty tables that you don't plan on using.",

I'm usually seated right away which is already a good sign. We ordered the truffle parmesan fries with a special sauce that was to die for. I love the texture of the fries - not too crunchy, but not soggy.  I ordered a Kiki's burger last time I was here, so decided I wanted to try something new. Me and my boyfriend got the Miyagi burger and let me tell you it deserves a black belt. I love the fried onions with bacon and fried egg. Just thinking about it makes my mouth salivate, haha. It reminded me of a more sophisticated Tamago burger (from Fuku).   I love this place and my boyfriend does too so we will definitely be back. We still have tons of burgers and entrees to try!",

I had the kalbi burger and a sapporo. The burger was cooked perfectly with a nice hot pink center.  The homemade kimchi was great as well. The buns were warm and really fluffy. Presentation was simple, just the burger on a white plate with a side of kimchi pickles.  The burger tasted fine, but was not amazing. Fine price for what you got, but nothing special to remember. I might go back, but I probably won't get that burger again. Worth a try, but not sure about the repeat.",

I've only tried the Miyagi Burger and I don't have the guts to steer away and try anything else because it is my absolute favorite! So juicy and mouthwatering, I can't wait to go back again!   I would also suggest the oxtail chili cheese fries and the truffle fries! Soooo good!!! You will definitely not be disappointed!   Overall, awesome food and clean setting with friendly staff! See you soon Bachi!",

    "text": "Went here on a Thursday evening, the place was empty. Maybe about 6 tables were occupied. Took about 5 minutes before a server came to the table. Let's just say the service had to be coaxed the entire meal. And my glass was empty for a good 10 minutes. In short service sucks.  Food was ok. For starters we had the Kurobuta & Arabiki sausage with grain mustard, which was good, but nothing to brag about, it reminded me of a skinny kielbasa flavored beef smokies garnished with shreds of scallion, which does nothing to enhance the flavor . Also had the Truffle Parmesan fries with sundried tomato aioli. The fries needed salt, and the drizzling of porcini cream was unecesary, it only made the fries get soggy faster in places. They should've stopped with truffle oil and salt. The aioli was forgettable.   Now comes the burger, Miyagi-San burger was pretty good, although for me, flavor wise, it was incomplete. Sure, it has all the umami-ness needed to tickle the palate, Wagy beef, fried onion rings, fried egg over medium. Unfortunately it needed acid to cut the richness of the burger. So my tip is to order the Bachi pickles while you order your burger, so they come the same time. The pickles is by far the most epic plate of the evening. It was seasoned perfectly, the veggies have a nice crunch to them specially the pickled garlic.   I'd go again with friends like after work, but I won't expect much",

It was a sizable burger with a hearty serving of red onion, tomato, mixed greens, crispy tofu and a medley of grains and vegetables that comprised the patty. There was a sweet and savory glaze which was reminiscent of coconut aminos as well as soy and ginger. I also ordered the sweet potato fries. Wow, those were awesome too! Hot, perfectly cooked for a light crispy texture and sweet, are all the characteristics of a great sweet potato fry. Can't wait to return again in the near future!",

    "text": "After reading the many reviews, I was so excited to try this place. I went on Monday night and didn't have to wait long. We ordered the ronin and Kiki burger with truffle fries. After placing our order, we saw a plate of oxtail fries go by and decided we had to get them. We flagged down our waiter and asked him if we could get the oxtail fries instead of the truffle fries. He responded with that he already placed the order and it's probably too late to change our order. This was less than 5min of placing our order. So, he walked away and updated us 10min later that our food would be coming any minute now. So, we asked him if he was able to amend our order and he replied with, after taking our initial order, he put it in right away and you can't make any changes. If he were to have made changes he would have to pay out of pocket for the $5 fries we originally wanted. Excuse me? When have you ever gone to a restaurant where they can't accommodate you and the waitstaff would have to pay out of pocket because a customer changed their mind? When is it ever acceptable to respond that way to a paying customer? Isn't this a customer service industry?   I understand if we waited and food was already served, not being able to change your order, but this was seriously within minutes of placing our order we wanted to change. And we are talking about fries here!   We filled out the form they give you with the bill if you'd like the manager to call you and I even called the next day and left my name and number for the manager. No call back and it's already been 5 days.   I am so disappointed at this place. The food was good and reasonably priced. You can really taste the freshness of the food. After experiencing the lack of customer service, I would never want to eat at this establishment ever again.",

BOMB! the burgers were so juicy! and the waiter we had was very helpful and blunt in a good way. He definitely didn't sugar coat anything when recommending or (talking down) certain items on the menu. I really liked that, because it was a little more personal, and not so pushy on selling the high priced items.   I only wish there were more Asian fusion places similar to this in colorado.",

The best burger I've had is Bradley Ogden's at Caesar's, but this place is way up there too.  I usually go with the Ronin burger and it is a hearty, sweet fusion burger that sits great every time I get it.  No need to upgrade to the wagyu patty, I did it once and couldn't taste the difference...angus was just fine.  I was lucky to get the surf and turf burger last time (monthly special) and it was to die for!  The mix of beef, crab and egg were the perfect combination of flavors.  The truffle parmesan fries are great!  It's a great mix of flavors with the gravy and sauce.  We tried the peking style duck buns and they were awesome.  It's a great homage to peking style duck, and they've again mixed the flavors wonderfully.  All in all, great food and great service.  It hits up your asian burger tastes, so try it for a unique burger experience.",

He never ask how the food or burgers were.   We had to flag down another server for refill and extra napkins. But guess what the servers were hovering around the white tables.  It took 10 min to get a to go box but the check go to the table before I  took my last bit of burger.  Guess they did not want us there i guess we are the wrong demographic for the restaurant.  as a  chef I would be ashamed of my staff and I am a chef for the past 15 years in Vegas. Left the place disappointed and felt like we were not  welcome there.  I could got a better service at a Mcdonald.  .",

Our party has several different burgers and all were delicious and done as requested. The fries were great and ample enough to share. Service was great... our waiter was attentive and knowledgeable when we couldn't decide which burger to order!   Top it off with the salty caramel marshmallow shake for dessert... to die for! Really... just when you thought they couldn't do anything different with a shake. Kinda like a sundae in a glass, but with the subtle nuance of sweet and salty and an awesome homemade marshmallow.  Be prepared to wait... always a line!",

The servers were friendly and on top of things.  We had a cobb salad to start that was large and delicious and then we had two burgers and a side of salt and pepper garlic fries.  I can't tell you what was my favorite but we finished every bite.  I had the Kiki burger, mushrooms, gruyere, sweet onion marmalade and caramelized bacon.  After the first bite on this fluffy bun with so many delicious, perfectly balanced ingredients, I got really excited.  It was so perfectly balanced, well cooked, and juicy.  The boy got the spicy miso burger which was just as good!  The fries were absurd.  Everything was good.  Try as many things as possible.  We even got some donuts for dessert that were delicious.  Try the Vietnamese coffee at the end of the night with the sweetened condensed milk.  yum.  yum.  Not sure what else to say, I wish I could go back tonight!",

I ordered the Miyagi burger, medium.  Hubby ordered a basic hamburger with cheese.  The bun is certainly tasty.  My meat was tasty, but slightly overcooked and a little dry.  I appreciated the effort at the unique flavor combinations in the burgers, but I don't feel like the execution was as great as I was expecting.  My husband, not a fan of sweet potato fries, said they were the best he's ever had and actually ate the bulk of the \"fry cone\" that we ordered.  That's a good thing, I suppose.  Service was good.  Drinks were consistently full.  I love that they offer iced green tea.  Always a nice touch.  Overall, it was okay.  I wouldn't be adverse to coming back and trying something different, but there are plenty of other burger places I'd like to go to first.",

Spicy Miso burger, delicious! It's kinda messy but so worth it... all you need are extra napkins!! The Crusty Crab (crab cake sandwich) was awesome. I put the garlic chili aioli on the crab cake. It was so good!! The crab cake has corn in it which gave it a good texture. Bachi Burger is for sure by far the best food ever! Our waitress was friendly and sweet and our waters were filled the whole dinner. Awesome job at pre bussing! Before we left I got a caramel salted toasted marshmallow milk shake... I freakin loved it! Tasted unlike any other milkshake I've ever had with an actual toasted melty marshmallow on top! There is another location in Henderson on Windmill & Bernuda check it out!! *you can even see a celebrity every now and then! ;o) If your a local or just visiting you need to try Bachi Burger and keep going back! There's so many things to try!!",

I gotta say I have been a fan of Bachi Burger since day one, but I really like the Sahara location the best.    The actual restaurant is larger and the menu is larger too.  We got our fried calamari (which is not on the menu at windmill) and a manga burger.  They were both wonderful.  I really loved the plantation tea too, which they also don't have at windmill that I know of.  Its sweet ice tea but I think it has pineapple juice and mint in it too.  We had the pork belly buns too, and they were as good as ever.  I know since they had been on Diners, drive-ins, and dives they were gonna be even busier but I hope they are still gonna have room for us that have been devotees since day one.",

They tasted old and there was some brown crap on them that didn't taste at all like truffles. I made it very clear to the server that I was very allergic to hot peppers. The sauce for my bao was very full of chiles. I just tasted it and I am still having an allergic reaction to it. My bao was dry without a sauce. The buns weren't quite done. My Wife's burger was OK, but nothing at all special. Her \"grilled onions\" were so thick that they were raw onions in the middle. We won't be back.",

The host rushed back to the table and threw the silverware down in hurry to greet the next guests... Next another server brings us waters and throws the straws on the table and takes off .. no interaction at all.. we wait 5 minutes fir another server to take our drink order (mind you there is only 5 other tables seated, and about 5 servers, so why a wait. Idk) he brings back our sodas and takes off... Wtf!! We look over the menu and wait another 5 minutes and yet another server comes to take our food order. We order 2 burgers an order of fries and calamari... The calamari comes out quickly so I feel ok so far... About 7 minutes go by and we finish the calamari and look forward to our burgers, but no server comes to our table. (Keep in mind there are only at this point 5 other tables. The two tables next to us order there burgers when we got the calamari and theres came out 10 minutes before ours) so we wait, and wait. Our server keeps walking past us,not ever glancing over to see that we are ready. Finally after about 20 minutes after we finished the appetizer our burgers (my boyfriend's first, then 2 minutes later mine) comes out. Fries were hot, burgers looked like they were forgotten about and left under heat lamps, and were not that impressive. I never received a soda refill, and we had to flag down a server for the check. I will not be back to this place again.. maybe I will try the bachi burger in henderson. Epic fail",

I've been there twice for hamburgers, and yesterday for a turkey burger.  My brother ordered the same meal, and we did not enjoy it at all - every ingredient is loaded with salt, and he isn't salt sensitive!  We ordered a small side of cole slaw, which was not only salt-laden but had an offensive flavor.  We asked the server to take the slaw back and remove it from our bill, but when the tab came it was still on there, and she said it could not be taken off.  She got the manager, who said to us, \"we don't remove charges from bills here.  When I go out to eat and order something I don't like, I don't order it there again.\"  (yeah, right!  Imagine if we had sent our turkey burgers back and had to pay for them plus replacement meals!!)  He then decided to remove the charge - a whole whopping $1.50!!  They've lost our business forever!  Customer service is sorely lacking!  I also want to note that they are famous for their milk shakes, yet they only have one blender in which to make them.  So if two of you are dining, expect to see your milk shakes arrive 20 minutes apart!!!   Inexcusable in our book!!",

    "text": "All you Yelpers out there, you are responsible for this.  Grin.  I have been reading so many reviews about Bachi Burger.  I got that holiday weekend craving for a burger, so I figured it was a SIGN.  Based on all the reviews, I decided to try the Kiki Burger.  I am salivating just thinking about that meal.  It was such a nice combination of flavors.    The Kiki Burger is described on the menu as:  Angus Beef  Sauteed Shiitake, Enoki &  Eryngii Mushrooms  Caramelized Bacon Sweet Onion Marmalade  Aged Gruyere Cheese Garlic Chili Aioli  =$10  I decided not to get anything else, just to focus on the burger along with the Plantation Iced Tea.  I am from the South so I know a thing or two about iced tea.  The tea was so nice and refreshing, with pineapple, mint and simple syrup to sweeten.    I loved the very cool modern decor and the even cooler chill lounge music, if you call it that.  The whole restaurant had a very trendy, modern but casual vibe.  This is certainly a place I want to bring my friends.  Oh-yeah right, they've probably all already been here.  Still, I very much look forward to coming back soon and try the other creations.    I loved the food, the atmosphere and the experience.  My only suggestion would be to think about cutting back the simple syrup in the tea maybe 1/3?  Let's get a group together and go back!!! Yummy!",

Just make sure they don't forget to bring you the Herb Pesto sauce on the side. Come here when it's busy - you'll get served faster.

Wasn't crowded, so quiet enough to spend some time talking with the staff.  Kyle is a new server, great kid, by the end of the meal, we got some of his dry humor to come out.  Chef Chris, what can I say other than your food is art.  And your humor made the meal awesome.  Started with the truffle fries, recommend this since the flavor is amazing but lite. Then shifted to the ox tail chili fries, once again amazing, but can overpower the delicacy of the burgers, went with Kyle's recommendation.... out of this world.  Go here for amazing food, and a great dining experience with genuine staff.",

They didn't disappoint! I wish there was more oxtail though. The burgers were stacked high, which is always appealing. The burgers don't come with fries or chips which I find a bit weird. I recommend Kiki's Burger! It's was good, cooked to my specifications, and the cheese was just great. I have a soft spot for fancy cheese. Overall, it was a good experience. I'll definitely go back or check out their other location as well.",

I can't remember the name of the burger I ate but it was tall and delicious. The buns were so soft they were like clouds. The fries we had were also really good.

Highly disappointed. There was no hostess to greet, it was not busy at all but yet we waited to get greeted, waited 10 min for a table (when all I can see were empty chairs) Then once seated underneath our table and the table next to us was so dirty with food and broken glass; it was beyond disgusting. Then waited another 15 min until Are waiter decided to show up. He took our drinks and asked him if we can place our order as well. He said no. (LOL) My husband went to the restroom and came back to say it smells like it hadn't been cleaned in months. At that point, WE LEFT! Someone needs to get Gordon Ramsey in here to clean the place up and find good management before this place has to shut down.",

She ordered for us: Oxtail chili cheese fries as our appetizer and Spicy Miso burgers.  I had never had oxtails in my life, and after finding out what it was several year back I didn't want to. My friend convinced me to try the oxtail fries, and surprisingly they were really good. I just couldn't get over the fact that I was eating cow tails. Yes, I am a wimp.  After snacking on the fries, I had high expectations for my burger. The burger wasn't bad, it just wasn't special. You can definitely tell that quality ingredients go into the burger, but the flavor was kind blah. Nothing sets it apart for any other quality burger. Maybe I ordered the wrong thing? I only ate half.. that never happens!  It's a bit pricey for a burger, but I think walking in you kind of expect it. The service is awesome.. everyone kind of helps you out. I don't think I will return due to my personal preference, but I do recommend checking it out at least once.",

It was nice of them and I enjoyed it!  *Taro milk tea with boba - It was decent, but didn't have enough boba.   *Vietnamese Coffee -  Delicious, but may be too sweet for some.   *Truffle Parmesan fries - Yum! Not a fan of their sun dried tomato aioli dipping sauce, but perfect without it.  *Kiki's burger- Slightly sweet due to the sweet onion marmalade, ordered it medium and it was cooked perfectly, delicious garlic chili aioli sauce served on the side.  *Bachi Fish- Not what I expected, but very good! Very messy, so ask for extra napkins.   *Mandarin Orange Tangerine soda - So good! You must try this if you're a citrus fan.  * Trio of assorted ice cream sandwiches:   Pistachio- This is one of my favorite ice cream flavors, so it's no surprise I liked it.  Black sesame- Surprisingly delicious! My favorite of the three.  Maple nut- Not sweet enough. Not as good as I expected.  I would love to go back and try some of their other menu items. So many things sound delicious!",

    "text": "For years, every time I have read any kind of poll for burgers in Las Vegas, Bachi Burger is at or near the top. We finally tried it and were not particularly impressed. Don't get me wrong, the burger was quite good and tasty but not $16 tasty. This place is what I call a \"hipster foo-foo\" restaurant...they cater to those who want their kind of atmosphere. That's fine but we look for good taste and quality food. My wife had a $9 appetizer which consisted of two meatballs so our total bill for a hamburger, fries, and two meatballs (no drinks), was $34.   My wife's meatballs were tasty but without all the kale and other unknown, inedible stuff they used for garnish artistically placed on the plate, they would have looked quite plain. I asked if they made their own fries and the waiter said they do but that was not True. I was given a frozen product which was pretty good for what it was but I do not like it when a restaurant brags about it's homemade food then give me French fries they bought frozen in a bag.   It was also VERY loud...there were people yelling and whooping it up the entire time we were there so we couldn't speak to each other.   In short, we found Bachi Burger to be quite overrated. If  atmosphere is more important than the food and you are a \"hipster dude\", this may be the place for you. Otherwise, you're better off spending $10 at Five Guys or even $5 at In-N-Out and just having a good hamburger.",

After my horrible service experience when the original Bachi opened a few years back, I have turned into a huge fan that raves about this place to everyone. There's a really good chance that if you are coming to visit me in Vegas, you will be going to Bachi Burger. My favorite is the Miyagi-San burger. About as perfect of a burger as I have ever had and blows away anything else in Vegas at that price point. I mean, honestly you can get an amazing burger at Bachi for about twice the price of a Carl's Jr burger and won't feel like you know what after you eat it.  If you haven't been to Bachi yet, you are missing out. I like the decor and atmosphere of this location a bit more than the original. Don't like that I live pretty much right in the middle of both of them and it takes about 15 minutes or so to get to either of them. Can't they open up next door to my place??? I promise I'll come at least once or twice a week!!! Pretty please!!!",

On both occasions that I've come here, I was assisted by Bobby, a young fellow who is well educated of the food and drinks provided as well as helpful in recommendations of other burgers. He seemed dedicated to keeping your drinks filled up and letting all of the newcomers know what they're eating (it's fusion, you might find it to be a little weird). Only catch is that he did take awhile on the check, but he was the only person working the tables and you can't really blame him.  Atmosphere: 5/5  On both occasions, the place was not loud like most places seemed to be, no screaming kids, no loud conversations, no tinking and crashes of the silverware, just  unique music and a mellow atmosphere feeling. The place is clean and organized and original art is hung up on the walls throughout the restaurant. It is never overcrowded and there is never a wait on a table.   Food: 7/5  The food is PERFECT. The bun, soft like a warm donut, the unique flavors within the buns, things like fried egg, onion, peppers and sauces. You will be caught off guard by the flavors of your food. I had the Spicy Miso burger on both occasions and was impressed both times, not to mention it looked appetizing. The garlic fries, skinny,  with jalapeno slices in it, and a hint of lime, with a side of a sauce that you don't know what it is but you can't get enough of it. It's all there. It's perfect. I can't necessarily say much, you just have to try for yourself. Just a heads up, the way they cook it is a bit weird so if you typically eat a medium cooked burger, get a medium well.",

I had guest with me and we were all amazed at the lack of class and customer service, at the end the customer is the reason why she has a job!",

Everything here is amazing and is different than any other burger place i have tried... Definitely a must visit to anyone coming to Las Vegas...  My only concern is the service, if it wasn't for the amazing food i would never come to this place. The wait staff really seem to not be helpful although the managers seem to be making the rounds checking on the guests...  Such a shame that this place cant be perfect because of the wait staff...  If you wanna try something new and very different but dont want to risk not liking it, go to Bachi Burger...",

    "text": "Is it bad that I wanted to order everything?!  After reading the reviews and seeing Diners, Drive-ins & Dives, my husband I knew we had to try this place.  I ordered the Sangria + sake.  Delicious!  1. Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries, with Garlic Aioli, Fried Egg. $11.50 *Anything with a fried egg = I'm game.  The fries had a great flavor by themselves but the entire dish was yummy.  The oxtail chili & cheese was exactly what you expect (the oxtail is shredded) and the garlic aioli is a perfect compliment.  Would order again!  This is DEFINITELY enough to share (there was 4 of us!)  2. Miyagi-sans Grass Fed Wagyu Burger, Chili Mayo, Fried Egg, Furikake, Caramelized Bacon, Crispy Onion Rings; $13.00 *Three out of the four of us at the table ordered this burger.  Holy delicious onion rings!  The burger was cooked perfectly (I ordered it Medium), the bun of soft, but held it's own, the caramelized bacon was exactly that, fried egg worked well.  But seriously, the onion rings stole the whole show for me.  I am going to order just a side of these next time!  I was extremely full after eating all of this.  But the drink menu from the milkshakes to the boba, to the iced matcha green tea, to the tea latte's, I had this urge to order like 4 different things just to drink, but I knew the food had to reign supreme.  Next time I'll get some onion rings, a milkshake and some dessert since I didn't get to sample them this time.  I'll be back!",

By the way, check out the owners response to my post, my name is not even Cindy, his response doesn't even have anything with the cold fries, and it seems like he just cut and paste one of his previous response to mine, how sad is that?",

There were so many different tastes going on within this burger, I can't wait to go back! I want to try everything on the menu.  There was also a sign outside that mentioned they were going to be filming \"DDD\" (Food Network) on June 18th. I'm SO there.  2 thumbs up!",

Me and my husband viewed an episode of diners, diners, and drives (triple D) through the food network featuring this joint so we decided to try it out and oh my goodness!  Heaven in your mouth,  but will be honest, you should be a burger and Asian infused cuisine.  We are never disappointed.  Dos is delish, a mouthful,  can be a bunch of messy goodness,  but taste bud heaven.  Service is always great,  friendly and prompt.  I've been to this location and the original location in Henderson.  Can't wait to try out the location in cali!",

    "text": "This burger straight-up knocked me on my ass. I came here having never heard of Bachi Burger before, and got (with a group) the oxtail chili fries, Kiki's burger, and the trio of ice cream sandwiches. There's no doubt in my mind that it was the best meal I've eaten in 2013. It might be the best three-course meal I've eaten for under $20 in my life. Are you freaking kidding me?  The oxtail chili fries were subtle and smoky, well spiced, had a gorgeous texture. I could have eaten the whole plate. The trio of ice cream sandwiches was a most singular dessert: high quality chocolate, not-terribly-sweet ice cream, and shortbread cookies (paired to the ice creams) witha  decadent nuttiness to them. I was already ludicrously full from the burger, but the ice cream sandwiches kept me coming back, nibble by nibble, to wonder: \"Wait, what's THAT flavor? How do THESE textures work together?\"  That sums up the whole meal, actually: the food was conceived with a level of attentiveness I associate with only the most elite of restaurants. The components of the dishes were all not just high quality, but arranged thoughtfully and playfully with the greatest possible attention to the balance of textures, smells, temperatures, spiciness/sweetness/umaminess/piquancy. The whole is more than the sum of its parts.  Kiki's Burger (angus beef -- caramelized on the outside, perfect juicy medium inside; onion marmalade; dressed greens; three kinds of mushrooms; caramelized bacon; aged gruyere; probably other awesome stuff that I'm forgetting) was the only burger I've ever eaten with motherfucking STAR POWER and that's all I'm going to say about it.  This chain is going to be bigger than Umami Burger. You're not going to be able to get a table at the LA location. In ten years there'll be frozen Bachi Burgers in the aisle of your latest supermarket. This chain is going to blow the heck UP. And I for one am going to eat here as often as I can (strawberry guava cheesecake next time? please!) before everyone finds out about it.",

    "text": "The day I came to eat here, I felt so bad, because I was \"THAT\" person. I didn't pay attention to the time and with no time left, I convinced my husband that we should absolutely try this place. Of course I didn't pull my head out of my a** until after we ordered a ton of food, and I realized that it was very unrealistic to even think that we would be finished within 20min.  (SMH... i know that's exactly what i was thinking--I'm such an as*^ole!)    And that's when it happened, that's when I turned into \"THAT\"  person. --The person that just ordered their meal, and two seconds later wonders how much longer it will be.  -The person who now has the patience of a 5 year old, and is forced due to their own stupidity and poor time management to tell the server to rush all the food -The person who asks for to-go boxes and the check as soon as the food hits the table. -The person who is frantically trying to hand over a credit card while inhaling food out of to-go boxes ( note to self: if you are in a hurry, then pay with cash!!!! )  I am so sorry for being \"THAT\" person.   :( I couldn't even enjoy the food, because I was inhaling it so fast...   Either way, that is exactly why I love this place! They completely rose to the challenge! Not only did they serve us with a smile an absolute kindness, the food was incredible! They got me out on time, were very attentive, and even let me take \"happy hour\" food home  (which I don't think they were supposed to, since their as**ole manager thought his staff and customers would appreciate him loosing his temper over it on the floor when he witnessed me receiving a to-go box.  FYI- pointing at a table that is occupied, when you look like you are about to pop a vein, and simultaneously insist on raising your voice while disciplining an employee in the dining room that is full of customers, is not only poor management, but its inappropriate and it also may affect business. Just sayin... )  Anyway, the staff (minus management) was amazeballs!!! I absolutely recommend this place! And am planning on returning on a day that will allow me to enjoy the experience to the fullest.",

Pros: Burgers are excellent, usually cooked right. Very very tasty combinations. They have beer which is great for a high quality burger. Locations are convenient in different parts of town.  Cons: Way over-priced, about 25% more than I'd expect to pay. Fries are gross because they are those shoe-string style that are basically 1% potato and 99% batter. Most locations very busy and food comes out very slowly.  Will eat here again sporadically because the burgers are just so damn tasty. Wish they'd change their fries and lower their prices though, then I'd come weekly.",
