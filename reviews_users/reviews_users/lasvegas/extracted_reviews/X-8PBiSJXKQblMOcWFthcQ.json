I thought the decor was great, very Instagram-able. Be aware that it is definitely a \"lively\" environment. The food was top tier; I especially enjoyed the kimchi fried rice, the spicy pork BBQ, and the eggplant schnitzel.  A lot of spice, a lot of flavor! I felt the menu was very reasonably priced considering it's location and the quality of our experience. Already planning to return!",

Wound have given 5 stars if customer service would have been up to par. Your no longer a food truck your in a casino that has return customers not just tourist. Roy you need to teach the restaurant staff customer service skills.",

Also if an entree is not brought out with the other person's meal, please let them know the status, like sorry the other entree is coming right up or it may take a few extra minutes, no problem. We waited for awhile until second entree came out. Food was great! The highlight was meeting the owner :) The place was nicely decorated and had the LA vibe and style to it including the music, overall, we would go back just not go out of our way to go back.",

    "text": "I rarely give a restaurant 5 stars since I always believe that everyone needs room for improvement.  However, this restaurant exceed my expectation.  So, it was a long day for our family and we got to the hotel around 9:00pm.  We were hungry, tired and cold.  We decided to stay in our hotel and find something to eat inside to avoid the cold weather and of course the walk.  We wanted to try the restaurant so we called ahead to see if it's still opens.  They told us that the restaurant is closed as all tables were reserved ahead of time.  Disappointedly, we came down stair planning to eat at La La Noodle.  Then we decided to take a chance and came in to Best Friend to ask for a table.  It was almost 10:00pm.  The hostess told us that the dining room is full and we can sit at the bar for dinner, so of course yes lol ...  the bar only had 2 seaters left but the server at the bar was nice enough to get us extra chair to fit 3 people at the bar.  Services were excellent, servers were friendly, sweet, and very attentive.  When the food took long time to come out (we did not care as we enjoyed talking and enjoying the vibe from the restaurant), she apologized repeatedly and offered us some stickers to choose from.  The vibes were awesome for me, Asian hip hop with a little funk and a little punk to it.  Here is about the food:  - Pork belly Chagu bowl:  it was a flavor explosion in my mouth.  I put one big scoop in my mouth and everything works; warm rice, saltiness of the pork belly, citrus from the pickled radish and brocolini, sweetness from the green salsa and cheese, spiciness from the red salsa.  Wow ... it is comfort food for me.  It could cure any hangover lol   - Spicy cold noodle (hubby dish - vegetarian):  different from classic Korean cold noodle.  When I had a bite, it was overly citrus for me.  It was sour that makes me puckered.  As you all know, I am weak with citrus lol.  I think it needs some salt and more fresh vegetables or herbs like cucumbers to balance out the citrus.  - Spicy pork BBQ (brother-in-law dish):  classic Korean dish and taste.  Nothing I have not had at Authentic Korean restaurant in the past.  Rice was extra for the dish.    - Banchan was not free (bummer).  I love banchan with Korean food.  If they make banchan free then it would have been even better.  Overall, I would not hesitate to come back to this restaurant when I am in town.  Definitely will try to make reservation to be in the dining room next time :)",

I understand the concept is Asian fusion but the dishes I tried were overwhelmed with sauces and oil. I had popcorn shrimp, unit fried rice and bbq short ribs. The short ribs will be my pick but it was super overpriced. Dessert was the mango pudding. This is a must try, it was a bit too sweet for my taste but overall this is the one I'm impressed the most. Best friend was a cool experience but I will not come back. I would rather go to Eataly next door",

The kimchi fried rice was abysmal,  just a soggy heap of rice with absolutely nothing in it that tastes like kimchi or even remotely flavorful.  If I were blindfolded and going on taste alone I would have guessed I was at a TGI FRIDAYS or some other Sysco supplied dump. Blech. Roy, please pack your knives and go.",

Waiters in the BF track suits, 90-00 underground hip hop on the speakers, old school Asian glamour shots in the menus (including a shot of the Beat Junkies) and the Kogi Short Rib Tacos reminiscent from the Kogi trucks that breeded the tacos 10 years ago.  Negatives - overpriced and the night we attended (new year's day) they didn't serve the Chego Pork Belly or the Uni Dynamite dishes.  How can you not have some menu items on New Years Day?!?! We were disappointed considering those were well recommended, plus my mother-in-law wanted to order it.  So she was already disappointed.  They also charge $3 for a small bowl of white rice, and banchan is $4 each.  Majority of dishes are a la carte and portions aren't large.  Don't get me wrong, the Kalbi short ribs and Kogi Tacos were good, but while I was eating and thinking of how much I was spending, I also was thinking I could just do a run to Greenland Korean Market and cook myself up similar tasting Kalbi ribs for a quarter of the price.  We ordered the Octopus and my father-in-law said there were too many veggies, not enough octopus.  Soondubu was good and filling and had similar flavor and spiciness as the Octopus.  I do love Roy bringing the old school LA scene, music and food tradition into Vegas though.  I want to give the resto another shot hoping the pork belly is in stock next time.",

The menu is also a comprehensive collection of Choi's popular LA restaurants Kogi, Pot, Commissary, and A-Frame. Our meal started with a fluffy Hawaiian bun, which was perfect. We had some kimchi banchan also. The kimchi fried rice was excellent, but it was served in an enamel cast iron dutch oven which made me overly careful to not scratch. We tried the OG ribs, but this one was too dried out. The dumplings were also flavorful and had a silky thin skin. In the end, we had the bingsu topped with yummy foam and condensed milk, which at the time was dragonfruit flavored. It had white dragonfruit pieces and the sorbetto was a pink dragonfruit. Roy Choi was also around.",

I ordered the watermelon tequila cocktail and it was to die for; super refreshing and actually had a good amount of alcohol. For food, we ordered the Kimchi Fried Rice, Chilli Pasta, Dumplings, and tacos. Every dish was great and flavorful! I really wish I could've fit more in my belly because the KBBQ looked so good at the tables next to us.

Their small plate options make it easy to try a variety off the menu but the plates are quite small. Think before you order and look at the pictures online for reference.   We enjoyed our drinks and the friendly service. I'd bring back tourists but not necessarily the locals.",

    "text": "One of the best eating experiences I've ever had.   When you arrive, the front bar is made to look like the inside of a corner liquor store and it's a really cool vibe. Very causal and relaxed with a few high tables and some seats at the bar.   Then, as you get taken to your seats, it's like you go through two sets of doors that lead you to a completely different world. Modern, sophisticated but at the same time down to Earth and not pretentious in the least. There was a live DJ playing great music and I'm pretty sure this is the first time I've ever danced in my seat all of the way through dinner.   But enough with the ambiance, let's get to the food.   We ordered four of the banchan (Cucumbers, kimchi, broccolini and daikon), elote and BBQ kalbi (short ribs).   As you can tell, it's a bit of an odd combination, Korean and Mexican but that's part of what's so fun about Best Friend, the menu is kinda all over the place but in an amazing way.   The banchan were all very good and the elote and BBQ kalbi were flat out amazing!   All in al, Best Friend was one of the biggest highlights of our weekend in Vegas.",

    "text": "Ah - I finally got to try Roy Choi's new Vegas stop and sure enough, it feels like a 'best hits' of his LA restaurants as well as some fun ideas that fits the Vegas mold.   Best Friend can be found near the 'middle' of Park MGM (if you come in through Eataly from the street-side, it's to your right just as you hit the casino floor / if you come in through the lobby, head towards Eataly, it'll be towards your left side). The decor is the first big thing that you'll notice. There's two sections - the first being a really bombastic, old-school and bright bar filled with different merchandise. Go through the construction-like hangings though to the other side and you get a much more chic and stylish restaurant that had a DJ the Thursday I stopped by and some beautiful artwork all-around that is much more dimly lit. I sat at the bar - I had a RSVP but the restaurants was about 75% full when I arrived.   Food and cocktails-wise I tried: +Hawaiian Bread: You get a free Hawaiian bread as you sit down. Not bad - love that someone comes around with a pan and plops it down in front of you.  +Uni Bowl: The uni bowl is smaller than you think it will be but is super, super rich. Some will think it's a bit salty but the dish I think is delicious. You get a few pieces of uni and a lot of the coverings that you see on a speciality oyster dish. It's super fascinating and worth a try if you're a fan of these types of dishes.  +The Seasonal Veggies: An okay helping of random veggies. I think I would get one of the banchans instead next time but if you have a group and are looking for some greens, it's not a bad mixture. Just pretty straightforward.  +The Arugula Cocktail: I wasn't sure what to make of this but the cocktail in the end was a good mix. Fresh and tangy.   Kudos to the bartender - he was not only super friendly (free shots to those at the bar when we were there - some midori mixture) but also was cutting corn and super good on his explanations.   Prices are high which is typical for being on the Vegas strip but still disappointing to see when you're given smaller portions. No big complaints though overall!",

    "text": "We had reservations for 2 on a Friday night and it was about a month since the grand opening. We were staying at Park MGM this time so it was very convenient to simply get ready for dinner and make our way down to the casino level to eat.  First impression is one of sensory overload. From the liquor store feel of the front bar area to the LA poster wall to the hundreds of stickers on the counters to the alcoholic slushies (jameson & ginger, hennesey & cola, etc.)... it was all so crazy. So you gotta know that what looks to be the area of the liquor store cash register is where you check in for dinner. If your table isnt quite ready yet, they will politely ask you to wait or have a drink at the bar and they will come get you. We waited about 5 minutes before we were brought in to the main dining area. You go through 2 sets of heavyweight plastic curtains like a meat locker has. Then boom... The dining area is totally different. If you've been to any of Roy Choi's restaurants in the past then you will see some similar design cues. The suspended plants and greenery reminded me a bit of the Commissary and the clean and modern aesthetic of the dining tables reminded me of Pot and the lobby of the Line hotel.   Did I mention there is a DJ? He played such good music throughout the night. Everything from classic hip hop to R&B to MoTown classics. I really loved the vibe. I also loved the photos of Los Angeles that are on either ends of the dining hall. I know some of those photos were done by Travis Jensen so it was great to see them up close and displayed inside Best Friend... The photos that accompanied the menu were something else. It was great to see flashback photos like that. If you're from LA or anywhere in Cali, you will get it. It was cool to see old photos of the Beat Junkies and K-Town folks. It was crazy to see a photo of some gangsters from back in the day that we knew. Wasnt expecting that one... Haha.  We started off with some banchan. We went with the daikon and the cucumber. ($4 each). I liked the daikon but it was a little spicy for me. I love daikon but I just couldnt eat too much of it. The cucumbers were great. They had a spiciness to them as well but the sesame flavor added to them made it so tasty. Really good. I would get it again for sure. The complimentary warm Hawaiian bread rolls were great and a nice beginner to the meal.   We next got the pork and beef dumplings ($12). These were really good. They also come with ginger and tofu and a spicy dipping sauce. Very tasty and I recommend it. Next we got the Chego pork belly bowl ($18). I was glad they had this because I have yet to dine at Chego. This dish also comes with fried egg, broccoli, radish, cotija and peanuts. This was a good sized bowl, perfect for 2-3 people. The pork belly was tender. The fried egg and rice were perfect together. It also comes with a spicy sauce that the pork belly is slathered in. It was a little spicy for me after a while. I dont eat very spicy so the menu challenged that a little bit but I was game. I ate all that I could for sure... The last dish we had was the Kogi short rib tacos ($12). The world famous. This takes me back to the Alibi Room and Undefeated/Stussy parties where the Kogi trucks would  post up and feed us along La Brea Ave. Classic times... The tacos came with healthy portion of korean bbq, a chili-soy slaw, red salsa and cilantro, onion and lime to squeeze. These tacos were delicious and better than I even remember. You have to get them if you have never had them before.  Service was great. Our server was a riot... They are all dressed in Adidas track suits and the bussers wear shorts, high socks and crusher hats. We really enjoyed our dinner at Best Friend. To those people that dont get it or question the design and execution of the place, just let Chef Roy Choi take you on a tour of the senses... a tour through Koreatown Los Angeles through his eyes... Thanks Chef! And we appreciated you coming around to say hello and shake hands with all the diners that night. We'll be back again for sure...",

The place is unique and quirky, even the entrance (you gotta go thru a store looking place to get to the restaurant). Love the decor and the throwback 1980s hip-hop uniforms. Walking in, the smell of the food is amazing! Our waiter was Corey and he was cool, but his sidekick, \"Hot Scott\", was super awesome. He recommended all sorts of food, had good conversation, and kept us laughing. He has a way of making you feel like you're a special table, even though I'm sure he makes everyone feel that way.. haha. We weren't that hungry, so we tried the kogi short rib tacos and the garlic chicken. The tacos were on the spicy side, so I wouldn't order them again, but if you're a fan of spice, you'll love these! However, the flavor and the tenderness of the garlic chicken was super good. I'll definitely go back for those and to try some other stuff!",

    "text": "I saw the buzz of this place during the soft opening by LA's Roy Choi who looks like Jackie Chan. Walked in and straight away not a fan. I wouldn't take a date here and wouldn't post up here either. I get the concept scheme but it's not my kind of place. None of it makes sense and maybe it's not suppose to. I don't fit the clientele here. Maybe they were going for a themed establishment to lure customers. I tried to give it a chance but still walked out feeling eew. Yelp says Hot & New but I left feeling hot & eew.       The feel is like walking into an East Coast Bodega in a dodgy neighborhood but with very poor lighting. On the West Coast I'd compare it to walking into an off brand liquor store that has random items like Ramen and candy on the shelves. The table tops are plastered with sticker graffiti. It feels like they cleared some shelves and put chairs to sit in. It also feels like hanging out inside of an ice cream truck. This is the entrance bar area.       No one comes to help you, if you didn't know that the restaurant was thru the plastic curtain that looks like a walk in fridge you wouldn't know it's back there. No one comes to help you or tell you how anything works. So if you walk in you'll only see the bar entrance area not the restaurant in the back. Workers wear track suits so you walk right past them trying to find someone who works there or where to check in at. Again made no sense to me.        The menu is Korean Mexican which I don't get either. It was packed with people watching a big game. Loud drunks blurting profanities and yelling at the football players like the players can hear while kids, children sat a few feet away. That wasn't cool either. If this is your scene here's a new place on the strip. Totally not my kind of place and a bad experience on the strip.  Mel M  Yelp 19:2",

    "text": "I have a ton of respect for Roy Choi and what he's done as a Korean-American chef in LA, so naturally I was super excited to try his new restaurant during a trip to Vegas. Very quirky and interesting concept, which is very clear from the moment you walk in.  We had a group of 4, and we had a few dishes in mind for what we wanted to order but wanted some guidance on the amount of food that would be ideal for the size of our party. We told our server what dishes we were thinking, and she suggested taking 1 item off so we did. She then recommended a starter that we hadn't picked, which would've been perfectly fine, but she was aggressively adamant that we would love it and wrote it down as part of our order without telling us. Rude. She only took it off after my friend explicitly told her that we didn't want to order it. Making recommendations is one thing. Pressuring us to pay for something we're not interested in is another. Annoying.  In a little while, we started getting what we ordered:  - Uni Dynamite Rice: So close to being amazing, but there was an unexpectedly large amount of sriracha mayo which I found a little unnecessary and made it a little heavy. Make that uni shine, it doesn't need mayo! The menu says sriracha in the description but doesn't say \"mayo\" or even \"aioli\" anywhere, so we were a little thrown off by this.   - Chego Pork Belly Bowl: This was pretty good. Probably the best dish of the night.  - Kalbi: Not bad, not great. A little chewy.  - Complimentary warm Hawaiian buns: Really enjoyed this!   - Itaewon: This was clearly a play on budae jjigae and by far the largest part of our meal, but we were so disappointed to taste that it was SO OVERWHELMINGLY SALTY. You could see that it was reduced down HEAVILY, to the point where it wasn't a stew anymore - It was thick almost like the texture of a heavy clam chowder. Even with the salt factor aside, it also...did not look or taste like budae jjigae. It tasted more like the seasoning you'd use for maeuntang (Koreans, you know what I'm talking about - They are not the same).   We ended up feeling super full at the end of our meal, largely because the Itaewon was so salty and we had to eat it with much more rice in an attempt to dilute the flavor.   When our server came by and asked us if we were done, we told her that we were full, and then she proceeded to say, \"I told you, I was right about not ordering another thing!\" We laughed it off, but she came by another TWO TIMES to repeatedly tell us \"I told you so\" and to remind us again that we were wrong to consider ordering more food. Seriously?!  Overall, we all thought that the food ended up just being okay and the service was straight up annoying. I can't imagine that this is what Chef Roy Choi envisioned. There are endless amazing options in Vegas, both on the strip and off, so I don't think I'd go back.",

The dishes that were brought out were short rib tacos,  banchan, slippery shrimp, garlic chicken, Korean style pork, and date cake. Honestly, the only dish that really stood out were the short rib tacos. Everything else was good, but nothing I can't get in a regular Korean or Chinese restaurant closer to me. Great for tourists who don't want to go to Chinatown for this kind of food. If there's a next time, I'll definitely avoid that set menu and order something more unique.",

    "text": "Mostly viewing \"fusion\" as an inauthentic means to please a wider variety of customers it was with interest but skepticism that Best Friend was approached on Saturday, Roy Choi's first foray into Las Vegas a long way from the Kogi Trucks that made him famous but the space at Park MGM somehow pulling off the combination of Bodega, Restaurant and Bar with polish and poise.      Located proximate to the former home of Andre's, recently-opened Eataly looming large next door, it is passing by neon that reads \"Roy Choy Is My Best Friend\" that diners will find themselves surrounded by merchandise both for show and for purchase, the hostess stand easily missed next to translucent red curtains dividing Bar from Dining Room where Hip Hop plays at modest volume.  Keeping Television at the Bar, the flowing interior instead focused on murals and illuminated street scenes beneath hanging plants, it was in a booth on the left half that two guests were seated with menus presented, the server dressed in Adidas cool but helpful in a manner that works far more effectively than the typical nonchalance of many casual Restaurants opened in the past decade.  Dubbed as a \"Korean BBQ\" joint based on Chef Choy's history, though there are graciously no signs of DIY grills aside from those manned by cooks in the spotless kitchen, it was after lengthy perusal of Drinks and menu sections such as \"Bowls,\" \"Pots,\" and \"L.A. Sh*t\" that decisions were made, two small servings of Banchan whetting palates alongside complimentary warm Hawaiian Rolls that are enjoyable on their own but better saved for later when they prove useful for sopping up Sauces.  Opting for one Cocktail, the savory Tequila base with fresh Watermelon and a salted rim right up the lady's alley, it was alongside a colorful Salad that Uni Dynamite Rice was handed over, the former using salt and spice to blend Radish, Chicories and Onion while whole Tongues of Sea Urchin rested atop the later imbuing Grains both fully cooked and a bit crisp with umami.  Going full-fusion for the next two, Roy's Tacos that built an empire seeing a price hike but otherwise delicious with plenty of Marinated Beef that marries well to Salsa and julienne Cabbage, it is hidden directly above these under \"L.A. Sh*t\" that guests will find Slippery Shrimp, the idea of Walnut Prawns, Shrimp Mayo or whatever it is called spun on its ear by all the same textures but fire where sweetness is expected.  Returning to tradition for Pots and Entrees, a Half-Rack of Lamb for $44 not incongruent with other Casino Restaurants and here prepared magnificently rare along with Baby Bok Choy plus complex Chimichurri bright with Cumin and Cilantro, those looking for value would be well-advised to invest similar dollars in a cauldron of Cod, the sharpness of Tamarind countered by Noodles, Herbs and what might by Honey in a portion that could easily be shared by three or four.  Turning sweets over to Park MGM Executive Pastry Chef Angibeau Philippe, his calendar undoubtedly crowded by such a rapidly evolving property, it is nonetheless with French precision that each Dessert is plated, the \"Sundae for Two\" largely for show but not skimping on complexity while the $10 Date Cake and Mango Budino are both showstoppers, the former giving Gordon Ramsay's Sticky Toffee Pudding a serious run for its money while the Pudding matches Best Friend's Cod Pot in terms of being delicious from beginning to end with no two bites alike.  ****1/2:  Attempting to judge every Eatery as an individual product of intent, execution and overall guest experience the only thing keeping Best Friend from a perfect score is that the menu seems to wander, but from someone with minimal interest in Korean Barbecue or Food Trucks everything about this place (so far) works harmoniously and its willingness to put big flavors front-and-center is a huge breath of fresh air for the tourist corridor.",

I guess you would have to be best friends to eat here. It's okay but nothing to write home about. I think after going main stream with a restaurant its losts its touch unlike the food trucks which is alot better,  which happens alot.",

It's bad food that prepared poorly and overpriced.  Granted, I only ordered the Kimchi Fried Rice, but this is a typical Korean dish that is made badly, either by design or in this particular instance, by mistake. In either case, I won't bother to spend money here again.",

Korean chicken wings were a one note flavor of spicy and otherwise tasted spoiled. The dumpling burgers again an American play on Asian dumplings. Trash this recipe immediately and fire the guy who put this on the menu. Koji tacos that attempts to steal Mexican cuisine and does it no favors with dry meat, a soggy tortilla, and disgusting flavor profile from this drenched sickening coleslaw and once again \"faux spicy Korean flavoring.\"  Please let's not discuss the waiters outfits. This restaurant is trying to hard to be edgy, or LA! Green Adidas track suits are a perfect match with tough urban European guys misappropriating slangs and mannerisms to be Urban/Hood.",

I'm sorry organic or not all the kitchen cooks have to do is give it a good rinse and there should be no problem you think but his answer so laid back brushing it off not an answer I want to hear for the most expensive item on there menu just like nothing they took it out of our bill because of his laid back answer we didn't want a replacement plate.. place was cool different but unsure if I shall return not sure what other short cuts they take allowing to be okay",

The restaurant has a fun/unique bar/lobby that is super colorful and just plain interesting.  When the hostess takes you back to the main dining room you are greeted by the great fragrance of Korean bbq.  The servers wear bright jumpsuits.  Then the food, lots of great options between Korean bbq, tacos, and other tasty options.  The complementary bread is fresh baked Hawaiian rolls.  We had the spicy pork bbq (not really spicy, which worked well for us), beef tacos, and carnitas tacos.  The beef tacos were the standout of everything we ate, but it was all good.  On our next visit we will likely focus on bbq and the beef tacos.  We will certainly be back.",

Staff was well informed of the food and ready with recommendations. I'd recommend you go with at least 4 friends as dishes are family style.  Spicy pork was spicy great. Really liked that. Garlic chicken was good. Not mind blowing, just a bit tame flavor wise. Kogi tacos are always bomb.  4 stars cause Banchan not included. What's up with that? Over all the food is good stuff.

Service was okay at beginning, but at the end when they know we were Airline crews and get discounts, the server was not too happy.  I still tipped 18% even though I felt like he thinks that we are from China and we wouldn't tip?  The food was not how I expected. Soup stew is way too thick, and a little too salty, and the Kalbi ribs are too burned. The bread and kimichi fried rice was good, but the taste of the stew and ribs are not good. Of course they aren't cheap because you are in the hotel, and you get the same amount of food at korean restaurant but doubled the price.   More importantly that I knew I left my Tom ford sunglasses there on the table, and it's hard to get through the PARK MGM security. After I spoke to security with nothing found, they told me to check the restaurant, which restaurant stayed that no one has seen anything.    I am local and I have dinning in at so many different restaurant In town and the casino, this is the Worse experience I had recently ever!  For casino standard, food is not good, service was so so, and people with no care!",

It was a wonderful experience both times. The staff is so friendly and fun, the manager really takes care of you. The food is delicious, don't leave without trying the Kimchi Fried Rice. We'll be back!!",

    "text": "So, cool vibe. Food is okay I guess. We got the kimchee side dish (which was not as flavorful as I would expect), kalbi ( pretty good, but wish there were half orders for 2 people), and then the banchan rice ( average and not that flavorful even with the spice sauce). I am somewhat okay with it because I don't tend to eat too salty but it is on the lighter side, which is interesting cause reviews stated that it tens to be salty. Maybe just the soups. The kimchi we got was half full compared to the 2 tables next to us who had the tin bowl completely full. Don't know how they intend to serve it, but if you are sitting next to people who got more than you and you're paying the same then you feel like you got jipped.   The reason why I gave 3 stars is mainly because of our server Korey. At first he seemed nice, but then slowly the service just went to shits. I don't know if he is aware of Korean food, but he might need to learn about it. He did come over 2x very briefly to ask if everything was okay as he was like half body walking away. He tended to larger parties more ( I get it, more tips but still man). However as we finished eating and was trying to get his attention, he was not around. I could see him and was trying to flag him down or get eye contact with him, but nope. I sat there for 13 minutes trying to flag him down to get boxes and the check. Eventually he came by AFTER he tended to the table next to us, who came in after us, finished eating after us, and they were not trying to get his attention. Then someone came and asked if we wanted our food packed. Not sure if Korey asked him to come or he was just passing by and saw us killing time waiting for something to happen. Then Korey brings the check over with the print out of the receipt and places it on the table after our food was all boxed and given to us, whereas the table next to us already paid and left. Anyway, I wanted to charge the food to the room but he ran away so fast I couldn't even tell him. I decided to just fill out the paper as it had asked about room # and what not ( with my own pen and they didn't provide one). Then was about to leave, but I know that usually they need to check ID so I decided to double check with another passing by worker. They told me to wait. We waited. And waited. Then eventually finally someone came (maybe a manager?)  and took my ID with the paper. She didn't say anything and just took it back, not very customer service friendly. Anyway, then finally Korey is the one that brings back my ID and the reciepts stating the charge to the room and to sign tip, and yet again no pen. It really isn't that hard. To be honest it wasn't even THAT busy. I've worked in a restaurant before and this service is just... Not okay. Perhaps retraining is necessary? Or perhaps going with a particular vibe for the restaurant? I don't know, but won't be coming back anytime soon.",

    "text": "One of my good friends from Vegas recommended we eat here during our vacay and I'm so glad she did! When we first arrived, my friends and I were super confused by how small the place was, even though it was perfectly decorated. We thought we had to order at the front, but little did we know there was an entire restaurant in the back. I was in awe at how perfect it was. The LA vibe and Korean food was the ultimate duo I didn't know I needed. The paintings on the wall are super cool and the playlist was perfect. I absolutely loved the waiters and waitresses in tracksuits! The restaurant gives off a chill LA vibe but is pretty upscale. The food is served family style so we ordered Kimchi Fried Rice, Spicy Pork, The Big E from the O.C and Elotes on the cob. We were given complimentary Hawaiian rolls, which were delicious. Everything we ordered was incredible! I love spicy pork and elotes so of course those were amazing. This was my first time trying kimchi fried rice and I'm definitely a fan especially with the egg on top! I love eating kimchi and am disappointed that I barely discovered kimchi fried rice. The Big E from the O.C was tasty, just not my favorite item we ordered. My friend ordered the Watermelon Cocktail which was pretty strong, but still tasted pretty good. The drinks are overpriced in my opinion, but considering it's Vegas and a really cool restaurant, I wasn't surprised. I'll definitely be stopping by on my next trip to Vegas!",

    "text": "Allow me to start this review by saying that I am a fan of Chef Roy Choi.  As a second generation Korean American growing up in Southern California, I immediately fell in love with the flavors of the Kogi truck.  I admire and respect Roy Choi for his contributions to the community and the way that he has been able to introduce Korean food to a broader culinary audience.  With that said, you can only imagine how stoked I was to find out that he was opening a new restaurant on the Vegas strip.  Good Korean food (not just kBBQ) ON the strip is definitely something that has been a long time coming.  So while I wasn't there for the opening night, or even the first week, I made sure that it was one of the first places I visited in the new year.   We made reservations online in advance, assuming that it would be hectic and busy - and I'm glad I did.  As soon as I walked in, the decor reminded me of my parents' old liquor store in LA. There were products on display that reminded me of my childhood and some food items that screamed nostalgia. It felt like home. The staging area also serves as a bar in addition to a souvenir store for some \"Best Friend\" swag.  Upon checking in for our reservation at the counter, the hostess led us through to the main dining area by walking through red colored, cooler door strip curtains.  Bewildered, I just followed.  Upon entering, it feels good. The music is bumpin' - there's such a good energy to this place.  The ambience, the staff, and experience is overall positive.  Then why the 3 stars?   The food.  Again, I want to say that I \"get it.\" I appreciate how Korean food is being elevated to a more refined dining experience. But in honest to good truth, it feels WRONG to pay $39 for soondubu, $42 for Kimchi Jjiggae, and $4 for Kimchi.  I just can't get myself to do it. So my husband and I opted to try dishes that sounded like something that we wouldn't make at home.  - The Big E from the O.C. - What I LOVED about this dish was their ponzu sauce with ikura in it -  I wanted to dip everything in that.  But just know that this dish is basically fried balls of kimchi fried rice.  It was okay. I wish I could taste more of the flavor of the kimchi and rice inside, but it's mostly all breading.   - Uni Dynamite Rice - The yuzu makes it. Sweet, savory, spicy, rich, and with a twist of yuzu.  But overall, the spiciness and the acid from the yuzu overpowered the taste of the uni.  All the flavors I wanted were present - just not very balanced.   - Slippery Shrimp - The chili mayo used for this dish tastes similar to the mayo mixture used in the Uni Dynamite Rice. The whole time I ate this, I was trying to figure out what was missing from the flavor of this dish - I wanted the shrimp to be a bit crispier... I wanted to add some more garlic. I'm not sure what it was missing.  It was just okay.  - Kogi Short Rib Tacos - I can't pass up the Kogi tacos.  It's what started it all and probably the overall favorite of our night.  But just as the Halal Guys will never taste as good in the OC as it does while you're sitting at a bench in New York City, the Kogi taco served on a plate instead of a cardboard tray just isn't the same.   We wanted to try more foods but we were so full.  As my husband and I discussed the meal, he said, \"This food isn't really meant for 'us.' It's to introduce people to the idea of Korean food.\" And I agree.    I'm glad this restaurant is here. I know that it will be successful.  But when it comes to Korean food, my standards are high and my palette is particular.    I remember when Momofuku first appeared at the Cosmopolitan, their ramen was incredibly underwhelming.  However, in my most recent experience there, they had improved the ramen significantly. I am willing to come back and try some other things from the Best Friend menu, but maybe like Momofuku, they just need some time to adjust and fine tune their flavors.",

When you first enter, you enter this hip little environment where you can stop and grab food there. However past the main area, you walk in the back and there is the main area for dinning! The waiter was super friendly and very helpful as he did recommend items to order. All the items are meant to be shared as it is a family dinning environment. All foods are a little bit more of the spicy side!  The atmosphere was very hip and trendy on the inside. All the waiters were wearing Adidas track suits which is fun! Would recommend to come here for the environment, however wasn't thrilled over the food due to the spice and variety.",

    "text": "Korean fusion at its finest.  The facade of the restaurant is super bizarre inside Park MGM, it reminds me of a 90s convenience store.  It had a bar on the right side, and numerous Asian snacks for sale from floor to ceiling on the left. Not really what you'd expect... but as you walk through the red sheeted factory-like \"door\" you're in a modern tasteful dining room.  All the staff are wearing Adidas tracksuits which is amazing!!! Takes me back to elementary school   The menu is hilarious with flashbacks of Roy and his friends in the 90s, and everything is family style and food comes when it's ready like a typical Asian restaurant.  This was reiterated to us several times by our Caucasian waiter, and were like we're Asian we got this . We ended up ordering a bunch of kogi short rib and carnitas tacos and two Chego pork belly bowl.    The kogi short rib tacos were way tastier than the carnitas tacos as the meat was more flavourful and the sauce was really delicious. Not a bad price $15 for 3 tacos, and you can add tacos at $5 each.  The pork belly bowl came and looked so delicious with the fried egg on top... and when mixed together with the egg yolk, sauce, pork belly and rice it was a delicious hot mess.  It's a misleadingly large amount of food and a very generous amount of pork belly, but everything ate well together and the sauce was a good spice level to tingle but make you want to keep going back for more. My one complaint was maybe it was a bit too saucy? But everything is a personal preference   Definitely worth checking out. Great vibe, good eats, and I would consider this a cheap eat on the Vegas strip.",

    "text": "Yup yup! My boy, Roy Choi did it again. He not only topped himself but he did it in Vegas, where there are thousands of gimmicky type places on and off the strip, plus all that fine dining. His restaurant stands out as a premier food destination that does not require one to come dressed to impress. It is laid back as can be. I suggest making reservations. We dropped in on opening weekend and it was packed. Mr. Choi was there as well. I didn't want to bother him but it would have been nice to grab a pic with one of my \"food\" heroes. Now, I know how fans of Ariana Grande feeI.   Start off in the liquor store style front bar. You can dine there as well. Drinks are about $12, beers $10. My wife had the Hennessy and coke slushie. I went with Tiger beer. While we waited for our reservation time we chatted with the busy bartender. He was awesome!   I am familiar with his style of recipes and Latino inspired Korean fusion, but nothing prepared me for the wonderful dishes we had. Our server was wonderful. He stopped by to let us know about the place and we asked to just start bringing the food.   Dish one, order the tacos. They run about $4/each but there is no way you will find something similar to the taste near the strip. From there we had multiple dishes from the cucumbers to the slippery shrimp. We didn't order a main dish because we wanted to try small plates. We still managed to stuff ourselves. We topped it off with date cake and caramel ice cream. Very impressed with the cake. That was my first time for date cake.   Things to know, music might be loud for some inside but not unbearable. Not great for large groups, there was one room I noticed off to the side. I would not say kid friendly but did notice couple small kids.   This is one of my new fave spots in Vegas. Roy Choi did it right. Best of luck in 2019. Congrats on the new place!",

Even the menu was pretty funny as it reminded me of a high school yearbook back in the day. It was so appropriate for my friend who was celebrating his \"ahem\" birthday.   If you are an LA native, one can appreciate the selection of food including inspirations from his various Korean and Mexican fusion foods from Chef Choi's food trucks or stores in LA. I think the food is quite pricey, but I think you are paying more so for the unique ambiance. Our waiter Korey3000 made it quite memorable. He was great in offering suggestions about the food.   The only disappointment was with the charred octopus. It wasn't charred and tasted rather bland. That dish should be removed from the menu.",

    "text": "My family was in town for New Years and we heard they opened a \"BEST FRIEND\" restaurant in Las Vegas at the MGM Park hotel (Formerly known as Monte Carlo). They just recently remodel this area in the hotel so everything is nice and fresh.   I myself have never heard of this restaurant. We made a rsvp on their Instagram page (they had a link). We had a party of 14 but the max you can do on the link was 9 so we spitted our party into 2 groups (9 and 5). Our rsvp was for 8:30pm and showed up around 8pm to have a drink before dinner. The waiting area in this restaurant was GREAT! They have a lot to look at and they had a full bar. We got some drinks and the bartender DAN was amazing! He was very friendly, professional, helpful and over a great guy!   They texted us to let us know our table was ready. They ended up letting both of our party sit together. Our table was located right by the kitchen. Lucky for us Roy Choi (owner/chef) was here and greeted our table. He even took a picture with us. (so nice of him)   The food was so delicious. (look at my pictures to help you order) This is what I recommend.  *Dumplings (Pork, beef, ginger, tofu with a spicy sauce) *Elotes (Corn) *Kalbi (Korean BBQ marinated bone-in short rib) OMG MY FAVE!!! *Fries (Served with a sambal Mayo) *Kimchi Fried Rice (Caramelized kimchi, rice with a poached egg) *Kogi Short Rib Tacos (Korean BBQ, salsa roja, cilantro, onion, lime & chili soy slaw)  *Slippery Shrimp (Crispy rock shrimp, chili mayo and walnuts0 ANOTHER FAVE OF MINE! *Spicy Pork (Thinly sliced bell & shouder, kochujang and sesame)   You even get free Hawaiian bread! Yummy!!!!!   I can say I am now a fan of the food. The environment was great. It's a 80's/90's culture so be ready to step back in time! Good music, staff was friendly, good seating and overall a great place to come for dinner!",

Servers wore Adidas track suits making me wanna start b-boyin.  Breakdown of food: Eggplant: was undercooked, not one of my favorites Tacos: can't go wrong  Bimbap: it's okay, I just remember the egg was cooked correctly and nice chunks of meat. Yeah uni fried rice: it's good Garlic Chicken: yea it's chicken Dessert: Date cake awesome Nothing wowed me besides the design of the restaurant.  Music can be a bit loud in this establishment and not suitable for babies. Also price is a bit high.",

Kind of boring if I'm being honest. Can see this look and hear this music at any number of restaurants in vegas and elsewhere. I was impressed the chef Roy was there cooking and coming out to the tables.  We had several dishes. The garlic chicken was very good. Used chicken thighs and it came out sizzling.  The kogi short rib tacos were good. Not outrageous. We really liked the uni dynamite rice. Just were expecting a bit of a bigger portion. Every table gets some kings Hawaiian roles that are warm and dusted with some sea salt. Again not really impressive.  The saltado was good but there was an over abundance of peppers and onions with a True lacking of protein.  I'd go back but not in a rush.",

Seriously right when you walk in - neon signs telling you what to do. Stickers. Posters. Snacks? Snacks. Merch. Cool merch. Merch that makes you buy a $27 light up coffee mug.   Roy Choi is seriously a very cool dude for bringing something truly fresh to the 702. We get a lot of LA or NYC branch offs but this is truly authentic. From the DJ to the menu typography, it really is suuuuper cool. But come for the decor, stay for the food.   We had a huge party so we ate a ton. Spicy cold noodles, wings, fries, cucumber salad, A-frame ribs, carnitas tacos, short rib tacos, etc. There's way too much to choose. That's how they get you to come back. It's a solid strategy. Everything was delicious and nothing remained. The table was a meaty carnage.   If Korean BBQ scares you, just try something new. Half of our table didn't know what banchan was but we still loved everything. Be adventurous you lil butterfly. Spread your culinary wings.   Our tracksuit-clad server Old Man Hipster (serious nametag read) was very tolerant after our multiple rounds of Hennessy and cola slushees, daiquiris, double coke and rums, and a bottle of Soju. And our loud annoying voices.  Sad because we ordered the eggplant schnitzel and it didn't get delivered to our table. But I'll be back for it. You win Choi.",

With so much hype around Roy Choi opening a restaurant in Vegas, I get it, I should have made a reservation.   Let me start off by saying I Roy Choi's food in Cali. But this restaurant seemed more hype then anything.  Ordered the Kogi tacos. It was just okay. Felt like they were premade and just reheated.  Slippery shrimp was just like any other rock shrimp dish.  Uni dynamite rice, the server said it didn't come with rice, even when it is in the bowl section of the menu and he encouraged us to order a side of rice so we did. When the food came out, it came out on top of rice and we got a side of rice........... the flavor was kind of similar to the slippery shrimp.  Chego pork belly bowl looked really good in the picture but the taste was just decent. It has a mix of the pork belly with a fried egg, radish, peanuts, broccoli, and cojita cheese. Not sure if I liked cojita on it or not.  Our complimentary sweet bread came out after they delivered our 2nd dish.  Overall this place was just decent. Wouldn't go out of my way to go here.",

We walked in around 10 pm after a knights game to check it out. All the food was good.   Nice ambiance of the restaurant. They do have a DJ playing so it is slightly loud but its not where you can't hear your friends to talk.  We got the Garlic chicken - I think was my favorite dish at the time. It was moist and not over cooked at all and had that nice sweet and garlicy taste  Kimchi fried rice - alright, so I liked the rice it was cooked in but the kimchi was a bit too sour. I know when its fermented the right amount of time, it gets sour. I think this time was really sour that it was just hard to get passed.  We also order the elote which I thought was delicious. It was a bit sour also but I think if you mix up the mayo with everything and spread it evenly it is quite delicious.  Watermelon Hibiscus Slushie - I also ordered a drink which I thought tasted exactly like a slushy without alcohol. it was just SO good. Make sure you mix well otherwise you'll get all the alcohol on the bottom.  Not bad, but I feel like we can get the same kinda food off strip that is just as good without the strip prices.",

My reviews are generally based just on a food standpoint cause to me some of the best food can be food in the most grimiest locations.   What we (or I) ordered...  Carnitas Tacos - As expected from the creator of the Kogi truck.....fire  Fries & Sambal Mayo - The seasoning on these fries do well...we werent a fan of the Sambal Mayo though....  Slippery Shrimp - I never look at pictures of the dish prior to me trying it but heard it was a staple dish of this restaurant. Not a fan of small shrimp and the flavor tasted like the Sambal Mayo and dill...was for some reason expecting something similar to the infamous Rock Shrimp.....  Chego Pork Belly Bowl - Love everything Chego...this is FIRE  BBQ Garlic Chicken - Flavor is there and even though I prefer white meat, this dark meat chicken goodness tastes even better as leftovers  Date Cake - The toffee ice cream on this was sooo good and the date cake reminded me of something similar to sweet pancakes. Has a very Mexican inspired feel to it that I can't think of off the top of my head...  If this were just based on a food standpoint this would be a 3.5/5 but knowing how everything is being worked out in the first few weeks of opening (especially in a new market) I would most def try more items when I come back.",

    "text": "I've been wanting to try this restaurant since they opened! However, as a local, I try to avoid the strip at all costs. As it was my best friend's birthday, I decided it was finally time to check this place out. I made a reservation the day before just in case it would be busy.   Upon entering, I couldn't help but look around. It's a bar area that's set up like a convenient store. They also have merchandise for sale. Super cute. The host brought us back past these red vinyl curtains and into the actual dining area. You could just tell that there was a lot of thought put into the restaurant. From the art on the wall, to the servers tracksuit uniforms, to the candles on the table, down to the menus!!! It definitely gave me 90's vibes. Our server Christina* was super sweet & gave good recommendations. You can order from a preset menu or a la carte. We decided to go with the a la carte options.   We ordered the uni fried rice, kalbi, short rib tacos, shrimp, garlic chicken, street corn, and the strawberry cheesecake. Tbh, I was so excited to eat that I forgot to take pics of most of the food :( Sorry. All I can say is that the food came out QUICK and I was satisfied with everything we ordered. Many friends recommended the kimchi fried rice, but we wanted to try the uni because it's unique! My favorites were the uni fried rice, kalbi & the short rib tacos. The flavor was spot on with all these dishes.   We also ordered a couple drinks and OMG, get the Jameson Ginger Slushee. Like, you just have to get it. So good!! They have a 16 oz or 32 oz. They get extra points for using paper straws. My straw was definitely getting soggy in my 32 oz slushee, but I really do appreciate the effort. #SaveTheTurtles.   Overall, I enjoyed my experience at Best Friend. The music was good, food was delicious, and we had excellent service. What more can you really ask for? Yeah it's a bit pricey, but that's to be expected. If you're a local that tries to avoid the strip like me, I suggest visiting on a week day so you can potentially avoid it being overcrowded. However, my server did say that there's a DJ on the weekends. I'd definitely come back for that experience. Don't forget to make a reservation!",

    "text": "I am writing this while feeling completely stuffed.  My husband and I finished our meal at Best Friend satisfied and impressed at all of the flavors.  We had reservations through the MGM site and had no problem checking in.  Reservations were at 6:30 and since we were a little early (6:17), they asked us to wait just a few minutes.  We were able to enjoy the visuals of the \"bodega\" and grab a drink.  Husband ordered a Singaporean beer called Tiger, which he had never had.  I went with their Hennessy and Coke slushie.  Really good.  Our table was ready right on time and we were led into the dining area of the restaurant through translucent red curtains.  Look up when you walk in and you will catch a quick glimpse of the LA sky, complete with a helicopter flying by.  This is Korean-style ordering with Roy Choi's famous flair.  The menu is handed to you in a yellow 1-inch binder and with all items in large print.  Fun fact - color copies of original photos from the 90s representing the chef's roots.  It's split into several sections based on plate size with items ranging from $3 to well above $100.  There is something for every taste and palate.   My faves: bean sprout and cucumber bichon, Kogi tacos, dumplings, and the elote!    Every flavor was distinct and delicious.  They have larger plates, but we just couldn't do it.    Ambiance was chill.  Servers wore Adidas track suits, there was greenery hanging from the ceiling, LA city views adorned the walls, and a painted nopal made me feel at home.  Roy Choi himself was on site scoping everything out, probably making sure it was just right.  Definitely a must-do if you are in Vegas and love food!",

The food is overpriced for what you get and doesnt really taste all that great.  Ordered from fried wings and the chicken had a dirty ass taste to it.  The uni rice had way too much yuzu in it and it overpowered the entire thing.   Tried several other dishes but they werent memorable.  Hard pass here.",

Where was the yuzu? the sesame? That sauce just masked every other flavor that was in that rice bowl.   We also got the spicy chili cheese spaghetti. It was limp spaghetti with meat sauce from taco bell.   The best thing of the night was the free Hawaiian kings bread that came before the meal. That deserves the one extra star.   I should have stuck to the tried and True bugolgi taco/burrito.   I wanted to love it. But best friends we are not.",

As soon as you walk in, you get the LA vibes that Roy is so proud of and loves so much and then you are ushered into the dining area that encapsulates that vibe even more. A DJ that spins music that epitomizes LA gets you warmed up for the deliciousness that ensues. The menu is short, sweet and to the point.  It is all of Roy's creation that is the literal melting pot of dishes he is known for. If you've ever read his book and cooked some of his recipes, you know how excited I was to try this. I got the Chego pork belly bowl and this it, Chief. You have the flavors here. Sour, tangy, spicy and sweet and hearty.  I washed it down with the peach soju and some coronas and I couldn't be more happier. 10/10 would recommend for an amazing dining experience",

Shout-out to the amazing and hilarious server Scott for making it happen... the fact that Chef himself was at his restaurant speaks volumes for how much he cares and makes sure he is serving delicious and quality food.

    "text": "Best Friend by Roy Choi is a fun and funky restaurant in the Park MGM. (Unlike a number of the other restaurants in the Park MGM - such as Eataly, which you can see from the outside of the hotel - Best Friend is inside the hotel casino so it can be a little tricky to find).  I went with a friend and we both ordered the LA Love Story prefix. (The restaurant offers two prefixes, the LA Love Story and the KBBQ. I asked if I could order one prefix and my friend could order the other but our waitress would not let us.) Both prefixes offer A LOT of food so only order the prefixes if you are EXTREMELY hungry (or if you want to take home a lot of leftovers).   LA Love Story Prefix: (1) Elotes - 3/5 - The elote was decent but nothing special. (2) Kogi Taco - 4/5 -  The kogi taco fantastic, I thought this was a great fusion of Korean and Mexican cuisine. (3) Carnitas Taco - 3.5/5 - The canitas taco was good but nothing special. (4) Slippery Shrimp -  4/5 - The shrimp was crispy and juicy and the sauce was delicious. (5) Chego Belly Bowl - 4/5 - I really enjoyed the pork belly in the bowl. (But at this point in the meal I was pretty full and did not try anything else in the bowl.) (6) A-Frame O.G. Ribs - 2/5 - I was fairly disappointed by the ribs. I may be a little bit of a snob when it comes to BBQ (having lived in St. Louis where there are a lot of fantastic BBQ joints) but I thought the meat in the ribs was a little dry and the sauce wasn't great. (7) Medjool Date Cake - 5/5 - PHENOMENAL CAKE and the best thing about the meal. The cake was warm and gooey and the ice cream on the side was the perfect addition.  Overall, I enjoyed my meal and had a great dining experience. With the number of great restaurants in Vegas, I'm not sure I would go back. (The only reason I would is for that Medjool Date Cake, so be sure to save room for dessert and order that if you go.)",

From the design of the old school bright yellow advertisements littered throughout Vegas, to the Asian grocery storefront facade, the smell of familiar food when you walk in, and complex taste of the fusion style food. Yum.   Before we get to the food, I'm going to list a few of the things I appreciated. Right outside the restaurant there are Best Friend slot machines. Unfortunately, we did not win money from it, but that was cool. The fake storefront reminded me of the Asian grocer on Sunset street next to Jack's parent's home in Echo Park. The posters from the 90's. Going through red plastic blinds? Idk what you call these things, but they further reinforce the grocery feel. The menu is a binder filled with pictures that looked like pictures I have from home. The hanging plants. The servers in green adidas track suits. Jurassic 5, Fabolous, and Chromeo playing - track list was catered to the souls that grew up in the 90's. Everything about Best Friend made it feel so personal, like Roy Choi trying to express where he came from. Even the wall painted with Kogi trucks. Damn, I remember when they first came out and standing in line for hours just for a bulgogi burrito.   Food was freaking delicious. It was like that feeling when I first had a Kogi taco at the parking lot of some rando warehouse, but now I'm older and my tastebuds have matured, and I'm sitting in some fancy dining establishment still being blown away by this food.  So we ordered the kimchi fried rice arancini, eggplant schnitzel, uni rice, spicy pork, and bingsu. The kimchi fried rice arancini was my fav, the yuzu in the uni rice made the uni taste yum, you can never go wrong with the spicy pork. Our waiter was knowledgeable of the menu, so if you have questions, feel free to ask them.  I'd come back again fsho. Make reservations!",

So I felt like I was kind of getting gypped pricewise. I understand it is in Vegas and things are priced a little bit more. Also Roy Choi is also all about making Asian food not feeling like it's cheap. Which I commend him for. A lot of people think Asian Food is supposed to be cheap. It is actually high-quality food. So good for him on that part. Food was very tasty though. The Uni Rice was very good. I've got the high end the fridge. Also very good. Just portion sizes were very small. Other than that as far as taste everything was very good. Had no complaints on flavor. Just portion sizes.",

The front of the restaurant has the theme of a 90s throw back in a bar with neon lights.   It's a cool place to hang out while you have drinks and food at a bar.  You also have the option for a full service dine in experience located in the back.  The full food menu is made for Asian/Mexican fusion and also family style for sharing.   All the dishes were good but I felt the portions was a little small to share as family- style.  I was a bit disappointed on the outrageous prices.  But I guess that's the premium you have to pay these days when you're eating at Vegas.  So a plate of 3 taco was $12.50.  It was a good size taco.  But seriously not worth $4 a taco.  An order of slippery shrimp was $16 for not more than 10 small pieces.   Note that the restaurant closes at 10 pm.",

Now for an expanded review: When you enter the restaurant the receiving area looks like an old school bodega, you can buy goodies or drinks while you wait for your table or reservation. Entering the restaurant feels like going to a back door then you'll see all the open space and the nice LA lay-back decoration with plants hanging from the ceiling.  The Food, recommendation, try to go with a group, plates are very sharable and you'll able to try more that way. If you are unsure just order a bunch and talk with the servers they'll help you with portion sizes and will let you know if you need to order more or less.   Order: Hawaiian buns - (Free) - Now, you probably have tried these and thought, there is no way to make this better, just wait and try these...  Eggplant Schnitzel - A really weird combination of flavors that just work, great for the adventurous type Dumplings - They're good, but nothing out of the ordinary Kimchi Fried Rice - Amazing, spicy but with lots of flavors, great for mixing with meats Spicy Pork - A MUST - This is great, it's like a perfect blend between meat/bacon, season spectacularly (This alone is worth the visit) Slippery Shrimp - This is very spicy, more than I'm used to but really good. Cucumber Drink - Really good and works really well with spicy food, probably can do ten of these Bingsu (Dessert) - Sorry that the picture is not great, my mouth was burning so started eating as soon as arrived, it's raspberry sorbet with shaved coconut ice, dragon-fruit and like a foam, very very good, perfect for cooling down.  Service was amazing, sorry that I don't remember the waiter name but he was incredible. This is great food at a great price with amazing service, will become a stable of my places to eat when in Vegas.",

    "text": "The new Nevada outpost of this popular LA eatery did not let us down, and chef Choi was in the house in the flesh. It should be noted that at 8:30 on this Saturday night in mid-June the music was playing so ridiculously loudly that any sort of conversation (even with someone seated at your table directly next to you) was a definite struggle. The cocktails are a nice collection of creative takes on classics and a few new concoctions--very tasty. Our tastebuds first touched food here when the fresh rolls were set down, and they were deliciously warm, buttery, and yeasty with a pinch of salt on top. It looked like every table around us ordered the beef tacos, as did we. Good Lord they are out of this world fantastic! We also had the slippery rock shrimp--easily the best version of the dish I've ever tasted, probably because the sauce was the spiciest I've ever had on rock shrimp. (I want more...right now!) Chili pasta is dish that was quite good (seasoned ground meat over tornado noodles) but lacked a little of the pizzazz that most of the other items radiate. I will go back anytime for another experience (when is the music not deafening?).",

When you go to the back there's a dj and lots of tables. As for food I recommend the kimchi fried rice and the salad. We also got the short ribs but none of us were very big fans. For the price of the ribs I wouldn't say it's worth it, especially if your expectations are for tender Korean Kalbi. One down side was it was FREEZING in there! Bring a jacket just in case.",

    "text": "Best Friend by Roy Choi is a great restaurant in the Park MGM. It's tucked away and from the entrance looks a bar styled in industrial fashion.  But once you go beyond the two sets of industrial plastic strip curtains the restaurant transforms into lush and spacious area. There is a ton of art work and plants that bring a unique personality to the restaurant.  Our party of 10 had a reservation and we were graciously accommodated with a private room. There was plenty of space and even a fancy mirror that can take pictures of the group.  The staff was amazing and did a great job of serving our large party.  Our group was adventurous and all agreed to $55 a head for the chef to put together a tasting menu. We had some dietary restrictions (vegan, vegetarian, no pork and they delivered!).  We got A LOT of dishes. I don't remember them all but here are some of my favorites.  Dry Aged Steak - Delivered with the rib bone of the cow (about 2 ft long). Delicious and distinct dry age flavor. 5 stars  Grilled Whole Fish - Ours was a fresh sea bass. Great flavor. 4 stars  BBQ Shrimp (prawns) - Wow, these were huge prawns packed with flavor. 5 stars  Korean Wings - Very good flavor. Not quite the traditional double fried wing I was expecting.  Ban Chan - Was decent 3 stars  Kimchi Fried Rice - Overall great with the poached egg. I always wish the egg was more runny but with hot rice, it's gonna cook :) 4 Stars.  Best Friend by Roy Choi was great food experience! Ours was quite special given our large party. So my recommendation is to come with a lot of people and take advantage of all the dishes you can get family style.",

Yes it delivers with Kogi Tacos -$15 for $3, Short Ribs, the wings - wow. There was no one around us that was not enjoying all of the menu. The slushy drinks were also good. You want to pace yourself when ordering, as the food is so good - you can over order. The food comes out quick. Have a late nite menu as well. Yes - the prices are higher than the LA locations.

The food presentation was similar to the food you would get at any good Korean restaurant. As a modern 'hip' restaurant they played a lot of loud EDM, which I didn't mind much but it did make it pretty hard to have a conversation. The food came out VERY quickly, which was a good and bad thing. As for the food itself, The kimchee fried rice is a bit spicy for me but my Korean boyfriend loved it. Everything else we ordered was delicious but nothing really stood out. The only reason I'm giving this place 4 stars is because of how expensive it was for street style foods.",

Loved the entrance and decor of the restaurant when we first walked in and enjoyed that behind the register/host stand were tons of old school goodies I remember eating as a kid. Upon going into the actual restaurant I too loved the decor and set up. The wait staff wore Adida replica jumpsuits which was pretty cool. I liked that the menus looked like high school binder. Came complete with the tabs that we used to separate our classes and even included old school photo's of the chef and his friends from back in the day. We all ordered drinks and the server was nice and helped us with the menu and even suggested some tips to cut costs. We all almost ordered the same thing but I ended up switching mine up so we didn't all have the same food on the table.  The were out of the elote which was very disappointing but it was okay. Everything we ordered ended up being worth not having it. The Hawaiian rolls they give were delicious wish they kept them coming as a complimentary item. For the price you pay they could afford to do so.  Overall, ambiance was great, service was nice and food was pretty flavor.  Would like to come back and try other menu items but it would definitely be around tax season again! Haha J/K",

For cocktail I ordered the watermelon - so refreshing and delicious but too much ice, I feel like I drank it in 2 minutes. I ordered the short rib tacos - bomb! The tortillas were perfect and the meat super tender, elotes were my side - they were good, I tried my boyfriends ribs and they were awesome as well, he thought they were too spicy tho so he didn't finished them, the rest of my table got the carnitas tacos and fried rice kimchi - they enjoyed their food and drinks very much.  Solid 4 stars, I will definitely go back and order some more!",

There's a Korean supermarket with a counter bar at the front, before passing through red refrigerator curtains into a darker dining area with an open kitchen.  There's an area for a DJ, modern art along the walls and hanging plants from the ceiling.  Definitely want to go back and try the rest of the menu.",

    "text": "Roy Choi does it again.   I should probably preface this review by acknowledging the simple fact that I have been a card-carrying True blue Roy Choi fanboy since the first time I tried his Kimchi Quesadilla over ten years ago after chasing down the Orange County Kogi Truck. Since then I have visited every single one of his restaurants and with the exception of LoCoL, have adored every morsel he has brought forward. Simply put, he is my most beloved Chef on earth.   Best Friend is another concept right out of the Choi playbook that has successfully married Asian and Latin flavors for over a decade now. The restaurant sports a bodega-style liquor store in front, complete with a counter for ordering swift take-out orders and other wares for sale. Patrons are then ushered into the main dining room to find some of his most notable dishes from Los Angeles, observed on an \"LA section\" of the menu, as well as newcomers such as large-format, sharable plates meant just for the glitzy Las Vegas scene.   The item list reads like a love letter from Los Angeles to Las Vegas and highlights what we have come to expect: From the thinly-sliced Pork Belly with a spicy Gochujang Sauce to an iteration of the Slippery Shrimp with Walnuts and Spicy Aioli you always cherished back home at Yang Chow. I found items from each of his major locations in California (A-Frame, Commissary, Chego, POT, and of course, the OG Kogi BBQ Taco Truck -- you know, the one that started it all).  Suddenly, you notice some newcomers. A Tomahawk Steak with Salsa Verde? Kimchi Jjiggae? A Tamarind Hot Pot that can feed four and Chili Spaghetti? Wait... Caviar Tostadas? What the hell is going on here? It will be around this time that your server donning an Addidas tracksuit fit for MC Run or DMC explains that they have constructed a custom dry aging room just for Kimchi. Yes. Just for the Kimchi.   Genius.   Even the beverage program has swagger. Each Sinatra-era and 1980's Cocktail brings something really nice, something really proper, and -- most importantly -- something really funky to your table.   All of this is in a pleasant, carefree environment highlighting the best music from the golden age of Hip Hop spun by an in-house DJ and there even a nightclub located next door. My only question for Mr. Choi is why this is not in Los Angeles or Orange County; where it belongs.   Best new restaurant in Las Vegas?   No.   Best new restaurant period.",

    "text": "Wow, there was a lot of hype about this place online.  So, when it came time to choose a place for a birthday meal we decided to try this place.  We made a reservation in advance (highly recommended).   The reception area has a unique and very cool design like a Korean grocery store with shelves full of cool and sometimes cute items.  When we approached the receptionist, there was zero eye contact whatsoever.  She didn't even look up.  She checked us in without looking at us at all.   I don't know if they're going for a pretentious, snobby sort of vibe.  If so, they were right on the money.  The table was ready fairly quickly.  The inside is small and loud with constant booming Korean rap music.  It would've been nice if they lightened it up now and then with maybe some K-pop.  The waitstaff are all wearing colored track suits (a fun touch).  The menu was reasonably sized though divided strangely into odd categories.  One thing that stood out immediately was a $4 charge for Banchan (Korean side dishes).  That is almost sacrilege at a Korean restaurant, since it is a tradition that these sides are included (and replenished as needed) with the meal.  This seemed like a naked attempt at increasing profits.    We ordered quite a large variety of dishes.  Everything except the Sundubu was pretty good.  The Sundubu was odd to say the least and had almost no tofu in it.  When we pointed this out to the server he explained that they use only very small pieces of tofu in it.  He didn't offer to bring more tofu or anything.  Oh well.  It also had a chocolatey taste - possibly since the restaurant apparently tries to do Korean-Mexican fusion.  The garlic chicken was my favorite.  I am not usually a fan of chicken thighs, but these were pretty good.  The Kalbi was decent though tougher than what we have had at much less expensive Korean BBQ places off strip.  They served dinner rolls with the meal (unique) which appeared be like King's Hawaiian rolls with salt on top.  Not bad.  Overall all the food was quite salty, and the server agreed saying, \"Yeah, everything here is pretty salty.\"  They were kind enough to bring a slice of birthday cake with the meal, and we ordered some other desserts as well (eg mango pudding) which were not bad (though not spectacular).  Soft drinks and frozen drinks were served in what looked like red plastic cups, but they were actually a fairly high quality cup made to look like a cheap cup.  A fun touch.   Overall, this place turned out to be much more hype than quality.  And there are honestly much better Korean restaurants off-strip.  If you are stuck on the strip, though, this is just about the only choice for Korean BBQ or Korean food in general (slash Mexican fusion?). But there are far better choices just a short Uber ride away.",

    "text": "Walking from the restaurant lobby to the dining area was like being transported from from Las Vegas to a backyard in Los Angeles. This whole restaurant feels like an ode to LA.  If you haven't seen the Netflix show Chef, you need to see it now. I've been a fan of Chef Choi since the first time I ate at the Kogi truck close to 10 years ago. The show, however, has given me an even bigger appreciation for his work. In fact if you consider yourself a foodie you must stop what you are doing and go watch Chef the Show and Ugly Delicious.   Now back to Best Friend. The Hawaiian bread they bring out is so buttery and sweet. The Kogi tacos reminded me of why I would stand in eternal lines to eat at the Kogi Truck. The spicy pork is so flavorful and the onions soak up all the juices, finger licking good! The Kalbi ribs were perfectly marinated and cooked to a heavenly delicious goodness. The one complaint is that the cast iron plate wasn't hot enough to cook up the onions to a caramelized yumminess. It's too much raw onion.  The watermelon drink, tequila infused with sesame seed and fresh watermelon juice is all I ever want to drink.",

    "text": "Ahh my reason for tricking my own bestfriend to coming to Vegas for her bday lol. I needed to try this place as soon as I heard it was opening! I swear I made reservations as soon as I could and I'm over the moon that my expectations were exceeded with my experience at Best Friend.   First off, I dined alone because my bestfriend and I flew in at different times. No worries, the upbeat, friendly attitudes of the waiters/waitresses and entire ambiance of the restaurant made it super comfortable to relax, chill and bob my head to the impeccable hip hop playlist that was on until my food came.   Trust me I wanted to order everything off the dinner menu. However, I knew we'd be going out later in the night and didn't want to be overly stuffed and sleepy. Heres what I tried:  Complimentary house Hawaiian buns sprinkled with sea salt were an awesome way to start.   Short Rib Kogi Tacos (5 STARS, DUH) - as my waiter said \"you don't build an empire off a taco that's not amazing!\" He was so right. The best taco I've ever had. I ate all three. Everything about this was perfect. I had mine with a little kimchi on top and was in heaven.   Broccoli ban chan/Kimchi ban chan (5 stars) - love love love. Ban chan is a must order here guys, these were so good. Best kimchi, best broccoli ban chan I've ever had.   Slippery shrimp (4.5 stars) - I love the sambal flavor and spice used on these and the quality of the shrimp couldn't be better. Honestly I have to say this was better than the rock shrimp at Nobu. Very heavy for one person to eat a whole order of tho I know I left a good amount behind. Bring friends for this dish.   Watermelon cocktail (5 stars) - I wish I could make this at home. It was by far my favorite cocktail of the trip and I know it's early, but probably will be my favorite cocktail of 2019. Loved the spicy/salty rim and the not-too-sweet flavor.   I will be back here as soon as we're back in Vegas which is probably not long. I can't help myself I love Vegas foodcations and Best Friend just made my \"Must Eat At\" list.",

Spice was just over powering every single dish we ate or tried.  Yes, I know Korean food CAN be spicy, but I like a little kick where I can still taste the food I'm eating. I couldn't get pass dishes that were drenched in the spicy sauce and that's all you taste, is the spicy sauce.  We ordered :  *Slippery Shrimp - deep fried rock shrimp in spicy mayo sauce. *Kalbi - marinated short rib. Don't agree that it's worth $28 for the 5-7 pieces you get. *Chego Pork Belly Bowl - found maybe 3-4 pieces of pork belly in my bowl, everything was drenched in the spicy sauce. Not my favorite.  The sweet, warm Hawaiian buns the give you for the table is phenomenal! I could have a whole bag of those!!   Again, just wasn't for me because of how spicy or drenched in spicy almost everything was!",

    "text": "Probably my favorite spot I've eaten while visiting Las Vegas. Checked this spot out because of the hype and Timothy DeLaGhetto. Your expectations are definitely met when you first arrive! There's truth in the hype, trust me.   I highly recommend the TACOS and KALBI. Trust me, it's a must have when ordering food. Roy Choi has a famous taco truck, so you'd definitely be missing out if you don't get them. As for the kalbi, it was probably the best quality meat while being cooked to juicy tender perfection.   Also, don't skip out on ordering the kimchi, it's a must have with any BBQ option you end up getting. Overall the food here is amazing and I'm already looking forward to the next time I'll be able to go.   I'd definitely put this restaurant at the top of your list when you come to visit Las Vegas.",

As far as the food, the complimentary bun - not going to lie it was delicious and wanted more; the spicy pork was pretty flavorful; garlic chicken - it was okay, nothing to special about it; Korean wings - it was good and basically fell off the bone; and the Los Vegas Salad - it was okay; Fruity pebble Rice Krispie treat...loved, simple but soo good.   You can't forget about the Jaymo & Ginger Slushie, this adult beverage is a must have.",

    "text": "This review was going to detail a wonderful experience describing delicious plates and a fun, hip atmosphere. However, because of a mindless server, this review will only cover her failings. I'd love to have reviewed the food but when the experience is this bad, it ruins the meal.   TLDR: Food was good. Server didn't listen.  Rarely do I rant about the service of an establishment. Even if it's a worst case scenario, I'll sit through a meal to the end and give them chances to redeem any faults. But in this case, it felt like it was one thing after another. Hopefully the faults can be corrected and next time friends are in town, I may them back to this restaurant on the world famous Las Vegas Strip.   Side note: I'm a fan of Roy Choi's L.A. eateries and since the announcement of this Vegas spot several months or even a year ago, I was looking forward to this night for a long time.   First of all (not at the server's fault), the dining room was empty at the 5pm opening. Yet, we were seated in the farthest corner of the room, next to the restrooms and kitchen (see photo). \"Okay....\", I tell myself, but whatever.  Server Stacey arrives at our tiny table for two and takes our drink order and first plates: two boozy slushies ($18 each at 16 oz.), Los Vegas Salad ($13), Elotes ($10) and Dumplings ($12). I clarify to Stacey that this is already a bunch of food from the \"Must-Haves\" (appetizers) menu and we'll order more later. She nods and leaves to put in the order.   Minutes later, before the appetizers arrive, she returns to take our other orders, and now I'm confused. I thought we were going to order more later? Stacey stated the dishes will be timed out and will come out steadily; they just want the orders in. \"Weird...\", I thought to myself but she seemed confident so we went with it and ordered BBQ Kalbi ($28) and Chego Pork Belly Bowl ($18). Before ordering the bowl though, I needed to clarify if the red font on the menu meant it was spicy (see photo), otherwise it would be no problem to order something else. Confidently Stacey says, \"not spicy\".   Before the salad and dumplings arrive, complimentary Hawaiian sweet bread arrives to our table. Everything's tasting great but just as I presumed, plates are eating up the table space: two glasses of water, the pitcher, two slushies, two sharing plates, a salad plate, a bread skillet, and dumplings take up every inch of the table. A ton of food, but I can still enjoy it.   Then the Elotes, two corn cobbs, arrive and now my anxiety is rising because there's no place for it, but I manage by dropping it onto my sharing plate. No big deal but now we have to eat fast so we can clear space for the next dish. At that moment, the Kalbi arrives. What the f---! The dumplings haven't been touched and is probably getting cold. I'm utterly annoyed at this point. To my friend I say, \"That last bowl better not arrive.\"  Well guess what, seconds later, the final bowl arrives and the dude is just standing there holding it. Where should we put it, on my lap? We end up having to mix food onto other dishes just to clear the plates - bread sitting on my salad and kalbi flavors mixing with dumpling dipping sauce while clearing plates to the empty table next to us... exactly how I imagine Roy Choi intended his flavors to be served.   So remember this pork bowl that Stacey said is not spicy? I took one bite and it was FIRE. I immediately begin to sweat and so does my friend. The second bite was a hard pass. To Stacey I say that it is spicy, and she responds with a big smile saying, \"Well, it's the good kind of spicy, right?\"  We paid the bill in full, bit my tongue and didn't say anything about the service to the staff on the way out. What I did leave with, was a full stomach and an intention to not return for a long time. Sorry Roy.",

    "text": "Oh hey Roy Choi, I see you in Vegas. We naively showed up to Best Friend thinking it would be easy to get a table. Reservations for tables were fully booked, but we lucked out by being able to find 4 seats at the bar. This turned out to be a blessing for us as we had the most chill server, who entertained us the whole night (wish I caught his name)!  It says a lot about a restaurant when the decor is thought out and has the intricacy you'll find at Best Friend. The hanging planters, the wall art, the discreet entrance all elevated my experience here.   The menu, though it comes in a binder reminiscent of grade school, is not that extensive. Being established Kogi truck fans, there were a lot of items we've tried already which narrowed our decision making more. First we dug into some complimentary Hawaiian rolls. When you're trying to keep things low carb, but Hawaiian rolls are staring at you, you don't say no. My husband and I shared the kimchi fried rice bowl and the spicy pork BBQ plate. The marinade on the spicy pork had the familiar flavors from Kogi truck that I love. Our kimchi fried rice complimented the BBQ nicely.   At the price point, I'm happy I can find a Kogi truck locally to find equally delicious food. However, it's also good to know there's an establishment with extraordinary service, bomb food, and a unique ambiance tucked in the corner of Park MGM. Roy Choi fans should be proud of this one.",

The back part of the restaurant is equally nice.  I love all the plants and the artwork.  I love the menu with all the old pictures of Roy Choi and his family and friends.  We sat at the bar area and the bartenders were great.  Everything on the menu sounds delicious and I wanna order all of it.  Settled for a salad and the grilled whole fish.  It was delicious.  The fish comes as a whole fish with the head and bones.  But it's very flaky and tender.  The bartender helped us get all the fish off the bones.  The sauce that it's in is very simple yet it gave it so much flavor.  The drinks were on point, service is great, the food is tasty.  It feels like LA in Las Vegas.  I will definitely be back.",

LA is Koreatown, Mexican food, fusions and innovative cuisine and I'm so happy that a restaurant of this caliber is on Las Vegas Blvd.   The restaurant is a cool experience. The entrance to this restaurant looks like a Korean store you'd see in an LA strip mall. The inside is designed to look just like the Commissary, Roy's old restaurant.   The cocktails are delicious, innovative and a must get. They are all themed, and every drink you get comes in a complimentary container.   The food - delicious! There's a reason why Roy is such a bad ass chef. I ordered the home made kimchi and it's delicious. It's light in flavor and the sesame seeds add a nice taste. I got the pork bbq with a side of rice. The bbq flavor is delicious. Since it's pork belly it's not as overwhelming or super greasy. The portion is good for one but easily can be shared.   Overall this is such a cool place to eat and check out. It's a total must. I love Roy Choi and have been following him since he started Koji (they have the koji tacos on the menu too!!!!). I think this new restaurant is setting the wave for the rebranding of Las Vegas.",

    "text": "One of the perks of staying at Park MGM was Best Friend! Such a great addition to the revamped casino/hotel. At first, I just walked through the front, eyeing the goods and taking in the \"liquor store\" feels. But on a whim we decided to go and there were only reservations available at 5 PM (opening time) so we took it!  Upon entering, we went through the red butcher plastic and arrived in this majestic setting. Loved all of it, the graphics on the wall, open kitchen, long bar. We sat in the swivel seats, which were comfy, but being short, I felt really low compared to the table.  Absolutely loved our service from beginning to end by Geremew, one of the best waiters I've ever had. He gave us such a great experience and one of the highlights to our meal! The first thing I asked him was if Chef Roy Choi was in the restaurant, and he said he had not seen him so probably not.Darn! For the 3 of us who weren't super hungry, we ordered the chego pork belly bowl, kogi short rib tacos, and the big E from the OC. We also ordered two slushies and I had the watermelon \"cool AF\" drink.  We were quickly served water and complimentary hawaiian rolls. The salt on the hawaiian rolls were genius! The drinks came out so quick, and my friends really enjoyed their slushies. I tried it and it was tasty. My watermelon drink was so good too, wish it was a little bit stiffer. However, $18 for a drink is a bit absurd, but it is Vegas!  The chego rice bowl came out first and it was sooooooooooooo good! So many textures and flavors, all went together perfectly. That was my favorite of the three. The kalbi tacos were good at first bite, but I felt the sauce was a bit overwhelming to me. The Big E from the OC was tasty too, but as much as I love ikura, it was a bit overpowering over the kimchi rice aranci balls for me.  As we were wrapping up our meal, low and behold, Chef Roy Choi to the right of me! Geremew surprised us by sending him to our table! I was so star struck, and uttered, you're not supposed to be here! Total fan girled, and was the highlight of our night! Thank you Geremew and Chef Roy Choi for making our night!  My friends said this was the best out of our 5 meals we had in Vegas, so glad they enjoyed it as much as me! Really fun wall to take a photo of, and cool items to purchase in the store too! Highly recommend for a fun experience!",

I went during Restaurant Week and got to taste a lot for only $50! Was soooo stuffed.. and let me tell you my service from Christina was incredible. She was really attentive while being likeable/relatable.  LOVE LOVE LOVED... - the feel and decor and music.. the VIBE (Maybe because I'm Korean, maybe because we had a market, maybe because I love hip hop, this place really has that chill home feel. Even the servers are wearing track suits. There's no pretentiousness here.) - the bread rolls (OMG. like homemade hawaiian rolls but softer/fluffier and brushed with butter and a sprinkle of salt.) - the kimchi fried rice (You cannot NOT get this if you go!) - spicy pork (flavor spot on, not too spicy) - medjool date cake (at first I was bummed because I might've thought I'd want something less weird sounding but this was the dessert on their Restaurant Week menu... AH-MAZ-ZING.. I was so full but still felt I had to devour EVERY LAST MORSEL)  LIKED QUITE A BIT - mixed tempura (very yummy but you can get good tempura at a lot of places so it wasn't a super standout) - garlic chicken (loved the BBQ char but some parts honestly a little dry/burnt/overdone.. and maybe wanted more punch in flavor.. like let it marinade a day longer?) - slippery shrimp (super yummy but tasted more japanese like the spicy mayo on a dynamite roll.. so it was a little off in terms of harmony with the \"Korean\" meal.. but I realize maybe this is because I'm maybe a purist who doesn't understand \"fusion\" well..?) - kogi short rib tacos (super yummy meat but just a tiny off for ME with the corn tortilla)  MISSED THE MARK - banchan (liked the amount of variety.. but they weren't amazing.. I felt they were underseasoned, especially the broccolini)",

We had the short rib, uni dynamite, picked daikon, kogi tacos. Everything was pretty on point and the portions were a good size so I felt like we got our money's worth. The short ribs were amazing quality meat, cut pretty thick as well. The uni dynamite was yummy but a little too spicy for my liking. A couple next to us did one of the family style meals and it looked so good but soo much food! I really liked this place because after doing a ton of Vegas restaurants this felt a little closer to home. I would want to go with a big group and do the family style meals. At least stop in for the amazing interior!",

Yes, I went to high school in the 1990's. But instead of the cringeworthy moments that I want to forget, it was nothing but the greatest hits from Roy Choi.   Even if you dine in the front bar area, you're in for a treat. Slushy boozy beverages, reminiscent of a snow + peach Schnapps drink my high school gal pals and I concocted, are available on demand. Fried bologna sammies? Hell yeah! And look at all the Roy Choi/Best Friend neon merch... so much merch.   Venture further into the space, past the plastic curtains, into the dining room. Live DJ or hip hop blaring, like a really good h.s. house party. Only we're adults and the cops aren't going to bust this shiz. Must order the tacos, uni rice, cucumbers, and carrots. And duh... of course I'm drinking some white wine like a classy ass grown up.  Such a fun dinner and unique ambiance. Though I didn't get my yearbook signed or a commemorative t-shirt, Roy Choi is definitely one of my new best friends.",

Thanks Roy Choi for this other great food spot. Just be warned.... The food aint cheap here. You got to pay to play. Go in the afternoon if you want a bigger menu. At night the menu is a lot smaller. But great food and really cool staff here. Our server was awesome. Check out pics of food and other stuff on my ig @socal.experience. if you want to see how to do vegas.",

But if you can't snag a reservation, the bar serves the full menu too! The drinks were strong and tasty and the food was drool worthy. The slippery shrimp and kimchi fried rice were definitely highlights of our meal. The shrimp had an amazing spicy kick to it! I love that you could tell they used a wok to fry the kimchi fried rice too! Something about those extra crispy rice pieces in the fried rice just made you want more and more. If you're in Vegas def check out this new hot spot!! You won't regret it. Oh and the dj spinning the music was soo good! Everything from 90's hip hop/rnb to current jams! The dj alone made me want to stay longer!",

The Kogi Korean Short Rib Tacos were a delicious start to our evening and a must try for me  - I'm sure they're even better on the original Kogi truck! I appreciate the work and effort put into this place by Chef Roy and his whole crew. That being said, I did mark it down one star due to our service. There were multiple order mix ups and we felt like we were being over charged in sneaky ways. Our server corrected everything when we addressed it, but had we not looked for it, we would've walked out paying $20+ what we were supposed to. The service wouldn't stop me from coming to Best Friend again, we will absolutely be back. Just a minder to watch your tab and speak loudly to your server so he/she/they can hear you over the music (in-house DJ = high noise level!).  Thanks Chef Roy and crew for a delicious dinner!",

The casual signage and entrance doesn't make the restaurant look like much, but Roy Choi really created something special with this place. And to stand out in Vegas really says something. Our reservation was honored on time and the manager even came to greet us once seated. We took the waitresses recommendation and shared what felt like a ton of delicious food, but ended up being the perfect amount for our party of 8. Even for the picky eaters, the food was upscale yet simple enough to satisfy all. For example, the garlic chicken entree was served on a skillet over onions, yet itself wasn't spicy or too seasoned. It really felt like the BEST Chinese chicken I've ever eaten. I also have to rave about the street corn. Going back, I would just eat this as a meal (everyday if I could)! They take it off the cob which my teeth appreciated and was just perfection. For drinks we got an array from wine to the frozen Jameson and ginger slushies. I can speak for the frozen drinks and say they were delicious without being overly sweet. A friend mentioned to the waitress that we were celebrating out bachelorette and they came over with two ice cream sundaes and a round of shots all of the house. The ice cream sundae came in a bathtub and even had cotton candy on top (I was a happy kid). In a city where everyone is celebrating something, this restaurant made us feel special and set itself apart because of that. I would go back here anytime and furthermore, would go to any Roy Choi restaurant based on how fantastic this experience was.",

And even worse, dishes were so salty!! We had the Vegas salad (it was probably my favorite dish which is telling in itself), the uni fried rice, the kimchi fried rice, the tempura, fries, and Itaewon (like a kimchi ramen soup with lots of meat/veggies). We ended up taking the last dish home, added some more things to it to make it less sweet, and ate it again.  One plus was the cocktail (fuzzy navel?) and I liked the throwback music along with the personal touches on the menu (ha!). But the food was really not to my liking. I'll stick with Chego and Kogi in LA!",

The gluten free option of the wings did not do it any justice but they tried. The watermelon drinks were a bit strong which explained their price at $18, but that's what you get when you're on the strip. Would definitely come back to try other non-gluten free options.

The dishes I was not a fan of was the tamarind blackened cod stew, kimchi fried rice, Korean wings and slippery shrimp. There are so many great choices and I wish I had the stomach to eat them all. I will definitely go back to try more, but if the salmon enchilada is on the menu, I will always order it. We had two desserts, strawberry Cheesecake and date cake, hands down the date was the winner.",

Started my experience on a bad note, Had reservation for 8pm. When I got there they said \"I already sat\". Supposedly someone said they were my reservation and stole my table. I came in heated when I heard that. Why this place gets 5 stars is because after this complication, this restaurant did EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO MAKE SURE I HAD THE BEST EXPERIENCE. Decor here is hip and modern, food here is above average. Although I didn't hate any of the dishes I ordered, nothing blew me away. Food wise, I would give this place a 3-4 stars, But the reason I give this place 5 stars is because of the service and hospitality. Definitely worth a try.",

    "text": "I have been looking forward to going to this place for quite some time, I'd heard such great things and was super excited to go for my birthday. We had a party of five, we were a little late but my friend that was early let them know and they still accommodated us which was great. The servers are dressed in track suits which is a quirky weird thing, the ambiance was really dark and very LA themed. Our server took a while to come over, her name was MC, she wasn't overly friendly, just stayed professional however she was hardly ever at our table. She took the drink order for myself and one other person, walked away for 10 mins and then I had to tell her that other people wanted to order drinks, and my mom was at the table and she never even spoke to her or asked if she wanted anything to drink besides water. She was flexible when my drink was really sour and when there was an issue with one of my friends dishes but let me tell you, the menu is SUPER VAGUE,give brief descriptions and obviously you have to ask questions but when some thing is listed as yuzu shrimp and one is slippery shrimp but then one dish you get tail on, head on prawns and then the other is small little dried shrimp, it's really irritating. What else i don't understand is why the servers don't describe how the menu works when they talk to the table, i know this isn't your average concept of a restaurant but give us some basic facts on how everything works, and maybe train your servers so the dining experience is better.   My friend and i shared a few things, the spicy pork, which was delicious, Kim chi fried ride, also delicious. Slippery shrimp, good but not amazing. Cold seafood noodles, bleh, not delicious at all. Yuzu shrimp, not good, fell apart not flavorful but the worst thing was the lamb.. I absolutely love lamb and it was cooked perfectly but it was incredibly bland. The menu said kimchi chimichurri which sounded AMAZING.. there was no flavor whatsoever, just basic, under seasoned lamb chops with mushy vegetables. I was so excited to try the lamb but it was just not amazing at all..   They did tell the server it was my birthday and they gave me a pretty bomb pink dessert assortment that i couldn't identify..   I won't recommend this place to people that ask me about it.",

    "text": "When it's your birthday, don't you want to gather all your 'Best Friend'....dsdzzzz.....!  Ok, I know that was a stretch.  But that is exactly what I did and even chose the restaurant to match.  I was quite excited to try this since KBBQ is my favorite food of all time.  A lot of my taste buds were tarnished right from the start checking in for my reservation that I made months ahead.  It was tricky to find the host stand and people eating right next to the host stand/seated there was a little off putting and I prayed I wouldn't get those tables.  The hostess, a thin light skinned girl with jet black hair hardly spoke and I had to take initiative in telling her that I had a reservation. She silently checked her computer and told me to stand by.  That was it, no \"Are you celebrating anything? or other greeting\"  We waited and after a while, we checked in with a different hostess who then referred back to the girl, she sort of just handed over a small piece of paper and had an annoyed look.  I tried to put that aside and not let it spoil the mood.  Very funky atmosphere, the front feels like a 'typical' Korean convenience store with storage for tons of snacks and goods.  Some so-so merch with just 'best friend' written on it like t shirts and beanies and tumblers.  Otherwise, you pass through these 'walk in freezer' plastic curtains to be in an entryway that looks like a club entrance. Then you get to the restaurant which has an LA feel.  Menus look like a yearbook with vintage photos of Roy Choi and high school 'best friends' OH!  Now we get it... We ordered a lot including the Kalbi at $30-$35 and shrimp $38.  Banchan/side dishes which is normally included (Kimchi, cucumbers daikon) was $4 per and a very tiny bowl.  Everything was a la carte including just white rice.  We ordered cocktails like a maitai and a strawberry daquiri and it comes in red solo cups like you're at a high school/frat party.  hMMMM...!  Overall the food was just A-OK but nothing extraordinary.  My mom, being full blown Korean adamantly stated that the sundoboo was NOT sundoboo and anyone would agree because I found maybe 3-4 pea sized pieces of tofu in the entire pot.  Our server rebuffed everything with excuses saying that it is not supposed to be traditional.  Even when I said that I thought the food was salty, he stated \"yeah, eveyrything here is huh\"  They also need to have a pow-wow with some of their servers because some of them had strong B.O. and it would linger when they passed by further weakening my appetite.  It was really nice that they brought me the red cake for my bday and the guy said \"I am not going to sing\" which is my preference but....what if you were a guest who wanted the song?  Anyhow.....Take it for what this place is worth....a shnazzy joint on the strip....I guess go for the ambiance and then........mosey your way over to one of the many other GREAT KBBQ LV has to offer off the strip.....just UBER or Lyft it if you have to...and don't forget to bring your 'best friend'",

    "text": "Considering how much I love Kogi and I think Chego is decent as well, Best Friend would have to be the biggest disappointment ever. I might have to declare that Best Friend might really be the worst restaurant I've had in Las Vegas. Idk how else to put this but it is what it is. I'll start with the good points of Best Friend.   The service was good/great and the DJ was great. The DJ played some great classic while it wasn't annoying loud. The Hawaiian rolls/breads were great and the salad(Los Vegas Salad) was great. In fact, the salad that we ordered was the best dish that we ordered and the Hawaiian roll was the best thing I had during that dinner. I am not kidding you.    We ordered the stirred fried octopus, army stew, Kimche Fried Rice, Uni Dynamite Rice, Fries, and the Tempura. With the Uni Dynamite being the worst, I really don't recommend this dish. It is over salted and all you taste is the soy sauce/dynamite sauce that COMPLETELY overwhelms the rice. You honestly can't taste the uni because of the sauce that overwhelms the whole thing. With the army stew being the 2nd worse, let's talk about how it is $44. It is $44 and everything in it is not fresh ingredients, everything is just can opened or to say instant. You just make the soup base/idk if they did but everything else in it is Spam, sausage, rice cake, and ramen. To think that you really can't fucked this up, but they did. It was like I got punched in the face with a taste bud full of salt. They give you so much rice but I'm pretty sure even the rice can't overcome how insanely salty this dish was. With this army stew, we ended up taking it home (we only had 1/4 of it because we couldn't even eat it anymore). We had to \"save\" this dish by adding a lot of water/chicken stock to overcome the saltiness of this dish. Adding more ramen, etc. Basically we took it home to save this dish. As I'm writing this review, I feel like the army stew is on the same level of being the worst dish as the uni dynamite rice.  You don't really go wrong with the fries and tempura but it also wasn't anything special. I already went on that rant about the previous two items so I'll just leave these two dishes as is. The kimchee fried rice was the complete opposite of the Uni Dynamite + army stew in which it was under salted. It's not awful...at least you can actually eat it but it honestly lacked the kimchee flavor to it which was the weirdest thing to a KIMCHEE fried rice.   I will not be back. The service was good and all but this kind of food is just unacceptable. I went back to LA, and got korean food because of how awful it was at Best Friend. In summary, Best Friend is more like a Pei Wei kind of place where they tried to get the foreigners to pay the premium for not so high quality korean food.",

He made sure our kids (ages 2 & 4) were taken care of first. He understood it was important to keep them fed and busy so right away he put in our order of plain fries for the kids. He also made sure they had their drinks in to go cups (plastic cups with lids and straws). One the kids started in their fries, he came back went over the menu with us. He made awesome recommendations, all of which we took. We ordered the uni dynamite rice, buttermilk fried chicken and spicy bbq pork. This is a Korean \"fusion\" restaurant so a lot of the items are marinated or dusted with Korean seasonings which can be a little spicy. Not intensely hot but mildly spicy. The food comes out when ready, so the food will no all be delivered at the same time. Sam explained this to us up front. We didn't mind because quite frankly we were enjoying the 90s LA vibe and music (90s hip hop and R&B).  Servers are dressed in adidas track suits and the runners have a kick back 90s attire as well.  The menu is fun and reminiscent of someone's high school binder in the 90s who is Asian.  To sum it up... EXCELLENT SERVICE, great food and a dope Vibe. We look forward to coming back.",

    "text": "A little bit of LA in LV.  Stopped by for dinner on a Saturday night at 5pm. Made reservations well in advance on the Park MGM website to avoid the dinner rush. We were seated promptly and were able to order right away. Had the elotes, kogi beef tacos, and the kalbi. Desert was medjool date cake. I really enjoyed all the food we ordered, which came out fresh and hot. Beers were served cold and reasonably priced. There's an area out front which sells souvenirs and gifts-perfect IG content. The main dining area is behind the gift shop, located in the back.   Service was great. Very attentive staff who cleared our table regularly and  refilled our drinks. Loved the track suit uniforms. Music was a tad loud, but it made the dining area very ~vibey~.  Prices are more on the expensive side, but hey, what do you expect? Definitely give it a try if you're anywhere near Park MGM just for the experience. Would I come back? Yeah, definitely. Located in the casino area of the Park MGM adjacent to Eataly.",

The front bar is deceiving and doesn't draw you into the back dining room behind the pink plastic slat doors.  Once you make your way you come into a well decorated very chic ambiance of a restaurant.   The menu is huge.  With traditional Korean items with modern Mexican spins on them.    There is a nice cocktail menu with great creative drinks.  I opted for Salty Dog cocktail. Wow what a great drink. They first brought out warm sweet rolls that were served in a hot pan right from the oven.   My entree was the Chego Pork Belly Bowl.  Wow. Best bowl ever!  It was loaded with the right mix of fried egg, radish, broccoli, cotija and peanuts.   This place will not disappoint!   A must try for anyone looking for a great meal in an outstanding location.",

    "text": "LA Inspired + 90s inspired decor/vibe + Korean + Mexican =  Best Friend...I'm so down with this...  BF Service & Ambiance: The facade gives this convenience store vibe that houses the host station and a full bar.  There's merchandise and cocktails to buy in this colorful room filled with 90s pop decor and the bar is overloaded with stickers on the bar top.  Walk through the hallway and you're in the main dining area that has it's own bar.  Vaulted ceilings have plants hanging down, DJ booth is pumping jams, and massive monitors display video decor.  Our first visit we popped in unannounced (no reso) and were lucky to get 4 seats at the bar in the main dining area.  Our bartenders/servers were awesome.  Friendly, good mixology skills and checked on us frequently.  The kitchen got our dishes to us quickly.  If there was a way to reserve seats at the bar, I would.  Great work.  BF Cuisine: They start you off with warm Hawaiian rolls and we ordered the Koji Short rib tacos as an appetizer.  Small in size but massive in flavor. FYI if you're used to complimentary banchan dishes at your local Korean restaurants, they're $4 a dish here.  I wish the Chego Pork Bowl had more pork but it was tasteful and overall very good.  The BFF's shaking beef saltado was the better dish: Packed with beef and fries, it was savory, she couldn't finish it, so I was there for the assist!   The A-Frame OG Ribs were decent but pricey considering the amount of ribs you received. The Elotes street corn was delish and definitely a repeat order. The strawberry cheesecake is their best dessert imo. The cheesecake itself is not too sweet and it comes with a strawberry mousse, and strawberry sherbet.  Fantastic.  I tried the watermelon and hibiscus soju slushie and it was refreshing and good-tasting but tame in terms of alcohol content.  This is a very heavy social media friendly resto for your fans.  Overall, the chow is pricey, full-flavored but on the smaller side in terms of quantity.   Your LA Foodie friends will want to visit when they come to town and this is a place to come with big groups so everyone can sample up.  I love the ambiance and the 90s theme.  The service is top notch friendly and I'm looking forward to trying more of their dishes in the near future.  That's another tale though, enjoy! =)",

I think they need to add more higher quality veggies instead of adding a whole lot of sliced onions (which is what the dish mostly consisted of). I would've rather ordered the $22 ribs, which would've been a better value. Also the waiter didn't make it clear that the veggies were not included with the chicken that we ordered. Regardless the $19 veggies were a rip off.",

The menu was fine tuned, with each item staying True to the restaurants unique upscale/street theme. Yet there was enough options to satisfy my group's varying tastes. And OH the Food. The complementary Hawaiian rolls, well there's really only one word: scrumptious. I have had many tacos in my life, but the Kogi Short Rib Tacos will definitely stand out in my memory. The slippery shrimp was another universal favorite. Between all of us, we had the Elotes, the Carnitas Tacos, the Cheggo Pork Belly Bowl, and cold noodles. The words \"Fantastic\" \"Amazing\" \"Delicious\" may have flown back and forth over our plates several times. My only warning is that the Pork Belly Bowl has some SERIOUS kick. If you dont do spicy, dont do this bowl. Also, I Have to mention that the service was on point. Danny was friendly, helpful, and informative. Maybe it's the LA in me, but I love this place.",

The vibe was 90s era, great music, staff dressed in throw back hip hop wear (track suits, bucket hat...only thing missing gold chains). I came for the food so let me start off by saying it was delicious, very tasty. What I didn't appreciate were the up charges for everything from rice to kimchee, and the meager portion sizes. Waiter was inattentive. He made up for it by giving a 20% employee discount. I ordered Kalbi for $18 (equal to lunch size portion), my daughter had spicy pork belly for $15. The normally gratuitous side dishes and rice were priced at $2.50 for 1/2 cup rice, and $4 each for kimchee, spinach, bean sprouts, daikon, cucumbers, etc (with no free refills). The food arrives in spurts; I got my Kalbi first and waited another 7 minutes for the rest of food to arrive before we dug in. To keep the bill reasonable we stuck to drinking tap water, but when we needed a refill on the 8 oz goblet, waiter was nowhere to be found. The food runner accidentally brought us a bottle of carbonated water. Before the discount my bill was $72.   I would not recommend this establishment if you're trying to stay within budget; you can get more for your buck (e.g. Lee's Korean BBQ on Spring Mountain and Rainbow offers all you can eat for $19.99-$34.99/person....rice and kimchee included!)",

The fried rice was undercooked. The salad it self was better than any of the other options  The spoons smelled like fish.  Honestly it was TERRIBLE.

    "text": "I have been wanting to try some Roy Choi's food for a long time! Since I was in Vegas I was so excited to go. The bar was awesome, loads of cool and interesting things to look at and the host staff was very accommodating since we were not able to make a reservation. They even got us a table writhing 10 minutes. Our waiter was awesome and explained how we should order to get the most out of our experience. We decided to get the chefs selection menu.  Oh did that not disappoint. We started with these rolls that were like little pillows of heaven. That was followed by these amazing Korean ribs that were spicy and sticky and sweet.  NExt was the tempura shrimp in this wonderfully spicy and sweet sauce. Then the big guns showed up in the form of the pork belly rice bowl. It was perfectly cooked with a delicious hoisin based sauce!! If all of this weren't enough, our next offering was the tacos!! MAN ALIVE... they were awesome. We each got a delicious carnitas taco and pork belly taco. Low and behold our next to the last item we're delicious grilled elotes. Finally, the dessert portion of our dinner, a date and chocolate cake with caramel ice cream and whip cream. Best Friends hit a home run in my book for the fabulous food to the exceptional service. It truly is deserving of all 5 stars!!",

    "text": "We recently vacationed in Vegas, always a favorite dining destination, and found our way to Best Friend, recommended by our best friend in Los Angeles! A longtime fan of Roy Choi's other offerings, we were stoked to try this one.  Initially we were wowed by the cocktail program which was an updated take on favorite 80's cocktails. The updated fuzzy navel with muddled peaches was our favorite, and we doubled down on this one. So good!  The menu was divided between traditional Korean fare, and modern Roy Choi creations. We opted for the traditional Korean BBQ feast and weren't sorry for that choice.  The star of the show for us was the Uni Dynamite Fried Rice. Without a doubt the showstopper of the menu and the standout for the KBBQ feast option. Our server kindly noticed the kitchen was nearly out of the Uni Dynamite fried rice and snagged one for us and fired it on the front end of our KBBQ feast instead of the end, and that was a very clutch maneuver.  We'll be back for the progressive takes on the old favorite cocktails, and definitely for the Uni Dynamite Fried Rice. Honorable mention for the yummy buttery puffy rolls.",

We ordered couple dishes served family style: street corn, kalbi tacos, grilled veggies, and Kim chee fried rice. No dessert because this was our second lunch of the day and we were full.

Not  5 min to Frogger across the valet and get the car, 5 for the light to change to cross the boulivard, 20 in traffic, 2 not to run over people in the parking lot, 1 to walk to the resto door just to be told the wait will be 2 hours.  No.  Food NOW!\"  to nods of agreement from the group.  \"And they better have kim chee\".  Enter Best Friend.    Koreanish, Asian fusion food designed by bad a$$ chef Roy Choi  for the Cali palate AKA hipster street food all prettied up for its IG moment.  Good use of fresh locally sourced veg and microgreens, deeply marinated items, flavorful sauces all with well controlled heat for the masses.  And yes, they have kim chee.  Note:  Banchan is NOT free.  $4 each.  Fresh (except the in house aged, well fermented kim chee) but no different from your local KBBQ joint.  Rice is NOT free.  Carnivores, get the rack of lamb and/or dry aged tomahawk and share.  The rack of lamb is beautifully seasoned, cooked a nice mid rare and finished in a zesty kim chee chimichurri with enough garlic, fish sauce and fermented goodness to bring out the gamey notes of the lamb and add the umami finish.  The dry aged tomahawk, well prepared, cooked close to temp (slightly over) finished with a compound gochujang butter.  Slight heat and fermented bean paste works like the lamb enhancing the bleu cheese funk and boosting the umami finish.  The LA Sh*t selections comparison good but don't wow.  Korean / Mex fusion is played out.  Good Korean fusion tacos (kogi short rib taco), flavorful but not much different from others.  Tender, sweet,  but over seasoned  hoisin chili baby back ribs (A-Frame OG Ribs).    Korean BBQ items are good.  Marinades strong and sweet.  Zero complaints on the Kalbi and spicy pork.  Both have a nice char finish and hints of pear sweetness but neither  significantly better necessarily than your fave top notch KBBQ joint.  Energetic servers.  Some lapses (it's hard to eat without a knife).  Solid and thanks to the celebrity of the chef and understanding its Strip location, one where you won't mind paying 3x-4x what you would at an KBBQ joint.",

We waited less than 10 minutes before we were brought to the dining room past the vinyl curtains.  Lots of things on the menu sounded good, and we ended up ordering the Slippery Shrimp, BBQ chicken, and a dish with rice and veggies.  (I forgot the name of it.)  For dessert we split the strawberry cheesecake and to drink I had a non-alcoholic slushee.  Everything was really good and I'd recommend all the dishes we got!  Including the free rolls that came with our meal :)  I will say though that they use paper straws so my slushee was hard to drink after a little while, a bit annoying but won't complain about their effort to eliminate plastic.    Tables in our section were close enough so that you could hear your neighbor's conversation, but far enough for a person to walk through to get to the bench seat along the wall.  Also, their meals are served family-style which means portions are huge, so come with a big appetite if you come with a small party!  Our server was good, not as enthusiastic or knowledgeable as the guy who served the table next to us, but then again we really didn't ask many questions and I was pleased with the service we received.  (So perhaps she was just as knowledgeable.)  I definitely recommend checking out Best Friend!",

I definitely want one of those best friend jackets, and hat. The restaurant itself is dope, and the music selection was off the hook. I found myself singing along admiring the staffs jumpsuit. I am definitely jealous, u wish my employers would of let me rock one.  Onto the food, both visits I ordered the tomahawk, and both times they were amazing! Perfectly seasoned and cooked, it pairs well with the kimchi fried rice. Which the kimchi fried rice is delicious and has a perfect texture. I am drooling just thinking about it! The banchan sides are sold individually or as a sampler- I wish they were included like most Korean spots. But I guess you gotta pay a lil more for the experience.  Overall the prices may be high, but the experience and quality makes it except-able for special occasions or date night! Hey! Would I come back- hell yah! Anytime soon, nah- I don't wanna burn myself out from over indulging.",

    "text": "\"Sometimes, in the deepest moments, there are no words. There is only food.\"  Roy Choi  Have you ever been to a backyard BBQ in Koreatown, LA during the 90's? Yeah, me neither but this was the vision.  I was hoping to love everything about Best Friend and with all these great reviews, I was shocked when our dinner didn't match up with everyone else's. We ordered a wide variety of items like banchan [kimchi, cucumbers, and brussel sprouts], Korean wings, dumplings, tacos [carnitas and short rib], and some itaewon [army stew] for good measure. We also had some cocktails and a bottle of wine. So what the heck happened?  The carnitas were dry, the Korean wings were okay, the dumplings disintegrated as soon as you try to pick them up, the banchan was vinegary, and the itaewon was a super concentrated sodium bomb. The itaewon was the thing we all got hung up on the most and were the most disappointed with. There was pretty much no broth in the itaewon so it was like we were eating spoonfuls of Gochujang and nothing else. Check out the picture I took. It may look like tomato paste but nope... just over-rendered army stew, folks. That stew is seriously like the ex-lover with more baggage than a bellhop. Just bad flavor and bad texture all around.  Roy Choi, I came to Best Friend wanting to walk away with you as my best friend but we're more like best frenemies. I guess a \"Roy x Joy\" collaboration wasn't in the cards. I wanted a mix tape of love songs but what I got was a diss track.  :(  Posted on April 1st because I felt like a True April fool for trying this place out.",

The customer service is great but this place needs improvement to validate its ridiculous prices.  If you are looking for drunk food with salt bomb, this is the place for you. I did not look at the reviews on this restaruant since I wanted to come here blind with no bias opinions. I rather go to Chinatown to get better food or throw $200 on black on the roulette table in Las Vegas.   The stew was done technically wrong. It was suppose to be a stew and it came out as a thick spaghetti sauce. You are known for your tacos since you came from a taco food truck. Guess what? The meat is dry with no flavor.  We had two different tacos, some Korean wings, dumplings, banchan, and a stew. The tacos were way dry. The dumplings are okay but they fell apart. The wings were okay too. The banchan has too much vinegar and the stew was thick and salty.   Thank u, next.",

We didn't ask until the end and the DJ did change the music. I wanted the absolute LA vibe so we requested some west coast gangsta music haha.   About the food.... I didn't like the uni fried rice. It was, sour. But everything made up for it. The kimchi fried rice was amazing, especially paired with the Kalbi. The Kogi tacos and Korean wings were so good as well. I had the watermelon drink, while my friend had the cucumber and they were both refreshing.   Already planning our next rendezvous here! Tip: make reservations!!",

I saw my favorite steak ever othe menu and was anxious to try the BBQ Ribeye!  I also ordered from the Banchan menu....cucumbers, Kimchee and the pickled daikong...all fantastic. I ordered the white rice to finish off my feast!  I will only say everything was on point, the steak perfectly cooked with a marinade that was perfect...charred and tremendous flavor....and served on a bed of white onions that perfectly complimented the steak. The banchan appetizers were all perfect....reminded me of my Mom's cooking growing up...really really good!  I sat at the bar, great service... highly recommended! 5 stars",

    "text": "I've been to Best Friend a few times now and I've enjoyed the food and service the times I've been here. I highly recommend getting a reservation because you'll be sorry if you don't especially on a weekend where the wait could be at least 2 hours! Yikes!  Upon entering, the place looks like an Asian market selling Asian snacks and junk food from different countries like Japan, China, Korea, Philippines, etc. You can also buy Best Friend merchandise. They have dining tables here too. On our first time, we assumed that people at the table next to the host booth worked there and we were about to ask them about our reservation until we got closer and saw they were eating! Oops!  The hostesses wear a red dress and a red jacket and they lead you through the red plastic dividers to get into the restaurant that looks busy with murals, pictures, and plants hanging. At the table, you'll find those Catholic votive candles with Our Lady of Guadalupe and Archangel Saint Michael, and other hints of Mexican culture since this place is owned by Roy Choi - the man who started the whole Korean - Mexican food amalgamation with his Kogi food truck in L.A.  The servers wear Adidas track suits in green or red. And they're all fantastic. You'll be handed a yellow binder which is the menu. The vibe and the music will take you back to the late 80's-early 90's. They'll give you some Hawaiian rolls while you wait for your food.  I love everything I've tried here:  Dumplings - 4/5 Slippery Shrimp - mild spicy kick. Lightly breaded and pleasantly crisp. 5/5 Elotes - no fluff, just good Mexican corn 4/5 Uni Bowl - 4/5 Veggie Bowl - slightly on the spicy side but all the banchan combined with rice and egg on top. 4/5 Kalbi - 4/5 Kalbi Tacos - 4/5 Strawberry Cheesecake - I love the presentation! Very creative and whimsical. I hate to say this but it's IG-worthy and it tastes good 5/5 Mango Budino - 4/5",

    "text": "There's no better place for a late night best friend dinner date than at Best Friend in The Park MGM.  My best friend and I were eager to get our grub on after an watching an exciting Knights game earlier that evening. While we were worried their might be a long wait when we arrived at Best Friend, we were pleasantly surprised as the hostess greeted us and told us we could be seated immediately. She walked us through a short hallway with large red plastic blinds. As you push through, your suddenly enter an cozy candlelit oasis with hanging plants on the ceiling and cute city themed decor around all edges of the restaurant. I really loved the spin they put on their decor to where it has an Asian flair and city vibes with a cozy ambiance all in one. Who knew all three of those things could work so well together!  Now let's get to the important part, the food! While their late night menu is smaller than their traditional menu, it still had a great selection of Mexican and Korean bbq inspired items to choose from. We ordered the LA street dog, Korean wings, Kobi tacos, Carnitas tacos, and a side of kimchi. Everything we ate was extremely delicious and flavorful with the slight exception of the carnitas tacos (they needed some sort of sauce to add flavor because the meat itself was somewhat bland). The Korean wings were so deliciously spicy though that I honestly wish I ordered more than one order of them (although my mouth may have been on fire if I did that haha).   All in all I really enjoyed the food and ambiance that Best Friend offers. I also enjoyed the music selection the DJ was playing that night-nothing better than late 80s and early 90s jams to get your night going! Thank you to the wonderful prompt staff at Best Friend who seated us and waited on us. They were absolutely wonderful and thank you to the chef who made the most amazing Mexican and Korean items for us that night! We will see you soon Best Friend!",

    "text": "This *should* have been a 5 star review, but two major points made it a solid 4 star. Let me explain...  We travel to Vegas two or three times a year and are always in search of new experiences and places to dine. While staying at the Bellagio back in December we heard some buzz about Best Friend. We looked into it when we got home, became excited and booked a reservation for our March trip.  We made an early reservation for Friday evening before heading to The Cosmopolitan to see Opium. We loved Best Friend. We loved the decor. We loved the vibe. We loved the music. We loved the service (our waiter was awesome). We loved the drinks. And we LOVED the food.   So let's start with the food and drinks. We opted to go with the Korean BBQ ($65 per person). I had a couple of Asahi Super Dry beers (highly recommended light tasty beer with dinner) and Heather opted to try a Watermelon & Hibiscus Soju before switching to a beer with me for her second bevy. Drinks were great.  The Korean BBQ was absolutely amazing. Banchan Sampler to start was plentiful and delicious. The salad was crazy good. The Uni Dynamite Rice was served lava hot and amazing. We loved the BBQ Garlic Chicken, but the BBQ Spicy Pork was our favorite dish.  And we asked to sub the Strawberry Cheesecake dessert for the Mejool Date Cake (which is the dessert offering on the L.A. Love Story dinner option). We were glad we did as it was fantastic. This was honestly SUCH an incredible meal and fun time.  So why only a 5 Star Rating? As I said, two reasons. First off, we paid by Visa. We tipped generously (as was deserved) but when we got home and it converted to Canadian dollars this ended up being a $310 meal. Now as awesome as this was, it WAS NOT $310 awesome. A comparable Korean meal at home would run us a third of this. I understand we were stung by Vegas strip casino restaurant mark up, but my god that was excessive.I'm not saying we wouldn't return, but we would be much more cautious on the pricing of items.  Issue #2 is that we never did receive the BBQ Kalbi beef that was part of our meal. Now to be honest we never asked... there was already more food than we could handle and we weren't interested in taking leftovers as our room didn't have a fridge (and we didn't want to cart a bag of food with us all evening). But at the price the are charging here they should probably be   bit more conscious that you actually get all the food you are paying for. Again, we just decided to let it go as we were full and our server would have been all over it had we mentioned something. Just worth noting when pricing was so high.  I think next time we would look at sharing something smaller and a beer. We aren't cheap, but the price here for Korean food was a tad shocking.",

I thought I didn't have room but of course I found space for a delish dessert that had coffee ice cream. Bomb.

    "text": "Had some friends in town and had this place bookmarked for a while so decided to give it a try. We came as soon as they opened at 5pm Saturday (it got busy pretty quickly) and ordered the following items: Korean fried chicken, short rib tacos, the slippery shrimp, kalbi ribs, kimchi fried rice, and the veggie bowl (which is basically bibimbop). So I had higher hopes for this place given the owner (who actually happened to be there that night with a camera crew), but after trying everything I'd have to say the food was just too bland for me. My friends thoroughly enjoyed everything but the shrimp (I don't eat shrimp so I couldn't give my opinion). So I thought that the beef missing something, maybe it was not marinated enough I'm not sure, but I was expecting a more savory bite. The same goes with the chicken wings. They just seemed to be covered in a generic hot sauce, which did have a slight kick, but was not sweet or savory like I'm used to. The dipping sauce was very watery as well and did not add any flavor to the wings. However, I truly did enjoy the kimchi fried rice the most, which was unexpected. So even though I wasn't super impressed with the food, I really did appreciate the decor of the restaurant with LA style art that had Mexican and Korean influence. The waiters were dressed in track suits or white t-shirts and khakis. The music was awesome lol we were jamming to it. The service was very quick and the staff was super nice.",

The location:  Front of Park MGM.  The throwback 80's style signage is hip and fresh. The Vibe:  This place is best summed up in one word....Cool!  DJ spinning hip hop from the 80's and 90's really added to the cool factor here as well as all the servers dressed in Adidas jumpsuits with a few expos dressed as B-Boys.   The service:  Top notch.  We were late arrivals (on both nights) so we had to grab a seat at the bar which was surprisingly easy considering how packed the place was.  Our server/bartender was attentive and incredibly friendly.  She made some great recommendations. The food:  OMG THE FOOD!  Do yourself a favor and try the slippery shrimp.  It was perfect.  We also had the pork belly bowl which was great as well.  The rice soaked up the spicy sauce and really paired well with the beer we got. The price:  It actually was not bad AT ALL!  A meal for 2 with 2 drinks was about $70.  In Vegas, that's a deal!  For the ambiance, service, food quality and overall feel, this place has earned it's spot as one of my absolute favorites in Vegas. As the title said, we ate their twice.  Friday and Saturday night.  This is rare for my wife and I as we always like to try something new.....but this place made such a great first impression, we had to do it again. Do yourself a favor, try Best Friend.  You'll love it!",

I know it is the kimchi that make the rice very salty and spicy, but this is the only taste of that dish!!!( I have tried kimchi rice from so many other Korean restaurants, they are more flavorful). And the rice is tooooo wet for the fried rice! Besides that, all of my other dishes are outstanding! Definitely recommend the kalbi and pork belly bowl!",

Had the watermelon cocktail which was amazing. We also had the pork belly bowl, marinated cucumbers, dumpling (sooooo paper thin and delicious). Finished up with a shaved ice! Bartender in the bodega last night was awesome, bar stools were comfortable, atmosphere was friendly and fun. CHECK THIS PLACE OUT!",

    "text": "Bummed to post this follow up but I've been to Best Friend 2 more times since the opening and the experience has been subpar.   The second time I went, half the food came out cold and we had to send it back. We tried the Uni Dynamite Rice and it came out cold and was not good. When they brought it out again it was piping hot and delicious. The spicy pork was bland the second time around. On the other hand, the tacos were even better than the first time. Also tried the Shaking Beef Saltado and it was the standout dish for us for sure. Tried a couple more of the pots, the doritang and itaewon. This is definitely a fusion that does not work for me. My non-korean friends seemed to enjoy the doritang but it was a little too different for my taste. The itaewon was a pretty big miss for the whole time - too salty for everyone.   Third visit, the spicy pork this time was WAY oversauced and again came out cold. The beef saltado was not as good as the first time as it was also too salty. We got the bingsoo and the date cake for dessert again and the bingsoo had huge chunks of ice in it that were hard to eat and the cake was very dry.  Overall, I still love Roy and his vision and respect his recipes. I think the biggest issue is that the other times I've gone he has not been in the kitchen. Because both the 2nd and 3rd visit were a very different experience from the 1st. Hopefully, I'll catch Roy the next time we go.",

    "text": "This is a late post but I still wanted to review this place. We went during restaurant week and they had a great prix fix meal. It was a great deal to be able to try a variety their menu that includes apps, main course and dessert. We had the slippery shrimp, banchan and kalbi tacos for apps, bbq chicken and pork belly with fried rice for entrees and date cake with toffee ice cream for dessert. Everything was tasty and flavorful. It all had that authentic Korean flavors with a twist on some. It was so much food and great for sharing. My absolute favorite was the date cake with ice cream. It was one of my favorite desserts eaten at a restaurant for me. The cake was served warm with the delicious toffee ice cream. It was heaven. I thought I wasn't going to have room for it since I had already ate so much but it was demolished. The vibe in the restaurant is busy and very L.A. street vibe. It was very busy so be sure to make reservations as we did and still had to wait an extra 15 min before seated. It was worth it and the price was good since we ate there on a special week. I would definitely return here to try more food. They have really cool cocktails too but I know I want more of that dessert.",

The entrance to the restaurant is through two red slat openings and it turns into this cool LA downtown vibes with a real DJ and everything! The music was pretty cool for a Sunday night.  The free bread in the beginning is delicious like a salty warm Hawaiian bread. I highly recommend the kogi tacos and the pork belly bowl, I was stuffed! The French fries and the dipping sauce that came with it was amazing! The kimchi fried rice was meh, wouldn't order again. Almost forgot, the strawberry daiquiri slushie was awesommmeeeee!",

    "text": "I used to eat Kogi every week when they parked outside my work in LA. Love Roy Choi's vision, big fan of him personally.   Ate here last night (Tues)...Wish I could give it 5 stars but the service was just bad. The hosts were rude and seemed put off that we wanted to sit, despite having a reservation. They had us wait and immediately sat another group who walked in after us. We let it go..   Our waiter, Korey, was running around with such haste we could barely get a word in. The one time he came by (to take our drink/food order at the same time) he was so quick to take off it felt like we were being completely cut off. Expos brought our food out and Korey never came back despite checking on all the tables around us. He forgot the kimchi I ordered probably because of his haste I mentioned above. Finally we had to go order a 2nd round of drinks from the bartender directly. Korey dropped the drinks off but was clearly annoyed about us taking matters into our own hands. Later he dropped the check and just said \"here you go.\" No thank you, no sorry it was busy, no have a good night. Zero acknowledgement. After reading other reviews, it seems like the bad service is a trend here.  Food was good. Kimchi fried rice was burnt but I guess that was intentional? We still liked it. The spicy pork was good as were the short rib tacos. Everything was overpriced though.. and the soups? I've never seen a Soondubu or Kimchee Chigae for more than $10-15 usd. $40 usd is insaneeee. I'm Korean I can go to Korea and get the best tasting stews for $5 usd, c' mon.   All in all food was pretty good but service really makes or breaks it. There's nothing worse than having a bad experience when you're spending all this money. Probably not gonna come back any time soon when there's so many bomb restaurants in Vegas.   For Roy's sake, retrain your staff on respect for customers, also get more servers on the floor! We never saw a manager.. didn't appear to be anyone running things last night.   Really cool vibe/aesthetic tho... makes me really miss LA and the Kogi truck.",

Preface: When Kogi first started out, I was waiting in occasionally hour long lines on Wednesdays outside of the Golden Gopher just for a taste of those scrumptious short rib tacos with a squeeze of the triangle orange slices they used to give out.  Order: Hennessy and Coke slushy Kalbi Korean wings Short rib tacos  Situation: We got there after 10 PM not knowing that there was a late night menu so that's our bad. We were hoping for the dinner menu and tried to make the best of it. The Hennessy and Coke slushy and kalbi were awesome. I was so excited for the short rib tacos of yesteryear, but these weren't it. The marinade wasn't right, which the meat had been sitting in too long. Not fresh and completely overcooked. The slaw was all wrong and where was the salsa flavor?! The Korean wings were basically buffalo wings, which I hate, so not impressed at all. No hint of that Asian sweetness AT ALL. I provided feedback to the waiter when asked how everything was and he was indifferent. I will never go back. I'm upset I wasted a Vegas meal here!!!  There are varying priced deliciousness just mere steps away. Good luck competing with that...",

This is not a traditional Korean place nor a Mexican place but whatever it is the food ought to taste good unfortunately it was not. Here's a rundown our group of 4 had   Mixed Tempura :  2 small pieces of shrimp and a heap of vegetables. Just decent   Banchan: in every other Korean restaurant these are free and plentiful here they charge you for it. We ordered 2 Kim chi and it was not good. It came in a tiny metal bowl and was over fermented. We didn't even finish what little they gave because it tasted that bad.   Kimchi Fried Rice :  has no flavor. Tasted like rice and sesame seed oil with an egg. Not good   Dumplings :  this was actually probably the best dish we had. They were flavorful and the dipping sauce was great.   Hawaiian Bread : neither Korean nor Mexican but they were good. Had some oil brushes on top and salt.  These were complimentary there was no charge for this.   Kalbi: just decent. Not very flavorful and meat was tough. This tasted like what someone who got the recipe form a cookbook whipped up.   Salmon teriyaki :  think this is a Japanese dish but it was decent.   Soondubu:  this was the worst soondubu we ever tasted. A real stretch to call this soondubu fusion or not. It was so bad that we actually sent this dish back.   We were so disappointed in this place. We were hoping for a good Korean meal and what we got was just plain pretend Korean food.  We wouldn't even mind the prices if the food was actually good.  The service was good our waitress was friendly and nice..  four of us dined 3 were Korean and one was American. Unfortunately we will not be back.",

Everything in there encompassed the LA 80s-90s culture in the eyes of a 3rd grader Roy Choi into one restaurant, like you just time travelled back to see N.W.A. and Tupac. Music is loud like a hip hop club; definitely hard for a conversation if you're not face to face.  The food we ordered was all executed well. Chicken was juicy and fell off the bone. Octopus was not too rubbery like it was massaged before it was cooked. Chicken wings came from chicken like they actually enjoyed a good life - small but full of flavor. Everything had a heavy hand of gochujang, a Korean spicy paste.  But all easily findable in LA, but not so easily in Vegas.   Service is good. Even Roy Choi the man himself came through.  The place has room to grow, but definitely off to a great start.",

    "text": "We stayed in The Park MGM and Best Friend came highly recommended by my hair stylist. Being from LA we are very familiar with the genius that is Roy Choi so our expectations were high.  The place is so freaking cool. I honestly have never seen anything like it. I really, really appreciated the attention to detail that charmingly reflected   LA's diverse multi-ethnic comfort food scene.  For those not used to eating Koreatown and LA street food, you may not appreciate the experience. It truly is a palette specific to growing up in LA (and I mean LA not Beverly Hills, The Valley or even Santa Monica).  Therefore, many of the dishes, if not all, will seem very foreign to you. Know that the flavors are intense and hot. But if you are open minded and want to take your palette to the next level. BEST FRIEND IS A MUST.  I ordered the Kogi Tacos for which Roy Choi is infamous. I have to say, that they did not taste the same as the ones I eat here in LA. Still good, just not the same.  We also got the house ramen seasoned fries. To die for. I could have eaten those every day. I highly recommend.   We also had the elote (a staple of LA street food.) This is served off the cob which was perfect because my daughter wears braces. It was pretty damn accurate in the flavor profiles but slightly elevated which made it unique to Best Friend.  I have to disclose that because I can't do super spicy anymore because of a weird skin condition, I was limited but we did find familiar and scrumptious items on the menu to enjoy.  The house \"Hawaiian rolls\" were all kinds of buttery fluffy just sweet enough deliciousness.  The service from the door on the table was top notch. Also, extremely well priced for the quality of the food and the experience.   Good job, Chef Choi! Way to represent The City of Angels! We are fans.",

    "text": "This could only be a one star when you see how much they charge for rice. It's 3 fricken dollars for the size of basically a tea cup. It's like $40 for a 50lbs bag of rice so inono where this price is coming from. Roy choi is betraying the Asian community by sticking it to us with rice. Other than that had the kalbi and spicy pork. The flavor is nothing special. You can get all this at a korean restaurant in Oakland for like half the price. And the jaymo & ginger was weak as hell. $18 for a normal size Moscow mule mug so not that big maybe bigger than my rice bowl. Tasted like a Moscow mule with zero jaymo and 100% ginger. Overall it's a 1 time thing for me, tried it didn't like it. That's $100 I'm never getting back.",

So, I had to explain this is just one part of the restaurant, the full bar. Whoever decorated this place did a great job. Very young LA vibe with all the cultures mixed in.   The food was very pricey for \"street food\" korean/fusion/Mexican. We ordered kimchee rice, korean wings, gogi kalbi tacos, octopus dish, shrimp, and some drinks. Food was ok. The octopus dish was my favorite and chicken wings were my least favorite. The gogi tacos were disappointing. The kimchee rice was decent. I could have gotten more for your buck in K-town. But we figured this is Vegas.   The service was awesome. Love the Hawaiian bread. The cucumber cocktail was very good. Overall experience was great. There was no wait bc we arrived at 5:00 Friday night. We sat right away. I hope they would add the octopus sauce on the wings, then maybe would be ok. Also the batter needs to be crispy seemed baked. Gogi tacos needs more flavor on the marinade.",

We were sat down by the hostess, 5 to 10 mins later no one came by until we flagged the hostess down by eye contact as she saw and noticed we were unattended nor taken care of. Even our menus were closed which should be a cue or indicator we are ready to order? Seeing that our waiter was managing several tables around us but the fact he failed to even stop by to even introduce himself and that he will be with us shortly. Even others that was seated after us and adjacent was even attended before us. Honestly I would not recommend this place based on this horrible first impression. With the addition of overpriced Korean fusion, the service was just not there to justify the overall experience. The food was just ok considering that I have dined at other concepts of Roy Choi's in LA. Take your business and experience and spend else where in Vegas that is worth your money.",

    "text": "I don't know man. If you've ever been to Korean BBQ you know that banchan and rice are included with the meal. Here, each banchan item was $4. As soon as I left I wanted to go to a typical Korean bbq place to make up for the money spent here. As much as I love the aesthetics, I didn't think it lived up to the hype food-wise. One of the best things we had here were the complimentary Hawaiian rolls that come out hot and super delicious. We also ordered the kimchi cucumbers which were also very good but not any different from what I've had at other places. The wings were really good but I think we got about 6 for $15. Knowing how much food actually costs makes it really hard to enjoy things like that with such a high price tag. We also got the Chego pork belly bowl. The pork belly in it was cooked to perfection but they used waaay too much cotija cheese. It really overpowered the dish for me. We also ordered kimchi fried rice which was delicious but I didn't think it was any better than the one from the off-the-strip restaurant Komex. Overall I think I hyped this place up in my head and was left a little disappointed. Coming from SoCal I LOVED the nods to LA and the overall vibe. I also loved the menu choices but knowing how much these foods actually cost and how much they're charging ehhh left a bad taste in my mouth. I think I'd come back to try the more traditional items or large format items with a group.",

    "text": "The finest Korean fusion food that is famous in Los Angeles is now in Las Vegas! I've been to many traditional Korean restaurants and while I loved them, they stick to the traditional taste. Roy Choi has taken Korean food to the next level and set the bar very high. The kimchi fried rice is one example of that innovation. If you are on a diet and could only eat one meal at the restaurant, that's the food that you should order. We also tried the Kalbi and spicy pork and they are superior than the other restaurants I have tried. They were perfectly marinated and were very tender. (You can tell that the meat is of high quality). I also recommend their freshly baked pan de leche. It is very aromatic and soft. If you have not tried the Kogi short rib taco, you must order it also. The combination of the crunchy marinated thinly sliced cabbage blends perfectly with the short rib and taco shell. We loved all the food (kimchi soup based with noodles, desserts, etc) that we ordered and were extremely satisfied with it.  If you like traditional Korean food, and have the willingness to try a unique take on it, I highly recommend trying Best Friend.",

Super cool, kinda speak-easy entry from what looks like a rag-tag Korean liquor store into a big room with tables. Casual, great photography and art.  Creative menu and large portions. The tempura and dumplings were great. Surprisingly tho, the bbq wasn't  so good - the beef was so thick and fatty all my bites ended up in my napkin (the first round came out so over cooked already that it was burned and we asked for a new batch); and the chicken was just ok.  I'd come back, however, and try other menu offerings, there's a lot to choose from.",

Make sure you make reservations in advance as they do stick to them and don't allow many walk-ins on busy nights...we tried lol. If you have the MyVEGAS app, get the free appetizer added to your account to redeem here as the bill will quickly add up. We paid roughly $100 for two people with apps, entrees, and drinks.

Hawaiian rolls were a nice touch - sweet, salty, and came out piping hot. Plus, throwback theme gave me flashbacks to my own childhood. Will definitely come back!",

    "text": "This place is FRESH! The outside of the restaurant makes you feel like you're in a neighborhood and you forget where you are. You see people standing out like there at the corner store. As you enter you get the feeling you're going into a Korean grocery store located in Korean Town. Then once you're in you realize the store front area is a bar. Within the bar area you realize your surrounded by pictures that represent food, culture, people, and the evolution of LA with a Vegas twist. Some might not even realize to the left of the entry way there's a fringe curtain which is a tunnel to the rest of the restaurant. Which I won't spoil the rest for you. This side is mainly entered by reservation unless you get lucky. The food was amazing we got the chego pork belly bowl, spicy pork, fries and the sundae for two. This is a place worth going to. You might even want to bring your best friends. It's a experience worth sharing.",

Food came out on time and relatively fast considering how packed it was. The kimchi bbq tacos were outstanding. These were far the tasty tacos we've had in a long time. It nice having a great place to have tacos on the strip. Price was fairly reasonable for what we ordered. Highlight that night... Roy was there that night, seemed like a nice guy( he didn't come by our table). He talked to a few patrons then went back to cook.  Overall a great time!",

    "text": "I liked this place. Always funky fresh vibe melds LA and Vegas and the late 90s. The ceiling was a little weird with fake plants hanging, but overall, I liked the style, especially the old school velvety chairs. The entrance was fun, bodega style. Bar area was a little cramped.You can order take out and eat in the entrance area, but I wouldn't with everyone walking around to check out the store.  Waiter was super upbeat and friendly. Roy was walking around chatting - probably with VIPs and taking selfies with people.  The food: we (2) ordered chicken wings, dumplings, cold noodles, kimchi fried rice, and elotes. The wings were dlish. Spicy gochujang sauce. Yum... Dumplings were ok but after the strong flavor of the wings, the flavors may have been missed. Cold noodles / kimchi fried rice --- I would probably order one and not both next time. Very similar flavors. I expected - my fault - naengmyeon style cold noodles.  For drinks, I had Hite, which I didn't see on the menu but specifically asked about Korean beer. I prefer OB, but they didn't have it. Also, my partner wanted to get a watermelon slushie and they were out. A little surprising so soon after opening, but whatever.  Will go back again soon to try the larger format dishes. Note about pricing: surprisingly reasonable given typical Strip prices at $100 for 2. These days, you can barely get a burger, fries, and a beer for 2 for that price on the Strip and this is way beyond.  Give it a try!",

    "text": "Was looking forward to dining at this establishment.  It is one of the first main stream Korean restaurants on the Las Vegas strip however it left much disappointment.  Also with all the promotion of Chef Roy Choi coming to Vegas, thought this place would have been better then what was experienced.   The ambiance is definitely unique. It's very \"street\" and I can see a lot of LA influence.  When you walk in you enter a convenience store where they sell snacks on one side (Korean as well as other Asian snacks/ramen) and the bar on the other side. It was a bit confusing as the hostess is at a register on the snack side of the convenience store and this is where you check in for a table/reservations. The convenience store is separated from the restaurant by two red plastic shower curtains entryways that you have to walk through.  It did feel a bit disgusting to have to walk through these entryways thinking about all the people that have touched the plastic hanging down.  The dining area was neatly decorated with a 90's street feel.  We were seated at a booth. The booths were positioned a bit close to the table and there was no way to move the seating back so you weren't so close to the table area.  If you are used to Korean flavors, look elsewhere.  The food here taste more like cooks cooking Korean food without traditional ingredients but substituting them for what they had in the pantry. The food was either overly spiced, overly infused with vinegar, or overly wtf.  Many of the ordered dishes were left with food still on the plate as no one in the party wanted to touch them. The dishes we tried were Kimchi Jjiggae, Kogi short rib tacos, Spicy pork BBQ, Silken tofu with dipping sauce, Eggplant Schnitzel, slippery shrimp, Chego Pork Belly bowl, and Spicy Cold noodle. Total cost around $170.  Breakdown of the individual entrees- The good/average dishes: Spicy Pork BBQ: Only thing I would order again if I actually decided to come back (I prob won't be back). It's weird that the dish with the name \"spicy\" in it was actually the least spicy of the bunch. The flavor was good, it was mildly sweet and mildly spicy. It was cooked very well and was quite tasty. Portion size was small though as it is for most of the dishes ordered here.  Kogi Short Rib Tacos: Tacos were average however after having several bad dishes back to back, it was a relief to eat something that was edible.  The meat is a bit tough however the flavor of the whole dish was decent.  Slippery Shrimp: Decent, spicy sauce with fried shrimp. They give you a small portion and use the tiniest shrimp however. Not super impressive but one of the more edible things that we ordered.  Eggplant Schnitzel: Average. Fried eggplant over mustard sauce. Good option for any vegetarians that decide to come. Small portion.  The bad dishes: Kimchi Jjigae: All their shareable pots/stews are pretty expensive ranging from $42-$50.  The stew comes in a big pot and you also get a bowl of rice.  They are pretty stingy on their portions so the rice you get isn't that much and if you want more, you have to pay.  This is probably expected since they charge $4 per banchan (Korean side dish) whereas most Korean restaurants you get them for free.  The Kimchi Jjigae is terrible and when I say terrible, I mean it. It is extremely spicy and not in a good way. It does not taste like your typical Korean spice. It tasted like they just used too much pepper paste (gochujjang) and they bought the bottom shelf gochujjang to cook with. It had almost a chemical taste about it. Most of this dish was left on the table and unfortunate considering it was one of the more pricier items.  Spicy Cold Noodle: The Korean name of this dish is Bibim Naeng Myun. Avoid at all costs. I read a previous review before I ate at Best Friend saying they put too much vinegar. The dish is supposed to have vinegar in it so I thought maybe the reviewer wasn't aware and the vinegar wasn't to their liking.  This dish surely has too much vinegar to the point that it was inedible. 3 people tried one fork serving of  the dish and thereafter it remained untouched. Would avoid this dish at all costs.  Chego Pork Belly Bowl: \"Chego\" means Best in Korean and this was nowhere close to that. The meat was tough. Usually when you order a pork belly bowl, you get that rendered fat and tender meat. Not here... the pork belly felt more like steak where it was a bit tough and you needed to chew quite a bit.  Would definitely recommend to try a different bowl if you come here.  Silken Tofu with Dipping Sauce: Basic. Just your basic tofu you buy at the store sliced up on top of a dark sauce (soy sauce based).   Conclusion: Extreme disappointment. Small portions and pricey (usually not a problem if the food actually tasted good). Would recommend to go next door to Eataly if you wish to have a satisfactory meal.  We ended up there after since Best Friend left us unimpressed and not satisfied.",

We came to celebrate my bf's birthday but unfortunately, the service last night was pretty bad.   We ordered the spicy pork and the server put down the plate awkwardly so hot oil spilled on the couch/my bf's clothes. The waitress also put in the wrong order so it took a while to get our food and the drinks we ordered at the beginning didn't come out until the end. She was nice enough to say that she would comp one of the dishes she forgot, but it was still on the bill so I had to remind her for an adjustment. Also, I had let them know that we were celebrating a birthday on the reservation but didn't get an acknowledgement which was a bummer.  Overall, the atmosphere of the restaurant was cool. The food was ok but pretty pricey. I probably won't be coming back though because of the service.",

Our server, Christina, was a delight and had super recommendations for both food and drinks. We had come there before the big Beck show Friday night and couldn't get to desert before we had to leave. The manager, Megan (I hope I spelled your name right), said it was OK to come back after the show for dessert. The only reason we didn't is because the Beck show was five hours (if you can believe it), but we appreciate the superb service and will be back soon. We've lived here in Vegas for more than a decade and have dined at every last spot in this town, and Best Friend is among the finest we've ever patronized. My god, the kimchi fried rice was so good I wanted to curl up with it and wish the world away as I overdosed on this delicious dish.  Thank you, guys, for making us feel welcome. We'll see you all again very soon. Your food and service is surely among the finest in this city.",

When you walk in to check in at your table it's like checking out in a Korean minimart... brilliant!!!!   Once you walk in the Decour is a retro 90s and there's a live DJ playing old school beats... Add a perfect setting the waiters and bussers are wearing ADIDAS jump suites and Kango hats. The staff is amazing Roy himself walks around from table to table to greet you.   The food: everyone is screaming about the pork belly but my favorite was the BBQ SHRIMP, and KIMCHI FRIED RICE We also tried the short rib tacos, and I have to say everything was fire!   After receiving the bill my thoughts: Over all the experience, the food, and the service was worth what our bill was! (Which was not that high)   Congrats Roy Choi as a life time resident of Las Vegas I can say you are going to do well in this market!",

Like too many onions. Like they were using onions to make the plate seem fuller. They were ok. The fried rice was ok. Nothing was spectacular. I wouldn't eat here again. I would recommend different places to eat being that Vegas has so many. I actually am finding a lot of the restaurants in the big hotels are underwhelming.",

It looked like we were going to have to wait everywhere.  Getting a bit desperate, we walked into Best Friend.  After checking out the menu, we decided to go for it.  Surprise!  No wait!  We were led into this cavernous room which was about 3/4 full, and our ear drums were greeted with thundering dj house music.  I ordered the cold soba noodles with clams and mussels.  My friend had the kalbi. Well, the mussels were dried out.  What pulled the dish from the dead broth it was in was the fish roe, which gave it a little taste.  It was different but I would never order it again.  My friend liked her kalbi but it couldn't save the day.  Not even the house bread which reminded us of those sweet yummy rolls from another mother country.  Service waa great but the music was way too annoyingly loud.  Would have been okay in a club.  But we were there for food, conversation, and fun.  Definitely not the place for best friends who want to catch up without a screaming conversation.",

The servers and staff are very friendly and seem so down to earth. I really loved the whole vibe of the place. We ordered the beef kalbi, dumplings, and b&c octopus. The food was soooo good. My whole family loved it and kept saying how good the food was. Especially the beef kalbi. One of the best Korean bbq I've ever tasted hands downs! We ended with the bathtub sundae for two which was so delicious. Filled with ice cream, marshmallows , whipped cream, rice crispy treats, cotton candy and much more toppings. Over all our experience here is very good. I would recommend this place to everyone. Excellent food and service!",

We originally had a reservation for 6 at 530 and called earlier in the day to change to a party of 10, but they told us they were completely booked. When we got there, it was pretty empty and it still wasn't crowded when we left, plenty of empty tables. They could have accommodated us. The service was great, waitress was nice and they were very attentive. However, I was quite disappointed by the food. Had higher expectations. We ordered the kalbi (many pieces were burnt and the ones that weren't, the meat was chewy), spicy pork ( only 1 person in our group liked this fish) , garlic chicken (best of the 3 bbq we ordered, but nothing special), wontons (again, just ok), kimchi fried rice (not good), and the dori tang (ok). The Hawaiian sweet rolls were yummy. Overall, the food was just ok. I've had way better Korean food at other restaurants.",

They even have their own branded slot machines... get three tacos in a row for the jackpot! If only the jackpot equaled an endless supply of their fusion food & inventive kitchy drinks!!!!!  Word to the wise, don't be fooled by the seemingly lower price of this place. Vegas is crazy expensive, and this is coming from a New Yorker! With tip, the bill was $100 -- 1 watermelon sesame tequila cocktail, 1 ginger whiskey slushie, korean tex mex tacos, siracha fried rice, and prickly pear dragonfruit bingsoo. Yum yum!   The best way I can describe the food is that the tacos tasted like sex in my mouth. I loved this place so much I'm coming back on my birthday!!!!",

SHRIMP is a must is also very spicy get rice with it.  UNI rice is a must but was also too spicy but wasn't suppose to be that spicy so we did say something.  MEDJOOL DATE dessert is a MUST!  Trust me.   This was more than enough for me and my husband.   We got drinks too michelada was on point. Pina colada they added passion fruit so it was too tart for me but if you like strong drinks.

    "text": "GOOD VIBES.  Maybe it was the combination of the dope DJ and the laid back menu that makes Best Friend your best friend. This place just puts you in a good mood. It feels like you've been transported to a hip block party. How fun is that? The playlist and the city decor really gets you in the mood to devour those Korean tacos (and an alcoholic slush!). From walking in through the convenience store through a speakeasy like entrance to the real street art and photos of the palm trees on the wall, this place gets five stars.   Okay, so five stars for the overall atmosphere but when the food came this is when the magic disappeared. Our table ordered the Korean wings, kimchi fried rice, kalbi, and the slippery shrimp. There were tons of things on the menu we wanted but decided on these dishes for this visit.   First off, that table bread was crack. Seriously. So good. Not sure what it was exactly, it sort of a sweet bread but not a King's Hawaiian roll but has the density of a Filipino pandesal. Whatever it is, it was the best thing I ate the whole night.   Korean wings-- Delicious! The sauce was unique. I wish the wings were crispy though. I love me some crispy kwings!  Kimchi fried rice-- It didn't come hot as I would have liked. The raw egg just kind of sat there and it didn't cook all the way despite coming on a hot pan. The overall flavor was rich and overly seasoned.  Kalbi-- Korean short rib. You can't go wrong with this. This was probably the safest thing to order. It was just like ordering Kalbi at a your favorite KBBQ spot.   Slippery shrimp-- I really wanted to like this dish. Like really REALLY wanted to love this. This was something that I saw on Yelp and knew that I had to order. It was just too much sauce, so little shrimp and the flavor was tiring. After two bites I was over it.   The slippery shrimp and the kalbi should have come with white rice or some sort of greens to bring down all of the overwhelming flavors. Maybe an order of fries or something would have helped with the heavy flavors. Talk about food coma.   Overall, Best Friend has a cool vibe and I will be back again. I am a huge fan of Roy Choi and I love how he's been changing the food game since his Kogi trucks, Commissary at the Line, and Locol in Watts. The food was lacking in certain areas (a solid 3 stars from me) but that also could be my high expectations for a Roy Choi establishment. The fun vibe of this place is a solid 5 stars. But it's never good when the complimentary table bread steals the show. Definitely going to go back and give it another shot but maybe this time I'll stick with my trusty Korean tacos!",

My husband and I were staying there for the Lady Gaga concert to avoid having to walk along the strip in mid summer heat to attend the concert. We didn't make any reservations for Dining prior to the concert. We walked around the Park MGM until we found a spot with seating available. To our surprise, we were able to score some seating here and the bar area. That was perfect considering we wanted some quick food and drinks prior to attending the concert.   Our bartender/server was exceptionally friendly and walked us through the menu making recommendations based on his favorites and popular dishes. The Korean inspired menu was right up our alley. We got some potstickers and Korean tacos as an appetizer and shared a chicken entree. All of the dishes were fantastically seasoned and weren't too heavy. We had plenty of vodka sodas, which brought our bill up quite a bit. It was worth it though. For a nice meal and good ambiance, I'd definitely come back again on my next Vegas trip.",

Slightly spicy and vinegary in-house made kimchi combined with sticky rice paired perfectly as a side with our tacos. Next time I would probably ask them for it to be a little crispier.   The Banchan... oh man the banchan... I was excited to try the in-house made kimchi, but the cucumbers, wow! The cucumbers were probably my favourite thing that we ordered, I enjoyed them so much I took an order of them to go. Do yourself a favour and order the cucumbers!!!   Service was great, the vibe was chill, all around a good time! I'm looking forward to coming back the next time I'm in town.",

The hostess escorted us through see-through red strip curtains into the main dining room.   The music was poppin. The decor was somehow hip-hop AND hipster AND plant daddy. As we wove through the crowded space I couldn't help having a dance in my step cause playlist is IT.   I had the Veggie Rice Bowl which is pretty much what is served at Chego! in LA.  Still jammin. The strawberry mango daiquiri was the perfect start to my Vegas stay; as it was refreshing, tart, sweet, and strong.   It is most definitely a place I'll be back to.",

    "text": "The hubs and I wanted to try Best Friend during our last trip to Vegas. As soon as you step into the restaurant, you're transported to a different place - one minute, you're standing in a Vegas casino, another minute, you're standing in the middle of your neighborhood liquor store. The walls are plastered with posters and soju ads that screams old-school K-town nostalgia, and as two people who grew up in K-town, it really took the hubs and me back. Once your table is ready, the host/hostess will take you to through a pair of plastic curtains into the dining area.   The dining area is large with tables sprawled everywhere. The design is very modern, but there's an eclectic mix of atmospheres and feels depending on where you sit. I especially loved the wall of s (large Korean clay pots).  The hubs ordered the kimchi fried rice, I got the uni bowl, and we shared an order of carnita and kogi tacos.  The meal started with a warmed Hawaiian Roll brushed with butter and sprinkled with salt for each of us. It was heavenly.  I wish I could say I LOVED the uni bowl... but it was so heavily drenched in the dynamite sauce, and the sauce was so tart, that it completely over-powered EVERYTHING in the bowl. To be fair, the pieces of uni they used in the dish were plump and delicious, but overall, the dish was a disappointment.  When the kimchi fried rice came out, I was expecting another disappointment. Instead of a vibrant red, the rice actually looked rather flavorless and dry. But this was a classic lesson in why you shouldn't judge a book by its cover. Despite its bland appearance, each bite packed great kimchi flavor, and the texture of the rice was on point.   The kogi and carnitas tacos were delicious as well, but the hubs and I kept going back for the kimchi fried rice.  Get the kimchi fried rice.",

Bomb ass Kogi truck Korean fusion.    True story. As we were walking in there was this douchy guy walking out he put his hand to his mouth as if to tell us a secret and with his southern accent said, out loud, \"don't order too much... food ain't that good... know what I'm sayin\". The hostess looked at him and gave him a rightly deserved  what-the-fuck stink eye.  So much is right about this place. I mean, the kimchi fried rice could have had more kick but the flavor was delicious. The kalbi was tender and bbq chicken was something to stand in line for.

Dining can be offered there. Hostess stand is the makeshift cashier stand.   Once you enter into the main dining room you are imported into a lively street art kind of atmosphere. The menu has nostalgic photos of Roy Choi and calling out army Asian pastime..we ALL took those photo studio group photos back in the day.   Ok so food we chose the $50 set menu and I thought we were going to be just context BUT no we were so full. I think cause I go to local cheap cheap spots sometimes I didn't want this to be a tourist trap but no pretty cool. Shrimp was Spiiiiicy so tread carefully. My favorites are the garlic chicken and bulgogi paired with that oh so amazing Kimchi fried rice. Oh and the dang bread. Other items that were also tasty was the taco and date cake but I just kept eating that rice!   I didn't care for my drink. I had this watermelon tequila drink. Sounded a little light and refreshing but it was a little strong and sweet for what I imagined.   The wait staff was super cool and chill. Active throughout the whole evening and just letting us have a good girls night. I would absolutely do this again with the same experience with a group of friends.",

But this review isn't about that. This review is about his new spot in Las Vegas!   I went crazy and ordered everything possible! Kimchi fried rice, all the banchan, kalbi and of course-kimchi jiggae. I'm so hungry right now and all i Can think about is that kimchi fried rice. I could eat that daily! Sooooo bomblicious!   And the decor? Where do i begin? Check out my pictures and make sure you head to Best Friend w your bestie and order it up! You won't be disappointed!",

    "text": "\"My best friend is Roy Choi,\" so says the neon sign outside of Best Friend at the ParK MGM.  Since I was with my actual besties, we decided to have our last meal of our girls trip in Vegas here (plus, it was the only time we could get a reservation LOL)!  Normally I do my research on Yelp before eating at a new restaurant, but I went in somewhat blind, only going by Roy Choi's street cred as the founding father of Kogi (first food truck in L.A. serving Korean tacos) and from what my friend recommended after watching \" The Chef Show.\"  When you first walk in, it looks like some kind of brightly lit Asian mini mart/ dive bar/ diner/ souvenir shop.  It's colorful and lively and just a bit overwhelming trying to look at everything.  The welcoming hostess then took us in the back, past the heavy plastic divider panels (that you might find going to the warehouse of a grocery store), and we were instantly transported to a very dimly lit, trendy, cool, urban restaurant with awesome old school hip hop and R&B being spun by a live DJ.  \"L.A. street chic\" is the best way I can describe the vibe and the atmosphere.  All the servers wear Adidas track suits and the food runners/bussers wear white tees, khakis, and baseball caps to the back.  The art, furniture, and decor is a mix of religion and music, modern and vintage, Asian and Latino, and elegance and urban.  It all works together to create an authentic Roy Choi and Las Vegas dining experience.  That being said, expect to pay Vegas prices for classic Asian-inspired dishes that can be found on the menus of most Korean BBQ restaurants or on a trendy taco truck for a lot less.  But the food was delicous!  The four of us decided on the family-style set menu of \"A\" side ($50/pp) and the ribeye plate ($52), served a la carte.  Included in the set menu was Kogi's signature Korean tacos, spicy pork, garlic chicken, kimchi fried rice, slippery shrimp, banchan (4), and a dessert of ice cream and cake.  Our server brought us out the housemade warm Hawaiian rolls to start off with.  It was a lot of food, people!  But not only that, after the last entree came, our server let us know that if we wanted more of any of the dishes (with the exception of the tacos), to just let them know.  What?  I didn't realize it was basically an AYCE!  That made the price worth it!  My favorite was the ribeye steak, melt-in-your-mouth tender and seasoned well, served over a bed of onions, and the \"slippery shrimp,\" crispy and served in a rich sauce, it was quite addictive.  My only gripe was that we asked for more of the kimchi fried rice and our server came back 15 minutes later saying they ran out!  So we just had white rice which actually tasted better with all of the grilled meats.  The date cake was super moist and not too sweet, balancing out the rich and creamy caramel ice cream and whipped cream.    All of the staff were genuinely friendly and helpful, laidback and sociable, adding to the positive, fun, and cool ambiance.  Cheers to good food and best friends!",

There are set menus but our waitress says they have an option where the chef chooses what we get and would feed us better, we felt adventurous so we opted for that at $65 a person.   Great music - 90's R&B and hip hop until they switched djs and it ended up.. different.   Service was a 5 star - bubbly and eager to help with any questions, the food came out with great suggestions and waters were always filled.

Had I not known it was Roy Choi's place, I wouldn't have stepped in here. Not sure why, but I just don't particularly enjoy the old retro vibe you get here. The bar area is decked out with tons of visual noise. Stickers everywhere. Convenience store look with tons of Asian inspired snacks on the shelves. I thought that was all there was to it. Service was a little lacking in that the hostesses didn't seem to want to seat me? I just went up to the bar and the guy whose name I want to say is eliott? maybe he just reminds me of my BEST FRIEND's boyfriend hahahahha. Asian guy with glasses wearing an oversized pink ROY CHOI IS MY BEST FRIEND t shirt. He takes my order... I asked if there was a back because people seemed to be coming out. there was! It was popping in the back, fancy decor with murals of LA. Preferred dining in the back much MUCH more. No glaring glow of pink neon lights attacking your eyes.  Anyways, I ordered the Uni dynamite. It had 2-3 pieces uni on top of a bed of hot Yuzu rice sprinkled with toasted seaweed, sesame, and daikon sprouts?  I loved this dish, I was so surprised. It has crunchy bits where the rice got a bit over toasted? Or maybe there was something else in it. The rice is spicy and has a nice kick to it and the creamy, cold uni cuts through it and adds that savoryness that you crave. The tartness of the yuzu, spicyness, crunchy bits, savory seaweed, creamy, and cold sensations and flavors all blend so well together in this dish. It's not cheap sitting at $22 for something the size of a pizookie at BJ's but I think it's worth it.  The dumpling sliders were interesting and I didn't like them at first but they grew on me. It was sweet and I could taste dumpling filling instead of the typical hamburger patty. It's got like. Plumb seasoning or something on it. Some yuzu? Like bulgolgi? Every bite tasted different. I wouldn't get it again but it was interesting to try. The fries with ramen seasoning was amazing. for $10 not a bad deal especially in vegas.   I was surprised that these two dishes were enough to fill me up. The two bartenders were friendly enough and made nice conversation. Food came pretty quickly and service was good. Maybe because I was the only one seated at the bar? Hostesses suck though. No one gave me a history of the place or talked about the concept.  Oh yeah. After 10pm they switch to their late night menu. lameeee. I didn't get to see or order from their full menu. might have to come back...",

The watermelon tequila cocktail was disgusting though, could not finish it.  The chicken wings and the slippery shrimp were my faves, and the chego bowl was great as well. I would pass on the Dori Tang, the legit Korean version is much better. Still had an amazing experience, and I'd be happy to return.",

    "text": "Now I'm out here looking like revenge Feelin' like a ten, the best I ever been And yeah, I know how bad it must hurt To see me like this, but it gets worse at..BEST FRIEND! - Demi Lovato (sorry not sorry)  Full disclosure: I had Kogi tacos from their food truck in LA when they first started before Roy Choi was a household name - I was not impressed at all and haven't had his food until now.  Enter Best Friend. In addition to the positive reviews, they have a Chef's menu that's only $50 a person for dinner (Vegas standards) for a ton of food so I was ready to give it another shot. I appreciate the story: the convenience store front into the restaurant with a Vegas vibe and club music to back it up, the menu with pictures of him and his childhood friends - seems like he put his life story in this restaurant and wants to share it with the world - good for him.  Enter the Chef's menu. A. Kogi short rib tacos - wow much better than I had 10+ years ago - expectations going up for the rest of the meal B. Chili shrimp - basically walnut shrimp but with chili mayo - very tasty and a bit of a spicy kick - something I've never had before - off to a very good start.. -------------------------------------------- These lines represent the amount of time it took for the next dish to come out. They came out blazing and then almost 20 mins of a lull time AFTER we had finished the first two dishes (so like 35 mins total) -- everyone knows that the food is going to start settling and you're going to start feeling full if you don't have food coming out at a reasonable time. This isn't a french restaurant..its just meat coming out next.. the server offered more bonchon and we said sure but it never came..cool.. C. chicken + pork - honestly the chicken was super dry and I'm not even sure what sauce was on it - the spicy pork was a bit better but it felt like the food sat on the line for a while and just didn't make its way out to us in a timely manner -- we ate less than half and didn't even want to take it to go (first its Vegas and second I wouldn't have wanted to take it even if I was going home) D. kimchi fried rice - it wasn't bad but I probably would've enjoyed it more if I wasn't full from the waiting and getting impatient with the excuses coming from the server who blamed it on the kitchen (they both deserve blame for this)  E. dessert cake with ice cream - wasn't too sweet which is nice and the  best thing we had all night next to the shrimp and tacos / although again it took them a while for it to come out even after they kept apologizing for the timing of the previous dishes..sigh there's communication issues going on for sure - it wasn't due to a \"busy kitchen\" because when we were there, it was maybe half full  I would say to not eat here if you have a show to get to (plan 2.5 hours before the show if you really want to eat here lol or eat after since they are open late) - the speed of the food coming out was super inconsistent and this was when they were half full..imagine what it would be like during prime dinner hours when its packed. My impression of the Kogi tacos however has been restored so yay!   2.5 stars overall -- lots of food for the cost and tacos were delicious - the story of the restaurant is touching and feels real - the disconnect between the servers and the kitchen was clearly showing and they didn't do anything to rectify the situation other than a seemingly unauthentic apology. I do appreciate the front of the house person coming by the tables asking how our meal was so props to her at least for doing that. Saving grace for them is that it is Vegas so there will be no shortage of people coming to try - retention rate might be a difficult ask though from my experience.",

    "text": "The best way I can sum up this amazing meal is to say this: I had the same excitement and expectations for both David Chang's Majordomo in LA & Roy Choi's Best Friend in Vegas- where Majordomo let me down, Best Friend went above and beyond!  Located in the Park MGM, Best Friend is a loud, bright, fun homage to late 80's/early 90's LA life. I loved taking the time to really notice all of the small details and deco that make this restaurant so special- from retro stickers and candy to kimchi pots arranged on a wall, every detail has a meaning.  Service from the hostess was so-so but our server was great! Super friendly and helpful while guiding us through the menu. We ordered Kogi Short Rib Tacos, Kimchi Fried Rice, Uni Dynamite Fried Rice, & Korean Chicken Wings.  So the thing about Best Friend is that they take dishes that are inherently Korean or very \"LA\" and elevate them to a level that's out of this world! At first glance, my husband was super annoyed to be paying $19 for Kimchi Fried Rice- a dish you associate with leftovers from your Korean mom's kitchen. But as soon as you taste Roy's, you realize you are eating something very, very special. The harmony of unexpected, new, unfamiliar flavors in a childhood staple is genius!  It's more than simple Korean \"fusion\"- Choi takes these dishes and re-invents then in a way that honors their roots and elevates them with the addition of new ingredients and flavor profiles.   The first starter of buttery Hawaiian Rolls come out~ its a good harbinger of the dishes to come: it's a classic staple with a fresh twist. We've had the Kogi tacos in LA, and they didn't disappoint! The Korean chicken wings were perfectly cooked and crispy with a fresh new taste. The Kimchi Fried Rice topped with a perfectly cooked egg was savory and delicious.  But the star of the evening was the Uni Dynamite Fried Rice~ AMAZING!!! I literally dream of that dish~ it was THAT good! I can't recall the last time I've wanted to lick the bottom of a fish clean until I had this (lol)!!! Don't come here without trying it!  We were just so impressed with the meal, everything from service to ambiance to music to food! We questioned whether or not people who were unfamiliar with Korean dishes would appreciate just how delicious Roy's are, but from the reactions of our fellow diners and Yelpers it seems like people loved Best Friend as much as we did! DEFINITELY stop by if you're in Vegas~ you'll be glad you did!",

    "text": "Hello Yelpers, it's been a while. But this fat kid came out of hibernation to give you some very important information for the newly opened Best Friend.   Everything was on point. The food. The music. The service. But, do not, I repeat DO NOT order multiple delicious dishes and a pot if you are two people.   Everything is meant to be shared, and share we did....  We started with the wings, which were my least favorite dish of the night. I'm more a BonChon fan, sorry Roy. Then came the slippery shrimp and the short rib tacos. The slippery shrimp was the best! The tacos were delicious too.   So just about when I'm getting full, we had one last dish coming. The Dori Tang... I LOVE dori tang, and it's almost impossible to find anywhere.   When it came out, it was a huge cast iron pan, the giant one you make meals for 6-8 in (plus it came with rice). I literally exclaimed holy shit when she brought it out.   For the price and for it being a shared plate place we expected it to be less than half the quantity of what it was. Holy god, that thing should come with a warning, don't order unless you're a part of 6 or only plan to eat this. We made the smallest dent in it and called it a night. But it was effing delicious.   Speaking of prices, they were super reasonable, especially for Vegas. At Catch I think it would have cost twice as much for half the food.   I expected there to be a few hiccups with it being open only a few days, but not a hiccup to be found other than me not realizing the hostess was where I thought you buy the souvenirs.",

    "text": "Amazing addition to Vegas and my personal favorite of all of his restaurants (although I still miss the commissary). Went over opening weekend and loved the vibe. From the decor, servers in Adidas tracksuits, DJ with all the best /80s/90s hits, the photos of what looked like my youth splattered over the menus- everything was thoughtfully executed.   Slippery Shrimp- everyone is raving but it left me unimpressed. The shrimps were tiny, not battered correctly and left super soggy, which really ruined the texture of what slippery shrimp is known for. My least favorite dish of the night.   Kimchi Fried Rice- while I appreciated the fact that it's a vegetarian dish, personally didn't love because the kimchi wasn't aged enough. Everyone knows the stinkiest kimchi is what makes the fried rice great. However there was an overall charred smokiness to the rice that had me going back for more.   Short rib tacos- perfection like always. Much bigger portions than the food trucks. Comes 3 to an order but you can always add an extra taco.   Spicy Pork BBQ- Perfection. Wouldn't change a thing.   Tamarind Black Cod Stew- you can order the large pots in half orders so don't be afraid! Spectacular dish and full of flavor. Tangy sauce with perfectly cooked cod. There are a lot of fish bones in this so beware, but a really special dish.   Bingsu- chef does magic by foaming up the condensed milk and this dish rivals bingsu in Korea for me. Prickly pear sorbet with dragon fruit and a light dew of foamy condensed milk over shaved ice.   Date Cake- sounds like a strange choice but it was phenomenal. Moist but not too sweet with a salted caramel ice cream and graham cracker crumble.   Last thing- don't be weary of the 80s drinks. Got a midori sour and fuzzy navel and these are nothing like what you've had before. Fresh juices make them inventive so give them a try!",

Just looking through the menu will bring you back to your high school days and photo mania group sessions. The servers wear adidas track suits! I came for dinner prior to going to an event at the arena. The service throughout the night was great and we barely had any wait, which is rare esp. at busy restaurants on the strip. To start off, your table will get honey hawaiian rolls-which is nothing special, but the rest of the food is bomb. We had ordered the Slippery Shrimp- this has a great kick to it, Kalbi ribs, and Uni dynamite rice- this was my favorite!. The portions are enough to share and prices... are Strip prices hahaha! Don't forget to get the Coke/Hennessy slush in a to-go cup so you can finish it outside. Go grab your best friend to eat at BF.",

    "text": "I had a chance to check out Best Friend recently on my last trip to Las Vegas and I have to say it was a great time. I ended up learning about the Restaurant on YouTube when Timothy DeLaGhetto interviewed Roy Choi inside the restaurant thought the concept sounded cool so I had to give it a try when I got into town. I have to say I was disappointed at all the whole concept and 90's vibe and aesthetic was great and very different from anything you normally see in a restaurant. The staff was friendly and helpful, the food was solid, and just an overall great experience all together. When you go somewhere like Las Vegas you are looking to have experiences you can go it anywhere but Best Friend give you a special chill, fun experience plus good food can't beat that.  So my wife and I weren't super familiar with Korean BBQ so we sampled a few dishes that caught our eye we started off with the Korean Wings and the Slippery Shrimp which both were amazing and really set the meal off on a good note thanks to our waiter for suggesting the Shrimp. Next we both order a plate of the Kogi Short Rib Tacos which were mind blowing so much flavor packed into those tacos it was crazy. Then lastly we tried the Garlic Chicken which was really good as well, all the portions where a good side had plenty of food to take back to the hotel for later and left more than satisfied. The retro 90's music was great and all the throwback details down to the wait staff wearing the Adidas-style jump suits from back in the day was just cool and great attention to detail for someone like myself that grew up in that era.  In closing I would have to highly recommend Best Friend if you are looking to have a memorable experience with great food in a great environment, next time you visit Vegas I bet you won't regret it.",

The restaurant itself had an old school hip hop vibe and live DJ while we were there on a Saturday night.  Ordered the Chego Pork Belly Bowl and the Fries. All meals are served with salted buttered Hawaiian rolls. Chego Pork Belly Bowl- absolutely incredible braised pork belly with crispy edges, served over rice sauced with a spicy savory sauce and topped with crushed peanuts, a fried egg and roasted broccolinni. Easily one of the best things I've ever eaten.  Fries- delicious wedge cut fries that we're crispy outside and soft inside and well seasoned with ramen packet seasoning. Served with spicy mayo and overall was a flavor punch. I love salt so this was great for me! Overall the restaurant was an experience in itself from the decor to the amazing food. Definitely worth checking out!!  Also got a chance to meet Roy Choi himself who explained that the Chego Bowl is originally from one of his restaurants in LA Chinatown. Can't wait to go get it there!",

We ended up walking over from a free to park hotel and I really enjoyed the entire experience. Service was great and prompt, ambiance was lively and laid back and food was pretty good and priced well.   We had a show to go to and had only one hour to make this dinner happen. I asked a friend what they ordered and apparently they ordered all the wrong things so be sure you look at the pictures before arriving. Everything came out quickly and simply put was- a great experience. They brought out complimentary hawaiian sweet rolls to start. We ordered the short rib tacos and as presented they were great but personally had too much of both sauces and they drowned out the flavor of the ribs. The sambal fries were a gigantic portion and the dipping sauce was phenomenal. My friend enjoyed it thoroughly.  We also ordered the garlic chicken and while jidori chicken thighs tend to be juicier and more tender these were a bit on the tougher side or just cooked really well done. I thought theyd have a bit more of a garlic punch to them but it kind of fell flat. Also the onions came out more on the raw side instead of grilled or sauteed. Either way it was a nice dish to experience. We ended the meal with the strawberry cheesecake. It was really well presented with a melting strawberry mousse, strawberry sorbet and also the cheesecake. Overall, it lacked the punch of a well crafted cheesecake. It wasnt creamy,  tart, or smooth. Just kind of bleh.  It may seem like I didnt enjoy it but taken as presented we had a great time. The music, price point and service made up for the personal food preferences.   Would I go back? Sure!",

I do love the decor and concept of the restaurant- very old school LA vibe with the DJ spinning. I love it.  But when it comes to the food...

Don't order this I can go to the store and buy cucumbers and jjang sauce for less than $7.. I was hoping they did something more with the dish but they did not). Bbq vegetables, carnitas tacos, short rib tacos, and dumplings. Short rib tacos are the only thing worth ordering... and even then the price point does not match the quality of the food. One order of tacos come with 3 small pieces and that's $12..   Normally I am not that anal about portions or price points. But the food here is so mediocre I do mind paying this much money for it. I probably won't be back.",

    "text": "Definitely surpassed everything I thought this restaurant was going to be, the whole atmosphere is definitely on a different level compared to many restaurants here in Las Vegas. The staff was very friendly and constantly asked us if we were enjoying our food, which we absolutely did!  We had to get drinks of course. I ordered myself a Mai Tai and my man ordered the Mango Slush. Both were very delicious, but be careful when you drink the Mai Tai ... definitely creeps up on you. It is so refreshing that you forget there's rum in it! We also had complimentary hawaiian rolls and a spinach type banchan which I loved! The Daikon banchan was my personal favorite!  Kalbi ribs was great and the Spicy pork was to die for! But the real winner for me was the half rack of Lamb chops we ordered! It was beyond delicious and those garlic veggies the lambs were sitting on were to flavorful.  I cannot wait to bring back my best friend so she can also experience this type of atmosphere and food! The restaurant will definitely be a hit with locals soon!",

    "text": "We decided to try this place because it is by Roy Choi who which ive been a big fan of. Now this place is a Korean inspired restaurant which combines some of the local LA foods and your typical Korean dishes. If you want straight Korean food there are much better places for Korean food.   We ended up making a reservation for 945pm and when we arrived we were advised it would be about 15 mins. Well 30 mins comes around and we still have not been seated. They advised us that they were not seating anyone due to food orders being backed up. Well after almost 40 mins we were finally  seated. Once seated we were excited to try some of the dishes we had in mind. Well the server tells us they were out of the korean wings and few other things. Well we wanted the Korean wings and were disappointed. Anyways we ended up ordering each side dishes which were $3 each(in Korean restaurants these are free and unlimited), The army soup, short ribs, corn, bbq tacos, shrimp, dumplings and few other items. I will say everything was delicious and food came out pretty quick. The army soup was my fav and served in a huge bowl which can be shared by 3 or more people and included ramen, spam, sausages, tofu and rice cakes in a spicy soup. I would give a 4 1/2 stars if I could due to the long wait even with a reservation and them being out of Korean wings. Other than that the food and service was awesome.",

    "text": "I absolutely loved my experience at Best Friend! Roy Choi does it again with a concept that pays beautiful homage to Northeast LA, a part of the city that is often neglected in pop culture. It's next to Eataly at the Park MGM, which has easily become my favorite Vegas hotel.   As for the service, we had a top notch team taking care of us. We told our waiter immediately upon getting seated that we were seeing Janet Jackson in an hour, and he told us they are used to expediting meals for exactly that purpose. And they were True to their word: all the dishes we ordered came out within 15 minutes, which was SO impressive.   As for the food, also top notch! I certainly wasn't surprised, having followed Roy's creations for a while, but still awed at how amazing everything tasted. Much of the menu is touted as an LA Koreatown experience, and it truly is in its best form! We ordered kimchi fried rice, Korean wings, uni dynamite fried rice (my personal fave!), kalbi (another fave!), spicy pork, and tamarind black cod stew.   As for the ambience, what a cool one! You first enter what looks like a Korean convenience store with snacks for sale. That's where their bar and the host station are. You walk through a small hallway into the dining room, which is adorned with hanging plants on the ceiling as a callback to Choi's Commissary in KTown. There are beautiful light box photographs of NELA on two of the walls. And the menus are probably the best touch to it all -- a yellow binder full of Choi's childhood photographs, from photo gallery poses from the mall (I used to get those all the time, too!), to prom and homecoming pictures. The music was mostly 90s hip hop, what I consider the golden age of hip hop. I grooved to it the entire time.   Best Friend is an excellent restaurant. Thank you, Roy Choi, for yet another incredible time.",

We checked in with the host and she told us we would need to sit at the tables in front of the host booth since we didn't have reservations as these tables were first come first serve. Saw a small table and my family crowded around that table for 30 mins until we were able to combine two tables. After 40 mins of sitting around and being ingnored we were finally told by our waiter that our party would have to leave the seating area because we have children in our party and the reason they gave is that kids can not sit on stools and that it would be a liability to the restaurant if they fall off the stool. I couldn't believe that the staff of 7-10 people who worked the front area would watch us struggle for 40 mins to sit down and combine two tables where our children are clearly visible and sitting on stools just to tell us that we were not welcome. (no one said anything for 30 mins as we sat at the first table with our kids) I could not believe it and neither could the other patrons in the restaurant people all around us were making comments like...\"thats messed up\" as we picked up our kids to exit the restaurant after the waiter publicly shamed us for bringing our kids.   Don't go to Best Friends if you have a kid, care about kids, or was once a kid.",

The decor and ambiance is a hodgepodge homage to the 30's, 60's, 80's and today mixed in with some alleyway Chinatown and hip LA all mixed together and somehow it works.   On to the food.  It is also fusion food LA, meets Korean BBQ while the drinks make you feel like you are in a speakeasy.  We had the elotes and they were by far the best elotes I have ever had. They were honestly my favorite item.  We had the kogi tacos they were solid, however, I have not ever been a fan of the sauce flavor, which on this point I know I am an outlier because people will drive two hours to find a Kogi truck for these tacos.  We also had the shrimp which also was a little heavy on both the mayo and sriracha for me.  We tried the hot tub sundae and it was solid taste wise but off the hook on presentation.  What really made our experience was our waiter. He was fun, attentive, and helpful.  I would definitely recommend checking this place out.  Make reservations in advance.",

The Ambiance and Setting were cool and the cocktails were great, but the food and service didn't hit all the right marks for me.  Note:  My mom ordered a Salty Dog cocktail... IT WAS FANTASTIC!  It's not a complicated drink but it was Perfect in Every Way.  I wonder if maybe it was that the Grapefruit was Fresh and perfectly ripened?  Hmmm... or the bartender is just magic.   We ordered: * Corn (Elotes) - it was ok, nothing special.  We had ordered Corn at Bobby Flay's Shark the week before and were blown away so I was un-impressed with this corn  * Eggplant Schnitzel - it was what you would expect... breaded Eggplant... but the eggplant was mushy and the sauce it was served with was too mustard-y  * Kogi Rib Taco - the tortillas were dry but the meat was fantastic.. tender, juicy, flavorful  * Pork Belly Bowl - REALLY, REALLY enjoyed this dish!  It's big enough to share, but honestly if I go again, I'm ordering this and not sharing.  The flavors were sweet, spicy, a hint of sour...and all of it with that luscious pork belly.  YUM!  * BBQ Veg - a big plate of BBQ-d veggies that was mostly onions.  * Garlic Chicken - a big plate of chicken! Good for sharing.  It was a little dry but That Sauce Was Money!  Sadly, it didn't warm up very good the next day.  That's my True test of any dish... if it's still tasty the next day then you know you have a Winner.  * White Rice - it's rice... it was made properly... not too sticky, not too dry.  The service was good, but a little lackluster IMO.  Maybe it was just an off night or maybe the servers are instructed to be a bit stand-off-ish.  I don't know... maybe it was just our guy?  Maybe he was having an off night?  Maybe we were just reading him wrong?  It just didn't feel like he cared whether we ordered anything or not, and the servers couldn't put the food down fast enough and run away.  They didn't even bother to say what they were delivering.  For all the food, plus 4 drinks our bill before tax/tip was $180.  For a strip restaurant, that's pretty average.  (P.S. I didn't take any pictures because the lighting is kinda dark inside, and I don't have a good camera.... And let's face it, I suck at taking night time food pics.)",

    "text": "After landing in Vegas & checking into our hotel, my husband and I decided to eat at Best Friend since it was inside ParkMGM where we were staying.   I was able to make a reservation on my phone before heading down & we were seated immediately.   Food: Uni Dynamite Bowl - This was a rich dish. It was good at first, but as I kept eating, the dish got sour & I wasn't sure what was causing it.   Pork Belly Bowl - My husband enjoyed this! Flavorful & filling.  Slippery Shrimp - This was delicious. It can be decadent feeling, so I would suggest eating it with rice or veggies to cut the fat.   Service:  Our servers were nice, but we didn't see much of them except for taking our order and bringing our food out. The food came out quickly though.  Side note: On Mondays, they have AYCE Korean BBQ! Unlike other ASCE kbbq places, they bring out the prepared food out for you instead of you cooking it yourself.   My husband and I didn't go with this option, maybe another time with more people.   TL;DR - I'd skip the uni bowl & try something else. Don't expect the best service.",

From the moment you walk in with the bar, decor and apparel, to the moment you then enter the actual restaurant through these red plastic draped curtains, to the DJ, to the open layout, wall art, menu layout which is in a 3 ring binder by the way....we were just blown away throughout our entire experience. I LOVED the adidas track suit uniforms of the wait staff and literally could not stop looking at all the pictures in the menu. Roy Choi's yearbook photos!! SO CUTE!  Our server Stacy was the most patient with us as our double date arrived very late. She even tried to get Roy Choi to stop by and say hi to us since we are big fans but he was there with his family. Was definitely cool to see him though and he brought us potstickers on the house!  We opted for the Prixe Fixed option B and loved every single course. It was a ton of food so you will definitely leave full. We even added street corn because we really wanted to try it. Delicious as expected. Would definitely come back for both the ambience & food!",

We ordered a variety of food and shared among 9 people and it left our stomachs empty just like our wallets. I probably would not recommend this restaurant for anyone coming to Vegas because it is not worth the hype.",

    "text": "Utter perfection...  This restaurant exceeds my usual \"must visit\" ratings. This is an ABSOLUTELY MUST VISIT while in Vegas!   Best Friend is easily a top 5 best restaurant I've ever had the pleasure of eating at!  Imagine being in Koreatown in LA. You walk past a casual Korean bbq place, pink neon signs glowing in the window. You walk inside to low tables, a casual bar, bartenders in track suits, very basic. This is the front facade of Best Friend.  Upon being greeted and checking in, here is where the fun begins...  We were greeted by a bleached blonde hostess in a 3 piece neon red suit... like, what!?   We were escorted through pink plastic curtains to a cerca 1990 LA. Absolutely beautiful and artful design. Photos of LA graffiti, low riders, LA locations. Plants hanging from the ceiling, waiters and waitresses in full neon green track suits!!!   *disclaimer, you must be in before 10pm to be serviced on the dinner menu as opposed to the late night menu*  We were sat and promptly catered to! We decided to order two of the $50 chef choice catered meal.  Being Vegas, we didn't expect much for the $50.  We were treated to complimentary Hawaiian roles topped in sea salt! Absolutely a fantastic start to the dinner!  Food came out near immediately! First plate: (normally bbq shrimp) we substituted the Korean dumplings. Slightly greasy but very savory and hearty, came with 6 for the two of us.  Next came the entree of Kimchi Fried Rice, absolutely A+, subtle crunch from the kimchi and a slight spice to the rice. Before we could even grab a scoop of the rice, the 3rd item came out: bbq chicken on a steaming metal plate!  The chicken was extremely tender, served on a hot plate with onions and subtle veggies still simmering!   Next came our traditional Korean bbq small sides of spiced broccoli, kimchi, and spicy cucumbers.  As we dusted off the kimchi fried rice... it kept coming!  We were blindsided when the track suited waiter came back with ANOTHER steaming plate, this time bbq pork on a bed of onions! Our table over flowing with plates at this point, we gladly accepted the food. Accompanying the pork came a bowl of white rice.  The pork was tender, near melt in your mouth with a nice char flavor from the bbq!  Another plate! Out came the Korean tacos with a bbq beef as the meat... utterly fantastic!  We slowly grinded to a halt, stuffed to the brim.   Think about it, how often are you ever stuffed to the brim on $50 in Vegas? That's nearly unheard of!  Hoping to be greeted by the bill, it wasn't over. Mercifully our dessert came rolling out. A strawberry cheesecake with strawberry sherbet. A perfect sweet \"cherry on top\" to a killer good Korean BBQ meal!  I have rarely been this satisfied with a meal, or utterly saying \"wow\" out loud to the presentation or flavor of meals.  You HAVE to visit this restaurant while in Vegas! If you are a fan of bbq, this is absolutely your spot! Definitely one of the more affordable sit down options in Las Vegas and the atmosphere is next to none!",

Enticing was our dinner of buttery \"Hawaiian Rolls; crispy \"Korean Fried Chicken\";  flavorful \"Kimchi Fried Rice\"; and, super juicy \"Spicy Pork Tacos\".  Incredible, informative, and efficient also was our server.  A lasting dope impression this restaurant made.  Am already looking forward with my dinner here next in trying even more tantalizing dishes.  CHEERS!",

Being close to LA is ironic I've ever tried one of his spots until now.  When the Monte Carlo became the park MGM i was most excited about trying Best Friend.    Best Friend is an experience to be had.  You first walk into a what looks like a liquor store, which is the restaurants sports bar area.  The shelves are stocked with items that you would find in a mini mart and there is even merchandise that you can buy.  As you wait to be seated you go through a red partition and it's like you're being transported to LA, Roy Choi grew up in.  The dinning area is darkly let and there are TV's showing familiar sights of LA there is even booming music featuring west coast rap.  The decor was nice, during our time there many guest were taking pictures of the decor, because it is so cool The LA theme in there is so nice it made me want to put on an LA Dodgers fitted cap.    Their are a lot of options for food and price points too.  I think the Vegas menu buy for is the most expensive, but the LA menu has some favorites I believe are from some of Roy Choi's other spots.  The Menu I went with is the LA menu.  We got the Kogi tacos (of course!) and some spicy shrimp with a side of rice.  Both items were excellent the shrimp was very flavorful and had a unique taste and the tacos were what I expected too as a great example of fusion tacos.    This place right here is probably the best reason for you to come to Park MGM if you are visiting.  The experience and the food were both equally amazing, if you're looking for experience or place to take a group of people for dinner Best Friend does not disappoint.",

Food 3/5: All of the savory dishes that I sampled were heavily spiced and overly salty. I tried the Chego Pork Belly bowl, Slippery Shrimp, Silken Tofu and the Bingsu for dessert. My favorite was the Bingsu.   Atmosphere/Vibe 5/5: I loved the atmosphere inside the restaurant. It was modern with an urban street aesthetic. The candle-lit tables and lighting were dark overall, but the servers wearing bright Adidas jumpsuits was a neat contrast. The couch/cushion chairs were very comfortable.   Price 3/5: It wasn't overpriced, but the pricing was on the higher end. We had a party of three and spent $75 which did not include any drinks.   Service 5/5: Servers were attentive and friendly.   Tips: Don't expect to take decent Instagram shots here. It's very dark.",

She had even read back the reservation to me and it was correct. Not sure how the info changed so much by the time it reached the restaurant - ??  Also just be sure that you know this place is location is not at MGM - So don't park at MGM otherwise it's going to seem like a 2 mile hike to get to Park MGM!

If you do one of the pre fixed for $50 you get his famous specialties! Short rib tacos, slippery shrimp, kimchi fried rice, beef bulgogi, garlic chicken, buchon, date cake! All the food is on the spicier side, so keep the order of homemade Hawaiian rolls coming! All food is served family style! Very casual vibe!",

Each time I was never disappointed. I usually sat at the bar. It is a cool vibe inside and the bartenders were awesome! Good service and the food came pretty quick. Every time I ate here I got the cucumbers because they were so refreshing with a little spice to it. I would have to say my favorite dishes were the clams, tacos and kimchi fried rice (seen in pictures).   If you are ever in Vegas this is a MUST TRY!! You will not be disappointed. When I go back, I will try out more menu items!",

    "text": "When LA goes to LV! Roy Choi combines all his LA spots and mixes in some LV flare.   Located in Park MGM right next to Eataly.   Reservations were easy to get the week of for a weekend dinner. It did not look busy from the outside but it was pretty packed inside.  There is an outer inside bar seating area and a inside restaurant seating area.   Service was good. Food comes out really fast. Prices are inflated for LV.   Good Day Soju - $25 - Probably a 5 dollar bottle for 25 bucks!  Hawaiian Rolls - Complementary - King's Hawaiian but fresh and way better.  Kimchi - $4 - Flavorful with mild heat. Small ban chan style dish. Broccoli - $4 - Crispy broccoli. Good dish to cut the heavy food.  Street Corn - $10 - Elotes but cut off the cob. Slippery Shrimp - $18 - Spicy version of the walnut shrimp dish. I liked the heat. Kogi Short Rib Tacos - $15 - If you had the truck, you know they are bomb. You get 3, can add additional tacos for 5 bucks each. I do not think the truck even charges this much for a taco though.  Korean Wings - $15 - Crispy batter. Light heat in the sauce. One of my favorites from the meal. Kimchi Fried Rice - $15 - Tastes like the name, kimchi mixed with fried rice. Small bowl for the price.  Garlic Chicken - $24 - Worst dish we had. Chicken was like fast food teriyaki chicken with less flavor.  Prices here are a lot more then you pay at his LA joints but still had a good overall meal.",

We ate the deconstructed strawberry cheesecake before I could get a pic   The service is great. They explain how everything works and make great suggestions.

The spicy pork is a great shareable dish with a side of rice.  The veggie Tempura is huge and well executed.

The decor was nice the food was very good but it fell apart at service. Our server, Danny was very nice but forgot my father's beverage. He wasn't sure what my sister in law ordered, she clarified and when the food came out hers was still wrong. Then we sat there with our dirty plates just waiting for someone, anyone to clear them away. Someone who looked like a manager passed by us over 5 times and never did a thing, what are you managing? I think the server bailed on us after making a mistake on the order, come on really? When he finally did show up again, \"you want the check?\" Well I was going to have dessert, but now I won't. He left again never took even a plate with him, and there we sat with dirty dishes in  a restaurant that wasn't half full. To add insult to injury when he did finally show with the check we were charged the wrong price on the banchan and charged for the mistaken item. I thought you were my best friend :(",

We found this place when we were in Vegas last month and now visiting again I had to take my mom for late night Kolgi tacos. They're just too good with tender meat and the spices plus the slaw - it's the perfect late night (or any time) bite. On my previous visit we had the kimchi fried rice which is perfection, spicy kimchi fried rice wth a buttery sunny side egg on top plus the salty seaweed mmmm! The prices aren't bad, it's inside the Park MGM but only open til midnight so make sure to squeeze this spot in, it's so worth it! Round out your trip here with a Jameson and ginger slush and you'll be on your way to a great night!",

My boyfriend and I had one of the course set meals, and it was great because it offered a little bit of everything on the menu, with plenty extra. The kalbi was probably some of the best kalbi in vegas and the kimchi fried rice is a must. This place is definitely a good place to go for Korean fusion food especially if you want to go somewhere nice with someone on the strip that's worth the money!",

We almost didn't get to eat here, but a last minute cancellation saved us  We had: Korean ribs Spicy pork Street corn Cucumbers with some kind of spicy dip  Pros: Service was excellent  The bread they start you with is GOOD DJ spins amazing late 90's-early 2000s bangers Food was on point The frozen Hennessy/coke slushy may have been one of the best things I've ever had  Cons: A bit pricey (but hey, it's Vegas) The Korean Ribs were just a little bland (but still delicious)  Would 100% come back here",

    "text": "I haven't set foot in a Roy Choi restaurant since A-frame, which was nearly 5 years ago. I was excited that he decided to open up an LA-inspired restaurant in Vegas. The concept is a throw-back to the 90's and brings back some nostalgic vibes down to the menu, which features some high school dance photos. We've all done those poses with the hair. The feel of the interior is very LA. Also I love the front bar, which is reminiscent of the pawn shop at Beauty & Essex.  We came the day after the grand opening and this place was packed. If you were to dine here, come with 4-6 people because the menu is made for family-style dining. It was a little disappointing to see that the side dishes were $3 when they could be found to be complimentary at any KBBQ place around town, but hey, it's in an MGM property and money is to be made. The menu is broken down by dish size starting with a few appetizers, rice bowls, BBQ, LA-inspired plates, large shared pots, and finally large format plates.  We started with the Korean wings with chili, citrus, and lychee ($12) which come with 4-6 wings. The wings are small, but pack a big flavor punch. I was a fan and liked these a lot. For bowls, we went with the uni dynamite rice ($17) and the chego pork belly bowl ($15). The uni dynamite rice was my favorite and has large pieces of Santa Barbara uni covering a rice bowl with dynamite sauce that would usually cover sushi rolls, sriracha, yuzu, and sesame. The pork belly bowl had nice crunchy pieces of pork belly with a fried egg, radish, broccoli, peanuts, and cotija cheese, which was an interesting topping, but worked. Of the two, get the uni.  We decided to skip the KBBQ portion of the menu, since they seemed straight forward and did not offer anything different than what you might find at a KBBQ place. For the L.A. SH*T portion of the menu, they were all out of elotes, but we did get the slippery shrimp ($16), A-Frame OG ribs ($18), and eggplant schnitzel ($18). The slippery shrimp were a table favorite. The rock shrimp were crispy and went very well with the chili mayo and walnuts. It would've been nice if they used giant prawns like how Chinese restaurants would with their walnut shrimp dish. The A-frame OG ribs were a huge disappointment. The rib meat was the opposite of fall-off-the-bone and the hoisin-chili sauce was nothing to write home about. The eggplant schnitzel, on the other hand was nicely fried and a unique addition to the menu.  For large pots, I highly recommend the tamarind black cod stew ($44). This was quite spicy, in a good way, and large enough to share between 5 people. This was probably my favorite dish of the night. The cod was perfectly cooked and flaked right off. For large format dishes, we got the lobster kung pao ($78). Not really worth the price for Maine lobster for the size we got. The flavor was good, but there just wasn't much meat at all.  Overall, I loved the family-style dining and shared format. The food was good for the most part and the portions were large and filling. We could've probably done without 1-2 dishes as we left full enough to skip dessert. I would definitely return for the large shared pots, especially that tamarind black cod stew.",

We went to Park MGM in hopes to be able to be seated at this restaurant and luckily, we were able to be seated at the bar area. The lady in the front told us that if we wanted a seat in the restaurant, the next time available was 9:30pm or so (on a Friday night), which was too late for us since it was barely 5:30pm during that time! I actually prefer sitting at the bar counter because we were able to see all the drinks and the alcoholic slushies at a better angle as well as converse with the bartender more.  Service: Friendly and informative. The bartender we had was very observant and anticipated our needs. He gave us really solid recommendations and we were so happy that we balled out a little ($$$). Roy Choi, you know how to win us.  Ambience: The restaurant looks very hype with stickers and magazine cutouts everywhere. The use of neon lighting and items nostalgic of our childhood was also everywhere. The vibe and the ambience was also very 90s and hip!  Food: We had the kimchi fried rice, the fries, the dumplings and the bulgogi plate. All were delectable and I had no complaints. Flavored well and had an array of textures. The waatermelon & hibiscus soju slushy ($18 for 16oz or $38 for 32oz) was really delicious. It wasn't too strong in alcohol and also wasn't too sweet. I almost wanted to not share this one!",

    "text": "3 stars, 1 for the great service from our server. He was attentive, thoughtful and knowledgeable about the menu.  We ordered the broccoli banchan, kimchi fried rice, grilled octopus, and spicy cold noodle.   The food was not as impressive as the decor and service. First and foremost, the dishes came out cold. Seems like the food was sitting on the counter for a bit before they were brought out? I was expecting the rice to be steaming and cooking in the pot, so when the food was served at almost room temperature we were definitely disappointed.   The cold noodle was also too tangy and spicy. The flavor was overwhelming and we had to guzzle down glasses of water in order to finish it. The noodles were also quite soft and lacked the chewiness that I'm used to when I usually eat korean cold noodle.   The octopus dish was my favorite. The portion was generous, and the gochujang flavor paired well with rice. The flavor is again, very bold so if you are sensitive to salt I would not recommend ordering.  Overall, I was not thrilled about our meal but it could be that we did not get to meet dishes that match our palette. Especially because we really enjoy Chego and Kogi, we still have hope to find something we'll love.",

Started a little slow with banchan (small vegetable dishes to start a meal). But when the dishes started coming out, everything was great! Kogi tacos was sweet on the initial bite, and had a good flavorful spicy hot on the second. The dumplings is not what I'm used to having traditionally, but very well meshed with the dipping sauce. The bbq prawns had a good citrus flavor. The kimchee fried rice could have been more spicy with gochujung, but not everyone likes spicy food. The bulgogi ribeye was cooked perfectly, and the citrus sauce was a nice touch. The best part was the cheesecake! So far the best part of my trip thus far. The way they presented everything, and flavors are ingenious.",

    "text": "310, 818, 323 and the 213 just landed in the 702!  As soon as my wife and I (we just moved to Vegas about a year ago from LA), heard Roy Choi is opening a spot out here, we jumped on some reservations for Best Friend!  The space looks really unique, from the front entrance, which is also their bar, dubbed \"The Liquor Store\", I feel like you're going through a story book of Roy Choi's upbringing in the city of LA. This front section is also where you and your bestie can get some fresh Best Friend merch.  Going through the menu, I immediately wished we were a group of at least 6, cause, I wanted to order the whole menu. However, since there was just the two of us, we ordered ONLY: The cucumber-banchan, kimchi, Slippery Shrimp, Spicy Pork and the Kogi Short Rib Tacos. Also, included in the meal, was some complimentary Hawaiian style rolls.  Their Slippery Shrimp was my favorite. It had some warm, underlying heat and some next level flavors. I could've eaten two plates of that on my own! Their Spicy Pork is top shelf Korean BBQ, their tacos, if you've ever had Kogi Tacos, are basically the catalyst to pretty much 97% of any food truck making it in America today. So they should all pay homage to this taco. The cucumbers, man, those cucumbers! No joke, I may come back just for these. Easily, one of the best sides I've had in a restaurant period! Simple in execution, but with tremendous flavor. Often, the simplest dishes are the easiest to screw up. Their Kimchi was on point as well, probably the best I've had, certainly the best in Vegas. Last but not least, their homemade Hawaiian rolls were phenomenal. I was using them as a vessel to scoop up some meats and sauces along the way!  Again, I wish I could've ordered more. I wanted one of their pot-dishes SO bad, so I'll definitely be back to try those.  Service was extraordinary, from our hostess, to the person who sat us and finally to our waitress, Stacy; everyone was very friendly and genuinely looked like they were having a great time.  Glad Best Friend is finally here, glad they're in an up-and-coming spot like the Park MGM, glad they're repping LA! I highly recommend this spot, and don't forget, when you come, bring yo Best Friend ;)  Food: 5 Ambience: 5 Service: 5 Value: 5",

He made it appoint to separate the dishes with shellfish from the ones that did not and then explained which was which.   We had the priced  meal for $50 a person. It was more then my husband and I could finish. We had the Korean BBQ street tacos, kimchee, Beef, fried rice and white rice along with date pudding and some other dishes.

Each plate was unique and flavorful ! I loved the decor of the restaurant, very urban-hipster. The service was impeccable. The flavors, dear lord the flavors... let's just say after eating here I am spoiled!   Remember to make reservations, this place was packed on a Monday night.

She failed to inform us that we could have reserved a table online then & there, & we would of only had to wait 20 minutes.  Due to her lack of communication we left and ate elsewhere. We came from California to support our friend's new restaurant. We're fans of his la location as well. But I guess this time it just didn't work out smh",

When you first enter before you get to the restaurant there's a bodega where you can shop for quirky best friend souvenirs and tasty snacks like instant soups, chips, classic 90s candies, etc. There's also a bar inside the bodega where you can order choice cocktails or even a Hennessy and cola frozen drink. Dope!   We had a 5pm reservation and entered the back restaurant area where we were greeted with servers dressed in Adidas track suits, beautiful murals on the walls reminiscent of Long Beach or Venice Beach, and LA hip hop music. The menus were sort of similar to a family photo album and had old pictures of Chef Choi, family, friends mixed in with the actual entrees. The prices range from about $10-50 depending on what you get, but they encourage sharing  so it's really not bad per person.  They had things like elote, traditional Korean meats like kalbi and marinated pork, kimchee fried rice, shrimp, hot pots, tacos, etc. We ordered a few different things to share and everything tasted good and we left full and happy. Chef Choi checked on us several times and stopped to greet us and take a pic (Yay!). Overall it was a great opening!",

Its perfect because you get to try so much of the menu and each item is amazing. I think the shrimp and ribs were my favorite items but everything is really good. Stop by and go.",

I grew up in Las Vegas and moved out to LA five years ago and Roy does an amazing job at bringing Los Angelean fare to The Strip. My boyfriend and I booked a reservation for the soft opening a week or two ago and it was the only thing we had planned for this trip and we weren't disappointed!   The entry room/merch/bar area is super cute and themed so well. The art direction behind every little thing from the outfits the hosts wear to the low key menu is incredible. They play great music that isn't too loud but loud enough to have a good time.   We ordered the kogi tacos, elotes, spicy pork bbq and kimchi fried rice for our meal and everything was INCREDIBLE. We also ordered the date cake which was phenomenal and I highly recommend it to those who like sweets that aren't over the top sweet.   Our waiter was incredible and it was cool to see the man himself, Roy Choi, walking around in the restaurant. We definitely will be returning this week (hoping to try the King Pao Lobster as an early birthday present )",

The restaurant, with its neon signs and bodega-style storefront, was easy to spot inside Park MGM. We were 20 minutes early for our reservation on Christmas Eve but they were able to seat us immediately.   We were unfamiliar with the menu, but our server was super friendly and helpful in deciding what to get and how much to order. We decided on the cucumber & spinach banchan, chego pork belly bowl, spicy pork belly, and spicy cold noodles, which was the perfect amount of food for 3 people. Everything was sooo delicious and bursting with flavor, and I loved that they brought out chopsticks for us in a novelty LED cup. The servers also brought out complimentary bread rolls that were warm, buttery, and delicious. I also got a Jameson & ginger slushie drink, which was delicious albeit on the weak side and a bit pricey. They also had watermelon soju and henny & coke slushies.   Overall I was very impressed with the atmosphere, food, and service at Best Friend and I'll definitely return next time I'm in Vegas!",

However I was most excited to try Best Friend. The food was great, as to be expected. Prices are \"Vegas\" prices, so that is what it is. I do have a couple gripes that dampened my experience. Food timing was awful, in our group of 4, we each got our dishes separately spaced 20-30 mins apart. Secondly, the server didn't seem too attentive to his tables, and this was evident in the body language of both tables next to us, as we all were wondering where he was all night. Otherwise, the decor is amazing and the vibe is cool. I am still a fan of Roy and will continue to support, as this experience was more on the service rather than the food.",

    "text": "Excited to see and taste all the new spots that Park MGM has to offer! Came to Best Friend on Christmas Day, made a reservation but it wasn't super packed. Upon entering, the layout and decor of the bar area and hostess stand was pretty creative. The displays of Asian snacks and having a bar out front definitely gives opportunity to customers who just want a quick bite and drink. Walking through to the actual restaurant, the walkway made it seem like we were entering a meat storage, with the red plastic strip door curtains, felt like we were about to enter a new world. The dining area I loved, it felt very esthetic and homey at the same time. Murals of Roy and his friends and family on the wall, the choices of rugs and tables/chairs made it feel like we were at a friend's house. Love the choices of attire for the servers, tracksuits . It was time for the food and being a fan of Korean and Mexican food, i was excited to see how the fusion would come about.   Food:  Buttered Hawaiian rolls- free refills and probably one of my favorites from the whole entire dinner.  Kalbi- tender, but definitely was too charred and didn't taste like it was marinated enough.  Korean chicken wings- Tasted too much like buffalo wings, did not taste similar to typical kfc at other Korean spots.  Soondubu- Definitely LARGER than I thought it would be and it comes with rice! Although, I was disappointed in this dish. It tasted like they dumped a whole container of the red paste and not much flavor. Definitely too spicy, even the table beside us agreed that it was too spicy.  Mango Budino- My top favorite of the night! It was soft, not super sweet, and good size!   Overall, the concept of the restaurant I do like, but some of the dishes so far could need some work. Next time, I would try some other entrees/ sides, but so far I know what I would not try again.",

The food was too spicy. Almost everything had spicy aioli. Uni should be served by itself to enjoy, instead I was eating rice and lemon, a lot of spicy aioli with some Uni mixed somewhere. Should just put on your menu Spicy Aioli with a side of whatever. Not impressed. Overpriced and rude staff. Wouldn't take anyone here even for the experience!

The Lobster Kung Pao and the Korean BBQ Ribs. The ribs were super mediocre. I've had better at any number of hole in the wall places around the country. They were tough and a mostly flavorless. And served on a giant bed of raw onion. Huh? But the Lobster Kung Pao was terrible. And 85$! Not only does the preparation and presentation make it nearly impossible to dig out the lobster but the spices totally overwhelm it. So you might as well be eating chicken for 1/4 the price. Service was great and the place has a fun vibe.",

What they have done is to mix the meats with Korean sauce with Mexican sauce. They have totally neglected that the meat quality.   In this restaurant, the primary purpose of all dishes is to \"fusion\" good Korean dishes with Mexican flavor.   A party of three came here for dinner. We ordered  Tamarind Black Cod Stew Crispy Shrimp BBQ chicken wings.  If you like garlic, cilantro and hot sauce, you will feel quite at ease. But the quality of the meat is missing: e.g. The Black Cod Stew, fish meat can hardly be found, has no structure and when you do find it, it is in small pieces and they are all mushy.   The sauce on the chicken wings is tasty. But the chicken wings meat is totally tasteless and the meat is soft and mushy.  Even the shrimp is soft and mushy , there is no body to the meat.   This is definitely a NO for me. Just because some one thinks of mixing two complete different sauces together, does not make him a good chef nor a good meal.  Pricing is reasonable for a strip restaurant. Ambiance is for the younger crowd - noisy but orderly. service is good.   All in all, very disappointing.",

It was more Korean than Mexican.  I ordered the Kogi Tacos and KimChi Fried Rice. I shared the tacos, 3 tacos per an order, and they were very good I could've eaten two orders by myself. The Kimchi fried rice was very heavy and rich would recommend sharing and not as a meal in its self. My friends got the spicy pork and it was very tasty but a little oily . I used some of the Hawaiian rolls and put the spicy pork on it and made my own korean pulled pork sandwich and it was rather delicious.  My only complaint is not really from me because I am familiar with Korean food but some of my friends were not familiar with Korean food and were kinda lost on what to order. The menu doesn't have any photos of food but has plenty of old photos to simulate a retro yearbook. Menu is more hip and for show than functional. Waitress was friendly and helpful in trying to describe what each item is like. The entrance is like a shop where you can buy clothes, candy and drinks. The restaurant was just a few steps to the back of the shop. Overall I really liked the atmosphere and food. I would definitely return on my next trip to Vegas.",

We went the night before the start of the Consumer Electronics Show, and given the buzz over this place, we expected it to be jammed, but it was only about 2/3 full. Food was all good, and it was nice that Roy Choi (founder) came over and let us get a picture with him. Overall, a good experience, but I can't help but recall we can get K-food that is just as good or better at mom and pop restaurants in the Bay Area, at prices that are much more reasonable. This is priced for tourists on the LV Strip, and also reflects the hip \"club-like\" interior, so guests are definitely paying the premium for location and hipness.",

Don't know the history and are not familiar with his other restaurants. Like the setup where it looks like you are going to dinner in the back of a bodega. Really interesting dining room, the server was engaged and helped us work through the menu. We started out with the BBQ short ribs, and the eggplant. Both had interesting preparations and were quite good. We asked and they agreed to make us a small pot of the chicken vegetable stew. It was amazing. Could be my favorite dish in any restaurant in years. If you are open to trying something new and different you have to give this a try.",

Everything we had was exceptional and very delicious.  The music was a bit loud at 11PM on a Friday night, but Hey---Its VEGAS BABY!  We will definitely return the next time we are in LV.  I'd suggest that you make a reservation, since the place was very active.  I've been to Korea many times and I really liked the food.  The menu was not totally Korean, since they bring a lot of Their LA Food Truck tradition to Vegas.  Overall, a very fun and interesting place with great food.  Give it a try.",

Now we would add to this short list a brand new restaurant Best Friend by Roy Choi. We made reservation through MGM app since we stayed in Park MGM (formerly Monte Carlo). Having read Chef Choi's cookbook/autobiography \"LA Son\" a couple years back, we were eager to taste the flavors of his fusion style. And the dishes did not disappoint. The starters, Kimchi and cucumbers were authentic and pure. Kogi short rib tacos made believers out of us with True LA street flair and tender BBQ meat. Chego pork belly bowl may be our favorite that was a combination of hot sweet sour zesty flavors. Slippery shrimp is kind of popcorn shrimps covered in creamy nutty spicy sauce. Yummy! We ordered A-Frame OG ribs but simply could not finished and had to box the rest. For dessert the fruity milk shaved ice was refreshing, a nice palate cleanser. All in all a very satisfying first visit. Look forward to the next visit very soon :)",

Show up on time, it's a little difficult to find host, it looks like snack bar/grocery cashier. Check in with host and was told I have to wait 10-15 minutes. Check with host again after 20 minutes, I was told I have to wait another 10-15 minutes. We decide to eat at bar. It doesn't make sense if they can't honor the reservation. The restaurant even report me no show to OpenTable. It really upset me.  The server/bartender really know about their food and drinks. We have octopus, bbq kalbi, slippery shrimp, kimchi fried rice. The food is amazing. Price is a little higher than the Korean restaurant off the Strip, but the flavor, quality, presentation are so good. I'm not big sweet tooth person. But I definitely like the dessert (Bingsu), it's shave ice with milk and dragon fruit.  You definitely should try this restaurant if you like Korean food!!",

A complete joke of a cocktail for $18. The music was insanely loud. Couldn't even carry on a conversation in the place. Is this a restaurant or a club?",

Sadly, other than the theme of the restaurant, the restaurant fails to convey LA's Korean food scene.  Although the restaurant offered a good number of Korean food, I was mainly disappointed by their food quality, or their lack of. We ordered kalbi, braised octopus, and kimchi fried rice. No dish ordered were particularly flavorful or memorable, and the prices were high considering the portion and quality. What made the experience worse was their service. It seemed like they weren't trained well and didn't work in conjunction with the kitchen; our food arrived in random orders that made clear that kitchen had no idea what order dishes were being sent out. For instance, they sent out galbi first (which was a very small portion for $28 and also lacking in meat) without rice or the kimchi rice we ordered. We stared at the galbi for good ten minutes until the rest of the food came out. Two stars.",

But of course the best part is the amazing food! We also had dumplings, the cucumbers with chili paste, spinach, and kimchi. Everything we delicious. The short rib tacos are a necessity! We had the short rib and the spicy pork for the main dishes and both were excellent but the spicy pork was definitely the star. You have to order a side of rice if you want rice with your meal and most of the items on the menu are family style so that you can share with your best friend. Every detail of this restaurant is on point. Also be sure to try the mango dessert. It's an excellent palate cleanser and a perfect way to end dinner.",

The wait staff were very knowledgeable and friendly. The best part was after about a week we opened up the pork belly and street corn and it was just as tasty as when we ordered it!

This new gem is literally inside the newly renovated and reinvented PARK MGM, right next to EATALY, conveniently located! It's so cute, it threw me off coming inside. Apparently the receiving area and where your host checks you in for your table is located in a 'convenient store' for chips and snacks and liquor. I had to ask the host, \"where is the restaurant side?\" Ha! She pointed right through the plastic curtain-doors! It was an experience so fun, we enjoyed taking pictures and trying out their specials. The touch of urban LA slash Korea slash everything diverse and hip and young from the decor to the printed out menus. Let's mention the food btw, served from awesome servers in sweatpants adidas. We tried the fusion tacos of carnitas and steak, also the spicy pork dumplings, and then the Pork Belly Bowl--was just good enough for 3 to share. Did I mention the mouth-watering Hawaiian roles (that I can't probably replicate in my own kitchen)? Leave space for that. --YUM. I can't wait to bring my BEST FRIENDS!!!",

    "text": "I ate here for my birthday during their soft opening and I have a few things that I want to remark on: 1st- the front of the restaurant looks like a bodega when you walk in. You can order appetizers from the bar in the front resting area and the small candies and things at the register. The entryway gave no indication of how dope the actual restaurant is. 2nd- when seated in the actual restaurant it was a very beautiful and comfortable setting. The opening ceilings was covered nicely with huge hanging plants and the mural walls were a very nice focal point. 3rd- the food!!!! I splurged on my birthday so it was pretty pricey but it was well worth it (take a look at the photo of my tomahawk steak). The menu was a cool Korean- west coast fusion. The Korean items on the menu such as the hotpot were served in large pot where a group of 4 could share comfortably. The menu was so diverse that I truly believe there was something for everyone. My boyfriend ordered the half-rack of lamb and those were just as delicious as my steak. 4th- the drinks were so damn good! That's really I can say about it.  My only semi-negative remark would be that the tables are so small and can't really fit all of the food that comes out (if you're fatty and order six things like I did). The food came out faster than I could consume but that's definitely not a bad thing!!",

    "text": "Super cool theme and interior design. Love the storefront entrance and the retro, downscale looking sign/graphics. We had reservations early as we had show tix for later. Ordered two of the prix fixe menu for $55 each and meant to order Salmon Teriyaki for our sons, but got the Salmon Enchilada instead. It wasn't really an enchilada, but grilled salmon w/ enchilada sauce, pickled veg, and salsa verde. That was only okay, but the fish was perfectly cooked, medium inside. The food came out surprisingly quickly. First was the slippery shrimp which was awesome. Crispy, with a bit of creamy spice. Also got the street corn, limey and cheesy, delish also. The eggplant schnitzel was good, too, but served w/ a mustard sauce, which is not my favorite condiment. Crispy on the outside, melty on the inside. The Kogi shortrib tacos were actually not my fave, just kind of meh for me. Also had the pork belly rice bowl, very good. The roasted carrots, cannot remember their actual name, were fine. Cannot remember what other items were on the menu, but dessert was a date cake w/ caramel ice cream and whipped cream, also excellent. Loved the school binder menu w/ retro photos, that brought me back to my own youth (Sadie Hawkins dance photos!!).   Oh, and complimentary, hot, buttery Hawaiian rolls to start. YUM!   My only criticism, which another Yelper also mentioned, is that the busboy asked us to eat/remove one of the buns off of the plate so he could remove it. WHAT? Who does that? That along with the dishes arriving in extreme rapid succession, two-three at a time, made the meal feel very rushed and frenetic. Made it hard to savor the meal -- I'm not expecting pacing like a 5-star French restaurant, but still. Like, are they trying to get us to leave sooner and have the table available for someone else? That just felt weird... but I really didn't like being rushed to eat our rolls...   Anyhoo, very creative, great consistency of the food quality, love the theme (from interior design, including artwork, to staff uniforms, menu appearance, etc). Thumbs up!",

This included the wings (which are spicer than your normal wings but it wasn't off putting at all), and the Big E from the OC for appetizers and I had the Kalbi beef ribs for my main course.  We had a bit of a wait for the Kalbi for some reason it came out 20-30 mins later than the rest of the entrees the table ordered. They made up for this with a free order of the shrimp appetizer (which was also good!).",

The ambience is definitely styled to give you a hip LA feeling and I think it largely succeeds. Tried the short rib tacos, seafood noodles, tempura plate and bonachon plate. Very impressed with the bonachon and tempura and liked tg3 seafood noodles. Somewhat disappointed by short rib tacos, resulting in a lowering of my score. The issues I found with the tacos were a bit of gristle in the meat and the quality of the tortillas. I believe an important part of the taco is the tortilla and Roy's fell short.

    "text": "I was in Vegas for a bachelorette party, and we decided to have dinner at Best Friend. We did the pre fixe menu for $100 each.   Sorry, but our group did not enjoy our experience for the following reasons.   1) Service: I will say that the initial courses came quickly, however at the end we waited more than 45 minutes for our dessert to come. Server was hard to track. 2) Food: all the food was mediocre. I am also not sure why they would serve all the carb heavy entrees first(bread rolls, fried rice, tacos) then serve the protein dishes last (teriyaki chicken, bulgolgi, steak). We ended up with sooo much protein leftovers.  3) Dessert Situation: IN ADDITION to the dessert arriving 45 minutes later finishing our main course (and tracking down our server more than 3 times for an update), we didn't get everything we paid for!! We had a large party, split into two long tables. As each course came out, 5 plates of each dish would be served, 3 on one table(of 13 girls), and 2 on the other table(of 8 girls). That worked well because that meant around 4 people would share each plate. EXCEPT for one of the desserts, the pink (strawberry?) dessert. 3 plates arrived on larger table, and only 1 on the other. I happened to be at the table where there was only one and my end of the table didn't have it. When I tracked down the waiter again to question if another one was coming, he told me no and that we had to share it. WHAT??? You want me to share one small dessert with 7 other people? Luckily I did snag a bite and realized pretty quickly that I wouldn't want it anyway. But, it's still principle to get what you paid for!   Anyway, I don't plan to be back.",

It seemed like the sauce was mainly gochujang but the dish wasn't bad.   The reason why I gave this place five stars was because of the dessert. The food was decent but the dessert blew my mind. We ordered the Mango Budino and the Bingsu. I've had many different bingsu over the years but I've never tried it like how best friend made their dish.

    "text": "This one is going to sting for a long time. It will be seared like a hot poker in my memory among bad experiences. The difficulty to explain is how food can be rendered \"ok to serve\" when it reflects Chef Roy Choi in such terrible light. I am certain, if he was there this evening, kitchen staff would not have been allowed.  To say we were excited for our pilgrimage to Best Friend, would be an understatement. It was to be an event for us. Having no perceived ideas other than what is known about Chef Roy Choi, an LA legend, we prepared gleefully and dare I admit and announce, fasted, to arrive ravenous. It became a comedy gone awry. A total waste of a waist.   The restaurant has great soul. An upbeat vibe with a makeshift humongous pantry upon entering, a live DJ playing music and a Hostess cubicle reminiscent of Charlie Brown's Lucy with her lemonade stand.  Our reservations of four announced and in we go! To quote Elvis (hey this is Vegas!) \"Thats when your heartaches begin.\"   I must make mention here that we are from a Korean family, therefore, while not experts on all foods, we are pretty well versed on these type of dishes Chef Roy Choi is famous for.  Our server Miss Stacey couldn't have been nicer. Eric along with Wayne(sic?) were attentive and on cue throughout the evening. We contemplated whether to order their prix fix (there are 2 choices) or go with several dishes, try, and then order the prix fix. We were greedy and super hungry. Here is the rundown/lowdown: Bottle of wine- very reasonably priced and delicious 2 mixed drinks one which arrived in a red Solo cup! Awesome!  *3 ban chan plates: Kimchi, Cucumbers, and Brussel sprouts. Most likely the hit of the evening. Not too fermented which is ok for me. Slightly more on the vinegary side with a crisp fresh appeal.  *Dumplings: So tender we had trouble picking them up as the wonton skin fell apart.(please see photo) *Carnitas tacos: Dry till it hurt to chew. Would you believe the lime was non-juicy as well? Squeezed it till the spray came from the peel.  *Short Rib tacos: Also dry. Not sure if the meat sat too long in the kitchen. Very disappointing.   *Korean Chicken Wings: No way! How can these be lacking? Lacked flavor(non-marinated?) and the legs were dry. Further disappointment.  *Itaewon stew: better known as \"Army Stew\" with what is suppose to be a fluid liquid and variety of noodles, spam, wieners, and veggies. Except, this  broth was thick as molasses. Please see photo of the upper pan where the liquid was reduced to paste. If it was heated on the stovetop, they left it too long. If it was in the oven, they left it too long. All items in the stew were overcooked and falling apart in your mouth. And the flavoring? A sodium brine. (Please see photos) To tell you we had leftovers and left them, is a crime. But we did, as we left behind anything not touched on pans and serving plates. Chef Roy Choi, this cannot be you. More than anything, it saddens me to think the crew in the kitchen was not looking out for your best interest. Photos tell the tale and I'm hoping you'll paddle their tails.   All is only my opinion and as always, thanks for reading =)",

Laid back waiters, takes time to take your order, inconsistent kitchen timing, too spendy, but great food. We ordered a la carte but a bit of everything; it all came out way too quick so table was packed. Chicken wings were very poor but other than that all bbq and main dishes were great. Tacos excelled and lived up and ban chan was good, though should've been complimentary not $16 which is a complete ripoff. Chicken was standout bbq for me as was the crispy rice with uni which though not Korean really blew me away. Desert game was on with the cheesecake stealing the show and bingsu just a necessity for Korean dinner. Slushees affordable for drinks and super boozy. Total rice is very affordable with expected $70 a person to get super full and a few drinks. I'd recommend the prix fixe which is $50-$65 if you're a small group to get a fee for the restaurant - has all the best ofs and comes out quick to experience Vegas more. Music is loud but music is good and 90s rap base rap; if you're into that, you'll be good. Definitely more authentic spots in the city for social (Soyo) or bbq (Hobak), but for the strip, I'm glad they finally have a quality high end Korea that is at least respectable and hip.",

Idk if its bc i am an angeleno or what but...this isnt (can you feel my disappointment)   First of all...as we walked in the hostess had a condescending attitude...a bit cocky and a bit rude   We sat and decided on our food but found some items on the menu is no longer available...please print new menus....didnt look like it costed much to make the menus anyhow...   Then we ordered:   E.O.C Uni Dynamite Rice  Slippery Shrimp Elotes Kogi Rib Taco  Elotes: mexican style corn  Was the only thing we thought was okay...  The ingredients seems fresh but execution was a fail....  Couldnt find any korean flavors....too much butter and oil in everything... Walked out and saw Eatly and wish we'd gone there instead   We did not have any issue with Service hence 2 stars instead of 1",

I have been several times now, and a few of my favorites are the kimchi fired rice, the short rib tacos, the lamb, and definitely the sundae (it's in a bathtub!) or date cake for dessert. One of the amazing chefs, River, made sure everything was delicious, and we couldn't have been more satisfied.  The ambiance/aesthetic of the whole restaurant is great with the front area and the restaurant in the back. They also have a live DJ sometimes! All of the staff is amazing as well (shout out to our wonderful server Gabriel!). We will definitely continue to frequent this great spot.",

We had Christina who really knew the menu and could help make the right choices.  Started out with the fries, they had just the right crunch and the ramen seasoning on top was so tasty!  The Korean bbq beef was  marinated for 3 days it came on a bed of onions. Every bite made you salivate for more!  We also added more carbs to our order- cause who cares we're in Vegas!  The Kimchee fried rice was cooked to perfection and each bite was delicious!  We topped off with a special desert \"Date night\"  it added just the right touch .. not to sweet.. just oh, so good.    Thank you For making this such a fun experience!  We also loved the decor and seating.  Can't wait to make this a return visit! Tip- Ask to sit in the lounge chairs for dinner so comfy!",

A super fun vibe from the soda shop storefront bar to the spacious inside of the restaurant, and the laid back waiters in track suits.   The menu is pretty great here - seriously something for everyone. Don't skip the cocktails either - super creative and delicious. As for the food itself, we loved everything we ordered. Yes - it's not your typical Korean BBQ place as it's a smidge pricier BUT it is authentic modern Korean flavors. We liked everything we tried - the galbi, the dumplings, the pork adobo fried rice and a few other things.   Highly recommend a visit if you're looking for some good Korean with an LA twist in LV.",

Not because of the food items but he added some of his personal photos from back in the day. Talk about a throwback. From Sadie Hawkins dance, the aZnBbYGuRLL lifestyle/studio photo shoots with your HoMeGurLz all the way to the white tee with baggy pants style the guys used to rock back then....2002-2005 flashed before my eyes.  Athmosphere was hip and 90s-early 2000s music was blasting over the speakers. Music does get a bit loud. Personally, I didn't mind it one bit....but just an FYI. Waiters were either in green tracksuits or white tee with beige baggy pants.   Boyfriend and I ordered the following items: -dumplings (enjoyed this VERY MUCH.) -braised and charred octopus (got a spicy kick to this) -slippery shrimp -kogi short rib tacos (OUR FAV OF THE NIGHT. One order comes with three tacos, you can add extra if you like.) -garlic chicken (least fav. Wasn't anything special. No hints of garlic whatsoever. Tasted like a regular teriyaki chicken bowl you can get around your local city. PASS!)  Located at Park MGM Hotel and Casino, you can expect Vegas prices so yes, what you're getting IS a bit on the pricier side. We shared everything and the bill added up quick! Wish we tried their Korean Wings though...we saw a few tables around us who ordered that and it looks delicious!",

The best part of Best friend is it puts together all his restaurants in LA under one roof. You can get food from his restaurants like A frame, Kogi, Chego and even his restaurant from the past Pot. Must go to the MGM to try this place out if you love Korean food  We went here on a Thursday night and they have a DJ spinning vinyl all night to add to the awesome designed restaurant. Really fun environment to enjoy delicious food!   First thing I needed to order was the short rib tacos which I order all the time from Kogi when I'm in LA. Just like I remember them with a slight difference in the size of the short rib but I ain't complaining on that at all. Love those tacos! We also ordered the spicy pork and the Kalbi ribs. Kind of the traditional Korean but the taste is perfect. Roy Choi really sauced up the spicy pork with a gochujang all over the pork with grilled onions coated with the sauce. Love this dish! The Kalbi ribs are delicious and perfectly marinaded to have that awesome Kalbi taste. Good portion to easily share too.  Great restaurant and Chef Roy never disappoints me with his cooking. He can just make anything taste excellent!",

We sat at the bar as they were fully booked for the evening. You walk into a convenience looking store that also has a casual bar here. You are lead to walk through these red plastic entrance as if you were walking towards the back of the convenience store. It opens up to a 90's LA street decor. Staff were wearing jogger suits.   The menu was very simple. It had a variety of awkward 90s photos. It was as if I was ordering off a food truck. I had the uni dynamite rice. So here I a thinking I'll be getting a massive plate of rice and uni haha well it actually came in a small little dish. Gahh! It definitely wasnt going to fill me up. Thankfully they also gave us hawaiian rolls.  The dish itself was full of flavor. It was a burst of uni and spices. I liked it a lot (I just wish there was more to it). It was an evenly balanced flavor of spice and savory.   My roommate had the chego pork belly bowl. He claims that it tasted like the meat was frozen prior. (I liked it still).   I'll have to come back and try the other food options!",

The sauce of the slippery shrimp is bomb, kimchi fried rice has nice texture, little moist and sticky. They seasoned the Elotes so well.

    "text": "Move over David Chang, Roy Choi is in town! The restaurant decor is kitsch in the best sense possible. Think vintage Korean convenience store with 80s neon funk.   The restaurant is inside MGM Park (previously Monte Carlo) next to Eataly.   Came here on a Tuesday night during restaurant week. Without reservation, an hour wait for formal dining room but plenty of seats available in the front casual dining/ bar area. Seemed family friendly.   I had a variety of dishes from the restaurant week set menu ($50/person). As with my experience with his one of his other taco joints in LA, it's a bit heavy in taste for my Asian palate. I drank a lot of water during this meal. If you like your food on the heavier side, this won't be a problem for you. Meat is tender, dishes are satisfying. Date cake was phenomenal.   Unfortunately not as head over heels for its flavors as its decor. Still a fun enjoyable dining experience though.  Side note, Roy Choi life story documented in his autobiography is super interesting!",

HIGHLY recommend the elote corn dish and kimchi fried rice...could seriously eat that for the rest of my life!!! Roy Choi is the man this food is the real deal!  On a Sunday night we walked in and were seated in the the main area right when you walk in (if you want to eat in the restaurant make a reservation ahead of time) the vibe feels like an 80s LA convenient store but in a cool nostalgic way.  Can't wait to come back next time I'm in Vegas!",

There were 3 of us and we ordered the 65 pp tasting menu as well as the Dynamite Uni Rice Bowl.  Let's start with the uni rice.  A bit of a let down here as the dynamite sauce completely masked the delicate flavor of that Santa Barbara uni.  Won't be ordering that again.  Some standouts were the ribeye steak which was delicious.  The Korean Dumplings were delicate and well seasoned.  The sauce was on point as well.  Kimchi fried rice was outstanding.  For dessert the date cake was a flavor bomb wish I could have  fit more in me.  Now the not so great side.  The Kogi taco was good but the sauce was on the sweet side for me and the tortillas tasted like they came out of the bag. At this level I kind of expect a house made tortilla. The grilled shrimp were okay nothing to right home about.   Bonchon was good nice variety.  All in all if I was in the area I would go back but would I make a special trip to go there.....maybe not",

My friend and I decided to go last minute but we were able to get a spot at the bar.   The fries are amazing and the sauce that comes with it is super spicy. I liked them better without the sauce. ($5) I ordered Short Rib Tacos for dinner ($12) and they were also spicy. I thought it wouldn't be enough for a meal but I was full after and I only had a couple fries.   For dessert, we both ordered one because one of the waiters said we had to try the Date Cake ($10) and my friend really wanted the Strawberry Cheesecake. ($12) The cake was good but it was a little too \"light\" for me and didn't have enough flavor. The Strawberry Cheesecake was yummy and comes with two different desserts. (See photo)",

We didn't have reservations for Saturday night, so we came right when they opened at 5:00pm. The dining room was fully committed so we just ate at the bar. His restaurant is such a cool concept and we loved the bar decor filled with stickers, posters.  For food- we chose the Kogi Short Rib Tacos, Kimchi Fried Rice, and Spicy Noodles. Definitely get the tacos, it was our favorite! The spicy noodles were too vinegary for us and the kimchi fried rice was just ok.  The experience was fun and will probably come back for drinks/snacks.",

The ambiance is great--from the corner store entrance down to the adidas track suits the servers wear. And an awesome DJ spinning some trance music in the dining room. There were 4 of us, and we were a bit overwhelmed by the menu. We couldn't decide, so we got the prix fixe option, which had everything I wanted to try any way. Kogi tacos, chicken thigh BBQ and pork shoulder BBQ, kimchi fried rice, and slippery shrimp. The Kogi tacos were way spicier than I expected, but delicious--the beef was falling apart-tender. Slippery shrimp were rich, but also delicious. Couldn't quite put my finger on it, but there was something crunchy in the sauce--maybe cashews--that just made the dish. Both BBQs were delicious, but HUGE portions. We couldn't finish them and hated to leave any behind. My fave thing was the kimchi rice. It comes in a clay dish and the bottom got a little crispy--the best part. It was topped with a poached egg. I'm not usually a dessert person, but the prix fixe comes with the date cake. It. Was. Amazing. It is served with caramel ice cream. I wanted to lick the plate. This place is def worth a try. I don't like to repeat restaurants in Vegas because there are so many fabulous ones I haven't tried yet, but I would def go back here and get something else on the menu. I'm sure it's all amazing.",

Seating is comfy & playlist was great (they were playing Kaytranada and lots of chill hip-hop). Honestly , the food was mediocre (3.5 out of 5). Much better Korean restaurants off-strip. Nothing from our experience was horrible though.  Everything from the menu is share-able portions for two (or 4 or family style if you order A LOT). All of our food came out fast on a busy Monday night , none of our dishes came out cold. Tried variety of menu items and truly only enjoyed the slippery shrimp , the complimentary Hawaiian rolls , and the dessert strawberry cheesecake & Medjool date cake. Slippery shrimp was crispy & juicy and covered in some delicious spicy and tangy sauce .. should've ordered another one of this instead of the other items we got to be honest. Complimentary Hawaiian rolls had a nice touch with the sea salt and butter. Desserts were HUGE (felt like it was bigger than the appetizers & entrees lol). Strawberry cheesecake is my love - not only dessert had a nice presentation but cheesecake and the yuzu sorbet was tasty. Our server recommended the Medjool date cake and was not disappointed. The cake was warm & gooey and the toffee/salted caramel ice cream had some crunch inside. Date cake was more of a rich dessert while strawberry cheesecake was more refreshing - I'd still just get both :).  The items I wouldn't recommend were the dumplings , Kogi short rib tacos , shaking beef saltado & kimchi fried rice. Well the dumplings , short rib tacos & kimchi fried rice were alright but tasted like any other ones you can find for half of the price. Shaking beef saltado wasn't anything special even for meat quality - too many peppers & onions and the side of french fries took up almost more than half of the plate.",

Ever since I've moved to Northern California I've missed the savory flavors that Roy Choi has been cooking up and I was glad I was able to get a great taste of it again during a recent visit to Vegas.  Chego bowl and tacos - can't go wrong with these options! The former had a really savory and delicious viet-fusion style taste to it and the latter brought me back to the days of eating Kogi truck on the occasion we luckily ran across it in LA. Would come again.",

Kalbi was on point! The fries were not anything good at all. Jazz up those fries Roy! The Mexican corn was good too. Chicken wings were ok, I just felt like there was too much of the same gochujang sauce flavor on everything. Our waitress was in the cutest track suit and we had great service and the restaurant is so funky and really neat! Very fun place to eat! The Hawaiian sweet rolls were good but didn't match to me. But regardless, food and experience was awesome and I would go again! Little pricey but worth the whole experience.",

She informed us that we'd have to wait and she would \"see what they could do\" this was at 9pm on a Sunday night. After 40 minutes of waiting and watching 10 other tables get seated, I asked another hostess that temporarily took over her spot, if they had an estimated wait time. She checked on my name and it turned out another table had been seated under my name. Again, we were late so I understand that the table had been given away, but our names were never re-added to the list!   We were quickly seated and the rest of the evening went great. All the servers and bussers were fantastic and the food was amazing. We sat in these super comfy swivel chairs and basically ate till we burst. Everyone knows the kogi tacos and pork belly bowl are delicious, but a pleasant surprise was the tempura. It was lightly battered and perfectly cooked.   It's unfortunate our experience was marred by a hostess who did not deign to seat us and made us feel less than.",

Too too ill. Hennessy slurpie too? Oh my god, this place was meant for me. I had a little bit of everything and the music inside just made it hard to leave. Swear it played better music than all the clubs on the strip. Real hip hop music. That good goo music.   Food, had the tacos, deconstructed elote (my favorite), wings, and the pork belly bowl. I'd come back for the elote, tacos, Hennessy slurpie and environment fa sho. Pork belly bowl was ok. I think I waited too long to eat it so it didn't taste as great by the time I ate it 30 min later. I was clearly enjoying myself in the restaurant and with the Hennessy slurpie too much.   Highly recommended and I would definitely come back. Loved it and the servers in track suits.",

The place is loud with the DJs so be prepared for minimal talk and lots of food (not a bad thing). We weren't super hungry when we arrived which was unfortunate because everything sounded amazing.  Ordered the Uni Dynamite Rice and husband ordered the Braised and Charred Octopus! Both delicious and arrived pretty quickly to the table. Highly recommended can especially if you have a bigger group as things are served family style (more opportunities to try a variety of dishes!). Wish we got to try the cocktails but I'm nursing a little one, so wasn't an option, but they sounded really good. Hope to go back soon!",

There has been a lot of buzz and anticipation around this restaurant opening, and it did not disappoint.  From the Park MGM parking garage, it's a bit of a walk allllll the way to the other end of the property, but is a great way to work up that appetite before you indulge in all that Best Friend has to offer. I already knew that the entrance to the restaurant was a bodega facade, but I'm glad I read in another review that you have to check in where the the cash register is, because it might've taken a while for me to figure that out.   Upon check in, we were seated right away. All of the staff was friendly and knowledgeable, and our server provided great recommendations on what to order. We ended up getting The Big E from the OC, kimchi fried rice, kalbi, BBQ garlic chicken, short rib tacos and wok veggies, plus bingsu & date cake for dessert.  Everything we ordered was delicious and came out pretty quickly. I know that this place deserves 5 stars because my dad, who is pretty picky and critical of everywhere we eat, didn't have one negative thing to say.... and we didn't hear a peep out of him all night because he was too busy stuffing his face with all of the amazing food.",

We jumped on the hotel website and made reservations for the same night. We went on a Sunday and were able to get a table right after opening.  I was happy to see Hitachino Nest beer on their menu and grabbed one. My wife had a sake.  We ordered the Korean fried chicken appetizer with cucumber on the side, which was as delicious as you'd expect. We'd just eaten at Pok Pok (another great Korean place) in Vegas the day before and couldn't decide which had the better wings. Best Friends wins hands-down for the beat menu.  For our entree we split the Tamarind black cod stew. It was creamy and delicious - everything we hoped for and more. It was similar to a curry, but with noodles added in. I'd go again just for this dish.  Atmosphere wise, the place has an intentional vibe that screams \"we're not in Vegas anymore\". After entering through the literal curtain, you're in the back room of a bodega eating with a few dozen other tables.",

But there was a lot of fresh fruit juice in there so that may justify the cost for some.   Food: all great flavors but i am a spice wuss and literally everything except the Hawaiian rolls were spicy. Those rolls are DELICIOUS by the way.   Tempura shrimp and veggies: great batter, super crispy, and liked that it had a lot of veggies. A bit overly salted though   Saltado dish: almost every Angelino i know, loves Lomo Saltado so i had to order this. beef was a bit tough, fries were nice, pepper and onions cooked well, and for me it was spicy. (I know most people will disagree but i did say i was a spice wuss) a regular person will say this is a 1 and I'd say it was a 5   Slippery shrimp: i knew better not to try this cuz i didn't wanna burn my mouth out. This was my boyfriends dish and it was executed well and medium spice.   Pork belly bowl: SO good. Great medley of flavors. Rice cooked perfectly. Belly cooked perfectly. I knew this was going to be a spicy dish but i wanted to try the flavors anyway. Yes it was spicy, it has gojuchang so that's a given. But this was probably my favorite dish.   I definitely want to come back and try other dishes as the menu is fairly extensive and try \"basic\" things that aren't spicy.   Only reason i gave 3 stars is because i personally cannot eat that much spicy food so menu is limiting for me. That being said, the food is great and if you like spice either a little or a lot, this is a good interesting spot to try. Prices are a bit up there for the type of food and many people may have an issue with paying this much for dishes this \"casual\" but you have to take into account the hotel and ambiance, which whether you like it or not, you're paying for",

This guy made our night, seriously, Valentine's Day can be super lame out at dinner without a fun banter with whoever is choosing to spend their Valentine's Day making your night out better. Sam I am, we'll be back for the food and your banter. But all joking aside this guys was well versed in the menu, super friendly and a little sassy. Loved him!  Win number 2: the food here is soulful, delicious, unpretentious and fun. Roy Choi is a super star in my book. Things not to skip: the kimchi, the spicy pork (although I thought it was more sweet than spicy) still delicious. Huge portion though, so bring your appetite. The dumplings were out of this world, maybe the best dumplings we've ever had with a spicy, umami dipping sauce that was dope.  The octopus, could not have been better, it was perfectly cooked and tender and came in a super yummy spicy, salty, stew. We'll be back!",

Your first look from the outside, you may think it's just a little store that sells snacks along with a bar on the side... But it isn't just an entrance that gave you a vibe of a liquor store/market, it's an entrance to give you an insight of Roy Choi's childhood and teen life.. throughout your visit in the store, you may notice a red drape, which is there entrance to the restaurant where you will also be led in and seated by the hostess. The art on the wall, to servers outfit, the portrait, the lounge area and the menu allows you to sit at your table wondering what all the art meant and how can this be relatable to Roy Choi's life. Some the host/hostess had adidas track suit on, and some had khaki shorts with white T on. This gave such a chill vibe, I LOVED IT! Also, Their intentions of creating a menu that almost looked like a yearbook wowed me most! I spent my first 30 minutes looking over that menu and the pictures in the menu, trying to piece his stories together... I couldn't help but to ask our server about it, but there was so much more I wanted to know!  Came with a party of 4 and can't wait to return! I loved it! Basically it was a story about the positive changes he made in his life! :) Ask about it!",

I read a lot of the reviews after eating at this restaurant and I feel like most people are just fans of Roy Choi.  The price of the food is ridiculous.  The chicken was mediocre at best, and the prawns for some reason had a new car taste.  That sounds like a weird way to describe food but that's really what it tasted like.  The other annoying thing is that they were constantly trying to clear our table, even though we were clearly still eating.  We felt rushed even though the restaurant wasn't busy.  It was actually quite rude, I mean at least let me eat your mediocre food at a decent pace.  Idk who you are Roy Choi, but you are certainly not a very good best friend!

We work in the service industry and can completely relate to that being the case. The best things we ate were the elote and the fries. Legit the best elote I've ever had! We also ordered slippery shrimp, short rib tacos, and kimchi rice balls. I'm sure the shrimp were crispy coming out of the fryer, but once they were coated in the sauce and served, they were a bit soggy. The tacos and kimchi rice balls had tons of flavor but seemed like they were each missing one component to round out the dish. I'd like to return sometime and try the korean bbq menu items.

We had the wings (fried to hell) with underwhelming spice less sauce.  The octopus was smothered in gogijang sauce with a few onions.  Not what I was expected for an $18 appetizer.  The Kim chi fried egg had a non runny poached egg.  What's the point? Again over cooked with mushy rice.  This is probably the hardest thing to screw up (all u need is a wok)and they managed.  Thought I would get the original kalbi tacos to save this meal but it came with mini sized cubes of beef that tasted like beef jerky.  They literally over cooked every protein we ordered.  The only saving grace was the flavors on the tacos.  Overall,  I thought LA Korean food brought to Vegas would crush it but I felt like corners were cut and there was no QC!  You can charge an arm and a leg for amazing Korean food on the strip and people would pay.  I would!! Instead it ended up being a tourist trap next to eataly on MGM property.   Service was fine but there was no follow up during my meal.  Food 2 Service 3 Overall 2.5",
