If you have a man sized appetite I'd suggest finding somewhere else to go for your pizza fix.",

The food was great but my server Brian was the worst server I've ever had in my life. Rude, never checked on us, then after I paid 26$ for bottomless bellinis he basically kicked us out. I am a regular here I know the hours and that it closes at 10. At 9 o'clock he apparently wanted to go home early because he told me the place is closed and it was time to go. Then when I asked for the manager Vanessa she never came to hear how terrible my server was. Unbelievable. The next day when telling a friend about my experience she told me Brian has served her before and was just as terrible to her party. Won't be back to this location that's a promise. Matt however is a great server.",

I had the waiter bring me their \"best house\" pizza. It was no different than any other family style pizza in town.  Luckily, it was my friend's treat, or I would have felt that I had been taken.   I hate to admit it, but the $9.99 Costco extra large, with everything on it, is better. But if you are craving pizza and on a date, this place is a cut above California Pizza Kitchen, and they are nicer than Gramaldi's.   I have had Pizza in New York and it did seem better, but honestly, doesn't food taste better when you're visiting?  I still think Chicago has the best Pizza in the US.",

This is delicious.  I could munch on this old day.  Serve with a good vino, and it makes you feel good all over.  Since I was with my husband, we decided to try two pizza's, he picked one and and I picked one and we shared.  While both were good, I think mine was excellent.  Of course we got the settebello, crushed tomatoes, pancetta, sausage, mushrooms, pinenuts, mozzarela, basil and extra virgin olive oil. (my choice), and emilia, prosciutto cotto, panna fresh mozzarella, parmigiano reggiona, basil and extra virgin olive oil.   The crust is super thin and has a slight crispy bottom, the top flavors were a good mixture I must say, enjoyed, we ate every bite.  For a different type of pizza, a thin crust, this is an excellent choice.  Good service, good food.",

    "text": "Okay saw this place on the food network and have been wanting to stop by every time we are in Vegas but never got around to it.  Well no it we are going to try and make it a regular stop every time. The location we went to was next to Green Valley Casino its across the street in a little strip mall type area.  It is very casual dress and the place is not very big but comfortable.  There is a bar area with T.V. in the corner of the place. The PIE...I have to say that the foundation is the bread crust.  It is so doughy and just a little salty but very chewy.  Greatest tasting crust I have had since having pizza in Italy.  We just the Margherita with buffalo mozzarella it was phenomenal.  We wanted to get meat on the pizza but being our first time we just wanted to taste it with nothing but sauce and cheese, the True tell of a good pizza.  Nothing to cloud the simplicity of great ingredients. We had the pear salad with arugula and balsamic glaze and marmalade.  It was also very tasty, peppery and sweet.  It all blended together very nicely. My recommendation would be to order two pizza cause one isn't gonna be enough.  When you finish the first one your gonna wish you ordered a second.  I would have to say the service was okay.  The water we had wasn't very ....hmmmm...helpful.  I mean he took our order and brought everything we asked for don't get me wrong.  It's just we told him it was our first time there and if he had any suggestions and his response was everyone orders the \"insalata grande\" which is basically a large salad.  I mean with all the salads on the menu that was his recommendation.  It wasn't like he had to be excited about his job, but at least try to sell us on something.  He could have been a little more descriptive or enthusiastic about the food but it was more a hey I'm your waiter let me know what you want.  But he was polite just know you may have to wing it on your first time.  Maybe it was his off night or his first night we just wish he was a little more helpful in recommending something.",

It had been a while (too long actually) since I'd been back to Settebello but after having a rough week it was time. I was not disappointed. I was seated promptly, ordered a \"Settebello\" (it's the bottom offering on the menu but I love it the best) pizza, and with the first bite the stress of everything going on just faded away.   While I love Old School Pizzeria and Chef Gio's pizza, there's just something super special about this place. When you leave nothing on your plate but the faint remnants of the slightly singed crust, that says it all.   Still 5 Stars, Still Best of Las Vegas worthy, and I wonder if it warrants inclusion on my Mythical 6th Star List.

The fam and I parked in the parking lot with a Whole Foods, and when we came in, found the restaurant not very busy @2pm. Interior decor gave off a homey vibe and the brass pipes on the ceiling added a nice touch. They had (authentic?) mint candies nestled in a basket in the desk in front. So the food, which all of you are here to read about: Margarita w/ house made sausage: the margarita and house made sausage were pretty good; the sausage was ok, nothing to write home about. We also ordered the Capricciosa which was fantastic; the ham/prosciutto on the pizza was tender and so yummy! The crusts for both pizzas were slightly charred not the best part but that depends on the person. It was also really floppy from the tomato sauce which was btw super yummy Our waiter was courteous with his \"miss\" \"mister\" etc. and he was fast to get us our check. I went to the bathroom afterwords and OH MY GOD was it clean! You would expect the usual plastic stalls, fluorescent lighting, unidentifiable-liquid-on-the-floor,  but this bathroom was a cut above the rest. There was music, dim intimate lighting(to get you into a romantic pooping mood), wood accents, floral scented hand soap, paper toilet covers...it was the best $$restaurant bathroom I've ever been in... I would definitely make this into a regular stop if I lived in Las Vegas/Boulder City.",

The toppings were scarce and we ordered 3 different pizzas which tasted exactly the same. Although the dough was delicious it was very floppy that you couldn't really eat with your hands. There was really difference in flavor for the 3 pizzas we chose. It's an okay place but probably wouldn't recommend it. Nothing special.",

    "text": "Driving out to Green Valley is worth the drive, if you're looking for Napoletana style pizza.    What was ordered was the Vico and Quattro Formaggi.  Vico was not bad.  This was a white pizza.  Enjoyed the fennel, onion, and sausage combination.  Mozzarella and mascarpone gave it a nice creaminess to the pizza.  The star of this visit was the Quattro Formaggi.  The pizza comes topped with four different cheeses.  What really made this pizza delicious was the Gorgonzola.  If you enjoy the sharp creamy flavor of Gorgonzola you have to order this.  As it is randomly dispersed on the pizza, the most enjoyable bites are the ones that include that sharp Gorgonzola taste.  This is the third time I've been here.  I have always been satisfied when coming here.  There are a lot of other pizza places in Vegas.  I would like to try other places but it is difficult to not come here because there pizzas are delicious.   Unless we do a pizza only visit to Vegas sometime.  Doubt that would happen.",

    "text": "I've been wanting to try this little pizza joint out for quite some time and last night I finally had the pleasure of digging into some of the tastiest Italian cuisine I've ever tasted.  The ambiance in the restaurant can be confusing. When I first entered, I thought I was a bit under dressed, but after being greeted by a t-shirt laden host and looking around at other patrons, I realized this wasn't the case at all. Casual dining in a fancy environment, I can dig it!   I've heard murmurings that this is the only joint to offer authentic Neapolitan pizza in Las Vegas and the menu stated that the oven was built brick by brick with ash from Mount Vesuvius. Whatever they're doing back there, they're doing it right. This was hands down the best pizza I've had in quite some time, second only to Ray's in NYC and possibly Lombardi's.   If you're looking for a place to dine, don't pass up this restaurant. I'll most definitely be back and in droves. I love this food!  For those interested in price, I had an Italian beer, one salad and one full pizza shared between two people and two cappuccinos.The total was $32. Delicious AND affordable!",

This didn't disappoint at all.  The reviews lived up to all the expectations and I already can't wait to go back to try all the other pies they have.    We just split the margherita w/ half of it topped w/ cured prosciutto and bite after bite was simply heaven.  I hope this place is successful.

We went again today and the hostesses and the server came to the table every few minutes to ask if we need anything or if we wanted drink refills. Server gave recommendations and did his best to help us decide what to get. Exceptional service.   Now the food, my dad ordered the Diavola pizza and my brother got the kid's meal (kid's soda, 6\" cheese pizza, hazelnut gelatto.) and I got the Focaccia, great food, my only complaint is that the oregano on the focaccia was burnt because it was put on top before it was baked, I'd personally think that it would be better mixed into the dough.   Overall, very happy with everything, this place has the most authentic italian pizza that I've ever tried. Everything in the restaurant screams authentic (even the salt and pepper are from Italy). Must try if you're living in Vegas or just visiting!",

My favorites are the Settebello and Diavola; the Diavola is super spicy for me.  As much as I love the pizza, I do not always love the service.  Some waiters/waitresses are great, while others appear to be college students who can't be bothered.  E.g., if we ask for something, like straws or additional napkins, they seemed annoyed or are slow to come back to the table.  Nonetheless, the pizza is great so we keep going back.  (And the stars are for the food.)  Also, while the pizza is super good, the gelato is FANTASTIC. This is hands down the best gelato I've had outside of Italy, and a MUST every time. There's usually a special gelato of the day/week, in addition to what's listed on the menu.  If there's anything that's a must try, it's the gelato.",

Crusts were slightly undercooked in our opinion, but next time we'll ask for them to leave it in an extra minute. We like crispier crusts, so this could just be us.  The beet salad was incredible: roasted beets, goat cheese, marcona almonds, arugula, balsamic vinaigrette. Delicious.  The pizza settebello (crushed tomatoes, pancetta, sausage, mushrooms, toasted pine nuts, mozzarella, basil, olio) was awesome, though consensus was that pignoli were out of place.  And our glasses weren't empty when we left, so they brought us to-go cups for the iced tea and topped them off. Really nice touch. Would be in the rotation for sure if we spent more time near GVR.",

    "text": "It's hard to give a 5 star rating to an establishment.  Everything has to be inline and perfect.  From the food, to the service, to the cleanliness...it all has to work.  Settebello definitely falls into this category!  Being a pizza snob from NYC, it would take a lot for me to give a 5 star rating for pizza other then NY style pizza.  I do not recognize Chicago sytle pizza as pizza. It's more lasagna than Pizza.  I never loved Napoletana pizza either.  It's sauce on cracker thin dough, more on the torilla chip side with salsa than anything else.  The only pizza for me is NYC style pizza!  Thin, greasy, crispy bottom and crust with gooey cheese.  Settebello's Napoletana pizza changed all that for me!  First off, the Service and cleanliness was great.  Everyone was very helpful and anticipated our needs.  They were great!  The decor is great and it's a great date place as well as a wonderful family restaurant.  Now on to the food review.  My wife ordered the Mahagarita and I ordered it also with prosciutto.  The Pizza was PERFECT!  The dough was fresh and soft, with a hint of crisp burnt taste from the oven.  Each bite transcended the experience.  You can almost taste the history and love (that's right, I said love) that was put into the pizza for hundreds of years.  From the first person to make a pizza in Italy hundreds of years ago, to that day as it sat on my plate.  This morsel of time was a \"foodgasim\" that lasted from a single bite.  This is just from the pizza dough.  The sauce was tangy with the a tickle of sweetness.  The prosciutto gave it a wonderfuly salty balance.  The cheese was cooked perfect with the hint of the fresh basil giving the perfect aromatic kiss at the end.  It was like the first drop of morning dew, dripping off the left.  Splashing down on the ground, giving life to those around it, unassuming and perfect; as nature intended.   After I wiped away a tear from my eye from this uplifting experience, we ordered the Nutella/Banana Pizza desert.  I'm not a big Nutella fan, but once again the dough was spiritual and made me a fan.  Overall, the 2 pizza's, 2 iced teas and Desert Pizza was $37. Not cheap by any means, but well worth the price.  I highly recommend Settebello's and will be frequent this pizzeria very often.",

The pizza is served quickly so it's hot and fresh. If you enjoy Napoli style pizza, you need to check this place out.   If you have a taste for spicy food and meat, the Diavola is a good choice. It's made with peppered salami, garlic, roasted red peppers and crushed red pepper.  If you love arugula and prosciutto, do the Bianca. It does not have crushed tomatoes (binding sauce) but has a generous amount of shaved parmigiano reggiano.  The Involtini di prosciutto is so good. It is basically, arugula wrapped in prosciutto and topped with par-reg and goat cheese, with drizzled olive oil and balsamic reduction.  The Caprese is fresh as well.",

I have also tried their gluten free pizza and it is the best one that I have tried in Las Vegas and I have tried all of them pretty much.  The service is great also , my favorite location is the one in Henderson. Settebello pizzeria is the only place where I would go to have a pizza .

I've driven past this past numerous times and finally decided to pop in for a few drinks and a slice of Bolognese pizza, which my friend highly recommended. First off the service here is off the charts, right when you walk-in you're greeted and shown a seat. Water is dropped on the table and within a few minutes a server is greeting you and asking for drink orders while giving menu recommendations.  We ordered the Bolognese pizza, baked Gnocchi, and the Insalata. The salad was perfect for two and had mixed greens, balsamic vinaigrette, cracked pepper, shaved parmigiano. A very refreshing salad and a great green break with all the carbs I was about ingest.   The baked Gnocchi was ridiculous. Piping hot straight out the oven, covered in melted cheese and house marinara. I don't think I've ever had Gnocchi with marinara before, always just covered in pesto or white sauce. A must pre-meal snack while you're scanning the menu.  Bolognese Pizza. Just think pizza with a slow simmered meat sauce marinara and light addition of cheese all on some incredibly flavorful soft crust. Marone! This pizza here alone is worth the trip to come back and check out the rest of the menu!",

Many of their high quality ingredients are sourced from Italy. One pizza is enough for two people, however they do not offer half and half toppings. My personal favorites are the pizza bolognese and settebello. Expect a wait if dining in the evening as this place is very popular.",

So what makes their pizza the best brick-over/wood-fire? I'm going to guess its a combination of things including the light dough, fresh tomatoes sauce, and the special toppings like prosciutto ham. The dough and crust is unbelievably good. I noticed they don't use a lot of flour or corn meal under the crust like other pizza places which helps preserve the flavor of the dough.   Today we ended up trying the Settebello & Bolognese pizza. The Settebello has a combination of items including ham, sausage, mushrooms, and mozzarella featuring their regular tomato sauce. The Bolognese has a rich creamier bolognese ragu sauce with fresh mozzarella. Both are equally epic!   If you haven't tried this place yet and you love this style pizza, this place is a must!",

For our main course we shared this pizza (which I can't remember or pronounce) but it had artichokes and olives. I didn't remember seeing ham or pork on the description but if I did I wish I could've asked for it to be on only half of it. At least my boyfriend likes it. :)  We did share a dessert as well. It was a lemon pastry covered in powdered sugar. It was really good but I'm now curious how good their popular one is.  I forgot to add how the service is friendly and helpful especially since I can't say anything on the menu correctly.   Overall, it's a nice place to eat pizza if you're on a date with your significant other.",

    "text": "This place has some of the best brick oven pizza I've ever eaten in my life. Whatever they're doing, it's done right.   Ordered the focaccia and it was delicious. Nice and warm and salty with a dip of olive oil, sea salt and oregano - perfection! It's a nice opener for the rest of the carbs you'll be consuming here.  I've also had the insalata grande and it was nice and filling for a salad. Love the pine nuts and shaved Parmesan, so delicious and fresh.  The topper here, though, is the pizza. Using a precise method this pizza is cooked right. Nice burnt edges, crispy and gooey. I had to eat my quattro formaggi with a fork! So delicious. I dislike Gorgonzola immensely, but it was a really subtle flavor here, luckily (as I didn't notice it was one of the four cheeses).   I've also had the gelato and it was divine, the taste was comparable to the gallons I ate in Rome!  This place is close to my house so I have to cover my eyes when I see it or I'll eat here all the time!    The only, only thing I dislike about this place is that, while the employees are super nice and give great service, they have this REALLY annoying habit of correcting pronunciation. I, for one, think that's horrible customer service when it's so obvious what someone is trying to order. Correcting someone is just condescending to me. Change that one little, tiny thing and this place would be absolutely divine perfection!",

We ordered the Diavola (basil, garlic, red peppers, gooey fresh mozzarella, marinara sauce) and the Capricciosa (prosciutto, artichokes, olives, mushrooms, basil, mozzarella, marinara sauce). They were both soooo very delicious! the crust was perfect- thin, but still doughy and the end of the crust was crisp. And the ingredients were so fresh with that melted mozzarella on top and the marinara sauce had good flavor. I want to go back to try the others and the get the Nutella dessert pizza!",

During a recent trip back, we stayed at GVR and decided to walk over to The District and have dinner here one evening.  I was glad to see it was still around, and most importantly that the Pizza was still very good.  This time I went for the Margherita DOC (Crushed Tomatoes, Fresh Buffalo Mozzarella, Basil, Parmigiano Reggiano, Extra Virgin Olive Oil), $13. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/settebello-pizzeria-napoletana-henderson?select=hkekGVh_GJ4QjwweLrCsjw#hkekGVh_GJ4QjwweLrCsjw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/sett...</a> <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/settebello-pizzeria-napoletana-henderson?select=kfsNFds_cvzeN1IEoAjqZQ#kfsNFds_cvzeN1IEoAjqZQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/sett...</a>  The Better Half opted for the Settebello (Crushed Tomatoes, Pancetta, Wood Oven Sausage, Roasted Mushrooms, Toasted Pine Nuts, Mozzarella, Basil, Extra Virgin Olive Oil), $13.50. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/settebello-pizzeria-napoletana-henderson?select=LnvEfX_z6Tt0JoZnVA7i3A#LnvEfX_z6Tt0JoZnVA7i3A\">yelp.com/biz_photos/sett...</a> <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/settebello-pizzeria-napoletana-henderson?select=LFy3ytX6YHx_EBvqvMt6yg#LFy3ytX6YHx_EBvqvMt6yg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/sett...</a>  The Pizza was awesome of course, just how I remember it.  The Crust was slightly burnt and the ingredients were fresh and full of flavor.  They've kept the quality of their product very high.  Our friend who joined us for dinner was also very impressed.  Although he's lived in Vegas for over 15 yrs, he never had Settebello until now.  He also had the Settebello and was blown away.  Service was good.  The server kept our Wine and Water glasses full.

    "text": "On a last minute lunch date, I decided to join 4 other coworkers at Settebello.  One, because I heard the place is amazing and two, I haven't been here before, so of course, I jumped at the opportunity to create a review!    This restaurant is located within the East side of the District.  When you walk in you'll notice the high ceilings and exposed air ducts.  Makes it feel like an industrial warehouse and super modern.  There are brick facade wall coverings, large windows, dark wood chairs, granite looking table tops and the delightful smell of pizza dough fills the air.  I especially noticed the eclectic pictures of Italian artistry.  The place looks like a high end pizzeria!  I was excited.  The server had very little interaction with our table and didn't seem to like the fact that we wanted to split the checks at the end.  What I did like were the hosts and serving assistants.  They were super attentive and kept checking on our table to see if we needed water or boxes for our leftovers.  Certainly made up for the server's attitude.  For my meal, I got the one and only, Settebello Pizza for $13.50.  This pizza is packed!  Crushed tomatoes, pancetta, wood oven sausage, roasted mushrooms, toasted pine nuts, fresh mozzarella, basil, extra virgin olive oil.  WOW, I was loving it!  The crust was crispy on the outside and perfectly cooked on the inside.  There were blotches of melted mozz balls throughout the pizza.  Love mushrooms on my pizza and they did it up!  The pancetta was fatty and savory, the sausage chunks were huge and dispersed evenly.  I think the crushed tomatoes and basil combination made the pizza taste super homemade.  This pizza was on point and super delicious!  Highly recommended.  If you're in the area, you NEED to try this place out!  In fact, I'm going back next week on another lunch escapade.  I was pleasantly surprised and super thankful I came along.  Another great find here in Las Vegas in my books.  Thanks Settebello!!!",

    "text": "Settebello opened their second location in Salt Lake City, Utah (my home town) a few years ago, and I always wanted to give it a try; unfortunately, I moved to Phoenix before I ever got the chance to partake of their brand of pizza.  Last weekend I was in Las Vegas (Henderson) at Green Valley Ranch for a convention, and one night as my friend and I were strolling around the area we stumbled upon Settebello.  I remembered hearing that the Settebello in Salt Lake was related to a Las Vegas shop, and after a quick look online, I confirmed that this was indeed the same company.  Needless to say, I had to satiate my curiosity and stop in for dinner.  We started with Focaccia, a simple flatbread (basically their pizza crust) lightly seasoned and served with olive oil.  For our entree we had a Pizze Bianca, a white Pizza with a few basic ingredients.  For dessert, pistachio gelato.  Considering the huge number of five star reviews of this place, I won't go into too much depth.  The general consensus that this place rocks is well founded.  The prices are reasonable, especially for the quality, the service is good (albeit a bit slow at times), and the atmosphere is relaxing and inviting.  Settebello's is amongst the best pizza I have ever had, and at it's relatively affordable price point, this place presents an appealing offer of affordable luxury and traditionally elegant pizza you can do quite regularly.  Yeah, it's not $5 hot-and-ready cheap, but as you may expect, this pizza is to Little Caesars what McDonalds is to a gourmet burger joint.  In closing, I'd like to mention what my absolute favorite things is about this place: the elegant simplicity.  Lots of restaurants these days that try to differentiate themselves as gourmet or as offering a high-end or unique dining experience do so by making highly convoluted, and often seemingly haphazard, dishes made up of a long list of vaguely fancy sounding ingredients, often without regard to how well those ingredients play together.  Pizzerias are not immune from this behavior.  Settebello takes the opposite approach.  Instead of throwing down dozens of high end ingredients and hoping you'll be impressed into thinking the whole you are getting is haute cuisine because all of the parts are expensive and fancy, Settebello understands that the whole can be, and often is, more than the sum of its parts.  The pizza at Settebello is not overly complex.  They have a simple, traditional crust, upon which they place a few reasonably simple, high quality ingredients.  You won't see a bunch of ingredients on their menu you're unfamiliar with, but that's a good thing here.  It makes their pizza approachable, as pizza really should be.  Pizza isn't exotic cuisine, it's food for everyone.  What sets their pizza apart is all in execution: attention to detail, starting with simple, but high quality ingredients, and knowing when enough is enough.  Try Settebello.  It's pizza that knows its place in the world, and fulfills its culinary role masterfully.",

I'm giving this rating with one caveat, though: I think the restaurant's HVAC was too cool, and consequently, the pizza got cold before I could finish eating the damn thing.  Nevertheless, if this is what authentic Italian pizza is like, it compares favorably, in my opinion, with NY-style pizza.  I had the Pizza Lasagna.  Excellent.  My friends and I went on a Sunday for lunch, which I have to say was perfect because there was no wait.  I will definitely return on my next visit to Vegas, because there were other selections on the menu that really caught my eye.",

Perhaps it's the location, it's pretty hidden in the backside of The District over by Whole Foods.  The pizzas are roughly the size of a dinner plate so you get a lot of food. This time around I tried the Del Cafore - Wood Oven Roasted Fennel Sausage, Roasted Peppers, Roasted Onions, Mozzarella, Basil, & Extra Virgin Olive Oil.  Keep in mind this pizza has NO tomato sauce and after eating it, I'm a big fan. The waitress asked me if I'd like to add tomato sauce to it. I'm like \"Why don't I just slap an Italian person right in the face? I want it authentic!\"  I said that in my best Italian accent... she was impressed.  A few of my friends have lived in Italy and they've said that this pizza is about as close to Italian pizza as Las Vegas gets.  The caprese is good too, but I really don't know how you could screw up caprese.",

The waiter prefaced that \"everyone should really get their own as they are personal size and not big enough for sharing\".  Um, my friend wanted salad anyway, so no one to share with me, but for sharing it was 2-3 people worth anyway.  Except that this was the worst, flimsiest pizza I have ever had.  The so-called crust was thin and soggy and then the crust was burned black on purpose, which was too much.  So I ate one piece and brought home the leftovers to my husband who will eat anything.  He looked at me and said, this is the worst pizza ever without me even saying anything to him.    I will say though, awesome, attentive waiter.  Our drinks were never empty.  That is all I can say positive about this place.  Not returning.",

It was a special night tonight and I wanted to try something new. Thanks to yelp I stumbled across settebelos. Being Italian and having a special nack for cooking it myself I'm always Leary when it comes to Italian restaurants but I gave it a try. When we walked in we were immediately greeted with a smile and a hello. We sat down, the server Justin was awesome. He explained the menu and we started with the misto. Incredibly tasty. The parm,  zucchini and the meats brought me right back to my Childhood. We went for the settebelo pizza and the Bianca pizza. I was born and raised in Vegas and let me just say we needed pizza like this. I havent left a Restaurant this happy in a long time. Thanks to the excellent ser vice and amazing food they have truly made a Special night memorable.",

To my left was a large party of Italian speaking adults. It was almost as if they set the ambiance for us. You could hear the older lady just going on and on. I do not know if they are affiliated with the business or not but it made our 4 star experience a 5 star!   We started with the caprese and an order of focaccia bread. You can tell a lot from a caprese because of the simplicity of this dish. The tomatoes were perfectly ripe, the mozzarella creamy and the olive oil just flavorful enough. I cracked some sea salt and pepper onto the top and was in heaven.   The focaccia was not the bread I am used to. It was wonderful, but I was looking forward to the thick chewy bread I love. My husband said this was more traditional and he devoured it.  We then ordered our first pizza. The Settebello because if you are going to name a dish after yourself it should be the best you have. And it was! The prosciutto was incredible. It makes my mouth water thinking about it! the small sliced sausage cooked to perfection. I even loved the tomato sauce. Just a very light sauce.  Our next pizza was the Bianca. This was my husbands favorite. It had fresh arugula draped over the top, not tomato sauce but creamy amazing cheese.  Then we had dessert. A lemon tart with the most amazing crust. It was thick and flaky and heavenly.   I can not wait to return with friends!",

    "text": "When I crave for pizza, I Crave for Pizza!! At first, I was thinking delivery from one of the chain pizzas or a mom & pop spot in my  area. I wanted to try somewhere new and I didn't want Chicago or NY style pizza (not that I don't like these types).. I thought Sammy's woodfired, CPK.. but they served the usual americanized pies and I've been there and done that as well. So, after doing some research here on Yelp, I found this place and it was Exactly what I was looking for!  I ordered 2 PIzzas  1. Settebello: crushed tomatoes, pancetta, wood oven roasted fennel sausage, roasted mushrooms, toasted pine nuts, mozzarella, basil, extra virgin olive oil  - I had to order this since they named it after the restaurant! Besides, the toppings sounded more than satisfying. It was Absolutely Divine! Everything from the dough, sauce and toppings were of high quality and was created with such harmony! Pine nuts.. Yeah, they were a nice touch. The only thing is that most of the toppings were placed towards the center and one of the slices didn't have much cheese on it.  2. Carbonara: crushed tomatoes, pancetta, egg, fresh mozzarella, basil, parmegiano-reggiano, extra virgin olive oil  - I loved the simplicity of the toppings and the addition of an egg. Now, it may not sound like much was put into this pie but they didn't have to put much at all. Due to their superb ingredients/toppings, a little went a long way! I engulfed this 'individual' sized dish in record time!   Dessert:  Tiramisu: Silky smooth! One of the creamiest and masterly balanced flavors that was subtle yet soooo luscious!!   * Not only are Most of their ingredients imported from Italy, Even their Freakin' Oven is Italian!! You won't find a conveyor belt or deck oven here!   * Just a note, they do not have Pepperoni!  Authentic, Gourmet Pizza with High Standard ingredients and True Italian baking! This place was a Real Treat!! But the sametime not a place I would often go to fulfill my pizza cravings.. I won't be filled with 1 pizza alone as their toppings were lacking but not because they were cheap but because that's their style and thats the proper way of serving their type of pizza. Not to take anything away from this fabulous place but I may just be accustomed more towards the mainstream pies!",

We couldn't recognize any of the pizzas on the menu, so we don't know what we'd have been ordering. We ordered the caprese salad which was two slices of mozzarella cheese and tomato slices with some kind of garnish. We also couldn't identify any pasta dishes on the menu. Our server, Patrick, was very nice and friendly, and the decor is interesting, but I like to know what it is I'm ordering from a menu. The prices are also higher than two stars.",

We usually go to Pizza Rock for a good pie but I've been meaning to hit up Settebello for years but never made it there. Finally. And regret-tingly. Why didn't we go there.   We had the salads which were full of flavor. But they filled the plate so much that it was falling off. I don't mind because I wipe down the table with germx anyway so I had a big table sized plate.   The Lunch special was spectacular. You can pick any pizza for 9 bucks. Wife had Marg DOC and I had the 4 Cheese.   The crust is up there with the best we've ever experienced. Not had. Experienced. Because that's what it was. An experience. Money can't buy that.   Panna cotta dessert was spot on but the \"whatever the name is\" dessert with a gelato choice covered in espresso and caramel was one of the better desserts I've had in the last few years.   Service was good enough to warrant a decent tip. She came just enough to not wonder where she was.   Will def be back. Make the dive and visit ASAP. Even if there's a line. Can't be longer than the 2 hour lucali wait.",

Now, if you are not used to this original style pizza, it will seem a bit \"soggy\" in the center, because of fresh tomatoes, authentic mozzarella and other ingredients.  You can't expect it to be NY, Chicago, St. Louis, or other American style pizzas - not that they are bad, but there is enough difference in crust, sauce, meats, and cheese to be noticed.

For the salads I prefer either the arugula salad with Parmesan, or the goat cheese and beets, which I think they call \"warm beets\" Soooooooo good! Come and see for yourself",

Highlight dishes for me: - Bolognese Pizza: Just like the spaghetti sauce, this was layered onto your pie. A few at my table had wished there was pasta on it, I thought I was just fine without. I wouldn't have complained if there was a little more of that delicious sauce on it though!  - Brisket Pizza: A delicious pizza topped with brisket and caramelized onions. Enough said. Each slice is a hearty one filled with tender meat and delicious cheese.  - Diavola Pizza: This had the perfect amount of heat with every bite. But be warned, those crushed peppers can sneak up on ya! I really liked the sliced Finnochiona on top as well.  - Beet Salad: This came with red and yellow beets with greens in the middle, topped with goat cheese and drizzled with balsamic. To be honest, I skipped the greens because I loved the beets so much.  - Scotch Tea: This might have been one of my favorite drinks... ever. I know that's a bold statement, but I loved everything about it. Scotch with hints of jasmine. It was smooth, slightly sweet and had me asking for a second before I even finished the first. I'd come back and travel many miles just for that drink!  Service was fantastic and they have plenty of space for larger parties. I'll for sure be making my way back here. I really enjoyed all aspects of the evening!",

The answer is a resounding YES. It is a pleasant space with a bar and many selections of craft bear. I chose a Hennepin Ommegang. It was delicious and refreshing.My server, Justin, was friendly and helpful. He gave me a nice explanation of the menu. I chose the Settebello(picture is posted), generously topped with sausage, mushrooms and pine nuts. It was an exceptional pizza and reasonably priced at $14.00. Frankly, I liked it much better than the pizza I ate at Grimaldi's in Garden City, Long Island. Settebello is now on my \"to do\" list when I return to Vegas.",

The quality of the pizza is consistent and always varied as they usually have some specials on offer. Today I ordered the vico, which comes with roasted fennel, sausage, red onions, mascarpone, mozzarella, basil and olio. Not you're traditional American pie at all, but flavorful and delicious.  The wife chose the margherita DOC, which comes with the real deal mozzarella di bufala. Again her pizza was delicious with just the perfect chewy crust and balanced with the light tomato sauce. I was all caffeined out, but the wife got an espresso. Their coffee and espresso is also the real deal, if you need a pick me up.  The service is usually great, but it can get hectic if they are slammed. Usually the pizza comes out quick due to the thousand degree wood oven, so they are pretty efficient. Like I said, Settebello is a pretty standard place to visit whenever we are in Las Vegas, so we will be back again and again.",

If you're out just say so and give me my $2.50 back.  Cost: After tipping the hostess who took my order + the extra for the \"panbacon\" I spent $20 bucks for 4 slices of mush.

    "text": "We are new to the area, and have heard from multiple services this is THE place for pizza in Henderson. We were not disappointed.  My father was in F&B his whole life.  He always said, \"The best restaurants specialize in two/three dishes and that is what they do.\"  So we walk in, read the menu, and it is cocktails/beer/wine...pizza...and salads.  Taa daaa.    The ambiance is excellent, the lighting perfect and the vibe is great.  Service is very good.  We ordered a salad, drinks, wine and a salad. Nothing disappointed.  Margarita DOC was just like you would have in Napoli, Italia.  Very good, actually excellent.  The salad was wonderful, too.  Wine list is very good, by the glass, and very, very reasonable in pricing.    The only \"OK,\" and not excellent dish was dessert.  We ordered Torta de la Nona, which is one of my favorite things to order on the sweet side in Italy.  It was good, but not excellent.  It just wasn't \"lemony\" enough.  But the Lavazza espresso was excellent.  Again, great menu, great food, excellent flavors and wonderful service.    I'll be back -- again, and again.  UPDATE:  We were there again this weekend. Fabulous, again. Love this place.",

    "text": "\"peet-suh\" / \"peetsa\" / \"peedtza\" / \"pittsa\"  However you say it, this is one of the best of its kind throughout the valley!!  Situated at The District in Green Valley Ranch, this location is quite big with plenty of seating either the inside dining room or the outdoor patio that can accommodate even a fairly large group.  There's also a nice bar setup with flat screen TVs, making the restaurant a great place to watch any sporting event.  Being Napoletana, the pizza is cooked for about a minute in a wood-burning oven.  This isn't your typical NY style pizza where it can be picked up and folded in half.  Instead, the use of cutleries is advised while eating this pizza since the crust is thin and soft which doesn't hold up especially if you stock up on toppings.  Out of multiple visits, everything I've had from this place so far has been really good.  I usually like to start with Panzanella or Involtini di Prosciutto.  As far as their pizzas, I prefer the ones with crushed tomatoes: classic Margherita (mozzarella, basil, Parmigiano Regiano), the Carbonara (pancetta, egg, mozzarella) and the Settebello (pancetta, wood oven sausage, roasted mushrooms, toasted pine nuts, mozzarella, basil).  Fresh ingredients, bold flavors and great topping combinations.  I normally have the 12 inch pizza to myself which doesn't leave any room for dessert.  If you can, however, go for their dessert pizza (sliced bananas, drizzle of Nutella and dusted with powdered sugar).  Overall, Settebello Pizzeria Napoletana is definitely one of the best pizza joints in Las Vegas.  Delicious food, pleasant ambiance and excellent service.  I will definitely be coming back.",

When we go we normally get a couple of the meat and cheese platters for the table (they do have a happy hour deal for $5 that gives you a good selection and just enough for 2) we also always get the buffalo mozzarella and jalapeno pear marmalade for the side - so worth the extra $$ - SO DELICIOUS. When it comes to pizza though we never get the same thing twice because everything is so good! They have unique toppings that just work. Everything down to the focaccia bread at this place is to die for!  The only thing I could even try to say negative is sometimes they run out of their infused oil :( its so good!!! I normally dip the pizza crust and focaccia in it!",

    "text": "This place is amongst the best pizza joints in the Las Vegas area.  If you're looking for authentic Neapolitan style pizza, this place really can't be beat.  Perhaps the most remarkable aspect of their pizza is the mozzarella cheese -- it is unbelievably fresh.  To demonstrate this point, I suggest you order the caprese salad, which includes freshly sliced rounds of their buffalo mozzarella.  The cheese simply melts as you place it on your tongue - soft, creamy and rich.   I have yet to find better cheese anywhere else.  I was in Venice, Italy on vacation about a year ago and, while I searched the city for a pizzeria that could rival the flavor and quality of Settebello, I was completely unable to find any serious competitors.  It's the truth, Settebello's pizza is actually better than any pizza that I found in Venice.",

This is a great place to bring non-adventurous eaters because they think it's just pizza.

Something about my sauce dripping off of my paper thin crust didn't appeal to me.  I've tried many different types of pizzas and this wasn't the hearty cheese+topping rich pie that I like. I shared a pizza with my fiance who shares my passion for pizza, and he agreed. We left feeling hungry.  On a brighter note, the ingredients although few were fresh.  Also, the tiramisu was delicious. Not too heavy or sweet.  Last but not least the prices were very affordable.",

It is hard enough trying to get my kids to eat \"traditional\" pizza due to issues related to greasy cheese, runny sauce, etc. Mind you, I have spent some time in Italy (Florence, Milan) and am ready for a more traditional pie. However, the pizza we were served was inedible. The top was charred as if recently rescued from a burning building. The cooks must not clean their oven after each order, because the bottom of my pie was also burned with little bits of burned who-knows-what embedded into the crust. Let's talk sauce for a minute. A good pizza sauce will thicken while cooking (especially when burned to a blackened Frisbee). Amazingly, the sauce was so watery that it still ran in rivulets over each slice, thereby making each bite a soggy, carbony, yuck fest.",

    "text": "Ever since arriving in Vegas from Australia I've been a big pizza complainer.  You see, I don't like New York Style pizza which I find too oily and soggy and I don't like Chicago Style pizza which I find too wet and saucy and not really what I even consider a pizza.  Now that i have alienated 95% of US pizza lovers, on with the review.  Today while craving pizza I did a little research in the hope of discovering some pizza around town that was neither of these two personally despised styles. I found Settebello on Yelp, liked the look of the photos and the reviews and the wife and I headed there for an early 11AM pizza.  I ordered the Diavola and wife had a custom built pizza with mushrooms and pine nuts.  The service at the restaurant was great, drinks were promptly refilled and the pizzas arrived fairly quickly.  I enjoyed my pizza, it tasted good and the ingredients were clearly of very high quality. I loved the peppered salami on mine. The only drawback was I found the pizzas became very difficult to eat and the middle sections became a bit soggier than I like. I look for a dense, slightly chewy crust about 2/3s of an inch thick and this was very thin in the middle. I think id be awarding this six stars if the crusts were about twice as thick as they are now.  Of course, despite the fact that I really enjoyed my meal here, this doesn't solve my pizza problem. Pizza is a food I want to grab on the way home to graze upon for the remainder of the evening in front of the TV or computer and this is most definitely not that sort of pizza.  In short - not what I was really looking for, but a high quality pizza restaurant for a sit down meal, not 100% to my personal tastes but probably the best tasting pizza I have eaten in Vegas. That's not saying much, but it's still a thumbs up overall.",

I've had many pizzas in some of the best pizza cities in America (chicago and NY), and I've had pizzas from around Naples, so I know my pizza well.  I am also a chef who loves to find good pizza.  And this pizza is the most authentic pizza in Las Vegas if you're looking for Napoleon style pizza.   The ingredients are all imported from italy, and they even had the oven built by a company from Naples.  You can definitely tell the effort they put into it.  The crust is thin, but flavorful.  The sauce has a great balance of tomato flavor and beautiful acidity, perfect as a backdrop for the fresh ingredients.  Even the sausages and hams are imported from Italy, so you will be getting great toppings too.  The cheese melts perfectly, and is the perfect finish to the pizza.   If you ACTUALLY like Italian pizza (unlike all the people that don't like this place), then you will love Settebello!  Try their Happy Hour too.  2 for 1 drinks, and cheap appetizers.  The fried calzone on the happy hour menu is amazing!",

We started with the misto appetizer, which consists of slices of very fresh and excellent Italian coldcuts (salami, proscuitto, mortadella) , cheese, olives, mushrooms and foccacia bread.   It was really good.  Next, husband ordered the capricciosa and I ordered the settebello pizza.  We've been to Napoli so we knew what a Napoletana pizza should taste like (and this is what Settebello promises to deliver).  The pizza here was very good - correct thin flexible crust with a few blackened spots, foldable as it should be.  The toppings were much better than at the majority of pizzarias here in town (especially flavorful was the sausage on my pie).  But did this blow us away?  Sadly not.    That's why I'm giving it only four stars.  However, we ended the meal with the tiramisu, and that was one of the best  I have ever had anywhere!   Another point in their favor were the prices - the most expensive pizza was only $13.50.   In sum, it was a close and very good try, and we would go back again.  But we're still waiting for that blow your socks off pizza moment here in Vegas.",

We ordered the Settebello pizza, insalata grande and tiramisu. The tiramisu is a must try, they claim it's made in-house. Overall, it was a very satisfying meal.

The True - only - pizza is the Margarita Pizza. In fact there is a place in Mergellina, Napoli, called \"Da Michele\", and that's all they serve (no pepperoni....) (the best pizza in Napoli). Let this be a pretext to my simple but effective review. Settebello's Margarita is subliminal, nostalgic. The crispness of the crust is unique, the texture of the San Marzano imported tomatoes is unnerving. The mozzarella is adequate (being imported it loses a little texture). The atmosphere is very suttle and reprises what you'd expect in Napoli (simple settings and not much else). Carmine, the owner, is from Castellamare, Napoli. And the thing I liked the most was the affordable pricing (10 bucks for an individual pizza). Buon Appetito!",

If you're in Vegas and you want pizza that is exactly like pizza you get in Italy, then you have to go here.  They have been allowed by the EU's business licensing as Pizza Vera Napoletana, which you need to use all of the ingredients and True pizza tastes straight from Naples.  I started with the 'Insalata Grande' and then I had the Carbonara and I couldn't have been more happy.  Best meal I've had in a year, easily, and it didn't cost me an arm and a leg (like I spent the night before at Ago's at the Hard Rock).  The young American man, form Utah, that started this place has done an amazing job.  Every little detail, from the glasses to the way the utensils are wrapped in a napkin and paper ring, make you feel like you just walked into an Osteria in Naples or Rome.  Give this place your business if you're in Vegas, and you will walk away saving some cash to gamble with and a fulfilled appetite!!!",

Appetizers- Focaccia - Warm pizza dough topped with sea salt,oregano & Olive oil  Ruccola Salad-Arugola, Lemon, Olive oil, fresh ground pepper & Sea Salt I had the Marinara Pizza- Crushed Tomatoes,Olive Oil, Garlic & Oregano -NO CHEESE - My Daughter had the Margherita Pizza- Crushed Tomatoes, Oilve oil, Garlic, Mozzarella - WE ASKED FOR NO BASIL AND ADDED EXTRA CHEESE- Dessert- TOO FULL  but next time we did plan on trying the Nutella Pizza that is topped with of course - Nutella, Whipped Cream, bananas and almonds. Sounds Glorious....... I love that every ingredient is simple and minimal but still so flavorful and satisfying. I will take pizza from Settebello over any other pizza hands down.

After a few moments of irritation, we were able to secure the same price for our beverages while seated in a booth (they normally require you sit at the bar, but one of our party was under age).   Our waiter recommended that we try their insolata appetizer, which was prosciutto wrapped around arugula with goat & other cheeses, olive oil and balsamic reduction. It was a delicious, light start.   We ordered two pizzas; the cappricioso (spelling?) and the special of the week, which was a white pizza with cannelini beans sauteed with salami. Both were satisfying and flavorful on a super-thin crust. My boyfriend found the special pizza to be rather bland and didn't finish his piece, neither did our friend. The other pizza had big hunks of kalamata olives that provided a strong briny flavor that complimented the pizza well. It also looked like they use a real wood-fire oven to cook their pizzas.   Their tiramisu was creamy with a good balance between sweet, bitter espresso and creamy cheeses. The lady finger bunny ears on top were a cute touch but they weren't very crisp.   I had sampled some of my boyfriend's left over slices the day before and declared the pizza to be crave worthy which was one of the primary reasons we ventured here. One of his friends had proclaimed it the best pizza in Vegas, which I doubt. It's tasty, yes, but a True pizza master could craft better. If we're back on this side of town we'll probably come back given my boyfriend's insatiable love of pizza. We'll  be sure to try lots of other places, though, before we can call this the absolute best.",

A friend and I came here to catch up over their happy hour from 3pm-6pm. Settebello offers 2-1 well drinks and non-craft beers and four different menu items. We got a mini margherita pizza and the piatto misto (both $5). The magherita was not to go nuts over. It was luke warm and the juice from the tomato made everything slide right off. The marinaded veggies with pizza crust cut up into pita chips was a light snack with much flavor. We also got the Insalata Grande, not on the HH list. It needed to be doctored up with more balsamic, but I enjoyed it. The pine nuts, fresh slivers of parm, tomatoes, olives, and mixed greens was plated in a generous portion. We finished with a Nutella Pizza, also not on their HH specials. It is best with fresh strawberries. In total, four dishes and two Anchor Steams, our bill came out to $33. It was an adequate amount of food, but my friend says that the food is better when you are not sitting at the bar.   Adrian, our bartender/server, was attentive and checked in often enough without disturbing us. I want to come back and sit in the restaurant to see how the food differs. Right now, I cannot agree that it is the best pizza I have come across.",

The Rucola is fantastic, although occasionally will have a touch too much salt, depends on the chef I suppose.   Sufficient variety of Italian beers and a full bar if you want more.   All desserts on the menu are worth saving room for.   They are also family friendly and generally reasonably priced.",

This is as close as you can get (in Vegas) to actually eating in Italy. All their ingredients come from Italy. You can even buy bags of their Italian flour and take them home to try your own recipes.

I used to be a sucker for Chicago-style deep dish pizza UNTIL I ate at Settebellos!! I LOVE LOVE LOVE their Naples-style thin doughy crust pizza. I got a classic margherita pizza with basil and prosciutto crudo on top. YUMMMMYYY!!! I literally almost ate every single piece, but decided to take one piece home for a late night snack.  My favorite thing to do is eat the whole slice.... then take the doughy crust and dip it into a plate of olive oil with a bit of balsamic, fresh red pepper flakes, and parmesan. SOOOO GOOD!",

The antipasti was very good with 3 kinds of meat, 2 kinds of cheese, artichoke hearts, and garlic flat bread that was very very good.  The pizza here is thin crust, but not crispy... rather doughy. The taste is awesome on both pizzas, but the center part gets soggy which I don't like.  Would come back here with others, but probably not alone as I would not be able to finish one pizza by myself, and would not want to take it home as it will get too soggy.",

Settebello is a little hidden gem in the desert just waiting to be found... like a 10 karat diamond, colorless, flawless one to be exact...  I've heard several great things about this restaurant and FINALLY got a chance to taste the goodness!!  It's a flat bread pizza with a flakey crust.  Sinking your teeth into this mouth watering pizza was... simply.... AMAZING...  You can tell the ingredients are of finest, the cheese alone was, drop your jaw-ONO (as we say in Hawaii)...  Eric and I ordered the 2 most popular pizzas on the menu (12\") -although my memory gets me everytime and I can't remember the names...  they both have meat on it, so we requested both have half with meat (for him), half with no meat (for me)... It's not comparable to Papa Johns, California Pizza Kitchen, or TJ's...  Settebello is on a whole new level of it's own- far, FAR above those just listed.  I can't rave enough about it...  Nestled in the District in Henderson, it's a must try if you're in the neighborhood....and if you don't...tisk tisk, what a shame!!",

    "text": "This is my favorite pizza place in town.  The one I get most often is the quattro fromagio, the balance in the cheeses acidity of the tomato sauce and fragrant basil they use makes it anything but boring.  All the ingridients are so fresh and high quality.  If you are someone who needs a super crispy or thick crust it might not be for you.  It is generally easier to eat this with a fork and knife and quickly (which is not hard for me lol) because it can get on the softer side after a certain point.  I have found that if I have a left over slice you can just throw it on a frying pan at home and cover it.  It will allow the cheese to melt and crisp the crust back up.  Their sangria is also great, super refreshing.  The nutella pizza is big! I recommened getting it if you have a large group to share.  I used to love their panna cotta when it was made with cut up strawberries rather than a strawberry thats pureed into an over acidic sauce that takes over the whole dish.  They have a lemon type dessert that is light and lovely as well.  Their tirimisu is not the best I have had, it was a little dry actually.  Overall all though I do love their food, especially the pizza.  Sometimes they have a special bolgunese pizza I highly recommened.  Also a tip, if its super busy and they have no tables just go to the bar, it usually has some spots opened and its sectioned off a bit from all the other people.",

    "text": "We went there late on a Tuesday night. The place was pretty empty. But there was a lot of phone order take-out.   The pizza was very good. One of best we had since Pizza Bianco in Phoenix. Wood fired brick oven delivered a nice charred crust. At first, the char flavor was a little overwhelming and it took a little bit more than a few bite before we started to enjoying them.   We ordered Magherita, and Del Cafone pizza. They both are very good. Del Cafone is sausage, roasted red pepper, onion, and mozzarella without the sauce which was a little dry. We solve the problem by splash some olive oil over the slices before we ate them.  Our favorite course was the appetizer \"caprese\", it was sliced round tomato with sliced fresh mozzarella topped with fresh basil and olive oil. The waitress brought over the appetizer split on two plate without us asking for it, we thought that was very good service on her part.  Overall, the food was wonderful.  I personal think the only reason this place is not packed is because of the price. I mean, all the items on th menu are very affordable, but after the meal I signed for $43 on my credit card. I started thinking if that is just a liitle too much to spend on pizza for two?",

Don't hate me for not loving it, sorry yelpers.  The sauce is very light and there isn't much cheese at all (it's probably fresh), and the toppings are used sparingly.  I prefer lots of veggies and a tiny amount of salt from a little meat (or anchovies, yum), and this wasn't like that at all.  My husband had the margherita with prosciutto and roasted garlic, and I had the quattro stagioni.  I really loved the quality of the mushrooms on my pizza and the salame.  After a little bit my pizza got very soggy and it wasn't so good.  I also had an ensalate which wasn't remarkable as it was just lettuce and Parmesan, but it made me feel like I got some veggies in my diet.  This pizza is really similar to the meal we had at Enoteca, Mario Batali's restaurant at the Venetian that I absolutely hated.  Settebello is definitely better than Mario's establishment, and the price is very reasonable.",

    "text": "Satisfying quickies are the best, especially in the end when you both know it was a very orgasmic experience.  Both being your tummy and the empty plate in front of you!  Three, four, five, or even 69 course meals are all nice and dandy but sometimes you just need that quick fix and Settebello hits the \"spot\" and delivers.    Eat it like you mean it!  You know what I'm talking about, because as soon as the pizza comes out of the oven you have to eat it right away otherwise it gets cold.  Right now I'm listening to JT's Blue Ocean Floor and I'll get this review done by the time this song ends, quickie quick quick.  So after visiting my parents and brother I left a little early to grub before heading to trivia and the closest bookmark I had to Shakespeare's was Settebello.  Looking at the menu I didn't see any distinct ingredients that I haven't had before on my pizza so I did the bro thing, we like our toppings on top, and chose the bottom most item which was the white pizza, Emilia.  I had a glass of the Sangria also.    My pizza came out perfect, the ingredients matches that of my other favorite place and you can tell it's from out of this country, especially my lovely Italian bacon.  Obliviously I ordered it traditional meaning uncut so it gets to my table faster but you can have the server bring it to you cut up.  Uh oh, JT is starting to repeat himself.  They do have happy hour at the bar but I didn't go for that since I could easily finish two pizzas by myself.  I didn't create my own pizza but you can add on ingredients to a pre-constructed pizza.  I love the inside and how there are servers, my server did an excellent job.  But the next time I need to try a salad, red pizza, dessert, and have straight up wine.  When rumors float around they are sometimes bad but if the rumors are True about Settebello and they open up a second location at Sahara and Ft. Apache then the Summerlin folks need to feel lucky!  Who wants to break that location in with me?!",

The pizzas are FRESH and HOT out of the oven... the crust is perfect .... the flavors all meld together into a mouth-watering-can't-stop-eating experience.  Their salads are really good as well.... and big enough for 2 people to share.   I am partial to the arugula salad... fresh, crisp... light dressing.  It's really the only time I like arugula is at Settebello.  At home it just tastes like weeds... at Settebello's it tastes so good I usually eat the whole thing by myself because I don't like to share it.  Their pizzas... like I mentioned are so yummy you can eat the whole thing in 1 sitting.... And at the end of the meal you don't feel bloated or greasy or icky like with normal pizza.  So... order your own... cuz you are more than likely NOT going to share it.  Settebello's pizzas are not your typical greasy, overly cheesy, thick crust affairs.  These pizzas are light and gourmet.  Their crust is super thin and the cheese is a complimentary topping... not smothered all over creating an impenetrable layer.    Location:  In the Whole Foods shopping center across from The District. It's a small shop and it's usually pretty crowded so go early or plan to wait a bit. Note... there is a small bar and you can eat at the counter there so if that's something you are willing to do you might find that as a viable option.",

The beauty about this pizza is that you can tell its ingredients are original. You won't find anything like it. Also, you can order your own pizza and eat it. The whole thing and not feel terrible . It's little sauce and little cheese. Very thin crust.   The restaurant is excellent with service and cleanliness.   I've eaten here several times and will continue to in the future!",

    "text": "This place has 4.5 stars for a reason: awesome Neapolitan style pizzas.  I've been coming to this restaurant for 7 years, basically whenever I travel to Vegas I stop in, sometimes more than once per trip. If you've never had this style of pizza, and there are more and more places that are doing it, then you should definitely try it.  Settebello is one of the first places to have started making pizza like this in Vegas.    They've recently expanded the menu, offering more combinations of toppings.  I almost always go with the Margherita, which is insanely good for being just crust, sauce, mozzarella and a little basil.  A tip though: always ask for the pizza sliced (the standard is not to slice it).  The rest of the menu has expanded a bit, too, where they now offer a wider array of salads, salumi, and oven-roasted appetizers.  In my opinion, the Rucola salad is the best and unique - again, just arugula, lemon juice, olive oil, salt and pepper, and they manage to turn a set of humble ingredients into something great.",

My wife ordered the Settebello Pizza which comes with the house made sausage amongst other items.  I ordered the Diavola and asked to add the house made sausage.  Both pizza's came and in looking at hers, it had big chunks of sausage all over her pizza and looked really good.  I got charged $2.50 to add on the sausage and was VERY disappointed.  3/4 of the pizza had very little sausage on it and the other 1/4 had absolutely NONE.   I told the waiter and he responded with they use a spoon so its not like they tried to give her more then you.  REALLY???  Just looking at the two you can tell there was a difference and to be charged an extra $2.50 for something they just did not deliver on and to have the server respond like that,  I probably would not be going back here for some time.  I can get a better deal for my money then getting cheated and then treated like and fool by the waiter.  This place does not have my vote and even though the food is good, the value especially when charged extra is NOT worth the price.  If you are going to charge $2.50 for add on's, they should equal or exceed what you are charging.",

    "text": "Outstanding!  My wife and I arrived at around noon and were greeted with smiles and seated immediately. The atmosphere of the place was warm and welcoming, with a nice soundtrack of Italian music playing in the background.  We started our lunch with a Misto antipasto, which was excellent, consisting of two kinds of prosciutto, salami, two kinds of cheeses, olives and pickled zucchini, and accompanied by a delicious focaccia bread. We ordered a pizza each - the wife had the \"Quattro Formaggi\" (four cheeses), which she loved, and I had the \"Settebello\", which was topped with crushed tomatoes, pancetta, sausage, roasted mushrooms, toasted pine nuts, mozzarella, basil and extra virgin olive oil. I'm from New York City, born and bred there for 40 pizza-eating years, so I'm very critical of pizza in general, but I can say that this was, by far, the best tasting, most authentic pizza I have ever had outside of Italy.  Fantastic pizza aside, what really made the visit worthwhile was our server, Tam, who treated us as old friends even though we had never been there before. He patiently explained everything on the menu, answered our questions, made great suggestions and never left us hanging or wanting for anything. This was our first time here, but it definitely won't be our last!",

Well, I'm a natural born foodie, so...no judgment and my theme is \"Bring on new experiences with food anytime, anywhere!\"  The bf and I were in town for a wedding so of course during our down time we wanna explore what Henderson has to offer when it comes to food and culture.   I honestly wasn't even hungry at the time we showed up since we literally had breakfast 2 hours before but this is the kinda schedule you gotta be on if you're dating a FOODIE bodybuilder. :P  We ordered the Vico Pizza Pie which had Wood Oven Sausage, Sauteed Fennel, Red Onions, Mascarpone, Mozzarella, Basil, Extra Virgin Olive Oil. All those ingredients sound amazeballs, don't they? Well, they sure were!  One thing that was off though was that our waitress told us that they serve their pizza Napoli style which means we have to cut into our pizza with our own knives and forks and that they do pre-cut pizzas at the customer's request but it's not standard. Our pizza...came out cut for us? WTF. We're all about authenticity and we were looking forward to cutting into the pizza and into the soft \"wet\" center ourselves. Oh well, I'm not going to knock down a star just for that.   The pizza was seriously amazing (mascarpone and mozzarella me anytime baby) and I'd totally come back here to try some of their other pizzas or specials they have. :)",

I can, however, tell you where the best clubs are in Vegas for 20-somethings because of it.   Back to the food - highly, highly recommend. Pizzas were all fantastic (Margherita, Quattro Formaggi (sans Gorgonzola) and Settebello). The Misto plate was large with enough for sharing with the entire table. I ordered it as a main and it was too much food for me.   Service - great. Tam was our server and was attentive but not overbearing. Friendly and looked happy to be at work!",

This restaurant is a little difficult to find as it is quietly tucked away behind Cheesecake Factory and other eateries that can be seen on the Main Street, but finding this is worth it!   We ordered the Margherita pizza, which can easily be split between two people. It is large enough and hearty to fill your bellies without being uncomfortably full! The dough and mozzarella cheese were the best part of the pizza, the sauce was a little watery...however it seems like they make the sauce from scratch as we could see chunks of fresh tomato as we were enjoying our slices. I wish the sauce was a little thicker and less watery since it made the sauced part of the pizza less crispy and I prefer my pizza to be crispy throughout.   The prices are comparable to others at $13-$15 per pizza, and they offer a nice variety of dessert varying from tiramisu to gelato (dessert prices range $5-$10), which we will return to try one day.   This block has its own free parking lot shared with the other restaurants and Whole Foods.",

    "text": "I'm originally from Naples and therefore have a thing for traditional Neapolitan pizza. My quest is to find the best out there. Settebello did not disappoint. I could tell from the moment that I walked in that the aroma of fresh tomatoes was in the air.  Settebello is a small operation with two locations just off the Vegas Strip and the rest scattered around southern California and Utah. The restaurant is named after the seven of gold card in the Italian card game of Scopa. I've won and lost (mainly lost) many games of this in my lifetime.  I ordered a Margherita DOC pizza which came with buffalo mozzarella as any good pizza should. This was spot on and delicious, everything from the flavor to the crust and texture were perfect.   They are about sourcing ingredients directly from Naples, or locally when that is not possible, which accounts for the authentic pizza-making methods and taste here.  For dessert I ordered a tiramisu which was very good. The tiramisu was very creamy, but I thought the mascarpone was slightly too heavy on the coffee for my liking. Ultimately this is a personal preference though and the tiramisu was still delicious despite this.  On the service front, attention was a bit lacking considering I went during lunch when there were just a few other patrons in the restaurant. Once they served me my pizza they didn't really come back so I had trouble flagging someone down to order dessert and ultimately get my check.   From where I was seated at the bar I noticed the staff sitting in the back playing on their phones. If the slower service was due to a lot of guests that's one thing, but to have 10 patrons in the place max and still have to flag waiters down because they're playing pokemon or whatever was disappointing.   Other than this service issue it was a great experience and the pizza here should not be missed.",

    "text": "Been several times. Always great!  The pizza size is a hearty meal for one, or a delicious part of a meal for two.  My date and I usually split a pizza and a salad (the Beet Salad is a fave!) and that is plenty for two big guys. If we're still hungry, we'll finish up with one of the delicious deserts.    Last night, we shared the seasonal special - the Ripieno Autunno, which was absolutely fantastic! One of my favorite things ever!  \"Ripieno\" just means 'stuffed' - and \"Autunno\" (as you might guess) is 'Autumn'.  This stuffed and folded pizza was truly special. Sweet squash combined with sausage and a generous amount of fresh sage stuffed into a perfectly baked crust made for a perfect cool-weather repast. Stuffed with Autumn, indeed!  As a bonus, we happened to be there on a Thursday - when the drink special is Margaritas of several different sorts for the extremely reasonable price of $4. I had the \"Italian\" Margarita - which had Amaretto and orange juice. Unusual, and I don't know if I'd call it a \"margarita\" - but I liked it! (I had a second).   Four drinks, the Ripieno and a very large salad came to just under $50 - which isn't cheap, but is quite reasonable for the quality of the food and the nice-casual vibe of the restaurant.",

My first time having it and it definitely won't be my last.   I had the most amazing pizza as well. Didn't really know most of the ingredients so I just asked our server Tyler what he recommended and he said the Settebello which is a sausage pizza. Their sausage is made in house btw it was amazing. But I love my pepperoni so I added it on to the pizza, it's only $3 and it's totally worth it. But here they call it Calabrese (Calabrese = Pepperoni) But it's sort of a bit spicier pepperoni. OH MY GOD, best pepperoni I've ever tasted. So fresh and crisp and it has a lil kick to it. So freaking good !!!!!! My pizza also came with bacon, olives, pine nuts. And the tomato sauce is so delicious and fresh. I loved it.   My boyfriend got the Vico pizza with the marmalade on the side. And that cheese on that pizza was so yummy. It's like a sweet and creamy cheese. It has no tomato sauce on it. Comes with prosciutto, he's a big fan of that. But honestly, the pizza that I got.. the Settebello was the best pizza I've ever tried and you should try it to.   I realized that I've been to this restaurant before but in Santa Monica at the marina. And the quality of the food and service is exceptional at both locations. If your craving some authentic and fresh pizza, you gotta come to this place.",

Stuck in a small but tasteful strip mall, in a space that reminds me more of a brew pub than a place that serves staunchly authentic Napoletan pizza (most of the ingredients are even imported from Italy).  Maybe I was expecting the red checkered table cloths...  Service was friendly and fast. Inexplicably, my wine was brought in a small regular water glass, while I saw someone at another table get what looked like a wine glass to pour her sparkling water into.   I had the Quattro Stagioni, which was a Margherita divided into 4 quarters: one with wood oven roasted sausage, one with salame, one with roasted mushrooms and one with calamata olives.   The first thing I noticed was how good the crust was. Super thin with small patches of  black from the oven. The toppings were not generous but that could just be the Napoletan methodology. The cheese was in small dollops rather than spread all over. I found the pizza to be  on the salty side, perhaps because they use sea salt. The olives were whole pitted olives which fell off as I ate the pizza.   The pizza overall was excellent and I managed to ram the entire 12\" pizza down my throat in a record 15 minutes.  I brought my 5 star rubber stamp but couldn't quite pull the trigger on it. I really enjoyed it but it did not blow me out of the water. I definitely want to come again and try some more next time I'm in town.",

We were so happy with our pizzas...I got the Emilia, and at first was weirded out by corn on pizza but you can't even taste it. So light and buttery. Delicious. My husband got the pizza with brisket, it was so different and tasty. My Mom got the pizza with mushroom and artichoke, and my Dad got the margherita pizza. I couldn't choose a favorite; they were all so fresh and unique. Even the traditional margherita was amazing and tasted like it came from Italy. We started off with the salad with artichoke hearts and lots of freshly grated cheese. I also got the nutella pizza for dessert, which was the one dish I didn't care for. And the drinks! I got the spicy pepper mule, and it was just the right amount of heat. I can't wait to go back the next time we are in Henderson!",

The service was curt, though polite, and when I asked for a suggestion she nearly rolled her eyes and said, \"everythings' good.\" For a place serving True Napoli pizza, I was surprised that it seemed the wait staff didn't take more pride in their product. I settled on the Margherita.   2. We ordered our food slightly behind a LARGE party. Though I am understanding and don't mind waiting for my food, knowing the chefs need to make things in order, I am discouraged from returning from the HOUR WAIT. My friend was getting tipsy from her martini sitting on an empty stomach.   3. The ingredients were fresh, delicious, amazing in their flavors and textures. However my friend ordered a pizza with Italian Sausage on it. In her entire pizza there were FOUR SLICES of tiny sausage on it. I get it that your ingredients are imported. But we didn't pay $15 for a pizza to get FOUR slices of sausage.   My lemon drop martini and friends glass of wine were wonderful. The pizzas tasted like heaven. But price and portion size made me wish we'd gone to Grimaldi's. And I'm sure my waitress was embarrassed from our long wait time because she never offered dessert.",

When I went to Naples, it was so ghetto that I was not comfortable enough to venture out to their pizza spots. Only if I knew it'd taste amazing, I would have been more ballsy! I really like making my own pizza (red sauce, onions, mushrooms, sausage) or ordering the Pizza Lasagna. The house salad is good but the Insalata Grande is not worth the $8 (trully boring). Both tiramisu and lemon tart were good desserts; the textures and flavors were on the dot but nothing unique (except for the price $5!). I think I'm officially a fatty because I don't get full when I share my pizza. I think I could eat one whole pizza on my own. I'm pretty sure actually.  We've dined in once before but usually we do take-out. Of course our dining in experience was so much better because the pizza was fresher but we like ordering take out from here when we have our friends over or want to stay in. Such a great place!",

    "text": "First off, I would consider myself to be quite advanced in the art of pizza making and have tried a wide variety of styles, both at home and in some well known pizza spots across the country.  WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THIS PIZZA AT SETTEBELLO:  This is authentic pizza napoletana (neapolitan).  If you don't know, that means it's classic pizza as it was originated in Naples.  It's a particular thin crust, slightly chewy type of pizza with mozzarella and basil as a typical starter.  For me, and for many, this is the best pizza there is.    There are very specific Italian standards that need to be met before one can get the official designation, and at the moment Settebello is the only place in Nevada that has it.  For more information, look at the official organization's site yourself:  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fanticapizzeria.net%2Fvpn%2Fhome.html&s=d3b61b96eee975c33b164bf67313076baaf556fc2a45a3ef8afef0bca392f892\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">anticapizzeria.net/vpn/h...</a>  Basically it means all their ingredients come from Italy, which would include Caputo flour (slightly different than the bread flour used in most pizzas here in the states) and San Marzano tomatoes, which to be officially authentic have to be grown in the volcanic soil of Mt. Vesuvius.  The mozzarella in the U.S. is typically fior di latte, but Neapolitans typically use mozzarella di bufala (buffalo mozzarella), and they do include this option.  Of course none of this would matter if they didn't cook it in a proper wood fired oven at very high temperatures.  The pizza has to cook very quickly to get the proper balance of crisp, chewiness, and melted cheese.  You'd be amazed at how long it can take to master this.  So that alone makes Settebellos special.  For anyone, much less a pizza lover, this is a classic dish that one must try in their lifetime.    What you should expect is a thin crust pizza, with an airy crust that has spots that borden on being burnt, if not a few hot spots that actually are.  It should be crisp on the outside and chewy on the inside, but not as chewy as a traditional New York pizza which has higher levels of gluten.  The middle of the pizza will be soft, so absolutely do not expect a slice of pizza to hold up when you pick it up.  It will droop and bend, and this does not mean it was cooked improperly.  This is how it's supposed to be, and this is how we like it!  In fact, anyone from Naples wouldn't actually cut their pizza into slices, they would fold it up on several sides and eat it.  When I eat this pizza I definitely do not expect them to cut the slices, although they always ask, and I usually tear it in half first and then fold the halves once more and eat it that way.    The waiting staff was always helpful.  They allowed me to mix up my pizza so that one half is one style and the other is another style.  The second time I did that the waitress got it wrong and thought I ordered two pizzas.  They decided to just give it to me at the charge of one.  Nice!  I'm a big fan of red pepper on pizzas, particularly the napolitanas.  But it's hard to go wrong with any of these options.  Just remember, if you go with DOP mozzarella, which is made from buffalo's milk, it's going to have a much stronger taste that some people love, and others really don't like.  If you're used to typical mozzarella, which is fior di latte, then feel free to keep it safe.  You might ask them to take a peek at their wood fired oven, and see how it's all done.  Seeing my pizza get baked is a pretty enjoyable experience in and of itself, and always makes the eating better.  Bottom line is, you can't beat the ingredients they use at these prices, and the authenticity of this place can't be found elsewhere in the area.  For me it's highly recommended, and every time I'm in Vegas I'm coming back.  Apparently they're doing well, they have a restaurant in Pasadena, CA, but I haven't tried that one yet.",

I know that they use double 00 Caputo flour, which is good for wood burning ovens. It was good but not great. The pizza is light and airy and thin. I prefer a thin New York style pizza. More a chewy bite with a slight crunch, like Grimaldis. two pizza, 1 salad and couple of drinks came out to be $46 for lunch before tip.   What I also didn't like was that the pizza's were preset, no topping choices. I guess, I prefer Americanized pizza over authentic Italian pizza.",

    "text": "After reading a glowing review in a past issue of Las Vegas Weekly and recently online through Yelp, I was really looking forward to checking out the $5 Happy Hour offerings at this Neapolitan-style pizzeria. We decided to go with the basics - the Calzone and the Margherita pizza. The personal-size calzone was tasty, however, the bottom quickly became a soggy mess in less than five and the top also lost its initial crunch!?!? The Margherita pizza was quite tasty with a light amount of sauce and cheese so that I could fully appreciate the chewy, slightly charred crust. The happy hour menu is a super duper deal for small appetites and budgets. I suppose if I lived in Henderson, I'd hit up this budget-friendly happy hour all the time, but it wasn't worth the drive from Vegas. Maybe The Lakes location has the same Happy Hour deal? The new location wasn't open last time I was in Vegas...  I feel service could be improved as: *We weren't greeted when we entered the restaurant, even though there were two employees chillin' at the hostess stand. *Our server/the bartender didn't check up on us. *We had to flag down our server/the bartender for our bill even though we were sitting around a while after we finished our food. Is neglect normal here, because I've eaten in bar areas of other restaurants and received plenty of service?!?!",

    "text": "This place is amazing. It gets a good rating for a reason. All of their pizzas are wood fired in a brick oven, which always gets brownie points. The pizza gets it's own unique taste from the oven and you can taste the quality.   The pizza: Every pizza is 12' regardless of what you order. The prices range from around 11 dollars up to 15ish and they not only have original marinara pizzas, but pesto and white as well. In fact, they have four white pizzas. They have other items on the menu as well, such as pasta, but really, who wants pasta when their pizza is so gosh darn amazing.  As said before, it's wood fired in their own brick oven and is sicilian style. The crust comes out chewy as expected and really picks up the oven taste. I ordered an Emilia, which is one of their white pizzas and not only the sauce,, but the cheese and meat.were cooked to perfection. I will go back many times to taste more.   Dessert: AMAZING. Almost All of their desserts are around the 5 dollar range. Their tarimasu was the best I've ever had. Usually you get an extremely small portion on it at restaurants, but not here. It is BAM in your face and huge. Oh, and delicious too. Pair it with espresso if you want to be in True heaven. Speaking of.  Espresso: If you are a coffee lover, I suggest trying their espresso. It is extremely high quality. That about sums it up really.  Service: This is also amazing. The waiters are friendly and professional. My drink (water) was never empty, but the staff didn't vug you TOO much. They were also more than happy to tell about the place and give recommendations to me, since it was my first time.   The only flaw, really, is that it's TOO good. There can be a wait time on the weekends, but it's worth it. Sooooo worth it.",

    "text": "Well, the hype is True!  And, Rod U. most recently, and many others before him, speak the truth.  Settebello serves great pizza.  Not just great Neapolitan pizza--great pizza, period!  Diane and I attended LJ's UYE here the end of last month, and I--a New York style Dom DeMarco's, Secret Pizza, and Biaggio's champion, and not one typically enamored by Neapolitan style pizza--was suitably impressed.    This is not your typical Pepperoni and sliced Mushrooms Pizza establishment.  But no matter!  The other fine Italian meats served here, Roasted Mushrooms, and outstanding Toasted Pine Nuts are just as satisfying.  As remarked by others, the ingredients imported from Italy are top of the line.  I loved the great flavorful slice of Italian ham Kevin P. was kind enough to extend me from his tantalizing order of Antipasto Misto.  And, the Soppressata I added to my Settebello was as spicy as my server said it would be.  My mouth was on fire!  And the spice lingered there, but in a pleasant, reminiscent sort of way.  My only complaint is that a 12-inch pizza is not enough for me--especially when the crust is relatively thin.  Settebello's pizza crust is not of the crisp cracker variety commonly found throughout Italy, but it is surely thinner than typical New York style pizza.    Yet my pizza was still hot and saucy, and I liked everything about it: the dough, Crushed Tomatoes that tasted like mild and wet Tomato Sauce, tangy Pancetta, relatively mild Wood Oven Sausage, in addition to the Roasted Mushrooms, Soppressata, and Toasted Pine nuts that delivered a nice crunch to a bite.  Only next time I might opt to add a milder Italian meat.  And I will likely order two pizzas for myself, and take half of one home after I have devoured the rest.  I know Diane will not object, because she may very well do the same.  When it comes to pizza, we do not mess around.  For dinner we usually order a large or extra large pizza apiece, eat as much as we can, and take the remainder home for at least lunch and sometimes also dinner the next day.  The only requirement is that the pizza must be superior in flavor, texture, and ingredients.  And, Settebello delivers on all counts!  The dough comes out of the super-hot oven with a little char for Neapolitan authenticity, but no char taste.  Diane, who is fussy about pizza (and most other foodstuffs) very much liked her Emilia Pizza, with ham, Mozzarella, and EVOO, even though she was skeptical going in.    To open, while awaiting the firing and presentation of my pizza, I also ordered an Insalata, and found the Radicchio to be somewhat bitter, but that is the nature of this beast.  Fresh mixed greens and a very good light Balsamic Vinaigrette overpowered the bitterness in any event, and the salad portion was quite generous.    Service was efficient and helpful.  The companionship of fellow Yelpers was enjoyable, and of course the food was great!  It was a fine and memorable UYE.  And, I plan to be back often to introduce other pizza aficionados with whom I am well acquainted, to the magical tastes that regularly emerge from the wood burning oven of Settebello.",

    "text": "Grab your fork and knife.  No slices here.  True Napolitano pizza in Vegas (or as close as you're gonna get without a trip to Italy).  So it's a small chain of restaurants, all good.  Quality ingredients atop a perfectly blistered, chewy, well seasoned crust served by a proud and friendly staff.  Win!    This is the real deal.  They even follow the the standards laid down by the Italian government that define such trivial things as the basic ingredients of the crust, its thickness, and the cooking temperature.  The Margherita DOC is excellent.  The standard to judge all Napolitano pizza by, a simple base of crushed, ripe, acidic tomatoes, fresh milky Mozzarella, fresh basil, and a splash of EVOO.  Near perfect.  The diavola with its fennel flavored, gently aged finnochiona, sweet roasted peppers, garlic and mozzarella equally good.  Too simple?  The pizza Capricciosa with its aged, porky porsciutto, oil poached artichoke hearts mushrooms olives basil all atop the same sweet, acidic tomato pure topped with fresh mozzarella, outstanding without being overloaded with toppings.  The only weakness, the namesake Settebello.  The sausage lacked the aged, umame flavor so characteristic in Italian cured meats.  A minor point considering.  Very inexpensive for the quality.  Now if they would just move the tables much closer, encourage chatting it up with your neighbors, get some disposable paper table coverings and serve an abundance of wine....",

Someone was always checking to see if we needed refills or anything else. I tipped generously for that.   Second, the decor was cute and very authentic looking. I've been to Italy and Settebello blended the wood and marble aesthetic perfectly.   As far as the food goes, I wasn't super impressed with the pizza brisket I got which is why I'm not giving 5 stars; it just felt like it was missing something. Also, while the meatballs were good, there was a lot of bread in them (sometimes more bread than meat).   Overall, I would definitely come back again and try something different!",

When I get the pizza with the soft yolk, I break it and spread it all over the pizza like a sauce. Somehow yolks add a creamy flavor to things that cannot be imitated with anything else I know of....yummy. Don't forget to ask for the spicy olive oil to drench over your pizza. The housemade chili oil adds a great kick.   If you have leftovers and decide to take it home, warm it up in an oven or eat it cold. Microwaving would destroy the nice crusty crust.   Service either inside, at the bar or outside is always friendly. It really seems like the staff likes working here and with each other. This reminds me of my restaurant days.",

It came with several different types of cheeses, fruits, honey and jam. The honey was amazing! Sadly they didn't know the type of honey that is served with the platter but I would love to add it to my kitchen cupboard. I would need to get this again if we decide to go back.  For pizza we ordered the Pizza Bolognese. It was pretty good but since the sauce was so heavy it made the pizza flimsy and not crispy at the bottom. If you don't mind your pizza not as crispy I think you'd enjoy it. I did like all the sauce because it tasted good I just wish the pizza was toasted more at the bottom.",

Amazing food, great value, friendly service, and intimate setting. If you like extremely greasy, loaded on cheese, Pizza Hut style pizza, stop reading now because this place is too good for you.  Settebello has the perfect crust where the edges are fluffy yet crispy, and the rest is thing and delicious. They are constantly adding new pizzas to the menu and always are great. House made, fresh ingredients and never overdoing the sauce OR the cheese. I am truly happy after devouring a pizza with my husband here. My personal favorite, the Diavola and they have one currently with Jalapeno jelly that is the best white pizza I've ever had. I'm not even a huge fan of white pizza.   The salads and the appetizers are to die for. When I can get a salad that consists solely of arugula and no other greens, I'm a happy girl.   Settebello you continue to impress. Keep doing you.",

Been wanting to try this place out for a while now, and I finally did on my birthday!   Service was great -- server was patient, friendly and helpful with suggestions and questions.  The ambiance & decor was gorgeous -- loved the walls and the bathroom too!   It was a Saturday late afternoon and there was no wait.   I'm looking forward to trying their happy hour one day.    My favorites were the foccacia and the brisket pizza. These are both a MUST have if you haven't tried them before.   Foccacia - appetizer - soft pita-like? bread - you have to try it yourself. I tried searching Whole Foods, Trader Joes & most grocery stores for this... and Trader Joe's has foccacia but it's not the same.   The Brisket Pizza -- This was so flavorful. I haven't seen this concept anywhere else. If you love meat, this right here. You have to try it. Luckily my brother ordered it or I wouldn't have know how onoliscious this is. Better than the pizza I chose.    - If you can't decide between two pizzas then ask for half and half pizza, you can try both.    So far, this is my favorite pizza place in Vegas.   Other tidbits:  -there is a bar area with televisions.  - great for groups - in the District at Green Valley so there's shopping, movie theaters, parks, and casino near by. The District is gorgeous at night, great for a date night stroll. :-)  - after we ate here it inspired us to make some Italian / Napoletana inspired dishes.   I will definitely be back!",

The menu has so many great options. I finally decided on the Diavola pizza. The crust was perfect, spice level was perfect, and the amount of toppings was perfect. The ingredients all tasted high quality and fresh as well. Definitely no complaints on this option.   My husband had the Carbonara pizza and added sausage. He loved that they offer additional toppings, especially his favorite, extra meat. Again, everything was perfect with this pizza as well.  I loved the portion of the pizza. My husband was hungry so for him the size was perfect for one meal. I opted to eat half here and save the other half for leftovers the next night. The thin crust pizza makes a nice meal without feeling like you are overeating.   Settebello is a great weeknight option as well. We rarely eat out on weeknights because of time constraints, but Settebello was quick getting our food out. I love that I have a spot to eat on weeknights without spending too much time.  We were really impressed when the check came out. Pricing is more than reasonable for the quality of the food.",

My personal favorites are the Bianca pizza which is prosciutto and mozzarella, and the Quattro Formaggi which is a mix of fontina, gorgonzola, mozzarella, and parmesan. The focaccia is something I always order as well.  The ambience of the restaurant serves many purposes. You can easily celebrate a special event here, or stop by for lunch or dinner. The dining area has a nice ambience, and feels homey. It is clean and the service is attentive and professional. You get all this, but the prices are reasonable, so it doesn't break the bank.  The dining area isn't large, so if you have a large party, call in advance to make sure you can be accommodated, the tables can be moved together, but you will still be limited. Of all the pizza places this one is in my top five favorites.",

The night we went, the person in charge of cutting the pizza could not even cut the pizza properly, or the slicer was dull. So we had to cut it ourselves.  Primary service was good, secondary service horrible. Was brought a self-serve unit of peppers in response to a request for cheese.  Doubt that we'll be back.",

Bellini's on Sunday with numerous options.. I chose Passion fruit ;-). If you like traditional Italian Pizza, get your slice at Settebello! This was a True Sunday Funday!",

The hostess provided coloring pages and crayons to keep our youngest three kids occupied. Our waiter, Patrick, did a great job answering questions and was very congenial and attentive throughout the meal. The ambience was casual yet classy, with a stone and wood pizzeria hearth motif. We ordered a beet salad as an appetizer. The salad was super fresh - sweet beets, sweet carrots, spinach-style salad leaves sprinkled with a tangy oil based dressing with rich crumbled cheese and pine nuts. We all ordered pizzas, which come in 8\" and 12\" sizes. As a man with a big appetite, I found the 8\" Settebello pizza to be filling. I was able to sample from all the pizzas my family ordered: Cheese pizza, House Sausage pizza, pizza with pear & jalapeno marmalade sauce, and pizza with Calabrese meat. All had rich, fresh, tasty ingredients and were very flavorful. Understand the nature of this style of pizza is it is thinner, chewier, and able to fold like a taco. Excellent pizza, excellent customer service, I highly recommended this restaurant!",

    "text": "I swear I reviewed this restaurant before....   Anyways, I had a chance to go back last night, and it was as good as I remembered. However, I don't think it deserves a five star rating because of the inconsistent service and small portion sizes.   We started out with the Caprese (tomatoes, mozzarella, basil, olive oil, and sea salt), and the Misto (meat, cheese, and vegetable sampler).  The tomatoes in the Caprese salad had seen better days, and the mozzarella was -just OK. The Italian meat selection in the Misto was quality, but I was not a fan of eggplant or olives that came with appetizer.   We decided to share 2 pizzas for 5 adults. First we chose the Margherita which was basically a cheese pizza with a touch of basil throughout. What I really liked about this pizza was the tomato sauce.  It is flavorful and not too thick and pasty -like other pizza places. Our second pizza was the Settebello which was really different and delicious. What I liked about this particular pizza was the addition of toasted pine nuts. It gave the pizza a nice crunch and went perfectly with the sausage, pancetta, and mushrooms.  For dessert we chose the nutella pizza.  This amazing dessert is their pizza dough with nutella, bananas, almonds, and powdered sugar on top. Messy - but worth it! I was only able to get a bite of this wonderful treat because my wife turns into the incredible Hulk if you mess with her dessert.  Next time, we may have to order 2 nutella pizzas......",

    "text": "If you are looking for excellent pizza with high-quality ingredients, Settebello is the place to go. There aren't any unnecessary bells and whistles - the short, one-page menu lists just a few appetizers alongside the pizza, but the small selection ensures that every item you eat there is delicious. The pricing is reasonable, bordering on inexpensive, for the quality of the food you're getting.   Don't skip the appetizers! The salads are especially fresh and beautifully-constructed. I would recommend the Panzanella salad to share; it's light enough that it won't distract you from your pizza later, but with flavor and body from the shaved cheese and proscuitto crisps to make it worth your while.  As for the pizza, the dough is thin and soft with just a bit of a crunch; it'll fall apart if you try lifting the slices and eating by hand. You'll be happier in the end for having to pick up your knife and fork, though. You'll appreciate the distinctness of the ingredients; the toppings aren't drowning in seas of cheese and sauce and grease, and every bite is different and delicious.   The food is definitely the number-one selling point at Settebello, and the ambiance is a good second, with the cozy-but-classy casual atmosphere. The service needs a bit of work though - it's just \"okay\". For the excellence of the food they're serving, the average-ness of the wait staff is a bit of a letdown. They're efficient, but lukewarm at best on their own. They do a little better if you break the ice yourself, though. Don't hesitate to ask your server for clarification if you need help with the menu and all the Italian food terms, they give good advice.",

So you are getting a pizza that is not loaded with a ton of ingredients, rather fewer toppings and more simple, traditional, sauce and dough.   The service is fast, food always good, and staff very friendly. The pizzas are cooking in a wood fire oven that gets over 900 degrees F. Takes approximately one minute to cook giving the pizza's a thin crispy on the outside chewy on the inside crust. Most of the ingredients are imported from Italy, and the cook moved from Italy to help the owner start the location, which was originally of horizon and valley view.   If you like your pizzas with so much cheese and the sauce loaded with so many seasonings that it doesn't even taste like tomatoes then this is not the place for you. If you like authentic simple recipes and high quality ingredients, for an all in all reasonable price, then you will enjoy this restaurant.",

This special lunch \"menu\" consists of a laminated card which just states the pricing - no items are listed in detail - you have to refer to the regular menu for that.  We thoroughly enjoyed our pizzas which were delicious and for the price, what a deal!  A few days later we came back with guests who were visiting us.  First of all, this time we were not handed the lunch priced menu -we had to ask for it.  Okay- no problem - maybe they forgot, (or maybe not!)  All four of us each ordered a pizza.  Again, delicious.  Now time for the bill.  Lo and behold we were charged the regular prices ($13 - $15 instead of $7 - $9).  We questioned the waiter who said he didn't realize we wanted the lunch prices.  Hello - why would we ask for the lunch priced menu and then order the same items for full price?  It was obvious we knew enough to ask for the lunch priced menu and then we wouldn't order off of it?  A little deceptive, I'm afraid.  We could have made a bigger deal out of it but we had guests with us and didn't really want to carry on.  So, just want others to be aware - be very specific when ordering and tell your server that you are ordering off the lunch priced menu or you just might be charged full price.",

    "text": "Searching Yelp for a pizza place close by my house I read the reviews for Settebello and decided to make a Whole Foods and Lunch outing. I'm so glad that I did. I can't believe I never really noticed this place since I shop at this Whole Foods a good bit, but it's fairly inconspicuous.   When it comes to pizza I try to be pretty open minded. I worked for a pizza trade magazine for over a year. In that year I had tried more pizza than any one person should probably eat. I have a hard time saying anything is \"the best\" since I try to appreciate each style for it's own merit. Saying that, it actually means a lot of me to give a pizza place a 5 star. This has to be some of the BEST pizza I've had in YEARS.   What to expect? VERY thin crust pizza with very fresh ingredients. The menu isn't huge. I've had a few pizzas now and even tried their proscuitto/goat cheese salad [can't remember the name]. Be aware though that since the pizza is so thin even I can eat an entire one by myself and I don't eat that much. I have definitely enjoyed several afternoons of pizza and bourbon before I went shopping. I probably should reverse that order though since I wind up drinking too much bourbon and buying random junk at Whole Foods.   On a side note I would watch the \"bartenders\" is you drink anything besides wine or beer. I drink my bourbon on the rocks. The last time I went the bartender neither knew what Maker's was (it's the best they have) and he was about to shake my bourbon in a shaker before I stopped him. I find it a little comical now but was a little taken aback then.   I definitely think this is the best pizza in Las Vegas and some of the best I've had in a long time.",

Brian served us and he couldn't have been nicer.  His recommendations were spot on, however, I would add a salad (their involtini is amazing) to the happy hour hors d'oeuvres and it would be a complete meal.  Brian said they filled up later in the evening but we were there at 5:30 and did not wait.  I am sure it is worse on Fridays.",

    "text": "Thank God for Settebello! It turns out that I've been under a rock for over 20 years.   Did you know that \"pizza\" joints do not truly make real pizza? Unless it's Vera-certified (aka Verace-certified) then what they're making is an imitation.  Quick history lesson: Pizza originated in Napoli, Italy.  There, they set the bar for how pizza should be made.  Since then, \"pizza\" has been replicated in different ways but many have not followed the original guidelines.  So bottom line, unless it has a Vera certification of authenticity, it's not pizza.  The good news is that Settebello IS.  And, it's AWESOME.  What we ordered: Pizza Lasagna $11.99 Settebello Pizza $12.99 GET THIS! Awesome textures and flavor profiles Special Pizza with white figs and ricotta  In order to be True pizza, the ingredients and process have to be specific.  For example, the flour is imported from Napoli.  And it makes for a perfect crust.  Their crust has a bite to it, but it's not crispy or cracker-like.  It still maintains a doughy consistency, and I love that it's not bready.  Toppings are generous and are not overpowering.  Flavor combinations can be simple like a Margharita, but fear not foodies! They can also be very creative and different.  One thing I was skeptical about was that they don't use tomato sauce.  It's a no-no according to the Verace Association.  (Yup. They even have an organization to mandate pizza... they're hardcore!). Instead, they use crushed tomatoes which I found to be SOOO much better.  I want my pizza that way from now on thank you very much.  There are only a few Vera-certified pizza places around and can be found here: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.pizzanapoletana.org%2Fshownaz.php%3Fn%3DUSA&s=273ee12141f9987e4ff16216b1bd5cd1f967a1f6915570b6929349bffe271f1f\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">pizzanapoletana.org/show...</a>  Please de-virginize yourself if you have not yet tasted True pizza.   And if you're in the Las Vegas area, please make a visit to Settebello.  And tell your friends.",

    "text": "I have been on a gluten free diet for a few years now. It makes it difficult to get great pizza. However in Las Vegas I am lucky to have more than a handful of choices. Many places buy the gluten free crust from a supplier, this is not the case at Settebello.   It used to be that you would need to call 24 hours in advance to get their gluten free pizzas, but that policy changed about 2 months ago, so you can now get it anytime.   Everyone in our party enjoyed our pizzas and appetizers and the service was excellent. I believe them that the crust was made in house and cooked very quickly and very hot. It was by far the best gluten-free crust I've ever had anywhere in the U.S. I had mine with Buffalo Mozzarella and it was great! I will be back to try more.",

I would say my favorite was the margarita. Good portion of sauce to cheese. Diavola was good, but I could have done without the red chiles. Settebello was interesting and good. The hamburger one was not good in my opinion. The dough and bread they use is fantastic. The sauce is ok, not a fan of the toppings or how all the cheese an topping slide right off as you go to eat it. Overall, not my favorite, but a pretty good spot for Napoleon style of pizza.",

It is the stamp of approval given by the pizza making authority in Italy, and only a handful of establishments in the U.S. have been given this distinction, so if you come across any of these establishments sporting the VPN signage on their front door, you know its the real deal like you would find in Naples, All you pizza snobs stop comparing it to NY or Chicago style, because it doesn't even compare! They're trying to keep tradition and integrity by following the traditional pizza making ways as they do IN NAPLES! If you want Pepperoni or Pineapple, CALL DOMINOS!!!  Okay, done with my rant...on to my review. Been going to Settebellos ever since they were first located on Valle Verde and Horizon Ridge. It was hidden away and not too many people knew about this place until they made the move to The District. The ingredients are top-notch, and ALL their pizzas are the BOMB! I've tried everything- Margherita, Carbonara, Ripieno, etc. and my favorite, The Settebello. The ONLY way to devour all this goodness is the minute it is placed in front of you and there's no better way to finish with an Affogatto,Double espresso with a scoop of gelato. Looking forward to return again soon,,,ALOHA!!!",

The first thing that I wanted to try was the pizza and pasta of course! It was just divine. The Italians use fresh ingredients and the brick oven was the key! Settebello brought me back to Italy. I was a little skeptic because I really wanted some good pizza. My brother and a friend accompanied me on my birthday. We got our drinks right away when we were seated which is a plus for me. The waiter gave us a little more time to look at the menu because it was my first time. It was fun trying to pronounce the words but the had things that I recognized like the caprese or the cheese platter, and the meat platter which I must go back for. We settled for the carbonara pizza and the settebello. I loved that you could see the brick oven and let me tell you, when a pizza is made in a brick oven you won't be able to eat regular pizza again! The food came out and we dug in right away. The ingredients were so fresh, you could taste the basil and the herbs that were on the settebello, the yummy sausage and the mushrooms. The cheese and sauce just looked so authentic. The way they scrambled the egg on the carbonara was perfect, the flavors were bold and tasty. I really recommend anyone looking for a place to try authentic Italian pizza to try this place!",

I didn't come here to compare this to other pizza places in town, and if you are, you might be disappointed because you can't put this up against NY style or Chicago style, this is in a class of it's own......Neopolitan. Side note, this is the only VPN certified place in Las Vegas, and only one of two places in Nevada.  What we ordered...  Quattro Formaggi-Crushed Tomatoes, Fontina Cheese, Gorgonzola Cheese, Fresh Mozzarella, Parmigiano Reggiano, Basil, Extra Virgin Olive Oil, I loved the strong taste of gorgonzola cheese, my aunt's thought it was a bit overwhelming, but I love cheese.  Margherita DOC- Crushed Tomatoes,Imported Buffalo Mozzarella, Basil, Parmigiano Reggiano, Extra Virgin Olive Oil, now if you look at their menu, there is two Margherita pizzas, please choose the DOC. The difference is the imported buffalo mozzarella, and it's excellent. DOC is denominazione di origine controllata, which translates to, controlled designation of origin, basically quality assurance for food products like cheese and wine, if you have ever seen a Chianti with a pink wrapping around the cork, it will say DOCG this way you are assured it's not manipulated.    Ended the meal with Torta della Nonna, I love lemon and especially when it's a chilled tart, nothing better in the summer, but this I felt fell short of anything special. It tasted old like it had been in the made a couple days prior and sat in the fridge.   Big props for all of the ingredients they import, and list on the menu.",

We shared the Frito antipasta and Insalata Grande.  The focaccia was toasted perfectly and almost light for bread.  It paired well with the cured meats (especially the prosciutto), artichokes and bits of cheese.  The salad had super fresh ingredients and the perfectly dressed.  We ordered the Capriccosca pizza but substituted the prosciutto crudo instead of the cotto just because that's my favorite type of pizza. Definitely was not disappointed at all!",

We all asked for water except one guy who asked for a soda. So at the end the guy looks at the receipts and says \" I didn't charge you for the soda, don't worry about it\". That's because you charged me for the soda! So I politely waited and told a different server about the soda charge and it was correct but my new bill had charged an extra .50 for the meat.. Heck with it! I paid for my meal plus .50 They were nice but waiting and waiting for refills and our order was too much.    The pizzas were good. We kinda did a spread where we all shared various pizzas. My favorite was the margarita (sp). The claim to be part of a secret pizza cult and this maintain True Italian style pizza, so of your in the mood for NY/ American style pizza then this isn't the joint to goto. The pizzas come in personal style only. I do like the food. Quite a bit uppetty on their prices. But then again look at the location.  Probably wont come back, with cheaper choices elsewhere for the same flavors. Nice ambience and a great setting for a date night",

I guess she didn't like me for the rest of the night lol She was short and rude w/ us.  Basic 'hello, my name is____,' is not too much to ask for.  We ordered two different pizzas, but they looked exactly the same lol i normally would have questioned it, but I was on a 1st date so I kept my mouth shut. She never came by to ask how our food was or anything. She just dropped off the check while walking by.  The pizza was not good enough to deal w/ such bad service. Definetly not going back.",

But this past Sunday (6/11/13), we were trying out a movie at the new Galaxy theater and decided to take advantage of the opportunity to try a restaurant on that side of town. After hearing amazing things about Settebello for years, we chose it.  It was amazing!!! The pizzas on the menu are all very interesting sounding - great combinations of flavors. It was really hard to decide. We chose one tomato-based pizza and one without tomato sauce: the Settebello and the Vico. We both preferred that Vico by quite a bit, but both were amazing. They both had the same Italian sausage and buffalo mozzarella that melted into a wet, gooey sauce all over the pizza. I think what put the Vico over the edge is that in addition to the melty cheesy goodness, it has thick cream on it as well. The crust for both pizzas was perfect - doughy but not too thick. Definitely upgrade to the buffalo mozzarella for any pizza! You can do that for only $3!  Service was really nice and attentive, and the space has a great feel - open ceilings so that you can see the air ducts and a bit of the loft look. I don't know how often we'll make the drive all the way over there, but I will definitely stop in anytime I'm on that side of town!",

And, all 3 of the pizzas we had today seemed to lack ingredients and what little ingredients were included seemed to just fall right off before entering our mouths.  Now I get that the Napolean style, True Italian pizza is supposed to be \"wet\" like this.  But it was hard to eat - even with a fork and knife like they suggest.    The pizza dough and crust was very good, but sliding cheese and toppings made it too much effort.  We tried the namesake Settebello, the Diavlo, and the kids cheese & sausage.  Hands down, the DIAVLO pizza was the best!  It was spicy and unique enough to stand out and be memorable.  The Settebello was simply forgettable.  We liked that there is a kids-menu (hidden, not on the menu) for $6.50 that is plenty of food for 2 kids, much less one.    They encourage you to order an individual pizza for each adult, but you could easily share one pizza for two people (with a shared salad or appetizer).    While I wanted to love this place and had it bookmarked for several months, it just wasn't my style.  The ambience is nice and the service was good, but I will keep seeking out good pizza in this town!",

The service is really good and i like that it has a very local feel. The meatballs are really great as well.",

The zest kind of ruined the flavor of the cannoli cream for me. The staff is always incredibly friendly and professional.

    "text": "Ok, I am seriously on the fence about Settebello.  I mean, how could a place live up to all of the 5 star reviews?!  I have wanted to go here for what seems like forever, and I finally got the chance to stop in for a late lunch on a Tuesday afternoon.  I hear this place gets crowded - but you wouldn't know it from that day!  Maybe we chose the perfect time to go!  There were only a few other people in the place, most of which were in the bar area for happy hour.  We chose to sit in the main dining room (note: this place is SMALL), rather than in the bar or on the patio (still too hot for that).  Our server was friendly, but not super nice. Not sure if that makes sense, but she just seemed to be ready for her day to be over and going through the motions.    I was super excited to see the blood orange pellegrino on the menu!  The menu itself is pretty basic - about 10 different pizzas and maybe 7 appetizers.  We weren't super hungry, so we decided to share the small insalata and the quattro formaggio (4 cheese, gringos).  The salad was pretty basic, but really delicious.  It was a spring mix with a balsamic vinagrette and the best parmesan cheese slices EVER!  I could seriously just eat a wheel of that.  The pizza was really good as well.  I love the smoky flavor of the crust from the oven.  The 4 cheese pizza uses some strong cheese and not a ton of sauce, which makes for an awesome combo.  I will admit, the crust was a bit soggy, but I think that's to be expected.  Trust me when I say, I had absolutely no problems folding that slice and stuffing my face!  At first my Mom didn't really like it, but after a few bites she realized she was wrong and quickly fell in love!  Now, this could easily be a 5 star review.  BUT, our service was a bit shaky, even though we were her only table.  And I feel like it's a bit pricey - it was over $25 for my Mom and I to share a small salad, a small pizza and 2 drinks.  If the prices were lower, I could easily see me making this a regular stop.  One thing to note: there was happy hour in the bar area, and the sign advertised 1/2 priced cocktails and $5 mini pizzas, so maybe that is the time to hit this place up!",

    "text": "I'm a carnivore but I'm a fan of Margherita pizza - my test for True great pizza.  So the past few times I've been coming to Settebello, that's all I get.   I can usually eat an individual (12 inch) pizza by myself but that leaves me with no space for dessert. I've been meaning to try their Nutella pizza. A group of us decided to come here as soon as they opened at 11am and I finally got to try more than my usual green, white and red pizza.  We got started with an order of misto (charcuterie, cheese, olives and zucchini in olive oil) and caprese.  For pizzas, we got a margherita, vico, Genovese, quattro formaggi, capricciosa and settebello. We also had a Nutella pizza, cannoli, peach panna cotta and a scoop of vanilla gelato.  I'm not going into details with the charcuterie and cheese plate or the caprese since they basically, slice things and put on your plate...no special prep required.  I'm not going to discuss the margherita pizza either, all you have to know is that the crust for all their pizzas is yummy, thin and crisp - best eaten as soon as it gets served on your table. The toppings are from fresh quality ingredients and none of the synthetic stuff.  Vico: Sausage, fennel, mascarpone, fresh mozzarella, red onions, basil and EVOO. No crushed tomato sauce. 4/5  Genovese: Special pizza (not on the regular menu). Sausage, basil, caramelized onions, fresh mozzarella and shaved parmesan. No crushed tomato sauce. 5/5  Quattro Formaggi: Fontina, gorgonzola, fresh mozzarella, Parmigiano with crushed tomato sauce. 4/5  Capricciosa: Prosciutto, artichoke hearts, mushrooms, Kalamata olives, basil, fresh mozzarella, EVOO and crushed tomato sauce. 4/5  Settebello: Pancetta, pine nuts, sausage, mushrooms, fresh mozzarella, basil, EVOO and crushed tomato sauce. 5/5  Nutella Pizza: Sliced bananas baked on a pizza crust drizzled with Nutella, topped with  and dusted with powdered sugar.  I added strawberries on mine to make it more interesting. I love Nutella but I was not impressed by this dessert.  The crust could have been sweeter and  more Nutella could have been added. Looks pretty in pictures though. 3/5  Service is always great here.",

We dine here a few times a month and they are very consistently fantastic. Our go-to is the Diavola. A must-try if you like heat. I'm also a big fan of the bianca, which is fresh and light. Both beet salads are lovely.",

I must have came at just the right time...and was seated at a really, really uneven and wobbly table. While I waited , i asked the waitress to try and put something underneath so that it wouldnt be constantly moving throughout dinner.  Well..... it did.   It is VERY loud in the restaurant.  I felt like i had to shout to have a conversation with someone 6 inches away from me.  We ordered the prosciutto wrapped arugula,  which is like a little mini salad. Its about the length of a hot dog, and was a little dry for me.... i will ask for extra balsamic reduction on next time.  The peach and Prosciutto pizza wasnt on special....bummer. so, we opted for the pear and jalapeno pizza. We asked for the pizza to be cut.  Pizza came. And i am seriously wondering if they used a plastic knife to try and cut this pizza. Because when we tried to grab a slice.... we really had to tug and pull...and the toppings and cheese just slid right off.  Oooohhhhhh... And they do NOT have ranch. Not at all. So, save yourself the embarrassment of asking.  For being a thin crust pizza...it was really doughy. No crispiness, at all... dont get me wrong, it was a perfect salty, sweet, with a little bit of spice to it..but it just had no texture.  I would say i would come back.",

    "text": "I will start by saying the food was great as always, we have been here numerous times and really like the food. However the service was particularly awful, even for a place we seldom get great service. Upon arriving we were told it will be five minutes before a table is ready, no big deal. We were three people. They then seated two parties of two ahead of us, I just assumed they were tables for two people only so I didn't worry. But then a party of five was seated ahead of us while we sat in full view of the hostess and waiters seating these other groups. As we stand up to go somewhere else the guy says \"oh your table is being wiped right now\". They sit us at the worst table right in the way of everything. The waiter greets us and gets out drink orders. My sister's beer comes to the table with a fruitful in it and asks for a new one. The server immediately replaces it and assured us he watched them pour a whole new beer. He takes out order and leaves. Then instead of bringing the salad and waiting for a little bit they bring the salad and pizza at he same time. He doesn't check back even though we would have liked another round of drinks. So to sum up, the food was great as always but the service was terrible in a place I don't expect stellar service based on past experiences.",

    "text": "To save time, read Nelson's first paragraph in the very next review, then come back to mine.  I echo his sentiments there.  What makes places like this great is the thoughtfulness, and dedication to authenticity and quality that radiates throughout a restaurant.  The staff is very young, but attentive and capable, and you can tell they want to be there, or at least aren't loathing their employment.  I do feel sorry for them too having to deal with the knobs that come in angry they can't get a Pizza-Hut like disaster.  That magic oven got brought over form the Valle Verde location as well (I think), and the pizza chefs don't miss.  Dessert hits the mark every time as well.  The Bianca is my favorite, which from bottom to top includes that one-of-a-kind crust, buffalo mozz, prosciutto di parma, real parm slices, and arugula.  Messy, salty heaven.  If I do feel like tomato sauce, I'll order a margherita with pancetta and pine nuts.  I thank the pizza chef every time I leave.  This is the only place I feel the need to do this.  You should be grateful we have places like this, that Americanize nothing, and give us a treat unlike anything else in town.",

I spent $30 for an iced tea, pizza, carpaccio salad and tip and for the average working girl, it's definitely a treat and DAMN WELL WORTH EVERY PENNY!!!

What can I say other than I was not impressed? Honestly, all the food was great...except for the pizza which was too bland for my liking.  We had the Margharita with mushrooms and the Settebello I think its called. Whatever it was, it was the last one on the menu with pine nuts on it. My husband and I were both adding, oil and vinegar, salt, pepper, red pepper, anything to give it more flavor. The pizza didn't taste bad, just tasted incomplete, like it was missing seasoning. The crust was probably the best part, crispy and chewy the way it should be. But once again, not much flavor.  However, I loved my peach bellini and the homemade tiramisu was among the best I've had, although I can't say I order it too often. The foccacia starter was tasty as well. But once again, we go back to the pizza; after all, it is a pizza place, shouldn't it be the star attraction? In my opinion, I'd go to Grimaldi's instead for much more flavorful pizza.",

Settebello has a great selection of Italian micro brews. For pizza I went with the Settebello, because in my opinion if a dish is named after the restaurant's namesake it has to be good. Well my theory proved correct still. The Settebello didn't let me down. The ingredients were fresh and the pizza crust was perfect.  I will be feeding my addiction again soon.",

Being both a pizza and USC fanatic I could not resist. I arrived to the pizzeria across the street from the Cheescake Factory in Henderson and was happy to see the place packed.  I choose to sit at the bar rather than wait for a table and enjoyed a few Italian cocktails.   I decided to go simple and just ordered the classic margherita with buffalo milk mozzarella, tomato sauce and basil.  I have lived in Southern Italy and have been to Napoli a number of times and can tell you what I ate at Settebello is an exact replica of the flavors and textures I remember.   I have traveled across this country quite a bit and always go out of my way to try different pizzerias, so far this is the best pizza I have ever had in the US. Service was great and I talked the bartenders ear off for about an hour and a half.  Luckily I go to Las Vegas about once a month for business, Settebello will be on my new must eat list each time I visit.",

I was there for only 2.5 days and we ate there 3 more times!!! It was amazing!! So amazing that on our way home we heard there was one in NV and tried to locate it, however it was too far out of our way!!!  Far out of our way?....yes, but that won't stop us!! We planned a trip to Vegas around Settebello!!! We actually ONLY went to Vegas so that we could go to Settebello!!! We were in Vegas for less than 2 days and ate there 3 times (must be our magic #)!!!  There is not a bad item on their menu!!! My favorites are their Caprese salad, margherita pizza and their marghertia pizza with sausage or salame!!! They also have Nutella pizza for dessert!!! A MUST!!!!!...and amazing gelato!!!!!  I just wish that they would open a location in Orange County.  We have a place near us like Settebello, but you really can't compete with perfection!!!",

They are still in search for pizza as good as here.....which is going to be next to impossible. So here's my take on this place....very nice decor and very casual. The menu has no fried stuff.   The staff was very friendly and attentive. Ok so I had the Caprese for an appetizer.....Fresh mozzarella on a tomato with fresh basil,sea salt and covered in extra virgin olive oil...Wow was that yummy.  It was my first time to have fresh mozzarella and now its my favorite. Then I had the Margherita pizza, topped with sausage, mushroom, and fresh garlic and basil.  Its wood oven baked and very fresh. Not a Chicago style pizza, but I loved it. The cousins had the Pizza Lasagna, which had pretty much the same toppings as mine except for having evoo, and ricotta, and I didn't notice too much of a difference....but still yummy! For dessert, we had vanilla gelato in espresso...Wow was that good! A great way to end a fantastic dinner. I guess my cousins would have enjoyed the place, if they weren't looking for Chicago style food. I liked it since I was just hungry and I was impressed with the freshness of all the food.....a healthy restaurant according to one of the cousins. Its just a nice change of pace from the everyday pizza joint. Oh, they recommend not taking their pizza for take out....much better tasting fresh from the oven.",

This authentic Neapolitan style restaurant offers the most tasty apps, pizzas, desserts, you name it. I'm at one of their many locations at least twice a month. (It's a long drive for me, but it's MORE than worth it).   My FAVORITE appetizers are the misto (a sampling of the most delicious focaccia bread, Italian meats, cheeses, and veggies like artichokes and olives) and the involtini: prosciutto wrapped arugula with goat cheese and balsamic. YUM!  My FAVORITE and in my opinion, the best pizza, is the Diavola. Garlic, finochionna (spicy salami), red bell peppers, and the most mouth watering margherita style sauce, mozzarella, and crust you will ever have.   Dessert: Dream Bomba. Chocolate coated peanut butter and vanilla ice cream drizzled with caramel and chocolate fudge. So awesome!   Service is always outstanding. They are people who really care about you, your dining experience, and who always welcome you with open arms into the Settebello home!   If you're looking for somewhere uptight, please do not dine here. This is a place for happy people who love great food, great service, a relaxed environment, and superior standards.  Mangia!",

    "text": "Overall, the food was good.  Not the best in state, as it's rated, but definitely good. There were 3 of us in our party, me and 2 guys (I was a lucky girl).  We ordered the Insalata Grande to start, which was made of Mixed Greens, Fresh Tomatoes, Artichoke Hearts, Roasted Mushrooms, Olives, Pine Nuts, Cracked Pepper, Shaved Parmigiano Reggiano, and Balsamic Vinaigrette.  Definitely plenty for the 3 of us to share.  Your doctor would approve of the healthy, tasty ingredients in this salad!  We ordered 2 pizzas, Margherita DOC and the Setebello.  They're 12\" pizzas.  2 was plenty for us but if you had really big eaters, you'd probably need 1 per person.  Upon ordering, our server asked us if we wanted our pizza cut in slices. To us that was strange.  Don't they always cut pizza in slices?  Apparently, here they don't unless you ask.  We asked if we didn't get it sliced, how are we supposed to eat it?  Do we take a bite and then pass it to the next person at our table?  Very strange question we thought.  The Setebello pizza is their signature pizza so we had to try that one.  It was delicious.  Very flavorful, fresh ingredients.  The Margherita DOC pizza was good, but the Setebello blew it away.  The Margherita DOC pizza was made with crushed Tomatoes, Fresh Buffalo Mozzarella, Basil, Parmigiano Reggiano, and Extra Virgin Olive Oil.  The Setebello pizza was made with Crushed Tomatoes, Pancetta, Wood Oven Sausage, Roasted Mushrooms, Toasted Pine Nuts, Mozzarella, Basil, and Extra Virgin Olive Oil. The crust reminded me of a flour tortilla.  It was soft and even burnt like a tortilla you would warm up on the stove.  Not my favorite crust.  I wish it was a little crispier.  Now, dessert was the best!  We ordered the Chocolate Bomba.  It was a caramel, chocolate ice cream dessert that was to die for.  We devoured it in minutes!  Definitely the best part of the meal!  We agreed that it tasted like a Snickers bar ice cream dessert.    Our server, Jason, was awesome.  He gave us recommendations on what to order and was right on with what were the best menu selections.  It's so hard to come by good servers in restaurants today, and he was awesome!  The restaurant is casual but was a little loud, which made it kind of hard to converse over dinner.  We would definitely come back to this restaurant again, but all agree it's not the best pizza in Vegas. It's good, but not the best.",

    "text": "Quite possibly the best pizza my mouth has ever tasted.  I ended up coming to Settebello for lunch to celebrate a friend's birthday. The restaurant is located in the District. When you first walk into the restaurant you will be greeted by a friendly hostess and walked to your table. The decor consists of dark wood and granite which makes you instantly feel that you are in a high end pizzeria.   Service wise, they seemed to be short on staff when we came in. Our server seemed to also be the bartender for the day shift, but I can see that she was trying to show us as much attention as possible. I also brought a cake from a bakery prior to meeting at Settebello and asked the server to put it in the back until we were done with our meal.   I ordered the Vico, which blew my mind. I wouldn't call myself a pizza enthusiast but I know what good pizza tastes like. The pizza isn't loaded down with oil and has no tomato sauce which makes it very light. The pizza consisted of yummy sausage, fennel, mozzarella and mascarpone (no tomatoes). It was frickin delicious. I'm obsessed with the crust, which was  thin but not tastless and chewy in the middle. Highly recommended.  Overall it was great experience.  If you're anywhere near the Henderson area, you must try this place out.",

It is a complete bait switch with what they advertise as far as toppings. Why don't you just offer a pineapple and Canadian bacon because the supposed prosciutto is closer to Canadian bacon than it is the actual prosciutto. Very disappointed in the toppings. I don't give out too many poor reviews but I was very disappointed in this. Not even close to an average pizza Napoletana. A sad man leaving.",

Wife had a glass of their white sangria. We ordered the vegetable, cheese and meat antipasta appetizer which was good, I felt the cheese could have been better options, I did really enjoy the olives, spicy marinated zucchini and meats served with this app. For entrees my wife had the bolognese pizza (as I mention before she loved) and I had the Settebello pizza, named after the restaurant or vise versa. For having this name the pizza was underwhelming. The sausage was bland, the pine nuts didn't add to the dish, plus the pizza got soggy quickly, I prefer a crispy crust. I did enjoy the crushed pizza sauce. For dessert we ordered the mint chip gelato and panna cotta, both were very good. The restaurant was busy and in a great location within the district.",

    "text": "I know this review has been months in the making but most of it was written out and I just forgot to complete it.  Settebello deserves the full 5 star rating from me first because of their excellent customer service.  I setup a reservation for a group dinner for 15 people, it was officially a UYE but I'm sure they had no idea it was a herd of Yelpers coming who would most likely analyze everything about the experience and rip them for anything bad in a review, unless someone had spilled the beans.  Anyways they knew to bring their A game that night.  Everything from the first phone conversation with one of the managers, to us showing up at the reservation time and having them already ready, to almost completely accommodating our large party, which was set for 15 then grew to 20+ on an already busy night, to getting all our orders, drinks, and checks, and to not kicking us out after when we were just hanging out and talking story was perfect for me wanting to go back ASAP. Shall we try for 30 people next time!? They're an excellent place for large group dining.  They also deserve the 5 star rating because of the good. I already knew I was going to enjoy the delicious pizza creations coming out from their wood burning brick ovens being featured on one my favorite food tv shows Unique Eats. Do you know how many times I've seen the same clip of Settebello' s on my giant screen HD TV before I gave in? A bunch of times and many times I was hungry and drooling over the what I saw. I had the Settebello Pizza, why not, they put their name on it so It better be it's best. Did I enjoy it? Of course I did. Crushed tomatoes, pancetta, wood oven sausage, roasted mushrooms, toasted pine nuts, fresh mozzarella, basil, extra virgin olive oil. Everything about it was excellent better than the TV. Even the President just had to have some Settebello. The personal pizza size is plenty for one or 2 people. I'd suggest ordering 2 different pizzas and halving them.  They are located East of Green Valley Parkway across the street from The District and a nice walk from Green Valley Ranch Casino. They have an excellent happy hour running M-F 3PM-6PM for $5 mini pizzas and another thing but I forgot. They also just opened their new location near Sahara and Fort Apache.",

Well I was not told any of this on the phone, if I was aware of this, I wouldn't have drove up there just for the pizza. I made sure to call because we had this same $5 all day Margherita pizza at the one In Oxnard, CA so this is why I double checked if they had the same thing going on here. Very disappointed. I believe the person I spoke with was Carla: the communication needs to be a Lil better. I was not about to wait a hour to get this pizza.

If you want simple quadro is great and don't get the pizza cut- that is part of the fun. You can taste the way it is made, some parts of it are \"Burnett\" and some doughy, but that's how a real pizza from a real pizza oven should be- and it's better that way.   The ambiance is solid, but after having begun to go to Dui Forni with its italian 60's-ish vibe, it loses a star in that department, but great Naples- style pizza, a must for the family or a casual night out.",

However, there is a very strong and distinct smokey wood after taste on the pizza. I'm wondering if it is because we are here right when they opened and maybe the ovens are still smokey. Bottom line I don't like that smokey taste on any thing let alone my pizza. Because of this, unfortunately I have to rate this pizza a 3 stars. Btw the service was good, we did not wait long either so this review is based strictly on my dislike for smokey tasting food. My girlfriends loved her pizza smoke and all!

    "text": "My favorite pizza anywhere.  They're all personal sized.  You can eat it all and be full, or get a salad and save half the pizza for later.  I haven't tried dessert yet, but they have a Nutella dessert pizza!  Authentic Napoletana pizza, with many of their ingredients imported from Italy.  My favorite choices are the Bianca (Prosciutto Crudo, Arugula, Parmigiano Reggiano, Mozzarella, Extra Virgin Olive Oil), the Vico (Wood Oven Sausage, Sauteed Fennel, Red Onions, Mascarpone, Mozzarella, Basil, Extra Virgin Olive Oil), and the Emilia (Prosciutto Cotto, Panna (Italian Cream), Fresh Mozzarella, Parmigiano Reggiona, Basil, Extra Virgin Olive Oil).  I guess I don't like crushed tomatoes :/  You can add other veggies, meats, cheese, or pine nuts for additional cost.",

    "text": "Thanks to the reviewers at Yelp, I found this place on a recent trip to Vegas. Why do places like Papa John's (how do they even call that junk pizza?) and Pizza Hut exist when there are places like this around? Because we live in 'Merica, that's why. Places such as those I just mentioned have their place, such as squashing an intense munchie session or mopping up spills at the supermarket. However, when you want top-notch ingredients and awesome flavor, this is the place.  It may not be $5 for a pizza (I think it was $13 for the one I ordered) but it was more than sufficient and very flavorful.",

    "text": "How strange it is to give a restaurant four stars... but plan to never return there again.  As I said in another review, I've never been to Italy, but Settebello's concoctions make it easy to pretend otherwise. Even the flour for their dough comes from Naples!  I ordered the margherita with roasted mushrooms and pine nuts, mindful of the advice on the menu not to get more than two toppings. At this point I realized that the pizzas here were probably of the \"pick up a piece and watch the whole slice point south\" variety, something I've been trying to get away from since moving to Las Vegas, but - shrug - the restaurant was serene and I like trying new things.  Service was friendly and very fast, the kind where your drink is refilled before it's finished (unless you're my husband, who quaffs his lemonade like a Viking fresh from the pillage), although we were the only ones there for most of the meal, having arrived when it opened. (After shopping, when we walked past again, business seemed much busier.)  When our pizzas arrived, my eyes lit up at the outer crust - mmm, pillowy! The basil leaves were brown around the edges, but the ingredients were so flavourful and fresh that I have to assume it's one of those \"professionally wilted\" situations that I'm too uncouth to know about.   Sure enough, the pizza was dangly/drippy if you picked it up, but the components were so good that I didn't mind turning to knife and fork for this one. As my husband more or less said in his review, not every pizza is meant to be suitable for eating while on the sofa.  Unfortunately, I have an aversion to anything that tastes burned, even if it's done deliberately. I ended up leaving much of that beautiful outer crust on the plate because the sooty smears underneath weren't to my taste. Others may enjoy this \"charred\" aspect, though.  When I looked over at my husband's pizza, I noticed that his was a little less soggy than mine. Dang. Mine may as well not have had a crust once you got two-and-a-half inches (I just mentally measured) from the outside rim. This was really regrettable, since crust is very important to me when I eat pizza.   There are only so many mouthfuls of cheese, bit of sauce, and perhaps a pine nut or mushroom that a person can eat. I'd requested my pizza sliced, and the first slice was a True treat. The individual ingredients had a flavour that fills the whole mouth. The second slice was nice. The third slice had me glancing at the dessert menu, eager for variety. (That \"torta della nonna\" with the lemon cream over pastry with almonds sounds divine.)   I didn't get dessert, though, because no way did I want to take this wet mess - however expertly made - home, so I soldiered on, using up my hunger on that third piece. The final slice I tried to pick at, but while I'm frugal, I'm not a trash can. I gave up. But hey, you can't fault a restaurant for being too generous with their \"individual\" portion sizes.  Upon reflection, for me Settebello is a case of the pizza not being greater than the sum of its parts. The cheese was salty and savoury, the mushrooms earthy, the pine nuts soft and woody, and the sauce rustic and not sweet.... but without enough crust to pull these tastes together, the dish failed for me.   However, the experience was worth it, and anyone who likes Italian-style pizza that follows the VPN (Vera Pizza Napoletana) guidelines will no doubt be popping by Settebello whenever time and wallet permit.",

We sat outside on their charming patio, the atmosphere had an old-fashion Sicilian style which was very inviting.  Secondly, our food was awesome! My wife and I spilt the insalata grande (big & delicious salad) and the Settebello pizza. We loved the brick-oven style pizza with the thin crust plus the pine nuts, mushrooms, sausage, and tomatoes added so much favor.

    "text": "What great pizza!  And gelato!  My husband is gluten free so he sometimes has to opt for a salad when we go to a pizza place, but not at Settebello!  Hands down, they have the best gluten free pizza we have had to date.  There are at least three other restaurants within a two to three mile radius that make gluten free pizza but they don't even come close in comparison!  Because the gluten free pizza in most restaurants is usually just a step up from cardboard, the rest of my non gluten free family usually orders a regular crust.  So when we dined we had a settebello on gluten free crust as well as a regular crust Quattro Formagio.  The gluten free crust was even better than the regular.  My husband swore they must have given him the wrong pizza or mixed up our order.  The waiter mentioned the gluten free crust would take a few extra minutes.  The regular crust pizza was way soggy in the center - maybe because it had to wait for the gluten free pizza to be ready? We found out they import their gluten free flour from Italy and it's the same brand as their regular crust flour, just the gluten free version.  We have loved their pizza for years before finding out about my husbands allergy but have to admit we had stayed away.  My daughter really wanted pizza so we went in not expecting that everyone would be able to eat pizza.  Have to say it great.  The crust on the gluten free was actually crusty and tasty!  The service was great and attentive.  We also ordered gelato and it was divine!  We can't wait to go back.",

Back then it was located on Horizon Ridge and has since moved to it's current location.  Back then I thought it was the best pizza in town so it's nice to see that they have done well enough to relocate to some prime real estate in The District.    This isn't your typical New York or Chicago style pizza.  It is classic Naples all the way.  Settebello uses the freshest ingredients and has by far the best crust I've ever had.  There are numerous house special pizzas you can order or one can make their own including any number of toppings.  The pizzas are delicious and the perfect individual size.  You can eat a whole one without feeling super heavy after.       If you're in Vegas, you have to stop by Settebello.  Whether you're a local or on the strip, it will definitely be worth your while.",

    "text": "If you come here expecting pizza with a crisp crust, sauce full of Italian spices and smothered with melted, shredded mozzarella; you will be truly disappointed. Conversely, if you come here with an open mind and ready to experience something new (or if you watched the Naples episode of Anthony Bourdain's \"No Reservations\"), then you will love it.   This pizzeria follows the \"Vera Pizza Napolitana\" guidelines in preparing their pizza (visit their website for an explanation at <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fsetebello.net&s=1e4d1b9e5eeb9968dde02ca8c8c4b667767132a007ff992ce1de890f8d8f3357\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">setebello.net</a>). This results in a pie that has a crisp outer crust, but a soggier middle due to the more viscous sauce and water released from the fresh mozzarella. Which is why the pie is not cut, and eaten with a knife and fork, like they do in Naples.  What we ate: Panzanella salad (light dressing, nice bite from arugula and red onion, and a cool finish with the cucumber), Margherita DOC (clean and simple flavors, tasty crust) and Settebello (tasty sausage and interesting addition of pine nuts) pizza, and Cannoli (crisp shell, authentic ricotta and candied fruit filling).  Service was good and decor was neat and not overdone (was there to eat, not judge interior design). Overall, great experience and now on my \"must go to\" list.",

It's a cute little pizzeria located in a shopping center across from Green Valley Ranch. We arrived around 8:30 and there was a 15-20 minute wait for a table so we decided to sit at the bar since it was wide open. We started off with the Insalata Grande; Mixed Greens, Artichoke Hearts, Pine Nuts, Roasted Mushrooms, Tomatoes, Olives, Parmesan Reggiano with a balsamic vinaigrette. It was a delicious!   For pizza we decided to choose two and share. Our first choice, Pizza Lasagna; Crushed Tomatoes, Wood Oven Roasted Fennel Sausage, Roasted Mushrooms, Ricotta Cheese, Mozzarella, Parmigiana Reggiano, Basil, Extra Virgin Olive Oil and our second choice...Capricciosa Pizza; Crushed Tomatoes, Prosciutto Cotto, Artichoke Hearts, Roasted Mushrooms, Olives, Mozzarella, Basil, Extra Virgin Olive Oil. The pizza lasagna was my favorite! The dough was thin, chewy and had a great charcoal flavor. Next time I would ask for the pizza to be well done so it comes out a bit crispy. Each pizza bursted with flavors from the fresh ingredients and the flavorful crust.   I'm from NY and know good pizza and I have to say these guys are doing a great job.

I ordered mine uncut so I could eat it like the Italians!    The crushed tomatoes were perfect.  The basil was perfect.  The mozzarella was SO AMAZINGLY GOOD.  The crust was perfect.  The pancetta was just a bit rubbery, I was hoping it would get toasted up in the oven.  Overall this was a REALLY good pizza and I would come back, but stick with the plain Margherita.  And I'd bring a friend so I can try the Caprese salad.  This pizza wouldn't take home - definitely eat it fresh.    Never having had this style of pizza, I really have nothing to compare it to.  I would recommend that you come with an open mind - it is what it is.  It is NOT NY pizza.",

I ordered the Lasagna Pizza and I was the last one to get my pizza in a party of around 15 people. Others who ordered after me got theirs prior, so an \"F for service. then when it fianally arrived, the dough was very dry and rubbery overly chewy and overall very bland tasting pizza. The only reason I inhaled the pie was because by the time I got served, I was starving from waiting such a long time. needless to say after dropping over 25 bucks for one pie and some water, I will not be back there again!",

The pizzas were excellent, filled with flavor and excellent toppings.  The crust was chewy and perfect.  We had a misto platter of assorted meats and cheese, which was excellent, as well as a very good caprese salad.  To finish it off, we had delicious panna cotta, which had a great flavor and texture.  Overall a superb meal.  Only real downsides were the soda was kind of flat on the first glass I had, and when they brought the second one, it was worse, so I sent the second one back without drinking it and asked for water.  When the bill came they did not take it off, which I thought was kind of cheap...I mean, I drank half a glass of weak coke and you don't just take it off when I tell you it was not very good and was getting worse?  Whatever.  Also, the service was slow...I mean the food took quite a while to come out, and the server, while not rude or anything, was far from being friendly.  She just seemed like she was doing the motions, trying to seem pleasant...if that makes sense.  Overall, a great meal though.",

Hubby ordered the diavolo and thought it was good. It was ok for me. Thin crust, soggy in the middle. I ordered the margherita pizza and asked if they had fresh spinach. Nope- no spinach. What? Ok so got it after a short wait. For those that don't know, it is plain pizza with tomato sauce, buffalo cheese, basil, garlic. There was 3 tiny pieces of basil. People- for $10 can u put at least 6 or 7 basil pieces - u are making a profit. Thin soggy crust, cheap toppings for high prices. I will say their panna cotta was good.

Our group of four girls shared a pizza with artichoke hearts, roasted red peppers and mushrooms, along with the caprese starter and a salad.  I loved the interesting and fairly priced selection of Italian wines, and my smoky-tasting red matched the pizza perfectly.  To show how tasty their toppings were, I even ate all the mushrooms -- and I typically despise mushrooms!  The reason for the four stars?  The tomatoes in the caprese were big, but didn't taste super fresh and juicy like I would expect, given how great their other ingredents were.  Also, the service was bleh, verging on rude.    I didn't dock a star for this, but I was surprised at the lack of ambience.  I mean, I understand it's a strip mall in Henderson, but I wasn't prepared for the utter blandness, almost quick casual vibe of the place.  Just something to be aware of when you go -- which you most definitely should!",

We both have this love for pizza and have been to many Pizzerias throughout CA, UT, AZ, NV, HI, and NY. We mutually agree that this restaurant is in our top 10.   Upon entering we were greeted by a group of very friendly staff who let us know that it would be a few minutes before we would be seated. Being that it was 6pm on a Friday night we were expecting to wait at least 10 minutes to be seated. It only took a few minutes. We decided to order the Bianca and the Settebello which only took about 6-8 minutes to make. Throughout the meal our waiter was very attentive and made sure our glasses were always full.   The food was great but our only complaint was that our pizza only had 4 tiny pieces of basil and when we asked if we can have extra they said they needed to charge us. They charged me an extra $1 for 4 extra pieces. My girlfriend works for a high end catering company and my brother works for a 4 star fine dining restaurant in the Wynn and never have we been charged or even questioned for something so small.   Anyways, the food is amazing and the service is equally great. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who loves great brick oven pizza.",

I also believe that good food can wait, so unless a restaurant has atrocious service, I don't really take into considering how many time the waitress refilled my drink or if they did everything I wanted.  I only care about taste and quality.  Allow me to also mention that this pizza is unique.  Do NOT come here expecting Chicago, New York or California style pizza.  It's called Napoletana for a reason (there are strict guidelines regulating genuine certified napoletana pizza, upheld by an association in Italy).  Sounds a little too much perhaps?  Maybe you shouldn't come here then.    If you do decide to try a something unique and fresh, I commend you.  Nearly anything is good.  The settobello is wonderful, however all pizzas should be eaten there.  Unfortunately, the thin crust absorbs the juices on top and doesn't last more than maybe, 20 minutes.   The ingredients are very fresh, food very delicious.  I have been here maybe 10 times within the year and have never been disappointed with a single pizza or antipasta.",

The menu has info about the grill, how pizza is made, and where the ingredients come from. I got a simple margherita pizza. Whoa. the crust was thin and delicious and there were big pieces of basil all over. The pizza is big too! We each of course finished it we couldnt let it go to waste. I also got a lemon dessert that i had to take tiny  bites of to savor the flavor. I will definitely be coming back here. Often and soon. Oh yes and the service was outstanding.

The folks at Settebello's figured out the right mix of ingredients between the greens, artichoke hearts, mushrooms, pine nuts, parmigiana, and (the key) vinaigrette (seriously, folks... all too many salads are absolutely drenched in dressing and, thus, inedible). It's rare when it's a salad (especially at a pizza place!) that makes me want to go back for more and more.... but, when it is, well, you know it's a special place.

I don't know True Neopolitan from a hole in the wall, but I know sometimes \"holes in the wall\" are family restaurants with the best food.  The mag also said the meats were done by Mario Batalli's father.  Okay, done - I suggested it as dinner before the movie we were going to see at Green Valley Ranch.  I have travelled a lot, and you know you can't get real Italian gelato or pizza in America, and that has been the fact since this place.  I don't have superlatives enough to describe the greatness of this food.  All the pizzas we have tried are simply spectacular, thin crusts with a little char on them from the real oven they use.  The calzone (they call it something else) is really really really really to die for!  Desserts, perfect!  I want to share this, but I want to keep it to myself because I hate crowds - however, they are open 11 a.m. to something like 11 at night, so you don't have to go right at dinner, you can go early,which is what we like to do.

    "text": "This new wave of Neapolitan pizza is very welcomed, as it is a great new edition to the NY (yum), Chicago (YUM!), and California (eh) styles that have dominated here for years. Settebello, much like the the other Neapolitan joints I have tried, concerns itself with quality ingredients, which is the most important key to a good pie, regardless of the style. On our visit, we had the Diavola and the namesake Settebello pizzas. Both were nifty little numbers. The only part that was lacking was a slightly soggy middle, which is a common side effect from the Neapolitan style of cooking. In addition to the pizza, Settebello offers a decent wine list at reasonable prices. The location is in a strip mall. And while they tried jazzing it up with some \"Old World\" looking touches (executed with varying degrees of commitment), it still feels like you are in a strip mall. Our service was just jake. Settebello is not the type of experience that would prompt me to drive across the valley (it is about as far from my house as anywhere in the Vegas area), but it is a superb option if I find myself in the same hood.",

We have been coming to settebello for years and today was a disgrace , our appetizer didn't come out until our pizza , then I found a BUG crawling in my pizza and the waiters response was \"well I can assure you it didn't go in the oven that way \" well you got that one right ! How was that any type of response ? It's a joke then my boyfriends parents pizza came out they are kosher and specifically asked for no meat and yet there was meat on the pizza! We  sent it  back and we waited once again . And our waitress was never to be found ever word of advice settebello train your employees and chefs the correct way to avoid disgusting mistakes and rookie mistakes as a restaurant . HUGE disappointment sad to say we will never be back .",

    "text": "The two star \"I've experienced better\" rating is more than apt in this instance.  The decor of Settebello is very nice and the ovens are cool to look at. It's really easy to get all jazzed about the wood fired oven and unique toppings and flavor combinations. Hell, the website does enough boasting about how original and special the restaurant is. But it all comes down to the food and this pizza just was not good.  At the most basic level your margherita pizza should be the star. And it wasn't. The crust was flavorless and overcharred. Here's my unecessarily lengthy analogy: You know when you make grilled cheese (and c'mon, everyone makes 2 at a time, how could you eat just one?) and the first one comes out perfect but the second one comes out kinda messed up because the pan is probably too hot and there's not enough butter to help the bread brown correctly and the cheese doesn't fully melt because the thing is going to burn if you leave it on any longer? Well this is how my pizza was, it seemed hastily cooked over too high heat and lacked flavor. Not to mention the sauce was bland and the cheese was amorphous and too stringy. There was exactly one basil leaf on my pizza too and it was burnt to a crisp. All in all, a poor excuse for something so full of itself. Needless to say I was disappointed in a major way with this whole thing.",

The thin, chewy crust with large charred air pockets, combined with the simplicity of the crushed tomatoes, fresh Mozzarella di Bufala, and basil leaves makes for the perfect pizza in my book.  Settebello executes this perfectly, and I appreciate how humble they are about it. Though they offer a unique, authentic product that many people are not familiar with, they are not snobbish about it in the least. Despite their style of pizza's serving manner (unsliced and to be eaten with fork and knife), they gladly offer to slice the pizza for you any way you would like. This is a great way to prevent the customer from feeling alienated while still offering a quality authentic product.  I have tried the Margherita DOC and the Carbonara, and enjoyed both of them greatly. I wish that the egg on the Carbonara was left whole with the yolk runny, as I have seen it served in other pizza shops offering eggs on pizza. However, I'm sure they would accommodate this request if asked.  Prices are reasonable: $10-13 a person for pizza.  I am so glad this place exists!",

Settebello is the awesome pizza place you thought you'd find in Italy but never did. The quality is insanely consistent (I've eaten here probably 50x and have never had a bad pie!).

The waiters and serving staff is comprised of mostly younger high schoolers, who are chatty with one another and not super attentive. If you're looking for great quality pizza and service and don't mind price, I'd encourage you to go to Grimaldi's. If you want pizza that's a few inches above good AND in the District while price is a factor in your decision, check out Balboa Pizza.",

It is chamomile infused vodka with some other things poured atop chamomile infused whipped cream in a champagne glass - presents well and taste yummy.

Ordered: Vica - Wood Oven Sausage, Sauteed Fennel, Red Onions, Mascarpone, Mozzarella, Basil, Extra Virgin Olive Oil  Diavola - Crushed Tomatoes, Finnochiona (Peppered Salame), Roasted Red Bell Peppers, Crushed Red Peppers, Garlic, Mozzarella, Extra Virgin Olive Oil   The server was cool and pointed out that we had just ordered 2 white pizzas. He suggested we could ad tomato sauce to the Diaviola which ended up being pretty tasty.   Then we couldn't resist and ended up ordering 3 desserts.   They have 12 pizzas to choose from, all looked pretty damn good. I am also a huge fan of the thin crust.   Not a huge selection of wine's but it was just enough for a class pizza joint.",

We had the Insalada grande which has roasted mushrooms, artichokes and the best olives in a fantastic mix of greens and an arugula salad which has a lemony dressing which is simply amazing.  We all three had our own pizzas, one Setebello for the meat eater and a Quatro Formaggio with buffalo mozzarella instead of the Gorgonzola which in my opinion overwhelms the other three cheeses. All I can say is this is killer pizza, the best in the Vegas area. Waitstaff is awesome and attentive and always a wonderful experience here, never fails to impress!",

I sat at the bar...the bartender tells me they NEVER have chicken on pizza so it is my lucky day (most pizzas do have pork so I would have built my own if the special did not exist)...  so my special pizza had...chicken marinated in serrano peppers, lime, honey, onions and garlic on a white pizza (no sauce) - mozzarella and parmesan, with fresh basil and AVOCADO...yes!!!!  I have had cooked avocado-potato pizza at Star in Houston but they put fresh avocado on top...  honestly, I loved the heat (serrano slices on pizza and I added red chile flake) and the way the crust tasted...so thin in middle but the outer crust was so delish I kept dipping it in the minimal chicken juices left on the plate.  I finished the whole thing.  I hope they put that on the menu permanently. MMMM! - see pics!  UPDATE 6/1/10: The last 2 times I have been (see pics) I have ordered unusual things - I added lemon slices to one of the pizzas, and last time I got the pizza bianco and subbed bresaola for the prosciutto - I saw that the list of toppings did not include bresaola but they had it on a salad.  It is cured beef similar to prosciutto but a good sub for non-pork-eaters.  They did not charge extra and it was yummy (needed a squeeze of lemon that came with my tea for acid).",

Have counted on Yelper's opinions since discovering this place living in San Francisco. Anyways, there's a particular style of pizza I'm searching for, and thought this might be it. For anybody that  grew up in Oregon, and was raised on Pietros, Abby's, Shakey's, etc they know the kind of pizza I'm seeking. Usually I've been able to locate at least one in most big cities, like Village Host in the Bay Area, but the search is long. When the crisp, thin flatbread crust was described here, I had to try them out. It's exactly what I'm searching for.  I liked the pizza, and the service was great. The only drawback was (and it's probably not anybody's fault but my own), it seems I don't really love authentic Naples pizza. There was too much olive oil on it,  and the basil was overbearing.  Loved the crust, and the sausage, and the sauce. Service was outstanding, and the price reasonable. Just not my place exactly. I'm looking for a Shakey's-style pizza (if it can be found in this city). Anybody knows of one, or runs across one please let me know. Certainly that place is somewhere in Las Vegas.",

Ordered the Bianca which had white sauce with procuitto, shaves of parmesan and fresh arugula! Scrumptious! Also tried the Settebello which had red sauce, mushrooms and sausage. Very tasty and tomato sauce was light, the sausage was not greasy or heavy.",

    "text": "Settebello is definitely the best Italian pizza i've had outside of Italy.  Their crust is bubbly, chewy and delicious.  They have some nice salads and a yummy focaccia (this is really just their pizza crust baked with some oregano and sea salt, but delicious none the less).  Great sangria, coctails, and espresso.  Unfortunately, their iced and hot teas are lipton (lame!!).  The margherita pizza is delicious, as is the four cheese (with gorgonzola and ricotta, yum!).  Their cannolis are good, traditional with dried fruit and chocolate chips but the shells and cream were both a little thick.  Their gelato is also good, but very airy and not dense like traditional gelato (great flavors though, including a seasonal apricot).  Comfortable atmosphere with tables and booths (props) and well worth the drive across town.  Five stars based on their pizza alone- delicious!",

I would recommend the Divola has a hint of spicy , I have tried others and this is my favorite and the misto plate with a selection of meats and grilled zucchini olives and cheese served with focaccia it's a meal on its own. They just built a shaded patio which you can get happy hour at 2 for 1 drinks at the bar and patio the sangria is very refreshing on a hot summer day. The Nutella pizza is excellent if you still have room as well and the dream bomba dessert . I will warn you this not your typical pizza place it's not that over stuffed super cheesy tons of meat on pizza it's a light fresh flavorful classic napoletana pizza I walk out feeling satisfy without that over stuffed feeling . I love it . Lastly I will say I agree with other this service stuff is hit or miss sometimes simply terrible . It's a young college crowd waitstaff and at times I almost feel I am an inconvenience asking for a new clean plate or an extra napkin. It's almost like its a chore to serve us . At times not friendly and they seem annoyed . The hostess girls in the from have always been great and always get my order accurately and on time when I get to go but the servers can be hit or miss as I have said they need better customer service skills. So it's all about the food here not the service that's what makes me keep coming back !! Walk in with an open mind and try it !",

Really good as I did not expect it to overwhelm my taste buds.  But it did!  I think it was the freshly shave parm cheese.  And then came the pizza which was extremely tasty.  I had the marguarita with sausage.   Good atmosphere but a little pricey for a pizza.  Will probably return but need to be in a good mood to want to spend for a fancy, trendy pizza style.",

This organization requires that they restaurant only use specific raw ingredients to create the dough, and that the dough be worked only with the hands. Also, the pizza shoul only be cooked directly on the surface of a bell shaped pizza oven that is fueled solely by wood. The organization also requires they use a specific type of tomatoes and only fresh milk or buffalo milk mozzarella is acceptable.  BITE INTO THAT!!!",

I started with a white sangria...no fruits, and it tasted like a watered down limoncello. This was followed by the beet salad....EVERYONE knows that you canNOT toss soft cheeses, such as brie or goat cheese, in a salad, it has to be added after the toss. Otherwise this happens: \"Where's the cheese? Why do the beets look like they have mold growing on them?\" Yes, this happened....for reals. Now about that pizza. First, it was watery and burnt - that is a feat that seems impossible, but it happened....for reals. The top was soggy and watery. The crust was \"purposely overcooked\" - but the charred flavor of the crust was overwhelming enough for me to put the slice down and start feeling like my stomach was developing cancer. I will not come back, and I REFUSE to recommend or bring anyone here.",

Dozens of ways to fuel that oven. Dozens, maybe hundreds of toppings to choose from AND infinite ways to combine them. You get the point right?  So with that understanding, I must preface my 3 star review by making my pizza tastes public. There are three ratings on my Iron Chef judging sheet.  1) Thickness of the crust (in my case the thinner the better) 2) Texture of the crust (crunchy, crispy, chewy, ALWAYS) 3) Red sauce (savory, tangy, sweet, not overpowering)  I give the pizza 3 out of 5 stars all the way down. I would definitely go back for a slice or two. Does it compare to my NYC slice, or Pizza al metro in the alleys of Florence? Not up in here....NOT UP IN HEAYA!!",

Our waitress was serving the bar and the patio, but both were dead. I watched her cleaning the bar the entire time I waited. Three people including our server came outside, and I was never once asked what I wanted to drink. She then came over to the table to set down our plates for dessert, said \"oh, we added one more\" and never came back. I still didn't have a drink, and had to ask the host when he came over with the dessert. We also had to ask him for refills because she never came back to the table.

During lunch, they offer 8-inch personal pizza instead of the regular 12-inch pizzas, for a few bucks less.  We shared the carbonara and margherita doc.  Both were very delicious.    Service was quick.  After our lunch, we walked over to Whole Foods to shop for our dinner items.",

    "text": "Update: 3/3/18: Another visit with Tyler. Tried the Misto Appetizer Platter. Was very good. We would definitely order that again. Tried a Reutberger Dunkel & loved it. Stuck with the Settebello Pizza, adding olives to my half.  We also found out that the L'Ubriaco is wonderful served with the Mint Chocolate Chip Gelato, too! Another great trip thanks to our favorite server, Tyler, & the wonderful chefs at Settebello's!!! 8/14/17: We've returned again several times since my original post. Most of the time we get Tyler and his helper, Claire, both are very wonderful. We get better service here than we do in most upscale restaurants! The food is always amazing too!!! Tyler was our server today & was amazing as ever. We started with our usual Involtini which is just unbelievably amazing! Why can't all salads taste so great! Then we had our favorite Settebello Pizza which turned out just heavenly!!! Tyler suggested a new dessert called L'Ubriaco, a vanilla gelato with four different alcohols poured over it.  It is so amazing to taste, just absolutely dreamy!  It was a plus that my husband & I were sharing as the dessert was rather strong. We were discussing the wonderful flavors and that they would also go well with biscotti & Tyler kindly brought out a little bite of biscotti for us to try.  Tyler was truly wonderful! He never left us waiting or wanting for anything.  Thank you Tyler!!!",

    "text": "Settebello has been our go-to pizza joint since we moved to Henderson. Their gluten free pizza is the best I've ever had!  They used to have a special on Mondays - $5 margherita pizzas all day. I won't lie - we woujld get 2 of them, gluten free, and at least 1 of the 2 would be eaten by the time we got home less than 20 minutes away.    Their gluten free crust is out of this world. I love it when the crust gets a little charred - adds so much flavor to an already delicious pizza. The crust isn't paper thin which is good - it is thinner, but the crust is still soft and flavorful. You can't go wrong with wood fired anything!  Their ingredients are good quality - their pizzas are simple and to the point. Delicious, perfectly executed, and consistently good service. Always ask what their special is that week, and definitely get a drink- they have plenty of good ones at the bar!",

We wanted simple Italian and ordered a simple insalata which was delicately dressed and not soggy.  The crust of the pizza was not heavy, had good bite and flavor with the right balance of savory and spice -so good!  The location is good too and you can take a nice walk after dinner to balance the carbs.",

    "text": "Excellent pizza, very slow service.  Came here with my boyfriend and my parents for a late lunch. The total meal ended up taking almost 2 hours. The food was excellent; however, waiting so long for our meal was painful. Here's the breakdown:  Service: Our server was super nice; however, there seemed to be some kitchen issues. As I said above, it took almost 2 hours to get 3 pizzas, which is not acceptable, especially when the place wasn't busy at all.   Food: TASTY! The food quality and flavor is what earned this place 4 stars.  We ordered: 2 Settebellos- Amazing! Fresh ingredients and perfect thin crust.  1 Capricciosa- Delicious! I couldn't stop eating it. Every toping was fresh and of high quality. The dough was great. Thin and cooked perfectly. Softer in the center, but crispy on the crust. The sauce was delicate and complimented the toppings' flavors nicely.   1 Kid's Margherita with added prosciutto- my mom loved this! She ate all of it and she usually never finished anything. She kept raving about the favors even after we got home.  1 Rucola- Loved the dressing!  1 Beet Salad- I really enjoyed this, but it's a very different salad. The warm goat cheese was very good and so were the beets. You have to really like beets to enjoy this salad.   Atmosphere: Nice. Nothing special and much more on the casual side.   Prices: Great. I would actually pay a lot more than what they charge because the quality and flavor of the pizza is so excellent.  Overall, I will be back, but not when I'm in a hurry! Fantastic pizza and good salads. If you're in the mood for pizza and you like thin crust come here, you won't be disappointed.",

    "text": "Slice of Heaven! Service was on mark! Most delicious pizza in Vegas!  This is just a few quotes from local papers that describe what you get at Settebello. From Yelpers to friends, if you bring up great tasting pizza in Las Vegas, Settebello is what comes up. I'm almost embarrassed to admit that this was my first time to try Settebello's pizza.  Yes, I love food.  Yes, I Yelp.  And Yes, I enjoy a good pizza every now and then.  So, what has stopped me all these years is the opportunity to try Settebello.  Well, with $1 Margherita Pizza Night, I could not resist any longer.  It's all about a great tasting Margherita Pizza for me.  And that's exactly what you get here at Settebello. I'm not a fan of a thick crusted, overly sauced, and high calorie pizza.  So, their Margherita is perfect.  What you get is a thin crusted, lightly sauced pizza with mozzarella, basil, parmigiano, and olive oil.  I had mushrooms and sausage added just for the extra boost of protein and flavor.  Their Margherita  is pretty close to what you expect in Naples.  Believe me, I know.   Regarding price, the restaurant, and service, keep in mind that I ate here on $1 Margherita Pizza Night.  That means lines and a longer wait.  This wasn't a normal night so I'm not going to base my rating on their service.  The size of the restaurant was spacious with seating at the bar, booths, and their outside patio.  As for price, even though I only paid $1 for my pizza, their regular price for a pizza was about $10.  Not bad, not bad at all.    Overall, I love me some pizza and Settebello is not only as good as it gets, but also as authentic as it gets.  YELP PERSONAL CHALLENGE - (027/366)",

I found out later that this restaurant has multiple locations, two in Southern California actually - in Marina del Rey and Pasadena.  We were seated immediately around 2:00 pm on a Monday afternoon. We ordered:  (1) Settebello Pizza, $13.50, Crushed tomatoes, pancetta, sausage, mushrooms, toasted pine nuts, mozzarella, basil - absolutely delicious; we shared a pizza; it came with 4 pre-cut slices. yummy! not too oily which is nice; and very flavorful  (2) Insalata Grande $8.50, resfreshing salad and good portion size. it could be shared among 2 people; dressing was light and just the right hint of tangy-ness.   Now that I know this restaurant also exists in SoCal, I wouldn't mind going there to check it out sometime. :)",

(I'm a Grimaldi's girl)   We started with the meat & cheese plate. The bf got all the meat because it was all pork. The cheese was very limited (two kinds mozzarella & something else) they were ok but I expected a little more selection or quantity. The bread was good though & the the bf liked the pork.   Bf ordered the HH *  basically a small calzone. I ordered the hh margherita pizza. Both were good and worthy of their $5 price tag.  We also ordered the *at our servers request. He reminded us to remove the cotta (pork) so we subbed it for pine nuts. The pizza was good & flavorful,  but both pizzas were a little soggy in the middle... Not sure if this is just the Napoletana way... But it's not my preference. However folding the pizza in half like a taco makes for easier eating.   The HH Pinot Noir was quite good, very subtle. Suicide was pretty good. Friendly & attentive. There wasn't much action on the patio but for the most part he stayed on top of things.",

    "text": "Stopped by here for lunch with my husband 1.5 weeks ago because we saw this restaurant featured on the Cooking Channel's Unique Eats. This restaurant is different from your typical pizzeria because of their Neapolitan style pizza (slices of mozzarella on pizza instead of the shredded with toppings you desire all cooked in a wood burning oven).   When we came into this restaurant, we were immediately acknowledged and seated right away. This is what we ordered:  Settebello- This was definitely one of the better pizzas I have ever had. Our server said this was one of their most popular pizzas (he told this after we ordered it). This pizza was really good, as it had a nice crisp, thin and tender chewy crust. All of the flavors in the 1st bite was very satisfying and I would order this again. By the way, because this restaurant is trying to be as authentic as the pizzas in Italy, they do not normally serve the pizzas pre-sliced like you would find in other restaurants. But he said we could request for them to cut it for us if we wanted. We just cut a piece of the pizza to share ourselves.  Panzanella Salad- good portion, clean tasting and something I wanted because I was jonesing for salad for lunch. I asked for the salad dressing to be placed on the side and it came as I had requested. This salad isn't exactly memorable, but I got what I wanted and was satisfied with it.   Overall, our lunch was a good experience. It wasn't too crowded when we arrived (around 12 pm) but could see that they do get a good lunch crowd. The only negative thing I would say about our experience though was our server. He was rather strange because he would say some real odd comments that make you just kind of think 'what...?' .... but other than that, no other negatives.   By the way, this place is located in the same plaza as Whole Foods. There is plenty of parking and there is outdoor seating here.",

I've never dined in, but the cashier was very friendly and will supply napkins, etc. upon request.   Cons: limited vegan options. Rucola arugula salad seems to be the only option, and possibly the Marinara pizza and flatbread. I'd double check on those last two. As many times as I've been here, I seem to completely forget to ask about that.",

Parking is pretty easy they've got nice free parking outside. Our pizza was definitely good but really soggy and either needed to cook more or have less sauce. That Neapolitan flavor was so good though so that's why I'm giving them three stars. I really happen to like that flavor but if you're not really into the flavor you'd probably give it less. Although is vegetarian friendly I was super disappointed with the salads. Almost all the salads had meat in them which is really strange, and they didn't even have an option for taking the meat out. They also have a gluten-free crust which is great. It's a tough review because if my husband was the one giving this review he would've given it a one star. He was super disappointed. It is pretty pricey for what you're getting but it is hard to find good pizza in Vegas. Overall not the best pizza experience.",

When I first looked at the menu online I thought \"dang $5.00 up-charge for gluten-free crust?!\" ...most places are $2-$3 extra so I was kinda tiffed but wanted to try it anyway.   Wow, soooo worth the $5.00 extra, it's by far the best gluten-free crust I've ever had (been Celiac for years and have had a lot of gluten-free pizza). Never had such authentic tasting gluten-free, perfectly crispy in the right places and salted well so it was super flavorful.   We had the Settebello which was good but a little too meaty for my taste (fiance gobbled it up) and the Capricosa which was more veggie centric and sooooo soooo good. Also had the beet salad which is a must.   Our waiter Tyler was super attentive and knowledgeable about the menu, great waiter and great experience will 100% be back ASAP because I think this crust would be stellar with their Margarita pizza and I'm pregnant and already want it.",

If you enjoy authentic Naples style pizza, nothing else comes even close.  I've tried almost all of their pizzas and my favorite is the Diavola... so much flavor packed into this pizza with the slices of fresh garlic, roasted red pepper, and spicy salami.  The ingredients are authentic and super fresh and the pizzas are always served piping hot.  Settebellos is also known for their great service and their wait staff are attentive and very personable.  They also offer a military discount... which this veteran appreciates greatly!",

We were pretty hungry so we order 2 appetizers and 2 pizzas for 4 people. If you are super hungry like we were I would recommend a pizza for each person because the crust is a very thin crust so it wouldn't fill you up with only 2-3 slices a piece.   The pizzas are a really fancy type pizza which isn't bad but it isn't my jam. I like PIZZA with all the normal toppings maybe a fancy sauce here or there but something I can really sink my teeth into.    I don't think I would try it again based on personal preference because again most of my friends love it.",

Both were served warm. We then ordered margherita, quattro formagino and the settebello to share with one another. One pizza definitely feeds 1-2 but more-so one with a slice or two two to spare. We tried each other's and all had slices to take home. Pizza tasted good with their chili olive oil and balsamic vinaigrette. My friend found a hair in his pizza half way into his meal and the server very graciously took it away and offered to make a new one. He didn't love his quattro formagino so he even allowed him to switch to margherita.   They've got a happy hour menu also, though it's limited for vegetarians. I was hoping they'd have an outdoor porch but they did not. I would return if in the area.",

For me and my family the more simple the pizza the more delicious. This place nails it! From the delicious crust with the tiny blackened bits from the brick oven to the delicious simple sauce to the mouth watering buffalo mozzarella.... what else do you need?! We always get the Margherita DOC and the beet salad. The salad is perfectly dressed and just refreshing. I've invited family here as well when they are in town and they all say the same thing this place is GOOD! Again, if you like your typical \"American\" fast food chain style pizza, this may not be your cup of tea. But if quality is what you seek then give this place a try. Their staff is always friendly and gives great service and the place is always clean and inviting.",

The restaurant is small so I would recommend making a reservation before coming. We arrived around 6:15 and it was pretty full, and stayed consistently busy until we left. There were 3 large parties seated near us. They also have plenty of booth seating available.   The beet salad was really good! The salad was fresh and the pine nuts on top added a nice crunch. Goat cheese was cream, beets were sweet and the vinaigrette was slightly tangy, which balanced the dish. We liked it so much that we decided to make our own the next night at home!  The meat balls were a good size, there was 4 to a dish with enough sauce to scoop using the pita (pizza) bread provided.   I love pizza and can eat it everyday but the brisket pizza we ordered didn't leave a lasting impression. I think my bf enjoyed it more than I did. I thought the dough was very good and I liked the caramelized onions but the brisket was a bit dry imo.   We were stuffed by the end of our meal so we didn't order dessert but I'll save room for some next time!",

All of the ingredients on everything that we ordered tasted so fresh ! A lot of the ingredients are made in house and you can truly tell. The pizza was really good but the crust on the pizza was very thin almost too thin to hold the ingredients on it. The gelato that we finished with was creamy and salty and sweet and just delicious. I wish the pizza crust was a little thicker but that definitely wouldn't hold me back from coming back here. The prices were a little expensive but well worth it due to the freshness of the food. I recommend this place to anyone looking for some inexpensive food with a really fresh and good flavor.",

Of course, Settebello scratches a very specific pizza itch since it's Napoletana style. It wont be like a pizza you get delivered or a New York slice. It's very thin, with a delicious chewy crust and char spots from being in the oven. It's pretty \"wet\" for a pizza, so some opt to eat it with a knife and fork.  My favorite pie is the Margherita pizza, but I've also had the Diavola and that was very good.  My favorite appetizer is their Involtini di Prosciutto. It's Prosciutto Crudo wrapped around a generous portion of arugula and goat cheese. Topped with MORE goat cheese, Parmigiano-Reggiano, a balsamic reduction and EVOO.  They have some really unique craft cocktails on their menu, but I would definitely recommend enjoying one of their many wines that will complement your pizza. Save the cocktail for dessert.",

Only 8 dollars it consisted of Mixed Greens, Fresh Tomatoes, Artichoke Hearts, Roasted Mushrooms, Olives, Pine Nuts, Cracked Pepper, Shaved Parmigiano, and tossed in a balsamic vinaigrette. I also had an espresso martini. WOW i could drink 10 of them. and made with illy coffee? yes please! Ill def be returning here, and next time ill call ahead for a gluten free pizza :)",

    "text": "Most amazing pizza I've ever had. Hands down.  Sooo for my birthday this past weekend, visiting from CA, I wanted to try a new place I have never had before. Settebello's Pizza came up during my search, and I figured why not? Who doesn't love a good pizza. I just didn't expect it to be as amazing as it was!  We get to the Henderson location and walk in. We weren't greeted by the hostess, who was just standing there. So my sister walks up and asks if we can have a table for 3. The hostess was like \"oh well I don't have a table right now so you can just check in the bar area.\" Uh....ok?! Thanks for the great customer service. No hi or how are you guys doing? Must have been having an awful night.  So we went and sat at the bar and the bartender's customer service completely made up for her lack of enthusiasm. Cute guy, slicked back hair and glasses....I can't remember his name. Asked if we had ever been there before and we told him we hadn't. He gave us a bunch of suggestions and told us his favorite pizza to eat and told us if we had any questions to just let him know. Well, I had lots of questions. Seems silly but their menus are hard to understand with ingredients that must be in Italian. I was like what's this? and this? and this? The bartender was so patient. My fiance was starting to get irritated but I didn't want to order something weird lol. We ended up just telling him what kind of toppings we wanted and he made it happen. Amazing food and good customer service so we will definitely be back!",

    "text": "Whenever I hear about something being so hyped up I get a bit hesitant specially when a few of my close friends didn't think it lived up to the hype.   We were in the area, got shafted at a few options we wanted to go to over this, but glad we ended up going. I haven't had a Napoletana pizza in a while.   We started off the meal with a Misto ($13) plate which has a assortment of bread, meat, cheese and accompaniments. The bread was a bare pizza and our plate consisted of pickled cippolini onions, basil, artichoke, salume di napoli, mortadella, proscuitto, light cured ham, parmesan, provolini. You can taste the quality of the components and I love good charcuterie and was pretty happy with it.   We got the Del Cafone pizza ($12). The toppings were quality and the pizza crust was decent. Napoletana pizza I don't think is for everyone and it's not a substitute/nothing like other thin crust styles. I like a bit of a char flavor and chewy, airy in a spongy way type crust is alright for me since I find that enjoyable in certain breads like pao`.   Finished the meal with a dream bomba ($5) which was a peanut butter ice cream covered in a chocolate shell. It says it has a caramel heart, but there was very little of it. It was okay, but I kinda wished I got a panna cotta. Ordered this since I haven't had a bomba before but keep seeing it pop up on menus recently.   The service was very good. Friendly and super attentive without being intrusive. Our drinks never reached more than half empty, helpful with tips, intuitive about the check, etc.  If you're a fan of this style, then come here specially since it's VPN certified. This isn't the best Napoletana I've had in the US (Bollini's or A-16 wins for me) but your best bet in Vegas for authentic Napoli pizze.",

It's a very thin crust pizza, but the crust stays soft in the wood fire oven. The size is decent for a personal pizza, but it is defiantly more of a traditional type pizza, sorry dominos lovers, this is not for you. The service was very good, but also very slow in my opinion. I also thought the pizza was a bit overpriced, but so is everything in the district. Over all if you like this type of pizza, the place is nice and you will probably enjoy this restaurant. If the American style pizza is more your speed, this is defiantly not that.",

While slightly more expensive and will probably be considered a treat, this place was amazing.   We showed up for a late lunch, and our waiter was so very helpful. He told us about the history of their pizzas, how they're quite authentic.   We ordered two pizzas. A regular pepperoni and a chicken something or another. Both were delicious. Four slices for what looked like a 7-8 inch pizza. With both pizzas, for the two of us... Filling. Great find, but the prices are a bit steep.",

    "text": "Dined here once and will never return. While the food was passable, (nothing outstanding but not slop either) the prices and the wait staff will keep me from eating at this restaurant again.  Our pizzas were pretty small and did not contain many ingredients. I understand they serve margherita pizzas, but all the other times I've eaten them I left the table feeling full. This was not the case here. The crust was thin and took up a good portion of the pizza. We wondered why they only sauced about 50% of the pizza. The cheese was tasty, but I would have liked more than a few little pieces on the pizza.  For such a small pizza, the cost was certainly not worth it. I would have no problem if the food was outstanding, but it was just an average pizza. Many other smaller pizzerias in town offer better tasting and larger pizzas for less money than Settebello.  Our waiter was anything but approachable, making it seem like a chore to get a place setting for one person in our group. Throughout the meal, our waiter was rarely seen. He basically took our order and gave us the check. The server who brought our food out was the one to check on us!  I usually try to keep non-food related criticisms to myself, but this restaurant had too many strikes against it not to mention the negatives. I would only dine here again if someone else paid for it, and even then, I would make sure to have a place lined up for food later on.",

    "text": "I lived in Italy for 6 glorious months and I have been searching for Italian style pizza ever since I left. After 7 long years, I found it at Settebello! This is not your typical American pizza joint. You order your own individual pizza and you eat it Italian style, with a knife and fork (or they will slice it if you prefer). The ingredients are straight off the boat and that is what makes the pizza delicious! They get their meats from Salumi in Seattle, it's Mario Batali's father's cured meat shop. He spent months perfecting his art in Italy and you can taste the perfection!  The signature settebello pizza is a real gem. My husband usually orders it so I go with the pizza Bianca. It doesn't matter what you order, everything is a winner. There is always a special pizza of the week and if you get on their email list they will send you the specials in advance. This is dangerous because it makes me want to eat here every single day!   I have also had the pleasure of trying the salads. They are just as good as the pizza and they will gladly split them for you.   Since leaving Italy I have also been on the lookout for Italian gelato. Again, Settebello excels above the rest. The gelato is very authentic and  they have a special flavor every week. My favorite so far is the vanilla cinnamon, sounds crazy but it is crazy delicious!  The prices are a bit high, but they are flying the ingredients in from Italy for crying out loud! You don't need to buy a ticket to Italy to have authentic Italian pizza anymore, just stop by Settebello on your way home!",

Someone we had met had recommended it and we were looking to grab a bite before hitting the town for a bit.  We went in and I appreciated the small menu.  Small menus are my favorite because it makes me feel like the restaurant really knows what they do well and focus on that, rather than offering pages of options.  We settled for the beet salad and the pizza bolognese.  I don't love beets, but my best friend does so I settled for her.  She LOVED it.  And when I say loved it, I mean she has dreams about this salad.    Now, the pizza bolognese sent me to heaven and back again.  Normally I don't go for what we on the east coast call \"specialty pizzas\" that have the works on them.  Being a Jersey girl through and through a plain pie with a nice, crispy crust is a dream.  So I went with what was closest to a plain pie and that's the pizza bolognese.  Instead of regular tomato sauce, the crust is covered with meat sauce.  Well, I was amazed that something could be so good.  I didn't even want to go out anymore!  I would have sat there and eaten this pizza all night if this were an option, sadly they were closing since we got there so late.  There is no other way to describe this pizza other than to use the word \"perfect.\"  It makes me extremely nervous that I will be living extremely close to Settebello in my new apartment.  I will definitely have to practice will power and stop myself from ordering this pizza every night.",

I can't say anything bad about the pizza but I think I enjoy a New York style pizza more.   My only complaint about this pizza place was the lack of customer service. With this being our first visit to this restaurant, it would have been nice for our waitress to be able to explain the menu or how things worked. When we asked questions, we were met with short responses and our waitress made us feel like we were wasting her time. We truly did not feel welcome as customers.   Overall, if you're a fan of this type of pizza, you will enjoy the food. If you know exactly what you want and don't want to interrupt the waitresses day (EVEN THOUGH THAT'S HER JOB), you might really like this place. But if you are new to the style and this type of pie, try another place. One with employees who value their customers.",

However, one of the pieces hardly had any topping on it and the pinenuts were not evenly dispersed. Verrrrry important in a pinenut pizza! I gobbled heartily and was sad when it was over.   I also had a salad which made me feel better about myself. I don't know if I would get one the next time because it was on the pricey side but it was tasty.

In my journey I've discovered that it really comes down to the quality of ingredients, coupled with an oven that is made of the right materials, and is heated in a proper way.  I'm happy to say that Settebello has NAILED it.  Their pizza is as close to a True Neapolitan pizza as you can get, short of traveling to Naples itself.  Slightly crispy on the bottom, soft on the top, and chewy delicious.  The authentic flavor of tomatoes, buffalo mozzarella, olive oil and basil - it doesn't get any better.  The owner went out of his way to bring you a True taste from the birthplace of pizza, and it shows.  Though they offer more styles of pizza than what is traditionally available (to suit the expectations of an American market probably), they do it within reason, and they keep it delicious.  Literally everything we had there was great, from the prosciutto, to the caprese, to the absolutely perfect margherita pizza.  If you want that Naples authentic pizza without having to travel to Italy, this is as close as you can get.  Pro tip - stick to the marinara or margherita pizza if you want a True taste of Naples.... and for the love of all things holy, get the basil-wrapped prosciutto drizzled with their house balsamic.  You will cry tears of joy.",

    "text": "First, let me say that I'd give it 6 stars if I could.  My husband and I live more than 30 minutes away, and I refuse to eat pizza anywhere else.  We must brave I-15 every time we go (which is always seems to be a virtual parking lot), resulting in a 35 minute commute each way.  I have dined at Settebello an average of twice per month since my last review in August 2009, and have yet to be disappointed.  It is amazing the level of friendliness, attentiveness and overall customer service that is consistently  maintained by the staff.   Settebello is extremely family-friendly.  Since most of our friends have young children, it has been a wonderful choice for us to meet up and enjoy a meal together.  They offer all children imported Italian breadsticks to keep them occupied, while parents peruse the menu; additionally, there is a child's tomato/cheese pizza (only slightly smaller than the regular size Margherita) which comes with a complimentary scoop of gelato for dessert.  I just had to get another 2 cents in because it is very easy to have one great meal somewhere, but another feat entirely to have EVERY meal be tasty and delicious, backed with great service.",

I would definitely come back for more pizza.",

    "text": "I have lived in Italy for 3 years . What better place to experience real authetic pizza than Italy, right? Lucky for me I love pizza! And Settebello's lives up to my expectation. It saved me from feeling doomed to horrible pizza when we moved to LV.   Warning: this place is not for deep dish hardcore lovers whose minds cannot be changed. Also, REAL ITALIAN style pizza is not the same as brooklyn style pizza. Italian style pizza is supposed to be thin crusted, fresh toppings, light on the sauce and seasonings, and make a person content- no stuffed.   And I love Settebello's!!! Here's why... all their ingredients are fresh. My toppings: proscuitto, mushrooms, arugula, and pepperoni. They get it right every time. The crust is thin and just right-- just like in Italy. The sauce is not heavy and just the right amount- just like in Italy. The seasoning... when I first tried Settebello's pizza,, the smell of the seasoning reminded my husband and I of our favorite pizza place in Italy.   I cannot rave enough about this place. Living in North Las Vegas, the drive to the District for the pizza is well worth it.  I have even eaten at their location in Salt Lake City, UT which is amazing as well.",

    "text": "I could rave about the pizza, but I'm going to start by complimenting the Web site.  The owner writes about apprenticing to a famous pizza maker in Italy, and then proceeds to tell you why Napoli-style pizza is distinct.  There's a great line on the site about how pizza crust should only use flour from one mill in Italy, and how the tomatoes are never made into sauce but simply crushed over the dough.  It's like Marcella Hazan's book, distilled into delicious bite-size web pages.  (If you have read her classic Italian cookbook, you know what I mean...)  The web site also identifies where their ingredients come from.  You're pretty hard-core when you're a pizzeria and your flour comes all the way from Italy.  In fact, when you walk into the door, there's a big stack of flour sacks right behind the host stand.  All of this would be so pretentious if the pizza weren't awesome.  And it is.  This is the closest thing I've had to the pizzas I enjoyed in Rome on vacation two years ago.  And for all the joking in this review about the flour, it really does make a difference.  The crust absorbs the flavor of the toppings but does not get soggy, and it's robust enough to stay in one piece until you cut it.  The only con is, as many other reviewers have pointed out, the price.  $13 for a pizza is pricey, but a plane ticket to Italy is at least $1,000, so I really don't think you can complain too much.  As a final thought, why is it that when an Italian politician says anything, you just let it go in one ear and out the other (see Berlusconi, Silvio for a modern example, or Craxi, Bettino for an earlier example -- corruption is really a bipartisan activity in Italy).  However, if an Italian chef says that the building blocks of your meal are imported from Italy and cooked in an oven hand-assembled from bricks that are also imported from Italy, there's no question he's telling the truth?",

The dough was super thin with a crispy puffy outer crust. The toppings toppings were very fresh and the sauce wasn't overly salty like most pizzas.

Thin crust that's crispy and chewy at the same time, fresh and simple ingredients, and a slight smokiness to the crust makes this the best pizza I've ever had!  Settebello only sells pizzas and a few salads, and that's it. You won't find hot wings, cheezy garlic bread, stuffed crusts, dessert pizzas, fried chicken, or any of the (usually nasty) unnecessary non-pizza stuff here.  They make just a few things, and they do them RIGHT.  I had the Caprese, Margherita, and Quattro Stagioni, and was impressed with all of them!  It was so good, I ate the Caprese salad and a few pieces of pizza before I remembered to take pictures LOL!  Friendly service! My only complaint is that this place isn't closer to where I live!  My server was very friendly, and it was packed during lunch hour.  This place is truly a gem!  Update 2/1/07 I just had to go back!  The pizzas were perfect again.  The server was very friendly, and the guys in the kitchen had nothing but smiles on their faces. I love, Love, LOVE this place!  Do yourself a favor and check them out!  Update 3/4/07 Drove all the way from NLV again, so that DH could try Settebello's awesome pizza!  I was a little disappointed this time around, the pizzas were soggy and not hot, as if they were sitting on the pass for too long.  The server that was there wasn't nearly as friendly as the weekday server.  As we were leaving, there were two hot pizzas on plates, ready to be served to the tables, but they were sitting there for at least a couple minutes because the server was busy.  The pizzas were still good, but would've been better if they were given to us before they became soggy and lukewarm.",

    "text": "Even though there have already been excellent reviews written for this establishment, I need to include my kudos to the owners and staff.    My husband and I came across this restaurant by chance, as we were thumbing through one of the tourist magazines while waiting in line at a casino buffet. We were intrigued enough to add it to our \"to do\" list while we were in town last week.  We called on Wednesday night, to verify the hours of operation only to learn that they were out of pizza dough and would be closing earlier than anticipated.    Not to be dissuaded, we arrived around 1:30 pm Friday afternoon.  The place was busy, however, we were promptly seated.  Our service staff were very friendly and attentive.  After looking over the menu, it was clear that we would be ordering more than just pizza.   We ordered the Focaccia and Involtini di Prosciutto from the appetizer menu and for the main dish the Settebello Pizza.    The Focaccia was amazing with the sea salt and olive oil.  The dough was crisp yet chewy.    The Involtini di Prosciutto was a wonderful treat.  The baby arugula had a very mild peppery essence, but when combined with the mild goat cheese wrapped in salty prosciutto and drizzled with olive oil and balsamic reduction.  OMG, delicious!  Our only complaint was that we only received two.    The Settebello Pizza was an enjoyable experience.  The description that the pizza can be a little bit soggy was close to True.  Then again, I don't mind eating my pizza with a fork and knife.  I am not a big fan of sausage (I don't particularly care for fennel seeds), but even the sausage on this pizza was good.  The earthy combination of the mushrooms, pine nuts and pancetta was a tasty treat.  Then to add in the crushed tomatoes and mozzarella took this to the next level.  We left the restaurant very satisfied and happy to have found the ad for it.   As we were driving out of town the next day, my husband pulled out the \"to-go \" menu for Settebello's.  We called in an order for the Focaccia and the Involtini di Prosciutto.  We just couldn't resist taking advantage of one last opportunity to enjoy these tasty items before heading back to AZ.  This is not the American-style pizza that many of us have been force-feed over the years.   If you are expecting or enjoy the thick, doughy, greasy crust pizza, this is not for you.  For the rest, this is amazing pizza.  While I have never traveled to Itay, I can attest that this is one of the best pizza's I had the pleasure of enjoying in Las Vegas!",

    "text": "Meh is right!  I wanted to like this little place, tucked away in the eastern end of the district with a cute atmosphere upon walk in and friendly staff i just wish the food followed through with similar positive marks. I wanted to use this place as a regular spot for work lunches in this region of town as its relatively in expensive for a lunch for two and its open and clean setting it seemed inviting enough. Its simple i ordered their Capricciosa pizza which was one of the 3 on the menu with two meats instead of the others with just 1 or less. The pie came out and it was what i expected with a very fresh looking feel to it and looked appetizing, and smelled pretty good as well. The best part of the pizza was the freshness of the vegetables that went on it, the sauce was just ok, and the crust was the weak part of the meal like others have said. Its just soggy and painfully not up to par for this type of pizza obviously. I really wish the management at this place would recognize that this is a common problem and try to improve upon it as i really want to like this place but cant return if there are so much better options to take my business.  Positive note the tiramisu is very good and is the reason this review for 3 instead of 2 stars. But then again im pretty easy to please when it comes to dessert, but arent we all.",

    "text": "I got to Settebello around noon on a weekday, and there was a pretty good crowd; not full, but lively.  It's an informal place, with a glazed cement floor, dark brown with some black in a square geometric pattern.  The simple wood tables are completely bare.  An open kitchen contains a large wood burning pizza oven.  Fans attached to the black industrial ceiling provide air circulation.  Lots of windows give the place a bright and airy feeling.  I tried the eponymous Settebello pizza:  crushed tomatoes, pancetta, sausage, mushrooms, pine nuts, mozzarella, basil, and olive oil.  The crust was thin and chewy, with black char spots on the bottom.  And the flavor!  I could have eaten the crust alone.  The crushed tomatoes tasted fresh, as did the mushrooms.  Small amounts of mozzarella and other toppings served as an accent to the crust.  This is one very good pizza.  Settebello pizzas are very different from the standard American pizza.  At Settebello, the crust is the star.  Toppings, including cheese, are applied sparingly; they play a supporting role.  I think this has disappointed some people, who came expecting one thing and got another.  Settebello is a good 20 minute drive from The Strip.  No pizza place is worth that kind of drive, but if you're nearby, it's definitely worth searching out.",

Perfect crust - chewy & well-toasted. The salads are amazing - can't beat the prices and they don't skimp on the goodies. Dessert.  For $5 you can get a Nutella pizza with fresh bananas and slivered almonds.  It's the same size as their entree pizzas - about 12\".  And I think they apply the Nutella with a squeeze bottle.  It's beautiful - a grid of thin lines over the whole pizza, edge to edge.  The bananas are put on while the crust is still hot so they soften a bit but don't get mushy.  I've had Nutella dessert pizzas all over the country & this one is the best so far. You could go the the Strip and pay a LOT more for a similar meal but it won't come close the the quality & authenticity of this comfortable place.",

I'd howevet give these guys another shot and order a large pie of their margherita or a simple pie to see how they do a classic.   The pies were good, but usually when pizza is amazing, the ingredients, texture, combination, proportions, etc. all sing in perfect harmony when you take a bite. The pizzas we had were fast tracked to be pros, but were still getting there. I was a wee disappointed since on yelp they have STELLAR rep.   Atmosphere is nice in Tuscan style with warm yellow hues. Don't sit near the oversized, wall-pendent. Huge globs of dust everywhere and there's fans around.   Good service experience.",

The tomatoes were half the size of the buffalo mozzarella, which kinda sucks. Always like to have large tomato slices so that each bite you get tomato and mozza.  I had the margherita doc pizza which was full of flavor, but the middle parts of the pizza were too thin to hold any sort of ingredients. In other words, when you pick the pizza slice up it flops. And not to mention the sauce has a lot of water in it so it drips off the pizza, which gets messy.   Other than that the service was excellent. If your looking for a pizza place in Henderson, come, it's a really good and decent restaurant.",

I was surprised at its low price. Now I know why, because it was probably the saddest meat/cheese plate I've seen. 3 pieces of meat, 1 slice of white cheese, and a chunk of parmesan (that was the best part) Poor presentation, but when you're hungry, you eat. One of my friends had their pasta and enjoyed it. Some of the ladies had pizza and liked it. I had a couple of drinks which I thought were priced high by a $1 or $2. Our server was nice and accommodating. As for returning, I would again with friends, but would not go out of my way to visit because of the food, it was just ok.",

I know its a goofy combination and I agree it is, but I am here ti tell you that it is unbelievably great.  We ordered 4 pizzas and this pear and jalapeno stood out!!  Nice to see a real pizzaria.  Plus, their food is not expensive at all.",

    "text": "So when we first came here, it wasn't bad. This place actually had such a great environment, not to mention the food was pretty good as well. But this time was very different. When we entered the restaurant, the environment was completely different. The waitress blinked a few times, almost walked away, and then reluctantly greeted us. I didn't think much of it. I just thought maybe she was busy, but when I looked around, it was pretty empty. Anyways she acted pretty hostile which made me sort of feel unwelcome. I ended up forgetting about it cause maybe she had a tough day. UNTIL. There was a family behind us with the same server and she was so nice to them! Like she was literally laughing and smiling and it's like she was a completely different person! When she brought us the food, she didn't even get the order right. We ordered 3 pizzas and instead she brought us 4. She thought since we had another guest coming that we would want an extra one EVEN THOUGH we said nothing of the sort. Of course the food was good as usual but the waitress basically ruined my experience.",

Well lemme back up, I actually started with a watermelon margarita and holy guacamole, who knew an Italian place could make a great margarita and watermelon rita at that?!? It wasnt super sweet, it was amazing!! Enough that I had 3 :-)  Okay next we each ordered our own pizza, i went with the  bolognese i think i spelled that correctly...anyway it was yummy...my daughter and friend's pizzas were better but i did like mine. It was a sweet sauce, their pizzas are thin crust and very flavorful!! Our waiter (Tan, Tam one of those) was awesome and described the menu in detail and pizzas in detail.   Can't wait to go back and try some of the other pizza options!!",

It was really big for the 2 of us, but we finished it anyway.   I had no idea when the pizza came out that it was full sized! What a great deal for $5! We each ate half, so next time we will split.   Their pizza is really, really good. Didn't even add parmesan cheese on top or anything, it didn't need it.   The bill was very affordable with this deal, and the food was great! My friend knew our server, so of course service was excellent. I can tell he is a really nice guy anyway from his interaction with other tables as well. Will definitely be back!",

We asked if we could sit on the patio. We really must have been the only crazies that wanted to sit out on the patio in July because none of the patio seat cushions were on the chair hah! The hostess was kind enough to put them on for us, so no big deal!  Our waitress was Madison and she was incredible! We both recognized each other, but couldn't figure out where from. Later in the evening I realized that we both went to college together. Small world! She came out to check on us throughout the night. Even though none of her other tables were outside, she didn't forget about us! Which is pretty incredible because I feel like sometimes when you're outside, you're easily forgotten about. But Madison did a great job refilling out drinks, making sure we were good and making sure our food was brought out in a timely manner. Hats off to her, for sure!  I had a moscow mule while my husband had a beer. My mule was delightful! I opted for the garden mule, and it was full of delicious fruit flavors. We started with the focaccia bread as well which is what their pizza crust is made out of but honestly, you can't get enough of it! It's so tasty!  For dinner, my husband had this brisket pizza and I had the traditional margarehita pizza. He said his had a little kick to it because there were some spices added, but he throughly enjoyed the taste of the brisket and the pizza overall. My pizza was also incredible! The red sauce they use is not too sweet and not to spicy. It's a perfect blend.  We will definitely be back for sure!",

The association of vpn (avpn) give special designation to pizzerias who meet strict requirements that respect the tradition of the art of Neapolitan pizza makings.   Settebello is a vpn certified pizzeria with three locations throughout Las Vegas. I visited the green valley location which is closer to where I live. It is located in the green valley plaza with plenty of parking available. I came in late afternoon on a Saturday. No wait line. I was seated promptly upon entering the establishment.   Settebello serve a variety of vpn pizza and beverages to choose from. The prices for the pizza were decent for the quality that you get. I love that they have flavored sparkling water. I opted for the grapefruit which was refreshing and good on a hot day.   I ordered the Bianca pizza (Aragula, Parmesan, prosciutto, basil, olive oil) and Vico (sausage, marscapone, red onion, basil, olive oil). They were both so delicious with fresh topping ingredients. The pizza dough was light and chewy. I would request for crispier crusts next time and recommend to those who like their crust extra crispy to mention it when ordering.   Staff was great and polite! I will add this place as one of my favorite pizza places in Las Vegas.",

Food: Half capricciosa half Settebello - amazing flavor combination! Not even sure where the sauce is, I don't think they have sauce on the pizza  it was delicious. One of the best \"finer dinning\" pizza I've ever had. Ingredients were fresh which made the difference and probably added to the wonderful taste.   insalata grande - a simple salad  but also delicious!   Drinks: Sin tax IPA beer and solerno drink that the waitress recommend. Both were good.   Next time I'm in the area I will try this place again!! The pizza was really good!!   Parking is great, lots of spaces in a newer complex so everything looks shiny, new and clean!",

I was here recently for their Happy Hour (3:00pm - 6:00pm), which is my favorite HH in the Vegas valley.   I'm not a huge drinker of alcohol, preferring the rather basic Moscow Mule as my drink of choice, which is only $5 on Mondays.  Plus, the Happy Hour menu is chockful of $5 items;  you could order each one and easily share them with a friend and not spend a chunk of money.  There are four of these $5  items on the menu:  Piatto Misto (sampling of Italian meats and cheese served with focaccia);  Mini Ripieno (prosciutto cotto, Parmigiano, and fresh mozzarella); Mini Pizza (Margherita or Marinara with one complimentary topping);  Spiedini (Prosciutto wrapped around Fontina cheese, served w/ a mini Caprese). I love the food here and the service is always attentive.  Settebello will continue to be a reliable go-to for me.",

The waiter (I didn't get his name but he had curly hair in a man bun) was really awesome and said they could change gloves and would be very careful out cross contamination which was appreciated. It made me feel at ease and he even brought out a bag of their flour so I could look at the ingredients in regards to my allergy. Thumbs up for him   I will definitely be back with my hubby!",

They are very conscious and knowledgeable about celiac and can cook your pizza in a special way if needed, which is always good when you need to be GF.   We ordered two pizzas and a salad to split between three people. The gluten free pizza was the best gluten free pizza I have had! That says a lot because I have had many. It doesn't even taste like gluten free pizza.  We also ordered two regular pizzas to go for the non-gluten free members of our family.  Tam, our server, was fantastic! Definitely will be back.",

However, second time and still don't like it.   The pizza is SUPER wet and floppy. I understand people say this is a \"fork and knife\" type pizza place, but the flavor isn't even there. The sauce was extremely bland. And if you try to eat the pizza with your hands, you will have the crust in your hand, while the toppings and the rest of pizza all fall down. Pizza should have some type of structure to me and Settebello definitely does not.   So I think this will be my last time coming here. Service was good (reason for two stars), but pizza was terrible and there are too many great pizza places in the country than to ever have to return to Soggyville.",

Cheerful, attentive, aware, helpful and kind in the midst of ravenous, possibly hangry, Neapolitan pizza provocateurs gnashing at her like Velociraptors on the hunt. Without a worry because she knows the power she wields in her mighty pen, where one overt pouty mouth moment because it was not your time, may cast you to the imagined dog house where only those that can hear a dog whistle can hear their name and know their time has come.   Calmly, the Guard of the Gate calls the name of the next fortunate souls to dine at the church of the Napoli wood oven. Purveyor of the delicately arranged enigmatic flavors that pop like snaps of pencils breaking in your hands. The surge of spices, herbs, other worldly olive oil and the cheese... what dost thou place on the crust of this opaque pizza so warm, melted, chewy and bright? Mozzarella and what else I say!?!?.What are the mystery flavors that brighten your day, make the bad day go away and cause you to close your eyes to accept all the senses being touched by this pizza angel. Now let's speak  to this dough, the crust, the edible pallet with ingredients married in the church of the chefs imaginations. I mean who thinks to put jalapeno marmalade on a pizza with Calabrese?!?! Oh that sweet meat heat! And that delicate chew, allowing the teeth, gums , tongue and palate to dance slowly with the pizza, tasting every element; flavors, textures, heat and if you close your eyes and nom, nom, nom out loud, I swear it tastes even better. Trust me!  I'm going to just leave it at this...there is no where else you need to go to have Zah! This is a great place to take a date. Great wine, cold beers, oh and the appetizers... and the salads. I die for the beet salad.   La pieste de resistance?!?! That dessert pizza. Just look at the pic ... it speaks volumes.",

    "text": "I know this is supposedly the best pizza in Vegas, but I guess I'm not a huge fan of it...  First off, the service here is wonderful. They are all very attentive and friendly, checking to make sure everything is to your liking. The wait can be long but they'll give you water as you're waiting. There's always the option to sit at the bar too and get some appetizer before a table opens up.  The menu has a decent selection of pizzas and they usually have a special pizza of the day. You can get pizzas with or without tomato sauce. The pizzas I have tried are the Diavola, the Vico, and one of their specials of the day but I can't remember too much about it.   Diavola - It has a very nice little kick from the crushed red peppers and the salame gives a good saltiness.  Vico - The mascarpone pretty much melted and mixed with the olive oil and was a great substitute for having no crushed tomatoes. I was skeptical about no tomatoes but was pleasantly surprised. I also really liked the fennel and wood oven sausage, even though I generally am not a fan of sausage.  So why the 3 stars? I'm not a huge fan of their crust. It's a bit too wet and thin for me. This is one of those very thin pizzas where it's probably easier to eat with a fork and knife. For me, I like a crust that can hold its weight and has a nice crunch. Theirs is nice and doughy, which I do like, but it doesn't have that solid crust I really like in a pizza. Their toppings are great and all work well together, but there is very little.. I know this is supposed to be how traditional pizzas are, but I guess my poor student budget doesn't agree with it too much.    This isn't the best pizza in my eyes, but everyone has different tastes. It is undeniably good in terms of quality of toppings, but it just doesn't have the amount I would like. And that crust, it leaves me wanting more crunch!",

The salad was refreshing and delicious.  We ordered two pizzas - Margherita with crushed tomatoes, buffalo mozzarella, basil, parmigiano reggiano and extra virgin olive oil and Settebello with crushed tomatoes, pancetta, sausage, roasted mushrooms, toasted pine nuts, mozzarella, basil and extra virgin olive oil.  The pizzas were light and thin crusted, and the toppings were fresh and flavorful. The salad and pizza were delicious, and we'll dine here again when we're back in Vegas.",

My buddy Wayne C. showed me Settebello and explained to me the story behind their pizza making and how their ingredients are flown fresh from Italy to be prepared right here in Vegas.  The pizza definitely accounts for the taste and the price was actually pretty decent, which is surprising.  I usually equate the GVR area with forking out tons of cash but I was pleasantly surprised with Settebello's quality and pricing.  Since I've visited here, it has become pretty hard to munch on a regular ol' pizza and put a smile on because most other pizza pies I've tried doesn't even compare.  Definitely won over my vote for best pizza ever and I look forward to frequenting this joint again to try the Italian drinks and appetizers.",

The pizza was so thin I could see through it. Crust was crispy, the gobs of cheese melted in your mouth and the sausage was seasoned well with the right amount of heat.   Best pizza I've had in a long time. Don't waste any time, come here. You won't regret it.",

I'm a huge fan of Buffalo Mozzarella (creamier, softer, and sweeter than than cheese from normal cows), which they have here (The Margherita DOC). You'll never go back from buffalo mozzarella -- go the extra mile. You'll never (and should never) go anywhere else for pizza in the Valley.",

There are mixed reviews, but despite my better judgment we went for it yesterday.   We ordered their misto plate, basically pizza bread with meat and veggies, their settebello pizza and their lasagna pizza. The misto was salty from the bread to the meats paired with it. The veggies were cooked then chilled, which wasn't pleasant to me. As for their pizza, it's okay. The crust is chewy, toppings are okay and the sauce is between acidic & tangy. Overall, edible but nothing I'll crave again.   Good experience with service but the food is too mediocre for my taste. Sorry fans of settebello--I am not a fan.",

    "text": "This was my third visit to Settebello and it was definitely my last.  One of the reasons I am willing to pay for over priced pizza is because they offer gluten free crust. The other reason I came here was because I love Nutella on a pizza for a dessert and this is one of the few places where they offer it. My friend and I decided to split a pizza for dinner and intended to share a Nutella pizza for dessert. I ordered the gluten free pizza and told the waiter that we would also be ordering a dessert pizza. After we ate the first pizza, I told the waiter that we were ready to order the dessert pizza. He said, \"I hope you didn't want that gluten free, we don't offer it.\" I corrected him and told him I had eaten a gluten free Nutella pizza there before and I knew they offered it. He went to check with the kitchen and then came out and told me they would not sell me a gf dessert pizza because \"they we were running out of gluten free crusts and they were saving them for regular pizza orders.\" Seriously?! I am PAYING for the pizza, plus I am paying the ridiculous up charge for a gluten free crust.  Apparently their idea of customer service does not include serving customers who want gluten free pizza unless they want to order the $20 pizza versus the $16 dessert pizza.  Well, don't worry Settebello, I won't be bothering you with requests for gluten free pizza again.",

Here they make all their pizza wood fired and having been to Italy before, this place tastes just like pizza you could find in Italy.

Our only complaint is that we've been twice and even though we asked for well done the second time, the center of the pizza was soggy. The crust is delicious and the sauce creates a flavor explosion... So there has to be a way to keep the pizza napolentana style on the soft style without getting a soggy center. I still loved it, just can't do take out or leftovers because you would open up a really soggy mess if you tried to eat it on the second day.   We will definitely be back time and time again.",

You can never go wrong with the cheese pie. Which one person can eat themselves! Or order a couple and share. I love the little marks the food gets because it comes straight from the oven.

The decor is chic and modern and the food was delicious and satisfying.      The bummer:  the waitress and entry phase.  We had to flag her several times and it seems we were bothering her.  The place was not crowded at the time(4 in the afternoon).  Also we had our children with us and they didn't offer crayons or a kids' menu at the beginning of the experience. How do I know they have those items?  We saw them at the entry podium.      There needs to be a refresher course on customer service for the serving staff.",

If you want a good pizza and a good atmosphere your better off going to metro pizza. I've gone there countless times and haven't been disappointed yet. Even a 5 dollar hot and ready is better than this fraud of a pizza joint.",

Atmosphere here is very casual with a full bar serving by the side. All their ingredients are imported from Italy (flours, olive oil, cheese, tomato, Prosciutto Cott...) I pretty much tried everything on menu already. Everything tastes good. Here are my fav: 1.) Settebello pizza, 2.)Capriccios pizza,3.) Bianc pizza, 4.) Insalata Grand salad, 5.) Caprese, 6.) Panna Cotta   Also, they do have happy hours. All small bites are $5 each with half priced selected cocktails and beers.",

I give it five stars because the pizza is delicious and reminds me of the year and a half I spent in Italy. It's not like the standard American-style pizza served by nearly every other pizza joint.  But don't let that scare you.  I'm not a pizza snob, I'll gulp down the ordinary stuff too.  Ordinary is ordinary, Settebello is Pizza Napoletana and worth trying.   My favorite pizza is the Settebello with olives substituted for the pine nuts.  If I'm lucky and can eat there often enough that I don't want the same thing as last time, then I go with the Diavola.  A great combination of flavor and kick.   The service has always been attentive.  I've not had a bad experience in the dozen or so times I've been in.",

    "text": "Incredibile, Gustoso, Fantastico, Bella, Semplicemente la Migliore.  I do NOT speak italian, however, when you taste the food here, your mouth will be exploding with simple and great flavors that you will describe as Amazing, Tasty, Fantastic, Beautiful and Simply the Best!  1.  Parking - In the District and parking in the area they are at is very, very good. easy and short walk!  2.  Ambiance - Very nice, you feel like you are in  an urban environment compared to other places, and certainly 100% more visible than their former location at an empty strip mall on Horizon Ridge.  3.  The Wait - If you go during peak times, guess what, you gonna wait. There is not much room to wait, so you can give them your cell and walk around and wait outside or at a few of the shops. This is where West Elm gets most of their foot traffic me thinks.  If you go at slightly off hours,  like dinner on Friday at 7:45 pm to 9:00 pm, you can usually get a table immediately. During normal hours, you get a lot of larger families.  4.  The Food - Wow. what can i say?  I love PIZZA. I love Martino's Pizza at their place on Coronado Center and Eastern. I love Metro. I really enjoyed 3 Brothers when they were open.  I enjoy all the stuff in a mixed combo.  I would scarf down these pizzas!  Here at Settobello, the pizza is so DIFFERENT and so amazing...  a.  the ingredients - sure they have some combo's, yet the tastes are not overpowering or oily( I like this) or with tomato sauce.  the tastes are so subtle and so delicate, yet when mixed, just as good if not better than the normal pizza from other places.  b.  the crust - Wow again. the texture and taste, with it's slight taste from being cooked in a very hot wood fired oven. I cannot imagine that I, who usually stuff my mouth with food and swallow, stopped to experience the simple tastes. I normally don't get all that! I am the kinda person that when you ask me  how the red wine tastes, I will tell you it was, well, red. I don't distinguish the subtle flavors normally and for this place and their pizza, it was a great experience to do this!!!  c.  the how - as the crust is thin and the serving is about 12-14 inches round approximately, it is best to ask for it sliced if you are sharing, or at least eat with fork and knife.  If you are sharing go for whatever you  want to try, however, one pizza is plenty for one person, as it is thin.  We had the Settebello, the Margherita and the Pizza Lasagna... I am going back soon and maybe today!  5.  Dessert - Order the Nutella Pizza early, as it takes time to cook like a regular pizza, as it is the same pizza crust topped with nutella. You have like Nutella, however, I do and my kids do and this was a great tasting hot pizza dessert.  We also tried the Panna Cotta which was great.   6.  Service - While I was waiting with three kids for 35 minutes on a hot evening for a table, I could not help but watch the service.  Never, let first impression rule you. I assumed the service was going to be unorganized, all over the place, and just not efficient. What I got was caring, a lot of people jumping in to hep each other. Simply I experienced a group of people working toward a great experience. Very nice.  From a reformed pizza scarfer to one that likes this stuff they serve here at Settebello, I say, GO FOR IT.   GET OFF YOUR BUTTSKI and GO NOW.  Take action NOW.  Imma getting hungry.....",

Absolutely worth the hype.   We started with a couple glasses of red wine and the Involtini appetizer (arugula and goat cheese wrapped in proscuitto crudo)... amazing. It was every bit as good as it sounds. Delicious and fresh and the perfect portion size for us.  After inquiring with our server on his favorite pizzas, we landed on the Diavola and the special for the evening which was a Bacon Jam Pizza. Both were absolutely incredible... I couldn't even pick a favorite. The Diavola was spicy and had the traditional red sauce which the Bacon Jam was the perfect mix of salty and sweet, with goat cheese and a white sauce base.   I saved room for some *peanut butter gelato* that was decadent and rich... an excellent pair for my red wine.   I have no complaints! I loved the ambiance and the service (the servers were all very good looking... not that that matters ;).   Next time I'm in Henderson, Settebello is my first stop!",

Even though the door was closed and no one was out there they were happy to let us out there even though it would mean more walking for them! We had the whole patio to ourselves, it was great. I don't know why but we were treated like royalty, the service is go great.  The pizza's are awesome, my sister-in-law lived in Italy for 2 years and said it was legit Italian pizza. The pizzas came out fast, I fold each piece and eat it like a pizza taco. I always save the crust to eat with the balsamic vinegar. Definitely my favorite pizza joint! We had the bomba for dessert and it was delicious and big enough for two to share and be satisfied.   This place is OK for kids, just be mindful of the other customers. :)  As for leftovers (if you somehow happen to have some) I reheat mine in the oven, not the microwave, and it tastes much better.",

    "text": "Wow. What can I say except the best pizza I have ever ever eaten in this country. Yes, it is that good. Trust me, this is how neapolitan pizza should be. They are True artisans. They are recognized by pizzaiolo association in Napoli, Italy. All of their ingredients are of the best quality and even sourced from Italy, i.e. cheese from Modena, prosciutto from Parma, tomatoes fromSan Marzano, etc. I think even thelour is from Naples.   All of the appetizers are delectable, bt my favorite is the involtini di proscuitto, prosciutto wrapped around arugula and goat cheese with a sprinkling of balsamic and some parm. Sublime. Theyoffer about 6 house made pizzas, but I always go with the margherita and two toppings. They recommend you limit it to two in order to savor it fully. This is how it should be, in my opinion. I usually get mushrooms and prosciutto crudo, it is the best!",

Couldn't wait for the meatballs smothered in delicious marinara and cheese, my Prosciutto Wrapped Arugula salad and  Settebelo Pizza.  The waiter took our drink order and we ordered the meatballs.  After about 5-10 minutes he came back and  took the rest of order of the salad and pizza.  He asked if we cared if it came out as it was ready and we said sure no problem, thinking the meatballs would be first and maybe the salad then the pizza.  The pizza came out in about 3 minutes after the order was taken and that had me thinking it's was someone else's pizza then the salad came out after the pizza and then heaven showed up THE MEATBALLS!!!! As I cut into the meatballs and placed on in my mouth I've come to find out, the hard way, they were all frozen in the middle.  I Mean really FROZEN. Sent them back and no manager stopped by and the waiter went into ignore mode!!!",

    "text": "On this visit I once again had the quattro formaggi - topped with tomatoes, fontina, gorgonzola, mozzarella, and parmigiana reggiano cheeses, strips of fresh basil and evoo.  The gorgonzola cheese was really overpowering - I think some accidentally slipped through the chef's fingers because it's never tasted this strong. For this reason (and the tiramisu, which I'll get to later) I gave it 4 starts, which is killing me as I love this place.  The restaurant was packed (on a Thursday night) so we opted to eat at the bar. I would definitely eat there again as the counter area was huge!  We decided to try dessert for the first time. My husband has never met a  tiramisu he didn't fall in love with, but this one was just ok. I tasted it and was really disappointed, but we come here for the best pizza on earth so we can live with the fact that their tiramisu sucks!  There was something called the Dream Bomba calling my name, so I forced myself to order it: chocolate covered peanut butter gelato with caramel and chocolate drizzled over the top. OMG it was fabulous - da bomba!",

I give the pizza 4 stars, just because I prefer a thicker crust and less cheese than there was on it.   Review is 3 stars because of the service. The beer I ordered was room temperature, and nothing can ruin a meal like a warm beer. The wrong pizza was brought out, but was quickly remade, and our water was refilled once in an hour even though my cup was empty for a long time.

Wine list could use a bit of a selection, among the dessert list. Wished we got the Nutella pizza instead of deciding to burn some calories by walking over to whole foods for their nasty Mochi ice cream. Yuck!

    "text": "The smell of pizza welcomes you as you enter the restaurant. You can see the beautiful oven from Naples, just like the one that I saw when I went to a pizzeria in Napoli, Italia. We didn't want to wait for a table, so we sat at the bar. Over large marble slabs, the bartender reached across, put down two bar napkins and asked us what drinks we'd like.  We ordered:  Del Sole: Vodka, Campari, Limoncello, Orange Citrus, and some tart yet sweet concoction, mixed up to create a 16 oz. sunsetting blended color of deliciousness that paired quite well with the pizza, possibly because of the tomatoes' acidity. Del Sole means \"of the sun.\" Oh what fun!  Negroni: Gin, Vermouth, and Campari, came on the rocks and with a lot of strength. This 8-ouncer'll do you in on an empty stomach, and although it doesn't completely complement the food, it's got a kick to it. Negroni means \"big black ones.\"  After she gave us drinks, she put our order in for the Antipasto called Involtini di Prosciutto, meaning Wraps of Prosciutto.  Involtini di Prosciutto: Two wraps of thinly shaved prosciutto tightly stuffing arugula together, just like a bacon-wrapped hot dog, with shaved parmigiano reggiano and mini chunks of goat cheese to create a flavorful party for your palate.  While we were snacking on that, our bartender asked us what we'd like for our meal.   We chose:  Margherita Pizza: San Marzano tomatoes crushed into an amazingly sweet and slightly tart sauce, basil, mozzarella, and olive oil. The pizza crust came out with air bubbles just like the pizza in Naples. However, the crust was not crispy like the crust in Naples. Either way, the sauce is truly intensely packed with flavor and the pizza was great none the less. We got the pizza unsliced because that's how Italians get their pizzas.  Settebello: the same awesome tomato sauce, pancetta, mozzarella, thinly sliced oven roasted fennel sausage, white button mushrooms, pine nuts and basil. Pine nuts go very well with basil. This pizza is an art piece meant to be devoured as a savage and enjoyed as a king. It was absolutely delicious. Again, we got it unsliced, but next time, we might just have to slice it.   We didn't order dessert as I had tiramisu waiting at home, but we did see the bartender keep scooping ice cream for spumoni and we overheard her not being sure whether it was cherry or strawberry, but nonetheless we're sure it was delicious.   We will be back for more and to try different things on the menu next time. Arrivederci.",

This location is \"out there\" if you live in LV proper, but perfect for folks in the 'burbs like my family. They don't have to get a sitter for the night and trek all the way to the Strip or Downtown for a nice meal.   Warning: Setebello gets packed between 6:30-8 pm! Even around Christmas, we had to wait a good 15-20 minutes to be seated. And no reservations for groups under 8 people. There's a small bar where you can have a cocktail and wait. They serve several wines by the glass and make a mean cocktail as well.  Pizza is well worth it! They really nail that Neapolitan crust - bubbly with just a pinch of black on the bottom. Always order the house special (if it's still available) and a Margherita. You can't go wrong with either.  Of all the fine dining experiences in Las Vegas, Setebello is a nice alternative. It's casual, family friendly and still serves gourmet pizza. You don't have to stress about parking or wearing anything shiny, just show up and expect to carb out a little. With wine, of course.",

    "text": "This was my very first time trying this style of pizza.  What I liked about it was that it was simple, light, and not greasy like some pizzas can be. The cheese on the pizza was superb, and the chewiness of it went perfectly well with the rather flat, thin dough. That was the part I didn't like too much about my pizza; the pizza dough was very bland and tasted a bit like what I would imagine what hardtack would taste like.  I suppose it contributes to the simplicity and lightness of the pizza; nevertheless, it lacked flavour, save for the burnt black bits at the edge. I'm glad the cheese and the toppings were good enough that this didn't bother me too much.  I would've given this restaurant three stars if I hadn't ordered dessert.  The dessert menu had many appealing choices, but I had no trouble settling on the Affogato (I am an espresso enthusiast.) I chose chocolate gelato to go with the espresso.  The gelato was creamy and smooth, just as I would expect out of anything labelled \"gelato.\"  It was a delicious dessert for a mocha-lover like me.  The tiramisu was also good; the best part about it was that it wasn't too sweet, which seems to be a common flaw in many tiramisus.   The service was just fine; everyone was attentive and fast, and I had a good experience here.",

There prices did go up $1 across the board about 6 months ago which puts them in borderline outrageous pricing for what they serve, but the District @ GVR is definitely a \"mini strip\" with restaurant offerings that are all premium compared to other local eateries.",

Overall I enjoyed the beet salad more due to the dressing and the wonderful flavors. I found the Insalata Grande bland and boring. I loved the portion sizes as they were quite large, enough for two to share one salad.   I liked the fact that they offer several pizzas without a tomato base. The pizzas are 12 inches round and enough to fill up two people with a decent appetite We ordered the Vena pizza which we enjoyed. We added the arugula from the salads on top of the pizza which made it more flavorful.  I would like to return in the near future and try some of their other pizzas!",

I've eaaily visited this location more than 200 times, never a complaint.  I was also a patron at the old location off Horizon Ridge Parkway.   Visited last night with friends as our guests.  4 salads, wines, 4 pizzas.  My pizza came first, cold, soggy.  It had sat ready before it was brought to me.  Wait, wait, wait for the other 3.  5 minutes, 10 minutes, 15 minutes the other 3 pizzas arrived.  Mentioned, just mentioned this to food server, she said \"Sorry, they only can do 5 pizzas at a time\".  Crazy logic since we were a party of 4. Poor quality, slow service, not on my list of must visit places anymore.  Sadly, quality and service greatly diminished.",

We asked the Trader Joes checkout lady where we should go. She said \"the pizza place on the corner of the Whole Foods shopping plaza.\" So off we went in search of pizza.   The front door displays several restaurant recognition stickers (Michelin, Zagat, Trip Advisor, etc.). We arrived and were greeted with a friendly staff. The menu is appetizers, salads, and pizza. No mas. We ordered a salad and pizza. Let me break it down for you.   Salad: Involtini di Prosciutto - Ingredients: Prosciutto Crudo Wrapped Around Baby Arugula and Goat Cheese. Topped With Goat Cheese, Shaved Parmigiano-Reggiano, Balsamic Reduction and Extra Virgin Olive Oil - Review: Had 4 slices of delicious, thinly sliced smoked proscuitto that really enhanced the salad. Balsamic reduction added a nice touch to the already flavorful lemon based oil dressing.  Pizza: Settebello - Ingredients: Crushed Tomatoes, Pancetta, Wood Oven Sausage, Roasted Mushrooms, Toasted Pine Nuts, Mozzarella, Basil, Extra Virgin Olive Oil - Review: Pancetta was thick and fatty. Yum. Fresh tomato sauce. Good combination of fresh flavors.   Got my fix of pork balanced with fresh ingredients. My stomach was full and happy.",

Thin-crust pizzas are notoriously crunchy, thanks to their slim and crispy base. I came in searching for fresh and minimal ingredients to quench my thin crust pizza craving. I settled for the traditional Margherita with Crushed Tomatoes, Mozzarella, Basil, Parmigiano Reggiano, Extra Virgin Olive Oil. The only drawback is that the crust is sensitive and tends to burn hastily, but in retrospect, still compliments the overall package.  This establishment is popular with those on the go who are looking for a lighter pizza choice.",

Has arugula , prosciutto crisps , fresh fennel , fresh juicy yellow & red grape tomatoes and cucumber. Off the top of my head I may have forgotten something. Oh yah ! The Parmesan ! How could I forget ?!It's so buttery and creamy it literally melts in your mouth. You can definitely taste the quality of the tomatoes. Super yummy and the olive oil. Must have been some good olive oil. Oh my.   The Emilia - white pizza with prosciutto and basil. Heavenly ! The saltiness of the cheese and prosciutto with the chewiness of the crust. Basil on top. OMG !   Margarita with pancetta. My sister decided to order pancetta on hers. Honestly I would have appreciated a bit more cheese but this is Neapolitan style pizza and I think less cheese is what they're aiming for. It was good just probably would have been better with the Spicy pepperoni.   Remember these pizzas look bigger in photos then they actually are and can feed one hungry person and 2 semi hungry people.   Tiramisu - this was rich , creamy and decadent perfection. Layered with lady fingers , cream and espresso. You could definitely taste the sharp kick of espresso. It was so good !   Servers were all friendly and helpful I will definitely be back for more pizza and dessert !",

I just dont get all the raves, I have lived in Italy and I  know anybody trying to serve a pizza like Settebello would never stay in business for long. First order is a good dough - Settebellos dough I suspect is frozen, low gluten, the same stuff white bread is made out off.  Sure they blister it nicely before serving, but it has no flavor, the crust alone taste like hot dog buns. There is not a hint of good quality olive oil on the crust and the crust comes to the table with the middle so soggy it was gross.  The crust was so mushy we had to ask for a fork scrap off the ingredients and eat them solo - the crust simple was not for human consumption and stayed on the plate - a gummy mess. The top ingredients are for the most part good, cheese is good, not so much the sausage, but that is a matter of individual taste. We had wine which comes in silly tiny non stem glasses. The wine list is okay, nothing interesting or ambitious, but then again it befits everything Settebello stands for. We did not have the courage to try the desserts after seeing them on a table next to us having been left half eaten. Would we go back,? No,of course not - the search for a good pizza in LV goes on.",

For our main entree, we ordered the Quatro \"something\" thin-crust pizza (My Italian sucks!), which included salami, sausage, mushrooms, and calmata olives. However, Theresa B. isn't fond of olives, so we substituted with arugula instead. The food was delicious! The only bad thing was that they served the arugula uncooked on top of the pizza.

I hate the layout. It can't be feng shui, I know that. Having all the tables pushed to one wall, the open kitchen off to the other, separated by a no-mans-land about 20 feet wide presumably for waitstaff and customers trying to get to the bathroom, and the long counter off the kitchen with a single stool (who is that for? was there supposed to be counter seating?) really doesn't feel right.  That said, the food is really great. Enough to far outweigh all the negatives. Like, I can't believe this kind of pizza can be found in this town. Every other piece of pizza I've had in Vegas has totally sucked, and here's this little place that just totally nails it with traditionally made, wood fired hearth cooked pizzas. 3 and just under 1/2.",

    "text": "To date, I've found no one in the Vegas valley who does Neapolitan pizza better than Settebello. Granted, they're not my favorite in the entire U.S. (Pepe's in New Haven, CT would take the cake there with their Everyman pricing and their variety of toppings/options), but they do what they do, and they do it consistently well.  Never once do we come here and wonder how flavorful or well-spiced or well-cooked our food I'd going to be. Obviously, they've found a formula and they're good at teaching their staff to prepare, cook, & serve their pizzas and salads to their exact specifications -- and I really dig that! I like not having to gamble on the expected tastiness of my lunch or dinner (coughBRIOcough).  For what they are, they're a tad bit on the pricey side, which I blame in part on the franchise (though I have no idea what the original location in SLC charges) and in part on the fact that the spot they chose is in The District, which is infamously in such debt as to be in foreclosure. I also blame this in part on the fancy-pants imported ingredients, but I guess one has to do all that to get one's \"Vera pizza napoletana\" certification. Yeah, not bloody likely, but anyway...  The pizzas are on the largish side for one person, but not quite enough for two. However, splitting a salad AND a pizza seems to be just the right amount of food without feeling uncomfortably full. My boyfriend do this every time we go and it's perfect (he's got a pretty healthy appetite, too). I can recommend anything on the whole menu, as long as you like the ingredients. I'm not a huge fan of sausage--yes, ha, ha--so I like to stick with the other meats. I won't eat mushrooms on pizza & they're happy to leave those off for me. If you're a pepperoni lover, try the peppered salami; it's the closest thing to pepperoni that they have there, and it's even SO much tastier!! They also have the best damn espresso & biscotti I've pretty much ever had.  My only semi-complaint about this place is the service, and then only sometimes. The kids (the servers look like they're barely halfway through high school, which in and of itself isn't a bad thing) are pretty nice and helpful most of the time, though you get the occasional one who's sulking around in a cloud of bummed-out-ness (I'm assuming because some girl/guy didn't smile at them in math class that morning) and thus doesn't seem to be super excited to be there serving you. That's fine with me, though -- I don't mind that as much as when they get super bored and hover over you like a hawk. For example, we went for dinner on July 4th and there weren't too many patrons, but several servers. No fewer than three of them came by no fewer than 5 times each while I was STILL EATING and wanted to take my plate. One guy literally came over and stood there as I swished my last bites of crust around in oil/vinegar on my plate and raised it to my mouth--which I did very slowly as I stared him down--so he could take it to the kitchen for something to do. Go fold some napkins, son! Go refill the condiment bottles! I could easily come up with a list of things you can do that doesn't include stalking me for my plate. Oy.  I'd knock half a star off for that, but Yelp still hasn't gotten with the program and allowed half stars. (Hint hint! Get with it!) Bottom line, I'll still keep coming back time after time for the most consistently delicious Neapolitan-style pizza in the valley, and the more-often-than-not good, friendly service!",

    "text": "Pizza reviews, in my opinion, should be separated by catagory/type of pizza. Chicago style, Cali style, NY style, chain, Napoli style, etc. All potentially delicious, but with very different and crucial characteristics.   Settebello is Napoli style at its best! Brick, wood fired oven, thin stretchy crust....*drool* sorry! I try to attempt to switch it up and try all their different pies. It helps when the whole family goes so I can try someone else's as I'm addicted to the Bianca... prosciutto crudo, parm, mozz, olive oil topped with fresh arugola that wilts slightly from the heat of the pie. Man, it's good! But I have managed to order others, and here's a few stand-outs for me: the Diavalo, crushed tomatoes, peppered salame, roasted red bell peppers, red pepper flakes, garlic, mozz and olive oil. The Capricciosa, crushed tomatoes, prosciutto cotto, artichoke hearts, roasted 'shrooms, olives, mozz and basil. In truth, my family has tried most of the menu and likes it all. A big favorite of ours is their Insalada Grande. For my youngest, my husband and myself, it is our absolute favorite go-to salad in town. The vinaigrette is perfect and it is never over dressed. My oldest likes it as well, but excruciatingly picks out the artichoke hearts (hates the pickled ones), purple leaves (grrrrr) and the parm shavings...all of which her younger sis is more than happy to take off her hands.  We go at least once a month, sometimes more. Last, but not least, for heaven's sake get yourself a cappuccino!!!  It's Illy, and it's bloody perfect!",

I used to live in chicago and while I'm a fan of the chicago-style pizza, I would throw chicago-style pizza in front of a bus to save Napoletana-style pizza's life anyday.  Can we just talk about the crust?  The chewiest, softest, goodest (yeah I know it's not a word) crust in the UNIVERSE.  I've never had a bad pizza here and I've been here probably at least 25 times.  This is my ultimate suggestion to order...no matter how many or few people you are with.  You can always take some home:  Get an apertivi to start.  Anything with Aperol in it is ok by me.  Ensalada Grande (mixed leafy greens, kalamata olives, artichoke, sauteed mushrooms, tomato and parmigiana cheese)  Misto platter--Italian meats, cheese and foccacia bread  ANY pizza or ask for the Ripieno calzone.  It's not on the menu anymore, but by far my favorite.  I like it more than their pizza.  Then pretty much any dessert.  Happy eating yo!",

    "text": "We had spent the afternoon at the Fine Art Gallery in Bellagio getting inspired by the Monet's. We decided on an early dinner and headed to The District to go to Cheesecake Factory. Well, the wait was a good 45 minutes. I was willing to wait but we had the kids with us so my husband recommend we walk over to Settebello. We had never been there before but we always pass by when we head to Cheesecake or Whole Foods. Every time it looks like everyone is having a great time and the vibe looks awesome. It was busy but we were seated right away. The decor is lovely and adds to the vibe...relaxed chic, perhaps. All of the servers are young and well, attractive. But better yet, they are super friendly! I love that in a  server- just talk to me like you're my friend... Also, he spoke to my daughter and her friend (5 and 10 yrs old) very sweetly as well. He kept asking \"Girls, do you need anything? Girls, are you okay?\" It was very endearing. He even gave them some breadsticks that come with the kids meal even though they did not get a kids meal. I could tell from the moment I tasted my Americano that they only use premium ingredients. It was a very fine Italian coffee. I have to say that Naples style pizza is my favorite and Settebello does an excellent job at it. The ingredients are just so quality and that makes them so delicious. I ordered the Capriossa- mushrooms, artichoke hearts, Kalamata olives, basil and olive oil. It was such a lovely melody of flavors! Also, the meal was very light (especially for pizza). It was just such a lovely experience all around. I was so very impressed by the quality of food and service.",

All of the ingredients seemed fresh and simply prepared.  I had the settebello pizza which had great flavor, the crust had great texture and I do not remember the center of the pizza being too soggy as is common with other Napoleon style pizza places.  At the end of the meal I tried the panna cotta, which was very good and had a healthy amount of strawberries and sauce.  Over all this meal was great, all of the food was fresh and delicious.",

We had to ask several times on several occasions to get a drink even after putting our empty glasses out towards the bartender to signify we were looking for another drink (which was just a bottle of beer - not like he had to make some foo-foo drink that took 5 minutes to make). Bartender did not explain the way happy hour worked & when we questioned him on it - he gave us attitude. He had originally told us that he had put in our drink order before happy was over but when we asked him to get our order he said that we could pay for another drink if we wanted it instead - it should have been on the happy hour special. Ordered the small pizza with sausage on it - it was so doughy in the middle it was gross & just a floppy mess. He also added my items into another group of people's bill even though I came 45 minutes after them instead of starting my own separate bill. I wouldn't even spend the $5 for happy hour here for food or drink. It's definitely not worth it even if it's not far from my house.",

I just didn't see what all the 5 star rating was about. maybe I didn't order the right thing? if you go here you won't regret that you went, however there are other places that are comparable as well.",

    "text": "After much anticipation and plenty of procrastination, I have finally gotten around to trying out Setebello after my girlfriend and I decided we were craving pizza. If you come here expecting a big, greasy chicago style deep dish however, you will be disappointed (and stupid, for not reading the title of the restaurant). They only do authentic Neapolitan pizza here and that is what you will get. If you are open minded to this drastically different definition of pizza however, you will fall in love.   It's cozy inside. There are a couple of non-descript italian themed decorations, a modest bar and a fire oven conspicuously  located in the middle of the establishment. If you go in the evening there's bound to be a wait but trust me when I say it's worth it. We were eventually seated and our friendly waiter was happy to explain the quality of the ingredients, the serving size, and a number of other questions a foodie like myself would normally ask during a first time dining experience.   A single pizza tends to serve one average appetite, or two small appetites (with the addition of an antipasti). My girlfriend chose the spicy Diavola and I went with the popular Capricciosa. They were simply heavenly. My pizza was delicately covered in artichoke, roasted peppers, succulent olives, and fresh basil which added perfect flavor to the mouth watering cheese over their fresh crushed tomatoes. Believe me when I say you can taste the difference between these quality ingredients and the crap you can buy at a major corporate pizza joint.   It's surprisingly thin and light-- many people eat it with a knife and fork and you can always request to have it served sliced if you wish. It's perfect if you aren't in the mood for excessive carbs or fats but still want a satisfying meal. I had no problem finishing the whole thing and could have easily eaten the other half of my girlfriends pizza but she insisted on saving it for later :P  I have had Neapolitan style pizza before and my girlfriend has had the stuff in authentic eateries in Italy. Both of us concluded that this was, without question, the best pizza we have ever tasted. This has instantly become one of my favorite spots and I guarantee I will be back here several times over the next few months. If you are in the Henderson area and you have not tried Setebello, you have NO excuse not to come here. Hell, if you're lactose intolerant pop a lactase pill and join in on the fun-- I firmly believe all residents of the area owe it to themselves to experience this place.",

    "text": "Settebello has what seems to be extremely authentic Italian Pizza. I, not being Italian, have zero credibility for this claim, but they use Italian Words to describe them and they are very lightly cheesed. Some are not cheesed at all if you'll believe it. They also believe in whole olives as a topping. All of it with lots of Olive Oil, all of it is excellent. This is serious pizza. It is also very little pizza. This is the only pizza place where I can comfortably eat the whole pizza. All of it. Despite having a substantial radius, the pizza is virtually two dimensional. Pizza.  Beware adding toppings: you'll pay for it. Not saying it's not worth it, the Italian meats here are exquisite, but it may require you to redistribute your stock portfolio.  The authentic Italian beers have prices that make even the most seasoned beer snob (and yes I mean myself) wince. It's not like Italy is known for beer, and these beers are largelly unknown outside of their native land. $15+ They dramatically skew the value proposition if you're looking for an exotic beer drinking night. Regular beers  are more reasonable, but unremarkable.  The prices are overall great. Most of the better pizzas are $12 or less. Keep in mind they are just for one person, but still an excellent value. The dining room is small but pleasant and gets great light. Service has been great.  They don't have ranch. I realize this is very \"authentic\" but they need ranch.",

Only the finest ingredients are used, especially in regard to the Misto appetizer (a sampling of Italian style meats, vegetables and cheese served with focaccia).  The menu is sufficient in size, but focuses mainly on pizzas (no pasta etc.). Daily/weekly specials do add more variety (these are not posted on the website/menu).  The service however, leaves something to be desired. The wait staff is courteous, but lacks enthusiasm, speed, and the cultural/culinary knowledge I expect when dining at such an authentic restaurant.",

    "text": "Pizza is a way of life for me. I take it as serious as somebody would take an IRS audit or having a child. Pizza holds the hope of a nation inside of it's golden flaky crust. We are the children.   Whatever. This is Las Vegas, home to thousands of transplants from the mid-west. Anytime somebody talks about pizza, everybody has some random story about the hole in the wall from their town that makes the best pizza ever. Every place out here is a chain or a gut bomb grease fest. What does it take to get a decent pie out west?   I'm not sure Settebello qualifies. This pizza is sort of a subsidiary of the normal pie quest I reference above. Yes, it is pizza. Sure, it is delicious, but it's not what you're thinking of when you're sitting around with a few buddies watching a football game and somebody says \"Hey, let's get a pie\".   Settebello is a traditional pizza in every sense of the phrase. They have several topping choices which will remind you of your typical topping choices, but taste 10x better. On this occasion I ordered the Margherita pizza with the wood fired sausage. It was amazingly good, but again, not a normal pie. The sauce is basically crushed tomatoes, but the best tasting crushed tomatoes you could imagine. They throw a little basil and mozzarella on there and you're good to go.   If you don't arrive here expecting a pie in the American sense of the word, you'll be just fine. Just make sure you ask them to cut the pizza for you, because they won't if you don't ask them.   Minus one star because the olive oil / vinegar bottles they leave on the table leak EVERY SINGLE TIME, which prompts you to have it on your cell phone, or shades, or all over your hands, etc. It's annoying.   Yo Settebello, get some new oil / vinegar bottles, na'mean?",

They will serve you a whole uncut pizza unless you ask for it to be cut and sometimes I forget this, it makes me wonder why? I guess that is how they do it in the old country or something, every restaurant needs it's little twist, but that is kind of annoying. I think they should do the opposite and serve it cut and ask if you want it whole! Two individual pizzas, split a salad and a soft beverage and your at $50 for two, just seems expensive for pizza, maybe that is from my childhood pricing!

Settebello has long been on my list of places to try. It was finally time to give it a whirl.   When visiting the District, I go west on autopilot. Well, I had to turn around because Settebello is on the east side of Green Valley Parkway. I parked and popped in for lunch.    I was quickly seated and I knew just what I wanted, The Margherita DOC ($13.50) with Crushed Tomatoes, Fresh Buffalo Mozzarella, Basil, Parmigiano Reggiano, and Extra Virgin Olive Oil. Settebello serves up Pizza Napoletana and it is authentic. This style of pizza is cooked quickly and typically eaten with a fork and knife, but they will cut it into slices upon request. Settebello's Margherita DOC is pretty darn similar to what I had in Naples. They import ingredients and the quality is noted. However, it's worth mentioning Naples wasn't my favorite pizza in Italy, it's a bit wet for my liking, but still enjoyable when in the mood. My craving was satisfied and the best part? I only had to travel to Green Valley to get it.",

He greeted us and knew from the onset that two of us were first time attendees, two were regulars. He explained a list of things, and gave us some time to look over the menu....lots of time. He was either a greedy server or the manager loaded him down with tables, because he was dashing past us like Hussein Bolt. When we flagged him down to order, he took the order and he later returned with two of the four pizzas. Half of our party began eating (please don't wait for us, it'll be out soon). We were still waiting 10 minutes later and flagged Jake down to ask where the other two pizzas were. His lame excuse was, \"they are just putting the arugula and meatballs on your pizzas. Really? Where did you go? The arugula plant out back? The meatball tree? So half of the food consumed, the second half of our order arrived. Unsatisfactory on all levels. One of us wanted a little more marinara for our pizza, Jake said it would be .50 for that. Really? Yep, he charged us!!! Bad tip from me and I'm a 20% guy. And a bad Yelp review",

I got the namestake Settebello pie and reordered the Nutella pie w/strawberry for dessert this time paired with Hazelnut gelato (the special was oreo, which did not sound personally appealing). While I did not like it as MUCH as the Four Cheese I tried on Sunday, it may have the virginity effect that made that pie taste so much better in my mind; only way to unscientifically test if this is in fact True is to try the Four Cheese again, perhaps this time with the Settebello meat toppings as an add-on. Food was excellent in any case and the service the same.   Observation on the 3PM-6PM 'Happy Hour': 5$ ea. for a mini pizzas sounds great for finishing off the entire menu offerings in regards to pizzas. The next time we visit we will probably go that route; just requires that one sit at the bar.",

My only criticism is that my crust was a little limp, and I had to hold it with two hand to keep my toppings from sliding off, so I recommend asking them to leave it in the oven a little extra to get a firmer crust.",

The bad:  it's not consistent.  Staff seems to be mostly college-age kids and both the food and service varies dramatically.  This trip my pizza had slightly to severely burnt crust all the way around and the staff didn't seem to concerned to fix it.  Service also varies in the same way.  The really great Italian beers---they run out of them, all the time, a real bummer.

    "text": "As a member of an organization called Vera Pizza Napoletana, Settebello follows a set of standards designed to ensure the quality of their signature dish. These standards include working with high-quality ingredients, following an established recipe that includes hand-rolling, and cooking in a real wood-fired oven. The result is pizza that tastes far better than the doughy, sauce-smothered, greasy mess covered with rubbery cheese-substitute that is served in most pizza joints. Like the organization's name says, this is \"True Neapolitan Pizza,\" as Otton himself trained as a pizzaiolo in Italy for 3 years before opening Settebello.  And the pizza at Settebello is sublime -- especially their signature pizza, the Margherita. The crust is thin, chewy, and full of rich, wheaty flavor. The layer of crushed tomato actually tastes like fresh tomatoes with a hint of olive oil. And the mozzarella cheese and fresh basil are perfectly proportioned to complement the pizza without overpowering it. It's pizza you can eat and still feel good about afterwards.  As good as it is, Settebello isn't just about the pizza. Their commitment to quality extends to their entire menu. Their focus on fresh, high-quality ingredients makes for really amazing salads. They don't just pull some roughage out of a bag and pour some dressing over it. At Settebello, they lovingly construct their salads by hand, and it shows, with perfect proportions that create a nice mix of flavors.  My favorite salad is the Insalata Grande, which combines roasted mushrooms, marinated artichokes hearts, pine nuts, kalamata olives, flakes of parmigiano-reggiano, fresh tomatoes, mixed greens and balsamic vinaigrette. The peppery crunch of the greens melds wonderfully with the tangy chewiness of the mushrooms & artichokes, with the tomatoes, nuts & cheese adding nice counterpoints. It's such a fulfilling experience that I've often ordered it as a meal in itself.  I'm no pizza purist. I'm willing to believe in the possibility of good pizza that doesn't follow the tenets of Vera Pizza Napoletana. What matters to me is the final product. Does it taste good? Is it satisfying? Settebello succeeds on both counts, in ways that have kept me coming back again and again.  Also, the service at Settebello is always excellent, and the prices are reasonable.",

A presto.",

Charred crust, crushed tomatoes (they taste so fresh) and fresh garlic, with an assortment of delicious meats and cheeses. It's a little sloppy, which I like - I always fold my slices in half, to avoid oil from the cheese dripping everywhere.  I've tried most of the top-rated pizza joints in town e.g. Pizza Rock, Grimaldi's, Secret Pizza and Settebello is comfortably my favourite",

I did take out since I was rushed and had a good red waiting for me at the hotel. My only regret was not having totally hot and fresh at the restaurant. The crust was thin and had a nice stretch. True to Neopolitan vs NY style, the crust was lightly cooked and not crisp and the cheese was not carmelized. The quality of the ingredients was excellent. I had a Davola and they were not skimpy on the ingredients. I would go so far as to say that if they keep this up they rate in my top 20 worldwide. The price was $14 for what I see as a generous personal pizza. I will price it as $$ but really good for the money value.",

My pizza was so soggy that I couldn't even pick it up, and ended up eating it with a fork.  Also, not much cheese on it at all, just five or six small blobs here and there.  When I eat pizza I want cheese in every bite, and I don't want my bottom crust to be under cooked and soggy.  I guess this type of pizza is just not for me, I'll stick to my traditional pizzeria pizza.",

    "text": "Yum!  In any big city pizza places aren't hard to come by.  Some are fine, some are good, few are great.  If you're looking for a New York, Jersey, or Chicago style pizza, Settebello is not your place.  This is Napoli style. Before you try it, drop the expectations of what you know of pizza.    My first visit to Settebello was on a date.  The date was mediocre, but he got major brownie points for choosing the venue!   That was probably the sole reason any more dates followed... This was at their old location on Horizon Ridge, now they've moved to a more visible and accessible location next to the whole foods in Green Valley.  I was in love with their pizza after my first experience.  Check out their website for their story of their imported oven (one of the super hot brick ovens that cooks the pizzas in under two minutes) and information about the origin of their ingredients.  These pizzas are thin, Napoli style crusts.  Cheese is fresh mozzarella (depending on what pizza you get, it's not standard) applied as splotchy discs - not the half inch thick layering of rubbery mozz that most American pizza eaters are accustomed to.  They treat cheese as it should be treated, less volume, more quality.  Aside from the crunchy on the outside, chewy on the inside crust, the toppings are the reason I return.  High quality tomatoes mingle with marinated mushrooms, caramelized onions, and they serve pizzas where pine nuts and artichoke hearts come standard... Sigh... My response to these pizzas makes my boyfriend jealous.",

I added a few pics from our most recent visit!   Try this place, you'll be hooked too!!! ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Went again today for a late lunch early dinner (5:00pm) with the husband and this time brought a friend...   This place is consistently good!!   Great pizza and salad and great service!!!! There were about 3 girls walking around all the time, if you made eye contact one of them was there to see if there was anything you needed! Our friend ordered the Pizza Lasagna and didnt read the menu good and didnt know it came with ricotta cheese (he doesnt like ricotta) and when he said \"oh, i didnt know it had ricotta\"  they could tell he wasnt happy and they offered 2 times to take it back and make him a new pizza. He ended up keeping it and just picking it off.. but i thought it was very nice of them to offer, even though it was his fault for not reading not theirs.   Keep up the good work Settebello's!!",

Yes, some parts might be a little charred, but it adds to the flavor in my opinion. But the crust is amazing- they import the flour from Italy! The toppings are fresh and very flavourful, and the crushed tomatoes (sauce) is great. Be warned though that they do NOT slice the pizza unless you ask them to. They observe the traditional way it is done back in Italy, and it says so on the menu, so for those who whine about it, learn to read. Be thankful they even offer because if you brought your American butt to Italy and asked for it to be sliced you would be laughed at. Or thrown out.  Their Gellato is good, but try it on their Nutella Pizza (made with the actual Nutella from Europe, not the one sold here in America) and you might die. Of awesomeness.",

    "text": "We tried this restaurant given the high reviews and were disappointed.  Both my wife and I ordered the Settebello.  She substituted the Buffalo mozzarella and I added anchovies.  The food came out quickly (too quickly).  On the good side, the toppings were extremely good although the pancetta was undercooked.  On the bad side, the crust had little flavor, was over charred on the bottom and severely gummy in the center.  The waiter told us that this was standard for Neapolitan pizza, but I've had food in many Neapolitan restaurants and this is just not True.  The oven obviously was too hot and the pizza needed to cook more slowly.  They also need a more flavorful recipe for the dough.  In addition, we asked for parmesan cheese and what came out was the terrible Kraft type parmesan that had little flavor.  It doesn't cost that much to get real parmesan cheese and grate it at the table or right before.  Add to that, the diet coke I had did not have adequate carbonation.  The place was clean and the tables were nice but there is virtually no sound deadening and it is very noisy. The waiter was very nice, however, but you come to a restaurant for the food.  Perhaps we just got a bad meal, but we won't be going back very soon.",

I got margherita pizzas at both and I have to say I can't really pick one over the other. They both have fresh tasting ingredients and great crust. The things I do like better about Settebello is that they offer a happy hour menu, and I did prefer the salads here. I had the Romana salad which had Parmesan and goat cheese, artichoke hearts and prosciutto. Delicious! I'll probably keep going to both places, but if you prefer a nicer sit down restaurant with waiter service, this is the place for you.",

It takes 2 of them for me to consider myself \"full\". Tax and tip, you are at $30 a head on pizza (for me anyway)....but it's REAL good...will probably come back a couple times a year...will check out their location on Sahara in the SW of Vegas.",

Thin slices of prosciutto wrapped around arugula with fresh slices of shaved Parmesan and a drizzle of a balsamic vinegar sauce.  Instead of getting the \"settebello\" (my favorite), I decided to try the Capricciosa. I thought it was really good, my only complaint was the large pieces of artichoke hears. I wish they were a little smaller. The pizza was excellent otherwise and still hot when I got home. I love the Napoli style thin crust pizza here which is cooked very quickly in the brick oven. Yes, its a little pricey but for me definitely worth it!",

They are very conveniently located in a shopping center, which can made it difficult to find parking at times. When you walk in it's very clean, not huge, casual, and everyone is very courteous.   Each pizza is big enough for one very hungry person to each or two not so hungry people to share. I've never had a bad pizza here. My favorite is the the Bianca (and I add prosciutto). Each pizza is very simple and to the point. There isn't anything fancy added just simple, fresh, top-notch ingredients. They don't hide anything. They don't try to reimagine or rediscover the traditional pizza, they make it the way it's supposed to be made.   A must if you are in the area!",

You can tell when someone is actually interested in you and he is. He recommended the Insalata Grande. A lot of people say Balsamic dressing. This was a dressing like I have never tasted (and I've had a lot of Balsamic!)   Did I mention the salad was $14 and big enough to share and had three times the amount of goodies (artichoke, olives...)  Everything thing we had was like nothing I have never tasted.  Next we shared Pizza Bolognese. Hand thrown, bubbly crisp. Remember I said everything tasted like nothing I've ever tasted? The Bolognese is at a completely different level.   Of course I have to have a sweet. Chocolate Gelato was my favorite balance of light and smooth and chocolate.   And again don't forget Tyler. He was just nearby but not in our faces. Delivering our meal himself and checking in at the appropriate times.   No kidding, we had a great time on a Thursday night!",

Settebello is by far the closest thing to what I ate in Italy. My husband is originally from Rome and he loves it as well. On Monday's they have $5 Margherita Pizzas which is a smokin' deal! Even though I absolutely love the food here, I have to mention I was super disappointed in the service when we dined here on 4/29/2019. The restaurant wasn't very busy but our waitress was non-existent. She wasn't very friendly, didn't check to see if our food was okay, and didn't ask if we wanted our empty sodas and waters refilled. She actually didn't check on us once. I don't consider myself a needy diner. Just be somewhat nice and refill our drinks, please! Definitely had the impression she was ready to go home for the night and she wasn't happy too serve us.",

They have a pretty thorough cocktail, wine, and beer list. The menu has appetizers, salads, etc. But, of course, the pizza is the star here. What I like most is that their pizzas are unique. The combinations they create are things you'd never think of. And that makes it difficult to decide on a pizza.  On my latest visit, I opted for a pizza with gorgonzola, prosciutto, and chopped almonds. It was seriously delicious!  A pizza is small enough that a super hungry person can eat it all in one sitting (as did my dining partner). For me, though, I ate half and took half home. And it was still delicious reheated.   The staff were friendly and attentive. Our drinks were never empty, which I always appreciate.   All in all, a great place for pizza!",

I usually opt for something off the daily special list but am also a big fan of the namesake pizza and the Diavola.  The problem is that every so often, I'll be served a pizza that is undercooked or is way overcooked (as in heavily burnt - I definitely appreciate char, but I mean really overcooked). I just don't get the quality control issue since it can go either way.  If you can deal with occasional inconsistency, this is a great place - but it's a gamble.",

To top it off, we're less than a ten minute drive so those urges for pizza can easily be met. The service on our last trip kept our meal from being perfect.  We usually get one of the salads to start and if I don't go hog wild, one pizza is usually good enough for my wife and I still leaving room for dessert. They'll split the salads in two portions for you without request. My wife likes the Insalata Grande ($9) because she loves kalamata olives. The prosciutto platter ($13) is definitely recommended especially with the mozzarella di bufala ($6). The Settebello ($13) is one of our favorite pizzas and we always enjoy the tiramisu ($5.50) for dessert.  What was disappointing on our last visit was our Margherita DOC was brought out literally two minutes after we received our prosciutto platter. Not helping things was that the pie was under-cooked without any charring or blistering so by the time we got to it, things were a soggy room temperature mess. A little common sense with timing from the server and the problem could have been avoided especially when the pizzas only take a minute to fire.  We're hooked and we'll keep coming back. If you come and the service hits the mark, there's no doubt you'll have a great experience.",

    "text": "I will not discount the fact that my previous fifteen visits have been wonderful with great food and good service. But I learned an important fact on my visit yesterday. Don't come Saturday lunch...I thought we arrived late enough to avoid the lunch crowd but I was wrong. Very busy, full restaurant, servers (only 3 of them + a food runner) were out of control. They were on a pace which I considered close to a run. No one greeted us at the door because there was no one as they usually have a host person. A few minutes later a server came. We were seated at a table but then a booth became available. I got up to request from another server a seat in the booth. She said she'd ask....two minutes passed....I then told my wife let's just move there. Of course not without the restaurant rules...it was in another servers station so our previous server literally was not pleased with my decision to move. A young man approached....we ordered and I asked for two waters. Water never came until our food was delivered after I asked again. Food runner was very polite. After our meal was served we never saw our waiter again until I asked for the check. No one checked if we needed anything during our lunch...of course we did. When he delivered my check, it was an inappropriate\"thanks guys.\" I don't like the casualness toward my wife. If I had impeccable service I could possibly overlook it but we didn't.  What did we learn today? Put a wait at the door if your service staff is buried. I'd rather wait ten minutes to ensure we receive the service that I normally expect  with you. I will be back...your food is top notch. 1 * for service. 5 * for food.",

The prices are very reasonable and the ambiance is very Italian.  I had an awesome conversation with the General Manager, Natalia Formisano and a True professional she is who knows the business of management, people, customers, and takes pride in providing services and products that make this pizza place 2nd to none!  As a business man of many entities over the years, she should be promoted to definitely a Regional Manager Position!  Great Job!",

We opt out of sharing a pizza because she wanted to go a vegetarian route and I am all bout my meat. I got the Stelebello pizza minus the mushrooms (yuck!). The meats on the pizza were fresh. I loved the basil and nuts in it. It was probably in the top 5 best pizzas I ever had.   We also ordered some fruity beers. I forgot the names but we shared a apricot beer and a strawberry beer. That strawberry beer is amazing. Ever since we've tried it we have been trying to find it at spirit stores. So good.   The one thing that was a little disappointing was the cannoli. It just didn't meet my expectations. It was a decent size but the shell was too tough. The filling wasn't as good as others I've tried. We also got Affogatos! omg those were to DIE for. I got the hazelnut flavor and it was so good. Best one I've had.   I will definitely come back. It's not on my side of town but I will drive all the way over there just for the pizza and affogatos! Yum.   Also, I didn't get to ask but is pepperoni a topping here? I didn't see it on the menu at All..",

They have a pretty consistent menu of pizza that does not change like the location in Summerlin does. The pizzas are thin, but big enough that you'll probably want to share a pizza with 2 people. Pizza with jalapeno marmalade: Yes, yes, yes. It's the perfect combo of sweet plus spicy and you won't regret your choice. The marmalade is just a light glaze on top, it does not replace the sauce.  Settebello Pizza: Heavy on the meat, lacking in flavor. It was just a regular thin crust pizza with heavy toppings, but nothing special. Skip it and go for something that stands out a little more.  The Summerlin location has a fig marmalade which beats the jalapeno. Can you guys put that on your menu too?!",

The ingredients were quality but I was disappointed that the crust had no crunch.  The cannoli dessert looked great but didn't taste as good as it looked.

I was in the mood to try something new and she was very helpful and had great suggestions. When she suggested the pasta for an entree I almost regretted asking for her input because I thought the pizza's were the reason people went to settebello. Nevertheless, I took her advice and the pasta was DELICIOUS. Apparently they can do no wrong when it comes to Italian food! For anyone going for the first time, I recommend ordering an appetizer and a salad with your meal, they are worth it!!",

Everything was delicious, my Misto platter was definitely big enough as an appetizer for a table of 4-6 people, let alone a whole dinner for one person.  For drinks me and my boyfriend each had a couple of moscow mules and our friend had the Sangria Roja.  The normal prices weren't bad at all, I think the Misto was only $15 and well worth it. We will be back for sure.",

Environment: located in the district near Whole Foods. It is in a pretty busy area. The restaurant itself is pretty small and cute with cool Italian design. They also have a bar area where you can sit as well.  Service: the service was great, the staff were really friendly and were pretty quick about getting or orders in and bringing them out.  Food: I got the lunch special with the beet salad. The salad is so delicious with fresh beets. They give you the red and orange ones and well dressed arugula salad. I ordered the brisket pizza. It was good with melted white cheese and brisket beef with onions. I do feel that the pizza gets kind of soggy in the middle which was a little unpleasant. The crust though taste great if you dip it in vinaigrette. My friends all got the setebello pizza which was good as well. I do feel like it had a lot on it also making it pretty soggy, but it could be because of the rustic dough they use.   Overall, good lunch spot with a good pizza deal and salad. The only drawback for me with the soggy center of the pizza.",

The amount is been spending on uber and lyft eats up a lot of my food adventure expenses.   I came here with my manager and I ordered the Pete e Jalapeno without meat. I didn't realize we were sharing..sad. I could've simply ate the whole pie myself. I guess it's good I didn't since I've been munching all day. Her clients brought her so many goodies!   So this pizza. I'm so glad I came! This is so far the best brick oven pizza in Vegas. The dough was extremely chewy and fluffy and just perfect. The amount of charred pieces on the crust was perfect to stain my teeth. I just love smiling with chunks of pizza pieces. (Sarcasm) the pie was fabulous. The spread they used was way better than I imagined. It had a hint of sweetness.   I really wanted a pie with pesto but didn't see it on the menu.",

They are required to use the same ingredients and cooking methods as it made in Napoli - the home of pizza. Great friendly service. Atmosphere is like any smaller pizza house. No bells and whistles. Just great Napolitano pizza (thin crust in wood fired oven). Smaller bar which I did not try.   Not sure small kids would appreciate the quality.",

The cheese is fresh and sauce is probably the best pizza sauce ever. The saucyness of the pizza can be a turn off to some folks. I really don't think that Napoletana pizza works with topping on top.   I highly recommend that you order Margherita pizza, especially the one with Buffalo Mozzarella. I also tried the Caprese salad for an appetizer. It was delicious. The quality of mozzarella is excellent and favlorfull. During weekdays they have drink specials from 3-6. Its B1G1.",

The waitress was very pleasant and explained how they cook their pizzas.  They are cooked in a 900 degree oven so the crust is crispy and the inside is a little moist.  I order the garden mule, this was very interesting.  It was a spinoff of the Moscow mule with blueberries.  We ordered the warm beet salad and the settebello pizza.  Both were fantastic.  The beets were cooked with goat cheese and pine nuts, the dish came out steaming hot.  The pizza was also delicious.  I will definitely go back.",

With that said this is probably as authentic of a neopolitan pie I'll find in Vegas and I'm ok with that.  The sauce is perfect. The dough could have a more drastic crispy/doughy differentiation but that comes down to the types of flours used not the quality.    One very stiff negative for me is serving Rasputin stout from a bottle, not on nitro.  I was seriously appalled at this oversight.  It doesn't do that amazing beverage justice.",

    "text": "My husband loves pizza and had heard from a coworker that Settebello had excellent authentic pizzas.   We went on a Friday night and it was busy! It was only about a 15 minute wait and they let us know our table was ready by sending a text to my phone.   The restaurant is pretty big and has a nice bar set up. You can also sit outside which is nice. This is a great place for a large group. Today we got a booth which had a marble table top. They have really unique art all over the walls.   The pizza is cooked in a wood oven and the crust is thinner and chewier then most crusts. It kinda reminded me of a whole wheat tortilla. Our waitress explained that the pizzas come in 12 inch personal size.She also explained that traditionally the pizzas are not cut into slices. (But they will if you ask.)   We started with the Rucola Salad and the Focaccia bread. The salad was a bed of Arugula dressed with lemon juice and sea salt. It was ok. Nothing special. The Focaccia bread gave us a sample of the crust to come. I enjoyed dipping it in the nutty olive oil and tangy balsamic vinegar.   For our pizzas I ordered the Emilia which had an alfrado sauce instead of the classic tomato sauce. They called it an Italian cream sauce. It also had prosciutto, basil, parmigiano, and mozzarella cheese. I loved the toppings. They all melted together so well. With all that cheese how could it ever be bad! My husband ordered the Pizza Carbonara which had crushed tomatoes, pancetta, egg, parmigiano, mozzarella cheese, and bits of basil. I liked Joel's, but I have to say I really enjoyed mine more. (He did as well. lol) That Italian cream sauce was so tasty! I would have loved a bowl of that sauce to dip my Focaccia bread in! (mental note that for next time!)   Settebello is a great pizza place. Looks like it also would be a great place for happy hour. They have a full drink menu that I would love to come back and try. The staff was friendly and attentive which is a huge plus. My only gripe would be that it was waaaay hot in there. Like sweating so bad I needed a napkin hot! But other then that my experience was great. When I'm craving real pizza I'll sure be back here.",

The (Moscow) Mule sampler was excessive (in a good way). Three full sized cocktails! Beers are in bottles and not on tap. Service was fantastic. Great advice on selections and very attentive.",

Based on the reviews on Yelp we decided the 20 minute drive to Settebello  would be worth it.  The pizza here is the best I have ever eaten.  The crust has a similar texture and taste of the Indian bread naan.  Does anyone not like that bread?  The sauce and cheese were perfect.  When eating it I thought I died and went to heaven.  One pizza is just the right size for one person.  Every time we visit Las Vegas and want pizza this is the restaurant we will go to.",

    "text": "I like their pizza. It's pretty authentic the way they make their crust and sauce (or don't sauce) the crust.  The reason I give only three stars is because of the toppings. Sometimes the freshness isn't there. For a restaurant that's so close to whole foods, their toppings better be fresh. Otherwise, I'll just go to whole foods and buy the stuff to make my own pizza at home. Of course, then it wouldn't be made in a brick oven, the ingredients would be fresh though!  I like the pizza with arugula on top. The last few times I've been, the pizza was overly oily -which either means they put too much olive oil on or they put too much cheese on while the pizza was just out of the oven- and the arugula was sad looking. Almost like the pizza was made earlier and they reheated it.  Then there are other times I go and the pizza is great!   I think they need a bigger and better appetizer or primi menu. They also need more Italian liquor and Italian wine. Hey, they want to be authentic, don't they?",

My wife ordered appetizer with tomato and basil.  My salad didn't have the goat cheese! Her's didn't have the basil! Waiter told me the goat cheese was mixed in the dressing and could not be seen, weak. We ordered pizza, one full hour later was told it had not been started yet!  We left. I think the poor service was due to the fact we did not order alcohol and we're taking a booth that could hold more people.  I guess if you want  good service and food made according to menu, drink up. Probably won't be back.",

    "text": "Out with my Mom, sister, and niece, we wanted to go somewhere that would satisfy a craving for pizza but still appeal to our need for good, creative food.   Service was fast and friendly for a Friday lunch. The waitress made recommendations we loved; from the wine to desserts, she was able to address all of our \"I am having a hard time choosing between ____________ and ____________. What wine do you have that is not too _________________ but will complement _________________?  She was on her game and catered to the adults as well as the three-year old firecracker sitting across from me.  Mangia! Mangia! The Caesar salad was tangy and bright and crisp. The cheese was sharp and the addition of the anchovies was a great salty bite (and that they offered them was a plus!).   The Misto plate (antipasto plate) was huge! Amazing options for meats and cheeses - four or five each! - and really creative olive and vegetable offerings. The perfect accompaniment to the salad.  Involtini di Prosciutto - Wrapped up a bit like a carpaccio canneloni (or a cannoli, but the inference to the sweet might throw someone off? I digress...), the arugula and goat cheese were wrapped in prosciutto, topped with olive oil, balsamic, a little sea salt, and more shaved cheese. Light, flavorful, and perfectly fresh, you get the bite from the greens, the creamy sharpness of the cheese, and the salty velvet of the meat all in one bite. If I had nothing else at this meal, I would have been supremely happy. This will be easily become a staple for me.  Mom, sis, and the kiddo had pizzas. I tried the toppings of the Quattro (think 4 different pizzas, served on one pie in quadrants) and one of their prosciutto specials and found them to be very tasty. Loved the sauces, the cheese combinations, and the veg/protein options. Again with the fresh, fresh ingredients.  I didn't care for the cannoli. Not that it wasn't made well... but the cream had dried fruit in it and I am purist when it comes to certain things. I have to admit, I'd take the gun and leave the cannoli. The coffee, gelatos and cheesecake were great. Nothing unique, but excellent nonetheless.  A solid, tasty, perfectly executed meal with lots of options, fantastic service, and good pricing (2 huge pizzas, misto, salad, prosciutto, desserts, wine and coffees... for $90?).",

Wow, this was the first time I tried authentic Italian style pizza (I had settabello, which is my favorite). I love the crust, how some part are slightly burnt but I love the flavor of it. The center of pizza got bit soggy yet chewy crust. My friend had other one that had olives, I forgot the name but the amount of olives placed on there tasted overwhelming. We also had caprese, of course, that is always delicious with balsamic vinegar but I could make this at home!   I'll be back to try other items!",

I liked the addition of the Olives and Artichoke Hearts.  I am an Artichoke fiend.  Probably the highlight of the meal.  I decided to try the Pizza Lasagna.  I wanted to see if they were able to capture the essence of a good lasagna.  The Ricotta was nice but it did not represent the fusion of Lasagna and Pizza.  Fork and Knife deal, it was soggy and wouldn't hold up when folded either.  Washed all down with a couple of decent Del Sole.  Maybe the other selections are better but you would have to take another Yelper's word for it because I am most likely not to return.",

The Pizza Carbonara is fantastic. The egg on the pizza is awesome, and I would give this pizza a 4.5. My only problem is that the pancetta can be a bit salty and sometimes overpower the pizza.  Finally, the Settebello pizza. It was actually the last one I tried because I am not generally a fan of sausages. Yet theses sausages were nothing like the overpowering sausages that overpower most pizzas. This was pure, fresh, sausage perfection, and this pizza was absolutely legendary. A 5 star pizza, the best pie I've ever had.  NOTE- Unless you are absolutely starving, I am not sure you can eat a pizza and get dessert. I have tried and failed twice, so maybe split a pizza then go for the epic-sounding desserts.",

I almost always order the same thing every time that I come here. There Arugula salad is so delicious! Not sure where they source there Arugula but I can eat there salad with just fresh lemon and cracked pepper on it and the flavor is so intensely delicious.  For the main event I order a pizza ,no cheese with extra crisp cooked crust with marinara , garlic, mushrooms, pine nuts, olives, roasted peppers and artichokes and then I finish it with fresh arugula. What can I say...When the Arugula is great you put it on everything. The crust is nice and thin and they use a wood fire to cook the pizza.  The Menu is tight but in my opinion they have perfected what they do best. They serve beer and wine and they also do a daily happy hour.  They have a great kids meal that consists of a pizza, drink and homemade gelatin for under 6 dollars!   This is an other one of those places that is so good that we travel almost 23 miles from the other side of town to eat here.  If you love a delicious  thin crust then this is your place.",

The pine nuts add a little crunch which you don't come across too often on pizzas but is a great addition.  We also had the Diavolo which is also nice! The peppered salami is under the cheese and has a small kick that surprises you when you bite into it a piece of pizza. The fresh basil and peppers are a lovely addition.  We still prefer the Settebello pizza. The restaurant gets 4 stars only because it teeters between being too pretentious and not and when we visit we don't know which side we will walk into.",

    "text": "I came here for LJ (UYE) with bunch of other yelpers. Literally took up two big tables eight. They did great job of taking everyones order and really for the most part getting everyone orders right. When it comes too big parties its usually more hassle but the staff there really on point. I know never saw anyone on our table with empty glass of soda or what not. Before I even had chance too finish had a server come up ask me if need another drink. Yelpers do we literally was the last ones too shut the place down but the staff never pushed us out. Yet again another start for service and just handling big party.   I have been here once before but it been while so looking forward too the pizza and the company. The thing about this style is traditional not suppose too cut the pizza (although if you want they WILL cut it up for you). It can make for interesting eating not only using fork and knife action. Also the fact that its thin crust pizza and depending on the pizza order can be even more tricky. Think of it as part of the fun! I order the Stellebello. I enjoyed. I like the combination of pine nuts, sausage, sauce, and just the right amount of cheese. The crust was good. The pizza cooked in cold brick oven so its not your traditional crust crispy but more on the soft side. So if thinking getting crusty crust you will be disappointed. It decent size pie so warning lay off the bread. Lol! Or else going have hard time finishing off the pie.  I am fan of Stellebello! Just that since its in Henderson would much rather go with my favorite closer too home. Sure if in the area someplace would stop by get my pie on.   Mahalos too LJ for setting up the UYE. As always great time meeting new yelpers never meet before and seeing friends again. Till the next UYE.",

Friendly and knowledgeable service in addition- if you are unsure what to order I'd recommend asking the wait staff for suggestions.

    "text": "Next time you are in Vegas, save yo' lovely selves the burn & hustle of \"The Strip\" & abscond to sleepy Henderson. Trust me on this. And then as night falls skip over to Settebello by the Cheesecake Factory near I-215 and North Green Valley Pkwy and treat ya' lovely selves to the most authentic \"pizza magia di Napoli\" South of Area 51. Read up on the company schizzle  @ Settebello.Net, but if you like me, you'll wan' go over there yo'self an' see wha' the hoopla is all about.  Taste of the puddin'.   FACTOID multiplied by HYPE: Since 2005, proprietor Brad Otton & crew have been whippin' up a cross between street magic & edible art from a non-descript corner of a strip mall near an equally non-descript Whole Foods Market.   My fave @ Settebello Pizzeria Napoletana is the Vico pizza with \"Wood Oven Sausage, Sauteed Fennel, Red Onions, Mascarpone, Mozzarella, Basil, Extra Virgin Olive Oil\". Goodness for days ..... the kind that will stand a little refrigeration and microwaving the mornin' after. Serious yummy-yums right here if y'alls allow me to wax \"neologistical\"!  My only fear is that the owners may fail to bottle \"the magia\" when they finally decide to franchise & spread out. Hear they have set up second shop in Mitt Romney's backyard (Utah). Not sure if I'm gonna venture that far but its certainly worthy of a note to self.  Max-man representin' H-City here while quackin' in me boots. Reason? I'm \"afeared\" Henderson will be swallowed hide & hoof, as Vegas or its ethos rather, spreads out like a canker sore from The Strip, from foothill to foothill: the same Vegas that like money is founded upon a skim, no, actually make that a scam.  No?  Monsieur Max, digressing in characteristic facon.  Bonne journee.",

    "text": "We had been out shopping all day and turned to you my fellow yelpers to guide us to a delicious meal for a reasonable price and you did not disappoint, so thank you!  We arrived and was quickly seated in a booth in Cory's section. He was personable, knowledgeable, and eager to accommodate at will. We ordered the Insalata Grande to share with the Pine Nuts on the side. Cory had the chef separate the salad into 2 portions and it was ooh so yummy. The shavings of fresh parmigiano was wonderful and the balsamic reduction was a perfect blend to cover but not saturate the leafy greens... so good my friends!  Alright the pizza... we ordered the Stellebono and of course modified it to accommodate my dislike for pine nuts and pancetta even though I am full Sicilian, I preferd to substitute artichokes and fresh garlic on my side. The oven cooks at a 1000 degree temp so if your pizza comes out a little more done or blackish in color than you prefer they are happy to remake it. We opted to just eat ours and it was delicious and a little juicy (from the toppings I assume.) WARNING: this is NOT your average pie. It is more of a gourmet pizza, so If you're looking for East Coast style pie this is not it.  We are good eaters and a single pizza and salad was enough to satisfy both of us comfortably.  When we come to Vegas we will stop back in for a more casual meal in a beautiful atmosphere at a decent price.",

I forgot the name but I came in for their one of their lunch specials which was a specialty 8 inch pizza [as opposed to 12in on their regular menu] for $9. You can add on a salad too for an extra $4. The pizza I chose had artichoke, mushrooms, and prosciutto. Super clean taste, just wish the pizza dough underneath was more crisp cuz my pizza ended up being soggy. The waitress is friendly but the hostess that day just looked like she hated her life which is a turn off since they're the first people you see when you walk in. Pizza here is a bit on the pricey side for the portion and toppings you get but hey it's probably because of the location and quality of ingredients they use.",

It's a cookie cutter commercial building with plain written all over the facade and a boring font \"Settebello\" sign overhead.  Inside aged brick walls, wood trims, iron art accents and exposed copper vents added to a slightly more inviting and warm ambiance.  Our server was very personable and attentive.  We split an Insalada Grande and shared a Settebello pizza.  The salad was brought out already split and was the perfect size; mixed greens, tomato, artichoke, mushrooms, olives, pine nuts and large shavings of Parmigiano Reggiano tossed in a flavorful vinaigrette.  The pizza came out not long after we finished our salad.  It looked amazing covered in tomatoes, pancetta, sausage, mushrooms, pine nuts, basil and fresh mozzarella.  I love, love, love the crust on a neapolitan pizza.  And this one was amazing; soft and chewy with a little bit of amazing grilled char on the bottom.  Everything we had that little extra gourmet flare to it that I've come to expect with a neapolitan style pizzeria.",

The capricciosa was also baked to perfection , the artichokes and prosciutto were just right to give it flavor . Only thing negative I noticed this time around was the panacotta, it was delish but the presentation was slacking. Ordered the traditional one with strawberries and noticed it was sloppily made. As you can see on my photos the the dessert looked much prettier my last trip. Our server Ryan was pleasant and he brought our food quickly and refilled our drinks without us even asking.

Miss Molly T. and I got our lunch on couple of weeks ago, and both of us were extremely pleased with the drool-worthy pizza.   We decided to split the namesake Settebello Pizza which had crushed tomatoes, pancetta, wood oven sausage, roasted mushrooms, toasted pine nuts, mozzarella, basil, and extra virgin olive oil ($13.50). The toppings were fresh with quality ingredients and the crust was cooked perfectly, but it is definitely a soft pie like crust. I found it easiest to just fold the slice and eat it that way instead of trying to have the soft crust hold the weight of all the toppings. It was very very tasty. They also have a selection of Italian beers and pasta.  The service was attentive enough and the pizza did take a little while to come out. No they do not deliver.",

Service was fast and attentive - drink refills always appeared just a few minutes BEFORE glasses ran empty - and the food came out quickly, fresh and hot.  Napoli pizza is rather different than the American version, so comparing the two is a little like comparing apples and oranges. I'd eaten pizza a few times in Italy, and new what to expect.  And I was not disappointed. The ingredients - prosciutto, spinach, cheeses - were all fresh and delicious.   Ryan, and then later the busboy, made some recommendations - such as dipping the pizza in a balsamic reduction - that impressed us greatly.    Price for two, was just under $50.  On the whole, we were very impressed.  We will recommend this restaurant to friends and almost certainly visit again.",

But I am -- and it's worth it. During the week staying nearby, I came here twice and was wowed every time. I first chose the proscuitto and romaine lettuce pizza, and it was perfectly crisp with the right combination of ingredients without being messy or too greasy. The second night I chose the white pizza with fennel sausage, and it honestly beat the Susan Finiger's fennel sausage pizza at Mozza. The gelato here - especially the peanut butter gelato -- is not to be missed. The best cup of coffee I've had outside of Europe. If you are in Vegas, Henderson or at Green Valley, this is a must.",

If you are looking for a deep dish crap most people call pizza, move right along. Fresh ingredients, nice sauce without spices (as it should be), fresh cheese, slightly burnt sides....just awesome. Like going to Italy without needing a passport. Best cappuccino in town (depending on who makes it tho), the tiramisu will get you tipsy, and the hazelnut gelato is great!",

    "text": "The fondest memories I have studying in Italy: drinking espresso at Bar Rosso in Campo Santa Margherita, and smoking cheap cigarettes with friends all day long, and eating a ton of food.... I literally stuffed my face with so much Italian (food) that I should have come back 300lbs heavier, which since walking was the main transportation method in Venice, I managed to lose weight (best fricking deal ever)!!! It was, to say, a most wonderful experience....  Since then, I've quit smoking (lozenges are the way to go), but still guzzle down the caffeine...And having Pizza in Italy was another out- of-this-world experience; having an individual-size, thinly crusted pizza, eating with a knife and fork with the freshest ingredients,  you couldn't ask for anything more satisfying than even the simplest of them all: the Margherita.  With just three ingredients-Basil, Tomato Sauce and Mozzarella, it is the purist and most difficult of flavorful pizzas to achieve. Click below to read more...  And Settebello brings me back to those fond memories, it captures the essence of Italian cooking with fresh and raw ingredients to create their Pizzas.  They are licensed by the VPN (Vera Pizza Napoletana) an organization created in the 80's to preserve, promote and educate the traditional art of Napolitan Pizza making. The VPN Charter provides strict guidelines and requirements to protect the integrity of this culinary discipline, which is why Settebello's pizza catapults me back to Italy and it's wonderful, rich style of humble yet elegant cuisine.  Primarily a pizza restaurant, Settebello does provide some appetizers which is comprised mostly of breads, salads and cured meats.  All of these are absolutely delicious and I recommend ordering one in each category if you're hungry.  Our personal favorite is the Involtini di Prosciutto: Prosciutto wrapped around Arugula and Goat Cheese with shaved Parmigiano-Reggiano, Balsamic Reduction and ExtraVirgin Olive Oil on top.  This is an incredibly satisfying and evolved dish, it combines a salad quotient with a cured meat app that is developed and sophisticated: the peppery bitter greens with the creaminess of goat cheese and the buttery Prosciutto Crudo is just symphonic, add the sweet/tart Balsamic and fruity Olive Oil and it sends me over the top........  Moving on: we have two Pizzas that are our favorite, (and pretty much the only two worth getting): the Settebello and the Diavola.  Due to our new harm reduction policies, we can only order one pizza to split, but still order a dessert.  May not be conducive to food blogging, but it is what it is, (look to future posts for updates on other dishes).  The utmost favorite is the Settebello: with Fennel Sausage, Roasted Mushrooms, Toasted Pine Nuts, Mozarella, Basil and Crushed Tomatoes with a drizzle of Olive Oil, this is the supreme Pizza of the Napolitan set...  We thoroughly enjoy eating this pizza, with all the topping working so well with each other, (sometimes I like to add some Pepperoncino and a little more Olive Oil to enhance the flavor) and it's balanced well with the toppings to crust/bread ratio, so you get your carb cravings sated simultaneously...  At last, for dessert, there's quite a selection at Settebello, but our two favorites are: the house made Cannoli and Tiramisu. This time, we ordered the Tiramisu, a creamy and decadent dessert with Marscapone Cream, Lady Fingers soaked in Espresso and Disaronno and powdered chocolate on top.  The serving size, in my mind, too small (a cake pan is more my size)!  It's a great dessert, totally authentic and hits the spot after a great meal.  Settebello is the best Pizza Place in Las Vegas, definitely a must if you enjoy an elevated dining experience with good authentic Italian food!

Our server Whitnee was very pleasant. Also she was very happy to help with recommendations and made sure everything tasted good. We started with the Insalata Grande. Very fresh ingredients, you know immediately when you taste it. Very light in dressing, which kept it light and balanced; you can taste the raw ingredients. We got three pizzas. All were very good. I had the Diavola, good I'm taste and quality. I was warned of the spicy meat on it and it was spicy! But it was pretty good. Only bad thing of my experience was I had to ask to have another water after completely drinking mine. Tiramisu for dessert, very well done. I shall return!",

    "text": "My girlfriend and I were directed here by her Italian professor. Having lived most of her life in Italy, she said that Settebello offers the most authentic Italian cuisine in Henderson and Las Vegas. I am sure a few establishments on the Boulevard would protest, but based on flavor alone, I would have to agree. I grew up visiting the Italian restaurants along Federal Hill in Providence, and unless you are in New York, you probably cannot find more authentic Italian dishes in America.  Unlike those opulent Italian eateries of my youth, Settebello is simple. Tasteful country, dark wood tables in an upscale, modern open dinning area match the menu's simplicity - pizza, appetizers (antipasto and salad), and dessert. In a way this reminds me of classic American diners, where In-N-Out draws its inspiration from. A few dedicated items, carefully prepared, creates a tastier, and in this case more authentic dish.  Any pizzaria west of the Mississippi is traditionally met with skepticism, but Settebello returns me home to the streets of Federal hill, thin crust, warm, authentic mozzarella, and refreshing tomato sauce.  When visiting Settebello you will feel at home in casual attire or business casual dress. The service is prompt, and for an open dinning area, the atmosphere is surprisingly quiet. My girlfriend and I were on our way to a film, and the pacing was perfectly comfortable as well as timely.",
