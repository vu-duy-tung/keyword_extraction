    "text": "Chinese food for the affluent located at none other than the world famous Bellagio Resort and Casino.  Normally I wouldn't give a place like this a second thought with its suggested dress code and prices five times the norm, but when Lady Luck intervened I suddenly felt an urge to splurge.  The place is downright formal in its mannerisms.  When I entered the restaurant and inquired about getting a table the hostess greeted me and asked for my last name.  I was asked to take a seat at a small reception area opposite the bar while my table was being prepared.  I found the experience quite interesting because from the moment the hostess wrote down my last name every staff person addressed me as Mr. Y.  The server, the waitress, a floor supervisor ... everybody addressed me as Mr. Y as if they had written my last name somewhere near my table for all to see.  Once inside the fancy dining room with its gigantic crystal chandeliers hanging down I was seated at a small table with a clear view looking out the huge glass windows where three times during my meal the fabulous fountains of the Bellagio performed their artistic magic.  There I was enjoying this amazing spectacle from a most unique vantage point behind the fountains.  At Jasmine they pull your chair out when you go to sit down, they help to push your chair in once you are seated, they unfold your thick fabric napkin for you and they gently place it on your lap.  I was often taught those steps to be used for a special lady, but I never imagined having a lady do those things for me.  Jasmine certainly has its service perfected, but how is their food?  I didn't select any extravagant selection here.  In fact, my selections were downright homey.  I'm pretty certain this type of restaurant can handle the fancy dishes well, but I was curious how well they could punctuate the more traditional dishes I might have at home.  Three Soup Tasting (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ZpMoI5EECS6Rm7KigN1gPg?select=CZ10iE9MQfGLqpLkyda3LQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/ZpMo...</a>) is a sampler of three popular soups, braised shark fin, chicken corn chowder and won ton soup.  Since I had run a long race that morning I wanted something soothing, and for me that usually means hot soup.  The shark fin soup had lots of strands of crunchy, chewy shark fin in a slightly thickened soup.  The soup lacked meat though.  Most restaurants will serve this either with shards of chicken breast or pieces of Virginia ham.  Jasmine didn't.  Keeping in mind that this was only a sampler there was exactly one wonton in a perfectly seasoned broth.  The wonton was plump with lean pork and a large chunk of shrimp.  I would have liked more.  Egg whites, corn kernels, corn starch and chicken breast bits made up the very standard chicken corn chowder.  Pineapple Fried Rice was served in a boat-like glass dish lined with a single lotus leaf.  The first bowl was served to me (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ZpMoI5EECS6Rm7KigN1gPg?select=D2-2SonYOPnRw0FUCJ32EA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/ZpMo...</a>), and I must have refilled my bowl three times in finishing the dish which combined white rice, egg yolks, shrimp, scallops and fresh grilled pineapple.  Ma Po Tofu (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ZpMoI5EECS6Rm7KigN1gPg?select=ulN8otZyPI6LQQgH69REeQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/ZpMo...</a>) was made with the silky tofu instead of the medium firm tofu I'm used to with this dish.  I had no problem with that though as the dish was very good.  It was mildly spicy just like the waitress suggested.  You can choose from five or six different green leafy vegetables for your Daily Greens side dish.  You can even suggest how you would like it to be prepared.  I chose the Choy Sum (young tender greens) and asked that it be sauteed.  The vegetables (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ZpMoI5EECS6Rm7KigN1gPg?select=asVdBSNxFrPL8VSwyZ7j5g\">yelp.com/biz_photos/ZpMo...</a>) were cooked perfectly with a nice shade of green.  I enjoyed this simple dish very much.  The food is a good 3.5 stars and the service is definitely a 5.  This meal left me nice and full, and the restaurant is a convenient two minute walk along the casino floor to the Cirque du Soleil's \"O\" Theatre.",

    "text": "When it comes to getting a waterfront view in the desert, Jasmine's is about as close as you get (overlooking the Bellagio Fountains). The only other dining views I have enjoyed more were from Anthony's Pier 4 in Boston and the 360 at the CN Tower in Toronto.   I eat here about once a year and each time I get the Taste of Jasmine full course meal. I have always thoroughly enjoyed the experience in terms of atmosphere, view and service.   The food is also very good with a great attention to detail and featuring quality ingredients.   I personally feel the portions are ideal and always leave very satiated.   My typical bill is in the 280 range (before tip) for 2 people including some very good wine which is really not bad given the total experience.   Whenever someone asks me for a great place to take a date for dinner, Jasmine is at the top of my list.",

The concierge recommended Jasmine restaurant in the Bellagio Hotel and we loved it. It is a great mixture of Asian (Chinese/Japanese) and traditional food in a buffet style. Sushi, dim sum, crab legs, shrimp, oysters, waffles, poke, prime rib, Japanese noodle soup (to order), egg bar, egg Benedict, lobster pop pie, etc. were all very fresh and tasty plus a whole lot more that we didn't try. Huge selection of deserts. The decor and the view (Bellagio water fountains) and service was very good. It's a bit pricy but good value for what you get and can eat. Make reservations and come hungry!",

I barely finished half of it before I was done. My wife ordered the veggie spring rolls, were not good as well :-/  The dim sum was actually ok, but that's just a starter dish and not what you come here from. The service was pleasant so it does deserve a 2 star, but don't go out of your way to eat here, there are much better places to eat at!",

    "text": "Sometimes, I take my chances even though my fellow yelpers warn me otherwise. Or there's those rare occasions when every restaurant near by has a line around the corner and is extremely overpriced due to a national holiday like Easter evening. Yesterday @ Bellagio resort, we were starving and was willing to go with the restaurant that had the least wait time to get a table. To my dismay the staff at Sensi was booked for another hour and Eiffel tower was too. The staff at Sensi suggested Jasmine to meet our craving for fresh seafood.   Although there was a wait it was nothing in comparison to the others. I didn't think to Yelp until we were seated, in the corner on the far left damn near hiding behind a curtain.  We say 5 feet from severe the waiters enter your order. I'm not sure if an unreserved table for two had to sit on the side away from all the center open tables we saw available, but that should have been que. Starving, we decided to stay seated.  Refills - Charge  I've never experienced a fine dining that's simply an overpriced Chinese restaurant. Refills for small glass of lemonade (didn't seem fresh squeezed) was $6.00. I didn't know this until the waiter refilled my daughter's glass but put 2 straws this time. Why wouldn't they mention extra charge for another glass?   Entrees- Al a Carte (Per the waiter) - Lemon Chicken - $30 Dry, we attempted to drown it in the sauce provided to assist with chewing. - Seafood Rice - $30! Just ok, nothing to write home about nor take a picture. The rice seemed a bit old, my daughter said we could have had better at our Chinese buffet near home for $10 less.  - Sides, oh there were none unless we count the leaf and 2 pieces of bok choy for garnish. I was offered the option to purchase steamed rice.   Our bill ~$80 Here's the kicker...As a new M Life member, I was excited to show my card and get my points. I show the waiter, he tells me it's linked to my room. I ask how can that be when I joined after I checked in. He says I'll check, turns back around (remember were directly in front of the register), he lies and says yes it's showing on your room. Now I know Vegas offers a lot of wow, but knowing my hotel when I didn't inform anybody I was at Vdara blew me away. Then I get to my hotel, front desk says no I they're not linked.   The ONLY reason I give this 3 is the decor and the guy who poured water.  Not worth it, save your money or go for an overpriced appetizer just to see the fountains. Better yet, go to Eiffel Tower instead.",

    "text": "I was so disappointed in Jasmine. My daughter and I were in Vegas for her birthday on 6/18 and after much debate she chose Jasmine out of the many excellent restaurants on the strip. We made reservations for 8:00 asking for a view of the fountain. When we got there they didn't have our table ready but it was a short wait. We ordered dim sum as a starter. While we were waiting a spider ran onto our table! Really? The busboy came over and just looked at us like what do you mean - we showed him the spider ON THE TABLE and he just kind of laughed. My daughter brushed it onto the floor ... and we continued with dinner with no reaction from the staff at all. So - the dim sum ...it was pretty good but nothing special.   We then ordered the braised spare ribs and braised efu noodles for the main course.   The short ribs were tender but the seasoning / sauce tasted overpoweringly of 5-spice powder and nothing else. The noodles were  glutinous and had very little taste. It was no better than fast food just served in an upscale environment with the very high prices to match. If possible the service was even worse. We sat for over 20 minutes without anyone asking us if we'd like another drink or any water. We sat for at least that long again waiting for someone to clear our plates and bring a check. The busboy looked like he'd rather be anywhere but at work and our server was very nice but clearly overworked. Even the hostess was very stressed when we got there.   The restaurant is beautiful and the view of the fountain was amazing. Too bad the food and service were the worse I have experienced in a long time. Since I only get to see my daughter a couple of times a year it was doubly disappointing.   The one high note of the evening were the cocktails. I had the watermelon mojito and my daughter had the special drink - don't remember what it was called but it had great blueberry flavor.  Oh...I complained about the wait but even terrible service and the spider didn't get us anything comped - not even the offer of a free drink. I guess their exorbitant prices and cheap quality food provides enough of a profit that the owners don't believe in treating their guests well.",

Tantalize your tastebuds with their omelets, prime rib, lamb, meet and cheese selections, or (my personal favorite) the duck!

Oh, and did I mention you get a prime view of the Bellagio Fountains that entertain you every 15 minutes?  Priceless!  If you're looking for the best Sunday Bruch in Vegas, look no farther than Jasmine's. It's a \"must experience\" at least once.

    "text": "I have a lot of traditions for trips to Vegas. As soon as I arrive, I like to eat at X restaurant, see Y show, place Z bet... not really for luck, but just because I like traditions.  For the first time in a while, I have added a new tradition: Fountains Brunch at Jasmine.   I don't understand why anyone would eat at a Vegas buffet, including the Bellagio's, when this exists. Maybe it's because I already have a penchant for dim sum and other authentic Chinese dishes, but the selection was so much better than... well any other buffet, ever.  The ambiance for me was not that awesome, honestly - much like other parts of the B, it needs some TLC. To be fair, we had a table in a super weird spot, but I think that happened because we used VIP services to sneak in an extreme last-minute reservation (which is actually amazing that they could make that happen, so good on them).  I tripped over the table skirts once and saw other people do it multiple times. I wonder how often people go flying with plates of food in their hands.   But I digress- the food was pretty good. I can't argue with all-you-can-eat siu mai and charsiew bao, ever, and the Bellagio actually makes pretty good siu mai.   The western breakfast selections were not as good as they sounded (red velvet waffle? ehhh), but that's not what I was there for, so whatever. The important thing is that the experience was so good that we decided it ranked high enough to be a new tradition. There were so many things, like the make-your-own soup station, that I didn't even get to try.   Next time I'll surely reserve a table ahead of time and actually get the full experience.",

How do you have Chinese food without rice?!  The rice is a la cart and for a very tiny bowl of white steamed rice, it is $5!  Each dish is $30-$50 - for Chinese food & no rice!  Then at least if you are going to charge that much for a dish, it should be a lot of food.  When our dishes came out, there was not very much food on the dish. However, I did order noodles which had an ok amount, but they were almost tasteless!  The wait staff was very good though & attentive. The food was just terrible & severely, severely overpriced!  $30 for plain, tasteless, dry noodles with 3 pieces of shrimp. I'm a little bitter I guess.  But if you want bad food with a nice view & good service, then this is your place.",

    "text": "For the most part Jasmine is about what I expected - a nice ambience, romantic type dining establishment with very good service but too high a price tag for the food you get.  My review is for dinner a la carte, not the Fountains buffet.  Let's go through the good, the bad and the indifferent.    The good - the service, presentation and ambience are all good.  It's nice to sit with a view of the fountains and to eat on fine china with non-disposable chopsticks.  The lychee caipirhina (sp?) was very good, tasting more like lychee and less like paipirhina, with a little kick but not too strong for me.    The general's chicken is advertised as spicy but isn't really, it's like sweet & sour with kick.  It tasted pretty good and the portion was about the right size for one person.  The walnut prawns had some good and some indifferent - the prawns themselves were very good - eight very large, perfectly cooked prawns.  The sauce though was disappointing.  I've had this dish before and it is usually a bit sweet, with a vanilla cream type sauce.  This one was mayo.  I'm not sure it was anything else besides mayo.  It could have been worse - it could have come with fruit cocktail.  The sauce wasn't 'bad' but it wasn't 'good' either.    More indifferent - My honey was planning on ordering a raspberry beignet type dessert but the waiter told him he should get one of three other desserts instead because 'those were the best'.  (They were all the same price).  So, he picked the white chocolate lychee cake which I had mentioned sounds pretty good.  It was ok, but not all that exciting.  The presentation was lovely though, I will give you that.  Honestly I am not unconvinced that the waiter wasn't just trying to sound like he was looking out for us by suggesting a different dessert, but I'll give him the benefit of the doubt.    The bad - the appetizer prices are just plain ridiculous, even by high-priced establishment standards.  The trio of dumplings is $18 for three dumplings, sized very small, small and average.  It's not easy to share the two smaller dumplings because there just isn't that much to cut in half.  They all tasted good though.  The scallop appetizer though was even more insane, two quite small scallops with a sandy textured scraping of sauce on top that didn't really taste that great, served with a smattering of small mushrooms - for $17.  It should have been advertised as a mushroom appetizer with a couple small scallops on the side.  At least my honey likes mushrooms - I do not.  So we each got one small scallop and he got some mushrooms.  A huge disappointment on this one.  Our local sushi place makes a volcano roll for $13 that is covered with over a dozen scallops bigger than the two on this plate.  Yeah, I know our local sushi place isn't in the Bellagio but still... not good.  Overall - I don't mind an expensive meal now and then, especially not in Vegas.  (We spent $200 and $150 on two nights in a row at Mesa Grill the two nights before we came to Jasmine).  But, I don't really feel that our money was as well spent at Jasmine, at least not as far as the food itself goes.  It's not bad per se but if you're going for a very pricey meal you want it to be good enough that you're not even thinking about how much you're spending on it and Jasmine doesn't really measure up there.",

The view was wonderful as well    The one thing that I was really looking forward to was the King crab legs but I was sort of disappointed with what they were putting out as they were straggly looking legs.  Just looking through the pictures people had taken I was expecting a grand display of seafood but really it was sort of small. Somethings that really ticked me off was that when I made reservations I had asked about champagne being included but it is not (cost $$$) and they had a dress code.  I don't think the dress code really applied as I saw people in shorts eating there as well.",

I started with the chicken corn chowder and followed it up with the wok fried flank steak - wow, was that tasty and no wonder it is a signature dish!  The beef was melt in your mouth delicious with just the right amount of flavor.  I highly recommend this elegant dining experience with great ambiance.",

The menu looked great and we were very excited to try their food.   Considering the prices we were disappointed in our experience.    Service was slow but friendly - luckily we weren't in a rush.  We were going to share a duck appetizer but it never came.   Our server was apologetic but since we already had our entrees in front of us we declined to have our appetizer come out after our main course.  My wife had a short rib noodle dish with mushrooms that was cooked well but lacked any seasoning at all - shockingly bland.  I had the generals chicken. It was good but not great and should have come with some type of vegetable but it was just white meat chicken in a big bowl.  I've had better at a third of the price at regular family Chinese restaurants. We had a side of eggplant which was awesome - definitely order it if you go there.  Because our food was so bland we asked for some hot sauce and theirs tasted homemade and really helped to liven up our dishes.  I had a watermelon mojito which was tasty but barely had any alcohol.  I almost sent it back because I couldn't taste the rum but decided to just not order anymore drinks from them.  You can do a lot better than this place in Vegas.",

Had a few overpriced drinks and ordered the chefs special with a couple courses and the wine accompaniment. Sun was shining off one of the hotels right where we sat, was so bright we actually had to rearrange seating so we didn't get blinded. Asked our server about lowering the curtains. He asked another older gentleman there who very loudly said he would not ruin other peoples view (we were one of only 4 groups there none of which were sitting by this side of the room and there was no view but the blindlingly bright golden hotel across the street). He flat out refused. Was kind of comical. Server came back embarrassed and said he would see what he could do with someone higher up and inferred there was some sort of drama going on there. Told him it was cool and we would just scoot over for now. Had we not been drinking and in a really good mood this could have turned into worse experience. Food was ok. Not worth the small fortune we paid. Too many restaurants on the Strip to have to deal with that kind of service. Has been awhile since we've been here so maybe things are better managed now. Personally wouldn't bother going back.",

The contrast with our other big Vegas dinner (at Gagnaire) could not be starker: at Jasmine the dishes were either deliciously simple (the duck) or combined in an unexpectedly rich and successful way (cod and short rib.) Way too much food, though, so keep that in mind when you are eating earlier in the day. The missing star is for service: it was pleasant, but we must have had literally 7 or 8 different wait-staff, some duplication, general disorganization, etc. It did not affect the quality of the food, but it did make for a slightly hectic atmosphere.",

I had the crispy chicken which had very thin, very crispy breading; it was a nice clean dish.  Had a nice dessert, too, the warm chocolate truffles with cinnamon ice cream. It's an expensive restaurant, but it's something special, so if you are in Vegas for good food, go to Jasmin. One nice thing is the food is delicious but the menu is not full of obscure items like a lot of the fine dining establishments that just try too hard to put weird stuff on the menu.",

Each dish on the buffet line was a feature and there were no filler dishes at all. Everything was delicious and of high quality. We were able to taste items that are not usually on a buffet line and are normally available at a fine dining meal - from amuse-bouche of foie gras to kobe beef carpaccio. The presentation of some of the dishes had wow factor (amuse bouche spoons suspended on a wall). Service was impeccable and our endless glass of champagne was TRULY endless as the server kept topping off the glasses every time we looked away. The entire staff was friendly and very attentive And of course, it was all located in the gorgeous dining room of the Jasmine. The giant windows afforded us a VIP view of every fountain show with the music piped into the dining area. All in all, it was the best food and experience we have had through a buffet in Vegas.",

    "text": "A delightful and elegant Chinese restaurant located adjacent to the lagoon in front of the Bellagio.  Having been to China, I can attest to the authenticity of the decor.  The restaurant also features floor-to-ceiling windows, offering an unmatched view of the fountains.  The service was extremely attentive but unintrusive, as I've come to expect from the Bellagio.  Now, for the food.  We ordered a wide array of dishes, as there were 10 of us.  The lemon chicken stood out more than anything else, as did the sweet and sour pork.  Both were among the best I've ever had, artistically presented, and not at all heavy (none of the food was greasy or heavy, which Americanized Chinese cuisine generally is).  Some other highlights were the Mongolian beef (spicy and tender), and the Creme Brulee, which was presented in one of the most creative ways I've ever seen.  If you're going to have one nice meal in Vegas, I'd skip Jasmine, because you can find delicious and authentic Chinese food in most major cities, but if you're a diehard fan of this cuisine and want an elegant alternative to more traditional fare, give Jasmine a try.",

    "text": "Chinese is my least favorite of all non-American foods and I'm giving this restaurant 5 stars. Everything was fabulous. Food. Atmosphere. Service. Selection. Jasmine also saved my first wedding anniversary dinner... but I'll get to that.  Literally \"white glove\" service. The menu had an excellent range of options. You could get duck for $70 or less fancy entrees for $19. We liked having a range of prices to choose from. My husband got an eggplant dish that was the best he'd ever had, and I got the General chicken--not very adventurous I know--but delicious with huge pieces of all white meat chicken. We each got an appetizer (under $10ea.) and a fancy cocktail from their signature menu ($14ea.). We split a dessert. Total was $120 not including tip. Expensive, but reasonable considering what we got. Portions were average--meaning not small--but we were just almost able to finish all our bites. Presentation was nice. Seats were plush and comfy with plenty of space between your neighbor, so you weren't sitting on top of each others' conversations. I thought we'd just be paying for the location and the view (famous fountain show)...but the food really was great. If they relocated to a windowless corner of the hotel, we'd still go back.  So our story...visiting Las Vegas from Boston for the first time during the week, we were surprised how many places closed early since we weren't on weekend prime-time. We were caught off-guard more than once realizing at 9 or 10pm we needed dinner and found many places closed or switching to the late bar menus. We also didn't plan well with reservations because with literally hundreds of places to choose from we figured it wouldn't be an issue. So we wander around the Bellagio, tired, getting really hungry, post-show, and realize it's 9:50pm and we're desperate to find a nice place to celebrate our 1st wedding anniversary before we leave Vegas. We view a bunch of menus, but not really in the mood to shell out $50 min. for entrees when weren't craving anything particular. Our last stop before giving up and hitting the fast food noodle place was Jasmine. The friendly hostess says they're open for another 10 minutes and would be happy to seat us. I figure we'll get a crappy seat by the kitchen and they'll be rushed to get us out. We had the opposite experience. We got a great seat with a view of the fountain, romantic elegant atmosphere, no rushing, and by the end, we had the place to ourselves. Lovely and special.",

The food was good, but it didn't blow my mind. They had a good variety of food. They offered an omelet station, hot soup noodle bar, oysters (they were really good!!!) lobster egg benedict, bacon, dim sum, tuna tartare, sushi, everyone gets one piece of Peking duck (one of the best items), hand rolled chocolate truffles, choc fondu, yummy mango sorbet. Well you get the point. There were some really good eats, but most of them were okay for the price. You're really paying for the ambience, when you dine here.

    "text": "Had a solid dinner on a Saturday at Jasmine.  We were eating early, as we were watching the Mayweather/Pacquiao fight (May 2, 2015) that evening.  We arrived at 6 and were taken immediately to our table.  Jasmine has a good sized dining room, but it's not cavernous.  There are some great views of the Bellagio fountains, and some not so great.  We had a not so great view.  But, the people I was dining with were either Vegas residents or had stayed at Bellagio multiple times.  So, not seeing the fountains wasn't a big deal to us.  We spoke with the sommelier first.  As we were getting many dishes with varying ingredients, textures, and flavors, she advised us to just order what we like regarding wine.  No problem there.  She was readily available for refills or additional orders throughout our evening.  To start, we went with the dim sum basket trio, duck trilogy, lobster two ways and scallops.  Our server informed us that each appetizer is meant to serve one person.  For example, the dim sum basket trio has 3 dumplings, so that's not really shareable.  So, to solve this issue, we ordered two of everything.  We had to cut a lot of it in half, but it worked.  The duck trilogy was probably the favorite.  It has roasted duck, a cold duck meat salad and decadent pan fried foie gras.  All of this was fantastic, if you had served me 5 orders of this for my meal that would have been just fine with me.  The scallops were good, but they were your basic seared scallop.  I was a little disappointed in the lobster two ways, the lobster was a little tough.  We liked all of the dumplings in the dim sum basket, my personal preference was for the chicken and mushroom.  But, they were all tender and the fillings on all were flavorful.  In between the appetizers and main course, I had the lobster dumpling soup.  This is served with mushrooms, carrots, and asparagus.  This fell flat to me, easily the worst thing I ate all evening.  Probably the worst thing I ate all weekend.  The broth was very watery, the lobster was so light it was hard to detect.  It just didn't work for me.  Another at our table ordered the wonton soup, and he didn't care for it either.  To eat, we shared:  fried lobster, braised kobe short ribs, general chicken, Jasmine fried rice, and wok fried udon noodles.  The lobster was very difficult to eat.  At first I thought I was just an idiot, but everyone at my table had difficulties.  Maybe we're all idiots, I don't know.  That's probably it.  Anyway, it was difficult to get to all of the meat, but what I did try I enjoyed.  My two favorites of the entrees were the short ribs and general chicken.  The braised short ribs were prepared perfectly.  They achieved that tenderness short ribs get when braised correctly where you feel like if you gave them a stern look it would cut them.  No knife needed, and really no fork needed either.  The sauce was thick and flavorful.  Absolute re-order.  The chicken was large and fried very well.  It was juicy and coated with just the right amount of sauce.  These two seemed to be the run away winners of the table.  The noodles were stronger for me than the rice.  The rice lacked seasoning.  Service was excellent, despite all of our dishes and wine, we were out in enough time to make the fight watch party.  There was always someone filling water or wine glasses, at one point, I asked a buddy to pass me the wine.  As he was passing it, a hand came from behind my left shoulder, took the bottle, and filled my glass.  I had no idea the guy was even behind me.  Excellent service.  I am not too experienced with good quality Chinese food, but Jasmine's the best Chinese cuisine I've had.  I'd absolutely return, and if it's your first time, reserve a table near the window.  Makes for a great evening.",

Actually they asked my size, went to the back and quickly came up with a pair in my size and in a dry cleaning bag.     The view from Jasmine of the bellagio fountains is very close to the fountains almost on top of them and really adds to the dinning experience.  Very nice to watch the fountains fill the view of the large windows during dinner.       The meal stared with a free offering of a tofu with mushroom, tasty little gem, its was very good.  Next she had the cream corn, yes cream corn, but it was very asian tasting which was a surprise and very good.  I had the lobster soup which at 18.99 was very pricey, but good.    Dinner she had the pepper steak, which she has had twice and is oh so tender and mmm good.  I had the BBQ Chicken which had a vinegar sauce, I was unsure about the vinegar sauce, but it really tasted good, it has a nice crisp skin.  Over the top of the whole plate was some type of crisp crunchy topping, I couldn't figure out what it was, but it was really good.    So in the end we really liked it, sure we just dropped $150 on Chinese food, but it was the best Chinese food I have ever had, completely different then what you think of Chinese food.  Great view, excellent service and good food, just make sure you wear pants,lol.",

    "text": "Knowing my BF despises buffet style dining yet he's still a big fan of Jasmine, we decided to come here for Jasmine's famous Christmas brunch. I thought I was lucky when I found out Jasmine was offering dim sum buffet brunch from 12/25/14-1/4/15. As it turned out it was nothing short of mediocrity.  Since they did not want to take my reservation, I was a bit worried that I needed to wait in line, but they weren't all that busy to begin with on a Friday noon (12/26/14,) looking back that probably should've been a sign. I have no problem with paying $58 per person as long as they make it worth my while. And as far as the reviews about their lobster served during brunch, I've seen none... They did serve fresh, big, and peeled shrimps as well as crab legs (though not as fresh as the shrimps.) And the oysters were just plain gross. It did not look fresh at all, they looked rather staled.  As for the dim sum? They were just okay, nothing I haven't tasted before (unlike the ones from China Poblano at Cosmopolitan, those were great!!!) Poor dessert selection, only a few items available. I did enjoy the tiramisu cup. And my bf and I were pleasantly surprised on how delicious their crepes turned out, considering Jasmine being a Chinese restaurant.  Other than those points, I have no any recollection whatsoever about my \"special holiday dim sum buffet\" at Jasmine. The servers were very prompt to fill up our cups or clean the plates, but somehow it did not feel personal enough. My BF and I both were trying to talk to the hostess, servers, or even the manger, no one had cracked a smile once... Perhaps the fact I was there with a white guy sitting next to me was too much for them to handle? I guess I'll never find out...  Yes, I'm very well aware Jasmine is situated inside of Bellagio and considered themselves as \"fine dining,\" but that \"we don't take reservation unless it's for party of 8 or more\" is just plain preposterous. Are they not aware not everybody travels in packs? what about couples like us? More importantly, their men's room though designed nicely, but the toilet wasn't even scrubbed down nor clean... there were \"residues\" all around it (Someone definitely had some digestive problems before I got there, gross)...    Overall, if you must have Bellagio fountain view with your dim sum and \"buffet style dessert,\" I'd say give this place a whirl. Just be sure you come with a large party, otherwise they wouldn't even seat you anywhere close to the terrace where you'd truly get to see the fountains...",

We loved all the food--porcetta, caviar bites, lobster eggs Benedict, steamed pork buns, gyoza, shumai, charcuterie, omelet station, crepe station...it's hard to remember all of the items they had!   Additionally, each table has a three-tiered tray with pastries, fruit skewers, and tiny bottles of jam!   The bathrooms feature individual cloth towels to dry your hands on--a nice touch.  The surprising downside? A $58 brunch buffet does not include iced tea or coffee. They charged SIX DOLLARS for iced tea. FIVE DOLLARS for coffee. W.O.W.  WTH Bellagio?   Otherwise, pleased with this buffet and can't wait to come back.",

Where in the hell is 5oz of chicken worth 34 bucks? They try to sell them selves as a high class Chinese restaurant but how can you do this when you don't even include sides and rice, that is how you traditionally eat that dish. In the menu description they say they use General Tso's original recipe but unless they jumped into a time machine and go back to the 1500 bc and resurrect him and bring him back and actually have him cooking this chicken in their kitchen I don't see the value they have it listed for on the menu. Oh and as a complimentary appetizer you get these little pathetic rice cakes that it looks like they blew it with the bubble machine in the back, freezer dried it, and brought it out to you. This is pretty cheap for such a high class restaurant it's equivalent you going to Hells kitchen and them bringing out saltine crackers for you to snack on. I looked around and to my surprise they actually had customers which blew my mind but then I focused in on their clientele and I could tell it was rich privilege people who were trying to impress a dates, bad idea.",

The service was outstanding.  They checked on us and served us like we were royalty.    We only ordered one thing, 2 orders of the Dungeness Crab - Sampan Style, Garlic, Chili, Salt and Pepper.  This was an outstanding dish.  Its very similar to the Sampan Crab at Lemongrass at the Aria.  However, this version is more subtle.  It's not as spicy.  You can taste the delicate crab meet more.  And it is not as salty.  But this is definitely a solid dish!",

Let's just get that off the table -- it was perfectly fine. I will say that every dish we ordered was brought to the table just warmer than lukewarm, but, it was fine.  The restaurant would get more stars for atmosphere. We ONLY chose this place because we -- well, *I* -- was fried from Vegas. Too much noise. Too many lights. Walked by this place and a) tables were available now, and not with a one hour wait, and b) it was relatively quiet. Such a relief on the ears! Now, the quiet is relative to the cacophony of the casino, right? I did suffer a bit of PTS from the constant expectation that the fountain show would start up again and we would have to hear \"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds.\" Again. For like the twentieth time over dinner. (Would hate to be a server here for that reason alone.)  So, why the two stars? The service. Our actual server for the meal was just fine -- unobtrusive and efficient. But unfortunately, the only service I can remember is the sommelier. The man who, when my dinner guest asked \"What do you recommend here?\" responded with, \"I don't know. I never eat here.\" And then, after a meaningful pause, added \"ever.\" He was just kind of an overall dipshit to us throughout, but it was that one line that portended doom for our dining experience, and, is the one thing I will remember about my eating experience at Jasmine.",

For only $58/person, Jasmine serves some of the freshest seafood found in Vegas...the shrimp cocktail is amazing, the oysters are sweet and delicious, and the smoked salmon with creme fraiche and trimmings is memorable enough for me to crave! The condiments for the seafood is classic yet unique. The highlight is definitely the Peking duck, sliced perfectly with just enough sauce and green onion wrapped in a freshly steamed bun.   When we arrived, the beauty of the restaurant takes your breath away. The front desk service was excellent. We had a great table right in front of the expansive windows with a perfect view of the fountains. Our table server was not great...reminds me of servers at Cantonese restaurants in Monterey Park. He barely noticed our table...definitely not the kind of service I expect at a restaurant of this caliber. But the busboy (young Mexican guy) was excellent and on top of things...his outstanding service makes up for the Cantonese waiter!  One thing I found disappointing was that soft drinks, tea, and coffee are all extra...this is brunch...make those inclusive!  The cold dishes were unique as well...foie gras profiteroles were a nice touch, the tuna cone was fantastic, and the cheese and meat platter was delicious (although it looks limited in selection, each cheese and meat was excellent...anymore selections would have taken away from the quality).   Plenty of options and much more than I could eat...I didn't get to everything, but I will try those next time!",

    "text": "Jasmine Sunday Brunch is a refreshing change to the standard humdrum of Vegas Buffets.  The service was excellent.  I only have one gripe - normally fresh squeezed OJ is part of the whole experience, but they charge you extra for it here.  The champagne is also not included, but they give you several pricing options, of which you will get unlimited refills.   Here are some of the highlights: lobster cake eggs benedict fresh seafood on ice - includes oysters, shrimp, king crab legs,  white asparagus panna cotta with watermelon caviar omelette bar carving station that includes thick carved bacon - how great is that! beef tenderloin wrapped inpuff pastry with truffles decadent braised short ribs that melt in your mouth kobe beef carpaccio wrapped around asparagus waffle bar, oatmeal station, select sushi and rolls soup station where you can make your own soup.  The dessert room is worth special mention as they have an ice cream bar and a chocolate fondue station.  Chocolate brownies dipped in dark chocolate fondue?!? I think 34 states have laws against such decadence.  Aside from the food, an added bonus is that you can have a great view in watching the Bellagio water show and accompanying music is piped right into the restaurant.",

Wok vegetable noodles were disguting -- way too salty, undercooked, and very little amount of actual food. The waiter forgot to bring my drink and was impossible to catch afterwards so I got my drink by the end of the meal after asking a different waiter. All of that for $106 total for 3 people.   The only nice thing was an amazing view and beautiful decor. But the food and service were ridiculously disappointing.   Save your money DO NOT GO THERE.",

We made reservations but it seemed like they were not really needed. Appetizers were fried prawns which were crispy and very light, delicious, and the spring rolls, which were pretty good. For main course, we ordered the Seafood fried rice which was really good, the Kung Pao  was decent. They were really good with bringing out a birthday dessert which I had pre called about. The thing that makes this restaurant worth it for me every time is the fact that you can see the Bellagio fountains outside from your seat regardless of where you are seated, which turn on every five minutes, and they are coordinated with the music played in the restaurant. I love it!",

Make sure if you order any cocktail, to ask for a \"double dose\" of whatever alcohol is in it so you don't drink watered down juice. Service was slow and it's just not worth the price. I had much better at PF Changs and the luxury doesn't match the food in this place, unfortunately.",

When the food did arrive the salmon was cold, if we had time we would have sent it back. The manager came to talk to us and comped our meal because of the delay which is why this place gets the 3rd star, the food itself is fairly regular, the salmon was nice, the fried rice and bok choi are nothing you can't get at your neighborhood Chinese restaurant.",

Btw the 2 of us, we've been there 33 times (and we live on the East Coast. =)  When it came time for us to pick a place to have a mini-reception for our friends after we got married, we couldn't think of a more suitable city like Las Vegas.  And nothing says Las Vegas like a buffet! So we searched around and picked the buffet with the best view.  Little did we know that we came for the view but got the best buffet on the Strip - the Jasmine brunch buffet!   All the awesome things: 1) I called a few months before arriving and told the hostess that we were celebrating our nuptials with a few friends and to see if we could get a table by the window.  While they couldn't guarantee this, I showed up that day with the perfect table with a perfect fountain view, right next to the window. 2) The food at the buffet was spectacular.  Even my super-picky friend couldn't stop raving about the bbq beef short ribs, which were soooo tender and tasty.  Then there was the Peking duck, carved table-side.  Talk about wow factor for your guests!  3) I have the biggest sweet tooth out there and the dessert ROOM at the buffet was alone worth the price tag.  4) B/c it was a celebration, my friends brought a bottle of champagne, which the waiter promptly served.  He even gave me a chilled bottle of the same thing, since mine was brand new/room temperature.  How thoughtful!   Overall, my husband and I had a very memorable meal there - food was super tasty, atmosphere was absolutely lovely, service was fantastic.  We are planning on celebrating our 2 year anniversary at Las Vegas again this summer.  Can't wait to hit up Jasmine Brunch buffet again!",

The best being the chillian sea bass which was the best fish I've ever had!!!  I mean, it was amazing, you have to taste it. Also, we got dumplings, fried rice, and pepper beef.  All were great. The service was as good as any prime steak house you can go to. Attentive and friendly.

    "text": "We chose Jasmine for a dinner/show package offered by the Bellagio based upon the Prix Fixe menu displayed on their website. This was a special birthday celebration for my husband with tickets to see Cirque du Soleil \"O\". Online the choices were shrimp salad, citrus chicken, or clam soup for starters and roasted duck eggplant, prime beef tenderloin, spicy prawns, or steamed lobster ($9.88 supplemental) for dinner, with dessert of the day. Sounded great. When we arrived we were given the regular menu which looked nice. Our waiter was friendly and wished my husband a happy birthday. We informed our waiter of our dinner/show package and he brought us the special menu. Instead of what we saw previously, the offerings were as follows: fried eggplant, hot and sour soup, or vegetable spring roll for starters, Kung Pao chicken, braised tofu, or steamed sea bass for dinner, and tapioca or mango pudding for dessert. What???? Bait and swicth!!   We had the fried eggplant, hot and sour soup, braised tofu, sea bass, and the two puddings. We were refused a substitution of ice cream mochi for dessert. (Funny that Japanese dessert was even on the menu...) With the exception of the sea bass, everything else was marginal at best and I could have gotten them at my local Chinese takeout in Massachusetts. I'm Asian and I know great Asian cuisine... This was not it. For a $50 dinner voucher per person my husband and I felt cheated and tricked.   I also felt that after or waiter learned of our dinner package status the service and attitude changed. This was after we already ordered $50 worth of cocktails and bottled water!  We did a similar dinner show package for the Beatles Love and Heritage Steakhouse at the Mirage two days earlier which was out of this world and the Prix Fixe menu was exactly as advertised.   Shame on Jasmine and the Bellagio. Would never return.",

The people here are so nice!  2 stars = for the display of muffins, pastries, butter, and fruit on your table already.  No need to go to the buffet for them!  Awesome!    3 stars = for the different kinds of food.  You have oysteres on the half shell, crab legs, pho noodle soup made your way, omelets created how you want it, eggs benedict ( 3 different kinds), waffles, french toast, sushi, dim sum, and all these other exotic items that you will want to try everthing  4 stars = for the separate room reserved from desserts.  You have your chocolate fondue service white, dark, or milk.  Then you have selections of creme puffs with praline sauce! yum!, you have tea cookie assortments, truffles (the hazelnut one is awesome), and of coures the little cakes, mousses, and everything that tastes yummy!  5 stars = for the guy pushing the cart around with duck and the white steamed bread..not sure what this dish is called but it is soo good!  My friend and I topped it off with some mimosa and coffee.  The ambiance is perfect for a Sunday brunch date with your loved one or your bestfriend.  You can even see the Bellegio water fountain show from some seats.  Quite romantic, and simply wonderful.  I love this brunch buffet.  Too bad it burns the pocket a little!  $69/person!  Yikes!  But so worth it if you want to celebrate, or pamper yourself with yummy foods!  Go now!",

Of course we had reservations and personally requested this seat.  It's perfect for a romantic or special outing and to enjoy traditional Chinese food. I will tell you being romanced in this restaurant for a lady with a special place for home cooked Chinese meals will have her falling for you over and over again.  Nothing more enchanting than feel like a queen.",

    "text": "Jasmine is probably the worst Cantonese restaurant at this price range in Las Vegas. The only highlight of this restaurant is the fountain view they offer.  Jasmine does not deserve the four star diamond whatever certificate at all, for their terrible food and service. I do not understand why there are so many five star reviews here. Some said that the food was forgettable and normal. No, you guys are wrong. It is UNFORGETTABLE, it is so greasy, oily, so overcooked and the sauce they used tasted disgusting. Honestly this is not Cantonese food, or real Chinese food whatsoever. This tastes exactly the same as the food court combo you can get for $10.  I understand that this price is normal in Las Vegas, but I think it is not worth it to spend so much money on such food. Speaking about the service aspect, their waitresses were nonchalant and cold. They seemed that they did not care about their customers at all. There was a bit confusion in the beginning and they said they could not find the record for our reservation. But the worst part was they did not even try to help us to solve the problem, they just did not care and acted as if this was our issue. It turned out that it was the hotel reservation department's issue, but their attitude really made me feel that I was not important at all, and they did not care if we can get a table or not. This really upsets me and I feel disrespected. All I wanna say is that I will never come to this restaurant again, and I do not recommend anyone coming here. Better spend your money in casino. Giving two stars only because of the view.",

    "text": "While I can not comment on Jasmine's regular menu as I've never dined during, but their Sunday buffet brunch is absolutely fantastic! The restaurant itself is beautiful. Located facing Lake Bellagio, window seats offer beautiful views of the fountain show. Given the higher price point than most buffets in town ($55 per person + tip. Does not included any beverage. Juices are $6 and cocktails are $12+), you get a lot of less traffic/nose and a lot of peace in return.  The staff at Jasmine is very polite and attentive, which always helps the overall dining experience.  Upon seating, a tableside bakery trio consisted of miniature pastries, muffins, and fruits will be brought to your table (included in the cost, no extra charge). Later on Roasted Peking duck buns will also be brought to your table from their specialist.  Very thoughtful gestures in my opinion.  Jasmine Sunday brunch offers an exceptional traditional American breakfast selection as well as international items. Complete with an omelet station, a cold/raw bar, a carving station and an amazing desert station with an array of treats that will make your teeth rot, in the best way of course.  Brunch items (taken from the restaurant website) If you think they look delicious on paper then just wait 'til you get to try them in person.  Lakeside Shellfish Bar Alaskan Red King Crab, Lemon Aioli Fresh Shucked Oysters on the Half Shell,  Jumbo Poached Shrimp, Brandy-Spiked Cocktail Jumbo Crab Claws, Grainy Mustard Yukio's Nigiri and Maki Sushi, Wasabi and  Pickled Ginger Scottish Smoked Salmon, Dill-Vodka Cured Lox, Traditional Garnishes and Mini Bagel Chips American Caviar, Buckwheat Mini Waffles,  Chive Creme Fraiche  From the Cold Table Compressed Melon and Raspberry Skewers, Ginger-Honey Yogurt Dip Roasted Pineapple and Vanilla Bean Parfait Platters of Sliced Mango, Papaya and Strawberry Kobe Beef Roulade with Enoki Mushrooms and Miso-Butterscotch Dressing Lemongrass Panna Cotta with Crystallized Wasabi Bocconcini and Cherry Tomato Spiedini, Lemon Basil Lobster Medallions with Mango Pearls and Thai Basil Belgian Endive Salad, Crumbled Blue Cheese and Walnut Vinaigrette Kalbi-Glazed Jidori Chicken Salad, Spicy Cashew, French Beans, and Dijon Dressing Beef Steak Tartar a la Robert Roasted Beetroot Salad, Orange, Crumbled Goat Cheese, Citrus Vinaigrette Selection of Imported and Domestic Cheese Quince Cake - Walnut Celeriac Salad, Raisin Baguette Egg-Sellence Organic Brown Egg Service Build-Your-Own Omelets, Scrambled or Fried Eggs Benedict Traditional, Lobster-Potato Cake or Florentine Poached Brown Eggs or Japanese Onsen-Style Egg Peking-Style Duck in Steam Bun Roasted Prime Tenderloin, Puff Pastry and  Black Truffle Housemade Breakfast, Chicken-Apple and  Chorizo Sausage Carved Tableside Choice of Peameal Canadian Back Bacon or Honey-Glazed Slab Bacon  From the Hot Table Caramelized Banana-Stuffed White Chocolate Brioche French Toast Bellagio Mini Waffles with Fountain Vanilla Vermont Maple Syrup Pan-Fried Asian Chicken Buns Dungeness Crab Cakes, Sweet Potato and Corn Hash Crystal Prawn and Spinach Dim Sum Mini Lamb \"Meatball\" Brochettes, Winter Squash Wu Xu-Style Braised Short Ribs, Pickled Mustard Greens Sui Mai Pork Dumplings  Asian Noodle Soup Station  Steel Cut Irish Oatmeal and Stone Ground Grits Brown Sugar, Raisins, Cinnamon  Fountain Brunch Sweets and Desserts Decadent Chocolate Fondue White and Dark Chocolate-Dipped Strawberries Assortment of Truffles, Bon Bons and Tea Cookies Selection of Miniature French Pastries  The restaurant itself, the staff, the food, everything you would expect from a five-star restaurant and more.

Good service, decent prices even on the wine (Vegas prices, so decent enough).    It was odd the the Bellagio front desk couldn't make our reservations for us.  And even odder that when we walked in we had to wait for our table for a little over 5 minutes when the place was almost completely empty.  I had the sweet and sour pork and it came in a half a pineapple!  Seemed like a waste of a pineapple, but maybe all of the innards were in my meal?    So good!  And great atmosphere!  Watching the Bellagio Fountains sway back and forth to our song that we danced to at our wedding made it even more perfect!",

Not just a meal, but an adventure! I had such a blast trying all the different Dim Sum. There was such a great variety of dishes. Something for everyone it seemed.  I can tend to be a bit of a picky eater and there was so much to try and I liked so many things, I can't even remember.  My favorites were the pork buns, crapes, Rambutan fruit (the waitress showed me how to eat), and of course the decadent desserts! Such a good time and the price was worth the experience.

Sorry, but it just wasn't. that great.  $18.88 for three little pot stickers was insane.  Tins Tea House in Oakland California does an incredible job on all of this for less than a 1/3 the price.  General chicken was barely OK...5 pieces and those literally tasted liked chicken nuggets with sweet sauce on them.  $8 for a bottle of water, that tasted just like the free water every other restaurant in Vegas served.  Drinks and wine were way overpriced...took 6 requests for soy sauce to be brought to our table.  Total bill without tip was $79.  No drinks, one appetizer, one entree we split.  I suggest to pass on this place.  There are other restaurants that face the fountain that have outstanding food and service.",

    "text": "Have you ever gone to a formal Chinese dinner and you sit on a round table with a lazy susan with 9 other friends or family.  I reminisce the servers preparing slices of crispy, fatty, rich peking duck skin, with a dab of hoisin and a sliver of green onion in a hot steamy bun.  They would make it one by one as my mouth watered, which seemed like an eternity before they finish making the 10 servings and placing them on the platter.  Onto the lazy susan it goes and one by one they disappear as your tablemates take one.  As it reaches your turn, you allowed to take one......ONE!  You quickly devour it only hoping someone doesn't like duck and there is extra....No luck!  This will never happen at Jasmine's Sunday brunch.  I know i wrote a note so good review of their imperial peking duck, but this is totally different.  The brunch is about $60 and IMHO the best buffet in vegas.  Unfortunately my focus was on the peking duck, tsui mai and seafood.  I easily ate my $60 worth of about 10 peking duck buns, 15 oysters, a dozen shrimp and probably about a 1lb of king crab.  The meats are forgettable, as they were dry and too thickly cut.  The duck...oh the duck.  Its freshly made on the buffet line, by a guy in a suit who expertly slices the crispy duck skins off a whole peking duck and prepares it just like you remember....but you get to take as many as you like......YES!  There is also a noodle station where i think they served pho, but thats not my thing, so i cannot confirm.  I can confirm they dessert room off to the side, where they had a whole room full of dessert samples, a chocolate fountain to dip marshmallows, fruit and rice crispy treats.  There is also an action station that served crepes, i believe.  The service is impeccable and the lakeside view of the Bellagio fountains is beautiful.  Im glad i gave Jasmine another chance as this is now my favorite vegas buffet.",

The ambience was calm and quiet, but not so quiet that we couldn't talk. It was perfect for a romantic dinner or to seat with someone you want to give full attention too.

We also dined at Yellowtail, Olives, Prime Steakhouse, but Jasmine was our favorite.     First, the Service was by far the most excellent we have experienced of them all.  From the hostesses at the front, and to our 2 waiters, they were all so friendly and helpful.   We had drinks at the bar before being seated, because we wanted to wait for a table in the very front near the windows of the fountains.    The Tenderloin was perfect.  You could easily cut it with a fork.  The appetizer of sea scallops were the best sea scallops we had all week (better than Prime and Olives).   We also had the BBQ Duet which was excellent!    Also, the best cocktail on the menu was the Lychee Caipirinha.  I'm a huge caipirinha fan, and this was a great version, much less bitter than a plain one.   I had to get two.      Lastly, the view here is amazing.  You are so close to the fountains, you are practically looking down into them.  If you have time, wait for a table next to the windows.  Just have drinks at the bar until table is ready.    The only slight negative, I think the bar should be larger and more inviting, like the bar at Yellowtail and Lago.  Open that area up so you can see the fountains while drinking cocktails. We probably would have started dining here years ago if the bar was more inviting.",

    "text": "Where to start! My entire Jasmine experience was very unpleasant. We chose this restaurant as were looking for Cantonese food and this popped up on many of our search results. So we went ahead and made a reservation. Even though we had a reservation, when we actually showed up, we were made to wait for a good few minutes before we got to our table. One look at the menu and we realized this place is way expensive than the other restaurants in the resort with much lesser variety. We went ahead and placed an order for Dim Sum Basket and Wok Fried Udon Noodles. The Basket cost us $28 but came with only 3 dumplings of 3 kinds - Like how does one have 3 dumplings between 2 people. LOL! We anyway had half of each dumpling and moved on with our shock. A Dim Sum Platter from Lemongrass which is around the same price comes with a handsome 15-16 dim sums and tasted much better. Anyway, the Udon Noodles was quite good and the quantity was good too. In between, a lady with a camera came over and offered to click us a picture. Thinking this probably s complimentary for all guests, we agreed, Little did we know what we were getting into. So she makes us do a couple of standard poses and then we realize that this probably is not complimentary. So we let our hostess know that we are not interested in the pictures but her response is that we have to let her know ourselves - Weird!! You have allowed her to entertain your guests and you cannot even inform her. We did not see her for the rest of our dinner, so we assumed she had been informed. We then tried to put the bill on our room number at the MGM and they were unable to do so. They did not even try to resolve the issue and we had to pay at the restaurant thereby losing all those precious points. We left the restaurant quite annoyed at the lack of good customer service and started playing the slots nearby and this lady who took our photograph finds us in all this crowd to show us our pictures, We found this very creepy and strange that the staff did not inform her even after we left. And how the heck did she find us!  Anyway, all in all, never going back to this place again - neither for the food nor for the experience.",

Started with the lobster two ways appetizer which was a nice small plate before the main course.   For the main course, the chef made me shrimp with asparagus in black bean sauce. I really enjoyed it and it was just the right amount of spice.   We had two servers. At first a very nice man was taking care of us and then it switched to a lady without explanation. I wish it had remained with the guy. The lady was very nice but a bit slow and we had to ask for the check or we would have been late to our show.   Overall a very good meal but not my favorite on this trip.",

Nothing to rave about or anything I would crave getting again. We had wonton soup, honey walnut prawns, and Kung Pao chicken. The Kung Pao has a nice kick to it, and the prawns were large and you get several, so it was very filling. The rice was a la cart and had to be ordered separately, which I thought was kind of lame since you eat Chinese food WITH rice.   The ambiance is VERY serious and formal, so if that's what you're going for, search no further. If you're looking for a fun, relaxed, enjoyable nice meal, this isn't the right place.",

Completely takes me back to my hometown in the San Gabriel Valley...heart of all traditional Asian food.  My party of 6 ordered a couple of bottles of red wine. All the dishes we ordered, we shared. This is more of a family style entree plates anyways. We ordered the bbq duck platter, fried rice, two orders of the dim sum platters, two orders of walnut shrimp, two orders of seabass, eggrolls, lemon chicken, kung pao chicken, veggie plate and last but not least....a variety dessert platter.

The best part of dinner was the two bottles of wine (cheap wine at that), but that was quickly negated when we received the $350 bill.  On a couple occasions, I was still eating my food and they attempted to take the plate away, so be careful when putting your fork down to try to enjoy your dinner.  At one point, we hadn't even started eating our desert and they attempted to take the plates away.  Our table was so close to the table next to us that I was not even comfortable carrying on a conversation.  It was a very uncomfortable, awkward experience and we left extremely unsatisfied and quite frankly ripped off...Under no circumstances would I ever visit this place again or recommend that anyone else does either.",

Glasses always full and courses came out in timely manner. The view of the fountains and tourists enjoying them was so fun to watch. We loved all the little touches like red roses, beautiful dishes and utensils which even had their own stands. We ordered: dim sum- literally 3 dumplings(lobster, pork, and shrimp), small amount but each so delicious and perfectly seasoned hot and sour soup- decent, I've had better but it was still really good white wine- my hubby liked it so much he had 3 glasses, we should have just ordered the bottle 2 pound lobster- it is $120 but perfectly seasoned and came out hot Chilean sea bass- baked, pretty good just a little too sweet for us greens with minced garlic- delicious hot tea- ok chocolate cake with ice cream- light and delicious with ice cream  Our meal came out to about $330 including a 25% tip but so worth it for quality food and service!   Now that I know they have a Sunday brunch, it is on my must do list next time we're in Vegas.  Thanks Jasmine for reminding us what excellent service and food are all about!",

Overall a good meal, but perhaps not worth the price, especially considering the hotel's other restaurants and their quality for cost.

When we walked in, it was a little too empty making us believe it wasn't as great (never judge a book by its cover).... The bartender was preparing for a mixologist competition they hold annually in Vegas and made us some of his cocktails he has created himself for the competition.  It was fantastic!!! I had Kiss the Dragon which had some chili pepper and even though it had high alcohol content you couldn't taste it.  Talk about getting drunk fast without realizing it, right?  Well, I had the Lobster dumpings which were phenomenal, I wish I got the Shanghai dumplings but I was there with my father who is fasting for Easter and cannot have any meat.  I also had a cup of wonton soup, which by the far, if you've never tasted a REAL cup of wonton soup, no comparisson to what you get on a chinese delivery from home.  Wow!!! So refreshing, didn't have the greasy, oily taste you normally get from your local chinese restaurant.  Handmade wontons were incredible and plentiful!!!  For dinner I ordered the Mongolion Beef.  I have never eaten such tender meat in a Chinese restaurant.  Wow!!!!  The view of the Fountain show going on every 15 minutes was a delight, especially since we were able to hear the music that went with each show, which gave us even more entertainment.  I think it would be even cooler if they had outdoor seating, but there isn't... I guess because the water show is so close to the restaurant, it probably gets mist on its windows.",

This time, I decided to try Jasmine, a much touted and pricey Chinese restaurant.    Now, as most of you know, Chinese food--even delicious Chinese food--is typically quite inexpensive. That's why I was curious to see if there was anything different or tres gourmet about Jasmine to justify it's acclaim AND its price tag. To my disappointment, I found little justification.

Not authentic, very bland and very expensive. The decor was beautiful. The food, not worth the very high bill. A better pick would be the Buffet in the hotel!",

    "text": "Stepped into this restaurant and was instantly transported to a different environment. Its a very elegant and ethnically decorated restaurant. The main attraction is obviously the big glass windows with wonderful views of the fountains in front of Bellagio, esp in the evenings when they come to life the view is spectacular. And that's exactly what you are paying the big $$$ for! Onto the food, we ordered the lobster dumpling - succulent and perfectly pan fried, for main we got the Mongolian beef and eggplant both were outstanding dishes. The beef was melt-in-your-mouth tender and the eggplant was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The delicate flavors of all 3 dishes was very obvious. But be warned just 3 dishes and a drink cost us a whopping $100/- definitely not a cheap place.",

    "text": "FOUNTAIN BRUNCH SUCKS!   SAVE YOUR MONEY!  I recently ate at the Jasmine Sunday Brunch and to be honest, it was the worst brunch I've had in my life.   Who the heck wants all that random, overpriced food at 11 in the morning???  Personally, I don't want crab legs, caviar, oyster shooters, rice noodles and undercooked sausage as breakfast.  The best thing was the omelette station I guess.  I guess it's good if you want fancy over priced chinese food as your first meal of the day.  I would much rather have gone to the REGULAR BELLAGIO BUFFET!!!!  Save your $ everyone!",

    "text": "This is a review about their Sunday brunch.  $58 for brunch?  Yeah.  It's expensive.  I felt guilty spending that kind of money on brunch especially since I'm not wealthy, but let me tell you... it's worth it.  Ok, let me justify it.  For a decent brunch in Vegas, I normally spend about $30.  In Vegas, I'm not looking to eat at Denny's and try to get away with brunch for $10.  $30 is about right for a nice, fun place with decent food for brunch.  Couple that with the fact that I ate so much I barely ate a snack for dinner.  So I saved the cost of dinner, which I would have spent another $30-$40.  Now, add in the elegant and luxurious ambience at Jasmine, sitting next to the Bellagio fountains, and the price isn't so bad!  Now that we've got the sticker shock out of the way, I have to say this is one of the top things you must try in Vegas before you die.  Or maybe I should say, this is one of the top things you must try in Vegas before they get wise to it and raise the price.  So what makes this place so damn good?  Let's start with the Peking Duck.  I am from Hong Kong and I know a good Peking Duck, and this was totally legit.  Crispy skin, they sliced it thin so you only got the skin, not the fat, and not the meat.  The bun that goes with it?  Superb.  Soft, light, and fluffy.  Even Peking Duck at some of the nicer restaurants in Monterey Park can't compete.  I can sit there and eat just that all day.  Poached shrimp cocktail... Gigantic, meaty and delicious.  They had poke style tuna in a little waffle cone made with squid ink.  That was fabulous.  Similarly, they had a beef tatare in a spinach waffle cone.  That wasn't as good, but still pretty tasty.  Smoked salmon was excellent.  They had dim sum (har-gow and shu-mai).  Not the best dim sum I've had, but pretty good.  I would say better than the dim sum found at the Bacchanal Buffet at Caesar's.  So many of the items there were delicious, i can't go through them item by item.  Let's just say I was very impressed by most of the things there.  With that said, there are some things to avoid:  1. The asian noodle soup station.  I love noodles.  I will never turn down noodles.  But at the noodle station you have a choice of maifun (rice noodles) or egg noodles served with chicken stock.  You can add fish balls, fish cakes, and vegetables in it.  The soup was bland.  The noodles were bland.  Just did not hit the spot.  2. Lobster Eggs Benedict.  What's not to love?  Eggs Benedict with Lobster.  Well, it's a poached egg (which was prepared beautifully), sitting on top of a potato cake with tiny bits of lobster in it.  And that potato cake was not good at all.  Mushy, bland, and overall yucky.  The egg on top was delicious though.  3. Mochi ice cream.  This was absolutely disgusting.  The mochi was hard and waxy.  Even frozen supermarket packaged mochi is superior.  Ever had one of those single-serve mozzarella cheese snacks that come in a little waxy package that you peel away to reveal the cheese inside?  Yeah, that's what this felt like.  Break open the mochi shell and just scrape out the ice cream.  There were so many things to try, and even though there were some misses, most of them were hits.  58 bucks is a lot of money to spend (by the way, drinks are not included in the price, so be prepared to spend more than that).  So this is definitely a luxury and a splurge, but completely worth it.",

    "text": "Jasmine is an elegant Chinese restaurant situated at the best possible location inside the Bellagio with a good view of hotel's massive fountain.  The decor is more French than Chinese.  The overall atmosphere suited my aristocratic taste.  This is perhaps one of the most posh looking Chinese restaurants in the world.  I, Dick Darlington dinned here twice for dinner.  Both times I enjoyed myself.  They even have \"monkey picked\" tea on their menu.  These tea leafs were picked by trained monkeys and they are expensive and always only found at the most expensive Chinese restaurants and tea shops.  Of course I ordered some.  Their Peking duck is the highlight of their menu.  It is hard to believe that right in the middle of Las Vegas you can enjoy good quality Peking duck.    Some might argue that their food is overpriced.  However, it is not just the food here that you are going for but also the sophisticated atmosphere and elegant services.  For that I think that it is worth the price.    Sincerely,  Dick Darlington",

If we asked a question about any of the dish; she was extremely rude.  (My son has nut allergy: so I had a couple of ingredients questions). Also she forgot to get our drinks and we had to ask for it.  She kept saying \"got it!\"  As if she was doing us a favor to eat there.  The dishes they served wasn't impressive; was pretty ordinary Chinese food and white rice didn't come with the dish; purchase it separately.   Only 4 tables were occupied in the entire restaurant and we had to wait for a table to be seated.  I don't understand the rudeness of the people that work here.  She didn't even serve us the appetizer chips or offered them us.  I had to ask!  We were staying at the Bellagio for a few days and was so happy to see a Chinese restaurant in the Bellagio but I then to experience this was just horrible. Save your money and go somewhere else.",

Highlights:  - The peking duck is delicious, and authentically prepared.  - Tuna and mango tartar in tiny ice cream cones - just the best treat - Foie gras profiterole - because a cream puff just isn't rich enough?  - Crab legs with bourbon spiked cocktail sauce - A dessert ROOM? Eat everything here too.  The exceptional location can't be beat - upscale dining right behind the Bellagio fountains? It's kind of hard to think of a single thing to be upset about in an atmosphere like that. AND they pipe in the music from the fountains, so you can enjoy the show without standing outside forever.

Two days after the food poisoning at the buffet, my other half finally wants food, and bad service history aside, we tried again... (Incidentally I wrote Bellagio about my last visit right after the fact, and had no response.). He wanted something easy on his stomach...  Well, and empty restaurant at 5:30, they pack us next to... Lest than a foot from, another couple....  With a virtually empty restaurant.  During our appetizer, a young Asian boy hovered over us like a Secret Service guard, watching us eat.  Eerie...  Then both tables of food come...  And both ladies, myself and the other at the table too close for comfort had the same meal....  But the bumbling idiots serve my boyfriend s meal to the table next to us.   It sits there for a few minutes and when the gal realizes their mistake, SHE TOOK IT OFF ONE TABLE AND PUT IT IN OURS!  ( MAJOR NO NO IN FOOD SAFETY)...    When we all said that was unacceptable, the rook it back and offered to cook us both a new meal.  After a fifteen minute wait, no offer of another cocktail while I wait, we get food...  Cold rice, cold soggy nasty Generals chicken I could barely chew.  I'm sure this was my original meal...  And his looked the same, only his meal and plate were scalding hot, like microwaved...   Then to boot, they hovered and rushed, and came to clear out plates before we were even done.  And they took them!!  WTF!!  O was so hungry I would have eaten leather.  Which may have been better...  Then at then end of this $160 debacle, the server drops a nasty small slice of dry flavorless cake in front of us, compliment of the chef... Like it was his fault?  I don't do cake...  My boyfriend tried a bite and feared he'd get FP again...  Save your money and grief.  Stay elsewhere.  Play elsewhere.  Eat elsewhere.  It appears the Bellagio is so intent on taking your money and failing to provide a good time....  Try the Silverton I hear they're remodeling...  It's my next stop. Note:  I'm going to the front desk tomorrow am to lodge a serious grievance.  I will post results, so you will know what you can expect them to do when you have a bad experience...  Don't hold your breath though.  They've already got our money, and this place doesn't give it back.  Greedy bastards, even the Casino is junk these days. #placestoavoid",

The view of course, is phenomenal especially if you're lucky enough to get a table at the window as we were.   The assortment of seafood is endless, raw oysters, shrimp, crab legs, mussels, etc.  The table was also filled with sushi, and several other bite sized items.   The hot dishes were not plentiful but excellent in flavor.  The breakfast bar itself has a selection of anything you could possible want them to whip up including eggs benedict the regular way or eggs over lobster.  Soups are made to order in front of you and the dessert assortment requires a separate room. The carver cut Peking Duck for each person at every table, my first taste of Peking Duck and we loved it!!   I won't describe all of the food items, you'll just have to Google for the menu but trust me, you won't believe what's on their tables.   We ordered mimosas and was told it was cheaper for us to get a bottle of champagne and they would keep the orange juice pitchers coming.  They did.  We each had about  4 mimosas  and the bar bill came to $76.  Our total billl per person not including tip was $87 and well worth it.   Service was  outstanding.  This is not something you would do every week, but give it a try just once.  The experience of watching the fountains perform every 20 minutes or so, and eating great assortments of \"new foods\" is well worth your time.   I posted pictures.",

    "text": "I have to admit, I struggled at how to rate Jasmine, but the \"I've experienced better\" of 2 stars sadly best describes my experience. I was a first time visitor with 2 friends a few weeks ago (they both had been to Jasmine before), and we did the Theatre Menu before the show.  Regarding the ambience, the setting is absolutely beautiful - you are obviously paying a little bit extra for the view. The music subtly changes to the fountain music every half hour, and it is a nice treat inside an already stunning restaurant. Regarding the food, the quality was also excellent. I decided upon the chicken entree, which I could tell had much attention put into its preparation. So yummy.  Where my lower rating unfortunately comes from was the service, which didn't feel worthy of Bellagio-level elegance. Besides our Theatre Menu, we also ordered a noodle dish a la carte, which never came. The waiter did that thing where he didn't write down anything, choosing to just \"remember\" our orders, and obviously, he forgot our a la carte order of noodles completely. My friends are from a part of the US without great Chinese dining options, so they were really bummed out when our desserts were brought out and our noodles had never come. To complicate the situation further, as usual in frustrating situations like this, after the first 15 minutes of our dining experience, our waiter never came back to check in, so by the time we realized he had forgotten to put in our noodle order, we were done with our meals completely.  My friends pushed it aside, but I did let them know that as it was my first time at the restaurant, I would always (sadly) remember how their \"customer needs\" weren't met.  I'm coming back to Vegas this week, and my gut instinct was to take some of my family to Jasmine, based on remembering the taste of the food and the view. However, when I went in to make a reservation, and recalled on my first visit the specifics of how our order wasn't completely put in and how our waiter never checked in during our entree or dessert courses in order for us to mention our forgotten noodles, I hesitated to make a reservation this upcoming trip and am now looking at other options elsewhere.  I do hope that Jasmine can make sure their staff checks in with their patrons THROUGHOUT their meals, so that the patron experience matches the quality of the food and the ambience.",

It was a great experience and I will be back to do it again , and I will bring more friends . Bring friends that haven't had Peking duck before . It's fun to see .   We got outa their for around $200 for 2 courses , a bottle of wine and desert  I read all the people whining about how expensive it was . First of all it's the Bellagio so you know it won't be cheap . Second if you want fried rice and orange chicken go to panda express .  It was a great upscale experience   ***** Oh I almost forgot when you make your reservations ask to be seated by the window so you can watch the Bellagio fountains .

    "text": "This is probably the worst Chinese restaurant I have ever been to in my life.   First of all, super rude staff. Then it took them about an hour literally to come out with the food. My girlfriend and I were so angry and hungry. We told the staff several times. Eventually the manager finally comes and apologizes.  When the food came out it was really bland and the meat was overly chewy like they used the cheapest possible cut of meat possible and decided to make it even worse by doing whatever the opposite of tenderizing is.  Oh but it gets worse. This restaurant was nowhere near full. I'm going to try and be an optimist and say it was half full... but literally it takes us at least 10-15 minutes to get a waitress' attention. Once we ask for the check though it takes literally another 20-25 minutes for them to get the stupid piece of paper to us. Did they take a nap in between?  So the manager gives us a chocolate cake as a complimentary dessert given how ridiculously slow they are. It is the blandest nastiest cake I have ever had and who the hell serves chocolate cake at a Chinese restaurant. Do not go here unless you want to waste your precious vacation time sitting in the worse Chinese restaurant in the world...   Also the seats with the good view of the water in front of the Bellagio were empty the whole time but when we asked if we could be seated there they said no. Really? Once again the restaurant was half full and they literally decided to give the customers the worst tables possible too?  The only reason this place gets any customers is because it is in the Bellagio next to the casino. But honestly save yourself the trouble and walk 5 minutes away to someplace else.",

The food was similar to that of a to go style Chinese food and service was slow with only five tables.   They offer gluten free menu and a vegetarian menu but nothing on the vegetarian menu can be made gluten free. After going back  and forth with the server, I was finally able to come up with something for dinner to eat and it lacked flavor, taste and anything good. It was a big pot of mushy tofu and eggplant that lacked any other texture. Everyone at the table got chow mein, Kung pao chicken, and spring rolls which were JUST okay.   With so many restaurants in Vegas, I'm surprised this over priced Chinese take out restaurant has lasted. We all ended up feeling very ill to my tummies after.   Three stars simply just for views and decor. Food was bland and boring.",

I used to come here very often for traditional Chinese food (family style). I've noticed that the quality of food has gotten worse.  Appetizer: Vegetarian spring rolls: these are the same from their Noodles restaurant.   Hot and sour soup: nothing special  Main Entree: Black Pepper Steak: it's slices of filet mignon in a black pepper seasoning. Thin layer of sauce  Sweet and Sour pork: went the safe route and ordered this Americanized dish. It's served in a pineapple. It's pork covered in a thick batter, then fried and tossed in the sweet and sour sauce with bell peppers and pineapple.  Taiwanese sausage in clay pot rice (Bo Zai Fan): This dish is great for sharing. Feeds around 6 people. You can tell the waiter how many people it's for for the amount of rice you will get. It comes with a special soy sauce flavored rice and Taiwanese sausages with gailan vegetables steamed inside. Let the rice sit longer in the clay pot for crispy rice at the end.  My parents love traditional Chinese food and eat it almost everyday, but even they picked to eat at an American restaurant over Jasmine. That should say something itself.",

Until I ate at Jasmine, that is...  My husband and I were looking for a place to enjoy an early, light meal as we had tickets to two shows starting at 7pm. As we walked along perusing our choices, something drew us toward Jasmine. We spoke to the hostess and found there were tables available (due to being really early) and when told of our concern about completing our meal on time for the show, she assured us that they would make sure that we made it on time.   Then along came Janet, our server. She was simply a joy!!!  Very helpful and friendly while also unintrusive.  She made suggestions when asked and even gave an impromptu chop sticks lesson!    We really wished we could enjoy the \"Jasmine Experience,\" a complete meal listed on the menu from appetizer to dessert, but we're concerned about being overly full, so we passed and chose our own meal plan.  We started with the hot & sour soup & spring rolls. Simply divine!!!  Main course:  sweet & sour pork for my husband (served in a fresh pineapple!) and the General's chicken for me along with sticky rice. OMG!!!  I tried both and can not say enough to do them justice!!!  The meat had the most wonderful crisp texture while at the same time being tender!!!  Fresh pineapple in the pork dish simply melted on your tongue!!!  We also enjoyed two types of cucumber based cocktails that we also enjoyed greatly!  Now, the food and service were enough to justify the 5 star rating, but we haven't mentioned the atmosphere. I'm not a fan of oriental decor, but this place is simply beautiful, and the great view of the Bellagio dancing fountains just brought the whole experience to life. This was among the best meals of my life!!!",

    "text": "What a comfortably pleasing experience.  This Chinese cuisine restaurant has a classy elegant feel with a bright and cheery decor.  Floor to ceiling windows makes the center lakefront-view more breathtaking.  Allowing us to have front row seating to the magnificent fountains, which was truly a sight to see.     Being greeted and seated immediately, already started the evening off right.  Once seated, Paul our waiter for the evening, came over just as the napkins were drawn.  The whole night he was professional, informative, accommodating, attentive, with a nice touch of humor.  Thanks Paul.  On to the food.   *Appetizers: - Lobster Two Ways (the Oriental Salad was excellent, Wok-Fried with Egg Whites was just ok, lobster was almost non-existent.) - Crispy Eggplant with seaweed pork floss (giggity).  Couldn't stop at one.  Had to dust the bowl.   *Main course: - Braised Kobe Ribs(good but not great. Meat was a little on the dry side. Loved the WU XI sauce though)  - Chilean Sea Bass (perfect)   *Dessert: - Red Bean and Green Tea Ice Cream Mochi along w/ tea cakes.  Can't go wrong with this dish. Especially if you're craving Mochi.  - Lastly, recommended by Paul, Mango Bamboo. Check out the pic.  It is as good as it looks.    Looking forward to the next visit.   *Recommended",

    "text": "Buffets are a dime a dozen in Las Vegas and there are many to chose from all boasting about how good they are. Well, this one is for the Sunday Fountain Brunch. Firstly, being located in the Bellagio, you would expect excellent quality and a fine setting.   Jasmine emphasizes both and the service is excellent. I was initially disappointed in the beginning when I was told they needed a reservation for a time which I didn't know about. However, the hostess said we can be seated at the bar instead and since my companion and I weren't picky, we agreed. The setting is beautiful with the windows showing a view of the fountains going off quite frequently. The selection was quite large and the quality of the food was faultless. Nothing was dried out or over cooked in any way. The buffet here is layed out with thought in mind. Portions are small so as not to overwhelm a diner into thinking you can't come back for it again and if you didn't like what you had, it doesn't go to waste. Save room for dessert because there is a small room dedicated to nothing but the sweet side of dining. Again, small portions with a large selection so I suggest pacing yourself. I tried my best, but I didn't even get to the 4 different kinds of ice cream or the 1/2 of the kinds of small tortes they offered.   Final opinion: For the price of admission, I don't think this place was worth it. Yes, the quality of the food was good and presentation was beautiful ( I had my first taste of raw kobe beef and I liked it), but I'll settle for a less formal setting the next time. The selection was good, but I kept thinking something was lacking here and I have yet to figure out what that is.   Tips: Make reservations for a time and come with an appetite. Casual dress is fine for brunch, but I would ask first regarding dinner. I'm assuming the waiter will bring your drinks as requested, but I was sitting at the bar for my meal and the bartender took care of us very nicely. This one is good, but I think the one in Paris Hotel is better.",

    "text": "Dont do their Chinese NY dim sum brunch - poor quality especially for the price. We went to Wing Lei but their CNY brunch doesn't start till tomorrow, decided to try Jasmine instead because they were open, and we regretted it.   Same price as Wing Lei $58.88 (8 is a lucky number) but less choice of dim sum and taste was really mediocre. Also didn't like that they didn't have carts - it really was just a straight buffet. They had large quantities of everything in steamers, so obviously it was all sitting for a while. Even at noon on a Sunday it was only 3/4 full, and an empty buffet always means old food.   I'm not going to bother going into detail of what they had because none of it was memorable. Best thing they had was this mango coconut pudding dessert.   Service wasn't friendly and we had to track them down when we needed something. Unlike Wing Lei the tea wasn't included - extra $8 charge.   This would be a 1 star review if it wasn't for the amazing view of the fountain. That really was it's only saving grace. Oh and I liked the high quality linens.   So if you're craving a high quality/class dim sum experience, try Wing Lei - exact same price but so much better in every way. Jasmine was a huge waste of time and money.",

Got a good table by the fountain and lovely decor.  The ambience is still fantastic. That is where all the good stuff ends.  My hot and sour soup - first the waiter said we do not serve hot and sour soup vegetarian.  After trying to figure out wtf he is saying we managed to agree that he will get me a veggie based hot sour soup.  After the ordering of food we wait.  The hot and sour soup - probably the WORST ever (period)!  I refuse to eat after three sips and when the waiters came to collect the bowls, I told him that this was the worst hot and sour soup ever.  He did not even bother listening or apologizing. He simply took away the bowl.  out come the entree's.  My string beans was crap, the mapo tofu even crappier.  I was so embarrassed that I suggested this restaurant to my friends.  On the other hand they ordered some meat dishes and thought the food was ok.  Now I was hoping after I complained that they would not charge me for the hot and sour soup.  Surprise surprise - I receive the bill and there it was - they had the audacity to charge me for the soup.  1 star for crappy food and crappy service!  They are surviving because of the location and I hope someone shuts these fools down. They even have waiters that can't speak english.  Authentic chinese waiters but crappy chinese food!",

I remember come here a few times years back and being blown away by the selection, the service, and of course the decor and prime spot for the fountain show.  This time around, the food was mediocre, the service was meh, and the only thing going for them was the location.  Had reservations at 6 with a group of 11.  Got seated right near the windows right in front of the fountains.  The waiter arrived and asked if we knew what we would like to order.  He were looking over the menu searching for all the seafood and high end dishes that we had expected to see from our past experiences here but nothing was found.  The menu seemed to have been dwindled down to average Chinese dishes that you can find at any chinese restaurant in Chinatown.  We asked if they had any specials and were offers a crab dish that wasn't even that great.  The would say the best thing we had all night was the Grilled Atlantic Salmon with Hawthorn berry sauce.  It was tangy (kind of like sweet and sour).  In addition the mediocre food, the service was not acceptable for a fine dining restaurant like Jasmine.  The waiter was impatient and pushy.  He continued to rush us throughout the ordering process and even got into a minor debate regarding the menu items with us.  Also, we had to ask multiple times to get refills on drinks.  They might have been short-staffed but coming to a place like Jasmine, you expect to have great service.  My family and I will probably not be coming back here.  We could've paid the same amount and got so much more food at chinese restaurants off the strip with the same (if not better) service.",

One of the diners at a table near ours was wearing trainers and a hoodie, and I noticed another table being seated that included a girl in a short skirt and midriff shirt.  As for the atmosphere, while I can appreciate the classy decor, I'm not a fan of the \"dining hall\" idea. It's just one big long room with bright lights and no interesting layout. Boring.  The biggest disappointment was the food. Halfway through dinner service on the first night of Restaurant Week, and they had run out of the Beef Tenderloin, and had to substitute Mongolian Beef. I am by no means a food snob, but the quality of this dish was no better than something you'd find at Panda Express. I felt gypped.   For appetizers we ordered the duck rolls and lobster dumplings. Not bad, but not fantastic either.   I will say though, that the staff was outstanding. Very helpful and polite.   Overall, for about $50/person, I'd expect a classier establishment with higher quality food, and I'd expect to have nicer things to say about it.",

Ornate door handles the size of children welcomed us into the butterfly foyer where gorgeous yellow garden wallpaper set the theme behind royal chairs and consoles, thick cream mouldings and a stunning black and gold diamond patterned hostess stand.  We were led through the buffet to our table with a grand view of the Bellagio Fountain outside the wall of glass, draped in thick silk hanging from coffered ceilings, the center of which had a square devoted to colorful butterflies floating in a background of yellow happiness.  Each table was placed with shiny silver and exceptionally beautiful pink Versace chargers with a large butterfly in the center.    I can't even begin to describe the food in a way that would do the presentation justice.  Lemon \"trees\" where each cloth-wrapped half lemon hung on a branch, ready for the \"picking\", tiny agrarian jars of salads, (rare beef or crab edamame to name a couple), and mango infused muesli, the tenderest WuXu spare ribs, personal lobster pot pies, red velvet waffles, Nutella and banana French Toast, a dessert room with a towering dark chocolate fountain, vanilla bean and milk chocolate fondues, tiny round truffle balls of fine orange chocolates, homemade marshmallows squares, shot glasses of gelled coffee cheesecake and tiny bite-sized tarts where every piece of fruit was hand-placed perfectly to make each tarte identical.    I ordered a raspberry mint Bellini after a lady at our neighboring table promoted it to me as the most delicious drink.  She was right.  I couldn't believe, and am still wrapping my mind around the fact that there is a place like this.  Jasmine is officially my favorite room, location...I can't even call it a restaurant.  It's beyond that.  Ahhhhhhhh.....",

The Chilean Sea Bass was a highlight as well as the Kung Pow Chicken - both dishes you can get in thousands of restaurants, but here they still stand out.  The atmosphere and attention to detail are extreme. You will not be dissapointed.",

    "text": "** This review is for brunch only ... Holiday Dim Sum Buffet and Fountains Sunday Brunch **  We go to Vegas every year for Christmas. During Christmas and Chinese New Year's, Jasmine has their wonderful Dim Sum Buffet. There is a large selection of dim sum, steamed and fried, and a seafood bar with raw oysters, mussells, de-shelled cocktail shrimp (yea! i am lazy!!) and nigiri sushi. The carving station has one or two selections (beef, lamb, or ham) and there is a soup/congee station and a noodle station!! Love the noodle station. The broth is really good and you get to pick what you want inside your noodles which is served to you in a big beautiful glass cup. FANCY!!  Over the years, the dim sum buffet has gotten a little boring and not as good... BUT...  FOUNTAINS SUNDAY BRUNCH!! yum yum yum! Similar to the Holiday Dim Sum buffet but only with a little dim sum. But there's lobster cake benedict, omlette station, gourmet salads, raw bar, sushi, crab leggies, and lots of other fancy, delicate, delicious treats. The noodle bar is still there too, as well as an entire side room dedicated to desserts -- omggg chocolate fountain AND ice cream!!!! During the Fountains Brunch, each table also gets muffins, cookies, and jams.. and Peking duck comes around on a cart served table to table.   The restaurant itself during the day is very pretty. Yellow and white  with white floral and butterfly accents. The windows look out to the Bellagio Fountains, and you get a free closeup show every 30 minutes or so. One time they even opened the doors and we stood right next to the water!  The service is excellent. Everyone is so nice and helpful. The waiter even put the coffee in to-go cups for us one time because we liked it so much!  Sure its a little expensive... $55-$60 per person for a brunch buffet.. But this is Vegas and its TOTALLY WORTH IT. You sit there with your fancy mango lobster shooter and champagne, looking at the fountains next to the strip and think.. now THIS is life!!  :))",

Food is excellent, I ordered the duck which was exquisite! They prepared it right in front of us. Some food is family style as it comes in large portions.  Price is high, but for fine dining in Las Vegas it is definitely worth the cost. The food preparation and flavoring is something other restaurants should strive for. They are definitely not just slapping dishes together and charging top value for them as you can taste the labor that went into their preparation.   Service is exactly what you would expect for a fine dining restaurant in Las Vegas, Super attentive staff that are there to make you have the most enjoyable dining experience. They are polite but not intrusive. The Maitre D' even recognized us from over ~8 months earlier.",

    "text": "THE WORST restaurant I've dined in, in Las Vegas! This place is one of two reasons I decided to set up a Yelp account.   We came here at the recommendation of a Bellagio employee (We also stayed at the Bellagio). So maybe our expectations were too high (???)   Had a dinner reservation for 4, Saturday 8 pm. Got there a few minutes before 8, waited an additional 15-20 minutes to be seated. No big deal.   The only reason I gave this place 1 star is because I have to & because the fountains are nice to look at. The rest of the atmosphere was quite boring with outdated decor.   Our waiter was no where to be found for most of the evening. Very slow in taking our order & kept disappearing mid-sentence. It also took a very long time to get our food. We weren't being rude or demanding so can't figure out why he provided such horrible service, maybe he had a bad day.   The food was just ok, I've had much better Chinese food in the Bay Area, maybe even at Panda Express. We didn't order drinks (except Pellegrino) & didn't order dessert (couldn't wait to get out of there). Our bill was $160 per couple, gratuity included. For mediocre food & horrible service, really?!   I could've ordered the same amount of food but much better quality, back at home for well under $80!  While we had hoped for a fine, fun, pleasant dining experience on a Saturday night in Vegas, this was definitely NOT it. I am also wondering if we dined at the same restaurant as other Yelp users. Yikes!  Needless to say, we will never return to this restaurant. Very disappointing.",

I guess I should've known it'd cost an arm and a leg when my plate was Versace. Seriously?  No offense intended, but our waitress seemed to speak very little English. I think she felt as awkward about this as we did, as she rarely stopped by our table to check on us.  The food was delicious and very filling. It trends toward the pretentious side, however, with their tables covered with caviar, fois gras, lobster and other such nose-in-the-air types of foods. I stuck to old standbys like prime rib, crab cakes, bacon and the like. I was full after 2 plates.   The dessert bar is the highlight here: cookies, pastries, chocolates and a dip-it-yourself chocolate fondue station. Heaven.  I was zapped back into reality when the bill came: 3 buffets, 2 mimosas and 1 coffee: $235. SERIOUSLY??  And the mimosas weren't even bottomless!",

We went there for the second night in Vegas, as the mother-in-law's birthday dinner.    First, the view is amazing.  Its right in the middle of the hotel on the fountain side.  Throughout dinner, you get the show of the fountains as well.  We got the middle table against the windows which just added to the ambiance.  For the food, we went for the family style (except the wife and I got our own soups).  The soups were absolutely delicious!  I got the Hot and Sour soup, which was just perfect.  The wife got the chicken corn chowder, which she has been talking about since we left!  The family got the spring rolls, dumpling trio and one more I can't remember.    For the meals, we got 5 entrees for the group.    The peking duck which was amazing.  They serve it to you in two courses - a pancake, which was incredible, and a lettuce roll which was not as great, but also amazing.  Next up, the General Chicken.  Just a great dish.  Great flavor. Then the walnut prawns which were delicious!  The sauce was just so nice and flavorful.   Next, the Kobe Beef short ribs, which were my highlight.  The flavor was incredible, the sauce perfect, and the beef just melted in my mouth. Finally, we got the seafood fried rice.  It was good, nothing special, but its hard to stand out with the other dishes when you are just a fried rice.  For dessert, they gave us a special plate.  There were four corn muffins surrounding an orange cake.  The low point of the evening.  It tasted good, but nothing special.  Service was impeccable.  They were attentive and friendly.  Someone did come around and offer to take your picture.  We agreed, but then they sell the picture to you for 40$ a picture.  It was a special occasion, so we got one... but it was a little odd for such an upscale place.  All in all, amazing food, view, and service.  Yes, its VERY expensive, but its Vegas, and the Bellagio, and great food... don't be surprised by the cost!",

The wine by-the-glass list is inexplicably short, but the options are decent.  The view of the fountains is great at certain tables.  We were not at one of those tables.  We ordered:  -  Crispy Eggplant (chef's special appetizer): tasty, but oddly dry.  Served with an overly dusty coating and no sauce.  -  Hot and Sour Soup:  All hot, no sour, with an unwelcome sweetness.  They took it off the bill, though.  -  Kung Pao Chicken:  Bland in taste and texture, with large, flat medallions of tough chicken and super-sweet cashews overpowering any hope of a savory note.  -  Braised Kobe Short Ribs:  Stew meat served on a gelatinous bed of noodles oozing some kind of thin brown liquid.  Tasteless and unappetizing for everyone at the table.  We were far too disappointed by this point to try dessert.  Plus we were both still hungry, so we left and got chili-cheese fries at Snacks on the casino floor.  Now THOSE were really good!",

We didn't try a lot of the standard Western brunch items (eggs, french toast, pancakes) but we were really pleased with the Asian offerings.

I had the Dim-Sum Basket Trio (super TINY portions, not that great as it was soggy) and the Crispy Walnut Prawns, tasty and 8-LARGE prawns (truthfully nothing special, although delicious). We also shared some Jasmine Fried Rice (HUGE dish, easily enough for 4 or more!) very unusual texture, yet quite delicious.

The prices here are a bit shocking for typical Chinese cuisine, but it is at the Bellagio. This is a special occasion- splurge on fancy Chinese food kind of place.   We had the Jasmine Signature Vermicelli noodle, Szechuan-Style Spicy Ma Po Tofu with Minced Beef and Chilean Sea Bass with vegetable fried rice. All were very good but my favorite would probably be the sea bass.

We arrived at 7:00 for our reservation, by 7:30we were still not seated. It wasn't like they were even busy. When we did get seated at 7:30, I counted maybe 20 out of 50 tables occupied. Now--time to order a drink / water............................. that took another 5-7 minutes and I had to get up and flag somewhere down.  We finally ordered dinner---starting with the variety appetizer. There was a pork potsticker which was ok. Second was a piece of pork--best of all 4. The crab Rangoon was just plain awful!  The fried shrimp was greasy and smelled like old rancid oil--took one bite. Not a great start--my local take out is 100 times better for these items  For main course we ordered Peking Duck. My husband loves Peking Duck and was really anticipating it The waiter brought out the Duck on a silver platter. He proceeded to just hack away at the duck meat. This is supposed to be a fancy show to the diners. This guy clearly did not enjoy what he was doing and just hacked away--there is no other word. I actually had to look away--it was so unpleasant. He then proceeded to make all of the Duck wraps. I would have liked to make my own and adjust to my taste. The pancakes were more like tortillas than crepes. The meat was dry and tasteless and really hard to eat.   Overall, we left hungry and totally disappointed--after paying a rather large bill.",

I added more pepper flakes to make it spicy.   Worth the price!  Best to reserve a table in advance.",

    "text": "Jasmine just might be one of the most beautiful dining rooms in the entire city of Las Vegas.  It is classically appointed and full of opulent charm and character.  A rare example of Chinoiserie finery!  The prime location along the Bellagio fountains with floor to ceiling windows only add to the magic of it all.  What a welcome break from the cold, soulless \"modern\" decor of newer places opening up on the Strip!  (coughlagocough)  The food is every bit as wonderful as the setting.  The ingredients are high quality and the cooking is skillful and refined.  Don't come here expecting rustically-prepared, homey dishes like you're used to from your local neighborhood joint.  Things are seasoned with a deft hand and finer attention to detail that can sometimes be overlooked (obvious in many of these other reviews).  The recent menu changes are fantastic, too!  Classics like the Peking Duck still remain on the menu.  The crisp, perfectly rendered skin is something I'll never get tired of!    Service is friendly, professional and warm.  The staff is particularly good at welcoming back previous guests.  The wine list is wonderful and Sarah, one of the sommeliers, is always particularly helpful.",

She gave us just enough privacy and was so pleasant. We opted to get the whole lobster fried schezuan style, Kobe brisket and the pork and duck for an appetizer. Everything was amazing. My favorite was the brisket, but my fiance's favorite was the lobster. The restaurant is beautifully lit, considering a lot of restaurants these days are so dark you need a flashlight to read the menu and the view behind the bellagio fountains were amazing. The only thing I didn't like was the lady that came to the table to take pictures of us. The pictures turned out ok, but after giving us our pictures that we paid for she kinda hung around expecting a tip which I wasn't sure if we were supposed to tip her or not so it made it a little awkward lol.  But the experience we had was amazing.",

It was $68/person and it's not that much more than what the buffet was charging across the way.   They open up at 11 and people were lined up as they opened up.  We thought we could stroll in whenever we wanted but we were told to come back in 1 hr.  We got a great seat right against the windows and saw the fountains up close.  The buffet is not only dim sum dishes but there was a carving station with different meats, raw bar and sushi, and there's also a noodle station with made to order noodle dishes.  The dessert selection is pretty good too, my favorite dishes were the macarons and chocolate covered strawberries.  Overall it was a great dining experience and we'll return next time.",

    "text": "First, can we just talk about the view???  I mean oh my stars!!  The dining room is surrounded on 3 sides by windows that view the Bellagio Fountain perfectly!  We dined on NYE so the water shows were going off, what seemed like, every 15 minutes!  That in and of itself made for an amazing experience.  Since we came for New Year's Eve, there was a preset 4-course meal (see picture).  I usually don't like to eat at places this fancy - 1)not enough food 2)I have a bland palate and don't like froo froo things to eat.  But this meal?  A-MAZING!  We had reservations for 8:30pm, but were seated a bit later than that.  No biggie.  The host took us back behind the check-in desk and that's when I saw it...THE VIEW.  The wait staff was impeccable, very attentive to our needs, new silverware needed, refill water, etc.  I guess if there's one thing great about expensive, fancy restaurants, you really do pay for what you get!  The meal was amazing, you can view the pictures for a \"taste\" but I wish you all could have tasted it.  I think my favorite dish, though, was the soup that was brought out in a fresh young coconut.  Best part for me?  I scraped the coconut meat out of it and ate it...mmmmm mmmm goodness!  Downside:  There was a photographer going around to each table taking optional photos for everyone, which were to be ready for viewing before the end of our dining experience.  We actually waited and waited after the check was already paid for her to return with our photos (that she had just told us 15 minutes prior that she was going to do).  But instead, we observed her still taking photos at other tables so as not to miss the NYE festivities on the strip, we said \"forget it\" and left.  I really wish I could've seen those pictures, though...  This was a special occasion so I don't know if this review might be a bit biased.  I'll have to try it again on a \"normal\" dining day for the real experience!  Well...if I have enough money, that is ;)  Pretty pricey, this one!",

We had sweet and sour chicken, wok choy soft noodles, veggie rice, and salmon and our family of 4 was able to easily split this. The best drink I've ever ordered from a restaurant was here and called the Dragonfly. So good!!! This place will not disappoint.

My party got an assortment of dishes, including the Dim Sum trio, crispy walnut prawns, general chicken, and kung pao chicken, which will be dissected below.  The General Chicken was named pretty accurately, it was very \"General\" in nature.  Not a lot of flavor and could have been whipped up by an amateur chef with simple ingredients.  The crispy walnut shrimp was simply not up to par - I've had better quality and flavor from Panda Express.  Kung Pao chicken was OK, but still nothing to write home about.  Dim Sum trio was a straight up ripoff... I'm sorry, but if we knew THREE (yes, 3) dumplings would have costed us $18.88, we probably wouldn't have ordered them.  Said dumplings were also very run of the mill in quality and flavor.    Service was pretty good, but was honestly expected for the price gouging we endured here.",

Prices can rack the bill pretty quick specially if you decide to explore the non menu items.However, you will be getting awesome quality ..fellas this is the real deal, the hatori hanzo katana of Chinese food, not your 10 dollars replica at the mall kiosk (as long as you dont order the regular stuff)  The food is amazing . Its freshness and taste was top knotch. Very unique and original plates are served in generous portions. This is definetly a sharing style kinda place.The dumplings are as fresh as you will get them and the wonton soup packs lots of flavor, however for me it was all in the entrees. We literally ordered every plate on the menu (big group) and can tell you that all of them were outstanding. I was getting karate chopped with flavor from every bite of every dish. I recommend the duck,Crab , Neptune pillow ,Seabass and soya prawns and compliment it with some Chinese broccoli and fried rice..BEWARE, if you are a panda express,  type of guy , you wont find most of those plates here.However, the menu has some items that wont freak you out and are catered towards the non Chinese guest. If you are into real Chinese food ask the server and the chef will make it for you   Service is impeccable since we walked in . The restaurant carries a Fresh smell and a nice waiting room with Chinese candies. They have a sommelier that will approach the table plenty of times . Your plates will be constantly changed and my drink never saw anywhere lower than  1/2 full.  This plus the decoration made the whole ambiance perfect . Nothing like watching the Bellagio fountains while having dinner!. I really  enjoyed this meal and it was a great experience. If you want to indulge yourself on a fancy Chinese dinner  this place will definetly rock your world while making a dent in your pocket. A very well worthy dent though!",

The food is really top notch and the ambiance is quite classy. It's a little pricey for lunch but really a good deal when you consider the quality of the food you get all you can eat. If you are in the mood for a good Sunday brunch, I highly recommend Jasmine. They are strict with their reservations and it's a hard seat to land so plan ahead!",

    "text": "This was one of the worst experiences I had for a buffet style brunch. Not much choice in the buffet, old sushi from the night before, fatty prime rib, sour Peking duck and classic brunch options. The only thing fancy was the 3 tier fruit and dessert plate they bring. By plate I mean 9 grape size cutouts of melons, 3 mini muffins and 3 jams and some butter. There is no bread to even spread the butter on. I wish I could ask for a refund and charge them additional for my feedback on how you can make this awesome scenic spot the best brunch place in town with an awesome menu. It's super expensive and you expect nice service right? The waiter wasn't very attentive for the price and tip we were paying. Don't feel important when you see the fancy designer plate setting coz as soon as you sit they take it away!!! What rubbish. Don't put it there in th first place and don't charge for an expensive brunch for this below mediocre brunch selection. Almost forgot, desserts were equally bad. How about making fresh crepes you guys!? The view was breathtaking, however we were seated in an awful table with no view despite requesting a nice view twice the day before. I want my money back!!! Don't go unless you want to feel robbed.  Edit: I will give Jasmine another shot perhaps for dinner.",

    "text": "This review is for the Sunday Fountains Brunch at Jasmine. First and foremost, the setting is absolutely stunning. The restaurant is situated at the absolute middle of the lake, with huge windows looking over the lake and fountains- which by the way are going off what seems like every 10 minutes for the brunch period. This is a very very nice place to spend the afternoon.  The food was good- with most high-end brunch buffet items represented such as an egg/meat station, canapes, noodle soup bar, and steamed items station. The best part in my opinion was the dessert room- with a selection of sorbets, mochi ice creams, French desserts, and (best of all) a dark chocolate fountain.   All in all, the food was good, but for the same price ($58), the food at the Jazz Buffet at the Country Club at Wynn is better. But the setting here is nicer.  So- if you keep all that in mind, you'll have a great time.",

    "text": "I have to say, I am amazed at the good reviews this place gets.  But, then again, I know that the average Las Vegas visitor is all about the glitz and, well - taste isn't exactly the strongest of traits . . .usually.  I'll have to keep telling myself this because it is the only way to explain some of these reviews.  We popped in on Tuesday evening, May 8th, 2012 . . . the menu looked interesting, and since my Vietnamese partner had not really enjoyed the food offerings of Las Vegas to this point, we decided to give this supposedly fine Chinese restaurant a go . . .  I guess it should have been a hint when there was no wait and no need for reservations.  And, that's even with it having an amazing view of the Bellagio fountains right outside its windows.  (I went to their website to find the exact dishes on their menu, but they only seem to have the brunch menu and a special mother's day one - so, sorry).  We started with some appetizers - the spring rolls (which were bland, nothing special and weren't a far reach from frozen ones) and, we ordered a side-order of the Chinese broccoli - which was cooked fine, but again, nothing special - just plain, steamed with no seasonings at all.  Meh.  My partner ordered the tofu dish - (which is in one of the photos posted on <a href=\"http://Yelp.com\">Yelp.com</a>) . . . . small square cubes of tofu in a sauce which was supposed to be spicy . . . it was not.  When my partner pushes a dish away and is quiet, I know it is below par (it doesn't happen often).  I am not a tofu fan, but I tasted the sauce, or at least attempted to taste it - because, frankly, it had almost zero flavor.  I've never tasted a more bland sauce.  Another member of our party and I ordered a whole fish dish that was fried (sorry I can't remember the name of the dish, but I believe it was the only fried fish dish on the menu).  The fish was fried nicely, a rather pedestrian batter, but nicely done - a tad overcooked, but at least fresh.  But, the sauce.  The \"fresh\" tomato sauce.  Seriously, it tasted like dollar-store ketchup with a little white vinegar and maybe a splash of Hoisin sauce.  It was definitely not made fresh - and was so ketchupy that it was really horrible.    I want to say, I cannot remember in my years of eating in all sorts of restaurants and cafes all over - I cannot remember EVER complaining about a meal.  And, again this time, I sucked it up and ate my fish, trying to avoid the sauce - but, I really couldn't stand seeing my partner not eating anything after only a couple of bites.  The waiter was obviously not pleased, but he did allow him to reorder - pushing hard for the chow mien, which he ordered.  This dish was so salty that it was inedible.  (I had to later take him to an all night diner just so he didn't have to go to bed hungry).  The waiter was not happy at the prospects of THIS dish also not being acceptable.  He said he would talk to his manager - and came back and said that his manager said that everyone could have dessert (pre-selected, not our choice) - on the house.  We didn't want dessert and politely asked that my partner's meal be taken off the check.  Instead of responding - he kept trying to place the dessert in front of my partner.  When we said no, he finally came back and said the manager had taken it off the check.  Now, about the manager - I don't know if it was Mr. Roberto Liendo as listed on their website or if it was someone else.  What I do know is that he is a total coward.  Have the courtesy to come to the table and talk to us about the meal - especially since everything was so sub-par (we did tell the waiter about the fish, but did not ask for it to be removed from the check).  Considering the prices of this food - anyone would expect that the food be extraordinary - or at least above par.  This wasn't even as good as most take-out Chinese restaurants.    Oh, the place is beautiful - but, that's the only value to this place based on our visit.  A horrible experience and I would highly suggest that if you are reading this review while trying to decide where to eat - pass this one up - you can go outside to see the fountains.",

The generals chicken literary tasted like a can of sweet and sour sauce from a can was used, not elevated one bit for over $30. We sent it back and got Kung Pao which was better but not an elevated dish. The noodles were just OK, not much flavor and not worth over $30. The best thing was the boc choy. Pretty sad for a bill of $150 with tip. To top the night off, I see they charged us for soda refills, $20 for diet soda for two.   Don't waste your money, seriously, I was so upset it ruined our night as I really felt taken advantage of.",

Their food is family style and they have a huge lazy Susan that spins so you can try everyone's food!  We started off with scallops and the combination platter and they were so yummy you got a little bit of everything!  For dinner we had everything from steak to seafood to udon noodles and everything was amazing. The flavor on everything was spot on! I had the Chilean sea bass and it was honestly one of the best sea bass dishes I have ever had!  Service was pretty good, our waiter was on the ball for the most part but seemed to forget our wine throughout the night. Ordered a glass of white wine to pair with my fish and it never came out with my fish, unfortunately had to ask twice for my wine. We are also really big on desserts and they brought out a birthday dessert for my mom but never asked the table if we wanted dessert and never gave us a dessert menu. Seemed like our waiter must have been tired by the end of the night but overall was really fun and we will probably be back soon!",

    "text": "This was my second visit to Jasmine at the Bellagio.  The first visit was for a regular Chinese dinner.  Every year during the Lunar New Year time, Jasmine holds a specially priced brunch.  It is not advertised except for a sign outside the entrance.  Thanks to Michael U for letting me know about the brunch.  I made a reservation for 11 AM when they start.  After the initial rush of people who had been waiting, I got to the podium, gave my name, and she handed off a slip to the person that showed me to my seat.  I opted to sit with my back to the wall rather than watch the fountains.  I enjoy the people watching and I can see the fountains anytime.  Besides, in the West, don't sit with your back to the door--something I learned from the movies!  I got up and started what was a wonderful buffet of so many different foods.  The chafing dishes are set up on two sides and each side is identical with the other so the flow of people is much faster.  Around the perimeter of that area of the room is where you could get traditional egg custard, sesame balls, and different soups including congee.  There's an area with crab legs, shrimp, and sushi.  The carving area has pork belly, prime rib, duck, and lamb.  Finally the dessert area is well stocked with chocolate covered strawberries, macarons of different flavors, and mini cream puffs along with some small cakes.  This is especially good for a solo diner because I could get one piece of dim sum instead of a whole order like served in restaurants.  The options were super!  I especially liked the scallop dish in small aluminum foil rounds, the pork belly, char siu pork wrapped in glutinous rice and steamed.  Finally, the pork belly, duck, and desserts were top notch!!  Service was outstanding.  I had said I should do this once for the experience.  Now, it will  be a yearly tradition to enjoy the New Year brunch at Jasmine.",

    "text": "Who eats Peking Duck for Thanksgiving?   ::::raises hand:::::  I'm not much of a traditionalist, I tend more towards iconoclast. Not that I'm intrinsically opposed to traditions. For example, Thanksgiving just wouldn't be Thanksgiving without A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving. But, as far as turkey and pumpkin pie and that nasty cranberry stuff goes... I can live without it.   For the second year in a row (damn, sounds almost... traditional!) we headed off to Las Vegas for the Thanksgiving holiday. My wife is from Vietnam, and I'm non-traditional as mentioned, so some years we've visited my family for the turkey, pumpkin pie, nasty cranberry stuff type dinner, and some years we've popped in for KFC takeout. Last year I believe we just had a quick bite at Mandalay Bay.  This year I decided on Jasmine at Bellagio: an elegant nouveau Chinese restaurant, with some prime views of the fountain shows just outside. I figured their Imperial Peking Duck would be a spectacular alternative to the traditional turkey.   Reservations made for 6 pm, and reservations honored. Traditional menu for food, funky tablet menu for drinks. A sommelier is available, but I was desirous of a cocktail. The White Tiger was tasty and rather strong. Felt the effects before finishing off one, but needed the second to validate. Wanted a third, needed a third, deserved a third, but abstained. My wife went with Perrier. I mean, seriously? We're spending $300 for dinner, it's not like another $20 for a cocktail for her would break the bank. (Birth of our daughter did that!)  So, the meal consisted of complimentary shrimp crackers. Reminiscent of munching on shrimp-flavored air. Chose the Combination Platter for an appetizer, which consisted of BBQ Pork, Pot Sticker, Crab Rangoon, Fried Shrimp. Tasty, but not spectacular. Ordered a dish of Jasmine Fried Rice, mainly for Princess Kiana. Was much lighter, less oily, than your typical fried rice. Not realizing the Duck would be sufficient to fill our bellies, we also ordered an entree of Wok-fried Flank Steak, in a BBQ garlic sauce.   Of course, the star of the show was the Imperial Peking Duck. It's served in two courses: the first being, Tableside Service with Crepes, Scallion, Cucumber Julienne and Hoi Sin Sauce. Later you'll receive the second course of Wok-tossed Diced Duck Meat with Jicama, Served in Butter Lettuce Cups. The Duck was nice and crispy, but man, that's a lot of duck for two people!! And since my wife is both female and identifies as female, I was required to eat 6 of the 9 Duck crepes and 5 of the 6 Diced Duck Cups!! That's a lot of duck!! Luckily, it's Chinese food, so I was hungry an hour later!! ::::drum rimshot:::: Thank you, thank you!! I'll be here all week!!  So.....  the rating. The restaurant is elegant, though the chair upholstery is a bit gauche, for my tastes. It's a \"classy\" atmosphere.... if you photoshop out most of the diners. The food was very good, though  not stunningly exquisite. And the service... was professional, yet haphazard. Wouldn't distinguish it as expeditious. There were some lengthy gaps between this and that. Took quite awhile to order, took a helluva long time to get the bill. My daughter's fried rice took more than an hour to appear. Since we weren't seeing a show afterwards, it was more annoying than aggravating. (That third White Tiger cocktail, that I most definitely deserved, would have been a pleasant accompaniment during that long wait. Woulda, coulda, shoulda!!)  Frankly, I almost feel like giving the experience 3 stars, but the reason I give 4, (and could have been 5) is the lady who sliced the duck table side. I chanced to witness her performance through the evening, and I was seriously impressed!! No, I don't know a damn thing about slicing no duck, but I know a hard-working and conscientious employee when I see one. Because they're as rare as.... they're so damn rare there's nothing to compare the rarity to, that's how rare!! She was hustling!! (Profound apologies for mangling the name but) I think her name was spelled Zhe, Zse and pronounced like \"she\". Something close to that. If I ever open a duck slicing business I'm hiring her away from Jasmine!!!  All in all, we enjoyed the dinner, but the lackadaisical service did kind of damper our enthusiasm. Maybe it was just an off night. I hope so. Other than that, I'd recommend it.",

I was mildly skeptical at first because I saw Kung Pao chicken and general tso chicken on the menu.   The view from the dining area is surreal with a 270 degree view of the Bellagio fountains.   Our server yin was amazing. He was very attentive and made some excellent recommendations. I was a little bit confused by the silverware setup because there were two forks, which is normal, but two pairs of chopsticks. At first I thought perhaps it was one for appetizers one for entree... But I think one was for grabbing food to put on your plate, then one for putting the food in your mouth.  We started with giant clam and live santa Barbara prawn sashimi followed by the secret menu sharks fin soup at $200 a bowl. Then we had the Peking duck(they use the tortillas instead of the buns so you know it's legit), the heads of the prawns friend with salted duck yolk, sauteed snow pea leaf, Taiwanese style 3 cup live cambodian fish, XO sauce string beans, and the giant clam stir fry. Everything was delicious and I can't pick a favorite.   For dessert we had a medley of coconut, vanilla, mango, and strawberry ice cream(the coconut is amazing), mango pudding, which is not too sweet, and finally the best green tea creme brulee I've ever had. I mean I've had it at many restaurants, usually Japanese, but this one was by far the best.   Overall amazing and memorable dining experience with our bill just under $2000 for 4 people... So... I would probably put more than 4 dollar signs on this place.",

I usually do not like duck, however, I enjoyed the crispy duck very much !  The shark fin soup was good. I liked the fresh goby fish flown in from Cambodia although the 200 dollar price tag for the clay pot was a bit steep... which was the same price for a bowl of the shark fin soup.  Salted fish fried rice was also very good. The mirugai/geoduck/giant clam we had was done as sashimi for the first course and stir fried as the second dish. We really liked the shrimp sashimi with their heads fried in salted egg yolk. Very good!  Snow pea leaves sauteed with garlic was my favorite! We also had string beans with XO which was super, but if I had to pick between the two, snow pea leaves are the winner.  Dessert... we had a bunch of them. My stand out favorite was the coconut ice cream",

    "text": "In the era of Social Media and Public Relations it is rare to see any sort of dining event kept \"secret,\" but for two weeks each year Jasmine at The Bellagio quietly opens its doors during daylight hours for a Dim Sum Brunch celebrating the New Year, first in a global sense and then to commemorate the Chinese version.  Unadvertised save for a colorful board outside the Restaurant, this year spanning February 2nd to the 11th from 11:00am until 2:30pm, it is approximately fifteen minutes prior to opening etched doors that guests begin queuing, never mind the fact that most have reservations but rather for the chance to sit with an unobstructed view of Bellagio's famous fountains.  Attended for the second consecutive year, a cost of $68.88 per diner and just $20.00 for children far lower than Jasmine's equally splendid dinner, it was after seating by familiar staff including Connie Shin that most guests stood to begin perusing some ninety choices spread across a variety of Buffet and Live Stations.  Truly a grand display, traditional Dim Sum and Chinese Barbeque lined up alongside items decorated in everything from Truffles and Bird's Nest to Abalone, it would not be long before most early arrivals returned to their table with plates full, fresh Oysters and Crab Legs a popular choice amongst the largely Asian crowd though many also gravitated towards a display of baked and fried Dim Sum that this year replaced Walnut Prawns with Shrimp Balls while retaining previous favorites including Cheese Baked Buns and flaky Egg Tarts with Bird's Nest.  Moving slowly and eyeing variety, Shellfish and Sushi declined in favor of items less commonly experienced in such a setting, it was as a young woman played the guzheng that plate two was enjoyed, the Braised Brisket a little tough but five other options all exquisite with special attention reserved for wrapped Pork and Sticky Rice that is just a touch sweet plus gently steamed Eggplant topped in vibrant X.O. Sauce.  Focusing next on silver steam trays lining the center, left and right mirrored to create a seamless flow of traffic, it was as the fountains again danced outside that Sea Cucumber and Black Truffle each made an appearance prior to again tasting Jasmine's brilliant Sea Moss Scallop Dumpling,  the explosive flavors only rivaled this year by Siu Mai given a big upgrade by way of tender Abalone which leads well into Nian Gao that is lightly caramelized such that a slight crackle gives way to sticky sweetness.  Sad to see Cordyceps Congee replaced by Fish and Peanuts, though both texture and taste remain refined, it was after a few Barbecue choices that all-new Bubble Waffles were tasted, the choice to grab pre-made segments or wait for fresh obvious to all but the impatient with the reward hot and fluffy beneath a selection of condiments including freshly Whipped Cream, Berries, Candy and four flavors of Condensed Milk.   Making another trip for favorites, a fresh tray of Sesame Balls better than the first thanks to more textural contrast, it was only Passion Fruit Shooters and Matcha Cake that were passed-up amongst Dessert choices, the Choux a bit mixed with some flawless and others a bit damp while Macarons, Guava Tarts and a narrow glass of Panna Cotta plus several fresh Fruits were all delicious.    FIVE STARS:  Although Las Vegas' Dim Sum scene improved tremendously in 2018, both Mott32 and China Tang bringing their Hong Kong brands to Sin City, there remains no other time or place to experience such variety and quality as Jasmine during their annual celebration of the New Year.",

    "text": "Sometimes you just have to treat yourself. Decided to splurge on some expensive ass Chinese food  What I ate: - Peking duck: I would highly recommend this duck. The skin was crispy, the meat tender and fatty. This was so addicting. I could have just eaten this duck dish and been happy. The flatbread/tortillas were freshy and soft. With the cucmber and green onions, the duck was so good, that you didn't even need the sauce - Duck lettuce wraps: They took the rest of the duck, sauteed it with other veggies and made lettuce wraps. Super fresh and delicious. Well seasoned, not too salty - Walnut shrimp: This was perhaps my least favorite dish of the night. Not to say it was bad, I personally am not a fan of walnut shrimp. Shrimp were gargantuan by the way - Braised tofu: This came out in a small stone pot, and it was sooooo good. Plenty of tofu, veggies, mushrooms. Really good with rice, not too salty - Eggplant: Garlicky, well cooked. This was also delicious - Veggie fried rice: Next to the walnut shrimp, this wasn't the best fried rice I've ever had. The onion was way too strong and sharp in flavor, as if they didn't let it cook and mellow out. But I still ate 1/2 my bowl - Green tea creme brulee: We only really ordered this because after such a meal, it felt wrong to leave without ordering a dessert. Honestly, I would have been happier with a small fruit plate of apples and oranges. It tasted more like a green tea mousse intead of a creme brulee. Definitely skip this dessert  Pros: - Really delicious chinese food - I loved that we were able to see the Bellagio water show every 15 mins while we ate dinner. The floor to ceiling windows really helped with that - Service was impeccable - Food was wheeled out, covered to keep it warm. I really like this because the food seemed to be piping hot - Those beautiful butterfly plates! Flatwear was so decadent with the gold utensils.  - Small bathroom inside the restaurant, which was great. I hate having to leave the restaurant and get back on the casino floor just to use the bathroom when dining on the strip  - Full bar  Cons: - Pricey! Very expensive. But it's high quality and fine dining - Decor seemed a bit dated. They really embraced that gaudy floral look - This seems so small, but I thought it was weird that the drinks menu was on a tablet, while the regular menu was printed out. Why not just keep it consistent and all on regular menu, or have it all on the tablet?   Would I come again? If I feeling like a splurge, yes!",

We decided to walk the strip read menus and try little things from each place that seemed appealing. We decided to stop here and try the dumpling trio and hot and sour soup. The soup was definitely the best hot and sour soup each of us had ever had in our lives. The dumplings were good but I wasn't blown out of the water. What really impressed me was the sauce to put on top of that. However, paying $20 for literally just 3 dumplings I expected higher quality fillings and maybe bigger dumplings; but we knew what to expect at Bellagio. A huge plus which keeps it at 4 stars was the service. Any time our waters for half full they were immediately filled, and the view was breathtaking.  So we would be back for the soup, service, and view but the dumplings were just mediocre.",

We ended up getting a lovely table right by the window so we could see the Bellagio fountains outside.  Definitely see if you can do that if you eat at the restaurant.  I will say there food is very typical Chinese food.  Nothing special for such an expensive restaurant.  Portions were small for the price.  But I guess it is the Bellagio.  My local Chinese restaurant has just as tasty food for a lot less. But it was nice for Christmas dinner.  We started with the Cantonese Wonton Soup with Pork and Shrimp Dumplings. This was very tasty.  Lots of mushrooms and other veggies.  They did also bring some shrimp chips that we ate of a few of but they food came fast so we did not have more of them.  For entrees, we shared the Wok-Fried Flank Steak - BBQ Garlic Sauce, Scallions; Crispy Walnut Prawns with Honey Glazed Walnuts and the Wok-Fried Soft Noodles with Assorted Seasonal Vegetables.  Everything was very tasty but nothing memorable that I need to have again.    Service was attentive and fast.  Typical Chinese quick cooking.  The waitress did misplace our credit card for a minute but we found it.    So overall a decent dinner.  Good view and good company but not worth the price.",

Starting w/the Golden Crab Claw, Wok Fried Flank Steak & Crispy Walnut Prawns.  The Golden Crab Claw & Wok Fried Flank Steak were delicious.  The Crispy Walnut Prawns were orgasmic!

The fruit salad it comes with is very refreshing and pairs well with the fried shrimp and crab. The second course is the coconut seafood soup which is served in a coconut. The soup is very light and has lots of mushrooms ( which is my favorite). The best part is scraping out the coconut meat once you've finished drinking the soup. Third course is the baked Chilean seabass. And the fourth course is the Sampan Maine lobster and braised Kobe short ribs. The short ribs just falls apart and is very juicy. The crispy garlic chips on top of the lobster were my favorite. The fifth course was dessert which was the purple sticky rice. It was light and not too sweet. The presentation of each course was amazing! And of course the view of the Bellagio fountain made it even better. The servers were very attentive and friendly too.",

The food is insanely overpriced, not traditional Cantonese, and mediocre at best.  Our dinner tab was over 800 dollars, and in Seattle, NY, SF, or almost any other major city, 100-150 dollars would have bought better quality, more authentic Chinese food.  We ordered 2 dim sum platters- mediocre and overpriced for 3 dumplings that were clearly re-heated. Hot and Sour soup for the table- not very good at all.  Lacked tofu and bamboo shoots and other traditional ingredients, very thin and brothy, lacking sour element. Chicken lettuce cups at the suggestion of the waiter- terrible, little or no chicken- all diced water chestnut.  God knows what they cost and they were much worse than PF Chang's- who by no means am I holding up as a golden standard for high quality, authentic Chinese. Ginger fried rice- not bad Broccoli beef- not bad Singapore style noodles (at suggestion of the waiter)- not good at all- no curry powder or turmeric at all. Eggplant- meh Stir fried Udon noodles- meh, no flavor or character General chicken- meh- not the best, but not great Walnut shrimp- there were 7 shrimp, and this dish was was probably 40 dollars.  Enough said  If you're in Las Vegas and you want Chinese food, do yourself a favor and hop in a taxi and head to spring mountain road, where much better fare can be found for much less cost.",

The whole crispy fish was competently prepared, moderately large, and tasty, especially with the spicy tomato sauce that comes on the side.  Unfortunately, nothing else was very good, and one chicken dish was absolutely bad -- undercooked chicken, yech!  Because its a relative bargain, and because of the spectacular view of the fountain show, I would go three stars on Jasmine, but there is nothing else to recommend it.  Update as of April, 2012:  At a second visit, we tried the Peking Duck.  At $78, it is a bit pricey, but you get a HUGE duck, carved tableside, and made into 8 overstuffed rolls.  Plenty for a main course for two, and delicious.  It earns Jasmine a fourth star.",

Chilean sea bass $39.  Excellent texture (almost like eating a butterfish) and flavor.  2 orders for 3 of us was too much.  Beef tenderloin (black pepper steak) $40.  Good.  Bok Choy $11.  Good.    Signature fried rice $20.  Okay.  Very mild flavor.  Honestly tastes like Panda Express fried rice.  General chicken $27.  Good.  Note that the dish comes layered with a lot of bok choy, so there was no need for us to order the bok choy as a side dish.  You'd think the waitress would've said something.  Asparagus $13.

Views consisted of the Bellagio fountain show every 10 minutes & serving stations with food manicured w/ more detail than Bellagio's stunning seasonal garden.  More food details... fresh seafood: King crab legs, fresh oysters, large shrimp cocktail, and sashimi. Dim sum for days, elegantly prepared American breakfast items, carving stations w/ every meat imaginable, and don't forget the desserts. There was literally a whole room dedicated to desserts w/ an attendant helping you choose the best way to get earn a cavity.  There is no better way to describe Jasmine's than Amazing.

I recommend reservations if you want prime window seating that overlooks the Bellagio fountain show. This restaurant is situated dead center of the fountains and runs every 15 minutes. So, A+++ on location and ambiance.  Their food is totally fresh and is constantly being replenished. Dim sum selection was small but, still provided enough of a good selection. Hey, If you truly wanted a full Dim Sum menu, you would've gone to Chinatown. Right? Remember, you're at the Bellagio. All of the items were delicious, as you would expect from the Bellagio. For you bacon lovers, they provide sliced bacon on request. Oh yeah, you heard me. You'll find it by the craving station along with prime rib, turkey and ham.  Their dessert room is off to the side. All of their desserts are made daily. Don't forget to select the variety of fruits and other dessert items to dip into their chocolate fountain. Also, ask their Pastry chef for what kinds of fresh ice cream and mochi ice cream they have available that day.  Service is top notch. You would think you're at a full service sit down restaurant. Waiters will constantly check to see that your drinks are filled and empty plates are taken away.  So, the next time you're in Vegas over the weekend, check out Jasmine's for a different buffet experience.",

Then when he was supposed to serve our appetizers he just brought the soup! Like wtf am I an idiot! This guy was like the magical act of the restaurant disappearing when we needed him and appearing when we didn't need him! Then he apologize later and give us some dry cake and fruits. Like how does that make up for this freaking mistake! At least apologize! It ruined what could have been a very nice evening! This restaurant is the worst Chinese restaurant I have been worse than Panda Express! At least they give you what you order! The food was shitty so was the service! Waited like 30 minutes for the food! Extreme caution!!! Bait and switch! Bait and switch!  If you want to get ripped off for 200-300 dollars go to the casino and gamble! At least you will have the satisfaction that Got your money's worth! Jackass! Do not go to this restaurant! Enter at your own risk! You will get ripped off!",

This place deserves a -10 I felt like I got raped after going to this restaurant  and guess what I had to pay $100 for it. The food tasted so bad and the meat was so tasteless . I returned one dish and even though they brought me another dish I could hardly eat it.  Don't get me wrong my fiance chinese and I do have chinese food often. This place just sucks.i had better food from a no name $7 a plate restaurant than this one.  To those you have left 5 stars review : you don't know chinese food. This place is anything but chinese. I have been to china and even unflavoured local food tastes better than this crap.",

Rating off those 3 factors alone,  I'd give it 5 stars. However, when I'm about to drop $150+ on dinner for two, I'm looking for the food to be equally high in quality and presentation. We ordered the \"lobster 2 ways\" appetizer, general chicken, and seafood fried rice (with alcoholic drinks). I'm disappointed to report that the food itself simply lacked flavor and quality. My husband and I agreed that we've both had better tasting Chinese food from strip malls. I must stress that the food wasn't BAD, it just didn't \"wow\" us- and in Vegas, there's no reason why you shouldn't be walking away from a meal of that price feeling \"wowed\". Hope this helps!",

    "text": "Visited Jasmine for Sunday Brunch over this past Valentine's weekend.   Overall, Jasmine has an amazing view of the fountains, but the food was hit or miss.  The Crab legs, Sushi, Tuna, and Oysters were fresh and excellent! The omelet station was as expected. The french toast with nutella was ok, and the dessert room was disappointing.   The Peking Duck was pretty good, but not carved tableside as advertised. The waiter simply brought out our \"allocation\" of one sample per person.  The pastries brought to our table were stale and not warm as advertised. Overall, I was very disappointed with any bakery, bread and dessert dishes at Jasmine, so if you enjoy bakery items I suggest you avoid this place because it was almost like they re-used pastries from one of their other bakery locations for the Sunday Brunch!! Very disappointing! I had the same day old bread experience when I grabbed a piece of cake from the dessert room. They do have vanilla, chocolate and mango gelato which was pretty good, and there are 4-5 toppings too choose from. (Heath Bar, nuts, Caramel, etc)  The meats were hit and miss as well. The Wu Xu style ribs were very good, and by far the best meat selection. The porchetta and other cuts of meat were average at best. I found most of the meats overall to be a bit overcooked.   Another surprise coffee and juices are not included. I understand the exclusion of champagne, bloody mary's and other alcoholic drinks, but come on people \"include coffee and orange juice in your hefty price tag of $58!\"  Honestly, I've experienced much better buffet's in Vegas, especially for the price.  Food and Ambience are 3-4 stars depending on the items, but overall value is 2 stars",

That's how good it was, I didn't even bother to go to the carving station (steaks, ribeye), I really enjoy the lobster Benedict -  it's moist and so flavorful, caviar on buckwheat- one heaven bite, Asian style ribs - it melts on your mouth, hamachi on squid ink cone - taste like summer! Those are few of my favorites, oh and of course oysters.... Yes oysters that is very buttery is a winner!!

It was nice and intimate, but the room did not have the view of fountains. We didn't even realize that the music from the fountains was being plugged into the restaurant and we just thought they were replaying their soundtrack. The beginning of the buffet starts with a cold station of seafood. I stuck mostly to their salads and sushi and was quite happy. I also liked the soup station. I haven't been eating meat but my friends seemed to love the hand carved bacon the most. Sometime during the meal they brought out Pecking duck on steam buns. There is also a dessert room that had beautiful desserts, that not only looked pretty but were also good. They also had fresh marshmallows freshly made chocolates, homemade ice cream, and a chocolate fountain all surrounding a giant chocolate sculpture. My favorite thing in there was the freshly made mochi filled with lychee ice cream.",

So my expectation may be different from a lot of Las Vegas Chinese locals.   Ok, compared to the pathetic and crappy Chinese food outside of the hotels, I would say this is much better. But as someone who is familiar with what quality & authentic Chinese food should be, I think food here is just mediocre. Do not come here because you want and are expecting fine Chinese food. Come here because you want a nice comfy setting with excellent service and edible Chinese food and because you don't mind spending some big bucks.  And if you are not an expert in Chinese food, I think you may find the food just fine. Afterall, I don't think this place is targeting authentic Chinese audience.",

All of the food was good to very good and the beef was perfectly cooked to medium as requested.  The salmon was ok but my least favorite and for the most part, the dishes were not particularly special.  The most outstanding dish, and a reason to return, was the chef's special szechuan roasted chicken which was moist with a crispy skin and deliciously spicy.  I've been eating chinese food for 30 years and never had anything quite like it.  The service was very good as one would expect from a high end restaurant.  I wish we'd had room for dessert.",

Sunday brunch was wonderful!  The service, food, view and decor made a wonderful experience for me and my husband (maybe not so much my husband as he would equally prefer chicken parm from a local pizzeria).  Sunday brunch is a buffet as opposed to the other times where this restaurant is a la carte.    I think I tried one of each item and there were a lot of items but they are portioned quite small so you can enjoy everything without waste and stuffing yourself to the point you have to rolled out.  The most memorable items were peking duck, lobster pot pie, lobster profiterole (yum!) and beef tartare in a cone (so yum!).  Everything was delicious but i liked these the best.  There was also a noodle bar which made me so happy :)     also a nod to the service, usually buffet service is non-existent but these servers made an excellent meal better!",

    "text": "An outstanding experience, but on the pricey side (with drinks and tip we were over $200 per person), 5 full stars.   Exceptional and authentic Chinese food with service on par with the finest steakhouses - our waitress always appeared instantly when needed, and then promptly vanished. We enjoyed a view of the Bellagio fountains performing every few minutes while we dined.  We began our meal with the Lobster Two Ways ($28.88) and the Dim Sum Basket Trio ($18.88). The flavors were perfect and delicately balanced.  For the soup course we had a special summer melon soup - to American tastes it was more like a squash - and the broth was flavored with a few large chunks of pulled pork. It was mouthwateringly good, and it's sort of unfortunate that our waitress was surprised both that we ordered it and that we liked it so much - apparently most Americans are unwilling to try it. We really didn't know what to expect when we ordered it, but it's always fun to try new things and in this case it was simply a home run dish.  Entrees included the Chilean Sea Bass ($38.88), Kobe Short Ribs ($48.88), and Wok-Fried Tenderloin ($28.88), all excellent as well.   I'm a bit perplexed that the overall rating is so low - it's certainly not an inexpensive place to dine, but flawless service and flawless food with an ambiance like this simply don't come cheap - especially in Vegas.",

Our vegetable fried riced was a bit off tasting of fresh egg, needed some more ginger to tone that down. It was quite overpriced considering it was a vegetarian dish, nonetheless the portions are big to share. The best part was the most amazing green tea creme brulee ever! The servers were awesome and even brought over a mini mouse cake to celebrate my birthday. Sarah the manager was very nice and made sure we received the best  treatment. She kept checking in on us and I found that to be quite impressive.  I will definitely recommend this place again as it is super romantic, overlooking the bellagio fountains and the view is stunning from the restaurant.  Oh did I mention the 200 dollar rosenthal versace plates. Yup! They are gold plated. You get a crappy plate to eat on by when you first arrive, those are used as display plates and are quite exquisite! If you want a great dining experience then here is the place!!",

The hostess, upon seating us, said the children were welcome but would need to leave if they started crying/fussing. It was a weird greeting but luckily our children behaved for the dinner.  The view is top notch - you really can't get closer to the Bellagio fountain show than from here! Decor is also elegant and romantic!  Food was good, although pretty overpriced. I didn't expect much since I have Canto cuisine all the time, so my expectations weren't high. I probably wouldn't order the sea bass again though (one small piece for $48!!!)

UNFRIENDLY service  That was the summary above for this restaurant for those of you who are like \"TL;dr\"  So we got here all excited because it has amazing views of the Bellagio fountain and wonderful deco. But then it took 30 minutes just for the kitchen to spit out our appetizer that is extremely tasteless and we had to ask for some salt...  15 minutes later, we got our main dishes and it is just as tasteless. KOBE beef? Bitch please, it's just regular beef, maybe even worse, I can't even chew it. Real Kobe beef that I've had in both NYC and Japan melts in your mouth!!   Szechuan chicken?! Even more WTF, it has NO taste, moreover the supposed \"Szechuan\" spice!   Our waiter was efficient, but was unfriendly -- never a smile, never a you're welcome to my thank you's. Then he had the audacity to come super close to my table and watch me give a tip (my biggest pet peeve...), so disrespectful!   Overall, the bill came out to $193 for 2 people with four dishes. YOU KNOW WHAT I CAN DO WITH $193?!! I CAN EAT AT A MICHELIN ONE STAR IN NYC. That's what I can do! But no, I wasted it on this shit they call food at this restaurant. So disappointed and apologies for the swearing/capital letters because I am so angry at this place. Bellagio should remove them from such a good location.",

The ambiance, the food, the service - it all complimented each other and I'l definitely looking forward to returning.  My only complaint and it is a big deal to us - the tables were so close together.  Not even a foot apart.  We were lucky enough to be seated next to a couple who were arguing about the wife returning to Vegas for a bachellorette party and the husband wanted to come too.  It was a lengthy conversation and we heard all the tidbits from him wanting to stay in the same room - NO - to staying in the same hotel - NO - to him getting mad and saying he was taking a guy trip on his own.  We didn't need to hear all that and neither did you but I want to express how long this went on and how close we were.    Fix the table issue Jasmine!  You would have gotten 5 stars if not for that.  If I could give 3.5 then that is what I would have given.",

There was a small group of us so we went family style with a couple of us ordering chef tastings/Pre fixe menu and a couple noodle dishes and a fried rice dish and shared them. Dinner for 5 including gratuity was $530.00, which is by far the most expensive chinese food I have ever eaten but we did have a couple bottles of wine and cocktails.",

The restaurant is decorated luxuriously with five star service. Sadly, the food was closer to a two-star.  Most dishes were too salty - ie. stir fried beef and prawn. I wasn't hungry enough to order rice, which would have balanced out the heavily salted dishes we ordered. I did enjoy my dessert though, iced mango bamboo. There was no actual bamboo except that the chocolate was shaped like a bamboo and filled with mango sorbet. It was phenomenal! I never had a dessert quite like this one - I would order this every time I come to Jasmine.   Chinese cuisine will never be my first choice when in Vegas, but Jasmine is a good option for a romantic dinner with the view of the Bellagio fountain show.",

With all the great dining experiences I had in Vegas, for some reason, Jasmine was the only place that made me think \"I can't believe I get to eat here\".   The prices are a little high for what you get, but you're paying for the experience. It's not everyday you get to eat breakfast with a front row seat to the Bellagio Fountains.  The menu is pretty traditional brunch;  Seafood: Alaskan King Crab, Oysters in a Mignonette sauce, Shrimp in a brandy sauce, sushi, smoked Salmon.  Meats: Kobe beef, Duck and Foie Gras, Ham, Slab Bacon, Rack of Lamb  Cold: Yogurt with homemade granola  Misc: Eggs benedict, berry-stuffed White-Chocolate French Toast, Crab Croquette, Pan-fried Chicken buns.  Dessert: A room dedicated to Chocolate Fondue, Chocolate Strawberries, Truffles and mini French Pasteries and ice cream.  Traditional items yes, but the quality is out of this world.   The only downside to this brunch was the dress code. It was kind of fun going here and pretending to be fancy. When you eat in a place like this, nestled behind the notorious Bellagio Fountains, you feel like only the most elite have ever had the pleasure of being in this room. However, the people cruising around between buffet stations in ill fitting short shorts, flip flops, and pool soaked tank tops remind you that this place isn't that classy.",

At the end, there are endless desserts - marshmallow/ strawberry Fon Du, special flavor ice-creams (i.e. mango, dulce chocolate/ caramel), and my favorite creme brulee! Everything is tiny portion, so you can try many different food! Totally fulfill all foodies' desires of trying everything.   My friend loved it and would want to bring friends and families when they visit Vegas from Canada!  Highlights: * I like their unique Kirfir w/ fresh fruits where it has some herbal leafs as to touch up such a fresh and light taste! Healthy!!  * Authentic Peking duck w/ buns * Many varieties ~ fulfill everyone's taste, not only authentic Chinese food, but combine with Western cuisine too!  * Nice fountain view",

First, they give you duck Peking style (wrapped), and then second they chop up tiny amount of duck with some kind of vegetable in a Chinese bread. THAT'S IT!!?

We were seated right near the window so had a gorgeous view of the fountains and the light show which made the experience so much more magical!  The food was absolutely delicious and there was definitely plenty to go around, which is sometimes not the case in upmarket restaurants. Highly recommend the beef ribs, vegetable spring rolls and the sweet and sour pork, all house favourites and can't really go wrong with them.

You go into a five star place you expect 5 star food or even a Mechlin star quality food. The shrimp was average supermarket quality and I could have cooked better at home for an $88 dollar dish. We ordered all the appetizers on the menu and we shared it around the table . Again everything was average and nothing WoW.  The service was great though and the atmosphere was great   It's a rip off and don't recommend.",

Sunday brunch is a very important meal in Vegas, it's one of the last memories that you'll have when your there so you might as well go out on a lovely high note.   We got a table facing the fountain of Bellagio and the weather was beautiful. The pictures from the website look a little formal but I really think that going to brunch has the best dining atmosphere..it's really great during the day.   There's so many things to choose from including -- prime rib / seafood / sushi / dim sum / noodle station / omelet station / and most importantly..peking duck!! I had three pieces and she told me I looked really happy..and I was!!   Super awesome brunch and a great ending to an amazing weekend :)",

Be sure to make a reservation, especially on weekends to get the time slot you want. The restaurant isn't that big so they fill up quickly.   My favorites: the chicken and corn chowder, mapo tofu, braised eggplant, live steamed goby fish, and the pepper filet bites. Really tasty! I don't recommend the fried rice because it is really tasteless surprisingly.   The price is a little steep, and definitely Vegas-priced so it is always smart to order family style and share all the dishes. Come by for a delicious Chinese meal!",

    "text": "Jasmine has now been added to the list of \"special\" Sunday brunches in Las Vegas.  More upscale than one of the massive buffets, with better service, decor, and quality (and a higher price point), Jasmine also has the benefit of location- situated directly in front of the fountains of Bellagio with floor to ceiling windows allowing diners to be treated to a show as they ate.  I wish that I'd been able to try a few more items, but what I did try was good. Not amazing, but good.  I enjoyed the shrimp dumplings, the prime rib, the Peking duck and buns, I LOVED the nutella and banana French Toast (no syrup necessary), and the shrimp, oysters, and mussels were very fresh and tasty.  I wasn't as crazy about the crab legs, and the lobster pot pie was not what I expected.  The lobster benedict was good, not great.  I didn't have an opportunity to try many of the Asian offerings or the omelette station.  The dessert room (yes, an entire room devoted to sweets), also didn't quite blow me away. There was a chocolate fountain with all sorts of items for dipping, as well as a variety of ice cream/sorbet along with plenty of little pastries.  I liked the creme brulle and the \"shot\" of chocolate cheesecake.   If I wanted to impress on a Sunday, I'd certainly consider Jasmine's brunch buffet. Hopefully, next time I will be able to sample of few more of their offerings.",

    "text": "Jasmine is an elegant, beautifully decorated restaurant with most seats having a great view of the Bellagio Fountains. Our dining table was centered and just one table away from the windows looking out to the fountains. Furnishings were sumptuous, with expensive fabric covering dining chairs. And, when Diane and I were seated, fresh red roses in a vase, along with colorful, Asian-themed serving plates, adorned our table. All food was served on fine china, and the silverware provided was of high quality. Restaurant Week menu selections were chosen for dinner, but augmented with soup. Overall, the food and service pretty much matched the ambiance and decor of the place.   An appetizer of Peking Duck Hand Rolls with julienned cucumbers and scallions inside rice pancakes was a fine start. Although the two hand rolls were small (about one-third less than most mu-shu I have previously consumed), the tasty meaty strands of warm duck inside and the best Hoisin Sauce I have encountered contributed to a great beginning course. The Hoisin Sauce was very smooth, redolent of the taste of plum, and just slightly spicy. I could have easily downed another two hand rolls! Nearby I saw two uniformed staffers deftly cut up a whole duck tableside to feed a party of eight with Peking Duck Hand Rolls. Only the preparer who handled pieces of the duck wore a white glove--and just on the hand that placed duck morsels on rice pancakes before they were rolled. The oily, defenseless duck didn't stand a chance!   A bowl of Lobster Dumpling Soup with potsticker-shaped Lobster Dumplings and spinach leaves and a few tiny mushrooms was presented with a delicate lobster broth that was extraordinary. Unfortunately, the Lobster Dumplings were somewhat hard, and contained little lobster. The small, round won tons in a cup of Cantonese Won Ton Soup that featured a good chicken broth with pork and beef were better tasting but not nearly the best in Vegas. I have enjoyed far better at China Mama, the Coronado Cafe at South Point, Dragon House, and the Victorian Cafe at Bill's. But, watching the fountains' water show from our second row seats while we ate enhanced our enjoyment of both types of soup.   Our entrees were of good size. Eight very large and tender Jumbo Gulf Prawns were served with tiny crushed pieces of Honey Glazed Walnuts over an orange-colored base of egg yolk. Much larger intact walnut pieces would have been preferable, but this main course was still very tasty.   Wok-fried Prime Beef Tenderloin with Black Pepper Sauce was served with a couple of shoots of bok choy and a large chunk of sweet potato that was suitably sweet. The ample lengths of well-trimmed tenderloin were very tender and cooked perfectly medium rare as ordered. The pepper in the brown sauce ladled on the meat was subtle but definitely present, because my lips burned slightly from it for a short period of time. Steamed White Rice was a little disappointing because the rice was of the short-grained variety. The addition of a few drops of first-rate soy sauce helped pull the beef and rice together.   A nice surprise was the Honeydew Melon Tapioca dessert that was infused with Honeydew Melon and included as part of Jasmine's Restaurant Week dinner special. It included Coconut Cream and Mango Sorbet, and tasted like melon-flavored cold farina. This tapioca was subtle and very refreshing. Complimentary Rice Balls and Fruitcake Muffins wrapped to go were brought to the table at the end of our meal.   Service was topnotch and almost deferential. Servers and managers stood by our table when we paid the bill and rose to leave, to bid us goodbye. This was a very fine 4-1/2-star Cantonese dining experience!",

Nutella banana french toast, also good, although nothing too crazy. The braised beef (some Chinese dish) - super tender and flavorful and moist. Gotta try that.  They also have a slab of bacon (and other meats), ready to slice for you. MMMMM. Desserts were alright, the watermelon sorbet tasted exactly like a watermelon.  And oysters!

I would pass on the veggie spring rolls but the kung pao chicken and veggie fried rice were amazing!  The kung pao was spicy but not unbearable and it had a good flavor as well.  The rice was delicate and flavorful.

We should have known by the emptiness of Jasmine that it was a sign for what was to come.   We were seated quickly and given menus. After a few minutes Paul came to introduce himself and take our drink orders. Since we have been living it up all day we just wanted some H2O. Paul offered sparkling or still. We opted for still. Before we knew it open bottles of Fiji water were placed on the table. Still water to me is good 'ole tap water but not here. After the 2 bottles were finished we requested tap.   For entrees I ordered the BBQ Szechwan chicken ($28.) and a side of jasmine rice ($5.) Hubs ordered the pork udon ($20.) he asked for a side of rice and Paul told him \"no, you don't need it with udon\". All of us were taken back and surprised he was told no. Maybe Paul is the rice natzi (like the soup natzi in Seinfeld).   The food took about 25-30 minutes. My entree was pretty good and spicy. The boneless chicken (you chose bone or boneless) but had a lot of chicken skin. The side of rice was served in a tiny cup. For the price it could have been a larger portion it is an inexpensive ingredient after all. The udon was good but hardly any pork given.   Prices are crazy expensive but keep in mind it is located in the Bellagio. The 2 small bottles of water were $8. each! That was $16. bucks for water. But what really got us irritated was that we over heard Paul asking the table next to us if they wanted sparkling, still or tap water. He never asked if we wanted tap. At the end we felt taken advantage of, along with Hubs being denied a side of rice just put a damper on our experience.   Next time we will not being coming here nor recommending it.",

I also highly recommend the hot & sour soup -- it's some of the best I've ever had.  Everytime I go I end up ordering multiple bowls of it!!    Basically, the food is great and the view from the restaurant is unbeatable.  It makes for a very romantic atmosphere.  The service is also impeccable; multiple waiters will make sure that your every need is fulfilled.    This place is definitely worth your time.

Prepared tableside with care.  I've had Peking Duck at a high end place in Beijing, and Jasmine met my already high expectations.  What stood out for us was the Sommelier, Sarah.  She was attentive, friendly, and paired an amazing Pinot Noir from Martinelli that went perfectly with the duck.  We quizzed her a bit and she really knows her stuff.  Thanks Sarah!  I will be back!",

    "text": "Very pricey but ordinary Chinese food.  Sweet and Sour Soup tasted as if it had come from a corner takeout but cost three times as much.  The same with other dishes we had like the spicey chicken, scallops, and beef with asparagus.  The only dish that stood out was clams.  That tasted great.  And the service was terrific, with the waiters hovering nearby and refilling glasses quickly.  Maybe this restaurant needed to dumb down the food to accommodate the wide variety of guests in Las Vegas.    Maybe we just ordered dishes that were too simple (other reviewers seemed to like the Peking Duck but we didn't order it).  Overall, Jasmine felt uneven:  the decor and service were top quality and white cloth, but the food was kind of like a neighborhood Chinese takeout.",

We did not make reservation but was seated pretty quick.   Two of us ordered daily soup, soupy dumpling, Chilean seabass and pea leaves. The daily soup was very good. I mean yes, you can make it at home yourself with time and fresh ingredient, but you would not get the service and music / fountain with you.   Soupy dumpling was ok (I am a shanghainese who is picky about soupy dumpling). The chilean seabass was the best I have ever had. So good, so tasty, so I dont know how to describe.   The service was good, but they made some mistake on our order so they brought the seabass and pea leave very late. It was ok, as we enjoyed the music and fountain view. The waiter apologized and gave us sweet soup and dessert for free.   I will definitely go back to this place again. Good food, good memory.",

While the price was a bit steep, we found each food item very tasty and memorable. I asked for a spicy prawn dish which they did not have on the menu. The server graciously said the kitchen would make one for me and it was wonderful. Others ordered mostly seafood and the food was excellent. The service staff was always there to assist us and make suggestions to help us have a good time. I recommend this wonderful restaurant in Bellagio for the food, service , and great view of the dancing waters.",

    "text": "I've eaten at the Sunday brunch here at least 5-7 times. It's one of the best buffets in town. The focus is not so much on variety, but rather the quality of food. This, matched with the view, is well worth your money.  My biggest problem, however, is with the service. It's quite lackluster. The servers take the initial drink order and you're lucky if they return again. During my most recent visit, we were not given any delicious Peking Duck or the fun tower of fruit/pastries that every other table gets. How are those sorts of things missed when you're at this nice of a place? It all just seems very uncoordinated and for the price point, I want to feel like I'm getting quality service.  Finally, I know this is minor but I also think it's a bit cheap of them to charge for sodas to begin with, let alone for refills. For $70+ tax/tip, can they not throw in a second Diet Coke?",

    "text": "I'm not an expert in Chinese cuisine, but I have to say that this was the best Chinese restaurant I've ever been to.  We tried the Imperial Peking Duck which was delicious. And they did 3 things with the dish I had never seen before: 1) The waiter sliced the duck table side 2) They wrapped the duck meat in paper thin flour wraps instead of buns 3) They took the some of the duck meat and stir fried it with some sweet potato as the second part of the dish  Our Garlic Lobster and Fried rice were perfect.  This restaurant also has a fabulous view of the Bellagio lake that features a water show set to music every 10 minutes.  BUT....as virtually everyone has already pointed out, the prices here are astronomically high.  Thank goodness I had some luck at the black jack table the night before.",

    "text": "This review is for the dim sum buffet.  Absolutely my favorite buffet in Las Vegas.  We stayed at the Bellagio after Christmas and it was very busy at all the restaurants.  So we wandered into Jasmine.  This is quite a step up from your ordinary buffet.  The room is beautiful with drapes, chandeliers,  tablecloths, china and silverware.  Best of all is a beautiful view of the fountains.  There are several stations with a chef serving you including the carving station, seafood, salads, soups, and crepes as well as a variety of dim sum and desserts. We had fun eating the fresh lychee fruit.  It was a relaxed and comfortable setting, no crowds.  Service was excellent.  My only complaint is that beverages are not included.  I think for the price at least they could offer some juice, soda or hot tea.  The good news is they offer a reduced price for children although I would recommend it for older children who enjoy Asian food.  I would definitely return.",

We were all so stuffed we had no room for dessert.  They gave us these weird balls of dough covered with sesame seeds with the check that were just not good.  They need to not give those out after a yummy meal.  Our waiter was terrible!  He was polite, but could not keep our drinks in order and could not understand us.  He was also MIA for most of our meal.  They were not busy, so this was no excuse.  All in all it was a good meal.",

It was the first time I tried a Cantonese cuisine that had a special touch only one could describe when try take their first bite. The waiters and waitress had made the restaurant a very welcoming environment. They were very friendly people who would help one at request and try their best to meet the expectations. At the end of the restaurant, guests could see the scene of Bellagio's famous water show! It was an amazing sight to see while enjoying one's brunch. The cooks were nice enough to bring some of the food made, right on spot to our tables, letting us enjoy our time eating. The only downside was the sign outside the door explaining the times were a bit confusing. There should be a separate sign that speaks to the guests about the brunch times. Other then that, the restaurant exceeded my expectations!",

    "text": "We went for the Sunday Brunch Buffet not knowing what to expect from an Asian buffet in the Bellagio.  The decor is quite elegant inside with a lot of white and mellow colors that work well with the overall sophisticated food presentation.  Together with the theme music to the \"Titanic\" they were playing in the background, the atmosphere was quite nice if you don't mind the feel of being at an elegant giant tea party a century ago.  And you can't beat having a seat next to the Bellagio fountains if you can get one, even though they don't start going off until the afternoon.    The spread was pretty impressive with good dim sum, breakfast, and pastry as well as a noodle station, meat station, and a huge dessert room.  Overall, when comparing this place to the Bellagio brunch, the Jasmine spread looks much better than it tastes.  Nothing was that memorable except for a few things: Wu Xu-Style braised short ribs, crystal prawn and spinach dumplings , chicken-apple sausage, and lastly the Peking-style duck in steam buns which is served one per customer.  If you really like chocolate, the dessert room alone might be a reason to go.  You can choose from ice cream, sherbet, chocolate fondue (including dark chocolate), chocolate-covered strawberries, and various cookies.  If you want just good buffet food, go to the Bellagio buffet because the taste is better and its cheaper.  But if you want elegant dining and beautiful food presentation (and you are a chocoholic) on a Sunday morning, the Jasmine is worth the experience.  The downsides are the prices, the fact that drinks are not included, and the overall unimpressive taste with some exceptions.",

Not only was the food being made fresh, but the food that was laid out was being refreshed/replenished almost every 5 minutes. I can't even name all the food that they had as there was just so much, omelette stations, raw bars with the best oysters, shrimp, lobster, carving stations, dumpling stations, and then to top it off a FULL ROOM just for DESSERT! this dessert room had fondue, cheesecakes, creme brulee, sorbets, mochi, ice creams, and much more! Another plus point was this restaurant is located in the Bellagio with ceiling to floor windows giving you a view to the AMAZING fountains shows that the bellagio is know for. Every 15 minutes, the music that is playing is the restaurant changes to what song is being played outside for the fountain so you can truly enjoy the fountain show with that particular song. LOVED IT, def will be back!",
