    "text": "Food trucks are sprouting up all over Las Vegas lately.  By my last count there are at least 10 now serving a wide variety of things from burgers to coffee.  The Slidin' Thru truck was one of the very first, if not thee first.  I have tried it twice so far.  The first time I tried a \"Barby\" and a \"YaYa.\"  I know, I know, you're saying to yourself, \"Geez, you ate two burgers?  What a pig!\"  You have to know that the place is called Slidin Thru, though, because their burgers are mini-burgers known as \"sliders\"  So I ate two but they are small.  I could eat 5 if I was really hungry!  Both of these burgers were very good and full of flavor.  I particularly enjoyed the \"YaYa\" which had a very unique flavor for a burger.  The second time I went, I just ordered two YaYa's because that was my favorite.  On this occasion, the burgers still had good flavor but weren't quite as juicy as the first time.  I don't know why.  A little dry for my taste but still good.  I would recommend trying this place out because you will get a hamburger that is quite different from the norm.",

I purchased food and saw my food sit on the counter as new orders were stacked on top of mine  3 more orders to be exact. The 4 orders sat for 4-5 minutes waiting on fries and as the orders were being called mine now on the bottom was called last order 96 as i saw her hand out 99 98 97 as i was asking for my order she ignored me as i asked her why it was waiting on the bottom WHEN I DIDNT ORDER FRIES!!!! I still had to wait for them because they were busy then the employee told me to shut up and refused to refund my order. With so much competition its not a great idea to blow off your guests!! Never again;(",

I'm a feta girl and this slider is heavenly !   *They got an A rating this morning from the Health District, good for them!  *Ric gets major points for customer service. We ordered some sweet potato fries. They were tasty but not up to snuff. I didn't complain as they were busy and honestly I was still eating them so who cares. Ric randomly called me over 10 minutes later and hands me a fresh bag of fries and says \"I noticed the first order I gave you didn't look so great - here's a better order on the house\". So there you have it. I didn't even complain but he's so on top of quality control he rectified the situation !    I love you Ric and your ridiculously good sliders !!!",

    "text": "I was excited and perplexed when I heard of Vegas' first gourmet food truck.  I spend a lot of time in LA and NYC and go out of way to find my favorite trucks and to check out new ones.  The slidin' thru truck is decorated very cool, comic-book panel-like.  I tracked it down in a Bank of America parking lot.  There were a few people there, but not many more than the crew I had assembled to meet up at the spot.  I was curious to see if the gourmet truck thing that has taken LA and SF by storm had a chance here.  This city is such a driving town, not many places where there is a high density of locals where a truck would be able to park.  Anyways...  they had a surprisingly big crew scrambling in the kitchen.  The truck was clean and appealing in design.  I couldn't wait!  Unfortunately I had to.  First, they were out of 2 of the 4 or 5 sandwiches they serve.  That was a bummer.  Once I ordered though the bummer got even bummier.  Took like 10-15 minutes to get the food.  There were more cooks back there than customers?  What gives?  My friends got there before me and ordered and were still waiting well after I arrived, parked, perused the menu and ordered.  Well, if the food is killer it's worth it, thought I.  Finally got the grub.  Looked good.  It wasn't bad at all, just not that great.  I'd rather drive through one of the many In-N-Out outposts than wait in an out of the way parking lot for just okay food.    Bun was a little stale.  Meat was seasoned well, but kinda dried out.  They obviously were sand-bagging patties back there, so why did it take so long for 3 cooks to put it together?  I really have high hopes for the slider truck and any future trucks who take to the streets of LVNV, but I just can't love it because I know how good it could be and  it wasn't bad, but there are lots of good fast-food burgers a lot more convenient and a lot better.  Give me a Fatburger any day over the slidertruck.  I hate to say it.  I really do, but this one was a definite \"meh\"...",

I got to the \"secret\" location, it was a well shaded place (good call guys...first time was majorly lacking shade), and I was about 15th in line, it took a while, but everyone was patient and anxiously awaiting their chance at the french dippers.  I ordered 3 french dippers, 2 porkies, and 1 barbie, I have to say the Barbie was solid, the french dippers were great (probably a little over hyped but still really good), and the porkies were AMAZING as usual.  I'm pretty sure I would shove my mother into oncoming traffic if it meant I would get my hands on another porkie or two!  Also make sure you tell them that Yelp has sent you, you will get a slider on the house, just make sure to review...and if you get a porkie I'm pretty sure you'll give it 5 stars",

    "text": "So I finally found some time to try the much praised Slider Truck.  Almost missed the  truck since I was expecting a large crowd, but thank goodness I caught a glimpse of it and there were no crowds!  The guys behind the counter were super friendly.  They were happy to help out with suggestions.  I ordered the Pep, Captain's, Caprese, and Yaya.   Unfortunately they had run out of the pulled pork.  I also got an order of my favorite sweet potato fries.  My sliders came first 'cause the cook forgot about my fires, but no worries since that just meant my fires were nice and hot!  When I finally got to try these mythical mini-burgers, I was definitely not disappointed!  They were tastey, so much so I literally inhaled the first three.  Seriously, I forgot how to chew, the sliders were that good.  The caprese was the most forgettable of the four, still very good though.  The Pep and Captain's were similar, both were very fresh, with the greens and tomatoes coming through.  The super sauce on the Pep came through nicely, while the feta on the Captain's was a nice addition to the texture.  My favorite however, was the Yaya.  For whatever reason, maybe because I slowed down and chewed, all the flavors worked well together.  The nice, hot and fresh sweet potato fries smelled incredible.  Sweet potato with a hint of cinnamon.  It was more of a dessert than a side!  My only regrets after my first visit to the Slider Truck, was that I did not order in multiples of three, since that is the most bang for your buck and they were out of the Porkie sandwich!  Other than that, it was a great experience: good food, friendly non-pretentious service, super casual atomosphere.",

Slidin' Thru was that perfect detail for us. Some of the biggest complaints about a wedding is always about the food, but that is one worry you can cross off your list is you use this company. The food is made to order for each guest so everyone gets what they want and it's hot when they get it. They use a numbered ticket system but it's not really too long of a wait...no one complained at our wedding. The company will even do custom orders like adding street tacos or the meal you ate on your first date to your menu! Also, if you are an Eco-friendly bride, don't forget to ask for their green serving containers. Easy to work with, EXCELLENT food! Unbelievably low prices! We are excited to hire this company for future events.",

I was skeptical of getting all excited and actually driving across town to go to a food truck . . . but it is worth the drive (if you are not lucky enough to have them come to a site near you).    I enjoy being able to have a taste of a few different types of burgers without the guilt of pigging out (that reminds me, try the pulled pork!).  The sweet potato fries are yummy.    Yes, we were crazy enough to bring our own table and chairs when grabbing some burgers in an office park parking lot . . . the food is well worth an impromptu picnic!  So, check their schedule and be sure to get there early (before the mystery burger of the day is sold out!).",

You can't.  That's how I felt when I last reviewed the Slider Truck. Except this time, the slider truck DID out-do itself. And it was awesome.   I popped in after my kickball game last night (we won 20-6...dont mess with pink) and saw a line. I remembered last time that the line moved a bit slow, but it was a hot day, the truck was still within its first couple months or so of existence and I was uber hungry.  This time, the line went by fast. I mean super fast. The efficiency of the Slider Truck brought a giant smile to my belly.  I ordered two pulled porkies and a yaya. All were fantastic. The Yaya was VERY good. Try it.  One very important note to share: I used my groupon. Instead of wincing at the thought of \"another cheap customer\", Ric was so gracious and was happy that I took part in this Groupon promotion. He could've easily given me attitude like many businesses do when you use a coupon/groupon or the like.  The level of service, friendly attitude and genuine kindness from all Slider Truck employees made me very happy.  As I move to Phoenix in a couple weeks, I really hope that my new city has food trucks. BUT, I have no problem coming back to Vegas to visit.",

Their schedule is posted weekly on their website and I suggest you get there early if you want to eat. My favorite is the Pulled Porkie. Hands down, the best pulled pork sandwich I have ever eaten. I also usually get the Barbie. Can't remember exactly what's on it, but dang it's yummy.

Now I wonder why someone didn't kidnap me and FORCE me to find ST with them! It's really good!  I recently had ST for the first time, at an UYE, no less, and fell in love with it in about 2.3890 nano seconds. The truck alone, like, the actual truck, is awesome. It looks like a comic book on wheels, but also one that puts out awesome food, smells like happiness, and is full of friendly people.   I ordered the Pulled Porky, as pulled pork has been one of my favorites ever since ever. I also ordered the mystery slider, as there's no way I could pass up a mystery sandwich. Will it have pork and lettuce? Turkey and cheese? Maybe even meat and three kinds of cheese?! In my particular instance, it was turkey, cranberry, cheese, some sort of green, and was quite delicious. I would love to ooohh and ahhh about how cool the mystery sandwich concept was, until my friend pointed out that it was just their special they had going on... something she called \"Thanksgiving in a bun.\" Still, it was a tall slider, and definitely a great bang-to-buck ratio.   As far as the wait goes... there was none. Granted the crowd wasn't massive, so maybe I just got lucky. But still. Even if I had waited 5 times as long, it would've been worth it for deliciousness served on the quick.",

My niece was flabbergasted by the \"little sammiches truck,\" and pretty much made me order everything on the menu... including a nice little surprise that wasn't listed! (Always ask if there is a special not on the list... you could be pleasantly surprised!)  I have two favorites... one being the Pulled Porky (listed as a specialty slider - limited time?) with jalapenos. Spicy and sweet - one of my all time favorite combinations - with a nice hit (slightly more than a hint?) of spice that gives a nice depth to the flavors. The Barby, another pork BBQ sandwich, is pretty amazing, too. Who doesn't love all of these flavors... with bacon?!  I also love the caprese slider (also listed as a special). The eggplant is a great \"meat\" and the combination tastes fabulous. Really fresh and lighter than I expected, it's a great summer day option.   The Yaya was a close second to the Pulled Porky/Barby faves... but this Greek gal is a sucker for feta and red onions. The vinaigrette has a great pop to it.  The Plain Jane is anything but. Maybe not a specialized combination/recipe, it is still done well and very tasty.  The fries are fries. Not bad, but nothing that made me think, \"Wow, they really did a great job by _________.\" They're fries, they're hot. They needed just a bit more salt.  Service is upbeat, personable and sometimes humorous. The truck and service areas are always clean and have everything you need to make sure you enjoy your meal to the fullest.",

    "text": "Managed to catch it at First Friday where I went just so I could try these mouthwatering morsels of meat, cheese and bread.  I even brought my friend from Nova Scotia to try them.  Between 3 of us we got 6 Pep Peps and an order of fries.  We were all so stuffed!! To look at the burgers you think you can eat a dozen but 2 were filling enough that we had to walk around for some digestive help.  The meat was juicy and delicious, the bacon crisp, and they put some weird sauce on it that I couldn't identify, when I licked it off my fingers it tasted very strange but when mixed with the meats, cheese, tomato, grilled onion and pickles was totally awesome.  The only thing bad is that it does take a while to get your food and there is no place to sit to eat but good food is worth the wait. I am going to have to program their routes in my GPS so I can have access anytime as I crave these tiny but filling burgers all the time now!!!",

    "text": "Wow, I guess people who go to this truck don't have tastebuds. After reading all the great review I decided to give it a try. I ordered 1 of every kind of slider they had. The pep pep was ok due to the toppings and all the sliders with burger on them were terrible. I bit into a barbie and didn't like the toppings so I took the burger out of the bun without the toppings and was amazed the hamburger didn't taste like a burger at all. The porkie was actually really good but unless you wanna waste your money stay away from the burger sliders. I don't know where they get hamburger that tastes like that and their buns are cheap and terrible also. The concept is great and the guys who run the operation look and act like a good bunch of people but their sliders need some serious work. You can go to any neighborhood sports bar and get better sliders rather than sit in line waiting with a bunch of people who don't know what good food taste like. Gimme a break people where are your taste buds? It amazes me that people are so excited over the concept that the terrible food they are serving up makes up for the actual taste of the food.",

    "text": "MAD LOVE for the slider truck.  What a great concept, I am so glad this place is getting the attention it deserves.  Finally we have a gourmet mobile restaurant!  The weekly schedule is posted on their website <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.slidinthru.com&s=222b59c633729fd0ec8e6727765781cdf5aa63f26d9203e31c5edd96795311be\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">slidinthru.com</a> and on twitter.  My fav is the caprese (grilled eggplant, mozarella, toms, basil, balsamic).  They also have a pulled pork slider, a beef one with tzatziki and feta, a bbq one with carmelized jalapenos, and a classic with cheddar, bacon and special sauce.  Supposedly they are going to start doing a chicken one too- fantastic news for me and my husband since we dont eat red meat!  Their buns are great and everything has a really nice smokey flavor from the grill.  They have regular fries, and really good sweet potato fries (tossed in cinnamon and sugar).  Only thing I wish they had is unsweetened iced tea, and I am looking forward to more chicken and fish specials.  Prices are reasonable, ingredients are high quality, and these guys (especially Ric) are total chillers.  There is always a line and your sliders are made to order, so be prepared to wait a couple minutes.   If you haven't been here, be sure to check it out.  I cannot give this place enough praise, mad props for a guy in his 20's acting on a really great idea- Vegas SO needed this!",

    "text": "My son and I came here after an amazingly, beautiful day outside at the Butterfly park. I checked out the Yelp Monocle app to find this burger slider joint around 10 mins away.  The concept of this restaurant is awesome! Live feed screens on the wall for Instagram, and Twitter updates using their hash tags, the modern paintings on the walls, etc. The one problem i had with this place was the cooks, and associates were all standing around, talking, and not checking on everybody in the restaurant and making sure to draw some nice comments or feedback from everybody eating their food, including my son and I. For a brand new business, especially one in the fast food industry, you want to be different, and by checking on everybody, and really caring about your guests means a lot, and goes a long way.  When ordering off the menu, I knew the name of the restaurant was \"Slidin Thru\" but it did not dawn on me that the quantity, next to the burger, on the menu was for the number of sliders that come with your meal. I thought it was the quantity of patties that came on each burger. It would have been nice to have been asked by the cashier/order taker if i had ever been there before, and if i had any questions on how to order. Not knowing any info on this place, i ordered a single slider, and left wanting more.   The burger that i had was really good! Balsamic Vin, Bleu Cheese, and Arugula on a slider sounded, and tasted delicious!  It was cooked perfectly, and the fries that came with it were also great! I will definitely be back, and this time i will know how to order.",

We tried the slider truck about 5 months ago and enjoyed it but weren't stoked about the 30 minute wait. This time, there was no line and we got our food within 10 minutes.  We split a YaYa, Pep Pep, Barby, Pulled Porky, and the daily special (a pork taco with tzatziki). We also split an order of plain fries.  Everything was very good. My favorite was the taco. The tzatziki was a very pleasant surprise in place of sour cream.  The last time we went to the Slider Truck we had the sweet potato fries. I have to say I prefer the plain fries. Don't get me wrong, the sweet potato fries are great, but I'm not a big fan of sweets. The plain fries had a nice balance of salt and pepper and were a great accompaniment to the sliders. Whereas the sweet potato fries were more of an after-slider dessert.",

My friend from work had been stalking the Slider Truck all week because they were going to be near our office.  Well, I had absolutely NO intention of going- until she came back singing their praises- and offered me one of her sweet potato fries.  After that, I had to go! They were crisp, yet soft in the middle, bursting with flavor and only intensified by the brown sugar on top. So much for the diet!  I got some cash, then went to wait in line.  It was probably a 20 minute wait from ordering till I got my food, but it was worth it.  The guys were so much fun, and gave you a fist bump as you walked up. They were pumping Wu Tang, and rocked the bus and blew the horn when you gave them a tip.   And the food...Reasonably priced, and delicious. I got the Barbie, which was my favorite (BBQ sauce,onion crisps, bacon, cheese), and the Captain's Order (balsamic vingerette, feta cheese, bacon), which was a close second. 2 sliders for $5.  The sweet potato fries, of course.($3) I couldn't stop eating them, and was tempted to put the bag to my mouth and eat the sugar, too.  I sat in my car  and scarfed everything down in shame.  Eight dollars well spent!",

    "text": "Last Friday they were behind Yogurtland on West Flamingo near the 215 from 6-9pm.  We got there promptly at 6 and we met a crowd waiting for these infamous sliders. The wait was about 35-minutes. Had we shown up closer to 7:00 we would've been better off the line was practically non-existent when we left.   We were greeted warmly when we placed our order, we each chose three sliders ($7) and we shared an order of sweet potato fries ($3). A short wait, later, we carried off our grub and we were anxious to dig in.  First up were the Barbie, Pep Pep and Yaya. The Yaya, with tzatziki and feta was our least favorite. The other two were quite good, but it was the Barbie, with carmelized jalapenos that we enjoyed most.  I like my sweet potato fries savory rather than sweet. So, it was unfortunate that the fries were dusted with cinnamon and sugar.  Next were the Captain's Order, Caprese and Pulled Porkie. From these, we liked the Pulled Porkie best. The Caprese was a nice veggie option, but it would have been better if the eggplant was more tender. The balsamic on the Captain's Order overpowered the other flavors.  If I happen to be hungry and at the right place at the right time, I'd try Slidin' Thru again, I'd order a trio of the Barbie, Pep Pep and Pulled Porkie.",

Waited another 5 minutes for regular fries to be swapped for the sweet potato fries I had ordered. On the plus side: the sweet potato fries were delicious, as were the Ya-Ya and Plain Jane sliders. The late arrival, plus getting swamped right away with orders, really set them back. Am deducting one star for the late arrival, one star for the long wait. However, I was offered a free slider to make up for the wait. Would like to give them another chance in the future.",

    "text": "Here is my breakdown when I had Sliding Thru (Food Truck) a few days ago:  FOOD:  Pulled Porky (slow cook pork, caramelized jalapeno, and bbq sauce) - this was my least favorite of the sliders.  I really wanted to like it because there has been some decent reviews on this truck but I think the biggest problem I had with this slider was that they didn't create a sauce that went well with it  - an aioli would have been amazing with it!!  Barby (beef, chedder, jalapeno, onion, and bbq sauce) - It was an okay slider.  The taste wasnt bad, but I think because of the way the slider was described (caramelized jalapeno and crispy onion strips) I was expecting a lot more.    Caprese (eggplant, tomato, basil, mozzarella, and balsamic) - by far my favorite out of what I ordered that day.  The eggplant wasn't sliced too thin and the overall flavor was good.  The thing that would have made this slider even better was to toast the bun ^_^ So you get that texture when you bite into it.    Fries - meh, fries are fries  SERVICE:   The staff was friendly but the wait for the food was rather long considering they came to an event and should have expected it to be busy.",

    "text": "Many things come to mind when I think fast food. For example: pesticide and growth hormone ridden, mass produced factory filler food, watered down and everything but tasty.  Slidin Thru is everything but, and is living proof that fast food doesn't necessarily have to be bad food.   Since it was my first time visiting the Sliding Thru truck I did what any newbie would do...order one of everything. Saying that they were just good would be demoralizing and not only be an understatement but a culinary injustice.  These sliders were outstanding.  I could sing the praises of every slider I had, however my favorite was the \"YaYa\" .  Now you may be asking yourself,\"whats a YaYa\"?  If a gyro and a hamburger had a baby, the \"YaYa\" would be the offspring, and a delicious offspring at that.  One beautifully tender, tasty, saucy edible baby....mmmmm baby.    This was also another first for me, it was the first time I've ever tried sweet potato fries.  Considering I don't like sweet potatoes, and when I say \"I don't like sweet potatoes\" it's just a nice way of me saying \"F U, you weird mutant orange nuclear sorry excuse for a potato thing ...WTF\".  With that being said I've never gone out of my way to give them a shot.  I'll be honest, I thought they were good, but I am a fan of a more traditional fry.  I felt the whole sweet and sugary thing was more of a desert than the salty, ketchup drenched french fries I grew up loving.   Now before you loyal Slidin Thru fans feel the need to mob up and march to my house waving torches and pitch forks, I can assure you I did truly like the sweet potato fries, just didn't love them.  Now hopefully you will all stop stuffing your gaping face holes with Woppers, McNuggets and other BS fast food alike and go get yourself some window love.  Here's to you SidinThru, you road bound rouge burger assassins fighting the good fight against bogus fast food.  The entire Southern Nevada region owes you their thanks for proving to them that fast food can not only just be good, but real good.",

Between the 2 of us, we couldn't eat 3 of them because they were so bad.  The buns were dry, old and stale.  The portion of ingredients didn't work well because the balsamic vinegar/reduction was too over powering for the cheese and tomato.  The first bite was met with the stiff bun, the cheese was not creamy, the vinegar taste punched you in the mouth and it lacked seasoning.    I'm sad to write this review because I had high hopes for this restaurant.  I've read so many postive things about the Slidin' Thru food truck and was really excited to see their success and expansion into a building.   I want to support local businesses so I'm not dismissing this place yet.  I'll just wait awhile before I try it again to see if they have heard their customers and are making any changes.",

    "text": "Here's the thing - I don't like the bread.  I like bread actually I love bread and when I'm enjoying my slider I need my bread to be soft & not too thick. The top part of the bread is just too thick. It almost remids me of how your bread tastes like when you open a bag of bread & don't seal it overnight. The next day it isn't soft and tastes a bit tough. Yeah, if the bread was soft/fresh I'd give more stars.  While making a stop at the Slider Truck on my way home one Wednesday evening I did mention to the dude at the ordering window that I'm not feeling the bread. He asked why and I told him that the few times that I've gotten a slider the bread just wasn't soft and didn't taste fresh to me. In his exact words he smiled and said \"NAWWWW\"  He did yell to the dudes making our sliders to make sure the bread is soft. The BF thinks because I complained about the bread that they most likely spit in our sliders- Gosh, I sure hope not.....  Well, the bread was the same as all my other visits so I'm not sure whats going on. It seems like I'm the only one who has a problem with the bread so maybe I'm a freakin Alien!!!!!  Anyhow,the inside of the slider is good. The Barby is our favorite- the Balsamic reduction really sets the Captain's order apart from the others-it has such a uniqe taste. The Pep Pep is our least favorite - taste wise it just doesn't compare to the other sliders. Our first time at the truck they gave us a bag to sample their fries,sweet potato fries and sweet potato tater tots. That was very nice of them and surprisingly my favorite was the sweet potato tater tots.   I do think that the special sliders for $5.00 is too expensive. It's like people who don't eat meat have to pay extra for the caprese slider but isn't the cost of beef more than the cost of one little slice of eggplant? I'm mean when all is said and done they may say that they put more stuff in the special sliders but it's still between 2 tiny slider buns.   The new Slider truck location looks like it's going to open up soon near my work fully equipped with a drive thru window that says \"WINDOWLOVE\". I'll go back and give them a try again but I just hope the bread improves.....  ** Wow, this is my first review with no pics- holy crap, I have been taken over by an Alien**",

    "text": "I have been a faithful fan of Slidin Thru ever since my co workers introduced me to them about two years ago. I always tried to pay a visit to their truck whenever they stopped near my workplace or home.  For the past 6-7 months, I noticed their truck don't make rounds to various area of Vegas like they used to, especially since they opened a restaurant in northwest and with a new one coming in southwest. I thought it's probably because their cooks now work in the restaurants.  Fast forward to recently, I finally got a chance to try various sliders that they make a few days ago and were surprisingly disappointed. Their juicy delicious sliders are now replaced by their stale buns and dried patty. Their customer service kinda lost the friendliness that I used to see from them.   Anyway, I thought I was just being judgmental and sensitive, but base on some recent unhappy reviews from my fellow yelpers, I guess I wasn't being oversensitive or over negative.  I hope Slidin Thru reads reviews from here and realize that they shouldn't ignore or abandon the fan base that used to drive out of the way to eat their sliders and supported their business.",

All of the other reviews praising this truck are absolute truth and there isn't a whole lot more that needs to be commented on.  All I can say is that I've been following the slider truck on twitter for quite some time and would follow this truck to the ends of the earth for a Barby slider. It's a succulent mini burger topped with melted cheddar cheese, carmalized jalapeno, barbeque sauce, fried onion crispies, and bacon.  When it comes to the Vegas food truck scene, Slidin' Thru is king and all other trucks are just members of the court. And while I do like to have a romp with some of the other food trucks now and then for variety, Slidin' Thru can be sure that I'll always be coming back home to them.",

Pretty much it takes everything that is awesome from the truck (quality, atmosphere, fun, value) while getting rid of the things that often annoyed me (30-40 minute waits, d-bags cutting in line, no real place to sit down and eat).  I will always and forever be in love with the porkie, it is one of the cheapest sliders on the menu and for few bucks you can get the combo pack.  I love their god tier fries, I really can't find a way to nitpick.    The only gripe I could see from other people would be that the location is kind of way NW Vegas, but since I live close to the area, I am fine with the location.    You'll definitely will see me here in the future.  #WindowLove #SlidinThruMyHeart #HappyPanda",

    "text": "Not great...not even good.  Ordered through the drive-thru; the first window was closed, so I drove to the second.  No menu, no idea what there is to order when the guy asks what I want.  I remember that there were fries with feta cheese and balsamic vinegar, interesting, so I order those and the guy suggests the Pep Pep.    Now I wait.  I understand that it's freshly prepared, or so says the sign next to me, but come on if you are going to do a drive-thru the service needs to be speedy.  The order takes so long, I'm asked to pull up so the guy can get the order from the 1 car behind me.  Really?!  If it takes so long to make the micro burger and fries with goo on it how are you ever going to make a profit?   The guy finally brings my food and I drive away.  I get home excited to try something new.  The slider is dripping grease (so much for gourmet) overly covered in some orangish sauce that tastes like Thousand Island minus the relish, the meat patty is half burned.  At least the sandwich was still warm.  Now for the fries, feta and balsamic on fries sounded like an appetizer from a super fancy restaurant.  I'd love to say they were amazing and made up for the crummy $3 slider, but when I opened my fries they were covered in the same disgusting sauce as the slider, bland caramelized onions (how these had no flavor I'm not sure), plastic cheddar cheese that had congealed beyond edible (how the cheese could be hardened and the fries still relatively hot is beyond me) and bacon.    So sorry Slidin' Thru, no home run for you, you struck out on the first try.  No way will I try this again when a crappy meal cost over $7.",

    "text": "Slidin' Thru owner Ric describes his 'Slider Truck' as 'Vegas' first and only premier mobile restaurant, serving gourmet sliders made from the freshest ingredients.' Using social networking platforms like Twitter and Facebook he is able to let his customers know where he'll be parking for lunch that day, or if there has been a last minute change to the schedule because he's been booted from his post. His truck has already become the talk of the town and he's only been open since Spring, so plan on a line when you come. His colorful comic strip ride is fun to look at while you wait, but if you try to stay out of the sun when its 100 degrees out, I'd suggest coming after summer. At one point my husband and I had been semi serious about starting our own food truck, but the realization we would be in a confined space with limited AC and a flat top in the middle of summer stopped us dead in our tracks. I give Ric and his crew major points for facing this challenge, so I suppose the least we can do is wait a few minutes for a few of his tasty creations.    The day I faced the heat I tried the Pep Pep, the Yaya, and the Pulled Porkie, of which the latter was my favorite. The pork was tender and not shredded to death, and the tangy, spicy barbecue sauce bathed it well. The caramelized jalapeno was a nice touch. The Pep Pep was good but ordinary, something like an In-n-Out Burger with a special sauce moving more in the direction of tartar than Russian. Ric also adds crispy bacon to his. The Yaya, a Greek inspired slider with feta, red onion, tomato, and taziki felt healthier than it was on account of the sharpness from the white wine vinaigrette dressing the lettuce. The flavors are great but perhaps lamb for the meat instead of angus would have been better. I can understand the constraints on using more expensive proteins, however, because his sliders are very affordable. You can get one for $3, two for $5, or three for $7. I would be willing to try any of his other sliders, but next time will pass on the limp sweet potato fries, $3. They're tossed with cinnamon and sugar, which I believe would make for a better seasoning if the sugar were replaced with salt. The sweet potatoes offer all the sugar you need, and if that's still not enough then you can munch on the whimsical fun pack of skittles Ric puts alongside your sliders.  It seems the young people starting unique food businesses in Vegas are favoring burgers. I'd much rather have these businesses than not, but it would be great if someone could come out with something a little different. Hopefully this is just the beginning of the food truck trend in Vegas and the next mobile chefs will explore other possibilities for fun, fast food. I have no doubt that Slidin' Thru will be able to hold onto the burger market for years to come, but there is still plenty of room for mobile catering growth. I look forward to seeing what kind of food truck comes next!",

    "text": "I decided to check them out based on a piece on the news, plus I got a coupon via  text from the web site.  I think it was for 1 free slider.  So I showed up, ordered 3 captain's orders.  First off, I think for 3 little burgers it was(I think) around 6 dollars.  I paid for 2, with one free.  Even that I thought was overpriced.  The burger itself was pretty good, better tasting than your average fast food burger, but for the price, too much.  I'd rather get a Double double meal for the same price(burger fries and drink) for the price of my discounted sliders.  Of course generally you have to drive to wherever the truck is if you feel like getting the food, which is also a bit of a pain.  Lastly, I paid for 2 sliders and I got back change as if I bought 3....generally I trust vendors, plus it was hot and i wanted to get in my car, eat, and go...really didn't feel like driving back for the correct change.  Update 12/7/2010 :  They have definitely made things much better in today's economic climate.  The addition of random dollar slider happy hours, in this reviewer's opinion, has made the usually long trip to their truck, much easier to swallow.  Just need to keep watch for texts from them that you sign up for to get these specials! Bravo :)",

Thankfully we got there early enough that not much of a line had formed yet. I already knew what I wanted.  I had been contemplating it after reading so many reviews.  I ordered the Barbie, Pep Pep and the Pulled Porkie. I also got an order of french fries and a plain slider with ketchup for my son. I have to say that they were some of the yummiest sliders I've tasted yet.  The Pulled Porkie was definitely the favorite but the others were really good. too. My son even finished his.  The fries were nothing special but were cooked just right with a good amount of crisp.  I'll be on the lookout for the awesomeness that is the Slider Truck.

    "text": "After a day of walking with the wife and feller Yelpers at the AIDS Walk in downtown Las Vegas, we all got a chance to eat from the Slidin' Thru truck.  This ingenious group of 3 guys who graduated from the CIA of Las Vegas decided to open their own business, riding on a popular trend of food trucks serving unique foods that was sparked up in the Los Angeles area.  My past experiences on these trucks were pre-made sandwiches, and tacos al-pastor (one of my favorites).   This truck only focuses on one type of food product...sliders.  Ricardo was one of the fellers that took our orders and told us about the food and their business.  That day the menu was limited to only three selections: the Pep-Pep, the Barbie, and the Pulled Porkie.  The wife and I decided to order all 3 choices and double up on the Pep-Pep.  My eyes could not stop gazing at the 4 sliders piled high with generous amounts of meat topped with light brown toasted puffy buns.   The Pulled Porkie was filled with layers of stewed juicy and tender pulled pork.  For the other burgers, I wanna say about  to 1/3 lb amount of ground meat cooked to about a medium, so the meat was very moist.  The Barbie was a burger that was covered with cheese and bacon , but was overpowered by the bbq sauce.. The Pep-Pep is what I wanted to focus my taste buds on  because it is the classic burger, the most simplest of them all the menu.  If someone can't make that right, then they don't know what they are doing at all.   The verdict: the Pep-Pep was completely amazing.  When I sunk my first bite into this burger, my mouth felt the texture of the soft toasted bun, then the gooey cheese, and crispy thick bacon, and finally the moist burger.  My mouth lit up because I could actually taste how well seasoned the meat was and how the homemade thousand island, salty bacon, pepper-jack cheese, the lettuce, and tomato completed the whole slider, nothing was overpowering.  Since then, I have came back for more of the Pep-Pep, and looking forward to try the new items.",

When I asked for ranch no one seemed to know where it was and there was a delay in finding me a small cup of ranch  I am not sure if their cash register does not allow them to group sliders for each dinner or if the cashier just failed to enter our order properly, but we had to examine each slider in the baskets to figure out which slider belonged to which dinner.  The decor was unique and modern but was ruined by the constant yelling of the staff.    As for the sliders, the beef sliders were dry and overcooked and had a small, tall round portion of meat in the center which meant about half the bites of slider were not enjoyed with meat (there is a reason White Castle has thin square patties that cover the entire bun).  The meat on the porky was dry and seemed like the meat was a Sysco or similar frozen product and not prepared on sight from roast.",

They are @ UNLV on Mondays so I know every Monday what I am having for lunch. I like the slider's because they are small and I don't get disgustingly full, just right and the sweet potato fries are superb! Love the pork slider, but I like to switch it up and I like the variety! Yum",

And just like Misti said..u get a fist pump from the nicest guy working there. I order the Pep Pep and was surprised at how juicy it was. And the sauce that they use is amazing and they don't drown it either. It was just right! The hubby had to do a special order cuz he is a bit picky and they had no problem with that. He was thrilled they made it perfectly. He ate them all! We had sodas from them to wash it all down. I love that they have the retro glass bottles! We are gonna try to hit them up weekly since there are so many more I want to try.",

    "text": "I really wanted to love this place, given all of the wonderful things I'd heard, but unfortunately it just seems to be another over-hyped novelty that doesn't stand up.  I've been twice and sampled as many burgers as possible to be sure it wasn't an off night, and haven't found anything to recommend.  Now, I've only been to their brick and mortar location, and have not sampled directly from the food truck itself, but it doesn't sound like there is any difference.    The wait is unreasonably long, nothing I have tried was piping hot and none of it tasted as if it were made fresh to order (other than assembling the burger and toppings).  I was also a little surprised by the prices.  They are quite high, but would have been worth it had the burgers been phenomenal.  The bun to meat ratio is way off.  The top bun is way too thick (or the meat is way too thin).  I also agree with some of the other reviewers about the dryness/staleness of the bread.  Each time, I ended up picking off about half of the top bun because it was so thick and dry.    The toppings I have had are bland and get absorbed by the bread, and the meat itself has no taste.  McDonald's makes a more flavorful \"special sauce\".  The sauce on my burger had less flavor than plain mayo.    The only highlight of the meal were the bbq fries (with jalepenos, bbq sauce, onion strings, bacon).  Despite being shoestring fries, they were crispy enough to hold up under all of the toppings and were quite yummy!    Unfortunately, some decent fries aren't enough to bring me back again.  Overpriced, overhyped, and underwhelming.",

I get my occasional cravings, but nothing to his extent. The Pep Pep and the Pulled Porkie are my favorites. I've tried everything but the Captain's order. Everything is delicious. They also have Mexican Coke's! That is ALWAYS a plus for me. If you're not wanting to wait in line, get there 40 minutes early, and get in line. You won't have to wait long if you're in the front or close. Otherwise, don't go hungry.",

I love that your employees seem to enjoy their work which is awesome.  I also love that you have improved your french fries - they were great! But..... Your sliders weren't up to their normal awesomeness today.  I went in expecting to love it as much as I always loved the ones I got from your truck.  I dragged along a friend that \"doesn't do food trucks\" fully expecting her to be blown away by how good your stuff is.  And, well, lunch was just OK.  Aside from the yummy fries the two sliders weren't as special as usual.   I hate making that comment without constructive details, but I am not entirely sure what was different.  I ordered my two favorites - Porky and Barbie, and they were just Ok.  I will be sure to check back in a few weeks and see if you have returned to your normally wonderful self, but I am not sure that friend of mine will be willing to make a repeat visit. Best of luck to you, please don't grow so fast you can't keep up the quality you started with.",

    "text": "I'm use to the Slidin Thru food truck and I love them.  I been to the Slidin Thru HQ and found it kind of small, but still love them.  Now Slidin Thru NW, got to say its a bit of a change on pricing, but WAY better than HQ and still love them.  Reading some of these other reviews and trying to compare the food truck pricing to the restaurant.  I'm sure some of these people can take the time to understand, running a food truck vs running a restaurant is two different things.  I understand that they offer certain amount of sliders for a certain price.  But trying to maintain a restaurant, you have to put the price somewhere, to keep the business open.  Maintaining a food truck is probably easier, than maintaining a restaurant.  So I understand where the pricing in the restaurant is a bit more than the food truck pricing. Plus you got limit amount of items, unlike other restaurant that has a few dozen items.   Either way, I respect Slidin Thru.  Other than pointing out the difference and seeing where they have to make those changes, for them to run the restaurant. I still give Slidin Thru much love and respect.  Coming from a Food Truck to a decent size restaurant, and still maintain the food truck, is a big accomplishment.   I applaud them for that.    Slidin Thru is located on the corner of Durango and Centennial, right behind 7-11,  It's bright, and very creative and of course you always get that warm feeling.  Either from the color scheme or the energetic staff.  They will make you feel that you matter.    I've been here a few times, and always order the Pep Pep and Barby Fries, which I believe is amazing.  I just love the mixture of flavor they put on the Barby Fries.  I always wanted to try the sweet potato smore's, but with the Pep Pep and Barby fries, they tend to be my favorite.    I like the fact that they have a drive Thru, where you can order and go.  I do like going inside to order, just to feel that energetic atmosphere.  That right there, shows that these people have some kind of spunk and love what they do.    If you love the food truck of Slidin Thru, you'll love the restaurant.  I'll admit that the pricing may differ from the food truck, but remember, maintaining a food truck differs from maintaining a restaurant.  You still get the same great taste and the same great energy from the staff.  But at the restaurant, you have that luxury of driving thru or dining inside in a nice and unique atmosphere.",

Also really good - way spicy so beware. Before we left my daughter asked for a toy out of the little machine.

These gourmet sliders are perfectly sized and seasoned, toppings are total nom! Today was a repeat of Captains Order (because I LOVE the balsamic reduction) and the YaYa (because I'm a fetaholic and the white wine vinaigrette is the bomb), but also ordered the PepPep and Pulled Porkie for my mom, she loved the flavor combos, and the caramalized jalepenos were scrumptious! My son had a plain jane, my husband had a Eggplant Caprese, PepPep and a YaYa. Sweet potato fries are yummy with a light salting to compliment the cinnamon dusting. Today i ventured to the far west side to satisfy my craving for balsamic reduction, and to beg them to come to the north east side! Get some window love!!",

That taste cost me $7.03 with the tax. I told my son I couldn't believe I just spent $3 on one slider and $3.50 on the other when I never spend that much on a large burger anywhere else.  He added \"Six Mcdoubles would have cost less.\" Their prices should be -get two sliders for that price. They would get a heck of a lot more business because the sliders are tasty.

    "text": "I am obsessed with the Slider Truck. OBSESSED! I've driven clear across the Valley to get my MINI BURG on.  Yes, there is a lonnng wait sometimes, but it is worth it. The guys blast fun music and are shouting funny things. The customer service is awesome. They guys are super nice and will most definitely put a smile on your face several times over.  Now, to the food. The sliders are made to order, so yes you have to wait to order and you have to wait for them to cook. It's usually a much shorter wait than the waiting to order line.  My favorites are the Barby, the Pulled Porkie, and the Caprese. The former, is Slider Trucks take on a BBQ Bacon burger. The guys add a piece of crispy bacon, crispy onions (think green bean casserole onions), and carmelized jalapenos. The BBQ sauce is sweet and tangy. It's just the right amount of messy. I crave this mini burg more than any other mini burgs. All hail the BARBY! The Pulled Porkie is the best pulled pork sandwich on the planet. I am pretty sure it;s just tender pulled pork, caramelized jalapenos, and  BBQ sauce (different than what is on the Barby). Just try it. I guarantee it will melt in your mouth. Lastly, for a lighter option (not in calories), but for a more simple, fresh taste I opted for the Caprese. Tender grilled eggplant, fresh mozzarella, roma tomato, basil (my most favorite herb) and balsamic. It's a mighty vegetarian option and it has a delicate taste. This slider had pizazz.   Now, let's talk about a real American delicacy, the French fried potato. Slider Truck gives you two options, traditional and sweet potato. The traditional are great. Crispy and evenly seasoned. I live for, yes, live for the sweet potato fries. They serve them up with cinnamon and sugar, you can ask to have them salted (as I have seen many Yelpers complain about). They season their fries once the fries are placed in their carryout bags. Go for the sweet potato fries, I promise you won't be disappointed.  Drink options are limited, but excellent. There is Mexican Coca-Cola (made with REAL sugar verses high fructose corn syrup), Orange Fanta (also with REAL sugar), and Smart Water.  Some additional things that I love about the Slider Truck are: 1. How awesome the guys make you feel. 2. They include moist towelettes in all orders. 3. Fun-sized candy with your order. (FREE DESSERT) 4. If you leave them a big tip, they TIP the TRUCK! (Actually the rock it!) 5. WINDOW LOVE! (Fist bump, y'all) 6. If you follow them on Twitter (@slidertruck) or sign up for their text alerts (via their website <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fslidinthru.com&s=60d9913d6b1b74de419029af22d7ea73c6095588fd57b39f8b451ae2c4718501\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">slidinthru.com</a>), they have HAPPY HOUR where everything on the menu is $1. (On these days get there ASAP because they sell out  FAST!) 7. It's Winter now and they have been giving out  FREE hot cocoa out, while you wait.   My only beef is that they don't take credit/debit cards.  I love the Slider Truck, check their weekly schedule and see when they're in your neck of the woods. I guarantee you will leave happy, satisfied, ad with a smile on your face.",

Tried the Barby and Pep Pep both were terrible!

Yes, the music is a little loud on the inside, but the staff is friendly and the slider's are tasty.  I loved the sweet potato fries and the simple but tasty Plain Jane.  I can't recall the name of the Chix slider with the battered onions, bacon, hot sauce and other dressings-but that is a go to.  Be prepared to bust out the cash, because it ain't cheap--one slider is not enough!

Now that they have a standing location in the NW near my home, I thought I would give it a try.  Yes, it is a little pricey for sliders.  In their defense, they do use some premium ingredients and the little sliders are more filling than you would expect.  The menu selection at the restaurant is an expanded version of the trucks original.  They have beef sliders, a pork slider, and even a couple of chicken sliders.  They have regular fries and sweet potato fries in plain or several other variants.  They have a soda fountain and sodas in old fashioned glass bottles.  It is all pretty much a standard burger stand.  It is both retro and modern at the same time.  The staff is great.  They have fun with their job and it shows in both their attitude and product.  I love them.  I give them four stars (truly 3.5) because the sandwiches I got in the restaurant were not as good as from the truck.  Less sauce on my porky.  Jalapenos that were more fresh than caramelized.  It also took a little long to get my food.  I like this place.  I really do.  I plan to visit again.  I just can't give them a perfect score yet.",

The menu looked so great we ordered one of each!  They also made some custom, cheese & lettuce sliders for the kids. My favorites were the Kalbi Rib, Captain's Order, and the Barbie. But I do have to say the veg one was also a winner.   The buns were a perfect match, and they were grilled to perfection.     This was the best (and by far the cheapest) meal we've had in Vegas (this certainly blew away the crappy lunch buffet we had on the strip). I've had sliders at many different restaurants around the country, and these were by far the best!",

Unlike Most things in vegas that become trendy, then become over-priced & Commercialized, This truck has heart. They dont kill you on price just because they have a great product, they Love what they do & it shows! And they Give Back too, They catered an event for us, to help raise money for Breast Cancer! In A city that has gone soooo Corporate, this is the \"new Vegas\" style of business.     Now to The Food, You Will Not Be disappointed, Sliders made with Quality, There Mystery Sliders are always testing the boundaries of how extreme a slider can be! The \"Captains Order\" & \"Pep Pep\" are 2 of my Regulars, add an order of the Sweet Potato Fires & im in slider Paradise! The Food Is Cheap, the Quality is High, The Vibe is perfect. This Is A Vegas Must Try!!! Also Check out there 24hr HQ, For Late Nite Fix!",

I stood in line in the Costco parking lot on MLK for 20 minutes anticipating for my turn to order.  I have no problems waiting for good food.  If the food is good, I'm willing to wait it out.  I like my food hot, fresh and yummie.  The sliders were hot and fresh but the quality went downhill.  The pulled porkie was the same but I think the quality of their ground beef and other ingredients went downhill.  I was so so disappointed.  I really like these guys too.

    "text": "I've eaten off their truck before and liked it, so we we're excited to finally make our way to the restaurant. Upon entering we were greeted. The staff was nice enough and helpful but that was about the only good thing about our experience. I didn't care for the loud horrible music playing in the dining room. Waiting for our order we picked a table, all of them were dirty, there were 2 other tables with customers. They locked the front doors while we cleaned our own table. We thought that was weird. It was cold in there so I asked my hubby to grab my jacket out of the car, when he came back he said there was a car parked blocking their drive thru and wondered if they were closing. It was only 3:30, I had checked earlier to make sure they were open today before we made the drive over from the SW, and the hours said open Sundays til 9pm??? We got our food in good time, we got the Pep Pep, Barby, Captains Order, Plain Jane, Mystery Slider, and Pep Fries. So the mystery slider felt like they just threw a bunch of random stuff on a bun, chicken, mozzarella, pineapple, crispy fried onion strings, and some sort of hot sauce...it was tasteless. All of the sliders were dry and tasteless...the buns were stale, dry and crumbly. The fries were about the best thing which doesn't say much, you can tell they are frozen. This was one of the worst food experiences I've had in a while. BTW they placed a sign up in their window saying they closed at 3:30 pm to spend time with family, while we ate. We told Nick (name from receipt), our host, that we didn't like the food, it was dry. He was surprised, wanted to know if we wanted something else. Doug chocked down all the food cause he was hungry, and I wasn't about to eat more bad food, so we said no. Outside as we were leaving, 3 cars had to turn around out of the drive thru because they had closed early. Maybe Slidin Thru made enough money last night at Vegas Streats that they don't need to worry about it. I'll try the truck again but I won't waste my time and money at the NW location.",

    "text": "\"SPRINKLERSSS!!!!\"   Huge turn out yesterday as the line stretched across the open grass area.  The longest I ever witness, but i knew had to stick through with it because i came here strictly for the Frenchies.  Brought a buddy of mine too to accompany me. I knew he'd be down to wait even though we found out from another sliders groupie that the wait time was over 45min and the guy still had not received his order yet. All good though because the scenery was pleasant since Ric posted up in front of a pond in The Lakes, so the weather was rockin' cooler normal.    Good crowd although a few were agitated, but for the most part everyone didn't seem to mind the wait because we, the supporters, knows how the crew operate.  BTW Special shout out to the crew in the BOT ('back of the truck' instead of house).  They busted their ass off to feed off us massive followers.  I don't think they were ready for a tremendous crowds like that to show up that day, but what did they expect when one of their most highly anticipated special slider was broadcast for a another debut?  On top of that the location was kept secret until they released it a 2hrs before, so i can totally understand some people frustrations. Everyone wanted a piece of it!    I; however, was blessed since i rolled up with my homie so we just hung out and talk, and even more lucky that we got the last 2 Frenchies! :X  Yeaaaaa booooyyy!  The Frenchies were awesome! The Au Jus really set the tone for the slider.  The sliced roast beef was a tad bit dry on its own, but since it was layered with cheese and more roast beef i thought it was executed very nicely with the Au Jus of course.  Would I go back for more with that wait again?  Depends on my mood :P   My buddy said it was \"hella worth the wait!\" He's a big fan now.  He loves the Pull Porkie and the concept just as much as I do.  By now you guys know it's first come first serve, so try to get their early.  If not they have other great items that you can try on their menu. Although I'm giving 4 stars this time, i still got nothing but mad love for slider trucks.  They need to build a storage unit above the truck or hook up a walk in trailer to the truck ;P  PS.  Remember where there's grass, there's sprinklers around too, so don't forget to equip yourself with smoke bombs and ninja boots.",

    "text": "I caught up with the Slidin' Thru Slider Truck today at the park near Flamingo & Buffalo.  They had a \"tasting menu\" going (none of the items on the regular menu were available):  1.  Kalbi rib slider 2.  Beef & cheddar slider 3.  Mac & cheese slider  Unfortunately, the Mac & cheese had already sold out by the time I got there (around 1pm).  I ended up with two of each the others, at $3/per.  I've posted some cell-phone pics of my order for everybody to check out.  The Kalbi Rib slider was served on a lightly grilled bun about 2.5-to-3 inches in diameter.  The boneless beef rib had been prepared in a shoyu/garlic/ginger marinade (nice!) and topped with some grilled cabbage which gave some crunchy texture contrast.  The protein was a bit toothsome, but nothing that would turn you off... actually  I remember thinking that the substantial bun was well-paired with the chosen internals.  Overall, I was digging the Kalbi sliders...  I wonder now if a -tiny- bit of mayonaisse could have been added to the bun.  Mayo would have definitely made the flavor profile more reminiscent of the teri-beef burgers you get at local drive-ins in Hawaii.   Now for the Beef & Cheddar slider:  A person who likes fresh colors and contrasting textures might find this slider too one-dimensional.  Before I picked it up, I was expecting it to be a greasy slog, but instead I was pleasantly surprised at how well the buttery croissant had held it's saucy fill.  The beef was something like you'd find in a traditional philly steak, thin-cut, chopped, lean and well-done.  It had been topped with what I'm guessing was the bechamel cheese sauce from the sold-out mac & cheese slider.  The sauce was rich!  After two of these bad boys I was feeling _HEAVY_.  All items at the Slider Truck are made to order, and that's a good thing because any more than the few minutes between pick-up and consumption would turn the Beef & Cheddar slider into a funky, soggy mess.  I'm going to give three stars today, because my order was fresh and flavorful.  I'd like to revisit the Slider Truck when it's serving up it's full menu, plus a couple tasting items.  There's definitely some big-time potential here, but for $3 per item, I think they owe it to their patrons not to hold anything back.  Cash only.",

Early in the day I sent a text to a few friends asking if they wanted to hit up the Slider Truck; big mistake.  Have you ever had to go through an entire work day, with nothing but the Slider Truck driving through your head, dispensing those delicious burgers?  The anticipation was like going to Disneyland, except for my mouth.  I got to do a repeat eat of my favorite from past visits, The Barbie, and also got to try two new sliders: the Captain's Order and the Frenchie.  The Barbie is still filled with awesome, with the carmelized jalapenos and bacon winning me over time and time again.  The Captain's Order was different for me; I had to try it because it wasn't on the menu last time.  It tasted like a really good salad on a really good burger.    Last up was the secret menu item for the day (which he revealed out of Yelp love!), the Frenchie, a hamburger bun hugging sliced beef tenderloin and provolone cheese together, coupled with an au jus dipping sauce.  When I received my order the first thing I noticed was how light the au jus was!  We're talking cloudy water type of transparency, as opposed to the typical dark color I'm used to.  But no nead to fear, Slider Truck was on top of things as usual and managed to pack unbelievable amounts of flavor into that au jus.  It was simply screaming \"Dip ALL your burgers into me!\"  How could you do this to me Ricardo?  I still need to try your french fries.  And now I want to sign up for a Twitter account to see your updates.  I can't wait till my next visit!",

Captains Order:  argula, feta, bacon, cheddar, and balsamic reduction...sounded fantastic, but the balsamic reduction for a lil overwhelming.  the meat was cooked to perfection though.  Barby: crispy onions, jalapenos, bbq sauce it was messy and delicous.  lots of flavor and juicy meat.    make sure you get these with nice warm buns... we ate these yummy burgers again today and it was a lil windy out and cooled the buns down and it wasnt as good.  great friendly guys and great service!  worth following!!!",

We waited a little over an hour only to discover that they ran out of food when it came time to make our order. :-(  At this point I was beyond starving but Ric refunded our money, gave us some free drinks, and comped our next meal.    I was at work one Saturday when I saw via Twitter that the Slider Truck was on Sahara and Maryland which was right on my way home from work.  I still had the comp so I swung in to find the truck.  There was virtually no line and my food was up in no time at all.  The food was amazing.  I had the Caprese and my bf had the Barbie, Plain Jane, and Pep Pep.  We both had the sweet potato fries which might actually be my favorite part of the whole thing.  Did the food redeem our initial experience?  Yes.    We just caught the truck again last night and the food was even better this time.  There was a line when we arrived but it went quickly.    Just be prepared to wait a bit.  Bring a camp chair if you have to!  And it's not exactly cheap.  But it's amazing food and worth the wait and the price.  Ric is also a super nice guy and always takes care of his customers.   I'd actually like to give the Slider Truck 4.5 stars, but that's not an option.",

    "text": "I tried them again at the Food Truck Fest II and definitely a much more enjoyable experience compared to the last time. I had the Barbie and the Pep Pep, which were both awesome. Each of them were moist and weren't dry all all. So I was able to truly appreciated the flavors blending with the sweetness of the bread, which I absolutely loved! I was also suprised at the thickness of the patties because I don't remember them being as meaty as this. The food also came out prompty with very little wait. For some reason the service at the truck is better compared to HQ.  I also like the fact that they accept debit, which is rare for most trucks.  So after this, Slidin' Thru will be seeing more of me!",

    "text": "OK, I'm jumping on the bandwagon (or slider truck in this case) and giving them 5 stars. I finally had the chance to check them out the other night. I arrived a little early to beat the crowd and I wasn't the only one with that idea. It was funny to see several people waiting in their cars. Who would ever think that a slider truck would cause so many people to wait in an empty lot for its arrival. I wasn't sure what to get so I ended up getting 5 different sliders and an order of sweet potato fries. Here's how I would rank them from best to pretty good:  1. Pep Pep -- I love the sauce. It was like a Thousand Island type of sauce. It added so much depth to the beef, onion and bacon. 2. Kalbi -- It had a wonderfully sweet taste to it, but the meat could have been a bit more tender. 3. Barbie -- Love the bbq sauce! 4. Yaya -- The feta and tzatziki sauce with the patty was a good combo, kinda like a gyro. 5. Captain's Order -- A little overcooked. Compared to the other sliders this one just didn't have the same wow factor, but still a solid burger.  The sliders were bigger than I thought they would be. The patties are thick and 2 or 3 are probably enough to fill up most people. Luckily I had my wife and kid to help me finish all five. Then of course we also had the sugar coated sweet potato fries which were delicious. All of that only cost $15. That's one of the best bargains you'll find anywhere in the city. Where else can two adults eat a satisfying meal for $15? And I'm not counting fast food chains because this food is far superior.  I didn't have the chance to try the pulled porkie (they were all out) but I'll definitely track them down again for another round. They not only have the best sliders in town, but burgers that are just as good, if not better than, many of the upscale burger joints around.",

It was pretty much a party in my mouth. I sat on the dirty street corner in downtown with my lovely boyfriend. I had my little caprese sliders in my lap, and I inhaled them and pretty much twitched around in wondrous admiration of the beautiful mix of mozzarella cheese and balsamic vinegar. That moment will always be etched into my mind.",

The Slidin' Thru posse took the mean streets of Vegas and have managed to create a fun, friendly, and tasty atmosphere everywhere they have went. From knucklebumps to windowlove to gettin tipsy, the environment surrounding the Slider Truck is just rad.  The Slider Truck was my first experience with street food. I'm now a fan street food and a fan of theirs for life. Their sliders might be some of the best burgers I've ever tasted. The ingredients are fresh, everything is made to order, and they provide amazing customer service. When I buy a burger from these guys I can tell that they really appreciate my business. The appreciation is further shown by them when I take a bite of those delicious little sliders of awesomeness and my taste buds begin doing backflips.  I believe in what these guys are doing and how they are doing it. They deserve all of the success they have had. They could put on a clinic on how to succeed in modern business.  #windowlove",

    "text": "A future flashed before me filled with fast food joints as fun and fresh as the new home for Slidin' Thru, and suddenly, the future wasn't so scary. There is no apocalypse in this future. No Terminator either, which may make you a little sad, but on the upside, there are plenty of delicious mini burgs and ice cream on fries.  Clearly, before I even sampled the goods, I was in love. The space just makes you smile in all its white grandeur and boomin' soundtrack. Quite simply the  best music you will ever hear played at a fast food spot. I even heard Joan frickin' Jett!   The menu features some of your oldies but goodies, like my standby the Porky which happens to be a cheap one at $2.50, lucky me! I love this little porker, love the pickles, love the sauce, someone call up a priest so we can get married! I made a wonderful discovery too: If you're avoiding buns, you can order up any item Protein Steez, i.e. served on a lettuce wrap. Delicious, and of course, vegetarians, you can substitute eggplant on any of their creations. I also ordered up some sweet potato fries, and they are the sweetest in town.   The staff is everything you would want in your Slidin' Thru crew. They've got the look, the talk, and most importantly, the fist bumps!   I can't really imagine what else you could want.",

    "text": "Before you get mad....... Slidin' Thru ACTUALLY gets a 2.5. I get it. They're nice guys, they fist bump you to make you feel special (even though you're not), they have a cool atmosphere with what some consider to be good music (I don't), and they serve (pretty) tasty sliders. I've caught the truck twice before in the past, and both times my stomach was still hungry and the pockets in my pants felt molested.  I'm not going to whack around the bush; Slidin' Thru's prices are outrageous. If you are like me and thought that 3 sliders for $7 was a bit much on the truck, you're going to be totally disappointed now. Seven hundred and forty six dollars for a single mini-burg. Just kidding! But you can pay upward of $3.50 for one burger; and as of opening day, no 3 for $7. How cheap! And not the good kind of cheap either.   In the end, I agree with the masses that Slidin' Thru has a lot of character and good eats. But unfortunately they also have steep prices and long wait times. Did I mention my slider buns weren't exactly fresh either? If I'm going to pay nearly four dollars for one tiny hamburger; it better give my mouth a boner!   While it's good to see Slidin' Thru open a location so close to my house, I think I'll take my three million Carl's Jr. coupons (thanks, mailbox!) to Uncle Carl and gets me some full-sized charbroiled burgers in the future. Call me cheap : I work hard for my money! The menu is refreshing and the fist bumps are a nice touch; but it'll take more than that to get MY yen.  * This review is for the Durango location.",

We saw a beautiful mecca of a truck in the parking lot of the Las Vegas Convention Center. We walked out there and the owner was closing down the side panels. He told us that he was out of food...we instantly had sad looks in our eyes...he then said, \"Guys don't shut down! (he was talking to the cooks) We have to feed these two guys!\" That right there gets 5 stars for customer service.   They were out of fries but made up for it with an extra slider and a piece of chocolate. We tried the Barby: melted cheddar, caramelized jalapeno, crispy fried onion strips, bacon & BBQ sauce and also the Pep Pep: lettuce, tomato, crisp bacon, sauteed onion, melted cheddar, pickle & super sauce. Both burgers were amazing!!!   The cooks inside the Slider Truck were also really cool...they started talking to us and we were going back and forth. Which is amazing! Because if my boss told me to shut down the grill and then two guys came out to order and he told me to fire it up again...I do not think I would be very happy. This shows the True colors of these guys...the customer is always first!!!   The next day I looked in the Convention Parking lot for Slidin' Thru and they were nothing more then a pleasant memory of burgers past. Until our paths cross again Slider Truck I will be dreaming of your mini burgers.  Can I place an order for you guys to show up at NAB in April?  I will be keeping my fingers crossed that you got this message.",

A+ on the different meats and sauces, I like them all.  The atmosphere is also awesome, chatted with several people in line. The guys who run the truck are so sweet and friendly. We will be back for more!   My only one tiny gripe is the bun they use, i like a thinner bun like White Castle serves, they use a roll type bun that is too much bread for me, but don't let that stop you from enjoying these awesome burgers and fun experience! Next time we will try the fries too, I heard they are \"screamin\" from the gentleman behind me in line.",

I had the Yaya and the Porkie for lunch, which is good because they were out of those by dinner. Both were absolutely excellent. For dinner I had the Barbie and Pep Pep. Barbie was probably the weakest of the four, though still quite good. Pep had great sauce. Both varieties of fries were good too!  I wasn't sure what to expect from prices until I got there, and was pleasantly surprised. For $7 I can get two sliders and fries, which is the perfect amount of food (maybe even too many fries, so it's good for sharing). Can't complain about that!  Hopefully these guys have some plans to move toward accepting credit cards, because I saw a few people bail from the evening line when they found out it was cash only. Maybe I missed it but it wasn't clearly posted on the signage, which might help, or on the website. But that's truly the only criticism I have. Looking forward to the next time they're nearby!",

Staff was very friendly, took a few minutes to prepare the order, but quality is worth waiting for.  Had the Pep Pep, Barbie, Porkie and a Cinco de Mayo special of carnitas with pickled onions and cotilla cheese.  All were really good, burgers were solid, Porkie and Cinco de Mayo special were really good - really wanted to try to Kalbi burger but no dice on this day.

We tried every type of slider, and all of them had a really nice and unexpected balance of flavor that worked well.  We went twice, one day they had hawaiian roll buns and the other day they had normal buns.  The hawaiian rolls actually ended up tasting better than their standard bun.    One word of advice, both days they sold out of certain types of sliders, so get there early if you want to try a particular one!

On the sliders I'd give it a 3/5---the best was the caprese but it was dry it doesn't come with mayo or any type of dressing except a slight drizzle of balsamic...it needed some mayo.  The fries were really good and had cinnamon/sugar on it.  Kinda pricey at 3.00 for a small bag.  Our total was 17.00 and it was what I would expect to pay so I have no complaint in the price.  Overall it was good but I was expecting a little more as far as flavor.  The location we went to was the Centennial/Durango location.  My suggestion would be to have 1-2 more choices as far as sandwiches.  I wouldve like to have a french dip or short rib slider.  I would also say to ask if we want mayo or dressing as we weren't sure if that was available.",

I finally had the joy of eating those delicious sliders last week and LOVED them! I had three sliders - the barby, pep pep, and yaya and then shared a side of sweet potato fries. Each slider was absolutely delicious and you could literally taste every single component of each. My favorite one was the yaya - it was so refreshing and I really enjoyed the feta cheese. The sweet potato fries were covered in sugar and cinnamon.... enough said! Not to mention, the slider truck guys are incredibly nice, happy, and friendly. We didn't have any cash on us, so we were forced to pay with a card. They then told us that their machine stopped working and they were only taking cash. Bummer! BUT, much to our surprise, they explained that they could give us an \"I O LOU\", trusting that we would come back later to pay. whaaat!? awesome! We accepted the ridiculous offer and enjoyed our sliders. Later that night, we went to their next location to pay back the \"I O LOU\" and decided to get even more sliders, which this time included the pulled porky (yum, yum, yum). Overall, absolutely love the food and the service! WOOOHOOO slider truck!",

Not just great sliders, with a hefty portion of meat for a slider (at least the first normal-thickness patty I have ever seen on a slider!), but the crew on the truck is pretty awesome.  Fun and into what they do.  Tried the Captain's special, the Barby and sweet potato fries.  Just great flavors, well cooked perfection.  If you like a decent burger, I would recommend a stop by the truck.",

That experience definitely translates to Slidin' Thru NW as they have managed to keep the food just as delicious while still staying True to their overly enthusiastic style.

I personally had the Barby and the Pep Pep and would gladly order them again.  However, the wait times for some of their food is a little ridiculous. Even though it's a slider truck, I don't think I'm going to wait 30 minutes for food when there isn't a large line in front of me. Minus One Star.  The worst part though, is watching people who order way after you and get their food BEFORE you. And we're not talking about the logical \"They ordered less food or they ordered less complicated food\", but it stings when someone gets a huge order of 5-10 sliders before your one slider with fries after you've been waiting for over 30 minutes.  The food is good, but the service could be a lot better.",

There was already quite a line, but it didn't look like more than 30 minute wait. We didn't wait 30 minutes. We waited 45 minutes and only moved 15 feet with about 20 people ahead of us still. Matt and I did not get food tonight.   You know why we didn't get food? We overheard that some lady up front ordered TWO DOZEN sliders. When you are a business that makes items as they're ordered and you see a crazy-long line, you have to draw the line somewhere. Seriously, it should be 6 sliders per customer, period. TWO DOZEN. Who the hell needs 24 sliders?? You should not be ordering for friends or family, you need to drag their butts down there so you can stare at all the people glaring at you for holding them up from eating.   I don't think we would have been served in an hour and a half, and there's no way that the Slider Truck is worth that kind of wait. Half hour tops. And that is usually all I have to wait if not less. But once it gets past an hour, it gets ridiculous.   I'm seriously thinking about selling my Groupon that I have for them because the wait times have gone up like crazy and I don't think I'll be able to use it anytime soon.   Oh and P.S. Anyone who cuts the line at the Slider Truck, you have a separate circle in hell waiting for you.",

I'll start off with the food since that's the heartbeat of all restaurants.  My personal favorite is the Captain's Burger, a juicy slider (they call them mini burgers) seasoned to perfection with balsamic reduction, feta cheese, arugala, tomatos, and carmelized onions.  (I'm getting the craving just typing about it).  This is set off by a delicious wheat bun....mmmmm!  The Pep Pep and the Buffalo Soldier are good as well, but its hard to pass up my fav.  Also try the Sweet Potato fries, a unique and tasty twist to typical fast food.  The atmosphere is fun and filled with energy, music is pumping, colors are vibrant and the staff is courteous.  Its a haul for me so I usually catch them at First Friday in their Food Truck",

    "text": "3.5 overall rounded to 4 for being somewhat unique and great service.  I was excited to try this place, so much so that I skipped lunch yesterday and spent an extra 20 min on the treadmill to build up maximum hunger before going (not healthy, i know) for my 1st time :)  The location is sadly far from me but worth a trip 1x at least.  With maximum hunger I ordered the plain jane mini meal, the buffalo soldier and the caprese.  The guy asked is that all?...and i just laughed at him and he laughed back at me lol.  Plain Jane - Nothing special but solid little burger.  If not for the very generous serving of fries i'd feel ripped off by the price of the combo   3/5  Buffalo Soldier - My first bite was like all bun and ranch...yuck.  I had to kind of hunt for the ingredients and break it down.  The hot sauce and swiss were almost non existent and the chicken was this tiny little piece of flavorless meat.  The crispy onions were good and a nice touch.  Wouldn't repeat this one or would try it light ranch and more hot sauce?   2/5  Caprese-  Saved this for last....A friend of mine says you can really taste food with your eyes, and she's right!  It was clear this was going to be the best slider as you could see the fresh eggplant and cheese, tomato bulging outside of the bun.  It was like the Buffalo Soldier and the Caprese came from different slider joints.  Very tasty and the most balanced of the 3 I tried.   5/5  Fries - Regular fries with the combo were really good and generous portion.  4/5  Overall comments 1.  Price..all this food was $11, which seemed steep but I was ridiculously full after so I guess it's highish but not ridiculous.  I think people would warm up to the price if the value meals came with 2 sliders and less fries perhaps?  The plain jane was pretty tiny and the ala carte price of $2.5 seems LOL   3/5  2.  The buns....weren't bad, weren't great....but seemed uninspired and seemed to dominate the sliders with the exception of the Caprese.  I felt myself wanting to ditch the bun by the time I got to this one.  Maybe they could reduce the size of the buns?   2/5  3.  Awesome service.  I know they fist bump everyone and say hi and bye enthusiastically to everyone but if that was the norm in this little world wouldn't we all be happier :)   The staff seemed genuine and like they enjoyed working there  5/5  Overall the experience left me wanting to try more...i'll be back after another long workout!!!",

First off, the truck itself is super bad ass, and it gave my boyfriend a comic boner just from looking at it.   We both got a single slider (we had dinner just a couple of hours earlier, but knew we had to hop on our chance to try this place out). I got the Barby, which is pretty much like a mini bacon cheeseburger. It was pretty tasty. My boyfriend got the pep pep which he said was the best slider he's had in his life. We shared a large bag of sweet potato fries. I was surprised to see they coated them in brown sugar, which was yummy!   We only had to wait about 5 minutes for what seemed as super fresh food.

Well at least a little, we probably need a few more generations and some starving artists needs to be the next Picasso.  Trying to find these guys was fine.  Standing in line was not a problem I've waited longer on hold with banks and airlines.  We had the barbie, pep, pulled pork and captain's burgers / sliders.  Sounds like a lot but you gotta try everything if your going to wait in a line.  The smell, taste and style was almost reminiscent of the food that you see at carnivals or town fairs.    I love the burgers cooked on the outdoor grill at the farmer's market in SF.  The Slider Truck cooked everything decently and the flavors worked well.  Jut not overly impressed with the food.  Simple, done right but nothing innovative.  Didn't care for the pork which normally I love pig over beef.    A little tired of bbq sauce on burgers, there are a billions different styles and recipes, but at the end of the day they all have the same flavor elements which would taste good on anything chicken, steak, fries etc.  Doesn't make it great.",

    "text": "After hearing so much about Slidin' Thru, we were excited to try it. On one hot summer evening, it set up shop within a few miles of home, so this was our chance to check it out. Alas it was not to be. We waited about half an hour to place our order and another 20 minutes, all during 100 degree temps, but ended up without any food due to a malfunctioning propane tank. Ric graciously refunded our money and even comp'd our order for next time.  Several days later we returned to try again. We were 5th in line and received our food about 25 minutes later.  Our favorites were the Captain's Order and the Barbie. They were tasty and well prepared. However, the other sliders let us down. The bacon in the Pep Pep was far too salty. The Eggplant Caprese lacked flavor and was in dire need of some kind of seasoning or even just salt. The Yaya was their Greek slider, but the tzatziki sauce made everything soggy and unappetizing. As for the Pulled Porkie, some of the pork and buns were burnt to the point of being inedible. We did enjoy the sweet potato fries which were tossed with cinnamon sugar.  Ric has promising ideas on his menu but has issues with consistency and execution of those ideas. At $7 for 3 small sliders, we don't think the value is there. We have had larger and/or better tasting sliders for less and in nicer environs. While the service is very friendly and enthusiastic, the food quality simply does not justify the long wait times to place and then receive your order. We really want to like this place and support local entrepreneurs, but right now there are too many issues to draw us back.",

    "text": "Utterly disappointing. Between the fact that I'd seen this burger on some top burgers in America lists and the fact that yelpers rated it a four star I was expecting something really good at minimum. I have several burgers on my list to try the summer while in vegas. I was also really craving a good burger this day and still am. Unfortunately I came up short. I think the slider ideal is better suited for the food truck instead of a sit down restaurant. I ordered the peppep and the barby. Getting one free with my yelp check in. When I got my order I actually had four burgers on my tray. I told the lady that only ordered to two. They ended up giving me them because they have already made them. My biggest thought here is where's the beef, Obviously it's a slider so there's a little beef to be had. When I say deconstructed 2 of my burgers to make one bigger burger I can actually taste the meat and it was decent, not great, but decent. I think I would stay away from this restaurant especially if you have to drive far out of your way like I did you get here. Aswell this place also had sweet potato fries which seems to be the norm at most restaurants nowadays. The difference here if they actually put sugar on their fries. If I want to eat sweet potato fries because I am trying to be healthy, I don't need the added sugar. Unfortunately the fries were good but the sugar made it not so orderable if you're trying to be healthy. One final thought I think I would just stay away the next time I'm craving a burger if this is my option.",

    "text": "I finally went, yay!  I have to admit, I've been dragging my feet on trying this place. I have two reasons for the delay. First, I haven't really gotten into the food truck craze. I can't help it, I really like sit down restaurants. I enjoy making dining an event. Although I do love me some Fuku. Second, I have heard a lot about the social aspect of the Slider Truck and that made me shy away as well. I may be weird, but I like a little anonymity with my meal. I don't really want to play around or be \"on,\" so to speak.  I felt I had procrastinated enough, so after much hemming and hawing, I made my way out on a very rainy evening and I couldn't be happier that I did. There was no line and we were only one of two groups of customers here at the time. We ordered and we did have a nice little chit chat with the guys and luckily, I had a really nice experience.  Me and my guy tried just about every slider they have, minus the caprese, since I hadn't heard too many good things about it. We also got an order of the sweet potato fries and the Mystery Slider, which happened to be turkey pastrami, which I wasn't really a fan of. The Captain's Order and the Yaya were my favorites. I also really liked the porky. Yum. The sweet potato fries were exactly how I like them, more on the sweet than savory side with the cinnamon and sugar sprinkled on top. Some honey drizzled on top of that would make it an even bigger hit with me.   I'll definitely be back.",

    "text": "Hubby and I successfully climbed a mountain today and, as usual after a successful ascent, I was hungry.  Tummy was rumbling and grumbling like a disgruntled bear.  I've been wanting to try Slidin' Thru NW for a while and today was it.  Nothing like a good long hike to give one an excuse to eat really bad food.....  ....and the food was bad in that great wonderful junk food way, except the quality of the ingredients was very high!  I ordered one Plain Jane sans cheese (regular angus beef slider) and one Porky (bbq pulled pork) and hubby ordered one Pep Pep (BLT + cheese) and one Caprese (as in the salad).  We shared an order of the sweet potato fries.  Great flavour and food quality.  The Porky bbq sauce is SO GOOD.  What do they put in it??  Hubby's Caprese slider was delish as well, featuring a nice blend of the balsamic vinegar with the mozza.  Some may feel the prices to be on the high side for baby burgers, but I'm ok with paying a bit more for quality.  (And, the sliders aren't baby sized.  Two plus a side of fries is a decent meal.)  Prices range from $2.50-$3.50 for sliders and $2 for regular fries to $3 for the sweet potato fries.  NB: The sweet potato fries are sweet!  Instead of salt, the folks at Slidin' Thru sprinkle a cinnamon-sugar-y mix over the fries.  I prefer my fries salty, so will not order the sweet potato fries again; that said, the fries were crispy and hot!  NB#2: Is there a way to avoid the use of styrofoam?  I know that the sliders can get messy and hot sliders are the goal, especially for the drive thru customers, but styrofoam?  Really?  The place was super clean when we went earlier today and the staff very enthusiastic about our first-time visit.  :)",

My favs are the Barby and Chicky Boom (chicken salad). There's never really a crowd here and the service is fast. The dining area is very clean and modern as well, and of course they also have a drive thru.",

    "text": "Finally, finally made it to Slider Truck after the mishap back in April.  The ONLY reason why is that they came to UNLV for the UNLV Beverage Club.  Otherwise, they never seem to go anywhere near central/east side so I decided this was worth the wait.  I worked out with my trainer, showered, and stood outside for 45 minutes de-showering in the hot sun for this.  The guy who took orders (not Ric) was great, wearing a UNLV hat, very outgoing.  He said it was not a crime to get the Barby without bacon, and I said I was looking forward to the jalepenos.  I also got the yaya and the caprese.  Once I ordered, the food came out very fast.  I got back to my office RIGHT when my shift started, and started eating.  Prices are fine, food was HOT, and the taste was great.  My sadness came with the lack of ANY jalepenos on the barby.  We had talked about it (I told the guy I was from Texas and I like spicy food, and that he can double the peppers to replace the bacon I didn't want).  So I guess after seeing caramelized jalepenos on the menu for 6 months, I was sad when I didn't end up with any.  Otherwise, it was fun, got it out of my system, tipped them so they all yelled, \"TIP THE TRUCK\" and shook it, and enjoyed what I ate.  A-OK.  UPDATED 02/2011: Went back when it was near Greenspun media recently.  Girl in front of me tipped and got tip the truck luv, and I tipped and got ignored.  I ordered barby no bacon, yaya, and the special mango chutney chicken no bacon (glad he told me it had bacon) - nevertheless both sliders had bacon on them that were not supposed to.  I took the bacon off and tried the sliders.  The chicken was rotisserie style so it had a nice flavor, but mango chutney was kind of gummy.  The caramelized jalepenos I waited so long for were just like diced and nothing special.  So not only did I end up with bacon, I ended up ILL.  Not good for the next 2 days.  I definitely got this out of my system, literally and figuratively.",

The neat thing about StrEATS is not only the damn good eats, but also seeing all the trucks side-by-side. And the slider truck really shines. They have the art of the food truck down to a science. There is no line too long. No glitch too big. Nothing overwhelms or stops the slider truck. And all of the staff are always so friendly and enthusiastic. And the mystery slider at the latest StrEATS totally rocked. It was basically the Yaya, but all kicked up a serious mega notch. The added hot sauce (and/or whatever they did) was absolute mini-burg perfection. Who would've known that feta and red wine vinaigrette and hot sauce would all mingle together so gloriously.",

    "text": "The Slider Truck has garnered some immediate successes upon their opening early this summer, and well worth it.  You can't help but notice their truck as they go sliding on through!  It's completely painted brightly with cartoon-like images.  My first experience with them was after the Las Vegas AIDS Walk where we had the Slider Truck pretty much to ourselves.  There was no wait really to put in our order, so that was definitely something we appreciated.  At the time, they were still experimenting with different burgers, so we only had a few to choose from.  One thing we did like from the start was the Pep Pep, which has sauteed onions, crisp bacon, fresh lettuce and tomato, melted cheese on top of a juicy patty along with their super sauce.  They also had the Pulled Porkie during that time, which has layers of pork on top of the toasted buns.    We also tried the Barbie had cheese and bacon over the burger, along with plenty of barbecue sauce.  For the price you pay, there is definitely a lot of meat in between those two buns and it's a moist burger too.  We've paid more for a lot less - quantity and taste-wise, so this was a welcome addition to Vegas.  Our next experience was on a Friday night and long lines were known to be found where the Slider Truck was.  In this case, there was indeed a line, but it was really the people gathering and waiting for their burgers.  It was a good 45 minutes before we got our burgers.  Ric came out from the truck to apologize for the long wait and some kid piped up, \"It's worth the wait!\"  That pretty much sums it up!  Overall, we love the Slider Truck and the idea behind it.  Sure, waiting 45 minutes for a burger brings the wait for truck food to a whole new level.  We'll keep our eyes out for this truck, but we'll have to watch our clock too at the same time.  We definitely want to see Ric and his crew do well.  Owners who care about their customers and are genuinely excited about what they are doing is something we should all support!",

I walk around work talking about the slider truck and how delicious it is and once they all try it they wont want another burger... It has happend.  We close down our store every year for SEMA and I have a friend that had a few cars in the show so I had a chance to walk through the night before the show opend and low and behold I spoted the \"TRUCKS\". I let the guys at work know that lunch was at the slider Truck..    The area where the truck was opened at 9 and off we went direclty for the sliders.... Okay okay, I know 9am is a little early for slider goodness but we were excited. We ended up running into Ric and the crew and they let us know that the window was opne for Love at 10am.   At 10 we were the first in line. We ordered our delicious meals and the window love began.. As the burgers came out we started to get down and man oh man I think they get better every time.   Now, obvioulsy I am raving about it and I like the slider truck but the guy behind us in line ordered some sliders and they came out cooked perfectly just like ours a very slight amount of pink with all the juices flowing and this mellow dramatic cowboy from texas, which he had to make known, freaked out and spit out his mouth full of slider and threw his sliders down and threw a gigantic fit... Well I guess they do say everything is bigger in texas. No worries Ric, we were ready to take him out. You knwo what they say about texes theres only 2 things that come from there... And I know damn well he was no steer..",

I did not tell my wife that the slider truck was gonna be there. I just told her lets walk around, the weather was beautiful. So our 2 month old son can get some vitamin d. We get there around 10 or so. The slider truck pulled up a little after. There was a line instantly of about 15-20 people.   We ordered 2 barbys and 2 pulled porkys and sweet potato fries. I did not have change before I ordered but a lady in front of me, had change but I already ordered and paid. A couple minutes later, our ordered popped out and I tasted perfection. Both were DELICIOUS! I especially enjoyed the barby. Before I finished the second slider, I jumped back in line and order 3 more sliders(1 barby, 1 pep pep, pulled porky) , oreo cheesecake and a sprite. My favorite is the barby.  My wife and brother in law were a bit skeptical at first. But fell in love after the first bite and all week we have been keeping tabs on the location of the slider truck. Hopefully we can meet again this week.",

I want to give this a 4 1/2 but yelp won't let me :(  Barby- LOVED IT! Seriously I think that was my favorite!! I wish I had got more of it! The sauce and carmelized jalapeno made the meat more juicy and less dry  Captain's Order--ehh not so great. I guess I got myself worked up too much. I wanted something with vegetables in it (maybe I should have got the Pep Pep) But it was so dry! There was some sauteed onion in it, but not enough for me..I was so thirsty while eating it. And it just ruined the whole slider.  Pulled Porky--I took a bite off a friend's. I loved it :) very juicy, but alas I wanted some more veggies in it.  Caprese--My sister ordered. Took a bite. It was pretty good :)  Sweet potato fries--I tried them from my friend........AND THEY WERE DELICIOUS. Happiness in my mouth.  It was like having dessert and lunch time food at the same time. I wish I bought some, but I was in rush again.    Next time, I hope to try the Pep Pep , Yaya, and Barby again and give them a 5!",

Ric hasn't made me a slider yet that I haven't loved.  The Slider Truck is something I had never even dreamt of, but now that it's here I can't imagine a world without it. I'm not saying it's the only thing I care to eat anymore, but it's really nice to have a relatively-quick, inexpensive and extremely-delicious option for my lunch breaks.  It's strange -- the Slider Truck seemed to just materialize out of nowhere one day, didn't it? I saw Matt tweeting about it one day and decided to try it out, and now here we are. Maybe Ric is actually a dark wizard-chef from the future, come to advance civilization to new and tasty heights! It's one possible explanation. More likely he was just tired of all the crap being dished out, and the lack of culture and street-side camaraderie in Las Vegas, and he decided to do something about it.  Either way, I respect this man and I thank him for the food truck revolution he's begun. God bless Ric and his big truck of tiny burgers.  #yelplove",

    "text": "Ok, I finally tried out the Slider Truck today.  They were on my side of town, so everything fell into place.  I was surprised when I went to the window to order...Rick recognized me.  It kind of shocked me when he called me by name...he must have been monitoring the Twitter account, because that was the only way he could have known I was coming because we've never met.  Anyway, that was impressive.  I ordered the Barbie & the Pep Pep.  While I was waiting for my food, I noticed that most of the people who were there were repeat customers.  They have done a great job of promoting their business via social networking.  After a short wait my food was ready.  I couldn't wait to try it out.  I first attacked the Barbie....it was very tasty and fresh.  It didn't take me long to devour it.  The BBQ sauce and jalapeno peppers went well together.  The Pep Pep was next....and it was even better.  I especially like the sauce.  The only reason I didn't give them 5 Stars is because of the eating experience itself.  It was pretty windy and I was planning to eat in my car....but because of how messy the sliders are, I didn't want to get it all over my car or clothes, so I ate outside.  It wasn't very pleasant or ideal.  I understand that's how it works with food trucks, but I guess that's why I'm not a fan of most.  At least they give you wet wipes to clean up.  Will I return?  If they're located nearby or relatively close, I will.  i won't drive to the other side of town for it.",

    "text": "Gourmet street fare or otherwise known as meals from a truck is nothing new to me. Since living as a New Yorker, it is pretty common sight to see food vendors on the street with their mini food carts or otherwise, food trucks. It's sort of fast food-on-the-go. To me, that's quickie meal. See, eat, and done! Serves the purpose of hunger filling! Golly, it has found its way even in other major American cities and now in Vegas!   Okay, so Sliding Thru as this food truck is aptly named, has gained popularity. This one is crewed by five friends in their twentysomethings. I tried their fare in October 2010. There was a line of customers as I approached the truck. I ordered sliders affordably priced and I was able to see up-close inside their truck how these jolly, fun, easy-going food crew whips up these delicious favorites of mine: sliders. In the truck, it's a mini kitchen with the usual things of the sink, freezer, stainless steel compartments, storage spaces underneath the sink, overhead storage, paper supplies, first aid kit, plastic counter for preparing the food, ice bath compartment, steam table, flat grill with a grease trap drain and faucet for cleaning the grill, deep-fat fryer, fire extinguisher, a grill hood with fan, serving station, station for hot beverage containers, the window where food is served to customers, rubber mats on the floor, a counter with lids to store candies and chips, then the door in the area of the truck driver's section. Well, that's much I saw because it smelled food goodness inside the truck! Yes, a restaurant on wheels!  In no time at all, I got my sliders sssllliiiid thrruuu the truck's side window! See photos of \"Pulled Porkie\" (a Southern style barbecue pork in that sweet and sour spiced jalapeno barbecue sauce with lotsa grilled caramelized onions), the \"Eggplant Caprese\" (with great chunks of tomato, eggplant) and a \"Mystery Slider\" (which is a daily special. The special I got was a burger-bacon-cheese yummminess), they were absolutely the bombilicious!!! Moist, warm, juicy and tasty. Add to that, it is freshly made! Packed in styrofoam box, it had M & M's and a Milky Way chocolate treats for dessert, plus a small pack of wet naps for the messy part of the food adventure. Oh, the crunchy sweet potato fries are my favorite as well as the \"Pep Pep\" and \"Captain's Order\". Mind you, it didn't take much minutes to devour them (I wasn't even hungry) but is a testament to how good it is that my heart fell in love all the way to my stomach. I even got to take their picture as they happily, giddily, comically posed for me. These men start work very early in the day, then prepares food for freshness, cooking, serving, and maintaining cleanliness after a day's work, with long hours but they like it! Steven, Juan, Louie, Nick and Ric (Ricardo Guerrero, owner), it's grrrreaaaat, boys!!

    "text": "FINALLY!!! Hitting the streets of Las #Vegas the 1st gourmet @SliderTruck. I took part in their soft-opening event at the park on W Flamingo/Buffalo last Saturday from 11-2. What a great start!!  When I arrived shortly after 11 there was already a good size crowd gathered and things were in full swing. Chuy and Ricardo the operators of the truck were real friendly and very personable welcoming everyone to try some of Las Vegas' Gourmet street food.  There was a limited menu to keep it simple for the event and all items were ONLY $1 each so I ordered one of each:) Pancakes in Blueberry sauce-A Captains Order Slider and a Monte Cristo.  The sliders were FANTASTIC!!! I wanted to make sure everyone got to try some or I would have went back for another half dozen \"Captain's Order\" Sliders!! :)  The pancakes were great too, what I got to try the kid snatched them and ran off to scraf them down;)  I really enjoy street food and hope to see the @SliderTruck succeed maybe even encourage a couple more trucks soon ;)   I've already passed out 200 flyers in my neighborhood to get people out to try the @SliderTruck this Thursday 3/25 11-12pm. Come join us at 3100 W Sahara just 1 block West of Palace Station!!",

    "text": "Food that creates a smile is great food, but food that inspires--that's fantastic food.  The slider truck, although casually camouflaged with a comic theme and serving nothing but sliders, creates great eats that are inspiring for those who love to eat and for those who want to cook.  With the food comes the people, a plethora of individuals that somehow meld together into a friendly mass of hungry fans.  Despite the wait time for excellent sliders the people converse as if they know each other, making the wait seem like a few minutes rather than a bit longer.  I don't mind waiting in line with the cult followers because they are a mixture of artists, parents, students, geeks, photographers, and more.  While waiting in line for the slider truck you get an intelligent conversation in with great people. I love it.  With the crowd comes the need to feed, and the slider truck delivers wonderful morsels of juicy burger love.  They changed me, turning me into a fan of things I do not normally eat, and that is a feat in itself.  The menu is simple and there are days when they have secret menu items available as well, items that their regulars will wait an hour in line for just to get a taste.  Today it was the french dipper, a roast beef slider with melted cheese, onions and mushroom with a side of au jus.  I tried one and it was to die for--tender, juicy, packed from top to bottom bun and seasoned so well that I wish I ordered four more.  I will definitely dream of that french dipper till the next time it's on the secret menu.  When it comes to turning me, the pulled pork sandwich--one that I refuse to eat ever--became an instant favorite of mine from the slider truck.  It's perfectly cooked and the barbecue sauce is spicy, sweet, and oh so smooth.  That pulled pork is juicy and tender, well seasoned and the sandwich, although slider size, is packed full of it.  The other thing that I hate to eat are jalapenos, but they make a jalapeno jelly that I cannot get enough of on their Captain slider.  I could eat fifty of those burgers with the jalapeno jelly on it.    With the mind changing food comes great service.  The owner handles the truck personally, along with three to four of his trusted friends that basically line cook to keep the food coming out fast.  They are all friendly, always smiling and they take extra care to pack everything nicely and with everything you need.  A great touch is the candy that you get with every order, because candy can make anyone smile even on a bad day.  These sliders are like no other.  They are amazingly filling, great tasting, with fresh ingredients and cooked to perfection.  The texture of the patties are perfect, and their sweet rolls that they split into a bun are yummy.  I love the slider truck with all my heart, and they inspired me to try something different every once in awhile.  if you think that this food truck is like others, serving plain food fast and greasy, you have it all wrong.  They serve unique, what I consider gourmet style sliders on the fly. With great prices and service, and the fun crowd and fun times trying to find the truck daily, this is a stop that I'm willing to drive across town to line up for any day of the week.  Line up soon and get your slider fix today, before the food runs out.  The crowds are a plenty, but the specials may not last till you're ready to show up.  That's the fun in this truck--finding it, lining up, talking to people, and then finally eating your addiction.  Get it hot and fast with a smile.  What more could you ask for?  As for myself, nothing.  They are everything that I need when I want my burger fix.  Thanks for the inspiration, slider truck.",

    "text": "How can you not love the Slidin' Thru? The food truck that really jump started the food truck craze here in Vegas has good reason to be one of the most popular food trucks.  Firstly I'd like to point out how friendly the staff are. They're always upbeat and energetic and I love that they give out fist bumps like candy. On more than one occasion I've ordered a slider that they ran out of supplies for but to make up for it they gave me a coupon for a free slider. Now that's customer service! The Pep Pep, Yaya, and Barby aren't just gibbersih, they're the unique names given to a few of their unique sliders. Ranging from the vegatarian eggplant Caprese to the caramlized, bbq sauce, fried onion strip, and bacon covered Barby. My personal favorite being the gyro-esque Yaya with feta cheese, red wine vinaigrette, and tzatziki sauce. They have a slider to suit any palette and they are suprisingly consistant. Everytime I've ordered a slider it tasted just like my previous visit's sliders. I have never witnessed a badly made slider at Slidin' Thru. Last time I was there the prices were $3 for one slider, $5 for two, and $7 for three. Its in line with the average food truck price. Not a crazy amount of food for the money but its more than reasonable considering the quality. Now, I've tried sliders at a few restaurants and I have to say that sliders from Slidin' Thru are plainly put, better. Maybe it's because restaurants don't put enough focus and effort into their sliders or maybe because Slidin' Thru just makes a mean slider. All I know is that I'll be coming back, and often. As a bit of a side note, they have soda bottles that use real sugar instead of this high fructose corn syrup crap. You really can taste the difference and its delicious.",

The Sweet Potato Fries were outstanding. They were sprinkled with cinnamon sugar and I felll in love.   The burgers were all very good and unique. There is definitly something for everyone and it is nice having bugers that are a little 'out of the box' when it comes to unique topping combos. I'm not a big fan of eggplant but I destroyed the Caprese.  The guys that run the truck have a great sense of humor and seemed really appreciative for all the customers that were seeking them out. My only gripe is that these are totally not sliders but mini-burgers. Maybe it's because I'm from the midwest surrounded by White Catle and other joints that steam the hell out of their sliders BUT these are still tasty little treats that are worth a vist.",

    "text": "I had Slider Truck on my to do list for several months. I am an amazing procrastinator and I put off several opportunities to track down the Slider Truck. That is until it came to Sunrise Coffee one evening earlier this month. I love Sunrise Coffee so for me it was the perfect opportunity to finally check out and cross the Slider Truck off my \"to do list.\"  As a comic Book geek, I loved the comic book  truck design.  At the time I went there was only about 12 or 15 people in line and it moved along fairly quickly considering everything was made to order.   I ordered 2 Eggplant Caprese sliders and Sweet Potato fries and my friend ordered 3 sliders (2 Pep Pep and a Barbie). My veggie sliders were very good.  My friend really enjoyed his sliders a lot too. I would give the food a solid 4 stars. I am giving Slider Truck 5 stars for the cool design of the truck, the fact that they serve Mexican Coca-Cola and not  Pepsi products,  and the super rad personalities who work on the truck. It's an added bonus to order from a food truck and not worry about getting the swine flu or hepatitis. Clean is good as are veggie options.  I was feeling pretty special for being greeted with a fist bump until Krystal C. mentioned she received a fist bump as well. I guess the Slider Truck is in the business of making everyone feel special.   Very good food, veggie options and great people are all reasons I will be giving my business to the Slider Truck again. I'm a fan!",

Zoe: I get \"The Captain's Order\" because it has everything on it that I like...tomatoes, arugula, crispy bacon, feta cheese and sauteed onions. It has a balsamic sauce and it is the bomb! I love feta! La: I get the Pep Pep, The Barbie or  The Pulled Porkie. Ok, The Pep Pep..your basic bacon cheeseburger only better..crispy bacon and yummy cheddar and I don't know what the sauce is, but it's good! The Barbie has caramelized jalapenos (yum!), bacon (always yum), cheddar, crunchy onion crunchy things and BBQ sauce. Sooooooo good! The Pulled Porkie is super tender pulled pork, caramelized jalapenos and BBQ sauce. I want one right now! I wonder if Mom will take us to find the truck if I use the puppy dog face??? Oh yeah... sweet potato fries! 'Nuf said!",

    "text": "4.5 stars but I give them the roundup since I can't give 4.5.  Come on Yelp!    Been here a few times in the last couple of weeks after trying it for the first time.  I have never once been in any kind of line waiting to order, so I am not sure why some people complain about the wait or lines.  Never has there been even 1 person waiting in front of me.  I have had numerous burgers here, including the plain jane, which is just a little burger with ketchup, to their more esoteric varieties.  They have a mystery slider every day which is a special, usually more upscale slider.  Among those has been the proscuitto, mozzarella and pineapple slider, and the chicken, pineapple teriyaki slider.  Both of those were delicious.  They also have a very tasty bbq slider called the Barby, with crispy onions and a good bbq sauce.  Also, one of the most important parts for me...they have pellet ice.  In the ice machine, they offer the pellet or nugget ice, like at Sonic or Cafe Rio, which for me MAKES the drink.  Some people would not get it, but there are definitely others who know what I am talking about.  A star for that alone.  The staff and service are always super friendly and nice.  I know someone mentioned that they treat you like you are special but you aren't, but to me that is not really what its about.  They are friendly and welcoming and act like they appreciate your business and your spending your money there.  That is all I want from a business.  I am not looking for some kind of sincere bond of friendship.   The place is a little loud and it is definitely hipster with the Buddy Holly glasses and sometimes obnoxious music choices, but it is not THAT bad.    Now, onto price.  I know some people complain that it is SOOOO expensive.  Well, the sliders are a decent size.  I personally usually eat a 1lb burger plus fries at Fuddruckers, and here I usually get 4 sliders and some fries.  When my wife and I came here for dinner one night, we had 6 sliders, 2 orders of fries and drinks and it was about $28.  Now, for me, in the context of my wife and I both eating dinner and leaving full and satisfied for $28, I am pretty happy.  I mean, you COULD go to \"Uncle Carl\" and buy a million cheap nasty burgers with the coupons from your mailbox, but why would you?  I mean, you can hardly say some cheap processed fast food burger is the same as a burger topped with a big slice of proscuitto, mozzarella and balsamic dressing?  I mean, how much should that cost?  20 cents?  $15 bucks each for a filling dinner is good for me.  Also, its not like getting 1 normal burger is the same as getting 3 or 4 completely different ones with tastes like chicken and pineapple, and bbq pork, greek feta pork tacos, etc etc.  There has to be some kind of price premium for that.  Now, I agree the Plain Jane could be a bit cheaper (it IS just a patty, ketchup and bun for $2.50), but overall I think it is a decent value, if not only slightly overpriced.    Overall, I like the place.  The burgers have always been tasty, I have never had a stale bun, and I never have a slider where the meat inside is so small that I get only bun in every bite.  As I said, it could be a LITTLE cheaper, it could be a little less hipster and they could turn down the sometimes terrible music a bit, but the food has been very good each time I go, the service is super friendly and they have a large variety of sliders, so I am happy.",

The guy at the window was very friendly and had a lot of energy, which is probably good because that line gets really long. It was a good thing that I got there early because the line just got longer and longer.  I recommend that people go on their site to find out exactly when and where the slider truck will be. Their site also has their menu with a description of each slider.  The sliders are decently priced and decent sizes. I think an average eater can stomach about two and feel comfortably full. They serve their pop in old-school glass bottles. Love it. They also serve candy with your meal which is so cute.  I love the Slider Truck and can't wait 'til I catch it again!",

Maybe it's because there's no slider joints in Vegas, there isn't even a White Castle. At other slider joints (Not in Vegas) for seven bucks you can get 4 sliders, fries, and a drink for that much money and the burgers are bigger than these too! Not to mention they taste better. Anyway Don't Believe the Hipster Hype. I went to Fukuburger and it was way better than Slidin' Thru, way more flavor than this joint.",

Don't take this to mean they are bad they just aren't my thing as they were a little too sweet.  As usual the service was super friendly and fun.

Super friendly service and didn't take long at all, glad we got there early :) We got a combo with 5 sliders, an order of sweet tater fries and a Coke in a bottle, yup a glass bottle! In no particular order we tried the Yaya which was kind of like a gyro/Greek thing going for it, quite good! The Pep Pep which was good but ranks on the bottom of our 5 and simply due to being more of a traditional burger. The eggplant which was good but not my favorite. I'd definitely say the Porkie and Barbie were my 2 favorites. The sweet potato fries were really good too and big enough to share. In order for me would probably be: 1. Barbie 2. Porkie 3. Yaya 4. Eggplant Caprese 5. Pep Pep We highly recommend you check out Slider Truck when they're in your neighborhood!",

    "text": "Have been wanting to try the truck out and finally got to catch up with them at the Powder and Sun location. I wanna start off by giving major props to Ric for bringing street food to this town. He is a cool dude with a dream, and now the Slider Truck is its own phenomena.  Got to the truck about an hour after they opened up shop and there was a small line and some people hanging out in the parking lot waiting for their orders. I checked the website to see what burgers they would have that day and was excited to try the three they had: Barbie, Porkie, and Pep Pep.   After waiting for my food I was so excited to finally eat and it was worth the wait. I think my favorite was the Porkie, I love BBQ so it hi the spot. The Barbie was also great with the jalapenos and crispy onion straws. I would make the patties a little thinner and a little less done, but hey everyone has a different opinion on what is medium well and medium rare and everyone wants it done differently so the guys have to make them to appeal to huge lines they are getting.  The thing I think people need to remember with the truck is this:  1. They are still newborns. They have only been open for like a month and they want all feed back good or bad, no matter how small. They want to improve, most places don't give a damn what the customers think. They openly say \"tell me what you think!\"  2. It's a service truck cooking made to order burgers. They want to do it right, and right when you order it. Cooking is an art so don't rush the 3-4 dudes cramped in the truck.   3. If you don't want to wait or chill in the parking lot this place is not for you. And there is so much buzz around it there are going to be crowds wanting five burgers at a time.   4. Use the Internet to your advantage. Their weekly schedule is on their site and twitter and facebook, so you need a computer to find where they are so take the time to see what the guys are cooking that day so you don't drive across town for a burger you don't want. Because someone else will eat it.  Ric and the guys are nice and deliver great customer service, the food is yummy, and the experience is a new, and a great one for our city. Let's just enjoy some good food.",

    "text": "I heard about this place from Mix 94.1 FM host Mercedes (of Mark & Mercedes in the morning- I listen to this show every weekday morning BTW). It sounded really good plus Mercedes was talking about how excited that the truck was visiting their building vicinity (almost like a child on Christmas morning). I saw this truck at First Friday the last two months, but wasn't sure it was the same one (it was). My husband's uncle also said that they have really good sliders (also said that if you're a newbie, they rock the truck). So, it was a group of five of us. Everyone got sliders but I (not my husband) only had the sweet potato fries. Before you ask, \"Why not?\"- my husband is on a weight maintenance plan (he lost 110 pounds and has kept it off for 3 + years- it was not a cheat day for him- my husband told me to remind me to make that FF a cheat day for him, because he really wanted to try the sliders). I practice moderation.   Anyway, the sweet potato fries were in a paper bag, a good amount/size (enough for two people to share), sprinkled with cinnamon- mmm, yummy. I love sweet potato fries- anytime that's one of the options on the menu, I get them. They were slightly crispy but not mushy (I hate that- if you get the frozen kind to prepare at home, it's tricky getting them to crisp, anyway, I digress.) The cinnamon was unexpected but gave it a nice flavor boost. I didn't think that it needed dipping sauce like ketchup or ranch. I didn't finish them- took the rest home.   Our friends (two first-timers) liked the sliders- good size, fluffy buns- looked like hawaiian rolls my husband commented, and reasonably priced- $7 for three sliders (the other options around were rather pricey, for example $10 for BBQ). A good sign is that they were all kinda quiet, while eating- kinda like that Carl Jr's commercial \"Don't bother me- I'm eating.\" There are a few variations- about four or five options on the sliders. Yup, I really want to try 'em for myself, the next time we're at FF, assuming that they'll be there (here's hoping). From the looks of the long line, it was a good sign that this was a solid reputable place to get food. Since it's a truck, no formal seating, of course, so some of us stood, while some of us used the curb.",

Food trucks are a bit of a recent phenomenon here in the valley, and Slidin Thru is one of the trucks trying to capture that popularity like what you would see in Los Angeles.  My personal favorite slider is the Barby, a western style slider with bacon, bbq sauce and crispy onion strings.  They make each order fresh, so it does take awhile, but again, that's a good thing.  They also have mystery sliders which vary at every location.  The one time I got a mystery slider, the pastraminator (a slider loaded with cooked pastrami), I was simply amazed.  The fries are great too, and they put some special seasoning on them which tastes delicious.  You can tell that the owner cares greatly about his customers.  Customer service is top notch, and he frequently communicates to people via twitter and facebook.  That alone is one of the reasons that keeps me coming back.  Since they opened their permanent 24 hours headquarters they cut back a bit on their truck hours and locations.  I have yet to go to the HQ, but I do prefer actually driving to the truck.  I like the adventure of actually finding the truck, and eating inside your car or on the curb.  When I actually visit the HQ, I will post a review on that page.  For what it's worth, you owe it to yourself, local or tourist, to make at least one stop at the Slidin Thru truck.  And it's a mobile truck that belongs to our city :).  PROS: One of the first food trucks here in Vegas Amazing customer service and interaction Reasonable prices Delicious food Usually touch each area of the city every week  CONS: You can be there awhile with long lines and the fact that they make your food to order.  But then again, not necessarily a bad thing :).  THE VERDICT:  I am addicted to this place!",

Today a co-worker and I visited their food truck since it was right down the street from the office. Service was good. The cashier was friendly. I was dissappointed that they do not offer their specialty fries from the truck but no big deal. I went ahead and order my pulled porky that I love so much and sweet potato fries. The fries were good. The pulled porky on the other hand is no longer anything I would ever order again. Another reviewer had mentioned the soggy bun and I completely agree. The porky consisted of tasteless pulled pork (they used to crisp it a bit) drowning in bbq sauce and a few chopped jalapenos which were definitely not carmelized.   I only give two stars due to the girl who took my order. I am not certain what happened to their quality but I do not recommend.",

Finally I decided to keep track of their schedule and noticed they were going to be a block away from my Las Vegas office.   I ended up mixing and matching the sandwiches with a side of the sweet potato fries. Two of the burgers and one of the pork sliders. All of them were good. The sauces definitely made these bites worth the cost. They are a little bit pricier but these kids have something down so I have no problem supporting them and their endeavors.  Track them down before the Vegas heat gets too hot to be waiting around outside!",

Overpriced,  $2.50-4.00, for what I estimate is a 1 ounce patty burger, (do the math, that would mean the equivalent of a 1/4 lb burger would be $10.00-16.00, a 1/2 lb burger would be $20.00-32.00. At a hole in the wall building, in a strip mall)?  2. Atmosphere not to my liking,( like dining in a cartoon strip), but that's a personal taste.  3. Food.taste was alright, nothing to write home about.  For what I paid for the burger, fries and drink I could have had a 1/4 lb burger, fries & drink, that tasted better, at any number of restaurants in town.  I don't mind paying for good food, this isn't it, I won't be back.  This was written when they were located at Durango and Centennial.",

Nothing was said like \"we are sorry to keep you waiting\". Last 20 minutes before opening the cook was just walking around smoking a cigarette and texting on his phone. If they don't understand the concept of time they should just say: \"we will open some time today\"  The food: Sliders were good but the pulled porky slider had a completely soaked bottom bun that was falling apart and making a mess. I opened a box 20 seconds after I got it so maybe they should use better buns or toast them or something.  The value for money: they didn't have any special offers like 3for$7 that you can see on some pictures here. They charged $3 for each tiny slider that you need 3-4 to feel something in your stomach. In N Out burger will take the 2nd place when compared to them but will no doubt win the value for money contest.",

They are considering keeping it on the \"secret menu.\"  OMG, I hope they do!  The taco (which I think they served at the Street Food Throwdown) is pork, tzatziki, feta, hot sauce, crispy onion strips, and carmelized jalapenos, all on a warm corn tortilla.  It is absolutely the best!  It's $5, but it is totally worth it.  A ton a pork.  Maybe they could make a burrito! :)  Also, they have this super fun #SuperSecretSevenDaysofSlidinThruXmas promotion going on.  Everyday, til Christmas I guess, they post a link on Twitter that gives you a secret phrase to get a discount.  Say the secret phrase, the whole truck yells it back at you, and you get some free food.  Pretty sweet!  If you don't want to join Twitter, you can see all their Twitter messages on their website - <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fslidinthru.com%2F&s=1f66e2ee8cf2c93215bbb9a918b3933bb8903fd38e8ec70b91b528f0e04f3c61\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">slidinthru.com</a>  I still don't like the fries.  I got the sweet potato fries with salt instead of cinnamon and sugar, and they still weren't doing it for me.  I don't know why because rarely meet a fried starch that I don't like.  But the taco is seriously craveable.  Give it a try and if you like it, tell them to keep it!  PLEASE!",

Its in a pretty easy corner off Durango which you can see when you've just past the hospital and the 215.    Looks like a good selection of burger options, but its our first time so we went for some Plain Jane's and a couple Porky burgers.  The Porkys are great.  The Plain Janes -- 2 stars,   After biting into one you say to yourself \"How much did I pay for this #%@&?\"   This place is EXPENSIVE for what you'd expect to be about a 35 cent burger.    I hope they can stick around long enough to come up with a Dollar Value Menu.   Tried the sweet potato hot tots.  Tastes more like cinnamon glue.  Brought some home for others to try and still the same reaction -- tasteless for sweet potato.    Next time I'm going to try the eggplant and the other choices.  Hopefully by then, they'll drop their prices on the plain stuf.",

    "text": "I heart this place for many reasons, one of which is that it's close by (super cool places are few and far between way up here in the north).  Also, the restaurant has a bright, fun, colorful atmosphere that is very fitting for all the bright, fun, colorful employees serving up your dinner.  The menu is a little bigger than the truck's and there are still plenty of fist bumps to be had!  I came here late on their opening night and it was still packed regardless of the fact that it was way past a reasonable dinner time.  Just goes to show you that everyone enjoys themselves a mini burg.  Although I'm sure the employees had been slammed all day, they were still as friendly as ever.  We ordered our caprese sliders and just stuck with the regular fries.  Maybe we'd try some of the new menu items at a later date.  The caprese sliders were just as good as always- ever generous with the mozzarella and eggplant and ever extra yummy from the basil and balsamic reduction.  The fries may not be the best in the world, but they are certainly really good and recommended.  Now, I was considering giving Slidin' Thru NW three stars like the food truck.  I think the price is a little high and it makes me sad.  But I am bumping it up to four stars.  Why?  Well, since I have a fun place to sit and enjoy my food, I think that deserves a little more love.  Secondly, I came back and had the barby fries.  Imagine some of the greatest things in life - cheese, barbeque sauce, crispy fried onions.  Now imagine these things all piled on top of french fries and sprinkled with a little bit of jalapeno.  They may wreck your diet, but do you really need to lose those last two pounds?  I think not.  This is definitely a fun little place to come hang out at.  Perfect for getting a snack or a full meal.  Perfect for a group of friends to hang out, or perfect for bringing your kids to get them their own lil' burg.  I still think the price is a little high on some items but fine if you don't stop by every single day.  Just be careful.  After you have the barby fries for yourself, you might start to consider making this place a part of your daily routine.",

    "text": "FINALLY TRIED THEM!!!   I had family in town and they had no interest in visiting the strip so we planned to do tons of local things, this was one of them!   Since out first attempt at the sliders was a complete failure and coupled with the fact that I was super anxious to try the sliders, I planned to be at the location listed, Spring Valley Park on 5/8/2010, at least 30 mins ahead. OK, not to sound like a total geek, we took our pup to the dog park while we waited, so it was like a 2fer, pup gets to play, while we wait for the munchies :)   I felt like I was 5 years old again, when I saw the slider truck pulling up, I was SO excited, ridiculously so! We get into line and the Slider Guy started setting up. He was really nice and even asked us how we heard about him, I said \"Yelp\" he was so excited when I said that because, well, I guess Yelp is where he gets a lot of his business, GO YELP! :) I also think that the truck fits the personality of the slider truck guy. When you meet him, you'll know what I mean...   So, you place your order, wait for your number to be called and find a place to sit, luckily we were at a park, so there were plenty of park benches to park our rears. We ordered a total of 12 sliders, for 3 people, which btw is too much for 3 people, I only ate 2, my son had 3 and my husband had 4 so we went home with 3 left over. Pep peps, capreses, and I don't remember what the others were because, well, I got too full before I could eat them lol and my brother ordered a bag of fries for all of us to share. As small as the sliders are, they are SOOO filling. They're all full of flavor and everything is made with such quality. The fries are seasoned and weren't as bad as some of the reviews that I've seen.  So I have a couple suggestions:  1.The sliders all have such tasty sauces and kinda get all over your hands, all he has are wet naps, so bring a few napkins it'll assist with the clean up.  2. If you have no intention of sitting in your car or parking your booty on the curb to eat your food, I suggest that you bring some chairs. He provides the food and service, not really a place to sit. lol   REHEAT VALUE: My husband thought that they taste better the next day, personally, I don't. I have no palette and he does, um, let me know who's right :)",

    "text": "Ah, if only I had known you sooner...  Finally managed an encounter with these guys when they showed up at Ethel M for a Saturday afternoon event. Redeemed my $5-for-$10 LivingSocial deal with no hassle (bought back on Jan 12... yep, it's been a little bit of wait). Placed my order, waited not too long, and brought it home because I didn't feel like sitting around.  On the way home, I tried the sweet potato fries. They're dusted with sugar and (obviously) pretty sweet. I probably would've rather had normal fries if I had known how sweet it was, but to their credit, they did a great job on these.  Upon reaching home, I popped open my styrofoam slider box. My first slider was the Pulled Porky. Holy. Crap. This is absolutely the best pulled pork and BBQ Sauce that I've ever had (sorry, Ben's BBQ). The pork was so tender and juicy, and the sauce was perfect. I didn't even remember that it had jalapeno because I didn't taste anything spicy, so don't let it scare you off. It's one of the less expensive options and definitely the yummiest.  Next up: Pep Pep. Pretty good. Flavor profile isn't anything groundbreaking. It seemed like the meat on my slider was a little smaller than the mini-patty on my remaining slider. I decided to pop some sweet potato fries for this guy, and they actually made it a little more interesting.  Final slider was the Captain's Order. This was really yummy, and it was mostly due to the balsamic reduction. Not too sour or sweet and brings something different to the table. I didn't notice the feta cheese too much but it probably helped. Don't eat sweet potato fries with this slider or you'll regret it.  Overall, it's not perfect,  and I still remember my empty stomach from my first attempt to find them, but these guys are a good thing. I hope that they'll grace the streets of Henderson more often, but I'm sure I'll revisit them soon anyway and chow down on some Pulled Porkies.",

The truck from the outside was also not clean.  No thanks and we left. Health dept needs to check it out.",

From the fist-bump at the drive thru window to the amazingly fresh slider and fries I ate, everything was a perfect 10. I got a porky slider with sweet potato fries and a soda. The porky slider was always sold out when I caught up with the slider truck so I had to try it out. The meat was so moist and smoky while the jalapeno relish added a spicy bite. The fries were crispy, fresh and plentiful. It was a great fast food experience altogether and I can't wait to go back and try more things.",

If you want to say silly things and earn rewards like Slidin Thru on facebook and they will keep you posted.  I had the Barby and Plain Jane slider. The Barby had caramelized jalapenos, melted cheddar,crispy fried onion strips, bacon and BBQ sauce. It was packed with sweet, spicy flavor. The Plain Jane may only have had cheese and ketchup but it was still very tasty! Jon and I also shared the Barby Fries which has the same ingredients as the burger minus the meat.   We ended the meal with dessert. We thought that there was a Smore Sundae but they actually put them on their sweet potato fries. The guy behind the counter was nice enough to make us a make shift sundae. We had vanilla ice cream with Graham Cracker sprinkles and it was all topped with chocolate sauce. It's nice to know that they like to go the extra mile for customer service because there are so many places that slack in this area.",

The fries were not too salty, it was perfectly seasoned. The only thing about their sliders, it is a little pricey running from $3.00 to $3.50 per a slider. But I can say that the sliders are pretty filling.   I love the artwork inside, it makes it different from other fast food places. The people were very friendly and apologized to the people that have been waiting a while for their food.",

They sold out of sweet potato fries, so I had to settle for regular, which are excellent.  I'd like to give real stars in the heads of some people who came with orders for large numbers of sliders.  It made the wait quite long, and being about 100 degrees outside, it was a tad uncomfortable with just one small tree with shade.  I will find this truck again and go earlier.  Perhaps I'll find it far away from another office building.    The good thing about this was that I initially heard of where the truck would be from a Nevada State Museum Facebook post.  I had my sandwich and did as they suggested.  I went to museum after lunch.",

When I walked in I felt like I stepped into the pages of an old school comic book. The menu isn't much but is everything you need. When we stepped up to order, I was immediately gestured for a fist bump.. I felt like the new girl who was accepted with open arms by the nerds in high school. I love nerds!   The barby was so yummy and I was feeling adventurous so I asked for the mystery sandwich. When the food came I quickly realized the mystery was the famed Porky Tacos (an off menu secret item). Already sampling off menu items on my first day? This definitely made me smile. The tacos were delicious and although spicy, it was just the kick they needed.  For desert we tried the Smores.. sweet potato fries topped with ice cream, hot fudge, and melted marshmallows. It was a little slice of heaven. The best part of the Slidin' Thru experience is that it's right down the street and I can relive it anytime. No long lines at a food truck :)",

    "text": "I have always been enamored by the food truck culture, but with my busy schedule I find it challenging to search them out. With that said, I was pretty stoked when I learned that our community center on base is organizing Food Truck Fridays. We had such a good turnout that 1 of the 3 trucks ran out of food early on. Fortunately we still were able to get some grub from Slidin' Thru, which was what I really came out there for.  What I love about their business is their website. I think websites for food trucks are their most essential tool, as it has to be frequently updated and easy enough to navigate. So from their online menu, I already know what I wanted to try: Plain Jane, Pulled Porky, and the Barby. I placed my order and was told about a 15-20 minute wait. I was a bit disappointed that their pricing is a little bit different. I thought you would get 3 sliders for $7 based on previous Yelp reviews, but it's actually $3 for each slider now.   I got the food and was instantly underwhelmed. Zero presentation was put into the sliders which looked, well, sloppy. I can understand if they were busy, but there were only 2 people ahead of me waiting when I ordered. The sliders were good. Maybe a little bit too much BBQ sauce for my personal taste, but the Pulled Porkie easily came out on top.   Maybe I'm being a little bit critical here but I was really hoping for a much better experience. It's my first visit, so I would still like to try their other sliders in the future. There's just a lot more food trucks to be experienced in Vegas so for now I'm moving on.",

As soon as he got off work we rallied and rushed over to their spot for the night.  We stood in line for over 45 minutes and left empty handed. Not only that, we were insulted by the sheer greediness of some people.  It was happy hour; $1 everything. There was a big crowd but everyone was being pleasant, politely waiting their turn to gobble some slider goodness. Since they were at Sunrise Coffee, people were dipping into the shop and getting coffee while waiting.   After 45 minutes, the slider guys announce that they \"have 40, count 'em FORTY sliders left! Don't be greedy, please, and there'll be enough for everyone!! :D\"  We see an old woman leave with at least 9 sliders and a big snot-eating grin. And then- \"SOLD OUT!\"  Within TWO customers, they went through FORTY sliders. Whuuuuuuuuhhhh?!  Fact is, we probably wouldn't have been able to get a slider even if people only ordered 2-3 each. Any time you wait that long, it can be annoying, but I'm not really upset about leaving empty handed. We were all insulted by the fact that as soon as they announced the shortage, some greedy individuals felt the need to swipe up ALL of the remaining sliders for themselves. Obviously, all of us waiting in line are there because we love the Slider truck- and those greedy few hoarded them all for themselves? Really? REALLY?! Thanks, people, for crapping all over my friend's experience & ensuring that his first impression of the Slider truck is NOT positive.   Some of the shimmer has been smudged for me as well. I don't think I'm going to be able to find the motivation to wait in those lines with the knowledge that people so greedy are scattered amongst our midst.   I'm over it. My friend, who didn't even get to try to food, will most likely never be back because of this. Greedy fools ruining the fun for everyone, I tell ya!",

So far, I've had the Caprese, Pep Pep, Yaya,  mystery shroom  slider, hash & egg slider, sweet potato fries, s'more sweet potato fries, & a special cheesecake of the day. Everything I had there was all good!    My favorites has to be the Caprese because I love eggplants & the Yaya because of the whole concoction of the feta cheese, onions, tomatoes & tzatziki sauce.   Super bomb & great price! Just one of these slider w/ those yummy sweet potato fries is more than enough to fill me up.    It's cool that they always have a new mystery slider. Everytime I see their tweets about the mystery slider of the day, my mouth waters.   I like how they have coke bottles that use real sugar instead of the high fructose corn syrup. The high fructose corn syrup gives me a stomach ache for some reason. So it's a major plus that they carry those pure sugar cane cokes. Definitely come back to try the other sliders I haven't tried.

    "text": "So I've seen the chatter about these wonderful sliders for some time now.  Finally decided to get the office team together and try these babies when the truck was closer to our side of town.  Today was the day and from what I read, I encouraged the office team to go early or suffer the long lines in the hot sun.  While the menu was somewhat limited, my problem was trying to pick which slider I wanted...I could not decide and ended going with the Pep Pep, the Ya Ya, the Captain's Order and a Porkie.  Accompanied by a nice warm bag of seasoned fries and a bottled water to balance out the healthiness of this long-awaited meal.  Dear God, the wait was so worth it as I bit into my first Pep Pep with crispy bacon, sauteed onion, cheese and a special sauce that drizzled down the corner of my mouth. The Ya Ya was equally as delicious with its red onion, feta and white wine vinaigrette sauce. The Porkie was tasty with just the right amount of slow-roasted pulled pork, caramelized jalapenos and a touch of BBQ sauce.  But I must say, the Captain's Order has to be my ultimate favorite.  Who would ever contemplate pairing an Angus beef burger with roma tomatoes, arugula, bacon, feta cheese and balsamic reduction on a small, toasted bun?  That slider was insane!   There are more items on their menu, and now I can't wait to try the others the next time the slider truck rolls into my neighborhood.  You can follow them online to learn the schedule ahead.    Again, plan to get there early, or the agony of watching others chow down on these delicious burgers while you wait will be painful!",

The sweet potato fries are my favorite, while they probably aren't as healthy as they sound, I still try to convince myself that they're healthier than regular fries (denial at it's finest).  I have to say that the food isn't what makes me a recurring customer, it is definitely the whole \"food truck\" experience. Every time I have slider truck I am always meeting up with friends old and new. Plus, you are bound to make friends with people in line since there always is one! If you own a business, slider tuck is a great place to network believe it or not. I also take my dog almost every time, it's hard to find places to eat out that are \"dog friendly\". I definitely recommend taking a friend with you so that the wait time goes by a lot quicker.   The best part of the whole slider truck \"experience\" is the customer service!! Ric and crew are always upbeat and happy to serve you! Ric even knows me and my dog by name, I don't think I can go anywhere else in the city where someone will personally greet me, let alone my dog! The guys had an off night once where the grill would not work, Ric made up for it and was still able to get us our food even though we were one of the last to order before the grill breakdown.   I really hate to say the truck has any cons but unfortunately it does. But only one and i'm sure the guys didn't know what they were in for.  The wait time can be extremely long if you don't come early and sadly if you arrive later in the schedule you might miss out. My advice would be to get there early!!! The slider truck has such a huge following that the line can get 20-30 people deep in no time, I think a stationary Slider JointTM should be soon to come!  In the end the slider truck is a great spot when you just want to be casual and get some \"fresh off the grill\" grub. The guys will always have a smile on their face and you are bound to meet some interesting people in line. Check our slider truck at a stop near you!",

    "text": "I had my first taste of the Slider Truck at First Friday and both were great.  As we all know when everyone you know raves about something you're a little skeptical but I'm glad to say that Slider Truck met and exceeded any and all expectations.    I ordered the Pep Pep, Pulled Porkie, and Sweet Potato Fries.  The menu does vary according the day but everything is still made to order which is convenient for those of who love flavor but like it done our way.  All the ingredients were fresh and even the buns were filled with flavor.  The dessert for me was enjoying crisp and fresh Sweet Potato Fries with cinnamon.  Did I mention I had all of this for a sweet and delicious bargain of $8, certainly the best bang for your buck in town.",

    "text": "FUN. TASTY.   Usually, those two adjectives wouldn't go together.  Fun, I think peter piper's pizza or Joe's Crab  Shack.  Tasty, I think hole-in-the-wall-dirty-poor-service.  However, the Slider Truck combined both!  The atmosphere: The guys working there were fist bumpin' friendly and made the atmosphere so festive.  Given that it was for the food truck battle and the atmosphere was totally festive, but I think they have the fist bumpin' friendly as their MO.  They even have the fist bump logo wrapped on the truck!  The food: Though there were a tons of people on line to order, we probably got our food within 10 minutes.   1.  Pipin' hot fries simply seasoned with salt and pepper. 2.  Barby - cheddar, jalapeno, crispy fried onion strips, bbq sauce and BACOooooon.  Fantastic flavor blast of salty and tangy with texturegasm of the crispy fried onion strips. 3.  Pep Pep - your classic burger of BLT+sauteed onions + super sauce.  It's like your best classic In-N-Out burger fun sized and flavor amplified. 4.  Captain's Order - tomato, arugula, BACooooon, feta cheese and balsamic vinegar reduction.  this was my least favorite because I have a bias against the balsamic reduction being too sweet.  Conclusion: Fukuburger has some mad competition.  Yum burgers.  Try them all.",

    "text": "After eating here more times than I can count on my fingers and toes, I decided to finally write a review. Not being a huge fan of burgers, I was hesitant about the slider truck. Little did I know it would become one of my favorite places to eat in Vegas.  Let's start with the different types of burgers.  Barbie A BBQ burger  topped with onion crisps, bbq sauce, and jalapenos. This is probably my favorite. The slight spice from the jalapenos makes this amazing. The BBQ sauce pops because of it.  Pulled Porkie A BBQ pulled pork slider with jalapenos in the sauce.  Delicious pork. Same sauce as the Barbie. Again with the jalapenos. So good.  Pep Pep A classic burger with lettuce, tomato, cheese, bacon, onion and a \"special\" sauce. Get this if your looking for a classic cheese burger, with an extra touch of flavor.  YaYa Kind of like a gyro. Burger that has a really tasty tzatziki sauce with lettuce onion and tomato.  Captains  A burger with bacon, arugula, tomato, feta cheese, onion and balsamic. This one is also delicious.  Eggplant Caprese This is the only vegetarian choice on the menu.  Eggplant, tomato, mozzarella, balsamic, and basil. Very fresh tasting. The eggplant has been huge on multiple occasions.  Burgers are 1 for $3, 2 for $5, or 3 for $7. Drinks - $2 Fries - $2 - Sweet Potato or Regular (Standard fries)  These burgers are not tiny. 3 are more than filling. You need to go to their website to get a schedule for the week.  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.slidinthru.com&s=222b59c633729fd0ec8e6727765781cdf5aa63f26d9203e31c5edd96795311be\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">slidinthru.com</a>  They only take CASH. No cards.  All of the burgers are excellent. The staff is extremely friendly. Go here NOW!",

However, husband and I got to taste the porkie, which ended up being both of our favorites over the burger sliders.  I don't like pulled pork sandwiches but this was the best I've ever tasted.  I think there were green chilis in the BBQ sauce or something that made it over the top.  We're coming back next week and you'd better have those damn french dips on the menu again or I'll cry until you serve them to us.",

Would've been the best accident ever, except that the guy in front of me got the last burger. I've been wanting to go back ever since, and finally got around to it yesterday. Now that I've tasted what I've been missing out on for all these months, I'm hooked. I ordered their hash slider and sweet potato fries. I've always been a fan of the concept of sweet potato fries, but have only had one good experience with them before now. They do it right! I just wish they had smaller take-out containers, because when I got my slider home, it was completely demolished. Still tasted great, though!",

My friend and I ordered and shared all six of the choices (I don't count the Plain Jane).  They were all very delicious!  The guy taking orders was very friendly which is very important.  I thought that both kinds of fries were great and I love Sweet Potato Fries!    I read some of the other reviews before I wrote mine and I think some of you people need to get over yourselves.  Somebody giving a bad review because someone ordered two dozen sliders?  Really?  That's ridiculous.  I will agree with most of the other reviewers in concerns with the wait time.  It really didn't bother me but I think these guys should throw some more burgers down when they see a line.  I just think that the food really outweighed the negative of the wait time and people should think about this when reviewing.   I will definitely find this place again!",

However, today was a little different. It was at a nearby location and within my lunch break. I wanted to fall to my knees and weep tears of joy when I got there. I finally made it.  I ordered 2 Pep Peps with a side of sweet potato fries. Accompanying this meal, was a classic glass bottle of Coke.  The sliders were rather small in diameter, but the thickness in the patties made up for it. All in all , fun sized morsels of deliciousness. The sweet potato fries tasted a bit like tiny churros with the cinnamon sugar sprinkled on it. Not bad. I don't think it went too well with the burgers though. It was more like a dessert to eat afterwards. Two sliders should be enough to fill a small hunger; Maybe order three if you arrive hungry.  The food wasn't good enough for me to go out of the way for, but good enough for me to drop by whenever it's around. They offer super friendly service and a unique change of pace for the lunch scene.   Mad props to the Slider Truck! You've got yourself a new fan.",

    "text": "I'd give the SliderTruck a 4 and 1/2.  They lose 1/2 a star for the wait (45 minutes in my case).  However, there is a bit of a disclaimer stating the sliders are cooked to order.  Here goes.  So I was actually planning on hitting up the Fukuburger truck tonight with a big order for my buddies at work... but that truck was 3 hours late.  I follow both on Twitter and remembered Slidin Thru was just up the road.  I get there and the line didn't seem too bad, but I guess there were a bunch of large orders (the ladies in front of me ordered TEN sliders for the two of them...my kind of girls)  Its finally my turn to get some window love and I'm left standing there for a couple of minutes before my order is taken... but its ok.  There are 3 guys working the truck and they all have that dorky but cute thing going on.  They were out of regular fries and the lady in front of me snagged the last orange Fanta in a glass bottle :(  I ordered 6 sliders (1 of everything on the menu; I figured, try the menu the first time so the next time I know which ones I REALLY liked) and an order of cinnamon sugar sweet potato fries. All to go.  The food came up quick, piping hot, and I knew everything was fresh because you could see them cooking it.  Surprisingly, the sliders were still warm when I got home about half an hour later.  Unfortunately, I got in a bit of a fender bender trying to exit the parking lot (some db orthodontist in a giant denali didnt see me in my little sebring convertible and I guess he had some emergency or something... whole other story)   Bottom Line: Expect to wait because the sliders are THAT good. The Barbie was good but not all it was hyped up to be. My favorites were the Eggplant Caprese and the Yaya (feta, tzatziki, white wine vinaigrette).  Sweet potato fries are a must (at least for me...)",

    "text": "I have been to the Slidin' Thru truck a few times since they started out and attended a party the Slidin' Thru was hired to do the catering for. I have found them to be inconsistent and not worth the money for what I got. They have about 8 different options for sliders and regular and sweet potato fries for sides. Each slider is $4 each and the mystery slider is $5. Their regular fries are really tasty, sprinkled with salt and pepper and come in a good sized portion.   Barby - Angus beef, American cheese, caramelized jalapeno, BBQ sauce and crispy onion strips. This slider sounded really good, but it looked nothing like the picture on the menu and it was missing a lot of what was supposed to be on it. There was just BBQ sauce and cheese on my slider and the meat was much smaller than the bun.    Plain Jane - Angus beef, American cheese and ketchup. This was the most simple of the sliders I had this last time and it was actually the tastiest. The meat had excellent flavor yet this tiny bite is too pricey at $4.   Pep Pep - Angus beef, American cheese, lettuce, tomato, sauteed onions, pickles and homemade super sauce. I liked this one and appreciated that it at least had the described toppings and was bigger than the other ones, but still not worth $4.   If you want a combo meal it's $10 for 2 sliders and side of fries. This combo meal didn't even include a drink and wasn't filling. There was only one person ahead of my in the ordering line yet I had to wait 25 minutes for my combo which seemed too long for 2 tiny burgers. You can check them out on social media if you are interested in where the truck will be next.",

    "text": "You'd think that waiting an hour for a burger would constitute said burger as being good. I mean, an hour means a lot of prep work; like crisping the bun, putting lettuce and sauce on the bun and then grilling a burger. Wait, that only takes five minutes. So what is it about this special lil guy that makes it take so long? Oh that's right, incompetence. Instead of grilling many burgs at a time and having a prep chef that handles the buns, they make every order one at a time. Yes, normally that's a great thing, when you're ordering steak or gourmet food. But if you're ordering a food truck burger, let's get speed knocked out that way a crowd isn't watching an order being called for one burger and then ten minutes another burger coming out, etc etc.   Now that those grievances are out of the way, let's get to the actual food. I wanted to take a picture of the pulled pork sandwich that we ordered but I couldn't get it in the trash fast enough. I've never attempted to eat food so overdone that it looked like someone had intentionally tried to kill me. I'm not kidding, this thing was gnarly. As far as the other seven burgers we ordered, they weren't nearly as bad but that's not saying much.   When all was said and done, it was $40 wasted and an hour of our time at an event down the drain. Next time, we'll be Slidin' Thru to the next food option and I recommend you do too.",

    "text": "We've been to the truck so many times and always loved the experience.   It had been a long while since we had seen them around town when we went to Last Friday in Henderson we were super excited to see them!  Immediately we noticed that the crew was different this time, but they still had the same sliders, so we figured why not.  We ordered and were told the were out of pork, so there goes that option, but still we persisted.  After we were told the wait was 30 minutes, we went to grab our drinks and walk around a bit.  I don't drink soda, so I went for a bottled water and there was none.  Excepting of course, for the half empty one someone had thrown back in the cooler.... Ugh.  So I had nothing to drink when the wait from hell started....  ....After we browsed the stalls we went back to check on our food and were told by a number of patrons in the highly irate mob outside that they had been waiting as hour.  Wait! What?!  So, that's exactly what happened, we waited an hour and a half while they called numbers randomly(there was literally no organization apparent) for 4 sliders to cook before finally asking for our money back.  Apparently, they didn't want to give me a refund because the girl came back to tell me my order was coming out the window next.  I told her to keep it, as Slidin' Thru had already ruined my entire evening.",

Nice artwork on the menu, catchy naming and mini burgs concept that enable you to try more items per meal.  Not the best quality of ingredients, but considering that it's a truck, I can't complain about it too much. That said, I see some room for improvement with the oil, etc.  Not as wildly unique as Fukuburger, but for the less adventurous crowd, Slidin' Thru might work better.",

They sent me an invoice with the gratuity already included, which was fine. But they never showed up to our event as scheduled. After an hour of the run around through email because they don't give you a phone number to talk to someone, we were told they had double booked their selves but the truck was on their way. Supposedly the truck showed up at the wrong place after we already had to order food and pick it up from some where else. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND HIRING SLIDIN' THRU OR CULINARY LOGIC FOR ANY EVENT THAT YOU WOULD ACTUALLY WANT THEM TO SHOW UP TO!!! This place is not only unprofessional, unreliable, but just an embarrassment all around. I wish I would have read the reviews on Yelp to know this place was a disaster!",

I've been supporting these guys since the beginning, so it's nice to see that they've \"made it.\"  Stepping in this place, I felt like they had surpassed themselves in professionalism.  While keeping their Slidin Thru attitude of a fun environment to eat at, they slicked everything out with LCD monitors to show the menu and more comfortable seating than their old HQ location.  The prices have changed a bit, slightly for the better for me.  I told Ric he should honor the old 3 for $7 pricing as a sort of \"secret menu\" like one competitor.  Music was awesome in there.  Heard some Chromeo, some Hot Chip, some Tinie Tempah... can't ask for much more.  I would say I'm bummed this place isn't closer to me, but it's probably a good thing as I would spend too much time and money at this place.  Once in awhile I'll make the drive up here.",

The best part about this place is the fun atmosphere.  The cool comic book style around you, the fun monitors that shows active tweets and pictures, the fist pound and harmony in which they work at together, all combine to make this an enjoyable treat while eating some damn good food.

Then came a fist bump from behind the counter and a friendly gentlemen began to explain the menu.  Sadly, they were out of chicken so i moved on to the beefy treats.   I ordered up a Captain, two Barby's and a small order of Barby fries.  The GF ordered up a Ya Ya and a Pep Pep.  They food came out quick and we began to enjoy sharing bites off each other's sliders.  They were delicious and tasted do damn fresh.  The fries were also shared and consisted on fried onions, bbq sauce, cheese and BACON.  Eat them quick because as the cheese cools it gets a little tricky.  A place with a hip happy going vibe.....I can't wait to go back.",

Our original plan was Tea Time for boba, but ended up here instead since they were closed at the time.  What you get at Slidin' Thru is basically sliders that are infamously sold through their food trucks.  There's a list of sliders that you opt for, including pork and chicken. It was my first visit and decided on the Captain's Orders and the YaYa. Each slider is $3.50.  However, one is free when you check in through your Yelp app.  Not a bad deal if you ask me.  Both sliders were extremely tasty and full of flavor.  The YaYa was a little rich for me.  It's all good since I went back and forth taking bites out of the YaYa and Captain's Order.  We also washed down our sliders with some of their delicious sweet potato fries.  Perfect combination if you ask me.    I've been told that Slidin' Thru restaurant isn't as good as their actual food trucks. I wouldn't know the difference since I never had a slider from their food trucks.  All I know is that at this joint, their sliders are good enough for me to want more and cheap enough for me to come back.",

My husband and I went here for lunch today while we were out and about.  I tried the Peppep and the Buffalo Soldier sliders.  I really enjoyed them both, but wished there was a bit more meat on each one.  My hubby tried the Porky and the Plain Jane.  I stole a bite of the Porky and almost didn't give the slider back because it was so yummy. I totally couldn't have eaten a 3rd slider, but I didn't want to look like a pig, especially since my hubby only ate 2.  The fries were really good too.  They tasted like they were fresh cut and hot out of the fryer.  YUMMY.  Take a bunch of napkins though.  The sliders were saucy (in a very good way) and did kinda get all over the place.  Double yummy on the saucy sliders!  I do think the prices are a bit high.  For what we got on the sandwiches, I think $0.50 less on each would be a more fair price.  Even with that, I think we will be back regularly.  The prices on fries and drinks were spot on though, in my opinion.  On a side note, the place was completely empty our entire meal.  Even the drive thru window remained empty and not one car went through while we were there.  We didn't really see the staff either.  It was a little weird, but when we did see them, they were friendly, helpful, and smiling.  I think if they were a little more present and didn't disappear for long periods of time, it would improve the atmosphere of the joint a bit.  I hope we just went during a weird time or something, because now I am hooked and want them to stay around!!!  Another positive was a free slider just for checking in on Yelp.  Now that is a great deal!  How I love free food!",

We both grab a barby and share regular fries.   Things have changed since the last visit drastically.   The burger patty was very, very thin. Think of White Castle type patty when these originally started pretty fat when Ric owned it. When I grabbed my burger the basket had a pool of oil. The flavor was okay because of the bbq sauce, but it was mostly bread and greasy onion crisps (which probably caused the pool of oil).  The fries changed in that the thin crisp breaded shoestring fries are now thicker fries,- think like 5 guys like. They weren't very crisp and were soggy on the bottom since they got crammed in the cu and just steamed themselves.   Girl up at front was much more quiet and not as personable as previous counter folks.   $9 for this 2 slider, fries and drink combo isn't worth it when those sliders are super skimpy. They used to be worth it when they were fat and juicy. Just look at the photos from the beginning vs. now... they recently fused the truck reviews with the reviews for the brick location and you can see the difference. I should've stopped and taken a picture, but I was in a hurry and just jamming something in my mouth in the 5 minutes I had to spare.   This wasn't the burgers with heart that sold itself. Also Ric WAS Slidin' Thru and the personality carried through in the staff he picked. It's missing that little sumthin' sumthin' on top of being skimpy.   I regret that I will not be back.",

    "text": "When we walked in it was a little awkward because there was no one in the restaurant and then suddenly a girl popped out and greeted us. She was very nice and she was patient while my husband was deciding on his order. We told her we had the Yelp check in freebie and she smiled big, which was cool for us because it gave us a free slider!  We ordered and she brought out our food in no time and it was nice and hot and fresh. But then she kind of disappeared into the back and my husband and I were all alone in the dining area. There was literally no one in the restaurant.   So for our food..... I got the Plain Jane, while my husband had the Plain Jane and the Buffalo Soldier. I thought the Plain Jane was a pretty decent little slider, it was juicy and if it only had some minced onions on it, it would have been perfect. While I didn't try it, my husband said his Buffalo Soldier was enjoyable.  The cheapest sliders started at $3.00 apiece and they went up from there. I think most people would probably want to order a minimum of two sliders. Plus most people would probably order fries and a drink too. So it could get a little pricey.   Maybe it was the weird Twilight Zone ambiance but I like Slidin' Thru as a Food Truck better than an actual sit down restaurant. So if $3.00 is the going rate for a slider with nothing more that cheese and ketchup, I would much rather be at a fun event like First Friday or StrEats with my best Gal Pals or on a hot date with my hubby having fun eating off the food truck, rather than in a stark white restaurant where I feel like I am on the set of Punked'.",

    "text": "Fantastic food truck experience!  These guys are the real deal and serve some high quality sliders in record time.  We caught them during the lunch hour traffic and it was clear they love doing what they do.  The slider (or mini hamburger) options are quite plentiful but we opted for two burger styles, the Barbie and Captain's Order.  Both were delicious with tender hamburger meat and delicious toppings of bacon, balsamic vinegar, or cheese.  The third slider choice was the Porkie's or Pulled pork slider.  Absolutely the best pulled pork sandwich I've had.  This was worth the drive to find them alone.    We topped our orders with an order of sweet fries (piping hot and sprinkled with cinnamon (yum!)) as well as two 1 litter ice cold soda pops on the house!    Perfect meal and a perfect food truck experience.  Look for these guys off the strip and look out for their 2nd truck coming soon!  I believe they accept cash only.",

Everything about this place rocks, the idea, the food, the prices, friendly service... just great, I even enjoy tracking them down.  The best slider hands down for me is the barbie, its a BBQ bacon slider the sauce is smokey and delicious, there are some spicy jalapenos, the meat is juicy and thick, the bacon is crisp, add some fried onions and you get awesomeness.  Once again there BBQ sauce rocks and the pulled pork slider is great too.  The service isn't lightning fast because everything is made to order but worth the wait.  The fries are cooked fresh and are real good too.  The best thing is you can mix and match your order so you can get 3 different types of sliders for lunch.  Variety is the spice of, well lunch in this case.",

I ordered the Barbie, Captain's order and Pulled Pork.  All delicious but I love feta so Captain's order was my fave.  We got there about an hour after they had set up shop and the wait from ordering to receiving the food was about ten minutes so I didn't think that was bad.  I don't know whether the fries were frozen or not but they were delicious and hot to me and I love the sweet cinnamon seasoning.  I'm already planning my return visit!",

It's been a roller coaster of experiences in that even though the food has been consistently very good to excellent, at times the service ( and not just long lines ) is inconsistent.    what you gotta admire about these guys is the good attitude, the positive vibe and basically being the 1st to crack the specialty food truck trend in Las Vegas.  And I'm thankful they selected a food i truly enjoy - Sliders !   The barbie and the pulled pork are still my favs   Long live the slider truck !",

And the time was right, so I pounced at opportunity to savor the meat of victory!  None of this wimpy meat on a bun that I can inhale in one bite. These were True sliders and this is why the Slider Truck's cuisine reign supreme. I have to eat my sliders with two hands. Huge. I like how my hamburger meat is juicy, thick and pink in the middle. The toppings are discernable and tasty. The bacon is thick and smokey. And finally, $7 for three sliders is a steal.  So with a full belly, my clan will rest up until our hunger strike and the hunt is back on.",

    "text": "My First Love.... in Food Trucks that is. I remember going to their truck stop during the summertime by Yogurtland and getting a coupon for a free cup off yogurt after you eat their sliders... Great, great marketing strategy ;) The energy they bring when ordering makes all the difference in the experience of their followers. I didn't even know what to expect coming from having a mentality that \"Food Trucks\" were dirty and the food was considered.. junk. I had an immediate change of heart from my first experience in trying this particular food truck. Fist pumps, the enthusiasm that makes you smile, and of course the sliders and sweet potato fries... I was literally blown the heck away.  Now to the goods... These are my usual:  The Barby: Love cheddar cheese.. it's melted on top of the thick mini patty with a piece of crisp bacon, tangy bbq sauce. On the bottom layer.. there are some caramelized jalapenos and crispy fried onion strips. The soft fluffy buns with all these elements of deliciousness. makes this my favorite slider...  The Yaya: Reminds me of some greek food, but in a slider form. I'm not a huge fan of Feta Cheese, but in this combination.. it works. This slider was somewhat... refreshing to bite into. The fresh lettuce, tomato, red onion, tzatziki, and red wine vinaigrette made it like a healthy treat than anything else. Loved it.  The Captain's Order: Another feta cheese version that I did like...  You can't go wrong with sauteed onion and crisp bacon in a slider.. I call this a Classy One. Included balsamic reduction, roma tomato, and arugula. Flavorful and nice bite from the balsamic reduction. The feta cheese in both sliders really give it a lot of character and color to each bite. Enjoyed this one very much.  Sweet Potato Fries: Long thin rectangular shaped fries... Absolutely LOVE them.   Occasionally I'll try something different... I did like the Pulled Pork. The meat was so tender!!! The spice from the bbq sauce and caramelized jalapenos brighten the whole taste and gave this slider a great kick!!! Ha Yaaaah on that!   I did go adventurous one night and ordered their Mystery Slider... which was Da Irish Hash!!!  A WHOLE hash brown, egg, chedda peno, n bacon. As I was eating this slider, half the hash brown fell off and even eating that only was so darn good!! Crisp on the outside, tender in the inside... now that's a great piece of hash! This mystery slider made my night... it was so delicious and hearty. I so needed this from dancing like a maniac at work and let me tell you... I left Very happy!!!   Now for dessert.. I did try their Sweet Potato Smores. They bring it out to you like a baked casserole. Melted marshmallows, chocolate syrup, and topped with crumbled graham crackers. Dig in and you'll find yourself lost in sweet ecstasy. So warm and so good. This really is soothing to the soul. Some think soup.. but if you're sick of soup.. think of this dessert! ;)    Service has always been exceptional here... Nick introduced me to Jarritos. Delicious lime flavor that goes well with sliders and fries.. Thanks Nick!!! My girlfriend took me here for my birthday and she was confused at first on why I chose this spot to have a nice birthday dinner. She goes... you sure?!?! There's some nice places in the hotels you know? I told her.. I know, but you asked and this is where I want to go. So we met up here and she was just pleasantly surprised how good this place was. She told me... now I understand why you wanted to come here :D Damn right girl!!! There were times where the server? would attempt to skateboard with my food in his hands... I thought that was quite cute and amusing... until he dropped a few of my sweet potato fries!!! I was like Oh Noooooo!!! AHhhhhh!!! I almost... almost dived down to the ground to catch it in my mouth, but he ran all those fries over... such tragedy of sweet potato fries in my mouth world. One time they even came out dancing to serve our food.. So entertaining! I thought it was the cutest thing :D It's a treasure to have a place like this here in Vegas... One of my loves for life.",

Fortunately, more independent restaurants have been popping up.  I hope this trend creeps into the arena of street delicatessens.    Although I don't typically eat red meat, I decided to try the Pulled Pork and Pep Pep.  Both were amazing!  The meat was tender and perfectly cooked.  The buns were crisp and all the ingredients were fresh!    I caught them outside of Stussy near UNLV, but sadly they had to cut out early due to a complaint from Ferraro's restaurant manager.  Who knew a slider truck was competing with a high end Italian restaurant.    Will definitely be back again.",

Dude asked where we'd heard about the truck and when we said \"Yelp,\" we got the \"what's up Yelpers!\" and the fist bump.  Ordered a \"pep pep\" and the pulled pork.  Wow, they make a good slider!  Sometimes when you order burgers at other places, all you can taste is the cheese or the bun or the meat, but not here.  There's a good balance of ingredients with these sliders that make for a really tasty overall experience.  Pricing is $3 for one, $5 for two, $7 for three.   I like the truck's vibe and love the comic-style artwork on the truck.  Do yourself a favor and check this truck out!",

    "text": "The Skinny: good, interesting, innovative slider flavours with some problems with execution (2.75), service - very friendly but difficulties with timing (3), value - not that great - have had better sliders for less and in a more comfortable environment. (2.5)  This review is based on two visits to the slider truck.  After a disappointing first visit (we waited 45 minutes but ended up with no food  due to a dysfunctional propane tank), we ventured for a second try after getting our previous order comped.   We were greeted by an enthusiastic Ric and we received our order about 20 minutes later despite being the 5th order of the day.   Hawaiian rolls were the specials of the day. We tried several sliders and only two hit home. Captain's Order and the Barbie were quite good - nice flavours, nicely prepared. Pep Pep was slightly overseasoned with the toppings of carmelized onions and salty bacon. The Eggplant Caprese was underseasoned. The Yaya was their take on gyros however the sauce made the burgers too soggy. The pulled pork and buns were burnt albeit the jalapeno glaze was quite tasty.  The sweet potato fries were a delightful cinnamon, salty, sugary concoction that works.  Overall, I don't think I have a burning desire to go back to the slider truck. The food is interesting but the inconsistency in quality does not warrant the price or the long wait in 105 F weather.",

I've been following the slidin thru truck for over a year now and have been getting the porkie and barbie every time I go which is atleast once a week if not more. The porkie is just what it sounds like and the barbie is a BBQ bacon cheeseburger with crispy fired onions. These guys know what's up when it comes to mini burgers and the fries are always a nice compliment to any mini burg.   What I suggest since they are mini burgers is that if your hungry you order 3 and worry about what's not left over after if you catch my drift. Don't forget to give the \"DAP\" at the window or as they like to call it \"Window Love\".   These guys have been doing it big ever since they got on the streets of Las Vegas and are they aren't about to stop as they are about to open two brick and mortar locations in the near future, heck they might even have another one poppin off by the time I finish typing this review.  They also started a little event called vegas streats and if you don't know you should. Google it.    Find these guys all over the vegas valley day and night rain or shine and if you can't catch the truck, well then be sure to stop by one of their new locations opening before 2012.

The fries were perfect.  Truly perfect.  2 out of 3 ain't bad... I'd definitely go back - and by the way, Nick, you're darling.

    "text": "Great food and service, but fall short in other areas.  The Barbie, Pep Pep, and Pulled Pork are all delicious and for $7 its just a great value. Just enough to fill you up for lunch, but not enough for dinner.    Combine with the very friendly service that you can only get from a locally owned business, this would get a 5 star right? Nope, there are some issues.  First, the cinnamon fries at $3 is pricey for what you get. I was disappointed to see them use frozen Ore-Ida. When your competition In-N-Out is using potato that is cut in the store and your using frozen potatoes, just disappointing. There is just a difference between frozen potatoes and fresh ones. I rather get animal style fries and have some change left even though I'm a big supporter of the locally owned businesses.   Another issue is that you have no idea what the offering is for a certain day. They might be offering their 6 regular items, they might only have half the menu available, etc. Today when I came, they only had the Barbie, Pep Pep, and Pulled Pork. Lucky for me, I checked Twitter right before I came. Had I  wanted one of the other 3 and didn't check Twitter before, I would have been disappointed. I know everyone and their grandma has a smartphone, but at least be considerate to your non-smartphone customers like Lisa L. A simple sign showing whats available for the day on the truck could easily fix this.  The biggest issue with this place is the wait time. 25 mins from the time of ordering is just ridiculous. I could see 10 to 15 minutes, but not 25 minutes. There was about 5 people ahead of me, which added another 10 - 15 minutes wait time before I can even order.  So from the time I arrived, till I got my first bite was about 35 minutes. I know this isn't fast food, but really? I don't even think this was considered busy. Imagine how bad it would have been if it was actually busy. I hope you have 1 hour to spare because thats how long you'll need. Now I know why the lines are so long...  Great sliders, but they need to work out their communication issues, frozen fries, and the wait time. Until then, its not worth me driving out of my way just to get these sliders.",

    "text": "Sending some love via Yelp for the Slider Truck as promised...  How can you truly know if something's good until you taste everything on the menu?  I bit the bullet and order two of everything today (to share, of course) including the French Dip, today's special.    The truck offers a diverse menu with something to intrigue everyone without too many choices.  Each individual burger has a well thought out taste-combination with ingredients that blend together fantastically.  My personal favorite was the YaYa, a delicious angus burger topped with lettuce, tomato, red onion, tzatziki, and white wine vinaigrette.  There are two sauces that put this place on another level: the bbq sauce, used on the Barbie and Pulled Porkie, and the balsamic reduction used on the Eggplant Caprese (my second favorite) and Captain's Order.  The Pep Pep was reminiscent of  a juicier, smaller In and Out Burger.  The French Dip was out of this world and served with a complimenting dipping sauce.  The only down fall was they ran out of sweet potato fries before I got there :(  No worries, though, I'll definitely be going back!   Great sliders emerge from this tiny truck and with such a friendly, quirky crew on board, everyone should give this place a try!",

    "text": "Well I just moved back to Vegas following a stint in food truck-crazed Los Angeles, so I was kinda excited to see the trucks catching on in LV. I finally got off my lazy butt and tracked down the Slider Truck this week - turns out they were right down the street from my house - sweet! My husband and I proceed to the meetup point about 6:20 (they opened at 6:00), and there is a short line, maybe 10 people. \"No big deal,\" we thought, \"We've waited in lines twice as long for Philly steaks from a truck, asian tacos from a truck, hot dogs from a truck, and even bbq from a truck back in LA.\" Little did we know the process going on inside the slider truck would be so RIDICULOUS! Honestly, I really don't know what they're doing in there, but it took 30 minutes just for us to ORDER and then almost 15 more minutes to receive the food. How long can it take to cook those tiny pieces of meat??? Yeah, I read the sign that says \"please be patient, burgers are cooked to order,\" but Burger King doesn't cook my burger until I order it either, and I think they could have served that entire line in less than 10 mins.  For the actual food: the burgers and fries are pretty good and filling, and I liked the interesting list of burgers. Actually, because the burgers were good, I'm really giving it 2.5 stars, but I had to round down. Sorry.  Price: ok. I mean, the food is good, but you are eating it in a parking lot, so you would think their overhead would be lower.  Service: I don't get why everyone raves about the service. I mean, yeah, the guy at the window gives you a fist pound before you order, but seriously. I would have taken no fist pound if it meant I got my dinner 5 or 10 (or 40!) minutes faster.  Bottom line: If it's a good fast burger you want, Fatburger is faster. If it's interesting toppings you want, Bachi Burger or Grind or Burger Bar have a larger selection. If it's a cheap burger you want, In-n-Out is less than half the price. And all of these options will provide you with a table, chairs, and air conditioning while you enjoy your food! On the other hand, if you want the novelty of eating from a truck, go here once, but just know what you're getting into....",

It's so refreshing to see people enjoy what they do for a change. The atmosphere is so positive I swear you can almost taste it in their food! My favorites are the Pep Pep, Yaya, and the Barby. A little on the pricey side, but I think it's worth it to support a local growing business. I wish I could have a full size version of their burgers. One slider just isn't doing it for me anymore. It is nice though if you are a Slidin' Thru newbie so you can try several of their flavors all in one sitting. If you are discouraged by long lines hit them up during the week for lunch hours. I've waited over an hour for these burgers though and they are worth it. Slidin' Thru is a MUST TRY at least once for all Vegas locals!",

My favorite is the Barbie. Bacon burgers aren't my thing, but the combo of the bacon, jalapenos, crispy onions and cheddar is burger nirvana for me. Phil loves the burgers, but is in love with the Pulled Porkie. Super tender pulled pork, with caramelized jalapenos and barbecue  sauce...I love this one too. They also serve up a massive bag of sweet potato fries seasoned with a cinnamon/sugar shake. I like a bit of heat with my sweet, so I like to add a couple shakes of cayenne to the bag and give it a toss. So good!  Just as good as the bangin' sliders is the staff. Always friendly, always a good vibe. Our kids love it too. (they have a yelp acct now and have beat me to the punch reviewing this place) Pull up their website, check the skedgie and go get yourself sum windowlove!",

We got two Barbies, a Porkie, and the Eggplant Caprese. We also split an order of sweet potato fries.  First, we got lots of fist pounding love at the window. Always a great way to start a food adventure. Follow that with a Mexican coke in a glass bottle, and a fresh order of sliders, and we were good.  The sweet potato fries were hot, crispy, and dusted with cinnamon and sugar. The Barbies were a letter-perfect combination of smoky, crunchy sweet onion and bacon, with a perfect patty and cheese. The pulled pork was succulent and juicy, with good seasoning.   We were full, but I almost got back in the line to get more Barbies...It was that good.",

Why on earth would I driver 37 minutes to get a slider?  Well, my little secret is that I can't ever seem to make it to the truck at night and when I go to the food truck things in parking lots there are too many decisions and this one is always jam packed.  So this is what we did one Sunday afternoon.  We packed up the fam and made the trek to try the famous Slidin' HQ.  We got there and after refueling a few times, bathroom breaks, took some landmark pics....  Just kidding, but it did feel like a road trip.  We were greeted and decided on what we were going to get.  We ordered a couple plain Jane's (One for my daughter) Captain's order, Pep pep, and a Caprese.  The bread was a little stale but that was it.  They were tasty.  So the food was ok but the service was incredible.  The guy who took the order was really nice.  Now when I go to food truck festivals I can cross this off my list and not have to wait 2 hours like you do at these things for finger food.  If you live in the area or ever in the area, go check it out!  They used to have a location by the airport, I hope they can put one in the south someday again.  Cheers!",

Pork tenderloin, apple slaw, onion straws, bacon.... this was really quite spectacular. They made it in honor of steve jobs, and it certainly does him justice. It's absolutely delicious. Try it while they still have it.... you will not regret it.  I hope to try them again. If I did have one thing I would change... iw ould have them list their prices on their menu.

    "text": "I haven't had a single thing from the stand alone store that I haven't liked, but they have forgotten our sweet potato fries at the drive through two different times. The last time I stopped in I was walking out of the door when they ran the fries to me. If it weren't for this, I would give their food 5 stars.   The menu is creative, the flavors are well-balanced and the food is reasonably priced considering the quality and ingredients. My favorites are the Captain's Table slide which has arugula and a balsamic reduction (nom!) and the porky because I am a sucker for pulled pork anything!  Whether you stop at the truck around town or in one of the store fronts, Slidin' Thru has great food, just make sure you get everything you order!",

    "text": "Call me a hater but I'm not about to start giving away superfluous high marks to restaurants simply because their business model puts them on wheels.  I love food trucks and I appreciate the kind of hipster culture they've spawned but is it just me or does it seem like every food truck gets inherently higher grades on Yelp than they would if it was a brick and mortar operation?  Don't get me wrong, there are some really great food trucks out there that are doing innovative cuisine.  Slidin Thru  however, is simply cooking small burgers with some interesting toppings.  Everything tasted fine and I would have no problem going back, Im just not about to soil myself because I just had a hamburger off a truck.  Like I said, the food was decent.  I had a the 3 slider combo for 7 bucks and opted for their Pulled Pork, the burger with the balsamic reduction and the one with feta cheese and bacon.  The buns are soft but rather un-noteworthy.  The beef was cooked nicely but it lacked a distinct flavor.  The Pulled Pork was actually the best of the bunch with a nice, subtle sauce and the right level of moistness in the meat.  The french fries were beyond average but they also offer sweet potato fries for a buck more....might be worth the upgrade.    The guys running the truck are outgoing and helpful although they do one thing that I think is very unbecoming.  If you pay by credit card, the order taker says \"My machine is asking if you would like to leave a tip.\"  I understand his machine may be asking that, but maybe post a sign that say you can leave a tip when paying by debit or credit rather than put people on the spot.   Jeez, thanks for putting me in a pickle.  I mean are you going to tell the guy no straight to his face?  I just think thats a tad audacious.    My visit corresponded with their new semi-residency at lunch time on Thursdays at UNLV.    Don't let the wheels seduce you...",

The menu is very unique, balsamic reduction with feta cheese and onions on fries. But let me say that the flavors are well on spot. There unusual toppings are a must have, someone has been doing there homework in flavor town.  The decor is very cool, the bathrooms are chalkboard walls so you can leave a message for the next patron. There are some fun shirts hanging on the wall as well. The service was fast and friendly. I can see why my parents have this place as a staple. And since the burgers are so small, you get to try different flavors!  Its located next to a strip mall so parking is in a lot. There is a drive thru, but it can get REALLY backed up during dinner.",

    "text": "Finally! Slidin' Thru was here on the UNLV campus today. I love when they're on campus because they are always conveniently located right outside of my job. It's awesome really. I have only had one other experience with Slidin Thru other than today's and I would have to say both were pretty good! The line is usually a little long since most students stop by the truck for lunch or in between passing periods, so keep that in mind if you're planning on trying it out one day.  Today I decided to have two Barbys. The Barby is a slider with melted cheddar cheese, fried onion strips, bacon, barbecue sauce, and caramelized jalapenos. In other words, amazingness in a bun. My order came out fairly quickly and was as delicious as I remembered it from the first time. This is definitely a favorite of mine and always will be.  Besides their slider options, they have regular and sweet potato fries. They give you a brown paper bag full of fries, so trust me you will get full! This is definitely a food truck you want to try if you're tired of the usual options in the SU or even the Dining Commons on campus.",

    "text": "Really, when you talk about Slider Truck, you have to talk about two things. You have to talk about the food, and you have to talk about the experience.  The burgers are Angus beef, cooked medium rare, served on soft buns, slightly toasted, and topped with a variety of delicious toppings.  My favorite is the Barby, mostly for the caramelized jalapenos that are like nothing else. They perfectly complement the smoky bacon, cheddar, crispy onions and BBQ sauce that inevitably make you understand why they include a wet-nap with each order.  The Pep Pep is a more standard bacon cheeseburger, with lettuce, tomato and caramelized onions - \"super sauce\" is the only deviation from tradition. I think super sauce is watered-down ranch dressing.   I definitely prefer the Barby, I think maybe the reason is I'm eating the Pep Pep second - the Barby is clearly the more flavorful burger. Don't get me wrong, they're both great - the quality of the ingredients shines through every step of the way.  Then there's the service experience. Ricardo and the boys are not exactly the Soup Nazi. :) While the line moves forward you'll get an idea of the schtick here. They do an amazing job of making first-timers feel like regulars and making regulars feel like friends. They've got their own catch-phrases, which is a sign you've made it. When they talk about #windowlove, you really feel it. As you bump fists, you can tell that these guys are having a blast.  Note to self: start getting to the truck earlier so that I can try the Porkie and a Mystery Slider, as I've always arrived after these limited-edition delicacies have sold out for the night.  Update: I am told that the Super Sauce is not ranch dressing of any kind. Next guess: some kind of tzatziki?",

    "text": "Another great place I've discovered as a result of my fellow Yelpers.   After just finding out about the Koji Korean BBQ taco trucks in the Southern California area, I was pleased to find out high quality street food has found its way to Las Vegas, this time, in the form of succulent mini, square shaped burgers.   As me and my co-worker pulled up to the truck, posted in the West-side Yogurtland plaza, we were surprised to see about 10-15 people standing and waiting for their orders, as it was relatively late in the evening. I ordered the Captains Order, Pep Pep and the Pulled Pork sliders. I was looking forward to trying the Kalbi sliders, but they were sold out. Bummer, next time. After putting in my order, the cook/owner turned to me and asked how we had heard about them, to which I replied \"Yelp.com\". He then stopped his burger flipping, walked over, shouted \"YEAAHHHH! YELLLPPERSSSS!\" and gave me a fist bump.\" How awesome is that?   Now granted we came about 30 minutes before they were closing up, the food took a bit long, as they were backed up and actually ran out of some supplies (Probably a good sign!), but kept up updated on the status of the food and was sincere with their apologies.   When I got my food, I anxiously devoured them up and I can say they are damn good. First thing I noticed off the bat was the freshness of the ingredients, specifically the meat. Big, thick piece of Angus beef in each slider, with an interesting foray of vegetables and dressings. I didn't really see anything on the menu other than about a choice of 6-7 sliders, not even hot prepared sides, which I do wish they had. Not having some sort of fried potato leaves me with an empty feeling, although they did have chips for sale.   Overall, I love the concept, the quality and freshness of the ingredients and the boldness of these trendy entrepreneurs, I really would like to see them succeed. Add some more sides!",

    "text": "I was introduced to the Slider Truck awhile back by fellow Yelper and coworker, Nelson Q. Before Slider Truck, I have only heard/read about the whole food truck trend in NY and LA. So I was eager to give it try when Nelson tracked them down to a strip mall near my home. After waiting about 10 minutes in the 100F+ heat, it was finally my turn to place my order with Ric. I remember trying the Captain's Order, Yaya, and Pulled Porkie.  The food was alright to me, felt that the burgers back then was a little dry and could use a little more sauce.  But I wholeheartedly support the entrepreneurial spirit of these Las Vegas culinary students jumping with both feet in on this food truck trend sweeping the country.  Ric was awesome and made every customer feel like VIPs.  And at 3 sliders for $7 (1 slider = $3, 2 sliders = $5) + $2 regular fries or $3 sweet potato fries, it was an inexpensive and unique dining experience.  And on Thursday I decided to go again because class let out earlier than expected, plus I have some Groupons that I finally printed and they were at the Cox Communications building off of Rancho @95.  When I arrived there was a decent line, and some people enjoying their sliders on the collapsable chairs they have brought with them (they must be pros at this whole food truck dining thing). It turns out that it was Ric's birthday and he was giving away these mini slider desserts to customers. It looks like a miniature hamburger, and I thought it would be cool to take a picture of it before polishing it off.  So after waiting for maybe 20-25 minutes, someone other than Ric finally took my order (Captain's Order, Barbie, Pep Pep and their Sweet Potato Fries) and I handed over my Groupon worth $10.  Pretty good deal having paid $5 for the Groupon offer.  He was nice enough, but I wasn't offered the mini hamburger dessert cake. I guess they were starting to ration it, because while I waited for my order to be prepared it was only offered to some of the girls in line.  Anyway, My Captain's Order was flavorful and a lot more moist and juicy this time around.  I also liked the Barbie with the flavorful BBQ sauce. But the YaYa was no good (tiny patty that was gone after 2 bites and leaving more than half the bread).  2 out of 3 ain't bad.  And the Sweet Potato Fries with the contrasting sweet and salty taste was enjoyable as a dessert snack. The mystery slider that I have tried was good (Roast Beef with Cheese, and they are more generous with the roast beef on the slider).  I bought a total of 4 Groupons since my first visit so I can really experience the Slider Truck.  And aside from seeing their loyal followings that would wait for the truck before their scheduled arrival (pretty cool), I have also experienced a few late arrivals (not cool - especially on cold winter evenings), fairly long lines, but they are getting better at fulfilling orders quicker.  Overall, I think the food served is alright.  And in general I would prefer a stationary location, instead of tracking them down and hoping they will actually be there when I feel like having some sliders.  But that is just me.",

So this afternoon, I looked up their website and noticed that they were going to be having a Truck Showdown or Battle??!! Yeah! It was called \"Street Food Throwdown!\" - Slidin Thru' VS. HanShikTaco  Well, Now it really didn't matter how far they were parked because I was gonna conquer two trucks with one appetite!! I got there around 12:30ish and there was a big crowd in front of Lee's Discount Liqs.. I barely found parking and went for The Slider Truck 1st.   After about a 20 minute line and 5 minute pick-up wait, this is what I got:  1. Barby: melted cheddar, caramelized jalapeno, crispy fried onion strips, bacon and bbq sauce  2. Pep Pep: lettuce, tomato, crisp bacon. sauteed onion, melted cheddar and super sauce  3. Yaya: lettuce tomato, red onion, feta, tzatziki and red wine vinaigrette  4. Captain's Oder: roma tomato, arugula, crisp bacon, feta cheese, sauteed onion and balsamic reduction  ALL the Sliders were 'AAHHH SOMMMEE'!!!!! Angus Burgers were all seasoned perfectly, moist and juicy, bite tender.. Great Job! I don't have anything negative to say about their burgers whatsoever. I ordered their sweet potato tater tots and have no complaints either.   * Only thing that sucked was that they ran out of pulled pork so obviously couldn't order anything with that. But what sucked even more was their  \"Mystery Taco\" just sold out too, by a few people in front of me in line!! Yes, Taco since they were challenging Tacos.. Pretty Cool! Its all good because I got a reason to come hunt them down again, soon!  *Judges did Announce the Winner by a close margin of 3 points.. And the Winner is Vegas's Own: SLIDER TRUCK!!!!! WOO HOO!!!!!   Staff were all Super Excited and Giddy, Food was Perfect and Cost was Fair!!! I'd drive the miles for this place in a heartbeat. I will be back for more, you can count on that!",

    "text": "This is my very first review, and I wanted it to be great... unlike my first... eh, well, we won't go there. lol  My hubby and I have tried the Slider Truck twice now, and it was awesome both times! We were fortunate to get there before the lunch crowds (we arrived a little before 11 o' clock), so we've never really waited in line for more than five minutes, if that. Both times, Ric and the guys were very friendly, giving every customer a fist bump (WINDOWLOVE) and a smile. And they all seemed genuinely happy to be doing what they're doing, which is feeding all of our fat asses!   I've ordered:  Pulled Porky: I love pulled pork sandwiches, and this one is my new favorite! My husband makes a mean smoked pulled pork, but the Pulled Porky kicks my Hubby in his pork butt (sorry, Hubby!)! The BBQ sauce is just right for me; not too sweet, and the caramelized jalapenos are more for added flavor than for heat.  Barby: The burger was cooked perfectly, IMO, and served with melted cheddar, bacon (bacon makes everything taste better!), crispy fried onions (oh, where have you been all of my life?!), caramelized jalapeno and BBQ sauce, which is also on the Pulled Porky. Another favorite!  Pep Pep: This is like their version of a mini Big Mac, except their version has bacon (I'm sensing a theme here), FRESH tomatoes, sauteed onions,  lettuce, REAL cheddar with their own super sauce. lol  Captain's Order: A slider with feta, roma tomato, arugula, bacon, sauteed onions, drizzled with a balsamic reduction sauce?! Yes, please! This is definitely a mini slider that is packed with big flavor!  Reuben (Mystery Slider): This had thinly sliced pastrami, pickles, mustard, some sauce that I couldn't really make out,  all on a burger with a rye roll that was soft and had that perfect chew to the crust.   Sweet Potato Fries: These are, hands down, the best sweet potato fries I've ever had! They're crispy (lightly battered crust) on the outside and soft on the inside, and then they add cinnamon and sugar with some salt, just to bring out the flavors. So freakin' good!  All sliders come with a wet nap, napkins and a sweet treat, which is a nice touch.  I realize that gourmet trucks are not a new concept, but they are for Vegas. And for that, I want to thank Ric and the guys for gettin' it started out here!",

    "text": "So after hearing and reading so much about the slider truck we decided to give it a try.   My first Slider Truck experience was a secret location on N. Lake Dr. We were fortunate enough to get just on time with the truck when the line wasn't long. Seeing as I am so indecisive about everything I figured it was just a good idea to order one of everything. It was a good idea. The result was little container full of different flavored sliders which had me salivating. They were so good I was tempted to lick the Styrofoam container that had some jalapeno jelly on it. Luckily there was still a little bun left to sop up all that juicy goodness.   Now a few words on service. I love friendly service and these people make you feel right at home. From greeting to pickup the smiles don't stop. How does it feel to love your job? The way these guys look at work it seems they have the answer to that question.   My second Slider Truck experience was the very next day in the back parking lot on Flamingo. Got there in the evening an hour before they closed up and got a couple of Pep Peps, YaYas, Barbies and Captain's Orders. Great eats again.  And you get free candy!  It was an awesome and fun experience both times. I can't wait for my next experience.",

    "text": "Very tasty food, great service, super far away, and really too expensive for what you get.  That is the summation of my experience here.  The Chicky Boom and the YaYa were my sliders, and the Chicky Boom is the awesomes.  The service was great, seriously, everyone was super pleasant.  I only went here because I was on my way to Mt Charleston for the weekend and it was a pitstop, so I won't be making my way specifically out to get food here.  The worst part is that it's really too expensive for what you get.",

    "text": "In the few years that Rex has been on this planet...385 to be exact...he has learned a few things. First, never fight a naked man unless you are also naked. Sounds counter-intuitive, Rex understands that, but the degradation of fighting a naked man while clothed is too much for most people to handle.  Second, Xenu is real and when that guy comes back you are all in trouble.  Third, if you work on a movie set never scream \"all the chicks around here look a little pudgy...without clearing out your ex-lax and diet pill collection. That feeding frenzy can last for weeks.  Lastly, Rex rarely...more rare than crumbs on Orson Welles shirt...will a food experience be better the second time when it was disappointing the first time. A second bite of that old apple is usually the apple that leaves pesticide on your lips and a worm that doesn't get you high in your stomach. Gentlemen, and other scumbags, this is doubly True for your experience with the ladies.  First time you are with them it is okay...second time...the always hide the valuables you didn't take and make sure no cash is in the house. Tricky tricky.  Rex was disappointed when he went to the Slidin' Thru food truck a few years ago. Long line. Little pay off. The burger was okay, but they were all overcooked.  An overcooked burger is like Rex after too much of his homemade punch (1 part Smith's brand Draino, 2 parts powdered eggs, 3 parts Von's brand Windex, 4 parts water from Lake Mead)...burned past the point of good taste.  Rex is a fiend on punch. A punching fiend.  The burgers on line were tasty because of the unique flavors, but the burger itself was a letdown due to the hour long line. In all fairness they would have been a let down on a 3 minute line.  Creativity is great. It is flair. Flair is great. Rick Flair is great. Flair is what got David Copperfield girls while looking like a wax statue of a man made by a blind person with 4 fingers. 3 flares and a canister of propane got Rex 8 months. Flair can overcome a lot. The problem with flair is that it fades quickly...like drinking ammonia or dating Taylor Swift.  Both come on strong but are no good in bed. (Ammonia releases the bowels...much like TS's music.)  Flair is for gimmick hungry newbies. Slidin Thru felt like gimmicks the first time to Rex and Rex NEVER went back. Until Rex was eventually dragged back...but this time to the Slidin' Thru restaurant and this time by his new woman Martha \"Skin Sack\" Sugarmanington.   Skin Sack told me that these burgers were good. She begged. She implored. She used her feminine wiles. Then she did the only thing that Rex can't resist. She paid.  So Skin Sack and I headed up to what felt like Utah by the time we got there. Could this place be any further out?  Next time why not just make a lean-to out in the desert?  Rex was annoyed. An annoyed Rex is a projectile vomiting Rex.  Not good for Skin Sack's bike...but that girl can peddle.   Rex is happy to say that Slidin' Thru was MUCH better than before. The Pulled Porky, obviously named after Skin Sack before the operation, was the very good.   Rex loves pulling on her skin as she peddles me around town. Rex cuddles up in it on a cool night.  Rex pulls some skin over his head as a skin shade.  To me the best two burgers came down to the old standby...the Pep Pep. Cooked well, made with care, and packed with flavor...but...I have to give the nod to the Chicky Boom.  The sriracha is the star of this sandwich.  Great addition burst of flavor, some heat, a little needed complexity. Excellent sandwich. The regular fries were good, but the sweet potato fries we excellent. Crunchy, soft on the inside. Really a nice sweet component to cut through the richness of the burgers.  Rex has complaints.  The Captain's Order is bordering on vile. The flavors don't work. They went for a Greek thing, but it is like watching Greco-Roman Wrestling...odd, off putting and a waste of time.  The Caprese is such a great concept...but it was terribly under seasoned and the sauce reduction too sweet. Also of all our burgers, and we ordered a lot...we did get some that were borderline overcooked. None were as terrible as the truck, but still...this place isn't cheap. Rex isn't going to the ends of the earth to get stuff that is hit and miss. Skin Sack worked hard to get us there...she deserves better than standing outside while Rex spends her money and she is forced to watch Rex eat food that isn't subject to better quality control.  Rex has one big problem and it goes back to the truck issue...Slidin' Thru is popular. They do well. They have a fan base.  That is all great. Rex has a feeling what they don't have is exacting standards for their food. They love tattoos and having fun, working hard and creating interesting flavors...but they don't love holding themselves to a higher standard each and every time they cook. They push burgers. Which is fine...but what about more? Some love a cool concept...but everyone loves a great burger.",

    "text": "I never got around to trying the slider truck out but was excited to hear that they opened a permanent location in the Northwest side of town!  My wife had brought one of each home from them last Friday and everything was great.  The sweet potato fries and some kind of fries with smores in it was pretty good.  On Saturday, we went back again to correct something that went awry in our take out order the night before.  They were excellent.  This is what customer service is about!  We tried their pep fries and DANG! I am hooked!  My favorites are the Barby, Pep Pep and Yaya!    The people that work there are awesome.  The place is new and clean.  In the bathroom, they have chalk so you can write on their black board walls. They have a Twitter dump on their wall and their ice machine makes the tiny / almost shaved ice kind of ice!  Good location right off Durango and 2-15, we'll be dropping by this store again for sure!  Also, for those who are navigating your way out there, Google Maps is wrong - the store is on the NORTH EAST corner of Durango and Centennial in the same shopping center as 7-Eleven.",

I order the mystery slider which was stacked with all kinds of food. The second time I ordered the mystery again but it was horrible. There was one worker in the truck and when he was taking my order I couldn't even hear what he was saying. He was talking so quietly. I ordered the combo, 2 sliders and sweet potato fries. I was expecting great quality food like the first time. But wow. My sliders only had lettuce, chicken, and buffalo sauce with a line of fries. Not to mention the other slider had a pickle in it. If I get two mystery sliders, I expect them to be the same, not just having one with a pickle in it. I was extremely disappointed.",

I have tried a few other items but nothing compares to these BBQ masterpieces. The caramelized jalapenos are the key to how much I love these sandwiches. It is either that or they are slipping crack into the BBQ sauce. One taste and I am hooked.   My sister and I had split the Smore Fries once and I still cringe at the fact that we finished a whole order. For anyone who is trying Slidin' Thru for the first time, it is not for the faint of hearts. This decadent treat should probably not be tackled by one person. Tow people is still a stretch, but since this fatty could knock it out with help, it is not impossible.   The food is reasonable and that is good because it is a far drive for me to get there. I cannot wait for the Fort Apache location to open up.",

This was my first time trying the Caprese, and I have to say, I didn't love it, but maybe that's because eggplant can only be so good in comparison to delicious meat!    Believe the hype.

I had heard great things about the truck here on Yelp, but the idea of trying to track down a truck to buy lunch just seemed a little ridiculous to me. And then Misti arranged a CMYE where attendees were able to try the truck for free... And boom, just like that I was hooked.  2 regular sliders are a measly $5, coupled with an order of the AMAZING sweet potato tots and you have a great lunch. My favorite sliders are the pulled porky (extra sauce please!!) and the pep pep.   What really bumps this truck up from a 4 star place to a 5 star, this is as good as it gets kinda business is the service. The guys that work the truck are awesome, always super friendly and funny. It's really a pleasure to be able to support a local business like Slidin' Thru. Til next time (which will probably be next week!)  #windowlove",

So my expectations were set pretty high. And that might have been the disadvantage to my taste buds.   They're not bad at all, but it just tasted like regular sliders to me. Not really something to throw a parade over. They offer 7 different type of sliders and also a 'mystery slider', the chefs special of the day. I've tried the Barby, Pep Pep, and Captain's Order. Maybe because it was First Friday and they were quite busy, but I really couldn't differentiate the flavors between the three other than subtle differences in ingredients.   I have to give them props on their truck though! Very nicely decorated and their website is fun to look at too. Looking at the pictures on their site gives me a feeling like I may have the wrong impression... but my stomach never lies. I wouldn't turn down the opportunity to have a go at it again, I think it's worth a shot.",

    "text": "Slidin thru is one of the \"staple\" food trucks in Vegas that I feel everyone should go to at least once. I've been a loyal fan of them for forever. I also love that they have a brick and mortar store. My only regret is that I don't live closer to them anymore.  One of the major things you'll like at slidin thru is the vibe and environment. The music is always nice, and usually something you don't expect to hear at a burger joint. It's spacious and well designed. The aesthetics work well together and it's a very pleasant environment to be in.  The sliders are all pretty good. There's a vegetarian one that I've never tried because I'm team carnivore all the way. My favorite are the porky which is a pulled pork and jalapeno and the buffalo soldier which is a buffalo chicken inspired bit. They also have mystery sliders and random daily sliders that come and go so its always worth a shot to check that.  The fries in my personal opinion are meh. I've never had em where I like em there's always been something wrong with them so I never even really eat them anymore.  Another great experience is with the workers. They are always super friendly, super nice and give you a fist bump when you get your order. Another random aside is that the hats that the workers wear are awesome. It's a black/red/yellow SnapBack with their logo. It's ridiculously awesome and they sold it at the store for awhile. I've actually bought like 4 of them but because everyone loves it and always steals them from me because they just have to have it. Maybe I should just get a punch card with the hats. After the 4th hat your 5th is free lmao.  But overall this is a stellar place. Food is good, vibe is good.  If you ever aren't on the north side you can go to the food truck. They're usually at first Friday and strEATS and I know they do private events. They were supposed to open a second location down on trop and ft. apache but that has never come to fruition :(",

    "text": "Really disappointing!  My girlfriend and I attended the food truck festival at the Southpoint.  I have read and heard so many great reviews.  Could not wait to try this place.  In fact, 40% on my reason for coming to this festival was to finally try Slidin' Thru.  First off, the line was really, really long.  I hate waiting in lines.  But, I'll admit its a fairly reliable sign of good food.  After about 15 minutes of waiting in line the person in front of us stated that Slidin' Thru was out of everything but the Plane Jane.  Thanks a lot Slidin' Thru for not telling us sooner.  At this point we were committed, even if I could only try the Plane Jane.  As we got near the ordering booth I noticed a group of girls lingering around the ordering booth.  They were typical high school girls: over concerned with their looks and not particularly friendly.  Perhaps, Slidin' Thru groupies as Slidin' Thru has earned their street credit as a cool place.  Then, it was my turn to order (around 30 minutes of waiting already).  The man was slow to take my order.  I'm sure he was tired because I know they were super busy, but the food festival had been going for only three hours (it was 8 pm and the thing went from 5 pm to 9 pm).  The truck was nicely decorated and hip-hop played on the radio inside.  We ordered two Plane Janes and one Caprese, they were out of everything else.  Then we began our wait for the order to be cooked.  One of the groupies picked up an megaphone and said \"Hey, people of the truck.  We are out of everything but the Plane Jane.\"  Okay, so at least one works for the truck.  They were not all just groupies.  And, why hang out right at the ordering station?  The area was really crowded already.  It did not need 6 or 7 more people lingering.  Especially with their attitude.  Also, why not give the public service announcement every 5 or 10 minutes?  Why wait so long?  People get really pissed off for waiting in line so long just to find out something like that.  Our food finally came out.  Total time, about an hour.  The meat was under cooked.  It was pink in the middle and cold.  the buns were dried out and crusty.  The Caprese fell apart as we tried to eat it.  The food was not special.  I prefer In and Out Burger, and I always know where they are at.  The man working the counter apologized and began handing out cards for a free slider at their fixed Northwest location.  It was a nice gesture, but the food was not good.  I overheard him explaining to another customer that one of their storefront locations had recently closed because it could not make enough money.  I understand why.  I think this place probably makes descent sliders on most days and the whole food truck craze and their cool vibe has served them well.  However, they have become a victim of their own success.  Rarely do things meet over inflated expectations.  I'll give this place another try aside from a food truck festival, but for this experience, what a dud!",

Let me tell you yelpers, when you get anyone in the car to travel to a food truck, and you are more something than 20, this is how your conversation will go.  Unless you decide to just give it to them straight in which you will never embark in said journey because they will leave your ass quicker than you can say super size it.    Yes it was very hard for me to get anyone to understand that we were going to eat at a roving truck.  I just kept shouting... they have an A from the health department!  Then I implemented the element of surprise.  What does all of this have to do with the food you ask?  Well when you get past the fact that they are should we say \"foundation-ally challenged\", the food is actually pretty damned tasty.  Pulled Porkie? Hamtastic!  Caprese? More pleasie!  Pep pep? Yep Yep!    I've tried their entire menu.  Taking hostage a different friend each time.  We always walk away stuffed and super satisfied.  Not a fan of sliders, meat, or eggplant?  Just go for the sweet potato fries!  These guys are super nice and their ability to be all over Vegas in the course of a week is an idea that makes me want to sell goulash out of the trunk of my Honda.  Ok not really but check them out...the food is great and showing up to their location-of-the-day makes you feel like you are part of a secret underground Vegas:  the password is GO.",

Their tacos are simple, not too filling to feel like you've overeaten, and they're cheap when you're in a rush to your next class, or you want something simple and quick while you're on campus in between classes. They usually park next to the library, so its convenient in regards to you're right next to the Coffee Bean by Lied. I haven't really ventured into their other items on the menu, but their tacos are what keeps me coming back!",

I ordered two Porkys, I was told they were out of pulled pork, since my heart was set on the Porky, I let out an \"Awww\". I was completly shocked to hear the guy in the window rudely say \"what do you expect? We've been out here for hours\".  Instead I ordered two sliders, a plain jane and a Barbie. Opted out of the fries I was gonna order, just because of his rudeness.  Now, it pains me to say this because I was a HUGE fan of this truck. But- the sliders were just okay. Barely okay. First of all- I waited for 24 minutes to get my order (keep in mind, no line when ordering). The buns on both of my sandwiches were cold. The bottoms were toasted- but the bread was totally COLD. In addition to being cold, it was stale. My slider meat seemed smaller than normal. On the plain jane, it was all cold bread, cold ketchup. On the barbie, the meat was warm, and all other components were cold.  Sadly after eating my sliders, a friend asked \"ooh slidin thru- was it good?\". I honestly answered \"NO\".  Not in a big rush to line up and wait at the Slidin Thru truck anytime soon.",

I waited in line to order for 40+ min and then another 15+ min for the food. The line was nowhere long enough to warrant that kind of wait. Out of the 4 or 5 different sliders that we ordered, none of them screamed delicious! We also got super salty regular fries instead of the sweet potato fries we ordered. I was ready and willing to vote them on for The Great Food Truck Race, but quickly changed my mind. Ya the guy was friendly and all, but a fist pump won't satisfy my starving tummy. Coming from LA, where food trucks took over, this truck needs to step it up if it wants to be worthy of competition.",

The fries looked microwaved and the burger was nothing special. I could of gotten the same thing at any burger joint and it would of tasted better. I also had a milk shake and the shake had ice crystals or something in it and to top it off the cashier took the remainder of the shake that was left over. I paid $4 bucks for that shake and he should of given the left over that didn't fit into the cup to me but he didn't. He acted like he was going to throw it out but began drinking it.

    "text": "I have to say, when I first thought of food from a truck I imagined tasteless burritos or subpar sandwich fare. My first encounter with Slider Truck was outside Retro Bakery during the Johnny Cupcakes tour. While I waited in line for four hours, hot and famished, I ignored Slider Truck on shear principle. Really? Those people must be desperate to be eating food from a truck that just rolls on up and throws food out a window. Don't they see the 7-11 right here? At least with a 7-11 hot dog your expectations are so low it's hard for them not to be met... but I digress. Slider Truck, at first glance, I thought you were a poor excuse for wetting my taste buds. And now I'm here to publically admit how very, very wrong I was.  I can now proudly say I am not only a Slider Truck stalker, but an addict. Drug of choice? Pulled Porkie slider with a sweet potato after shock. I'm actually not a big fan of burgers in general, so I leave the rest of the sliders to my husband to explore (he's tried them all and he, too, is now an addict).  But the Porkies?  Holy shit. I can't remember a time I tasted pork so flavorful that just a light drizzle of BBQ sauce is all that's necessary to make them sing praises in my mouth. (They normally come with some caramelized jalapeno- but I like to keep it simple.) The buns are light, but toasted to perfection and each mouthful is truly scrumptious. And as if that weren't enough to make your stomach growl for an encore--there's the sweet potato fries. To date, the best sweet potato fries I have EVER tasted. Crisp, light, sweet with a dusting of cinnamon and sugar (although, I know Ric--the slider truck guy--is more than happy to dust with salt if you so prefer).  You know you have a good thing when I'd rather find the Slider Truck for date night than hit up some restaurant...and the fries--great to stuff in your purse for the movie-shhh! And if it matters, my 8.5 month old also thoroughly enjoys both the Porkies and fries. He had his first taste last night and screamed for more long after I'd polished off the last bite.  The insanely delectable sliders can only be made better by the uber-friendly owner, Ric, who clearly pours his heart and soul into his business. Nice guy, great food, excellent business concept- what's there not to love? Would I recommend you stalking the Slider Truck? Absolutely. Is it worth all the hype? Absolutely. Am I already craving more sliders? You betcha!",

So, when I noticed the slidinthru truck, I was interested to try what they had to offer. I figured, anything would be better than convention food. I was (of course) right!! These sliders were very yummy. The burgers were fresh/super moist and topped with lettuce, tomato, grilled onions, pickles, bacon, cheese (optional), and their secret sauce. A little burger with a big impact! The fries are really good too - they kind of taste like Burger King with half the grease. Fresh, crispy, and delicious. Makes me wish we had one of these trucks in my neighborhood!!",
