That's alright I'm craving some middle eastern food and I can't wait to scarf this combination plate down (chicken and beef gyro with rice)...And than the let down the food has 0 flavor, the \"world famous red and white sauce\" which is watery Thani sauce and sarachi are the only flavor to mask the taste of the greasy grill that the chicken has taken on. Save your money, if you have never had middle eastern food this would make you hate it. Stay away. Too bad, perhaps my expectations far exceeded me....the only saving grace was the free baklava I got from yelp when I checked in.....",

Pretty good size meal for $10.  It comes with 2 packets of their white sauce and 1 hot sauce.  I also ordered baklava.. I love sweets!  The gyro meat was tender and flavorful without the white sauce.  Their hot sauce is definitely HOT. The chicken, for the most part was good, but it had dry chunks as well.  After a few bites without the white sauce, I decided to try some of it.  It was pretty good.  Added that \"umph\" to the meal.  I'd come back again.",

The white sauce people were raving about was very bland and the hot sauce wasn't to my liking either. It could be just me so still give it a shot. They got 2 stars cause of their hummus and pita. It was fairly good and they give you a good amount for $5. We ordered the combo plater with falafel then a side of hummus just so we can try most of what they had.

I was only ordering takeout and it was a really quick grab-and-go spot. You can also substitute falafel for one of the combo plates, which does take an extra 3 minutes to fry.  They also give you more than enough white and red sauce packets, and make you pay if you want extra. Beware with the red sauce because it is really spicy! Compared to the New York street carts, it doesn't taste exactly the same but its similar. Compared to the OC location, it's about the same to me.  It satisfies the craving but I would take New York over Vegas Halal Guys any day.",

It was the grand opening so there was a bit of a wait outside but luckily there was shade and they provided water.  The place was a lot smaller than it looks on the outside, but then again it's a spot to grab a quick bite. I had high expectations for this place since it was popular in New York. I ordered a small combo platter and wasn't too impressed with it. My chicken was dry and the beef gyro was also dry and pretty oily. It felt like I was eating hamburger meat. I was also expecting some lamb but sadly their gyro is just beef. The flavor wasn't all that special. The rice was decent but had no flavor to it. Their side salad is boring with just lettuce and diced tomatoes. The pita bread tastes like the ones that they sell in grocery stores.   I recommend going easy on the hot sauce first to see if you'll like it.  Overall, the workers were friendly and the place was clean - however, I don't feel my small platter was $9 worth so I won't be coming back.",

It is a very simple menu. You can order sandwich (pita wrap) or platter [ comes with delicious yellow basmati rice; your topping: chicken, beef gyro, combo-chicken & beef gyro, falafel; iceberg lettuce; tomato; 4pcs triangels pita]. The platter comes with 2 sizes (small $9.99 & regular $10.99). They have sides as well like  hummus, baba ganouj, falafel $1 each, fries. Baklava $2.49 for dessert.  I always order combo $10.99 & if you check in with yelp, you get a free baklava ($2.49). I love their yellow rice sooo gooddd. Their baklava is good too but it is a little bit to sweet for me.  If you get it to go, DON'T FORGET to get 2 WHITE SAUCE & 1 HOT SAUCE. Usually I put a lot of white sauce(1,5) & half of their hot sauce. BE CAREFULL w/ their hot sauce, VERY SPICY so put a little bit on your food and go from there. After you mix it all (for platter) & now your food is ready to eat!!! YUM YUM  VERY RECOMMENDED!!!",

I ended up ordering the half and half bowl on lettuce since rice wasn't an option. No substitution suggestions were made or apologies for the inconvenience. The taste of the food was below average, the hot sauce is extremely hot, not tasteful and the white sauce tasted like something from a school lunch or lunchable, overly processed and nasty. The temperate of the food was somewhat warm and far from hot. I wouldn't return and I wouldn't recommend spending your money here.",

Halal Guys would be a sketch. They offer falafel, which is a chickpea/ bean mixture that is fried.   My friend and I kept watch just in case any non-vegan contamination occurred because of my friend's diet. We observed that the gentleman had grabbed a pita that was TOUCHING the pile of chicken on the grill. Not sure if that is their way of keeping the pita warm, but this did not seem sanitary or effective.   Maybe the workers were new, but I'd hope to see (one day) that these workers will be aware of what is \"vegan\" and what is not. i.e their white sauce (which was almost drenched into the vegan gyro) is not vegan due to egg yolks. They do offer a different vegan sauce, so be cautious and keep watch.   My friend and I didn't make it a big deal, but this is a warning/ lookout for other vegans in the community.",

When I first arrived at this place, I was hoping for the same freshly cooked meats and fluffy rice I had in NYC. I instead got a plate of dried-out rice and reheated chicken which lacked flavor. I am not sure if they had over prepped food for the day and were trying to get rid of it or what happened, but nothing I tried made me want to go back.   Lastly, and for the number of people there (4, including us two), there was trash on the floor and more dirty tables than I expected. I guess I will have to wait until my next visit to New York to at the real deal again.",

    "text": "Ive eaten at the one in NY, LA and now here in Vegas. I have to say a big, thumbs down. Went here first on a Wednesday night around 5, super long line, but the food was hot and not dried out. Food was being cut from the rotisserie and fresh The next time I went here, my hubby and I were craving it on a Friday night (2/18/17). Went here around 10pm ( and keep in mind- this place is open until 2am) We ordered 2 gyro platters ($8.99)- combo of rice, iceberg lettuce, chopped tomato, gyro meat - side toppings include: jalapeno and onions Michelle checked us out and helped us.  NOTHiNG looked (or tasted) fresh: tomatoes were all pre chopped and super dried out- you know where the skin is all wrinkled and dehydrated, the meat was all cut up into little small pieces not in larger chunks (like how it usually it's when it is cut fresh from the rotisserie)- super oily as it had been sitting in the heating bin for a while, the pita was served cold- I watched as another girl put it on the grill for about 20-30 seconds, the rice- that was the worst part! The rice had this deep orange tint to it- not the usual yellow tint I'm used to- and it had def been sitting there for a while and not fresh- because the rice as it went into our mouths were super rock hard like little bee bee pellets. The only fresh thing was the salad (iceberg). And the worst was the large chunks of white onion. They put so much on and it was super spicy and sulfur tasting.  In general, the restaurant is very small and has about 5 tables. Can maybe sit about 20 people. The weirdest is the table right near the door ( so awkward).  Overall, I think the owner sold out. The quality has decreased significantly. The sauce packets of the white sauce and red sauce don't taste the same and the percentage of saturated fat in 1 white sauce packet alone is a whopping- 53%!! I know that lamb/beef gyro meat isn't the healthiest but dayum- 2 packets of white sauce will put u over the recommended daily saturated fat intake!  I'm am sad to say, after my experience here last night, the quality of the food made me not want to crave it anymore. I would give this 1 star, but I know the food could be so much better!   ****Yelp Check in!!: FREE Bahklava- crunch layers of filo dough with butter, sugar syrup, pistachios and nuts: Really delicious and great for breakfast or after snack ( doesn't need to be refrigerated)",

    "text": "Halal Guys opened in Vegas at the right time. After having the real thing in NYC last February, I thought I'd only be able to have it if I went back. Since then, Halal Guys started opening up in CA and other parts of the country. Vegas was lucky enough to be put on the map for Halal Guys!.   I recommend having the Gyro (beef) or Combo (beef and chicken) platter. It comes with a fixing of the meat of choice, rice, and diced tomato and lettuce. Listen to what the workers say with the sauce! You can never have too much white sauce but be careful with the red sauce. Even if you are a \"spicy\" kind of person, a couple drops of that red sauce can do the trick.  After having gone here a few times, unfortunately I must say that the quality and service is not consistent. That however doesn't stop me from trying again since it brings me back to NYC! I don't think it will ever taste the same or have the same feeling as having it outside after a long day walking in Manhattan.",

He keep banging the cook top nonstop while we eating then he mention if I want to sign up for a rewards card and register it to get a free drink, so I did when I ask him question how to register he simply said I don't know how go to the website and read the instruction(I was like ok???) Them while I'm sitting here eating and saw the bottom right of the menu said (ask about our locals offer!) ask him about the offer he said u suppose to told me your local to get the 10% discount, but I told him I did mention it when I first got in store he obviously doesn't care I'm done with this place HORRIBLE SERVICE AND FOOD TASTE OK  Ask for a manager this guy that been at the counter said he is the manager he won't be able to adjust my receipt for the local 10% offer he said I never mention I was local at the beginning of the order when I got to this place I told him I was local and he stand here and have the guts to tell me that I never mention I was local this guy ANGEL G is a joke, he said the discount only $1.10 it is not the discount it is the principle of this whole thing for manager arguing with me over a $1.10 discount is simply a JOKE!!!

    "text": "Things I love about The Halal Guys ~  The food! I always stick to what works for me here which is a beef/gyro bowl smothered with white sauce and drizzled with BBQ sauce. When all the delicious ingredients get mixed together it's truly a bite of heaven. (Gyro meat, rice, lettuce, tomatoes, a few small slices of pita and the sauces). The rice here is the best rice I've ever had! My man always gets the gyro sandwich with the same sauce combination and he loves it. Our food has been consistent and it's one of our favorite quick meals.   Side note ~ for all the chicken lovers like me. I'm not a fan of the chicken at all here and if you happen to be disappointed by it, you should give the beef a chance. It's AMAZING!  The cons ~   The service isn't consistently great but I can say that it is most of the time. The parking can be tight because this location is in a very small plaza with tons of other businesses. Small shop equals not too many tables & chairs so prepare to take yours to go occasionally. The decor is probably my least favorite part. I don't enjoy the hard & cold in winter metal chairs and I'd seriously love to give it a makeover and keep it modern but make it sleek & a little sexy.   But even with the cons, we truly love the flavors and the meat is incredibly flavorful. It's on the higher side as far as pricing goes but you'll taste where that comes from with the fresh ingredients. Also, don't forget to check-in on Yelp for your complimentary baklava which is a very nice touch and always delicious!",

Fortunately, the famous white sauce saved the meal. It only took 1 1/2 packs of white sauce to do the trick. Just beware of the red sauce - it's good and packs a mighty punch. I thought it would be similar to Louisiana Hot Sauce, but it's on a whole other level. I've never experienced heat like that before! Portions are generous and you'll be full for hours to come.

But I was pleased to have an amazing experience there!  The decor was fabulous, it reminded me of New York, it even had a New York mural on the wall. Options on the menu were very simple and to the point. All of the food is fresh, and their signature sauces are within reach on ice by the soda machines. I got a falafel platter, generous servings,  really good, and I drowned them in their amazing white sauce. My husband got one of the meat platter combos, that was great too!   We'll be back!

Although a few might not agree, I enjoyed the small store front and was a big fan of the minimal menu selection. I always worry about what to order especially when trying new locations so this made it real simple.   The customer service was well more than you'd expect from a 'fast food' joint. They have team members on the floor there to greet you and answer questions.   Unfortunately, aside from the white sauce, the meats were 'ehhh'. The chicken was really dry - the chicken seemed to all be cooked and piled together on top of the grill - not sure how long it was sitting there that day (we came for dinner around 5pm).   Ultimately, I'm sure I'll be back again. It's an awesome option for those late night cravings. Just a little disappointed and expected a bit more from the all mighty 'Halal Guys' from New York.

    "text": "So I came in on a Saturday to try the food. And I was dreading about having to wait in line for too long. Or that maybe they would've ran out of something by the time I get to the front of the line. To my surprise it wan't that busy. There was a substantial amount of people to make a line. But not bad enough that you have to wait for an hour to get food. The place wasn't too bad . You had enough room for tables and a queuing line without too much cramming.    I grabbed a large Chicken Plate and a Beef Gyro Plate (because that's just how much of a fat *** I am) and the process was a lot simpler than I thought it would be. Usually with hype places like these there would usually be an overwhelming menu where the good stuff is only like one or two and the rest is just there but no. You choose from either Chicken or Beef or Falafel or Chicken and Beef. Add the Lettuce, Tomatoes, and Rice and your all set.   Okay so on to the food. The Chicken was by far the better out of the two plates. It has that grilled aroma to it and the flavor was actually good. Not salty at all, not bland as well. They offer a white sauce that you can put on top of the plate for better flavor but the plate itself doesn't need it if you wanna stay on the healthy side.   The Beef Gyro was soft, not chewy at all. Could use a little salt in my opinion but you don't have too really. The white sauce does tie in nicely but too much of the white sauce kinda ruins it for me since I can't taste much of the food after I accidentally smeared the whole packet of white sauce onto the plate. The lettuce and tomato, I would probably hold off on it the next time I visit. Don't get me wrong, there's absolutely nothing bad about it. Its just they put too much for my taste and my fat *** doesn't feel like eating a salad.   They also offer a hot sauce which is REALLY hot! I didn't believe what the packet was telling me when it said \"Its really hot\" so yeah I put on a good amount and it burned. But the nice thing about the hot sauce is that the kick is good. The flavor of the food is still there. Unlike other hot sauces where all you can taste is the hot sauce itself and then comes the burn. Theirs actually start off with a nice kick along with the flavor of the food. And then you get to the second or third spoonful and you regret having put too much of it on one plate.   Overall, the food is pretty awesome. I probably wouldn't be hankering for another plate since the two I had would probably last me all the way to next week but I wouldn't have a problem coming back another time. I actually look forward to try the Falafel next time since my dad always tells me to go and try it. I will probably edit this review in the future for that. But for now I would recommend this place for those who are looking for something healthy and flavorful and those who are looking to get their grub on and just lather the plate with their signature white sauce.   Parking isn't a problem during peak hours but I would probably try going on Wednesday or non-peak hours so as not to end up looking for parking. Or worse, standing in a line.",

    "text": "I went here after reading some reviews on Yelp. However, when I was ordering an employee came out from the back and started chatting with the person serving me. She said she couldn't wait to go home because she was sick. I almost walked out at that point but they had pretty much already made my order so I would feel bad. I didn't get sick, but that was so off putting.  I had the combo plate because I wanted to try both meats. The meats were good but not great. The flavors didn't pop as much as I thought they would. The platter is basically a few cups of rice and lettuce and then topped with a bit of meat and other vegetables like olive, tomato, onion, jalapeno. I was a bit disappointed that for $10 they didn't give many sliced olives or onion. I think I had about 4 slices of olives (like canned sliced olives). Though there was a decent amount of meat. The pita bread was soft, warm, and almost doughy. It was good bread. The white sauce is basically just spiced mayonnaise if you read the ingredients, you will see it reads like a jar of mayo. The hot sauce was good, good spiced flavor and very very hot. Actually way too hot for me so I didn't have a savory spiced sauce to use. I wish they had a mild version of this sauce.  I'd give this place 3 stars, but the comment I heard about an employee being sick ruined it all.",

The infamous white sauce has great tasty kick and the addition of hot sauce makes for a fire sandwich. Throw on some tomato and lettuce on think pita and you got a great lunch. At $8.75 it is steep, but I think it's worth it every once in a while if you're craving spicy and are tired of the typical chipotle or panera lunch options.",

I ordered the large mixed platter ($9.99), a side of hummus ($4.99) and medium drink (a whopping $2.50), w/tax..I'm in for $19 (for lunch).  When you think Gyro, Pita pocket, hummus, etc, you want a True Mediterranean flare...it didn't happen.  The \"beef\" gyro wasn't flavorful.  The chicken...bland.   The hummus had way too much paprika and oil on it...plus it was pre-made (or bought) and didn't have a good, smooth texture.  We also had Babagonush, which way to smokey flavored  (almost artificial) and lacked a decent texture.   The killer was the single pita they gave you with the side order was pre-wrapped in foil and left in the steam tray to keep warm....the result....sauggy pita. .    The set up was similar to the ever so popular Chipotle style open kitchen.   The staff was nice but had no real knowledge if the food they were serving, nor the history of why this place was made famous in NYC.",

I got the falafel platter with no white sauce, my date got the gyro platter but just on pita bread. I also checked in so I got a free baklava which was a small portion but still really good! The server was very kind, even complimenting my date and I saying that we look good together. We took it in to go platter even though we dined in so we wouldn't have to bother the servers again. My platter was good, good portions, I got everything on it minus the jalapenos and white sauce. My falafel was okay. It was a little crispier than I like and the inside wasn't bursting with flavor. But it looked pretty! The olives were too salty. Also, there are hot sauce packets that come with it & they were WAY too spicy. I had maybe a pinch of sauce and it was overwhelmingly spicy. My date seemed to enjoy his gyro as he devoured it in minutes. I also got the hummus and an extra pita bread which was yummy. Good atmosphere, friendly staff and decent food. Thanks for serving us!",

    "text": "I'm a fan...but it's no NYC street cart. Yes the ingredients are the same, but something's different about this franchised version compared to the original food cart in NYC. I can't put my finger on it, but now that I've been to 2 franchised locations outside of NYC, I can tell that it's not quite identical.  The experience you get in NYC waiting for this delicious steaming hot platter of food- in cold or warm weather, sober or drunk, 11am or 2am- has always been positive for me. I've probably had it 7-10 times and it was always freaking delicious. Even when I picked up 4 orders and drove to Philly one weekend it was still glorious to share with friends. So why does the franchised version seem different? I can't really decide. It might be the rice, which was more dry, or the meat, which also seemed more dry and less seasoned. It might be the prepacked white sauce, which is probably now made in some commercial packing kitchen. The only consistent thing I found was the red (HOT) sauce, and the pita.  Tips: you always need more white sauce. Red sauce for spicy lovers- if a medium spicy person 6 drop of sauce will suffice. Low spice? try 2-3 drops.  This is good and will fufill a craving, but if you want the real deal, go here: <a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-halal-guys-new-york-2?osq=The+Halal+Guys\">yelp.com/biz/the-halal-g...</a>",

I got beef platter  Was enjoying my food and I felt something not like food in my mouth, so I took it out of my mouth and it was a long plastic. So I took the plastic thing to the manager and she told me if I want new food or the money back so I asked for my money back. At the time she did not give me the money because it was lunch time and she had a line, so I decided to wait but because I was very hungry I decided to eat the bread and the homus on my plate. So I went to her and asked for the money and she told me to show her the plate because she saw me eating from it, and I did, I had 90% of the food in my plate and she was telling me that she saw me eating from the plate so looks like I don't have a problem eating from the plate so she told me to throw away the dood so she could give me the money and I did..... Ok this is to the owner of this company, please let your management know that if someone has a problem with the food they should give refund and get the food back or make a new one because they did not ask for my food back.... Oh and the guys today was handling money with his glove and then using the same glove to serve food, that is a no no.....",

Honestly our whole group has been ordering this everyday on our trip in Vegas. We are now on our fourth day lol So I'm pretty halal guy'd out, but that goes to show that it's pretty tasty. Whether you're eating it fresh or microwaving it later, it still tastes really good. I know we have to stop by again before leaving to take some togo to our friends and family. Definitely a must try if you're in Vegas! We've ordered from the restaurant as well as ordering from Uber eats and have been satisfied with the food ordering from both.",

    "text": "I've been here a few times prior. I was here when they did a Yelp Elite event where they treated us to a platter of their signature Halal Guys goodness.   Whenever I would visit NYC, I would always visit The Halal Guys cart. Nothing beats getting yummy street eats and it's even better when you're standing there in the middle of winter getting a plate of piping, fresh, hot food. I was ecstatic when I found out they were expanding. I even went to their Costa Mesa location a week after it had opened. Alas, these stores will never be the original but I'm still happy that we have one that we could go to. Plus, they're opened until late late! So if you need a late night grub, this is the spot .. sort of.   The Halal Guys is famous for their lamb over rice platters. But you're able to get chicken over rice or even a combo over rice. I typically stick with their chicken over rice nowadays. Their lamb over rice is essentially Gyro meat over rice. The Gyro meat that they have at this particular establishment is a little bit on the oily side and I'm not sure if it's the same recipe as the one from the cart. As for the chicken, what I do notice is that a lot of the franchise places don't cut their chicken into the same small pieces as the original cart does. You'll occasionally find a huge chunk of chicken here and there on your platter.   What I do enjoy at this location compared to their Costa Mesa was that there is a sauce station. You are able to put as much sauce as you want. No one else does it for you. I typically put a lot of white sauce and a lot of red sauce as well. Be careful with the red sauce -- it is NO joke. If you think you can eat spicy, think again. Don't go squeeze crazy on that red bottle unless you know how spicy it can get. Without sauce, the platter is nothing so don't give me the whole, \"Not healthy and a lot of fat\" line. If you get your platter to-go, they usually give you two packets of the white sauce and one packet of the red sauce. What I typically do is .. go to the sauce station, squeeze how much I want into my platter and then I leave.   There is also an upcharge of $1 if you want extra rice. What I usually do is skip the veggies and have them put extra rice, because they like to pile half of the platter with lettuce. I mean, I didn't come to Halal Guys to eat a salad. So if you get a platter like mine, it'll run you about $10.99.   Overall, pretty decent place. I still miss the original. The ingredients were definitely more fresh from the cart because the turn over rate was much higher. They also give you more food at the cart. They pack the platter so full! However, this location is still okay. The sauces are on point and is definitely from their recipe. I would still come here if I was craving Halal Guys. It definitely saves me the cost of a plane ticket to NYC.",

I ordered the Chicken Platter. It was a sizeable portion for me and I didn't need to eat again that day. It's a really simple platter with chicken, iceberg lettuce, tomatoes, rice, and pita bread. The pita bread was nice and soft. The chicken is cut into tiny pieces and moist, but it's pretty plain. I found that the white sauce was necessary to flavor the dish. At 330 calories a packet to add flavor I'm not sure I would enjoy this often. I liked the hot sauce since it really packs heat and is unique from hot sauces at other restaurants. The rice is also simple and free of any exciting flavors.   Overall, the food is good, but it doesn't excite me. I'll eat there again when my coworkers are ordering through Uber Eats, but I probably wouldn't go out of my way to get The Halal Guys.",

That orange rice, chicken, gyro, lettuce, and tomato, drizzled with that white and red sauce, all mixed together...Mmmmm...The hype was real, and I wanted to go back the next day!   When I heard that they were opening a Halal guys in Vegas, I was ecstatic, and I was dying to have it again. However, for some particular reason, it just wasn't as good as the first time I've had it in Cali. I've been to this location twice now, and the ingredients don't seem as fresh; the meats were really dry as well. The white sauce is as good as I remember it to be, and I think the red sauce is a little tamer here (warning: it'll still burn your insides out if you consume too much). I got to try their crinkle cut fries this last time, and it was surprisingly good. Hot, fresh, crispy, and crunchy. Also, if you're gonna get the platter, go with the large, because it is significantly larger than the regular size for just $1 more.   The service has always been good. Overall I would give this place a 3.5 rating, but due to the friendly and helpful staff, I am bumping them up to a 4.",

So after finishing up at the bars one night, I stopped over at 2am for a regular combo platter.  Regular Combo Platter -- <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2iqpy8u&s=69d7cd48cdf78190aba6b8fab21b741b22dc4667b0e721e7f933c342b26d40dc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/2iqpy8u</a> Best thing to eat at 2am in Vegas, or anywhere!  One aluminum pan loaded with chicken, gyro, rice, salad, and pita bread.  I could've opted for the Large size, but this was plenty of food for me.  And oh yeah, you gotta have them smother it with their white sauce!  Granted, it's not the same experience as the outdoor carts in NYC.  It's more expensive and there's no real rush from ordering, at least when I went.  But it's still worth it!  Vegas and Halal Guys definitely go hand in hand.  It's such a satisfying plate of meat and rice that just hits the spot late at night after having drinks on the Strip.  And they're not too far away from the Strip, just a short drive or cab ride away.  Definitely hit them up when you have a chance!",

The red sauce is one of the spiciest condiments I have ever had, so be very cautious with this one.  Baklava is decent and not too sweet. Falafel is also pretty good too!

The energy of the staff was very low , I interpreted this as they could care less bout quality and cleanliness . Just there to collect a check.  Sorry I will not be Dining here as the lack of care to food and cleanliness come through .  The saving grace for this Resturant will be the location (heavy traffic ) and name recognition .

Also, love the fact that I can put as much sauce as I want on the food because you guys have a sauce bar that allows us to have as much sauce as we want.   On top of this I had the BEST service ever from Johnnie. She was very courteous and friendly. One of the nicest fast food employees ever--the kind of service you expect from a great restaurant, not fast food. This is definitely one of the best Halal Guys anywhere, and I will be back. Love you guys!!!",

Do you add lettuce and tomato, come out at all of us, pickled onions and even jalapenos and green bell pepper. Great sandwich. I checked in and got a free baklava. Was disappointed in the baklava, because it did not contain either pistachios or honey, And so what is a baklava without those ingredients. But all in all, I would give it a four and a half star",

    "text": "I was so excited that Halal guys came to Vegas! I literally had it as my last meal of 2016. I kind of regret that I did though because it was one of the worst halal guys I've had. We dropped by around 4pm to get 8 orders.  At every other Halal guys I've been to, I noticed that the meat is much fresher. Majority of the time, the meat came straight off the grill. Perhaps this place is slower than others because all of the meat was on the warmer and looked like it had been there for a while. There were even burnt, hard pieces at the bottom of the platter. They also skimp on the rice here a lot compared to others, I asked if they could fill it up more but she said that it was extra which is a little ridiculous. There was no extra rice option on the menu and I have asked before at other locations.   Overall, portions are smaller and meat is not as fresh at this particular location. I'm sure this meal would taste better the later it gets at night. However, I wouldn't recommend eating this for a daytime meal :/",

    "text": "So I am in Vegas and went to visit a friend who was renting  a house.. And wanted to eat something more than the fried chicken and pizza they had. (Mind you in hanging with my brother an a bunch or men.. So there were no sides or anything just meat.. Lol) do I got on Uber eats and saw this place.. Usually I look up reviews but I was so hungry I didn't... Oh how I wish I had!   So I ordered the Falafel platter that came with rice Lettuce 2 tomatoes and pita bread with 2 'white sauce' and hot sauce.. Now is it just me or do they just call it 'white sauce' I thought it was suppose to be some type of yogurt sauce.. Now remember I said it came with 2 tomatoes, yea no it came with crushed tomatoes.. And don't get me started on the falafel.. It was just a frozen falafel that they fried too long and it just made them hard.. Plus aren't falafels round?! Well mine were roundish more round/square.. After a few bites I was over it.. They were so hard to eat and the rice OMG it was orange and smelled and tasted like mop water.. I just couldn't stomach it anymore.. I hated to throw my food away but I couldn't eat any more.. The 'white sauce made it tolerable for the few bites I did have.. But at the end of the day it was $20 right down the drain.. Dish was $12 but I used Uber Eats so was lil more..   So if you have to order take out DO NOT I REPEAT DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS PLACE! It was so not tasty at all! And I HATE to throw food away.. So it took a lot for me to make that decision, most times I'd suffer through it if I was hungry, but I guess I wasn't that hungry or it was just that gross!",

Now on to the second decision, what kind of meat...beef or chicken? I couldn't decide, then the guy asked if I wanted to try the proteins. My eye lit up. I was so happy!! The Asian in me was so happy for samples. I was glad he gave me a sample it help me determine on which proteins to get. Overall great service and good food!",

This is me explaining my experience at other halal establishments.  If you check my yelp you can see I'm very generous with stars for great service and food. But I have had nothing but anger for this specific establishment. I ordered through the app for delivery and wrote no rice and tomatoes which they gave me as well as missing white sauce. That is not that bad, I've had mistakes happen before no big deal. I've called them for the past day receiving nothing but a voicemail. You guys open from 10-4, as you can see  you don't care enough for your customers who just wanted to switch for a different dish. I didn't want credit or free food, but no one cares about customer satisfaction. Go elsewhere. The stars say it all.",

Thank goodness for UBEREATS! Searched and found these guys, delivered curbside to our hotel-lifesaver indeed!  We ordered 3 combo plates: came with chicken, beef, lettuce, tomatoes, and pita bread. I must say the portion size is awesome!!! It was perfect for us 6 to share. The meat was tender, rice was perfectly cooked and well seasoned, and Their WHITE SAUCE is the $#!+ we all love it, it's like crack! It's good on everything!!! No lie, we ordered extra(although there was no need cause it came with plenty), had a package we didn't use, saved it in the fridge. Ordered White Castle the next day and ate it with the WHITE SAUCE. One word.....LEGIT!   So you know how when you go to a place and you order \"spicy\" and then the food come out and your like...\"wahhh? Where's the kick?\" Well their hot sauce it also LEGIT. The mister loves spicy and can handle a lot, this is pretty comparable to when his friends make  papaya salad with +15 peppers! Definitely not for the faint at heart, Love it!  We also ordered a side of their hummus and it was delicious. The only downside to this is that it came with only one piece of pita bread......one. Definitely not enough and I would recommend ordering extra.   To think you guys started in NY selling from a small cart on the streets.....amazing. I wish you had a location near me :( until next time.....",

And the beef was seasoned perfectly. Everything in the platter went together so well including the pita, rice and the veggies. The white sauce was good but I was expecting more of an awesome flavor based on the hype but it was still good. I was kinda hesitant to try the red sauce because a lot of the reviews said it was too spicy but I liked it and I used it sparingly and it still provided a good spice.   Also tried the baklava it was ok just a little sweet and not enough of the nut layers and I felt like for the price of $2.49 for a small slice was kinda overpriced.   The only reason I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the service. I came in for lunch and there were only two people ahead of me. And their orders got messed up so the staff ended up taking my combo platter that was already packaged and just waiting to get to the front of the line to the cashier, and they gave it to the party ahead of me so I had to wait about 5 minutes for another one to be made for me. They also had to repeat me order about two or three times after that mix up. Hopefully they work on their service flow.",

Must have been about 12 people in the kitchen so you can imagine the wait time for our food was just non-existent.  Me not being the most patient of people absolutely loved that.    The air conditioning wasn't working when we went today, no biggie, there were fans all over the place and they were trying to actively get it fixed.   The staff was super friendly.   The white sauce was endless and kept at a nice cold temperature.  My favorite thing about them is the portion size. For $10 for the combo plate, I was absolutely stuffed (and I can eat a ton).

I got the beef plate & hubs got chicken/beef combo plate. I do love Greek food so I had high expectations. I'm sorry to say but it wasn't all too great for us. The meat was a bit tough & rice was a little hard & tasteless. The soft pita was good tho. I tasted my hubs chicken & that tasted okay. Better than the beef. I had olives & that was super salty. Don't know if those type of olives are suppose to be that salty but the juice that was with it turned parts of my plate just really really salty. Good thing it was a small scoop of it. The white sauce made the plate taste a little better at least. The staff was really nice tho (reason why I gave 3-stars). I did a check-in on Yelp & I was able to redeem a FREE slice of baklava. That was good! It was good to try the place out but not a place where I can get a good fix for Greek food tho",

Halal Guys usually has a short line but the ordering process seems to take longer than most fast food restaurants. I would classify this restaurant as fast casual.  Dining inside is a bit of a nightmare as there's no good seating anywhere. However, they do have plenty of it. There's modular tables so they can stack next to each other for up to I'd say 8 people before it encroaches into the ordering line.  If you order a gyro style sandwich, you have to pay a lot more for rice than if you order a combo. It's a big difference too, like $3 or something like that. Makes no sense to me. That's literally my biggest gripe with this place is the clear overcharging for a side of rice.  As far as loyalty rewards they sometimes have a locals discount, but at other times I'm not sure they have had it. It's something I heard about while sitting in line. Also make you carry the rewards card around. Time to get with the digital age and either do an app or use my phone number like everyone else!",

    "text": "When I found out Vegas was finally getting our very own Halal Guys I was giddy as giddy can be! But when I took my very first bite I was sadly disappointed. I stopped going here for months to give them time to sort their shit out.   Surprise surprise. They really turned themselves around since the grand opening days. I'm really glad I gave them another shot since the taste and quality of their food got much better.  The first few times I came here, everything was bland, they skimped out on meat and were sloppy and not consistent with their plating. Now they have everything down to a science and starting to almost taste like like their big brother in New York (alas it will never be the same as a gritty grill cart on the street) but it will satisfy the urge. Plus it's more convenient than a flight to NYC.  The beef gyro here is my favorite! However, for first timers, why not sample everything to see what your favorite is? I recommend trying the Halal Classic (mix combo platter): chicken & beef gyro, yellow rice and a simple side salad. I always ask them to add olives and onions as well. \"The perfect bite\" is with a little bit of protein, rice, salad - make sure it's all sauced up! A bite with the salad adds a crisp texture and also the pita triangles are fabulously soft and so fluffy - mix it all up and dig in! It's an explosion of flavor! If you still don't want to take the plunge to try the beef gyro, the chicken & rice is decent. I just love the beef gyro though.  Their babaganoush isn't shabby and I also like their falafels, if I am in the mood.   Make sure to try their 4 different sauces:   1. Creamy white sauce - Don't be shy and drizzle a good amount of their \"crack\" sauce! 2 and a half sauce packets (or more) will do the trick. It really takes the food to delicious heights and adds a wonderful creaminess. Less is more doesn't apply to this. More is MORE!!!  2. BBQ sauce - I know, don't let that weird you out! Drizzle a little over your platter, mix it in and go from there. It adds the perfect sweetness to the food, balances everything out, without weighing down the dish. Love it!  3. Hot sauce - That Red Devil Sauce. Swell up your tongue and face type of situation. I love the hot sauce because it's unique to Halal Guys and it has bold flavor. It heats up every morsel and really brings the dish to life! Just make sure to use it sparingly (start with a dot and work your way up from there)   4. Tahini - Toasted ground hulled sesame seed sauce. It has a rich nutty flavor and pairs nicely with the falafels.   I won't say this location will blow your socks off like the cart did to me in NYC. But the flight to NYC is a further reach than dealing with the differences here. Dig in!",

My daughter is 8 and it's her favorite, too.   This location gets five stars because of the amazing worker that serviced me here.

First, You can choose from either a platter or a pita bread sandwich that already comes equipped with lettuce and tomato or you can tell them to hold the veggies. After that, you select your meats (chicken, beef gyro, combo, or falafel). Finally, you have additional toppings to choose (jalapenos, pitted black olives, and peppers). Oh yeah, I can't forget the sauces! They top your item off with a creamy white sauce.  If you're like me and dip food into a sauce after every bite, they have it next to the drink dispensary for people to grab.   Btw, the two other sauces provided are BBQ sauce and HOT sauce (literally hot). I don't know what peppers they used but it's flaming. I guess that's why they have the white sauce displayed for your own protection lol  Today I preferred the beef gyro sandwich because I had to order to go and I can eat this using my hands. It cost me only $8.99 with a drink $2.49  P.s. if you check in, you get a free Baklava dessert! Trust me it's really good!",

    "text": "So I had the original halal guys in NYC... Is this the same... Sadly no. But it is cool that they are here in Vegas in a store front instead of on the open streets. Just for that alone I give them props.   I had the beef gyro sandwich and my bf had the beef gyro platter. The sandwich was decent. I added the onions, been peppers and olives to my dish and it added more texture and flavor. On my next visits I got the platter as well and added everything in it again. The flavor is good.... Maybe it's the nostalgic memories but the flavors are great. I would recommend the platter as I think it's a better deal overall... And I would pass on the rice as I do not think that it had alot of flavor. 4/5  I would also recommend eating in instead of take out... Why? My main reason would be the sauce. When you get your items to go... They charge you extra for extra sauce BUT when your are dining in.... You can get as much sauce as you want by taking the squeeze bottles directly to your table. :)   And the hot sauce is actually spicy so be careful! And they are stored in a cold table by the drink station so you know that the sauces are kept cold and sanitary and I appreciate it.   Their baklava is ok... But u can't complain since it was free!! Lol   Ambiance... It's ok... It always feels a little cold to me... But I go there for the food so I'm ok... But I think that the decor could be changed. 3/5  Service is normally on point.  As soon as you walk in... You are greeted and if you tell them that you have never been... They explain the menu to you. 5/5  So far so good. I have not been disappointed since I've started to come here.",

I've tried the combo with chicken & gyro but I usually just get the chicken platter.  The chicken isn't dry & it's flavored well.  I'm the platter comes lettuce, tomatoes, rice & meat.  They also give you their white sauce and hot sauce.  Now, their white sauce is really good, it brings the platter together.  But their hot sauce is some next level spicy.  It's not like a Tabasco hot, it's like a Siracha hot x 10.  I literally take it put a little on a napkin put the smallest amount on the tip of my fork with each bite. Serious props to those who put it directly in their food!",

Very limited seating, but the counter seats have several outlets for charging phones and tablets (that's a nice feature).  Parking is kind of tight, but that's nothing new in any of the shopping centers on Spring Mountain.    Would I go back?  Only if a friend wanted to try it.  Would I recommend it?

    "text": "This is my first time trying the Halal Guys even though I've walked by the original stand in NYC multiple times during travels. I came in the day before their grand opening and ordered two regular combo platters and a baklava. One platter comes with two packs of white sauce and one pack of red sauce. After drizzling about one pack of white sauce over the platter, I mixed the entire bowl up because I hear that's how New Yorkers like to eat it - in rush and on-the-go. The food tasted great. After having a few bites I definitely felt like it needed a little more white sauce, reaching for that second pack. Just a warning, their red sauce is extremely spicy. Before drizzling it on your food definitely try a bit first. One platter may seen like just enough of a portion on the surface, but I actually wasn't able to finish the entire bowl! Ate a little more than half of it and was stuffed. $10 for a regular combo is definitely enough for two meals for me. However, the baklava was quite a small portion for $2.50.   The restaurant space is pretty small. There's four tables, each seats four, and a small high top bar table against the wall that seats a couple more. This type of food is meant to be taken to go, so honestly the small space isn't too bad. I do hope they fix the air-conditioning soon! The service is good, very fast and efficient. It was a great experience trying their food for the first time. I can definitely see myself coming back for more during lunch!",

It is slightly more expensive and you don't get as much food but if you're craving Halal Guys type Mediterranean than this is a good spot for your fix.  Just keep your expectations low.

So naturally I've been pretty excited about them opening up here in Vegas.  It just didn't live up to the hype. Almost every gyros I've had on the street in New York was better than this one.  The best part was the red sauce. I was warned that it was spicy. I generally thumb my nose at what other people consider spicy, so I dumped red sauce all over my sandwich. It was that kind of spicy that hits you like a punch to the stomach.  The pita was fluffy but stiff.   The meat, which was chopped as finely as taco meat, was bland. And there wasn't nearly enough of it. My sandwich was pretty much all tomatoes.  But the unforgivable sin? The white sauce. The legendary Halal Guys white sauce is freaking mayonnaise. I thought it was going to be some variation on tzatziki but it's spiced mayonnaise.  I always saw The Halal Guys' using the slogan \"we are different.\" Putting mayo on a gyros is different, all right.  I wish I liked this more.",

The menu consists of just the items mentioned above with a few sides like fries, hummus, bakalava. It through me off  a little with how simple the menu was but it's not unlike other places like raising cane's and in and out where they just do one main item well.   The place is fast food, so your in and out or you can dine in their dining area. The food experience was pretty good. I got the combo platter with chicken and gyro meat. They ask if you want side toppings like onions, jalapeno, olives etc. I liked the gyro meat better than the chicken personally but my girlfriend liked the chicken. The gyro meat was a little bit greasy so keep that in mind if you can't decide between the meats and grease/oil isn't your thing.Than there's their white sauce which is like the \"special sauce\". It's really rich and creamy with probably a mayonnaise or cream base. I was expecting a tzatziki type sauce like you find in most gyros but it was different. It's not tangy or herb tasting like tzatziki just creamy. They also have barbecue sauce which I didn't try and hot sauce. Careful, their hotsauce actually is quite spicy even for a spicy lover myself.   Overall this is a cool place to get a quick Mediterranean/halal meal. Something different right in the center of the Asian food scene around it. Not bad, not amazing but definitely different.",

My combo platter was very bland, had to add a ton of white sauce to make it somewhat edible. The meat was super dry, more like dehydrated meat and the rice was hard no flavor. I have to say pictures look better then it taste. Don't be fooled!",

We laughed cause she was a True salesperson. Told her that her confidence should be in timeshares with me.  Falafel sandwich was good and not overcooked. Price wasn't too over the top. Next time I will get the platter and bring my son to see what he thinks about it since he's not eating meat this month. Happy to have food venues from the east coast other than pizza here in Vegas.",

Got chicken and gyro combo platters.  The portion is huge for the regular which is $1 more than the small. Yay for leftovers!    The meat (chicken especially) was dry and the rice as well.  Not much else to say....dry is dry is dry.  I was real curious to try the white sauce that is raved about.  It is like a mayonnaise based version of tzatziki. The red sauce is like the ghost pepper sauce of HEAT! (Never had ghost peppers, but I would imagine this is how it would burn...haha). Tasty, but it will have you sweating with a runny nose!   The staff was super nice and cheery in their cute, yellow shirts.  The food was just okay though.",

Also like I mentioned in my tip, SMOTHER that shit in more white sauce. And even if it looks like enough, NO you are wrong. Smother that shit some more until your whole platter is basically swimming in it. And I guess you can add a dot of hot sauce. Unless you wanna take a fireball dump in the morning I suggest listening to everyone else's warning about how hot it is. It's no joke! That hot sauce could burn through my soul.   It's located on Valley View & Spring Mtn, you can't miss those lovely red letters! The space is tiny but has a few tables and also some seating by the walls. Workers were suuuuper nice and even offered us free mini bottles of water.   Again, extra white sauce, hot sauce and BBQ sauce is located by the soda machines. You already know. USE IT WELL.   The platter itself was bomb. I am devouring my leftovers as I write this and it is still bomb as a leftover! It comes with rice, few slices of pita and some lettuce and tomato. Of course the one in New York will always be the very best, but this will satisfy the cravings until I can go back again :)   And another great thing about this place is that it's open until 4am. YAAS for one of the best drunk foods!",

A quaint location on Spring Mountain & Valley View -- the staff was friendly, the venue was clean & the food was savory!   FOR HER:  - Beef gyro FOR HIM:  - Half chicken & half beef combo platter  The meal was very tasty, & its True -- you cannot have too much of their \"white sauce,\" which is just so complimentary to the meal. They also have a red explosive hot sauce, which is definitely no joke! Even as a lover of all things spicy, he said this should be used sparingly as it can be a bit overpowering. We also tried the baklava, which was truly made to perfection. The perfect sweetness & size to end the meal!   PRO TIP: They are open until 4:00AM and are not too far from the Las Vegas strip! Which is perfect for those late night, post clubbing eats! :)",

I grew up in OC where they also have a location and I was craving this for dinner. As I walked in, the location seemed a little small (think small taqueria/Mexican restaurant).   So the service is really where this particular location lost stars. I waited around 10 minutes for anyone to even service me. There was only 1 person ahead of me, but the employees decided to attend to other duties before serving the customer. The manager ended up coming out to take my order but she was terrible as well.  Instead of being friendly about taking my order, she was very cold and rude, trying to tell me the price for everything even though I told her it's fine. She stopped mid order to look at the grills/clean them when the cook was already there. Complained about how he was cutting the chicken too big, grease on the floor in front of me (the customer).   Honestly she could have waited to talk to him after she was done ringing me up instead of embarrassing the poor guy.   Meh, won't be back to this location, but I still love Halal Guys.",

We ordered a chicken platter and a combo chicken/gyro platter. The rice was nice and fluffy, and the meats were hot and moist. The pita had been steamed over the hot chicken cooking on the flat top and was soft and pliable with chicken juices. The self serve sauce bar was being constantly checked and refilled (BEWARE that hot sauce! It's not for the faint of heart.) and it was decently busy when we arrived.  The customer service here was and is attentive and consistently good.   Would I come back? Sure. If The Halal Guys can deliver a consistent good experience like this one, I'll be back as a regular customer...especially when I have late night/early morning cravings for that white sauce!",

Checking out the place seems very small, and can only sit a limited amount of people which is a downfall. I ordered the Beef Gyro. The inside of the gyro contains small thin cuts of beef patties, lettuce, and tomatoes with the white sauce. I assumed the white sauce is ranch. I like the combination of all the flavors when I took my first bite. Such a simple Ingredient, definetly great taste. They do offer different sauce of bbq, white sauce, and red hot sauce which is very spicy.   I love it and I don't regret it. They do have a lot of staff to help the line flow smoothly and everyone is very nice. Will visit soon again just a heads up parking is definetly hard to find in this small commercial area.",

We waited sometime to be acknowledged while chicken station girl attended to using her metal spatulas on a metal hot grill. This noise was as piercing as you could imagine. Finally she turns around to help and barely scooped my proteins from my combo platter order onto my plate. I was surprised to see a restaurant once at the peak of service, be so sloppy and inattentive.  Homeless people were coming up to us in the dining room for cash. Tables were left crumbed because no one was on the floor attending to customers. I'm not turned off by this place forever, but I will most certainly not be around anytime soon until these kinks are worked out.",

The flavor is still there though so I still finished my small platter.  I'm totally down to give it another try (3rd time's the charm).",

Totally Americanized and not that great of quality. The meat wasn't bad, but was strangely reminiscent of tacos. I'm not sure why the white sauce is what makes them famous, as it was literally just like some blend of mayo and ranch. I asked if they had tzaziki sauce, and she had no idea what that was and said that the white sauce was the same thing. It was definitely not a Greek yogurt and cucumber dip. Haha.   Also, the prices are way too expensive for the mediocre quality. For two combo plates and a side of hummus, it was 27 dollars. And most of the plate consisted of iceberg lettuce , diced tomato and rice (Eg cheap filler). Their \"salad\" had no dressing and the service also was subpar. The cashier was nice but everyone else behind the counter was rude and didn't even get my simple order correct. the menu is so small. Definitely disappointed.",

We always get combo platters with beef and chicken, but the main ingredient that makes this place amazing is the white and red sauce. In my opinion without those sauces the food won't hold up. The white sauce is creamy and delicious, while the red sauce is extremely spicy, but in small quantity it can add more flavors. They used to keep the bottles of these sauce on side, but it seems like they know that can make more money by giving one packet per combo and then selling you extra sauce packets, which is  a bummer. But if I ran the business I would absolutely do that.  They also sell baklava, which is awesome. Yelp check-in gets you a free baklava as well.",

First, if you know anything about Gyro, Shwarma or Doner kebabs they are made on a spit grill that turns and in the process the fat gets extracted at the bottom of the pan. These guys just put all the meet on a large industrial fryer and the meet is soaked and drenched with oil! Furthermore, this meet is ground-meet and tastes like spicy hamburger or Chopli kabob from Pakistan or India. The servers are nice people but have absolutely no knowledge of the type of food they are serving! If you like  minced spicy hamburger meet drenched in fat and oil with some mayo and hot sauce this may be the right place.

Great staff; friendly and helpful throughout our stay. Used the yelp check in for free dessert. Baklava was a little sweet, but that didn't stop us from eating it. Water machine stopped dispensing water, which was a little weird but not a deterrent from coming here again soon. Also great late night food to pickup or get delivered.",

    "text": "We tried Halal guys the first time at the beginning of the summer in July. Wow, the flavor was amazing. My wife and I split a large combo plate of chicken and beef and ordered a side of falafel. We flew in that morning without eating breakfast so we were both pretty hungry and that platter and side filled us up, all for under $20. We loved the white sauce (I'm more of a sauce guy than my wife, so I loaded it on) and their hot sauce is very hot! I like spicy but a few drops is even pretty spicy. I preferred the beef over the chicken but my wife liked both equally and I still thought  the chicken was pretty good. The falafel were fresh and hot and very good as well. We got the platter loaded( onions, olives, and jalapenos.) The kalamata olives are excellent so I would recommend them if you like olives. The only thing I wish the platter had more was the pita bread since there was so much food and I like to make a little sandwich with the pita. The next time we ordered the exact same thing but with an extra side of pita.   The first trip (five days) we went to halal guys twice and we made another trip two weeks later and made sure we hit halal guys again. I wanted to try the dessert but each time I was too full to  try them. We went during lunch time each time and they were not super crowded. The service was excellent and pretty speedy. I feel the value of the meals was awesome especially since it is pretty close to the strip where everything is overpriced anyway. I know on our future trips to Las Vegas we will definitely hit Halal guys.",

    "text": "I was super excited to try this spot with all the hype!! I definitely wouldn't say that it's gross and that I'll never come back, but....it's not anything life changing either. I ordered the gyro and chicken platter. I like al dente rice with a nice chew but this rice was borderline undercooked. The meat was a bit overcooked and dry as well. I think the two most disappointing things about my meal was that the white sauce wasn't what I expected and the falafel was horrible. The white sauce I expected to be a cool and refreshing tzatiki sauce but it honestly tasted like a mild ranch dressing so I wasn't about that and will definitely pass on that white sauce packet next time. The falafel was fried beyond recognition and super coarse and dry. I love a good falafel, this just didn't hit the mark. Looking forward to trying the original location in NY someday to compare the difference. I'll be back here to give if another shot in a few weeks though!",

If you're going to compare the food sold here from the New York stall, please save your breath. It isn't and will never be that. Go fly to New York if you're really that keen to talk about it.  I always order the combo platter since that's the dish that started it all from the original stall by time square. It's fast, its easy and really yummy as well. They even hooked it up with a yummy dessert just for checking in on yelp yelp.  The place was really nice. I think the location was brand new. Very well kept as well. Would definitely come back and eat here again.  Thank you so much for reading my review. I hope this helps with your decision making experience. Enjoy your awesome yelptastic day!",

The prices are descent as are the portions, but the meats are just not very good. Still cannot decide which i like less, the chicken was dark meat, the beef rather dry, a mix of both seemed best. The white sauce is pure mayo, I would much prefer a garlic or yogurt type sauce, the red is very spicy, but needed to cut the thickness of the mayo. Not bad, but also not worth returning for.",

By the drinks they have the white and red sauce to put as much as you want. Be careful with the red sauce because it is extremely spicy! The white sauce is amazing!!! Combined with the platter and the sauce with a side of hummus... died and gone to heaven!   Only thing I wish could improve was the pitas... I just like my pitas a little bit with a crunch but that's generally a personal preference and nothing to do with this establishment.",

    "text": "WARNING: the hot sauce is EXTREMELY HOT! I made the mistake of trying Halal Guys in NY and dousing my platter in hot sauce, don't follow in my footsteps unless you can handle spice.  On to the review... This franchise is famous for their NY street cart Halal food, now with multiple locations across the USA. They have a very simple menu offering: Chicken, Beef Gyro, Combo, or Falafel in a platter (rice, lettuce, tomato and pita) or in a sandwich (pita). Regular is a couple dollars more and a substantially larger portion. I ordered the Regular Combo Platter.  Beef Gyro: A+  WOW. The beef is incredibly seasoned to the max and extremely tender. The other people saying the food is bland either didn't try the beef gyro or had their taste buds burned off from the hot sauce. One of the best Halal meats I've tried over the years.  Chicken: B The chicken was solid, but not nearly as good as the beef. It still had a good flavor, could be slightly more tender. Better than the street cart I had in NY though.  Pita: B+ The pita is pretty basic, but I like it. Very soft and fluffy, goes great with the meat and white sauce. Scoop up some of the lettuce and tomato and you got yourself a mini gyro sandwich!  Sauce: A+ White sauce adds a creaminess that compliments the meats wonderfully while the hot sauce adds a new dimension of flavor. I suggest taking one sauce packet and dabbing/mixing it into the meat conservatively if you can't handle too much spice.  Service was fast and friendly. There's plenty of seating. This location is more like a cafe than a sit down restaurant with service though. This Halal Guys just might be my new favorite spot in the area for Halal food.  Food: 5/5 Value: 4/5 Service: 4.25/5 Overall: 4.75/5",

I enjoy their pita bread, white sauce, and hot sauce (be careful & cautious!). It's a light yummy but filling meal. The only negatives I experienced so far were their AC being broken, they forgot my to go hot sauce and white sauce, & their condiment bottles were all empty at the stand. There's a dozen or so employees helping but the sauces got overlooked. That's the best part! Hope to come back with these first bumps in the road resolved.",

The meats were fresh and weren't dry like my experiences in the past. The sauces were out and you could add as much as you wanted to without asking the staff to get the bottles. A hardy meal for under $10 bucks! Get the regular size, it is a dollar extra!   Vibes: It was late and there was surprisingly not a lot of people inside so not bad at all.   Service: Staff was friendly and patient because it took my friends and I a while to order so I appreciate your patients!",

We went on opening day all though there was a line didn't wait that long but 20 mins wait in Vegas outside is long esp it's hot as hell outside! Lol   Food was good enough! The got the combo w/ chicken and beef gyro! If u don't know the original NYC cart serves chicken and lamb you'll be amazed but since we've been eating chicken and lamb for a while know we can tell the difference. Also the rice is diff. Idk Mybe I'm just a little bias since I'm fr NYC. It's also more expensive than NYC, Combo in NYC is about $7 Mybe $8 now. In Vegas it's $10.   It was good enough to satisfy cravings but def not NYC good hehe! Will still come back tho from time to time!   Don't forget the white sauce! Be careful of the hot sauce coz it's very spicy!",

When they opened about a month ago, the wait was almost 15-20 minutes outside in the heat but the last I went, we were 2 out of the 7 customers that were there.   Their potions are very generous, in my opinion, especially when I asked them to exclude the veggies from my plate. The chicken is my favorite and you can never have enough of that white sauce.   One star off because it seemed like some workers were just standing around while some workers were constantly moving. Maybe I'm being a little judgmental but the worker at the register was literally leaning on the counter with her elbows and staring off into space.   Also, during their opening, their AC was broken so I was sweating in there but I didn't mind because it was packed. The last time I was there, the AC was blasting almost to the point where it seemed over exaggerated because it was already cool outside. It was just overall uncomfortable in there. Hopefully a happy medium next time.",

    "text": "Been here a few times so far. Before grand opening (Yelp Elite event) and also after my recent trip to NYC and trying the real deal.   This wasn't the first brick & mortar location ive been to. The first one I went to was the first B&M one opening in Costa Mesa last year...? Overall it is similar food wise, but service upon initial opening and what not was night and day. Not sure if the hype was dead by the time it opened in vegas or what.. but vegas never got hour long lines, fortunately. Lol  Even pre-opening event with yelp, they had sufficient amount of staff to get the lines moving fairly quick. Which is great !   Coming here after opening, there was little to no lines, ever. During the day or even during dinner time. Prices are not as good as the NYC carts of course, nor are the portion sizes.   At $9.99 for a combination platter, they tend to load more veggies and less rice and meat (even after requesting for less veggies and more rice). I feel like there is something missing in terms of flavor but it satisfies at least. With each order, they provide 2 packs of their signature white sauce and 1 pack of their signature red sauce. Be fore warned, if you had not been already, the red sauce is extremely spicy for most people.   After you get your food and pay, I like to go to the sauce area and put the sauce myself from the sauce bottles. I don't believe there is a restriction saying you cant but I like saving the sauce packets for other uses. (halal guys white sauce mixed with turmeric rice from Persian food take out is good xD and the red sauce adds a great punch and spice to pasta with a red sauce)  Overall, im happy they opened a location in vegas and its kind of convenient (though parking could be a disaster). Would be nice if they can modify the portion size a bit.",

I got a combo plate with chicken and gyro and it was delicious.  The white sauce is amazing and I drenched my plate in it several times and could've done so a few more.  The hot sauce is extremely hot so be careful as a few drops will do ya!  The only thing I didn't like was the falafel.  This was my first time trying falafel so maybe I just don't like them but they were really dry and tasteless which was a complete turn around from the rest of my meal.    The food was great but the restaurant needs some work.  We came on opening weekend in the summer and the air was broken, which is understandable but still sucked.  The restaurant is so tiny too with maybe four tables and 3 bar stools which is not ideal for how packed this place was or plans to be.  For that reason and because it is far from me, I was not interested in coming back although the food was good.  I didn't want to get it to go and have it be cold when I got home.  That being said, I have actually craved it once or twice more since then and may have to venture out there again at some point.",

Whether you've come here to relive your days on the mean streets of NY or you just want to see why people are descending upon this random intersection of Las Vegas at a breakneck pace, I'd venture a guess your first visit won't be your last.   Platter or sandwich, as long as they're putting that tender chicken or beef (or both) in it along with the veggies of your choice (lettuce, tomato, green peppers, jalapenos for the adventurous diners) it's going to be a win. The staff is super nice and does a great job of explaining what you might or might not want on your plate. The hummus is flavorful and the pitas perfectly doughy and warm. You can get their glorious white sauce on your meal or they even provide packets of it which was a wonderful surprise, cause why not hoard them and start putting that sauce on everything you put in your mouth. It's just that good. The hot sauce would likely start a fire if left unattended so heed their warning on overdoing it and ruining your tasty creation.   It's pretty close to the strip if you're in town for debauchery and need a hearty meal but they also deliver and the food travels well. Halal Guys gets my very enthusiastic stamp of approval.",

    "text": "TIL that the white sauce contains mayo, hence why they keep it over ice with an expiration date - which may also explain why it's so tasty and addictive.   After a weekend of excess in Las Vegas, I finally realize why Halal Guys is the perfect anytime food for Vegas. Halal guys is good for:  * A cheap lunch. Less than $10 per plate (before taxes). Compared to my other meals on the strip, this was a steal. A drink at the taco bell cantina sets you back $10.  * An afternoon snack. Plates come in two sizes - small and large. Go small for snack time.  * A quick dinner. No one hour waits here as the food is made pretty and served pretty quickly.  * After a night out. Opened late and just enough protein, carbs, flavor, and a bit of grease to hit the spot (and slow down the absorption of alcohol) without being too greasy. Ask for more rice and less lettuce if you need more carbs.  * After a weekend of excessive eating. Everything is pretty fresh and the bit of lettuce and tomato help to lighten the meal.   I got the combo meal, which is my usual go to at halal carts. The meat was in bigger chunks than I expected, but tasty and not too dry. The rice was flavorful and fluffy. The pita was alright, but I don't usually care for the pita anyway. I did make the mistake of putting on too much red sauce and had to make multiple trips to the soda fountain for more water.   It's not an exact replica in tastes and experience of the original Halal Guys and cart on a street corner in NYC, but I guess that's what happens when you can't port the water and years of flavor built up on the cart across the country. It's close enough and a great addition to the Vegas food scene.",

I'm used to heat, so the mouth feel was fun to deal with. The G. I. feel from ingesting all that heat was not fun, and I only have myself to blame. I actually think I had a headache the next day because of it.   Besides that, it's exactly what their website or any picture will show you. A gyro or a gyro bowl. Unless you have no place to store it, go with the large bowl. It's much better bang for your buck. The regular looks like a small next to the large and it's only a dollar more.  It's good food, but I wouldn't necessarily recommend going out of your way to get it. If you're in the area, stop by and you won't be disappointed.

    "text": "First of all, let me disclaim that I don't usually like to review restaurants if I'm going to criticize them. I'm more of a \"promote what you love\" person rather than \"kill what you hate\".  The reason why I'm giving this Halal Guys such a mediocre score is because I don't want to see the image of this chain suffer because of poor management and training of their new locations. I think it's wonderful to see Halal Guys expand and make their delicious food more accessible to people around the world.   My previous experience with Halal Guys is the original chicken and rice in NY, and the Halal Guys near South Coast Plaza in California.   The Halal Guys near South Coast Plaza is the model child of customer service you should train all your other Halal Guys on. The employees were smiley and friendly, great food.  This Halal Guys is not bad, but not as excellent as the South Coast Plaza one. This one cook who was cleaning the cooking counter or chopping meat, was making these EXTREMELY LOUD BANGING NOISES! I was shouting WHOOOAAAAAAA to signal how monstrously loud it was, but even that was covered up by the crazy loud banging!!!   My boyfriend and I could not longer hear ourselves talk!   There's also no lamb here offered here. There's also a sauce bar and two bottles of white sauce were out of sauce.",

We had our food to go since there was only a few tables and it was full.   The food was mediocre. For me it was too salty. I've had much better Mediterranean food in Vegas. The white sauce was like ranch dressing, but not as creamy. It was good though.   Just a heads up the spicy sauce is spicy HOT!!! My husband and I can eat spicy, but I gave up. My husband ate his entire plate but he said the top of his had was itchy. I don't know what that meant but I know he can eat spicy.   Service was very good, staff was very helpful and friendly.",

I am so sad i spent 10 bucks on this food.. although I'm not hungry, my craving for good food is still there... so..  also be advised seating is almost non existent.. if you have a party with more than 4 people you will have to get it to go.. there was only 12 or so customers and some of them were wating for a spot to open up. if you just have to eat here i suggest you call in an order and get it to go... if you want far superior mediterranean food i would suggest you go to Philly Steak Express on Fort Apache.. they make the food fresh there.. Halal guys make it before hand and it sits... and gets cold... won't be going back.",

We all got the combo plate and both meats were flat, little seasoning and low quality. The white sauce had no flavor and the hot sauce is way too spicy and all of us agreed it just adds no flavor since it is so hot.

Food portions are still disappointing compared to what you get at their NYC foodcart but a bit improved from our last visit. We ordered two regular combo platters, side of hummus, and baklava. They now give you a choice of veggies to add to your platter - black olives, jalepenos, onions that I can recall as I write this. There is also now a frequent diner card you can get. The staff  may want to pay attention to their sauce availability - the white sauce containers were pretty much empty. But the sauces were still spot on ~ white sauce DELICIOUS, and red sauce HOT!",

    "text": "This place was recommended by a friend, as a famous place from New York.   To be honest, I was not only disappointed but suffered hugely from their red sauce.  When I arrived, I noticed a group of four people eating their meal.  I asked them if the food was good. One gentlemen, whose face was reddened by the heat of the red sauce, said. food is good, but do not go near red sauce.   I ordered combo.  I like spicy hot food and chillies,  and have taken such food all my life.  So I decided to try the hot red sauce, which was labelled such.  It did not have a label, extremely hot sauce or some other label indicating the extent of heat of sauce.     Heading to the warning earlier on by their customer,  I took, two small drops of the red sauce on one leaf of lettuce.   Upon intake of the lettuce leaf with two drops of red sauce,  I immediately,  started to choke, started coughing, eyes started to water.     I quickly took some water and food to neutralize this extreme physiologic response to red sauce,  but situation died down only 10%.  I was very uncomfortable throughout the meal,  infact I was coughing for upto 25 minutes after the meal.   THIS RED SAUCE SHOULD BE LABELLED EXTREMELY HOT SAUCE, USE WITH CAUTION.  Please do not  think of it as the standard red sauce one gets in restaurant.   Rest of food.  White sauce - great sauce.  Chicken - not great.  Beef - great.  Service - average. Cleanliness -  average.    This is a small place, seating limited, only four table, with four chairs in each table,  barely any space to move.  Tight space.  Also,  customers could be within a few inches of your table,  while in line for food. I do not like people standing in line, almost touching the table table,  while I am partaking meal.  I am hard pressed to give a rating of two stars and this is because servers are friendly.",

I've been a few times already and everything is consistent considering I usually do the chicken platter or sandwich.  I've had the combination platter as well and it's probably the most common dish I've seen people order and consume.  My only issue is that the food becomes a bit bland after consuming multiple times but you can change it up with toppings including jalapenos, onions and green peppers all chopped up.  The white sauce gives each dish a little more flavor but it reminds me more of a ranch/mayonnaise mixture.  The hot sauce is like fire in a bottle so make sure to just use drops until the right spice level is reached because just a little over your spice threshold and your mouth will be on fire for some time!  I definitely recommend Halal Guys for the fast and consistent food and service and hope their A/C is finally fixed too!",

In New York they load you up so you have a full platter so for it being a little pricy they don't give you much compared to NY.  I ordered 3 combo platters and a gyro platter. I told the ladies 4 times and they still left out one combo. I ordered 2 sides of falafels at the register and the same lady yelled you should of ordered it back here. She had an attitude. Because I am comparing this to our experience in NY and how we kept craving for more I can say I probably won't crave this one which is why I gave them 2 stars.",

But as far as \"authentic\" Middle Eastern shwarma or gyros, this ain't it. No lamb? Seriously? Highly Americanized, bland, non-threatening, mainstream mall food court fare served in a snack bar setting.  And the menu is basically two items: Same stuff in an aluminum take-out container, or same stuff rolled in pita bread. Still a pleasant enough lunch with suburban coworkers who need to get out more, but come on, their \"special sauce\" is mayonnaise-based and somehow has even less flavor than mayonnaise. How is that even possible?",

From what I remember the food was good for its price at the time. When I heard it was coming to Vegas I went on opening day.  Result: The food was not as I had remembered it. Back then it used to be around $5 a plate which made it a bargain. Also, the food is very bland and compared to the other Greek/Mediterranean places at 9 dollars a plate it's not worth it anymore. The sauce is what makes the food but I'd rather not have to lather up my food with that. (considering extra sauce was $1.00 extra)  One big noticeable difference is in NYC you can stand in line for 15-20 minutes but you don't have to worry about parking just finding a sidewalk to sit on. Whereas at this location you have to drive to this spot and here you have to compete with the Asian stores nearby or sit in your car until a space opens up. Therefore, I'd rather drive to a better Greek/Mediterranean place and pay the same amount elsewhere.",

Basically, you have the option of getting  beef gyros or chicken (leg meat) either in a platter (you make a salad out of it-lettuce, tomatoes, rice) or a sandwich. Hummus is offered as a side. But it's pricey. Portions are decent sized though.   As for their vaunted sauces, the red sauce is literally fire (and figuratively too lol), but the \"white sauce\"? I was expecting a decent garlic sauce, or maybe a tzatziki. It's mayo based, which may be great for some folks, but I find the concept disgusting. I went straight with the red.   The hummus gets a solid 3* too. Not too bad, but not memorable either. It's pretty sad when the best hummus in Vegas is probably at Sababa, which is an Israeli place, and their's is maybe 3.5*.   But this is typical dining in local LV. You're in a shopping center with 6 restaurants, the arguably best one got shut down last year for almost 100 health code violations, a decent pho place, and soso Izakaya one, and of course, the de rigeur massage parlor.   If they're going to blow up my Instagram for a month solid before opening, I expect better. Now I do admit to being a snob, and I try to be fair, but this was still a little disappointing.",

White sauce has a strong mayonnaise flavor. Not your normal white sauce, but I can see why people love it. Red sauce is smoking hot. Only a tiny bit needed. The extra pita bread is $1 and smells weird since it sits on top of the meat from the grill. Probably wouldn't order again. You can get ones that aren't on top of the meat as I was told later by the nice lady at the front.   Fries were delicious and made when you place your order so they are very crispy and tasty.   Not sure if I would go back. But it's definitely worth a first try for someone who hasn't been there.",

Also, the pita bread in Manhattan is served hot with a crisp bottom and soft top. Here it is served as narrow, all around doughy wedges. Everything else (aside from the price) is the same.   It's ethnic food, go heavy on the seasoning guys! If you don't need to swish with listerine afterward, you're not doing it right! People love the original for a reason.",

They were giving out free Mini-Bottles of water to make up for the lack of AC I assume.   Also as soon as you arrive, you'll be greeted by an employee telling you to watch out for the hot sauce, you'd be wise to listen to her unless you wanna spend the entire day at the soda fountain! It wasn't too busy so me and my friends got our food pretty quick, we all had the combo platter which comes with Gyro Beef, Chicken, Salad, Tomatoes, Rice, and Pita Bread.  Sauces proved were White sauce, Hell-in-a-bottle sauce, and BBQ sauce which tasted like some cheap generic kraft sauce. As far as the food quality goes, there was nothing really amazing about it, the beef and chicken left something to be desired and I was the poor unfortunate fool that got stuck with the almost stale Pita bread. According to my friends who've been to NYC, the menu is much bigger and they serve lamb as well!   I've definitely had better Mediterranean food and probably won't be returning anytime soon unless my friends peer pressure me into going. Sorry Halal Guys, You may have 3 fans but I'm definitely not one of them!",

It seemed really basic with only a few items to choose from. I ordered a small combo which came with rice, vegetables, chicken and beef. For a dollar more you could get your money's worth for a bigger plate but I wasn't really hungry for that.  There was a few sauces you could put on your plate which be careful, the hot sauce is really hot and i also added the white sauce to blend the hot sauce to make my meal mild.  There was not really that many tables to sit and eat. The workers there was genuinely helpful and it did not take long to get our food.   I wanna mention though there was a lady that was cleaning the table was very friendly and gave great customer service. When we was in line, she gave some recommendations and every time someone left the table she cleaned it up immediately and after we were done eating she asked how our experience was.   Food was okay but the customer service was great.",

At this location they really go light with the rice and I'm afraid to ask for more because it might be an extra cost to the already $10 charge on their combo plate!  All in all, it's a decent spot but they need to step up their game by being generous with the rice and keep the sauce bottles filled. Definitely will come back because of my cravings but they need to change something..  EDIT: I came here again to give it another shot and may I say I am impressed. There's finally working AC, the employees are more energetic and helpful, and the finally fixed the portion sizes. I disregard my last statement but applause goes out the management for taking the reviews on Yelp and adjusting to the customers! Definitely will be back soon!!",

This also came with a side of the white sauce and some hot sauce.   First off, that hot sauce is no joke. I was expecting something along the lines of a Taco Bell or del Taco level hot sauce.... nope.... it had some serious kick! Like nose running, need a drink after type heat. It was really good though. Not one of those sauces that's heat and no taste. I want a jar of it.  The platter itself was pretty good. The rice was way over cooked, but that also could have been from being in the container for 30min while being delivered. The white sauce helps to moisten up everything.  Overall, it's almost like a taco salad. Not what I expected, but I'll definitely eat it again!",

    "text": "If you've never had Halal Guys in New York City, then this place is just alright, mediocre at best. If you've had it in NYC, don't even try it. I'm not trying to be mean or harsh. It's the simple truth. Before it opened here, I craved street halal ALWAYS. Now that I've had Vegas' version (and yes I am local), I don't crave it ever because I rather just not have it until I can get it right from the big apple.   I want to say it has to do with the preparation. When you order from the street carts, they throw it on their grill and you get your food nice and hot. Here, the meat is in warmers as if you're at Chiptole. It's simply not the same. The flavor is not the same. And if you're expecting your food to be drenched in the sauce as it is in NYC, it won't be.  Don't get me wrong though-- it's still better than other fast food places. It's just not up to par with the expectations the original street halal carts caused me to have. So I don't know if it's their fault or this branch's fault, but I wish it could be better. Super anticlimactic when I was so excited to finally go try it after it opened in Vegas. Darn.",

Highly recommend the white sauce; would skip the hot sauce, as the flavor stay in your mouth for a long time! The hummus is good- portion big enough to share with at least 2-3 people. I recommend ordering extra pita with the hummus, as they only give one piece. $8.99 for small, $9.99 for large. Sandwiches is also an option. Hummus $4.99. Bottled water expensive $2.49. Good food!

The vegas franchise, of course, it's the original 53rd & 6th--but it will do for someone who lives in Vegas, and to not be ungrateful for having it in town. Combo is the only way to go for me even back in New York, even late at night or after club hours! Beware of the red sauce, you are now warned. It will generate a love-hate relationship with your food, but it is so goddamn good with the white sauce that they have.  Altogether, I know I will be back. They are not stingy with their white sauce at all, they give you 2 packets (unlike the one in California) and they have table-extras if you decide to eat in house.  I'm sure there are other places to get your halal fix, but trust me--this is different.",

Without the white sauce the meat would probably be a bit on the dry side.  Rice was tasty and so was the pita bread. Very unique flavor.   Knocking a star off because of the seating arrangement. The restaurant has a handful of tables and a few stools. They had staff directing patrons on where to sit so it wasn't too hectic but I can see this being a problem during really busy times.   Staff was very friendly and seemed attentive.   As far as portions go , they're huge ! The normal platter is very filling with lots of meat. Definitely a good bang for your buck.   Overall ,  the food was delicious. Glad to have these guys in Vegas. In the words of Arnold , 'I'll be back \".",

We decided to give this place another go at it since we needed a quick grab and go heading to the airport. The assistant manager was who filled my order and I must say she gave exceptional service and this added to my great experience for sure.   I ordered the combo platters and then off to meet my husband where we both were surprisingly enjoying our meal 30 minutes later.

Always happy to see a freebies upon Yelp check in! Today we each got a baklava.  The wife and I ordered a platter and a sandwich so we could share. She ordered the combo platter with chicken and gyro. It came with rice, lettuce, pita bread, and your choice of a number of items including, onions, peppers, tomato, jalapenos, olives and a white tahini sauce. Very filling plate and delicious 4/5. I had the chicken sandwich which is loaded with as much chicken as they can fit in the bread, topped off with peppers, jalapenos, kalamata olives and white sauce. Huge, messy and delicious to the last bite! 4/5. We tried the other sauces available next to the drink tower: hot sauce FIRE in a bottle (sriracha got nothing on this sauce) and the bbq sauce. Good variety and worth trying each or a mixture.   For dessert we enjoyed the baklava which hit he spot and attempted to put the fire out from that hot sauce. Two sprite refills and a baklava later, lips still tingled. Overall a nice quick meal with the wife.",

Taking a star away for cleanliness and somewhat unprofessional employees ( there kids what do you expect I guess) but as far a value, taste and quality not bad for a Mediterranean spot , definitely will be back the red and white sauces are pretty tasty combo.",

Along with the question - \"is it halal?\" In spite of the lack of lamb, the gyros at Halal Guys is fresh, tasty and huge.  The abundance of white sauce is the reason to dine on location.  I've noticed the number of take-out orders going out the door doing my visits, a sign that this must be a place to be. The food staff is extremely friendly and cheerful. Too bad they aren't allowed tips. I think that I'm going to make them all some cookies for the holidays.  The Women's bathroom is clean and spacious.  Enough room for my dog's stroller and my wide end. The dining area is another issue, obviously most people don't know how to eat gyros. Especially,  the crowd that comes in from the competition,  they are slobs. I hope no one else is in the store when they come in, it's a nasty scene.  No shade on Halal Guys or staff.",

When we got in we should have known, all the food was covered and hidden and the shawarma was already cut, not on the gyro pole, and covered with pita all over.   My friend took food before me, and since I ordered falafel I had to wait for five more minutes, it makes sense, and I would gladly wait for fresh food but it wasn't at all fresh! He took it out of a plastic wrap.   The HIGHLIGHT was when I asked if the \"white sauce\" is tahini and been answered that they don't have it - only mayo! The guy preparing my food wanted to give me hummus instead (we already paid by this point) and the cashier started arguing with him he has to charge me extra... 4 falafels were already 10 dollars which is way to much! She started arguing with me that they're not suppose to give any sauce. By that point I was so mad I told them falafel comes with either hummus or tahini everywhere else. I told them it's ridiculous that they have no alternative to mayo. Even extra mayo costs extra there!  They started talking and 4 people came from the back looking confused. All that drama for a spoon of hummus.   After a minute of them not realizing the customer is always right I asked a full refund, my friend got up gave them the food back and we got out.  I've never been to a situation like this before.  So foolish to not satisfy the customer with this one gesture after they already did an awful job with everything else.  The place was empty and they couldn't get one customer happy. Ridiculous.",

Also, the line moves quick!  2. Yes, the food is as good as their other locations 3. Parking in Chinatown is NEVER an issue. The further you park = the more places you get to stop and eat/boba/dessert before you get to your final destination. There will probably not be any spaces in their lot, but there are plenty of lots nearby so who cares! 4. YESSSSSS, the food is as good as their other locations. DON'T WORRY. 5. Watch out for that red sauce!  Let me bring to your attention that The Halal Guys is open until FOUR AM. I have no upcoming plans to go out clubbing, but this makes me want to go out just so I can experience Halal Guys the right way- a night of drinking followed by WHITE SAUCE.  Stick with the famous combo platter if you don't know what to get. It lets you try both meats so that you'll know next time (Yes. There will be a next time.) which meat you prefer. I'm sure you don't need the reminder, but watch out for the red sauce it's HOT.  The restaurant is small, don't expect to be able to sit inside to eat. Take it to go. Eat it in the car. Eat it in your pajamas on the couch binge watching that new show you started. Just make sure you buy two platters- the portions are HUGE, but you won't regret having an extra platter for the next day :)",

    "text": "Sorry guys - no bueno. The Halal Guys cart in NYC is an occasional guilty pleasure for me when I'm over there, but the new Las Vegas location just does not do the name any justice.  $9.99 for a \"large\" combo plate that doesn't even fill the container, was mostly lettuce anyway (literally more lettuce than rice), with meat that was lukewarm (and technically probably not even room temperature as the A/C in the place isn't even working - it's 100+ out today, for goodness' sakes), and the pita was cold and hard. No wonder there is literally no line. (Well, at least I didn't have to wait to be disappointed.)  I don't expect a carbon copy of the greatness of their NYC cart, but they will have to get a LOT closer to what's at 53rd and 6th to get me to come back.",

I came here because I always see it all over my instagram, I wanted to see what the hype was about. The service was good and prices are decent, but it just wasn't my taste. The three friends I brought with me weren't impressed either. Maybe this just wasn't our food group but I just didn't find much flavor in anything I ate. It just tasted like I was eating a chicken and beef stir fry with some pita bread slices. It wasn't bad, it just didn't live up to the hype around it.",

    "text": "You either love it, or you feel, just \"eh\" about The Halal Guys. It's not like it's hit or miss, because it's pretty much the same, every time. There are minimal options, and you most likely know what you are going to order before you arrive. I personally love the combo platter, which is grilled chicken, beef, lettuce, tomatoes, rice, and pita bread. I add two white sauce packets and one hot sauce packet. YES, the hot sauce IS HOT. BUT, if you like spicy, and you mix it all together, it compliments the meat and white sauce perfectly and leaves just the right amount of linger on your tongue. I love it! You can also order falafel if you don't do meat. Or a Gyro sandwich on fresh pita.  The location is a decent size with about 4 tables. But it's really meant to be just like NY, grab and go. See a long line, don't stress, it moves SO FAST!   I had The Halal Guys off a truck in NY, and to me, it taste the exact same! I have read some reviews about it being different but I did not notice. This place has been open less than a month and I have already been here 4 times! My kid likes it, my boyfriend likes it, and even when I brought my best friend a plate, she killed it.  Sure, it's basic. But to me, it hits the spot every time. Good, fresh food, nice people, good prices. The crack sauce, I mean white sauce that is so DAM addicting. If you haven't stepped out of your pizza and burger comfort zone lately, take a leap and do it here!",

    "text": "I am an avid Halal Guys fan! I used to frequent the street cart in NYC when I lived there - it easily became one of those meals that I craved weekly!   I just had my first meal combo plate at this location and it did not disappoint. Before posting this, i saw a review from someone complaining about the food being cooked ahead of time and it sitting until it's served - clearly that person doesn't get out much. You ever been to a chipotle? It's the same concept. And, with how busy their locations are, the food won't have much of a chance to sit for long - those lines won't stop! It's sad that someone like that rated them so negatively at the beginning.   Back to the food; be careful with the red sauce! If you haven't had it before, taste a little bit on your finger before adding it to your dish - you'll thank me later! The white sauce is where it's at. It's like ranch and tzatziki made a love-child. The lettuce and tomato help cool the heat from the red inferno!   The location is small, but coming from a cart on the street where you had to eat your meal standing up in 5 degree weather in the snow and wind...I think this is a huge step up! I love that feeling of standing and eating my meal at their locations. It's just one of their \"things.\" If you're going to complain that you don't have a seat to put your butt, bring a fold-up chair in your car (or eat in your car) and save the complaint.   The A/C wasn't working, but they haven't really opened yet. These types of things are expected. They had fans and cooling units inside to help - we appreciated that. The owners were great! Very nice guys! They even gave us (2) free entrees for a future visit. The staff were all very friendly and I saw lots of smiles (not something I'm used to at the street cart lol)!  Eating here is an experience & you should look at it like that! You will likely have a challenge finding parking. You may wait in line when the weather is not so great. If you come here with those expectations, you'll enjoy your meal even more (especially late night after some cocktails)! Well done, Halal Guys!",

    "text": "With all the craze of the opening of The Halal Guys, I was adamant about coming here to grab a bite to eat after falling in love with the locations in both New York and southern California.  Located in the same lot as Krung Siam, Izakaya Go, and Starbucks, finding parking during the lot's busier hours can pose quite a challenge. There are not many parking spaces available and the lot itself is quite small.  Walking in, the restaurant is very small with not very many seating. The line moves quick. With the menu in giant print and letters above where you place your order, you could choose from the many items they sell. From the looks of it, they provide the same choices as the other locations I have visited. You order first, get to watch it get made, and then pay at the end.  I had ordered the combo platter. There are two sizes only about a dollar apart. However, the smaller size was more than enough for myself to finish. It comes with a salad, pita bread, rice, beef, and chicken. Portion control is something to work on. Also, I noticed that the salad dominated the platter in this location. Though I appreciate them for helping me eat healthier, I don't think I would pay almost $10 for soggy lettuce and mushy tomatoes.   As everyone says, don't forget to load up on the white sauce! You can't have too much. However, be careful of the red sauce as it is HOT. A little goes a long way. However, even with the sauces piled onto the entire platter, the meats were dry and the rice was hard (borderline stale). Thinking this was just from the bottom of the barrel the first time I had visited, I returned again about a week later to give this place another shot. Sadly, it was just as dry.  Service needs a lot of work. The first time I had gone, there was a lot of confusion over my order. I did not think it took 5 people to ask me what I had to order. The next time I visited, I had witnessed one of the female workers yelling at the customer in front of me. As someone who has worked multiple hospitality jobs, that is no way to treat a customer. Especially one that had asked no more than one question beforehand. I was appalled. However, a couple workers with beaming personalities and smiles were their saving grace. Though I understand this joint is new and is still working itself, customer service should not be lacking as much as it did.  As someone who fell in love with The Halal Guys in New York, I was deeply disappointed in this location. Hopefully with more tweaks and as time goes by, I will be updating my review and raving about how awesome this place is. But for right now, I think I will just wait until my next trip to either coasts to visit the Halal Guys. Though this is Sin City, I will not be sinning with this Halal Guys anytime soon.",

Oh and let me not steer you wrong the chicken isn't the same. The point is beggars can't be chooser though guys... Drum roll it's a must try especially if you've never been!!   Don't eat it without the white sauce. Don't knock it until you try it. Get it to go the seating is limited. Don't skip out on the hot sauce I mean it's really hot but worth it.

    "text": "It truly pains me to write this review as I was so incredibly excited for this place to open. I went to NYC for the first time last year and ate at some of the Halal carts there and their gyros were unlike any gyro I've ever had. I never visited THE Halal Guys and had heard they were the best of the best. When I heard they were opening a location here I freaked out, I couldn't wait!  We went last night around 9 pm, it wasn't that busy. I mean it was full and there was a line but I was expecting it to be outside wrapped around the building. In all it only took about five minutes from the time we walked in until we left with our order.  I ordered the chicken and gyro combo plate with the white and red sauces on the side. I tasted the white sauce before I put it on my food thankfully because it's revolting. I assumed it would be like a tzatziki but it was basically liquid mayo. I ended up adding half the packet of the red sauce which gave it a nice heat. Unfortunately the hot sauce was the only great thing about this meal.  The gyro meat was more like ground lamb than sliced gyro meat like how I had it in New York, and the meat itself was very tasteless. The chicken was ok, it wasn't dry, but again it was lacking in flavor. The rice was extremely bland as well, all the food pretty much tasted like red sauce and had no flavor of its own.  It wasn't a terrible meal it was just extremely underwhelming and disappointment. The Halal Guys came very hyped by everyone and unfortunately the dish did not come close to delivering. If I'm ever drunk in China town maybe I'll stop by again, but there are way better gyros elsewhere in Vegas to scratch that itch.",

    "text": "Okay. First of all.. If you come here expecting legit, bougie, gourmet Middle Eastern food, save your drive, money, and your Yelp Review. It is not warranted in that capacity because this food is for the DRUNK and the HURRIED.  For context- I have eaten from the Halal Guys cart in NYC numerous times and no experience has been before 9 pm prior to my lunch visit here on a Saturday. This chain started off as a hotdog turned chicken/rice platter cart for Manhattanittes to grab a bite of lunch on the go. It also evolved into late night drunk food for club patrons-- being open until early morning.   If you've heard of how amazing this place is through the grape vine and leave your experience disappointed, I don't blame you. This place has been hyped up the wrong way. I recommend visiting New York and going to this cart so you can see how it fits into the NYC lifestyle and isn't quite the same as in Vegas.. or even LA... etc.  Anyway-- surprisingly there was no line when we arrived. Seating is sparse but patrons are respectful and will not dawdle in conversation when they are finished eating so to allow for those who are waiting to sit and eat. (Note: If you see this review please heed advice and be respectful of seating.) Order to go if you're in a hurry. Unfortunately, unlike in New York, you can't really sit on the curb/sidewalk wall and eat this.     Presentation is the same as the NY cart-- aluminum to go container with a plastic cover which includes meat (chicken, gyro, or both), yellow rice, iceberg lettuce, and slices of pita bread. If you're from New York (as my husband is) and craving this.. it satisfies. It's not as greasy and you don't feel as accomplished after eating it but the size (regular) is hearty enough for a second meal. Douse it in \"crack sauce\" but go easy easy easy on the hot sauce. Seriously though.. it is what is it. If you're not stuck up about your food then you'll appreciate it.   Service is very good. Someone is constantly wiping tables, taking out the trash, and refilling condiments. They also greet you nicely and thank you when you leave.   Like I've said.. so many popular eateries are opening up here in Vegas which is nice. I'll definitely come back when we are craving chicken and rice.. perhaps at 3am after hitting the strip or even for lunch on a week day.",

I've heard that it was delicious and simple and it was! I got a regular for 10.99 before tax, and it's extremely filling. I could probably portion it to 2 meals.  Anyways, when my friends and I arrived, they told us it would be a 5-7 minute wait for chicken, which was fine because it would mean we would get chicken fresh from the grill!  It was nice that the manager gave us free soda cups because we were waiting.  The bowl was loaded with meat, I saw the worker give each of our bowl at least 1 and a 1/2 scoops of both chicken and beef gyro. They had all the sauces on the side near the soda fountain.  Their white sauce is as good as people say and the red sauce is as spicy as people say. Both together is a great combo, but go light on the red just to give a nice spicy kick. I noticed that the bottles have a printed label that shows when it was made and when the store should toss it. It shows that they always change the sauce bottles.  All in all, it's a nice simple meal that will fill you up. Nothing amazing to keep me craving it, but I can see why people enjoy it with its simple fresh flavors and housemade sauces!",

The rice and chicken tastes bland. Yes, I poured the white sauce and hot sauce (which is really spicy, btw) and nothing really helped. Also, the white sauce tasted more like ranch sauce with a million calories. The hummus was also nothing special. I've made better tasting hummus in the kitchen. My friend like the baklava. And the crinkled fries were literally the best tasting thing there because it was made to order and salted.   CUSTOMER SERVICE: The employees were nice and helpful.   Overall, I would not come back here until they learn to season their food correctly.",

    "text": "So I heard for a while this crazy awesome place The Halal guys was opening here in Vegas so I was interested, hearing so much about it over the years but never have been to New York to try it was finally  my chance to try when they opened here in Vegas yesterday. I wasn't even going to go on opening day having my son with me and all but I just so happened to have to go the that area of town so I decided to stop by and see how crazy the line was. The line wasn't bad at all and was shaded so I didn't mind. I guess the swag was gone coming 3 hours from opening at 1 pm but they had cases of ice cold water to cool you down in the heat. One of the promoters who was working the event even helped me with getting a room temperature water to make my son a bottle who later also helped me inside! Once we got inside it was another line but was pretty quick and they had tons of meat cooking and staff ready to serve up the large crowds. The line was wrapped around the tent once I got in so I was lucky to beat the crowd again.   I chose the combo gyro platter to try both meats. Seating is limited and was taken anyways to I took it to go. Each order serves you two packets of the famous white sauce and one small but mighty hot sauce. I had cold water in my bag so I skipped the soft drink and didn't plan to stay and eat because tables and chairs were taken like I said but by the time I paid a table opened up for me and my son so we were able to sit down and enjoy our lunch instead of in the car which gave me a chance to feed my son to get a seal of approval.   The rice didn't have too much flavor but was tender and soft. Of the beef and chicken, the beef was my favorite of the two but the chicken was very tender. Smother it in the white sauce and you're in heaven but be very careful of the hot sauce. I like spicy but it was super hot and I put a small amount on the side and tried before I poured all over my food. I'm so glad I did because man that sauce is no joke! Luckily I put some chicken aside for my son along with pita bread which he loved. Luckily one of the girls who opened the store asked me how I was doing (same one who helped me outside and helped me bring the high chair to the table) and I said I wasn't expecting the hot sauce to be so hot and had wished I ordered a drink but the line was just so Long and I didn't want to be rude and cut and she gave me her lemonade. As a mom with a child you appreciate the small things especially not making me wait in line again for a drink because when you have children everything is a tad more complicated. I don't know your name but if you're reading this I appreciate you helping me more than you know from helping me outside and helping me sit and bringing me a high chair in the midst of craziness and the busy store I appreciate more than you know!   Staff was super nice and kept a great attitude through the busy chaos all day. Seating and parking is limited so I would recommend taking it to go or stay if you're lucky enough to score a table or barstool!  I heard a few people say on social that the beef was too minced and the original New York stand is way better but I can't compare as I've never tried. When the OG Halal guys is halfway across the country beggars can't be choosers and I'm sure this will satisfy your craving. They're open late and I'm sure will be a hip spot for all the party people as it's close to the strip but I'm sure they would've done great anywhere. Welcome to Vegas Halal guys!",

    "text": "I'm a long-time vegetarian & love falafel sandwiches, which I've had dozens of times from restaurants around the country.  In the area already, I stopped by around 4:30PM on their grand opening day.     They're located in a small strip-mall, and I was lucky to find a parking spot quickly -- I think after some of the \"buzz\" about this place ends, parking should be a problem, other than the lot being kind of narrow.  As expected for their opening day, the place was pretty busy, but thanks to their rather limited menu, I was in & out of there in about 10 minutes.   All the staff was very friendly, and I expect by now, they're probably better at knowing what's what.  I ordered two falafels, one with \"white sauce\" & the other with their hot sauce.   They were cautioning everyone that the hot sauce really is hot, and I'm very glad they suggested that they just give me a packet of it instead of them putting it on my second falafel!    The falafel sandwich consists of 3 or 4 meatball-sized falafels on a bed of chopped lettuce & diced tomatoes, wrapped up taco-like by pita bread, and then with a small drizzle of whatever sauce you want (packets of extra sauce are 99 cents).  Not liking tomatoes, I got mine without.  The price for two was $17 something.  No drink or anything else is included.   It's not a scenic location, no ambience or anything else special inside the place, so maybe I'm just an old, cheap-bastard, but I find the pricing to be very high.   Remember, it's a falafel -- mostly ground chick-peas & lettuce (in fact. I think they put a little too much lettuce in, as a cheap 'filler' for the sandwich.  The pricing might be normal for NYC & would be for the LV Strip, but not the location that they are at.  Falafels have very little flavor.  Most places season them with paprika, garlic, onions or something, but this place doesn't.     Most of the other places I've gotten falafels at have onions that they add with the lettuce & tomato -- obviously, onions add a lot to the flavor.   This place doesn't, and seemed not to have onions at all.   The white sauce that came in my one falafel sandwich was just a very light drizzle, probably the equivalent of half a teaspoon-full.  Not enough, especially when the \"white sauce\" doesn't really have a lot of flavor to it...  Thankfully, as part of their grand opening, they have me two packets of the white sauce, and one of the hot sauce.    To give the falafel any sort of flavor, I used a whole packet of the white sauce, and it's just dumb that the white sauce packet is a 99 cent option, when the reality is it's a requirement to give the sandwich even a modicum of flavor.  Sadly, even then, the falafel sandwich from The Halal Guys was just OK.  Part of the reason it was even OK was simply because I hadn't had a falafel sandwich in a while.  Later on, I opened the hot sauce packet.  Many of us foodies are accustomed to sauces described as \"hot\" or \"spicy\" really being neither, but not only is the hot sauce here truly very hot, but it's also somewhat of a different flavor to it.  I'm glad I sampled the hot sauce via a drop in my finger instead of pouring it on my second falafel sandwich, because I don't really like the flavor (yeah, I know, but at least I'm being consistent...) & even if I did, it would have been a little too hot to eat when you've got to go back to work for a couple hours...  So the bottom-line for me is that due to lack of flavor, and also a lack of value for the price, I doubt I'll be back unless I have a falafel sandwich craving late at night -- it is AWESOME this place is apparently open until 4AM!!!   Hopefully that will last.  For the owner: I doubt you'll lower your pricing, so after the initial buzz dies, if the profits aren't matching your business plan, please think about including a small drink or bag of chips to bring better value to at least the falafel sandwiches!    Also how about more vegetable options (onions), to give some actual flavor to the falafel sandwiches.  Your lamb dishes might taste great & be a good value, but the falafels don't & aren't.    I'm not happy to write such a review -- I was really hoping to find a great new falafel place that's open late, but for the aforementioned reasons, you currently aren't it for me.",

    "text": "After being tortured with pics for months, I was so excited to finally get to try The Halal Guys. I went on opening day, around 3 pm, hoping to beat the crowds. I lucked out! Found a parking spot easily, and only had about a 5 minute wait before getting to go inside and place my order. While waiting outside, employees passed out bottles of water and gave us copies of the menu, which was nice.   I ordered a beef gyro sandwich, 2 falafel on the side, 2 combination platters, and 2 pieces of baklava.   The gyro was very good- both the pita and the meat had a good texture, in fact the pita was pretty much perfect. I wish I had known I could have gotten toppings on the gyro like jalapenos and olives, but it was their first day being open to the public, and that didn't negate my experience.  The platters I took home for dinner. I made the rookie mistake of getting the large size, so much food! The rice was great, that white sauce lives up to the hype, the red sauce was too much for me. We liked the chicken, the beef, and the falafel, though my husband thought the falafel was a little dry. On the flip side, he loved the baklava and I thought it was a little dry....just a matter of preferences.   This is a bit of a drive for us, but we agreed we would both return here for weekend lunch, or a quick dinner.",

They are not reluctant to pile on the food, but overall it was rather bland. They lost a star for the quality and flavor of the beef bowl. The rice was average. The white sauce was nothing yo rave about.   The second time I went, I tried the Gyros. Again, the meat was bland. They put their white sauce on it instead of Tatziki sauce. That is not acceptable. They piled on the lettuce, very little tomato , onion, or cucumber. They lost a star for a second poor dish.   Finally, the restaurant itself has very limited seating, the sauces are left out, exposed, and the tables are dirty. They lost s star for that.   I will not be going back nor will I recommend it to anyone else. The food is just not quality.",

Food 5/5: Is middle eastern and simply delicious. I went with the combo platter for $9.99 which included rice, salad and a choice of meat topped with their infamous \"white sauce\"! I topped my platter with chicken and it was cooked well. We also tried the chicken sandwich for $8.99 which is what halal guys is known for and it was delicious! The only thing I thought could be improved is the pricing of the side of hummus for $4.99 it is pretty much half price of a dish. Granted you get a ton of hummus but only two pitas. Easy to finish the pitas first and still have half of the hummus left. Otherwise, food is good regardless!   Service was on point and the restaurant was very clean. They left a great first impression!!  Tip: check in on yelp and receive a free baklava dessert. Also for my Vegas locals if you show proof of residency you get a discount.",

    "text": "This is will be the first time for me to write a review for a business that I haven't set foot in, but I have been ordered delivery every few months ever since they opened through Uberats or Prime.   After trying a plate from the original cart in NYC by 53th and 6th, I was a huge fan! What is it that makes the plate so good? The white sauce and deadly hot sauce! The combo of these two? Addicting! That's why I was sooo excited that they came to west coast. First in Costa Mesa, then in Vegas. I tried them both but it's not the same as nyc street flavors for some reasons. It's still not bad though.   I usually order the chicken plate. The beef seems very oily, and the flavor is just okay. In NYC, besides white sauce and hot sauce, they also have bbq sauce. It's yummy to add all three sauces and mix them all.  I recently ordered like two weeks ago. I was never a fan of the pita bread that came of the plates here, it seemed like it was even getting smaller too.   Here's the summary:   Chicken plate (4/5): I order this every time! It has been consistent since they opened. However, the pita bread has been getting smaller and thinner.   Spicy hummus (4/5): a bit pricy for the hummus. Maybe it's because of Uber eats. I think they use the same hot sauce because it's soooo spicy. If you can't take your spice, I suggest you skip this.   Combo plate (3/5): not a fan of the chewy oily beef. It just doesn't taste right to me.   It's a place I will continue Uber eat for lunch. Tip: order extra white sauce to mix your salad or dip your rotisserie chicken. White sauce is <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fthebomb.com&s=355187a2a784c6ee933e2e46feb84e4a2bbc84cde0736652fb6961a6a23327f7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">thebomb.com</a>.",

    "text": "Think of Halal Guys as the halal/kosher version of Chipotle. That would be the first impression of people who have eaten at Chipotle but never experienced the original Halal Guys food carts in midtown Manhattan.  Now let me set the stage. I am an old hand as a loyal customer of the original concept especially on the corner of seventh avenue and 53rd street in Manhattan. I have enjoyed the savory flavors there many a time, mostly holding a plateful of rice and chicken while seated on the steps of a nearby building.  So now to the Las Vegas experience.  It was disappointing in a number of ways: indifferent service, communication issues and a definitively lower quality of food.  So if you are looking for excellent middle eastern chow and are in Manhattan, go for it at the foodcart. However, do not expect the same experience in Vegas at the bricks and mortar locations.",

But I was craving gyro and that tastes fine here even they don't have lamb.  Stars for the staff, so friendly! David went out of his way to serve me!! Perfect service!! I'm happy with the free baklava piece with check in.  Tables were pretty dirty, but David wiped them down. Great experience because the service, food is average, but the gyro is good and that's what I came for.

My initial impression was meh... it was nice to try but for whatever reason, I felt like something was really lacking.. It wasn't the flavor because they have a variety of sauces you can choose from. Let me stop there.. The meat on a few occasion just seems dried out or like it's not what it should be.   My most recent visit, I experienced something similar to the times before. Just like baseball, three strikes and you are OUT. I have accepted the fact that I am just not a fan and that's okay. What I AM a fan of is the free baklava when you check in on YELP... Other than that I wouldn't break my neck trying to make my way back here. Especially because the customer service has always been consistently spotty :-/ It's unfortunate though because I am in the area a lot and would've been a nice regular spot however, it's located at the end of Chinatown so there are PLENTY of other options.",

He has a great work ethic and deserves recognition for sure.",

We covered our dish in the \"white sauce\".  Don't know what's quite in it other than yumminess.   The meat and chicken was seasoned perfectly.  Salt and pepper. That's all it needed.  The white sauce, tasted like a mix of ranch and mayo maybe (?) matched amazingly with the meat, rice and salad.  That sauce would taste good on anything...lol..  We ordered the regular size, which was a perfect sharing size for my husband and I at 11:30pm.  Service was fast and friendly.  Would visit this place again.",

They have 2 big tv screens for the menu but its only like 5 items to choose which was a little disappointing. Our server was nice but the ordering process was a little odd. My wife ordered her chicken sandwich (gyro/pita), she wanted a lamb meat gyro but he said that's only seasonal. He made her sandwich, then asked what I wanted I ordered a spicy BBQ which I saw a small sign for it. I also ordered fries so he hands us the sandwiches and tell me its a 3 minute wait. Normally you would ask the customer if they want fries before making the meal so the sandwich is not cold but the food was still hot and the fries were very crispy (2 thumbs up). The chicken sandwich was really good the only reason for my rating was because the place is too nice just for like 5 items: Chicken sandwich, beef gyro, Falafel, 2 different platters meals and a small cake. This is from an original stand that was/is in New York so I get that aspect but still a bit disappointing.",

But the worst part was the after effects, which I felt around six hours later. Simply an awful meal and very overpriced for such low quality ingredients. I'd rather just buy some of their white sauce and put it over some meat at home.",

Extra white sauce and pita bread are also recommended!!   So the staff is the sweetest. They warn about the heat of the hot sauce and answered any questions we had. Also when we had some leftover (I know how did that happen) they have us a sauce cup cause you know it's all about that sauce.",

I got the combo and it was stuffed with so much, I barely got to finish it. The meat is very nicely flavored and the rice balanced it well. The naan bread is a little stale but still good. The white sauce made the whole plate though and when they said you can't have enough of it, they really mean that. You can load up the platter with so little or so much white sauce and it's still delicious. The red sauce though is very potent, just a little dab and it does it's job. For the Yelpers, make sure you check in and get that free baklava; you can never have too much baklava",

I don't know how you can screw any or all of that up. Literally the only redeeming thing there was the white sauce and the spicy red sauce. Too bad that copious amounts of both couldn't mask the unacceptable level of quality of everything else. I think one of two things is happening here, 1) the Halal vendor carts in NY actually serve better food, or 2) food generally tastes better when you're tired and hungry from walking the streets all day or you've been out late, you're starving and it's the only thing you can find. Neither of which is the case if you drive over and hit this place for lunch in Vegas. The good news is - Parsley sells similar food that is high quality and delicious only 5 minutes away. The staff was friendly, if that counts for anything...",

Talk about no seating, dry meat, frozen falafel, and the platters don't come with hummus (which is what you would expect in a Mediterranian platter). Also, if you don't like soda, bring your own drink...no iced tea. The hot sauce should have a disclaimer on it because it's blow-your-butthole-out hot. Overall, the quality doesn't match up to the price. I don't think I'll be returning.",

Walking in I immediately noticed the decor, while it is not the prettiest decor it is also not the best looking decor it was mediocre, but that's not what I was there for. I got in line and was already ordering as there wasn't much of line. Will say for a regular combo platter, the amount of food was astonishing. I tried it right away and honestly be careful of the hot sauce other than that everything else was good. With good customer service and good enough food I can see myself coming back every now and again!",

    "text": "I've heard a lot of hype about halal guys from east coast friends. I was really excited to hear that they now had one within driving distance to phoenix, az. After making a drive to Las Vegas for the weekend, we decided to save the best for last. On our drive back, we stopped at halal guys. For a place that has chicken and rice as their signature dish, I was appalled that they were out of rice when I got there. Even more, there was a \"40-45 min\" wait on the rice. How you don't start preparing rice ahead of time as you are getting low is beyond me. Deciding not to wait, we ended up settling on the sandwiches. The chicken was bland and the only saving grace was smothering sauce on it to add some flavor. Needless to say, the hype was not well deserved. Personally, I think that any restaurant establishment can make up for mediocre food by having good customer service. I wish I was able to say that about this halal guys. The place had 4 people behind the counter, but a single person was taking the order, making the sandwich, putting the condiments and accepting the payment. Most inefficient use of manpower I have seen. If the management doesn't take some serious steps to properly train its staff, I can't imagine this place will continue to be very successful just by relying on the popularity of the brand.",

The pita was soaking wet and fell apart. It was worse than McDonald. I only went there because all the other restaurants were closed. My advice, look for 7eleven and buy a cold cut sandwich over this.",

When he told me that there was no onion I said ok I need to wash my hands I'll be back. I thought that they needed to cut some onion but when I got the food there was no onion. Sauce in packets are basically poison, it has soy, high in sodium and other chemicals which I assume their entire menu does.

I gave a 4 because though the food is awesome, I think it's missing that food truck authenticity (since its now its a store front lol)and I didn't get as much white sauce as I expected...it might be because I asked my brother to get it for it me  but good luck guys, tell your Jamaica Ave truck keep up the good work I'll be coming back!!!",

Yes, the ghost pepper sauce will give you heat, but the beef and chicken isn't flavorful to begin with.

This loose beef doesn't cut it, and the white sauce adds nothing but moisture (which is good, as everything is desert dry) but again not much taste. Sorry, Guys, wanted to love you.",

I was introduced to halal guys just from watching videos on it and a close friend who lives in NY telling me it is cheap and the lamb is a must have. Tried it on the grand opening for the first ever and it was pricy. $10 for a platter when at the cart I saw it was ranging $7-$8 plus I got charged to have sauce when i wanted to stay and eat. Total bill was about $12 a platter At the moment I was pretty astonished on why it costed so much. Overall the food was dry. The sauce was really good and was the only thing that kept the whole platter alive. The meat was pretty bland too. I was pretty disappointed for my first experience but I thought it just because of the grand opening. I went again 2 days after the grand opening to see if any thing had changed. The combo plate was a little bit better than it was the first day. Rice was dry and the meat was decent. Probably my last time coming to halal guys honestly. Not worth the price honestly",

We walked in and were greeted by very friendly staff. Because it was our first time.. The staff were extremely helpful with their recommendations especially warning us that their hot sauce is really hot. We had to get our food to go because the restaurant was extremely small and there were no available tables open. As for the food.. We were not too impressed with it. The small bowl I ordered came with chicken, rice, lettuce, tomatoes, and 4 pieces of pita bread. The chicken was dry and had no flavor. The white sauce helped with the dryness but it was just ok. The pita bread was thin and soggy. I love Mediterranean food so it was extremely disappointing after hearing the hype about this place. I probably won't be coming back again. There are much better Mediterranean restaurants in LV.  I gave this place three stars only for the friendly staff.",

I ordered a small falafel plate. It took 4 minutes to come out and they brought it to my table. It came with four falafel pieces on a bed of rice pilaf, a side of iceberg lettuce and chopped tomatoes with quarters of pita.  The falafel was burnt and when I tried to pierce a piece with my plastic fork, it nearly broke. The rice was bland. The lettuce and tomato was sad because I could tell the lettuce was old. The pita was hard and chewy and the hummus was too acidic. As for the sauces, their famous white sauce was basically mayo and their tahini was tasteless. It was actually all pretty tasteless. And for the price? It's an awful value for a mediocre meal.   Overall, I would not recommend this place. The food isn't completely inedible, but for the price and quality, you're better off going somewhere else. Almost anywhere else.  Side notes, they don't offer tzatziki sauce and we overhead an employee pronounce gyro as \"jie-row.\" If you were looking for an authentic Greek place, keep looking. This is not the place.",

    "text": "Meh...Friendly Service, but below average food and strange banging  I went here on Friday night with my wife, but I should have taken a closer look at the reviews before doing so.  The basic set up is a bit strange when you first walk in, but the setup is basically like Chipotle or Cafe Rio with premade food that they put into a container for you.  In this context, we opted for the combo (chicken and beef) and the beef platters.    First, the platter is primarily salad.  Second, the rice in the platter is overcooked and bland.  Third, the overly chopped nature of the beef and chicken are likely on purpose to hide poor quality meat.  Anyway, the platter was underwhelming.  The sauces that they offer aren't really that great, even the famous white sauce, and the hot one must be habanero based and will set your mouth on fire.  Either way, I won't be eating here again.  I will just go to the Great Greek Mediterranean Grill on Blue Diamond that is vastly superior to the food offered at Halal Guys.  The beef gyro just looks sad at Halal Guys.    Finally, this place has strange, loud banging.  I think the employees must be \"chopping\" the meat on the steel countertops, which causes a super loud, obnoxious banging noise that goes on for at least 15 minutes.  It is super distracting.  As to the NYC comparison, I have actually eaten at the one in Mid Town since it was part of a walking food tour.  I haven't eaten there in about seven years, but there is no comparison.  If you're lucky to eat at the one in NYC, and you don't want to opt for the tremendous amount of other options, then you should try the one there.  Just be ready for a long line and to eat while standing.",

That beautiful, luscious, creamy white sauce... goes well on anything.  I am not much of a fan of the beef. I feel like the chicken is their prize winner here.

Someone else asked for grilled onions, and again I can see the grill right there behind you... toss them on there bud, but nope.. So, I was not impressed with the level of service.  I thought it was a bit pricy to be honest. However, they stay open really late. So if you go out to the clubs then you can come here after (as if, I'm in bed by 10) for that much needed alcohol sponge.   Lower your expectations, and you will be just fine.",

We were already enjoying our first bites when my brother felt something's really different, something really hard. He spitted it out and found a metal piece. He then told them about it and they gladly gave him a new one no questions asked. He wasn't asked to pay and they gave him a coupon but when we checked it out it was already expired sooo... haha  I checked in too so I got one order of Baklava for free. It was my first time to try baklava and sadly i found it too sweet and too flaky.  Their hot sauce was really HOOOT even my husband who is a spicy person found it really hooot too. White sauce and bbq sauce were good too.  I only gave it 3 stars coz though i was satisfied with my order the fact that something not edible was in my brother's combo platter it made the experience a little less perfect.",

We opted for 2 regular size chicken \"platters\" and a side of hummus.  The food was actually really good.  I cannot complain however it was rather expensive, $27 for a fast food type meal is a bit pricey.  It's like this place comes from NYC so they are charging NYC   Service was on point.  The 3 staff members we encountered were friendly and jovial. While the \"white sauce\" was tasty I would suggest DO NOT LOOK AT THE CALORIES/FAT CONTENT.  Holy Mother of....it's a meal in itself.  Would I eat here again? Yes.  Would I eat here if I were on a diet? Yes, I would just forgo the bomb ass white sauce.  All in all the meal could be considered healthy sans that white stuff I can't get off my mind.",

Their gyros are on steroids. It's massive! They have a sauce section so for those saucy fanatics just dress your dish to your heart's content. The staff is very friendly. It would have been perfect if the sauce had more oomph to it. The hot sauce definitely packs heat but the white sauce was lacking compared to other gyros I've had. It was fine though because the gyro itself had so much flavor. The meat had a nice texture and flavorful. The vegetables were fresh. The experience was quick and easy. I would most likely come back the next time I want a huge gyro to digest.",

Like others, I found that the food did not live up to the hype that the New York locations boast.   The location is a little ways out from the Strip, and the interior of the restaurant is a slightly cramped and dreary. The workers were really friendly though. The food didn't blow me away; again, my expectations were probably too high. The plates come with your choice of protein - gyro, chicken or falafel. They also throw in some rice, lettuce, tomatoes, pita and some other condiments like onion and olives. I will warn you now, the hot sauce they have is POTENT. I had just a little bit and my mouth was on fire for a good 10 minutes. And the white sauce was delicious and probably the highlight of the meal.   Food is affordable at $10, but I look forward to trying their New York locations someday in the hope that they might live up to the hype.",

I got the combo plate without tomatoes like a real new yorker. The guy loaded my plate with lettuce and gave me a scoop and a half of rice,  I asked can you do a little more rice?  and he says that would be a dollar more.   LOL  First off,  the whole dish is a RICE DISH on a bed of rice. MY plate was literally half a salad.  Like I keep saying, you guys don't make it right,  I don't care how much you claim to be original. You guys don't make it right and it shows now,  the hype is over and people hardly show up.  Part of what makes the NY carts so good is that business is so good so the food is fresher.  The plates are also bigger and you don't feel cheated someway.  You guys, on the other hand, try to give people a full salad in a much much smaller plate.  Then offer caramelized onions jalepenos and olives at the end?  Am I at a subway?  Be honest,  if you have any relation to the True NY cart,  you would know. They charge 9 dollars per plate for twice the portions. You guys charge more for half.    But what is most infuriating is that the food isn't even the same.  even if you claim to do things a little differently here,  ITS NOT WORKING,  theres no customers.   so stop making excuses MR Manager.",

    "text": "So I have been back few times since the Yelp event. The biggest thing is the quality of the food or the experience has been just as fabulous. Sometimes coming back after a Yelp event for regular service can be hit or miss. The Halal Guys first thing off the top nice see got the air conditioning working. Not that it bothered me because pre opening there lot of things that can go wrong. The food has been consistent from my first visit to my recent visit (third). I know should have ordered something different but fan of the combo platter. I got the same thing all three times.   The things I enjoy about the combo platter are the portion size, freshness, and can do double of one protein if craving just one. The protein with the combo chicken and gyro it nice scoop of each. No matter if you get the regular or large size. The same goes with the rice as the base or the sides of fresh chopped lettuce and diced tomato. It steal of deal. The only way I finish is if am starving because its all carbs and protein. I did mixed it up one visit. I tried the baklava. It was very good. It was nice buttery with lots of layers. The price of one piece might be little pricey. I was happy I tried one just to say had one. Really the star of the show is the combo platter or the same ingredients in burrito style.   The chicken and gyro. The chicken like the fact all the meat is hand picked and shredded chicken. It can be dried out because they keep everything in steam table. The same goes with the falafel or the gyro meat. My experience never had problem with either one of the meats being dried out. I think the flavor is solid. The meat by itself is nothing that going blow you away just the honest truth. I feel it simple food nothing fancy. Just sticks to the history starting as food vendor on the streets of NYC. They just keep everything in steam tables and all about quick in and out or to go style. The white sauce not only is it addicting. It really is the ideal sauce with any one of the proteins. The white sauce feels like cheese Alfredo sauce. It not quite as thick of white sauce but the flavor is similar. The HOT sauce that just no joke. I would recommend put little spot taste before you go crazy with it. Once you drop whole bunch on top basically ruined it if not fan of the heat.   The service has always been awesome every visit. Each visit been different staff but each visit everyone smiling, enthusiastic, friendly, and awesome.   The restaurant is super small but again the whole concept is more to go then sit down. They do have couple tables and counter area. One of the best things about the hours stay open till 4am. So if you ever need The Halal Guys fix got you covered. I am happy brought some of that NYC to Vegas!!!",

Rachel F. mentioned in her review that \"it's a once and done\" experience and I felt the same way.   I went around 2pm on Thursday and there was no line. A girl behind the counter greeted me with an ice-cold stare and negative vibes. I understand it's a quick service here so I wasn't expecting a great service but a smile would have been nice. I ordered in clear and loud voice but she made me repeat everything I said three times, along with repetitive questions.   Me: \"Can I have beef gyro sandwich?\" Worker: \"Beef or chicken?\" Me: \"Beef\" *Grabs pita bread  Worker: \"Did you want beef or chicken today?\"  This went on with my other order. I understand if she was trying to listen to me but she was trying to multitask by making my order while chit-chatting with her other coworkers. I work in a customer service job and always have in mind that customers are the first priority. I guess they don't have that mentality here.   I ordered their beef gyro sandwich ($7.99) and small combo platter ($8.99) and did not like it. Meat is dry and flavorless, which has already been mentioned in many other reviews. I took other people's tip by drowning everything in their white sauce (a.k.a weak ranch dressing) which did help a bit.   On the pricier side but good portion, which doesn't mean much when the food sucks. \"Once and done.\" I won't be back here again.",

The chicken was sort of dry and tasteless. The beef was really good. I loved the rice and veggies on the side. And the pita bread wasn't dry at all. The falafel had a good taste but it was definitely dry inside and probably needed some sauce.   Speaking of sauce, the white sauce is a must !!! And if you like spicy, I recommend adding a couple drops of the red sauce. I loved the kick that it gave to my meal even though my mouth was burning at the end.

Ive noticed that meat portions are huge while falafel is small compared to it. Although the quantity is probably small due to it having to be prepped or something.  Yeah the food is okay, but I really dig the customer service. The people are nice and are always greeting me, telling me stuff, and the fact that twins work together here is pretty great.  I've only had the falafel gyros and the regular platter. Their falafel tastes good, its crunchy, but its pretty dry. To make up for the dryness of the falafel, I drown it in white sauce. I put a good amount on my gyro and then add one strip of their hot sauce. Their hot sauce is hot enough for one strip to make me sweat a bit. It's a good amount of spice to the point where I can actually taste everything else.  So the falafel dishes are okay, but the customer service is better.",

The line was a bit long and there wasn't anywhere to sit really so we ended up sharing a table with some strangers. No biggie.   In the chipotle style line, the food looked delicious. The meat was juicy and the menu is very simple. You can't really make mistakes there. However, none of us have eaten there before so we all got combo plates with all the sides.   THIS IS THE WARNING ---- After sitting down to eat, there are two sauces to put on your food. A delicious white tzatziki sauce and a red sauce that looks like ketchup/salsa but could only be described as hot lava. I was extremely hungry and doused a healthy amount of both sauces on the entire combo plate and took my first bite......in which I learned there was a large jalapeno covered in this hellfire sauce. I instantly started sweating and was holding back tears while I dined with my friends. I had to mix all the food together and add a ton of the white sauce to cover up the flames. The red sauce is super spicy.   However, the meat was good, the rice was good, and the menu is very simple. I wouldn't recommend the olives or jalapenos because the put way too much in and it is way too overpowering. I would suggest getting any of those toppings on the side. After picking out a mountain of olives and jalapenos, my friends and I agreed that the meal was MUCH more enjoyable. So take my word for it and take it easy on the hot lava when you give this place a shot.",

I gave them $60 to pay for the food and waited outside for their call for help later. No change at the end. LOL. I guess it was enough for the food and tip. My aunt and sister got falafals, and ordered 3 beef gyros for me, my dad and brother served with all inclusive toppings.  Never got to eat the food right away 'cause it was packed there. Drove about 15 minutes to get everyone home, and when I finally got to eat my gyro... It was just alright.  Maybe I had high expectations? Or maybe it wasn't comparable to Mediterranean restaurants I've already been to and enjoy? My gyro was too cold for me, and the drink I got from their soda dispenser (Sprite) was messed up with something else, so I cringed when I took the sip. Eh... My aunt and sister enjoyed their falafels though!",

I can't believe this place was allowed to open without AC in July and August in Vegas! Now they have signs up saying they will replace AC units next week! Signs have been up longer than that! Employees are not getting breaks and I heard a manager - Rene screaming at employees! I saw 4 quit at once. Not cool! Get it together! Employees are friendly despite the hostile, HOT work environment. Customers pay attention to how you treat your employees! This is why I refuse to shop at Walmart.   I don't like the china town location either. Hot and too small so getting food to go is the only logical option. I have to agree with Rachel F.'s review.

The foil container the food is served in, is fine but the food itself left me not wanting to really go back unless it's 2 am and I'm in that area looking for something veggie-like so that I'm not eating junk food before bedtime :)   In our experience, we had 2 orders of falafel and a chicken entree. The first falafel was ready but the second had to be prepared. No problem there - I'm down for fresh food. The issue was that when I eventually got my food - I had 2 fresh falafel balls out of the 3 and one of them was completely dry and old. My friend had 3 stale falafel balls. I gave her one of mine because I felt bad at how flavorless and stale the old ones seemed to be. That in itself sucks because it this was our first time here and the first impression had failed us so far.   I don't think the sauces are anything exciting either.  Not for me anyway. The main purpose of the white sauce seems to be to balance out the extremely unbalanced and overly hot spice of the red sauce. I'm sure there is a history to the sauce itself - but if it's not pleasant to eat, then what's the point ?  It was literally so uncomfortably spicy, and were it delicious as well - that would have been one thing. It was not, in my opinion, delicious. Nothing could wash it down either. Just hot hot hot. Honestly, I can handle a fair amount of heat but it just tasted as tho it were not made properly.   The rest of the plate was pretty whack too. As stated by other reviewers, the rice served with the entrees is strangely dry and unseasoned. There's flavorless, overly watery tomatoes and some bland iceberg lettuce. We are a culture of eaters. If this were the original or anything like it - I'd be stoked - but it all felt phoned in, so to speak. Just checking off boxes but not following through with proper flavor or balance.   Along side all of that - the seating is not comfortable if you have more than 2 people in your party. Tables are too close - constantly being bumped by other tables while people are just trying to sit down. The overall space that the restaurant is in, is crammed and just whack.  I know they are semi new to this area, but when we asked questions about sauces and food - a staff member said they hadn't had the food or sauces yet... I'm like ... ??? Anyway - if we ever go again I'll ask for fresh made falafel, I'll ask for it to go, and I'll pray this was just a fluke. $36 for 2 meals and 2 drinks and no one was happy. Dry falafel is unforgivable when it's a main menu item. Please fix this guys!   Happy Eating !",

    "text": "Halal Guys has probably been the only restaurant I've been excited about this whole year. I can remember my first time like it was yesterday (it was really only 6 months ago), it had just finished snowing, the cold winds were relentless, and I proceeded optimistically cautious to the famous food cart (see my NYC location review for details on orgasm). I swore to myself that one day I'll have another bite of its yellow rice, chicken, gyro meat, and white sauce. Thankfully THG has become a multi-million dollar company and expanded its white sauce deliciousness to the west coast (and even the Philippines).  The combo plate has not yet failed me (with only two visits how could it?). My only recommendation is extra white sauce, easy on the red sauce, and BBQ sauce if they have it. I could on about its buttery rice and moist chicken, but I'm sure the other (soon to be hundreds) of reviews will do that.   What is the appeal you ask? Perhaps its legendary name, the white sauce, or that tasty cheap eats are always on its own pedestal above all others, the only way to know for sure if THG is for you is to try.   Is it as good as the NYC locations? I don't think so and I don't know why. In NYC you are tasting the decades of grinding on the streets and hard work while in Vegas its the byproduct of that (flavors of The American Dream can be noted).   At least it fits my macros though.   50P/86C/30F for the combo platter with white sauce 0P/0C/10F per 2oz of WHITE SAUCEEE",

A new girl working started preparing the small plate and gave minute portions. There was a customer that came after us and colleen gave huge potions too. We decided to ask for the same and still got a little food. When I asked to give us a little more they said she is training. But thank goodness she gave us a little rice because it was hard and uncooked. The food was served cold. Do not recommend this location. Ive had halal guys in nyc and socal and this is by far the worst ive ever had. Save yourself the time of driving to spring mtn. This was gross.",

I've been eating at this place for a couple years now, and it never fails to disappoint me, I've visited The Halal guys in both New York and L.A. as well, and can honestly say that the consistency of service among the different branches truly is amazing. I would recommend future customers to get the lamb Gyro platter to go along with their world famous white sauce! If it was possible to give this establishment 7 stars, I would definitely do so! Overall, AMAZING FOOD!",

The chicken is really tasty and well marinated.  Perfect combination of rice, salad, and meat.  But most importantly the red and white sauce.  Definitely recommend trying the red sauce for all spicy food lovers!  It's really spicy, but so addicting.    Customer service was surprisingly catering for a fast food restaurant.    Would definitely recommend eating here if you don't feel like dressing up.  Great for late night munching.",

If this was a soft  opening it would have been fine, but it was grand opening and social media hyped. 3 stars for not meeting expectations and having very limited seating.   I've had Halal guys in Socal before. It was great then. For whatever reason, the Vegas one wasn't as good. I think I expected a bigger portion with more meat! Definitely more protein and veggies. I didn't finish my plate (I put in too much red sauce), but it was 90% rice left over.   The Red Sauce is literally fire like Indian or Thai spicy. Its hella hot. The white sauce was a bit more bland then I remember.   For Drunk food, I'd pick Halal guys over Pho Kim Long.",

I made excuses to my husband and told him they had to work out their kinks, maybe the workers needed better training. We left and forgot about the Halal Guys. Fast forward over a year later.. plenty of time for them to work out their issues, right? NO. The second visit was worse than the first. Actually, it was really the same issues as the last visit except this time, the rice was crunchy. Really dry and hard.

    "text": "When news hit that The Halal Guys were gonna open up in Vegas, everybody was excited including me. Ironically, I was in New York the same week they opened. Of course I got my Halal fix while I was there and when I get back home to Vegas, I was definitely gonna hit this place up for its that good.  Located in the same plaza as the Thai restaurant Krung Siam, these guys are basically on the corner of Spring Mountain and Valley View. The place is kind of small so good luck in finding a table at peak hours. I came in on a late tuesday evening around 9 pm. Im glad they close late for I was starving and was looking forward to another experience like I did just weeks before.  Unfortunately, it was no where near what I came to expect. The first thing that stuck out like a sore thumb was the giant portable air conditioner in the middle of the restaurant. Not only was it loud, but I dont think it was sufficient enough to keep the place cool for it was still pretty warm in there. Now if they were trying to simulate the hot outdoor weather of New York since its a food cart well then they kind of succeeded. You just dont have the humidity part. I still dont know how you New Yorkers get accustomed to that sticky feeling on your skin.  Anyways, I got the regular size Gyro Combo ($9.99) which was only a dollar more than the small combo. This consisted of shredded chicken, beef, a salad mix, some rice, and slices of pita bread.   This is the part that is very disappointing. Both meats were dry! I threw some white sauce on there and it only helped it a little bit. For those of you that are not familiar with their sauces, their main one is what people describe as a spiced up mayo/ranch sauce. Only this sauce seemed more watered down and I could hardly taste any spices. They also have a hot sauce that is a legit make you cry steam coming from your head type of spicy in which you should only put a little bit first just to see if you can handle the heat.  I hate to say it but this is where the \"chain\" restaurant label comes in meaning that the food is nothing like its original location. Thats the best way I can describe it. In my opinion, the food carts they have in New York, the reason why they have really long lines and its not dry is because the food is cooked fresh. This location it looks like they cook everything in mass quantities and then put them in food trays. So by the time you get your food, its been sitting in the trays for a little bit.  So in closing, I am very disappointed. Im definitley not gonna be craving this type of cuisine any time soon and if I do, it will be somewhere else. My experience was not good to the point that it was laughable because of the hype that came with this opening. If anybody asks me about these guys I will refer them to this review. Im not saying for them not to go but if they come back and tell me it was laughable as well, then I will have no choice but to call these guys \"The Ha!Lol Guys\"  Yelp 2016 Review #50  623 overall",

    "text": "In all fairness, I went to try (pay for my food myself) Halal Guys on 8/23/16 after the meh experience at their Yelp event. I understand that everyone is learning and maybe the food wasn't up to the company's usual standards.  The best part about Halal Guys is their service. Their employees are so friendly and engaging - they have top notch training for service.  While good service is to be expected at any business, I can't in good conscious give 3-5 stars where the food just isn't very good.  I've had the gyro, falafel and baklava here, at my own expense. None of it is good. The beef gyro is ground back into ground beef, the baklava is okay and the falafel are overcooked and underspiced. The rice is oily instead of flavorful. The white sauce that people rave about is soybean oil and an emulsifier - it legitimately has no flavor of anything in it. I just find it odd that at a Mediterranean / Middle Eastern restaurant, tumeric and cumin aren't detectable in any of their dishes.  Don't be fooled by the NYC bravado / pride and the Yelpese ( reviewers over-hyping mediocre food that they themselves will never revisit) Halal Guys needs to step it up. If you up the flavors and quality, people will pay for it. As it stands, there's nothing on the menu that warrants another visit.",

    "text": "The legendary New York street food vendor has finally arrived in Las Vegas. Rejoice!  Even if you've never tried their food, The Halal Guys should require no introduction if you follow social media at all. You must've had a friend or two post photos or rave about this restaurant, whether it's the original food cart in NYC or one of the new outposts in their wave of expansion. I was able to experience them in California and I was excited to have a vastly more accessible location at last (although it requires a U-turn or two lefts if you're approaching from the highway side).  I arrived at the start of typical dinner rush hours, so I was surprised that there was hardly any wait. After standing in front of a powerful A/C machine, briefly perusing one of the simplest menus anywhere, and waiting for my friends to arrive and get their own glance at the menu, I walked to the front of the line, ordered my food and sped my way to the cashier.  Combo Platter ($9.99 for regular size): about half of the aluminum tray had a salad mix, the other half had orange rice (with turmeric and perhaps other spices) that my friends mistook visually for cheese, and the rice was covered equally with chicken and gyro. Quick note: that legendary lamb gyro isn't even available at the original Halal Guys anymore (per multiple reviews), so the beef meat here is presumably the same that you'll get at any of their locations.  After you sit down (I don't see why you'd wait to sink your teeth into this), the right play is to grab white and red sauce bottles, then drench your food with white sauce. Maybe move the pita bread wedges out of the way first, but just get that rich creamy stuff into every bite. Then you might try just a touch of the spicy red sauce, which is legitimately spicy. Squeeze gently!  I must admit that I wasn't really picking up all the flavors at first, and perhaps there's a basis for that. The chicken was far more coarsely chopped here than at my first occasion, so there's probably less caramelization. Plus, peering into the open kitchen, I didn't see chicken on the grill or gyro on the vertical rotisserie, so perhaps the meats just get cooked up in batches and then left to linger. One of the employees was working on a huge pot of rice though, so there's that. And of course the baklava would be baked ahead of time (this portion seemed small so I skipped it).  However, I did save leftovers (all but the most ravenously hungry should have some), and I ended up devouring them late that evening. Maybe my palate just wasn't right earlier, and aside from still not picking up all of the nuances from my first time (especially in the sauce and the rice) and realizing that the meat was a bit dry, I was happy enough that my leftovers didn't live to see the dawn of another day.  Falafel ($1.99 for 2 pc): a little bit of False advertisement considering that the sign says $1 (presumably for 1 ball). Of all the fried chickpea balls that I've had, this is among the better ones in flavor. However, I wasn't that impressed with the texture because was a little mushy/dense inside and not all that crunchy on the outside. This is probably because they'd been fried long before they were served, just like the other proteins.  Baba Ghanouj ($4.99 for a decently sized tub and a pita): nice spiced flavor with surprising smokiness, plus discernible vegetable texture. The tub comes straight from the fridge, so it's cold. I suggest waiting for it to warm up enough to lose the cold temperature's numbing effect on the taste buds. Although it was my friend's order, I'd be amiss not to mention that Stefany V was right to recommend this side dish.  I'm a little disappointed overall, but I'm sure that I'll be back sooner or later when I get a craving for The Halal Guys. Hopefully it will hit all the right notes without forcing me to wait for hours.",

They are located in the same plaza as Krung Siam (the sign isn't visible when you're coming off of the freeway.)  I came in during the afternoon on a Monday and luckily there was no line! So I moseyed my way up to the front and ordered a small combo platter.    The small combo platter comes with chicken and beef gyro, a bed of rice, some lettuce, tomatoes, and three pieces of pita bread.  On the menu, it says they charge for extra red and white sauce, but the sauces are actually next to the sodas (free of charge! - so you can add as much as you want!)   Small vs regular?  There's only a dollar difference, but I was only able to finish half of my small combo platter for reference.    How did it taste? I was hoping for...more.  After putting some white sauce on, I found my chicken to be a little dry. So i continued to go to town with the white sauce so the chicken could soak up some moisture.  It helped, but still wasn't what I had hoped for.  The meat lacked flavor and I found myself heavily relying and the white and red sauce to bump it up.  Be warned: red sauce is extremely spicy, so don't go HAM, unless you know you can handle the heat.   The place is also extremely tiny!  There are 3 tables and 8 stools on the side.  All the tables were occupied, so we ended up sitting next to another couple on the stools.  Get comfortable with small spaces because you're literally sitting elbow to elbow with one another.    Great thing is that they are open until 4AM!  But I wouldn't see myself craving it again.",

    "text": "Forget the white sauce, their baba ghanouj is some of the best I've ever had. Also underrated: the falafel. Add on a couple pieces to your order, they're only a buck each.  Everyone seems to be eating the platters exclusively, so I started with a sandwich. The wraps are enormous- gyro meat is ground, which was not expected and isn't my preference, and wasn't my favorite meat. The chicken was nicely seasoned and robustly flavored. Unfortunately, the cold pita tore easily and just didn't taste that great, and the overall wrap needed the white sauce to keep the flavors interesting and provide moisture.   Returned for an event and got a platter- combined the meats I loved, the chicken and falafel, with their rice, and added extra white sauce and a touch of red. This was a solid meal. Add on a piece of baklava if it's available, this version isn't drenched in honey like other places. The $10 meal will definitely have leftovers.  Service is fair- staff is friendly, line moves quick, wasn't thrilled about how my order went all the way down the line through four employees who all noticed the torn pita issue and yet none of them thought to start over with one that wasn't falling apart.  A little confused about this choice of location, which is super small and has a hectic parking lot. Proximity to the Strip makes it an easy option to Uber- plus they're open til 4AM, just like NY.",

    "text": "This restaurant is located on Spring Mountain & Valley View.  $31.86 got me a fountain drink, a small falafel platter, a regular combo platter, and a chicken sandwich. Visited on Saturday 8-13-16 at 11AM.    I had to google what halal means...apparently it literally means \"permissible\" and describes food which is prepared in accordance with Islamic rules.  For animals, the whole throat must be slit at once including the windpipe, arteries, and veins.  Thank goodness they are allowed to stun the animal first because it seems unnecessarily cruel to let them bleed out while conscious.    ANYHOO....back to the review.  The first thing that struck me about this place was the air conditioner was broken.  WHY OH WHY would you have a grand opening with no A/C when it's 110 outside?  Seems like bad planning.    Inside it's set up kind of like a chipotle assembly line where you order at one end and pay at the other end.  It was much smaller than I expected with only 5-6 tables.   There were about 20 employees behind the counter and it was just mass chaos.  People bumping into each other, having to repeat myself several times, and they tried to short me a falafel.   The combo plate consisted of a spiced red rice, lettuce, diced tomatoes, slices of pita bread, diced chicken, and beef gyro meat.  It kinda threw me off that the beef looked more like ground beef than the flat shawarma-type meat I'm used to.  The bowl came with two pouches of their \"white sauce\" which tastes exactly like a really weak ranch dressing and one packet of hot sauce.  The hot sauce reminded me of sriracha...I'm glad I tried a little dab on my finger first cuz this stuff is hotter than Satan's ballsack.  The rice and meat were both not warm but not cold. They have a condiment bar with jalapenos, hummus, olives, onions, etc. but it is hidden from view and I didn't find out about it until today from checking their website.    This was my first time trying a falafel and I think maybe I don't like them.  The one I had was bland, room temperature, and hard as a rock.  I looked up a recipe for them and I think I received perhaps a bad example of a falafel.  They are made from ground chick peas and deep fried and I believe they are supposed to be crispy on the outside and moist on the inside....but again I'm not really sure.    This food was not cheap, the parking situation was horrendous, they had no air conditioning, and the food was incredibly forgettable.  The portions were very generous but the food was so bad I ended up throwing it all out instead of eating the leftovers.      It's a \"one and done\" for me.",

Also,  I've been getting it without the salad because its just cheap filler.  I had leftovers from my last visit which I never got around to eating because I was grossed out by the old rice and the sauciness.

    "text": "I was excited to try out this place with all the hype of it coming from New York to Las Vegas. Plus , I was really craving Mediterranean food. Sadly , the food left a lot to be desired.  I got the regular sized combo platter based on suggestions. The combo platter comes with chicken , beef , rice , lettuce , tomatoes and pita. The meat (especially the chicken) and the rice was dry but the white sauce helps make it more bearable. The reason for the 2 star rating is because there was nothing really special about the food. My 3 other friends who dined in with me also got the combo platter and said the same thing too. It's eatable , but nothing really stands out or makes you really want to come back. At least it's affordable and portion size was good - I paid around 10$ for my meal and saved the other half for dinner.  For you spice lovers , get the red sauce but beware it is spicy. TRY A LITTLE BIT BEFORE YOU PUT IT ON YOUR FOOD. I would say it is spicier than habanero and closer towards ghost pepper spicy but not all the way that spicy. I put waaay too much red sauce on mine and my lips swelled up for a good hour. I also went on a day when the A/C was broken and it was super humid in there. I still wonder to this day how I even ate half of my food at that time.  I do like how the service here is fast and friendly. They are open until 4 AM and it's not too far from the Las Vegas strip (being in Chinatown). I feel that this location is great for those late night , post clubbing eats when anything sounds good haha.",

    "text": "Opening Day wasn't as bad as I thought it to be, especially it being my first time actually going to a foodie opening day anything. The Halal Guys is located near the start of Chinatown plaza, next to Krung Siam Thai, Starbucks and Pokeman. Upon arrival, parking was definitely limited but we were lucky to find a spot nearby instead of across the street. The waiting in line was decent - especially for it to be around 10:30~11:00am+ it wasn't massively packed. Employees offered small water bottles while we waited under white tents within the comfort of fans and mists so the hospitality aspect was there. They gave away their branded restaurant shirts for low key advertisements that had various sizes from small to extra large. They also had a DJ next to the entrance to bring up the vibe while hungry customers waited patiently in line.   When finally entering the restaurant, its actually quite small, compact, and slightly \"humid\". You can smell the aroma of their foods rather strongly as you get closer to ordering. My friends ordered for me while I saved and waited at a table for us to dine in, since they were more knowledgeable of the menu and tried it in New York.   They got me a combo platter which consisted of chicken, beef, rice, lettuce, tomatoes, and pita. I did like how soft the pita bread was so a hungry me biting onto it was definitely heavenly. Chicken and beef were a bit dry unless doused in their white sauce which added a decent flavor to the meal as a whole. I really wish they were generous with their tomatoes though, the portion seemed rather small but perhaps I am just biased because I love tomatoes lol. The hot sauce is definitely not for the weak or for those who typically order just \"mild spicy things\"- I skimped out on that when I tasted a smidge of it at the ends of my fork, so heed caution!! My friend had his platter drowned in hot sauce, and bravely finished it despite having a red face full sweat and refilling his fountain drink thrice in a row haha!! Ahh I forgot to get their hummus so maybe I'll come back again to try that.   Overall, decent experience for an opening day. I would honestly only come here if I crave middle eastern cheap eats. I feel that if I really want to heighten my experience though I would actually try the gyro food cart in New York as its in a fast-paced industrial area with better weather.",

We came a few days after the grand opening and they were still getting their AC situation sorted out... so that meant NO AC... and there was no ice in their drink dispenser so we were basically dying.  We got what we got when we first had halal guys, reminiscent of our trip to NY. I got the beef gyro/chicken combo sandwich and he got the combo rice platter. The staff is really nice, they talk you through it if you're unfamiliar with the set up, warn you about the red sauce, etc etc. We arrived just RIGHT before the lunch rush and grabbed the last two bar seats against the wall.   Overall the food was good, but if you've ever tasted halal guys from the cart - it's just not the same when it's prepared in a restaurant! We both finished our meal, so there's no denying it was good.",

What's even better is that they're located right in the grand busy sector of china town, which is pretty much where I go when I'm drunk and on the roam for food haha  I always pick their combo bowl and get the chicken, which has a good amount of seasoning and flavor, and the lamb which is a definite choice for myself any time I get shwarmas or any type of halal food. The combo goes great over the warm bed of rice and soft hot pita bread pieces you get. Oh! And don't forget to get extra white sauce packets!!   Um for the red hot sauce, I suggest going easy on it. I made the dire mistake of using too much once and I couldn't taste much that day other than fire and death in my mouth.. Worth it, but seriously go easy there on it buddy!  The meal itself is also pretty cheap, roughly about 9 bucks so you can't complain that you're paying too much considering the portion sizes come in ranges of moderate to fatass level. Thanks for bringing some east coast goodness to Vegas halal guys!!  But uhh where's the lamb at? The Las Vegas location is lacking it, and the menu is rather small and lacking :(  Halal guys is no fancy diner but it is what it is, cheap vendor food, that's filling and quick. And when you're wanting cheap and quick vendor food, halal is pretty decent. I just don't feel the appeal though as much with it being a restaurant style, kinda like turning an ice cream truck into a walk-in diner; it loses the appeal to an extent.",

Spring mountain is far for me as well as a lot of Las vegas natives but perfect if you are visiting and staying on the strip. As soon as you walk in you can see how small it is. There are maybe 4 tables? However, the food was great. I have never had halal guys on the east coast so i do not have much to compare to but I really loved it. THE WHITE SAUCE. GAWWWWD YES. I am so glad one of the workers warned us about the red sauce, because that shit is not playing!! Its so spicy legit be careful fam.   I got a regular platter & the chicken and gyro were really flavorful.  My favorite thing was the baklava!! Im definitely willing to go back just for the baklava.

I've eaten Mediterranean in the past and enjoyed it, so when I've seen billboards and commericals around town hyping up the grand opening of Halal Guys, I thought I'd give it a try.   When we walked in, my immediate thought was, this place is tiny! The MMA fight store, the previous business, was four or five times the size of the common area. The other tiny thing is the selection on the menu: Sandwich or Platter. Then choose your protein: chicken, beef, chicken/beef combination, or falafel.   Ironically, what's not tiny is the number of their staff. There must've been nearly ten employees including the owner/manager type dudes that came out to ask about our experience - nice touch.   I went with the Sandwich Combo while she had the Platter Combo. They make it right in front of you Subway style, so you can customize your sandwich of three items: lettuce, tomato, and white sauce.  The amount of meat was great, but unfortunately, very bland.  Her platter didn't sit well - she ended up having diarrhea and encouraged me to mention it in this review.   Overall, the experience was like being on New York City street coughing up nine bucks for below mediocre grub - I guess they nailed it.   Halal Guys prides itself for founding it's success as street food but it's like they chose not to elevate it when as a brick & mortar. Since they're now in Vegas, they should find a way to put a cart outside the clubs. I'd eat it then, but not before.",

The gyro actually won over my taste buds against the chicken. Beware of the hot sauce! Delicious, but the spice level is top knotch.",

    "text": "There was a lot of hype for The Hall Guys when it opened so I had pretty high expectations. Sad to say, my expectations were not met. I've had much better gyros at other places.   I'm glad the chaos died down a little and there wasn't a line to order. I heard the chicken was good but the gyro wasn't that great. I decided to try the combo of chicken and gyro. It also came with rice, pita, lettuce, and tomatoes. Pretty simple but portions were very big. I like the rice, the chicken was okay, and the gyro was a bit salty. But I was really hungry so I still enjoyed the food.   Because we ate there, we grabbed the bottles of the white sauce and hot sauce (much better than paying extra for extra sauce). The hot sauce is definitely hotter than more hot sauces -- I probably shouldn't have put it all over my plate lol. Everyone LOVES the white sauce but I don't see what's so special about it. I'd much rather have tzatziki with my gyro.   I'd eat here again if I was in the area but I would go out of my way or crave it.",

What I love about the NYC location is the portion size, taste, and price.  The chicken and rice is a bit dryer here, bowls are smaller, and the price is a little more.  All that being said, I'm still giving this Halal Guys 4 stars.  I almost have to since I'm here at least twice a month.  How can I honestly say that it's just okay and continue to get my Halal fix?  I no longer get their Chicken & Rice, though.  I just come for the chicken and a lot of it.    Couple of Tips.. -Service is always great -Parking can be a nightmare -The Falafel is great when it's fresh.  Hard as nails when it's not. -Protein only bowls range from $3 to $14.  I get the same bowl every time and charged a different amount almost every time.  -The White Sauce is still the bomb.   -I welcome other restaurants from the East Coast to open in Las Vegas.  The more the merrier.",

While I seldom choose a meat options, I went with traditional gyro meat in the platter.   Well... when I first looked at my platter, I was thinking to myself that the meat looked extremely greasy. It made me a bit nervous.   If you are dining in, they have bottles of the famous sauces you can bring to the table.   White Sauce- I was kind of let down because I expected some super tasty garlic-y sauce, but it tasted like plain ranch dressing.  Red Sauce- HOT! They give fair warning! I am a heat connoisseur who orders an 8 at Thai restaurants... This stood up very well. Its HOT HOT HOT, but still tasty. Just eat it on the side or only start with a tiny drizzle!  They have Tahini sauce as well. Tasted pretty traditional & up to par.  So anyway- Once you get the whole bowl rockin with sauces and toppings, the greasiness of the meat leveled out. The pita they serve with it was also kind of greasy but oh so delicious.   They are open late, its clean inside, and I would definitely recommend it or eat it again.",

And the location is pretty convenient for me!   The line usually isn't too long. I either get the combo with chicken and beef or just the beef. I drench my plate with the infamous white sauce and about 7-8 drops of the hot sauce. Mind you, their hot sauce is intense! I would be really careful with that. The few times I had Halal Guys in New York, the pita bread was always soft and fresh. However, the pita bread here just isn't right, it's usually cold and has like a stale taste to it.   I'm alway a happy customer when I come here because it just satisfies my craving so much! Would definitely recommend if you like these types of food.",

I highly recommend a chicken or combo plate! The baklava here is also hella bomb. We got this postmated so we I have no idea how the service is but we placed the order at like 5pm and it didn't leave the restaurant til 6:30 so I am assuming they were a little slow. Other than that, portions are cool even though it's less than LGB and the rice was bomb. I'll definitely be back again when I need my Halal guys fix.",

The restaurant it self is very small inside with limited seating. We've never had the chance to dine in since there's never usually a table to sit at. I've personally been back a few times since they've opened and always get the combo, but will most likely try other things in the future.",

Being part middle eastern, I was extremely excited about this place opening. There's not enough of that genre of food in this town and I was excited for a fast food option (wish it was a little closer to my home, but maybe it's better that way!) They did not disappoint.   The food is outstanding. And appeals to everyone being as it's just chicken, beef, and for the adventurous soul, falafel. The chipotle style of service works well for them. You can pick and chose which options you want on top of your customized platter or sandwich. Also a side of fries, falafel, or baklava can add a cherry on top of your perfect meal.   The best thing about this place is the white sauce. Oh the white sauce. And they have giant bottles at each table so that each customer can douse their food in it, or if you are a weirdo, only have a little.   Overall this place is amazing. Even if you haven't ever tried middle eastern cuisine, give this place a whirl. It's a great segway into that type of cuisine.",

    "text": "I tried to lower my expectations due to the insane amount of hype about this place (albeit from the New York City original cart) but even after several visits, I have to admit that I'm just not a fan. The food just isn't very good.   The beef is so salty that all I could taste was salt, salt and more salt. I guess that's what the sauces are for but I'm not a sauce / dressing fan. I guess I'm sort of a purist because I think if the food at its core is tasty, you shouldn't have to drown it in sauce to make it edible -- and that's what is going on here. Heed the warnings about that hot sauce; it is H-O-T and that is not a myth that's overblown. That mess will light your butt on fire!  The sad pita bread was just gross. I'm a bread addict and even I didn't want to eat it. I'm not sure if it's made in-house, but I wouldn't be surprised if it's not. There was nothing fluffy nor fresh nor appetizing about it. It was bad. The tomatoes, lettuce and cheese were just your run of the mill, straight off the food delivery truck quality.   The ONLY good thing on my plate was the rice, and it is clearly the superstar. Flavorful, light and fluffy, it's worth eating (which is fortunate because it takes up the majority of the container)! This place is expensive and the portion size of the meat is too small for what it costs. I don't want to pay $10 for a lunch that consists mostly of cheap rice!   The employees are very friendly, competent and willing to help, and the crunchy falafels are a tasty vegan option (serious vegans beware: the line workers aren't as careful as they should be about cross contamination; I saw one lady scooping meat and then falafels with the same utensil).   Adding to the problem of the subpar food is the horrendous parking situation. There is quite literally NOWHERE to park. This place is located in a very busy Chinatown shopping mall so the spaces are almost always completely filled all day and all night, making this an inaccessible place to eat or to get takeout.",

We thought it was closed because there was literally no one in there except for the two girls working. The interior is kind of dull and flat with yellow and red as the main colors. Kind of like a depressing McDonald's for adults.   The menu is pretty basic. We shared a platter with half chicken/ half gyro. The girl working pronounced the gyro with a hard g which was surprising because gyro is their main menu item so clearly the training was lacking?! The platter is very basic- comes with lettuce, tomato and rice. The chicken was really dry and not at all \"seasoned to perfection\" like their website states. Once we sat down, we obviously grabbed the squeeze bottles of hot sauce, \"white sauce\" and tahini. It was actually really tasty  with the white sauce all over it, but let's be honest, that \"white sauce\" would be good all over anything! Once all the flavors of the sauces were mixed in, I all of a sudden had a change of heart and thought, ok maybeee I'll come back ;). The hummus was good but 4.99 seemed pricey given it comes w 1 piece of pita bread for an entire container.   I saw on their website that they are the #1 yelped business in NYC. I'm not sure if their food tastes different on a bustling New York City street but it certainly wasn't that exciting last night.",

    "text": "My first time trying gyro was an awesome experience! I heard this place was the bomb in Cali, and seeing the stars level here in Vegas I'm quite surprised. I actually really enjoyed everything from the minute I walked in to the minute I walked out.  Service- 5/5. Super nice and helpful. Very friendly and talkative!  Food- 4/5 Well obviously it's my first time having gyro so I can't compare it to anything else. It was delicious and filling and a great serving size seeing that it filled both the honey and I up. The white sauce is soooo yummy, whatever it is. And I really liked the flavor the jalapenos gave the meat. Pita bread all the way too, give me more of that!!!!  Price- 3/5 A little more on the pricey side. I mean it's just $1 more to get the large so why not get the large and save it for later if you can't finish it.  Location- 3/5 Seeing that it's located in Spring Mtn is good and bad. Bad cause it's far away from home!!!! And near the strip. But it's good because everything on that street is pretty much open late and they're open til 4am!!! WOW!  Overall, I like halal guys. Thank you for opening my eyes up to new things.",

    "text": "Every trip to NYC, halal guys is always on the first of my list. Squatting on the sidewalk, devouring my combo rice platter is the best way to enjoy this once NYC exclusive staple. A halal guys in Vegas? wow.... All i can say is is that Las Vegas is becoming the fast food mecca in America where almost any regional exclusive chain can be found here now.   Setting: If you're coming eastbound on spring mountain, its kind of a hassle to get here. You'll have to make a right at the light and then u-turn into the plaza where this place is located. Open until 4am, this is my new go to after party eatery since the line at tacos el gordo is absurdly long.   Service: Pretty friendly! You can ask for no vegetables so that they give you more rice, which is my typical order and how they serve it at the halal guys cart. They also have pickled jalapenos, beets and other fixins behind the counter that you have to ask them for.   Food: They keep the gyro meat in a metal container that is soaking in grease. When I saw the guy open the lid it made me lose my appetite when I saw all the grease just bubbling through the meat. This location does not have lamb!!!! The chicken is grilled so less grease.They offer sauces for $1 but you have multiple sauce bottles by the soda dispenser. Pro tip: Unleash a bukkake of white sauce all over that bad boy and mix it up! Also and this is VERY VERY VERRRRYYYY important so listen up. Add maybe 8-10 drops of the hot sauce and mix that bad boy up good. This sauce is straight from hell and it will murder you and your butthole if you do not heed my warning.  Overall: If everything is closed or too long to wait, i'll come here when we finish up our late night escapades, but I wouldn't come here wanting to eat. It's not bad but the amount of grease and the fat content of the white sauce will set your fitness goals very behind.",

    "text": "I had to run errands in the area and decided to stop by. First and foremost, the workers here were awesome. They were extremely friendly and took the time to explain everything to us because it was our first time. The establishment itself looked pretty clean and well kept. The sauces were all labeled with the day that they were made, which was reassuring.   Overall, the food quality was not bad but nothing amazing. The chicken was middle of the road. Not super tender and not too dry. The gyro meat was pretty damn salty. After I started eating my plate, I realized that I needed to pretty much empty half a bottle of white sauce to mask the saltiness. I'm sure that much sauce can't be too good for you, but I'm sure I've done worse to my body. The Baklava they gave us with the yelp check in was BOMB! Hands down the best part of the meal.   I kept reading about how spicy the red sauce was so I really wanted to try for myself. Let me preface this by mentioning that I am Korean. I love eating food that makes my lips go numb and makes me break out in sweats. I started off by drizzling a small amount of sauce over my plate, but ended up dumping a ton of red sauce halfway through my meal. The red sauce definitely lived up to the hype and I loved how much it hurt. I'm definitely going to be shooting fire out my ass tomorrow, but it was worth it.   The portion size is quite generous. Two regular size combo's was more than enough to fill us up. Pricing here was $8.49 + tax each and I think it's a fair price to ask for. This place offers decently good value for your money, but is nothing spectacular. Imagine a mediterranean version of chipotle. Would I drive out from henderson to come here? Probably not. If I was in the area, would I try it again? Sure.",

They greeted as I came in, told me they'll be right with me to get my order since they had a large family order right before I came in.   Food was delicious. They have two sizes for the plates. I believe it's a regular or small? Or large and regular? Anyways the bigger plate is perfect for 2. I forget if it's called pita bread or naan bread but it was soooooo soft and good that I wish I had ordered more of it. Definitely makes me want to try the wrap and hope it's the same type of bread. Baklava was delicious. It is sweet as it's primary ingredients are honey, walnuts/pecans (?) and pastry bread. I did wish it was more flaky though.   Eating area is pretty small for a place that is well know to be good. Ordering was a bit confusing as there was no line or signs in place. But it's just like Chipotle Eecept you don't see a bar of the food. I was only able to glimpse at the girl scooping rice and one of the meats.",

I'd recommend this place to anyone for to-go orders, it's not a great spot to dine-in because when they are chopping the meats on the stove it's incredibly loud, like nearly deafening to the point where you can't have a conversation lol. Also the line can take a while, if its more than 3-4 people then we usually don't wait. Another reason why doing to-go is usually the better option!",

They always give me an extra bit of rice since I don't eat their sliced tomatoes (I feel that tomatoes that are pre-sliced get soggy/lose their flavor so fast and then become bland). They always try to make their food as fresh as possible, which is why I don't mind waiting a few minutes for fresh chicken or beef. It's also a nice perk to get a small discount as well for being a local who buys pretty regularly.  Always enjoyable.  Also,  if you like baklava, their baklava is pretty  good according to the bf. Happy eating! :9",

    "text": "This place is good but definitely not the place to get a classic gyro. First off, the way they label their menu is confusing. They call gyro a \"sandwich\" You can choose chicken or beef - I chose chicken and it really lacked seasoning. The gyro didn't even come with tzatziki sauce. Their \"white sauce\" is essentially just mayo. They also didn't even put feta on it. What good is a freaking gyro without feta?! They put jalapenos on it too....Needless to say, everything about this place confused me.  WARNING: Their hot sauce is blazing hot. Please try it before you drench your food in it. My friend covered her food in it and could barley eat it because it was so hot.  It's a very small place and I'm pretty sure when they chop their chicken their goal is to make as much noise as possible. They literally slap the spatula on the chicken and it makes the loudest noise and it goes on for like 5 minutes.   Overall, it tasted good but lacked a lot of flavor. I don't think I will be coming here again because I know a lot of other places that have better gyros.",

We all ordered the chicken platter and all 3 of us had dry and burnt chicken. This is unacceptable that they can charge 12 +plus tax for a meal that is like eating jerky! I don't mind spending the money either, clearly I have eaten her before.... But you should never send food out of your restaurant that is not perfection!  Update: Right after I posted this review Angela reached out to me I believe she's the GM. She apologized for the bad experience and wanted to make up for it. She offered me and my 2 co-workers a free meal next time we come in. I wasn't sure if the girls would want to order again, until I talked to them . We decided to give it a go again since every Saturday we order out as a ritual of ours (our cheat meal). I text Angela and she was so helpful and took care of the whole thing. When it arrived we were all nervous... Pleasantly surprised though! The chicken looked perfect not dry at all, we all took our first bites and agreed that this was the best we had ever received from halal!! The flavor was on point! So a big thank you to Angela for making us all believers again!!",

The phone was going off the hook and there were so many people wanting to eat halal guys, Ruby kept her cool and she was busting her butt. I hope she gets a raise because that place gets hectic. Whoever owns this place should think about adding at least one more person to busy holiday shifts, it's definitely not fair seeing the only two running around, trying to serve 15 people not even counting the Postmates orders (about 6).

The parking sucks, but that's probably because of the Grand Opening, not to mention it's next to a Starbucks and other restaurant I believe.  Other than that the service is great and very fast.  I was in and out in 5 minutes.  I actually spent more time trying to find a place to park lol.  There's not very many tables to sit inside, but that doesn't bother me since I always take my food to go. Either way, the food delicious and cooked to perfection; not dry at all.  And the white sauce...let's just say I could drink it from that pack.  Lol, that's how good it is.  Besides Hot 'N Juicy, Halal is the best thing that's happened to Chinatown.  #TheHypeIsReal",

They gave you the rice, meat, and the veggies and I could never finish my plate. So, I would always have leftovers to share. I went there today and the quality of the food has gone down dramatically. The meat was to oily and the rice was under cooked and crunchy to where it felt like I almost broke a tooth on numerous bites. To top it off I don't know if it was just the person who was working today but I ordered 3 large platters. Each plate had maybe one scoop of that famous red rice that was crunchy and one scoop of meat which was oily. I actually had to stop eating the rice because it hurt to bite it. And the plate serving was like she was giving us a sample of the items so small. Maybe because the guy I was with said it was his first time here that she thought she could get away with giving us small portions and under cooked rice?!?!? I know as time goes by companies look to save on cost but this is ridiculous. I recommended a lot of people here and I hope they didn't get the service, quality of food, and portions that I got today.",

I'm a stickler for not having skin or fat in chopped/sliced chicken prepared by others, so I was pleasantly surprised by the quality in addition to the flavor.

    "text": "We were at a baby shower over the holiday weekend that served Halal Guys and it was delicious so we decided to have them cater an impromptu Labor Day family lunch 2 days later. Couldn't have been easier to order. It was delivered right at the time we scheduled for and came with everything we needed and didn't even know we needed like chafing dishes, sterno, serving utensils, individual food signs, lighter, and a well made instruction sheet on how to set everything up. The food was delicious and devoured. Would definitely use them again in the future!",
