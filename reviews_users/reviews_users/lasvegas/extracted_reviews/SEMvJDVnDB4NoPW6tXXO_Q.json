Good vibes with soft music. Best Korean BBQ on Rainbow! Will come back for sure.",

    "text": "I came to Goong based on a recommendation from a friend that lives for Korean BBQ. It been while since had some so figure mix it up plus never been so why not right. I meet up with my cousin for dinner because Korean BBQ for one really makes no sense. Lol.   The menu has a nice diversity and since it was both of our first time just made things more confusing. If not AYCE I always find that get the dinner for two or three people all based on the party...safe way too go. We decided on the beef platter for two or three people. Guess most of the meats all Wagyu meats or they promote it very clearly on the menu and in the restaurant. The lists of meats might not seen like lot there was six different cuts. It more then enough food. The SIDES never seen spread that literally covered the entire table. Hell we had no room for bowl of rice or the fact ordered cold spicy noodle dish (it sounded interesting and never had cold buckwheat noodles). The sides comes with two different soups both hell of good. The kim chee soup had great depth not just kim chee heat and the egg soup or custard really really good. I could have ordered big bowl of both with side of rice be happy camper. The sides so many different ones no way going remember them all. I been to other Korean BBQ that give you lot of sides but not only the different sides but some of them nice portion not just tiny scoop or couple pieces. Really no bad side that can remember they all solid plus one was japache. Two different kinds of salad that was really refreshing way to start the meal. The first set of meats comes on a really nice display each marked for the four different cuts. Definitely give it five stars on the presentation!!! They even had tags on them all fancy. They ask you the cut want start off with first. We just went with the waitress recommendation since it was our first time. Finish off was the brisket and last one was bulgogi. Halfway through they changed the grill always something notice and look for at Korean BBQ. The more meat or protein cook that should be automatic. They did! All the meats were awesome! SoooOOOO much food. I went into cow coma by the end of it. Some sides that never got around to cause I was that full of meat. Normally say AYCE Korean BBQ only way to go. Really with the recent rush of Korean BBQ or Hot Pot places around town. Quality over quantity is the Korean BBQ way too go.   The platters may look pricey at first sight. If you break it down steal of deal in my mind. If you factor in all the sides (literally that could count for meal by itself...no joke) and the different protein. Awesome. The interior is very modern then other places around town. It little more dark on the inside with the decor. I like the way the booth and table set up with the grill. The location can be little deceiving cause it kind of hidden from DQ in front of it. I drove past it by accident. Just look for the DQ. If the parking lot full no worries just park at the one right next too it.",

I asked for some recommendation and got the following:  Pork jowl/pork toro $12 Wagyu Short Plate (Wagyu Kalbi) $11 Bulgori (Marinated thinly sliced ribeye) $11   I would say pork toro and wagyu beef were my favorites. Wagyu kalbi is a good deal for 5-6oz of meat at $11. Pork toro had lots of fat which I don't mind at all. If anything, I would use the term \"juicy\" instead of \"fatty.\" Bulgogi is too sweet for me so that was a pass for me.   Lots of banchan and all were great. Nicely done bathroom also.

Then the waitress bought us an item we didn't order but I didn't realize that until after the bill was brought to the table.

They went all out making the space look sexy and modern, making it a spot worthy for a date night or just hanging out with your friends. Tables are large with plenty or space for you to spread out so you don't have to worry about bumping elbows.   They've got so many different cuts of meat that's it's overwhelming. You're better off going with one of their specials like the Goong special ($145) advertised as being good for 4-5 people. It includes wagyu rib eye, wagyu top sirloin, prime boneless short rib, wagyu chuck flat, prime flat iron, pork belly, pork jowl, marinated prime short ribs, and black tiger shrimp. With that many items it's easy to lose track of what is what. So, you just dig in. I think some of my favorites were the wagyu rib eye... or was it the top sirloin... or maybe the flat iron. I don't really know. Again, it was hard to remember what cut I was eating, but it was all good.  Another thing that was slightly confusing was the banchan... was that all you can eat? We had to request seconds of a couple dishes. And, when the bring out dishes you have to eat them family-style not individual dishes.   If you don't care about those small details, you'll love this place.",

    "text": "What's to say? The whole time we were there it felt like we were being rushed and they couldn't wait till we left. They had closed down 80% of the restaurant at 10:50pm, when they closed at midnight.  The chairs were on the tables, floors mopped and nobody in sight. We walked away, double checked the closing time, still midnight, so we doubled back and finally saw a waiter. Food was good, but they asked to cook the meat for us in the kitchen (so they didn't have to clean another grill?). Our server took our order and this is my personal pet peeve, HE DID NOT WRITE DOWN THE ORDER. I don't care who you are, write it down or have a photographic memory. He forgot the drink I ordered and brought it to us as we asked for our to-go boxes. Would it of killed him to write it down? Maybe but at least my order would have been complete. All of the side dishes, and there are plenty, were wonderful, except for the weird soupy thing I did not care for, but they put them down without really explaining which dipping sauce went with what. Overall, pricey, a-la-cart and decent food but not worth the rush.  *TIP - only go for the complimentary cinnamon tea at the end.

    "text": "Good food.  Great decor.  Comedy free of charge.  Comedy first.  Platform seating.  Shoes off, lots of bending required.  Guys, including my two Asian poker buds wearing glorified denim pantyhose AKA skinny jeans.  Just imagine a giraffe trying to sit and you get the picture.  (There are regular tables but what's the fun of that?)  Swanky.   The easiest way to describe the ambiance and what sets this KBBQ joint apart from its competitors.  From glass cases showcasing their beef to thick cut, glistening pink, raw cuts being presented on synthetic black stone slabs.  The design focuses all the attention on the food you're about to cook.  IMPORTANT, Goong advertises two types of beef, Wagyu and Prime.  To avoid disappointment understand Wagyu is a breed of cow not an indicator of quality.  The wagyu breed It is characterized by sweet flesh capable of achieving extremely fine marbling.  \"Prime\" denotes USDA prime and DOES reflect the marbling regardless of the breed.   Not all Wagyu is USDA Prime or higher.  Choose your cut based on the flavor you want to enjoy.  Tip:  Opt for a set.  Sets include all the banchan (including a salad), steamed egg, a choice of soup for the table and a good cross selection of their proteins.  Add additional proteins ala carte if you think you need more food.  A few mushrooms are provided for grilling.  No additional veg.  Standard KBBQ cuts.  Beef cut thicker than most places the quality very good (USDA choice or higher).  Pork has a good amount of fat that crisps up nicely.  Marinades tend to be on the sweet side.  Regardless of set, be sure to order some pork jowl.  Sweet, porky goodness.   Beef lovers, it's all about the wagyu short plate.  Lots of internal fat.  Sweet beefy goodness.  Unlike most KBBQ places, you are in full control of your grill.  Servers will offer to help to start you off but thereafter, it's all you.    KBBQ is stepping up its game in Vegas and Goong is right at the forefront.",

Truthfully it was the best food experience I have had in Vegas and that includes going to places that are 10x in cost of Goong.  Would recommend everyone to try this place out.

I thought I had found the one place that I really liked until I tried this place!  The food, although smaller portions than what I'm used to, was fresh and tasty without being too salty or overly spiced.  Even as we asked for more of a particular side we were told that the kitchen had run out because we ate it all!   The service here is amazing. Comparatively to all the other Korean restaurants that I have tried the service in this location is by far the best I've ever received.  In most other Korean restaurants it has become the norm for me to be told how to eat, when to eat, and to be questioned why I was mixing certain spices and sauces to accommodate the flavors of my meal. The service is usually very abrupt, pushy and cold.  Here, I felt as though I was given the opportunity to eat the way I want to eat. And to cook my food the way I want to cook my food. The entire time our server was extremely attentive to our needs as though we were his only guests. He was always there to make sure we had everything that we needed. And didn't question our choices.  He was also made recommendations suggestions to help make our experience that much better.  I cannot wait to go back again!",

It's a little pricey than average but absolutely worth it. The restaurant is nice and new and has some sophistication in the waiting staff are very friendly and do a great job. The vegetables came out and were amazing fresh tasty and beautiful to look at. I highly recommend this place to eat.",

We are used to the all you can eat so portion control was definitely something different to get used to. Also our family likes our meats well done but they were fastidious about constantly removing and lowering the fire, again something to get used to.",

    "text": "A very embarrassing experience for me entertaining friends.   With a large convention in town i had friends from 4 different states in Vegas and i thought what a great way to have a community meal than Korean BBQ. I decided on Goong because i simply wanted my guests to have the best experience possible with quality, service, and of course the presentation of the space. The one positive note i will make to start is the layout and decor is nothing to complain about, but that's where the positive ends. Our server was certainly new (he mentioned it), but i do not think his lack of service was completely his fault. He began the meal by cooking the meat, even before we had banchan or rice on the table (a bit odd). When i asked about the banchan, the server had no idea what i was talking about. I don't expect you to be Korean (although it helps) to work at a Korean restaurant but maybe at least learn what you are serving or should be serving at a minimum. When he finally did go back to get our banchan, the meat was then left to over cook where we then stepped in and cooked it ourselves for fear of ruining meat. This act of overcooking our meat by our server was happening all night as he was constantly running back and forth trying to keep the banchan flowing and the meal moving in the right direction. I typically cook when going to KBBQ, but i wanted not to this time so i can converse with my friends whom i haven't seen in years. Unfortunately, this wasn't able to happen because our server lacked the efficiency by himself to handle the table. The restaurant had only 3-5 other tables, so i am unsure why addition assistance didn't come from some of the other staff just standing around. The server also didn't mention what he was cooking, so there was a lot of confusion if there was meat that had yet to be served to us. I later learned that he didn't mention the meats because he wasn't aware of what he was actually serving, similar to him not knowing what banchan was. The end of the meal was the worst moments because my guests were still looking forward to eating but the meat stopped flowing. Lots of confusion and 10 minutes of me getting up and addressing the staff determined that 3 orders of meat was lost in the service and they brought them out after to serve. 2 of my guests were no longer interested in eating at that point, and the other 2 i am sure ate it so that it didn't go to waste as they could sense my frustration throughout the entire meal. Difference in quality? Not terribly different to some of the other spots i have been, and certainly not worth the lack of service displayed here. Couple that with our server overcooking it and you get the idea, it's simply not worth the efforts or money. Never again. I will prefer to order the meat, and have them bring it out to me and ill cook for my guests and keep the flow as it should be.   To the management  - Think about training your employees to at a minimum knowing the menu. Basic knowledge on what the word banchan is or what Bulgogi might be is day 1 of learning i would think.  - Think about having a support for the servers cooking. A banchan dish is empty and the server asks if we would like more. He can then let the support that is helping the floor grab it so the cook doesn't leave the table so often.  - Think about having the server know the meats, and mention it when they are cooking. This way the table knows they are getting exactly what they ordered, and chances of having to stop the meal to figure out what was lost wouldn't happen.",

She was very attentive and didn't make us feel uncomfortable like you might get as some places. The portion said 2-3 people, but we could have easily gotten away with 4 people and left full. We also got a side of the kimchi fried rice with steak (because we thought the combo might not be enough). We couldn't finish it, but I would have licked that plate clean.  I'll for sure be back! Maybe next time with more people.",

    "text": "I visited two Korean bbq places one day apart and it was my first time at a Korean bbq. This was the second place I tried. This place was a lot more upscale. They had high quality meats here. The beef cuts were wagyu and very tender and flavorful. The side dishes were tasty. They had a bigger than usual drink menu that offered cocktails and wine and not just soju and beer. Be careful of your clothes though, because the grease splatters from the grill. My favorite thing was the cinnamon tea they brought out as dessert at the end. Overall I enjoyed this place more than the other Korean bbq place, but I don't think I'd have a craving for this. The atmosphere was cold. We were a group of 8 that had never tried Korean bbq before so we didn't know much about how the menu worked or what the side dishes were. We were asking a lot of questions, but the waitress didn't talk much or even try to explain anything. I only heard her talk when she said the meat was ready.",

The pork is cheaper than the beef but the amount is roughly the same. The smaller set can feed 2-3 people (or 3-4 females because of the sheer amount of side dishes). The larger set can feed about 4 to 5 people.   I think the only difference is whether your party is super hungry or is looking for quality. All you can eat won't have the best quality but it's a great option if you want to try different types of meat and Korean marinates. If you only want to eat a certain type and you want to get a better quality than a place like this restaurant is a better pick.  They have excellent staff and friendly hostess.

Meat quality is very good and there was tons of side dishes.  The servers cook for you all the way through for each meat in a prompt manner which was nice. With all the KBBQ restaurants on this side of town , this one is definitely up there (although I like Hobak a bit more due to better dessert selection and service).",

After searching and reading the reviews, we decided to try this place. At first we were skeptical since the place was close to empty. We learned that they are actually busy during lunch and dinner. This is not an all you can eat Korean bbq...just wanted to make that clear. We weren't sure what to get so we tried their beef platter. It comes with about 5 different kinds of meat. Each serving is about 4oz. When we got the meat, we were ready to order more thinking it wasn't enough. We were so wrong!! Jay was our server was awesome. He went above and beyond to take care of us so in return we took care of him too (by giving him a good tip). They serve so much ban chans that that alone made us half full already. The meat is of high quality. You can see it and taste it. We will be back for sure with our friends when we got back to Vegas. Best of all, they are open late on weekends.",

After cooking the Bulgogi at the table, the waiter asked my friend John if he did not like meat.  My friend said yes but was waiting for his pork dish.  The waiter had a duh expression on his face and finally remembered that my friend was supposed to get pork not Bulgogi. There are 1000's of restaurants to choose from. Next time I'll choose somewhere else.",

We continue to come here and the quality does not change...and service is always good.  We did come on Valentine's Day as well...they were very busy, but still managed to give us good service.  I would say that day wasn't a 10 (like all the other times), but they were very busy...and we didn't mind because the staff all looked very focused....they were trying.   Anyway...definitely recommend this place to everyone.  For us, we bring all of our visiting friends...pretty much the first recommendation we give to most asking about Korean BBQ.  Enjoy!!",

It was large, had good decor, a good atmosphere for a Korean bbq place, and most importantly - clean. They had traditional Korean tables in addition to booths and side rooms for larger parties.   We were a group of 17, and we ordered 3 Goong Special Platters. All of the meats included were excellent, especially the wagyu ribeye and the marinated prime short ribs. There was plenty of the meat to go around and the side dishes were good. The included soups that we selected as part of the order were very flavorful.   The service was excellent: friendly, accommodating, and attentive. While cooking, our server would indicate to us when the meats were medium-rare for those of us in the group that wanted the meats that way. As an added bonus for our large party, they gave us a free platter of meat sushi (slices of meat on top of rice) which was also very good. The meat sushi bonus was a nice touch and much appreciated by our party.   There was plenty of food for all us and the entire group all left Goong full and satisfied. I would definitely recommend Goong and most assuredly will be back.   4 1/2 Stars",

    "text": "Something new for Vegas as far as Korean BBQ! This isn't AYCE which means they are more focused on the quality of the meat. Now let me start by saying that you are paying more, but the quality definitely matches up! I have no complaints about that, but if you're looking at portion/quality vs price.. then it be a bit disappointing. The portion is a bit smaller than I thought it would be. When you order the combos it's only good for 2 good people at most. If you're a big eater.. you might not leave satisfied. You won't leave hungry, but you won't feel the full satisfaction. When I last came here they did not have the proper grill to cook briskets and the pork belly as the fire quickly burned the briskets. I'm sure they changed that by now. The bonchon(side dish) was good and the server was very attentive!   The seating is different as it's a bit more traditional Korean! You sit down which many people are not used to. In Korea it's normal for people to sit while they eat, so this was a nice experience for me.   I enjoyed the food and the service, but only see myself coming here if I have guests whom I want to take to a good quality BBQ spot. If I just wanna fulfill my usual Korean BBQ cravings I rather go to an AYCE and pay a little less for more although I may be sacrificing the quality.",

Three of us shared the beef platter, a series of 5 increasingly fatty, non-marinated cuts followed by Bulgogi.  Between the staff cooking the meat and you taking pieces when they're done to your liking, it works really well.  The first 5 cuts need some seasoning post-cook and you can choose from two flavored salts or a soy-based dipping sauce.  The quality of the beef was outstanding.  Second, the sides.  There's about a dozen or so little dishes that come with the platter and they're really, really good, and you can ask for seconds (maybe more) on the ones you like best. Great variety - kimchi, noodles, two salads, raw vegetables, pickled vegetables, radish and a bunch of others that were hard to figure out exactly what they were other than delicious.  Also with the beef platter comes a choice of soup - we got tofu and it was great - and four small pancakes that they cook prior to the beef.    All together, the beef platter for 2-3 with the sides and the soup could easily serve 4 adults.  The staff are very helpful and attentive and the interior is clean and mid-2000 modern.  Overall, a great dining experience and a fantastic Korean BBQ joint.",

    "text": "We came here last Sunday at around 3pm and we were basically the only customers at that time. We ordered the beef combo and it was enough food for us. The interior of the restaurant looks amazing and the dishes/bowls that they use here are very nice too. However I find it very odd that they use those disposable chopsticks despite how nice other things are.   The girl server was very nice and attentive. She asked us which meat we would prefer to grill first and let us eat at our own pace. However halfway through our meal they switched to a guy server and service started to go downhill. He didn't ask us which meat we wanted to grill first and he was grilling everything very fast and we felt rushed. There were like two table eating in the entire restaurant so I don't understand the need for him to rush us out. Overall food tasted just okay/average/almost at the level you get at ayce places. I have tasted much better Korean bbq elsewhere.   Now comes the worst part...I started to feel extremely sick at around 10-11pm that day. I had really bad watery diarrhea the entire night and had been throwing up until 4am. I felt really weak the next day and had to miss school. I had many exams that week and all I can say is I don't think i performed as well as I hoped. The diarrhea lasted around 3 days.  I'm pretty sure I got food poisoning from this place because that's the only meal I ate that day.",

The Goong set platter comes with a mixture of wagging and prime beef, marinated pork and even black tiger shrimp.   We also had a few of the cold noodle dishes which were awesome.  JunHee was a great server. Food was out quick and our water and tea were always filled.   The price definitely justifies the quality of the product.

Our server was extremely helpful in explaining the menu though, so it's not a big deal. We had floor seating where you take off your shoes. Comfy cushions and it's not difficult to get in or out of the tables.   We ordered the wagyu beef platter. It's supposed to be for 2-3 people, but I would say it could feed more like 4. The platter came with a ton of different sides: kimchi, onion salad, green salad, black beans, squid, seafood pancake, tiny little pancake that had jalapenos, radish, eggplants, soup, and more that I can't recall. Then there was the beef with a large variety of cuts. Two types of seasoning to use and the usual soy sauce to accompany the food. We also had Korean wine, which was so tasty!   Service was amazing. They helped us cook our food as needed, and we're generally amazing. The manager came to talk with us after our meal, which I thought was so great. The the price was amazing. About $140 for everything; beef, sides, and many drinks. I will definitely be coming back soon!",

The place feels a little fancy but I think it was actually rather \"affordable\". We got one of the meat combos, it was 85 dollars came with a bunch of really awesome looking meats and sides. It says it feeds 4 to 5 people, we we're 3 and a baby and  we all left happy and satisfied. It's different than other Korean BBQs I've been to, they put the meats on the grill for you and like come by and flip them and tell you when they are ready. Took me a sec to get used to that, but honestly the meats were all cooked better than when we've done it on our own haha. I felt like the service is super super attentive. The only thing is, they didnt give us like empty plates to like put the meats on when they are done. I feel like we were supposed to eat them off the grill, but they give you a million sides and apps and salads ( not complaining) and then the meats and they cool them one by one so we kinda felt like rushed a lil bit. I have a baby so I am pretty accupied a lil bit to like hurry up and eat the meats, and at one point they told us our meats were getting burnt haha. But we asked for plates and got them and problem was solved and it was smooth sailing after that. And they have soda by the can and even their tea was canned or bottled and I hate that at any place. But they do give you ice water in cute little cups and this awesome cinnamon tea at the end of your meal. This place was great in both food and service. We will totes be back. Really happy we tried this place. Super super yummy.",

    "text": "\"Enjoy when you can, and endure when you must.\" - Johann Wolfgang von Goethe  This is one of my favorite spots in Vegas for KBBQ. This isn't AYCE and you pay more for the better quality... But the fact that you're actually getting decent quality cuts of meat instead of the utter crap that is rampant at your standard KBBQ restaurant is well worth it.   My love and I came in with Philip T. and Ayumi K. to share a feast of meat and a surprisingly wonderful assortment of banchan...after all, who doesn't love a feast of meat with wonderful sides? The four of us shared the Goong Special Platter that consisted of wagyu ribeye, wagyu top sirloin, wagyu chuck flat, prime boneless short rib, prime flat iron, pork belly, pork jowl, marinated prime short ribs, black tiger shrimp, and a choice of soup for $145. The meat portions were hearty, and It was more than enough food due to the ample and delightfully tasty banchan. Not a brad price per person with four of us...though if you aren't keen on enjoying great banchan side dishes the meat-centric individuals may only want to split this serving three ways.  Our server cooked the meats for us...he was attentive and accommodated our cooking temperatures nearly all of time. The hoods were good, minimizing the notion upon walking out that you just bathed in Korean BBQ...a huge plus! We shared a couple bottles of wine and still walked away at a reasonable price for the four of us.",

For two and to experience the right things you're going to need to spend in between $100-150 depending on what you're looking to eat.   Now the food here is really good from service to quality.the meat is cut to order by their in house butchers that you can watch if you want. My wife and I usually the Wagyu package and we'll add some kalbi as well.   The only reason I'm giving it a 4 star rating is the portion to price. I love eating here but I feel like I'm not getting enough portion of meat for the price. Because it's like it's so good but you feel teased when you find that cut you like. I think if he portion was a little more I would definitely come back more often. But you can tell that the quality of meat is awesome.",

Though this is not an AYCE KBBQ place, they do have platters: Pork Platter for $42 for 2-3 people, Beef platter for $65 for 2-3 people. I eat for 2 people all the time anyway so, the platter options were perfect. Our tables was covered in small plates of ban chan: kim chee, squid, potato salad, chives, salad, noodles, fish cakes, pickled radish, broccoli, carrots, and other veggies.  Beef Platter: Prime rib eye, wagyu top sirloin, prime chuck flat, prime flat iron, thinly sliced prime brisket, and marinated thinly sliced rib eye. It also comes with mushrooms. The cuts of beef were tender. They'll give you a side of sauce and two kinds of salt so you can flavor your meats accordingly to your own preference. It's a lot of food.  It's a nicer KBBQ restaurant and not uber casual. You can get a regular table if you're not doing KBBQ, a tatami-esque area, or a table with a grill. The service is good. Attentive without being annoying.",

Went in on Memorial Day and was able to get seated immediately.  Ordered the beef combination (serves 2-3)  The meat was fresh and they cook everything for you. Only complaint would be with the bulgogi being overly sweet....the dipping sauce was weak, but the quality of the food made up for it.  Banchan on banchan, it was great. Both types of kimchi were aged and there was something for everyone, even if you are a picky eater.  The service wasn't bad. Always different people checking on the food and you. Overall for the cost/quality....it was on the pricier side.",

The restaurant is spacious, clean and boasts a modern design infused with traditional Korean decorative touches. This is NOT cheap or a place akin to AYCE joints, so I would not recommend if you are on a budget. Another complaint I saw was that the servers are \"overly involved\" in terms of cooking the meat. I appreciate that because it alleviates the smoke, improperly cooked meat, oh-crap moments where they have to run over to a table and douse it in water. It makes for a relaxing, semi interactive experience.  They have an extensive beverage menu and we always opt for Chum Chubum Soju because I love anything that tastes like peach. It is reasonably priced at $12 for a bottle and it is more than enough between the two of us. We opt for the Beef Combination Platter ($65) which includes prime rib eye, wagyu top sirloin, prime chuck flat, prime flat iron, thinly sliced prime brisket and marinated thinly sliced rib eye. The banchan is pretty standard consisting of kimchi, spicy radish, soybean sprout, Oi Muchim (spicy cucumber salad), watercress namul, fried tofu, etc. One most certainly gets their money's worth, but make sure to come hungry! I have always found the service to be consistent, courteous and accommodating. I also don't mind the extra hand in helping cook my meat to perfection.",

Except the salads 2 types, it wasn't good. I'm NOT into cold and sour bland soup, I find it weird tasting.. it's like drinking sour water, and every restaurant I go to they serve that and I would tell them I don't want it...

I have been here a few times and I can say Goong definitely has the best quality of any of the Korean BBQ restaurants I've been to in town.  They always have a nice variety of side dishes and their entrees are reasonably priced.  They have a few platters for parties of 2-3 or more which are great.  I especially enjoy the Beef Platter.  It's $65 and servers 2-3 people.  They have a pork one as well which is $45.    The downfall to this restaurant and for my experience is the aggressiveness of the servers.  Each time I've been here with my Korean friend the servers will rip the utensil out of her hand when she is flipping the meat.  At any other restaurant they let you cook it however one time when we came here the server even said something as she was clearly upset that he kept taking the tongs from her.  Today we had only been seated for a few minutes and we were asked 3 times if we were ready to order.  We clearly were not.    If the interpersonal skills were better this place would be top knotch.",

A different section, the Marinated Barbecue section, had one line explanations in Hangul. This inconsistency troubled me.  Before we decided on our order, the busman who seemed very happy with his job was cleaning the table opposite ours. Each platter he emptied out and replaced in his cart produced a loud, obnoxious clunk. Perhaps this means the hardware is of good quality.  We attempted to order lunch specials, but because we were dining on Sunday afternoon, we could not order the Monday through Friday lunch specials. Instead, we ordered the beef short rib (kalbi) and bulgogi from the normal menu.  Because Goong is a normal Korean BBQ restaurant without an all you can eat menu, comparing volume is USUALLY out of the question. However, this only holds True when the a la carte location provides quality tiers above the smorgasbord option.  The appetizers came in plenty, as I expected. However, I did not expect to receive five different types of radishes, accounting for more than half the plates. My sub claims the kimchi was good. I dislike chili so I didn't try it. We agreed despite coming in spicy, shaved, sour, pickled, and grated varieties, the different forms of radish did not fulfill our appetizer demands. The remaining appetizers included spicy toufu, sesame oil noodle (I forget the name,) salt and pepper salad, and some kind of mashed potatoes. I expected something including fish or egg, but nothing of the sort arrived.  The white rice came in a small bowl. I remembered seeing \"Extra Rice ... 2\" on the menu, and my heart sinking at the thought. The meat also came in small, but reasonable amounts. You are paying about eight or nine times as much for the meat here as you are at the supermarkets down the street, but they marinated it for you and included a lot of appet...radish. They will also turn the grill on for you, place the meat on it for you, and repeatedly come to turn the meats over and cut it into bite size pieces for you, even if you have gigantic mouths and prefer five times the bite size they cut, like me. They will turn the grill off for you before the meat is well done.  The bulgogi was ... bulgogi. The marinade was fairly weak, but tastable. The meat quality was good, a little bit better than Honey Pig. The kalbi was an interesting cut--unlike the multi-bone with bone fragment hell you get any other place you order kalbi, it was one rib, and the slices of meat above it. The marinade was ... almost absent, but I THINK it was marinated in something. Perhaps it was just the remaining drip from the bulgogi, I am not sure.  At this stage of the meal, we were slowly becoming radish, when I ran out of rice. My heart sank as it remembered the number two and my eyes tried to justify its connection to the small bowl of rice, but luckily the radish across from me let me have the remaining rice. With it, I managed to finish off the meats to perfect my meat-radish balance.  In the end, there is no reason not to drive the extra miles to go to Honey Pig and eat slightly lower quality food (with better selection and, last I checked, 24 hour operation) and get more satisfaction for your pennies.  I will next try Doh down the street, no matter what Yelp says about it.  We paid the check, and on the way out I greeted the hostess with a prominent and thankful \"Xiexie!\" and left, never to return.",

    "text": "After a long Saturday of working, running errands & shopping. We decided to try out Goong because I had it bookmarked for awhile and heard about it through my Korean friends.  Upon entering the restaraunt we were greeted with a warm \"ann-yeong-hasayo,\" Hello in Korean and slight bow. First impression was the formality of the staff and the ambience of the restaraunt. It was very modern and classy compared to other Korean restaraunts in the valley. Seating arrangement was a cool aspect of Goong, allowing you to enjoy a meal on the floor with more of a traditional flare or the option of being seated at regular table. Our server for the evening was, Jun. He was very friendly and knowledgeable with the menu. His service left a lasting impression on us. If you ever get the chance to try this place out. I reccomend him as a server.   Now on to the food, this is was something we were not accustomed to since most of our experience with Korean BBQ is usually AYCE, with the exception of Hobak which is why I haven't got around to writing a review for Hobak yet. The reason is because I wanted to compare 2 of the most popular Korean BBQ restaraunts in Vegas.   We opted for the Beef Platter which was good for 2-3ppl. From the very first pieces to the end was simply delicious. The quality of each meat was seasoned just right especially the Bulgogi. However I really enjoy the Prime Flat Iron and Prime Rib Eye. Those cuts of meat were juicy and flavorful especially when paired with the dipping sauce that was provided. The variety of banchan(side dishes) were fresh and delicious. We also got the Kimchi Fried Rice and that was very good with a perfect balance of spices and heat.   Overall we had great time! By far the best Korean Restaraunt in Las Vegas!  / Thank You Jun and the staff of Goong for a cool experience!",

From the pickled onion to the Kim chi and everything in between. The real star however is the meat. My wife and I got the beef platter and every cut was absolutely outstanding. The quality of the meat is top notch, and our waiter Jun cooked all of it to perfection. If you're in the area you HAVE TO stop in. I know I will be in here as often as my wallet and waistline will permit.   PS. Seriously, Jun is the f#@&ing man. Best service I've had in a while to go with the great food.",

The remaining 3 shares the beef package for 2-3 people.   All the banchan were tasty and went well with the meats. The meats included wagyu, but it was just as exceptional as the other cuts of meats. I'd have to say though, the quality and taste is above and beyond many other KBBQ in town. I'd have to say this takes 2nd best in Korean BBQ in Sin City for me. (Hobak #1).   We came for lunch and were among only a few customers there at that hour. Service was good. We will definitely be returning and referring friends to this place.",

Recently, we took my mother in law and other family to Goong. Just 6 of us in all.   Bottom line; They were busy and didn't have enough staff to cover, so the Manager acted as our Server for the evening. Very noble, but besides giving very poor service, he added 20% to our check for a tip, based on 6 people at the table.  The European tradition adopted by our American culture is to put 15-18% for a party of 8 or more.   Though we may have given a 20% tip for service or tradition, this gentleman, who comes from the Korean culture, where tipping is very rare, had no business deciding this on his own.  The food is still good and it is a real hassel parking in that busy center. I can't say the food disappointed. However, the fact that the Manager had the nerve to insure that he \"pocket\" a 20% tip, is reason enough for me to stop going to this place.  Why 2 stars and not 1 star?  I figured if I make it 1 star, readers will think I was just out for revenge. 2 stars, might get people to think about what I wrote, and know if they still go there, \"they were warned\".",

They were friendly and attentive enough but also there were not many customers in the restaurant.  Food: food was good. Again not great. They did not explain anything that came with the meal. They bring out at least 6-8 bowls of different things inside and don't tell you what's what. Unless you've eaten Korean BBQ before you would have no idea what they are in those bowls.  Price: pretty comparable to other Korean BBQ restaurants in town. Maybe a bit pricier but it is worth it for where and how the restaurant looks.  Cleanliness: extremely clean again compared to other Korean BBQ restaurants in town that I have been to.  Quality: is good. Could provide a bit more meat for what you pay for but overall it's tasty.

It's hard to drink if you're not used to it. They have a full drink menu with beer, wine, shoju, and more.  DINING: Their portions are a little smaller than other restaurants and they do not have all you can eat. Their meat is very low quality and very tough to chew. They serve everything with the small Korean side dishes. I like this place because they give a lot of side dishes.Their menu is pretty full with all your favorite Korean bbq dishes so everyone is sure to have something they will enjoy. Super excited that this place has the short rib and dikon soup because it is a rare dish to find. Everything is honestly over-priced here.  DESSERTS: mochi mochi mochi!!!",

But we where directed to sit in a booth off to the side, there was only two of us. We went in around 2pm place was empty but food was so good and service was too. We order the prime rib, tenderloin, and the brisket.  We got every side in the world it felt like and the server described everything very well!  She also cooked all the meat for us which was nice, and the meat looked so beautiful before cooked like super fresh.  After the food was done and we had finished eating she brought out some cinnamon tea, to help digest all the food she said, it was so good! And I don't really like tea so I was surprised! Our total before tip was $44 which was very reasonable considering we had a ton of really good food! We will be back!",

We had a 6:30pm reservation, and still waited for 35 minutes before someone offered us drinks or to take our order or even say hello to us. This was our first time dining here and were looking forward to it. Manager was right by our table and didn't even acknowledge us the whole time. We were celebrating 2 birthdays so this was not a good impression. We ordered the Goong Special Platter. It was very good. Some of the waitresses were great cooking for us and most seemed in a hurry to do it. My elderly mother wanted to sit at the end (birthday celebrant) and didn't know how to cook the meat properly. She also asked for warm water and waited a long while for it; 30-40 minutes. So we asked for it again. A kind waitress brought one over. All I suggest is that the staff be more friendly. Most people didn't smile at all and were not friendly. Food was good, service needs lots of improvement. Might come back, might not. It is a nice restaurant. We usually go to Soyo down the street, which is more casual, and the food & service there are pretty good.",

I had to flag them to even get water then after 10 minutes later I flagged her so we can get a menu so we can order our food, priced stupidly high and the quality of the meat did not look great.

    "text": "Several months earlier, my department head at work brought me and a couple coworkers to Goong over lunch, and I remember the food here was awesome, so I decided to take my wife here. The place is very clean, and well designed around Korean culture. In the center of the restaurant, they have tables raised just off the floor. We were seated on the outer edge, at the tables for 4, and these are placed at normal height (for Americans). They played american music, and the young Korean staff could be heard singing along quietly from our table. They were in very good spirits. My wife and I ordered the marinated beef, chicken, and pork dinner for two. I also ordered a Hite beer, and they brought out a large bottle of beer, which was like 22 ounces I think. My wife ordered the Korean raspberry wine, of which she gave me a taste, and was delicious. They brought out several sides, among which were Korean glass noodles, to dried radish, and kimchi (which I love), seafood soup, mixed veggies (with its own dipping sauce that was sweet and hot) and dipping sauces for the meats, and a few others that I can't remember the names of. Your table gets literally full of little side dishes. And you're picking off these while the meat is cooking. The staff cooks the meat for you, (probably for health code reasons) so they are frequently at your table. They cook the meats on a grill that comes up through the center of your table. They even change the grill halfway through the dinner so we had a fresh one when they started the chicken. The service was above expectations, and we were never wondering where a person is if we needed anything. The food itself was absolutely phenomenal. They nailed the marinades on each of the meats. The sides were all delicious as well, even though we both had our favorites. At the very end of the meal, they brought out two cinnamon teas in tiny little cups. Just enough to taste, but not too much because you are so full from the meal that you can't drink the whole thing, which you will be. There was so much meat that by the time we got to the last pork protein, we could not eat another bite. The staff reassured us that this is normal, and boxed up the remaining items. The price was just over $90 for my wife and me, and honestly I expected it to be more considering the sheer volume of food we got. I remember we were saying that we could have easily had brought two more people with us to eat everything that they brought out. I would rate this among the most exceptional dining experiences we've had in the Vegas valley, and we will definitely be going again.",

There are many varieties of the side dish but none of them was really memorable. I would recommend this place if you want a quick lunch and lots of side plates but I wouldn't recommend it if you're looking for bold and different flavors",

I walk in and was surprised to find shoes on the side of almost ground level tables and customers sitting crossed legged, which is the traditional Korean style of eating. I sat at one of the side booths. Immediately we were told that it was not all you can eat. So we ordered the beef platter combo for a hefty $65. The side dishes, common with Korean food, was simply phenomenal. They served about 15 and literally covered our entire table. You also get a soup of choice. The meat choices were amazing! Flat iron steak, pork belly, thin brisket, etc, were all so tender and delicious that you forget about it not being all u can eat and delight in the high quality and service. I mean, someone made sure to turn our meats on the grill and even let us know when it was ready to eat. One would think you were at Benihana with your very own chef. Excellent, excellent, excellent service!!",

But the way they cook the meat, its just that I've been to many many korean bbq places already and its hard when you're cooking an dthen all of a sudden they'll butt in and grab the thing so they can flip the meat. Its just that im not used to this kind and its pricey too. They have good side dishes tho. The salad is yummy, i love the raddish. Its just the meat isnt enough and they keep coming back and fourth on our table and just flipping the meat while we were cooking. But over all, i guess its a fine restaurant. Good quality of meat too. :)",

It took a good 5 mins before a server noticed that we are just sitting down patiently with our menu closed- no drinks or food yet.  But the server made up for it during her service the rest of the night.   Food is tasty. Good selection.  We got the marinated Meats and a side order of scallops.  The meat quality is not as close as Hobak or 8 oz but closed enough.  The serving is more compared to those two places and cheaper too.   I would go back and hope the server is more attentive when the customer gets seated. FYI. They have a cool sunken seats- didn't get to seat there.",

We shared the Goong Special Platter - Waygu everything, short ribs, shrimp.  Incredibly tender but not pre-marinated so not as flavorful as I like.  Unlike Hobak, Goong seems to focus more on the sides (13 in total) and less on the meat.  I'm typically looking for the meat sweats when I have Korean BBQ.    Service was attentive, if not overly friendly. My only real complaint is that there is no ambiance. It's very antiseptic, like eating in a fluorescent-lit cafeteria.  We had a group of 7 and reserved a booth so we could have back support. If you don't wear orthotics, you might be interested in the cute little tables you sit around cross-legged and perhaps the ambiance is a little better over there.  If you are in the neighborhood, Goong is worth a trip.",

This fufu-modern Jap-Korean bbq spot is the bomb.  The chic layout is definitely a plus as you walk in.   They have benches with cute pillows you can relax on Japanese style or you can ask for the a nice booth seating.  They wait staff are very attentive and super nice.  I love how they cook for you to ensure meat is not overcooked.  We ordered the beef bbq platter (it looks small but it's a lot), Pork belly, sirloin and green tea and strawberry ice cream mochi.  The barrage of side dishes was a lot and they even gave three rice bowls.  I didnt think it was a lot but for $133 it was a steal.  They even offered a cinnamon green tea sweet drink on the house.  The experience was fun especially the clubby music they were playing but not that loud that you had to scream at each other.  The lighting was bright that you didn't have to squint while searching for cooked meat.  The meat was fresh and clean.  Nothing looked old or marinated to the point that you couldn't tell if the meat was fresh.  Overall it was a great filling experience.  I would highly recommend this place to any foodie.  Be forewarned it is still a Korean bbq spot.  So don't wear your nice clothes that you don't want to smell like meat for weeks.  I don't just endorse spots for freebies.  So come down to this beautiful strip of stores and eat S Rainbows legit good eats.  Location is CLEAN, PROFESSIONAL. ORGANIZED Staff are COURTEOUS, FRIENDLY, CALMING, PROFESSIONAL Parking lot is SHARED but SPACIOUS Restrooms DID NOT GO IN Food WAS AMAZEBALLS!  * Boomsauce scale. BW = Dis $@% is BASURA! (Garbage). Not recommended. BS = it's just O.K. (experience) BS+ = Yo! I like this place. BS++= That's Whoa! This place good. BS+++= Dayumm! This place is fkn DOPE!",

Extra sides were gladly provided as well on request.   Ambiance  Fairly standard Korean BBQ place, though they have some unique tables where you take off your shoes and sit on cushions (we tried this). It sounds odd but was actually comfy. If you do this, though, get a table on the end. If you're in the middle there's nowhere to rest your back. That looked not so comfy.   Food You can order packages of assorted meats or al la carte (we did this as we wanted kalbi which didn't seem to be in the packages). They bring tons of amazing sides first as is Korean tradition. Then they come prepare the meat for you. We had a spicy pork and kalbi. Both were very good though kalbi was not quite as tender as we would've liked. Generally the meat seemed of good quality. We noticed \"martinis\" on the menu in assorted flavors for $6. Seemed like a good deal, so we tried a peach and a grapefruit. They tasted like juice. I don't think there was booze in them at all. Well, they were delicious juices anyway.   Mojo  Overall a good Korean BBQ establishment with quality meat and good service and unique seating options. If you go, ask if the martini has booze in it before you order :)",

I'm sure the quality of the meat in the combos is significantly higher, but still this meal was tasty I appreciated the cold japchae dish and the radish Kim chi as well. The barley tea here is absolutely the best I've ever had in Vegas.",

But tucked away in Southwest Vegas is one of my new favorite spots for good quality and service joints for when you want to take on the meat sweats!  Goong has been around for awhile now but I finally was able to try it with some friends this month after hearing pretty good things about it. We opted for the premium set for 5 people and boy oh boy, it is A LOT OF FOOD!   You have your wide array of ban chan side dishes including kim chee, bean sprouts, side salads and you get to choose what kind of soups you want to accompany your meal. But the meat is where the meal really shines. It's great quality and flavor meat, much better than many of the places I've tried on Spring Mountain. I particularly really enjoyed the short rib.   The staff was always proactive about changing out our grill and moving us along in our meal without the feeling of rushing us out.  Yes, it is a tad on the pricier end but you certainly get what you pay for!",

We never had to cook our food at our table. We ordered the $65 pork and beef combination for 3 people and it was perfect. The quality and taste of the meats were excellent.  We loved the side dishes because it was a delicious variety.  Compared to Hobak which doesn't always cook your food, Magal which doesn't always cook your food, and Gen which has poor quality food, Goong is our favorite AYCE Korean BBQ in Vegas. No added charges at the end unless it's for drinks is the best part of the dining experience.",

We ordered the marinated short ribs and bibimbap. Since we only ordered one dish they cooked it in the kitchen. To cook it at your table you have to order 2 or more dishes.  Cooking it in the kitchen is the way to go. I liked it better then at the table. My wife had the lychee martini and she said it was the best.  The side Kim Chee dishes are delicious and very authentic. If you want to experience great Korean food and great service, this is the place.",

    "text": "Goong Korean BBQ - Las Vegas (2017 Yelp Review #250)  The southwest is blowing up big time.  Goong Korean BBQ is a great alternative to Chinatown's busy KBBQ joints.  The food at Goong KBBQ is fabulous and there's never a wait.  All meats are cooked by the staff (not you) and everything is awesome.  Their marinated sliced rib eye, prime brisket, and the Wagyu top sirloin ranks as my favorites.  If it's just me and Terri, we're almost always ordering the Beef Platter ($65 serves 2-3).  We recently dined here for dinner and because we had a pork lover with us, we got the Beef & Pork Platter ($85 serves 4-5).  The entire meal was awesome and a ton of ban chan also came with the meal.  Other highlights include their fish cakes, the seafood pancake, and of course, the steamed egg. The BBQ is not AYCE, but the servings of meat is generous enough to fill up your belly.",

Quite so very easy to conversation  3. Very kind of all staffs I met today  4. WOW free 10 over side dishes  5. Prices are reasonable    6. taste of Bulgogi ( kinds of beef and most common BBQ in South Korea)  is so so but the price is only $11.00 per one person.   7. Interior is so nice and looks over moderate -class   Recommend this restaurant?    ABSOLUTELY !   I could rate 5 stars if I tried other dish because my friend ate Kalbi  and he liked it very much.

Possibly the only thing I didn't like was the table space to the plates per cover ratio considering they do give a ton of appetizers. Other than that, it was a nice experience with great selection of higher quality Korean dishes. As a 3x visitor to Korea, this place reminds me of a lot of the nicer joints over there.

The beef platter filled 3 adults and 2 kids and the price was not bad at all. I highly recommend getting a platter because it gives you a little of everything and fills you up.

The quality of the meats and the side dishes is the best I've seen at a Korean BBQ. We ordered the beef platter for $65, which came with 6 different meats (prime rib eye, wagu top sirloin, prime chuck flat, prime flat iron, thinly slicked prime brisket, and marinated thinly slicked ribeye). The meats were fresh and extremely tender. They meats were served with about 20 different side dishes and rice. They also cook the meats for you, which was a first for me. I actually like that, but it might be against concept of Korean BBQ, where you have to cook your own meats. We also ordered peach soju, my fiance really enjoyed it. I'd say if you are out on a date night then I'd order. Your lady would love it. Overall this is the best Korean BBQ experience I've had in Vegas. It's little on the pricey side and its not AYCE, but it's quality make up for the cost.",

    "text": "Goong was very impressive. I have tried about a dozen Korean BBQ. Even done a spread or two at home. The parking is a bit tricky so car pool or park by the dentist office and get your steps in. The atmosphere was fun and stylish. Each seating area had lots of room with big tables which is so important when eating this style of food. We were greeted instantly and all the server's were very attentive. We went for dinner. I like to cook it myself and I had great conversation with each server that tried to help. I ordered the marinated meat combo and each flavor was better than the last. It may seem expensive but they serve you so much food. Totally worth it. The spicy chicken was a maranade of greatness. They make Lychee Beer and all there own sauces and kimchi. I cannot wait to go back for lunch to try cold soba and shabu.",

    "text": "Take away: A place you'll share with friends.   1. Ambiance: I always start how a place makes me feel when I walk in and the first thing you'll notice is that it's beautiful. Rainbow Blvd has become Vegas' hotspot for Asian concepts and Goong has set a new bar. If you're from Vegas, you've come to accept the mini-mall as our neighborhood landscape. Used to be that when you have relatives or friends visit, you'd bring them to the Strip. Seriously, options have swung open. You can tell design is important to Goong--I'll take my wife to a date, co-workers for lunch, even client meetings and won't be embarrassed. It's buttoned up, these guys are good. Check out the details, there's a lot of great nuances from signage, photographs, sculptures, mirrors...  2. Food:  There were 4 adults with us, and ordered the Goong Special ($145) which had so much good stuff with 9 meat items and plethora of wholesome side dishes. We had smiles and waving white flags after the meal. It just tasted so fresh. If you're gonna just have one thing, get the PRIME SHORT RIB (wow). Take a walk down the middle of the restaurant, you'll see the butcher actually slicing the meats. The quality is unlike any other Korean place in Vegas--even have the meat displayed and labeled--very proud to show you how fresh the meat looks. On the display when I was there was Rib Eye, Top Sirloin, and Chuck Flat--all of them Wagyu.  3. Service:  Servers looked very smart with black unis. Just enough attention and polite when you ask them for things. One of my pet peeves is timing as in when plates need to be removed (hate having empty plates just meandering) and given this is a Korean restaurant with countless of plates on the table, they did a good job.   ----------------------------------------------  Listen up restauranteurs wanting to enter Rainbow Blvd--Goong should be your model as it challenges what a restaurant in \"local\" Vegas should be. You seriously can turn your place to something the community can be proud of and as Goong is in mine, they'll be seeing me a lot.",

I felt it was best to order the beef platter if it's your first time, therefore the next time you go, you can actually pick and decide what meats you want. In my opinion I thinks it's best to do it that way. The atmosphere and ambience expiernce is by far superb in my books. Friendly staff. Always checking in on you.Big plus was the rice paper. A lot of Vegas Korean bbq places don't have that. Side dishes were also good. At first I thought it wouldn't be enough meat for 2 people. I was wrong, lol. I'm definitely going back there again.",

However, in my opinion the meat tasted bland.   Maybe it's just me but I love marinated meat. Our server asked how we liked our meat cooked and of course we said medium rare. Our first batch of me the server put on the grill was over cooked. So then for all the other meats we kept a closer eye.   Then they changed the grill for our bulgogi and a lot of that got stuck on the grill. Maybe they need to grease it a little?  This is a nice restaurant however I wouldn't come back here. The AYCE place next to Monta is better and way cheaper.",

    "text": "Las Vegas has seemingly always had buffets, and the norm for Korean BBQ has similarly been all you can eat. Fortunately, we now have multiple high-quality, non-AYCE KBBQ options including this one.  Goong Korean BBQ Restaurant is one of perhaps a triumvirate of (relatively) pricey, premium meat restaurants. Normally, I write about other businesses vaguely, but I'm going to refer to other restaurants by name, especially because I intend to draw some comparisons/contrasts with one of them in particular: Hobak. I have eaten there multiple times. I have not yet tried 8 Oz, the newest kid on the block. I have also eaten at Magal, which I consider to be a lower tier option and which i've only tried once, so I won't talk about them.  Perhaps the best part of the visit was how we were seated immediately at around 6:15pm on a Sunday night. Hobak always seems to have a long wait. The interior here is welcoming and feels more \"traditional\" in a way than that faux-street feel at Hobak. I also like the lantern-esque light covers with red and blue colors seemingly lifted straight from South Korea's flag. I'm told that those represent the ancient balancing forces of yin and yang.  Anyway, let's move on to the food. Rather than order a la carte, my two friends and I split a Marinated Meat Combination Platter ($65). We could've gone pricier, but we had a feeling that this would satiate our appetites, and it did. The meats did indeed all come marinated, but none of them tasted cheap - except perhaps the chicken, but nobody goes to KBBQ to eat chicken, right? Prime boneless short rib was highly marbled and easily tasted the best, but the thinly sliced rib eye, pork ribs, and pork outside skirt were delicious as well. Oh, and an employee cooked all of those for us. One difference from Hobak: no charcoal for added smoky flavor. Fortunately, I didn't miss that so much.  The combo comes with a steamed egg bowl and a choice of soup (one bowl). The steamed egg was as fluffy as hoped and was ideally salted. Our choice of soup was soft tofu (aka soondubu) and our protein choice for that was seafood. I can't remember tasting a cleaner broth in this type of soup before, which let the seafood flavors come out and play. The calamari was al dente but easily chewed apart, and the shrimp was cooked properly too. The tofu was soft. Surprisingly, this was my favorite soondubu in memory.  Side dishes were good if not great. I won't go all of through the banchan in detail because they were so numerous, but they all tasted fresh - y'know, crunchy when it was supposed to be and all that jazz. Seafood cakes (warmed on the grill) were quite good. The pink pickled daikon was surprisingly sweet. The japchae was great. The creamy dressing on the individual salads was not as heavy as anticipated.  Complimentary \"dessert\" was a cool (temperature-wise) bowl of cinnamon tea. It had some balanced sweetness and tasted like cinnamon, and it was surprisingly refreshing. (They do have options for ice cream and such if you're in the mood.)  Despite my initial concerns about cost, I'm glad that I finally heeded Desyree's advice (yes, that Desyree) and visited Goong. It impressed me with service, flavors, and relative affordability. I can't really pick a favorite between this and Hobak just yet, so if you haven't tried either of them, then try both.",

    "text": "One of my favourite things about this place is the generosity and variety of little dishes that swiftly arrive at the table right after you place the order. They change them up a bit from week to week (so you'll never get bored) but they keep the crowd pleasers like japchae (glass noodles with aromatics and vegetables), pickled radishes, kimchi (a tad crispy, with perfect balance of spices), banchan (blanched spinach with a touch of garlic, soy sauce and sesame oil). So every time there's a room for delight and surprise yet your favs are all there as well. And ofcause, you can ask for a re-fill of the dish you just can't get enough of)   The meats (pork belly, wagyu beef, rib eye, spicy chicken) are always marinated to perfection, so I would highly recommend to order them. The bigger the group of people you are with, the better, as you will be able to try more kinds of dishes.   We usually visit Goong for lunch, so parking or lack of tables is never an issue.   Prices are great, service is swift, selection of music is sometimes quite unusual, but who cared when the food is yummy, at least I don't.",

You have the option of the common tables with grills, floor seats where you have to off your shoes, and a separate area for larger groups.  In terms of the service, they were very friendly, knowledgeable and attentive to our needs.  We were greeted and seated immediately upon entering.    Menu has a wide variety of options.  Lunch was available (until 4pm) when we came in but we wanted to try one of the platters.  We ordered the beef platter and terms of the quantity it was more than enough for 3 people.  My favorite cuts were prime rib eye and marinated rib eye.  It also came with tons of sides which probably were the best I have ever had.   Parking might be an issue especially on a weekend because of the amount of spaces and restaurants located in the vicinity.  But if you go early I doubt it would be a problem.   Overall the service, food, and ambiance is excellent!  Can't wait to come back and try everything else on the menu.",

    "text": "I definitely like the atmosphere, it's very clean and open- lists of vents around the restaurant and even a fan blowing. The service is pretty decent the servers attend to your table, when ever possible. Upon arrival we were seated accordingly, but it seemed in an area where the server had to many tables to handle, but he did try his best. Luckily someone stepped in to help out.  Now on to the food- they are very generous on the sides. Although it was missing a few of my favorites, they did have some new ones to try.  Now onto the important part, the meat! Now this is why I gave my 3 stars, the portions were very small, we ordered the beef combo- that was suppose to be for 2-3 It was more like 2 people, the brisket was so skimpy that I had to ask is that suppose to be for two? The guy assured me it was 8oz, I was thrown back with 8oz?  Maybe I am so use to other bbq spots being more generous on portions. The actual restaurant called 8ounce literally has more and that place is portioned at 8ounce.  I was a little upset, since this is my favorite dish to eat. All in all the service and sides would not make me come back- the set price for the combination is over priced and I'm leaving this place still hungry. My other minus of a star is that my kid was not acknowledged properly.  No dessert for him, as the adults get to drink cinnamon tea while he watches. The server didn't even want to give him a placemat It's the little things that count for a kid friendly establishment  I just feel that they don't accommodate much on their dining experience  Overall if you want a lunch portion for dinner, then this is your place.",

    "text": "I've been going here for a while, so it's time to write a review....  First, this is not a review of Korean BBQ. If you don't know what Korean BBQ is, I refer you to <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.koreanbbq.com&s=aa921a5b1f27a3c044c2ac3fbe3915afc34ea2222d2a1c926422548221ffc522\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">koreanbbq.com</a> or something.  I'm torn about writing a review - because I really like this place, and I can always get a seat. On the one hand, I don't want it to get too crowded; but I also don't want it to go under for lack of business. So the best thing you can do if my review persuades you, is to go, but go when I'm not there. Like for breakfast, or after 1 am.  This is not All-You-Can-Eat-Then-Feel-Disgusted-But-Rationalize-By-Telling-Yourself-You-Saved-Money. For that, go to Tofu Hut on Spring Mountain.  Going is spacious, always sweater-weather cool, quiet, and generally pleasant.   We always get the meat special, and add an order of beef tongue and marinated bulgogi. The quality of the meat is superb.   Banchan: it's banchan heaven. Great choices, always slightly different, with frequent refills if you want. The only thing is the conventional salad is just that - very conventional. That's made up by the other choices, particularly the rice noodles and kimchee.  Service is great. They always seem to remember us and our preferences without being creepy or judgemental (Olive Garden, looking at you with your \"oh, having the AYCE salad, pasta, and breadsticks AGAIN! aren't you\"). They'll help you burn your meat if you want, or let you make carbon all by yourself.",

But I'll go on, while we were waiting I could clearly see 4-5 tables opened. So why were we waiting ?  Why didn't the host or manager inform us why we weren't being seated like its normal to have customers waiting? The food was good but they need to do a better job at customer service.  The server brought us a soup , we assumed that the soup came with what we ordered, but then the server told the soup back after we already eat out of it, hopefully they didn't give it to another table because that would be gross.",

We ordered the beef platter and all the meat was so juicy and flavorful. Their quality beats all of the other kbbq place I've tried. I've never had so many banchan besides here.  Service was amazing and quick. EXCEPT there is this one Korean male worker in his about late twenties who gave us attitude when we wanted to use a different grill instead of the black grill because we wanted the meat to taste better. But besides that, service was great. The setting is very high status Korean status. You take off your shoes before sitting down. Music is moderate. Make sure to check in on Yelp for free vanilla ice cream or soda.",

My family of 6 came in for lunch and ordered 5 orders of brisket, 2 bulgogi, 2 marinated short rib and 6 bowls of rice along with a few sodas.  **BTW The portions for happy hour are reduced!!!  Which equals out to the same price for regular portion BTW**  The reason why we enjoy coming here normally is because they cook for you. Or at least do some or most of the cooking but that's not the case anymore. They don't care about you at all! You have to flag them down constantly.  I understand for all you can eat Korean bbq they do not cook for you. But this establishment is NOT all you can eat. Plus they were not busy!! This place is NEVER busy compared to the rest of the Korean bbq places in the vicinity.  So I don't understand why they would stop cooking or assisting you in the cooking.  Plus now they've significantly reduced the amount of side dishes that they used to put out. No more onion salad. No more beans. No more different kinds of pickled radishes. The salad they do put out is such a tiny amount that a single person can literally pick it up and place on their plate and it's done. So you have to flag them down again and request more salad. I honestly don't see this place lasting for much longer. It's been a good ride tho but I do not recommend this place to my colleagues anymore. I just recommend them to the all you can eat places down the street since the service is the same if not better.",

We just so happen to frequent SOYO and Oyshi so why not try the awesome looking Goong restaurant as well, right?  Well, we were not disappointed! The food was amazing. We ordered two orders of Galbi, Wagyu plate, and their bulgolgi fried rice! The quality of the meat was very impressive and pricing was quite fair.  The atmosphere of this restaurant is really laid back. They have sections where you actually remove your shoes to eat. Super cute, but we were seated on the side instead. We also weren't in the mood to cook our own meals so we asked if they could prepare it for us in the kitchen instead. They did so without hesitation which I thought was kinda cool.  I also gave their white peach martini a try and had my boyfriend order their apple martini, which I really enjoyed because it was sweet and not very strong. They weren't in martini glasses so I found that kind of odd, but still good nonetheless.  I highly recommend this place!",

    "text": "First time here! Literally typing this review in while having a server cook me KBBQ. :D They start off with a plethora of side dishes - the usual kimchi, radish, two different salads, japchae, potato salad etc. You can choose to sit at a booth or the traditional style tables where you sit down on a pillow with no shoes on. They use 2 different grills depending in how the meat is seasoned. Definitely like the array of quality meats they have here - I ordered the Beef & Pork Platter - and I'm in love with their brisket! I am usually not impressed with pork belly in most kbbq places, but Goong surprisingly had theirs rather juicy and moist without seasoning. Service is definitely on point, most of the servers were generally male and cooked all the meat in a prompt and proper fashion. It was a nice touch having green tea salt as one of the seasonings, I really liked that as I am a fan of anything green tea lol. My friend also noticed that they were playing instrumentals from the Spirited Away soundtrack in the background, which really made my night as it gave a nice bonus to the neutral but grounded ambiance they had at Goong. :) Will definitely come again with friends and family! They'll be serving ice cream next week so for those with a sweet tooth check it out!",

    "text": "Decided to come here for dinner and arrived around 7pm and we got seated immediately. There was a choice between sitting at a booth or korean style seating. We decided to go with the Korean style where you have to take off your shoes and sit on a large blue pillow.  1. Food: Decided to go with the prime rib eye, beef tongue, and thinly sliced brisket - all of which was delicious. The way the meat is presented has to be the best I've seen in a Korean BBQ place. Banchan (side dishes) consisted of 14 dishes. Instead of water, they provide barley tea - loved it! The meat can be small in portions and on the expensive side, however the quality is makes up for it. In the middle of the restaurant there's even a little window where you can see the butchers cut and plate the meat.  2. Service: Everyone had all black uniforms, which makes the place look professional - then I noticed they were wearing croc style shoes which I thought were no bueno. LOL  The servers were very attentive and always checked up on us. They even cook the food for you, but sometimes I would prefer to cook it myself. They were very polite and got whatever I asked for in a timely manner. Every plate of banchan was explained to us, and they also asked which meat we wanted to eat next.   3. Ambiance: The decor in there is very charming. There are sculptures, golden masks on the wall, photographs, and mirrors. There are a lot of little details around the restaurant that shows they care about appearance. The music in there wasn't too loud or too quiet, but we weren't able to hear it once more people started coming in.  I feel that you get what you pay for at this place - although the bill can end up being expensive, so be careful of what you order and the prices!",

My most recent visit was last week.  The server was rushed, the grill was never changed, and the quality of the food was average. My family and I will not be returning.  It actually saddens me.  I am a big fan of Korean BBQ, and I thought I had found a good quality restaurant close to my house.",

When you enter the restaurant they give you the option to sit in a normal booth or in their traditional tables where you have to take your shoes off and dine on the floor. Their menu is pretty extensive. However, they have preset menus that can feed 4-6 people. I think the preset menus were the best options as you get a pretty good variety of meats. We ordered the Goong special which includes wagyu rib eye, wagyu sirloin, prime short ribs, wagyu chuck flat, marinated prime short ribs, black tiger shrimp and a lot of Korean sides. The quality of the meat is evident. The taste of the wagyu meat was very good. I especially liked the rib eye and the marinated prime short ribs. The service was just ok, the service was kind of slow and not very efficient. Also we had to be constantly asking to refill our side dishes as they were never offered to us. Overall, a good restaurant if you wanna have good quality meat and a great atmosphere.",

Some of he most extensive banchan in the game with soups per person and about a dozen small plates including a few radishes and a few kimchi offerings.  Though they charge extra for refills, as an FYI. We had the marinated meat platter ($65) which included 2 porks, 2 beers and a chicken. Couple that with about 5 sojus and the meal was tasty. However, on a Saturday night it was unbelievably dead. With that said, our servers had nothing to do yet we're still a little angry with us as we were eating a little slow to their taste and it was ruin the cooking preparation.  And we got last call way too early and were rushed out. Finally, they offer free ice cream with a Yelp review, but they stand over your shoulder as you write it which artificially inflates the review.  Overall a good Korean BBQ but not the best, or cheapest, by any means in the city.",

We ordered just the marinated, thinly sliced ribeye and galbi shortrib entrees, and even my elderly mom (who doesn't each much) complained that it was barely enough to satisfy her hunger. The $20 galbi (1 bone and some small chunks) was a little tough to chew, and the $13 ribeye bulgogi tasted a little too salty. The service was also slower than expected, and we had to quiet our grumbling stomachs with the banchan dishes because it took almost 30 minutes for the kitchen to make our 2 simple meat orders! We sat on the booth side because we didn't feel like doing the table cooking, but on hindsight, we probably could've had our meals ready sooner if we had cooked it ourselves. Neither the food nor the service was worth the total on the bill.  I only went there for lunch, and I'm wondering if the better quality meats are being saved for dinner. Too bad I'm not interested in trying this place again.",

The cold barley tea wasn't for me but the table next to us wondered where they could buy it. We ordered the beef platter $65 which is 6 courses of beef and we added the shrimp $12-15. Everything was amazing, even the many side dishes. Kimchi fried rice was spicy but a delicious platter.   4 stars due to the service. We arrived at opening, 11:30 with a reservation. It was our first time in and we were the second family through the door. We weren't offered any menu suggestions or even drinks. I finally had to stand to get attention to order. My husband insisted we leave like another table had as it had been 20 minutes with still no service. I counted 8 tables, most with the same issue. As the huge family of 6 left the only server on the floor stared the family down. Quite rude and unprofessional in my opinion.   We will be back but we do highly suggest that if your charging good money (our bill was $97 before tip) you don't cheapen the experience with no staff. The entire two hours we were there we received no refills and asked for extra side dishes that never came. Two tables for this environment should receive one server. Two people for the entire place is ridiculous.",

We ordered the beef and pork platter and it came with enough food to more than satisfy 3 people. They will have ice cream as a dessert option in the near future which we were able to sample with our review. It actually has a surprisingly fresh and rich French vanilla taste and has good creamy consistency for a house made dessert, I was impressed.  The wagyu and bulgogi was the most tender imo off the meat selection, and being able to get a larger platter to try a variety of selections makes the experience more fun and enjoyable; something I highly recommend.  I have to say this place was moderately priced and pretty good in terms of quality and service.. Deserving my 4 star recommendation. Kahhhmn sahhmnii dahh",

    "text": "Restaurants all over the place throw around the words \"wagyu\" and \"Kobe\" these days and it confuses consumers.  It gives the False idea that some rural farmer in Japan prepared this majestic, gently massaged, beer-fed cow specifically for their plate.  Because of the lack of uniform rules on beef labeling, this happens regularly with zero repercussions to them.  They can say anything they want!  You think video poker bars in Vegas really have authentic wagyu beef in the form of sliders ready to be served at 2am for $10?  It's a name that catches the eye and allows them to charge more.  Just like \"super white tuna\".    American tastes have come a long way from when lean meats were king.  They currently take a backseat to pork belly, the \"more white than red\" beef and even chicken thigh.  I didn't ask about the origins of Goong's product, or if they had any concrete proof that it was truly wagyu, but their quality is clearly a step above the standard Vegas KBBQ and that makes it worth going to in my book.    To shorten time perusing the menu for our party of 5, the Goong special at $145 was the easiest way to sample it all.  This included a nice selection from pork jowl to prime flat iron to wagyu top sirloin.  The ribeye and short rib were my personal favorites and met all my criteria for great grilled beef, which is FJT (fatty, juicy, tender).  I enjoy a little blood, so no piece stayed on the grill for long.  I am normally not very sensitive about service (perhaps all those Chinese restaurants I went to growing up dulled my senses), but the rushed, stop-go service left something to be desired.  I'd prefer the servers either put the meat on the grill and see it through to its completion, or leave us alone to do it all.  There was one point where a gentleman placed a nice looking piece over the fire, asked my friend if she liked her beef cooked \"medium\", she responded \"yes\" and then he proceeded to walk away from the table!  What did that mean? Was he coming back to flip it or leaving that up to us?  Should we just put more on the grill when we're done?  They make such an effort to present the meat so royally with the thick, uniform, labeled cuts in a classy and quiet dining atmosphere; it's a shame that this was the problem.  They were also more reactive than proactive when it came to refilling banchan as we always had to ask about getting something instead of them noticing the empty bowl and asking if we wanted more.  That's all fixable though.        Constantly losing track of which cuts were being eaten, which I blame on attempting to be social (ha), made some of the meat feel a little less special.  \"Wait.  What cut is this again?\" was said numerous times.  Maybe I need flashing lights that say the name of the meat.  Regardless, I'll be back here to satisfy my fix of good marbled beef. 3.6511111 stars.",

    "text": "Let's see high reviews again and I jump on any new Korean restaurant so of course I had to come here. After having really good Korean food in LA I promised to never eat Korean in Vegas so I don't get disappointed. But this place has pretty good quality in comparison to other Korean restaurants in Vegas.   First of all my hubby and I came here and we're the only customers. Later 3 tables got filled up but service was pretty good at first.   Ok who goes to Korean BBQ for the salad? But really I appreciate a good salad with my food. They brought us two salads. One is excellent and I got many refills. One I didn't touch which had bottled dressing that I did not care for. It was more of an American salad look to it. I liked the variety in the banchan and overall it seemed fresh. I didn't particularly like the little patties, potato salad was good but I try to avoid carbs and stick to salad. Japchae was good.  I found the carrot sticks and I think it was cucumber with red pepper sauce odd (their take on buffalo wings' carrots and celery with ranch?)  On to the meat. We got the combo which it said is for 3 people. It didn't have all the meats I wanted to try but we figured since it's our first time we will try the combo. The majority of the meats were good,not amazing but the portion did seem small of how much of each they give. It ended up filling us up so it was fine. I thought the way the meat was served was cute and in theory sounded good but it didn't end up working too well then labels were removed and they put more than one meat on the grill (some were the same size) and so it was hard to differentiate between the meats and I had to ask waiters a few times which meat was what.   I like the high ceilings, the non existent smoke filled rooms that usually KBBQ has, the modern look. It definitely sparked my interest enough to return and order a la carte next time.   Although it does not compare to LA I think it's pretty good for Vegas. I want to try it again before making my final verdict.  I did have a little issue which is the same at all Korean restaurants- do I cook or does the waiter? They start off cooking then it's me then it's me waiting \"Are they coming back? Do we just do it ourselves?\" are questions commonly asked. I don't want to offend them but I don't want my meat overcooked!",

We had just come from another Korean bbq restaurant in the same block who also refused to move the tables so we could all sit together- even tho they had moved two tables together for another group who were there.

I ordered the set menu for 3 - 4 and also ordered the marinated samgyeopsal. I am so proud and impressed with my girls - we demolished every thing in front of our faces.

Thus why I am torn.  The decor is fresh and modern but due to the design of the restaurant it feels claustrophobic. The wall next to our table did not allow us to see around the restaurant. The seat did not allow you to sit close to the table or to the back of the booth.  The menu was difficult at best. Most of it was in Hungul and the lettering was very small. Due to the dark lighting and small print, we had to forgo the menu and ask questions of the server.   The waitress was pretty new and needed to ask others about the menu. She also was having difficulty with the table grill.   We decided on being safe and order Bulgogi. Typically a Korean meal is served with a stainless bowl filled with rice, and 8-12 \"side dishes\". This meal was served with four (4) small side dishes; Kimchee, glass noodles, fish cakes, and potato salad.  The Bulgogi was cooked at the table - by the server - and was average in grade of meat and flavor.   As we're new to the area and are looking to make up our new \"Go To\" list of restaurants, we will be continuing our quest. This did not make the list for us.",

Lots of vegetables and meat in large portions. The rice on the bottom wasn't overly crispy that you can't chew. I'd like to try their BBQ if I come back with more than 2 people.   The interior design is fancy. Comfortable seats and everything looks super clean.",

    "text": "This might just be my new favorite Korean bbq spot in town. The space is divided into a traditional and non-traditional area. I recommend dining in the traditional area, but you might want to skip out on this if you need back support or have stinky feet (although the bbq will most likely take care of that smell).  Their menu is not AYCE, but the meat and banchan quality definitely reflect on the money that you pay. In the end, the price difference isn't too large for better quality food IMO. It looks like they have a number of lunch combos and combo platters for 2-3 people for $65. We ended up going for the beef & pork platter for $85 meant for 4-5 people, but splitting amongst 3 guys. It was well worth it.  First, I have to acknowledge that this place has one of the best banchan offerings I've had. We got all of my favorites including one steamed egg, soft tofu stew, and a cold kimchi soup to share. We also got fish cake, japchae, kimchi, pickled radish for wraps, kimchi radish, unlimited dollar coin-sized pancakes, mashed potatoes, greens, green salad, onion salad, and one large pancake to share.  The progression of meats starts with light and becomes heavier in flavor as the dinner goes on. They do all the cooking while you sit back and eat. We started with the prime brisket, prime ribeye, wagyu top sirloin, prime chuck flat, wagyu short plate, pork belly, to finally the bulgogi, and the spicy marinated pork. We finished dinner with a cold cinnamon drink, which was nice.   Service was very fast and attentive. Will definitely be back for some more!",

    "text": "Definitely one of the best spots for modern korean bbq in town. Quality of the prime beef cuts and the pork are outrageously good and absolutely delicious. They have two sets of tables where you can sit traditionally without shoes, and tables at regular height for dining.   I absolutely love the combos they have here for the meat plates because of the variation. There are a lot of side dishes (banchan) to eat alongside all the primary dishes/entrees.   The seafood options are unique from other places in town for kbbq and everything here feels, tastes, and looks fresh to order. I love the overall experience when I am here because service standards and food quality standards all check out.   Thank you Goong team for a wonderful dining experience time after time!",

A couple of defining characteristics: floor seats (kind of like enclosed floor booths), they cook the meat for you as opposed to you cooking the meat yourself, none of the meat is frozen. We were a group of 6 and we decided on the premium bundle instead of choosing a la carte, and had many cuts of well marbled non-marinated meat. That along with the banchan served and complimentary cinnamon tea (good for digestion perhaps?), we left perfectly full for about $165 which was truly reasonable!",

I had my doubts because the waiter brought out some food that I don't consider normal and then came the rib eye, steak, chicken, etc.   If this is your first time doing KBBQ let the waiter know and they will cook/turn the meat for you, and they are cool with you asking questions.  I asked him \"What's that\" like 10+ times.  If you aren't a n00b like me, you can cook your food over the grill.  My buddy ordered the meat platter, and everything turned out to be excellent.  The marinated meat to some of the sides, and the ambiance.  The parking in the lot is hectic for some reason so you might have to park a little ways from the entrance.   I don't usually try new stuff because I'm stubborn, but I'm glad I did.  This place was a good first experience, and I look forward to coming back.",

    "text": "Came here last night for my brother's graduation party and it started out pretty rough but rebounded quickly.  We had reservations for 8 at 4 and when we arrived they told us we didn't.  They eventually found our reservation (for two sets of 4, since each table seats 4) and we got in, 10 minutes later.  We had 6 menus between us and when my father asked for more, the waitress took my sisters and gave it to him...but then I asked for two more and two were brought out.    We ordered our food, the two biggest things on the menu and the appetizers started coming out and filling our table which is cool because of the variety but the lack of space on the table was annoying.  As she was bringing out the side dishes, she spilled some sauce all over my brother's shoe and then just left it there until like 15 minutes later she got a napkin and put it on the floor over the spill (never picking it up over the course of the whole meal).  She then offered to clean my brother's shoe, again after about 20 minutes.  She took it and cleaned it which was nice but didn't do the best of jobs.  My sister also never got her apple soju she ordered.  I also feel like pop should have free refills instead of $2/can.    Now, on to the food.  The side dishes were plentiful and some of them were indeed good but there was also a fair amount that were just ehh but I blame that on my lack of knowledge of Korean food and how little I've had of it.  The meat started coming out and it looked incredible.  Marbling was perfect, size was plentiful, and unlike some Korean BBQ places, the waitresses at Goong cook your food at your table for you so there's no guessing on when it is done.  The meats were amazing and just about erased my doubts about this place from the service.  They were spectacularly tender and melted in your mouth.  I loved the green salt that we had to add to it!   There was so much that our other table couldn't finish their food so the chefs cooked it up and packaged it to go for them which was awesome.  Even though the service started off pretty shaky, the quality of the ingredients and the fact that we didn't have to cook on a crappy, under-powered plate really brought this place miles ahead of other places in the valley (cough cough Gen).  I would gladly go back here because it was so darn tasty!  Maybe the service was ehh because we had a big group or because they only had one person sserving us even though the restaurant was dead or because she was just having an off day...idk but regardless, if you want some quality Korean BBQ, come here!",

I was surprised by how many awesome sides came with the combo meal. It was easily enough food for four.   The only problem was that the servers would repeatedly say they'd do something and then not do it, like take our water thing for a refill and then never refill it or never bring a fork for our chopstick-impaired diner. I just walked to the back and asked for it eventually because he legit has no clue how to use chopsticks, so his food was overcooking. No one seemed mad at me for doing this, but it made me feel like I was being disrespectful when I was just trying to get our water back/a fork.   However, as long as they're fine with me walking to the back counter, I'm down to come back. I hope they hire on maybe one more person so there can be an extra set of hands to make sure the tables are attended to. I also hope they get enough diners that they can afford an extra person because it's definitely a worthwhile spot in the southwest.",

My mother and I ordered the Beef Plater Combination (good for 2-3 people) which consisted of Prime Rib Eye, Wagyu Top Sirloin, Prime Chuck Flat, Prime Flat Iron, Thinly Sliced Prime Brisket, and Marinated Thinly Sliced Ribeye (bulgogi). This platter also came with a steamed egg and your choice of soup. The platter also came with a LOAD of sides, you can probably get full of them, but we paced ourselves to ensure we would be able to try everything.   Needless to say, everything was delicious! The quality of the meats were great! We ate our meal by each type of meat in order to appreciate each type of meat. Halfway through the meal, the grill was changed to cook the brisket and ribeye.   The staff top to bottom was great! There was always a different staff member serving our food, offering to cut or grill the meats, or accommodating any of our other requests. There was no one that gave us a bad experience.   There are many other dishes that give us lots of reason to come back, and my mom and I certainly will!",

They cook for you so you can really enjoy your meal. The meat quality is just so much better than the AYCE places and the side dishes or ( banchan) were delicious authentic and plentiful. First time we got the beef set for the three of us ( it's recommended for 2-3 people but the portion is quite large. There was a variety of meats including prime ribeye and filet mignon. Also included was a choice of soup .. Kimchi, bean paste or soft tofu. I've tried them all and all are delicious. You also get a steamed egg. I like how you don't have to stuff yourself because you can take home leftovers ( unlike AYCE ) I tend to totally overeat at those establishments thinking I have to get my money's worth. The food and service made my experiences here so much more enjoyable. Hope they keep up the quality. I will be a regular here I'm sure.",

I even called to confirm my reservation 1 hour before getting there and the host confirmed it.  When I arrived with my party of 13, there were no tables available as they made way for  a party of 60 (for a one year old's birthday party) that was made only 1 week in advance.  They could have called me to cancel or tried to find a way to accommodate both parties; instead, they abruptly cancelled my reservation and made my celebration a complete bust.  We had to take our party to a restaurant next door.  This rudeness and greediness  is why I won't go back there again.  They did NOTHING TO MAKE UP FOR THEIR CANCELLATION.  Completely rude and unable to communicate in English.  Don't go there with any large party; they can't service the group.",

The grill was not set high enough to sear the outside of the meat, instead it started dehydrating our meat! So our first & seconds sets of beef were extra dry! Tasted like beef jerky!! By the time we had the 3rd set of beef on the grill we finally turned up our grill ourselves. After all that I would say their beef is just okay. I personally would of liked my beef marinaded and or seasoned. We also ordered the grilled tiger prawns, it was ok.  The best tasting item here is probably the free jap Chae. Other than that I don't think I would be back! I'll rather drive the extra few miles down to spring mountain and eat at Hobak! I can't wait to try Magal BBQ soon!",

Service wasn't up to par and for some reason communication was hard with our server that night. In my opinion the place was a solid 3 stars, but there are better and cheaper KBBQ options around Las Vegas.",

Not sure if place settings were wrong or if you really need to ask for it, but we didn't have any napkins at our table or plates to put our food on to eat from nor did any of the 5 servers that helped us notified that. Thank goodness the food was good and that is why it's deterring me from giving it less stars. Beef tongue was amazing. Super tender. Marinated kalbi was pretty good as well, definitely on the fattier side though. Sirloin steak was very good! Make sure you cook it medium rare though. I wasn't too impressed with the pork jowl. Although it was tender and juicy, it was too thin and had too much fat on it. I prefer hobak's pork jowl. Loved how much banchan they had. Mul nengmyeon was a bigg portion. I liked how it stayed cold for so long. I would come back for it again. This place can definitely accommodate big and also private parties as well. Great place to come eat with friends and family.",

You are not going to find that anywhere else!!! What more can you ask for? This place is clean and my number one pet peeve good service. I give them 5 stars everyone who worked there was delightful and courageous. You can go to a place that has all you can eat and pay less, but seriously not the best fresh food!!! The best thing too is that they Cooked, the beef meat in one certain grill and for the brisket they used another clean different grill.Every other BBQ Korean place they use the same type of grill for all meats!

Our server seems like she's rushing everything and often almost seems irritable or uninterested about something. Who knows? Maybe she wants to go home early? I mean we actually thought we had to rush eating because they might be closing soon until other customers started showing up. She basically served all the meat without even telling us what exactly are we eating. So we often have to ask her what is on the grill throughout the whole service. She seems new though so that might be it. Everybody else here had been amazing though.",

Goong is SUPER clean, and totally appeals to my inner \"can you do that for me.\" (they do the grilling for you, which I like... let's me just focus on the eating and enjoying part). I also love the sides and dips (green salt... yes please).  Overall great service, great layout, great food!   Enjoy!",

I'm like ummm isn't this cook your own !?!  So he keeps coming back and putting  the meat.. I felt uncomfortable coz I feel he comes more than actual enjoying  the food and cooking.. the meat it maybe high quality of meat but who cares if u don't even enjoy it much.. besides if I wanted someone to cook ill go to regular restaurant ..   Overall I won't go back unless got invited by a friend ..   they should just let their costumer do their thing  or ask them if they would like help them cook ..          Not for me sorry",

With all the KBBQ restaurants in town, this one definitely stole the spotlight. I finally got the chance to try this place and upon entering, I was fascinated by their interior design from the layout to the decorations of sculptures, mirrored vents, high ceiling and etc. My friend and I came here for dinner around 7pm and there were a plenty of seating available. We had the option of sitting at a booth OR, the traditional Korean seating where you take off your shoes and sit on these large blue pillows. Of course we went with the traditional way to get the full experience!  Food: We weren't super hungry so we decided to order a la carte but they do have party platters recommended for the size of your group. We ordered the prime rib eye, beef tongue (x3) and thinly sliced brisket (x2). They serve 14 banchans (side dishes) naming each one as its being served and barley tea instead of water that is light with a hint of roasty flavor. I would drink this over water any day because it's so refreshing! Your dipping choices are green tea salt (my favorite out of the 3 and super delicious paired with meat), regular salt with pepper and a dark sauce. Some of the meat is served on a black slate which adds a unique touch. The meat portion is quite small and the price is on the pricier side but seeing the quality, color and cut of the meat is definitely worth it!  Service: Everyone was super friendly and attentive. The servers were patient and cook for you all the way through for each meat which was nice. Sometimes I just prefer to cook it myself so I can eat and chat since having them cook in between us gets kind of awkward. One thing to point out is that they don't serve us individual plates. After the meat was cooked, they move it to the side of the grill and we had no plates to hold the meat except eating off of the grill. There was also no napkins to be found. We were always checked up on except it gradually slowed when the dining area got busier which was understandable.   Overall, I enjoyed my experience here at Goong. It is a nice place to take friends and family to for the finer dining KBBQ experience than the typical places around Chinatown. I will come back and order the party platters next time to try out all the different kinds of meat they offer!",

And GOOD bonchon. The shrimp were HUGE. The short ribs were nothing short of amazing.  There are only a few options for combination platters so I could see it getting pricey if you wanted to add other meats to a combo- but you get what you pay for, right? The spicy tofu soup that came with our combo even came with a choice of meat- it was HEAVEN.   The manager and (I believe) the owner checked on us during dinner and even gave my kids a free dessert! I can't speak enough to the amazing customer service!",

We had one of the large combinations, beef and pork, and they served each of us a bowl of rice, and a bowl of marinated onions. We had 13 other side servings (I believe it was 13...it was a ton of food), along with our beef and pork. The cost for the entire thing was $85. That served 4-5 people, and yes, it was a great value and a ton of delicious food. The server grills your meat right at the table, and sets it to the side of the gill when it is done. Everything was top notch. And the staff couldn't have been more hospitable and attentive. You do have the option of sitting in a traditional booth, or removing your shoes and sitting on pillows on the floor. We chose the traditional booth setting. They serve Bori Cha (a traditional barely tea) so we didn't opt for anything else to drink. They also end the meal with a delicious cinnamon tea. There was no rush to our experience...everything was low key and considerate. We highly recommend Goong.",

    "text": "Was about to go Soyo when I passed this place and it caught my eye. After reading the reviews of this place, it seemed like a legit place for some good KBBQ. I didn't have expectations that it will surpass Kang Hodong in LA, but was expecting at least close in par with Hobak here in town. The bonchon was superb, they brought over 16 different items, and all of them more or less is very good. No complaints there. But unfortunately, that was actually the highlights of my time here.  We got the beef combo, which consist of 5 plates of meat. Each plate has a small amount, but the quantity even though not as much as Hobak, is more than enough for 2 and perhaps decent enough for even 3. The meat themselves all seemed high quality, they're all thinly sliced and looked fresh enough. However, it's not really about how good the meat is but it's how you cook it right? Out of my favorite places on the west coast, Kang Hodong in LA and Hobak in Vegas, they all cook for you, making sure you don't screw up the beautiful meat in the process. This place claimed to cook for you when I sat down, but they seem to leave for a long time after putting down the meat, and by the time they come back, the meat is already over cooked. It's not like it was crowded when I got there, there was only 1 other table at the time. I asked for medium rare, and the 1st 3 plates were all medium well to well done, which just in my experience ruin the reason to eat KBBQ.   Also, unlike most other KBBQ places, this place use unmarinated meats. Most places I've had unmarinated meats have to be absolutely superb to pull it off. I went to this place in Matsuzakagyu Yakiniku M in Osaka, and they pulled it off perfectly. I don't think you can pull unmarinated meats unless you have the perfect meats, otherwise you should just stick to marinated meats. Hobak does not pretend that they have the perfect meats, and even with imperfect meats they manage to pull off amazing tastes. They also do better soybean paste soup and the steamed eggs.   From the decor of this place, which mind you is VERY well done, to the unmarinated meats, to the service, I feel like this establishment is pretending to be something it's not. There's nothing that stands out either completely great or completely terrible about this place. However, I've definitely spent less money at other places for a more enjoyable KBBQ meal. It's a shame that my first experience wasn't a more satisfactory one, but I was certainly hoping it to surprise me. Perhaps my expectations were too high.",

The portions are on the small side.  Service is excellent. Kimchi and side dishes are good.  Atmosphere is great.  High ceilings and lots of room.  Like all Korean BBQ places, be ready to take a shower when you get home.  Happy Kimchi Friday.",

The portions are smaller but you get more side dishes. Their brand of Soju is not as good either. The wait staff speak English but there is a definite cultural gap if you try to have a conversation. We ordered their Beef & Pork Combo platter and some of the meat was grilled with no flavoring, leaving the customer to choose which flavor of salt or dipping sauce to use. Overall, the food was okay. Not great and not bad either. Just so so. I was excited since others on here said they were better than Hobak. I sadly found out last night that it was all lies!",

    "text": "My husband and I have never heard of Goong and recently just drove down the street and pulled up nearby restaurants on Yelp. When we saw the high star rating we decided to give it a try. We had a great time! The service was impeccable, everyone was courteous and friendly. The food was delicious! We ordered the Beef for 2 meal. When I asked what sides came with the meal the answer was 13. I was confused but decided to wait and see. Well, 13 was the accurate answer, we felt like a buffet had been brought to our table. There were two types of lettuce salads, kimchi, pickled radishes, mashed potato salad, papaya salad, steamed egg, two different soups, and several other things as well. Everything we were served was delicious and the cinnamon tea at the end of the meal is my husband's new favorite drink. We will definitely return.",

But we tried a few other Korean places around town and Goong is most likely our new go-to spot from now on. We ordered the beef combo, we weren't sure if it would be enough for the 3 of us, but the waiter said it should be. Man, when everything started coming it looked like enough for 5. Plenty of side dishes and the beef was excellent, we opted to have them cook it in the back instead of at the table. Either way, the food was excellent and even though we were full, I polished everything off because it was so good",

The atmosphere wasn't my favorite (a little bright and sterile) but the food was good. They went buck wild on the sides with what we ordered (the pork and beef combo) such that our table didn't even fit everything. They had to stack some items on the top of our booth backs. It was awesome! Everything was super fresh and delicious. My favorite was the ribeye and pork belly (as usual) and honestly the only I didn't like were the marinated meats that ended the meal. The marinated beef was sooo sweet and the marinated pork was so flavored you vouldnt even taste the meat. That's just personal preference though. When I go back (and I definitely will) j will opt out of those meats and double up on something else.   We had to ask for garlic and jalapenos and gochujang and sesame oil (again personal preference, but some places do bring it automatically) but they were more than happy to supply it.   Overall a good experience. It doesn't hold a candle to Donday and Yakiniku Seoul in Waikiki but that's okay ;)",

Considered to be one of the city's more authentic experiences, shoes removed and decorative-pads provided for seating at one of several gas-fired grilltops, those arriving at Goong during lunch hours are likely to be struck by the tranquility of a space devoid of televisions or elaborate decorations, the clean lines complimented by a light soundtrack as servers provide menus and beverages while speaking in hushed tones.  Offering several lunch specials alongside the dinner menu, a la carte Meats as well as party-sized Combos offered alongside a variety of Soups and Rice plates, it was with both Korean and English descriptions that choices spread across several pages, the ordering deferred to others with some input as to a Rice Cake Soup and Pork Jowls that sounded particularly interesting.  Partially familiar with the format, a plethora of small bowls and plates quickly flooding the table prior to the first Meat selection, it was with small bites tasted of each Banchan that the palate was prepared for the flavors to follow, the Fish Cakes and Spicy Eggplant particularly memorable as makeshift appetizers while choices like the pickled Daikon, Onions and Soy Noodles were better utilized with the Proteins, or at least as palate cleansers between bites.  Turning focus now to the grill, a total of three Meats ordered with a second helping of Galbi proving far superior to the sinewy first round, those making their first visit to Goong would be well advised to order at least one plate of the thinly-sliced Chadolbagi that cooks through in under two-minutes as well as a Pork plate, the glass cases in back proudly displaying the sort of quality worth paying for as each is sliced to order in a nothing-to-hide way.  Not one for really hot stuff, even Goong's Kimchee a bit too heated if not taken with some rice, additional plates tasted included the Cold Buckwheat Noodle Salad served with Soy and lava-red Sauce as well as the comforting Dolsot Bibimbap, a large bowl of Tteok Manduguk presented last with Salt and Pepper by a server who all but admitted gauging his table's \"whiteness\" even though the overstuffed Dumplings in Beef Stock were already savory enough.  ***  An enjoyable meal as much for the company as for the food, Goong Korean BBQ proved a nice introduction to a new genre, though the service did feel slightly judgmental throughout the course of the afternoon while prices trend higher than would be anticipated for several of the dinner Rice Bowls, Soups and Casseroles.  Also, Mochi is not dessert...",

Love the many sides they give and the quality of the meat, this and Hobak definitely have the best meat quality in all of the Korean BBQ places and decent pricing too.   But I was so annoyed being there, to the point where I could not have a conversation with my friend. We had about 4 different servers taking care of us... you would think this is awesome and service should be beyond expectations..but no.   It was my first time there so I needed time to look over the menu, I asked the first server to give us some time, then 2 other servers came by wanting to take our order so we had to ask for more time again.   Then my friend wanted pictures of some of the dishes so we told one of the servers that we can cook the meat ourselves, she let us be but the other servers kept coming by asking us if we are sure we want to do it ourselves. Then my friend wanted to cut the pork belly before it was fully cooked so it can cook more quickly, but a server came by and rudely asked \"You cutting before its cooked?\" - then he took over with the meat and told us \"Don't cut ok?!\" ... Seriously?!? We asked to be left alone... and they keep coming over acting like we don't know how to grill meat. The same guy came back and keep cooking our meats and was putting meat that I did not want onto my plate so he can cook more meat...they kept coming over and being in our faces we had to stop our conversation every time they come by.   I get it that they are trying to give you good service, they are trying to cook the meat for us and its really nice of them... But they should let us be when we ASKED for it multiple times. My friend and I prefer to cook our own meat so we can eat at our own pace... these servers kept coming by and cooking meat continuously and we felt rushed to eat them all before they are over-cooked.   They really should not have too many people working the same table, and they clearly don't communicate with each other since we had to repeat ourselves multiple times. The staff here are way too aggressive...it is as if they get annoyed that you are cooking your own meat!   I really enjoyed the food, best meat quality and a great variety of side dishes. But when I have a meal, I like to be able to talk to my friends, I like to eat at my own pace and I generally like to be left alone so I could comfortably eat. This place is way too aggressive with their serving style and they are borderline rushing you to finish your meal and being rude.",

My wife is asking something about a dish on what's the difference between each presentation (different bowl) and he replied \"I just told you what's the difference!\" We'll, we are there for the first time and it's not our fault that he can't explain it better, he is the shortest of all the waiter! The others waiters are nice thou except for this short cocky little Asian guy! Planning to not even leave any top money but I feel sorry for the other waiters that are nice and tentative, I'm nice enough to not ask for the manager and complain when he replied to my wife rudely, wanted to try their food and don't want our food to be spit on! hence the 3 star",

Service: sorry to say but kind of slow  I had to ask for water three times, and we weren't approached for almost ten mins. But it was a busy day for Father's Day so understandable   Food: amazing! This is not a standard AYCE kbbq place.  You order a package, where it is priced at a certain amount, and they suggest how many people it feeds. You can also buy a plate of meats individually. The quality was so good, the meat was tender and tasty. A bit pricey, but the food will def meet your standards. Make sure to ask your server to bring a grill to put over the grill it already is set as, the oil kept popping up on me and hurt super bad until they brought out the extra grill",

We had the pleasure of having \"June\" as our waiter.. we arrived at the restaurant around 10:44pm and right away he asked if we're sure we want to dine there because we only have 15 minutes to order. We said yes of course.... They close at 11:30 Right when we get our food he starts rushing us to hurry so he could close us out, mind you it wasn't even 11 yet!  Then disappears to do closing duties while we're waiting for him to finish cooking the rest of our meal and turn the store back on... so we could leave.  THEN the worst of the worst happens, he puts the tongs he cooks RAW meat with in our salad... I asked him curiously if that's where it's suppose to go knowing that's disgusting. He then SHRUGS it off and asks if we want a new salad. I said no thank you, and he just leaves it on our table. We complained about the service, and feeling rushed out and asked to speak to a manager, he simply said he wasn't there and gave us the bill....  If I was employing this type of lazy service I would immediately fire them. Not only because he contaminated our food but when we complained he had no remorse he just wanted us out...",

    "text": "Came here with a friend on a Monday evening, easy to find, off of Rainbow and Robindale, behind Dairy Queen. New place i heard about recently like another on Spring Mtn.   Decor is amazing and quite different from any other KBBQ place in town. Very clean and open. I noticed they had those \"floor seats\" where you have to take off your shoes and put your legs in a hole areas for larger groups. Nice quiet ambiance. \"Older style\" hoods up in the air causing the smoke to NOT go in and get exhausted (rip)   Service was pretty immediate and friendly. Very attentive and they cook for you as well.   My friend wanted the pork platter so we had ordered that  Pork Platter ($42 - Good for 2-3 people) - Consists of Pork Belly, Pork Jowl, Marinated Pork Outside Skirt, and Spicy Marinated Thinly Sliced Pork  Combination platters come with steamed egg and a choice of soup (kimchi, doenjang [bean paste], or soft tofu)   Other combinations they have are  Beef Platter ($65 - Good for 2-3 people) - Consists of Prime Rib Eye, Wagyu Top Sirloin, Prime Chuck Flat, Prime Flat Iron, Thinly Sliced Prime Brisket, Marinated Thinly Sliced Ribeye  Beef & Pork Platter ($85 - Good for 4-5 people) Consists of Prime Rib Eye, Wagyu Top Sirloin, Prime Chuck Flat, Thinly Sliced Prime Brisket, Pork Belly, Spicy Marinated Thinly Sliced Pork, Marinated Thinly Sliced Rib Eye  Goong Special ($145 - Good for 4-5 people) Consists of Wagyu Rib Eye, Wagyu Top Sirloin, Prime Boneless Short Rib, Wagyu Chuck Flat, Prime Flat Iron, Pork Belly, Pork Jowl, Marinated Prime Short Ribs, Black Tiger Shrimp  They do have individual options too to order (BBQ, Marinated BBQ, various entrees,   First of all. TONS OF SIDE DISHES ! We were two people in a booth, we almost had our entire table covered in side dishes and what not. Didn't even have our own individual plate/bowl for eating. Lol xD Sliced pickled daikon, potato salad, onion salad in light sauce, jap chae, fish cake, romaine sesame oil dressed salad, black beans, spicy raw octopus, kimchi, chives, iceburg lettuce salad, and a plate of seaweed, carrot and cucumber sticks with a small bowl of gochujang. Each person also gets a dish of green tea salt and normal salt and pepper, and a dish of sauce  Like another place in town, i believe they have their own butchering to provide such a vast variety of meats AND be able to serve raw beef (one of their dishes consisting of julienned raw beef marinated with salt, garlic and sesame oil - needs to be super fresh meat to do this)  ------------------------------------------ they have different grills for different meats. Pork tends to be the flat metal plate vs Beef being a more open grate   Pork belly and pork jowl came out first and was cooked first. Service was very attentive that neither side were burnt and was flipped constantly. Pork especially with lots of fat tends to burn fast later on but none were. Beautifully cooked. Tender and juicy.   Marinated Pork Outside Skirt was nicely done. Not overly flavorful. Fairly light. Tender and juicy. Awkward various sizes on some pieces but im not too picky about that.   Spicy Marinated Thinly Sliced Pork is like the normal spicy pork but sliced thinner. Cooked fairly fast too.   ----------------------------------------- Service was very attentive. It was a slow night. If they can keep this up even when they are busy, that would be amazing  I did notice as we were leaving that one of the waiters were up and cleaning the hoods. I noticed how clean the bottom of the grill was prior to cooking. Maybe they clean each individual one after use? Would be nice if they cook uphold that AND keep it going.   Definitely would come back to try the beef.",

Our waiter was training a new server, we told both of them it's our guest first time, no explanation... nothing....  it was basically \"what do you want\" and that was it in the conversation... seriously THAT WAS IT...  even when I had questions about the menu... maybe you can have someone walk around and talk to tables, answer questions, help lead customers to a great dining experience.   (like a table host or something (or waiter/waitress), you are putting too much on your table staff and not enough people.  Btw im Korean...  and you should have a marinated meat package.

I was hesitant to go for dinner because the prices were high but I knew their meat was of superior quality. My boyfriend and I were extremely pleased more than we expected. The large amount of sides immediately made me happy. Their staff was very attentive and nice (which is not common for Asian restaurants) The staff cooked our meats according to our preferences and changed our grill when necessary. The grill heats up super fast too. (I am a bit impatient during grill changes but this was not a concern). I also liked the fact that I got to chose the type of soup we wanted. I love tofu soup and it was probably one of the most flavorful broth that I have ever had in Las Vegas.   I cannot say that they are better than Hobak because the experience was entirely different but both places are great.  (I might like this place better). It is very clean and welcoming, there are different areas depending on your group size and it is very well ventilated. We might have left smelling a little like kbbq but honestly, we could go out after leaving and people wouldn't know. I love this place.",

The parking is somewhat limited so you'll have to find parking elsewhere, if it's too packed.   Environment: everything inside was well organized.  Nothing too flashy.   Food and service: the food was pretty good for the price. We ordered the beef set and seafood pancake. The food came on time and was not over cooked or left to dry. The quality of beef was great for the price. The banchan served was good quality except the fish cake. A bit too soggy for me. But asides from that everything was made with good flavor.   Bathroom: clean and modern. Single stall with a urinal for the men and 2 stalls for the women's bathroom   Overall, surprisingly good food and service. I'm surprised it wasn't as busy for a weekend . Definitely a must go.",

There were four of us and we struggled to eat the whole thing! The Wagyu beef was great and tasty as well as the soup, salad and little side disges that come with it. They have two types of seating arrangements. One is the regular table in a booth and the  other is the more traditional style where you remove your shoes. You can sit or sit with your legs crossed.   The location is away from the strip that makes it less crowded but the place does get pretty busy.  I highly recommend this place and when you do please come with an empty stomach.",

We made a reservation in advance. Got there and they were going to sit us korean style when we requested booth when reserving 45 minutes prior. It was our first time there and it's pretty different from hawaii. We ordered the $145.00 meal with a variety of meats and shrimp. They didn't tell us that they cook or assist with cooking it so we started ourself - then a waiter came 20 mins later and asked if we wanted to cook it- when we were already cooking it.... with out oil or anything. We didn't know u use the slab of fat hidden under some other stuff on the tray... just over all shit experience.  Luckily the food was pretty good and the ambience is nice . Not mind blown but decent quality- Not impressed enough to come back.",

We came in one night about an hour and half before they were going to close.  There were about 3-4 tables.  Not so busy.  They had use wait about 10 minutes to setup a table.  When we got the table, it wasn't setup.  So they just had us wait for 10 minutes and then wait again for our table to setup while we were there.  Not sure why it doesn't seem like anyone wanted to take our table.  Took a while for someone to came and take our order.  I'm only thinking in my head, this place better be good, because service isn't here.  We didn't feel so welcome.  Finally they took our order and our order came out shortly after that.  Now all a sudden the staff comes and seem like they're rushing us eat.  Consistently cooking our meat when we haven't started eating the one on the grill.  I dislike people doing that, it makes people feel rush.  People like to enjoy their food and have a nice conversation.    Hobak or here.  I have to say Hobak.  There's just something about the service and the quality of meat they serve there.   We'll have to come back and try it again.  Might had been their off night.  =)",

We sat there for over ten minutes and no one greeted us. There were several workers surrounding us cleaning up for the night. Although they list longer hours, it appeared that they were ready to shut down. We got up and walked out and no one said anything. It was pretty apparent that they wanted us to leave.   Pro: We decided to give this place another shot and came in around 7PM. I am SO GLAD that we did. The quality of the food is incredible!! It is probably the highest quality Korean BBQ we have had in all of Vegas. The prices are well worth it! They insist on cooking the food for you as opposed to other Korean BBQ restaurants that allow you to do it yourself. Given that this is my fiance's favorite part of the experience, he asked if they would mind allowing him to cook it himself to which they said no problem. They did pop over every now and then to offer tips. They also wanted us to move faster than we were (not sure why) but we insisted that we wanted to take our time. Overall, the service was great and the food was delicious. Can't wait to return!!!",

I felt as if the quantity and quality of the meat was on point, but just an okay amount. I wished the staff told us that we can get refilled on specific side dishes, but only one small plate at a time. I mean having 2 small plates of Japchae at once would be nice, but just one to share amongst 4 - and continuous ask for refill is tedious. I'd wish they fix that rule, and informing the people eating.",

Our party was pretty slow with trying to figure out how to go about things like ordering and cooking since it was our first time here. At first the servers were great and friendly with helping us but then after putting the first selection of meat for us it went south. We tried to cook the first plate that came out since we were told by another server to finish so they can bring another plate out. So we tried to cook the meat but then another server was noticeably pissy  by our placement of the meat not being on the center of the grill which we didn't know it was a no-no. We've been to AYCE KBBQ places together before so we're used to just placing it wherever but there are just things you can say in a different tone to not show how peeved you are. Then we got the other plate and another server has to comment on us to move faster. By the time we finished we waited for the longest time, about over 45 minutes for our bill to come. This is after we helped the runner clean our table completely and it was the runner that I had to ask for the bill from or else we would've never gotten it. So much for helping and rushing us.",

    "text": "So sad to see this place turn to crap!  We've been going to Goong since it first opened and have always raved about the place. My husband and I have our date night one a month at Goong and we've always loved the food and the service. Well, the service is still good but the food has really gone downhill. For the last three times we've gone, slowly but surely they started eliminating some of the side dishes (namely the Korean potato salad and then the green papaya salad), then the meat portions started getting smaller and smaller, and finally, the quality of the meat was just awful on our last visit. We always order the Wagyu top sirloin and the tenderloin and they were terrible: fatty, gristled, really tough to chew.  We complained to our server who just smiled (yes, I said smiled) and did nothing to correct the problems.  She never offered to replace the bad meat, or offer us other side dishes, she just smiled and walked away.  Maybe a language issue????  Needless to say, we won't be back. Sorry Goong, three strikes and you're out.",

    "text": "We thought this restaurant looked great aesthetically, but after waiting 5 min to be seated (per their sign) and then waiting another 10 minutes to order I walked out of the restaurant. Two people who were seated across and sat down way after us got to order their food from someone we didn't even know was a waiter. (This supposed waiter gave us a complimentary beverage and that's it. This employee saw us waiting for a waiter and did nothing). That's when we walked out of the restaurant. I don't know if they were short staffed or what? Unprofessional!!!!!!!! I really wanted Korean food too. Never returning here. I'll stick with Sura, Honey pig and Gen instead. So for lunch we went to Omoide which is across from them and received professional and attentive service.",

The quality of meat is as good a high end steakhouse! It was busy when we walked in but were seated right away.  We had to wait a bit to place our order but that was ok because they were clearly busy.  The nice thing is everyone who walked by our table asked how we were doing and if we needed anything. Great service and awesome Korean BBQ.  We will be back.",

Would highly recommend.",

    "text": "Went to Goong last week.  It's a beautiful restaurant!  The quality of meat was great.  But when we first walked into the restaurant, we asked the host to seat our party at a regular table so that my husband's sore back could rest in a normal chair.  The host said ok, but continued to lead us to the traditional Korean tables saying that my husband could rest his back on the end booth of the traditional seating area.  He made us take off our shoes, as well, in order to sit in the traditional seating area.  Not wanting to be a downer to the party, we conceded.  However, the last thing I wanted to do right before I ate was touch my shoes.  Anyway, the wait staff was very nice and explained our cuts of meat.  However, I do not like having the waiters continuously interrupting our dinner conversations to explain the meat and cook it for us.  I prefer we cook it ourselves.  We will probably not go back.",
