    "text": "We ordered pizza (for delivery) from Streets on Sunday evening when the parents were over for Mother's Day.  I ordered 2 large 2 topping pizzas.  Total $46.00 - \"excuse me?\" I said.  *that was WITH a $5 off coupon. LOL  He explained that it was for 18 inch pizzas and asked if I wanted to do the 16 inch ones.  So yes 16 inches sounded much better where the total was $40.  Still a bit pricey for pizza I think but hey it fed 5 people so I guess you can't argue if you look at it that way.  They tacked on a hefty $3.00 delivery charge to that price by the way.  Pizza took a little over an hour to be delivered.  I guess there were a lot of Mothers not cooking on Mother's Day. hehe  The pizza was good... a little on the greasy side.  The crust was fresh and the toppings were good.  We ordered pepperoni with ricotta extra sauce and it was great.  I'm not a real fan of the taste of their ricotta-I have had better.  Their ricotta doesn't really melt so it seems a little dry. The other pizza was Hawaiian.  Nothing to complain about. My BF and I both agreed that their pizza has been better...not sure what it was.  Maybe we just weren't in the mood.  We have visited this place on several occasions.  The service is top notch.  They are on top of it and very organized.  The restaurant is located in this amazing little San Francisco style plaza.  The plaza itself is worth the visit.  We have also been to catered parties here with salad, pasta and pizza buffet style.  Great place to do a little get-together - say for 10 to 15 people.  The place isn't that big.  BTW the place is always packed on the weekends.  I believe they have outdoor seating but I have never seen anyone using it.  Probably because of the weather.  I think I like visiting the restaurant more than having the pizza delivered just for the New Yorker ambiance....but either experience is always a successful one..",

It was spot on!  My husband had their \"Broasted Chicken\" hands down the best fried chicken I have ever tasted. So tender, juicy and flavorful.   The Passion Cookie is to die for! Served straight from the oven. Big enough to share!  We live on the complete opposite side of town and will absolutely be making the drive back out for dinner!",

A better pizza in the area. (Sorry not the best) but good. I wish they had more choices in healthy options. The chicken strips good! The salad good! Chicken parm was ok... Meatball sub needed more kick but good",

I had been craving potato Skins for weeks and they just happened to be on special so I ordered that and a slice. Way too much food but totally worth it. The pizza has great flavor. The crust was seasoned with a garlic butter sauce that is absolutely amazing.  Service is very friendly and I can't wait to try the location closer to me. This specific Streets of New York is located in the cutest little area. Norman Rockwell lane,  I mean does it get cuter?   It was a little too cold when we went, but the patio looked nice.",

    "text": "I am always befuddled and perplexed when my review of a certain establishment is so much better or so much worse than the other reviews that my fellow Yelpers have posted, but in regards to Streets of New York I am compelled to tell all of my fellow Yelpers who posted reviews with anything less than four or five stars that with all due respect, you need to lay off of whatever type of intoxicant you are drinking and / or smoking because your judgement has been seriously impaired!!!!!   Now having said that, I will say that there have been times during one of my many visits when the service has been, how shall I say it, less than stellar. No worries, anybody who has read one of my reviews before knows that I could care less about the service at a food establishment if the food is good, and at the Streets of New York, the food is EXQUISITE!!!  Streets of New York is the real deal, everything is fresh with such a unique taste.   This is not one of those, \"insert generic pizza / pasta place name here\" type of places, no this is the real deal, if you are looking for a pizza place where everybody will be really, really nice to you, and fill your drink thirty six times, and draw a smiley face on your check go to pizza hut, if you want damn good food this is the place for you.  When you arrive you will notice the line, I guess that everybody who goes out to eat does not post reviews on Yelp, who knew, or should I say, how weird!?!?!? Some people, and based on the line or wait time at Streets of New York, I would have to say many people, just vote with their wallets.  When you get seated greet your server, I have always found not being a jerk helps improve the service, than order either the Baked Chicken Wings or the Chopped Antipasto Salad, NO WAIT, order both, you will regret it later if you don't.  I love chicken wings and these are great chicken wings, they will dress them in a sauce if you so request but in my ever so humble opinion the sauce just takes away from the taste of what may be one of the top ten best chicken wings in the United States.  Now the antipasto salad, I am a meat guy, I am all about the meat, so when I fell head over heals in love with this salad I thought we would have to rush my wife and best friend of twenty seven years to the hospital, thank God, False alarm. I do not have an adequate vocabulary to properly describe this salad so let me just say that it may be one of the tastiest, most mouth watering things I have ever ordered at a restaurant ............................. the antipasto salad is to die for!!!!!  So after you have completed savoring the delectable wings and the tantalizing antipasto salad as your appetizers, what can I say, I am a big eater, time to move on to the main course.  My wife is a fan of the Old World Meatball sub on the wheat bread, just a warning, this is a popular item and they often run out of the wheat bread.  Me, I am all about the pizza and the pizza here is very good, it is not my favorite pizza in the world, but as pizza goes, it is pretty damn good.  I could go on and on as I really enjoy this place if you have not already picked up on that but I have typed all that I care to type and it is time to close.  Go to Streets of New York and enjoy the food, if the service is less than awesome, shake it off like a big boy (or big girl) and remind yourself that you came for the food, not for counseling!!!!!!  Until next time my fellow Yelpers ............... Be Local, Live Local, and whenever you can ................. Buy Local!!!!!",

They decided it would be a great idea to wrap the garlic cheese bread with the cheese facing out and wrapped tightly so by the time I got it home (10 minutes away) the cheese had completely stuck to the aluminum foil. Not to mention the bread itself was only edible in the middle (the dogs wouldn't even eat it).  I was so excited to try this pizza because I'd read good reviews, but the reviewers obviously never had good pizza before. For almost $30 for a medium sausage & pepperoni pizza and two slices of garlic bread, I could have had a better pizza from Dominos.  The only reason I gave it one star is because it was ready quickly. Oh, and when I walked in it smelled like rotting fish. Never again...  This is the location on Norman Rockwell.",

    "text": "Pizza. Wings. Happy hour. Three things that, alone, bring a smile to the face of millions daily, and when combined, can leave even the most stoic of men in a state of euphoria.   This is what I experienced my first time at Streets of New York; a scintillating meal, a very tall glass of beer, and a price range that begged me to come back for more.   The pizza is thin, crispy, and that perfect amount of salt to let you know they're not slacking on the pepperoni. The wings were boneless and while the sauce wasn't as hot as I would like it was tasty---this is a place where I'd ask for sauce on the side instead of tossed, the sauce man is a bit too generous.   While I was initially disappointed that their happy hour beer was only Bud Light--even though the menu says domestic, insinuating that you have options---their large size is gargantuan and they have sam Adams so things worked out.   I'm someone who doesn't get caught up on service unless the restaurant is built around such things, but the waitresses seemed a tad apathetic. I never felt ignored seeing as I was the only person dining at the time, but the place held all the enthusiasm of a nursing home on xanax day.   While this was fantastic for me, seeing as how I enjoy a peaceful dining experience, I know alot of people enjoy a more lively and gregarious experience.",

There is a three-step plan to bliss. The plan is as follows  1: Artichoke Dip. (It's not perfect. There could be a few more crusty bread things to go with it, but I usually get delivery, and there are pretzel chips in my cupboard.) 2: Pizza. (Thin crust, pepperoni and other things, depending on mood.) 3: Passion Cookie. (They will bring the cookie hot, with a little tub of ice cream and toppings ice cold to your door. Because they are objectively wonderful people)  Eat until you begin to regret.  I've never been into the restaurant, but I've ordered delivery a lot. For 1, 2, and for a party with about 12 people who couldn't make up their minds. Everything always arrives quick, hot (or cold, if applicable) and delicious. It's a crowd pleasing sort of pizza.",

While we would go regularly and bring friends, each progressive visit has been more lackluster.  Wanted a sandwich tonight and usually can't go wrong even as a pickup .  Unfortunately, both orders were wrong despite having no business at the time - no cheese or dressing on the Caprese sandwich and onion and tomatoes on the ham when requested not to have them.  Very disappointing for something so simple.",

We ordered a large gluten free pizza with no onions and extra sides of ranch, they called back and said they couldn't do large.. so they were going to give me one small and one medium. I said that's totally fine.    We wait 45 minutes, get our pizza and it's loaded with onions (which I'm allergic to) and get NO ranch.   I call the location and ask what can be done and she says \"if you want a new pizza, we can send one out\" with a huge attitude. She said she has to wait for the delivery guy to get back to figure it out.   SO strange that a restaurant wouldn't want to fix this situation asap.   Won't be ordering from here again.  We have been waiting 1.5 hours now for our replacement pizza... still waiting.",

While we were there she told us about their rewards program. We signed up and got a free drink. If I would have written my review then I would have given this place 5 stars!  Today, my wife and I returned and brought with us a couple friends. Our server was Carol, she was very sweet. We had gotten an offer, my wife, myself, and her friend. The offer was for two slices of cheese pizza and a drink for $5. On the deal it says that it is limited PER CUSTOMER. So we assumed that each of us could get it. When we went to order Carol said she only do the deal for one person at the table. We showed her that it said per customer. She then went to the back to speak to someone and came back saying that she was told no, but would do it for us this time. By the end of it all, we didn't get the deal on our check. It also took an hour from the time we sat down to get our food. It took another thirty minutes (not at all exaggerating) for us to pay.   Another party sat next to us, and at one point were serving themselves because the food was not being delivered. It was not a good experience at all.   I love the food, so I may give it another try, but they need to work with their staff more on serving their guest in a timely manner and also work on their rewards program and either honor what the coupon says, or change it.",

I'm ill so we order a lot of delivery so I can't speak for the service in the restaurant but if you order a \"create your own topping\" selection or change one or two items on one of their favorites pizzas you will absolutely get an incorrect food order. I have a copy of the receipt that says \"no sausage\" as I can't tolerate it. Pizza came with the ricotta I did ask for as a substitute LOADED with sausage. I'm writing this as this is not the 1st, 2nd, or even 3rd time we've gotten something other than we ordered. We love their chicken, sandwiches, and the pizza sauce and crust but whoever is assembling the pizzas has an issue with customers and it reveals itself in the form of consistently incorrect orders. I've worked for years in food service and I am willing to give a place an occasional pass if they are understaffed, really busy, etc but this has happened the last several times we ordered food for delivery. Sorry Streets-we will be using Rosati's from now on. With regrets-Natalie and Marc Johnson",

I ordered a chopped Greek with no olives. I met her and we ordered our Mexican food...after our food came out I went back here to pick up the salad, it wasn't ready so as I waited another carryout came up missing a slice I felt terrible for the girl at the counter she apologized went back to the kitchen where the younger kid with headphones in seemed irritated that she even came back there...she politely came back and apologized to the guy and explained it would take a few more minutes...she then apologized to me and said she would check on the salad..again he seemed bothered she even came back....I decided to go pick my car up and pull it to a closer spot that had opened...when I came back and grabbed my salad and got it home I got the most half assed salad with olives on it..obviously he just wanted it out of the kitchen and for her to stop checking on it...so irritated by the experience and having no desire to pick olives out of this 13 dollar with tip, salad I just pitched it after taking the picture and enjoyed our Mexican food.. delicious btw...I gave 2 stars because alot of the food looked good at the tables and because of how great the girl was despite the trials she has to deal with from the kitchen....that being said I doubt I'd order this salad even made to a high standard, to describe a chopped Greek with generic lettuce un chopped and this size seems like a fetch when many places offer a larger higher quality of a salad for a few bucks cheaper...I don't care about the few bucks but it Insulting at that price for a salad",

It is set in a cute but struggling shopping street made to look like a neighborhood.  The pizza is the some of the best I've had in vegas. The crust is just right. Not too thick and not too thin. The toppings are fresh and the cheese is flavorful. The only time I have had a complaint was when I ordered a piece of pizza by the slice. It was obviously a piece that had been sitting around and was reheated, not so good. SO I would not reccomend ordering pizza by the slice.   The salads here are fantastic. I love the greek salad. Lots of fresh romaine with green, red and yellow peppers, cucumbers,tomatoes and kalamata olives with feta cheese with a tasty greek dressing.  The one drawback to this place is the service. The waitresses are not very friendly and the service is slow. Even with that drawback, this is still our go to place for good pizza.",

    "text": "My friend from Arizona suggested I try out the wings, he had heard there was a location in Vegas. I went to the Streets of New York website to check out the menu and saw that they have Happy Hour, clicked on the link for the Happy Hour Menu. The website states, \"Enjoy food and drink specials from 2:30 pm to 6 pm, Monday through Friday at all Streets of New York locations!\" Cool!!! I had even preselected my order in my mind.  I arrived at the restaurant around 3:40 pm on Friday. I walked in and the waitress was on the phone and saw the sign to seat yourself. After awhile the waitress greets me and I ask about the Happy Hour menu (there are no signs mentioning a happy hour anywhere). She said, \"There is no Happy Hour on Friday.\" Since, this was my first time here and thought to myself maybe I misread the website. I was still able to order from the lunch specials (10:30 am to 4:00 pm). Ordered the 6 wings and a slice, soda, and a slice of the pumpkin cheesecake.  I loved the wings! They were meaty, crispy on the outside and tender on the inside, just the right amount of sauce, and great buffalo flavor. I liked the crust of the pizza but it didn't seem like there was any sauce and it tasted dry. The pumpkin cheesecake was dreamy! It was light, creamy and the pumpkin flavor was subtle.  I will be back for more wings and cheesecake for sure! I would also like to try more items during Happy Hour, apparently not on a Friday though. Like previous reviewers the wait staff seemed to be going through the motions and not especially welcoming. I would given a rating of 4 stars for the food only but downgraded based on service and False advertisement of Monday through Friday Happy Hour.",

    "text": "We ordered delivery from here last night seeing as I didn't feel like cooking dinner ;) The prices seemed a bit steep for a pizza place but seeing as I had a $5 off coupon, we decided to give it a try.  I ordered a large pepperoni, garden salad and a side of garlic cheese bread. The delivery man was super nice and polite. The pizza was good, piping hot and the perfect amount of toppings. The cheese was stringy and melty which I love. The crust was the perfect combination of chewy with just enough crispness so that it was not doughy. The garden salad was super fresh and delicious. The veggies were crunchy and tasted like the had just been picked. The only downfall was that they forgot the salad dressing ;( Luckily, I was able to find some at home. The garlic cheese bread was kind of bland, I didn't taste any garlic at all so I don't think we will be ordering that again.  Overall I think we will try this place again....hopefully next time they remember the salad dressing!",

Great selection of drafts beers and reasonably priced glasses of wine.   I would continue eating at the restaurant, although I would never actually dine inside at this location again. It is absolutely impossible to receive and simple smile or a thank you from ANY of the staff. Overall the service is mediocre and extremely un-friendly. You will have a better chance of receiving better service from the giant rat at Chuck E Cheese's.",

We ended up on this side of town, and we were about to go for Mexican, when we ran into a yelper who convinced us this pizza was better than the burritos. We decided to give it a go.   The restaurant is casual with plenty of tables. The menu has pizza, wings, sandwiches, salads and Italian offerings. There are two crust options, and we went with the thin and crispy. It was indeed very thin and very crispy.   We asked the waitress if there was plenty of sauce, and she assured us, yes. Pizza came and it had exactly zero sauce. She admitted she didn't realize the pizza that we had ordered did not come with sauce. It wasn't a big deal, just a little disappointing. We ended up getting sauce on the side and spreading it on the top. The sauce was tasty, but we probably looked a little odd smearing sauce onto the top of our pizza.  The toppings were fresh. The flavor was good, and it wasn't the least bit greasy. However, I could have used a bit more gooey goodness from the cheese. It just seemed a little stale, not melty and delicious.  It gets the pizza job done.",

I ended up waiting over 40 min for the food to be ready. I watched as the lady who I assume was a manager went back and yelled at the cook for 10 min, who apparently forgot to cook my order. The cook apologized but was met with a resounding amount of scorn, \"you better be sorry.\"   So, now to the food. I have to say that I wouldn't be so upset if it was worth the wait. The baked ziti was bland and disappointing. It didn't have much italian sausage in it at all and the garlic cheese bread should just be called mozzarella cheese bread. The garlic was non-existent.

    "text": "I was really disappointed in my overall experience at this restaurant.  We got there around 6:30 on a Saturday night.  The place was full but we managed to get a table.  Nice inside but very noisy.  There was no greeter and the sign said to seat yourself.  It took about 10 minutes before I finally flagged down our server to get our order put in.  She seemed entirely flustered and disorganized.  Another server had previously taken our drink order.  They advertise complimentary garlic knots.  I had to ask our server for these, and she said \"If they are made.\"  This is after I saw two other tables get complimentary garlic knots ahead of us.  She never went back to the kitchen to check.  I watched her as we were seated near the kitchen area.  Finally I flagged down a different server and he brought us a small order.  They were good but the marinara dipping sauce they serve it with was cold.  My wife ordered pasta with bolognese sauce and mushrooms with a garden salad.  I order a sandwich and we split a pizza with pepperoni and garlic.  My wife's salad came out first.  Once again brought by another server, not our server.  Then they brought out the pizza.  It was cooked well but there was no sauce whatsoever and they put way to much roasted garlic on it.  It was overpowering to the point that all you tasted was garlic.  After I ate one piece my stomach was upset.  Then about 5-10 minutes after the pizza came, they  brought my wife's pasta.  She ordered it with no cheese, and of course there was cheese.  She sent it back.  They brought the same pasta dish out with the cheese scrapped off and a different type of sauce poured over the top then the bolognese.  The pasta sauce tasted watery like it came from a jar.  It really had no flavor and was unappealing to look at and it tasted even worse.  During this time my sandwich had not come.  I watched as my sandwich was put up in the window where the server's take the food from the kitchen.  It sat there for over 10 minutes as our server or any other server failed to bring it to our table.  it was moved several times around the window it was sitting on.  out of the heat lamp so it was getting cold.  At one point it was taken off the window and put on the server's table and then moved back up to the window Finally I had enough and I asked a different server to take the sandwich off my bill because it was sitting up there for over 10 minutes.  We just wanted to pay for the pizza and pasta and it get out of this restaurant.  Just as we did that our server showed up with the sandwich in hand saying that it just came up.  We informed her that it did not just come up and that it had been sitting there for over 10 minutes and that she had failed to bring it to our table.  I asked for the check and she brought it.  She asked if we wanted to go boxes and we turned her down because we said we were disappointed by the food and the service.  After she ran my card she said that we didn't have to pay if we didn't enjoy the food.  That was about all she did correct the entire evening.  It safe to say that I will never return to this restaurant.  I am not a difficult customer.  I rarely ever send food back to the kitchen, but this server and restaurant failed on so many accounts that I had no choice but to voice my opinion about how poor the food and service was.  I would highly recommend you try another pizzeria before going to this one.  Flat out disappointing in all categories.",

    "text": "Upon arriving, my friend and I sat down at an open booth and were given menus and had our drink order taken immediately.  This is the only thing that happened fast during our visit.  The ONLY reason this is getting even one star is because a zero-star review isn't possible.  We ordered a large Mediterranean pizza and specifically ordered chicken on half of it because one of us is vegetarian and the other isn't.  We also ordered a basket of fries as an appetizer, which came out hot, their only redeeming quality.  The pizza took a VERY long time to arrive and when it did, it was wrong.  Not only was it missing an ingredient that was listed on the menu but it had chicken on the whole pizza. We brought it to the server's attention right away and she claimed to have not heard the request and continued to argue until I made it clear I couldn't eat the chicken on the pizza.  She told me she'd be bringing me a new small one with the correct toppings in a hurry.  This pizza took longer than the first one and when it came, it too was wrong.  When we brought this to her attention, she began to argue with us and even called over another server from the table she was waiting on to argue with us further.  By this point we didn't want anything further to do with the continued disappointments Streets of New York was providing.  They had a THIRD person bring a box over for the leftover incorrect pizza and told us that we weren't being charged for anything and could just leave.    We did just that and WON'T be back. Steer clear of this establishment if you want quality food and good guest service!!",

    "text": "I came to Streets of New York for a painting party through Vegas Painting Parties.  It was through the lunch hours so I had to get some food.  Its the law I think.  Anyhow, I got the lunch special featuring a half sandwich and a cup of soup.  The sandwich was good.  I got the Italian sandwich with capicolla, ham and salami.  The bread was lightly toasted and had a nice crunch to it.  The meats, cheese and veggies had a lot of flavor.  No complaints on that end.  And my sandwich plate camae with a handful of potato chips too.  They were just chips out of a bag I think.  Not anything like homemade chips.  That was a little disappointing but since I was not expecting chips any in the first place I did not mind.  The soup is where my interest was lost.  I ordered wedding soup as it is one of my favorites and I rarely get it because I rarely see it anywhere.  I really did not care for it much at all.  The broth was not the light clear broth I am used to with wedding soup.  It was actually kind of thick and very salty.  I'm glad I got just a cup because a full bowl would have been too much for me to take down.  I can't say much for the service as I was in a crowded area with fellow aspiring painters.  It was quick service as much as can be expected from the situation so I don't necessarily have any complaints but I don't have any outstanding compliments either.  Consider me Swiss (neutral).",

My girlfriend and I both had the featured lunch special. 1 slice of pizza & 6 wings for $6.99. I ordered the pepperoni pizza & honey hot wings.  The wings are the best I have had in Las Vegas. Far superior than any of the other pizza places and BBW. The sauce was delicious!  The pizza was some of the best I have had in Las Vegas as well. Very good!!!  The service was good as well, Emily our waitress was very attentive. We will definitely be coming back.",

It was 110.00 plus a 5.00 tip to the inexperienced order taker. I asked him to throw in some garlic bread and he didn't of course. The pizza was ok, we paid for extra cheese and never got it so that made it taste worse than what it was. The fettuccine was horrible! No taste whatsoever. The spaghetti was dry, hardly any sauce. We liked the antipasta salad but didn't have a lot of toppings. This is a perfect example of who you should have at the front taking orders. I was super nice to this kid and he should have three in done garlic bread if I'm paying 115.00! That's just bad business. I'd have the chef take an Italian cooking class to brush up on his skills. No I would not go back to this place and unless they change their ways, I predict this place will go under in 6-8 months.",

So we finally get in. We get two menus. First thing you notice a big difference between the menu online and the menu and the restaurant(2018 who does not update their online business)  Now price value to food, not goid at all. Food is Almost average. Order two entrees both were good portions.  The red pepper flakes. Must have been very old no heat at all. Now the service on a scale of 1 to 10. Maybe a 3. Asked for food container to take some food home. What I believe was the manager walked up dropped off a container and walks away. Streets of New York. Evidently they have no concept what customer service is supposed to be. I'm 100% Italian and grew up in New Jersey where there's a lot of good Italian restaurants with good service. This unfortunately is not one of them. Never go back",

    "text": "I've been here a few times as the husband works in the vicinity. The first couple times I ordered to-go. The 3rd time a family member was in town with pizza on her mind for lunch...and since we were planning to meet the hubs for lunch might as well dine-in. The first couple times in, I stood there waiting to be helped as this one waitress at he time stood talking with a bunch of guys who were seated at a table. She almost looked dang near disturbed that I was standing there. Then I realized, you seat yourself. However, I'm not going to sit down and expect to be helped especially for a to-go order. What's bad...this literally happened both times. Her smiling face chatting up certainly didn't follow with her when she walked over to help me.  Choosing to dine-in was a little hard for me to do. Fam in town, pizza on zee mind, walking distance, lunch...okay let's go. Service was the SAME! I tried giving excuses the first couple times...but the very same lady (could be part owner idk) seemed like we were an inconvenience. She wasn't chipper nor welcoming, really.   We have ordered wings, street fries, the new york combo pizza, a bruschetta, and the meatball sub...collectively. I thought the wings were pretty good, but everything else...pretty average. The food wasn't exciting, kind of like the service. Dining in there was 1 older gent, a family of 3, and us. Getting checked on, refills, was like a deep sigh and a mission. Why do we have to wave a flag to be seen? I honestly wanted to love this place, but for the value and the service...it isn't even worthed. It's hard to support a business that feels like they don't value each customer.  It's just disappointing businesses whether it'd be the owners or workers itself...fail to take the time in properly greeting and treating their customers to a certain level. I'm not talking about butt kissing or overly attentive...I'm just saying basic customer, GENUINE service. A lot of times the food could taste greater if the experience was great. Each time in...the place felt like a dead spirit. Something tells me if you are a regular you'll certainly have a bipolar experience and perspective.  3 times is enough even though I'm in the area often enough. Never again.  Definitely kid and stroller friendly. I'm not saying don't give it a try as my experience is mine...but hopefully you'll have a better one. 2 stars for having a lot of tables available and the food being ahhh-ite. I suppose that warrants 2 stars, aye.  Enjoy!",

They are located right off the 95N & Durango exit and a right turn on Farm and then the 2nd right turn and you have arrived to one of the Best Pizza's in the Hills. Again we were taken care of by the Great Staff with Margie who served us tonite and Brittany. All of the staff are so good that no-matter who waits on you things will go well. We are there about every 2 weeks or so & they take such good care of us that we keep going back. You will be delighted at the Great Food that is served there. Along with the Super Pizza they serve they have the Best Antipasto for two and that is served with Garlic knots and they are fantastic too. Really anything that you order you will be happy with it. Robin does a fine job running this restaurant and making sure everything is good for the customers. If your in the area and you are hungry do yourself a favor and stop in for a great meal no matter if its pizza or a sangwich or just a salad you will make it a point to go back again. If Margie or Brittany take care of you tell them Robbie said Hi. lol",

Sad to say I no longer go here because we finally had enough with our last visit. The waitress was so rude and unfriendly I couldn't bare to spend my money somewhere I felt that unwelcome. She greeted our table by asking for a drink order, no hello, no smile, no welcome, nada.. She must be working there for a long time because she's always there unfortunately and makes us feel like cattle, trying to herd us through as quickly as possible. She didn't clear any dirty plates that should have been taken away after our appetizers to make room for our dinners and we had to call her over to the table from  where she was sitting watching the football game to ask for silverware. Every time she would come to the table she would turn away so quickly I had to say excuse me to get her to turn back around so I could ask for something. She made us feel like we were bothering her and that we were just getting in the way of her watching football. I've been a server for over ten years and I would never dream of treating my guests as such. Huge THUMBS DOWN! She takes the hospitality out of the hospitality industry.",

The crusts were crispy but had the right amount of chewiness, combined with the superb toppings and sweet tang of the pizza sauce made everything better. I used to beg my fiance to have pizza there.  Now. . .not so much.  Something is off with their pizzas and I keep ordering them thinking they are going to taste amazing again. Every time in recent history I have been disappointed.  One time I told the waitress that our pizza was soggy and the dough was still raw and she told me I should have ordered it well done. Um. . .okay, thanks.  A couple times the toppings have been unrecognizable.   The other times the pizzas tastes couldn't rival a pizza ordered in (not good bc I could have easily called in a pizza order to pizza hut, paid less, and enjoyed it more).  I love the pizzeria feel of the place, but I can't put up with declining food for ambiance.  I really do want to love this place again, but right now I'm going to stop coming in. I'm sure they won't miss my $34.50 (yeah that's what we paid for a large pizza, two coors, and a coke), but it shouldn't be about that. This place could be amazing if they just tweek it a little.",

    "text": "Once in a lifetime. You don't ever see me giving 5 stars. If I have to deduct a star, it would only be because it is over 25 miles from my cave. I've seen the other reviews, and I do concur with a few of the statements: Yes, the pizza doesn't remind me of any pie back east, especially New York. But I tell you this: They should call it the Streets of Phoenix. Being the official pizza of the Phoenix Suns, it only makes sense. It's the best pizza on the west coast, especially better than that California Kitchen place. Some people don't like the service, some do. At this point of the game, this is the most consistent. Of course, I could be distracted by the important games, but that's just another service they offer me and i DON'T EVEN HAVE TO ASK.  I come to eat, hang out, and watch sports, and no one has ever bothered me and there wasn't an occasion where I had to depart from my R/R status. Where does the 5 stars come in? I'm getting to it. After work, I come for a light meal. Turkey has always been my favorite sandwich. Even though they have my favorite turkey sandwich, I, now, can't make up my mind about the chicken pesto sandwich or their tuna. They are that good. The wedding soup and the tortilla are necessities with my sammies, unless I am in a mood for a salad. In that case, I encounter another fork in the road between the pear-gorgonzola, chicken caesar or  antipasto.  The chicken wings they serve, is their own. I don't know what they do to them but it's close to genius in my books. I can replicate anything at Metro. But this place has the goods, they put love back in the kitchen. So, easy 4 stars right there. The fifth star is for getting me to eat soup or salad, and liking it. For me, losing 30+ lbs after eating their 3 nights a week is the money maker.It has never been so easy and I didn't even have to try. With their menu, I could rule this planet. I can't wait to make it to their new store on Ft. Apache and Tropicana.",

    "text": "It's better than the big chain pizza guys but far from New York pizza.  I heard a friend rave about it so got it delivered.  The pizza was cool enough that the cheese was almost solidified and I live a mile away.  The pepperoni they use is a really good brand.  The sauce was OK.  A little heavy on the spices and too acidic and the crust didn't even taste like it belonged with the pizza, it just didn't bring anything to the party.  We also got the artichoke dip which was spot on, served with tasty, toasted Italian bread. The dip was a creamy, cheesy sauce filled with artichoke that was firm and had a lot of flavor.   The only real problem I have with it was that the pizza was not cooked on a stone, it was cooked in a convection-conveyor oven.  I could tell because of not only the flavor, but when I flipped a piece over, I could see the screen imprinted on it.  If you're going to be as bold to have the words \"New York\" in the title of your brand, at least cook pizza in a stone oven to achieve that lovely dark brown char on the bottom that is a staple of New York pizza which not only makes for a better crust, but overall flavor.  I'm willing to give it another shot.  Next time I'll eat in and try some pasta.",

We go in and sit down it takes 20 min for the waitress to finally come by and ask for our drinks. We say no and she leaves and comes back 5 mins later with a bus person to take the drink order. WTF???  We orders our drinks they came out right away. We place our order. 20 mins later no food. 10 more minutes still no food. How long does it take to make a pizza and a ham sandwich? A total of 55 minutes goes by and we still don't have our food. This after we have asked 4 times \" do you know when our order is going to be up\"? \" meanwhile I see customers that were seated at least 10 to 15 minutes after is getting their meals. Finally the food is here and they mess up the sandwich. The pizza  is horrible. So is the sandwich. I have had better meals off of a construction lunch truck. We ask for the check. We ask forte check 2 more times. The  check comes and it is over charged by $33. The waitress has the nerves to tell us that we ordered all of this. I want to point out that at this point a manager has never come over. After 10 mins of arguing with the waitress about the chargesy wife also notices  there is a %15 gratuity charged on top of this. I am not a cheap person and I tip very well. But I will not tip for the a job or a service that does not deserve it. Any ways we ask to have that removed from the bill also . She says she can't because the system will not allow it. Still no manager. Finally we demand to see a manager and are told that they are too busy to come and speak to us. I ask to see the owner who I know is in the building( our kids played baseball together) and was told that she doesn't care and that she does not have it time to come over and speak with us because she is off. A manger finally comes over and hands us back the bill minus the gratuity and the 33$ over charges and then asks us to never come back again. Wow you treat us badly and you ask us never to return. Don't you worry we will never come back to your establishment and I will forever bad mouth you to who ever will listen. YOUR FOOD SUCKS!  YOUR SERVICE SUCKS!! YOUR ATTITUDES SUCK!!! Basically you suck!!",

We went back the other night, mainly again because it was close and we had a coupon for two for one. Even with a coupon I don't think I would go back. I had baked ziti. It was rather bland and there wasn't anything special about it, not bad, but not good either. I switched with my dining partner who had the eggplant rollitini, this was horrible, the underlying bed of spaghetti was fine. It tasted like the make their own sauce, but the eggplant was mushy and again bland. Definitely not recently cooked, more like microwaved, and possibly bought from Sysco instead of being made in house. It was a $2.50 or so up charge for a dinner salad and bread sticks. The bread was hard and cold. The dinner salads were okay. One biggie though - no fresh brewed iced tea. Service started out slow but once the waitress came over everything was fast. I was teetering before a one star, as I said I will never go back there, but gave them a two as the sauce on the spaghetti was decent and the service was good when we finally got service. If there were halfsies in yelp I would probably do one and a half. Although I will note if I didn't have the coupon I would have definitely felt that it was not worth $30+ for two people.",

Having eaten pizza from the time I was a kid back east, good pizza, then suffering once in a while from that cardboard crap from the major take out joints which advertise on TV, I was pleasantly surprised and then thrilled with our experience here. The store is located in a neat strip mall on Fort Apache near Russell Road. The inside was spotless and it was clear that someone takes a great deal of pride in the appearance. Our server came promptly, answered questions, and took our order. She brought some rolls and marinara sauce as we waited, which was great. Our pizza arrived and it not only looked great but tasted great as well, hot and delicious. We took two slices home and even after resting for a day, the taste and texture of the crust and toppings was superb. We opted for the New York Combo and it's one of the best pizzas I've ever eaten and we will certainly return. Thanks very much for proving that a traditional pizza restaurant can still exist and more than successfully compete with the best.",

Server was very nice but service was a little slow, even though there were only maybe 3 other tables in the restaurant. However, her kind attitude really made up for it.  The pizza itself was really really good. Not quite the same as a pizza from NY but it was legit good pizza, and I don't even like pizza that much.   About $50 for 2 pizzas and 2 drinks.",

Pizza is mediocre, atmosphere seems loud all the time, but service is usually good. Did my 13th birthday party here years ago when I thought it was better, but there's better pizza places out there",

But the owner is never welcoming and for now on I will order my food to go. Maybe I'm  old school but I don't want to be a regular in any place that your not appreciated for being loyal. This place would be great for big sporting games, it would be full of people and now I know why it is not! So I also go across the street to Laticias and they welcome you with open arms. So if you really want some good Italian food I would recommend this place. But I won't bring my family or out of town guest here for a good time. Really sad for pasta and pizza lovers.",

When ordering for delivery my normal is their bacon cheese burger and fries. I normally love it but as of late the burger is dry and over cooked. No seasoning seems to be used. The bun is better seems they are using a sturdier bun as it holds up to the condiments. They only put the condiments on one side. I personally like it on both buns as it keep the bun from feeling dry. The fries as well are not seasoned. It  is best to season fries right of the grease so it sticks.",

We arrived around 6PM, and I was surprised to see how busy they were on a Tuesday night. There was only one waitress and while we got our drinks pretty quickly, it took her quite a while to get around to take our order. No big deal, it was just her hustlin' all those tables. I got the cheese ravioli and the streets fries and my husband got wings. I really like the ravioli, despite the marinara being a bit bland. It's okay because I smother it in more parmesan anyway! We always have good food here and the service is usually not too bad. I recommend the passion cookie-I skipped out on getting one last night and now I'm regretting it! I think they're better than pizookies.",

    "text": "I am definitely torn writing this review. I will say that the pizza cold the next day was much better than it was fresh and hot.   We ordered an antipasto salad which did not have enough dressing. The portion was small. Four of us maybe got 1/2 cup each of salad. For $12 you would expect to get a larger portion. The sausage and peppa pizza sounded good. Sausage, green peppers, ricotta, onion and garlic. Honestly it was probably the worst pizza I've ever had. Ranch is from a bottle - yuck. I was beginning to regret having chose this place for dinner.   But my friends there is a saving grace, and it's name is broasted chicken. Broasted is broiled and roasted. It's crunchy like fried chicken but not greasy. It's seriously sooo good. The 8 piece meal is $20 and it comes with two sides and some potato wedges. We got the coleslaw which was really good, and fries which were just whatever. We all wished we would have ordered more chicken and not pizza, but you live and you learn.",

    "text": "This restaurant is normally very pleasant to visit.  However tonight was a different story.  I walked in and there were only 5 or 6 tables occupied and it was open seating.  There appeared to be 3 servers.  Two of them looked at me when I walked in but never greeted me.  I sat down towards the Northern wall.  The servers walked by me several time as I waited to be helped for about 15 minutes and still never offered a greeting.  Finally I approached one of the servers that was clearing a booth and asked for a menu and took the empty booth.  I proceeded to order their cheesy bread which was to be brought out first.  It was but only by about 3 minutes.  It was supposed to come with marinara, it did, but I had to ask for it.  It was such a tiny little cup I also asked for another and some napkins as well since no one brought those.  He returned with my pizza, the extra marinara, and napkins.  As he took the napkins off the plate you could see big as day that it was filthy with a big ole dried tomato smack dab in the center.  I will try to upload a picture.  I went to take a bite of the sorry excuse of the cheesy bread that the brought out.  Nothing like the ones I received 2 weekends ago and countless times before and they were still frozen in the middle.  At this point I asked for a to go box for my untouched pizza and my check.  Very, very disappointing to drive across town to receive this kinda of service!  **Updated 1/3/18**  I have recently revisited this location on 3 separate occasions and it appears that the issues that I had have been corrected.  Everything was great, food and service!  I have also updated my star rating that I had left prior to this update.",

We came here to participate in the trivia night that they have every Monday night at 7pm. It's very fun!  We ordered pepperoni & ricotta cheese pizza with Caesar salad and both were very tasty!

    "text": "Who doesn't love pizza? Whether it's NY or Chicago Style, we as a whole, love it.  We have lived in Centennial Hills for 8 years and we have seen our fair share of pizza places come and go. Streets of NY has been there for a while and it was time we actually gotten a pie from them.  I called for a carry out order. We always order a lot of food to get a gauge of how good it'll be.  We got a 16\" pizza, 12 piece boneless wings, a slice of chocolate cake, and their famous Broaster chicken. I used the yelp check in offer for a $5, 4 piece broaster meal which is normally $9. We were told it would take about 15-20 minutes for our order to be ready.  I got there about 15 minutes after I ordered and after I had paid was told they were out of chocolate cake. We opted for the cheesecake.  After about 10 more minutes of waiting I was finally on my way home.   The pizza we had ordered was a 16\" NY style pie. Ricotta cheese on the whole thing, half with pepperoni and jalapenos. The pizza came with ricotta, but the pepperoni and jalapenos were on the WHOLE pie. I called to let them know about the mistake and they offered to make a new one or give me a credit, I opted for the latter.   The pizza looked good upon first look. We each grabbed a piece and started. Another issue. Mistakes get made, I understand, we probably eat hundreds of hairs or more in our food in our life, but I don't want to see them. A hair was found in the ricotta. The discovery made it hard to eat the rest of the pizza.   Other than the mistakes on the pizza, overall the flavors were good. The crust was crispy and chewy, the way a pizza should be. The mozzarella was tasty and it wasn't a greasy pie. The ricotta was creamy and the pepperoni and jalapenos added a nice salt and spice. Overall 3.5/5  We had originally ordered the Honey Gold flavor, but were told they didn't have it. So we settled for the medium Buffalo sauce. The boneless wings were surprisingly well made. The medium Buffalo sauce had no trace of heat at all though, but the flavor was good. I assume if you want heat, order the Hot Buffalo.  Overall 3/5  The Broaster chicken looked dead on arrival. Probably one of the least appetizing, driest looking pieces of chicken I have ever seen. With that being said, upon tasting, it was better than it looked. Better than it looks doesn't mean it was good. The chicken wasn't dry, but it was bland. Very little, to no seasoning at all. Overall 2/5  The cheesecake was good, but it wasn't chocolate cake. It was a good old fashioned cheesecake. Creamy, tangy, sweet. Overall 3/5  Streets of NY is a decent pizza shop. The prices are a bit high, but it's a higher end chain. It's not anything I would go out of my way to get, but it wasn't too bad.",

My 2 year old son and I were one of 5 tables sat on a Sunday night and waited 35 minutes for a small personal pizza that was mediocre. The hostess was nice getting us a high chair and some crayons. The waiter when refilling my soda put his fingers over the rim where you place your mouth. I watched him at the well stick his hand in my drink to take out the straw and then gave me a new one in the same glass. Why not change the glass? Three ppl in the kitchen and such a long wait didn't make sense. Not NY pizza.",

We ordered bread with beer cheese and a large pizza to share for all four of us.   The service was nice but they could not get an order correct save their lives. We asked for more bread on four separate occasions before they finally remembered it, we had to remind them to bring drink refills and finally our pizza order was incorrect. They were very apologetic and very nice, so I couldn't be too mad. They corrected our pizza, gave us the incorrect one for free and discounted our correct order as an apology.   I appreciate their effort since it was clear they were busy and they tried to correct their errors. The food was good and I enjoyed it but I don't think I would go out of my way to return.   Overall, we had an ok experience.",

The service could have been better, although we went on a busy Friday night. I just hate hate hate having to wait for my check. We ended up getting up and asking for it, since our waitress was MIA. I didn't get one refill on my iced tea either. Minus 1 star!   The price is also ridiculous for the food. Our bill for a salad, garlic bread, 2 kids entrees, beverages and a pizza came to $80 without tip. Minus another star!!   I probably won't return even though I love the location and its proximity to my parents house.",

    "text": "I had recalled this place during my brief time in Scottsdale and was excited to see there were locations here in town.    Location:  This spot is located in the far Northwest in an area that has continued to grow over the past few years.  It is situated in a cute little mall similar to the district in Henderson, but considerably smaller.   I get the sense the mall was to be larger but construction stopped midway.  Still it is a very cute area.  Ambiance:  The inside is nice  It is a bit small but had a nice little bar and plenty of tables with MLB and ESPN on the tvs.  I also noticed a patio for when it isnnt in the 100s lol.  I think it would be a cool place to stop at on the way home to catch a game.  I have read they have happy hour specials, but not positive about that or what they might be.  Food:  We order just a couple slices of pepperoni.  As we waited we were served complimentary Passion bread.  The bread was pretty good.  I definitely would want to have it again.  The pizza overall was solid.  The crust was quite soft when bitten into.  I could not recall if this was what I had, had experienced previously, but I might ask for it to be cooked a bit longer next time.  It was still quite tasty.  The cheese and pepperoni both tasted great.  Service: We were the only folks in the place.  I imagine the extreme heat and time of day contributed to that.  The waitress was attentive and we had no complaints.  Price:  We went during their lunch time (10:30-4pm) and slices, beverages. and bread all came in at about $15.  Definitely a great price.  All in all had a great experience and look forward to hitting up this area again.  I was shocked to hear they had been in business for over five years in that location.  I hope for the area to continue to build to further the foot traffic.",

I immediately though, \"Thank goodness this place is just as good, if not better, than I remember!\"  Our waitress, looking familiar from years past, was super nice, and was quick to assess my culinary desires by making a recommendation which was far from regrettable.

It tasted fine but it's just not my style. I love thin crust pizza but I like to fold the slices (I'm from NJ originally). Meatball sandwich was delicious and came wit a choice of sides. I got the pasta salad and it was surprisingly good. Homemade and not heavily dressed. All pasta dishes were very good with the exception of the lasagna. I thought there was too much meat and not enough to ricotta but that's me. If you like meaty lasagna you'll probably love it. I need to mention their baked ziti (nee penne). It was exceptional in that it included hunks of link sausage. Possibly the best takeout ziti al forno I've ever eaten outside of NJ. In summary,  except for my screw up ordering the wrong pizza crust and for giving me too much meat in my lasagna, I would have rated it 5 stars",

If your just by yourself it's cool to because all the employees are friendly and take the time to stop and talk if that's what your looking for. If your in a rush that works too because you can place an order and be done and gone in less than 30 minutes. All in all its my favorite neighborhood hangout.",

The bad:  The price and the thickness of the crust.  As evidenced by my favorite pizza joints, I do not like thick crust pizza and this was a little thick.  2 pizzas came to $50 and that just seems a little crazy town to me.

It took us almost an hour to get our food, after our waitress forgot to put our order in. Once the order came, it was incorrect. We finished eating and weren't checked on for about 20 more minutes after that. We never got refills or anything. When we finally got our checks, the checks were incorrect. So she went back to change it and didn't come back for another ten minutes. I got so fed up, as it had then been 2 hours since we arrived, went to the cash register, dropped some cash and left. Our waitress was frazzled and confused the whole time. It's not like it was busy... there were 2 other parties in the whole restaurant besides us. If you're debating on visiting, just make sure you have plenty of time to spare because who knows how long it'll take and how attentive and helpful they'll be.",

The creamy angel hair pasta dish with sun dried tomatoes,chicken and mushrooms is hellah yummy too....  The service however is weird.... No one ever smiles or says Hello when you walk in and on several occasions we were the only ones eating and at the same time there were 3 full on dirty tables just sitting there while the waitress sat at a table and ate her food.  Now, I know you're thinking maybe it was a busy day and maybe that was the only time that she found to eat- Bullcrap!!!  I would never feel comfortable eating while there were customers waiting for their food along with 3 dirty tables for them to look at. Like I said this was on several occasions not just this time.... Even though we were the only ones in the restrauant I still had to call her over for refills and my pizza crust was different from what I ordered - a real bummer!!!!  So the 3 stars is only because of the food!!!!",

Had the pasta dishes, lasagna and baked ziti and they were very good and huge portions.  Need to try the pizza again to see if I can re-elevate to 5 stars  As always great service, best salads etc  Several things have gone downhill. First the new wines, 19 Crimes, is far inferior to what they have carried for the past year, but the price did not change. Second, for the 2nd time in a row, there was to little sauce and it was not distributed well. Third, my daughter ordered a sausage pizza and it was san sausage. The positives remain, very good salads, friendly wait staff and exceptionally fine New York style cheese cake. Is it time to start looking for a new pizza place, I don't know? Will try again, but the wine by itself will cause me to search in earnest!",

I also order the chicken tenders with fries, which was supposed to come with a dipping sauce as well but only came with a cup of ketchup. I asked for an additional two cups of ranch and was charged $1, let me remind you these dipping cups are tiny. I also ordered a slice of cheese pizza which was supposed to be a large slice for $3.25.

I had the mushroom, black olive and tomato with a side of anchovies. My husband ordered the margarita. To my amazement, the pizzas were great! Ok, so it's not going to be exactly as a regular crust but this sure beats our pizza craving. Did I mention I tried making a low carb pizza crust at home?? Yes and my husband did not ask for a repeat . Glad we found Streets of NY!  Can I also mention that we had the best, I mean THE BEST server, Britney. She is spunky, has a great personality  and always checked up on us. You would be too lucky to have Britney take care of you!  Thank you Streets  of NY. We'll be seeing you soon!",

    "text": "Review is for a called-in, pick up order.   First off, I had issues placing the order. It seemed like the girl with whom I spoke was new since she didn't seem to have any idea what was on the menu, how to punch it into their POS system (or that a chicken breast is white meat).   Once I finally got the order in, I was told it'd take 15-30 minutes. Okay, cool. That's a pretty big range of time so I figured I would head over to arrive after 20 minutes to minimize the wait time on either side of the estimate.   I get there, and my order is retrieved from the kitchen. I checked the bag as we were trying to settle up the bill and it was missing an entire item (an app order of baked chicken wings). After consulting the kitchen, she said the wings should be in a plastic container with a lid inside the takeout bag. Unfortunately, no such container was in the bag, so after conferring with the kitchen again, she told me the order of wings was in a paper bag inside the plastic bag. Oh *these*? Cue me referring to the 3 potato wedges in a small paper pouch - Yeah those aren't an entire $13 order of wings. They are potato wedges. At that point she took the entire bag back to the kitchen and had some words with the cooks and came back to the front. I told her I would like to just skip the wings if they weren't cooked yet since they were BAKED chicken wings (and shouldn't be immediately summonable due to the laws of linear time) but she said they were already on their way. Weird... why did it take so much detective work to figure out where they were/that they weren't in the take out bag? But yes, thanks for pointing out that you didn't charge me for the three potato wedges. Those will be complimentary. All hail the generous gift of Streets of NY! (joking - I didn't care about the wedges - that's why I didn't order any to begin with, but I guess it was nice of them anyway.)  Upon returning home with what was finally at least approximate to the order I had placed, we dug in. The side of coleslaw mirrored the rest of my order and pick up experience - described by the single person who tried it as \"slightly terrifying - oddly warm, and with a very strange mix of textures.\" Good thing a 4oz serving is roughly the size of a small child's fist, so it wasn't like we felt like we were wasting anything when none of the rest of us were willing to chance sudden illness by having a taste.   All of that said, however, the chicken was pretty good! The broasted chicken breasts were super moist, not raw (yay!), and the one I had was hot through and through. Though some noted the spice was more than is found in traditional broasted chicken, the spice didn't bother me. The baked wings were also pretty good in that they weren't too greasy, but they were cold upon arrival at home only 10 min after coming out of the kitchen (and being wrapped pretty well in a styrofoam box/bag combo), which is odd.   Overall, I hope that the order/pick up experience could be better with a more experienced employee, and I will probably give them another shot in case folks were just having a bad day. The chicken was legitimately good despite all of the other issues. Until then, this is my review. After then, I'll update accordingly!",

We usually don't order fried chicken from places because it always tastes better home cooked but boy oh boy...we went 2 days in a row because it was just that damn good! The skin is super crispy and the chicken is packed with flavor and oh so moist! You don't even need hot sauce or ketchup etc. But if you like hot sauce they have house-made hot sauce that so tasty.   Meatballs: 4/5  they were moist and delicious. The marinara sauce was tasty and they put a lot of cheese on top. Really good to dip the complimentary bread in.   Pizza: 4/5  We got the 10\" half 'new yorker' (I think is the name but it's the supreme toppings) and the other half was their meat lovers. the pizza was was crispy, lots of toppings, and the crust was yummy!   Potato wedges: 2/5  Wasn't really a fan of the wedges. They were hot and fresh but kinda cut to big and you can tell they were just frozen then fried and not house made. (sorry if they are, just didn't impress me.)",

Service: I was one of two people present for a lunch service, food arriving took close to 30mins, waiter was pleasant and didnt hover so that was nice.  Food: Upon arrival not the cleaniest presentation, slightly undercooked calzone. Hot on arrival seemed to be fresh made. Extremely large portion kind of nice. Chicken was a bit dry considering it was baked. Ricotta was not evenly distributed throughout calzone was in random pockets.   Overall would I come back probably but it wouldnt be something I chose my biggest detractions where probably two things. The first being the sticky tables, the second the dry chicken and how inconsistent the ricotta was displaced in the calzone kind of ruined the dish. This place wasnt bad but in customers you typically get one dish to impress and I wasnt I will most likely try additionally other places. Consistency is key.",

Our party of four left satisfied with plenty left over for a cold pizza breakfast. Yummy! The combination pizza was loaded with the traditional faire and the sausage was bursting with flavor. We got both pies with a traditional crust. The prices were comparable with other pizza places. Don't forget to check-in on Yelp first and get your free basket of delicious french fries.

Looked around to try to make eye contact with anyone resembling a manager or host and got the distinct impression I was being avoided. They win. We won't be trying again.",

    "text": "I'm also a bit torn on this place. I've been here a few times and the food is relatively good. The chicken wings are phenomenal while the pizza is actually better at Hungry Howie's. The service for the most part has been quite good except for my encounter on Friday.  We decided to do a take-out order.  When we arrived, there was a guy at the register who was nice and friendly. However, he was chewing gum like there will be no tomorrow. I believe that this is a health code violation since he handled food.  I let his gum chomping be and a few minutes after I placed the order, I noticed that I had a text coupon on my phone. At this point, the manager was at the front counter and I asked her if she can take a look at the my order so I can possibly get the discount.  The manager swiftly asked if I had already paid for the order which I said that I did. She said, \"well there is nothing I can do because you already paid for the order!\"  What do you mean there is nothing you can do?! Cancel the order, refund my money, and place a new order. Just tell the cook in the back not to make the duplicate.  The manager should have expressed more empathy and said, \"Oh I'm sorry about that, let me see what I can do. What pizza did you order? Oh, I am sorry but you ordered the 16\" pizza but the coupon is good for the 14\".  For your trouble, I'll deduct a buck or two from your order, or give you some breadsticks but next time we would appreciate if you can let us know ahead of time if you will use a coupon.\"  I'm not really sure if I'll be back to this place anytime soon solely based on my last experience.",

We ordered their lunch special, I got 6 wings and a half sandwich, my son ordered 6 wings and a slice of pizza.  Took a while for the food and when it came. I knew I should of left, but we had already ordered the most watery iced tea. The wings were disgusting in my opinion not cooked properly for hot wings to be served at a restaurant, maybe oven baked? Microwaved perhaps... then the sandwich was disgusting meat and spring mix thrown in a toasted sesame seed bun( I am allergic). My son who is a child didn't mind. I mentioned these issue to the server and she only offered to remove the watery drinks! If you like nasty, bland food you could make better at home, come here. Rip off.",

Got there at 5:30 and waited around 12 minutes for someone to greet us and give us menus. Finally a blonde male server came back around to get our drinks but said he wasn't ready to take our food order yet, to give him a minute. We waited, and saw three other tables ( that came after us) get taken care of before us. Three people on the floor and not one came by  after dropping off water. I truly hate using the race card, but we were the only non Caucasian table and for the first time in my life I felt segregation. Once 6:15 came along and no one came back to take our order, we decided to leave two dollars for the water we were served and walked out of the restaurant. Very poor customer service, we will not be returning here ever again.",

We were offered a remake, but why not get it right the first time ... especially if you are a frequent diner?? In place of that service, 2 free refill sodas were removed from the check? Honestly, I didn't care about 2 sodas, but I did care that I couldn't eat the pizza. Not sure it's worth trying again",

We ordered the New York Style combo at it's largest size which comes in at 18\", is generously loaded with toppings.  On the down side, the crust was a bit soggy which is which surprising because we ordered the thin crust perhaps the oven wasn't set high enough for the crust to properly get a crispy crust?  Next is their famous \"broaster\" chicken, which we ordered as an 8 piece add-on to the pizza.  Yes, it's incredibly moist and the skin is extremely crispy.  Wow, never had anything quite like it.  On the down size, it's so salty... maybe it was a bad batch.  So that's another mixed bag.  The service was inattentive, had to flag down our server several times to request for items that you think shouldn't be a problem.  Our party was all Asians but before you cry discrimination, this is a common theme with the other reviews, so at least you can say that it was an equal opportunity bad customer service situation.  How hard is it to get extra napkins, straws, and a take out box for our leftovers?  The restaurant was not that busy and had enough staff, so there is no excuse for such bad service.  With so many other places to eat in Vegas, leaning towards passing.",

We have a joke in our family that we say the motto should be \"Streets of New York, hope you have time to eat here.\"  They then take 5 to 10 minutes to get a drink order and then they finally get your food order food usually takes about 45 minutes to an hour. It not uncommon for your food to be incorrect. For example, this week we ate pizza and hot chicken wings with flats only. They gave us pizza with chicken wings that we're not Flats only and they were mild. The server did not come again for another 15 minutes for me to actually say this is not what I ordered by then we have already eaten and decided that we would just pay.   If they ever change their customer service I would change my star rating to a much higher one.

I ordered the fingers, 2 pizzas , fries and \" cheesy garlic bread \". First off it took an hour and twenty minutes and cost me 50 bucks! It was late, all the food was like warm and meh. I wish I would have ordered dominoes. It would have been cheaper,faster and warmer. I will never go back. I know I ordered delivery but that shouldn't mean I get lower quality because of it. I ate it cause I paid for it. But all left overs are going in the trash.",

When we asked for a box for leftovers the waitress gave us a styrofoam thing that wouldn't work for pizza so I had to ask for a pizza box.

The garden salad was your typical dinner salad with olives, cucumbers and tomatoes. They offer a good variety of salad dressings to suit your taste.

My food arrived cold, soggy, and incorrect. Makes sense being that the driver was literally 45 min late getting to my house. When I called back to complain, I was hung up on twice. I swore I would not order from this terrible establishment again. Here, nine months later, a tragedy occurred in my community and it was promised at 30% of the profits of Streets of NY for the day would be donated to the family in need, so sucked it up and attempted to give it another try. HUGE mistake on my part. To begin, I was immediately put on hold for a crazy amount of time. I get it, people get busy. Understandable at first. Once answered, I was promptly hung up on and tried to call back to be place on hold again. Attempted to order with an few times getting the order incorrectly repeated to me a couple times. Once I had hung up, I had realized the employee had neglected to get my address so I called back. Again, placed on hold. Asked for a manager and, again hung up on. Called again put on hold. Finally, I had spoken to someone who claimed to be in charge, but really didn't didn't seem to know what was happening and neglected to solve or attend to any form of possible resolution. In sheer frustration and anger, I finally cancelled my order. My credit card has been charged and there has been NO REVERSAL. Will be filing an unauthorized charge claim tomorrow for sure. I am astounded this establishment is still in business and want to warn everyone about how incompetent, careless, rude, and thieves they are.",

My husband is from New York and this is by no means New York pizza. I have to say though that It was pretty darn good pizza anyway. I also tried their pasta and it was very good as well.   We will have to go back and try out this place again. We may also get delivery next time (they deliver within a 5 mile radius).

    "text": "The food was AMAZING (per usual). Best pizza and sandwiches on the North side of Vegas.   One thing that was NOT amazing...that would be our waiter. I believe his name was Stirling.   Everything started off okay as he took our order.... but apparently right after that his parents came in to dine as well.(as we heard him mention it to someone). That being said, he spent most of the time sitting in the booth with them. Our appetizer came out and we watched it sit on the counter as I could see his leg and shoe from around the corner at the booth with his mom and dad. 15 mins later, another employee checked the food and the ticket and graciously brought us out our food. Not once did he come over and check on us, although i would have loved some ranch and also a glass of wine. The same other employee came back and retrieved our empty appetizer plate....still no attention from our waiter. I saw him go over and speak to another table, which was conveniently in front of his parents booth, as he did so he had his phone out and was texting as his spoke to the table. (really?!) If he would have done that while speaking to our table I would have send something...but oh wait....he never really came back to our table AT ALL..There was another waitress walking by who graciously asked if we needed a refill of our drinks..since clearly we did and it wasn't going to get done by ''our'' waiter. Shortly after our food was brought out by yet another employee. Still.....not once did our ''waiter'' check in on us. Although he did make sure his parents were getting his full attention. And i get it, it's family and you want them to feel welcomed and enjoy the place you work at but not at the expense of your actual customers.  He did ask if my boyfriend needed to ''top off'' on his beverage, but that was also right before he brought us our check. We were there for over an hour and he only stopped by our table twice.   I'm a Client Impact Manager for a 5 star company and I train customer service to my employees daily. I have never experienced such bad service from a waiter and I was appalled at the lack of engagement and attentiveness  he showed.   If the food wasn't as good as it is, i'd highly consider never coming back.",

In its name, why in gods name wouldn't you have a brick oven for True N.Y. Style pizza? False advertising if you ask me. Ditch the conveyer belt and pizza screen! Seriously? The pizza is like eating a puffy loaf of bread with sauce and cheese. Compares to a frozen Freschetta pizza from the supermarket. Nothing like N.Y. Pie and a disappointment. I gave it 2 stars because their wings are excellent and about the only thing authentic. At least to Buffalo NY that is. They haven't a clue about the pizza on the streets of Manhattan. Downtown Korea perhaps....",

But when we were left standing waiting for a table with our daughter and grandchildren because a waitress moved THREE people from a table for FOUR who were already seated  to a booth that would have fit the FIVE of us that was ridiculous. Therefore we had to wait for 15  minutes or more for them to clean another booth which they were in no hurry to get to. I guess our patronage over the year or more we dined there was not appreciated at all !!! There are many other restaurants in town that appreciate your business, obviously the y don't give a damn.",

    "text": "I went to Streets of New York last night and in general was underwhelmed.  In regards to the food, we had the 16\" Pizza with cheese and a medium order of wings, (medium heat).  The wings were passable, although I'm not going to be overly critical as it's a pizza place and I try not to use non-Italian American food to review a place like this. The pizza was fresh and they obviously good quality ingredients but the taste was not in the style of an authentic Pizzeria. The dough just wasn't right for an advertised authentic NY style, (or Neopolitan), pizza.    I was born in Queens and lived on Long Island for 32 years so I think I'm qualified to know what New York style pizza is at this point, and this place is not the real deal. The pizza was okay, but I wasn't bowled over either.   I will say the service was excellent for a busy Friday night and everyone employee I saw there was in good spirits.  The food came out in a timely fashion as well.  The ambiance of the restaurant was nice, although it can get real cramped in a hurry on a busy night.  They do have outdoor seating when the weather warrants as well. All in all this is the kind of place that is good in a pinch or just to change up the routine, but there are better places in the area.",

It took forever for someone to answer the phone, and when they did, I was placed on hold 3-4 times and waited nearly 5 minutes for someone to take what I considered a simple order, a large cheese pizza. The girl told me it would be 45 min to 1 hr. Over an hour had gone by and our pizza still had not been delivered, so I called to see what was going on. Initially they couldn't even figure out what my order was because hey didn't take my name when I initially placed the order. I again was placed on hold at least 3 times and a guy finally told me it would be there soon. After complaining that it had been well over an hour, I expected at least an apology and maybe a discount in a future order...something. But was left even more disappointed. He pizza was finally delivered at 5:45, it took an hour and a half to get 1 pizza. To top it all off, the pizza taste was mediocre. Definitely will never go to, or order from this place again.",

Yes...the delivery driver was too lazy to walk to the front door. And instead of extra ranch dressing, they gave us no ranch dressing. To make matters worse, all of our food was cold. Not warm...but cold!! And my daughter's chicken fingers are burnt. I never give bad reviews but the only thing edible is the cheesecake. I am extremely disappointed, am hungry and out $44.00.",

The street that they created gives somewhat of an outdoor bar hop vibe.. but its design is just a facade. This creates a less than friendly park experience as there is no real parking area unless you get lucky and get a curb spot.  Now on to the actual restaurant. The overall interior design is fairly nice. Its clean and give off a upscale pizza vibe. The pizza on the other hand while being fair at best is priced way too high for the size and quality you are receiving. I tried the \"Pigged Out Pie\" which is basically a basic pizza with pork related toppings. Overall I would give it a 4/10.. it was good, but not worth the price. The pizza was 14.99 and that was only a 10 inch pie and was labeled as large, the traditional large at a good pizza place is 16'. We ordered the chicken fingers which were actually pretty good even though the chicken fingers were small.. the order was 8.95 and only came with chicken fingers.. No celery, carrots, blue cheese, ranch, fries, bread or anything else that would make the order a more complete package. The flavor of the fingers were good though. We also ordered the Beer Cheese Bread which is just bread knots and a bowl of beer cheese.. this was delicious and only costs 5.95. More surprising is the bread is all you can eat so for value and flavor, I see this as the only reason to come here and order something. I did not try any alcohol but the place does have a bar, although a very small bar.  I would give this place a pass and save some money and go to a better pizza place if pizza is what you're looking for.",

With the amount of choice we have here in Las Vegas, I cannot stress enough that FOR THE LOVE OF GOD DO NOT waste your time at this place.  Like many others have said, they cannot get an order right (or a check, for that matter).    We came here every Monday for 10 weeks to play trivia.  We returned each week because we wanted to play trivia, despite the fact that the service was atrocious (orders incorrect, forgotten beverages, cold food, charging regular price instead of happy hour prices, etc.).    This has all come to an end because of the final experience we had last night.  We came to play Vegas Pub Quiz Trivia in a group of ten.  We all ordered dinner and alcohol, purposely spending a little extra to give business to the establishment hosting trivia.  The house music was playing.  As you can imagine, it is next to impossible to concentrate on a DJ-led trivia game with extraneous background noise.  When we asked to have the music turned down (not off) the owner not only didn't make an effort to placate the ten tables of trivia players, but she deliberately turned the music louder. Then she approached the Trivia DJ and let him now that she didn't care what the people wanted.   I will never subject myself, my family, or my friends (and I wouldn't subject my enemies either) to this blatant disregard for customers.  If she is willing to treat loyal customers this way, I shudder to think about how she would treat you.    This would be a great location for a good family-friendly Italian restaurant.  I'm anxiously awaiting a change of ownership!",

Their hot wings are also very good.  I'm not sure what flavoring their \"hot\" uses, but it doesn't seem to be traditional Buffalo-style (which seems a little weird for a place with \"New York\" in its name), but still tasty.  (I'd love to see Buffalo-style as an option, though!).  Their broaster chicken beats any fried chicken as well.",

The cheese steak is not much more than a roll with a very few thinly sliced pieces of steak and some cheese, no peppers or onions, mostly bread!!  Although the name sounds great, trust me that any other NY pizza place in Vegas will be better than this.  So disappointing, especially for the price!",

    "text": "The post-hike dinner has been a personal tradition. After my hiking trail adventure ends, my dining adventure begins. Today, after hiking up in the Sawmill trails of the Spring Mountains National Recreation Area, I set out for the Streets of New York. It was a logical choice. I am a New York transplant that loves his pizza and subs.      It took work to find the Streets of New York on account of the fact that the streets of northwest Las Vegas are so confusing in the vicinity of the US 95 and the 215 exits. Streets of New York is located in a pedestrianised street that looks like Town Square. In similar style to Town Square, customers can park on the Main Street or in a parking lot at the back of the building.      Streets of New York is a casual sit down restaurant with extended booths and tables where televisions showing professional sports provide entertainment. When I walked into the restaurant, the host and waitress invited me to sit anywhere. I'd chose a long booth. After hiking, I appreciated the comfort of the plush booth.      Now for the menu. I was hoping that they offered my favorite sandwich, which is an eggplant parmesan on toasted bread that the pizzerias on my streets of New York offer without fail. But not these Streets of New York. The menu features New York pizza where their customers have a variety of choices and sizes in pies and slices, sandwiches including pastrami, and the meatball parmesan sub. What truly reached from the Streets of New York to the heart of my soul was their broaster chicken. This is where I was aware I was on the streets to a rewarding dining adventure.     It was only recently that Chilly Jilly'z at the other end of the continent Boulder City turned me into a fan of broaster chicken. When I set eyes on Streets of New Yorks special menu of broaster chicken, my mind was set on the two piece white meat broaster chicken meal. It included a chicken breast and wing, a 4 ounce side that I picked coleslaw and two potato wedges. It was also supposed to include bread that they never gave me. Oh well! The food was so filling and tasty that I had forgot all about the bread. The chicken breast was a large portion where the chicken wing was sufficient. The two potato wedges were large. Regardless that the potato wedges tasted fine they fell short of Chilly Jilly'z, that up to the time of this review is the best that I ever had. The cole slaw was a nice size portion and tasted average. All this food wasn't bad for $6.25 before tax. But, I have to have a fountain drink with my dinner. Especially a post-hike dinner. The Cokes, that didn't have a dint of flatness and that the waitress refilled in a timely manner brought the dinner up to nearly $10 before the tip.     After my leading dining adventure at Streets of New York, there is still more adventure that awaits. I truly want to try their New York pizza. Maybe this is first-rate New York pizza. My dilemma is that there are miles of streets of Las Vegas to reach Streets of New York. However, sometime in the future I am leaning toward a dining adventure in their Spring Valley location to explore their New York pizza.",

The restaurant had a only a few tables so I'm not sure if take out orders were delaying them but she quickly brushed our table to the side. My family's pizza arrived just before I left, when we ask if it was the pepperoni pizza she looks at it and says\" i think so\" then quickly hurried away. The service I can ignore what I can not ignore is what I discovered in my salad. Two bites into my salad I discovered a fly. I am so appalled that I do not have words.

We ordered 2 sandwhiches a #7 and a chicken Parmesan , 2 salads, and canolis. $50 When we finally had the food delivered, we only were given the salads and canoli. We were so excited and so hungry I was so irritated that we had to call and wait another 20 minutes for my food to come back. When i opened my sandwich, the chicken Parmesan, the chicken was obviously old, and was too hard to enjoy. The bread was hard as a rock, and it was literally inedible. The #7 was ok. The bread was super hard as well. I barely touched my salad. There was too much brown lettuce and it was soggy before I even put dressing on it.   The canoli was not good either. It was just covered in nasty hershey syrup. My 8 year old who eats anything wold not eat more than a bite. I would NOT recommend ordering from this place. It was a huge waste of $50. I could have paid less, and had better food from dominos (which I don't enjoy ordering from) If you live in this area and want a good sandwich or pizza, go to rosattis. Its around the same price range, but I have never been disappointed.",

The GF ordered up the \"make you own pasta.\"  The sauce was tasty and she added pepperoni to the mix.  I believe the call it \"Angles with dirty faces.\"  There were no issues with her requests.  I settled on Ultimate New York Cheese Steak. The roast bead was thin and awesome.  The onions and mushroom made it pop!  The Alfredo/Provolone sauce was awesome.

    "text": "This is definitely a mixed review. I showed up for Monday night trivia, which made for a completely packed restaurant as there just isn't a lot of space inside and they didn't have outdoor seating when we showed up. Trivia was fun, but because it was packed, service was pretty slow (it took almost 10 minutes for us to find a seat - it was \"seat yourself\" and none of the staff were willing to help, 10 minutes to take a drink order, and 15 minutes to take a food order after the drinks, and my friend actually didn't get her Coke until right before the food showed up, almost an hour after we walked in the place). It was busy, and I get that, but they didn't seem to have a good system in place to begin with - there seemed to be 1 waitress for the whole place and a guy who would just refill drinks. The servers were nice despite the stress, but it just didn't seem to be working out well. When you're hosting an event, put more servers on the schedule!   The menu is pretty big and my whole group had a tough time deciding what to get. As I have Celiac's, I was excited to see that you could make your own gluten free pizza. I ordered one. I was a little hesitant - I figured that in the rush, more mistakes would get made and the risk for cross contamination would be higher - but I was craving pizza and got it against my better judgment. I should have avoided this place altogether. I had a horrible reaction before we even left the restaurant.   That being said, my friends really enjoyed their meals. If you have a food allergy, I would steer clear of this place, but otherwise, it seems like an alright place to grab a bite (though I might avoid trivia night until the crowds die down).",

She was an older gal with dark hair and a chip on her shoulder. We overheard a shorter waitress tell what I assumed was a \"regular\" customer that the area we had sat in was the \"shitty waitress section\". Go figure. We got our beverages quick enough but had a hell of a time trying to get our hands on the advertised complimentary garlic bread on the menu. After taking our food order, this so-called waitress sat next to a \"regular\" customer and chatted him up, then baby sat 2 kids at another table across the room. These kids definitely belonged to one of the restaurant employees. When she finally brought the garlic bread, it was basically the snickle-fritz (crappy leftovers). She said \"This is what's left\". How about you just wait until fresh new bread comes out the oven and then serve me the good stuff, woman??  There was a young man who worked as the busser there, and he was busting his ass. He was basically picking up the slack of our waitress. Since our waitress was MIA, my husband had to go up to the bar and order a beer himself. On top of that, the menu advertises $2 bud light drafts during NFL games. Welp, there was a game on. The shorter waitress and the busser had no idea what he was talking about. But whatever, they figured it out and my husband got his $2 beer after much confusion.      I ordered the Special Ziti Pasta ($11.25) sans the sausage and my better half ordered a calzone with pepperoni, sausage, and onions. Calzones start at $10.25 and each topping, besides the cheese and stuff, is an additional $0.70. Ouch. I was ready to dig in, but oh look honey, there's no silverware. The busser brought us our silverware and the garlic bread that our waitress failed to deliver. The food was pretty good, but bad service always outweighs the food in my opinion.   Our waitress swung by and we ordered dessert, the passion cookie ($5.75). After putting in the order, she unceremoniously placed the tab on the table without a word. The Passion cookie was amazing, way better than BJ's signature poozookie dessert. Too bad I'll never taste that dessert again since I'm never coming back.   The check put an even bigger damper on our mood. The bill came to $37, which is way too expensive for this type of establishment. It's just a local laid back pizzeria, nothing special. Seriously, where do you get off charging $2.90 for fountain drinks? If you want overpriced food and shitty service, eat at Streets. If you're smart, you'll just walk past this pretentious restaurant and go to Leticia's instead.",

Tonight's experience can be summed up as lousy and horrible value for the money. The 14 inch pizza we had was a disgrace. There was BARELY any cheese on it and the sauce and crust were generic quality. I've had many better frozen pizzas out of a box. The cost was ridiculous for the quality of the product . A 14 inch pizza original with cheese only is 15 dollars. Literally, a rip off given the three thimble fulls of cheese on it.That pizza in no way resembled the pizza you see on their website laden with cheese and appealing.  The dinner salad wasn't bad except had to pick out large pieces of lettuce core out of it which should've gone into the garbage can.  A friend had the gluten free pizza and it too was meh at best in terms of flavor. Add Two sodas. Bill 49 dollars. What a rip for that quality, or lack of quality which is more appropriate. Disappointing. This place has really gone down. Take the time to drive to Grimaldi's instead or Giordanos. Much better quality at both places for the money you spend.  Now if only we could get one of these places to come to Centennial we'd have it made!",

    "text": "Streets of New York is very popular in the Phoenix, AZ area and the official pizza of the Arizona Diamond Backs, Phoenix Suns and the Arizona State Sun Devil Stadium. Locations around the Phoenix area are in abundance, but we have a couple locations here in Vegas so I decided to finally give them a try. I stopped in to grab some lunch to-go. I noticed the sign saying \"wait to be seated\" so I stood there and waited, looking around for an employee and didn't see one. I noticed only 1 table with customers inside, so they weren't busy and it was odd that no employees were visibly present at first. After about 5 minutes a girl came out from the back and asked if I was picking up or ordering. I asked if they had any lunch specials or a menu to look at and she gave me a menu and said she'd be back in a few to take my order. After I placed my order it took 25 minutes for the food to finally be ready. It was just 2 cheese slices and that's it, so I can't figure out why it took so long and it would have been nice if the girl who took my order could have communicated with me by letting me know that it was coming out soon, later, something! I felt like she forgot I was there honestly. I must say that when she did take my order and bring it to me she was nice, but there just could have been better acknowledgment so I knew I wasn't forgotten and wondering what was going on.   Lunch specials are daily from 10:30 am - 2:30 pm.   Drinks didn't come with any of the lunch specials and cost $2.90 each.  2 slices with one topping ($6.50) - I didn't want any toppings, just cheese and it still cost me the same price. Most places have a special for cheese slices with drink at a certain price and then they offer slices with one topping and a drink for just a little more. No price difference here they charged me the same regardless. If you want additional toppings it's $.60 each. No drinks come with any of the lunch specials which makes the $6.50 price tag a bit high for this area. It's not a combo or special if it doesn't come with a drink in my opinion and by the time the cost of a drink is tacked on, I might as well go down the street to Metro Pizza instead. The pizza was below average. It's absolutely beyond me why this place is called Streets of New York when the pizza is far from any traditional slice you will find in NY. The slices were not thin, but thick and they weren't shy with the cheese and it was tasty with the seasonings they added on top. The crust was a whole other story and it actually reminded me of frozen Freschetta pizza. I love a nice crispy crust however mine here was hard and dry. Not even the piled and delicious cheese on the top could save the rock hard crust. Maybe it was an off day, but I can't see hurrying back.   Inside they have booths and tables. Aside from pizza they also have subs and pasta. If you are a fan of Broaster chicken they have that also and you can get just chicken, baskets or family meals.",

    "text": "I love this little pizza place and I've never had a bad meal.  I usually get take-out and the pizza is at my place usually within 30-40 minutes even though they say 45.    I'm very, very picky about tomato sauce and marinara sauce in that I don't like them at most pizza places (especially the marinara).  But here, however, the tomato sauce is excellent.  The crust isn't doughy and the cheese and toppings taste fresh.  I've had their caesar salad, also, and have never been disappointed.  I usually order the formaggio pizza, and it's my absolute favorite.  It's not on the menu anymore, but they will still make it.    I know people like to compare pizzas (to New York ones, for instance), but really people should judge the pizza on its own merit, regardless of the name of the place.  I don't know whether this pizza is like a NY pizza or not...some say it isn't, and it's always New Yorkers who complain about out-of-state pizza (sorry New Yorkers, it's True!)      I don't understand some of these reviews.  When I've gone in to pick up a pizza, have one delivered, or dined in, the staff has been nothing but friendly and I've had nothing but good service.  I took a friend from out of town there and she loved it, too.    They always seem busy, especially on weekends, but fairly steady during the week as well when I've stopped in.  That's a good sign.  This is the only place I order pizza from now.",

Everytime I walk into this restaurant, it seems as though they don't want me there. The owner is always sitting around doing paperwork at one of the tables. She throws the menus on the table and says your waiter will be with you. Although the restaurant was completely empty tonight, we still had trouble getting refills on our drinks. At the end of the meal I got a whopping $60 bill. I feel slighted because I had poor service and mediocre food. The only reason I go to this restaurant every once in awhile is because Metro pizza is too full. I don't recommend this restaurant to anybody and hope they go out of business so we can get somebody else with better food and service in there.",

Warm romaine lettuce with bottles dressing, whoopie. The cheese pizza was for some reason cut into 16 squares (14 inch round pizza) and was cold. So I'm guessing it's been sitting around for a bit. Way more sauce than cheese, crust was like hardened cardboard. Looks like a Red Baron frozen pizza that's been sitting on the counter for an hour. Total bummer. Gotta eat it because I paid for it but really? So many better places within the same distance. Disappointed I gave it a try. 14 bucks for a crappy medium pizza is pretty bad. This is nothing like the pizza from the \"streets of New York\". Maybe it was a bad batch but I'm really disappointed. Guess I'll stick to the other joints.",

We won't stop going by any means, but worth mentioning -- just make sure you're prepared for a little wait --  it is worth it.  :)   My favorite is their Spinach Salad, and my kids love their pizza and chicken fingers.

The first mistake we encountered was them not having the pizza ready for pick-up and we figured that sometimes things happen. The server wasn't too friendly about it which raised some eyebrows. We decided to try again and chalked it up to a bad day because our dine-in experience had been great. However, the same problem happened again and they were quite rude about it. The pizza hadn't even been made yet and they proceeded to tell my wife it would just be 5 minutes as she watched them start from scratch. When she confronted them about it the kid just rolled his eyes and ignored her. My wife came home and called to speak to the manager and they put her on hold and never picked up. She then contacted their corporate office and received no reply. I like their pizza, but not their take-out service; they are mostly rude and because of this we will not be returning.",

Isn't it common practice to just provide those things regardless of who's delivering!?  Anywho, my order was incorrect and an item was missing. I called and let them know about the mistake. I spoke to a female manager and she, at first, said she would deliver the item missing and fix my order and provide 20% of for next delivery. I was ok with this. About 10 minutes later the manager calls back and says that they have never in their history of business existence have they had an online error. I told the Manager that I paid a hefty amount for my food and just wanted it to be fixed. She said it was my error and they have never made an online mistake. This is just craziness that a buisness has never made an error before!!!! This totally ruined my football and UFC night with friends. I will never order from this pizza place AGAIN. Horrible customer service, calling their customers liars!!! Please take a screen shot of your online order if ordering from this place!!!",

REALLY like we want garlic bread that everyone has touched. When the food comes out, i ordered chicken parm, what a joke it was a bunch of old spaghetti with a piece of chicken on top it looked so bad that i did not even eat it. Although my husband's pizza was good . While we were eating they started cleaning the floors around us putting chairs up on table's while we were eating,  right next to us .The sever never checked on us gave us our check while we were still eating , we asked if we could have coffee and dersert she had attuide was SO RUDE!! So I called and talked to the owner the next day and told her what had happened and she was so nice and gave us credit and wanted us to come back so we did , should have never went back food was good the service was good Sterling was our server. With that said, it was my step daughters birthday and we had told him ,  wanted him to bring a cake with a candle which he never did .Had to ask in front of her for a dessert brought but  NO CANDLE charge us for the dersert which that's fine but no candle and did not ofter coffee , think he forgot took so long went and found him and said can we have check we were going to the movies .
