It was my first time and I was very impressed. It's not too big so get there early. Oh I was smart enough to take the Terra Massoud home with me and enjoy did email Inslee. I'll be going back.",

I really can't say bad things about this place. Some say the service is slow as a dine-in, and it can be sometimes, but it's not like employees are on their cellphones messing around. They're usually doing something for someone else or something in the back like their side work. I haven't experienced such slow service that would make a experience a bad one.",

    "text": "Stopped in last night to check out the new neighborhood eats.  Before going in, we totally expected this to be a very American spaghetti spot that the kids would love and were hoping for a free pass on cooking dinner once a month.  Sufficed to say, this isn't that place.  Not that the little ones didn't enjoy the spaghetti and meatballs, but the food quality is nothing like what you'd get at the major US chains.  This place is authentic and delicious!  The adults ordered fish entrees; Salmon Pink Vodka Linguini and Cod Fra Diavolo.  I'll start by saying, the fish in both dishes was amazing!  The salmon was moist and firm and the vodka sauce was creamy and delicious.  The cod in my dish was perfectly cooked!  Light and flaky in a very rich spicy diavolo sauce.  Not as spicy as some I've had, but very garlicy and rich!  The portion sizes are huge, as would be expected at any real Italian establishment.  Our waitress brought the dishes out, and immediately brought to-go containers and set them on the side for us.  I'm no quitter, so I finished my plate and went into pasta coma later on the sofa, but the other 2 dishes were barely noticeably dented before packing up for leftovers tonight (yay...no cooking 2 nights in a row!).   One of the most impressive things we notice and loved is that every order that is placed gets personally prepared in view of the customers.  We watched as the ladies behind the counter carefully prepared each dish and served them up.  No mass production here!  If there was any criticism at all, I have to say that the patio furniture type chairs were somewhat uncomfortable.  When eating pasta, I tend to almost stick my face in the dish to mitigate twirling pasta sauce projectiles from reaching my shirt, which is almost inevitable. We also considered hosting a kids b-day part here, but the tiny quaint space is pretty limited.  Very intimate for small groups and conversation.  Maybe more suited for a date night with a couple glasses of wine.  Overall a nice place and delicious food!  Definitely will be back to try some other dishes.",

What better way to catch up other than over good food and wine? The food!!! I haven't had anything that hasn't tasted like a home cooked meal here. The calamari is the softest I've ever had and seasoned so well! Last night we tried the mushroom app for the first time which I'd order again. You can never go wrong with meatballs. I don't typically order chicken when I'm out although I've tried 3 chicken dishes here so far. All of them were amazing; full of taste, fresh and the portions generous. We've tried multiple pasta dishes too. Red sauce, oil & garlic, pink sauce... All fantastic! The only problem is we needed more bread to finish the sauce after our pasta was done. Lastly, the desserts. I would recommend ordered the tiramisu for an app. If there is anything you have to have its their tiramisu. Hand down the best I've ever had. Don't trust me try it yourself. Make a reservation! Although it's worth the wait if you don't.",

I went in a little before closing on a Wednesday and ordered the lasagna to go.  I think it was about $11.85 with tax.  When I got home the container that the lasagna was in was smaller than a Big Mac box.  While it was tastey, I thought based on what came home with me, they were way over priced.  There was also a picece of garlic bread.  It had huge chunks of garlic.  I really liked it, because I love garlic, but I know the rest of my family would have said it had too much garlic.",

    "text": "This place has \"upped\" their game with the new seating/bar addition and the remodel of the old space!  The atmosphere is casual but well-done: cozy and warm; NOT loud; with just the right scale of bar to booths to tables.  The separation between restaurant and take-out/deli area is great - people waiting for those services aren't standing around in the restaurant area taking up space.  I love that it is NOT a sport's bar with gaming machines stuck in the bar top and huge TV's on every wall.  It does NOT have a blaring sound system - you can actually talk to the person across the table from you - how refreshing!  They haven't packed the space with tables, so you aren't sitting on top of the people next to you.  The service staff is friendly and professional and seem invested in their workplace.  This is not a place for large groups - no banquet room/separate room.  This isn't a \"kiddie\" place - it's a grown-up establishment that can accommodate children who eat more than \"chicken nuggets\".  The food is great:  warm, crusty bread with seasoned olive oil for a dip; David's Milan Salad is extraordinary; the pizza dough is made fresh daily and the pizza's are HOT out of the oven & are gourmet style (not meat heavy); the lasagna and ravioli were so good!  The chopped salad looked awesome and the antipasto plate was delicious!  The desserts are made in-house and are fresh and light: tiramisu, creme puffs, cheesecake, cannoli, tiny fruit creme pies.  They are currently wine & beer only; but expect a full liquor license by the middle of July. Definitely the best place in the Southern Highlands area for a meal out with friends or a casual dining experience for guests in town.",

I was worried that, with all the improvements, the quality of the food wouldn't be the same..... but NO! The food was still A1!! Everyone was delighted with their meals. The wait staff (Alex) was superb and so accommodating with our special requests. Between the atmosphere, food and the singing, it was truly our pleasure to spend our evening here.

Loved the music they had playing. It was three of us so we decided to start off with the Caesar salad (which is enough to share). One of the best Caesar salads I've had in awhile. For an Appetizer we had the Calamari... Another hit!!! I liked that it came with three lightly breaded shrimps as well.... Thanks! Me and my mom shared the chicken piccata. Ok....so I must say I'm extremely hard to please with chicken piccata. Mostly because most places have zero clue on how to make it. I can honestly say this is one of the best chicken piccata's I've ever had. My aunt had the shrimp scampi with linguine in red sauce. She loved it as well. I'll definitely be back soon. So glad we found this gem :)",

I have recently moved to  area and I have driven by a number of times and finally thought that we would come by and try it out for dinner. Am I ever glad that we did!!!  From the welcome we received at the door until the heartfelt goodbye when we left, the entire experience was absolutely excellent.   Our waiter, Clemente (sp?)was authentic and engaging. He made a wonderful dining experience even better. He really went over and above.   What can I say about the food - absolutely the best Italian I have had in Vegas. The sauces were superb. The tiramisu was sublime.   If I could offer one bit of constructive criticism (and I'm only doing this out of respect for their obvious expertise in the area) I think they could perhaps look at the \"wine situation\" as an area of possible improvement. Instead of only selling wine by the glass or bottle I would highly recommend that they adopt the method utilized by Batista's hole in the wall- that being that they offer a decent of house wine and utilize the small traditional \" tumbler\" style  wine glasses found in authentic Italian restaurants. Having the option to get a decanter of house wine would be a major addition to an already wonderful and authentic Italian experience.    I am not one to give high Yelp reviews. In fact, I have been accused of being very harsh . But, I have to give a A-  to A rating ( only the wine situation preventing it from being a solid A!)  This is now our \"go to Italian restaurant \"in Vegas.  Douglas Carle Carle Law Office",

I tried the meat balls which were also great. A couple of the men had the Italian sausage/peppers sandwich. They were huge and both said they would come back. Two people had pasta with different sauces. Delicious.  Atmosphere, small but cozy. I am sure the happy hour is wonderful. Our wait staff was so prompt and attentive. We want to go again soon.

We are used to mom making spaghetti every Sunday with homemade sauce that she starts making in the morning. Let me tell you, this place is the closest to mom's that I've had. The sauce, the meatballs, the sausage...it's all amazing. We always start off with some antipasto.  The spread they serve beats what I ate during my trip to Italy.  I have my favorites here but I've branches out and tried other dishes like the lasagna, linguini and claims and of course the pizzas.  They were all delicious.

We ordered our food and they brought out some delicious bread to enjoy while we waited. And waited and waited and waited. 30 minutes to get our food whole we watched the people who were sat after us get their food first (this is why I am giving 4 stars).  I got the lobster ravioli and my husband got the ribeye.  Ravioli was GREAT!  Good amount of lobster and I loved the mini shrimp in the sauce.  My husband didn't care for the ribeye, this was on their special list for the evening but nothing special about it.  We also tried the meatballs and penne pasta which was excellent, kids ate those up quickly!  Ended the meal with their chocolate cake which was very moist and tasty.  Overall this place was really good and the staff was friendly.  We would return, probably just go earlier so we wouldn't have to wait so long for our food!",

    "text": "DO go here for excellent food! I had the house salad and the sole fillet and both were amazing. My sister had the penne vodka with sun dried tomatoes from the specials list and she had equally great things to say.  Space is limited to maybe 10 tables so if you plan to go during peak dining times, getting a table will prove difficult. We arrived at 4pm and all but 2 tables filled.   DO NOT go here for fast service or for friendly staff (unless you know people that work there). I was rudely ignored when I entered the restaurant by a man who later introduced himself to others as Pasquale. He saw people he knew who arrived after me and greeted/hugged them, sat them, got them waters and 2 appetizers before we had even received an ice water. The server we had cared little that we were there which aligns with other Yelp reviews of this restaurant. The woman who brought out our entrees was however the most friendly and personable employee at that establishment. It's too bad she wasn't our server.  I will return the following expectation: that service will not be great nor fast but that the quality of food will be worth the trip.",

Chicken marsala was comparable with a cafe in a good locals casino, albeit served fresh and piping hot from the kitchen which the cafes often struggle to do. Tasty but priced higher than I would've expected. The pizza, however, was very disappointing. The texture of the crust was excellent, crisp and bubbly, but it lacked taste. The sauce was very basic and the cheese unimpressive. There are plenty of better options for pizza across the city, many of which are excellent. Overall, the food does not do justice to the quality of the staff working there.",

    "text": "Clever name, a take on the sub-genre of Western films, except with a \"y\" at the end. Possibly to sound more \"Americanized\", like they did when changing the spelling of the last names when immigrants arrived through Ellis Island. The menu pays homage to the old films with sandwiches named after them, like \"Hang 'Em High\" and the \"Magnificent Seven\".   Greeted at the door by Andrea, he immediatley started telling me all about the meats and cheeses in the deli case. A thick Italian accent, and a very enthusiastic sales pitch, we started talking about where he is from in Northern Italy, he went on to tell me all about his products in the store. The place is small, but they have a pretty extensive menu.    One of my favorite things in life is a charcuterie and a cheese board, complete with a glass of wine. I now have this in my neighborhood. Pretty large selection of imported Italian cheese as well as imported cold cuts like: speck, prosciutto crudo, soppressata, mortadella and your usual salami and pastrami. The cheese is what really peaked my interest, the gorgonzola was off the charts delicious. A strong bite, this is not your usual gorgonzola that we are used to. Fontina and Asiago rounded up my tasting.   They have an assortment of pastas, some made in house, some imported from Italy (they are frozen) as well as house favorites like eggplant parm and steak milanese. Also available are some housemade desserts (try the Tiramisu, it was fantastic) as well as imported Bindi Cakes. They do have beer and wine available as well. They offer seasonal specials, like rice arancini, which I will definitely come back to try. Andrea said they do cater, and they also offer cheese/cold cut trays.   This is a True Italian Deli, don't come in looking for a turkey sandwich and complain that they don't have it. It's not Subway. \"Whattsa matta you\"!",

No matter the case one thing you will find is good food, great service, affordable prices, and  small business owner that cares about customers from minute walk in. Bonus if urge too take some fresh parmesan cut from block, deli cuts, or even fresh dessert serve by the piece too go Spaghetty Western has you covered all ways Italian.  The restaurant set up like standard deli restaurant. Not many tables but also bar stool area that can eat on. The menu have paper menu look at and also computerized version too look at hanging from at the wall. Sneaky but make sure check the specials of the day on chalkboard off too the side. They do great job of explaining the specials that day if you miss it.   I ordered the Spaghetty Western since carb loading for 50miler bike ride next day. So thinking heavy pasta dish with protein and pasta. The Spaghetty Western is solid choice. The spaghetty (believe fresh tasted like too me) combine with the sausage, pancetta, and peas really nice light tomato sauce was awesome. Not heavy loaded with pure chunks of tomato or too think that not much of sauce. It had the right balance. The pancetta and sausage could eat by itself! Sure would order anything with either one of those meats on the menu. It came with order of garlic bread. It not often would rage about garlic bread comes with you entree. Garlic Bread showed me much they care about the little things even though comes with my entree. Two pieces had nice spread of butter, garlic, and chopped parley. Besides it came out HOT crispy garlic bread. The portion size was great not too mention very affordable.   The only negative comment would say is that stack of dirty plates that sitting on table next too me the whole time. Not sure if lack of staff cause small business. Still nothing that would stop me from coming back for more pasta or trying more of the menu. The desserts all look great and definitely yelpers rave about. I make sure leave room next time. If in the area in need of solid Italian food not going break the bank need too stop in and no worries about the corny name. Never judge book by its cover my friends...",

I'm sure a lot of people can understand this sentiment and even have their own person who makes the best sauce ever. Now, with that being said, I say this place comes in at a solid second, which is about as good as it gets.  I LOVE their tomato sauce. One of my favorite dishes is the Chicken Milanese. It is a simple dish, however, its simplicity really allows all of the flavor to come through and it's delicious! Another dish I really enjoy is the Pasta Carbonara and my husband loves the Pasta Diablo.  The staff is also great and I just love coming here! I even get to brush up a little on my basic Italian skills which makes me happy. xD Great hole-in-the-wall Italian place!",

And I say this because tables that were seated well after us were served. We ordered garlic bread and it never came. We spoke to the waitress when she tried to clear a salad plate and told her that we were waiting for the garlic bread. Our entrees came out, no garlic bread. They cleared the salad plate and I asked them to cancel the garlic bread. Waitress came back and said she thought we wanted it with the entree. Half way through our meal the garlic bread came out and we had to remind them to cancel it.   Food quality is questionable. Or maybe it was a bad cook making the chicken Parmesan. Either way, we received a rubber chicken that was supposed to be chicken Parmesan. Sent that back.   I don't know. The restaurant is inconsistent. We did enjoy their meatballs. They've got balls!

Alex our server was awesome, food delivery was on point for a large party, drinks were overflowing!  We ordered three large meat and cheese platters to start off for our group and brought a few bottles to start (with corkage fee), after that each couple was able to get their own separate checks!  Everyone raved about the food and service! We are definitely a fun group and this staff was able to deliver!  I saw friends having  gin flights, wine flights, and specialty drinks!  We've been here more than a few times and lately I've been getting the chicken piccata(OMG delicious), my husband loves the bolognese.  I've also had the lasagna, spaghetti and meatballs and those are always soooo good!!!  I love their Cesar salad!  Btw the seating was very comfortable, and easy to move around and talk to other couples- I was very impressed with how they handled a large group in a small restaurant!",

Sooo good it just sucks that the portion is smaller than what I would normally eat. However for a normal person it would be just enough.  Francese - Lightly egg battered chicken with lemon butter sauce. Again sooo good but my fatass can eat both items.   This is really a hidden gem as both items we had were done really well in an area you wouldn't expect this great of food would come from.",

Great food! Great staff! Great Vibe! The owner came by our table to make sure everything was well. As we chatted I felt as if we knew Dave for a long time.  We will definitely be back with the whole family next time.   When your in the mood for delicious Italian give Spaghetty Western a try. The name doesn't do this restaurant justice.",

Me and my girlfriend celebrated took a chance and went there to celebrate our anniversary since we were both craving Italian food and the pictures and reviews here on Yelp were fantastic. The ambiance is great, somewhat informal but definitely still nice enough for a romantic dinner. We happened to luckily enough come in on a Tuesday where live music was playing. There was a nice gentleman singing and playing piano in the corner who even asked each guest in the restaurant if they had any requests. He sang not one but two of my favorite classic songs, Stand By Me and Sittin' on the Dock of the Bay, wonderfully I may add. Apparently he sings Tuesdays and Thursdays. It was a lovely background while we ate, which we really dug in! We got the meatball appetizer which were DELICIOUS. My girlfriend and I love meatballs so we had our standard set very high and these did not disappoint. They were tender and seasoned, they practically melt in your mouth. For main dishes I got one of the specials which was ravioli in truffle oil with mushrooms while my girlfriend got the chili version of their classic lasagna. My ravioli was divine, perfectly cooked, there was a ton of mushrooms which I loved and the truffle oil was delicious! My girlfriend's lasagna was huge and super meaty. She only finished half but it wasn't because it wasn't yummy, it was very filling! I ate all of my ravioli but the serving was large. We also got complimentary bread, not just one but two baskets. We ordered cannolis to go as well, chocolate rather than plain, and those were fantastic!! All in all, with literally three courses and even after taking some home, the bill was $56 which I deemed extremely reasonable and well worth it. Not to mention how attentive and wonderful our waitress was, Peggy. She recommended the special and was so nice and helpful without being overbearing. She was wonderful and we felt very comfortable! We will definitely be coming back soon!",

I had the carbonara and my husband ordered the vodka penne. Both dishes were good but nothing extraordinary.  I will give this place props for having a diverse wine list, with reasonable pricing. They don't gouge you as much as other places do for ordering wine by the glass.  Our server was polite, but it was clear he was trying to upsell every chance he got. Not a big deal but it was really apparent and lacked finesse.  All in all, if you haven't tried this place I would say give it a try. The prices were good, wine was great, and food was decent. We probably won't go out of our way to come back, but it's worth giving a a shot.",

Stay away from the soups and salads and just get to the heart of the menu. The appetizers, pastas and entrees. All sensational and their red sauce is divine. You can't beat the happy hour either - $4 drinks! Must have some dessert. The best tiramisu in town. I love that there is more lady fingers than mascarpone. Vegetarian friendly.  I get the meatballs to go (without the sauce) for my dogs. They love it but note there is garlic and onion in there so I only give a tiny bit. I met the owner, charming guy from NJ. Says he knows he missed out on money because he didn't add gaming but to be frank - that's why I like it! I'm more upset that he's an Eagles fan! If you're lucky to get Joe as a server you are in for a great meal from start to finish. This is a place that you should drive across town for at least once to try it.",

I found this place to be quaint and cozy for locals. Service was a bit slow but adequate. We order the calamari which looked good but undercooked and chewy. The chicken piccata left much to be desired. The chicken was tough and the sauce was bland. The addition of red pepper flakes couldn't help this dish. The tiramisu tasted frozen and thawed. My piece came with a small plastic wrapper in the dessert which was a huge turn off. I'm not sure if I'd give this place another try but maybe I'll check out the deli if I'm down that way again.",

Restaurant quality food to go is what gets me through to work in this busy city. And even though they forgot my garlic bread but made it on the spot in 5 minutes along with misquoted pricing in which the cashier apologized and honored the original price, these mistakes are easily accessible by their wonderful food and service.   This city is very competitive & I strongly recommend this cozy little restaurant. They recently expanded with a nice restaurant/bar, from just being more of a fast food pickup restaurant. Wish they had delivery. Not a fan of bite or grubhub. Fees are too expensive, and I'd rather spend more involved the food and not all the fees.   On to the food, penne Bobbi is to die for. Not too saucy but a wonderful pink vodka sauce with prosciutto, sundried tomatoes, and garlic. Which should be served with garlic bread but thankfully I ordered some. Also must order Alex's salad, spring mix, sundried tomatoes, red peppers, artichokes. salami, olives, asiago cheese, and balsamic glaze. Everything is fresh. Little pricey but well worth it, always in support of small business owners. Screw olive garden, it's offensive to real Italian food.",

    "text": "Spaghetty Western is one of my favorite Italian restaurants in Vegas. My review is so long overdue, it's not even funny! I promise I wasn't trying to keep it a secret, I've just been busy with school. For starters, as you can see by all of my checkins, I'm a regular and the current Duchess. I love all of the staff. The food is as good at it gets. This is a great local spot.  Alex, the waiter is an awesome guy and holds a special place in my heart! There's also a really nice Italian lady whose name I don't know but she's great too & her son is adorable. He's sometimes there at the restaurant coloring or doing school work. He's extremely well behaved. I don't remember the new owner's name either but he's friendly and personable and he's always smiling. The chef, Jason, is a prodigy. Anything he cooks, he cooks well. And he looks good doing it too. Haha! Once you get to know the staff, they'll remember your order, etc. It's the extra little touches that Spaghetty Western provides that mean a lot.  If you are missing something from a restaurant that discontinued your favorite dish, went out of business, or is no longer local, tell the staff here what was in it and presto you are eating the same version if not better. It's pretty incredible how well Jason hits the ball out of the park every single time I eat here.   The two dishes I always order and recommend are:   My #1 Go-To Dish which is Penne ala Vodka with Prosciutto, Sundried Tomato and Roasted Garlic. This is now an item on the menu under \"Anytime Specials\" since I ordered it so much and some of you Yelpers out there have been ordering it too because of my uploading photos here, according to the staff. Call it \"The Bobbi\" because it's easier... and they'll know I sent you. :) <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/spaghetty-western-las-vegas?select=w0eJjvV0cZTywH4qt0dDiw&userid=ZcFB7xOpJufgX9hHPFh9mQ#1Hn77oj0HISqWbqOzn69AA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/spag...</a>  Another Fave... Gnocchi with a mixture of Fra Diovolo & Meat Sauces, Diced Tomatoes, Sun-Dried Tomatoes, Sliced Garlic and Basil.  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/spaghetty-western-las-vegas?select=w0eJjvV0cZTywH4qt0dDiw&userid=ZcFB7xOpJufgX9hHPFh9mQ#BW_UpEbq25kMbC6Ol3Kf0Q\">yelp.com/biz_photos/spag...</a>  I've been a customer since the very beginning and I'm not going anywhere. The atmosphere is really nice and it's come a long way since it first opened. It is a small place but it is cozy. They'll make you feel right at home. I recommend you stop by and check it out if you happen to be on the south side of town. And please leave me a comment and let me know what you think of my favorite dish.",

The place was quite small but spacious. We ordered the mussels for appetizers which were good but I should've ordered the clams. For dinner we ordered the spaghetti with meatballs, the Bobbi ( I added chicken) and lobster ravioli. Before dinner and appetizers, they brought us a basket of warm bread and olive oil to dip. The dinner later came and apparently they forgot to add the chicken to my plate (the Bobbi) but he server brought it after and told  me he wasn't going to charge me for the inconvenience. With that said, I got to say that the service was great! They were very attentive and welcoming. Overall I would definitely come back here again and recommend this place.",

The last few times the pasta was undercooked and this last time (about 2 weeks ago) the bread it comes with was no longer garlic bread, it was plain white bread, no butter.     After reading some of the reviews it seems to do with the expansion (change of ownership or chef?). I can't honestly say, but when we first started ordering (which by the way, they still had delivery), it was absolutely delicious! Now it's gotten mediocre for the price. I'm hoping the next time will be better. And they bring back delivery!",

We were right by the door and watched two tables got their water fast then ordered before us, wow! Attempted to waive them down again nothing. yes, they were busy but they only had maybe six tables in the whole place. Maybe because I had gym clothes on and we were not dressed to the fives like the other patrons but damn! I was really looking forward to trying their food again but I guess they didn't feel like serving us today. This place must be making too much money so they can pick and choose their customers now. Hit or miss so good luck with this place and enjoy the wait time.   P.S don't come hungry !",

The prices are a mid range, but given the taste and service, I definitely think it's worth it.

Nice & Tender and packed with flavor!  The Chicken Marsala was incredible, had to sop up the sauce with garlic bread!!  The only issue is the setting... It's not very \"romantic\" nor perfect... it's an Italian deli with a kitchen & stove right behind the counter.  It is fun and nice to see your food being cooked.  It's quite small inside as well.  Food is awesome though, so give it a try, especially if you live in the area!",

I got to enjoy lunch with the owner David, and at his recommendation, we ordered the Alex Chopped salad, Pasta a Fagiola soup, Baked Butternut Squash Ravioli and a pepperoni and olive pizza. Finished up with Tiramisu dessert. Amazing. Stella Artois draft beer was a nice touch! Don't let the name fool you. This is not Olive Garden or some other generic Italian restaurant. Take a look at the menu. Cacio e Pepe and butternut squash ravioli is not on every Italian menu, so I consider that a win. Also, this place is perfect for someone with a certain craving or medical condition (i.e. expectant mothers, foodies, food allergies, picky eaters, etc.) because they will adjust anything on the menu to your liking per the owner. That's great service!",

    "text": "The food is always very good here.  However don't attend for holidays like Valentines.... quite the disaster... 1 waiter (Joe) for the entire dining area... Had a reservation for 6:00.... was not able to be seated until 6:25... We sat at the bar to have a drink and kill time... as soon as the bartender found out we were just having drinks and not food.... it was like we didn't exist.  We were seated in a favorite table (by chance)... Joe (waiter) came to see if we wanted drinks about 15 minutes after we were seated.... joe was not his normal happy self.... very short and stressed.  We ordered another round of drinks and apps..... The food is so good!!!!  Another 15 minutes apps came out and we ordered dinner... and some drinks.... apps were awesome... the chef and back of the house are always spot on.... front of the house not so good this night!  Way to busy for one person to handle, should have had a back up plan if someone called out sick??  We received dinner food is so good!!!  Dessert,  well we got it to go.... had more plans for the evening and with the slow service .... etc we didn't have time to enjoy... got home later that evening.... dessert was not what we ordered!  So food for thought, normally service is better then we received this evening.... the constant... is the food!  Back of the house carries this restaurant, so keep that in mind!  150.00 $ for 2 people plus tip... disappointing for the service we received this night!  Lloyd K. Henderson Locals",

    "text": "I hate to have to update this with a negative review but hey... Bottom line is there is no consistency. There have been issues since they restaurant expanded and reopened. I have been waiting and giving time for the \"growing pains\" to pass, but 3+ months is long enough. We come weekly for the most part, so we are regulars and used to love this place above all others.  1- Almost every time we come something is wrong with our order. Tonight my son's sandwich had sauce on it when I asked for it on the side. Then my fettuccine pesto was cheesy, as in cheese added in to the sauce. That wouldn't be a problem if that is what I  ordered or if that was even the standard for the pesto sauce. Usually when I get the pesto there is no cheese in the sauce. This is just the example of tonight. I have a laundry list I could share.  2- Staff changes a lot. I know how hard it is to hire and retain good people, but this is probably part of the food issue too.  3- That guy. His name is David, or Dave, is what I've been told. On one occasion he was pushy, and spoke to me like I was new here, and told me that I really needed reservations from now on if I come on a Friday. Another time I was here at lunch time and he was walking around loudly reprimanding the kitchen staff. Another time he was literally standing next to my husband waving his arm around my husbands head, yelling \"hey\", attempting to get a waiters attention to take care of something. The other owners just take care of things themselves, like clearing tables if needed. He also hits on the clientele. I have a friend that used to sit at the bar and won't even come alone any more because of him. Also, I read another negative Yelp review and his response was absolutely so unprofessional, and argumentative, I was enraged for the other person. I don't know him personally, and this isn't a personal attack. This is legitimate accounts of what I've personally seen.   They have some wonderful staff that have been here for years, and we love to see them when we come. It is really like hanging out with family when they are here. The owners, not David, are amazing. I am always so happy when I see they are here and love to watch them interacting with everyone. However, I always let them know when there is an issue and it's still on going. So maybe reviews for all to see will inspire them to make some changes.",

They said 10 min, but it was more like 20+ min. So I guess come here only if you have a reservation. The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is because the food is decent. It's not the best I've had, but better than Pizza Hut to go.   Edited to add: I dropped my review to 1 star. The portions are not your normal big sized pasta portions. My husband ordered the ravioli and my 20 month old was able to finish it all, and she's tiny (20 lbs) with a small appetite.  Don't plan on sharing your meal, even with a small child.

First review: I don't like to give bad reviews but the food and service was so bad I feel like I need to spare others.   I ordered the cacio e pepe and I'm not joking when I say it was mainly whole pepper corns and that it was like the bottle fell in. The entire bottom of my bowl was black and most of the pieces of penne were filled as well. The service was super disjointed and our garlic bread was forgotten. We hadn't been served dinner but were already being solicited to have food boxed up for our son. But the main thing is that the food just wasn't that good (not my awful pasta, but salad, dessert, etc). Everyone has an off night so I would normally go back, but $100+ for two adults and a child to eat dinner that was mostly edible seems bizarre in a town full of amazing restaurants.",

I had some of my cousin's Caesar salad which was amazing as well. The service was on point.

    "text": "This was my first experience with Spaghetty Western, but I went with family who had been once before and loved it.  Unfortunately, the consensus was that this visit provided very sub-par service.   We were seated right away; the dining room is small and a bit cramped.  This is sort of a \"hole in the wall\" Italian place, but sometimes those can have the best food.   The theme is perfect for their name with a combination of Italian and Western decor (check out the horses in the bathroom - you'll see what I mean).  The dining room seemed fairly full.  We ordered drinks, and then we waited at least 10 minutes before anything showed up.  These were simple soft drinks and coffee that didn't require any preparation.  When the server returned he had forgotten one of the drinks.  There was no apology when we reminded him.  We ordered a starter, a salad, and three entrees.  Fifteen minutes later or so the three entrees arrived.  We informed the food runner (someone different than the server) that we hadn't received the starter or salad yet.  His response \"Ok, I can go get those.\"  Again, no apology.  The table was then loaded with plates for everything we had ordered.  Not exactly the leisurely meal we had expected.  Then we noticed we hadn't been given a bread basket.  Again we asked.  Response:  \"Oh yeah, I can get bread.\" Again, no apology.  After the meal we asked about the dessert menu.  The server said they don't have a menu, but he said he would be right back to list off the choices.  Maybe 10 minutes later he returned.    As for the food...  We ordered the charcuterie sampler board as a starter.  A large portion of assorted sliced meats and cheeses.  These were very tasty and seemed of solid quality.  We had a house salad as well which was different and involved some greens as well as tomatoes, olives, sun dried tomatoes, and artichoke.  Different, but not bad.  Then we had the Eggplant Parmesan, Spaghetty Western, and Spaghetti and Meatballs.  These all were quite good.  The Western in particular was a unique dish with sauteed deli meats and green peas.  It all worked well together with a zesty sauce.  The Eggplant was good with large pieces of eggplant with just the right amount of cheese and sauce.  The meatballs in the spaghetti and meatballs were very good and definitely tasted homemade with a wonderful seasoning.  For desserts we went for tiramisu, cheesecake, and key lime cheesecake.  Again, all very good.  The tiramisu was the star here with moist cake soaked with a coffee flavor and just enough sweetness.   The overall verdict was very good food and very poor service.  But, I think I would be willing to try it again since service can fluctuate a bit from visit to visit at a lot of places.",

We usually go and sit at the bar for our night out  Updated: I originally gave them a 5 star as we came in all the time and we ordered the same thing. The last time we went in our favorite bartender wasn't there. The glass of wine that I order every time was over $20 this time and the bartender didn't even warn us. The tempura batter for the fried ravioli was crap, the meat in the entree was half of what we normally get, and we got the spaghetti which was fine. Thankfully it's hard to mess that up. It was over $100 for a meal that wasn't good and it breaks my heart because this became a twice a month outing.",

Had a little dip in service and consistency a few times, but we got a chance to try it again tonight and had an excellent meal and even better service.  Alex is and always has been a staple of quality at this restaurant, tonight we had Alex and another younger gentleman; both amazing service.    Food was exceptional tonight.   Had the bruschetta and it seems to have been redone from what we had before.  Really tasty, perfectly made, excellent Balsamic Glaze and topped off with a few really great olives.  Very much enjoyed.    We had the lobster Ravioli, came with a great blush sauce and a few perfectly cooked mini shrimp.  Very good!     My younger children shared spaghetti and meatballs, and the sauce and the meatballs were the star here!     Finally my wife and I split Chicken Francese and the Chicken Park with Fettuccine Alfredo.   I loved the Parm and the Alfredo and my wife loved the Francese, so it was a win-win.        The best part here is the new owner; he really cares about what customers think.  It is obvious in the fact that he is at the restaurant on a Friday night, greeting the guests and hanging at the bar making friends.        I have had a roller coaster ride here from loving, to disappointment, to loving again.  I imagine that if the owner is this attentive they can only have tremendous success.     -Bravo",

    "text": "Fun name. Apt touches of western sub-genre film posters. Warm colors and wood paneling evoke a modern saloon feel -- you'd halfway expect a space cowboy to walk in, but then you remember you're nestled in a shopping plaza in the heart of Southern Highlands.  More often than not, my bf and I venture out to new places with the practicality of a Groupon. This was one of those days. I bought a $20 lunch voucher for about half the price, then just paid the difference. We visited at the tail-end of lunchtime, so the place was practically empty.   Our server was great. He started us off with drinks and appetizers. We decided on a plate of their FETTUNTA, a 5-piece garlic bread with olive oil and a side of marinara. Reminded me of Texas toast, but with herbs. I got the PASTA PESTO made with FETTUCINE. I had the choice of plain or creamy, so I went with creamy -- good choice. My bf kept it simple and got the SPAGHETTY MEATBALLS, with 3 large house made meatballs included.   Their pasta selection can be overwhelming. There's a section of CLASSIC, which offers your choice of pasta: spaghetti, penne, linguine, fettucine, capelli; for $2 more: gnocchi, pappardelle, cavatelli; for $3 more: cheese tortellini, mushroom or lobster or butternut squash ravioli. Then they have more items under PASTA SPECIALS as well as under PASTA DI MADRE. So safe to say, there's no shortage of pasta here. Price ranges from $12.95 - $24.95. Hellooo carbs!  Overall, we had an enjoyable lunch. I had read some of the reviews on here and was a little hesitant to try because of the unprofessional responses that could have been dealt with better, but we didn't encounter anything like that. Grab the Groupon!",

We were offered a wine/beer list and given bread with oil and vinegar pronto. Upon looking at the menu we both ordered different types of spaghetti. Although the food was delish, I give them a four star because I wish they would have mentioned the heaviness of the gnocchi. My husband was not able to finish his meal because of the gnocchi heaviness, but it was recommended by our waiter. What I take from this is, play safe with a more popular spaghetti. The ambiance was perfect, it was literally a rustic set-up on an Italian restaurant. There was hung lights, as if you were sitting outside on your own porch. Lastly, when we were there on a Thursday afternoon there was live music coming in to play and taking requests!",

She said it was an interesting combination of flavors that you would not find at a typical sub shop.  The only thing preventing a five star rating is the lack of side item choices. Each sandwich came with a bag of chips, but we'd like to have options for the sides. We will order from here again.",

    "text": "So far I have had a couple experiences at this restaurant, I have ordered the caprese salad and garlic bread to take to a party and the owner was very helpful and accommodating with serving suggestions. My next experience was dining in and once again the owner was very accommodating, one item we ordered was the antipasto, my daughter loves cheese and he no problem with adding extra and I thought that was great. I gave this place 2 stars because as I read many other reviews, I agree with other comments I to had to deal with whomever the unpleasant blonde server/cashier is as well as witnessed some unprofessional behavior behind the counter. Anyone behind that counter should be required to have there hair tied back and it should be common knowledge never to pull out money in front of guest. I really hope they can make the whatever changes needed because I really think they have good food.",

We don't reside in Southern Highlands, but in SW Vegas, but I would certainly drive across town for a meal here.  The restaurant is small and casual, but the food was honestly some of the best we've had anywhere, especially in Vegas where Italian isn't on par with what my fiance and I grew up eating back home.  Every part of the meal was outstanding.  I had one of the daily specials, gnocchi with marinara, mozzarella, and basil, and he had the fettuccine alfredo with chicken.  Both meals came with garlic bread, which was also divine. I ordered a dinner salad as well and it was perfect.  The whole meal with a bottle of wine was $52 before tip.  I would pay double for the quality of the meal.  If you are looking for a sit-down restaurant, this isn't really it, but if you want quality recipes for a reasonable price, you've found what you're looking for!",

Was gross lacked any seasoning , and was too starchy with only a few small pieces of pasta . It more  resembled a white bean  soup . Not good had to send back after 1 bite . Chicken sand. Was just meh....  Dry sandwich with zero dressing / mayo or anything . Tomatoes were not fresh . Few small pieces of welted greens and again lacked any seasoning .  The person I came with ordered the lasagna which was burnt on the bottom .  This place used to be better . It pisses me off when restaurants just don't give a damn about taste and quality yet still want to charge double for a gross and disgusting sandwich. I will never return nor will I recommend to any1 with tastebuds . and I hope ur greedy asses go from Grand opening to Grand closing .... Get a new chef or start caring more .",

It's really nice inside, clean and open. The booths were comfortable and it's an inviting atmosphere.  We were promptly greeted and escorted to our booth. The server was upbeat and sweet which was appreciated. The menu was very diverse and offered a lot of dishes besides the \"normal\" Italian cuisine.  We decided on the fried calamari to start..when it arrived, we were pleasantly surprised to see that it came with 3 shrimp as well! They were lightly seasoned and fried and were delicious! I don't think we would order the calamari again because it was chewy, but we asked if we could just prefer the shrimp and they said absolutely!  We decided to split the Chicken Parmesan and I'm so glad we did. Not only was it delicious, but the portion was perfect for splitting!  The owner came and introduced himself and talked a bit, that really speaks a lot of the establishment. He invited us back for happy hour, which is 4-7pm nightly at the bar. Can't wait to take advantage of that!  When we were leaving our server gave us complimentary Canolis which were delicious as well.  Overall we were really happy with everything and will definitely be back!!",

Bruschetta was just as you'd expect and the squid was very tender and had a great seasoning to it.  Next I had the Spaghetti Carbonara and pretty much cleared the plate. Our table spilt a few desserts and while they were all good, the tiramisu was amazing. The tiramisu was fresh, moist and the espresso or coffee powder in it was amazing!  Great place and service was quick and on top of us and our drinks.  Will be back.  Nice to have good places like that in our southwest side of town.",

    "text": "So after ordering from here through Postmates a few times me and my girlfriend stopped by to try the place in person!  We arrived to a pretty busy Friday night. It had a cozy, authentic, family kind of feel with posters of old Spaghetti Western movies on the walls, but our server was a very friendly Italian gentleman whose name escapes me, but he wore glasses and was awesome. He had an accent but we understood him just fine and it was kind of cool to hear him say the dishes like they do in Italy - gave the whole place an authentic feel. He was prompt and smiled a lot. Very friendly! The manager (a long-haired guy) who sat us was super friendly as well. A+ service!  We'd already had the food quite a bit so we knew it would be great, but we explored the menu this time. The chicken marsala and lobster ravioli was fantastic of course but we hadn't really ventured into the appetizer menu and WOW we were glad we did. The fettunta (garlic bread) was great, and the sauce they use for the fried mozzarella seriously, seriously knocked our socks off! I wanna go back just to have more of that sauce, and also to try the steak. Another table ordered the steak and it smelled amazing just passing by.  As a side note since my girlfriend tends to be picky about this, the place was VERY cleanly even though it was quite busy. Everything was spotless, the napkins were neatly folded and the silverware was shiny-clean. We'll definitely be back!",

A BUNCH!Located in the heart of Southern Highlands strip mall which has an abundance of other stores if you can't find parking then, it must be holiday time or Black Friday.....seems to ALWAYS be parking here.  THE EXPERIENCE   I walked in with my squad and we were immediately greeted by the owner. He made us feel welcomed and comfortable and sat us right away. The Chef and another employee were talking back in fourth ( in Italian ) while we were glancing at the menu....the owner comes over and tells us what they're discussing. Apparently the Chef got bored and made a pizza and calzone ( two items that are not on the menu but he wanted to see what it would cook like ), never made these items before and the owner suggested that he have us, my party be the first to try the deliciousness. We did not turn this offering down. We split the personal pizza and calzone and after a bite of each knew we had made the right decision in coming to Spaghetty Western. When deciding on appetizers we inquired about a few items that were not on the menu but certainly common dishes made in Italian spots. The bruschetta was one of the first requested items. When our waiter said they don't normally make that, but then said he may have some items in the back to accommodate us we were surely grateful.  [ I mean, it felt similar to an experience at an Italian friends home where their Mom is planted in the kitchen making meal after meal and as a guest you're forced to sit at the table and indulge on every last bit ]  My squad had never dined here before and we were just not used to the quality customer service that went above and beyond anything we'd ever experienced. Quality to a 'T' !!!  I had seen via Yelp of a certain dish that had Coke highly recommended when dining here, The Bobbi. Let me tell you it DID NOT disappoint. My beer was never empty and the complimentary bread basket always stayed full ( just like my belly ). An experience so good I did not want to leave Vegas.  The only thing left to discuss was the name of the location. We couldn't for the life of us figure out why such an authentic Italian restaurant had such ( what I thought to be ) a weak name. The owner then explained that the name was inherited by the previous owner and actually was the general name for many of the Westerns that were shot in the early 1940's and 50's. Majority of the locations for these films were in Italy. Actors like John Wayne & Clint Eastwood were filmed in these historic towns in southern Italy. Hence the name Spaghetty Western.  OVERALL  The experience increased in quality as the meal progressed. The staff, extremely personable and helpful in every way. Looking forward to the renovations that will be happening over the next couple months, an expansion of the restaurant including a bar and patio area will be full equipped by mid-April. Don't fret though, all you locals will still be able to enjoy the food, they'll be open during this enhancement period.  Spaghetty Western, benvenuto nel club a 5 stelle!",

I think I was a bit harsh on the place the first go around,  but that's the beauty of Yelp, it's like a religion...there's always time to repent.  I have grown to love this spot and the staff are legit.  We just got done exchanging baby pics with one of the Italian ladies and had a nice chat, nothing prying or to revealing, but a genuine conversation that raised my awareness of how personable the staff is.   Although the dining area is puny, it's comfortable and gives you that cozy feeling that you are eating right in their home.  Don't forget to wash down your main entree with a tall glass if Peroni and check out the traditional deli and desserts.  Grazi Spaghetty Western!",

Caprese salad was also good. I got it with dressing already on, recommend that way rather than putting it on yourself. Most flavorful caprese I've had.  Only wish is that the Cheesecake came out like the picture on Postmates. Still good quality though.",

We just live down the street from this restaurant & we just made our very first visit tonight, such a shame we never tried it before because the spaghetti bolognese is SO DAMN GOOD!!!!  We've lived here for almost 9 years!  Quite honestly I think the quirky name of the restaurant doesn't do it any justice as thats the main reason we never stepped in, it just doesn't sound very authentic Italian.  Nonetheless, I'm very happy we finally gave it a try.  We now have a favorite Italian restaurant!",

The waitstaff are so attentive and we've gotten to know several of them by name now.   The restaurant is fairly small, and if you decide to come on a weekend, be prepared to wait 30+ minutes for a table. However very much worth the wait!   The wine selection is above & beyond anything in the area. The Duckhorn wine flight is one of our favorites. The salads are great, very fresh and the dressings are flavorful. I highly recommend the pastas (especially the bolognese)...but we really come here for the garlic bread. We usually order 2 of them because it's devoured so quickly. It's simply AMAZING!!! And the cannoli for dessert. Yum.  It's very affordable for a family meal and really great for a social date night. A secret spot of ours on the southwest side of town that we don't mind sharing. Love!",

    "text": "I have never left a review for any restaurant before and it upsets me to do so, but I have never had a dining experience like the one I received this evening. So I'll simply stick to what happened rather than how it made me feel.  Shortly after entering the restaurant and standing in line behind an elderly couple, another couple walked in behind me. Both couples were taken to be seated while I was overlooked. After realizing the mistake, there weren't any readily available clean tables, so the wait continued.  After being seated, the wait continued for 21 minutes until we were approached by Peggy. She offered to comp our beverages for the long wait. We ordered both our drinks and meals at the same time. Another 10 minutes later, exactly 31 minutes since arriving at the table, there were still no drinks in front of us or the waters that we requested. The person I was dining with proceeded to the bar to request the waters from the bartender while also telling her our wine order. He brought the waters back to the table and the bartender brought the wine, while Peggy, still too busy to visit our table. Another gentleman brought out our meals and Peggy checked on us at the same time to see if we wanted cheese on top of our dishes. At this point, I realized that the pasta in my meal was incorrect- I requested linguine and received spaghetti. After already regretting the time spent at the restaurant, I brought this to Peggy's attention. After asking several times if I was okay with the spaghetti, the dish was finally sent back to the kitchen. Peggy returned moments later stating that the kitchen was out of linguine.  Ultimately, I was given spaghetti with the impression that I wouldn't notice the difference. Additionally, I had to request for bread to be brought to the table. The entire experience was extremely unacceptable.  My expectations never pertained to receiving a comped meal. It was the principle- the fact that I was given a meal that I didn't order, without any consideration to my preferences. While this alone should have deemed the meal worthy of being comped; it wasn't. Based on my overall experience this evening, I will not be returning, and it is my best recommendation that other patrons stay clear.  To say that the entire experience was bad because of our server Peggy, would not be fair- The entire staff essentially is to blame. Where one fails, another surely should be able to pick up the slack. My dining experience did not start on a positive note, which should have left an opportunity to recover. Unfortunately however, it only continued to spiral downwards.  I particularly find fault in Peggy attempting to force me to enjoy a dining experience that had nothing positive going for it. I don't believe her attempt at recovery was the appropriate way to rectify the situation. It only elevated my dissatisfaction towards the experience. I've refrained from interjecting my personal feelings during this review. However, if I were to include how I currently feel, humiliated is the first word that comes to mind.",

    "text": "This restaurant was terrible, what is worse is the response to my complaint from the poorly trained manager.  We ordered through bite squad, so the restaurant used them as a scapegoat for poor quality, and portion size.    We ordered for delivery the flash fried calamari, side caeear salad, charred octopus, caprese salad, lasagne, and tiramisu. The charred octopus had 4 tiny portions, and the calamari was a super small portion.  They stated \"we don't suggest ordering fried items for delivery\".  I said I never said we are unhappy with the calamari quality, only that there is such a small amount of octopus and calamari.  Side note, the charred octopus was flavorless.   The caprese salad does not list green olives or kalamata olives, they stated that they have tried to fix the menu on bite squad without success.  I stated the menu matched the restaurant menu on the restaurant website.  Also, the tomatoes are beefsteak tomatoes that are inedible because they are not fully ripened.  I had to use tomatoes from home in my caprese.  The caprese had overabundance of black pepper that cause me to sneeze horribly.   The side caesar looked like it could have been out of a bag.  Some of the lettuce was brown and there was very little dressing, and few croutons. The lasagne had very little sauce, and was stone cold and flavorless. Our bill was $90.00, granted it's a little more costly through bite squad, but still that's just craziness to charge what they do for portion and quality!",

Overall good vibe there, lots of food passion, would dine there again.",

We had some drinks at the bar before our reservation, and were able to transfer to a table in the restaurant a bit earlier than planned to eat.   1. Amazing bread and oil/vinegar  2. Delicious fried mozzarella  3. Fettuccine Alfredo was out of this world delicious  4. Fettuccine Carbonara with Chicken to die for   The food was so good we couldn't stop thinking about it afterwards. So a week later we ordered it for delivery using GrubHub, and it did not disappoint.  We had baked mostaccioli, lasagna, and pepperoni pizza. They also included complimentary bread with the order. We have a VERY picky eater in the house, who said it was the best food ever. Major win for this house!!!   I highly recommend this place. The pasta is clearly fresh and made in house, which really makes such an huge impact on the taste. Give this little place a try; you will not be disappointed!!",

The place is pretty small with only a few tables, not the best place for large parties, I would recommend doing take-outs.   The first time I came was soon after they opened, we were greeted quickly and the staff explained the menu to us, explained the specials for the day and were very helpful. We ordered a charcuterie platter for $12... this platter was amazing! It came with 4 different meats, garlic bread, 3 different cheeses, olives and peppers, artichokes... a huge platter only for $12!! We ordered the specials for the day and was very happy with the whole experience.   The second time they were busier, we waited a bit for service which was fine. We ordered the charcuterie platter again and it was not the same. We could tell that they were understaffed, they had lots of to-go orders and their tables were all full. The guy who took our ordered ended up making our charcuteries and it was not the same, fewer meats and cheeses, very little olives, peppers and artichoke...the presentation was also not the same. We got pastas and they tasted very good. A little disappointed because the charcuteries plate impressed us the first time and we came back mainly for the platter, but didn't get the same platter.   Definitely a good place to eat though, pastas tasted fresh, delicious sauce, nice variety of selection, you can also buy cheeses and cured meats to take home. Good place to grab an Italian sandwich or pastas for lunch.",

We were greeted by smell of deliciousness right when we walked in and by very nice and friendly gentleman named Robert.   We told him it's our first time eating here he found a table for us immediately which was a pleasant surprise because the rest of the tables and bar were full.     The first thing we noticed was really good prices on bottle of wine.  The menu was large and had lots of classics and specials.   Debbie our server was engaging and knowledgeable.   The house bread and oil, herb with garlic dipping con concoction was devilishly good I wanted to drink it from the gravy bowl but didn't want to get thrown out for being an animal so i ordered more bread to make sure I got every drop.    We orders a great house salad loaded with antipasto tidbits.  Since I'm no longer drinking my wife had a nice glass of wine instead of the bottle but we I'll be back with friends to take advance of bottle pricing.    My wife can never order her past how she likes it.  She was giddy with the ability to create her own!  I mean she usually gets shunned and embarrassed ordering a mix penne, bolognese, veggies (Bootlegger was the worst at shaming her) Debbie loved the order and it came out exactly how she wanted.  Wow!!  Win for our family.   I had went with Debbie (well I should have done the daily special Osobuco it LOOKED incredible) instead I did a white sauce with a pasta I've never seen so good, Italian sausage (light and airy), asparagus and other veggies.  I mopped this up like I hadn't eaten before I normally wouldn't have ordered this so glad I did.    We had to try desert the home made tiramisu and gelato where perfectly yummy.      We found a new favorite local eatery in Southern Highlands highly recommend!!!",

Because it's nowhere near the strip (it was about a $20 Lyft ride from the Hard Rock Hotel), we would have never found this place. My only regret is that I was extremely hungover so I wasn't able to fully enjoy the meal, but once I got some bruschetta in me, I was able to eat enough to make it well worth the trip.  Pros:  -It's a cute, locally owned joint with a fun theme. The western film posters are fun, and it still manages to feel middle upscale. -The owner was active in the restaurant, helping out his single waitress during the midday shift on a Thursday when it was surprisingly pretty busy.  -The women's restroom has complementary feminine products and a sugar scrub for your hands. It's a nice touch -Of course, the food was AMAZING. I would definitely recommend this place to locals.  Cons: -The only con was I ordered chicken on my salad, but when it arrived, it was chickenless. I asked for the strips after it came but didn't receive them until almost the end of our meal. It was okay though because the owner apologized profusely and comped the charge.",

    "text": "was awesome as usual. Great portions leave you full and satisfied. My wife ordered Chicken Piccata and loved the flavor. I ordered the DK Special and they made it up custom for me. It was angel hair pasta with olive oil & garlic. I added in broccoli, peas and chicken. VERY HEALTHY!! Bellisimo!!Karen & Alex are excellent team members that provide flawless service with a big smile. EAT HERE!!  Went to this restaurant again last night for early dinner with an out of town relative. Service from Alex was exceptional. The Octopus salad is \"killer\" and the mussels were awesome also. Lots of fresh bread for dipping in that broth. We do take out often and this place NEVER DISSAPOINTS!!!!!!!   Great meal again on Friday night with friends. Food was very good as usual. I ordered Sole Milanese and it was very tasty. See picture  It's Saturday Sept 30. Just had another rediculously delicious meal at Spaghetti Western. Then crushed a great dessert, Vanilla Gelato with Espresso poured over it. OMG",

The semifreddo was excellent.  First time I've had it, was smooth and creamy.  We spoke with owner, the desserts are made fresh daily.  We will be back!! Gloria, Juan and kids.",

My grandson wanted to go here for his 18th birthday for their whole Maine lobster so I called them to see if they were going to have the lobster on that day.  I was told \"we can have it anytime as long as you let me know ahead of time\". So great, I told him we'll be there in two days.  When we did go we ordered the lobster and the waiter said we don't have lobster tonight so I said please ask the chef because I was assured we would have the lobster. He returned and said no I'm sorry we don't have any. Ok so let's move on. Grandson got veal Parmesan, husband got meatball sub and I ordered chicken Marsala. Veal was really good meatball sub was so so. Sauce was not on sub was on the side and meat balls was just ok. I asked for linguini with my chicken Marsala and I got angel hair. Sent it back and came back with linguini but I asked where's the Marsala sauce? I was told that's how we make it. Two small pieces fried chicken, no sauce. This was an unfortunate 18th birthday.",

    "text": "I'm so glad we finally tried Spaghetty Western! Never judge a restaurant by it's name cause I thought-what a weird combo, Italian and Western?? Uh NO...but it is actually an authentic Italian deli and restaurant, so authentic that the first time we dined there, there was an older Italian grandmotherly woman yelling at someone else in Italian in the kitchen!  The first time we were there, I tried their gnocchi in pesto/Gorgonzola sauce and the mister had their chili lasagna.  He LOVED his lasagna so much that he ordered the same thing the second time we went.  The gnocchi was good but I felt the sauces needed a little more flavor (maybe more garlic or salt or cheese?).  Second time, I ordered the Fisherman's Cioppino Pasta...it was SO good!! For $18.95 I would definitely order this dish again but I really want to try a lot of their other pasta options.  Portions are pretty big so the gnocchi I had was taken home and reheated the next day and it was even better the next day as the gnocchi softened up a bit.  The Cioppino did not last another day, I ate the whole entire entree and practically licked the plate.  We did take a tiramisu home the first visit and the slice was huge and delicious also!",

Additionally, two of the orders were wrong and one of those even came out wrong the second time. At no time did a manager or owner come over to check on our table or see what could be done about the mishaps. On the bright side, the food we were served was fairly tasty. I think this restaurant could be great, if they paid more attention to detail and customer satisfaction. They are pretty overpriced for what you get and could benefit from adjusting their prices.",

Back then, the cold cut and cheese platter was large and the most delicious I have ever had.  Now, the portions are smaller, the cold cuts lack flavor and the cheeses seem like they just go down to Smiths grocery and pick up some very cheap cuts.  Ordered the Spaghetty Western and carbonara and the noodles, which were once freshly made and al dente, now seem like they come from a box and over cooked.  The prosciutto used is dry, chewy and lacks a lot of flavor.  Too bad the old owner, Andrea left, truly was a hidden gem.  He has a new place in summerlin, if anyone knows please let me know where it is!!",

Perfecto! \"I had the \"Alex's salad\" which consisted on olives, artichokes, salami, sundried tomatoes, mozzarella cheese and arugula). My wife and I shared everything. Portions were sooooo huge! Of course not to forget dessert, the home-made cannolis! Just like back home in NY. Very good.

My favorite is the Bobbi (just ask to add chicken or otherwise customize your dish they will try hard to please you) or the Pasta Speck, which is not on the current menu, but will hopefully be back (again, just ask, and they'll make it for you). Best tiramisu I've ever had. Say hi to David; he'll make you feel welcome and treat you like family.",

Would I stop here if I was in the area .. Def yes ... . Staff was great ...very experienced bartender who makes great craft cocktails .. Food was decent not mind blowing but good ... Plating for me reminded me of Olive Garden ... Great portions but for me flavor was bland on what's suppose to be a specialty dish  ... Really nice decor ...Again great place for location ...",

Everything is above expectations, especially for the tiramisu, the lady fingers soaked just perfectly, not too watery or too dry, the mascarpone & heavy cream and the coffee married very well. Must try item!!   Full bar in the restaurant and also a take out side for pick up. If you happen to order for a take out, you can also grab a yummy dessert prepackaged in the fridge!",

Yelp is a sight to review based on your \"opinions\" and overall service of whatever the establishment was. That was my opinion and I have the right to give it. I was only dissatisfied with the taste of the food. I have nothing else bad to say. With that being said, allow people to have different taste buds and thoughts. Thanks and have a great day!",

As we walked in I asked the bartender for a couple of drinks. She brought them to the table is 2 minutes.   Our server was more than terrific.  Always ready to help and make recommendations.   We started with grilled octopus. The best I've ever had. Tasty and tender.  Add some garlic bread and we were getting full.   My MIL had soup and loved it. My wife and I simply split a plate of spaghetti and meat sauce. We were more than full. So naturally we had to order cheesecake. Fantastic!  We will happily return.",

Then it took another 10 minutes before our drinks arrived. Our food came pretty fast and hot. Which is awesome. Burned my mouth with the pasta. Don't worry I liked it that way.

There was nothing special about the food or the decor. My husband ordered the Cioppino and I had the Saltimbocca.  He liked his, but for nearly $25 he should have loved it. My meal was not tasty, my fault I should never order sage, but it was not prepared well either. The chicken was overcooked, dry despite being drowned in bland butter sauce.  The appetizer was the most flavorful part of my meal, but tiny clams. The bill came to over $100 for a so so meal. I think the excellent reviews come from people unaccustomed to quality Italian cuisine. Also, the decor is boring.",

First of all, I live in anthem and the restaurant is located in southern highlands...not sure why it took almost 2 hours for my food to get to me...? Makes sense why the food was so cold, it probably sat there forever. Secondly, the pizza was so bad I had one slice then threw the rest away; it was cold, completely tasteless and didn't seem fresh at all. Could've gotten better pizza from Domino's. Lastly I got the pasta a la vodka and the spaghetti was so undercooked it was hard to eat. Al dente? No, more like almost raw lol. I never ever eat Italian food because of dieting but when I do cheat, I expect it to be half decent. Sooo disappointed I wasted my cheat day on this place. Maybe the food is better in restaurant? Not sure, but good luck ordering delivery",

    "text": "First timer here and I'm definitely coming back! Though it's a pretty small venue (estimating 50-60 people max?) The food, service, and ambience were all on point. At first the menu looked a bit confusing but after letting the server know it was our first time he explained everything we needed to know.   We started with the calamari which was delicious. Not so much breading and the flavor was a bit on the salted side and just enough that it kept me wanting more like a bag of chips.   We ended up ordering Alfredo pasta with Fettuccini and chicken and the lobster ravioli. I'm not no pasta conossieur by any means but the best Alfredo I've had was the seafood Alfredo from Olive Garden; and the Alfredo at this place was not as creamy as I'd like, but still delicious.you have a choice in what type of protein you want, and with the chicken we chose, you can just tell the chicken was fresh off the grill. The lobster ravioli on the other hand, was delicious as well. It came with a creamy vodka tomato base sauce with pieces of shrimp scattered. The cheese in the ravioli was cooked perfectly where the inside wasn't cold nor was it too hot that it burned your mouth.   Along with the pastas our waiter suggested to order the garlic bread and he claimed it was the best in the city. So we agreed and the actual name was \"fettunta\" -- and I was convinced. It was definitely one of these best garlic breads I've ever had. Not only was it warm and toasty, but it was brushed over with a garlic butter and had some shredded cheese on top.   Over all, though it's only been 1 time, I'm giving this 5 stars. Definitely one of the best Italian spots I've eaten at and am curious to taste whatever else they have to offer.   *BONUS* There are TV's at the bar so I was able to keep up with my March madness NCAA bracket, and the day we went there was live music playing classic songs on acoustic guitar!",

The gnocchi is out of this world b/c it's so garlicky and the potato dumplings are so tender; it's my all time favorite dish here. The service is fair the first couple times my family and I we're served by a blonde waitress and she seemed a little off. The last time I came here (yesterday) the service was way better.

    "text": "My boyfriend and I decided to come here for lunch since it was close to where he lived. Also, I've been meaning to try this place out but because it was still really new when I heard about this place, there wasn't a whole lot of information. I didn't know what exactly they had on their menu. Well, today, I found out!   They had a bunch of different things on the menu ranging from meats, cheeses, sandwiches, and pastas. I LOVE pasta so we don't have to guess which category I looked at!  I ended up going with a Penne Arribbiata while the boyfriend went with their Spaghetty Western. When we went to order it, this gentlemen, with a very THICK accent, took down our order and asked us what we liked it about it. He warned me that my pasta was spicy but I LOVE spicy so of course I wouldn't have a problem! I think after that, I just nodded at what he said cause I couldn't really make it out. He said something about olives and I just said, \"I'm fine with that.\" I'm not sure if the olives were an add on or it came with it ... but if you were to order something, pay extra close attention to what he's saying! He's really nice though!  When I ate my pasta ... oy boy! It was spicy!! It wasn't alarmingly spicy but if you can't handle spicy foods, I wouldn't suggest it. It was very good. It had enough kick in it for me but the spiciness didn't burn. The penne that I chose with it was al dente, which is exactly how I like my pasta :) The serving sizes are pretty big too. I actually didn't finish my pasta so at least I have left overs for lunch the next day! Also, a piece of garlic bread comes with the pasta!   The ONLY thing I didn't really like was it took a while to get the food. We had ordered it to go so we were just waiting and waiting.   But I would definitely come back to this place !!",

Behind the counter the wait staff is having fun with each other while preparing amazing food.   I had the pasta and peppers that were amazing flavorful and filling. The eggplant parm was equally as delicious. Even though the price is slightly higher than you'd typically see at a deli it is well worth it due to the portion size.   Great quality and care put into every dish I saw come out. Can't wait to go back.",

Portions are large - we had enough leftovers for dinner tomorrow night!  For me, the highlight was the HUGE antipasto platter. $12 and you get to select 3 meats and 2 cheeses. Plus it comes with olives, roasted peppers, artichokes, and garlic bread on a bed of greens. So good!  I ordered the gnocchi with meat sauce, also good, and very filling. Not as good as my all-time favorite Rao's, but I still enjoyed it.  My hubby ordered the cioppino, which you can get mild, medium or spicy, with linguini. It was really good! Very hearty - with crab, shrimp, clams, mussels, fish, and calamari.  The restaurant is fairly small, so I can imagine it filling up quickly. The vibe is very casual. Service was good. Can't wait to go back!",

It seems these days we go out of our way to complain, but never take the time to acknowledge hard work and excellent quality.   We've never dined in your establishment, but we hope to one day. We have ordered delivery through Postmates a couple of times though. And I can only imagine how excellent your food is in person. We have now tried eight dishes altogether and we have yet to taste anything that isn't superb. (Even as leftovers several days in a row)   For our last delivery, we ended up eating rather late and placed our order towards the end of your business hours. Some lovely person included an extra dish (I assume to avoid having to throw it away at the end of the night). The extra dish of tortellini with sausage in a spicy sauce has quickly become a favorite. You are very thoughtful, and in such a difficult industry, you shine.",

After I got a continuous earful with a strong Italian accent that was barely understood....he went on and on about what they do have.  The long and short of it, they don't.   It's not an Italian market, but it is a True Italian deli.  They don't have boars head like a typical place.  SW is more befitting to locals. I wouldn't go out of my way.  It looks like a deli, not a restaurant.  Meatball Sandwich ================ Presentation - 5.0 stars.  It measured 8-9 inches.  Uncut, and beautiful.  Pick-up Ability - 1.0 stars.  It was mush in my hands.  Too much sauce.  This doesn't happen at Capriotti's!  Meatballs (3.0 stars) - Heavy, not bready enough to be light.  Sauce (2.0 stars) - a sharp taste, like vinegar.  Cheese (5.0 stars) - wonderful quality of both parm and mozzarella.   Bread (5.0 stars) - amazing.  Toasty and fresh.  Talkative, but a very nice man.  Lasagne looks great, and huge slices at that.  It might be worth giving them another try, even though the sauce was questionable...it could've been a bad batch.",

    "text": "\"Cibo Squisito\". Now does that tell you the legitimacy of an italian restaurant if I want to google the language for something witty to begin the review with? Ha-ha.  I don't know where to start to be honest as there is so much to touch upon, but the bottom line is this place is legit and will a top contender in this area for years to come! The strip mall it's located in has quite the echelon when it comes to culinary gems and Spaghetty Western is no exception!  I'm quite sad that my Dad is moving out of the area, but being introduced to some top notch food was certainly a parting gift even I can deal with. It is family owned and he does frequent here enough that he has been able to build a rapor with the owner and family. That is a rarity and something that you can't teach nor replace when it comes to this type of stuff. I had an opportunity to meet them as well and first impression alone you can tell that they put their hearts into making this place run like a well oiled machine.   From what I do remember of the visit is that from the instant popularity there were people everywhere and with it being such a small venue that turned people away who didn't stick out waiting for a table (their loss). They do take reservations which after hearing the above should be a no brainer to ensure that your experience is 5 stars and beyond like mine. My Dad mentioned that they are expanding into the vacant business next to them so right there tells me that they were aware of the issue and will put every inch to good use.   The menu itself pretty much has something for everyone and any walk of life, but I set myself up for success going simple and selecting the spaghetti and meatballs. I partnered penne pasta for the occasion with the meatball and it was enough to slap me across the face and yell \"Ciao Bella\" from the rooftops as each bite digests. The pasta was soft and seemingly melted away as it was consumed. Between the marinara sauce and the meatball those alone blew me away. The marinara was thick in texture, but really coated the pasta well and came out swinging flavored masterfully. All I have left to say which makes me wish I had culinary turrets is MEATBALLS MEATBALLS MEATBALLS! These are off the chain here and honestly the best I have ever had to date. MUST TRY! It had a bit of spicing to it, but very moist circular slabs of delicious here! I apparently was a giggle magnet at the table as I even gave appearance to my once retired Kobayashi wiggle as I had my first bite. You know you've got an ace when your food does that to your body!  Another highlighted point which would be a disservice if not mentioned was the lobster ravioli. My wife has not stopped talking about this for a good 2 months now and for her to stop in her tracks is crazy. The amount of lobster does equal up to the price tag and I even got shocked by the amount in there as I'm used to maybe a piece here and there not the whole lobster famiglia! There were seven pieces total, but was filling no less. After sampling that one myself I put that on my last meal list when I die so I can go out feeling like royalty!  If you are ever in the neighborhood or need an escape from the strip life make the 10 minute drive here as you won't be sorry by any means. I hope they continue to grow within the area and I cross my fingers for them to branch out to California someday. I doubt that would be the case though, but as a testament to them I'd drive 4 hours in the event of meatball meat sweats. Ha-ha! Grazie di cuore! I can't wait to go back here pronto!",

When we walked in, I instantly noticed how small and limited their seating was. But it was only half full when we came in. It wasn't super clear if it was seat yourself type of place or what. But the server said sit anywhere so we did.   To comment the server wasn't the friendliest but he wasn't rude it was just not a lot of personality to work with there. We didn't ask for any recommendations because we weren't getting like oh please talk to me vibe.   The food did however come out fast.  We got the meatballs for appetizers, boyfriend got lasagna for main dish and I got this penne pasta with sausage and peppers with a red sauce.  The meatballs were ok not a lot of flavor to them. The lasagna had a flavor that we were not familiar with so we thought it was off. My boyfriend always compares lasagna with the one from guisseppes so he says its the best and the one at this place was no comparison. As for my pasta it was just ok. The penne was cooked perfectly. But it lacked flavor. I only ate a little bit and took the rest home since I hate to waste food.   It's not a come back place for us sorry!",

We were hungry and everyone said okay to trying Italian food instead.    Our table had:  Pasta with an alfredo and vegetables Manicotti Italian sandwich can't remember the 4th dish.  Let's just say that the Manicotti was wonderful.  Hand made pasta and the cheese/spinach stuffing was great with their meat sauce.  The Italian sandwich was just what we had been looking for around town.  Everywhere we went we were  disappointed, but here it is fabulous.  The flavor explodes in your mouth.  We will be back even though it is not close to our home.  A 20 minute drive.  The alfredo pasta with vegetables was also given a high thumbs up from my friend.  We all ate our leftovers that night because they were so good.  Yey :)",

Even the Chef comes out from behind the counter to assist guests. I'd highly recommend the pasta with lobster in a spicy marinara sauce (has to be my favorite so far), the lobster ravioli in a pink vodka sauce is unbelievable, and just the simple pasta marinara (I like spaghetti) will blow you away!  Oh yes, Jason's Father is also an unbelievable Executive Chef (he taught Jason the art)! You can't go wrong regardless of who prepares your meal! Delicious, authentic Itallian cuisine at a fair price in a cozy Itallian Deli style atmosphere. Doesn't get much better than Spaghetty Western!",

    "text": "I was confused about this restaurant's logo and decor alongside the Italian menu until I read that Spaghetti Western is a bonafide genre of Western films produced and directed by Italians.  This place serves food from Italian immigrants who fell in love with movies like \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\" by Sergio Leone.  I'm still not sure where the western flavor is factored in... maybe in the soda and chip choices, or the fact that their Tortellini is shipped from New York... but one thing is for sure.  Even if their menu is quite Italian (with an Italian speaking grandmother in the back of the kitchen)... any American would love this kind of food.  Their servings are large and their $12 antipasto platter can make 3 or 4 people extremely happy.  It comes with peppers, olives, sundried tomatoes, artichokes (sooo good) and you get to choose 2 kinds of cheeses and 3 types of cold cuts.  We went for fontina, gorgonzola, salame, coppa and pancetta and all were uhmazing.  Real good stuff, and they even brought out complimentary Prosciutto di Parma which was melt in your mouth good.  The plate comes with 2 garlic bread slices so you might want to order more if you are a group sharing.  Their garlic bread was standard but had a few lovely chili flakes to give it a little kick.  We then had 1 of their 3 soups of the day, the spinach and tortellini soup.  Honestly I was expecting a cream based broth, but it was a nice surprise to get something healthy and tasty, plus the bowl was as large as my head!  Hubby had the Carbonara which was good, but if you are a stickler for al dente you might want to request that.    We were unfortunately too full to try dessert and will definitely have to go back for the bindi cakes and tiramisu, as well as the awesome lookin porkchops and vegetable lasagnas.  Great food, good wine, large portions and low prices... go with fam/friends NOW and see if Spaghetty Western can rub off on you too.  Now I gotta go see those Sergio movies.",

Second time around ordering it, it was mostly cream cheese with a minute hint of mascarpone. I cried a little.

Not thinking this was because of the way it was cooked, but rather they maybe started with a lower quality chicken breast.  Fix that and I'd go 5 stars on this place!

You can either order up front or just have a seat a waitress eventually comes by.    There were a few other people there so we decided to dine in.  We ordered the anti pasto, Linguine Fisherman, & Arribata sauce pasta with chicken.  The serving size is quite generous and they give you a huge piece of garlic bread.  The taste was not bad either!  Pricing is about average, not crazy expensive (think Olive Garden pricing).    We go back or maybe order to go again definitely!   The only thing is that the wait was a little longer for the anti pasto and I guess there's only one deli guy who alsp works the cash register which is why it's slow?",

Upon arriving at this quaint spot I was excited to see a deli case full of cheese. The staff were extremely courteous and passionate about their restaurant and food from the second we walked in.  I was sold on the veggie lasagne and the two dudes I was with opted for the Cioppino Royal.  All of it was amazing! The preparation was beautiful and the flavor was outstanding. The proprietors obviously value quality and their customers. One of the best random Yelp stops I've made.",

    "text": "This place was great! We were greeted as soon as we walked in and invited to sit wherever we wanted, always a bonus.   Our waitress was Carrie and I can't say enough good things about the service she provided. Watching her handle the flow of people through the front door, the phone for delivery/pickup orders, and the other couple aside from us in the restaurant was impressive. She didn't skip a beat. She even refilled our drinks when she saw that we were low, while on the phone taking a delivery order. She was also very nice and warm and stopped by our table just to ask how everything was, crack a few jokes, etc. She bagged up our food when we were done and couldn't finish, didn't just hand us boxes and a check. That was super nice of her considering the amount of work she had going on. Once again, the service she provided was amazing.  The food was definitely on par with the service. I had the oven baked penne with meat sauce and my fiance had the penne alla vodka with prosciutto, sundried tomatoes, and garlic. Both dishes were excellent. The meat sauce on mine wasn't too watery or oily, was just perfect. The dish my fiance had was downright awesome. Can't go wrong with any of those ingredients, and they were executed very well. Pasta was cooked al dente, which is how I like it!  We got two cannoli's to go as well, and those were delicious. Nice, smooth, pastry cream with a flakey crust. Drizzled with chocolate and powdered sugar. Great stuff!  We definitely will be back.",

Now not only is the food and service to die for, but now the atmosphere matches! We sat at the bar, yes they have a bar now! My husband wasn't sure what he wanted, he couldn't decide between a few appetizers. So Pasquale, I believe an owner, made him a dish of 3 smaller appetizers, it was perfect! I also couldn't decide, so he made me a pasta with peas and it was to die for. This place goes above and beyond to make sure you have the best experience, and they are always so accommodating. Being from back east myself, this feels like \"home\" for me. From the food, to the wine, to the service, and the people, I see myself and my family dining here a lot. Even now more so due to the beautiful remodel. Thank you Spaghetti Western for being exactly what Southern Highlands needs!",

I've had this before, but this time when I got home and opened my to go order, there is absolutely no prosciutto.

    "text": "I hope this does not sound condescending, but I am giving this restaurant a 1 star because I care and want them to succeed. I see potential in this place, but only if this hard-working family can straighten some issues that need immediate attention:  Service: This was the deal breaker for us. We do not know the name of the lady serving us, and that is because she was not wearing a name tag. In fact, she was not wearing much of a professional attire to serve her customers...yoga pants, a very lose fitting blouse/gym top and dirty gym shoes definitely left a lot to be desired. Here is a list of no-no's we experienced in our visit:   * No greeting when we first came in   * We sat ourselves and 5-10 minutes went by before she acknowledged us...and there were only 3 tables sat at the time   * This lady was flustered and all over the place. She even complained to us about a table (that had a half-finished bottle of wine to go) of 6 people wouldn't leave.   * Her demeanor was curt and, sometimes rude. We spent 40+ minutes waiting for two dishes and we did not checked up on. Our drinks ran dry, no bread was brought to our table, no apology was given! About 50 minutes after ordering she comes to our table to, again, complain about how the kitchen was handling the to-go and eat-in tickets like that was, somehow, our problem. Towards the end of our meal she promised we would get our drinks for free because of the wait, but then she charged us for them!  * To top it all of, just as we were done eating, she tells us from behind the counter \"Hey, your total comes to $40.70 and I have your ticket pulled up here at the register. No hurry\"... HOW RUDE!!! We felt compelled to abruptly end our meal and go to the register to pay. She then has the nerve to ask us how much tip we are leaving her because her register does allow to put the tip after the ticket was printed. Really?!? If this is the case... then get a new register!  Kitchen Staff: Very disorganized! Some things we saw:   * A tall guy in the kitchen with shoulder-length hair kept running his fingers through his hair without washing his hands   * One of the line cooks handled tip money without washing his hands afterwards   * The server would clean tables and then dish the garlic bread with her bare hands   Food: Average at best. My linguini with white wine clam sauce was bland and 'boring' and my girlfriend's pasta with vodka sauce was just ok. Seasoning and flavor profile could be a lot better.  If an owner is reading this, please:  * Deploy your staff and give them specific responsibilities, so they don't run around like chickens with their heads cut off.   * Get a friendlier server for the front  * Observe hand-washing guidelines per the health department  * Ensure you have enough staff to meet the customer demand  * Ensure you have a system in place to serve the dine-in customers first, then take care of the delivery/carryout orders.  * Fix your charcuterie display. You have a $5000 refrigerated display with some old-looking food and chunks of meat thrown in there. You can do better.  Anyways... if you had the patience to read through all this and you are a possible customer, I hope you have a better experience. And, if you work here, please make it better!",

One was the Cesar and the other was a Caprese salad.  Normally if you order a salad to go, the dressing is served on the side, so I didn't even think to ask for it that way.  I guess I should have.  Not only was there dressing already on the salad, there was SO much dressing on the Cesar salad that I couldn't even eat it.  It was absolutely drenched in the dressing!!  It was mushy and sloppy and just plain disgusting.  A $10 salad better be bomb; and they just weren't.  Disappointed.",

My husband's lobster ravioli is as good as ever, but everything I try to order is inedible. After 2 to go orders recently I won't be going back. Ordered tortellini with 4 cheese sauce. They gave me ravioli and the sauce tasted pastey like raw flour. The second time I decided to try alfredo. It tasted like nothing but cream, no cheese or seasonings. I am so disappointed. This was our go to italian spot.",

We ended up coming back again before we left. The staff is hilarious too. What a fun and delicious place.",

The waiter was carrying on an inappropriately sexually gratuitous conversation with these women and putting his hands all over them. This is unacceptable behavior for a family restaurant. More shocking is that a man of his age should know better. To his credit the manager attempted to intervene but this made matter worse as the women seemed to be enjoying the attention and began running through the restaurant ending up in the kitchen. Despite the good food I would never recommend this restaurant to ANYONE with children.",

    "text": "For lack of a better intro to this review... Holy Crap. To call this place amazing wouldn't do it justice. It's rare to come across a restaurant that's not a chain off the strip, that just gets everything right... Spaghetti Western accomplishes that. We have passed by this place multiple times, but weren't sure about it. We've ate at all the other spots in this shopping center, but always skipped by this place for one reason or another. I saw a Groupon and decided that now would be as good of a time as any, low risk, high reward. Today I took my family here for lunch and we will definitely be back. We ordered the bruschetta to start, which was pretty well done. It tasted more like a vinaigrette on top of tomatoes than olive oil and herbs...but it was still delicious. We ordered the chicken Milanese for our son, my wife order the linguini scampi, and I went with a basic...spaghetti and meatballs. I always hear from all of the great chefs that when you go to a new place it's nice to sample the menu, but always start with something basic... if they get the basics right it's truly a good restaurant.. I've never dined at a place where that was more True. The sauce and meatballs were probably the most perfect I've had, and I come from an Italian family. My wife's scampi was perfect, and my son's chicken was very well seasoned and the potatoes were perfectly done. To quote my wife \" it's like they have a team of great grandmother's from Italy in the back working non stop\". After the meal my wife ordered the tiramisu and my son had the chocolate puffed pastry. They were both extremely happy and satisfied.   The service was really good, only negative was the pace of meal. My son's food came out with the appetizer and we were done eating for a while before the server came to offer desert and coffee. Our drinks were never empty and we never needed for anything, so the rest is just knit picking.   If you haven't tried this place, make sure you do. It is hands down the best Italian restaurant you can find in Las Vegas.",

I wasn't mad, they were just as busy inside as they were on the phone. The women at the register seemed a little frazzled but was very grateful for my patience. (I've worked in food before and currently work in customer service so I know that patience can be nothing but helpful in a busy situation).  Unfortunately, they forgot a bit of our order, and forgot to cook the Octopus in the Octo salad (my fault, I didn't check) and only discovered when I arrived back home. We went back in after calling them and they made us a new salad and give us our desserts (and then some).  The staff was very friendly and nearly everyone greeted me and made sure I was being helped. The reason I'm giving them 3 stars is because of the food and the frazzledness. Overall, the quality of the food is wonderful and the atmosphere is very family-friendly.",

I didn't want to post here because the bar fills up so quickly, but the wine and food offerings are worth it. My favorite appetizers are the charred octopus (really tender and good flavor, not too briny like Mediterranean preparations--also comes with some deep fried gnocchi which is yummy), the fried calamari and shrimp (lightly battered and perfectly fried), the mussels in white wine sauce, and  the 'small' charcuterie. Some appetizers come on a bed of spring mix which becomes a nice salad, so you feel balanced when eating. As for the pastas--love the arrabiatta (I always add sausage), and chicken Parmesan. My least favorite is the carbonara, but I'm being unfair and comparing it to the carbonara I've eaten several times in Rome. Anyway, please have two seats at the bar for me. Will be back soon!",

    "text": "One day I had an extreme craving for pasta. Not the standard tomato sauce pasta that feels like it was pointed out of a can but in house made sauce that you know was made fresh. After doing much poking on yelp I came across this restaurant.   We came in right as it opened and decided to sit at the bar. I love the feel that it has of catering to locals. Kind of feels like a place that accumulates regulars and has it's own homey feel.   Ordered the prosciutto and mozarella starter, garlic bread (it's a few dollars extra compared to their regular complimentary break) because you have to have that while you eat pasta, and a pasta entree.   The bartender was awesome and super nice. The reason I say pasta entree is because I told him that I wanted him to chose what sauce and which pasta middles we got based on what he liked. It was BOMB. He said that the noodles were made fresh in house and it was definitely cooked perfectly. Will definitely be returning.",

    "text": "The mission was nearly impossible.  An affordable meal place that could please our small group of 7 or 8.  I looked and looked on Yelp for what seemed like hours.  Everything \"good\" was focused in the touristy areas.  And everything affordable was housed in buildings owned by chains.  But finally after messing with the maps and settings and filters on my iPhone app.  I finally found a place.  Spaghetty Western is a deli style Italian Restaurant.  It's got the deli counter and some four tops inside.  Imagine a small strip mall space.  It's not a fancy fine dining experience, but at no time did we have service that was anything less than high quality.  I had intended to write this review right away, but it's been a few months since we were in there.  So now many of the details have faded too much for me to fine tune my review down to dishes and the quality of food.  I apologize for this being a review that isn't up to my usual standards.  But I will toss out a few notes that I do remember.  veal saltimbocca was really good. Friendly and helpful! I think I double tipped.  Service added then I tipped 20% again!  And I honestly didn't care..the experience was well worth it! If I am in Vegas, I would go here before spending hundreds anywhere else.",

It is located in a shopping center & is a storefront restaurant, but you'd never know it once you go through the front doors. We were greeted by the Heavenly smell of sauce, pasta, pizza, garlic bread, & meatballs, making us anxious to get to our table & order our dinner. Our server, Clemente, is from Sicily & he's wonderful! He knows the menu like the back of his hand & helped us order. His charming Italian accent was easy on the ears & added a little something special to our experience. We ordered a pasta dish, a chicken salad sandwich with Caesar salad & possibly the BEST garlic bread we have ever had. All was delicious. There is a full bar & a fellow singing & playing a keyboard. He takes requests & his voice is lovely. The music is not too loud & very enjoyable. If we were Vegas residents we would eat here on a regular basis.",

We were debating where to eat and he randomly mentioned spaghetti western in another context not realizing it was the name of a restaurant in town. We took that as a sign from the food gods that it was time for pasta.  The restaurant is very small, good for takeout and they have a very small dining room where we took a seat and perused the menu. I ordered the pappardelle and my friend ordered the spaghetti and meatballs.   The pasta was perfectly cooked and al dente. The flavors were balanced and I enjoyed every bite of my dish. We both scraped our plates clean.  If Spaghetty Western was anywhere near where I live I would be there regularly. Despite the distance, I will be back!",

    "text": "I was extremely disappointed with my most recent visit to Spaghetti Western (under new ownership).   My husband and I have dined with Spaghetti Western perhaps over a hundred times, and have never been disappointed like we were this past time we went.   We were greeted at the front and promptly seated upon arriving. As usual, we ordered an appetizer (calamari), as well as our main course --both of us ordered pasta.   My husband and I noticed something had changed from the moment we walked in the door; the music was different. We didn't really think much of it, until our food arrived. We noticed the gentleman next to us was speaking to who seemed to be the manager, complaining how his appetizer should have arrived before his main course. Perfectly understandable.   Well, sure enough both, our pastas arrived promptly, with no calamari. We weren't sure if the server had forgotten about the appetizer. We inquired and his response to us was: \"Well, the pasta cooks faster the calamari\" implying that perhaps the calamari was on its way after the main course? We were both confused, because we clearly are aware that pasta cooks faster than the calamari does. It was clearly his mistake, he should have put in the calamari first, then waited to place the pasta order?   Seen as though our server was oblivious to the fact that we were upset, we decided to speak to the manager (the same gentleman we had seen earlier talking to the customer next to us). Come to find out, his name is Robert. When I explained the problem, Robert didn't seem to really care. I then went ahead and asked if the owners were available, and he proceeds to start bashing them so unprofessionally. He goes on to tell me that they are no longer there, and that he was the new owner (once I asked him if he was the manager).   He then starts spewing information about the previous owners, how they didn't pay their bills, that their books were upside down, and all this stuff, which a) is none of my business as a customer b) shows what type of people are running this place. Needless to say, EXTREMELY unprofessional!  The funny thing was that when he first approached our table, I asked him if he spoke Italian (I am Italian myself) and with disgust answers \"no!\" So rude!  He then leaves, doesn't really apologize, and a few minutes later has the waiter drop off a to-go container at the table.   My husband and I were a bit confused as to what the waiter had dropped off. We opened the bag, and there was a to-go tiramisu. We asked the waiter what it was, and he didn't even know himself! We put two and two together and figured out it was probably some sort of apology from Robert. Robert never even stopped by the table telling us he was sorry and that he was giving us the tiramisu? It was just weird! He did walk in front of our table quite a few times, but never even looked at us or nothing.   We also noticed that the food was changed from the previous owners. The fresh pasta was raw and the calamari were slimy. It was pretty horrible. It is such a shame that the previous owners left. They were always friendly, had the best food, and it is truly unfortunate that someone like Robert feels the right to spread such mean and private information about such a humble and respectable people! Just for Robert's behavior we will never return!!",

Ravioli's are stuffed with lobster and the alfredo was by far one of the best I have had and it has to be the quality of ingredients they use.  Take out time was quick and friendly..great service!

    "text": "I have been eating lunch at Spaghetty Western for the last few months a couple of times each week . Their food is excellent and authentic Italian fare .  Best meatballs in the valley! The marinara sauce is made fresh daily, sweet and delicious with great tomato flavor . Homemade soups that are better than moms , sorry mom. I took home veal parmigiana today for tonight's dinner . First of all the veal was large enough for two people and I could cut the veal with a fork , so tender and pounded thin. The service is timely and good , the owner David is present on most nights . The Italian meat and cheese selection at the deli counter is to die for , is there a more lovely cured meat than Speck ? I think not!  Do yourself a huge favor , go by for lunch or Dinner  You'll be glad you did !   Update !!! 5/28/2017 Its been quite a long time since I've visited SW. We met some friends for Saturday night dinner . Alex was very happy to see us and sat us down right away , Joe was our server and attended to us well . The atmosphere was relaxing , not too loud, but busyness under control . Our salads were fresh looking and excellent . I ordered my fav veal parm , my wife ordered the mushroom and octopus salad , my companion ordered the barb , his wife chicken Marsala. The  food came in a timely manner and as usual my VParm was spot on , fork tender , cheesy, and the marinara sauce was a stand out i have missed having .  My buddy's \"Barb\"was excellent in presentation and taste .  I love the freshly grated parm just before you take that first bite . Nice touch ! The only complaint, the chicken Marsala ,came with the wrong pasta that Joe  remedied.  The desserts were good but the Red Velvet was fantastic ! This place is worth the trip !   Update ,  Im a fan of SW ! I often dream about their meatball sandwiches. been going there since they opened , seen a lot of people come and Go , new ownership , an expansion . When i see bad reviews complaining how that new ownership is somehow responsible for a bad dining experience while specifically pining for the good old days under the previous owners The reviews are their first ones ever written , NOT EVEN a old review ,showcasing the Epic meals and service from days gone by, seem made up and possibly coached , just to cast dispersions against the present day owner .  In my opinion ,the new ownership, has taken an unprofessional, loud arguing , lack of pride in product , Restaurant and turned SW into the gem we enjoy today .  No one can get 5 stars at all times , but a one star from someone who loved the previous owners , without ever writing a single review expressing that love and how good \"their \" food was before it all changed, is suspect and does not add up .  Take the Pepsi challenge and you will find SW ready to serve you great food from authentic recipes , at a reasonable price .",

    "text": "Not sure why I haven't already written a review for this place but I have been here several times. Craving Italian then this place should be a big yes!   Atmosphere: You can expect a small intimate traditional Italian restaurant. There are maybe no more than 20 tables and is definitely a tier above casual. If you need to watch sports there are a few banquette tables facing the bar and some nights they have a live singer.   Food- based on today's adventure.   Garlic bread is a great starter. They offer complimentary bread but if you feeling a little flavor today get this starter. It's like $4  Caesar salad is solid here. I know that sounds so basic but the Caesar dressing is the bomb and portion for side salad is plentiful.  Pasta! Husband fave is the gnocchi with Pomodoro and meatballs. Today I asked for a Margherita style pasta. So Capellini with light tomato sauce with cherry tomatoes, basil, garlic, and fresh mozzarella. It hit the spot for light and simple. So what's tricky is everything is a la carte so you have to decide your pasta sauce and if you want protein. Can be difficult for the indecisive or not knowing exacting what they are craving. Expect to pay avg $15 but great portion. Don't be afraid to also tell them what you are kind of looking for and they will guide you.   Service is always consistent for me. They have that close family feel and they help each other when food comes out of kitchen. It's my cheat day splurge for carbs but they never disappoint my craving",

And one of my most favorite things in the whole wide world is they have happy hour EVERY SINGLE DAY!!!  My neighbors kept telling me how good this place was so I finally decided to try it and man was I impressed! It's located in the smith shopping center in southern highlands in the back corner and there is a pretty big parking lot so you won't have trouble finding a spot .  Upon entering you will notice a nice quaint upscale looking establishment that has decor that done extremely well, it is very inviting and classy and a great place to have a date evening. They have a piano player that plays soft music that really sets the mood and makes everything very relaxing.  Now the best part! We happened to catch their happy hour and they have a very broad menu with lots of choices and the food is half off, we got 5 food items and a drink and paid under $30...... where can you even do that anymore lol. The fried raviolis were delicious and the homemade meatballs were big savory and a melt in your mouth dream. And I don't want to forget the homemade cheese sticks they make fresh daily , they were not over fried and the cheese is extra extra creamy. I have already been back a few times and recommended this place to friends . There was so much food and the portion sizes were fantastic, actually I might need to order less next time because there was so much   I also want to give a huge shout out to the bartender Johnie , she was absolutely amazing and took the time to explain everything and made me feel like I have been going there for years! It's rare to find gems like her . Keep up the great work",

Calamari, vodka pasta, three meatball spaghetti, speck pasta with fettuccine (I added Chicken but it's better without the chicken!!) chicken parmigiana sandwich, pesto creamy with chicken & two build your own pizza which was pepperoni and sausage. I really like the pizza here. The dough was delish. The pasta of course was also delish. I was thinking that the vodka pasta would be not good but it was actually great.  I wasn't fond of the bread that came with the pasta. It's ok.   Shared parking with other stores and restaurants. It's in a big huge plaza.",

The chicken noodle soup appetizer was very tasty. We split a pizza and ordered the spaghetti with meatballs. The pizza was kinda bland and lacked flavor. The spaghetti was awesome, and the meatballs were exceptional! The interior is well done, though I would have loved a TV in the dining area. The bar has three TVs, but we were facing the opposite direction. I had the four layer cake for dessert, which was divine! I give the place an A for service, an A for the atmosphere, a B for the food only because of the bland pizza and for having just 2 beers on draft, and an A for the cost. We bought 2 thirty dollar bottles of red wine here, which comprised half of our total tab.",

There was about 12 of us, and the only thing I could recommend on is service. Our waitress did an AWESOME job serving and bar tending, holding down the whole place by herself. She did not even have to mention or complain to us about that, and we were pleased with her attentiveness to us and everyone else. I hope they hire more staff to help out but to truly acknowledge her efforts! she sure does deserve a raise!",

I looked online and saw they had a happy hour deal until 6pm, with half-priced appetizers.  When we entered the restaurant, I told the hostess it was my first time and I wasn't sure if we needed to seat ourselves or wait to be seated. She said she'd seat us. I asked if they still had happy hour until 6 and she said yes. She took us to what I thought was the bar area and seated us in a booth. When the waiter came over with menus, I asked for the happy hour menu and he told me happy hour was still going on for 30 more minutes. I ordered wine and between my boyfriend and I, we ordered 4 different appetizers to try. Just before 6pm I ordered another glass of wine. I had a friend join us and encouraged her to also order something before happy hour ended and that is when the waiter informed us that we could only get happy hour if we were seated at the actual bar and not in a booth. Seriously, we were 10 feet from the bar and no one said anything about that until after we had ordered. Needless to say, we paid over $60 for appetizers and 2 glasses of cheap house wine. And that makes this the first and last trip to this restaurant for us. Two thumbs down!",

When I say intimate I mean I could not hear myself or my dinning mate talk. Server paid more attention to his friends than us. As if we were irrelevant. If I pay 20 or more per person I want to be served and paid attention to. At least act like you care about your customers. Even if we aren't your friends. Never going back.",

My grandparents are straight from Italy so I've been raised on good Italian food. Thus, making me a very picky eater of Italian food.  We have brought our friends here and they also loved it. My eggplant was cooked to perfection.  We love the owner and Lydia one of the chefs knows how to make a phenomenal sauce. We have never experienced bad service.  In fact, we get incredible 5 star service every time we have gone.  The restaurant has a great ambiance.  If in Vegas, you must try this restaurant.  You will not regret it.",

I have dined in, taken out and used the delivery service. I stopped with deliveries and now just call an order in and pick it up because every single time we would order a delivery we had an issue. Two hour wait times, wrong items delivered etc. the worst was the wait. Every single time. The food is well worth leaving the couch. I don't think I've ate one bad thing here. The pastas, pizza, sandwiches, salads, cheese and meat platters are all so amazing. The Penne Pink Vodka is to die for and the portions are all worth the money you spend on them. Everything is shareable too. If you like Italian food you MUST check this place out, you won't be disappointed (unless you order delivery ;)).",

    "text": "Food was not acceptable,  its an ok place last minute but you shouldn't expect much.   So, based on the reply from whomever responds to these reviews, my review was not detailed enough and I did an injustice to others and myself. Here you are: First point of contention, as for your request to voice my concerns while I was there, that in deed occur. Unfortunately, if there was a manager on duty, they didn't care enough to stop by and address our concerns.  All we got was, \"I'll let someone know.\"  As for our concerns, the margherita pizza was over cooked and dry. The crust was burnt and the sauce was bitter. The same sauce used on the few bits of penne served with my chicken Parmesan. Which was so soggy from the inability to drain the water from said pasta. Due to the soggy breading on that dish, made it impossible to taste any flavor, even if there was any. The Caesar salad was more vinegar than anything. It left the romaine wilted and your attempt at homemade croutons was unsuccessful.    The service was lackluster at best. Never once did our server check on us after a course was dropped. And if there was a manager on duty, and you really wanted to know how your guests are faring, well then maybe you should show a presence on the floor. A decent restaurant manager would make a point to touch every table at least once. By not doing so and \"managing\" from the back is just lazy. That is doing others and YOURSELF a disservice. Your accusations to me of being petty and contrite are not only unprofessional, but unTrue.   You had a former restaurant manager of 15 years and a well known Chef, who has worked with some of the top chefs in the valley in your establishment that evening. Your inability to provide a modicum of a decent experience that night was YOUR fault, you failed as a restaurant and as a manager. With ALL of the eaterys in this town, especially in that shopping complex alone, I would have hoped you could have shown a little more respect for your locals. And instead of insulting me, maybe the better course of action would have been to attempt to contact me and we could have spoken about your shortfalls. You, unfortunately chose the low road.   I urge anyone who is thinking of dining in your establishment to reconsider. You'll get better food and service at Olive Garden. Good day to you!  I'm sorry David S.  I accidentally was logged in under a another persons' account. I re-posted under me so you could put a name with the review.  My purpose is not to discredit your establishment,  but to give an accurate account of my experience. I never stated I wouldn't be returning. I now feel compelled to return so we can sit down and talk face to face. This all seems too impersonal. Look forward to meeting you.",

Took off a point cause sometimes the onions don't cook down enough and some bites are too \"onion-y\"  Veal parmigiana = 9/10 large portion and not too greasy. Crust is nice and crispy, red sauce on spaghettii is flavorful!  Service is good, Alex served us a few times now and is always friendly. Sometimes we have to ask for the bread though, no biggie...

I walked out.  Tonight my husband picked up 2 sandwiches and a pizza. Why does the menu say \"toasted sub\" and instead I get soft square bread? My husband also asked for no tomatoes on my sandwich and no onions on his sandwich. Guess what made it into the sandwiches--onions and tomatoes! My husband was also ignored by the bartender when tying to get some water. Apparently texting on her phone was more important. Totally obnoxious, lacking in customer service and rude. Bartender needs to get a grip. No thanks. I can spend my money elsewhere.",

    "text": "We visit Las Vegas no less than 3 times per year. We have our favorite places to eat and we look forward to going to them when we're there.  Spaghetty Western is our new favorite place.  I was looking on Yelp for a new restaurant to try, because we're staying in an unfamiliar part of town near SouthPoint.    I was curious about the name because there's a restaurant called Spaghetti Western in Houston, Texas that I've always wanted to try and haven't, yet.  I'm reading the reviews and they're all good, except one.  The best part of his review was the owner's reply. It was, bar none, the best reply. Ever. I had to try this restaurant because the owner took a stand for his staff. He earned my respect, before I stepped into his restaurant.  When we arrived (it's a Monday night, btw) it's bustling. We're a little surprised because it's in a shopping center, but inside it's a small intimate restaurant with a dessert case full of delicious looking treats, a bar and several tables.  We are greeted and seated almost right away.  We're near the bar at first and later moved to a booth.   Our waiter, the waitstaff and the manager provided excellent customer service. I am a stickler for customer service and Las Vegas is one of the most friendly places I've ever visited.   We got the toasted ravioli appetizer. Garlicky buttery ohmygoodness served with marinara.  I ordered the Eggplant Involtini.  My favorite Italian dish that is almost never on a menu except at Spaghetty Western. The capellini served al dente. Wow. They were channeling my grandfather.  It was so good. It tasted homemade and definitely made with care and by someone who loves food and how it tastes.  My girlfriend got penne (al dente , also) with pink vodka sauce and grilled chicken. The flavor was divine.  I had a glass of Chianti with my meal and the flavors of the sauce complimented my wine.    Without a doubt, this was one of the best and definitely one of my most favorite meals in  Vegas.",

We came in to see the Spaghetti Western movie posters on the walls and reminisced about the various movies (The Good, Bad, and the Ugly being our favorite).  The music playing in the background was something else too; Commodores, KC & Sunshine Band, MC Hammer, Queen, etc. Not your normal romantic music in the background - LOL.  I ordered the Pasta Carbonara with sausage. The portion was huge and had an awesome flavor. The noodles were perfectly cooked. Firm enough for flavor , yet soft enough to spin on your fork.   I also order a side of garlic bread with marinara sauce. This was a perfect compliment to the pasta.  For the price, this is/was an excellent value. It was flavorful and in huge portion. Definitely added to me \"Go To\" list of restaurants.",

    "text": "The worse \"Italian\" (I use this word loosely) spot I ate in 2019 out of around 30.  Before I start I will say that the place is spotless, the service is top notch, the whole staff was friendly and accommodating.  I cannot say a bad word about anyone there (except the \"chefs\").  Italian Cooking 101: The most basic dish is spaghetti and meatballs.  Literally any establishment that has any worth should have a near perfect dish of this staple.  I ordered this dish and when it arrived in less than 10 minutes I was horrified at what I saw.  Their spaghetti is a touch thicker than what I would deem is the average size so cooking time due to thickness should be a touch longer.  However, the spaghetti was overcooked and the sauce was poured on top of it!?!?!  Seriously?  Has anyone at this place done the most basic beginner lessons in Italian cooking?  Spaghetti is suppose to ABSORB the sauce and should be tossed in it and not poured on top which causes the spaghetti to be uneven and has loads of water condensation at the bottom of the plate.  The plates bottom was covered in roughly 2 oz of watery liquid and this is so wrong.  It's freaking spaghetti and meatballs!  If you can't make the most basic dish in Italian cuisine than any dish that is even slightly more complicated would be worse.  I would personally be embarrassed if I served this dish to anyone at my house.  The sauce quality was ok to the taste but the ineptness of of marrying the pasta to sauce was comical.  I'll admit I'm not a big meatball guy but their's was ok.  I did not see the point of asking for anything else or having a redo because it would be pointless, the same exact dish would come out.  I did not complain, I paid my bill and tipped my waitress and left and don't see the point to come back ever.  Just trying to write a fair and honest review.",

It's so good that my husband just wants an order of the grilled shrimp.   The pasta was cooked al dente. It had a lot of flavors and was so filling. It was a bit oily on the bottom which is why it was rated 4/5 but it was still very good.   Either drain the oil out or if you're like me and order from DoorDash or Uber eats, just switch the trays and that should help.   I have ordered this twice and it seems they are pretty consistent with this one. I would highly recommend.   They have officially bumped up to 5 stars!  I ordered meatballs and they were so tender and moist! Portion size amazing. I ordered the sausage and peppers, delicious! It was extremely flavorful and their caprese salad was delicious!",

While it's a small restaurant and they probably manage on two-three wait staff it's at the detriment of the customer experience. That's a non-negotiable for me. Anywho, my friend arrived before me so she already had her drink. I finally ordered one and it took about 10 mins to get it even though I sat directly across from the bar. When I was ready to order a second glass, they were out :(    To support my point about service, we received our bread after our meal arrived. I had to ask a team member walking by to get it for us. On to the food, my friend ordered the chicken parmesan which she loves. I ordered the lobster ravioli which was good although I didn't love the sauce. We shared a Caesar salad which was good.   We decided to order dessert because my friend swears by their Tiramasu which I don't like so I opted for the cheesecake..... it was bad, like from your local grocer bad. Our very kind waiter was apologetic throughout the night and he comped dessert because they didn't have more of the wine I liked.   In the end, I will return because I enjoyed everything including the live music. The service is just not optimal for anyone.",

    "text": "Hubby wants to go out to dinner and lets me choose the venue.  I adore Italian so I surf Yelp and spy some great reviews.  But the title of \"Spaghetty Western\" is what caught my eye.  Charming, fun, thoughtful and ... Italian (!).  We arrived and enjoyed walking into a very NICE establishment.  Kinda busy but not in a crowded way, just the beginning of weekday dinner rush.  The large 3-page menu took a bit of time to choose from, as there were so many choices and combinations.  I chose to go simple with the basic spaghetti pasta, topped with house marinara and (3) meatballs, along with a glass of wine.  Husband chose the classic pasta with Carbonara sauce.  Our server was helpful, pleasant and seamlessly answered all of our dining questions.  While waiting for our dishes to be delivered, we noted and appreciated the warm decor, the framed and old-timey Spaghetti Western movie posters and the curious music in the background.   I say \"curious\" because I would put the music as disco era stuff but did not seem to \"'match\" the ambiance of the restaurant.  We were not complaining, mind you, as my husband and I are of an age that LIKES that type of music.  We just found it amusing as we sang along to a few of the songs.  Dinner arrived and woah (!) were my meatballs large.  I suppose I should not have eaten so much pre-meal warm bread slices, because I was not able to finish my delicious spaghetti.  The rest, I decided, had to go home with me.   Husband reports that the final bill for our meal tonight was appropriate for the amount and quality of food, as well as the outstanding service our gal gave us.  I would definitely be returning to this place.",

    "text": "My husband and I order delivery from this restaurant quite a bit. We dined in once, but didn't care for the environment. (It was very brightly lit and tables were crammed together with no booth options.) The red wine (Zinfandel which is all I drink) was quite pricy too and they only had one option.  Now, on to the food! Everything we have eaten here has been delicious. My favorite is eggplant Parmesan with veggies instead of pasta. The veggies are sauteed in olive oil and garlic, delish! The eggplant isn't heavily breaded like most eggplant parmesans which I love. The sauce is yummy as well. My husband likes to order pasta in a spicy arrabiata sauce, lasagna Bolognese, or a meatball appetizer. My favorite appetizer has to be the fried mozzarella! They make it fresh in-house,  it's lightly breaded, and delicious.   Although, we may never return to the restaurant in person, we will definitely continue to order delivery from this tasty restaurant.",

Like, wow! They had so much room for our party of 10 including 4 kids. Now that I have a baby of my own, I was happy to see that they had so much room for us. I thought it was gonna be crapped but, there was even enough room for our car seat/baby carriers.  Not only was there significant space for us, there was LIVE MUSIC *mind blown* and the guy was pretty good on his little keyboard. Playing Sinatra to John Legend to Queen.  I ordered the lasagna which was FAB!!!! Especially loved their garlic bread. As simple as it was, it was deliciously soft, buttery, and garlicky....that I wanted to order my own plate of them =)",

    "text": "Just happened to look for a local place near my brothers house and found Spaghetty Western. We weren't expecting much but I was totally wrong. I liked the place the second we walked through the door. It has a very inviting vibe.  We were seated in the back left corner of the restaurant, which was perfect for us because we overlooked the entire restaurant. Our server, Peggy, was the nicest, sweetest, coolest person. We had a great time with her during our visit. Thanks, Peggy!  I ordered the bruschetta as an appetizer and it was DELICIOUS! I devoured pretty much all of it and the olives that came with it. Then I ordered spaghetti and meatballs, which was delicious too. My Mother ordered a cheesesteak that was Really really good! We're originally from the Philadelphia area and know about the best cheese steaks known to humans. It's impossible to get an incredible Philly cheese steak anywhere else outside Philly and New Jersey, but the Spaghetty Western's cheesesteak was freakin' good.   I really love that this place also has an Italian deli. I'll definitely be back for that and for another meal. I want to try the other delicious looking items on the menu.   Go go go to Spaghetty Western. Bring an appetite! Great atmosphere, great staff and delicious foods. What could be better?",

They expanded the dining room so it's easier (but not too easy during peak times) to get a table. The menu has a good amount of items sure to please anyone's taste, and everything I've tried is delicious. You can tell they take their time to make the sauces from scratch & do the prep-work right. Many of the previous owner's recipes are still prepared pretty much as before & contain some cool NE Italian/Southwest fusion dishes (chili lasagne is amaze-balls) as well as traditional favorites (chicken pamesean is my litmus test for an Italian restaurant, and it is fantastic here).  It's really out of the way for me & most people living in the valley, but it's so good I like to make the trip when I can splurge on a nice meal (but don't want to pay strip prices either).   100t recommend.",

The reason why I'm only giving it 3 stars was I ordered the caprese  sandwich and really it wasn't worth it for $9.95  It was huge (even posted a shot of it) had great flavor to the balsamic and usual greens but really just one thick piece of Mozarella  cheese on it..just one. The  bad part about the sandwich  was the bread was very bready and very dried out so I ended up just leaving most of the bread on the plate.  Not sure how the cook could have not noticed that it was so dry and getting hard. hmmm. I could have mentioned the dried out bread (the main part of a sandwich) but I usually don't  make a stink in local places that are not chains. Kinda hoped they would have asked how everything  was but never did so I just let it pass.  However I did see everyone else getting some great looking pasta so next time I'm going to order that.  I really want to like this place I am going to return and give it another try. Order the Pasta would be my tip, wish I had  :(",

I tried to ask or server and manager multiple times if they could turn the heat up, to which they replied, it takes a while.  The place didn't get one degree warmer the entire time my family ate there.  I couldn't even tell you how the food was that day.  We had a female bartender acting as our server and she couldn't seem to get anything to our table in a reasonable amount of time.  All around horrible experience.  There is nothing worst then eating while freezing, especially when the food is not cheap.  It should have been a nice family experience but we won't be back.  I'll go next door where they turn the heat on from now on.",

    "text": "First, to address the negative comments about the female server: people have bad days and some can't handle stress as well as others. At times she seemed distracted, but she has little help with a full dining room. To add to this: most regulars seemed to expect her to drop everything and help them. Be patient, people...and lighten up! She knew all of the regulars and knew what they ordered in the past. That's not easy to keep track of! She was awesome with our 3 year old, knew the menu and was able to make awesome suggestions for us. BONUS. The food was amazing. We had the antipasto plate...the meats were incredible and I'm a prosciutto SNOB! We also ordered entrees (5 of us total)...there were NO complaints. There was enough food for each of us to take home and enjoy again for lunch the next day.  If you are a gnocchi fan, I highly recommend it! I had it with pink vodka sauce and it was de-lish.  The thing I really didn't like about this place was the marks the chair left on my legs. The seating is not comfy - it is more for deli-seating...in and out. If you want to relax and have a drink with dinner, you may want to take the food to go. If they had different chairs, non-wicker type, 5 stars for sure.  This is a 5-star to go place!!",

Not that it was a bad thing, just wasn't expecting such a small space. Happen to go when they weren't so busy but not sure how they accommodate larger crowds during busier hours. Due to the space limitations, I imagine most people call in their orders and do take out. Anyhoo, I'm constantly searching around for the best Italian food and this place was not bad. Wouldn't say it would land the title as my \"fav\" however, I enjoyed my meal. We ordered the Chicken Parmigiana sub, Cheese Pizza, and half order of Chicken Alfredo pasta. Must say I have had better tasting alfredo sauce, however it was not bad. I really liked the sauce on the sub, had a sweetness to it that I enjoyed. And the cheese pizza was yummy too but they maybe used a little too much of the flour on the bottom of the pizza as it was everywhere. But that tiny little gripe didn't ruin the taste. So in all, not a bad little Italian spot. I'll be back to try out some other dishes from here!",

My boyfriend and I can get an appetizer, two entrees and a dessert for less than $50. And the food is amazing. Our favorites are the mushroom appetizer (mushrooms and melted cheese on bread with a marinara dipping sauce) chicken piccata, chicken marsala, and the pasta carbonera.

His special he cooked more like authentic Italian which was why he suggested it to me. Yeah, spot on. American Italian is terrible. Terrible. It's so hard to find an authentic Italian restaurant in the States so when you do, you should definitely order that all the time over the American, and if you prefer the American Italian style, you need to really work on your taste buds because authentic Italian food is awesome. So I got a long really well with the owner and when you come in to order, tell him to cook it authentic Italian.",

The food is amazing, and the staff is very friendly, and able to maintain that close, family service attitude. I am very impressed!  We had the Cavatelli Rustici & their Special of the Day: a wonderful Pappardelle Recipe!  I am a huge fan of homemade pastas, and this place hits home!   I know with expanding restaurants there are going to be growing pains, which was apparent with some food logistics issues, but they were able to maintain their composure and accommodated us for our extended wait time.  This is a great place, and a great gem in the Southern Highlands Community.  I can't wait to go back!",

    "text": "I've eaten here twice now.   The first time I dined there and had a Caesar salad and the lobster ravioli. Caesar was nothing special but the ravioli was great. Service was prompt and friendly. I would give that visit 4 stars.   Today we ordered takeout. I ordered:  The Northern caprese  Caesar salad Meatball appetizer Calabrese sandwich  Manicotti  A lot of food- and for $63 including delivery fee/tax, I would expect it to be delicious... but it really fell short this time.   The tomatoes on the caprese disappointed me most. So far from ripe the middles were completely white. If that's all you have, I think the item should be removed from the menu until you have better produce. You can't have a caprese with bad tomatoes.   Caesar was same... But lettuce was a little wilted here and there.   The garlic bread was super dry and even stale tasting. Maybe because of the delivery time.   My boyfriend said the meatballs were \"meh,\" and the calabrese got a thumbs down.   My manicotti was fine. Not bad. Not good. Honestly I like the premade ones at trader joes better.   This delivery I would give 2 stars. I've averaged out my 2 visits to the 3. My boyfriend says I'm being generous and is trying to make me go someplace else for a lunch re-do.",

We keep on ranking them but it really is hard to choose which one we like best.  Ate last Saturday mar.11 with the whole family. It was my hubby's first time so i ordered the speck pasta. After ordering it, our server asked him soup or salad and my hubby chose soup. Our serverr replied with a name of a soup and we thought maybe that was the soup of the day. My children were surprised  the pasta cane with soup or salad. The server didn't ask would you want soup or salad, he came off like my husband should choose one or the other. Well, the mystery was solved when we saw an extra $7.95 on our bill. Aside from that, my daughter asked him to add chicken to her pasta, well he added shrimp which costs more. Is he trying to pull a fast one on all his customers? We had him change it but i am sure they just took out the shrimp and replaced it with chicken because it didn' t take long to replace. Good thing my daughter has no allergy to shrimp!. First time around everything was good. I will still go back but i will make sure he is not our server! I will never forget his face.  The other server who was giving water deservd the tip we left.",

First I must acknowledge  the friendliness and willingness of the staff and management. It was an absolute pleasure to dine here and though this was our first time here we felt so comfortable and appreciated (so rare these days!)  Now the really good stuff...we ordered the antipasto misto. You choose 3 meats and 2 cheeses from a great selection imported from Italy  (their mozzarella is homemade and is excellent too!) The antipasto arrived on a huge platter with our selection plus peppers, artichokes, variety of olives, sundried tomatoes all on a bed of greens. This was one of the best antipasto platters I ever had and the portion is generous so there is plenty to go around and the quality of this antipasto was outstanding. My husband ordered spaghetti and meatballs which he said was delicious and served piping hot....the sauce was excellent and the meatballs were too. I had the gnocchi in meat sauce also served piping hot and was excellent too. We shared a dessert but for the life of me I cannot remember the name of but it was a cross between mousse and ice cream and it disappeared from our plate in seconds YUM!! Our waitress was very nice and pleasant  and she knew the menu well. Our drinks were always filled without having to ask and she checked on us frequently. I really liked after we were finished eating and needed to go containers she took our plates and came back with everything packaged nicely for us. Most places just give you the containers and you have to juggle this yourself so this was a nice surprise. So I hope I have convinced you to give this place a try. You will not be disappointed.",

The salad was packed with fresh tomatoes, sun dried bell peppers, sun dried tomatoes, olives, red onions, artichoke, fresh mozzarella and pepperocini on spring mix lettuce and spinach. The standard salad dressing is Italian. Their chicken soup was also large in portion served with mini pasta shells, mall pieces of chicken, carrots and celery. I really liked that the soup was not too salty. I hate when restaraunts get salt happy and often times chicken soups come out very salty. If you think it's too bland, you have the option of adding more salt and pepper. Each dish comes with a half toasted garlic bread. As the main dish (I didn't know I was going to have so much food), I had the lunch size Vodka pink pasta with penne. The penne was cooked perfectly. Not too overcooked or undercooked, al dente just the way I like it. The sauce was thick and creamy and flavor was good. Lastly, I ordered a butternut squash ravioli in 4 cheese with panchetta and mushrooms as recommended by one of the employees. It also did not disappoint. The price is very reasonable especially considering their portions. I'd definitely come back to this place again.",

The marinara sauce takes 9 hours to make and BOY DOES IT TASTE AMAZING! I got the cheese ravioli which was cooked to PERFECTION! I cannot get enough of this place. I also believe they get  all their meat and cheese from Italy. Oh my gosh. LOVE!",

I watched the cashier make my anti pasta appetizer and did not wear gloves..some people I know would freak out and leave the place.. I didn't  However, they got the rest of my order wrong and since it was now 45 minutes later, I said it was fine and left.  I don't think I will return. Their food is way expensive and should be better quality. The bread wasn't even good.  I'm bummed, cause it sounded like a great place according to other reviews.",

Our server came by with a basket of delicious (but super soft) bread and got drink and appetizer orders. When she came back, she got our food orders. I order spaghetti & meatballs and he ordered a meatball sub (his came with a salad or soup).   So our mozzarella sticks arrived and they were AMAZING. Oh my gosh, like super delicious. Apparently they make them fresh there, not frozen ones. But then our food came and they brought his sandwich before his salad, which was weird. My pasta was good, but I guess the meatballs were a little lackluster. They could have used some more seasoning and maybe cooking a little longer. They weren't raw or pink inside, but they also just didn't seem well cooked, if that makes sense.   The place itself is pretty cute. A mixture of tables and booths...we sat in a corner booth with a view of the whole place. There were movie posters on the wall and a bar area in the main seating area. In the little area where you walk in, it's more like a pick up counter (and has their dessert case).   Our servers were good. The main one was very friendly, and her assistant brought stuff out pretty quickly. He was also good on filling up our drinks again.  Overall, mostly good experience. I don't think I'd order the meatballs again, but that's just because I like mine a bit more well done.",

    "text": "We decided to try Spegetty Western for lunch yesterday.  It's a somewhat small storefront in the Southern Highlands strip mall.  We were greeted immediately upon entering and told we could take any open table we liked.  Since this is a small restaurant, there are not an abundance of tables, but we had a choice of 3 that were open.  Our waiter brought us waters and menus right away, and took our drink order.  We ordered a meatball sandwich (3 meatballs, marinara, melted\rparmigiano and mozzarella) $10.95 and a chicken parm sandwich (fried chicken cutlet covered with\rmarinara, melted parmigiano and mozzarella) $11.95.  They were nice enough to cut the sandwiches in half and put 1/2 of each on each plate so we could share.  The homemade meatballs and chicken cutlets were both tasty, but really large for a sandwich, so we cut everything in half so we could pick them up to eat.  The bread was fresh and soft, the sauce was acidic, not sweet (just the way I like it), & the cheese was toasty and bubbly.  I was glad they brought a bowl of sauce because it was so good on the sandwiches, plus we could add it to the chicken and meatballs that didn't fit on the bread.  We will definitely be back for dinner to try the cavatelli, gnocchi, and other pasta dishes that looked amazing coming out of the kitchen.  And maybe a cannoli!",

The restaurant was at 35 percent capacity...not busy. They brought out our entrees and I said can you please tell us where our salads are...waiter said what do you mean? I said we have not received them. He said....so you want me to cancel them now? I said yes please...  We ordered the spaghetti and meatballs (excellent), penne Bobbi (excellent) and lobster shrimp ravioli (ok but they used canned shrimp). These 3 items are only reason I'm giving 2 stars.   When my daughter got her cheese pizza she took one bite and whispered mom this is horrible! I thought she was being a picky kid... until I tried it...tasted like burnt plastic! Just like the bread.  We told the waiter about the bread tasting burnt who said \"we have a know-it-all-chef so I will tell him but it won't do any good.\" Whaaaaaattt? I asked him to please tell chef and try the dough so they don't serve it to anyone else. He came back and said the chef is using a different broiler oven because our pizza oven is broke and we didn't see any plastic in it. I asked if he tried the bread...he said no. Wtf?!

If you had visited when the first remodeled and the service was rocky, PLEASE come back and give it a try. The food is delicious and I have gone about 8 times since then and they have their steady staff now.

Then we got our calamari and it just didn't taste good so we didn't eat it, he then asked if we didn't like it and I was truthful and said no. He took it and said we will remove it from your check.

This place has a small deli selection which I believe are meats from Italy. Definitely plan on trying other items on the menu, oh I also like their caprese salad when I'm in the mood. Definitely check this place out, it's hard to find authentic restaurants, that are delicious!",

I tried to order to pick up for 30 minutes with their phone going to voicemail or a busy tone. We decided to just go and order there. The kid they have working the register is really a poor choice in hiring. His angst and poor disposition really isn't what I would want for my customers first interaction at my restaurant. He asked if we had a pick up to which we replied no. He looked annoyed, started looking at all the tickets and says \"well it's going to be like a 25 minute wait\". I informed him of my trying to call and how I would have loved to have had a pick up but no one literally picked up the phone. He sighed and going \"it's been super busy in here.\" There were two tables with customers in the restaurant and 2 people waiting for their own take out orders. We still ordered but had to endure a bunch of passive aggressive looks and watched the cashier give each customer after us the same amount of sass. The food was definitely good but until the service improves its not worth the hassle.",

    "text": "We used to love this place but it's slowly going down hill. Perhaps they are just getting too greedy. I ordered my go-to, a meatball sandwich, the other night with extra sauce on the side. I noticed that the total was more than usual and when I looked at the check I saw they charged $2 for an extra side of sauce that they didn't even bother to put in the bag. When I returned to request the sauce that I had paid for, the gave me a very very small container. When I made a comment about the size the lady lied and said they also added extra sauce to the actual sandwich, which they did not. I understand policies change but at the very least the person taking my order could have let me know about the price increase. Its only $2 but that's not the point. It's just disappointing when perfectly good restaurants stop caring about customer satisfaction and begins worrying more about the bottom line. If they are so worried about making a few extra bucks on some sauce, it makes me concerned that perhaps they are also cutting corners with the quality of ingredients in their kitchen.",

This was the only thing she ate all day.  About an hour and a half later her stomach was in so much pain.  After trying to tough it out all night she wound up in the E.R. at 3 am with food poisoning and has been laid up in bed for 3 days already and I've had to call out of work for 3 days to care for our baby since she can't.  I personally like the place but i'd probably avoid the seafood at all costs and sad to say that I probably will never go back, overall with lost wages and E.R. bills an inexpensive meal came out to be a really expensive one.  Disappointed to say the least.",

We ordered appetizers, our entrees and said we'd probably get dessert. After she brought our drinks we never saw her again. This is a place that's slogan is \"authentic Italian really fast\". There was nothing fast about this place. 30 minutes later waiting outside our main entrees arrived...no silverware, no drink refills and most importantly no appetizer. At this point the service, if you can call it that, is a complete joke. I went inside to ask for silverware as well as to cancel our appetizer order since we already had our main course. The other table outside waited even longer but they were patient since they said they knew one of the owners...someone supposedly named Terry. The only reason they get one star is because the food was actually quite good...& Yelp doesn't let you give zero stars. Will we ever come back? Probably not and its because of the horrible service. Which is sad since the food was actually quite good.",

Ok so yeah places sometimes are a little slower than usual so I show up 35 minutes later. When I walk in I tell them I was there to pick up the order. \"Oh yeah it will be a couple of minutes more\" the hippie looking guy at the register said. 5 minutes later I see the cook barely putting the raw chicken on the pan and starting to cook it. Needless to say, my food wasn't ready until another 15 minutes and an argument with them over what was the point of me ordering ahead for take out?! I might as well have just gone there and ordered in person because they didn't start making the food until after I got there! Their excuse was that they're a family owned business and they're busy. Ummmm you have 2 tables with people at them and what does being a family owned business have anything to do with it?!??? That's not an excuse as far as I'm concerned. They couldn't have cared less and they just kept repeating that lame excuse. The only reason for the 2 stars is that their food was OK but service is everything and Spaghetty Western FAILS at that!!",

    "text": "This small family run restaurant is such a welcome addition to southern highlands which is so lacking in good eats. If you are looking for authentic Italian meats and cheeses you need to try this! I have not eaten in yet but have done takeout many times and delivery also. (They always say 30 to 45 mins and are here in about 15!) so far I've tried the cioppino ( my fav dish) it's excellent with lots of fresh shellfish, shrimp, crab legs and fish. The 12 dollar antipasto misto is awesome! You can pick 3 meats and 2 cheeses or let the chef put it together. It comes with olives, sundries tomatoes, artichokes, roasted peppers and some greens ..( ask for some of their amazing balsamic glaze on the side. ) iced tried several different pastas with meatballs and meat sauce too. Pastas were cooked perfectly al dente and reheated well too.  Meatballs were perfect texture and flavourful. I also love their caprese salad. The fresh mozzarella is some of the best I've had! They also have my fav dessert ever which is tiramisu and theirs is awesome great cocoa and coffee flavors and so light and creamy. I would rate this a solid 4/12 stats but they need a few improvements.. The seats in the restaurant are very uncomfortable even for the short time while I waited for my takeout. Plus they could improve their takeout containers .. The boxes are okay for drier items but for my cioppino it seeps through a little and I live less than 5 mins away. All in all please try this place and support our local family run restaurants!",

After their expansion the prices have gone up considerably (over 20%, I know bc I checked the two take out menus I still had at home) and it has lost the charm that it had as a small family restaurant. Sure, the inside looks fantastic and it has a bar now. But part of the appeal before was that you felt like you were getting excellent food at a great price in an intimate setting. The food was just so so. A few parts of our order (substitute penne for angel hair, white sauce instead of red) were wrong.  Aside from that I suppose there are some new investors now because I keep seeing an older gentleman there who makes his presence known and greeted a few tables. He was wearing flip flops - unless I'm at a beach shack, I think this is highly inappropriate. And he's very obnoxious - asked us how our food was literally seconds after it was sat in front of us and nobody had even taken a bite yet. We watched him block the main walking area when paying customers were trying to get through. We also heard him complaining about a staff member being late - keep that kind of comment away from the customers.",

We got our food at 5:05, to go, no less. (These are exact times!) no one told us our food would take a while... Watching 10 people come in and get their food! A little communication people! For two people our bill w/ tip was 50.00! Not to slam anyone as we haven't tried our food.. Yet. Why??? BECAUSE WE HAVE ZERO UTENSILS OR NAPKINS in our to go bag!! I'm starving! If this food isn't good... Lisa our manicurist is going to hear an earful!!!",

The menu is a little off kilter which I'm usually a fan of but the flavors don't really seem to do it for me.   My husband however and one of my co-workers are always asking me to go back there. They love it.   It's more of a northern Italian cuisine rather than the southern Italian I am usually used to.   The best thing on the menu is the butternut squash ravioli. It gets a 4. Try it. Everything else I tried: spaghetty western gets a 2. Meatball sandwich 3.   It's definitely different if you're not in the traditional Italian mood but are craving pasta. Still worth giving a shot.",

So imagine your eyes are closed, now imagine you are in Italy and your walking down the brick walk ways and your hungry so you dip into a little eatery for a bite to eat. You step into Spaghetty Western and you see a deli counter with different meats cured as Italian's do and cheeses, wines and deserts, you seat yourself at a little cafe style table, the waitress comes over and welcomes you and takes your drink order, her accent is strong and you listen carefully to make sure you hear her right. She brings back your drink orders and you order your meal, chicken parm and spaghetti and meatballs.(make sure to get an extra order of garlic bread you wont be disappointed). You smell the aroma of your food being prepared and you know this is no processed type Italian food, its pure authentic family recipe Italian food. The food comes out and looks amazing! The food is full of flavor, the red sauce tastes like they just made it that day, the noodles al dente! the motzerella cheese is to die for!! the flavor and the pull of the cheese when you eat it is sport on! The waitress comes and checks on us through out the meal. She brings boxes at the end because the portions are enough for 2 people. She tells us when we are ready to pay to meet her at the counter. Ok now open your eyes again.... you just had an Authentic Italian meal in Las Vegas...lol The food here is amazing feels like when you step in the door you go through a portal to Italy. From the look of the restaurant, to the Italian server, to the authentic food. They have a wide variety on their menu, they offer delivery if you are in their coverage area, and take out as well. The place is small but cozy and very clean, the bathrooms was spotless which is nice, there is nothing worse than a great meal and then going into a dirty bathroom. If you love italinan food you really have to give this place a try and your welcome for taking you on a trip to italy in the middle of the day...lol",

Once I got here, I was promptly seated and ordered a few apps to tide me over while I waited for my friends to join me.  I first ordered the garlic bread with c, which wasn't really impressive but ok I suppose for the price.  Then, because my buddies were late, I ordered the antipasto misto, which did not disappoint - a large portion of Italian meats and cheeses were presented to me literally overflowing from the plate.   When my buddies finally made it to the restaurant, I ordered the Chicken Saltimbocca with angel hair pasta which is fried chicken wrapped in prosciutto and cheese... wow. You can imagine how good that was... it lasted me two meals... yummy.",

I used to get their delivery service like once a week. Since I live in the golf club, it was so convenient and fast delivery. I loved it. For some reason, they stopped the delivery service about a year ago, so I stopped eating their food. (Sorry I don't want to use Bite squad.) Today, I didn't want to drive far since it was Friday the 13th so I decided to eat at this place again. Well, I wanted to try \"the Bobbie\" for a while so it was a good thing. It was very nice and flavorful. Loved the strong garlic accent.  I would not drive 10 miles to come here and eat, but if you are in the area, you should try this place. Oh, about a year ago, they told me they were expanding the store since it's a tiny place... What happened to that??!! (Minus one star for no more delivery service. Minus one star for very limited seating.)",

    "text": "FOOD POISONING!!! - My first time ordering from this restaurant was on a very lazy and  hungry day where I wanted food delivered to me.  This showed up on Yelp for delivery services. Took a peek at some pictures and decided to order the Chicken Parmesan with pasta and the Linguini Fisherman. The gentleman who took my order had decent customer service and the food was delivered to my house within 30 mins.   After tasting both dishes, I honestly thought what I ordered was just ok. Didn't hit the spot but it helped the empty stomach I had and probably would of kept me full for the rest of the day.   A couple of hours later my stomach started cramping severely and out came the vomit and well.. everything else that comes with the territory.   This was the first time in my life where I've EVER had this happen to me. My GF came helping me after her finding me in fetal position on my bathroom floor. I didn't know wether if I should of went to the hospital or if I should just ride it out. I decided to ride it out and save myself from unwanted expensive hospital bills. I pretty much was stuck in my bathroom the remaining night. I would NEVER write a bad review unless it was necessary. This is a SERIOUS incident that left me crying and in A LOT of pain.  I wanted to see if anyone had the same incident to help me decide wether I should say anything about the food. So I started going through the reviews and saw that there were a few who have WITNESSED many health code violations in person. There was one review stating where the cook touched raw chicken and continued to touch pots and pans. Another incident where they saw the cook running his fingers through his hair numerous times and then touched bread with his bare hands. One where a cook stuck his fingers in his mouth to grab food from his teeth and Whattada know.. One review where the SAME dish was ordered and left a woman in the emergency room for FOOD POISONING! Is this the same cook or are all of them unsanitary?!!  The fact that these people have seen these things in person doesn't surprise me that whoever prepared my meal would be completely careless and unsanitary to food that are being delivered to homes (people) away from eyes witnessing it first hand.   I WILL NEVER SUGGEST NOR COME BACK TO THIS PLACE EVER AGAIN. And I truly feel sad that this is located in a nice area like Southern Highlands. Major disappointment.Please be careful if you eat here. You never know what else goes on in the kitchen and if you could be the next person to go through this.",

It's a legit Northern Italian deli, whose wares in that department are best enjoyed in a misto platter - three meats and two cheeses chosen by you and paired with olives, artichokes and red pepper - or on a sandwich.  Although I prefer the hot sandwiches. The meatballs are made with the perfect smooth mildness to contrast with the cut of the sauce and the creaminess of the cheese. My go-to menu item here is the chicken parm sandwich - which may be, honest to god, the best example of this simple dish that I've ever had. Just perfection.  Everything's super fresh, made to order, created with obvious love. What did we do to deserve you?",

I ordered the oven baked penne and my sis ordered the regular ole spaghetti and meatballs. This was at about 7pm. Three hours later my sister is violently ill with the works, my first thought and hers-food poisoning. This lasts until about 1 am she tells me. Fast forward and it is day 2 and she is still feeling nauseous with stomach cramping. I get that it's flu season but this meal was the defining factor- she was feeling great all day before eating here. Be careful. This is the first time we've eaten this food and gotten sick. My meal was apparently okay, but hers made her very sick and she is now afraid to eat this food ever again. We won't be back. Word of warning don't eat here if you don't want to be up sick all night.",

I will say I thought the food seemed a little better before the expansion but I went last night around closing so that could've been the difference. It won't effect my 5/5 stars. I'll still be back again. Try the calamari, caprese salad, anything w the vodka sauce (bc I love it!), the lobster ravioli all day, all the dessert, then do it again the next day!

The quality of the food is consistently good. I am a big fan of the Spaghetti and meatballs and the caesar salad. Also, the pasta E fagioli and chicken soup are exceptional. Each of the soups are home made and you can taste it. The atmosphere is festive and fun for a local food spot and certainly better than average for a neighborhood dining establishment. I also recommend the bolognese, slighty sweet with a great meat sauce.  If you live in southern highlands put Spaghetty Western at the top of your list for feeding that Italian craving and grab a glass a wine.",

It's not a big location, so I see how it can seem crowded from time to time. Between our table, we had soups, salads, lasagna, spaghetti and a whole wheat pasta. Soup was fair according to my Mom. Salads were good. Sun dried tomatoes and artichoke hearts were on the salad, something you normally don't see. Entrees were very good, enjoyed by all.

This originally was a much smaller venue and it was a mom and pop Italian place and I personally think the food was a little bit better then because they had more options. One of my least favorite things that spaghetty western did when they took over was to get rid of the manicotti. I truly believe they should bring that back! Otherwise the expansion is fabulous and the staff is always friendly. The kitchen needs some tweaking but over all a  wonderful experience!",

Everything about this place was just right.   1.) Service was on point... waiter (I think his name was LeMetta... sorry I probably misspelled his name) was incredibly attentive and friendly. Everything came out super quick. Very impressive considering how busy it got by 7:00.  2.) Food was EXCELLENT... my chicken cacciatore was perfect, possibly the best I've had in Vegas. My buddy also loved his meal... I took one of his meatballs, and it was also great.   3.) Live music was PERFECT... singing piano man Peter sang the best songs and took our requests. Very impressed with his music. He really added to the quality of the experience. I hope they have him sing there on a regular basis.  4.) Other positives include the decor, they've got a bunch of movie posters on the wall (love the Fistful of Dollars poster - great touch!!) and the cheesecake... MAN THAT WAS SO GOOD. I took it home and finished it in about 5 minutes LOL  We will DEFINITELY be back soon. Please don't change a thing. Thank you for a great dinner and experience.",

The service was great and the workers/owners here are so nice.  They offer a lunch deal where it comes with soup or salad and a main dish for $11.99 I believe. My friend ordered the lunch special with caesar salad and pink vodka sauce with angel hair noodles and I ordered cacio e pepe with spaghetti noodles. They gave us complimentary bread with seasoned olive oil as a starter. We shared her caesar salad because it was a full size, and it was good! We got our pasta shortly after. I loved both of them. The cacio e pepe was so buttery, cheesy, and simply seasoned with fresh black pepper. Simple and good. I really loved the pink vodka sauce here, it was delicious with the angel hair. It was creamy and so flavorful, I will probably order it the next time I go.  The lunch special was a good deal. The portions were large enough for us to take some home.",

Hands down for delicious pasta that is either a 9/10 or 10/10 every single time. Doesn't matter which chef, how busy they are etc. the food is just consistently good and that is a rarity now a days. The carbonara, pomodoro, and their bobby pasta are faves among all my friends.   If you're new to town, just visiting... want a delicious and authentic bite of Italian pasta, as corny as it sounds. You have to try this place. I've ordered here or eaten here about 30 times over the last 3 years and my only ever food complaints were that I didn't order more. Seriously. It's that good. Enjoy :)",

The only downside is that they use package hot chocolate. The house salad was heavy on olives but still less plain than other house salads plus it came with bread. The lobster ravioli was the most disappointing. It was bland despite the looks.",

    "text": "Came back again, because it was so good.  I just moved here from the Bay Area, so I'm excited and anxious to try all of the great food around the area and I'm so glad that I found this great Italian place by the house.  I LOVE the play on the name of the place! The space is cute, quaint and well decorated. (People who are docking stars because of the small space need to get over themselves and never visit a place like NYC or Hong Kong... ridic!) *gets off high horse* Back to the two most important parts...   The Service and the Food.   They were both wonderful; each time I've come here, we've been pleasantly greeted, well taken care of.. and the food comes out so quickly!  My drink never reached the bottom before it was refilled.  So service-wise, SW, you get an A+!   The owner also happened to be in while we were having lunch today as well and asked us how the calamari appetizer was that we got. He was as nice and enthusiastic as his servers, which was refreshing to see.   Now for the best part... the FOOD!  The food is amazing.  This time I had the Speck with pappardelle (my favorite kind of pasta)... the pasta was cooked perfectly, the Alfredo was just right and the portions are large.    Overall, if you come here, you'll have a great experience in both service and food. If you're not from the area, it may be a little bit off the beaten path, but make the trek; it's worth it.  The prices aren't cheap (but if you wanted cheap, you'd be having fast food and not reading this review, right?), but the food quality justifies it. Lunch for two, with two sodas and Calamari will push you past $50 easily.",

Well the flavors were not limited.  I had gnocchi with speck mushrooms Ina pink sauce. The pasta was homemade and spot on. The texture was the perfect blend of structure but soft to the chew. The speck had a great salty ham/bacon taste to bring the savory side of the dish out while the pink sauce was very rich with cream and a hint of sweet.  My wife had spaghetti and meat sauce. The sauce was plentiful and there was no shortage of meat in her dish. The pasta was also fresh and a perfect al dente.  We finished with two desserts. A cannoli and crostata.  Great overall experience. Just need some help with the space and organization.",

They good, sauce was good, but it still doesn't compare to Grandma's!   For lunch we had the lobster ravioli in pink vodka sauce. They were good. Next up, was gnocchi with pesto and Gorgonzola. It was good. I think the pesto coulda used a little more flavor. But was still good. Last up, the penne pink vodka prosciutto, garlic and sundried tomatoes. The flavor of that sauce was fantastic! I would highly recommend it! Last up Nutella cheesecake and semifreddo. Both delicious!! Our waitress had the Italian accent and told us that her dad makes the semifreddo himself!",

This was my first time at this restaurant and I'll never eat here again.   We waited 45 minutes to be seated for a group of 5 people they initially told us it'll be about 15 minutes. Not a big deal. We finally sat down and ordered. We ordered a bruschetta for our appetizer. We waited 30 minutes for the brushetta to come out. While we were waiting we saw people's food orders that were sat AFTER us coming out. NOT GOOD. They literally fed tables of 3 or less people first, before starting on our order. NOT GOOD. After waiting an hour and a half our food started trickling in. First the lasagna and two carbonaras. 10 minutes later the pesto pasta. I ordered a chicken marsala and it never came. IT NEVER CAME. Our waiter apologized and said he'll get that started immediately. The owner came and apologized and she explained to me that they recently expanded and she had to fire 7 workers. If you are that short staffed why stay open? I'm SOO disappointed.   My friends let my taste their food.  The lasagna was greasy. The carbonara was delicious  The pesto pasta was good.",

The server was very attentive, the food was to die for and the facilities were clean, romantic and perfect for a date night. The background music level was perfect, enough to drown out the conversations of other diners but low enough to carry on a conversation at your own table. I would recommend it for anyone. The prices were very reasonable and the portions were right sized. While the wine and drink list isn't overly large it's right sized for the establishment. It's kid friendly, family oriented yet also intimate enough for dates",

It was at best on par with Olive Garden which in my opinion is a fast food quality Italian restaurant. While the angel hair pasta and marinara in our Chicken Parmesana meal was pretty good, the chicken was nothing more than a baked pre-made frozen breaded chicken breast.  That theme continued with the cheese pizza which again was simply a pre-made crust that essentially tasted like a Celeste frozen pizza. Even the garlic bread was just a bland tasting piece of buttered roll with some parsley sprinkled on it.   The only thing that brings my review up a star was the fact that our food was ready within 20 minutes even though it was 6pm on a Saturday. The person taking my phone order and at the counter was both prompt and friendly. Based on the price for the quality of food received, we will not return.",

When we walked in, we were the only customers. I worry when I don't see any customers at a restaurant. I think is the food good? Why isn't anyone here?   The male server greeted us right away. We ordered garlic bread, meatball sub, porcini mushroom pappardelle, and a nutella cheesecake. Another party came in and slowly more people showed up. Also, noticed there were some take out orders.   We said we were sharing so they were nice to split both of our entrees for us. Everything was delicious, just like Italian home cooking. We didn't finish everything because Italian food can be heavy and the portions are big.  As we were leaving, the place was full and some people came in to pick up their orders. We came at the right time, a little before 6 p.m.  Also, found out they deliver in my area so glad to hear I can add another place to my delivery list for the days I'm feeling lazy and hungry.",

Add some pepper flakes and it's even better. The pasta was made al dente, just right.  Service is great, our server was very attentive and kept the drinks filled and very friendly.

When we walked thru the doors we were instantly greeted by the hostess (gave her star for that) and she seated us. We waited awhile for our waiter, once he came he asked if we wanted any drinks. We got our drinks and we ordered our food. After we ordered our food that was the last time we heard from him (besides giving us our check). We see him helping other tables except for ours. We got our food my gf got the Alfredo fettuccine and I got the chicken piccata (sauce was to watery). I think cpks is much better lol. Gf wanted Parmesan cheese tried to wave down our waiter but did not even look our way so I asked another waiter who's cleaning a table next to us. At first he came off kinda rude because when I asked him if I could have some Parmesan he said \"just a second\" without looking at me while cleaning the table. If I was the waiter I would've stop what I was doing and help a paying customer. He came with Parmesan but he got nicer after (gave him a star) and gave us boxes for our food. I think the only good thing about this experience is how good the bread was lol",

But.....since it was a long drive back to the restaurant, we forced ourselves to eat. The next day, I stopped by the restaurant to mention this to the manager.  His response: \"have a nice day\"......with customer service like this, I give this place six months.  Absolutely unbelievable.  p.s.

We both chose the side salad which included mixed greens, sun dried tomatoes, cherry tomatoes, and artichoke hearts with a house vinaigrette. We both gobbled it down! \"House bread\" came hot-from-the-oven served with herbed olive oil. For main courses, my husband ordered spaghetti and meatballs while I ordered fettuccine with vodka sauce and added chicken for $1.00 more. My husband said that he intended to eat just half and save the rest for another meal, but it was so good that he just couldn't stop! Mine was equally excellent. My mouth wanted to continue, but my tummy begged me to stop. Our server brought me an aluminum pan for leftovers. When she saw that I had grabbed the bread, also, and placed it on top, she brought me a sheet of foil to wrap it. We left very full and happy campers!",

We were told it was happy hour so I ordered a Wastach IPA on tap.  The server did not mention the price.  We ordered our meals and requested separate checks.  My wife and I ordered and split an Alex  salad which was good.   We asked if bread was served, assuming it was complimentary.  A small portion of garlic bread was served.  We enjoyed but felt the serving was small so we requested more.   I ordered a second IPA.  I ordered  the Cavatelli Rustica and liked it.  My wife had the Baked Mostaccoioli and thought it very dry.  Portions of each were more than ample.  One order for the other couple (butternut squash ravioli was returned.  By the time the replacement order was served, the rest of us had almost finished our meals.    When we got our checks, we were unpleasantly surprised.  Our total with tax came to $72.85.  The IPA's were $8.00 each.  I am not a beer expert but checked at the local store which sells Wasatch for $8.99 per six-pack.  I thought the $8.00  was excessive for a 12  oz. happy hour offering.  We were all not pleased when we learned the Fettunta or garlic bread was not complimentary and was priced at $3.95.  Not being pleased by the lack of information from our server we added a $10 tip and paid with our debit card.  Our biggest surprise came when we reviewed our  bank statement and found we had been charged an extra $72.85!   The charge to our account totaled $155.70.  This is not a place we will visit again.  Above charge is now being disputed!",

When I tried to put in my order they refused to take my order because something was wrong with the stove. I know for a fact they have other items on the menu that doesn't require a stove.  This was only my latest experience, but not only the first time they refused to take my order or completely got my order wrong with sub-par average food!   Very sad! Considering these guys seem to be authentic Italians, not to mention, I am half Italian, grew up in Italy and am disappointed this is the way they choose to represent our culture!

It was overcooked and there were 3 halved grape tomatoes and some finely chopped basil as garnish. My husband had chicken franchise and the sauce broke and his pasta was over cooked as well. Al dente! Pasta should never be mushy. Neither my husband or my daughter ate their desserts. My husband said the strawberry cheesecake was just nasty and my daughter took one bite of her cannoli. Service was super slow. And it took more than 15 minutes to get the change. Even as bad as it was, I always tip my server. It isn't an easy job. However the server should thank my husband he had small bills and left her a tip because I was completely annoyed. Our bill was $70.12 and I gave her $100. She asked if I wanted change! Really? She wasn't good. I drank my daughter's water because they didn't refill mine. I had planned to give her $15, but when she brought back the change, she gave me a $10 and a $20. Did she really think I would leave a $20? Or maybe she knew she wasn't great and I at least this way she would get $10. Either way, awful dining experience.",

There is a heaping amount of spaghetti and 2 huge slices of meatloaf with bread and an Italian bbq sauce. UNBELIVABLE. Great food great process and the best of all I have dinner to. If you haven't yet. Check it out. John",

It is a small restaurant in a strip mall, and it fills up fast with a very loyal patronage. FYI: the restaurant will soon expand and basically double in size. Cannot wait!",

    "text": "Experiences at this place are always inconsistent. Ordered the shrimp scampi and was so disgusted, I sent it back and ordered nothing else, while waiting for my family to finish their meals. Tried to mix the noodles in sauce, of which, there was very little, but the sauce was flavorless, like water with salt and lemon juice. Very bad. Wait staff said the chef/cook tasted and confirmed, \"yep, no flavor\" and that the guy who made it was new. Please spend the extra $ to hire a \"real\" Chef who knows Italian cooking and until then, don't try to pass this place off as a fine dining experience. The \"owner\", who sat at the bar the whole time we were there drinking wine, sent the waiter over to offer us a free dessert, never once coming to our table to acknowledge my complaint. I watched as one of the waiters spoke to him while looking at us, expecting him to come over and meet with us, but no, he just sat there keeping that seat warm. News flash, if you own the place and care about the quality of the food and service in your establishment, you should be on your feet checking the quality of the food coming out of the kitchen and engaging your customers to make sure their experience is good. ESPECIALLY, when you know the quality of it is poor. You chose to acknowledge us in the parking lot as we were leaving at the same time commenting, \"hope you had a good meal\"....No, we didn't...and you know that, WTF??? This is how you engage? What a joke! Have you ever owned a restaurant before or did you just see the $$$$ signs and figured you'd give it a shot? The gentleman who owned this place before, and took his life savings to do it, was a humble man and really cared about what was being served to his customers. Back then, the food was authentic and good. His livelihood depended on it!! No complaints about our waiter.",

Everything tasted suberperb and were plated well. Special shout out to our sever Alex who made our lunch great!",

    "text": "Ashamed to say we've been coming here since they opened and I am just now posting. They are obviously doing well since they have been able to go through a remodel and now an expansion, which thrills me. The food here is SOOO good I hope they are around forever.  Truth be told, I've almost always ordered only the spaghetti and meatballs as my main. The sauce is incredible, and I've never had a better meatball. Portions are huge so there's always enough for a second meal. We start with the Caprese salad (the version with oregano and capers) and could never think of skipping this addictive starter. We occasionally order to pick up and everything is packed so well. The hot stays hot, the cold stays cold. When we dine there, we always order a bottle of wine and enjoy the off the beaten path but reasonably priced selections. We are usually so stuffed by the time we leave that we get tiramisu to go because it can't be missed.  We love Spaghetty Western!",

Their house & caprese salads are both great!  They have a nice wine selection & gelato for dessert. I will dine there again & would recommend them for a casual dining experience if you appreciate fresh ingredients & authentic Italian cuisine.",

The hostess only wanted to seat us at the two seater that is right inside the door and up against another table. Awkward and uncomfortable anyone? We asked to sit at another table and she refused saying that they have upcoming reservations but only one table had a reserved sign on it. Since she refused to seat us we went next door to \"off the strip\" which was delicious. So thanks bitchy hostess girl. I hope those tables showed up.",

Second visit I ordered lasagna, salad, garlic bread take-out, called at 4:00, asked to pick it up at 6:00, had to put it in the oven for another 45 min, as it was ice-cold in the middle, scalding hot on the bottom. I called and they put me on hold forever, I gave up, hung up.  Will give it a 3rd try, probably just the pizza.",
