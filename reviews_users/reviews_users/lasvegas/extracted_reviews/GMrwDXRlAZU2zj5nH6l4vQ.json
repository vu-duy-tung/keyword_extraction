I do like the $1 option for extra noodle and I think $3 for extra meat. Prices are also a little higher than I've seen at other pho places, but it's certainly not overpriced or bad.  It's decent for the location since it's very close to the strip in an open strip mall and there is also a big wide area for seating. I didn't try the sandwiches though, but I was in a mood for noodles. Perhaps next time.",

    "text": "This place has bread, and yes, I mean the literal kind that comes in loaves. The bread is a magical combination of crusty, crunchy and soft all at the same time. How do they do that? Definitely magic. This element pretty much guarantees they are going to have a good banh mi, and that is exactly what they have.   I like it, but I do not absolutely love it. The bread is so delightful they should make it a foot long! Alas, the sandwiches are a little small. They offer a tofu option, which I appreciate, but their tofu filling is not especially flavorful. It tastes like tofu, not necessarily bad, but not miraculous. They could spice that bean curd up a bit.  As for the pho, I would describe it as good, not flavorless, but also not the best. Plus, they aren't able to serve up a vegetable filled pho, which as you may know is my standard for judging pho places.  Lastly, the service has always been haphazard when we have visited. The last time they were out of jalapenos. What? And, it was unclear if there was really a waiter in the dining area, as no one consistently checked in with us and it took a while for our food to come out. Plus, their menu pricing and what they charge doesn't seem to be the same. We have been confused by our bill on both occasions. Be sure to double check your bill if you go!   In conclusion, the bread is their secret sauce.",

    "text": "My favorite place to slurp on a bowl of hot Pho and inhale delicious tasty sandwiches is Pho Thanh Huong. Portions are generous. A regular size bowl is big enough for 2 depending on how hungry you are and it comes steamy hot right out of the kitchen doors,  with all the plant fixins to garnish your bath tub bowl of soup. What I like most about their soups is, they dont skimp out on the meat and they give you a variety of proteins to choose from. The grilled pork and chicken sandwiches are scrumptious, light and crunchy.  Every bite is full of delicious flavor. Very reasonable price for such a bangable sandwich. Spring rolls, and fried rolls are no doubt delectable. Eat with caution though, as you can easily fill up with these appetizers that your entree may feel neglected... you might need a to go box after 2 bites. Service is fast and friendly. Easy access, no high traffic customer wait time. Slight downfall is the area. Just be sure not to wear your Gucci jogging suit dripping in gold herring bones. Youll be sure to be jacked before you get to the door.",

The broth did have the umami type element that we all enjoy.  The condiments were fresh.  The service was suspect. Not because the employees don't speak english, but just bad service.  I walk in and it has a counter like a quick service restaurant so I stood at the counter for 5 minutes.  So I finally asked the woman working behind the counter - \"how can I get some food?\" then she pointed to the tables.  Someone finally took my order after I sat down.  I got the food fast which was good.  So I ate - I waited for ever to get a bill...  I finally walk up to the counter I said \" I would like to pay now.\"   She was very confused.  So the food was - good - the service was weird - I just don't know why people own restaurants with out any people skills!",

Pho Thanh Huong Restaurant is our 3rd Pho Restaurant attempt in Vegas and it's the best from all! First thing that greeted us was a very friendly smile and offer to choose any table we like. We already had a good feeling. We both went for King Size Pho bowl with all the meats inside (well, I went without tendons). We also ordered 4 spring rolls.  The bowl of Pho was HUGE!  Our greedy foodie hearts filled with joy at seeing such a size. However more importantly, it was also very tasty. The restaurant also had the small fresh red hot chilli peppers for us, which we like to add to provide some extra spiciness. It's always a plus when they have it and bring those out! Again, all the service was with a smile which is very important to us.  The restaurant has free WiFi hotspot as well.   We came back the next day for Grilled Pork + Shrimp + Eggroll vermicelli, and it was also very much to satisfaction. The menu didn't provide for a King Size version for the vermicelli, but we asked anyway... and they flexibly provided! They said we were the first to order it. We like flexible restaurants :)  5 stars! Would come back definitely.",

I can't get a decent bowl of Pho where I live so it's always a nice treat when I come to Vegas and get a taste of this place.  My most favorite thing about PTH is their sandwiches!!! The last time I went I got the grilled pork & the grilled chicken with pate.  Both were sooo GOOD!  I love the bread that they use.  Yes I like Lee's in the OC but their bread is too hard.  The bread is here light & fluffy, toasted & a great compliment to whichever meat you order.  I really liked their pickled carrots & daikon here, along with the slices of jalapeno inside.  Definitely a keeper in my book.  Plus each sandwich is $2.75!! Talk about dirt cheap.    I'm full every time I leave & my wallet doesn't yell at me.  Wish I could go here every week!! WAAAAAH!",

Its hard to go wrong with banh mi sandwiches, but I am not a fan of dry french bread that saws the palette of your mouth. Yikes.  Still, I gotta go with the old trusty grilled pork or chicken with pate.  I could do with a little more pickled shredded daikon with carrots, but it never seems to be enough.

    "text": "BEWARE OF THIS RIP OFF RESTAURANT! Our family of 3 people had dinner at this restaurant last Monday 11/19/18.    After ordering our food, we had to wait for almost 1 hour when they brought out a bowl of \"pho\" to my husband while my brother & myself were still waiting for our 2 sandwiches as our dinner.  Even when my husband finished eating his \"pho\" there was still no sign of our sandwiches even though we kept checking with the waitress.  Finally, they brought the \"banh mi thit\" to our table, but by then it was almost 9:30 p.m. (after 1 and 1/2 hours waiting for it) & too late for us to eat there so we had to take the food home.  When I went to the cashier to pay for our food, we were charged 3 sandwiches instead of the 2 that we've ordered.  If I didn't pay attention to the bill & catch their mistake, they would have cheated us the cost of the 3rd sandwich that we didn't ordered & they didn't bring to our table. Then on Saturday 11/24/18 we went back to this establishment with the family of my daughter including 2 small children of 8 & 5 years old.  The food was mediocre where they charged us $4.00 for 2 extra eggs for a rice dish.  My 8 year old granddaughter wanted a small bowl of just the beef stew broth (no meat) & a roll of bread.  When I went to pay at the cashier, I've discovered that they have charged us $13.95 for this small bowl of beef stew broth without any meat.  When I questioned her about this ridiculous charge, the cashier informed me that even though we did not want any meat, they would still charge us full price for this dish. This is an unbelievably rip off, terrible & unethical practice of doing business at this restaurant.  Had the waitress informed us in advance that they would charge us the full price when we ordered this dish for the kid, we would have never ordered it in the 1st place.  Who, in the right mind, would want to pay almost $14.00 for a lousy small bowl of just broth & bread.  Furthermore, their service was slow & unfriendly.  We would NEVER GO BACK to this restaurant again to be victimized the 3rd time.  You're better off going to other Vietnamese restaurants in town as there are plenty of them in Chinatown & elsewhere in Las Vegas.  Don't let them cheat & rob you!  Their lousy food is not worth it!",

Each time I went in they were slow, which is a big plus for me because food comes out faster that way. I always ordered their chicken pho and asked for white meat only. It's a mix with white and dark meat so if you're not a fan of either the two you could just let your server know, and they'll leave it off. Their bahn mi and egg rolls are super good and affordable! I think this is a very good and convenient pho spot besides traveling to China town. Average price for two pho's and a spring roll would be roughly around $26-$28 with tax.   Also, careful around the restaurant. There's a lot of solicitors there, they come in and talk to the customers and some of the servers ask them to leave but the others don't interfere as much. You'd have to shoo some people away while you're trying to eat LOL",

Several different bahn mi sandwiches plus many other tasty dishes. My favorite is the marinated pork bahn mi with extra meat and add extra basil, sprouts and fresh jalapenos. That's how I roll there! Speaking of rolls, grab an extra roll (they're good) to go with a steaming bowl of Pho and you'll be a happy person. Bon Appetit!",

But yet, the minute I walked in, I got a strong, disgusting wift of stale cigarette smoke. =/ I continue to smell that throughout my dinner. That nasty Dotty's dump next door must be the culprit.   I'll definitely say this: at $8.50 a bowl of Pho Tai, it was on the pricey side....especially since this place is not even located on the strip!!! Pho So 1 doesn't even charge that much!!! Pretty awesome pho though, I have to admit.  So my boyfriend and I each got a bowl of pho and he ordered the grilled pork banh mi which only cost $3.50. Awesome price for a very flavorful, charboiled pork sandwich. YUM!!!!! I can tell this would be perfect for UNLV students, since this restaurant is close by. The sandwich was delicious, decent sized and it was cheap.   We came for dinner on a cold, rainy Monday night. Plenty of seating available, we were serviced right away and the food arrived within 3 minutes. Restaurant was clean (to the naked eye that is...) and what I loved most were the individually-wrapped bamboo chopsticks. I like those because these were a one-time use only. (you know how some Asian restaurants can be when it comes to cleanliness.) Solid restaurant for pho and that dang delicious grilled pork banh mi if you're ever on this side of town.",

When our orders are taken, the waitress clearly writes everything down, but somehow we end up with the wrong dishes?

    "text": "Ok more like 3.5 stars.   I try to be as impartial as possible when trying a new place, but I'm not quite sure what's going on with this place. We arrived around 12:30pm and expected a lunch rush. The place was mostly empty, maybe 6 tables out of 17 had customers dining. With two other parties in front of us, we were told we had to put our names on a list and wait to be seated. It only took 5 minutes to be seated, but given that so many tables were empty, waiting at all seemed odd.   The hostess is very friendly and delivered menus and took our order quickly. We ordered pho and a bahn mi sandwich and were given the usual plate of condiments to go with it, but it was missing the Thai basil and cilantro. When we asked about it, the server said they recently started omitting these items from the plate and only served them if customers asked. So that is a little weird to me too.   My dining companion was served her soup several minutes before my sandwich came out, which is also when the iced coffee I had ordered at the start came out. Also weird.   But as for the food, the bahn mi sandwich rolls are HUGE. Like...American football sized. And they are GOOD! They were a little skimpy on the jalapenos, but I understand not everyone has a mouth made of asbestos like mine.   All in all worth it for the food, but the service is just a little weird, which is the only reason for the 3 stars.",

    "text": "I used to go to this place all the time as a student at UNLV and the former owners were RUDE and so I never went back until ~2 years later, which was a few nights ago.  To my delight I came to find out that there are NEW owners/management that are extremely pleasant and helpful.   I got pho there, which is actually really good. There is a combination bowl and it has tons of items in it: tripe, beef balls, brisket, flank, etc. And it's a flat rate at $8.50.  They said that if you don't like any one of those items, they remove it and add more of what you do like.  So I was definitely happy with that because I really don't like tripe.   It's hard to find places that are not in chinatown that have good pho. This place is one of them.   I also tried their grilled pork sandwich and it was delicious! The bread is made in-house and I was told that they make it fresh daily around 9-10AM. I love bread and I'm picky hhaha but it was really good with their grilled pork and veggies.   LEMME say, that I will admit that their grilled pork sandwich is WAY better than Lee's sandwiches! :) Yes, I said it. & Its True!   I'm a happy camper now that I can go back to this place whenever I'm on campus and know that the staff are super friendly and that they have really good food.",

What can I say about the place- it has no atmosphere and the service is quite lacking but she makes one hell of a banh cuon.  If you don't know what banh cuon is, its rice rolls filled with ground pork, a type of fungi and seasonings...each roll is hand rolled..why do I know this? My mom makes some of the best in San Francisco...so when I come here and am craving my mom's banh cuon, this is pretty darn close.  They come out warm and gooey on a plate with bean spouts, cha lua ( vietnamese sausage) and veggies....  That is what brings me back again and again...and their sandwiches are pretty darn good too...their Pho is a hit or miss and some days I feel like I'm back home at my parents house when the kitchen and wait staff are yelling at each other...but oh well- I come for the food, not the service!",

Delicious, friendly staff and the bread comes out warm (possibly due to heating in a conventional oven before the goodies are inserted) but still nonetheless satisfying. I prefer this style of banh mi versus the Lee's baguettes or any baguettes for that matter since they're much tougher and tend to shred the top of my mouth.

During the four years of attending UNLV, I would've been delighted to know there was such a yummy Vietnamese restaurant just across campus. There has been numerous times I craved pho or banh mi but did not have the 10-15 minutes to drive to Chinatown.  I had some bad experiences with previous pho restaurants regarding service, but this place is great. No need to wave down waiters to get a refill for my drink. Also the venue is clean and tidy.  I had the fried egg and Chinese sausage banh mi. The bread is toasted nearly perfect. It is crunchy yet crumbles away effortlessly, almost just melting away in your mouth. No need to chew and bite endlessly like with the bland toasted bread from Subway. Damn, did I just compare this place to Subway? Yeah right. Anyways, the fried egg and Chinese sausage was great, just a little too salty. I would definitely tell them to hold the salt next time. However, only $3.50 for this tasty sandwich? I can roll with that any day!  My girlfriend had the vegetarian pho and the broth looked and tasted spectacular. I really dislike how some pho are served drenched in oil. I hate seeing pockets of oil floating around in my broth, yuck! Thankfully, the broth was very clean and tasty. Maybe because it was vegetarian pho the broth was clearer than usual. I normally have beef or shrimp pho, so next time I will try that.  In conclusion, I really like the location of this venue and the banh mi. Definitely recommending this place, not only because location but for its surprisingly tasty dishes as well.",

    "text": "Sandwiches!!  Dude, this is my favorite banh mi place evoooooore! It's really inexpensive and the ingredients are super fresh.  The bread is freshly made, and they have a ton of selections. I really like the chinese egg and sausage banh mi and the charbroiled pork one. MMMM! The sandwiches are about $3-$4, so it's handy for broke college students like myself (also located across the street-ish from the Trop garage of UNLV). I've had pho from here too, and it was pretty decent, but I usually just go for banh mi.  The soup was just cause I was sick that day and had to study haha. Still tasty nonetheless.   Downsides: This place smells like smoke! gaaah, horrible.  I recommend taking your food to go, unless you like the taste/smell of carcinogens with your food.  Also, the service when you're seated is kinda slow.  I drink a ton of water and the refills didn't come quick enough after I loaded my sandwich with Sriracha.  Plus, they don't really have consistent waiters or whatever.  It's like everyone is doing everthing? I'm not sure. Personally, that's not really a big deal for me since I feel like most authentic Asian restaurants have that same kind of attitude, but sometimes people wanna be dined for real so be cautious 0.0   Overall, I'd definitely come back...and back...and back again.  It's tasty, low cost, and it's right by school, which is the biggest seller for me.  It's something different from Chipotle or whatever is around campus.",

So whenever I'm craving for good pho, this is my spot! Also, their Banh mi is yummmmy! Ugh, the baguettes are perfectly crispy and soft at the same time and their ingredients are fresh, plus the meats aren't dry. I've tried their bbq pork and their baked chicken and they were both great! What makes a great Vietnamese sandwich is their baguette and some places lack that, this spot doesn't! The only thing is that it's a bit pricey here, but you won't be disappointed, it's worth it :))",

It's in an unassuming strip mall off Trop and Maryland.  It's a nice clean restaurant! The first time, I got pho and a banh mi. Second time, I got the banh mi.  The bread is perfect. Crunchy, chewy, delicious all at the same time. Priced well at about $3.75 per sandwich.   You can be a fatboy like me and just get two sandwiches, but call it a day after that. It's still pool season.  One of my new favorite off-site lunch locations!",

I don't know what happened but when that place changed management and painted the restaurant it has the most horrible stench in there.  I can't tell if it's cigarette smoke, and at first I thought it was just lingering from a smoker but it's been months and the past 4 times I've been there, it smells horrible.  Unless you don't care about smell when you eat (which I'm pretty sure I'd rather smell roses than cigarettes when I eat) then eat here. But if you care, then find a new place and tell me about it.  I honestly had to wait outside while I waited for my sandwich.  Harsh? Yikes. Sorry. It's the truth  (I hope some worker there sees this and fixes this problem. Yes, I have mentioned it to them before but I don't know how helpful it was)",

Skimpy on the meat, skimpy on the veggies, tastes like cardboard because of not enough spread. Don't bother asking for extra it costs a dollar. For literally 2 cents of veggies. That is almost a 30% increase in price.  Still can't beat the 3.50 though but terribly disappointing slide in quality of food. Pho is alright. tastes like it's got msg in it, gives my wife and I a headache so we always go for the banh mi here. Usually good service. We used to come here 4-5x each month. Hopefully management reviews this page and implements some quality control. Check out the unappetizing photos. Really hope they taste better soon.  - edit : have since returned, bang mi quality control has improved somewhat and they still have fairly quick service. Good to grab as a to go item and sometimes I get one before hopping on a plane. Otherwise the pho is fairly decent.",

We would order hot tea or a boba and we needed to remind them about it eventually we would get our drinks but by the time we were finished with our food.

I got the fresh spring rolls and the combo vermicelli bowl with BBQ pork and egg rolls.   I'm still dissapointed in the spring rolls. The ingredients are fresh but the pork itself is super dry and flavorless. I do like their peanut sauce, but I wish it was a little thicker as it's hard to use as a dipping sauce.   I did like the vermicelli bowl, I am not a fan of shrimp, but I loved these ones as they seemed grilled and marinated. The pork was tender and had a delicious marinade, and the vermicelli freshly made.   I however did not like the egg rolls. The texture on the inside was mushy and flavorless, and I wish in my vermicelli bowl that the fresh veggies were not under the warm vermicelli.   But still their Bahn MI's are delicious",

    "text": "Coming in, I was a little confused. I didn't know if it was seat yourself or get seated by the server/hostess. No one greeted me to sit down so I just sat myself. Service was ok, food came out extremely fast, but it was pretty good food. I ordered pho with meatballs & tendon and a Thai tea with boba. Not even 5 minutes after I ordered the pho it already came out. I don't know if they just keep a pot of broth out boiling all day or what. The meat ratio to noodles and soup was extremely off. I had probably about 5 pieces of meatballs and 3 pieces of tendon; the size of the bowl was decent so I expected a little bit more meat. The Thai tea was good, though. Tastes just like any other good Thai tea, but the boba was a little hard.  If you're in a rush & need a quick meal to get in, this is the place to go.   The meal was about 13$ not too bad of a price.",

    "text": "I am the biggest foodie when it comes to anything Asian cuisine due to growing up with Japanese/american style dishes. With this being said, I'm a frequent visitor of Chinatown. However, China town is about a twenty minute drive and i'm a broke college student so i needed something a bit cheaper, delicious and more convenient. Besides Hue Thai which is literally my favorite place in Vegas, this place is in my top 5.   Whenever, i go into the shop, I'm greeted by all of the staff and depending on if i'm eating in or taking it to go, they are very quick and attentive. I've tried both the charbroiled pork and grilled beef banh mi and they are completely packed with flavor. The cooks here really do it well. They pack the sandwich with the right balance of spicy and sweet from their mayo sauce, daikon , and carrot to their smoky meats and jalapenos.  Depending on what you get, most of the sandwiches are around 3.75+tax with the exception of beef at $8...  Also, if you're looking for bubble tea, please don't get it here! The boba itself is bitter and way too chewy but the tea is excellent. I'd recommend any of the teas without boba.  The place is clean, convenient, and quiet. Also for my fellow poor UNLV students, they offer discounts and are super close to campus. In fact, they are right on Tropicana and Maryland next to Vons in the mini strip mall!",

    "text": "This is a sandwich review. The rest of the menu looks a little too pricey anyway.  This summer, Las Vegas Weekly named the banh mi thit cha as one of the top 10 sandwiches in Vegas. They are dead wrong. The banh mi thit nuong is way better.  Both banh mi thit (please spell it correctly) are $3.25 and both come in a small baguette with pickled carrots and daikon, hot peppers (note from tongue to self: make sure they remove this next time!), and a bunch of some kinda butter or margarine flavor enhancer. The difference is that thit nuong is grilled pork. It has sweetness and all the pork flavor you would expect. The ham, steamed pork, and pate in the banh mi thit cha is all too mild in flavor. Top 10 in Vegas? It might only be top 10 on the restaurant's menu because there's only 10 sandwiches.  Get the banh mi thit nuong. It's not as good as banh mi thit I've had in San Jose, but it'll do for Vegas. Or you might try the banh mi trung chien lap xuong, which I've gotta have next time. Fried eggs with (sweet) chinese sausage? Count me in.",

    "text": "WOW!  Phenomenal service.  Flavor packed Pho.  Exceptionally clean restaurant.  Decided to give this place a try on a Sunday night since it's just around the corner from me and didn't feel like making the journey all the way to Chinatown.  All I can say is WOW!  Went in there with no expectations and walked away beyond happy.  I moved to Vegas about 4 months ago from San Diego where the Pho shops are plentiful and have tried many in the area since arriving.  Thanh Huong will now be my go to for my pho fix.  The servers were SO nice and prompt with everything.  The pho was not heavy nor was it very bland, it was PERFECT!  You also get the option to build you own pho starting with just the beef broth and the noodles, which is great because you only get what you want in it.  To add to it all, unlike some other pho restaurants in the area this one is CLEAN AND... wait for it... they DO NOT bus an entire table on to a dish-washing cart right in front of you as you are eating.  HALLELUJAH!   This place gets 5/5 because I have eaten at MANY pho restaurants throughout the southwest over the the years and I can honestly say this one is one of my top choices.",

Their broth was perfect. Meat and noodle ratio was spot on. Although I could barely put a dent in my bowl, I savored each and every bite.   My gfs got the vermicelli and a banh mi and they were all fans. The shrimp in the vermicelli were huge! I couldn't believe it. Despite everything being big in portions, when we ordered an iced coffee my cup was filled completely with ice. There was probably 2 big gulps in there. What a rip! Luckily it was tasty and the hot Vegas weather melted my ice rather quickly so I got a little more out of it.   Only complaint is that service is a  little slow. But a okay, I know how to behave in an Asian restaurant. It's about hailing them down for yourself!",

This morning my family was missing rice so they wanted to go to a Vietnamese place that was actually great.  Pho THanh Huong did not disappoint.    We went in around 12 o clock, it was fairly busy but we were seated instantly.  The place was nice and clean, the server was really nice.  He also spoke Vietnamese with my parents which is a huge plus.  We ordered 3 broken rice plates with the grilled pork, the bi, and the pork loaf.  Then we also ordered a plate of the shaken beef, and the grilled pork.  We finished the order with 2 glasses of orange  juice and three glasses of iced coffee.  The food and dirnks came out about the same time, and it took about twenty minutes.  our server kept coming back and apologizing to us for the wait.  We were perfectly fine, he was very attentive and overall just awesome.  Major props.  When the food arrived everything was nice and hot.  The pork was sweet and juicy.  The fish sauce that the rice came with was on point, the bi and pork loaf was really well done, and the veggies it came with was crisp and tasty.    In the end, my family really enjoyed the experience of Pho Thanh Huong.  The plates were large and delicious.  This is definitely my go to spot.  Well done to them and keep being awesome!",

There was hardly anyone there so it should've been ready. If anyone know pho, all they need to do is put the broth in the container and the noodles and meat on the side. It shouldn't take that long. However, the broth was tasty. Wasn't bad or wasn't a wow factor either. Next time, I'd probably eat in but there are plenty of other pho places around the area that I'd try first.",

    "text": "I decided to introduce my mom to Pho.  She'd never heard of it and had no idea what she was getting into.  She loves Asian food in general, so I thought we'd give it a try.  I was actually going to go to the Thai place next door, but spied the Pho Thanh Huong and decided to change gears last minute.  The food was wonderful.  I cannot complain about the huge portions or amazing flavors.  The broth in the Pho was some of the best I've had.  The prices were also fantastic.  My one complaint, and the reason for four stars instead of five is the service.  Even though it was 1pm and there were quite a few tables, there was only one server.  He forgot that we'd ordered spring rolls and took forever in bringing our check.  Once the other tables had cleared out, I still had to hunt him down.  Minor in the grand scheme of things.",

    "text": "I was searching for PHO on this hot day lol and based on the reviews so I decided to give it a try. The restaurant is very clean and tidy. I ordered the spring rolls and a bowl of rare steak pho. My order took a while, at least the pho did. The rolls came out within 5-10 minutes. I was half way through and I heard the microwave being used and I thought why? Lol so probably 5 minutes later my big bowl of soup was served. The steak was a bright red which appears to be fresh, good sign. I add all the side items to it and taste the broth and the flavor was ok, not bad. However it lacked a lot of seasoning. Being that I've lived by naval military bases which are located in a heavily populated Asian community I consider my opinion or rather my palette on the experienced side when it comes to PHO lol just saying lol So anyways, I was disappointed that my broth wasn't like fresher since it cooled down pretty quickly and that took away from the dining experiences with pho. Your mouth experiences heat, flavorful broth, seasoning like Anise, etc and some decent tasting beef. I unfortunately didn't experience that today. It was OK but not the best I've had in a while. Server was accommodating",

Since then, we have been back a few more times, even had a sit down and ordered the pho, of course I choose by looking at the pictures and the eye appeal helps me make up my mind, but only once did they suggest that it might be too spicy for me, but once it came out, I loved it!  The crispy bread, the thin strips of meat (pork in my case) and the cilantro and jalapenos make the sandwich!   This a quick in and out with pork sandwich good flavors, but this time our spring rolls were bland without taste, if it weren't for the peanut sauce, it would have been an absolute bland roll.",

I had walked in literally a minute before closing, so they were not the most friendly. However, they still had a restaurant full and if they didn't want anyone to come in, they should have locked the doors. (which they did after I walked in)  I ordered special combo Pho with extra tendon to go along with a grilled pork banh mi. The wait was short and easy. I paid for my food and was on my way home.  Me and my hunny shared the banh mi, which was half ass put together. I had a piece of cucumber which was literally 1/3 of a cucumber that was just thrown on there. And not to mention almost a whole jalapeno that was just on one side of the sandwich. Talk about lazy and no attention to detail.   So after we finish the banh mi, I pour my broth in a pot to warm it up and get it steaming hot so my meat can warm up too. When I go to open the container up, the first thing I look at is my tendon and considering I paid almost $2.00 for extra tendon, I felt ripped off. My rare meat, not even cooked had a light brown tinge to it, which means it was not fresh.   And then to make things worse, two little flies or gnats or whatever they were flew out of the bay leaf and bean sprout pile and completely ruined my appetite.  In utter disgust, I threw it all away and almost felt the need to vomit.  I used to like this place. But now, you will never ever catch me here, no matter how bad I got a craving for Pho or  banh mi.",

When the pho came out, one was incorrect so they let us keep it. We waited 30 minutes for his vegetable pho  and my sandwich which never came out. Once his pho finally came out, there was a huge strand of hair in it. We spoke with the manager Kathy and what she offered us 20% off ($5) our meal. The waiters obviously felt bad and held their head down. The waitress offered something for free to go but Kathy butted in and said no they don't have time. Oh we don't? Okay.  So to conclude, I never got my sandwich, 30 minutes to make vegetable pho, and hair in said pho. Garbage. Save yourself a trip, don't go here.",

They make fresh baguettes there daily, so the bahn mi sandwiches get extra yum points for freshness.   What I like most about this restaurant is that they give plenty of fresh side fixings to go with the pho or noodle soups. Either for take out or dine in, they give lots of bean sprouts, Thai basil leaves, sliced jalepenos, and sliced lime. However, if you do want more chili sauce or hoisin sauce to go, just ask for it. Otherwise, you get one small container of each. The bun bo hue was decent. Not too spicy and had a decent amount of meat. The regular size pho was enough to split for two or one really hungry person. They do offer the King size pho for about 3 dollars more and that can feed 2 hungry people. Don't forget to order their Vietnamese iced coffee to keep the food coma at bay after eating!",

I do not know why bother to come back here, twice with disappointments. services were lacking. so one day I ordered meals to go for pick up. ordered over the phone, my husband went there to pay and pick up the foods. the lady at the casher/front was mind spaced or something cause she was rude. my husband is the nicest and calmest person I ever know and he told me about the experience. she was not listening to what he was saying, both in English and Vietnamese! she does not acknowledge that he was trying to tell her to double check if the rice noodles were cooked. no greetings and no smiling from her. anyways, my pho was ok, since it is a to go, I have to reheat the broth. his pho dac biet meat portions was very little for a lot of rice noodles. I'll go farther to get my pho cravings somewhere else.",

I ordered 2 Grilled pork subs. When i saw them being handed to me, I smiled. They were bigger, Looked more fresh, and after tasting it, it tasted a whole bunch better than my previous experience.   All i can say is that as of now, This place has the best vietnamese sandwiches i've tasted. And for less than 4 dollars it's a great deal.  Service could be a little better. The People working there look like students attending UNLV. It doesn't matter the age, but I just think service was just meh. Definitely come check it out.",

The article did, and I decided to try one of their sandwiches.  I ordered the grilled pork bahn mi and my wife ordered the grilled chicken bahn mi. They came served on nice, crusty bread. The fillings were flavorful. The price was great (just over $3 each). While the portion was not huge it was sufficient for a lunch.

I haven't eaten a lot of bahn mi since moving to Vegas, and I really like them so I was excited to give this place a try.  Since I've been making pho at home for every meal I eat in, I wasn't about to order their pho.  THAT would just be pho-king extreme.  I ordered the spring rolls and #57, which I think was steamed pork and pate.  Can I just say, YUMMY IN MY TUMMY!!!  The spring rolls could've used a little more meat and shrimp, but it was still really good.  It wasn't dry and rubbery like some spring rolls tend to be when it's not fresh.  My sandwich was so delicious. The bread is impossibly crispy and soft at the same time, and the fillings were ample.  I loved the subtle sweetness in the mayo that they use here as well.  If I am craving bahn mi, I will definitely stop here. For a mere 3 bucks a pop, sign me up!  One negative is that the server never came back to refill my water even though it was sitting on the edge of the table empty for nearly the entire meal.  Just don't expect too much out of the service here, but again, 3 bucks a pop!",

    "text": "I TRIED - Pho Dac Biet (3/10) - Grilled Pork Bahn Mi (8/10) - Fresh Spring Rolls (5/10)  I don't know why Yelp STILL doesn't give you the option of filtering by \"most reviews\" on smart phones, because honestly, that's the best way to find a place in an unknown city. Because of that, apparently, I found not the \"most popular\" Pho place in Vegas, but just \"A\" pho place in Vegas. I'm so annoyed, because my friend just got done telling me that he knew of a great pho place, and here's me Yelping while driving and ending up at what Yelp probably thought was the \"most convenient\" pho place. Grrr!  PHO I think, because I thought this must have been the place my friend was raving about, I had much higher expectations than I should have for it. The pho was just barely warm enough to be acceptable. The broth wasn't really that great either. If just barely had this taste of being...old, or not fresh. It wasn't spoiled or anything that bad, but it just didn't taste very fresh. The broth did its job, but didn't have that tiny bit of sweetness that I've had in better broths. The tripe specifically was very....tripe-y. I like tripe, but it sort of teeters on a line where if you cross it, it starts to taste bad, and it was just starting to go that way. Honestly, I would look for a different place for pho.  SPRING ROLLS Pretty decent, but nothing spectacular. No flavors really came out of the spring roll it self. The sauce was peanutty and sweet, and essentially, the spring rolls were just textured canvases for the sauce. Texture was good, the \"skin\" wasn't too thick. About average. You could do better, but it gets the job done.  GRILLED PORK BAHN MI Poor Bahn Mi. I like it, but I always get pho when I go to a Vietnamese place, so I'm too full. Luckily, I had a friend here to split one. The bread was very crusty, which sounds bad, but is actually really good. The crust was crunchy, but not hard. The pork had a real nice smoky sweet flavor and the veggies made it taste fresh. This is only the 2nd time I've had Bahn Mi, and so far, it tasted pretty close to my first one, so I'm not sure how to distinguish these yet. It was very tasty though!  NOT PHO ME Granted, the bahn mi was excellent, but so far, for me at least, bahn mi is always excellent. The pho, though, was a real downer. It just didn't really taste fresh, so it was one of the worse ones I've had. Considering that there is an area with a lot of pho places further west, I'd say skip this one, even though it is one of the closest to The Strip (I think)!",

    "text": "Met a friend at Pho Thanh Huong who loves this place & is his go to place to grab a quick bite during his lunch break from work. I can see why. Clean, friendly service, good food. We ordered the egg rolls and the beef pho.   The egg rolls were well made. They were crispy, had a good ratio of pork & veggie stuffing to-wrapper, and not too greasy or soggy at all.   The pho was delicious and one of the  best I have tasted in Las Vegas so far. The broth was not too salty & had good flavor. The ratio amount of sliced beef, spring onions, and noodles was justifiable. The garnish toppings of Thai basil and bean stouts was fresh. I have had pho from other places were there was hardly any sliced beef, overloaded with noodles, and the broth was either too salty, flavorless or the garnish toppings were not crisp n fresh.  I will return to Pho Thanh Huong as I am a fan of banh mi (Vietnamese sandwiches) and I want to try those on my next visit. They looked delicious.   I finally went back to Pho Thit Huong and tried the Banh Mi Nuong sandwich and it was better than I expected. Tasted way better than other Banh Mi sandwiches I've had in China town on Spring Mountain. The bread was crisp on the outside and soft on the inside. The pork meat was nicely seasoned and the pickled veggies were fresh and tangy! A nice size sandwich portion with plenty of meat for only $3.50!!! I elevate my 4 star rating to a 5 star rating! This will now be my go to place for Vietnamese cuisine!! Yum!",

    "text": "Came in this past Saturday evening with a friend who happens to work at the 2HIGUYS vape shop a couple doors down (plug-in). Lol. Anyway, we weren't greeted immediately and being my first time...Wasn't sure if we had to seat ourselves or they seat us. Apparently, you seat yourselves.   Once we assessed which table we were going to rest our elbows on because gosh knows when there are madd tables (I typed, madd. Dang...do people still use the term?) open...the first world problems kick in.  The restaurant is pretty spacious--clean too. Staff were friendly and pretty prompt.  Onward...Never been but knew I wanted a banh mi. So I opted for their grilled pork banh mi sans the jalapenos por favor. I even said please! My sandwich caMe with jalapenos. No biggie, nothing my fingers can't pick out. Bread was toasted wonderfully, meat was full of flavor, and it certainly filled the inside of that baguette wonderfully. I was bummed though because I swear I only seen cucumbers in there. If there were the usual pickled veggies...they were scarce. Scarce like there was a radish and carrot drought. Scarce like Bugs Bunny cultivated the crap out of them carrot fields. Scarce like somebody plucked all the carrots in the world to make some juice because homeboy was trying to improve his eyesight. And then the radish fields....uhh..ummm...must've been a bad crop month or something. Lol.  I'm not a pho person so didn't have that. Overall, it wasn't all that bad. I'm still a kinh do banh mi lover. Felt the prices were typical of other vietnamese locations.   I say...if you are in the vicinity, want a different view from your usual, don't have a preferred vietnamese spot, and this is the fare you are craving...well go get 'um tiger. If you are a UNLV student, perfect! If not, Chinatown is about 10mins away if you can hold your stomach in. Despite the disappointment in veggie ratio...the meat made up for it so it certainly hit the spot.   Ample parking, definitely stroller and kid friendly, and based on my friend's opinion...he lerrrves their tofu spring roll. So for you vegeterians or tofu lovers, just may wanna try that out.  Enjoy!",

The bread is crunchy/flakey on the outside and soft/chewy on the inside. And they are very generous with the pickled veggies and various meats too.   Best of all, they are cheap, only $3.25+tax for any banh mi sandwich and they are located across the street from UNLV. I recommend the classic grilled pork banh mi.",

I came by myself on a Friday after trying to decide what I wanted to eat in the UNLV area and ultimately ended trying to figure out where to go and just said eff it. I love pho why not ?!   They greet you upon entering and tell You to seat yourself then bring water and menus immediately. Thanks for the fast service !   I went for rare steak pho and a Bahn mi with charbroiled pork.     The pho was piping hot and flavorful. Initially after tasting I told myself the broth was missing something. Maybe it could be a little more flavorful. Then it hit me duh it's missing lime ! After that it was A Ok ! Not my favorite broth I've tried but the fact that they gave a huge amount of noodles and meat made up for it. They definitely are not stingy with Portion at $8.50 a bowl. The Bahn mi came out with the pho. Crusty baguette bread loaded with meat and vegetable. I did enjoy the Bahn mi but I'd have to say I would have enjoyed more vegetables on it.   After eating that delicious pho I only took a few bites of the Bahn mi and took it to go and enjoyed it later. Still good it's just better to eat it fresh when the bread it's till warm and toasty.   Definitely worth trying. Next time I'll try a bubble drink ;) and have my pho fix !",

They are located across from UNLV and there was a ton of parking in their lot.  I thoroughly enjoyed their pho and really liked the consistency of the noodles which were chewier than what I'm used to.  The portion was very generous and there was also a lot of meat in the pho which many other establishments skimp on.  My fiance had their egg and sausage banh mi and loved it.  He said their bread was just like the ones he's had in Vietnam.  We also had their iced coffee which was excellent also.  I highly recommend this place for reasonably priced Vietnamese food that is fresh and tasty.",

I was craving a Vietnamese sandwich while vacationing in Vegas (can't help it, I love them) and my family came across this lovely restaurant. They have a huge selection of sandwiches and other dishes. Of course I ordered the Steamed Pork sandwich; it was the BEST Vietnamese sandwich I've ever had, no joke (I had the sandwich twice during my week stay). They filled it with plenty of meat and vegetables and they even bake their own bread! It had a lot of taste and their pate (some sort of meat spread, pronounced \"pat-tay\") wasn't bland. My family also enjoyed their meals; my sister loved her grilled pork with rice because it had delicious flavor.  The restaurant itself was pretty big, but I think a lot of people order to go as I kept seeing people walk in and out with goodies. I wish they had a sister store in California. Why when I finally find a place I like does it have to be so far? I guess that gives me another reason to go to Vegas! I will definitely return here again!",

I don't know if it's because one of the owners reminds me of my mom or not, but the place is a good mom and pop shop unlike the ones on Spring Mountain Road with their fancy ambiance. I come here for items other than pho. Their bun rieu oc and bun bo hue is very good! Sadly, I haven't tried their sandwiches yet, but i will soon. Prices are also reasonable. Their usual diners are students from UNLV since it is located in University Village.  Service is great and your food comes out in a flash like most Vietnamese places. One of my favorite things about dining at Vietnamese restaurants is their \"pay at the counter\" policy. No need to wait around for the server to pick up your tab or split the bill 10 ways.",

    "text": "I discovered Pho about 4 years ago, and from that moment forward I knew that it would be one of those dishes that you wake in the middle of the night craving.   The pho here is fairly basic, and although it gets the job done, it doesn't really stand up to most others I've had. The broth is a little light, and I often have trouble getting everything in it that I want due to the fact that the servers and counter workers don't really understand what I want if it's not already on the menu. They pretty much rely on me pointing to a picture or a number, but if you want something extra or a substitution forget about it unless you speak vietnamese.  The menu is also basic, and there are not many soup options other than pho, which is fine because the real star here are the banh mi sandwiches, which they do exceptionally well, with a great toasted bread and they are one of the few places I have found that have the option of the shredded pork skin sandwich. Plus you can't beat the price...I get this as my to go school lunch many days to take to campus. Pork skin banh mi and a can of coke is $4.25.  I don't think this place would survive very long on Spring Mountain, but tucked away in the Vonn's shopping center, and in proximity to UNLV this place will continue to be my go to spot for a great cheap sack lunch, but I would probably make the trip to Chinatown if I wanted Pho.",

The plaza it's in has some wanderers but the parking lot and stores are spread out enough you can avoid them. Outside looked kind of dead, not much curb appeal, but once inside it was nice and clean. It was 6:30 p.m., Friday night, and there were only two other tables being served. Note that you seat yourself, order/eat, then get up to pay at the register. Ordered our food (four combo pho, one fried rice), came to the table within 10-15 minutes, and we all left full. Reasonable pricing! If I weren't in a pho mood, I definitely would've tried the $3.25 banh mi. It's going to take a couple more trips to each, but I'm definitely in favor of Pho Thanh Huong than Mr. Sandwich.",

It's a quick drive through the airport tunnel from work and their Banh Mi is super cheap at only $3 per sandwich including tax (a couple of them cost slightly more). I went with the #1 Pork. At first, I was underwhelmed by how much was inside the bread. Then I realized that it's on par with other Vietnamese places; it's just that their bread is so huge. I'm actually impressed with the bread. At the ends where there is basically no filling, it's still delicious because the bread is so good. As for the filling, it was very tasty. They don't have a \"Combination\" Banh Mi option like other places, which is what I usually get, so it's hard to compare directly. However, the #1 Pork has actual chopped up chunks of pork with great flavor. Overall, a very satisfying sandwich for $3.",

I dropped a friend off at the airport and grabbed dinner here before hand. Food comes out quickly, service is fast, and it's only a 5 min drive to the terminals.   My friend got the pho dac biet and I got a banh mi with Vietnamese deli meats. The pho broth was flavorful. I feel like this is not one of those msg free establishments though. The meat portion was generous and the noodles were slightly aldente.   My sandwich was good. The baguette was nice and soft on the inside and crunchy on the outside. They were generous with the pate which is my favorite part. There was a good meat to veggie balance.",

Thank you!  One word: #68 Bahn Mi sandwiches are not hard to find in Vegas. But beef wrapped onion certainly is! I didn't discover until I moved to CA, and so far this is the only place  in Vegas that I have found has it. It is the juiciest, most flavorful and tender morsels of marinated flank steak rolled up with perfectly cooked onion slices inside. Honestly, I could just pull the wraps out and eat the veggie sandwich separately. And the price? A mere $5.00! Best value in town.   I have been lunching here for years- on the usual suspects- pho tai, fresh spring rolls and such. Menu is large, service is great, ambiance is casual and clean. Plenty of small tables that easily fit together for your large gatherings. Now I will be back much more often for my new favorite which may become yours! Long live bo hahn huong! Beef wrapped onion, that is. :)  You can thank me later. Cheers!",

Everything we ask for from water to lemon to my order was done by me reminding them . The Atmosphere: All together the whole place did feel off putting. Something about the place was not comfortable. If you are looking to eat Pho to go, and take home this is it. If you are looking to sit down for the experience, not so much. This is Vegas there is hundreds other restaurants ready to give there best. Give it a try, You may enjoy et. I for sure didn't.",

Thankfully I was right as usual.   We ordered a feast. I mean, how can you not? Everything looks so good. Did I mention it's so cheap too? I started with the Tra Thai Tran Chau (Thai Tea with boba) which was wonderful and a flavorful tea with lots of chewy boba. For lunch I started with the Banh Mi Thit Cha, which hit the spot. A traditional bahn mi sandwich with wonderfully fresh french bread, yummy pork, head cheese, and spicy jalapeno. For just $4.50 it was quite the bargain. I followed up with a huge bowl of Pho...and oh was it tasty. The beef was sliced super thin and cooked for just an instant in the hot rich broth, it just melted in my mouth. Of course not the most amazing pho I have ever had, but it hit the spot nonetheless.   I have now added Pho Thanh Huong to my short list of on-the-way-to-LAS must hit lunch spots.",

What a time to be alive. These bahn mi's were just ok. The biggest issue was the bread which wasn't the freshest and was disproportionately larger compared to the amount of meat which was actually just the right amount. In contrast, the veggies were skimped on and much less than what I'm used to especially in comparison to the amount of meat and bread. One saving grace was the homemade chili oil sauce which was hot even by \"hot head\" standards. Would be willing to try this place again just for that oil (shout out to Mikey Chen).

I've tried a handful pho places whenever I'm in Vegas, but I have to say this is by far one of my favorite places to eat at. I like how they allow you to build your own pho, in which you could choose whatever toppings you like. For my pho I just kept it simple so I chose rare steak and meat balls. The portion is pretty big, I couldn't even finish my bowl of pho, but for the price of 10 dollars, it's pretty much equivalent to 2 pho bowls in OC. I also ordered a side of eggrolls to go with my pho. The size is quite small nothing too special about them, just typical eggrolls and fish sauce. I've had bigger ones back home in California. They also sell banh mi too! Unfortunately I was too full to try them, I should have bought some for the road. I will most definitely stop by next time for the sandwiches!",

That area may be a bit creepy to some at night, so if you are creeped out easily, try it during the day for lunch. My friend who took me there told me it was 'French Vietnamese', and thus the presence of their own bread for their sandwiches.",

I got spring rolls, a brisket pho, and a Bahn MI sandwich. I would give the sandwich 5 stars alone. Best one I've ever had. The pho was EXTREMELY salty. So salty, after a while, my mouth hurt. The flavor was okay and the meat was good but the salt content was insane. The spring rolls were pretty standard. Tasty. The peanut sauce though literally just tasted like peanut butter out of a jar. The pho didn't have as much sides as usual, either. (Green onion, bean sprous,regular onion, cilantro, ect.) The bean spouts were actually completely omitted.   I dunno. This place is good. I'll be back for a sandwich again for sure. Maybe I'll try another soup. Could be an off night.",

Anyway, I think their phos good.. The chicken is never over cooked to make it super chewy, the tofu is just enough firmness. The portion size is huge! I never really finish my bowl, but I would take it to go so I have left overs for later. The size of the bowl is great for the price! I think the chicken pho is $8? But for a huge bowl and you can take left overs home... That's a steal!  The customer services is great too! There's this particular waiter, his names Elmer & he's so friendly and attentive. He never lets my drink run low & frequently checks up on our table to see how we're doing. Keep up the good pho and customer service!",

    "text": "I moved here from Hawaii and there I enjoyed some of the best Pho outside of Vietnam. Here the broth had a wonderful aroma and the Pho 'rare steak' was great.  The rare steak is served inside the broth; that seems to be the norm here in Las Vegas as I have tried many of the Pho restaurants.  In Hawaii one is given the choice of \"meat outside or inside\" meaning that the rare steak can be served outside of the broth on a small plate and then placed into the the broth by the guest. One small thing I took issue with is with the Ca Phe Vietnamese service.  The menu states \"hot or cold\". Hot is priced at $3.00 and cold is priced at $3.50.  I was charged $3.50 for hot Ca Phe and then also charged another $.50 cents for it being hot.  Next time no Ca Phe Vietnamese for me, just water. Another thing with the coffee is that it is served in a 'to-go' cup and already mixed.  Pre made (made in the back of house) Ca Phe again seems to be the norm here in Las Vegas.  I am used to receiving the coffee table side with the coffee and hot water in a Single Cup Coffee Filter served on top of a coffee cup that has the 'Condensed Milk' in the bottom and the coffee then drips slowly into the cup while one is enjoying their Pho.  Once the coffee is finished dripping that one has the option of stirring and enjoying hot or stirring and then pouring over the accompanying \"glass\" of ice.  With the above said; I still will be going back for the delicious Pho just sans the coffee.",

    "text": "Located within a dumpy strip mall across from UNLV, I find myself coming here all the time, and picking up 5 banh mi sandwiches for carryout for $15 total.  The sandwiches are great - I put them in the over to toast up the bread a little and it's absolutely delicious.  It's one of my regular places as a Las Vegas local.    I have had banh mi in many places, including California and Virginia, which have vibrant Vietnamese communities.  Oddly, the best one out of all of them thus far is here in Vegas.  The bread is fresh and had a nice chewiness to it; the grilled pork sandwiches have pork that don't have too much gristle, and the sandwiches use good vegetables.  The other inferior places I've been to have meager portions of meat, or cost $3.50 and upwards per sandwich, or had bread that I wasn't particularly fond of.    I did have pho there once, and was disappointed by it; I go to Pho Saigon 8 up on Spring Mountain for my pho needs, but will often come here after a meal there for sandwiches to eat during the course of the week.  I put in my order, and go to the Vons in the same strip mall to finish up some shopping (it's an incredibly ghetto Vons).    The decor is pretty lousy, though they have a flat screen tv up.  The service is spotty though I've been there enough times that they recognize me; they're not rude, but they aren't necessarily on top of everything.  Cleanliness is average.  The banh mi is prepared in the open area in direct view of anyone, which I like since it can help keep a kitchen honest.  Value is solid because of the high quality of banh mi and reasonable prices.  As said by others, you'll be best off if you stick with the sandwiches.  Also, avoid the place during UNLV basketball games, cheapskates come out here to park rather than parking at the arena and it makes the entire lot a zoo.",

I was skeptical at first, but after the first bite, I wish this restaurant would replace several around the dallas area.  Grilled pork chops with rice and a fried egg, Beef ribs with rice, and a large bowl of Pho. Everything ordered was very tasty and I would order again without hesitation. Also tried a grilled pork and pate sandwich of also great tasting. I even drank the broth soup till it was all gone. Another place I am hitting again when I am back in Vegas. Thank you Yelpers. =)",

It's the only thing that can ease my abused digestive and nervous systems into a state of complacency.    I did not get decent pho here.  In fact, it's the first pho I've ever eaten that made my hangover worse.    Maybe I just got a bad batch.  I don't know.    My bowl was awful.  The broth tasted of nothing but salt.  The subtle flavors of meat and spice that my body craved simply were not there.  I tried to enhance the flavor profile with the usual panel of hot sauces, to no avail.    The meat was alright, if a little tough.  The veggies were pitiful.  Half the leaves on the mint were grayish brown and wilted, and the bean sprouts were slimy.  It all made for a bad brew.  I ate all the meat out of it, and that was about it.  I usually drink the broth like it's the elixir of life, but not this time.  I may as well have been sipping on hot brine.  I couldn't even eat the noodles, as they had been steeped in the brackish concoction.  The pho left me excessively parched for hours, exacerbating my hangover, and did little to help my stomach ache.    I won't be back.  Which is a shame, because the bahn mi looked great.    At any rate, the food is cheap, and the service is lackadaisical, as is traditional for family-run Asian eateries.  I wouldn't go for the pho, but the bahn mi might be worth a try.

The rice is plentiful, the meat is tasty. The sandwich had deliciously light, crisp bread and they are reasonably generous with the meat. I've had \"the real deals\" out in California so it's kind of hard to put them on the same pedestal, but as far as Vegas is concerned, they are pretty damn good.

He was rolling his eyes and was not very accommodating. After asking one question, he made me feel uncomfortable about asking another one. Yes, it is very near home (and near UNLV where I usually study at) but to be honest, I'd rather drive a few more miles for a better experience. Price was a little more than others too and they're not even great. I will probably go somewhere else if there are other options.",

Pretty good for a Vegas sandwich but I guess I was expecting more after reading all the other reviews. The bread was good but not great. It's no Lee's where you have that crispy crunchy crust that somehow feels like it melts in your mouth. There were plenty of veggies but they didn't have enough flavor. The veggies have a thinner cut than a Lee's sandwich. They did put enough mayo and pate in the sandwich.",

A couple of people had pho, which I didn't bother trying since I wanted egg rolls. My mom ordered the bbq pork banh mi, which took forever and a day to finally arrive at the table.  We saw many sandwiches made but my mom's sandwich never came till we mentioned it. Mentioning it to the servers was a challenge itself because those people did not give a shit about our table. Two of their servers were constantly bickering and nothing was getting to them. Seriously, there were no spoons at our table so we said F it and took spoons from another table. We also ordered an avocado shake which didn't come till 10 minutes after the banh mi came.   The guy gave us the lame excuse of being super busy and losing track of orders. Well douchebag, if it's so busy then why did everyone else get their orders on time? Yeah you can shove that banh mi up your--",

I did try this place before the new owners took over out of desperation and I wasn't all that satisfied and it was a bit dirty. Now the staff are super friendly, food is awesome, and they keep the place clean. I  got their delicious sandwiches there many times during the hot seasons and now I keep going back for their pho number 11 with combo selection of meat. I have tried other Pho places but their broth was either too oily or did not have any taste at all so you would have to add a bunch of condiments in it. Pho Thanh Huong's pho is sooo delicious and I can't wait to taste the yummy, hot, goodness right when it is served. It warms up my soul! I hardly put any condiments in it except for the lime, mint, and bean sprouts.",

First I walk up to the doors and there are pictures of food in the window which weren't there before. Then the inside was painted a different color. I looked at the menu at the to go counter and it was actually missing essential Vietnamese items like pho and vermicelli. The staff was also entirely different than the family that used to run the restaurant. So after I ordered my sandwich and I ask if there is a different owner. And the gal responds \"Yes, different owner.\" UHH OHH! I ordered my usual charred pork bahn mi. I immediately noticed the bread was still the same, but the daikon radish was definitely different. More of a vinegar taste vs the mayonnaise taste, totally didn't like it. They also added cucumbers which the previous owners didn't do. Overall I think this place is on the wrong path. I will definitely come back to give them another chance, hopefully better changes will be implemented.",

I was assured they cook their own bread so i was getting fired up !  i walked in - there it is a huge oven - looks like a walk-in fridge - it's huge !  all the banh mi $2.75 ( still slightly higher than the so cal / m. park places but that's ok ! )  ordered the #1 grilled pork and the #2 ham/steamed pork/pate.  i watched them prepare - decent sized roll - thrown into a microwave ?!?! wtf !!  are you kiddin' me ? I'm feeling a little down .  I see the veggies - daikon, carrots, cilantro, etc - good.  Looks like the pate is pre-sliced ( not from a can - at least i don't think so ) i didn't see the ham.  the pork looked good.  rolled it up in paper the standard small rubberband - i'm on the road - gotta get home - SOON !  while driving - the smells - catfish, pupusa, banh mi - F IT !  i rip open the grilled pork banh mi - that's a big roll !  i can't believe i'm saying this -  crunchy outside so light, airy inside - delicious ( thought for sure the micro was gonna f-it up ! )  and the pork  - very, very good ! maybe a touch to much pepper but people, the flavors from the cilantro, the pork, the daikon, the pepper, Lord let there be banh mi's in heaven !! ( then again, can i be there too ?!?! )   i gotta hit nhu lan again on the westside to give them another chance, otherwise this is my new vegas banh mi stop !!",

I went there around 8:50pm and they close at 9. so know when they open and close if you want to get what you want. p.s. the shopping center is one sketchy place... i swear I saw few crack heads come out of that vons.  i got the #1 sandwich (grilled pork). and let me tell you... IT's EFFIN GREAT. The guy heated the roll, which was superb. crunchy on the outside, warm and chewy on the inside. i am totally salivating as I write the review. i also got the bun for my cousin, and because we got there so late, they ran out of their eggrolls. but not to worry, they gave us more meat to even it out.  i'd totally come back here next time, and order few sandwiches to go for the flight back home.",

We have been to several Vietnamese restaurants since we moved here in August.  The first two had great interiors with ok food and less than great service.  We have probably gotten the best service at this restaurant than any other Vietnamese restaurant we've ever been to.  Our server gave my BF a hearty laugh when he smelled his pho and basked in its aroma.  He agreed that what he ordered was the best, he had just finished eating his.  The family that I guess owns the place was just hanging out at another table since we were the only customers.  We got the BBQ Pork Banh Mi (#18) and I got the #4 pho (rare flank & brisket) and BF got the pho dac biet (it has everything, sorry he ordered by name b/c he thinks he's cool like that).  Make sure you specify the size b/c they gave me a large I think b/c my BF asked for a small.  The banh mi is off the chain and the pho is greasy and delicious.

The broth of the pho soup is addictive. It's so tasty I'd rather have extra broth than noodles! It tastes perfect--with the right amount of saltiness I want in a broth, and the soup just warms my stomach up. I always get full with the pho dac biet. I also tried the pho brisket--it's also tasty!  The sandwiches are great--the bread is always delightfully baked by the restaurant--they bake it themselves! From this, you know it has the perfect fluffy-on-the-inside-and-crunchy-on-the-outside texture. I usually come early so I can be one of the first people to get a fresh batch of baked bread. I love it with butter--it just melts delicious into the bread. I'm drooling right now~ My favorite sandwich has got to be the grilled chicken sandwich with pate. It's so delicious. I usually put a lot of spicy sauce on it and extra jalapenos for the right kick! Do I sound overly enthusiastic about this place? Yes? GOOD. THAT'S HOW I WANT TO SOUND!  As for the smoothies, I've tried all of them. The boba is chewy and soft, and is a tasty sugary treat. I don't particularly like the strawberry, mango, or guyabano shake though. I don't recommend them. What I DO recommend is the Taro shake, avocado and the honeydew shake. It's the best out of all of them!   Overall I give them 5 stars for variety, service, and tastiness (is that a word?)  I know for certain--I will come here again~",

Anyway, I went for pho and was satisfied. A large order of rare steak and brisket pho is only $6.99 and although I haven't tried them yet, their sandwiches look amazing (and seemed very popular with the many to-go customers buzzing in and out while I ate), and on top of that, they have dried shredded chicken available for sale which I proudly pointed out to my boyfriend in the hopes he'll stop making fun of the large container of pork-fu in my kitchen cabinet.

But, I'm comparing that to southern cali prices and this IS vegas afterall.  After ordering the large bowl of pho, I now I understand why they charge you a pot of gold for it.  The large pho is ridiculously huge, probably one of the biggest bowls of pho I've ever seen.  You can easily feed 3 hungover people on a large bowl.  While it wasn't the best bowl of pho I've ever had, it's decent enough to deliver some nutrients to you're malnourished-starved body after a hard night of partying and some crying in the shower.    3 stars.  Tip: If you need to rehydrate, go ahead and order a fresh coconut here.  It'll run you $4, which is not much for some much needed electrolytes.",

The thing to do is order extra sandwiches to take home for lunch the next day. Or for a snack later.   The sandwiches are better than those served at most places in Chinatown. If this place were closer to my home/work I would probably go several times a week.  Service is quick and attentive. The servers and hostess are kind and accommodating to even our odd requests. They're on the younger side, perhaps UNLV students? Let's tip them well!",

I like this idea because I usually order a combination pho and catch myself picking out the tripe and tendon.   I have to say the Grilled Chicken Banh Mi was the best Banh Mi I've had in town!

A funny thing I've been told is when you walk into an asian restaurant and you just take a quick assessment of the customers and if you find that they're majority asian, then it must be good right? LOL  Sure it was cold but I wasn't going to get pho. I wanted something crispy and by looking at the Banh Mis that were passing the tables I wanted to get one myself and honestly at only $5 how could we have gone wrong?  I had the bbq pork banh mi, while A. had another with some cold cuts and a kind of pate. We also ordered shrimp crackers, which were like shrimp chips back home but larger and came in their own wrapped plastic bag. The fried chicken came out really quickly and it was super tasty. We were both trying to figure out what kind of spices or what they do to prepare it. My guess was it was baked. Delicious none the less.  The wait to get our order taken took a bit, but they had a sign out looking for help. The hostess and the waitress were both young girls, looking like they went to school at UNLV right across the street.",

    "text": "Pho Thanh Huong offers hot and cold noodle soup, a variety of rice dish, Banh Mi sandwich, and a great selection of beverages like club soda, smoothies with boba, and fresh coconut. For my meal I chose #24 Com Ga Xao Xa Ot which is a Spicy Lemongrass Chicken ($9.50) serve with a side of white rice and salad. They serve the meal really fast, it took within 10 minutes. The chicken taste very spicy. I was hoping there would be a hint of lemongrass flavor, but all I can taste is how spicy the chicken is. So I end up pouring a small bowl of sweet fish sauce over the chicken just to tame the heat. The salad taste okay. It's mainly fresh lettuce, cucumber, and two slice tomatoes topped with pickled radish. Even though it's a simple salad, it did balance nicely with the meal.  In addition, I chose #53 Che Ba Mau ($3.95) which is a Tricolored Dessert in a cup filled with green jelly, sweetened azuki beans, mashed yellow mung beans in coconut cream and topped with shaved ice. The Che Ba Mau is somewhat similar to the popular Filipino Halo Halo. The only difference between the two shaved ice dessert is that with Che Ba Mau, you get three ingredients and coconut flavor. Whereas with Halo Halo, you get a lot more ingredients including ice cream and they use evaporated milk. Personally I prefer Che Ba Mau, it's a light and tasty dessert and I like that it's not too sweet.  The restaurant can accommodate up to 57 people. The lighting is dim, but there is a lot of open space, you can sit comfortably without having your chair bump into any person. I notice the background music is a mix of R&B and Pop, the song I hear playing is \"Havana.\" The service is very friendly. They are attentive and asked if I need anything and if everything is okay. Overall I feel good about my order, but I think it would have been better if I had ordered a Banh Mi sandwich.",

I would've never thought I would be able to find a Vietnamese restaurant on this side of town.   Right when I walked in there was a cart full of fresh baguettes!!! I was so happy I called in and order a bahn mi. The smell alone made me hungry. The bahn mi was around $5 and it was bugger than a 6\" at Subway.   As much as I wanted to down this bad boy, you know you cannot eat bahn mi's in the car.  FYI! The crunch of the baguette will dirty your car in an instant. Find a place, sit down, and let the flakes fly everywhere!!   The meat was so good and the pickled cabbage was fresh.   The parking is a bit sketchy but once you go inside it's clean and get a great welcome from the staff. The restaurant is definitely family owned as everyone was so nice.   Check it out if you're near UNLV and is craving a Vietnamese sandwich!",

Why does it smell so heavily of smoke?!  2) I watched as the server grabbed the handle of an ice scoop that was sitting in a bucket of ice (the HANDLE part was laying in the ice), and then scooped ice into a water glass, dropped the scoop back Into the back (handle hitting the ice as well), filled glass with water, and brought that glass over to me.   3) I looked up and saw the \"C\" grade from the health department, and decided it was time to walk out. If this restaurant is clearly contaminating items that handle food in FRONT of guests, I can only imagine what's happening behind the scenes.   The restaurant needs a good cleaning to get rid of the smoke smell, but above all else, employees need to go through the food handling safety class. So, SO disgusting!!",

So I ordered a Pho Tai Chin and it came out in a timely fashion.  And that is when it went down hill, the broth was rather bland and the veggies looked old and wilted with brown spots.  But, the worse part was the Chin part was not lean at all ----it was curtains of nasty connective tissue and fat, totally inedible!!!  There was very little of the lean Tai beef, so I was forced to pick through a heaping mess of connective tissue to find some edible Tai beef.  I know now that Pho is not their strong point here, but it is decieving when its part of the restaraunts name.",

But I have seen her on many other occasions doing the same thing to other customers as well. The easiest would be to just write down the number you want on a piece of paper and handle it over to her. Otherwise she still will not get it! I have seen her also talking on the phone to a friend or family member while customers were waiting and she just did not care. On another occasion we ordered some sandwiches and wanted to eat it in. The counter person asked us to place the order with the waitress and the waitress referred us back to the counter. It went back and forth before I started to complain. We could not believe it. It was ridiculous. The sandwiches here are great, all other dishes are very mediocre but the service is the worst..",

I came here years ago before I was on Yelp and thought they were good, but only if I happened to be in the neighborhood while craving Vietnamese.. They had pretty good sandwiches, but I just didn't end up back here again until today.   I ordered a grilled beef banh mi and Thai tea with boba. The sandwiches looked a lot different than I remembered them. The French bread they use is enormous and much bigger than on my previous visit. The meat they used was a little different than I'm used to in banh mi. It was a little smokier than I like but very moist. It was a little on the messy side. They packed it to go in a way that was difficult to eat without dripping meat juice all over myself while I ate. The pickled veggies were hidden under the meat which made them a little soggier and less crunchy. I'll have to ask them to put the veggies on top next time so they stay fresh and don't drown in meat juice. The bread was really great. A little breadier than I'm used to, more like a bolillo shape than French bread but very flaky and light. The Thai tea with boba was good. A little on the sweeter side, but still good.   The price is right, so I'll definitely give them another chance if I find myself in the area again. I was perusing the menu and their pho and other hot menu items seemed to run on the more expensive side compared to other pho restaurants I frequent. I think this is a good place to grab a cheap sandwich on the go.",

Brought a colleague along who never had Pho before. First slurp  in, he is now a Pho foodie. Great broth and chicken was of good quality. Also had a Bahn Mi (pork) sandwich. Great as well. Service was also good and our waitress was helpful, nice and attentive. Will be back on my next trip to Vegas.",

They were not really that busy snd people who came after us were being waited on . They finally took our order and it took another 30 min before my friends were served with soup . Then it took another 15 min before my order came up - which was rice  and.meat . The food was very cold - I could not eat it .  I asked for a box to go so that I can heat it up at home .  She said she would get the box but she never got it - she just ignored me and served other people while I was waiting at the cashiers . Finally I had to ask another server and waited another 10 min before she gave me my totally bad service and bad food !! Do not go !! If there was a 0 - I would've given that rating to them -",

    "text": "With all honesty. I am surprise about the ratings. We called this store in advance, one of workers picked up the phone and just suddenly hang up the phone; therefore, we just went straight to the store.  When we got to the store, there were tables open; a table with four seats to be exact. No one was in line; we (there was 3 of us) were the only one. We didn't get seated until after 15-20 minutes of waiting.   When we got seated, we knew what to order and we were ready, but one of the male waiter told us to wait. We waited for 20 minutes just for a different waiter to get our order! Some of the customers that came after us got their order first. I get that theyre busy but they should atleast try and accomadate or atleast reassure the customer.   The restaurant, in my opinion, lacks organization or control; everyone seemed to be all over the place.  As for the food, I thought it was delicious. Definitely worth coming back to. The place is clean. However, with the experience that we had, coming for the first time, we probably wont come back. Sorry no tip.",

Mi xao mem with chicken instead of pork, it was delicious! The seafood pho was good, but it could have been better. Ended with boba drinks - it was great! Attentive waitress and quick food delivery.

    "text": "IMO, one of the best pho I've had in Las Vegas. Maybe it tasted better because I wasn't too busy being pissed off at shitty service I usually get at the other more popular pho restaurants?  My last time here was a LONG time ago, and I've been waiting to be around the area to go again. Tonight, I noticed they redesigned their menus and made some other changes to the decor. It looks nicer than last time.  The boyfriend and I normally get #28 the Special Rice Combo which comes with rice (duh), grilled pork, grilled shrimp and 2 fried eggrolls. Has a small side of vegetables (pickled carrots and daikon radish on top of lettuce, and tomatoes and cucumbers). I'm in love with pork and theirs is scrumptious. But their grilled shrimp is pretty amazing also... one of the best shrimp I've ever had AND THEY DE-VEIN THE SHRIMP! All this for $9.50!! And they make the shrimp look pretty... If that matters to you...  We also got the spring rolls.. they could use a little more \"umph\" since there was only like one slice of meat in it but their peanut sauce is good.  I told my boyfriend I don't think I want to go to any other Vietnamese restaurant other than here from now on. He HATES pho (yeah i know, who hates pho?!) but he took a small bite of mine and liked it so that means something, right?  Also idk about during the normal lunch/dinner hours because we normally come here around 9:30pm but we've never had to wait to be seated and they have pretty good customer service. Not extraordinary service or anything but they check in often, take our orders in a timely manner, refill drinks, etc. which is way more than what you're going to get at places like Pho Kim Long or Pho So 1.",

The inside of this place is definitely lackluster, it feels like it's been there awhile without any updates. What we found to be hilarious was the Usher circa 2000 they were blasting in the background, the CD literally skipped away...  Somehow the employees didn't seem to notice. But hey, I mean, if the food is good..  Service The waitress was nice enough. She did forget our iced thai tea, when we brought it to her attention she apologized and ended up taking it off the bill which we appreciated  Food We started off with the shrimp spring rolls & peanut sauce. The sauce was nice and rich but the spring rolls were certainly boring. Wolf didn't even realize there was shrimp inside until half way into his second roll! It looked like they just put green leaf lettuce, some tasteless shrimp and rice noodles. Kitty always orders spring rolls and unfortunately, to her, these were far from the tastiest; Some more herbs/veggies would have been nice.  Kitty ordered the beef broth pho, you can order whatever meats you want in it. Unfortunately the pho was just okay, even with tons of basil and lime it wasn't very flavorful. She appreciated the amount of meat in it but without a fulfilling broth it was kinda flat.  Wolf had the bbq chicken which comes with a tiny side salad and white rice. The chicken was great! The marinade/sauce was divine, just enough tang and sweetness, (with those satisfying grill marks) ! The chicken was tender, juicy and oh so yummy. White rice was white rice of course and the salad had some vinegar but otherwise the veggies were tasteless.   *So the question is... Will HOWL&MEOW return?  Naw. Not this place. Although the chicken was great nothing else stood out and there are so many other Vietnamese places to check out in Vegas. Stay tuned!",

It was fresh and flavorful, and priced right too at just over $5.00 with tax! The bread was amazing, nice and crunchy on the outside, soft and tasty on the inside! The veggies were fresh, and the meats were tasty and plentiful! Service was efficient although the sandwich took about 10 minutes or so to come out, it was well worth the wait! I'll definitely stop in again as the sandwich was delicious and the prices are right as well!",

    "text": "It took us a while to get seated, and it took approximately 25-30 minutes for our two pho dishes to come out. I'm not sure why it took so long, but pho shouldn't take more than 10 minutes, since the broth is prepared beforehand.  We also did the Yelp check in for 10% off our order and our server forgot to put it on our bill. When my husband paid, he asked if our 10% was included and the young lady who was handling our bill said no. Instead of correcting it she just let it be. We don't care about paying at extra 10%, but it's the (lack of) principle behind the customer service that made us very disappointed.   Pho was good despite the wait, but it doesn't compare to pho that you can get in Southern California like in Westminster or Garden Grove.  Food - 4 stars Wait (to be seated and for food to arrive) - 1 star Service - 2-3 stars  Overall - 2 stars",

We were actually here for a weekend volleyball tournament. We ended up coming here twice in 3 days! Everything we had was so good- pho tai, bun, banh mi, spring rolls, soda chanh... NOTHING disappointed!  The grilled pork banh mi were only $3.25 and delicious!!! They actually make their bread there on site, & it's as good as the best I've had in SoCal!!!  The pho broth was so, so good- not too salty or strong. The noodles were perfectly cooked & never got soggy! Service was great & the restaurant was clean. A short drive down from the Strip in a random strip mall across the street from the UNLV Campus~ well worth the short trek down from any of the big hotels!  Definitely make this your go-to Vegas stop for Pho!!!",

I eat pho on a regular basis-- probably every 2 weeks because it is my comfort food. So, when my husband and I flew into Vegas after a 2 hour delay, feeling tired, drained, and cold, all I wanted was some comfort food! After Yelping and seeing how close this was to the LAS airport, we came in and ordered a pho, a grilled beef banh mi, and a vermicelli combo dish. We were both SOOO happy with our meals!  Initially, I felt like my pho was not hot enough. The soup seemed lukewarm, so I asked for a bowl of hot broth to dip my beef slices. Our waitress was kind enough to bring a small cup over and it was exactly what I needed. Can't wait to come back!",

We ordered a lime soda drink and the waitress forgot to serve it so we had to have it taken out of our bill. It was a slow day and there were several staff members so I am not impressed with their service hence the 4 stars. The food is good. Except, The grill beef is a little too sweet.  The lotus salad was excellent and their bread is amazingly fresh since they baked it at the restaurant daily! definitely it redeemed for the sloppy service.",

I had a mixed seafood (squid, shrimp, faux crab, fish balls) noodle soup and a mango pearl shake.  Everything was fresh-tasting and appealing.   I'll definitely return to try the sandwiches another time.  I've returned once, no change in rating.   I had a bowl with shrimp cakes, pork, vegetables and noodles.  I also had a taro pearl shake.  Everything was tasty.  Taro pearl shakes are mild and a little sweet (just enough), and a strange color lavender.

The feeling continued when I walked in and got the distinct smell of recent cigarette smoking (perhaps from within the kitchen?) No matter, I thought to myself - the banh mi will be worth it.  I was (sniff sniff) wrong.  Though the bread was warm, it didn't have the flakiness that I've come to enjoy with good banh mi, and the filling to bread ratio was sadly lacking.  The daikon/carrot mix inside the 'wich overpowered all of its other flavors... so much so that I kept adding chili sambal paste to make this meal go down easier.  Even my banh mi companion (she believes herself to be an expert) admitted that the food was below sub-par. Add to that the overall inattentiveness of the staff, and well... SIGH. Too bad.  I really wanted to like this place after reading some of the rave reviews but, after my experience, don't think I'll be returning.  Only highlight: the low prices -- $3 for a 'wich ain't bad.... but the old adage, \"You get what you pay for....\" seems to ring True here.",

They were so springy on the outside that it reminded my five of those gel filled rubber stress tube things (and they were the most expensive things ordered).  To drink we had the an iced coffee and a thai iced tea.   They were both pretty good, but they put too much milk and made the drink kinda thick.

This has happened a few times already.)  The decor is really much better than it was, and there is AC now, with a few portable (and quiet) units.  The service is quick when you do sit-down, and they're nice enough people, but of course they're not 5-star-restaurant material.  Highly recommended, get #1, it's the most flavorful.  The best thing to do when going with someone is to share a pho (which ever one you like) and a sandwich each.  That way you avoid over-ordering.  This will probably run you about $12.

Charged for 8.50. Only 3 pieces of lemon were given. We used lemon to neutralize bacteria (it is an old belief) or brown the raw beef (cook in acidic lime). Usually 6 to 8 was given. The crushed peanut was undercooked (fried).  1-star. No pickled carrot was given for the eggroll. Never seen such tiny shrimps in fried rice in a Vegas restaurant before (see photo).

From the outside, this strip mall seems best to be avoided, but if you're looking for cheap eats, stop by for sure. When ordering their sandwiches, don't get fancy. Stick with the BBQ pork. The others are just okay. They also don't load them up with as many pickled veggies as other pho joints so it lacks some depth. Get a bowl of their 'built it yourself' pho and you get to pick exactly what goes in to it. I told them everything, and indeed I got all the 'adventurous' bits  :)  I'm happy I found this place. They usually have some UNLV student working here, so service is decent.",

We stopped in here to grab a quick bite before starting our trip and it was the best/worst idea ever. Best because the food was great but worst because throughout our entire trip we were comparing everything we ate to the food here and wishing we had taken some sandwiches to go (which we didn't ugh!). On our way home, we drove like a maniac from the Grand Canyon and made it back to Vegas in good time, just in time for some departure Pho. (They open at 10am! I've never had Pho at 10am!) We were all afraid the quality would've changed but it hasn't. The pho was still delicious and the Viet sandwich with ham and cold cuts was still delicious. If I'm ever in Vegas again, this would be my first and last stop.",

Also, the Yelp check in coupon isn't accepted anymore.  There was a strange smell permeating throughout the empty restaurant.   I got the Pho Dac Biet, best way to judge a pho restaurant. Broth had a mild flavor, there was one or two pieces of each type of meat, and there was a moderate amount of noodles to mask the lack of substance to the bowl.  Thoroughly unsatisfying.   We also got a sandwich, which was made with yesterday's bread. I know when you do sandwiches to go, they're not super warm.  However, our sandwich came out cold. Danggggggggg, that's saying to me \"we're not even trying.\"  The sandwich itself was alright  once it warmed up in my mouth.

The sandwich was very good, and as most note, a great deal at less than $4.  I also had egg rolls, which were standard.  I will say they brought my sandwich out at least 7 minutes before the egg rolls.  I understand they take longer to cook, but I would have preferred everything being brought out at once.

    "text": "Located near Vons on Tropicana and Maryland (across the street from UNLV), Pho Thanh Huong has the BEST tasting Vietnamese Coffee with Tapioca Boba I've ever had!  Their tapioca boba is almost always flawlessly cooked - the perfect blend of chewy and soft.    When you enter the restaurant, there is an area where \"to-go\" food/drinks (eggs rolls, shrimp chips, etc) may be ordered.  Past the \"to-go\" area is restaurant seating.     Food Selection: Pho Thanh Huong offers inexpensive menu items similar to what you would expect from a typical Vietnamese pho restaurant - beef noodle soups, rice plates, sandwiches, egg rolls, etc.  We ordered Pho Tai (beef noodle soup with rare steak) and Com Tam (broken rice with BBQ pork) with a side order of fried eggs.  The food is average tasting but tasty enough to satisfy my Vietnamese food cravings.   Customer Service: The employees are pleasant and will accommodate any special requests without judgment.  My food orders have always been fulfilled in a timely manner.  This restaurant appears to be family-owned and I love supporting small businesses.    Miscellaneous: The restaurant's decor is to some extent outdated but their restroom is clean and there is plenty of parking.   Will I Return? I will definitely return especially for their very addicting Vietnamese coffee!",

The drinks we ordered were iced coffee and were not brought right away but about 5 minutes after ordering. The coffee was very good and very strong, perfect for Vegas hangover. I ordered a pork sandwich and it was so good. The meat was great and the bread was so light and fresh. I could tell they bake the bread on-site everyday. I really enjoyed the food here and would eat there again. The pho looked really good too from what I could see around me.",

They have a huge selection of noodle soup, sandwiches, and rice dishes. Don't expect to have any service. In fact, you may have to go get your own menu because sometimes there is no one in the front end... may be they like to hide in the kitchen?!  We had lunch here twice within one week. We've tried Bun Bo Hue $7.49 (tender slices of beef, garnished with fried onions and mixed veggie in a spicy hue-style round noodle beef soup), Bun Rieu $6.49 (vermicelli rice noodle served with tofu, tomatoes, and mixed veggie in a fine shrimp and crab paste soup), Com Ca Hai Nam $7.99 (steamed Hoi-nan chicken with rice and ginger sauce), Bun Rieu Oc $6.99 (vermicelli rice noodle served with escaargots, tofu, tomatoes, and mixed veggie in a fine shrimp and crab paste soup), Vietnamese ice coffee with milk $3.23.   All the noodle soup were yummy. The chicken with rice dish was quite bad - not the correct way to make Hoi-nan chicken and the meat was very old... but the rice was good. Overall, I think it worth a try especially if you like noodle soup!",

I was visiting from Chicago not too long ago and was happy to be able to get some authentic Vietnamese fare. I tried the #2 sandwich,cant remember exactly what it had but it was fresh, simple yet very tasty. I also tried the BBQ pork one on another day and was even more impressed. I love that their prices are very affordable. One of these sandwiches beats spending 5-7 dollars at subway any day!!  Oh an another plus, my friends and I who were traveling back to Chicago decided to pick a sandwich up for the plane ride. I ended up not eating it till after landing and the sandwich held up really well throughout the whole day!",

Given the in and out nature of my usual visits, to speak of poor service as others have would be irresponsible of me.  Instead I will rate the food and nothing more.    I always get the same menu item when I go.  It is not pho.  It is not bahn mi.  I don't know the name of the dish I get but I can tell you it is my favorite.  Rice noodles with grilled pork and shrimp, peanuts, lettuce, a salad of carrot and daikon, and a spring roll.  It has always been good.  The pork is tender and flavorful.  The shrimp is not overcooked.  The spring roll was hot enough to scorch my mouth last time I went.  It is always crispy and flakey.  I crave it some times.  In fact, I'm kind of craving it now.  I have had the same dish else where and it was good there too.  When it comes to Pho Thanh Huong though, it is the original for me.  It is where I choose to eat when I need a good noodle fix on the go.",

The bread is soft and fluffy like a cloud.  It isn't a long baguette.  It is more of an ovular shape.  (Perfect shape for banh mi dances). Stout would be the correct way to describe it.  The grilled pork is flavorful and tangy.  The jalapenos give you a nice kick in the pants.  The ratio of meat to radishes to jalapenos to cilantro is just perfect.  At $2.50 and some change, this is the cheapest and tastiest near the strip!",

I got the chicken and pate sandwich which was decent for $3.50. The fillings were great but what makes a good vietnamese sandwich is the bread. I found the bread to be too crumbly...I ended up with crumbs all over me lol. They should think about converting to baguettes like most Vietnamese sandwich shops have...it is easier to eat.   The place is decent for a quick bite before class...but I'd probably go to Mr. Sandwich once that opens by UNLV if I'm craving Vietnamese sandwiches.",

    "text": "I just cannot like this place.  Or maybe I should just say Pho in general.  I have tried.  Honestly, I have.  And if I have tried at any place, it is certainly this location.  The decor is plain.  Some carpeting and a standard counter with plenty of table space for groups.  The menu photos are bleak.  And the soup is basically water and noodles with vegetables and whatever else you tell them to throw in there for the price.  I have had friend after friend drag me in to this place and tell me that Pho would change my life.  Sadly, however, it did not.  It was simply Pho.  And I was unsatisfied.  The location is convenient for UNLV students, being located right by campus.  The prices were reasonable for water soup in a bowl.  But try as I might, and no matter how many spices I tried to throw in it to flare it, it was still just runny, watery, soup.  If you like Pho and you don't mind simple decor and okay service, you will probably enjoy this place.  But if you're never ventured towards the land of Vietnamese soups and you're wondering - you can probably pass.",

A quick yelp search brought this place up so we headed over.  Located in the shopping center with Vons or Smiths grocery (not sure which) on the SW corner of Maryland Pkwy and Tropicana. Very nice restaurant, clean, and with plenty of seating. They were playing the football game on TV so +1 for me.   Ordered the pork chop and a bowl of Pho Tai Chin. Food came out quickly and was decent, the pork chop was kind of small but flavorful. The Pho was very tasty, with plenty of meat to go with the broth. I always taste the broth before adding anything, and this had a nice flavor. A little squeeze of lime and a few bean sprouts and its all warm in my belly.  Its not fancy, but its good. Its not expensive, but its good. Will definitely be back because its easier to get here than to the places on Eastern. Family owned and operated.",

The Ch gio was soggy and oily and the worst of the bunch is the Che Ba Mau.  The mung bean and red beans were undercooked and lacking in flavor.  The coconut milk is bland and the jelly was tasteless.  The whole thing was so gross that I threw it in the trash.

They pack this really well for takeout, if you're in a rush.  Their bahn mi are made with fresh, fantastic French bread- some of the best bread I've found in town, actually. For under $4, the sando is stuffed with toppings, but I'd personally ask for extra pate.  They advertise the smoothies as being made with fresh fruit- I'm not sure how True that is but the jackfruit version is perfection in a cup. Not too sweet, no artificial flavor, would get again... But their boba is pretty flavorless, so I'd skip that. Smoothies automatically come with boba (for $5/ea) but if you as for it without, they're closer to $3- but they may forget and give you boba anyway out of habit (happened to me).",

The restaurant looks nice and clean, the service was very friendly and welcoming.   I've had the pleasure of sitting down to a nice bowl of Pho and they definitely improved on the flavors.    One of the good things about their Pho menu is it's newbie-friendly.   There's a picture of the different meats/ingredients, and you could choose to add any or all to your pho.   All the staples are there and then some.  I personally love everything but tripe in my soup.  The different cooked meats, meatballs, tendon.. so delicious.    More importantly though, their Bahn Mi (vietnamese sandwiches) are SO good here.   They bake their bread fresh and the portions of their meat and veggies are excellent.  I always order the grilled pork.  Just a tip: the Jalapeno slices they top the sandwich with are hot.  So ask them to put it on the side if you aren't sure you'd like them.  I've also enjoyed their vietnamese meatball sandwich, but their egg and chinese sausage sandwich wasn't much to talk about.  I've already bought 6 sandwiches and brought them to my co-workers.  They are IN LOVE with it.   Super damn good!",

So if you're looking for a good friendly meal and you're in the area, give them a try. BTW, it seemed like the local Vietnamese people like it. At least I assume that was the language of about half the clientele.",

This place is good for banh mi sandwiches and rice plates but lacks traditional Vietnamese value in the vermicelli noodle bowls and appetizers. I am disappointed with the quantity of food you get in takeout, I feel like it's far less than other places. The deep fried egg rolls traditionally are rice paper filled with noodles, veggies, and lettuce. This restaurant however, does it the cheap way. They use a different wrap that's not rice paper and fill it with a big piece of meat. It's just a log of sausage. Traditional Vietnamese egg rolls are extremely different and better. I am disappointed that this restaurant and many other pho restaurants in the area don't do real authentic traditional egg rolls.   The pork and shrimp vermicelli was great, the nuoc mum was a little sweeter than what I prefer but was still great. Overall it's an okay restaurant but for someone like me who is Vietnamese and knows tradition....I'll stick to a place that's more authentic.",

Place was busy. You got people waiting for to-go orders and people arriving to get seated.  They sat us at an open table pretty quick but it was dirty. Server noticed and cleaned it right away after we had sat.  We each did the check in but I realized you just have to mention the free eggrolls to get it I think.   We ordered:  *2 free eggrolls -  he didn't bring the fish sauce sauce that you dip it.. I waited for my dish which usually comes with it to come out before I could eat it lol Bf dipped it in the peanut sauce. It didn't have much veggies in it and was quite packed with filling which I didn't hate. It was okay but hey, free.  *fresh spring rolls 2pcs. w/ pork and shrimp I found them decent spring rolls, not too much lettuce. The peanut sauce was lighter and less thicker than most places but I actually preferred it like that.  *Pho combo with everything but tripe and tendon Bf ordered this and said it was quite watered down and I agree. The broth didnt have depth. It didnt make you WANT to scoop another spponful of it after one bite. He had to use hoisin sauce to add some flavor. But it didn't taste like a mouthful of msg either which would have you chugging water even after eating it.  *grilled pork chops Two thin but good sized chops on the bone. They were seasoned really well, not too salty or sweet and not overcooked either. The fish sauce sauce went well with it but could also do without it too. The pickled daikon and carrots that comes on the plate were flavorless. I usually eat it to cut the oil and fat at the end but it wasn't pickled with the right amount of sugar and vinegar. I wondered if they used that on their sandwiches..  I would come back for the chops and spring rolls if i was in the area for sure.",

On one of those rare rainy days here in Vegas, I began to feel a little homesick and decided to try this restaurant.   Upon walking in I was greeted by the friendly staff which automatically gave this place a couple stars. Customer service is a big part of my dining experience at any restaurant, and this place definitely meets my expectations. I decided to get a bowl of pho with brisket and sliced beef. My order came out quickly and was bigger than I had expected. The broth has a very good flavor and tastes even better with the addition of the bean sprouts, lime juice, and basil leaves. The meat was very tasty and plentiful as well.   When I went to the counter to pay my check, I discovered that the huge bowl of pho was only $8.50!

Fellow passengers look on in awe when I pull this delicacy from my briefcase (I do go a little heavy on the fish sauce). Meanwhile, if you are not in a rush, their full compliment of Pho is always prepared just right... It's in the broth.  Of course they have Thai Boba Tea and all the best that Vietnamese cuisine has to offer.  Their spare ribs are as good as any Korean Kalbi you can find!  My kids eat the stuff like candy.  If you're here in Vegas for a convention or on vacation and looking for something delicious and different... Pho Thanh Huong is right down the street from the Strip. Go to this restaurant... You will love it!",

There's plenty of seating, something I always enjoy. They let you sit wherever. Most of the seating is built for larger parties, so if it's just 1 or 2 people, you might feel bad taking up a whole top. Don't worry, I've never seen it get super packed.  The Pho is what I get here. I usually just get the Pho with Rare and Flank steak. It's always been pretty good for me. You can get a baked french roll for 50 cents with was a nice addition to the Pho. The Thai tea was also pretty delicious.  The service is nice. It always feels like a bunch of high school kids working there, but there are pretty attentive and nice. Always looking to refill the water in your cup.  While the Pho has always been pretty good, I do have to say I can't vouch for the other food. One time I got a sandwich there, some rib sandwich. I did bite into it and I hit a bone in the meat. Why the hell there was a bone in meat in a sandwich is beyond me, but that was the only time I ever had an issue. I'm just so big into Pho there, I don't bother with anything else.   I think this place is worth a shot for people. They updated their menus so it looks much cleaner. They keep the place looking pretty nice. The staff is attentive and nice. The food is good. It's a nice Pho place.",

I havent been here in a long time and found out that they recently changed owners about 6 months ago.   Pork Bahn mi - They raised their prices about 50 cents, it used to be 3 dollars now its 3.50. The bread is pretty good but it seems a little bit more chewy than it was before. The fillings seemed to have gotten worse. They were Extremely stingy on the fillings and it was salty. Also didn't seem as juicy as before, maybe they need to add more mayo.  Sometimes when you try something great and find out that ownership has change, and it's not as good as before, it kinda pisses me off.",

Tl:dr good sandwiches, good price, long wait times without telling you if they are busy. Details below.   Unfortunately I won't be heading back anytime soon due to the sub par service I received as well as the attitude.   My mom was in town and wanted something quick so I suggested this place as we can order to go and it would be no problem.   Ordered 9 sandwiches. I saw tables that sat after I ordered being served sandwiches after I placed my order. After 20 minutes of waiting I asked for the status and the counter girl said it would be an additional 15 bc the back was busy. In the end it ended up taking 50 minutes and they shorted me one sandwich. They also did every single sandwich incorrectly from what ordered. At the end I told the girl next time if she could let a person know an order was going to take longer than half an hour in the beginning it would be better and her response was to call in the order next time. I always tip on a to go order and at that point I asked for the tip back which i regret doing as the other staff deserved it.   Wish them the best of luck and sorry that my regular counter girl wasn't there today.",

I yelped and saw a couple posting about PTH.  Anyway, a bunch of my family members came back over the week and tried different things and here what we found:  - Pho is similar to other places I found on the west side of town. The broth is below average and  tasted just like someone dipped a pho flavor bag into hot water. It has no natural sweetness at all.  - Bun thit nuong (grill pork vermicelli (not sure if this is correct spelling but too lazy now to look it up) was good.  -  Except soda that came in a can, all their specially made drinks weren't good.  - The best thing I found at this place is their grill pork sandwich. It was very very good. I would drive all the way here just for this sandwich.  By the way, some yelpers mentioned about the weird smell of this place, which I experienced while I was there. It has that stale cigarette smell that you normally experience when visit really old casino.",

    "text": "The restaurant has recently been taken over by new owners, a young couple, and they are very friendly. The Pho is pretty good, but I never had a bad pho anywhere in town. But their sandwiches are to die for. And they only cost $3-$3.50 (6' size).  The make their own bread in probably the biggest baking machine I've seen.  Overall great food and good service. This side of town needs more good Asian food, so we don't have to drive 1/2 hour to Chinatown every time.",

    "text": "Ok normally I go up a star when giving a half rating! But this time I'm going down just to the blase attitude of everyone there!! Would have been 3 stars but food just wasn't good! I've been here before and had there sandwiches and pho, the sandwiches are always up to par!! With the crispy flaky bread& slaw ( the BBQ pork was my fave) but i probably won't be back after my last visit! Ordered the pho, had flank steak, tendon, beef? And tripe, ordered with no tripe! And got some funky meatball concoction! Also had more tripe and tendon than any other meat!! Of course no one checked back! We had ordered crispy spring rolls and sent those back as an appetizer, they were cold and not fried when we ordered the fried, the waitress who barely spoke English took them back, and the people behind the counter ate them in full view of us!! With there rubber gloves on, than proceeded to make the next persons sandwich with the same gloves on!! Poor guy!! Well when they came out they were microwaved and more chewy than crispy!! Double gross! Also the pho came out lukewarm and meat even tho thinly sliced took awhile to cook in broth!! Speaking of the broth it was very tangy and gosh I really don't kno how to describe it, but was not up to par the way it used to be ( we joked that maybe we really pissed them off and well ...... The bathroom is in full view of dining and two employees did go before we got our pho, just saying!!) my friend tried adding soy sauce , hoisen sauce everything , but that weird flavor didn't go away and finally gave up ! He only maybe had 1/5 of it, if that, and gave up, me I ate the noodles, & what beef there was, but really couldn't get into the broth either! So I left it!! When paying we told them we didn't like it and if they wanted to , go look at the table and see what we left ,nothing was taken off the check, and no real apology was given! I think we even payed for the first spring rolls that were the waitress's mistake! For 2 people it was over 35$ so I know I got ripped, but I was angry at their in different attitude and in turn they lost a customer !! Not that u go there that often about every 6 or 7 weeks but this last time will definetly be my last !! Poor food , poor service , and over priced go to Chinatown and get some options of pho eateries!! Hope this helps!!   UPDATE I lowered it 1 star after reading some other reviews, cuz both my friend and I did get sick after eating there!! And also forgot to say,they have really started to skimp on the meat, in sandwiches, which I guess it wAs good cuz there was less to throw up!! Lol",

    "text": "This is the BEST place for Vietnamese sandwiches. I even think it might be in the overall top best sandwich shops in lv. My family's been going here for years and all those guys are fat so I have some credibility. If you don't think so try for yourself. They bake the bread in house and it is like sex biting into the crisp then supple roll, they grill the pork to tender perfection and is marinated with mouth watering smoky sweet goodness. Ask for less or no jalapeno if you aren't a spicy fanatic, but I recommend training yourself to be CUZ THESE GUYS DO SPICY RIGHT!!! Every time go to this place the sandwiches and service are always awesome and my experience always definitely exceeds my expectation.",
