    "text": "I made a last minute reservation at the Capital Grille in Las Vegas for my then-girlfriend's birthday. During the reservation process, they asked if it was for a special occasion and I let them know it was.  We were not readily greeted upon arrival, but once we were, the service from then on out was amazing. The table was prepared with confetti and a handwritten birthday greeting from the staff. Very nice touch. The view was quite nice as well.  They also had a small wine tasting prepared for the two of us, and at the end of our meal, they also brought her a special desert tray. The food was wonderful, I ordered the filet mignon which was cooked to perfection. The sides and salad were also very good.  It was on the pricey side, but it's a high class restaurant on the Las Vegas Strip, so... to be expected.  I really have nothing to complain about. It was a stellar experience and I will return if the urge strikes again, and I am sure that it will.",

They were able to accommodate our party for the time we wanted even though we called 3 hours before.    Decor looks fancy here, and like most steakhouses the lights are usually dim.  First step through the doors and we were immediately greeted then seated even when our whole party was not there.    We took our time and finally decided to order.   I ordered the:  - Lobster Bisque (Was light in flavor, buttery taste and lightly sweet)  - Porcini Rubbed Delmonico with 12-year aged Balsamic (so juicy and flavorful with a light taste of balsamic reduction) Shared:  - Pan Fried Calamari with hot cherry peppers ( so good, but kinda spicy when you eat the chili)  - Lobster Mac n Cheese (bite size lobster bits, creamy mac'n goodness with a crunchy top)  - creamed corn with bacon   Since it was my friend's birthday, they gave him a huge slice of chocolate cake and also added three desserts for the table to share.  They let us tried the creme brulee which was so sinfully good, the cheesecake was delicious, and a chocolate cake.  Free dessert made it even sweeter.  A fantastic first time experience.",

I have to say the service was very good and had a table next to the window. The issue was with the filet mignon I ordered  for 50.00 and is just the meat a la cart. On my first bite I found it dry with no taste and not what I was expecting for 50.00!  I did order a Caesar salad for an additional 12.00 but was just a Caesar salad , nothing special. I should have refused this order at that time but by the time I had my dinner the restaurant was busy ..",

    "text": "My husband insisted that we come to eat at The Capital Grille as his buddy from the Army had strongly recommended this place.  It's actually a chain restaurant owned by Black Angus.  Just a little interesting tidbit thrown in there for ya!  He's eaten at the Washington D.C. and Philadelphia location so now, he can add LV to his list of CGs he's been to.  My husband has raved about the quality of food and service he has received from the other locations for months so we decided to give it a try!  A group of at least 10 of us had taken a trip to LV for the weekend.  On our last evening, we had a nice dinner with Constantine as our server.  I kid you not, that was his name.  I thought of the movie, \"Constantine\" which suuuucked!  Anyhoo, he looked nothing at all like Keanu Reeves.    I was a bit disappointed by the food.  For appetizers, we had the pan fried calamari with hot cherry peppers which came out a bit cold.  The presentation was not impressive as it looked like limp, fried calamari bits strewn about, mixed with cherry peppers.  CG is known for its steaks so for the main course, I had the Kona Crusted Dry Aged Sirloin with Carmelized Shallot Butter.    I was sold on the title of the dish but upon coming out, the meat was dry after stating that I did want it cooked medium rare.  My husband had ordered the Steak Au Poivre which looked amazing and he ate every, single bite of it.  There are no sides that accompany the steak dishes so we ordered fresh vegetables and mashed potatoes.    What saves this restaurant are the desserts.  We tried the key lime pie, creme brulee, and the flourless chocolate espresso cake.  The key lime pie as my husband stated, \"Was on point.\"  It is a pricey place.  Two people would easily cost $150 without drinks.  The view is beautiful so request to be seated near the window.  I'm torn on weather I'd come here again.",

    "text": "Oh, I love Capital Grille.  For us, it's the standard bearer when it comes to a steakhouse.  So when we were in Vegas for our anniversary and needed someplace to celebrate the day, there was no question where we would go.  Of course the table was decorated when we got there and a handwritten note was waiting for us, with a wax seal.  We almost always order the same thing: lobster and crab cakes for an app, we both have a lettuce wedge for a salad.  I have the filet and the husband has the kona crusted ribeye.  We'll vary on what we have for dessert.  I love the Bohemian there - it's an awesome champagne drink that has raspberries in it.  It's almost worth a trip to the Grille just for that.  Anyway, our experience here was wonderful.  Our minor quibble is the lobster and crab cake weren't quite as good as we were used to, but everything else was spot on.  As they sometimes do, they came out with a complimentary dessert of a small cheesecake and espresso cake with \"Happy Anniversary\" written on the plate.  I really wish they would open a Capital Grille in the Bay Area.",

Excellent bleu cheese dressing with hunks of bacon to go with it almost fills you up right there.  We both had steaks and both were cooked perfectly. My wife's filet melted in her mouth. My kona crusted NY strip had tons of flavor and very little waste. We both thought the mashed potatoes were really good but were starting to run out of room and we couldn't skip dessert.  The flourless chocolate cake is a winner but I suspect anything you get here will satisfy you.   Chuck, our server, was awesome and the service from everyone all night was perfect.

Probably because it was way past the early bird witching hour. Or perhaps because there were three other fantastic steak places in a .5 mile radius *cough* Delmontico *cough*.  The worst part? As I sit here writing this review I can't even remember exactly what I ordered - some steak..knowing me it was a fatty of a rib eye. A good 50 dollar piece of meat should leave an impression on me and not just on my wallet.   So - come here if you like consistency (its a chain) not nothing really special.",

The entire evening was perfect. We had an amazing view and the best waiter we have ever had. We had Frankie for our server. He was engaging but not intrusive. He made great recommendations which we went with. Most of the table had the Delmonico rib eye. We had calamari, asparagus, potatoes. We split three deserts. Everything was great. The steaks were so good we are still talking about it. Thanks for a wonderful experience. We were told they have a location in Beverly Hills which we will try.",

Starting with the reservationist, Mallory, the friendly greeting from the maitre d' and the great Strip view from our table it was an outstanding experience. The service we received from our server Alex was exceptional. He asked about our time schedule and made sure we were on time for our show at The Wynn. We both decided on steak which is not always the case. I had the Delmonico while my wife had the sliced filet prepared with mushrooms and onions; both were delicious. The wedge salad was really nice as their blue cheese dressing is not overpowering. We tried the twice baked potato for the first time and enjoyed it.  It's tough to beat the combination of view, service and food that this Capital Grille provides. Highly recommended.",

After telling them that we were in town for our honeymoon, they asked us why we were in town, we were seated right next to the window overlooking the Strip. I have a feeling that those tables are left open for honeymooning couples. The food of course is great although some of the entrees may seem a bit small portion wise. But the portion of the side dishes make up for it. Arrive at this place good and hungry if you do not want to waste any food.",

Started off with the bread basket - there were a varieties of breads, I chose the pumpernickel with raisins, it was soft and fresh.    Next, I opted to go with light fare for dinner:  1. Chopped Salad - romaine and iceberg lettuces, corn, asparagus tips, artichoke hearts, tomatoes, crunchy parmesan croutons, all served with a side of house made ranch...Fresh and lovely. 2. Truffle Fries w/ parmesan - Oh yeah, baby!  In conclusion, I thought my dinner was excellent...Furthermore, if I could ever be tempted out of being a veggie by some delectable piece of meat, I honestly believe that a dry aged steak at The Capital Grille would be a prime candidate.  P.S. Our waiter was a sweetheart.",

She was very attentive and she was so sweet, making our experience a great one.   For an appetizer we decided on the calamari. Maybe it was the jalapenos, but the dish tasted like nachos. LOL. Not like it was a bad thing, it just caught me by surprise. It's pretty spicy, so if you're not a fan of spice, this is your warning.   For my entree, I got the Kona crusted NY Strip. It was MASSIVE. But so delectable. It was a melt-in-your-mouth kind of steak, but unfortunately I wasn't able to finish it because it was so big. :( but it tasted even greater the next day for lunch LOL.   Along with the entrees, my boyfriend and I shared the lobster mac 'n' cheese as a side. SO SO CREAMY, and they were not greedy with the lobster. All the sides are more than big enough for two, so plan accordingly.  \\_()_/    For a cocktail, I decided on the House Cosmo--sweet and tangy, just like how I like it. :)   I see myself coming to Capital Grille for all my special occasion dinners.",

Who cares. I like my meat well done. I don't like the taste of blood swirling in my mouth and any hint of it even if it's at medium well will make me have a hard time swallowing it. I will chew that sucker like gum until i realize this is getting disgusting.   Okay onward...I had the filet mignon with the mash potatoes and it was delicious! Even at well done that thing filet mignon'd. That doesn't make sense, but I just wanted to type that. What I'm saying is, just because m y cut of steak was thoroughly cooked...it did not fall short of what we know of filet mignon to be. It was yumgasmic and my carnivorous side was awoken. Like butter to carve into. Nothing fell short in my meal, except for the key lime pie I opted to try. I never had it. Twas my first time and I swear it tasted literally like a key...squirted with lime...made into a pie. Hence, key lime pie. I don't have anything to compare it to other than I will never eat a key lime pie for as long as I live. I will order a filet mignon rare (gulp) if I had a choice between the two.   With that said...CG did not disappoint (unless you're coming for key lime pie and expecting it to not taste like a key...lime...pie). Service was wonderful! While there are other great steakhouses in and along the boulevard...it's nice that this one isn't tucked into one of the casinos.   A definite potential for steak option along the strip. Certainly recommend! I'd leave the kids at home on this trip, though!  Enjoy!",

I know because that's the name in the card with our bill. She's a delight. Very attentive and genuinely listened to me my very excited husbands upcoming ski trip story. We will definitely recommend this place and dine again in a near future.",

My 2 friends have received their cocktails 15 minutes before. We aren't fancy people but we were in need of a delicious meal and we chose this restaurant. We had eaten at the one in Denver and had the best experience. Amazing service and the food was wonderful. Right now I feel like we are being overlooked since we aren't wearing blue hued plaid in the general business casual attire. We are regular people who just landed in Las Vegas looking for a good meal. I will update my review if and when I receive my food.   Update: Ad I put my phone down, my wine arrived and shortly there after our food. We ordered another round of drinks and enjoyed our delicious food. Our server was very nice and we were in for a nice surprise when he dropped off our check. They comped the 2nd round of drinks. It was a very nice gesture and we appreciate it. Thanks!!",

I have been to CG a couple times before, but this last meal was really spectacular - and thank goodness because we were celebrating my sister's birthday. We took part in the \"Generous Pour\" that was $27 to try 7 different wines. You could try all whites, all reds, a mixture, or every single one of them if you wanted to. It was a great deal and the wines were spectacular and all very unique.  We tried the lobster mac and cheese with all of our steaks. We had someone order the filet mignon, someone order a strip steak and someone else the coffee encrusted bone-in steak and they were all top notch.   Our waiter, Francisco Barrajas, was exceptional and added to our incredible experience. Although we did not order an appetizer, he brought one out to us because our meal was \"taking longer than expected.\" We were not worried, as we were enjoying ourselves, the view and the fabulous wines. Of course the three different steaks we ordered were amazing and Francisco continued to make us feel like we were the only ones in the restaurant.   Also, we were too full for dessert but Francisco still brought out a creme brulee. WE'RE NOT WORTHY. Clearly that was delicious, too.  Exceptional all around and really a fun dining experience.",

I don't normally order sirloin but that is what was on the menu au poivre and I just had to have those wonderful little peppercorns that night.  The cut was fantastic and it was cooked to perfection.  Not a trace of fat to be dissected and just as tender as could be.  I can't remember what it came with just that I liked it.  Sorry, this was several months ago and I'm just writing this now so Yelp will stop suggesting that I do.    The wine list is encyclopedic which does tend to overwhelm me a bit.  I find I like the tablet form of the wine list.  I generally have an idea what I would like and I can just narrow myself down in selections until I come to a more manageable list.  That way I don't have to consult the sommelier and have them realize just how little I know about wine.",

They had what was basically an all you can drink wine for $28 with six types to choose from. It was a great deal (and no one kept track if we had eight pours or more)   They had a gluten free menu and our server Ryan talked me through all the options. He also helped with the specials if I could have them or not.   Most of us had the dry aged New York strip which was moist and flavorful with absolutely no seasonings, it didn't need any! The asparagus was well cooked and the mashed potatoes were super creamy. Decadent and gluten free! They also have gluten free flourless chocolate cake, which was pretty good. I had to scrape off the excess coco powder.   It was my friends birthday and they gave her a cheesecake and a flourless cake, which she accidentally spilled water on and they replaced. So nice!   Our server Ryan kept refilling our wine even after we paid and the service was impeccable all through the evening. When you go ask to sit in Ryan's section!",

Caesar salad was about 4/5 on my scale, however, still very good. Lobster bisque was wonderful.   Our waiter, Raul, suggested the rib eye sandwich...excellent suggestion. This delicious piece of meat topped with melted havarti and caramelized onions melts in your mouth in between two pieces of sourdough garlic bread. I couldn't believe how amazing it was.   My mom ordered the salmon with a fresh salad on the side (I can't remember the menu name). I tried the salmon and it was another melt in your mouth bite!   We will return again soon!!!",

Had the steak and lobster, it was incredible. Filet was great too. We shared a wedge salad and they even split it for us in the kitchen.  Waitress had some bland humor but was very attentive.

A lot of high end restaurants, like Joe's seafood prime steak crab in Vegas, don't like single tables and they treat you like crap. Not at The Capital Grille!  They treated me like I was a VIP. Excellent service from Mike Sabini who gave me his card to request him next time. Who knew you could do that?  Anyway, got a nice table with a view of the strip. The lobster bisque was very nice, good ceaser salad and the filet Oscar style was fantastic.  Although you can find a really good steak elsewhere, The Capital Grille should be in your short list!",

Our waiter, Raul, brought us a bread basket and complimentary  champagne. Service was impeccable! Raul was attentive but allowed us plenty of time to enjoy our meal in privacy. We dined on raw oysters, Delmonico steak for hubby, filets with butter poached lobster tails for me, roasted Brussels  sprouts  to share, and a complimentary dessert. Steaks were perfect and oysters were very fresh. Minor complaint (being picky here) was Brussels sprouts were a bit crunchy for our taste, but spot on with flavor.

    "text": "Let me start out by saying this is one of the best steaks I've ever had!  This place is very bougie, so if you're looking to have a classy time, this is the place!  The interior reminds me of a man cave... like a very manly den back in the 50's!  I really loved that aspect of it.  The entire place is surrounded by huge windows to give you a great view............unless you're on the side facing the construction that's been sitting there for years.  Pretty sure they didn't bank on that happening when they built this place!  If you have an anniversary or other special occasion, they decorate your table all cute! Very romantic ;-)  Our server was amazing.  He was extremely friendly and didn't give off that snooty attitude that you sometimes get at fancy steak restaurants.  He explained the menu in detail, which usually I don't care for, but he was extremely helpful!    I got the seared tenderloin with lobster.  Be aware that the portion size is very small (he informed me this dish was \"for the ladies,\" and when I asked him why he explained that it was on the smaller side, so I was prepared.  Thanks again, helpful server!).  Despite this, I could only eat half of it, which was a huge shame because I couldn't take my leftovers with me :(  This was one of the most delicious meals I've had in my entire life.  My boyfriend's steak was also completely to die for.  We topped that off with the lobster mac and cheese, and oh my gosh- it was a meal to remember.  The only forgettable part about it was the Creme Brulee.  Maybe we got a bad one, but it tasted like dirt and was completely the wrong texture- kind of grainy.  The only part that tasted good was the glaze on the top, so we scraped that part off and left the rest.  We probably should have said something, but I hate doing that so we didn't.  TL;DR I highly recommend Capital Grille and will be back time and time again for a romantic date :)",

Yes, it's a good steakhouse from a chain of good steakhouses, but the Strip has plenty of good steakhouses that don't take 30 minutes to get a ride back to the hotel while limo drivers try to hustle you for a ride. I'd come back if my hotel was closer or if I had a car. The cab situation is a PITA. But the food really is wonderful.",

    "text": "My husband and I jumped at the opportunity to dine here again after having the best steak of our lives at the Troy location in Michigan.  Our go-to is the Porcini Rubbed Delmonico with 12-Year Aged Balsamic.  The flavor wasn't as strong this time around, but the steak was cooked to PERFECTION and still excellent!  We also shared the Lobster Mac n Cheese and OH. MY. GOD.  It is heavenly!  The only thing that was mediocre was the lobster bisque, but I certainly don't come here for that.  I'm seriously day dreaming about the next time I can get my hands on another one of their steaks.  Yum!  Since we had such a heavy meal, we opted for sorbet for dessert.  It was extraordinarily delicious, not like the consistency of your average icy sorbet.  The mango (my fave) and raspberry sorbet was almost like ice cream, super creamy and loaded with flavor.  Our waitress told us they actually make the sorbet in house.  No wonder!",

    "text": "We had our anniversary dinner tonight at Capital Grill. The view was amazing, good ambience, and really good food. The service was a little sub par. Not bad, just not good. Our bill was $185($222 w/tip), the food was on par for that price but the service was on the level of a local casino's steak house. They were very slow refilling my water, it actually sat empty twice. I had a medium end glass of wine ($22) and she didn't ask me if I wanted another until was empty at the end of my meal. I would have liked another, but not when I'm done eating. She rarely checked on us, and she seemed almost put off by having to serve us. She did come around at the end, offering to take our picture and making small talk. Which was nice, but it was at the end of our meal, which was tip time:) There our a lot of very nice restaurants on the strip, it will be a while before we go back there.",

    "text": "With so many great places to eat in this city, it's hard to choose.  We wanted a steak and seafood place where we could stay on track nutritionally, eat a great meal, and not spend as much as a car payment. While it is part of a chain, this place had its own personality worthy of our sole big dinner out on this trip.  More importantly, the food was fantastic!   I ordered the spinach salad with mushrooms and bacon ($11) and the sliced filet with a fig essence Demi glace and tiny onions (mid $40s). I initially had food envy at the sight of the BF's gorgeously seared scallops ($43) but my filet was fantastic.   The vibe is very warm and clubby lit by the soft glow of amber pendant lights. Good for a nice dinner with your sweetie or a group of close groups.  This is Las Vegas and the huge windows revealed the over the top advertising that is everywhere.  That was a little distracting but I'm not sure what can be done.  My boyfriend asked, \"What are you thinking?\" To which I replied, \"Just wondering if that's Donnie Osmond in the top high doing high kicks.\"  Just something to keep in mind if you want a romantic spot to bare your soul.",

And third - the food is fabulous in both presentation and taste. Excellent wine and a great steak!  The Capital Grille is truly one of the finest restaurants in Las Vegas.",

    "text": "First things first, it needs to be said: THIS IS THE BEST FRENCH ONION SOUP ON THE STRIP!  Ooey gooey cheese melting down the sides, piping hot veal broth, salty but sweet from all the caramelized onions resting on the bottom where even MORE cheese awaits! And the tiny little bit that sets it apart from other french onion soups? The baguette they use in the soup stays crispy around the edges the whole crock through. I don't know how.. black magic maybe.. but it's worth my soul. Those crispy little bits that occasionally surprise you give me the motivation to finish the whole thing. And the crock is pretty big. For $10, I've made a meal out of it.  Another worthy mention: The coconut cream pie with bourbon sauce is out of this world. I don't like desserts.. but this tart.. the bottom is chewy like a meringue with coconut, the custard is rich, the fresh whipped cream is decadent and then bourbon sauce?! Really?! I never order desserts, 100% of the time I would rather order an appetizer. This dessert came complimentary and I'm so glad it did. I would come back JUST for this dessert and a cup of their coffee (which is also good).  Other things I've tried:  -Lobster and Crab Cakes. Comes with a corn succotash. I wouldn't order it again, it was kind of fishy to me. -Shrimp Cocktail - Hit or miss. The first time was good, although a little undercooked (the top was mushy). The second time tasted like glue a little bit. Weird. -Bacon and Mushroom Spinach Salad - it was okay. The bacon had that dirty pork taste I'm not fond of and there were too many (raw) mushrooms in the salad. -The burger. Not sure which one it was since the boyfriend ordered it, but it was ground sirloin and surprisingly not that tasty. I'd prefer Bachi Burger any day. The fries were just okay.  They have a nice selection of wines by the glass, a fantastic selection by the bottle and some very delicious hand crafted cocktails.  I recommend sitting at the bar and chatting with one of the many friendly bar tenders, starting with a french onion soup, moving onto the coconut cream pie, and sipping some hot house coffee before you head out.",

    "text": "Let's face it: if there is a better a la carte steakhouse open to non-members in all of North America, I want to know what and where!  The chain holds to consistent standards of excellence, known for their on-premises dry-aged prime cuts and superior service. The Las Vegas location holds up its end of the deal.    The atmosphere is what I'd call \"hunt club\" - dark rich woods, elegant but not overstated decor (in this location the unique feature is painted potraits of famous local entertainers). This location adds a 3rd-story view of the Wynn casino and surrounding neighborhood.   Service is imbeccable - timely, welcoming, classy, attentive, & knowledgable about fine cuisine.  Although the atmosphere is elegant and cuisine very high-end, the staff make you feel right at home (even if you arrived in merely a dressy casual fashion). A special mention is deserved for our waiter David.   Ah, but ultimately it's about the food. Let's start off with the Procuitto-wrapped mozzarella appetizer, served over mildly-oiled toasted crisps with cherry tomatoes and banana peppers. The combo of textures and flavors was on the money. My friend had the steak au pouvre with courvosier sauce. I'm not generally a big pepper steak fan but the tenderness, the rich sauce, and the just-right touch of pepper were a winner. My porcini-rubbed Delmonico may be the most exquisite such cut I've ever had; cooked to a PERFECT medium, melt-in-your-mouth juicy, with a delicate sweetness from the rub. Wow!  I somehow found a way to eat the whole cut.  Desert for me consisted of a homemade DARK chocolate ice cream that was so rich it should have come with bodyguards. A hint of mousse-like quality but clearly ice cream. Exquisite!  Overall: As my buddy Matt put it, an experience for all the senses. If the opportunity arises, I WILL return, as I have to the Captial Grille in Denver. My compliments to the staff, and Bon apetite to you lovers of fine cuisine!",

The view is great and ambience calm very business like dress code is probably business casual but we actually walked in with jeans and flip flops .  Our server, Miri was excellent, very nice and Served us well. She filled our waters constantly and always making sure we were ok.  I ordered the cheeseburger with truffle fries and the hubby ordered the crab/lobster burger. Both of them were heavenly!! Not sure though if it's cause I haven't eaten beef in like 2 +weeks... But I thought he burger was sook good, I only could eat half but it was defineyly juicy, tender and the bacon added tucked undernthe melted cheese added good flavor.  The truffle fries were to die for ... They came out hot and crush topped with Parmesan cheese and truffle oil... Easily one of the best fries I have ever had!! The crab burger came with some tasty tartar sauce and tasted very fresh not too breast. Mostly crab . I also had a bloody Maria which was delicious as well but would have liked to get a olive or two... overall it was a very good meal for a good price ( considering las Vegas drip coffee is almost $4 a cup) a $18 burger is about right ! Yum",

We started with lobster bisque (the best I've ever had) and a roasted beet and goat cheese salad (amazing, we all devoured this). Then we shared a few rib eyes and lobster mac n cheese. Finished off our meal with a delicious coconut cream pie. One was big enough for 5 of us. We were all so satisfied and can't wait to eat here again!",

We also LOVE Phoenix, Chicago, and Colorado Capital Grille, we have never been disappointed at any of the locations. If you're looking for an amazing meal all around this is the place!

Been here for lunch a few years ago (Grille's Signature Cheeseburger, awesome!) and dinner just the other day.  Stoli Doli Aka Pineapple Martini.  I think I could have drank 4 or 5 of these if I had no self control.  Delicious, and they go down easy.  French Onion Soup Sweet onions under melted cheeses.  Rich beef broth. Really good.  Wedge with Bleu Cheese and Smoked Bacon Cool Iceberg Lettuce with thick bacon chunks and grape tomatoes.  Great dressing.  Split it, it would be too much for just one person unless that's all your eating.  I saw some pretty awesome looking lobster tails on Yelp and tried to order one to split.  The waiter said all they have were the small ones poached in butter they serve with the Seared Tenderloin.   They were pretty good and only cost $11.00 each.  Porcini Rubbed Bone-In Ribeye with 15-Year Aged Balsamic Here's where we get a little sideways with dinner.  So this is their signature steak.  My GF and I both didn't like the 15-Year Aged Balsamic.  It pretty much took over the Ribeye and put it in a headlock.  The vinegar was too sweet and overpowered what was a great steak.  I know, just my opinion.  Some folks seem to love it.  My advice, get it on the side if you must.  Our waiter took it back and they took off most of the Balsamic.  It was better, but you could still taste the vinegar.  I'd go with the Bone-In Ribeye - 22 oz next time.  Sides of Au Gratin Potatoes and Sauteed Spinach with Garlic Confit were on point.  No room for dessert.  The Capital Grille rocks.",

The past few years I have celebrated my birthday with friends at The Steakhouse at Circus Circus and, as much as I do love that place, we decided to try someplace different this year. Enter The Capital Grille. This was a slam dunk of a 5 star experience in every way and left me satisfied after an incredible meal and great memories with great friends!   (+) Service was outstanding! Our server for the evening, Mr Mike S., was helpful, attentive, and personable! He provided great details on options and details of different menu items. Actually everybody was great! Our drinks were always refilled in a timely fashion. The hostess was very friendly and engaging. Absolutely great service all across the board! (+) Food was absolutely incredible! I opted for the 24 ounce porterhouse ($55) cooked medium rare and it was sheer perfection! So juicy and tender. One of, if not the best, steak I've ever enjoyed in my life!  Plus I can't say enough good things about that Lobster Mac and Cheese!($19)  It absolutely melts in your mouth and I could have had several more portions easily! lol I cannot wait to have that again! (+) The room is absolutely elegant and cozy with great views of the strip to admire and appreciate! We were fortunate enough to be placed at a corner table where we all enjoyed the striking views of the strip all lit up at night! (+) We were there to celebrate my birthday and they added some really nice touches to the meal, such as confetti on the table and a nice card thanking you for spending the occasion there. It was quite nice. Plus, at the end of the night, they brought me a nice dessert tray with some awesome cheese cake and chocolate souffle! Very rich and very tasty!  This wasn't just a meal, but an experience! I simply loved my time here and am already making plans when we can go back! I cannot recommend experiencing this establishment strongly enough! Just do it!  5 stars.  Actually, one of the easiest 5 stars ever!",

For our main course, one other and myself decided to split a steak and scallops dish, and they were nice enough to split it for us so we didn't have to do any work. The scallops were amazing; very fresh tasting and flavorful and came with a parsnip puree, mushrooms and asparagus. The Gorgonzola and truffle bone in NY was delicious as well, although I could barely taste the truffle, but I didn't mind as the steak was still great and prepared really well. The lobster mac and cheese and parm truffle fries were really good, but I would skip the brussel sprouts. They were just okay. Everyone else enjoyed their meals. We split the coconut creme pie for dessert and that was amazing. I would recommend it 100%.   I knocked off one star because our waiter, Alex, seemed very grumpy and demanded everything from our drinks down to our desserts. I understand that may be his personality and some people may like that, but gauge your guests. He was just not polite and put us all off a bit.   Overall, we had a good time and would come back for the food and ambience. Not so much the service.",

I was thinking of somewhere new to try ...but somewhere nice and The Capital Grille popped up in my head...so we went. We parked in the valet area which was the best choice ever. Pulled up and walked to the elevator which took us straight to the restaurant. I have to say it was extremely beautiful. Great ambiance. We were sat at a table that was near the window which over looked the strip. They started us off with a basket of mixed types of bread and butter and then we had the mozzarella wrapped with prosciutto, tomatoes, basil and balsamic vinaigrette as an appetizer.  My man had the bone in rib eye with a butter glaze and I had the swordfish topped with crab. We shared grilled asparagus and scalloped potatoes.  I know a steak is good for my man when he does not grab the salt and pepper. He said it was delicious, tender and cooked to perfection.  My swordfish and crab was delicious. The swordfish was cooked perfectly. The lemon sauce over it was subtle but flavorful. The crab was piled high on top of the fish. I am so glad I ordered it and I would definitely order it again. The asparagus was grilled just right with a half of a lemon on the side. The potatoes au gratin were amazing, cheesey and the portion was huge. There was so much food we took a huge goodie bag home.  From the food, the service and the ambiance this place was a home run! We will definitely be back! Worth every penny!",

I would also take advantage of the offer valet service next to the Forever 21 entrance.  There is a quick elevator that will take you straight to the 3rd floor and into the restaurant.   I was greeted immediately with a smile and escorted to a window table facing the strip per my special request during my reservation.    I was impressed with the food too.   We ordered the seared salmon, miso sea bass, south African steak, truffle fries, lobster mac and cheese, and a lobster tail served with butter.  My favorite was the south African steak and the miso sea bass.   It was prepared very tendered and you can taste the freshness with every bite.    Our server, Les Forehand, was exceptional.  He made a good recommendation on our entrees and checked on us quite frequently to ensure we are enjoying our celebration.   He also made sure our drinks are always refiled without our request.   Now the most impressive service i received was his talent in taking pictures of us.   The lighting in the restaurant was dimmed, so he knew the pictures would com out dark.  To ensure our pictures had the perfect lighting, Les immediately grabbed his phone so he can use the flashlight while taking our pictures.  I was so impressed with his help and he did a good job capturing good shots for us.  Overall, i was very impressed with my experience.   My husband also had his bachelor party here and he had a private room with exceptional food and experience just like  my experience.   I would highly recommend having a private special event if you want good service and food.  Bon Appetite!!!!!",

Not only is the food exceptionally good (calamari, Porcini Rub steak, wedge salad, truffle fries, brussel sprouts, house bread, dessert, lobster Mac and cheese) but the staff here always goes above and beyond to make our visit special every time. They really cater to local residents of Las Vegas and truly enjoy getting to know their customers. We highly recommend The Capital Grille!",

Got the porcini rubbed ribeye, which was overcooked by a fair amount, I asked medium which is usually plenty pink, but here it was pretty much cooked brown throughout. To their credit they did come around a couple of times and ask if everything was good and I could've complained, but didn't. I was having a nice time and it was fine. Whisky/scotch list was pretty basic as well.",

Seated in the corner window with views of both sides of the strip right next to us. Amazing!  Our server, Raoul was awesome. Kudos to him. He definitely knows how to make you feel welcomed, friendly and personable. Kept saying sit back and relax. Felt treated like family here. He knew a lot about the menu and made great recommendations for us.  Food was superb. Calamari is always a crowd favorite. But the Lobster mac and cheese is a must! Good size chunks of lobster too. So creamy and goes perfect together while eating steak. For our main course, we decided to get the Delmonico ribeye steak. It was enough for us to share being 22 oz. One of the better steaks I've ever had. Portion sizes are great value. I hate going to fancy places and I can't even see our food! Like where is it?? Haha but this wasn't the case.  I'll definitely recommend this place to anybody!",

The meat was nasty, dry, and a waste of money. I didn't even eat it. I have enjoyed steak WAY more at way cheaper places like Cheesecake Factory or Outback. I am a local so I don't care for the whole dining on the strip with the view, but it was a friend's birthday and she chose this place. I also had a small plate of asparagus for $11 and ceasar salad for $11. Overpriced restaurant for what it really is. Not on a budget, but nothing that I had, other than the lobster tail was worth the price. Some of my friends got chicken, which they all complained was too dry. The only things that were actually good were the mashed potatoes and mac n cheese.  What completely ruined my dining experience to the point that I gave it 1 star was because of how cold it was in there. My whole group of 9 were complaining about how hard the AC was hitting us the whole night. Yes it was that bad.",

They placed us at the best table in the house literally hanging over the Vegas strip. Started out with an ice cold Martini that was mixed perfectly. As for our order, we had a house salad, wedge salad, Wild Mushroom mix, Chilean Sea Bass, and a Rib-Eye with a balsamic reduction. What can you write about salads? Hmmmm? They were good but were your standard fare. The mushrooms were great. Quite a large order and I love mushrooms so this can make me a happy boy. My steak was a perfectly cooked medium rare. Great prime beef. We had a problem with the Chilean Sea Bass. It was raw in the middle and had to be sent back. At the prices they charge, they need to hit perfect execution every time if you want five stars. I understand there are instances but I call it like I see it. They did correct the fish and all in all a pretty fine meal.  Cheers to all",

The fish itself was a little dry and boring but when sprinkled with the broth is quite delicious despite how I usually do not like soy sauce.  I shared/split my portion with another associate at the table so I also got to try bone-in rib eye steak which was ver juicy.  The steak was requested as medium rare though maybe half of it was cooked rare instead.  We also had asparagus and soy glazed bacon brussels sprouts.  The asparagus was cooked to the point where too many stalks were blackened, dry, and crunchy while the sprouts were glazed too intensely with soy sauce in my opinion.  Desserts were as expected.  In summary, for the price one would expect all of the dishes to be cooked and taste properly AND, our waiter stole the electronic drink menu/tablet plaything from me.",

Easy choice due to my last review details of class, extraordinary service, food quality and reservations.  2.  Last night, I was in \"trouble\" because we were taking my son out for dinner for his 18th birthday with his friends. I was feeling a bit generous as he is doing so well in school, his friends are great and so, we wanted to have something special.  3.  Special meant, on the strip, good view, great food, feeling pampered and special.  4.  I made reservations at the last minute, 5:00 pm for a 7:30 pm dinner. Why, because i needed class and where we were going wasn't special enough.  5.  I asked for a window seat due to my son's birthday. They did not promise, however, they said they would request.  6.  Here is what we got...  a.  Best table seat in the whole restaurant. Right in the corner with great views. b.  A birthday card with a nice touch, a wax seal envelope, that wished my kid happy birthday and thanking him for dining with them. c.  The service was beyond extraordinary. It was simply staggeringly special. d.  The food, was beyond really good. It was just right.  We had the Delmonico (bone in rib eye), the Porcini rubbed Delmonico (dry rubbed porcini finished with a 12 year balsamic dressing), sliced Filet Migon, Calamari, and Prosciutto wrapped Mozzarella as starters.  For sides, we had the Lobster Mac and Cheese, the Au Gratin Potatoes, Truffle Fries and Creamed Spinach.  I guess, when all said and done, the best review is from the young men...\"Best Steak ever\".  OK, while we know that they haven't been to all the best steak places in LV to qualify, the fact is that it was great and I have been to many  steak places in the world.  People, when you are looking for an experience, this is the place.  Kudos to Tiffany for taking my reservation and making it special.  Kudos for Eric who helped us make decisions, and made for a great evening.  Thanks Capital Grill for making our night so great.  It doesn't get better in my book and Happy Birthday son!",

The entrance is pretty grand with an elevator taking you up and beautiful pictures of people like Dorothy Dandridge and Frank Sinatra adorning the walls.  We made a reservation and we were immediately seated in the corner where two windows overlooked the Las Vegas area.  It was such a background for the evening.  Our waiter, Erik was the best!! He had a dry sense of humor that our entire table loved!  The majority of our table with went different variations of steak and we order tuna tar tare, calamari, mashed potatoes, brussel sprouts, and lobster mac and cheese to pair with our meat.  EVERYTHING WAS DELICIOUS!! I'm not  a big seafood fan, but the tar tare was something I will remember forever!  The brussel sprouts were prepared the best I have ever had them.  The ambiance combined with the wonderful food and superb service makes this an ideal place for pretty much any occasion.  We stayed for such a long time doing girl chat and we never felt rushed to leave.  Erik was even sweet enough to bring a special congratulatory cheesecake out for our bride to be!  The experience was definitely worth the nice price tag!",

Our server again surprised me at the end with a dessert plate with candle and 'Happy Birthday' written on it. We couldn't believe it when we received the bill and none of this was on it! I can't wait to return here next time we are in Vegas - excellent service and amazing food. Thank you!",

The simple but delicious Stoli Dolis were great and we thoroughly enjoyed our visit. After our meal everyone relented that a solid choice was made. You can't go wrong with any CG location. My only wish is that there were more room in their bar area; it's a little tight.",

    "text": "Definitely a \"Yay! I'm a fan\" kind of restaurant.  The ambiance was classy and romantic plus you get some great views of the strip. Came here on a late Sunday night and my boyfriend and I were completely satisfied with the food and service.  Decided to get some soup and salad before our entrees. My boyfriend got the Wedge with Bleu Cheese and Applewood Smoked Bacon. I got their special of the day...month? Creamy Potato Leek Soup. My waitress described it as an Au Gratin Potatoes in soup form. Anything potatoes I love so this was freakin fantastic!!!! I can't believe I chose that over Lobster Bisque.   I've heard so much about that infamous Lobster Mac n Cheese so I decided to get that as my entree. And yum....it's as good as everyone raved it to be!!!!!! They didn't skim you on the lobster either...4-5 big chunks that just melts in your mouth.  My boyfriend decided to try something different than what he normally goes for. He got the Gorgonzola and Truffle Crusted Filet Mignon with Cabernet Reduction and he really enjoyed it. He even said he would definitely do a repeat of this.  Valet service for Capital Grille is right around the corner from Top Shop and Forever 21. You just take the elevators up and it takes you right there to the restaurant. Very convenient. It's no surprise that we are going to add this to our many of the regular restaurants we will frequent often. Can't wait to be back!!!",

I went there for Three Square's Restaurant Week and the menu they had for it was a really good deal compared to their regular pricing. We sat right next to the window and the view was great. It was the beginning of summer so it was still pretty hot. All the food was phenomenal. I had the New England Clam Chowder,  Bone-In Kona Crusted Dry Aged NY Strip with Shallot Butter (18oz), Sam's Mashed Potatoes and Classic Creme Brulee with Seasonal Berries. Highly suggest the mashed potatoes for the table. They were awesome. The steak didn't seem like it was cooked medium rare like I ordered when I first started but when I got to the middle it was perfect. The steak was delicious too but huge! One of the steaks was not cooked perfectly and they took it back and comped the meal... we weren't looking for any of that to happen but the customer service was amazing.",

I called them at 7:30pm, and they graciously moved us back AND kept our requested strip view table reserved. WTG!  Service was impeccable. The Stoli Doli cocktail  was superb, as was the tenderloin with lobster tails. We also split the spinach bacon salad (great) and a side of grilled asparagus (allright).  For our anniversary, they presented us with a complimentary dessert sampler of cheesecake (Greatness!!!) and a flourless chocolate cake (great). We liked both of those better than the scrumptuous looking but not tasting Coconut pie. The pie was essentially maybe a 1/2\" layer of cream-cheese like consistency coconut flavored filling, not very sweet at all, toppedwith a massive pile of whipped cream and caramel sauce with a wafer thin huge coconut cookie. The toppings and cookie were better than the pie itself we thought. Go with the cheesecake instead.  Great place though! If I had to choose between this place and our \"Go To\" steak house (Del Frisco's), I'd have to give the edge to Del's. The steaks are probably equal, but their desserts, sides, and their similar pineapple infused vodka drink (the V.I.P. Martini) is better and much bigger.  You'll have a great meal here though.",

The salad is large enough for two to share and those two things alone were filling. We did share the steak and lobster meal and glad we did. It was yummy and there was just enough for the two of us without having to cart leftovers home. We did get a complimentary dessert which was exceptional. The flour less chocolate cake was the best chocolate cake I have had anywhere. Would most certainly dine at this location again and again!!",

    "text": "My girlfriend and I were in Vegas this weekend to celebrate our five year anniversary. I was looking for a fancy restaurant for dinner on Saturday night and am really glad that I came across this place!  Service: Their service was exceptional! I originally made reservations online for 5:00. We were running behind schedule so I called an hour before and asked if I could reschedule to 9:00, wasn't a problem at all. We arrived around 15 minutes late and were seated immediately. Our waiter was very friendly and it was obvious that he had a thorough knowledge of their menu; he had great suggestions on some of the better items on their menu. The food came out surprisingly quickly and our waiter checked up on us throughout the night to make sure everything was good.  Ambiance: The restaurant has a modern clean feel to it. It felt like we were seated at the best seat in the whole place, our view was breathtaking! Great view of the strip primarily with the Wynn and Encore on one corner and half the strip on the other.  Food: The hero of any restaurant should always be the food and this place really delivers! Their portion sizes are huge, each dish was perfect for sharing. We started off with fried calamari sauteed with garlic butter and bell peppers. It was so good that we couldn't stop eating it even though we knew we needed to save room for the main course. Great crunch with every bite. We decided to go with their Delmonico ribeye steak for our main course. One of the best steaks I've ever had. The ribeye was juicy and cooked to a perfect medium rare! They cut it in half for us which was awesome for sharing. As a side we had their backed lobster mac and cheese! Amazing! Nice crunchy layer on top with generous portions of lobster. Under the crunch the Mac and cheese was really creamy. Almost liked it more than the streak!  Looking forward to the next time I'm in Vegas so I can have another delicious steak!",

    "text": "It has been a year since I have started coming here, and I was once again treated to some awesome food, delicious drinks, and excellent service.   Good bread at any steakhouse should be a staple. I had to once again hold back on eating too much as to not get full before my actual meal came out. There was an assortment of piping hot breads that came with sweet cream butter that was topped with some salt. I know it is just \"bread\", but I can eat that bread basket for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  Then came the calamari with hot peppers. This was excellent as usual since the calamari was the star of the show. They didn't taste frozen as they were soft and tender, they were coated with a crispy batter that wasn't too thick or heavy, and they had excellent flavor from the peppers. They weren't overly spicy but still had a nice bite. I'm glad they don't come with some type of sauce since, in my opinion, would totally kill the flavor of this awesome appetizer.   Afterwards, my steak came out. I wish I had the words to describe how awesome this steak was, it honestly was one of the best steaks I have had in recent memory. I got the delmonico at a medium-rare, a bone-in ribeye, and I wish I was still eating it as I write this review. It was so juicy, it was so tender, and it had so much flavor. It was cooked perfectly with just the right amount of fat on the edges.   All the accompanying sides that I ordered were a great complimenting addition to my excellent steak. The grilled asparagus was tender and crispy while not being chewy or stringy like asparagus can be. The grilled half lemon that comes with it helps add a bright smokey flavor. The parmesan truffle fries I got were hot, crispy/crunchy and delicious from the first bite to the last. So much so that when I ate the last couple of fries, I almost went into a depressed state of not having any left and actually thought about ordering another order. Then there was the lobster mac and cheese. I have probably eaten this dish over a half dozen times, and it has yet to disappoint. Tender noodles, big chunks of lobster that was in almost in every bite, and a awesome cheese sauce. It was another item that I seriously gave thought to buying a second order of to take home.  My excellent meal was finished with a cheesecake that had fresh berries and a nice caramelized sugar topping. It was a perfect finisher.  The service was top notch as everyone was really friendly. Everything that was ordered came out hot, fresh, and correct. The manager came by to see how everything was doing, and all of the staff in general made my meal very pleasant and memorable.  I like forward to another year of coming here and enjoying impeccable food and service.",

There are many great, celebrity owned, steakhouses in Las Vegas, but I felt we could not go wrong with the standard - Capital Grille - and were not disappointed. Alex, our waiter, was very knowledgeable about food and wine. He recommended the bone-in fillet mignon. Wow, packed with flavor and delicious, especially with sides of lobster mac and cheese, brussel  sprouts, and mashed potatoes. We washed it all down with a bottle of Ghost Block, a fantastic, reasonably-priced Cabernet Sauvignon which our waiter recommended. Bottom Line: Great service, great food and wine, and great atmosphere. What else is there to say?",

I made the reservation for 6:45 however I forgot the time and turned it at 7:00 and they happily seated us which was a nice bonus. Parking was bit of a hassle but after that everything worked out.  I had the salad for starter and it was perfectly dressed and seasoned and my partner ordered the soup which was really good too. They provide a great selection of breads too that went down a treat.  They have a huge winelist which made it somewhat difficult to decide on what wine to get. There is a strong focus on american wines.  For entree I ordered the dry aged porterhouse steak - 24 oz and my partner got the seared sirloin & butter poached lobster., both were cooked perfectly and surprisingly tasty for the price, combine with the lobster mac and cheese and creamed spinach were a great addition to the steak.  We got the desserts which were chef's seasonal fruit sorbet a nice, light ending to any meal..  They bill came to about 200 including two glasses of wine and tip.  Overall this a great restaurant and I would certainly recommend it to people whatever the occasion, be it a birthday party to a business dinner.",

My buddy had the New York well-done; it came out medium rare.  Here's the rule: when a steakhouse can't get a steak right, plus can't get a burger right, it has no right to exist, especially in the steakhouse/burger hub of the west coast.

    "text": "I found this place after searching yelp for steak houses.  We made reservations and arrived on time, but had to wait another 15 minutes before we were seated.  As we walk down the corridor it seemed like a nice and calm place.  As we were escorted to the dining area, we notice the scene became much more lively, in a nice way.  The kitchen is viewable from anywhere you're seated and we sat somewhat in the center.  The kitchen reminds me of the one in Hell's Kitchen! Everything looked really nice; nice ambiance and food presentation.  Now, for the food.  We ordered the Wagyu beef carpaccio, clam chowder, lobster mac 'n' cheese and filet mignon.  Btw, the bread basket was good too...nice variety.  The beef carpaccio was OK...a little too much of the wasabi flavor.  The clam chowder and lobster mac 'n' cheese...MMMmmmm!!  Both were ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS (I also generally a fan of mac 'n' cheese)!!  However, I expected much more lobster in the mac 'n'cheese.  The filet mignon was alright; whatever sauce they plated the filet with was salty.  I asked for the meat to be cooked to Medium and it was still pretty juicy--I've had much better for about half the price.  If I was rating based on the main dish alone I would go with 3 stars.  The view, soup and mac 'n' cheese tipped me over to 4 stars.  Our server was super friendly as well.  It took awhile to get the bill, but it was a busy Saturday night.",

We both did not understand the extremely large awkward menus.   The bread was uninteresting. I ordered the Seared Salmon with avocado, mango and tomato salad. The salmon was cooked well while the seasoning was too simple. I wasn't expecting the dish too be a piece of salmon with a side salad. The mango was pale and not even close to ripe. My friend had the same issue, she was expecting an entree size salad not a side salad with meat in the corner.   The only reason to eat here is because out of all the restaurants in the mall they have the nicest view.",

    "text": "Look no further than The Capital Grille for Las Vegas's most consistent Steak.  I was pretty excited when I was told we would be having dinner at Capitale Grille as part of a recent bachelor party weekend in Vegas. I am a huge devotee of this national chain - and I usually hate national chains - but everything from the service to the incredible Steaks makes Capitale Grille a best-in-class Steakhouse. The interior at Capital Grille exudes class with its dark woods, Tiffany chandeliers, and brass accents. The service has been just as polished as the brass railings on every occasion making this the go to spot for congratulatory dinners.   My current fave appetizer has to be the Steak Tartare with Truffle Deviled Egg although I am easily persuaded to the Smoked Salmon if company insists. As for a salad, it is summertime and the Caprese will never disappoint thanks to that wonderfully salty and loose cheese employed with the vine ripe tomato halves. I should also add that their Burger is seriously solid and features Chopped Sirloin, Smoked Bacon, and Sweet Onion. A must do for any power lunch (or otherwise).  As for Steak of choice? It is tough, The Capital Grille seems to sear an impeccable medium rare on anything and therefore I always find it a chore deciding what to get. My usual choice is their tremendous Bone-In Kona Crusted Dry Aged Sirloin with Shallot Butter because it is simply fantastic and the meat seems to melt as you chew. Another total win is the Snake River Farms Wagyu Filet, but be warned it is incredibly rich and flavorful. A little goes a very long way. The Dry Aged Steak au Poivre with Courvoisier Cream is another wonderful choice and boasts a Sirloin with a black peppercorn kick. All Steak should be enjoyed with an order of Au Gratin Potatoes to share with the table. Topped with potato chips (no, that is not Panko).  For the ladies, I would most certainly give a nod to the Filet Oscar with lump Dungeness Crab that is riddled with an intense Bearnaise sauce or go all in with the Seared Tenderloin with Butter Poached Lobster Tails. You really cannot lose.   I am a gigantic proponent of The Capital Grille's Steak creations and will be back next time I am in Vegas.",

    "text": "Rating: 4.5/5, would look to come back for special occasions   So I've actually been to Capital Grille three times now and each of them has been excellent. The service is great, the food is pricey but great, and all in all it meets everything I would expect from a steakhouse. But let's break it down a bit.   Service is at the level you would expect at a steakhouse, the staff are knowledgeable, polite and friendly. Among the three servers we had, I would most recommend Mike Morris - he gave great service without being overbearing as can be the downfall with some nicer places. He put us at ease with his friendliness and seemed to be very aware of the atmosphere, coming to the table at all the right times. I never felt like we had to wait, yet his service never interrupted our conversation either! Very smooth, and he even offered us some extra bread because he could tell we were enjoying it. The other servers were good also, but I thought his service was at a different level.  As for the food, I honestly don't have too many experiences with steakhouses but I think this has been the only steakhouse that I've been to that I felt was really worth the extra premium. If I'm dropping $50+ per dish I want to really enjoy my meal, and Capital Grille has done that for me on a consistent basis. The steak is always cooked to perfection, juicy and full of flavor. They'll also happily split it for you, which creates just the right portion size for me. I put a high emphasis on value so I've tried Echo & Rig as well, but I just didn't enjoy the steaks there as much as I did here. I would give it another comparison in the future, but I think this place was worth it.   Other items: they seem to do the lobster very well throughout. We've had the lobster both as a main and as a side on the mac & cheese, and both times it was well cooked with a nice meaty flavor. The mac & cheese part of it isn't anything to write home about, but it was good enough overall that I would order it again. The complimentary bread is also great and we normally ask for seconds because that's how much we enjoy it.    The cocktail program I think could use a little bit of work - overall the drinks are solid but could use a little more creativity given the arise in the craft cocktail. I think they're pretty safe overall, small twists on old classics. But perhaps that's an unfair comparison, given the classic steakhouse culture. I would at least like a few more alcohol-forward options though, I personally think it pairs better with food but most of the specialty cocktails are fairly light. We've tried the Sunset Boulevard, the In Fashion, the Blackberry Bourbon Sidecar, the Stoli Doli and the Mojito. I think the In Fashion was probably the best, a bit darker than your typical old fashioned with a nice sweetness. My gf's favorite was the Blackberry Bourbon Sidecar, which is quite nice and well balanced drink. The Stoli Doli is the signature, but while it's smooth and light, it's lacking complexity for me. The Mojito is exactly what you expect and the Sunset Boulevard I would not get again.   My only gripe is during the last time we came to celebrate a birthday. They decorated the table, gave us a card, brought us a small dessert platter.....but then the bill came and there was a $5 charge for the celebration platter. That kind of ruined the experience for me. I think that's a bit ridiculous given it's a big steakhouse and you're already dropping $100+ guaranteed on your meals - a small dessert platter for a special occasion should be complementary, especially if they bring it out to you without asking. Maybe it was a mistake, I should've asked. But when the charge is labeled \"Celebration Platter\", I can't see what else that could possibly mean.",

The whole evening we were tended to with our energized and courteous waiter Frankie. The Stoli Doli cocktail and old fashioned were a great kickoff to the dinner. We opted for the calamari and hot peppers which were light and crispy (the peppers brought a nice tang and spice to the appetizer). Chef surprised us with a nice bruchetta \"amuse bouche\" and shortly after we were presented with our entrees - my husband ordered the recommended Kona rubbed dry age ribeye with a side of au gratin potatoes (it looked delicious so I stole a few bites), but was more than happy with my roasted beet salad! The perfect sweet ending to our evening was the complimentary desserts- espresso flourless chocolate cake that literally melted in your mouth like butter and the light and creamy creme brulee cheesecake with fresh berries! We couldn't have had a more satisfying date night.",

    "text": "Now this is what a Vegas steak and seafood place should look like.  Soaring exterior, interior a mix of Frank Lloyd Wright and Stargate Atlantis, view right down the strip.  Servers in bow ties and very businesslike.  We went for the Mahi mahi and the seared citrus salmon. The sauce on the Mahi had an odd mineral flavor.  Not a flaw just not to my taste.  The salmon, always on the menu, was just to my taste.  The French beans and heirloom tomatoes were great.  And don't fail to look at the back page of the wine book (not just the list inside the menu) for the promotions.  Anything that they bought in volume and is not selling during the downturn is about 50% off.  The Byron Pinot was a bargain at $49.  It's easy to get in at 6:30, but by 8pm, even on a weeknight, it's packed.",

    "text": "Making my rounds of the steakhouses here in Vegas and this is a must stop for me.  There are 2 CG's in the L.A./O.C. area and I thought I'd try the one here in Vegas, since the restaurant is situated to have spectacular views of the strip.  In our case the Wynn and Encore and southward.    The entrance (from the garage) was a ride up in the elevator directly into the elevator.  I had to adjust my eyes a bit because it was dark with dark mahogany furniture.  We had a table by the window and a birthday card with glitterati candy all over the table - here for my birthday.  Love that!  I knew what I wanted to order, since a couple of days before.  I started with the lobster bisque with sherry.  The soup came out piping hot, not too thick and rich with a good amount of lobster strips.  We ordered the shrimp cocktail and forgot that we had until midway into our dinner.  We both ordered the Delmonico steak.  I had my steak prepared medium rare and the hubs had it medium well.  Medium rare the way to go...yumm!  That was a juicy piece with browned fatty corners...mmmm. Tender and tasty.  I knew this steak was taking me down it was 22 ounces! I had a fist size left over which I had later that evening as a snack...yay!  Sam's mashed potatoes was smooth with some chunks of potatoes - gosh, that was creamy rich goodness.  The spinach which I thought was going to be creamed was actually lightly steamed with bacon, I think - the steak was so good that the sides were actually SIDES and not taking over the limelight.  I enjoyed both the mashed potatoes and the spinach.  I would order these again!  I guess our server felt bad about forgetting the shrimp cocktail (and not that I was craving it or anything), so she brought our a cheesecake with berries for my birthday \"cake.\" It had caramelized sugar on top and it was so moist that it just broke apart with your fork.  I don't like cheesecake really, but this was very good.  I didn't have a cocktail because I had been drinking most of the day and my tummy wasn't feeling so hot earlier, so I thought I'd take it easy, so I can have a pleasant rest of the night.  The service was okay and nothing over the top or spectacular.  Staff was attentive enough.  I may visit one of the CG's here in L.A./O.C. At least I know what goodness awaits me.",

Lost count of number of wait staff assigned to our table; granted it was a holiday but it was like musical chairs. The manager was hovering with the remote control to open and close the curtains, which grew to be extremely annoying. We ended up ordering steaks, which were OK but not the best we've had and given the price, frankly we expected better. We went home with leftovers but were shocked to discover we had someone else's!  Doubt we'll be back anytime soon.",

We went to the restaurant and were greeted by a very attentive hostess who immediately began to seat us. We asked if we could sit in the bar and she said yes and seated us in the bar.  the bar was empty as the restaurant had just opened however there was a bartender there preparing for the day. She greeted us very nicely and brought us the menus. She then explained the various items on the menu that we asked about and then took our orders. As she was leaving my wife made a comment to me about my birthday however I did not know the bartender had heard the comment.  The bartender then brought us our wine and appetizer which was incredible. We tried the Ahi Tuna Sashimi which was incredible. After that we had the Capital Grille Burger and truffle fries which was also incredible. For desert we had the flourless chocolate cake and once again it was incredible, especially with a glass of port.  After a great meal the check was delivered to us at which time the bartender said that it was my Birthday and that they recognize this and provided our appetizer and the desert at no charge; what a wonderful thing to hear.   We had a great time, great food, great wine and outstanding service. We will be back.",

Their Clam Chowder was also very good but not the best.  I ordered the Seared Tenderloin with Butter Poached Lobster and my boyfriend ordered the Dry Aged Sirloin steak. My steak and lobster were delicious, but holy cow, my boyfriend's steak was so flavorful! We ordered two sides and barely touched them since we were focusing on our steaks. Make sure not to over order since their sides are big. Each side can serve about four people. Overall, a great dinner overlooking the Las Vegas Strip.  If you eat here, do request a window seat.",

    "text": "We came here as a party of 11 to celebrate my in-law's 25th wedding anniversary.  I was a bit disappointed when they told me we were going to some boring, stale steak restaurant.  You open any magazine in Vegas and you'll see some exotic piece of unicorn meat teetering on top of a fragile stack of vegetables and painstakingly dotted with exotic sauces (is that mango?  Some chive oil?).  All of this is topped with a lacy piece of flair made out of something I'd never heard of or ever suspected was edible.    Ho-hum.  Another steak place.  So I thought I already knew what great steak was.  Capital Grille proved me wrong.  We tried practically every appetizer and side they offered on the menu.  Everything was beyond delicious.  Beyond fresh.  Beyond beautiful.  All meaning I stuffed myself beyond silly.    Happy Appies:    Smoked Salmon Shrimp Cocktail Oysters Proscuitto Wrapped Mozzarella with Tomatoes and Balsamic Glaze Steak Tartare  Shamefully, I admit to having more than one gluttonous bite of each of the above...plus I split a delicious spinach salad with warm bacon dressing.  Main course?  What main course?  Oh yeah, how could I forget?  I had a perfectly prepared Filet Oscar which was a beautifully prepared filet (medium rare of course) stuffed with crab stacked on top of tender asparagus and drizzled with hollandaise.  My husband had the Grille Delmonico which was a mouth-watering rib-eye with an earthy porcini mushroom rub.  Absolutely incredible.  Oh, and lobster mac and cheese and truffled parmesan French fries?  I was in heaven.  As if I had not done enough damage to my insides, then came dessert.  About five or six of them came around the table.  I'm a big chocolate fan and they certainly did their chocolate desserts justice with their chocolate hazelnut cake and their flourless espresso chocolate cake, but their coconut cream pie was to die for.    My only gripe about this place - any nice restaurant I've been to in Vegas has an amazing bar with incredible bartenders.  This place didn't.  My husband's mojito was not muddled correctly and was waaay too sweet as was my lemon-drop martini.  The mojito was not even drinkable.    The bartender didn't apologize when we had to send the mojito back and didn't ask if we wanted something else instead.   I want to knock off one star for the prick, but the rest of the experience was so good it just doesn't seem fair.  Especially since dinner service was stellar and our waitress was friendly, rolled with the punches for our large group, and definitely took care of us.    I would definitely come back to this place - even with all the other enticing restaurant ads in town - Capital Grille taught me that \"classic\" doesn't mean \"boring.\"  They made that lesson pleasant to learn.  But be warned - wear your dessert pants.",

    "text": "What to say about The Capital Grille?? Well for starters I LOVE THE CAPITAL GRILLE!!!!! This is my fourth time coming here and I am continually impressed by this place. I have been to quite a few steak houses ( Boa, Smith & Wollensky, etc.) and this place is by far the best!!!   The decor is wonderful with dark woods, brass fixtures, and huge Tiffany style chandeliers. There is about a 180 degree view of the city from the 3rd floor restaurant. There is a perfect level of jazz being played through out the restaurant. Just loud enough to be heard and drowned out some of the noise but not to loud that you hear it over your own conversation.   We were seated immediately in a very private booth with a nice view of the city. Shortly after our server appeared with a basket of warm, fresh breads and butter. The basket contained what seemed to be  sourdough, sesame and poppy seed rolls, a sweet brown bread, and a flat sesame type flat bread.   For our appetizer we had the Pan Fried Calamari with Hot Cherry Peppers.($13) This is the best calamari I have ever had.( and I have put away a few tons of calamari in my life!!) It comes out in a heaping pile which is then french served to us by our server. We squeeze a little lemon on it and that's all it needs. It is not served with a sauce which it did not need anyway. It is crispy and not chewy, sweet from the cherry peppers but also a little heat from them. Just the perfect amount of flavors that result in it not needing sauce or anything else just to be eaten and enjoyed.  The second course was a Spinach with Warm Bacon Dressing Salad.($9) They split it for the GF and I in the kitchen which was nice. It was a perfect sized salad with the right amount of fresh bacon, hard boiled egg, and red onion. The salad was excellent and it reminded me of the one my great grandma used to make me when I was a kid. Which no other spinach salad has done for me. Another great course.  For our entrees I had the 24 oz. Dry Aged Porterhouse. ($41) It was HUGE and TENDER!!! The New York Side was so good it reminded me of a filet. Then I tasted the filet side which I could only compare to something just melting in your mouth. It was cooked to a perfect Med Rare. It is not served with and sauce nor does it need it. It is just excellent meat served by itself for you to enjoy. The GF had the Kona Crusted Dry Aged Sirloin with Caramelized Shallot Butter. ($40) It was served on a plate topped with the caramelized shallot butter and two shallots. This was quite a large steak as well. The couple bites I had were amazing. You could taste the coffee but also the sweetness from the caramelized shallots. It was also insanely tender. WOW what a wonderful steak. For our sides we ordered The Parmesan Truffle Fries and the Lobster Mac-N-Cheese.  The fries were awesome great truffle flavor and crunchy but not to oily. The lobster mac was Great!! Excellent flavor and lots of large chunks of lobster. It was so rich we couldn't even finish it.   We finished off our meal with their signature coconut cream pie and the flour-less chocolate espresso cake. My GF loved the coconut cream pie. I love coconut cream pie but thought this one was good nothing too special. Now the flour-less chocolate cake on the other hand was the best thing ever. Little hints of espresso and raspberry sauce and a thick chocolaty fudge like consistency. AMAZING!!!   The ONLY bad thing was my GF only ate about 1/4 of her steak so we asked for it to go. You guessed it someone threw it away!!!!! I finally had a reason to give this place 4 stars. Then our server stepped up and said the kitchen was making a new one right now and cooking it to rare so we could finish it off at home and it would come out medium rare!!! WOW that's a save!! 5 stars welcome back.   All I have to say is please try this place. For the size and quality this place is a little cheaper than some of the others in town and I think it is the BEST. Service is always good and the food never disappoints.",

I will say the steak is good and this place would earn 3-4 stars in other cities, but in comparing it to other LV steakhouses, it's a 2.     Other minor dig - it has way too much of an \"expense account\" vibe - definitely not conducive to a fun Vegas evening.",

Our waiter in Vegas provided good suggestions on which entree to pick and paired it with a nice Pinot Noir.  I had the filet oscar and finished off my meal with their signature coconut cream pie dessert.  Yum.  I would rate it five stars, but I am hesitant to rank any corporate franchise that high.  Its close though.",

    "text": "On our December trip to Las Vegas, staying at the Wynn Towers, we decided to have one dinner away from the hotel.  Because the cabs in Vegas are so dirty we wanted to be able to walk to a restaurant.  Since the Capital Grille is directly across the street from the Wynn Towers our choice was easily made.  We have never eaten at a Capital Grille, which , according to the manager Mathew Foody (yes, that is his real last name),  has 50 locations.  The entire meal was wonderful.  We first ordered the Prosciutto wrapped Mozzarella.  It was so good and enhanced with the fresh bread basket.  We also ordered a bottle of wine.  The cab was a 2009 Markham from Napa Valley.  At $48 I thought the price was very reasonable.   After eating this large portioned appetizer we decided to split the dry aged Porterhouse steak.  Again we were not disappointed. Ordering it medium rare the meat melted in your mouth. The creamed spinach side was to die for. We passed on the desert menu and instead had an after dinner drink in their beautiful bar.  Jessica, our waitperson, was the best.   She was very attentive and explained the menu with ease. She made our evening memorable.  Also, the manager kept checking on us to make sure we were thoroghly enjoying our dinner.  Kudos to Capital Grille in Las Vegas.  We will be back.",

Upon arrival, we were greeted with heart confetti and a personalized birthday card for my boyfriend. Our waiter for the night was Jeff and he was more an absolute joy to be around. Throughout the night, he came by to make sure everything was going well; not in an obnoxious way either where some servers tend to do when they continuously check up on you.   Regarding the food we had that night, for our appetizer we chose the Prosciutto Wrapped Mozzarella which was out of the world amazingly good! For our main course, my boyfriend picked one of the Chef's Suggestions, \"Seared Tenderloin with Butter Poached Lobster Tails.\" Now, I know this was delicious because my boyfriend took his sweet time eating it and raving about it, when usually he is the fastest eater I know. I chose to go with the \"Seared Citrus Glazed Salmon.\" I absolutely love salmon and this was probably one of the best ones I have ever had. We also opted to go for the \"Lobster Mac 'N' Cheese\" and I tell you, it was so delicious if we had more space, we probably would have ordered another one!   At the end of our meal, Jeff brought out a platter with two desserts to share (as I had requested when making the reservation) and we also ordered two double shot esspressos to have with our dessert. Overall, this was an absolute great experience and we will without a doubt be back here again for many more occasions to come!",

    "text": "Wife and I stayed at Trump International for the weekend, and had come back from the day's outing. I'd heard of The Capital Grille in DC, and saw this one at the Fashion Show Mall (short walk from our hotel) so I made a reservation online and we went for dinner.  It was a Saturday night. They were busy, but not so much that it diminished the service one bit. From the personal greeting at the podium (I'd entered my last name online for the reservation, and the hostess used it; the person who took us to our table used it; and our waiter addressed us as Mr. and Mrs. when he introduced himself. I thought that was a nice touch.  Our waiter, Ryan, was everything a server should be. Personable, great sense of humor (while being appropriate at all times), completely knowledgeable of the menu, made great recommendations, and he was extremely efficient. There was also a young lady who ensured we never ran out of water. I think that might have been her only job, and she did it very well. (kidding, I'm sure she does other things, I just didn't see them).  We started with the spicy calamari appetizer, and it was delicious. We didn't finish it, because we wanted room for the entrees, but I can tell you it tasted nearly as good the next day warmed up in our NewWave. The variety of peppers really made the calamari flavors stand out, this may be the first time I had calamari without any dipping sauce, and I didn't miss the sauces at all.  I had the double cut lamb rib chops. There are 4 of them, about 12 ounces in total. I ordered them medium rare, and they were cooked perfectly. I love lamb when it's made right, and this was as good as it gets.  My wife had the bone-in ribeye, also medium rare. She loved it, and I had a bite and it was also cooked perfectly.   We had two sides to share, Sam's mashed potatoes (creamy and delicious) and maybe the best sweet corn I've ever had. It was fresh cut from the cob, as kernels were still together, and they mixed in some peppers and the combo of the sweet corn and spicy peppers was amazing. I mixed some in with the mashed potatoes, and it was great, but I found I preferred savoring each separately instead.  We shared the chocolate cake for dessert. It was good, can't say we were overly impressed but by then we'd had so much great food it might have just been us.   Prices are high for casual dining (our total with tip was about $270) but well worth it, IMO, for a special night out. The entire dining experience at The Capital Grille in Las Vegas was wonderful - they pamper you, make you feel special, and the food is delicious and the portions are generous.  Oh, one more example of the \"little touches\" they do to make your dinner special - we noticed my napkin was white, but my wife's was black, so she asked Ryan about it. He said they match the color to the clothing their guests are wearing - she had on a black dress, and he said that was so she wouldn't end up with white lint on her dress. Makes sense, but I've never seen that at any other restaurant, no matter how fancy.",

The sides are shared as is customary in most steakhouses and are fresh and flavorful.  Make sure that you order the lobster mac and cheese...outstanding!!

They asked us if we had ever been to capital grille, and found out we were locals and treated us like GOLD! The brown bread was delicious. The blue cheese wedge was excellent. Also my friend wanted a baked potato because she is diabetic, and our server went out of his way to secure one for her from the kitchen! And it was delicious!!! Her filet mignon was outstanding. The silverware (especially the steak knives) is gorgeous. We also asked for a view table at the last minute and your staff accommodated us for that as well within 15 minutes. So we waited at the bar. The bartender was lovely and the bar area is spacious and warm. Also the design of the restaurant and the interior is absolutely stunning. The hostesses that greeted us when we arrived was welcoming and warm. The ladies room was clean and quiet - I love the paper towels (they are elegant). The attention  to detail and customer service in this restaurant is probably one of the best on the strip. One of my favorite things is the restaurant is QUIET (no blaring loud music where I have to scream over my meal at my friend). It was just right! I love CG and will absolutely recommend it every time. Oh did I say our meal was delicious? Ha! Just great 10 out of 10!",

Our server, Jeff, was excellent, always there when we wanted him, but never bugging us.  The food was perfect, done exactly as we wished. The sides are large and meant for sharing.  This will be my new go to place for fine dining in a relaxing atmosphere.",

Came in to a half-busy bar,  ordered a martini and tuna tartare. Tuna was as expected, bar service was pathetic. Asked for a martini, wet (more vermouth), on the rocks. Simple drink for a bartender. Sent the first two back, gave up on the third. The bar always shaken (I'm not James Bond), never remembered the twist I asked for, but were kind enough to put olives in the last one which is close enough to a lemon I guess. Bar manager says \"if you want vermouth that's a gibson\" (wtf?!), then Lol, \"we do it the old fashioned way, we don't add vermouth unless someone asks for it\"...\". Ok... Guy next to me who actually ordered a real gibson was in the same boat. All the service was frenetic, took 20 mins to even get a water (no ice). Awful! Vegas isn't known for great service, but this is a whole different level. Cap Grille, you can do better here, if anything you're known for your service, staff should be able to at least pretend like they know what they're doing!",

Each of our steaks came as we ordered them and the fries were so good.  The waitress (Amy Daniel)was accommodating and went above and beyond.  We had coffee and the flourless chocolate cake for dessert.  The best I every had.  This location is a bit odd to get to being at the end and top floor of the mall area.  You must get the stoli doli.  Delicious pineapple infused vodka!",

    "text": "My husband and I rarely get to treat ourselves out to a night alone without the kids, we decided to celebrated our 8 year anniversary here. Reservations were convenient to make on line and a confirmation email and phone call the day before followed. During the reservation process they asked  us to tell them about ourselves, if it was a special occasion and I was please to see upon our arrival that we were seated immediately and the table was sprinkled with Heart confetti with a personalized note wishing us a happy anniversary, nice extra touch.   We ordered the following :  - PROSCIUTTO WRAPPED MOZZARELLA - This was AMAZING!! - PARMESAN TRUFFLE FRIES - We did not care for these at all. Wish I would have gone with another potato side. - SOY GLAZED BRUSSELS SPROUTS WITH BACON- My husband was reluctant to try Brussel Sprouts but they were delicious and he liked them! - PORCINI RUBBED BONE-IN RIBEYE WITH 15-YEAR AGED BALSAMIC - I ordered this and it was so flavorful and tender, I loved it!!! - BONE IN FILET MIGNON - This was one of the specials so my husband decided to try it. I must say that he was not impressed at all. I tasted the steak was and it was a bit dry and overall the taste was nothing to brag about, nothing special at all! - COCONUT CREAM PIE - WOW, What a way to finish our meal! This was to die for! A soft dump cake like crust filled with yummy coconut cream then topped with whipped cream, drizzled with some type of rum sauce then finished with a thin crispy sugar cookie!  Aside from the nice note at the beginning, the service was NOT \"as gracious as it is attentive\" as stated on their website. Our waiter was subpar, he rattled off the specials and suggested items like it was the thousandth time he had done so that day!  He seemed to be attending to several tables but I could help but notice that he was paying more attention to those tables as they were ordering alcoholic drinks were as my husband and I did not. We had to ask another waiter for steak knives when our food arrived. Too bad because even with the few food items we were not impressed with I would have given them a 4 star but I just could not because of the substaservice.",

    "text": "Obsessed with everything about The Capital Grille!  I typically don't prefer to go to chain restaurants, but it is definitely one of the best steakhouses I've ever been to!  My family and I made dinner reservations at The Capital Grille for New Years Eve.  It turned out to be the perfect place for such an occasion!  The food was out of this world, the ambiance was relaxing and wonderful, and the service was flawless!  The restaurant is located on an upper floor of the Fashion Show mall on the Vegas Strip.  The inside of The Capital Grille is decorated very nicely.  The restaurant has windows from the floor to the ceiling, which offer a great view of the Strip!  Our reservations were for 5:30 p.m.  It was nice because we got to watch the Vegas strip fade from daytime to all lit up and sparkling at night.  The food- oh my goodness.  Everything was divine.  My table started with the fried calamari.  The calamari was served without any dipping sauces.  We were confused at first, but quickly realized why.  The golden calamari was served covered in a hot cherry pepper sauce.  It was amazing!  As my entree, I ordered the Seared Tenderloin with Butter Poached Lobster Tails (Their version of Surf n Turf).  The meal was perfection.  I had my meal with a side of the Lobster Mac n Cheese- one of the best I've ever had- and I pretty much order Lobster Mac n Cheese whenever I see it on a menu!  It was so crispy and flavorful.  My mom ordered the Fresh Maine Lobster.  My sister ordered the chef's suggestion- Bone In Ribeye in a 15-Year Aged Balsamic.  I tried both and they were equally delicious!  We somehow saved room for dessert.  Actually, we did not.  The meal to that point had just been so great that we knew we had to try the last course they had to offer.  Once we heard that the desserts were made in house, we were sold.  We split the Capital Grille Cheesecake with mixed berries.  The cheesecake was made brulee-style, with the crispy sugary top.  It was literally the best piece of cheesecake I've ever had.  As if the food wasn't enough of a selling point, the service was so great.  Our server's name was Juan.  Juan was extremely attentive and friendly.  He provided professional service, but maintained a down to earth disposition.  I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a good steak or seafood dinner in Vegas.  It is pricier than average, but so worth it!",

And with a table of 10 she had her hands full... I am pretty sure by the end of the night she wanted to change her name as we called  for her so much. But she is a pro and everything was hot, well seasoned (thanks to chef) and delivered exactly at the right time!  Let's start with the calamari app and I love that they add hot cherry peppers into the calamari rings and tentacles, which is not for the faint of heart, it's spicy but delicious!  Then an order of the cast iron garlic shrimp which is also delicious! Get extra bread and enjoy the sauce in the pan!!  Then a couple of salads and one was the wedge with blue cheese and smoked bacon to which we ordered extra blue cheese and man did they bring a bucket of cheese! I could have just eaten the cheese! Quality blue is always my favorite. And they do it right!!! The table then enjoyed several of their lobsters which I find is always the best lobster and great quality in Vegas! I had Ahi tuna, which I tend to order a lot, and this was by far the best piece of AHI I had all week and I loved the sauces! The drinks and the desserts were also amazing!! We tried several different items and shared for the table!  Their martini's are an adult size not these mini me cocktails you get for $20 in these restaurants!  Their sides and are also worth mentioning as we enjoyed the truffle fries (a must), the lobster Mac and cheese which is Italian style so beautiful grated park on top of the pasta noodles then infused with lobster pieces and not to be missed the wild mushrooms...oh my!  For dessert we tried the house made desserts which includes the creme brulee, the flourless chocolate espresso cake (super decadent), the warm double chocolate cake and finally the cheesecake.  I can only say I had one bite of the espresso cake and it was amazing!!! So frankly order away and enjoy!! You won't be disappointed!!!",

Getting through Fashion Show to find the entrance was a bit of an adventure, but worth the hassle. We made reservations and there was no delay in seating. The dinner service was a slower pace; the fact that this was a rare date night for my husband I was great, but the fact we had concert tickets afterwards not so much. The atmosphere very much had an old-school vegas/cigar lounge vibe, the wait staff was more mature rather than bubbly and bouncy 20-somethings creating a calm dining experience. I do wish, as it was obvious we were a solo-dining couple (on a date) to have been seated away from large groups as there were plenty available - we didn't ask to be reseated, in hindsight I would have appreciated a quieter meal with my husband.  My husband had a steak, I had fish, both were perfectly cooked. Food was served hot. No complaints.  Definitely recommend.",

While the food was top notch, the service from the staff and particularly our waiter Alex, was just incredible in every aspect.  Alex was very courteous and helpful in describing the menu items, made recommendations on the wine tasting and I think he was generous with the pourings since it was the last day of the promotion and they had some extra wine not on their normal menu.  We were his only table after another party left, so he was very attentive, but his bussers were also awesome.  The resturant week promotion also contributes to <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fthreequare.org&s=d069a0c2a65c34c5e8b4b9cb8b01d5ae437c24ca364d5adb3554bc7c2c8ae3d3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">threequare.org</a> which support local food banks so we got to make a positive contribution for our weekend of debauchery.  On to the food: I started out with the french onion soup, it's in a cup, so it's not a huge portion, but it was delicious.  Other folks got the caesar and wedge, no complaints from anyone on the starters.  I had the kona-crusted sirloin medium rare which I recommend.  It's on a hot plate so it cooks for a little bit.  Hint of coffee, but plenty of flavor in the crust and juicy meat.  The filets also got high marks from the bachelor, and the desserts were pretty good.  I don't like to frequent the same restaurants in Vegas since there's so much great food to try, but when they open a Capital Grille in San Diego, I'll be at the ribbon cutting!",

Their attire was just not appropriate.",

We pick this restaurant based on the recommendation of Yelp and Open table. Reservation was done through Open Table.  The place is elegant with dark wood paneling all around. It is located at the third floor corner of the building fronting the Las Vegas Strip and the view is gorgeous.  My wife and I both ordered the Bone-in Kona Crusted Dry Aged Sirloin and shared a wedge salad. We also ordered fresh creme spinach and Vidalia onion rings for our side.   Overall, the service is very attentive and good. The ambiance is great. The portions are big and more than enough even if you are starving.The steak is comparable with the other good higher end steakhouses. I still prefers Mastro's but will not hesitate to come back nor recommend this place.",

    "text": "I love me some Capital Grille! It's one of the few nice steak house chains my hometown doesn't have, so I look forward to enjoying this Vegas location when visiting. The service here is superior to most other fine dining chains... some of which are hard to top! To make mine and my husband's anniversary special and memorable, they sprinkled little hearts on the white linen table, had glasses of champagne waiting for us, and completed our meal with a complimentary berry cheesecake.  I love when a variety is offered in the bread basket, and you get quite a range of flavors here from raison pumpernickel to chopped olives baked in. So good to carb out on! When on vacation, we like to splurge... so we ordered our very own salads instead of spitting one before the meal. ;-) I had the caprese while my husband went with a caesar. Both were a perfect start! I'm a filet kind of girl AND I'm a lobster kind of girl. So it was an easy choice for me to go with the lobster topped filet medallions. I would get it again in a heartbeat! My husband went with a simple filet, which tasted anything but simple. We split a side of the cheesy au gratin potatoes. They are some of the best I've ever had... and I've had a fair share of cheesy potatoes in my time! As previously mentioned, we enjoyed a piece of thick, New York style cheesecake plated with fresh berries. Though we were stuffed from our meal, it was too good not to finish the entire slice of cake.  Capital Grille... please, please, PLEASE come to St. Louis! I miss you already!",

    "text": "First, the good - the location for us is great, we usually stay at the Venetian or Palazzo, the menu has many options from dry aged steak to and seafood choices, and if you can get seated by the windows, the view is awesome.   Our most recent experience was NOT pleasant.  We made reservation for 7:30pm for Saturday.   We arrived a bit early ~ 7:15pm and were told they could seat us closer to our reservation time.  As we walked by the dining area to the bar, we did notice multiple tables that were open.  We were seated at 7:50 after having two drinks, in itself is no big deal. Everything went fine with ordering, etc, but things went astray when our food arrived.  I had ordered a filet mignon (medium rare) and my wife ordered lamb chops (medium).  My filet was cooked fine, however, my wife's lamb chops were over-cooked AND medium rare.  How they could be cooked differently, I don't know.  We waited for the server to come by but he didn't.  After a few minutes, a person came to fill our water and we asked for her to find our server.  A couple of minutes passed and she found someone else to ask what was the problem.  He noted they were not prepared correctly and took them away.  Isn't it the server's responsibility to come and check if we are satisfied with our food?  During this time, I ate about half my meal while my wife waited for her chops.  The manager (Robert Clark) did come to apologize and asked if he could take my filet and re-heat it so we could eat together.  I also asked him to take the asparagus as they were cold and had gotten wilted.  It took over 15 more minutes before our dinner came to us.  Mr. Clark brought my wife's dinner to insure it met with our expectations, which this time it was prepared as requested.  Their second most popular item should not take so long to be sent out, especially if it is for a client that has been waiting so long. The server brought us our bill and apologized.  At the end of the day what's the big deal?  I ate half my meal believing my wife's would be brought within a few minutes, but instead she waited for her entree about 30 minutes after finishing our salads.  This is suppose to be a quality steakhouse. This was the second time this happened.  The previous time, my Delmonico steak was not prepared property and that too took an inordinate amount of time to get back my entree.  In neither instance did we receive more than an apology, taking the entree off the bill, free dessert, nothing.  High-quality restaurants should not only apologize for their mistakes; they should make up for them.  Last, in comparing a similar price-point establishment we have been to Delmonico's in the Venetian at least a half-dozen times and have NEVER had to send anything back.  I could only say the view won't overcome the service again.",

The prices are comparable but the casino steakhouses just add some great flair and entertainment. Another problem here is Fashion Show Mall has the worst parking situation ever.   Our server Kristen was fantastic and a great time to help out our Capital Grille experience. The Dry Aged Sirloin steak salad is amazing and comes with a great amount of steak. The item is fantastic and I highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for some steak and salad. All and all the Capital Grille is fantastic but visit it when your in Atlanta, Chicago, New York City and party it up at a place like N9NE while in Las Vegas.",

Lots of sweet chunks of lobster and the soup itself was creamy but light, I would've been happy just having that dish. -we got out entree I forgot the names but I think hubby got the ribeye and I got a surf & turf. Sides were mashed potato & asparagus. Steaks were awesome, sides were meh, we didn't finish the potatoes. -for my bday they brought out a sampler with writing (see pics) it was delish. The chocolate cake was very rich so it would be good to share and cheesecake was perfect.  All in all, service was great! Also for u \"winos\" we noticed that if u asked for the wine list they have an expert wine guy come to your table and explain everything u need to know (maybe too much lol).

The rest of their staff is very friendly too! I ordered the Grapefruit Buck cocktail. For all you ginger beer lovers (like myself) think drink is refreshing with a good kick :)  For dinner I ordered the Butternut Squash Bisque. I LOVE BUTTERNUT SQUASH. The soup was very yummy! The Spinach Salad was next. Kind of a typical spinach salad, but it was still good. THEN... I had the Lobster Mac n Cheese. I'm not sure what kind of noodle was used, but it was so delicious!  Everything was worth it, trust me. I hold customer service to a very high standard and The Capital Grille did it for me. I hope to visit again!",

    "text": "Wow, what a meal!  From start to finish a culinary carnival of delectible delights. Service was friendly and attentive, and our needs were always anticipated deftly by our awesome server, Jeff.  Our palatable pilgramage proceeded as follows:  Starters: FRENCH ONION SOUP, CHOPPED SALAD Soup was amazing - rich, satisfying and even though I didn't order it, I wished I had. Although I did stake claim to the melted cheese on the side of the bowl. which peeled off nicely and started the party in my mouth. Salad was good, but not very memorable.  Entrees:  SEARED SIRLOIN WITH BUTTER-POACHED LOBSTER, PORCINNI RUBBED PORTERHOUSE Hubba Hubba Hubba!  After my first bite of the lobster, all I could think was ... \"Why have I never had lobster like this before, and why would anyone ever want to eat it any other way!?\"  Truly a shell-fish shin-dig of buttery goodness.   My date's steak was amazing and so flavorful! Their balsamic reduction is killer, and my man spent the rest of the evening in beef bliss.  Sides: LOBSTER MAC & CHEESE and  SMASHED POTATOES THE best potatoes, evah! Perfectly seasoned and loaded with butter, they didn't need a thing except a delivery device to get them into my mouth ASAP! Thank God for spoons. Seriously spudalicious!  The mac & cheese was super good, though it could have used a bit more actual lobster chunks. Still it was super satisfying, creamy, and catapulted me into glorious cheesey gratification.  Desserts:  RASPBERRY CHEESECAKE and COCONUT CREAM PIE Jeff recommended the Coconut Cream Pie and boy, was he right! The crust tasted like a macaroon, which was a delightful twist.  A massively mouthwatering experience. My man ordered the cheesecake and it was excellent too.   Our evening at The Capital Grille exceeded our expectations on every level. From the wonderful portraits of Sammy, Frank, and Dean (among other Vegas legends) that greet you as you exit the valet elevator, to the classy service and sublime feast.",

    "text": "We were a little skeptical when we read that this restaurant was in the food court of Fashion Island.  Come on.  A food court?  We had visions of walking through the food court to find this restaurant.  It turns out that it has its own private entrance.  This may sound petty to some, but when you are spending a lot of money for a meal, the last thing you want is to be walking by Panda Express on your way in the door.  The restaurant has a lovely view of the Wynn, and we could see the mountains to the north from our booth.    The service and food was outstanding.  I can't say enough good things about our server, Francisco.  He recommended the \"Summer Generous Pour\" --  a flight of eight wines -- three whites and five reds.   A two-ounce pour of each wine is served at different stages of your meal.  We especially liked the Chardonnay, and Francisco was happy to pour us a little more.  My husband drank Scotch.  We made just one order of the wine sampling and found it was plenty for the two of us.  My husband ordered the NY strip with the Gorgonzola and truffle crust with a Cabernet reduction.  It was cooked medium rare to perfection.  I had the Chilean Sea Bass in a tomato and saffron broth.  The fish was flaky and tender.  The broth was deliciously savory without being overpowering.  This dish was a lovely, light, and flavorful dish for those who seek alternatives to steak.  We split a side of creamed spinach, noting the smoky hints of nutmeg.  The consistency was just right, being neither too stiff nor too runny.  We finished the meal with the coconut cream pie.  It was very good but, as a coconut dessert fan, a tad underwhelming.  If you want the bomb coconut dessert in Vegas, have the coconut cake at Mesa Grill.  The service was outstanding at Capital Grill.  We didn't want to be rushed and told Francisco that we wanted to take our time.  Dining to us is an experience that should be savored.  Pun intended.    It pains us to see Americans come in to upscale restaurants, scarf down dinner in 45 minutes, and leave.  If you have a show to go to in Vegas and also want a special dinner, have dinner after the show.  It's a crime to have dinner at a place like Capital Grill and choke down a meal in under an hour.  We will absolutely be back to Capital Grill and recommend it to anyone seeking a special meal where you will be attended to as if you were royalty.",

    "text": "My husband took me here for birthday dinner and we were impressed with their service. We can't comment much on the steak at this time because we couldn't taste the steak this time. But we want to praise them for their great service and professionalism. 4 stars all go to their service. Not 5 star yet because we can't comment on the steak yet.....maybe 5 stars next time after we go back again next time. Please read on for what they have done right below:  We ordered steaks but couldn't really taste it as we ordered our steak medium well, but the steak came out burned outside and rare inside. My husband's was a porterhouse, and mine was a rib-eye. my rib-eye did have a portion that is more like a medium, so I ate that part, at least still better than the steak I had earlier somewhere for lunch. My husband's porterhouse was medium on the edge, and pretty rare when it got closer to the bone. We didn't want to ask for cooking them more as the outside was very burned up (basically black). So we tried to eat the part that is more like a medium, and considered taking the rare part home, But when we got to the pretty rare part, we were still hungry and we think we couldn't handle the bloody taste anymore, it was also hard to chew on with the rareness, so we asked them to grill them some more. I guess at that point, they noticed that the steaks were burned outside and rare inside (they probably wonder why we didn't say anything earlier), and after grilling them some more, the outside got even more black and the inside was not yet medium well. So the manager came out and apologized to us very professionally and sincerely. And they said they would take care of the steaks. We were a bit surprised because we haven't experienced such kind of professionalism in restaurants for quite a long time. And they still continue to serve us sincerely after they said they would take care of the steaks. The server still kept saying happy birthday to me, and they still gave me the complimentary birthday dessert after they said they would pay for our steaks. The dessert tasted good and the presentation was good too. So at the end, there was no bill at all and we could have just walked away without paying anything. They didn't even leave a tab on the table at the end (the black thing that holds the bill when you ask for the check), meaning they are not pressuring us to leave tip. What a good ethics and attitude! In fact, we wanted to tip them even more instead because of all the good business ethics and professional service! We estimated how much the meal would have been if the steaks didn't come out wrong, then we calculate the tip off that amount. I think we gave more than 20% tip. They deserve the tip money though the steaks came out as a mistake. Since there was no tab, we gave the tip directly to the server.   There was no upsetness though the steaks were messed up. We were pleased and we think we would go back again to give it a try again in the future. Again, professionalism and service are very crucial in restaurant business. Of course good food is important too.",

Had the Kona-crusted NY Strip. . . awesome!  And the lobster mac is unbelievable!  One thing that left me with a bit of a question mark.  Our waiter told us that the menu was all grass-fed???  However, no other info out there seems to confirm this.  The steak itself although delicious, did not taste like grass-fed.  No other info from the company itself.  And no other Yelper reviews confirming it... hmmmm?  Maybe someone can confirm for me?  Nonetheless, I'm a fan of the place.  Would be an even bigger fan if I can get the grass-fed option confirmed.",

Upon entering you notice all of the wine lockers; lockers with peoples names on them to store wine for them...I want one!  The hostess was friendly and happy to seat us without reservations, even put us at a window seat.  The view of the Strip and the Wynn is delightful and so pretty at night.  Our servers were attentive and their suggestions were perfection.  We enjoyed the Generous Pour (1/2 of July and all of August) at only $28 (I think) a person.  I didn't even know I liked white wine until I paired it with my calamari.  The hubby and I shared a salad and a bone in filet (rubbed in Kona coffee) and a few side dishes.  There side dishes are fantastic here especially the lobster mac-n-cheese!  I also very much enjoyed the pineapple infused rum.  This place is now in my top 5 and I will be back frequently.",

The first day I ordered the Lobster and Crab Burger on the lunch menu ..it was pretty good for something on the lunch menu ..I love how the flavors blended well with the sauce that was given . Today I came in and Ordered off the lunch menu and the Salmon with the Olives and Couscous was delicious. Of course my first impression of my plate was I thought it was going to be more food surrounding (tomatoes,olives,chopped up asparagus and couscous) the salmon but overall awesome lunch .

    "text": "This restaurant is amazing. I hardly ever give out five stars to a restaurant, but Capital Grille deserves it. Located where all the restaurants are outside Fashion Show Mall and on the second floor is Capital Grille. Upon walking in you are greeted with a very warm welcome from the staff and we were quickly seated. No matter where you get seated in the restaurant there is a nice view of the strip. First and foremost, our server Robert was very attentive and took great care of us. I asked if I could see the alcohol menu and he gave me this neat little tablet to show all the alcohol they had. Unfortunately I couldn't find my favorite alcoholic beverage on there, which is the Midori sour, so I asked Robert what was the closest thing they had to Midori sour. Luckily Robert told me not to worry as he stated they have basically every alcohol in stock.   Now for the food:  We ordered  -Calamari: Extremely yummy and full of flavors, an excellent appetizer.  -Bone in Kona: Prepared perfectly and packed with full of flavor.  -Bone in ribeye steak: Prepared perfectly, couldn't get any better.  -Scallops: Pure yumminess and you can taste the freshness.  -Seared tenderloin with two lobster tails: On the chef specials, HIGHLY recommend.  -Filet Mignon: Prepared perfectly just like all the other steaks, no sauce needed!  -Lobster Mac 'N' Cheese: Just get it. I could eat a bucket of it.  -Roasted Mushrooms: Love mushrooms and putting some on top of your steak just makes it even better.  -Creamed Spinach: TONS of flavor and when paired with your steak and roasted mushrooms, you experience taste to a whole new level.  Overall, Capital Grille is a very well managed restaurant as we had reservations at 7:45 and the place was PACKED yet everything ran smoothly and Robert kept checking on us to make sure if everything came out right.  Pros:  +Staff is very attentive +Steak is prepared just how you requested it +Beautiful view of the strip +Haven't tried the whole menu but everything sounds good +Very nice date spot +Staff is very professional  Cons:  -Place is a bit pricey (but well worth the price) -Place can be a bit hard to find if you're not familiar on where to park as it is on the Strip.",

What a nice touch!   Our table was in a nice quiet corner right by the windows so we got a great view of the strip. Another nice touch!   Food was amazing! We started off with the fried calamari. It was tender and cooked oh so perfectly. I really liked that it came with hot peppers too. For the entree I got the scallops while the rest of the party got various cuts of steak. Sides we got was lobster Mac n' cheese, creamer spinach, and roasted mushrooms. Everything was cooked exceptionally well and loved that all the entrees came out at the same time! The dessert was a great way to end the meal. You get 2 free desserts for your birthday! One was a cheesecake and the other was a chocolate concoction...I can't remember exactly what it was but both tasted great!   Robert was our server and he was great! He was attentive and did a great job explaining the menu. Water was kept full and dirty dishes were cleared away quickly.   It is on the pricey side but definitely worth it! Great place for special occasions, date night, business...anything really!",

We ordered their sliced filet oscar with lump crab, filet mignon, fresh mozerella and basil salad and sweet corn soup. Everything was excellent.  Our server Chuck was the best! He was so efficient and funny! He got my husband a special dessert for his birthday. I can't wait to go back.   Update!! Of course service is still stellar, this time our server was Amy, so awesome, pleasant and efficient. Amy had us try cheesecake and if you are not a cheesecake fan like me, you gotta try their cheesecake!

I've basically narrowed the number of restaurants that I will eat in on the strip to two restaurants: Joe's Stone Crab and Capital Grille. Everyone else seems to have service that just gets worse, not better. Joe's and Capital Grille are the two restaurants that I have eaten in consistently over the past year and that just keep getting better. Yesterday I tried the steak frites at Capital Grille and WOW. I don't think I'll order steak anywhere else since I've had too many disappointing filets lately. The Capital Grille steak frites was just exquisite, and the best part was the delicious homemade steak sauce that came with it. I wish I could buy the sauce by the bottle. Anyway, keep it up Capital Grille.",

When not off hustling the hostess or whatever (quiet Sunday night), he was aloof and clueless on the basics of bar or dinner service. Probably should have mentioned it to manager then, but in no mood to spend another minute there.   Del Frisco's next time for me.",

    "text": "Thank you Matt and the whole The Capital Grille team for making my wife's 40th birthday amazing. The decorations and card on the table started the night off perfect. The meal itself as amazing. I'm not sure how our 15 yo daughter finished the 14oz New York Strip, but she did and she loved every bite. My father in law and myself also had the New York Strip. My wife had the tenderloin and butter poached lobster and my brother in law had the filet oscar.  The mashed potatoes were the best mashed potatoes I've ever had and the lobster Mac n cheese was out of this world.  The whole meal was topped of the dessert plate with Happy Birthday written on it. The creme brulee's cheese cake was so rich and creamy. Our table was right by the window overlooking the Strip.  The whole atmosphere made for an excellent celebration.",

    "text": "A few weeks ago, I had the worst experience I've ever had at a restaurant. Charles was our waiter and from the beginning, it wasn't a good experience. It took him a good five minutes to come to our table, to offer us something to drink. When I ordered, I asked if it was possible to order a kid's size lobster Mac n cheese. I was told I could. When our bill arrived, I noticed we were charged for the regular size Mac n cheese. I couldn't understand why I was given half the portion but charged for the full size. If a smaller portion wasn't an actual option, he could have explained that and I would have gladly ordered the regular size because I always take most of it home anyway. When I questioned Charles, he said it was cheaper that way. So again, I asked why I was charged for a full portion and only given half. He kept trying to change his answer, to make it sound like I didn't pay for something that I didn't get but that's exactly what happened.   In addition, my steak was undercooked and bloody but he took at least 15 minutes to check in with us after we started eating. When we finally asked for our check, I asked him about the temperature of my steak and he offered to put it back on the grill. This was after my friend was finished with his meal because it took so long to check on us.   Our table was neglected, my steak wasn't prepared properly and we were charged for something we didn't receive. Overall, this ruined what should have been a nice dinner.",

    "text": "I've probably been to this Capital Grille well over a 100 times.  I just don't check-in each time.  People often ask \"where is the best steak in Vegas\" and the answer is simple. Capital Grille has one of the best this side of the Mississippi!   We've tried just about everything on the menu and my favorite remains the Kona Crusted New York.  They offer it as a bone-in but can also do it without the bone.  We do work lunches here 2-3x a month. They have great entree salads as well as amazing burgers!  Like crazy good burgers! If you are nice, sometimes they will make a burger for you for dinner if that's your thing.  They offer really good soups and salads.  The French Onion is insane and a meal in itself.  We often order the wedge salad and they split it for us before it comes to the table. It's great.  The apps are amazeballs too!  My personal fav is the lobster crab cakes. No filler in these babies.  There's a great selection of sides up to and including baked potatoes (not on the menu) and lobster mac and cheese. If you have any room left or need a bite of something sweet...get the sampler platter and take it home for later. It's a WOW dessert!  The restaurant is located to the front of the Fashion Show mall across from the Wynn. Parking at the mall is free (if you don't valet) so this is a huge plus considering all the local hotels now charge for parking (yuck)!  The staff is friendly and they don't have much turnover. We've had the same waiters/waitress for some time.  I remember going in after my Mom had passed.  The waitress actually cried when she'd heard Mom was gone. How sweet is that?  Cap Grille is doing it right! They are consistent which is a rarity these days.  Steaks are cooked exactly as you ask. They take our reservations and try to always give us a table with a view.  We have the \"family\" table.    Holy crap! I almost forgot the very best thing here!!! If you drink, get yourself and everyone else at your table a \"stoli-doli\"! It's a pineapple infused vodka drink shaken at the table and served in a chilled martini glass.  Careful as these babies go down like water.    See you this week Cap Grill! We have a lunch and a dinner this week alone :-)",

We all ordered steak(different selections) and all were cook to order, which is impressive...10 steaks to all come out at the same time. We all order different appetizers lobster Mac, potatoes, French onion soup were all good nothing mind blowing but the  Prosciutto Wrapped Mozzarella was very good.  But the service I'd give 5 stars.  Our server Chad(I think(hope)was his name was awesome. Just attentive enough, friendly, funny and very helpful.  The rest of the servers we're also spot on the whole night.... Waters were kept full, napkins were quickly refolding if anyone left the table. They brought my a card that had wished me a happy birthday and complementary dessert and Chad got hold table to sing me happy birthday. Good solid steakhouse I would definitely recommend.",

SERVICE: was okay, we sat in the lounge area and had the 2 bartenders who really werent that busy, maybe 2-3 other patrons in lounge area, but we could definitely have been better cared for especially for being a steak house, service should always be a little above a typical establishment...also the bartender was a little pompous and arrogant.  AMBIANCE: was Beautiful! they have very tall windows (3 stories tall?) around a majority of the restaurant over looking the Strip (you have to sit by the window to see out to the strip). Had open table arrangement, not much chance if you prefer private/booth seating though.  FOOD: This was probably the Disappointment for me, ordered the Gargonzola & Black Truffle Dry Aged  Ny strip, and a side of Gratin potatoes and Asparagus. The wife had the Wagyu burger and Wedge Salad. Most of our main was really just okay, quality of ingredients seemed to be lacking. Nice presentation but okay flavors except the scalloped potatoes had a nice texture/flavor. For dessert  we ordered the Coconut Cream Pie (One of the Best Desserts Ever!) and Flourless chocolate cake which was good. Overall hit and miss on the food.",

So I bring my friends I called and the hostess stated to arrive before 10. We arrive at 9:47 and she stated that she would check to see if we could be served and seated. Thought this was odd but ok so we walk to the bar because she's taking a while to come back. Anyways this would have made for a bad experience because the hostess was unwelcoming, but my friend asked to speak to the manager.  The dining manager Corey came and said that we could be seated in the dining room. I ordered my staple lollipop lamb chops...I loved the fact that my server accommodated me by asking the chef to prepare them! They are normally only for the bar area ! :)   Lobster Mac was great as usual! We ordered sams mashed potatoes and Brussels sprouts and asparagus! The mashed potatoes are perfect! They are incredibly creamy! A must try! The Brussels sprouts are seasoned so well and charred with a glaze.    Lastly We ordered the cheese cake for dessert ! So good! I really love the fact that the cheesecake is made brulee style.  Will definitely be a staple for me in vegas !!!",

    "text": "This meal began well with an excellent meaty Shrimp Cocktail with zesty Cocktail Sauce.  And we were graciously accommodated with well-cooked Calamari Fritti prepared without Cherry Peppers (since Diane likes nothing spicy at all), and supplied with delectable specially requested Lemon Aioli in addition to Marinara Sauce.  The complimentary Bread Basket was also enjoyable, with lavosh liberally included in it.  After first being startled with a cup of French Onion Soup instead of the large crock I ordered, the understandable mistake (since I ordered so much food) was quickly remedied by our server, and to Diane's delight I ultimately received a vessel of cheesy soup overflowing with rivulets of Havarti Cheese.  The broth was bitter on top but sweet on the bottom.  Although she hates onions, Diane loves to peel off and eat cheese that runs down and congeals on the sides of ceramic containers holding French Onion Soup.  A Wedge Salad slathered with Bleu Cheese Dressing and peppered with fresh tomatoes seemed almost endless, and took over five minutes for me to fully consume.    While the Filet Mignon was well seasoned and prepared medium rare as ordered, its pairing with Butter Poached Lobster was a distinct disappointment, because the lobster was very tough and not at all sweet.  Grilled Asparagus was well cooked but quickly became cold, while sauteed Wild Mushrooms were a welcome accompaniment, and excellent Bearnaise Sauce was complemented by a just as tasty Red Wine Reduction.  A large Baked Potato with chives and chunks of pork belly was nicely seasoned and perfectly cooked, but I would have greatly preferred real bacon pieces instead of the squishy pork belly.   I almost resisted dessert but ultimately failed in my resolve, and compromised on Seasonal Mixed Berries with Vanilla Bean Creme Anglaise.  The mixed berries were fresh but not that sweet.  Overall, service was good, but Diane had to continually ask for water refills.  Usually the culinary experience here has been topnotch from beginning to end.  But this time the tough, tasteless lobster ruined the outing for me--especially for the high Strip prices of over $100 per person (even without alcohol) charged.  So, this time XXX-1/2 stars overall.",

The service was absolutely wonderful and the food was exceptional.  Most people in our party had steaks which they were all happy with.  We also ordered a number of side dishes-- 6 or so for the table, which were great for sharing.  I'm not that into French fries but theirs are something else-- the truffle oil takes them to a whole new world.  The lobster mac was also amazing.  I was one of the few who had fish (sea bass) and another person had the ahi.  Really good as well.  We had some wine (I didn't order it so not sure what) that was good with comparable prices to other nice restaurants.  Their deserts are not to be missed.  The coconut cream pie (not typically my go to) was deslish as was the flourless chocolate cake.",

The Capital Grille is known to be a great steak house but they totally missed the mark; at least when I was there.  Long story short, I ordered the Bone-In Kona Crusted Dry Aged NY Strip \"MEDIUM\" and some parts were good but the majority of it was rare. I sent it back to get it redone and it came in looking burnt. The manager was kind enough to take this steak off the check but it just left a bad taste in my mouth.   Note: If you are a well known upper class steak house, please know how to cook your steaks. The way you cook steak is an art and can make or break even the best tasting steaks.",

    "text": "As Las Vegas locals we visit this Capital Grille location a couple of times a year.   First time we came here, we entered the Fashion Mall from the back entrance, hoping to find a place to eat that was a cut above a mall restaurant. We succeeded. The Capital Grill, located at the front of the mall, has a view of the Strip's Encore and Wynn hotels. I didn't have reservations, Yet, the restaurant was able to accommodate me and my partner despite a rather large party who took up most of the front part of the restaurant.  We also ate there last night for our anniversary and once again they did not disappoint. Starting with the reservationist, Mallory, the friendly greeting from the maitre d' and the great Strip view from our table it was an outstanding experience. The service we received from our server Alex was exceptional. He asked about our time schedule and made sure we were on time for our show at The Wynn. We both decided on steak which is not always the case. I had the Delmonico while my wife had the sliced filet prepared with mushrooms and onions; both were delicious. The wedge salad was really nice as their blue cheese dressing is not overpowering. We tried the Truffle Fries for the first time and enjoyed them. Of course we had the stoli-doli which is their signature drink. Love them.   A while ago we tried the Lobster Mac 'N' Cheese and we found this dish to be amazing. The double-cut lamb chops were delicious and perfectly cooked, too. My wife marveled over this bone-in filet mignon with every bite. When we were first-time Capital Grille patrons, the restaurant sent us a complimentary dessert, which we matched with a dessert wine and a port. However, the coconut cream pie is our favorite dessert.  The wait staff were attentive and provided helpful suggestions on what to order. Those with large appetites will enjoy the steaks. Those with smaller appetites will likely take home a to-go bag. The cocktails were tasty. We were allowed to sip an talk prior to the start of our meal as long as we wanted.   It's tough to beat the combination of view, service and food that this Capital Grille provides. Highly recommended.",

Our Waiter was Charlie and he was a fantastic waiter. He really took care of us.   I had the salmon which was great and cooked to perfection. My wife had the filet oscar and we were shocked as to how much crab meat that put on top of her steak! The steak was completely covered in this huge pile of delicious, sweet crab meat. It was almost a meal by itself! We could have split her dish.   Most reviews mention the lobster Mac and cheese so we got that and yes, it is extremely delicious with big chunks of lobster. If we were to go back we would try something else though.   This place is expensive. It is a steakhouse but even so it is probably $20 per person more than your local steakhouse... but you are on the Las Vegas Strip so that is what you get.   Oh, we also tried the house signature cocktail the stoli doli and it was delicious!",

    "text": "This is not a restaurant I would normally come to, but my boyfriend picked it for our anniversary last week (he somehow always picks steakhouses when I let him choose..)  We arrived at 4pm for our 4.30 reservation (we were also catching a show) and were promptly seated at a table by the window. They had a hand-written card thanking us for choosing them for our anniversary with heart-shaped sequins sprinkled on the table. We had a lovely view of the empty lot next door, which actually proved to be pretty entertaining. There were lots of drunk girls leaving the dayclubs at wynn/encore in their bikinis, and one guy who climbed out the escape hatch of a party bus and consequently had his entire group evicted from the bus. I imagine the people watching is probably less entertaining in the winter.  The food is pretty so-so, what you would expect from a chain steakhouse. I had the Seared Tenderloin with Butter Poached Lobster Tails and my boyfriend had the Dry Aged Sirloin. We also had a side of the Sam's Mashed Potatoes. My steak was more medium than medium-rare, which I have found seems to be a problem at many places; I would probably order it rare in the future. The mashed potatoes were melt-in-your mouth delicious and oh-so buttery. When I ate the leftovers in the morning it tasted like I was eating a stick of butter (to clarify, I think that sounds delicious).   What really put this from a 3-star to a 4-star review was all the little nice things they did for us for our anniversary. In addition to the cards and sequins, they also made us a dessert plate that said \"happy anniversary\" on it and brought out 2 glasses of sparkling wine. The waitress (Anali? Alani? something that started with an A) was friendly and helpful and really helped make our special day special.  Edit: looking back at pictures, I now remember that we also had the steak tartare. I remember thinking it was good at the time, but it apparently wasn't very memorable.",

Its a great place to have a family lunch/ dinner. the staff was so friendly and welcoming; they didn't even make us wait, they sat us right away.  I wish I remembered our servers name but she was phenomenal! she was so attentive and ready to answer any questions we had about menu items. I decided to order the French onion soup (Best I've ever had! I wish I ordered a bowl) and lobster and crab cake sandwich (It was okay), My mother ordered the burger (Delicious), My little sister ordered the filet mignon (Made to perfection), and my father ordered the clam chowder (So good!) and prim rib sandwich (The best meal at the table; wish I ordered this!). Prior to us ordering, however my father was complaining about the cheese on the sandwich, which if you knew my father at all he is extremely picky! So our waitress decided to bring him out a sample of the cheese that would come on the sandwich, lo and behold.. he loved it! I thank her for actually getting him to try something new! Once we were all done with our meals our server decided to bring us a complimentary cheesecake. this cheesecake was the most creamiest cheesecake I've ever eaten, words cannot even explain how delicious it was!   Overall I give this restaurant a 5 star rating! I give it 5 stars because of its excellence, quality, cleanliness, and amazing staff! I will definitely be coming back on my next Vegas trip!",

The host sat us in a area that was to cold for my mother and they accommodated us right away. The waitress was able to take our order and answer all our crazy questions about the menu.  The food came and it was great!  Hands down the best Calamari I've had in a extremely long time!! The chilies in the mix are excellent and taste great!  The Onion soup is enough for 3 to 4 people and was super yummy and not as salty as it has been for me in the past. Now, our main course, our steaks were ordered medium rare and by golly I really like my steak mooing at me- but our steaks came out medium :( -- we were so sad because the meat, seasoning, sauce was great, but man- so, we called our waitress over, I had told her the issue and she was eager to see if the steaks were both medium to show the chef we cut the steaks from the bone to show her. Appalled at the fact that they were cooked incorrectly she quickly headed to the kitchen and the head chef began to re cook our steaks : while we waited our Mac and Lobster side came which was also amazing and had the Largest chunks of lobster I've seen in a Mac and lobster dish! The Maitre D came over and asked us if we would like a glass of wine while we waited but we did not drink and he us over another Mac and Lobster :) ! We were able to receive the steaks the way we wanted them and they were epic!  Desert we also ordered and boom it was great! Overall excellent experience even with the steak hiccup!",

I had given several very subtle hints that I wanted to try the one that just opened here in Cleveland so I was thrilled when he found one in Vegas and said we were going! Our reservation was for 7 and although we were a couple minutes late, we were seated right away. Our server, Mike M., came over and greeted us immediately. He told us some of his recommendations and brought us over a drink menu. I got a glass of cab and my boyfriend got the In Fashion which is their take on an Old Fashioned. Cab was great. His drink was a little strong but I guess that's never really a bad thing haha. For our entrees we ordered the filet mignon, dry-aged strip steak and au gratin potatoes. Food came out quickly. I ordered my steak medium but it was cooked closer to medium well. It wasn't too bad though so I didn't say anything. The steaks were flavorful and tender. The potatoes were amazing!! I really wanted to try the Brussels but the bf doesn't eat them and it would have been too much for just me so I'll get those next time when I'm not stuffed from two days of Vegas eating. Sad there was no room for dessert either. Service was top notch. Everyone from the hostess to the busser/food runner was friendly and Mike was amazing! Very knowledgeable about the drinks and wine selection and made great conversation. Overall great experience. Can't wait to check out the one in Cleveland!",

    "text": "Came here for the first time for mine and my girlfriends anniversary and let me say that it was one of the best dinner experiences we've ever had. Our server,who's name I cannot remember but was a rugby player, was extremely knowledgable on both the menu and drinks. Describing in detail about all ingredients and how how everything is prepared along with why they pair well together. He was very attentive and really knew how speak with us and the guest without making it awkward or bothersome. He really made our experience amazing! Sorry I don't remember his name because he really deserves recognition but I'm pretty sure he's the only rugby player there. They also set up our table with some nice decoration and wrote us a handwritten anniversary card.  The food was on a whole other level of delicious. We started off with the Lobster and crab cakes and the calamari. Both the best I've ever had! The calamari was nice and spicy but not to the point where it was uncomfortable to eat. The lobster/crab cakes tasted fresh and where nicely sized. Our main course was the tenderloins and butter-seared lobster. Best lobster tail I've ever had! The steak was juicy and perfectly cooked to temp. Our side to share was the lobster mac and cheese, let me just say it blew my mind! Not too salty or over cheesed  and had a good amount of lobster portioned in. Our server brought us complimentary dessert with \"happy anniversary\" written on the plate, which was really nice of him. Now I don't usually like cheese cake but this cheese cake was delicious and i loved it!   Overall wonderful food and service! The decor is very upscale and nice with a nice view of the strip!",

There are some great tables available by the windows that offer a nice view of the Strip. The $99 seafood appetizer with lobster and crab was only so-so which is why this isn't a 5 star review. I felt the shellfish was rather bland and the oysters were mushy and lacked body. Also on a platter like that,  something other than shrimp should be offered as a filler. Clams? Conch? Something more exotic.  Otherwise, the steaks we had were perfectly cooked and the desserts were heavenly. Try the flourless chocolate cake or the cheesecake with the brulee top. Both were scrumptious.",

A card was placed on the table wishing a happy birthday.   We were seated at a table with a view of strip. The restaurant was nicely light and the ambience felt perfect for the nice birthday dinner we were about to have.   Our server recommended the calamari. Trust him and trust me, order the calamari.   We ordered the ribeye and filet mignon. Both were cooked perfectly. The sides we ordered was the Brussel sprouts and asparagus. I am not a foodie and going to use words to describe how juicy or wonderfully seasoned everything is, but we were very pleased with our meal and how everything tasted and was prepared.  We ended the night with no dessert order, but they surprised the birthday guest with a small bit of cake and candle.  Exceptional place with great service and food. By the way, there is easy parking on fashion drive.",

Great food, except for the appetizer lobster tails which was overcooked, and the cocktail shrimp which were borderline. Still, the Cold Shellfish Platter was a great value, and especially the Beef Tartare was fantastic. Entrees were great as well (scallops and Tomahawk Ribeye).  Would go here again, although at a check of $325 incl tip for two, the above mentioned issues should not have been present.",

While I've never had a steak dinner here, I have had their Signature Cheeseburger, which is outstanding and definitely one of the best burgers out there.  The meat is top-grade and even has some smoked bacon blended into the meat to add that certain something to make it special.  It's topped with Havarti cheese and served on a toasted, rich and slightly sweet onion roll.  The burger is juicy and flavorful and perfect for satisfying a large appetite.  The fries that arrive with it actually do help to clean the palate a bit with it's more subtle flavor.  I also had their Potatoes Au Gratin, which were creamy and delicious.  I enjoyed my experience here and will probably be one of those restaurants I'll always want to come back to since the burger is so good!",

Dry-Aged Porterhouse - perfectly medium rare. 3 of us enjoyed this equally much. Lobster/Crab-stuffed Shrimp - this was a beautiful entree but too rich, would strongly recommend sharing. Spinach salad w/warm bacon dressing, onions, mushrooms - delicious. Lobster mac - found this too crunchy - heavily crusted (not light as panko typically might suggest), has a few lobster lump pieces.

The restaurant was not very busy at the time we visited( we had early dinner so we could catch a show). The poor review is directly attributed to our server Alex.  Alex seemed to be a bit of a cold fish with his presentations of the nightly specials. He did not offer explanations of the different chef recommendations, and he was not engaging. He made it seem as if it was a chore to serve us. I was willing to attribute this to a flat personality until another table of diners arrived. Alex transformed into a totally different person. He really turned on the charm, engaging this party about their likes and dislikes, as well as offering variations on the different preparations.  This experience was disappointing to say the least. I am not sure why Alex was so unwelcoming as we we're visitors and I had not dined at this location before. Hopefully the other locations will have the service that Capital Grille is known for.",

That is the only bad thing I can say about our visit and why it didn't get 5 stars (since I hate waiting).  Our drinks ordered at the bar were free and were taken to our table which had candies all over it and a birthday card with well wishes. Our view was amazing since we were seated in a booth that looked out to the Wynn. Everything was cooked to our liking: buttery steak, mushrooms, and mashed potatoes. Lovely dinner at a classic steak restaurant. I'd return but probably to their LA location for a special occasion since it's a bit pricey.",

    "text": "We had just rolled into Vegas, were staying right next to the Captial Grille (in the Trump) and wanted to get something to eat.  I called and got reservations for an hour later.  It worked out perfectly!  We wandered in, were met by some very friendly staff and grabbed a bottle of wine in the bar while we waited about 10 minutes for our table.    When we sat at our table, the view was amazing!  We got a table with a view of the strip.  It was so great!  With only an hour notice!  I was a HUGE fan of that!  There must have been some mix-up because we sat for about 10 minutes waiting for our waitress to come by.  But, there was this delightful warm bread almost the moment we were seated and that was all I really needed.    The food: I ordered the proscuitto wrapped mozzarella to start.  It was served warm and the mozzarella seemed to take some of the saltiness out of the dish.  I really liked it.  Hubby had crab cakes to start.  For the main, I had the tenderloin and lobster.  It was really flavorful but the lobster didn't really seem necessary.  hubby got the crab stuff shrimp which was also VERY good.  The tartar sauce we SUPER yummy!   For the side, we got the brussel sprouts which tasted overly smokey.  I wouldn't get them again.  Sure it was pricey, but it was smoke-free, quiet and clean.  Beats the noise of a casino in my book.",

I personally ordered a steak with melted gorgonzola cheese with a Cabernet Sauvignon reduction that was simply out-of-this-world. Their salads are incredible. Their bread \"basket\" is amazing. The view and atmosphere are unequalled, perhaps a direct competitor to Charlie Palmers at the 4-Seasons, but Palmer's has no view. Capital Grille overlooks the Las Vegas Blvd (strip). Cocktails prepared correctly, their wine suggestions turned out to be fabulous. The waiter did NOT bust into conversations, he patiently waited his turn to speak. First class. I just reviewed \"Giada\". What a night-and-day difference between the two restaurants. I highly recommend Capital Grille.",

The server actually said this, no really, \"I felt it with my finger.\" What? You put your finger in my soup? I hope he meant the heat generated by the saucer under the cup of  French onion. The soup was very ordinary. My steak was adequate. Hard to import a restaurant, put it in a place like LV, and hope things will work out. Some of the celeb locations here are hot at times, but they do not keep up a consistent delivery of food and service. Best thing all of them have going for themselves is PR, which means hype.",

From the beginning:  - the complimentary shrimp small plate was very tasty, a good start.  - my Caesar salad was nothing special. My wife's felt her wedge was overpowered by the dressing but I thought it was ok. It was large. Consider sharing.  - we both considered seafood but got the delmonico med rare. It was cooked appropriately but was not exceptionally tasty - the asparagus side was burned. It was replaced with a better prepared dish - they brought a complimentary lobster Mac and cheese because we weren't fond of the Caesar salad. Nice. But it was fairly dry.  - a complimentary crime brulee was served for my birthday. I love creme brulee but this was denser than I like.   Again, the servers and manager were very nice and accommodating. But for us the food was only ok.",

As for dessert, the creme brulee and the fresh strawberries Capital Grille are all sure to satisfy your sweet tooth.  Service is excellent. Not as stuffy as I would expect a place like this to be, which I appreciate.  I'd eat here way more often, if only my wallet would allow.",

Was surprised that the server did not notice this, but he didn't complain when she asked how we were all doing. I ordered the special of the night, which was a 10oz ribeye. Server came back to say they were all out of the specials, so there were two other ribeye choices on the menu. I didn't have the menu to look at anymore, so she recommended I order the ribeye that my husband wasn't already getting. It ended up to be a 22oz kona rubbed. I had no idea they would use coffee grounds; I just kept wondering why the surface had the consistency of dirt. I figured it out once I looked it up later. Frankly, I'd rather have a steak from Chili's. My husband was not too happy with his ribeye. I think it had a porcini sauce that he thought was too sweet. Our other friend had a filet, and she had no complaints. We also ordered the lobster Mac n cheese, which we order pretty much anywhere we go that has it; it was just meh. I had the spinach salad, which was also just ok. I have had better at Applebee's. We also had the truffle fries, but they were not very crispy or impressive. Yikes! I feel bad even saying these things, but it's True.   Although we were not impressed at all by the food, we still had a good time. The location is great, and our view was amazing. Service was also good, which is why I still give it two stars.",

    "text": "Capital Grille has always been one of our favorite places to go for a \"dress-up, fancy\" dinner.  We usually save dinners at this location for our birthdays or anniversaries.  As all Capital Grille locations go, the ambiance is outstanding and the decor beautiful.  The Las Vegas location looks over the strip, so if you can get a window seat, it's pretty cool.  You're right across the street from the Wynn and located on the third floor of the Fashion Show Mall. We usually get steaks here, as they are awesome.  The Porcini Rubbed Aged Balsamic Rib Eye is my absolute favorite.  The spinach salad with bacon is in my opinion, the best salad.  You can order lobster as an appetizer and they will pull it out of the shell and cut it up in to bite size pieces, which makes for a very fancy app.  The lobster mac-n-cheese is just awesome.  It's rich and has many pieces of lobster, so highly recommend this as a side dish.  The asparagus is also good. The last couple times we've been to the Capital Grille (2014 and 2013), we've been sat next to tables with children.  In 2013, in fact, when we were seated, we noticed a very large party that was coming in soon...as there was a huge, long table prepared behind us.  When they arrived, there were more children than adults and they were out of control.  This ruined the experience.  Last fall, 2014, when we visited for our anniversary, we were sat, and once again next to children...we asked to be moved, and the next table was also next to a child, which, thank goodness was quiet, but the table location sucked.  We believe that an upscale, fancy, expensive restaurant should have a section where they put people with children so the other people that are dining out and celebrating special dates can have a peaceful meal.  Because of these last two experiences, we've decided that we will no longer go to the Capital Grille for special celebrations...this is disappointing, as the food is always good.",

While the steak (Delmonico 22oz)  was amazing as usual, what really stood out were the appetizers of Prosciutto Wrapped Mozzarella with Vine Ripe Tomatoes, the Lobster/Crab Cakes  and the side of Lobster Mac 'N' Cheese. I would go back for these items alone.    The only problem we encountered was the empty hostess station when we arrived. Even though we made a reservation, between waiting for the hostess to appear and sitting at the bar, we had to wait about 15min for them to \"put our table together\". I was disappointed to see that when we were finally taken to the dinning room we had been seated at a booth. For a group of four guys, this isn't an ideal seating situation.   In the end, the food and wine made it easy to overlook the poor service at the hostess station. If you're out there celebrating an important event, I recommend The Capital Grille.",

I got to the dinner late and had been seated for no less than 15 minutes before I was able to flag down a waiter to get a drink. Then when I attempted to place my order the waiter stood there and argued with me about what I ordered (apparently a co-worker was previously in my chair and moved to another table so I could take her spot). Regardless, I'm perfectly capable of remembering whether or not I placed an order. As such, I do not appreciate being argued with by my waiter and finally told that I would get what he thought I ordered and could deal with it then. When I finally got my well done New York Strip (yes I'm one of those people who doesn't enjoy my meat bleeding on my plate, terrible I know), I find that it is medium rare. Well done and medium rare are not the same thing... not even a little.. there are like 2 steps in between them. My steak was taken back and came back medium... still not well done like I originally ordered. Needless to say I will not be returning.",

It's a simple drink with not a lot of bite, but don't be fooled into thinking it's not potent. The concoction is allowed to sit for over a week in a large glass jar, which makes the vodka taste sweet and smooth. And it goes down easy, maybe a little too easy.  After hanging out at the bar for a bit our party of four got a table in the dining room. While not my top choice of steakhouses in Las Vegas, The Capital Grille is still a good, dependable place to eat. It's a national chain and we've tried other locations before (in DC). It's got an old-fashioned, buttoned-up steakhouse feel. The kind of place that is perfect for the power lunch crowd.  As for the food, most of what we had was very good. The calamari was excellent and crispy. The lobster and crabcakes had large chunks of both crab and lobster with not much filler. The lobster bisque was a little on the bland side. The chopped salad was by far the worse thing we ate. I could pick leaves and weeds from my back yard, toss them in a dish and it would taste similar to their salad. All the steaks (delmonico, filet, and filet oscar) we had were perfectly cooked and seasoned and very tender. For desert we had the chocolate hazelnut cake, obnoxiously big and large enough for four people to share, it was deliciously chocolatey, sweet and moist.  Our waiter did a solid job the whole night, except when the check arrived. He accidentally rung up another tables order on ours. So our bill was over $100 more than expected. For a restaurant of this caliber and a staff that is this well trained that type of error should never happen. But our waiter was quick to correct it and apologized profusely. Not the best way to end dinner, but it still didn't take away from the fact that the food is very good, although very traditional and conservative.",

They even went the extra mile and made sure that we had a window seat with a view of the Strip. The ambiance was very nice, as expected, as this was our first visit to the Capital Grille location in Vegas.   Service: Jeff was awesome. He was personable and provided everything that we needed and wanted. In addition he was very attentive, as were the other servers who brought out our food.   We ordered:  1. Appetizer: Shrimp cocktail - the shrimp were huge and had a good flavor. This was my second time having these and they did not disappoint.   2. Soup: Lobster Bisque - Good as expected. Had more claw meat than expected but still good. they even brought out extra sherry to tweak it to our liking.   3. Filet Oscar- My husband had this entree. The crab was really good. He said it was really good.   4. A La Carte Side - Creamed Corn- Very good. It was double roasted so there was good flavor and a bit of a crunch. Needed a bit of salt. But as expected. Reminded me of my mom's creamed corn which it is a good thing.  5. Seared Tenderloin with Butter Poached Lobster Tail - This was my entree and it was delicious. The steak was tender and cooked to perfection. The lobster was also tender and was a generous portion.   All and all the experience was amazing and worth the money. They pamper you and show keen attention to detail. I look forward to coming here in the future. Jeff even brought out samples of a drink that was really refreshing. I don't remember the name but the drink had fresh pineapple derivative.",

My server changed out my white napkin for a black one cuz I was wearing black pants and she didn't want lint to get all over me.  I have been to all kinds of establishments and this was the first time I have had this happen to me...5 stars for that alone.  So 2 of us shared a burger and a basket of truffled fries and a mediterranean salad with chicken.  The server had the kitchen split everything for us which was great.  The burger came out on plates that had holes for their sauce container and let me tell you that was one good burger.  This place sure knows how to handle their beef.  And the truffle fries were good but the only back part is I like skinny fries but it was greatr otherwise.  I can't say the same for the chicken in my salad though.  The salad was great but the chicken was dry as h***....which was why I had to take out one star.  I should know by now never order chicken or seafood at a steakhouse.    Definitely will come back again on future visit...the french onion soup looked really good!",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I were in Vegas, and had a really difficult time making a reservation at some of the more hip, interesting, celebrity-chef-run restaurants.  I was in the mood for steak, so we took a chance on the Capital Grille, of which there is a sister location in Boston, where we live.  I wasn't excited about going to a chain restaurant, even an upscale one, but we were pleasantly surprised.  The waitress was friendly and knowledgeable.  She directed me to a delicious red wine, and had no problem at all with my boyfriend and me sharing a couple of appetizers and an entree, an action that might be frowned upon in other more upscale eateries.  They separated the steak in half prior to cooking it, which was unexpected and wonderful, and gave it to us on two different plates without us having to ask.  The appetizers we shared, the Spinach Salad and the Wagyu Beef Carpaccio, were both great, and actually quite a lot of food, in addition to the warm, fresh bread we were given upon ordering drinks.  The star of the meal, the 14 oz. Dry-Aged Sirloin, was cooked to perfection, and the Parmesan Truffle Fries we ordered as a side, were delectable, though we couldn't finish them.  Our only issue, and this was a minor one, was that almost immediately after we were seated, and despite an otherwise pretty empty restaurant, a table of four relatively obnoxious people were seated directly next to us.  This might have been more of an issue if the restaurant had remained quiet, but we must have come at the right time, since in the next hour or so, the restaurant filled up quickly, and the irritating folks next to us were drowned out to some extent.  I would recommend the Capital Grille to anyone.  It's a classy place with a great menu.",

    "text": "4.25 stars  Sooooooooooo delicious!   Tried:  - calamari with hot cherry peppers (If you're a calamari fan, this is for you. Crunchy with a little heat and generous proportions)  - french onion soup -- YES YES YES! If I went back, I would order the crock and not just the measly cup. If your doctor has put you on a low sodium diet, step away (and pass your crock to moi.)  - butter poached lobster (kill me now) and beef tenderloins  [My meal. Lobster was divine. Not one big lobster tail but a few small ones [like 1/3 the size of the palm of my hand]. Meat was good but not amazing.]  - Porcini Rubbed Delmonico with 12-Year Aged Balsamic [aka rib eye, but double check that. Deeeeelicious. And insanely large at 22 oz. Great flavor at medium rare. (it should be a crime to cook up steak above medium rare. A crime!)]  - Kona rubbed Delmonico. [the kona rub was all my stepmom could talk about before we got there. Has a coffee-meets-chocolate sort of flavor. And, while it's a \"rub\" like the porcini, the kona comes off as more of a sauce. Seriously tasty but I'm not sure I could personally down 22 oz. of it. Would get this and the porcini or a seafood dish and share.]  - Asparagus (good - not mushy)  - side of mushrooms (also delicious)  - Au gratin (massive. Didn't try it myself but told it was creamy goodness)  Remember: all the meats are a la carte, so be prepared to get some sides.   Dessert was acceptable but not mind blowing (and thus I shed a single baby tear). We got the cheesecake (fluffy while still being fairly dense) and the berries with cream (tasty). Both were good -- indeed, some loved the cheesecake -- but I would have appreciated some different options (e.g., a chocolate cake that wasn't super dark and dense).   Oh! And the service there is abso-friggin-lutley fantastic. Our dinner party consisted of two men and two women. When the waitress came to take our order she asked us the most genius question: \"Ladies, would you like to order first or last?\"  Is that not awesome! So often I'm expected to go first but, surprise surprise, don't know what I want yet. That simple question let us choose in a seamless way. Fantastic! I only wish I remembered her name! All I know is she loved Garth Brooks! :)   Absolutely would return!",

    "text": "My friend and I were on a 'budget' trip to Vegas (EG: not looking to splurge over $200 per person on dinner) and after some yelp research on his part, we decided to mosey on over here for a nice steak dinner.   We didn't have rezzies and yet they sat us by the floor-to-ceiling wall of windows with a spectacular view of the strip. BALLIN'.   Service was up-to-par and timely. When it came time to inquire about wines, I always like to ask for suggestions and almost without fail, servers will upsell and recommend the two highest priced wines. Initially I decided to pass on the wine as I already was struggling with a (really stiff!) Manhattan but after a couple bites of my steak, I waved another server down (ours was clearly occupied with the next table which had a party of 6, so I didn't want to interrupt her with my inability to make decisions the first go around) who asked if I liked Malbecs. \"ABSOLUTELY\". It was priced well, he mentioned it was one of his favourites and since it was not the most pricey wine on the list, I trusted his recommendation. It was a fabulous pairing.   We ordered french onion soup (cheesy goodness) which had a nice depth of flavour and wasn't overly salty, the lobster bisque special (this went really well with the Manhattans, strangely), and both of us had filet mignon with mine medium-rare.   Great, well-rounded experience.",

At the front desk, the head of the party's name is requested; once at the table, the server addresses the head person by name in an attempt to make the party feel welcome, special, or familiar.  It comes off as lame.   That said, our waiter was as nice as could be. We started with glasses of wine (a nice Malbec and a pinot noir, reasonably priced at around $10-$12). The caesar salad that followed was decent but forgettable. For the main, I got \"sushi grade tuna\" with ginger rice. The tuna was nice and hugely portioned, but I would have preferred it to be sliced before it got to the table.  There's something unpleasantly animalistic about cutting into a giant hunk of raw meat.  As a side, we ordered the truffle oil and parmesan fries, which were fantastic. I had espresso pie and an espresso for dessert. Again, both items were decent but forgettable. When all is said and done, I'm 100% OK with this one trip being my last. Nice experience, satisfactory food...but for a bill of $250 for two people, I would have expected a bit more panache.",

The ambiance is great, service spectacular, prices intimidatingly expensive, mixed with good quality food but just OK flavors.  I had the Kona crusted dry aged steak w/ shallot butter. I couldn't taste too much of the coffee flavor but the steak was fairly tender and the portion was huge. The shallot butter was great but I didn't have nearly enough to give the extra amount of flavor it needed. Call me crazy but this steak was not nearly good enough to stand on its own without the saltiness I'm used to. I even had to ask for au jus and even that was pretty bland. For a $47 steak a la carte I expected more flavor, A LOT more.  On the other hand, the parmesan truffle fries were amazing (as they are at every other place I've had them). The waiter even gave our table of 5 free shots as well as a complimentary dessert trio because it was my friend's birthday. The coconut cream pie that was part of that dessert was so light and fluffy, definitely the star of the night.  What can I say Capital Grille? You have 5 star ambiance/service but 3 star food.",

Average at best, had much better elsewhere for less money.  Atmosphere was pretty nice, service was sub-par/slow, bar was very slow at getting drinks out, food was fast and presented really nice but unfortunately we all ordered med-rare streaks/lamb and all came to the table med/overcooked...would think their line cooks could get the temps right for the price. Sides were good, birthday girl was happy overall which is all that matters as it was for her, but I would not recommend this place for the price nor will I be going back soon.

They have an amazing pineapple infused vodka drink called the Stoli Doli, sounds a bit silly but it's actually quite good. They marinate fresh pineapple and infuse it with Vodka and serve it as a martini. Tasty and not too sweet.  As for the food, it was good, typical steakhouse fair, the seafood tower was very good, albeit pricey at $96 but it worked great for the 6 of us as an appetizer.  The Lobster Bisque was a winner and the chopped salad was good but not great.  I ordered the Filet and it was on par with what a good steakhouse should deliver. For sides we ordered mushrooms, potatoes au gratin, lobster Mac and cheese, and string beans. All sides were good but not home runs. Service was average and they seemed ill prepared for the convention business. They made up for it by bringing us a desert sampler that was tasty but we were already stuffed.  The single biggest complaint is the parking, it's far and walking to the location as I did from my hotel was no simple task.",

I don't remember what the two people I was with ordered but they were not satisfied at all.  Still hungry is what they were with the extremely small portions they were served.  For what they charge at this place you should be able to leave full and completely satisfied and WE DID NOT. The waiter was nice but in an annoying way and her uniform was three sizes to big for her, sorry it was annoying me.  When we went it was quiet because the place was practically empty.

We had reserved the table months before and Megan, a concierge, had decorated the table with happy birthday glittery confetti and a birthday card.  She was very welcoming in greeting us upon our arrival and showing us to our table overlooking the Strip.  This place does have very nice dark wooded decor.  After our stellar arrival, the visit became just average.  I ordered grilled salmon and it was very dry and bland.  I have had better at much less expensive restaurants.  Our server (I don't recall her name) was not very friendly and had an abrasive personality.  She was efficient enough, but not enough to make up for the lackluster food that came at a very high price tag!  I have had better meals at Applebee's for far less money!  In short, don't believe the hype about this place.  Save your money and go somewhere else in Vegas that always delivers well in food quality and service, such as Billy Bob's Steakhouse at Sam's Town!",

The restaurant was crowded & noisy (of course, it's Vegas!).    I ordered the ice berg lettuce wedge with blue cheese dressing... the combination of the two was perfect & I finished the whole thing.  I ordered the aged ribeye medium rare and a side of creamed spinach (I know, I'm so old fashioned).  It was the best steak I have had in a very long time.   I just love a really good-quality steak without the bells & whistles...  sorry, some people might want to rub kona coffee on a good steak but that's just blasphemous.  However, there are exceptions... my friend ordered the porchini-rubbed ribeye with balsamic vinegar and he shared slice w/ me... it was out-of-this world!  That's what I'll order next time.  The creamed spinach was also very good... you can taste the quality ingredients. Not the nasty, frozen, formulaic stuff like Boston Market makes.    Overall, if you are looking for an excellent, high-end steak and meal, try The Capital Grille before you go any of the other high-end steakhouses.",

Considering how many restaurants are all over the strip of Las Vegas - it was quite a sight when the whole place was packed with patrons.  I had a company dinner here so we shared:  -Lobster mac n cheese - I've had better. It would've been nice if the lobster flavor was stronger. I've had better lobster mac n cheese in NY where we would get chunks of lobster. It tasted like ordinary mac n cheese with the lobster absent from the dish -Au Gratin Potatoes - average -Lobster and Crab Cake - served with a sweet corn relish this crabcake was on par with most crab cake but we hardly tasted any lobster -Pan Fried Calamari with Hot Cherry Peppers - the hot cherry peppers was a nice spin to the calamari but the batter was too thick on the calamari -French Green Beans with Shallots and Heirloom Tomatoes - nice but the green beans were a bit stiff -Parmesan Truffle Fries - the skirt fries were overfried and you could hardly taste any truffle - again - i've had better  and I ordered the Porcini Rubbed Delmonico with 12-year Aged Balsamic  - The balsamic really stood out which was the purpose of the dish but i was rather disappointed that without the balsamic  - the steak was rather bland.  Capital Grille is a chain of upscale steak but I would much prefer McCormick and Schmidt over Capital Grille",

    "text": "This was our first venture to The Capital Grille and it was a very enjoyable experience. We normally stay away from the craziness of the Strip since we live in Vegas but after looking at their website and having received a $50 off gift card from American Express we decided to give it a try.  After a little confusion as to where the front entrance was located we were promptly seated in a corner that allowed us a panoramic view of the strip which was beautiful as we were right across from the Wynn.  It was lunch time however they were not very busy, quiet atmosphere and very comfortable. Our server was very attentive and pleasant.   I normally shy away from crab cakes as I have been sorely disappointed in the past--too much breading or too greasy. However our server explained that their Lobster & Crab Cakes are pan seared then baked in the oven and \"wonderful\". And she was correct. I thoroughly enjoyed them  as they had large chucks of both lobster & crab and not just shredded pieces. For my lunch entree I decided on the Main Lobster Salad with Champagne Vinaigrette which was just as enjoyable. The vinaigrette was light and truly accented the taste of the lobster which included large chunks of lobster as well as the claw meat.  I would certainly order both again...   My husband ordered a steak with mashed potatoes- his steak was cooked to order and he very much enjoyed his selection as well.   We are planning on returning as there were several other items that peaked our interest especially on the dinner menu. I am hoping our night time visit is just as relaxing and enjoyable.   My one suggestion would be to check out their on-line menu to have an idea of what you may want as there are seemingly many tasty items to select from.",

I applaud them on their ability to cook a filet well-done on the sides but rare in the center. they had no bernaise or au jus or any sauce for that matter. Caesar salad was a let down as well.   just not good. what can you expect from capital grilles though? after all, it's a steak restaurant in a mall.",

    "text": "My husband and I went here about a week after getting married. We had received a gift card and were excited to use it. We made our reservation for 8:00 because we had tickets to Zumanity at 10:00 thinking 2 hours would be enough time. We arrived on time at 8:00 and were informed that they were running about 10-15 minutes behind. We were asked to sit at the bar. Fine. We went and stood because there were no seats anywhere.   We were proceeded to be ignored by bartenders for at least 10 minutes before my husband got a Jack and ginger and I got a cranberry vodka. Not rocket science to make those drinks. So we were thinking that we'd get our table soon after. Not so. We waited another 20 minutes before being seated. One might expect that waiting 30 minutes for a table would mean we would get a nice table. Again not so. We were seated next to a two large loud groups. And by next to I mean if I stretched too much I would hit one of the ladies at the table next to me.   By the time we were seated, we were starving and knew what we wanted for appetizers but our server quickly disappeared and we did not see him for another 15 minutes. The only thing he did quickly was disappear.   It took us a full 2 hours to eat because the service was so slow. By the time we got out of there it was almost 11:00 and the mall the restaurant is located in was closed.   We missed our show and after attempts to reach management to discuss this experience to no avail, I promised that I would never ever return.   I cannot emphasize enough how horrible the service is here. DO NOT GO UNLESS YOU LIKE TO BE FRUSTRATED and wait.",

When I am in Vegas I like to live it up (even more so when I win) so after a successful day of playing the tables my wife, kids, 2 friends, and I decided to visit one of their favorite restaurants The Capital Grille.  Our friends arrived first and ordered us a couple Stoli Dolis (I believe that is what its called).  I do not usually drink martinis but they were very good!  Great fresh pineapple flavor!  I like to go to The Palm back home but they are not super kid friendly when it comes to the menu but Capital Grille had a few perfect selections for my picky kids (mac and cheese and chicken strips).  Our dinners were great and the service was perfect.  My friend and I decided to go big and get some Louis XIII cognac to end our meal and they brought out a lovely silver serving platter along with the bottle (see my picture I posted).  I really enjoyed my visit to The Capital Grille and cant wait to go again.",

At $45 the steak should be better.  It is dry aged which is good and compared to the price and quality of other steakhouses I have been to in Vegas it is OK.   Their signature steak is the ribeye but I am not really a fan of ribeye steaks due to their fattiness. The sides were excellent along with the French onion soup. The chef prepared a special complementary appetizer of shrimp tempura which was excellent and appreciated.  The ambiance is nice, but bathroom is pretty dirty. This restaurant is owned and operated by mega restaurant corp Darden.  The wine list was extensive and farily priced.  Overall a pretty good value if you would like a formal, nice dinner in this town for a non absurd price.",

    "text": "When we first started going to Capital Grill, I was really blown away by the quality of the food and the care they put into all elements of the dining experience. Not much has changed.  STEAK: We ordered the wrong steaks tonight. It has clearly been a while since we've been here. After consulting with our waiter, we we ordered the ribeye, NOT the porcini rubbed rib eye that we love. I ordered my steak \"medium rare plus\". I like that label. I tried to explain to the waiter that I wanted my steak between medium and medium rare. When the waiter appeared confused, I told him that if the steak wasn't medium, I'd rather they erred on the side of medium rare than medium well. He THEN suggested medium rare plus. I don't eat steak out very often, so that designation may be common knowledge to others. It was new to me. The meat was...a bit off tonight, but I chalk that up to my disappointment at not having the right steak. It was cooked nicely and seasoned well, but I was not a fan of something I tasted in the beef and the sauce that accompanied it.  SIDE DISHES: We had a salad, potatoes au gratin, and green beans. We skipped their delicious calamari and seafood platter. Everything was done well. The potatoes were a tad bit under seasoned, but certainly nothing to worry about.   SERVICE: This is where CG usually shines. But not so much tonight. Good establishments can have an off night, or an off employee. But when you come to a place like this, you are expecting polished service. The host was a Professional (capital P). He was on the phone, dealing with clients, directing the secondary host, and organizing the tables around a large party in the venue. All at the same time.  The bussers were attentive and one woman even came and refolded my husband's napkin while he was away from the table. I like all of those touches. The waiter was well meaning, but not up to CG standards. Little things like drinks being poured in the wrong glasses (not our waiter's fault), missed oppotunities for menu clarification, or knowing the daily specials don't amount to much. Unless a guest is less than excited about her meal.  WHAT HAS CHANGED: I don't know if I have changed or CG has. I never saw Capital Grill as a modern \"old school\" steak house before. I did tonight. The dishes were all very typical and expected, but there was a heaviness and lack of ingenuity to the meal. I know a steakhouse isn't looking to wow its customers with modern twists on old standbys, but the food should be impeccable. Beautifully seasoned and cooked. Even though I was directed to the wrong steak, it should have been the best quality meat and  the steak should have stood up on its own. I wasn't and it didn't.    VALET: It's a mess and they will have you waiting in the heat to pick up your car. Not good, but not CG's fault.  Capital Grill has an old-school feel. The decor is modern and sleek, but the offerings reflect more of what Vegas was than what it is today.  In spite of that, CG is still a solid choice for a delicious meal. A flawed meal a CG is still head and shoulders above many other places in town.   I will be back.",

Great food and great service!  Last night at the bar I was with one of my best girlfriend of 27 years. We both were sitting at the bar. The bartenders never asked if we wanted a drink except when I first got there and wanted water while waiting for my friend. Once she arrived we had to flag down the bartender and he strangely enough only took her drink order and not mine. It was the same experience when I had to get the bartender in order to place my food order. He never asked me after even 30 minutes what I wanted to order. He proceeded to take my order and then not ask my girlfriend what she would like. It was very odd?! Each time our glass was empty they never bothered to ask if we wanted another one. This is a fancy place yet they didn't bother with giving us a cocktail napkin either. They were too busy taking care of groups with all men. We truly felt we were being ignored because we were women. The manager did take care of our bill. He wanted to make it right. Then he stuck his foot in his mouth with a non business like apology. Instead of acknowledging our feelings and saying I hope you give us another chance he chose to say his staff is excellent and didn't intend to ignore us. I was so polite saying his staff was very nice just not attentive at all to us but very attentive to all the men that sat after myself.  I love their food but after the way we were treated will not be going back. Frankly the manager was more concerned with checking bar tickets then taking the time to address our concerns. We had to wait quite some time for him to come over. I get better response from every other manager I've ever dealt with. Including to compliment them on their staff.",

I had the surf and turf and that was cooked perfectly.  My boss enjoyed the Lobster Bisque and loved it.  The wine selection was very complete and our server knew a lot about what we had to choose from.  Other guests ordered The salmon and the bone in filet.  They both were made perfectly!   And to add the perfect touch we did get a complementary birthday plate with chocolates and berries.",

She suggested the perfect wine to complement our meal. We loved it so much we ordered two bottles. She is a True professional and the service was the best we have ever experienced. The only complaint I have is about the guy who brought the bread. He threw the basket and the butter plate on the table. The butter plate bounced into my water glass, which he over filled. We said thank you, but he did not respond. He looked distracted and never spoke or made eye contact. He made us feel very uncomfortable. His name is Jaime according to his name tag. If it weren't for him, our experience would have been flawless.",

    "text": "I was trying to find an email address to send a complaint to the manager. But this is unfortunately not something that is made available on the website. So I guess I'll just have to write it here instead. I visited Las Vegas last year for thanksgiving with two friends and we had a really great dinner at Capital Grille. There was a mixup with the wine but it was all sorted out.  Therefore we also made a reservation a month a head when we returned last week celebrating my birthday and were very excited about it. We came a little early so our table weren't ready - fair enough. But then after waiting 20 min later than we book for we were seated in between the storage room and the restroom in an annex to the bar with televisions running and cellphones ringing off the hook. Not at all the atmosphere we experienced last time or what the prices reflects. The waiter was not bad but was not very attentive probably because we were so remote from the actual dinning hall. Ordering over a month ahead this is unacceptable. Then they need to limit the amount they are taking in instead! Also we again had issues with the wine,but this time it wasn't sorted out. So I had an undrinkable Riesling that I still paid for. When we were paying the waiter was very focused on getting her 15 % tips. I know that tips are almost mandatory in the us in contrary to where we from, and I don't mind paying them. But I still prefer that you still feel like it voluntary. I'm sorry because last year it was really great but this was my last time at capital grille.",

Ask for a window table if you remember because they give you the beat view of the Wynn and the Strip. Gorgonzola N.Y. Strip is my fav.  Their drinks are on point and you'll be warm going into your second one...and I guarantee you'll want a second one...we started in the bar because we came early. Servers are wonderful and willing to get you anything you'd like. This was our date night so we took our time and enjoyed every minute. It's free to park right underneath and you can walk almost anywhere from there...so no parking fees like at the casinos down the Strip!!!",

Good chowder. 4/5  Dry-Aged Sirloin Salad: I was expecting a few slices of steak on a bed of greens but I got a big piece of steak (about 10oz) with a side of greens.  The menu description said it comes with arugula but mine was spinach. It has roasted peppers and mozzarella with olive oil and balsamic dressing. 3.5/5  Grille's Signature Cheeseburger with Truffle Fries: I've been coming to Capital Grille for years now that somehow it doesn't seem so special anymore.  I always get either a steak or a burger with truffle fries.  Shawn asked me why I never told him about CG's burger and truffle fries...oops, sorry! But yes, the beef patty is totally delicious and quite big and the fries...ooohhh...5/5  Flourless Chocolate Espresso Cake: A dense chocolate cake. The espresso emphasizes the chocolate flavor. Try not to inhale if you have a piece of this cake in your mouth, the cocoa powder on top will choke you. 4/5  Creme Brulee: Rich and creamy made with real vanilla beans. The caramelized top isn't one whole piece...more like drops of caramelized sugar but that didn't affect the texture or the taste. 4/5  I like this place and I've never had a bad experience.  They're consistently good (food and service). You can get a view of the Wynn and Encore.  To get here, take the elevator/escalators to the 3rd floor and go outside the Food Court and turn left.  They have private rooms for meetings or group functions. I normally don't have to pay for my meals when I go here.",

Restaurants like this always gives you \"white glove\" service and our server, Amy, did a phenomenal job at providing this service to us. She made suggestions, checked on us frequently, and treated us like the celebrities that we are. STELLAR CUSTOMER SERVICE! From the time we walked in, until the time we walked out.   Never would I visit a Capital Grille without ordering a steak, this time was no different, and the NY Strip was melt in your mouth delicious! The mashed potatoes were creamy and dreamy, just the way I like them. Since we were celebrating my birthday a little early, I ordered the apple crostata and that too was delicious!   A perfect location and meal to celebrate a wonderful Las Vegas trip. If you're celebrating something special or just want to treat yourself, make reservations at the Capital Grille, they won't disappoint!",

We were greeted with smiles from the hostess who showed us to the table, and a gentleman who acknowledged the birthday in the party. Glasses were well polished. Waters and bread baskets were promptly served. There was a unique combination of breads that had a twist to each of the crusts that you don't always see in other restaurants. Francisco was our server, I forgot our bussers name but he was very attentive. We had ordered some cocktails (which we never received/or was offered a menu for, therefore we had to ask to see a menu first) and appetizers. The cocktails were very strong! For instance the gin tonic and the Blackberry Bourbon Sidecar, I personally would have liked a more fruity/friendly cocktail, not so much tasting straight alcohol, or least would have loved to taste more juices/flavored liquor. All the appetizers were delicious! Great flavors and freshness. One of the negatives was that we had to ask twice for butter. When it came to entrees, the party had no complaints. One compliment being that the 22oz. ribeye was the best tasting they've had. My sliced medium filet was was more on the rare side than I would have liked it since there was a decent amount of red in the center (not pink), although I was open to eating it that way. The sides are great sharing sizes! The restaurant kindly served a birthday dessert joined with champagne. Our table had ordered quite a few desserts, one being the coconut cream pie which had an EXTREME amount of whipped cream, most of which one guest had to swipe off. Throughout the service, our waters were constantly filled. Other than that, the coffee was delicious; flavors in the food were beautiful. The restaurant as a whole, I loved seeing a consistency for cards placed on tables. I would have like to seen a more extensive list for cocktails, BTG list had a nice range of pinots to tempranillo blends and all the in betweens.",

We got seated near the window view where we were able to see the strip. They had the cutest card and heart confetti sprinkled on the table which I thought was a lovely touch. Love the ambience here very romantic with the dim lights.   Let's talk food.  I order the Bone-In Kona Crusted Dry Aged NY Strip medium well and it was so delicious. Every bite had so much flavor. My boyfriend had the Bone-In Ribeye and I felt like it was a bit dry for my liking. We also ordered the lobster mac and cheese and most def. one of the best mac and cheese I had ever tried. It even had pretty big pieces of lobster in it (DROOLS). Along with that we order truffle fries which was good too.   We had the sweetest server ever. She was attentive, informative, and polite. She even brought out a complimentary cake for our anniversary. Our bill came out to $200 and was well worth it.",

They were famished and Capital Grill was the first thing they saw as we walked from the casino towards the strip.    They were paying so I neither said a word nor offered a recommendation.  I would've picked and chose a different local venue had I known they were salivating for steaks.    We were sat down right next to the windows with a view of the fabulous strip and were quickly attended.  The wait staff was topnotch!  The food, however...  Friends were truly famished as they ordered like they've never seen food in years.  After a couple of hours, we were left with unfinished steaks, pasta dishes and desserts.  We didn't even ate a third of what they ordered.  They truly went overboard.   I didn't finish my steak, it was good but it wasn't a \"to die for\" steak considering the price tag.   Either I wasn't as hungry as my friends or it was just too late.  On our way home, nobody wanted to take the leftover bags.   They insisted that I take them home to Jiyo.  Jiyo, my 5 year old chihuahua, was happy the following day!  He had his best lunch ever!",

Not saying anything bad about others, but in Vegas with the view & all, it's an experience.  'G' is still the best bartender as well as Jason the best manager & food is always consistently delicious.  Add this time of the year of 'Generous Pour' & it's on!  I can't wait to bring my family here.  Cheers!",

I'm a huge fan of their lobster mac n cheese and the dry rubbed rib eye.  As always, neither disappointed.  My wife had the filet mignon which after having some bites of my rib eye, I thought hers was very bland.  Not sure if it's because my taste buds were enjoying my fattier meat too much or it was overall bland.",

Our server was Charles and he was fantastic. He was attentive without being pushy and I always appreciate that. Super low key, much like us. So it was a great fit. We were deliberating between the oysters or tuna tartare and he suggested the tartare. It didn't disappoint! The fish was fresh and I really enjoyed the mango puree that accompanied it.   I had the lobster salad again and man, I LOVE that salad. There are always huge chunks of fresh lobster. At first glance, it may look fairly small. Once deconstructed, you realize just how huge it is. I always manage to finish it though. It's too good to try to save any for leftovers!   JD ordered Charles personal favorite, the steak sandwich. He and I were both VERY impressed with the size of it. Gigantic. The steak was cooked perfectly to order-- medium rare. He actually had trouble finishing it as well, which is a rarity for him. The fries were crisp and the Parmesan is a nice touch.   Charles went above and beyond for me by putting some jasmine green tea on ice for me, which normally is served hot. It was refreshing and exactly what I was looking for.   +2 because Charles was really great and made it such a pleasant experience from start to almost finish.   -1 because Drew came out to speak to us at the end of our meal and still had the same arrogant demeanor about him.",

    "text": "I lived in Vegas a few years ago and never made it out to this steakhouse, mostly because it's in the Fashion Show Mall and I didn't want to deal with parking. I had a work dinner scheduled here recently so I was glad to finally try it.  I was with someone who was a regular, so our server was very attentive to our table. I don't know if it was the company I was with or if that's how the servers normally are, but I'll take it. I had the tenderloin and lobster tail as my entree. I asked for my steak to be well done, however I felt it was a little rarer in the middle than I would have liked. It was flavorful though and the lobster tail was delicious. I also got the creme brulee cheesecake for desert. I normally don't like cheesecake but this was light and fluffy and the berries on the side gave it nice kick.   If you're in the area, worth a stop here. Although be prepared to spend some dough, it's quite pricey!",

Our steaks are always right, drinks are better than elsewhere, and the calamari is the best in the country.  I've visited many CGs, including the first in Providence, RI. The things that make this restaurant special are traditions like their lobster bisque, stoli-doli, and steaks. I've been to the other Vegas steakhouses and I keep coming back to The Capital Grille.",

Don't let the name mislead you, it is a fine dining establishment that rivals any steakhouse in town. If you are visiting Las Vegas it will be a dining experience you will remember.",

    "text": "This was a great choice.  We were looking for a good steakhouse and found it here.  To start, we got seated right at the window looking north up the strip, and we could see the Wynn and Encore across the street.  It might have been romantic, if I wasn't dining with a couple other guys...  The ambiance was nice - like a quiet version of Fleming's with a touch of the Rat Pack.  Paintings of notable faces from the old days of Vegas hung on the walls in various corners of the restaurant.  Speaking of Fleming's, the menu resembled theirs in format and pricing.  The service was exceptional - very attentive, but not overbearing.  I got the lamb chops, which were outstanding!  I ordered med-rare, and they came very pink and warm - perfect!  They served it with a cherry compote, which was a perfect compliment - I'm not a fan of the mint jelly that often accompanies lamb.  One of my friends ordered the Delmonico steak, which is a 22 oz bone-in ribeye.  All of their beef is dry-aged in-house.  As good as my lamb was, I was coveting that steak, and he said it was great.  I will return to this establishment and enjoy another great meal on my next trip.",

All the appetizers and soups I've had the chance to try(granted, only a few), were great, and that's definitely this place's strength.  Compared to a few other steak houses that I've tried in Vegas, it ranks about in the middle when it comes to the actual steak. However very very good steak houses are surprisingly somewhat rare in Vegas, so take it for what you will.",

    "text": "Made reservations for this place a week in advance BF asked for a window table and everything was confirmed and ready to go. We went there on a Thur in the evening in attempts to \"beat the crowd\" when we walked in the place was empty (typical for a weekday) we gave the hostess (she was nice) out name and she asked another lady a question (quietly) NOW as l mentioned before the place was EMPTY only one other table. She quickly sat us in the first table closest to the register/hostess station, which was weird because we specifically asked for and confirmed a window table (guess we looked like we might run out on the bill) We took that in stride and just tried to enjoy the meal, food was decent enough, filet mignon was nicely cooked but lobster Mac and cheese was the highlight. The server was nice but he NEVER checked on us, we both had salads to start, entree and a dessert and he NEVER refilled out drink even ONCE never even asked if we needed anything else. Needless to say the service was less than perfect, guess we also look like bad tippers. We have been to and frequented MANY fine dining establishments in Vegas and this is by far the worst l was ever treated. lm never going back, the service was horrible and they seem too presumptuous and judgmental. Don't go here l would try Tender at the Luxor or even Delfrisco's for better food and service",

The Demonoco steak was delish!!!! The filet meon was so tender, the lobster wrapped in shrimp my wife said was good. The special last night was blacken bass and my nephew thought it was great . Over all a nice evening and good food and the service great all the way. My daughter spilled soda on her steak and the waiter takes it the kitchen and regrills the steak dry and brings it back to her and she was happy. The waiter tried to accommodate her when she requested a pickle they even had that for her ( she loves pickles). So she enjoyed her meal and that made my evening.  The lobster Mac was just like all the reviews very good, and happy we stopped in while in Vegas.",

    "text": "Five Stars for service !!!!!!  Four stars for food !! 4.5 overall score   Great restaurant with awesome service and good food. Give the food 4 stars. Good high quality food. Absolutely better than average. Definitely going to get your money's worth.   FOOD: Ordered 2lb lobster with jumbo shrimp cocktail. Shrimp were fresh and served with a cocktail sauce that was familiar but with a little kick. Would recommend.  The lobster was cool to perfection. Recommend letting the lobster cool a bit before eating. They brought mine piping hot and the taste was off. Hard to explain but trust me as soon as it cooled off, the lovely taste of lobster was obtained. $25/lb I find it was a great value.  Definitely recommended to lobster lovers. 2lbs is more than enough. Would suggest sharing. I've had better, but happy to come back for Seconds.   SERVICE:  is where this place stands out above the rest.  Everyone from the receptionist to the manager greeted us with appreciation and pleasant attitudes. They were very attentive to my comfort and happiness. Never had to ask for a refill on my water or ice tea. (My biggest pet peeve). My server Melissa (red head) was pretty much awesome in every way. She asked me How everything was and told her that I had 4 claws with my lobster. She informed me that I should of only had 2 claws and told me she would talk to the manager about it. The manager came by and talked to me. He assured me that this was highly unusual and he would investigate it further. Thinking he would just give me an excuse, I was surprised when he apologized and would replace my lobster with a new one. I just wanted to trade in 2 claws for more tail but he gave me everything to make sure I was happy. Kuddos guys because actions like this makes me happy to spend 30 minutes of my life to tell all the restaurant goers to eat here. If you're not happy, they will try to make you leave that you are important enough to have you coming back for more. Great job guys !!!!  Best service ever !!",

Capital Grille went above and beyond with a letter from them, congratulating us. Also heart shaped decor was put on our table and free dessert for the occasion. The food was to die for! We ate till we couldn't anymore! :) Great people working there, from the waiters, to the bussers, and management! I'm sure if we met the kitchen, they'd be pretty awesome too! I'll be back sooner than later, that's for sure!!! Thanks for the wonderful experience and helping me celebrate my one year!!!",

Starting with the fresh oysters, they are so fresh that I can taste the ocean. My husband doesn't like raw food but he ate 3. With that kind of quality for only $18 for half dozen, it's totally worth the price.   Calamari was crisp. I was surprised it can be tasted that good with the hot peppers. Must try!  Steak tartare, a little bit dry but not too bad. I had better :)  Lobster crab cakes, not too special. $20 for only 2 pieces, I think you can skip it.     We had the rib eye for main course, and the steak cooked to perfection with the fries on the side. One of the best steaks in town.  Also like their wine list.

The whole time he was at our table taking orders he kept looking down at my breast. After dinner he brought out spoons for everyone.

The prices are a tad bit more affordable compared to the fancy steak houses in and around LV. The service is top notch and every waiter is so personable and funny. They are honest about what food and drink they think would be best suited for you.. which can take some pressure of you.  The Gorgonzola NY strip is great... but the kona crusted NY strip I ate earlier in the year from there was a hair better I thought. My wife's bone in filet was a juicy piece of meat n melted in your mouth, but watch out for the steep price. The sauteed mushrooms were great as a side. You can't go wrong with mushrooms doused in butter.  I love the fact they knew it was my birthday and left me a card from the staff and a free dessert at meals end. Very nice touch!  Take advantage of their unlimited wine pours for $28. It's only around for the summer and they use 10 highly rated wines. Not $5 wines you can buy at cvs. You can definitely take advantage but I'm sure you'll be a drunkard by the end of the meal.  Capital grille is a top notch establishment and you should give it a try!",

He started out by taking a group photo then recommended three entrees (Chilean sea bass/rib eye strips/filet mignon with mushrooms) and four sides (asparagus with lemon sauce/grilled Brussels sprouts/au gratin potatoes/macaroni cheese with lobster) for six of us to share. Perfect amount of food. Then the desserts--creme brulee with berries, cheesecake with berries, double chocolate cake with soaked cherries, and the best: coconut cream pie with caramel syrup. Amazing food for $46.",

First we had fried calamari which I don't usually eat but I tried their pan fried calamari with out chili peppers and it was a perfect combination.  The calamari was done perfectly, crispy and not rubbery and the cherry peppers gave it just the right amount of spiciness.  I had the lobster and crab burger on a brioche bun and it too was wonderful.  We had a side of their home made potato chips and they were great.  Well worth the trip if you want a fine dining lunch.",

He was very knowledgeable of the menu with great recommendations! We started off with the lobster bisque and French onion soup. Though you cant necessarily compare the two the French onion was my favorite. Definitely should've ordered the bowl. I also extremely enjoyed the filet Oscar with crab. The meat was so tender and the bernaise sauce  complimented it very well. On the menu most of the steaks did not come with a side luckily mine came with asparagus. We also ordered the lobster Mac and cheese to share. YUM! I'm a huge fan of Mac and cheese and this was probably the best I've ever had.  Yes it is a bit pricey but it was 100% worth it!",

We arrived a little early so we sat at the bar whilst we talked and enjoyed the quiet and serene setting of this restaurant.    This is a busy restaurant and tables are very close to each other so if you are looking to propose to someone I would call to make sure you are seated away from the traffic unless you want an audience.  No, I didn't get proposed to but I'm just looking out for my fellow Yelpers.   We both ordered the sliced filet mignon.  I'm not sure about him but I've been ordering filet more and more because it has the lowest fat out of all of the selections of meat.  I would consider my filet medium-rare and not rare but it was super tender... the mashed potatoes were creamy and dense.. super filling so I'd suggest ordering it to share.  Not sure if this was made to share but I'm only saying it because I don't like to share my food.    Towards the end of our meal we felt an earthquake.  The couple behind us freaked out because they're from New York, we heard.  The aftershock lasted for quite a bit and I admit that staff held their composure and kept it business as usual.

Juicy and tendered meat was a dream come True to a carnivore!   There were accompaniments served as side dishes such as green beans, mashed potatoes and beautiful breads, and salad, BUT I just did not want to fill up with these and believe me it was worthwhile  the steak with a soft white sauce to go along-   I am sorry no pictures; however, you can see the piece of meat in others' postings. I forgot to photograph the meal. But, I can show you the dessert plate to share with our table. The service was perfect, warm and friendly -   The location is across from the Wyn hotel. The Capital Grille is romantic, classy and filled with familiar Hollywood and Political characters' oil canvas portraits such as Dean Martin, Frank Sinatra and President Roosevelt and another of his wife, Eleanor.

TCG Service & Ambiance:  The dining area is very elegant, and the glass windows provide for some nice views of the Strip and Wynn hotels depending on your seating.  The staff is dressed sharply in ties and jackets.  The look and the service is very professional.  They always ask initially if I'm under time constraints at lunch to notify the kitchen if necessary, fantastic.  With that, the dishes always come out timely regardless.  TCG Lunch Cuisine:  The pan-fried calamari with the hot cherry peppers is the go to shared table appetizer.  The peppers add the perfect amount of spiciness to the dish.  The signature cheeseburger is fancy with the Vermont cheddar as well as tasty.  The filet has always been cooked perfectly when I've ordered it.  Every salad and soup I've had has been fresh and well prepped.  Overall, the portions are on the smaller size but the chefs pack them with tons of flavor.  The Capital Grille is my safe space for business lunches as they've always delivered on service and cuisine.  The ambiance is classy and business casual attire matches perfectly with it.  I'll be here for more business lunches in the future.  Enjoy!",

Highly highly recommend dinner here and better yet ask for Wade. Not to mention our delicious rib eye and tenderloin were cooked to perfection. The lobster Mac and cheese and creamed spinach to die for. Dessert we had creame brulee, cheesecake and a chef specialty. Overall one of the best meals we've ever had .",

    "text": "Have you ever had a waiter give you his business card at the end of your meal?  No?  Me either. But, Frankie at The Capital Grille was the first and only waiter that I've ever had that warrants handing out business cards to his guests.    Frankie is a character, a fabulous waiter, and you really are his guest when you dine with him.   I would absolutely ask for him again.  We ended our work trip to Vegas by escaping the Palazzo Hotel and going across the street to the Fashion Show Mall for dinner.  Boy was I pleased - I was so tired of the noise and volume of people - and the Capital Grill delivered on the quiet, upscale environment I craved, and we had a delicious dinner.  I would also recommend their pineapple vodka drink.  It was delicious.  Turns out, it is just straight vodka that they've soaked pineapple in for a month and it is delicious and dangerous!  Only downside was seeing the bill at the end, we went a bit overboard with cocktails, a nice bottle of wine, the crab cocktail, skillet shrimp appetizer, lobster tails, and dessert....so we did it to ourselves.  I highly recommend escaping the casinos and dining with Frankie!",

If you have ever dined out during lunchtime, you know that 1pm at fine dining restaurants are practically scarce/empty. Which was great for us because had the staff's full attention and it happened to be a celebration for her birthday :) Shoutout to Michael who took very good care of my friend and I!   I ordered the salmon entree and my bestie ordered the lobster burger for lunch. We both agreed the food was very good. We were more engrossed with the atmosphere of the restaurant. Truly elegant with the dark cherry wood and flowing beige curtains. I am sure this place looks amazing at night! We had dressed up and because there were no people around us, took many photos. Knowing girls, you can imagine the fun we had :) We plan to come back in the evening because we want to see it glow with ambiance at night.  Why only 4/5 stars? Location isn't the best. View is okay and parking is tricky. It is in the Fashion Mall and if you are unfamiliar, you could potentially get lost and become late for your reservation. Also, the entrance is hidden behind the food court, you can either take the escalator or walk throughout the mall in your cute (i.e painful) heels and outfit to get there.",

They have a bar menu in addition to the regular menu with a couple of different things you can't order on the main diner menu. Nice option.  However we did end up ordering from the dinner menu.    We had calamari with spicy peppers, Pear  & Gorgonzola salad, & French onion soup. All were very delicious. Calamari had just the right amount of heat, the salad wasn't too sweet, & the soup was one of the best ones around. The portions were pretty big so we were very full from what we had.

    "text": "Beautiful, elegant restaurant with an amazing view. Located on the third floor of the Fashion Show Mall facing the Wynn/Encore, the restaurant's location can be a bit of a journey to find as there is no entrance to the restaurant inside the mall. There is only one door- the front door which is outside- that leads you inside the restaurant, but the food, service & ambiance make the journey worthwhile.   The restaurant itself is romantic and classic, with mahogany accents and warm lighting, perfect for a date night or special celebration. The night I went was very busy. I made a 7:30 reservation for a party of 4 earlier in the day, and even though I arrived on time, the rest of my party was running a bit late. Thankfully, the hostess didn't cancel our reservation, and said that they would set up our table once everyone in my party arrived. That was just the beginning of the outstanding service my party and I experienced that night at The Capital Grille.   We were seated in a booth next to the floor-to-ceiling windows that encase a good portion of the restaurant. Our server was wonderful- very attentive, knowledgable and energetic. After bringing out our drinks and the bread basket (an assortment of rolls, crackers, etc.), without asking us, he brought us an appetizer of Shrimp Cocktail, saying he thought we would enjoy it. Enjoy it we did. The shrimp were fresh and plump, and the cocktail sauce had a kick. Very good!   For the main course, I ordered the Lobster and Crab Stuffed Shrimp- Delicately butterflied shrimp stuffed with fresh lobster and crab, lightly breaded, and roasted with a touch of wine. Good, but not \"Oh my goodness, you've got to try this!\" amazing. I enjoyed the flavorful, meaty filling, but I found the dish a bit dry. It would have been better with more of the creamy sauce.   The rest of my party ordered: Double Cut Lamb Rip Chops- Four, flavorful double cut rib chops with a side of fruit chutney (cherry, I think). The portion size was perfect, and the owner of this dish seemed to enjoy it, as nothing was left on the plate.  Cedar Planked Salmon with Tomato Fennel Relish- A fillet of North Atlantic salmon seasoned with fennel pollen, roasted on a cedar plank and finished with lemon mosto and Tomato Fennel Relish. The fillet size was shockingly large, and while the salmon was fresh, the dish lacked seasoning (due to the simple preparation of the fish, which I'm guessing was to highlight the natural flavor of the fresh salmon).   Dry Aged Porterhouse Steak- 24-oz. dry-aged steak. Recommended by our server. The portion was enormous, and while there was a lot of meat, it wasn't the best quality of steak (as noted by the owner of this dish).   Side order of Parmesan Truffle Fries-  Golden fries tossed in shredded Grana Padano, kosher salt and white truffle oil. Crunchy, savory and the truffle flavor wasn't too overpowering. I really enjoyed this side.  Side order of Fresh Asparagus with Hollandaise- Garden fresh asparagus cooked al dente to a most delicate crispness, and served with their own Hollandaise sauce.   Side order of Roasted Seasonal Mushrooms- A hearty blend of mushrooms (Portabella, Oyster, Shiitake, and Cremini), slowly oven roasted with extra virgin olive oil, rosemary, thyme and garlic butter. Delicious.   We also ordered dessert and coffee to finish the meal. Our server recommended the Fresh Berries in Vanilla Cream- A blend of strawberries, blackberries, raspberries and blueberries in a velvety smooth Creme Anglaise. The dessert was light and not too sweet- a perfect way to end a memorable night.",

If they had browned it a bit longer, it would have been good; the crab and lobster chunks were sweet, but the filling was mushy.  Our table mates enjoyed their steaks.  The wine was good. The service was surprisingly average.",

The restaurant itself was beautiful and had lovely views. Customer service was outstanding- Chuck was great! The bread that they started us off with was by far the worst that we've had in any steakhouse. We then ordered the calamari which was very good. After hearing about the two specials my husband and I each ordered one. Unfortunately when they came out they were each cooked wrong. We thought that maybe they just got the order mixed up. He ordered his rare and I ordered mine medium. It wasn't that big of a deal to us so we were just going to trade meals. The strange thing was that my meal came with two 7oz fillets and they were each cooked totally different. We didn't complain because everything still tasted good. We shared the mashed potatoes and they were delicious! We then shared the cheesecake which was super amazing!",

Since we were the first to arrive and was famished; she wanted to treat me for my belated birthday and took me to Capital Grille for lunch. We were staying at the Trump and conveniently just walked over to Capital Grille. This was both our first time at this location. She's been to the Capital Grille in PA and I've been to Capital Grille many times in Costa Mesa, Ca.  Jeff was our waiter and we couldn't have ask for a better waiter! We LOVE him! He was vibrant, funny and very helpful with our course selection. He recommended us to try their new martinis and the lobster crab hamburger was yummy! Their coconut cream pie is to die for. I always get that for dessert! Their beef wagyu carpaccio is oh so yummy! Seared salmon salad was refreshingly delicious and their sliced filet mignon with caramelized onions and mushrooms just melts in your mouth.  Jeff was so sweet, we even took a pix with him. =) If you're in the area, ask to be seated where Jeff will be serving! Overall a great experience and the food was stellar!",

It's upscale elegant style and decor will impress you as you are dazzled by an enchanting birds eye view of The World Famous Las Vegas Strip. The Porcini bone-in ribeye is the way to go. It's a 15-year aged balsamic steak with a delicate porcini mushroom crust. Cooked to perfection ...with each tender bite you're chewing paradise. Pair the Porcini with some of its friends like roasted fingerling potatoes or grilled asparagus with lemon mosto and now it's a party! The clam chowder or Caesar salad are both great starters as well. The deserts are decadent & delicious! The entire staff took care of us all night with prompt, courteous service... and our server was excellent, giving us great recommendations along with exceptional customer service. If you're going to hit Vegas anytime soon....put The Capital Grille on your Vegas bucket list because this place is operating at a championship level.",

    "text": "Pretty typical steakhouse experience. Personally I think Morton's is better.   The men in our group ordered the dry aged strip steak which they seemed very happy with. When I tasted one I didn't think it was outstandingly better than non-dry-aged steak. The flavor wasn't better or more tender IMHO.   My mom and I ordered fish: she citrus glazed salmon, me the tuna.   Sides we ordered were asparagus and green beans. Both pretty typical and not treated in any interesting ways.  I was told the tuna was sashimi grade and just seared. Little did I know this meant below room temperature in the center. I'm used to my ahi grilled rare/med-rare and I think it's better that way unless you're eating actual sushi.   If you're looking for a safe traditional steak house you'll be fine here.  Desserts were the best part of the meal. The flourless chocolate espresso cake was delicious. Husband approved of the creme brulee.",

The wine list is tasteful with half bottle's available. Do to the fact that we expect and require stellar service, we also request a Sr. Server to tend to our table. With this, we have yet to be disappointed with the service.  Our coarse usually consists of the French Onion Soup, which comes in a large portion (enough to share), House Salad, Crab Cakes and the Fillet Mignon. We enjoy our steaks cooked medium and unlike a lot of other steak houses, the temp is just right every time. The Au Gratin Potatoes are sinfully delectable and quite a treat.  A definite recommendation for a quiet couple's night in Vegas!",

Reasonable.  I had an 8oz fillet that was topped with approx 3oz of deliciously fresh crab meat that just had a hint of a delicious sauce.  What a great combo.  Not revolutionary, but the steak came out perfect to my order (M-rare) and was of very high quality beef.  Definitely a top 10 steak for me of all time.    Please request a strip view and take some time to look over the well stocked wine list.   You will be right across from the Wynn and have a beautiful sight in front of you.

    "text": "This is a Lunch Review.  This was the last stop of our \"Vegas Food Tour\" before we trotted our butts back to Los Angeles. We decided to go here because they were apart of restaurant week and they were offering the most diverse selection on their pre-fixed menu compared to other places participating. It was $30.10 per person for a 3-course lunch.  My first impressing upon walking in to this place was... \"YOU FANCY HUH?!?!\" Its located in the fashion show mall, so I wasn't really expecting anything super fancy, but it was. White table clothes, dark wood, wine glasses, and lunch having executives. We were greeted by the host, a not so friendly older lady, who didn't really give us the impression that she wanted us to eat there. But we shrugged it off and the service actually ended up being pretty good.   1st course: I went for the clam chowder. This dish was actually a pleasant surprise due to its copious amounts of clams. It had a nice creamy but not too oily soup base with my oh so favorite oyster crackers! The GF went for the french onion soup. I wasn't much of a fan, I thought it was a bit too salty but she on the other hand likes that kinda thing so she loved it. It was the run of the mill french onion soup IMHO.  2nd course: She was starving so she opted for the The Grille's Signature Cheeseburger with truffle fries. This was a very large sirloin patty with smoked bacon, sweet onions, and havarti cheese on an onion roll. If you have an appetite I would most likely suggest this burger because its huge. The truffle fries were delish and friend to perfection. I went for the Seared Citrus Glazed Salmon. It was a large filet of salmon seared to perfection over some asparagus and onions. It was probably one of the most juiciest salmons I've ever had.   3rd course: We went for the usual creme brulee which I think is pretty much the same at most locations. Its pretty hard to do a creme brulee wrong, but of course Capital Grille's was ginormous. And we also got the Strawberries Capital Grille that consisted of fresh strawberries and vanilla ice cream topped with Grand Marnier. This was mediocre, some sweeter strawberries probably would have helped the cause.  For what we paid, we definitely got a deal with the enormous portions they served. It was a nice place but the food wasn't super memorable. Dinner may be a different story.",

They had probably 5-6 different types of bread in a basket, so if you're picky about your grains, you have options. A friend and I split the Delmonico steak and Lobster Mac & Cheese (AND an entire bottle of wine... YOLO!) I appreciate that the staff here knew we were splitting, so they came out with the steak cut in half for us. The food was great! Steak was cooked perfectly and the Lobster Mac & Cheese was not lacking in lobster and was probably the best lobster mac & cheese I've ever had in my entire life (I've only had it about maybe 4 times, though). We were so stuffed afterwards.   I docked one star because of an incident we saw while they were seating another table. The couple was seated in a booth that did not have place settings, so I believe it was the manager at the time that shot the server a nasty look, kind of like \"Why the hell would you seat them there. Are you dumb?\" I kind of felt bad for the server because there was nothing she could do. It almost felt degrading. And on top of that, the manager wasn't hiding her emotions. Basically anyone in the restaurant could have seen it happen. If you have constructive criticism, do it behind closed doors. Not where people can openly see you treat someone with a nasty attitude. Hope the employees here are treated well!",

I had one with the rub and my husband had the plain but they were both just ok nothing exciting. The Parmesan truffle fries and lobster mac n cheese we good. Service was great and the atmosphere is like every other nice restaurant here in town. Again it wasn't bad but at $50 a steak I would hope to say wow that was really awesome. Maybe the majority of people eat a lot of bland food so this is exciting to them but if you are like me and looking for more flavor than your average steak go somewhere else",

THIS WAS THE BEST FUCKING CORN SIDE I'VE EVER HAD. i could eat this all day. i could have this as an entree. its seasonal. so get it while you can.  entree - i had the chicken. i know, why have chicken at a steakhouse. i regret it as well. def. must go back.   service was superb.",

We asked for another one to be made but they said it would be the same as it is made from the same broth. We ordered a Caesar salad and it was delicious. Next came out the steak and it was very tender. Prices are  a bit pricey but what do you expect? It's Vegas and all restaurants are pricey. Overall the food was good and I would come back.",

    "text": "I've always wanted to come here and first time trying it out and I was impressed!  First and foremost, the hostess greeted us right away.  She was very friendly.  Restaurant was very nice inside, nice view of the Las Vegas Strip.  We first started with apps which we had oysters, lobster and calamari and shrimp.  All was very good!! Oysters were nice and cold and being in Las Vegas surprisingly; tasted fresh.  Lobster was served cold but it was very tasty. The calamari was pretty good.  It defiantly had a some kick to it due to the  peperoncini and peppers mixed it. And the shrimp were huge; could use a little more cocktail sauce but the apps were great!  Now on to my entree all I have to say was YUMM!!!  I ordered the sea bass and it was awesome!!! It was cooked perfectly, tasted great.  I would highly recommend this entree.  My boyfriend ordered the steak and lobster and he said that it was just the right amount of food due to if you order some of the steaks they are huge! His steak was cooked perfectly; just the way he liked it and the lobster was on top with some creamy sauce as the base.    Our sides were corn, Au gratin potatoes and lobster mac-n-cheese and asparagus.  The sides were good I just have to say if you order the corn, Au Gratin Potatoes and the loster mac-n-cheese, it's all based with cream sauce and bread crumbs.  I've heard from several people that the lobster mac-n-cheese was very good but I wouldn't rate it as a 5.  It was alright.  I expected it to be a little more cheesy and the noodles could of been more of the traditional way to where the cheese can get inside of the noodles instead of using a egg noodles.  All in all, I will definately go there again!!!",

Our server was very sweet and everyone there was very helpful.  We were a little disappointed that they didn't offer the same lunch plate as the ones in OC. We normally got a starter of soup or salad and lobster roll for $18.  The lobster roll alone is $22; maybe they have to pay higher rent???  Pan-fried calamari with cherry peppers was really yummy as usual.  For drink I had the Bohemian and it was just ok.",

    "text": "I've been DYING to try Capital Grill and it just so happened to the bf's boss was taking the team and their plus ones to Capital Grill! Yay!!! Free yummy food all night. Since we were a large group, we had our own lil room with large portraits of unknown men (two to be exact)....the bf mentioned that it was a $3,000 minimum that needed to be spent.   We all started off with drinks....my Riesling was not too dry and that's the kind of wine I like. The bf's boss ordered the Coldshell Fish Platter, Pan Fried Calamari and Prosciutto Wrapped Mozzarella. My favorite out of all of those was the Fried Calamari. I loved how it was a lil spicy, crispy and oh so delicious! YUM! The oysters were HUGE....almost the size of my palm. Everything else was good, but the calamari is what stood out in my mind.   For an entree, I decided to go with Seared Tenderloin with the Butter Poached Lobster and a cup of the Clam Chowder. The bf ordered some kind of steak and the Lobster Bisque. This lady at the table was raving about the Lobster Bisque and how it had real chunks of lobster in it. The soups and salads arrived fairly quickly and let's just note that the Lobster Bisque....not so awesome. Clam Chowder was definitely WAY better than the bisque. My beef tenderloins were tender and I believe there were 3 or 4 tenderloins plus the lobster. I thought it was tender and tasty, nothing too special. Lobster was cooked well and was very buttery. I was extremely full by the time my tenderloins came out so I'm not sure I appreciated it to its full extent.   For the sides, we shared everything family style. Creamed Spinach, Parmesan truffle fries, Sam's Mashed Potatoes, Lobster Mac and Cheese, Fresh Asparagus with Hollaindaise Sauce, Roasted Seasonal Mushrooms and Au Gratin Potatoes was what was ordered. Out of everything I really loved the Sam's Mashed Potatoes and the Creamed Spinach. The Lobster Mac and Cheese was probably my least favorite....not very flavorful and just not what I expected it to be. The Au Gratin Potatoes had this delightful crust on top which was pretty awesome.   Service was attentive and everything was overall fairly good. Nothing was knock me of my chair awesome, but I thought it was a good meal nonetheless.",

If you paid me, I honestly wouldn't be able to tell you how to get to the place, BUT! I'd definitely be able to tell you that the luscious hunk of meat that was served on my plate was one of the best steaks I've had in a minute. So tender there's absolutely no need for your steak knife to mutilate the poor animal more than it has been already. Rather, make love to it with your fork and mouth. MmmMmm  The ambiance and decor are pretty dope. Its got that old school attic kinda feel with wine EVERYWHERE. The view of the strip is pretty nice, definite brownie points if you're trying to woo your old lady. And the service isn't all too bad either. Its not the 5.99 prime rib dinner at gold strike, so don't come in here if you've had a bad night at the craps tables.",

Having previously been to your Long Island, NY location, I knew my family and I would be in for a treat.  What I did not know, was how immaculate the service would be.  Our waiter, Ralph was not only extremely knowledgeable but also showed the attentiveness and understanding we seek when fine dining.  The food was extremely consistent with your Long Island location, and needless to say, we were all delighted.  The steaks were cooked to perfection, the sides were very generously portioned, and even when we were not thrilled about how our Lobster Tails came out, Ralph made sure that those that were not up to par were replaced and brought out fresh and hot.  Not only will I be recommending this location to all friends that visit Las Vegas, but I will be reccommending all of your loctations as my family left the restaurant feeling satisfied and special.  Ralph and all of The Capital Grille Las Vegas made my father's birthday special and we hope to celebrate many more occassions at another one of your locations.",

    "text": "I have been wanting to go to the Capital Grille in SoCal, but never got to doing this.  However, when I saw that there was one in Las Vegas while searching for a place to fine dine in Vegas, I immediately booked a reservation to celebrate my recent promotion.  Once we arrrived, we were seated immediately.  Our table was decorated with foil confetti in the shape of balloons and there was a card sealed with wax to congratulate me on my promotion.  I am impressed by this because I was expecting a table with a view that I requested since we were having a late dinner, but not the decorated table because I thought it was usually birthdays and anniversaries that  are given this.  We definitely had a nice view of the Las Vegas Strip.  Our waiter, Eric, was amazing!  He was very attentive to us even though he had to tend to a number of tables.  He took the time to explain how we can go through the wine list via a tablet.  He also suggested food items that we might enjoy and so we ordered some of these items and wow....delicious I must say!  Everything we ordered was very tasty...fresh oysters on a half shell, lobster bisque, kona rib eye, chilean sea bass, lobster mac and cheese, and brussel spouts!  Of course we couldn't eat everything so we brought it back to our hotel and stored it in the fridge for late night snacking.  Each item we brought back was boxed and labeled with the name of the food item and the bag had an attached label signed by the chef.  Wow!  Never seen that before and we've been fine dining forever.  Last but not least...we ordered the coconut dessert the I saw people raving about and it was exactly what I expected! Yummy!  To make it even better, Eric said it was on the house due to my promotion!  The \"wow\" factor kept going through the night, but the only negative thing was that after we were served our wine, it took at least 45 min to receive our appetizers.  However, I didn't take away any stars for this since everything else was amazing!",

It was very slow service, however, and that was probably the only complaint I had.  I started with a few oysters which were fresh and well prepared (cut well, no shell bits, etc) with vinegar (one of my favorites) as well as horseradish and cocktail sauce. The spinach salad was great, nice hot dressing but the spinach wasn't too wilted either. Bacon bits were good. I had the steak, of course, which was just a little bit beyond medium rare but very good anyway. I do think their spices on the steaks are not as good as other steakhouses but the meat is great. The sides were good, mashed potatoes and string beans. Sides were a little small for the price, I think. Overall, great.",

The rest is good, great even but its the Dry Aged Steak that makes this place and the entire chain a must eat at experience.  My girlfriend has a number of food allergies that means she can't eat spices and other things that are normal in meals to make them taste good.  So I took her here and she could not believe how good a steak without any add ons could taste.  I was the only one to drink and they have a fabulous range (best I've ever seen) of half bottle wines.  You have to specifically ask for the half bottle menu.",

My salad contained no herbs other than what was in the vinaigrette dressing I had on the side.  Capital Grille should rename it the \"Iceberg Lettuce and Tomatoes\" salad.   - My 2 buddies had each ordered soup with their fish entrees.  Both buddies said that the waiter had made it seem that the $11/soup would be complimentary (since it was our first time eating at Capital Grille or whatever).  I wasn't paying attention to what the waiter said when he was discussing the menu, but I'll side with both of my friends (word of my 2 friends vs. the word of 1 waiter) who say they were mislead into ordering the soup.  Had my friends known it wasn't complimentary, they wouldn't have bothered ordering the soup.  Pros: - Great location overlooking the northern end of the Strip. - Aside from the soup problem, the service was great. - Fancy decor, nice ambiance.",

They knew it was our anniversary and they had rose petals and a card laid out for us on our table. The card read \"thank you for celebrating with us, from the Capital Grill.\" The server even came up to us and gave us some complimentary sparkling wine for our celebration. I was in awe at how well we were treated.   I ordered the veal and my bf ordered the lamb chops. We opted for creamed spinach and Au gratin potatoes for our sides.   While we waited for the food (which was a pretty quick wait) they gave us a complimentary bread assortment which was pretty tasty.   The food came out and I astonished; It looked so delicious! And boy did it taste even better! Both of our plates were bursting with flavor, and the sides were an awesome compliment.   The server checked up on us every 10 minutes or so to fill up our glasses and make sure everything was perfect. When we were almost done with our plates he told us to save some room because they had a \"surprise\" for us. Of course that put a couple big smiles on our faces!  We were just about done with our food when the server brought out a center cut piece of creme brulee cheesecake with a candle placed right in the middle for us. He said it was on the house from Capital Grill and that they hoped we really enjoyed our anniversary.   Mmmm, that cheesecake was sooo delicious! My mouth is drooling just thinking about it!  We had an exceptional dining experience here. I've never had such incredible service anywhere. I hope they stay the way that they are because we'll be sure to come back very soon!  Thank you for making our anniversary so wonderful!",

Very rich decor and typical high end steak house ambiance.  They have a massive wine list (which I didn't sample but my group was very impressed with).  There are enough choices of seafood and meats to satisfy anyone.   Caprese appetizer was an interesting twist on the typical format, and very good.  You order sides for the table and they only cover about 2-3 people so you might need more, which increases the cost for a larger group.  But all we had was really well done and service was great.",

Got to watch the Frontier sign come down during lunch.. sweet!   Mint Lemonade: yummy Bread basket: Warm and delish but nothing special. Calamari: Honestly not that exciting. Just pretty good.  Crab/lobster cake: kinda disappointing. It had a slightly fishy taste and was rather \"mushy\".  Lobster salad: I asked the waiter how mayonaisy (yup I made that word up just now) it was.. and he claimed it had very little. The thing came out and was very goopey and kinda gross. I felt sick all day after eating it.  Cappucino: FAB.. gotta love the rock candy stir stick.   Bumping up a star despite my gross entree because the experience was really nice. Plus my fellow diner's prime rib sandwich looked awesome.. plus their burgers are supposedly the best (per Consumer Reports). It's a decent place to eat in Vegas.. but with so many better options nearby (namely Babareeba, StripBurger, Isla, hell anything at the Wynn if you have that kind of cash.. etc), it's hard to get that excited about coming here.",

We ask to be seated with Frankie from Philly he is a professional, funny and awesome waiter.  My Husband always gets the Oysters & I a salad for appetizers.  As for the entree my husband always gets a steak (always tries different ones) as for me I always get the chicken Entree.  Over the past several years they have changed the Chicken  dish but they never disappoint it is always moist and delicious.  The grilled Asparagus is to die for.  Wine selection is fantastic!!!!!  Looking forward to our next visit to Vegas an another exceptional meal at The Capital Grill!!!",

There isn't much to set this place apart from the rest besides the nationally-recognized name (nothing against chains, but I'm just making a point).    The beef here is pretty consistent.  (It never ceases to amaze me at how many times I've had overcooked steak).  I always order the rib eye and on two separate visits, both times med rare was med rare.  Win!  I also tried a friend's kona coffee rubbed rib eye: yet another example of why you should never pay extra to put crap that ruins/asks the flavor of a good slab of beef.  On my latest trip we had creamed spinach, mushrooms and the lobster mac & cheese.  Creamed spinach was tasty, mushrooms were acceptable, but the mac and cheese was winners!  Next time, I think we'll just have three orders of that.  Aside from the mac and cheese, the one thing that really stood out was the pineapple infused vodka.  Well slap me silly and call me Susan; this stuff is B-O-M-B.  For this drink alone, it is worth at least hitting up the bar.  Also, they have an ok corkage policy.  I think it was $35/bottle, with a two bottle max.  All in all, though, a martini and a side dish aren't enough to really warrant handing over a wad of my cash for a middle of the road steakhouse.  Sure, it's better than Outback, but with competition right across the street, this place has room for improvement.  Just my humble opinion.",

I especially liked the chicken skewers prepared with some sort of Indian spice.  The Capital Grille is located inside the Fashion Show mall, but well away from the crowds.  The dining area has lots of windows with great views of the strip.  I would definitely come back here (properly dressed) for a date night or a business meal.  The have bottles of wine along the walls dedicated to famous people.  I especially took note of the Edward Kennedy bottle, since it was the evening of his memorial.  I can only give four stars right now because my experience was atypical.  But once I experience an actual meal here, I'm sure it will get a full five.",

First time I've been to capital grille and I can say I was very impressed, I had the filet mignon with the asparagus and a glass of the house red wine and it was all amazing. Unfortunately I didn't have the appetite for desert when it was all said and done. The service was very good even though I sat at the bar so I could watch tv I still felt like a very prioritized customer by the guy behind the bar. A bit pricey but It was well worth it for my steak was grilled to perfection and I have no complaints.

(that is if you're sitting by the windows) My fiance ordered the seared tenderloin and butter poached lobster, the only thing he wasn't a fan of was the portion because this man can eat but overall he was satisfied with taste and presentation. I ordered the holy grail of their steaks, the porcini porterhouse, and this baby was HUGE!!! The steak was life changing!! We shared the truffle fries and the lobster mac n cheese as our sides and both were awesome. Since i had put we were celebrating my fiance's birthday on our reservation, our table had birthday decor and a hand written card thanking us for celebrating with them. AAAAAAND we were given complementary champagne to toast before we ate. If i could give them 10 stars i would. Their service was excellent and the food was phenomenal! I highly recommend!",

But I had to give it three stars based on how mediocre the calamari, fries, and Mac and cheese were. Pretty disappointing. The lobster was chewy and over cooked, and was more of a bechamel cream sauce than Mac and cheese. The fries were so greasy, and the calamari was just average.",

My boyfriend was boring and just got a crown and coke. I opted for their special stol-doli. It is pineapple infused vodka and they make it themselves. It was so smooth and good. Whenever I drink vodka, I usually cringe because I hate the taste of it. This drink was so smooth that you couldn't even taste the vodka! Its dangerous, I ended up having two without any thought haha For our appetizers we got a caesar salad and lobster bisque. The lobster bisque was so buttery and creamy and full of lobster chunks. I had ordered the salad but ended up taking the bisque from the boo lol Fo rmy main dish I got the tenderloin with lobster. It comes with two 4 ounce filet mignons and a lobster on top of each. It was very juicy and tender. Literally melt in your mouth. The boyfriend got the dry aged kona rubbed (im pretty sure I messed that up) bone in ribeye. IT WAS SOOOO GOOOD. We are cming back in two weeks just to eat this again. Yeah. It was that good. We also got the lobster mac and cheese which was so good. I am severely lactose intolerant so just imagine what I had to go through to eat this. But I ate most of it despite the consequences I would face later. lol. We had no room for dessert but we took the rest home. When you take it home, they attach this little card signed by the chef. My name is Sarah and my boyfriend's name is Rocco....the chef's name was SACCO! It was meant for us to eat here haha",

    "text": "The entire experience was memorable as this meal was the celebration for my friends 70th Birthday.  I used open table to make our reservation and let them know that we were celebrating a retired Air Force F-4 navigators 70th Birthday.  The only request I made was for a good table and WOW was my request accommodated.  We were given the best table in the house.  The 5 of us ordered 4 different meals which we let each other taste test.  The steaks were each cooked to perfection.  Our shrimp appetizer was equally amazing.  The bread was delicious  as were our sides.  The final touch was when our Birthday man was treated to a sweet desert with a plate adorned with the words Happy Birthday.   Sure it's a bit expensive but you only turn 70 once so why not celebrate in style.  It was well worth the price and the staff was amazing.  Make sure you try the pineapple infused signature cocktail.",

The grilled prosciutto and mozzarella was delicious, the Caesar salad was tasty but slightly over dressed, and the potatoes au gratin were amazing. The most disappointing item that we ordered was the porterhouse steak. The taste was good, but it was dry and way over cooked (brown through despite ordering medium temperature). I was so disappointed because we had heard great things about Capital Grille and I had been craving a juicy quality steak for weeks. It definitely wasn't worth the price and we will be trying someplace new next time we're in town.",

    "text": "Before a show at Wynn, I came here for dinner.  I was early but it was OK and I was seated at a window table with the marvelous third floor view of the boulevard and the Wynn/Encore towers.  I was brought bread, ice water, and iced tea quickly.  My server, Eric, was top notch!  He explained various things on the menu since it was my first visit to the restaurant.  He then left me to mull the choices before coming back to see if I had any questions or was ready to order.  I ordered a cup of potato leek soup, the bone in Kona crusted sirloin and the parmesan truffle fries for a side.  Everything was very, very good.  The potato leek soup was creamy and served with a few very thin, slightly deep fried fingerling potato slices.  The soup was rich and very enjoyable.  I ordered the steak blue and that's just the way it came.  It was very good and I almost picked up the bone to gnaw before I let them take the plate.  The parmesan truffle fries were addictive.  If anyone from the FDA comes to this restaurant, the fries will be listed as a Class xx addictive drug.  I hated to finish only a small amount but I didn't want to overdo it.  For dessert, I got the flourless chocolate espresso cake.  It was very rich and had a good dark chocolate/coffee flavor--strong but not overpowering.    I gave my compliments to Eric for the staff on such a good meal.  It was a great start to the evening.  The view through those windows along with the excellent food and service make the Capital Grille a real winner.",

To start off our dining experience, we always get the Seafood plateau.  It's a ton of seafood and totally worth the $99.  You get a heathy portion of lobster, crab meat, oysters, and shrimp cocktail.  The bone-in ribeye is my go to all the time, but they had a special bone-in filet that was to die for.   My wife and kids ordered that... wish I did too.  It was succulent, juicy, and cut like \"butter\".  If they have it again, that'll be my go to 100% each time.  The sides were amazing as always.  We had the wild mushrooms, lobster mac and cheese, creme spinach, and mash potatoes.  To finish off our dining experience, we had our go to Banana cream pie desert.   A little too much whipped cream this time, but still amazing.     If you're asking if the juice is worth the squeeze?  I'd say hellz ya my ninjas!",

Two others in our group also ordered the seared tenderloin with butter poached lobster tails and another ordered the dry aged NY strip au poivre with courvoisier cream.

We had plenty of space, and the waitstaff even checked to make sure we wanted music, and verified that the volume was acceptable.

We like the comfy booth seating and large windows facing the Strip. The service is friendly, accommodating, and attentive. Unfortunately the food does not match up.   Appetizer: the only good dish we had today was the fried calamari with peppers though it was a bit oily.   Soup: French onion soup looked appetizing, but the soup and onions were way too salty.   Lunch entrees: Salmon and mango salad with champagne vinegrette had potential, but the salmon was dry on the sides and lacked flavor. The mangos were hard and sour. Previous Yelper had voiced disappointment with this dish too.   Chilean Seabass was so-so and a tad dry, but the mushrooms were unbearably salty in the soy sauce. Palazzo's SushiSamba has way better moist Chilean sea bass.   Lobster and crab cake burger is supposed to be a top seller, but the crab cake had too much flour. The lobster also was dry. The housemade salt and vinegar chips were good.   Side: lobster mac n' cheese was a disappointment as the lobsters did not taste fresh. The lobster was very dry and far from succulent. I often order this dish at various restaurant, and this was one of the worse ones since the lobster was bad. The mac n'cheese were good though. If you like lobster, go to Top of the World at the Stratosphere for fresh succulent Canadian lobster.   Dessert: they were very kind and offered us a dessert duo of chocolate cake and cheesecake. We were hoping the dessert would be better, but unfortunately, the best part about dessert were the fresh berries that came with it. There is a fresh berries dessert on the menu too. I would recommend that.   Overall, the service is great, but the food was disappointing. With so many delicious culinary delights to choose from in Vegas, Capital Grille does not stand the heat. It needs to improve it's quality and taste of food. I have never been for dinner, but lunch was a regrettable experience.",

I wouldn't recommend going unless you are willing to spend at least $100 before tip. I had a full 3 course meal starting with an amazing display of seafood. I do recommend splitting the Grand seafood platter with friends I divided it between 4 of us and it was a good taster course for us all to start off with. The oysters and lobster were truly an religious experience for any seafood lover in the words of one of my friends \"they take you somewhere else.\" My steak was cooked perfectly and with just the right sauce to compliment it. They happened to be out of the bottle of wine we had ordered and they very kindly recommend a similar bottle and matched the price even though it was about $20 more expensive. Their cheesecake was absolutely the best I have ever had. It was fluffy and well balanced, just when you are really thinking of you can eat anymore they ask about dessert. I have to say I was really questioning weather I could in fact eat more but I just had a feeling it would be worth it.( I also split it with a friend)  The only let down in this entire experience, and I'm really begrudgingly admitting this, the soups we had ordered were good but unimpressive. The cup of lobster bisque had more of a dense cream flavor and texture then a True intense lobster flavor. The clam chowder my friend ordered had the exact same issue leading me to believe this is just go the make their soups.",

As we waited for our table we decided to go to the bar and have a cocktail! As soon as we got to the bar we were promptly greeted by the barkeep Michael Giambrone. As we were browsing the menu he enlightened us to their signature cocktail The Stoli Doli! It's Stoli vodka with pineapple infused into it and served straight up! It was delightful. Michael was very knowledgeable of the different wines that paired with the steaks we were thinking of choosing, and when the hostess came to seat us to our table we graciously declined and stayed at the bar, cause we were already receiving wonderful service. At the end of our dinner it was time for dessert, and with all the options we couldn't decide so we asked Michael to help us and he said try the cheesecake, and we did and it was the best cheesecake we have ever had! We would definitely recommend The Capital Grille and when you come visit Michael Giambrone at the bar before you go to your table! Definitely a memorable wedding anniversary! Thank you for the wonderful experience!!!",

They immediately brought bread and butter to the table. When our waiter came, he asked us the usual question what would we like to drink. I asked him for a non-alcoholic drink. He looked at me and said they don't have much choices for non-alcoholic so what do I want. I was kind of offended at his tone so I ended up ordering non-alcoholic mojito. The menu option seems very tasty. I ended up ordering a New York strip steak. My husband ordered bone in ribeye. We also ordered the Truffle fries, and the creamed spinach. However when the meals came to the table. Both of our states were not to the desired temperature. My dear husband wanted his medium rare and it was well done. I ordered a medium and mine was also almost well done. Very disappointed. The manager discounted us 1 Stake. And offered us desert. It was our anniversary anyway so they gave us the usual complementary type desert. So we opted for that rather than ordering a separate dessert ( but there was a bug just travelling across our plate). It was our anniversary as I said and I was pretty disappointed.  I do not think we will be returning. We've had better elsewhere.",

That too be honest felt a bit rushed and we could barely enjoy the bread basket and I could not enjoy my soup! I do want to say the turkey dinner was very good and they were willing to serve us more if we wanted. Please Capital Grille even though it was a holiday and I realized the food was plated already please do not rush your customers it honestly makes me not want to come to your restaurant again.  Great view of the strip though",

Our waiter, David, was on point. He excelled in making us feel welcome, gave great tips on the menu, and was, overall, a great ambasador for the venue. The food was amazing, as usual.

You know everything on the menu is going to be good, and you know the service is going to be good, and for most people it will be a *splurge* with as pricy a menu as any good steakhouse would have.   good for a romantic dinner for two or for a festive group. Elegant but not *whack you up side the head if you aren't in a jacket* dressy.   We found it by accident out walking one balmy evening on the strip. I looked up and saw the windows and could tell from the street what kind of experience it would be. Nothing that will surprise you or knock your socks off. Thats not what  The Capitol is about.

This Capital Grille location is superb.  I think Del Frisco's off-strip is the only place capable of besting C.G. in Vegas.  Absolutely superb execution.

The restaurant is very nice on the inside, and has windows throughout that overlook the strip.  I recommend asking for a seat by the window, as you will have a nice view.  I really can't say enough good things about the food here.  I believe this was my wife's favorite meal of the trip, and we were there for an entire week.  My wife and I split the caesar salad, while my mom got the spinach salad.   Each was very good.  You can definitely split the salad's, as one if almost too much for one person.  Each of us ordered the filet for dinner, along with a side of au gratin potatoes.  The filet was cooked perfectly and tasted great.  The au gratin potatoes were some of the best I've had.  For dessert, we couldn't decide what we wanted, but ended up ordering the cheesecake.  Since we were having a hard time deciding, our waitress was nice enough to bring a complimentary coconut cream pie.  Each dessert was phenomenal.  This place is 5 stars all the way.  While it's a little pricey, it's definitely worth it.",

The appetizers were good, but small in portion.  The steaks were pretty good, but I honestly had better.  Cost was off the hook.  I'm not cheap, but to pay this much for a steak that I feel is better at another place is ridiculous.  Anyway, if you want to impress someone, take them here for the view of the strip, ambiance and the the high prices.  Don't forget to valet as well.  If you just want to eat a good steak, go elsewhere.",

Husband's filet mignon with Kona crust and shallot butter sauce, mine with Gorgonzola crust and Courvoisier cream sauce. As always steaks were cooked to perfection and the meal was absolutely divine!! Dessert coconut cream pie was delicious. In my opinion best steakhouse, always consistent.

We finally had to get the busser to assist us. Busser was great,  but the manager who came out had a real whatever attitude about it. Our initial waiter returned without saying a word, cleared our glasses of water and then stormed off w/o saying a word. He then threw hostile looks over at us, it was extremely awkward. Then they pulled him from our table and another waiter took his place. It was a big let down.",

The hostesses prepared a beautiful booth with a few topped with confetti & b-day card. Our server did his job, but nothing out of the world to remember his name. The girl server assistant was wonderful. I really can't remember her name? She made sure we had everything we need. I'm surprised she's not a server yet. We started of with the cold fish platte. OMG! it was so good. The oysters are fantastic. We had the spinach salad/ filet mignon/ Porter house. We got auto gratin potatoes/ lobster Mac n cheese/mushrooms. All very tasty. Overall love the experience.",

    "text": "My husband and I both agree this was more like 3.5 stars, but I'm rounding up for the service and he said he'd round down for some food issues.  Having said that, the rating is all relative to the prices, which as others have mentioned are quite steep ($50 per steak on average without sides), so expectations are high.   We celebrated our anniversary here, and they do a great job with special touches like table confetti and a hand written note. Service was warm, friendly and attentive.  We got the calamari to start, which was greaseless and plentiful but honestly lacked a ton of flavor. When eaten with the cherry peppers served on top, there was a nice heat to it, but not a ton of flavor besides those peppers.   Salads were Caesar- which was classic and perfect, and a caprese type salad that was spot on. Could have used a few more basil leaves than just the one it came with.   My husband got the steak special- a bone in filet that was dry aged. It wasn't that large (10 oz which I think may have included the bone? Not sure). So for $60 you'd pretty much expect perfection. It was flavorful, but was ordered medium and it was medium in some places (where it was tender as it should be) and closer to well done in others (where it was less tender of course). I was having some of this steak and don't mind the well done as much, so I ate those parts. We didn't complain or bring the cooking issue to the waiter's attention, and I'm sure they would've cooked us a new one had we done so. But we had a show to get to, so didn't want to wait.   Side was potatoes au gratin, which was good but not amazing. Had a subtle garlic flavor and nice cheesiness / creaminess with crunchy toppling.    Dessert was comped for our anniversary and was their coconut cream pie. Splendid. It was large and had a tasty, chewy, blonde-like crust. If you love whipped cream, you'll be in heaven with this.   Overall, an enjoyable meal with a great view of the strip. Not a total 4 star, and we'd probably come back, but might try a few other places first.",

I ate the steak Oscar, and the wife had a Cobb salad with sirloin steak.  This was an excellent meal, with superior service - basically everything one looks for in a Vegas experience.  On the way out I told Gina that my wife recommended a 7% tip, at which time Gina told me \"don't get hit by any cars on the strip\" (thankfully none hit me).  Gina got slightly more than 7% - as I was only kidding, and so was she.  I'm pretty sure we both had as much fun as adults can have while keeping their clothes on.  I would definitely return to this establishment.",

I really liked the atmosphere here.  Yeah, I know it's a chain, but this was my first time at CG, and I am not so cool that I cannot enjoy a well-done chain restaurant.  And this place is well done.  The bar area is nicely separated from the dining room and covered in dark wood paneling.  It looks like old money and you feel instantly classier sipping a dirty Grey Goose martini in the bar, which is exactly what we did.  After a drink, we were ready to be seated and start the feast.  The floor to ceiling windows ensure that the view is pretty great from any table in the room.  We started with oysters that were very fresh and salty.  5 stars.  We also brought a bottle of wine with us and the corkage fee of $25 was definitely lower than some other strip location restaurants.  Everything we had was wonderful but after that martini and a couple of glasses of wine, it gets a little fuzzy.  The only thing I can tell you for sure is the filet was great heated up for lunch the next day!",

It's a chain, but honors this town through its presidential portrait - inspired paintings of influential Nevadans and visitors to Las Vegas (Helen Stewart, Sarah Winnemucca and the Rat Pack, Howard Hughes, respectively). The service is top notch, impressive even to Las Vegas residents who are accustomed to a certain level of treatment. The food was wonderful - I loved my steak with the truffle crust and blue cheese topping, but next time will order a plain steak; I'm sure they'll do it \"right\" and it will shine without all the other flavors. Really nice personal touches, like learning our names and the little thank you note from the chef tied to the doggy bag.",

We came here on a Saturday night to celebrate a birthday and they truly gave us the royal treatment. They sat us by the window overlooking the Vegas Strip, had the table decorated with birthday confetti and birthday card, gave us complimentary tastings of two drinks, and provided a generous  sampling of their desserts with a birthday candle.   The server Dominic was amazing and extremely helpful in helping us decide on our meal for the evening. He was a significant contributor to why we had such a fantastic time. Not only was he helpful with food recommendations but he also gave us tips on which casino games were statistically more likely to pay out and also asked some of his colleagues for recommendations on where to go to get the most bang for our buck. We were sort of new to the whole gambling world and appreciated his insights.   The food was AMAZING. My friend whose birthday we celebrated stated that her bone in fillet was THE BEST steak she had ever had. I had the bone in NY strip with Gorgonzola and savoured it to the last bite. I was amazed that I had almost finished the entire strip. They cooked both steaks perfectly (med rare). We ordered the Brussel sprouts with bacon and the mushroom plate for our sides and really enjoyed both. We were glad not to have ordered something more heavy because we were stuffed by the end of the meal. My friend and I also shared a bottle of red that we absolutely loved also. I am so happy they include ratings for the wines that are rated 90 points or higher so we were able to choose a bottle that was guaranteed to be good. I even took a photo of the bottle so I can try to purchase it elsewhere. The trio of desserts they provided were amazing as well. Our favorite was the coconut cream pie but the cheesecake and chocolate cake were also delicious. I have absolutely no criticisms to offer because the entire experience was remarkable.   Thank you Dominic and The Capital Grill for providing such a wonderful experience for my friend's birthday. We will definitely be back.",

A nice touch-- if you are wearing black they will switch out your napkin so you don't get white lint on your clothes.  Touches like that make a difference.  One huge complaint--no apparent dress code.  I was in for a dinner service once where I was surrounded by people in jeans, sneakers, and baseball caps.  I don't appreciate that.  If I want to sit around and look at tables of people dressed all ghetto I'd have gone to the Peppermill (Not to knock the Peppermill;it can be fun at 4 a.m. when I am super drunk)  At least Ruth's Chris keeps it classy with a dress code.",

We were seated almost immediately at 7pm on a Sunday night. The server was very nice and answered alot of pointed questions about the menu and content. We both have dietary restrictions so we definitely put him through his paces. He never got frustrated with us even though we shared a few things. We both got salads. Mine was the chopped salad and was delightful. Then I got the filet mignon medium rare and my friend got the lobster tail. Mine was cooked to perfection and absolutely delicious. Sometimes simple is really best. Thank heavens the steak was way too much meat for me to eat so I didn't have to glare  piercingly at the basket of fresh warm rolls for long. Even so I'm relatively certain they turned to yucky charcoal under my gaze. We were too full to even complain about not getting to order dessert. I took the steak home for a yummy lunch the next day and all was well. Of course we got up to leave and I promptly left the steak at the table....I ran out front and by the time I got back to the table it was whisked away. But all the while they were chasing me down trying to give it too me. I thought that was a nice extra step. Even with the plethora of classic steakhouses out there...I would still go to Capital Grille again if the opportunity and desire arouse.",

Service is great, but A/V didn't work in the small meeting room we reserved. Shirmp cocktail was huge and fresh, dessert platter had cheesecake, chocolate cake and creme brule, awesome! While I didn't pay the bill myself, I know it was pricey.",

This place is a very manly steakhouse. Don't take your group of girls there!  It's all about fat hunks of aged beef grilled at extremely high temps and charred on the outside. Enjoy with a nice full Cabernet...  If you dare... the French onion soup (crock only please) is the BEST I've ever had (when I'm there on a good night... even when not it's excellent).   Go there with the guys and order what I always did... not on the menu anymore... 20 oz. NY Strip medium rare. If they say it's not on the menu insist! Don't worry about the size, take the rest home for a steak sandwich tomorrow... the key is the thickness of the meat. More like a mini roast that allows the outside to be nice and charred while the entire center is a really nice red.   Think 'that steak scene in the Matrix' (the movie) and you'll love this place.",

Our dinner on New Year's Eve started off like any other dinner we had done at the capital grille we sat down for dinner and our waitress was Amy she did wonderful job. Midway thru our dinner, a manager Matt stopped by to see how our dinner was going and we told him everything was great like always we finished our dinner our check was $220 we closed it out and then we went to the bar for drinks. At the bar we saw the same manager Matt with a young lady drinking cocktails. The woman's restroom was closed because someone was trapped in a stall. It was weird that a young girl was keeping my wife from going inside but there was no manager helping. The manager at the bar seemed oblivious or not concerned. After seeing this is and seeing the way the manager Matt behaved, I wouldn't recommend or go back. Food and server was good, but poorly managed. Don't use the bathrooms!!!",

    "text": "We ate there on a Saturday night, the place was jammed !! I've been to the one in Chicago many times, it's my favorite steak restaurant.  So, after a horrible experience the night before (see my other Las Vegas review), we decided to go to a place that we knew we could depend on.  Capital Grille Las Vegas is right across the street from The Wynn Hotel, so it was very convenient.  The seven  200lb men were very hungry after the bad meal we had the night before, and we weren't disappointed !     The bread and the appetizers were awesome as usual.   The spicy calamari is awesome.  Every place makes calamari, but there's is sauteed with peppers and it puts a new twist to the dish.  Also, the crab cakes were phenomenal.  The steaks were all made to perfection.  They know how to make a steak !  If you ask for it well done, they don't roll their  eyes and tell you that you're ruining it, or that the chef is going to be mad at you.  Good restaurants know how to make a well done steak tender AND juicy.   I had the  Porcini Rubbed Delmonico with 12-Year Aged Balsamic, medium well done.  It was one of the best steaks I ever had.  It was huge, I couldn't even finish the whole thing.  My friends at the table we're fighting for the scraps.  Our waiter and his staff were awesome.   It's hard to keep seven big guys happy,  but somehow they catered to all of our needs.  All in all, it was a great meal and I can still say I've never had a bad meal or a complaint at any Capital Grille.",

The cherry peppers are a perfect combo and always perfectly cooked. Even those who do not like calarmari always say it's great! If you're going to a steak house, you have to order a steak--all are great. Sides are amazing. If you like coconuts, the there's a fantastic dessert. Great wine selection. If you don't find just the perfect wine, ask for the captain's menu.   Service is always second to none. My fav server (John D) is gone :( but easily replaced with a few other alternates--Jimmy (handle bar moustache) and a newbie for me--Marc. They are all very friendly, fun and quite attentive. If everything doesn't come out just perfect, they ensure satisfaction.   There are many great things about this place and one of them, for sure, is consistency!  I always make this Capital Grille my choice whether entertaining for work or pleasure!",

We sat at the bar and the bartender and watched football, laughing at the bartender who was dying along with her team.

In between politicians kissing ass for my vote in DC, I went to my first Capital Grille just down from the Capital Building (no kidding) because it looked like a nice bar. And it was. Crammed chock full of political memorabilia, cigar smoke and wine, they also made a killer martini. Since I wore a short skirt, the martini's were free. What got me eating was the curious slabs of beef hanging in the window. \"Dry Aged\" is what they call it. This is not a new way of curing a steak but the very first way, pre-refrigeration, allowing the connective tissues to naturally decompose creating a very tender meat. I had what they call the Kona-Crusted Dry Aged Sirloin (or something like that) and it was fabulous! The meat melted in my mouth. Definitely a must return-to place. Then, I took a girlfriend to the Vegas one and down went the opinion polls even though I ordered the very same thing. Maybe it was the pretentious, lah-di-dah crowd waving $100 bills (newly-minted rubes from down in the holler?), the mall we had to wind through to get here fighting off aggressive Israeli \"Red Sea\" salt-crystal venders, or the over-the-top waiter (\"Eh, gulls, I killa fa yew\") and so-so steak (it obviously wasn't made for Ted Kennedy's gluttonous taste ) but that'll be an Aye vote for DC and a Nay vote for Vegas. Maybe the climate will change in '08...",

I started my meal with the salty and sour prosciutto wrapped melted Mozzarella that was evenly balanced with the sweetness of the mini vine ripe tomatoes and crostini.  I also had the garlicky fried calamari with cherry peppers.  It wasn't as spicy as I expected, but the tangy peppers added kick to the calamari.  For a salad, I had to have the stinky stuff....sweet onions on thick slices of tomatoes that was sprinkled with a Vinaigrette and roquefort cheese...so delicious.  I followed this with the Porcini Rubbed Delmonico Steak with 8-Year Aged Balsamic.  I asked for a medium which turned out a little more drier and cooked than I expected.  It seems they run more on the well done side, rather than most restaurants running mor to the rare side.  This brought it down to 3 stars.  I also accompanied the steak with some creamed spinach and potatoes au gratin.  The stars went back to 4 after finishing off with.the most delicious coconut cream pie. Each bite had the crunches of roasted coconut shavings mixed with perfect sweetness of coconut cream.  Oh yeah, this place also serves Samuel Smith Old Brewery Pale Ale.",

Was there last night for a business dinner and sat by the window with some nice view, even though it's not located very high up in the building. It's sitting across from the shopping center so you can also get some shopping done afterwards to walk off the rich meal.  Too bad I didn't snap any pictures, but this was a work dinner and I had to behave...  Everyone else ordered some sort of steak dish except for me. I got the citric glazed salmon, which was juicy, medium rare and cooked perfectly. The steak dishes are pricey but the portions were actually not very huge. Everyone finished all their meat so apparently they were all happy with how their steak was cooked. I did get to taste their beef as I ordered the steak tartar appetizer and it was fresh and tender and seasoned well too.  We also shared fried calamari, lobster macaroni (yum!), steak tartar and grilled asparagus (bland). Loved the warm bread basket before the meal. Fancy decor (classic dark wood) and we shared a bottle of 2009 red wine from Napa.  The chef sent us three yummy desserts even though we didn't order any: cheesecake (rich and just the right amount of tartness to balance the sweetness), chocolate ganache cake (smooth, deep, chocolaty) and creame brulee (light and fresh custard) with assorted berries. I only have one word for all three desserts: PERFECTION. Not bad if you have a friend who knows the chef. Again I wish I had taken a photo. ..",

Cooked perfectly medium rare, with the juices hitting the plate even before the initial bite. The horseradish sauce is very subtle but adds a nice touch to a very well seasoned burger. Not sure if they use aged meat, but it tastes like it! Truffle fries are good but not great....a little light with the truffle oil.   The aged steak was ok...didn't have the punch most aged steaks have imo.  It was cooked well, but didn't have the flavor explosions goin on in each bite.  The salad was pretty good surprisingly, since I don't usually eat the greens :P   Third Course : Flourless Chocolate Espresso Cake OR Creme Brulee OR The Capital Grille Handcrafted Ice Cream OR Chef's Seasonal Fruit Sorbet   Chocolate Cake was super rich and thick but tasty!

    "text": "My husband and I have been to The Capital Grille in Atlanta, New York and Washington DC and this one is the WORST of them all!  Don't get me wrong, their food were still great especially their steaks - very juicy and flavorful; keep the two stars just for their steaks. That's why I'm still keeping the 3 stars for their steaks and side dishes.   Here were what we've experienced that disappointed us:  1 - Front desk hostesses: unfriendly, didn't greet us when we arrived or even say a word; we stood  and waited for 1min and walked closer to them to say \"hi\", then they asked \"reservation?\" without a smile. We said \"Yes, reservation at 7pm\" then they looked at the book and said \"just a moment\" and we stood and waited aside for a good 8min before they led us to a table.  2 - Our female server walked back and forth busy serving other tables and we were seated at the table for 12min, Seriously? You can't just come by to take drink orders or even just ask us to give a few more minutes?  3 - She was very impatience; we wanted to ask for the best bottle of wine for our food, she didn't get us the correct wine menu so she had to go get it a couple of times and gave us a weird unhappy look then she returned and said \"you might need a moment to look, I'll be back\" then walked away. Hence, we waited for another 10min before we ordered our drink.  4 - Food-wise, everything was perfect until dessert; we ordered their creme brule and that's what we always order; however, when it came, the entire creme brule was freezing cold and firm! Usually the bottom egg part is soft and cold with warm top sugar crust that is freshly made to order. It looked and tasted like something they put in the fridge overnight (perhaps someone didn't want it). So we told our server, she didn't even look/check the creme brule and immediately said \"it IS how we do it, you can talk to our manager if you want\"  Oh my lord! Really?! That pissed my husband off so badly! So of course we wanted to speak to their manager; the manager came and first he said the same thing that it was how they do it without checking it, we asked him to look closer and he started to realize the weird firmness of the brule. He started to apologize and to bring a freshly made one out to us, and removing the brule from the check.  As much as we love The Capital Grille in other cities, we will definitely pass this one and not recommend to anyone.",

I highly recommend the cold shellfish platter with oysters, the bone-in filet (which is not on the menu but usually always a special), lobster mac, and their cheesecake. I tried a new after dinner drink that was recommended to me by Erik (great service you should ask for him) is called the Carajillo... just do it. It's amazing.   We usually show up around 6:30pm to get the best view of the strip. bon appetit. :)",

We were recommended to order 2-3 appetizers by our waiter but we ended up ordering one because we knew we can't eat that much and came here to eat steaks not appetizers. Glad we didn't order 2-3 appetizers because it was just right amount for all of us. We ordered Caramari and it was very good. He also said we should order 3 sides to share with everyone. We ordered French fries, Brussels sprouts and asparagus according to his advise. The Brussels sprouts was on point!  Upon getting entrees, we were already overwhelmed how big our steak was. We ended up not able to finish most of the steaks and sides.  Steaks were good, and sides were good but the volume was too much even though two of us shared the one entree.  I felt like our waiter was recommending many extra food and trying to get more money from us.   Also there was a big party in the party room. We didn't like people standing right behind us when we were enjoying our dinner.   I made a reservation for this party well in advance but the location of our table was in front of the big screen by the window. It can be pretty at night but we were having hard time because flashing of lights wasn't good for our eyes.",

My last visit introduced me to the best Waiter in Las Vegas, Mr Frankie Storione.  Frankie is the best, not only is he an absolute expert on the menu, but he has to be one of the most entertaining people I have met in a long time.  You have a guest for life Frankie!  Thanks for making a great evening out with my friends even better.  I highly recommend requesting Frankie the next time you dine with Capital Grille.",

The knife slid into the meat like butter. It was cooked exactly how I asked for. The sides, mashed potatoes and lobster mac, were equally as delicious. The lobster chunks were fresh and not chewy, like I've experienced at other restaurants. This is really as good as it gets for steak, and the service was also exceptional. Other restaurants should look here for what to do, it's all too common to experience bad food at high end restaurants when that should not be the case.",

The porcini dusted rib eye was a perfect size to split with my wife and was as rich as it sounds with the added balsamic. Especially after the crab/lobster cakes and Caesar salad shared plates. The au graten potato's were not cooked enough for our us but still was tasty. Our sons  Kona crusted steak is not really as advertised. Not very crusted and not very seasoned    It was over cooked so maybe that contributed to the less than stellar plate. The free champagne and free bday desserts made up for the misses.",

The 2 hostess ladies were lovely and congratulated us on our wedding. We were seated and waited a few minutes until someone came by and asked if we would like something to drink. We order waters to start since there was no drink menu on the table. The bread soon followed and was delicious. The waters were delivered and we kept waiting for our server to come by . Finally the gentleman that asked for our drink order came by again and asked if we were ready to order. I was a bit confused bc I wasn't sure if he was our server as no one had introduced themselves. I asked him \"oh are you our server?\" He responded \"yes\"........well alrighty. I wished he would've been a bit nicer. We felt dismissed and as if him waiting on our table was an annoyance. I'm not sure if it's because we look young and maybe can't tip well? But looking at how attentive he was to other tables and friendly, it put a slight damper on our night. He didn't come back to our table until he were almost done with our meal. A check in once or twice would've been nice to refill our waters. The food was amazing. We ordered the chefs seafood appetizer, veal tomahawk, rack of lamb, mashed potatoes and Brussels sprouts. Brussels sprouts were AMAZING. The 4 stars is for the food. I really can't give anything lower despite the disappointment in service. I would come back again bc I know their service is top notch. It was a miss today and that was unfortunate. :(",

I called to make reservations only a few hours before we arrived on a Saturday evening.  When asked if we would be there for a special occasion, I mentioned that we were celebrating our engagement.  Fast forward to our reservation time. The four of us were led to a table that was decorated with red heart confetti and had a greeting card congratulating us (see photo).  Wow, that's quite a welcome! Mike, our server, was fantastic and made us all feel special the entire meal. After starters of bread and Caesar salad, I had the Filet, Oscar-style, with a generous portion of lump crab and bearnaise sauce.  Everything was delicious.  This place is very busy, but we had attentive service throughout the meal.  The happy ending was the complimentary dessert of cheesecake and a chocolate cake:  thank you, CG!   If you want to celebrate a special occasion in style and taste, come here.  If you want to read the rhyme, see my fiance's review for the same place, under Mel C.    Cheers, The Future Mrs. C.",

I'll miss his funny small talk; memories of how his mother used to make his bed so tight that it made him feel as though he were sleeping in an envelope. And, to this day when he stays in a hotel he asks housekeeping to please not tuck his bed sheets in. Laughable indeed. We were given complimentary champagne for my bday that I mentioned was a few weeks prior. That put a huge smile on our face. Then, came out a goat cheese and apple amuse-bouche; a wonderful thank you from the chef to wet our pallets. Loved the garlic flavored warm bread served complimentary prior to the meal. We shared a fantastic bone in ribeye which had been marinated in an aged balsamic vinaigrette. It was wonderful. The star of the show from my fiance's perspective were the au gratin potatoes. I'd have to agree they were very good, just a bit rich for my taste that evening. The star of the show from my perspective last 100 percent lead lobster bisque. I was absolutely in love with the large chunks of lobster in my bisque. I'll be dreaming of this soup throughout the winter season.  The service was over the top of spectacular. The food was absolutely fantastic and it was an enjoyable New Year's eve atmosphere.  Bravo Capital Grille! I'm a fan once again!",

Two of us ordered Gorgonzola crusted filets, and 2 ordered seafood.  Both of the fish dishes were amazing, and our wives were very happy!  All the sides were incredible (MUST get the Brussels sprouts!!), and the deserts were just fantastic.  There was a small issue with my steak, wasn't cooked as ordered (which the waitress strongly agreed with), but what impressed me most was how they responded!  The manager personally came out and issued apologies on behalf of the kitchen, made it up to us with a food comp, and the new steak was prepared and tableside within 6-7 minutes.  No harm, no foul!  These things happen... how they respond is what sets places apart!  He seemed genuinely upset and embarrassed, not just typical lip service.    Overall, fantastic experience and we'll be coming back for sure!  Highly recommended for parties that want both great steak and seafood options!!",

    "text": "We spent my birthday here and it was amazing. It was the right choice for a special occasion like this one. We had a reservation and the host brought us to our table where it was designed to show they were making my birthday unforgettable.  From the birthday design on the table, the handwritten birthday card to the birthday wishes at the end of the meal, everything was perfect. Our server Michael M. was upbeat and attentive. The food choices were good. It took us almost 15 Min to choose our entree coz everything sounded so good. The crab cake and calamari appetizers were so good! Our entrees tasted amazing. Best steak I have tried in a long time. I got the Tenderloin with lobster which was cooked to perfection. Everything was just right. It was a little pricey but was worth it all. The view of the strip was just the right ambience too. I would definitely recommend this place.",

He was an excellent server, one of the best by far.  He made us feel at home and special as we celebrated our anniversary.   The food was excellent.  I had the 22 oz Ribeye, my wife the Filet & Lobster. Both were fantastic and cooked exactly to our preference. The atmosphere was quiet and allowed for great conversation without loud music and background noise. We were both too full for dessert but Jeff insisted that we have a special treat on Capital Grille.  Wow, I'm diabetic but the dessert was fantastic.. I can't think of another word to describe it!  It was delicious.    We will be back on our next visit to Las Vegas.  Again our thanks to Jeff for making it a very special evening.",

    "text": "Wow! I was totally blown away by my Easter brunch at The Capital Grille. Originally I was sort of bummed by my husband's Easter choice, but I ended up pleasantly surprised. The food and service definitely rated up there with the other fine steakhouses where I've dined in the past.  We made a reservation for the start of brunch service and were promptly seated next to the window. The window gave some nice people watching opportunities while we dined. The atmosphere of the restaurant was upscale, but not in a stuffy way. It was nice that other diners had dressed nicely for the occasion and the restaurant was drawing a classy crowd.  The service was very attentive from beginning to end. Our waiter was friendly, drinks were constantly refilled, plates were cleared regularly, and our meal flowed nicely. Not a single hiccup with the service. The manager/owner(?) was also walking around checking on each table which is always a nice touch.  Brunch began with a Bellini and the bread basket. My Bellini didn't disappoint and I enjoyed the breads. I opted for the Bibb Salad that had plenty of greens, dried cherries, blue cheese, and vinaigrette. It was a simple salad, but well prepared. My husband enjoyed his Caesar salad as well.  My entree was what really impressed me. I had the 8 oz. Filet Mignon with mashed potatoes. My steak was the perfect size and perfectly prepared to medium rare as I requested. The seasoning had a wonderful flavor as well. I would say this was one of the best steaks I've ever had. The mashed potatoes had great flavor and a nice creaminess. My husband had the Lobster Frittata. This was served with a potato cake layer, frittata layer, and more lobster on top. Beautiful presentation and delicious as well. The truffled hollandaise was served on the side without even requesting it which was a nice touch.  I ventured out a little with dessert and went with the Espresso Chocolate Cake. This was very rich and had more of a fudge like consistency. I enjoyed it, but I think two could split it since it is so rich. My husband's Creme Brulee had a strong custard flavor and fresh berries on top. He loved this dessert.  I've been missing out by passing on this spot for years. Absolutely awesome service and food.",

I have definitely been to Capital Grille on many other occasions and they have always been Great with a Capital G. I booked my reservation through yelp and received a call the day before to confirm.  We were sat in the middle of the main floor and requested we be sat next to the window and they had zero problems accommodating us.  Capital Grille is a real deal 5 Star steak dining experience. For brunch they offered a pre-fixed menu $50 a person with an option for endless mimosas or Bellini for $15. We ordered the Steak and eggs which was cooked to perfection. If you go to Capital Grille and like steak it's definitely the way to go but if you are more of a pescatarian you can't go wrong eating at this place either. I always order the shrimp cocktail and lump crab cake as an appetizer they have other great appetizers tuna carpaccio steak tartar amazing salads and more. I top that off with the surf n turf with mashed potatoes.  The brunch menu was a treat since they aren't normally open for brunch but we ordered shrimp and grits along with the grill lobster on top of some delicious quiche yummmm! The lobster and shrimp portions were more than enough as I left very satisfied and full to say the least. Capital Grille you know I will be back.!",

They really want to make your experience awesome and it always is! I love their food! I like how they have healthy options too like their salmon salad which is so delicious! Get it! :)  It is a little pricey, but I think for the type of restaurant, the food is reasonably priced and it is so good! Their bathroom is really nice too! Super clean and is very nice!

    "text": "When I think of business dinners, I think of Capital Grille. The dish that stands out the most at this steakhouse is the NY strip. The bone-in Kona coffee-crusted dry aged NY strip with shallot butter is a must try. For an off-the-bone option, try the 14 oz. NY strip au poivre with courvoisier cream. Both are delicious with their accompanying sauces. The earthy roasted wild mushrooms are the perfect side. I also enjoyed the mashed potatoes and the green beans.  For appetizers, the steak tartare was beautifully prepared. The lobster and crab cakes are small in size, but the side of roasted corn was delicious. Like any fine steakhouse, there's a great wedge salad. The bleu cheese isn't too overwhelming and the smoked bacon is more cubed than crumbs.   Save room for dessert because the cheesecake brulee is excellent and even better than the classic creme brulee. The flourless chocolate espresso cake is a rich and decadent gluten-free option that is sure to please both gluten and non-gluten eaters alike. All around, the service is top notch and the drinks are great too. Unlike a lot of steakhouses on the Strip, most of their steaks are reasonably priced in the $50 range. It's an expensive meal for sure, but you get your bang for your buck and will leave stuffed.",

She took it away and about 15 minutes later brought me another steak that was medium, not medium rare   Their line cook clearly doesn't understand how to cook steaks  The outer edges were terrible and the inside was just edible   My husband doesn't even know how to turn on the oven   He can absolutely cook a steak to medium rare, it's basic and this restaurant can't even cook a medium rare steak, I would've sent it back the second time if I hadn't been with friends   This restaurant and their staff is a hard skip!!!!",

We were seated right away with no wait which was great    Our server was Michael awesome server very friendly  (talked a little fast sometimes I missed a few things he said but not a big deal )   We started with the coldfish platter was super yummy came with crab lobster oysters crab claws and shrimp a perfect mixture and enough so everyone can have some of each which is great    My grandma got the ribeye which was a big portion I was surprised at the size but that's great to pay for a steak and get a great size no one will complain about that!!! She LOVED her steak cook just how she liked it !! Wasn't dry I could see it had juices! I ordered the sea ball YUMMY (I eat a lot of steak when I go to steak houses) so I wanted to try something else.... But I must say I was very happy the sauce was perfect made the fish nice and juicy we got side orders of mash potatoes I LOVED Them I couldn't stop eating them... And a side of mushrooms we saved room for desert so we got some doggy bags   We got the warm chocolate cake it was good not my favorite of the night but it was yummy!!!   I would come back (my bill was around 300$) but it was worth it plus anything to see my grandma smile",

Our meal was prepared to perfection.  Our waiter was excellent in assisting us with our order.  2 sides with our meal to share was more then enough.  The atmosphere was very nice we felt bad as were in very casual wear (shorts and t-shirts) they never batted an eye and treated us as though were dressed for an evening out.  We definitely recommend this restaurant.  It was a bit tough to find as we had to walk thru the mall food court and then outside the 3rd floor doors.",

Although we arrived a few minutes early, we were seated immediately by a very gracious hostess who wished my friend a Happy Birthday on the way to our table.  The table itself was decorated with multi-colored shiny hearts and balloon shaped shiny ornaments. There was also a birthday card from the restaurant.  The restaurant itself is beautiful. It is all dark woods with classically set tables and highly trained wait staff.   We started with a shrimp cocktail and pan fried calamari with peppers. The shrimp were colossal sized and cooked (boiled or steamed) to perfection. They were extremely fresh and had the texture that can only be obtained from fresh shrimp. The calamari was one of the best dished that I have ever had and those who know me are aware that those words rarely come out of my mouth. Crunchy and crispy perfectly pan fried calamari in a mixture of various peppers. This dish is not for the faint of heart because it was spicy. But great spicy. The kind of spicy that makes you think it hurts so good.  For main courses we ordered the swordfish topped with a mixture of crab and a 22 ounce rib eye that was rubbed with porcini mushrooms. It was served mid rare exactly as ordered and was absolutely a culinary treat. I have had porcini before and of course I have eaten deliciously aged rib eyes but the combination of the two made for a memorable experience.  Capital Grille brought out a birthday dessert containing pieces of their famous creme brulee style cheesecake and a chocolate cake. Cocktails were perfectly prepared and even the coffee was special.  This is a perfect place for a special occasion, a date or just a great meal. Finally I have to mention that the service was exemplary.",

I made a reservation in advance and asked for a table with a view of the strip, and they were able to accommodate my request. We had to move our reservation back twice due to circumstances beyond our control... and they adjusted our reservation time with no problem. We started with a bottle of moscato and calamari for our appetizer. For our meal my SO and I each ordered the bone-in ribeye and shared creamed spinach, lobster mac & cheese, and mashed potatoes. The ribeye was easily the best steak I've ever had, it was seasoned & cooked to perfection. The sides were all wonderful. They definitely did not skimp on the lobster in the mac & cheese. They gave me a birthday dessert plate with a chocolate cake and a cheesecake. I didn't care for the chocolate cake but the cheesecake was great. Our meal came to just under $215 and it was worth every penny. i can't wait to go back!",

There is baked Parmesan in their assortment of bread along with a warm roll dusted with sesame seeds, I could have made a meal out of the breads.    The wedge salad was huge, easily split between two people, and the Lobster bisque was wonderful.

I ordered medium rare and I could taste everything from rare to well done. Yes. Well done. That said, it was seasoned and charred pretty well. I would recommend this place and I will revisit them if I go to vegas again and give them another chance. I think next time I will try a smaller piece of meat.

This is the 4th Capital Grille I visit and the service and food is always stellar.   My friend ordered the filet mignon and I ordered the citrus glazed salmon which is to die for. To share, we got the asparagus, a nice bottle of wine that was recommended by our server and the delicious cheesecake. The cheesecake is my all time favorite desert. The top is caramelized just like creme brulee. I would say it's heavenly.   I will continue to go to Capital Grille every time I'm near one.   Thank you Jason for the great service!",

    "text": "Went here on a Saturday night, had reservations with a friend of mine.  They were great, we got stuck in a monster track jam and our cabbie had to go through the backroads so we were running late for the reservation but checking in along the way.  We showed up about 20 minutes late and, fortunately, they still seated us.  It wasn't super crowded at that point but it packed in right after.    The decor is nice and relaxing with a chill view.  It's not like a \"fake\" or forced Vegas experience, I don't think.  Just a nice steakhouse overlooking the back end of the strip.  We got a great waiter - Frankie.  It has to be part of a schtick but he looks and acts like a combo of Joe Pesci and Robert De Niro, ya know, the \"badda bing New Yahk\" thing.  Great guy, funny... very honest about the menu.  He told me the special and then said, \"But don't get that... get this...\"  I'm totally blowing it on this review, as I saved it a while ago but didn't finish it, but I forgot exactly what steak I got... sorry!  But, it was just stupid good.  My friend got a different kind - also amazing.  We had a combo of sides and starters, like salads, mashed potatoes, veggies, etc.  All good.  I get the impression that you can't go wrong here.  I'd definitely recommend but get a reservation - just to be safe.    Tip... don't try to find the damn hidden elevator in the parking garage below... you'll waste 15 minutes on a wild goose chase... just walk up the little stairs to the blvd, then take the escalator up.",

To top it off, they say us in the very corner window table and the view was so beautiful. Our server Alex was just so great! Knowledgable, sincere, and generous! He bought us dessert because he knew we would say \"no\" if he asked. Lol. What a wonder man, AND FROM LBC! :)  We will definitely be back again!",

We have always received great service and good food.  Came her for my wife's birthday and they had decorations set out on the table and made it extra special.  Will definitely be returning.  If you request it you can get a table by the window overlooking the strip.  Great view during the evening hours.  Only downfall is it is located at the fashion show mall.  They offer valet but during busy hours it get full.  You can park in the parking garages but it is quite a walk.  Makes it nice after dinner because you can walk your meal off a little.  Even with the parking it will not stop us from coming back.",

I can't say enough good things about their signature drink...the Stoli Doli. It's pineapple infused vodka. Can be a bit dangerous after a while, since it tastes like a lighter, more refreshing pineapple juice. Bethany was awesome! She is friendly and knows how to have a good conversation.

For the main course, we had a 10oz fillet mignon and 14oz sirlion steak. For dessert, we finished off with creme brulee and a flourless chocolate espresso cake.    - I had to park next to the green at the Fashion Show mall to get here. Went up an escalator and out the food court and into Capital Grille.  - Great service. Servers greeted me with a glass of white wine and took my order promptly.  - Wagyu beef was finely sliced. Reminds me of when I go to a korean BBQ or Japanese restaurant. Nice presentation and nice flavor. - The wedge salad was interesting. Litterally a chopped head. Don't think you're expected to finish all of it, but if you managed to do so, good for you. haha.  - The steak and fillet mignon were excellent! Very juicy and tender. High recommendation. But if I had to chose, I go with the sirloin over the fillet.  - We had mashed potatoes, mushrooms and green beans for side. Taste like any other steak restaurant to me, equivalent Mastro's.  -  The desserts were sweet. Excellent presentation. Just what I expected.",

    "text": "I came here with my boyfriend for a late Valentine's day date on Sunday night. It was my first time here and I loved it. Erik was our server and he made amazing suggestions from the menu. We ordered everything he suggested and we were not disappointed.   For drinks my boyfriend ordered a beer and Erik suggested a pineapple infused vodka drink that was served straight up in a chilled martini glass. It was delicious. The perfect blend of tangy and sweet.   For appetizers, we ordered the lobster bisque and the wedge salad. Erik added some sherry to my lobster bisque at the table that really brought out the rich flavor of the soup. I had a couple bites of the wedge salad and it was crisp and refreshing. Both were perfect portions.  For our entrees we had the Delmonico steak which is their bone in rib eye and the Filet Oscar which was a filet topped with blue crab meat and a Bearnaise sauce served with asparagus spears. Both entrees tasted amazing. The rib eye had excellent flavor and even the slight char from the grill tasted good. The crab meat on the Fillet Oscar was sweet and the flavors flowed together perfectly.  We also shared the sides of creamed spinach and creamy mashed potatoes. They complimented our meals nicely and tasted really fresh.  We were too stuffed to try dessert but I had my eye on every creme brulee that passed by. Next time I will make sure to save room for it. We ended our meal with a coffee and an espresso.  The manager stopped by our table to ask how our meal was which is always a nice touch to see managers engaging with the guests dining in their establishment. There is also a great sense of teamwork among the servers. Many times I saw other servers clearing tables that weren't their own or grabbing dirty dishes out of another server's hands while he was at another table speaking with his guests. It's nice to see the wait staff help each other out and care about the appearance of the restaurant and the service being provided to all guests, not just their own.  If you're looking for a great meal with a gorgeous view of the strip lit up at night and even better service, come here for dinner. Ask to sit in Erik's section. He'll ensure you have a great experience and leave you wanting to come back again.",

    "text": "Let me preface my statements by saying that I love the Denver Capital Grill as much as I hate the Vegas Cap Grille. Since they have been taken over by the Olive Garden people, I did write management, so I'll update the review once I hear back from corporate.  So why no love for the Vegas location?? To begin with, our lousy waiter.  He complained to us the whole time.   Save it buddy.  I'm out in 110 Vegas heat, and want a cool, inviting experience.  Even though we told him we're Denver regulars, he treated us like tourists.  Ignored us for a couple of local women who obviously drink there often. Our service went from bad to horrible after I ordered the $13 glass of wine instead of the $23 glass he recommended.   Up sell someone else.  I know my wines, and will not pay $23 a glass for a $23 a bottle of wine.   ( I know...I know, my $13 a glass is $13 a bottle, but we all have our price points). Bad service aside, my lobster bisque was lukewarm at best; globby and mediocre.  The sherry accompaniment never came, so we had to flag the waiter.  10 minutes later, someone from the kitchen brought it.  By that time, the soup was really cold. The BF's burger was perfect cooked -- medium rare and huge. However the fries were inedible.    The waiter never appeared with the check, so I flagged him down on my way to the rest room, and signed on my way back. Unfortunately, he kept my credit card... I've always said, customer service will either make or break a business, and the way the Capital Grille handled the error is 1 star. The next day I returned for the card ( a $40 round trip cab ride).  The manager who was holding the card was tacky; not in a hurry to return the card, so we sat down for lunch.   Finally he arrived at our table, and had the nerve to suggest I offer a reward. Reward??? How about tearing up the check for the previous day.  Or at least comping up lunch that day.  Your waiter caused us great inconvenience, and for what?  A mediocre lunch, terrible service, and a huge price tag.  I'm hoping that corporate has a better 'tude, since I still want to patronize the Denver location  ps We were \"invited\" back for lunch......AT THE VEGAS LOCATION. Sure, let me jump in my corporate jet and lunch in Vegas. Thanks for nothing. Typical Olive Garden mentality....that's what Darden Corporation is making the Cap Grille.   You have just won my tacky award",

One of our friends was hungry, and didn't realize he had to wait for the spiel before he could order. He asked one of our servers if he could order, and he responded \"no\" and walked away. Lobster bisque had too much flour, flavorless really. Oysters were good, but nobody stopped to explain if they were pemaquid or kumamoto., and left before we could ask. The seared tenderloins were super tough. Filet  mignon was good. Sauteed mushrooms needed salt, the asparagus was overcooked. The only high point of the meal was the lobster mac' n cheese. Absolutely delicious with perfect crumb topping. I did ask to have some of our sides boxed up, and a server accidentally threw them out. Without any questions, they did prepare new sides for us to take - which was really nice, but I might stick to Mastro's instead next time",

We were seated by a window with a great view. Rose petals decorated the table. Four of us were served sparkling wine (gratis), and the celebrants were presented with a card. We  dined on chowder and French onion soup with our assortment of fresh breads. The salmon was moist and tender; swordfish delicate and flavorful. Four generous lamb chops and filet rounded out our varied selections. We   shared fantastic au gratin potatoes and creamed spinach. Then the  waiter brought a dessert platter for the anniversary couple which they  shared after extinguishing the candles. We loved the light cheesecake,  chocolate cake, and berries with our coffee. Dessert was also comped.  Wonderful service was provided throughout. Minor criticism: coffee was a  bit weak. This is top notch dining and well worth the price.",

I'm not complaining on anything i just think at the high end restaurant like this i walk in expecting great service and food, but to say i give 5 will be overrated. i've only had very few 5 star experience and this could well be one of them being in the lovely atmosphere and the service, but i don't think it was a five star food, and even though my steak was cooked the way i wanted it and the decor of the plate was very nice, i've had better steaks, although their sides were surprisingly delicious! i think i think its fair to give 4 stars but i don't know if i'll be back there unless i get invited out.",

Seared perfectly.  The salmon was excellent, crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. It didnt have a sauce so no need to lick the plate.  Charles was our waiter. He talked with his hands, very passionate, appreciated his enthusiasm and professionalism.  I gave it 5 stars because it was a great dining experience with excellent service. We wanted to sit by the window and people watch the strip, but after awhile, we forgot the strip was below us.   Definitely a go to place while in Vegas. You can walk off your meal at the mall and spend some more money. Why not. Better than putting it down a strippers g string??? Or is it?????",

    "text": "The only reason why Brad T. & I decided to go here because we have received a coupon/deal for $50 off % 2 complimentary desserts.  We called ahead for a reservation on a Monday or Tuesday night & it was a busy night due to a convention that was in town.   FOOD (4.2 out of 5) Appetizers: Calamari: Good, I wouldnt bother ordering it again,  Entree: Mine: I ordered the seared tenderloin with butter poached lobster tail.  I always get my steaks medium rare and this tenderloin was absolutely perfect.  The taste was very juicy and succulent.  The lobster tail did not have much flavor to it, but it still tasted good but not as amazing as the tenderloin.  I savored the taste of the tenderloin ohhh how lovely it tasted.   His: Filet mignon w. crab meat: I took a bite of his filet mignon and from I remembered it was a bit overcooked but thats (Brad T.'s story to tell), I loved the taste of the crab meat though! MMMMmmm  Desserts: (Since it was complimentary)  I was astonished how huge the desserts were!   Coconut Creme Pie:  I personally did not like it very much,  I felt like it was too creamy for me.  I had a few bites here and there and the taste is good but I couldnt handle eating more of it.  Chocolate hazelnut cake: Loving chocolate, I enjoyed the cake alot. It wasn't very sweet at all & of course I had to take it home.  I couldnt finish it all.  SERVICE (4 out of 5)  The hostesses were very professional.   Our server was sweet.  She was okay in the beginning but she got better as the night went on.  We normally dont require much attention as long as our water is refilled we are pretty much set for the rest of the night.    ATMOSPHERE (3.8 out of 5)  It was a busy night full of commotion and talks and laughter filled the room.  I enjoyed it.  I like the paintings/portraits on the wall and they had a locker for wine which was pretty cool.   OVERALL (4 out of 5) I liked it here, but it wont be my first choice that I would go to if I wanted to eat out.",

After endless time searching on opentable I stumbled across the capital grille! I've eaten at plenty of their other locations in other cities and I must say that the consistency in excellent food and service has never failed! Upon arriving we were kindly greeted by a gentleman and a young lady who checked us in! I requested a table near the window so we could take in the fantastic views of the strip! We were briefed on our table being ready in a few moments and invited to have a few drinks at the bar! I asked the bartender what was a popular drink and he suggested the \"Stolli Dolli\" YUCK! I don't know how that drink could even be on the menu as a favorite but then again to each is own right? Anyways I went with my regular Hennessy & Sprite and we also ordered a mojito.. Both drinks were just \"OK\" and for $29 I wouldn't expected a lot more needless to say that bar experience was not as good as the dining experience! Once we were seated we were now greeted by our fabulous waiter JEFF! This guy is beyond an amazing and provides some of the upmost world class customer service! He truly made our dining experience a memorable one! The food was delicious! For starters the calamari was out of this world good!! Entrees we went with the Surf & Turf which consisted of I believe a 9oz Lobster Tail and 10oz Filet Mignon, Delmonico Steak and the Lobster Mac N Cheese! Put it this way we had no left overs and even had room for dessert! Above all this experience will definitely have us returning for more!",

I suggest you skip it if you're looking for takeout.  I got a filet which was cooked correctly but was not a $50 steak. I've had better for half the price. When I picked it up the kid who brought it out had not thought to include utensils. Luckily the friendly bartender asked him, but when I got back to my hotel I found this kid's idea of takeout utensils was three forks. So I got to tear apart my steak like some sort of well off caveman.   The night prior, the Italian place one floor down packaged my food well, included bread and butter and separated cold desert from warm dinner into two bags. Looking for takeout in the area? Try Maggiano's before this place.",

However, Once everyone got their check  everything that was said to be complementary was actually charged. I felt I was just it was deceitful however we did not want to make a big deal about it.

The male host was very friendly and knowledgeable. He answered questions about the wine lockers and kept us engaged while we waited to be seated. When we made it to our table, there were cute confetti hearts and a hand written card from the restaurant congratulating us on our anniversary. It was a really nice touch and very appreciated. Our server Frank was AMAZING! Hands down the best service we have ever received! Frank provided us with complementary champagne, a nice bite of a smoked salmon dish, and cheesecake. He anticipated things that we wouldn't have thought of. When he marked the table before our appetizer, he brought an extra soup spoon in case I wanted to try my husband's soup. This was extremely thoughtful. As busy as he was with a larger table, he never missed a beat with us and was constantly checking in and bringing more things to try to the table. He continually offered to take pictures of us so we had souvenirs for the night and maintained hilarious and personal conversations with us throughout the night so we felt like old friends. The food was outstanding and cooked to perfection. The evening was the highlight of our anniversary weekend and I appreciate the staff of Capital Grille at Fashion Show mall for their generous hospitality. We will be back soon!",

And luckily for us, the Capital Grille is the fanciest place to eat at the mall.   It's got a great view of the Wynn and the strip, and at lunch, this place is full of power lunchers. I think my friend and I were the only two not dressed in suits, but that did not at all mean we experienced any subpar service.   We split steak tartare - I looooove the preparation here. And it takes some time because they chop it up fresh for you! I won't give it away, but there are pictures...   I had the lobster salad for lunch. I just couldn't handle more meat after the indulgent weekend I had. But it was still indulgent, for seafood. My friend had the steak cobb. And it was perfect - the steak was basically on the side. If I had known that, it would've been what I ordered. Just a little bit of steak, with a bit of salad (and avocado, blue cheese WEDGE, all the good cobb stuff).   Capital Grille Strawberries for dessert. A perfect sendoff from Vegas!",

My filet mignon was cooked perfectly and quite tasty, though not particularly exciting flavor-wise (e.g., no sauce or interesting seasoning... but some might prefer it that way, I admit).

    "text": "My first experience with The Capital Grille was at their new restaurant in downtown Seattle, which has quickly become one of my favorite restaurants. So, when I saw that there was one directly across the street from my hotel in Vegas I thought \"hey, why not!\" The room wasn't ready yet anyway, and I was famished so I headed over.  Sitting at the bar, because there's no better place to meet people and have a good time in any Vegas restaurant, I ordered my newly discovered favorite appetizer - the prosciutto wrapped mozzarella. The flavor was great (it was cheese wrapped in meat after all) but the presentation was not quite up to Seattle standards. I guess maybe they don't need to try as hard because they've been around for several more years than their Seattle counterpart.  Overall the restaurant itself was very similar (surprise, it's a chain) with dark wood, brass, and paintings of famous people, most of which I don't even recognize. But it does come off a little cheesy, especially seeing that the Vegas Capital Grille is located in a mall. Oh well. At least I still have Seattle!",

Service was top notch until the end, had reservation for 7 pm and sat us early.  But, seemed like they wanted to get us out, after dinner they did not ask if we wanted coffee or dessert and just handed the bill and seemed disappointed when we asked for coffee and after dinner drinks.",

Capital Grille won't surprise you with much different from time to time, but it is consistently good, and that's worth a lot. Their staff is extremely well trained, friendly but never intrusive. Rarely, if ever, have I had a meal here that doesn't leave everyone very satisfied. Great for intimate dinners or groups, excellent for lunch, too.",

The food was quite wonderful also, I had a Fillet, with his recommended butter shallot sauce with Kona Coffee? I didn't even listen to what he suggested I said yes, and what came out was truly a culinary miracle. It was as juicy as can be and the sauce was simple incredible.

They also take a photo complimentary that prints out during dinner too. However, to be quite honest the food was just ok. The parmesan crusted sole tasted like only parmesan. The portion was huge though but unappetizing. I did like the green beans and the fries were tasty. My boyfriend did not care for the steak that much. The two different wines we had we did like and the salad for starter was good too. For the price and the lack of taste in the entrees I do not see us coming back.",

    "text": "Came here based on a friend's recommendation, who's previous tastes have not let us down.  The ambiance is very nice with a nice view of the Wynn and part of the strip.    What we ordered: Caprese salad:  The mozarella was decent, but nothing spectacular.  The tomatoes were average, I'm surprised they didn't try using heirlooms here.  The balsamic vinegar was the highlight of the dish and made an otherwise average dish a little better.    Kona crusted filet mignon:  Boyfriend ordered this.  It wasn't bad, I've had better.  The Kona crust gave a different flavor to the steak, but the filet was a little on the dry side.  Porcini rubbed delmonico:  At first, it was over-cooked.  Ordered medium-rare / medium and it came out more towards medium / medium-well.  I cut it next to the bone and it was just pink.  I really hate to send food back, for the price I was paying, I was not too happy. The second steak was cooked to perfection.  Very good marbling.  The rub added a nice touch to an otherwise tasty steak.  Roasted Seasonal Mushrooms:  A mix of mushrooms sauteed with butter.  Good mushrooms, nothing spectacular, nothing to complain about.  Cheesecake:  Not your ordinary cheesecake.  First of all, it is round.  It is not as dense as your typical cheesecake, which is a good thing to me.  There is a creme brulee-like crust over the top.  Save room for this.  Overall, dinner for two ended up costing us over $100, and it came out to about $250 with alcohol.  The service was good, I would probably have given them a 4 if the steak was prepared to my liking the first time around.  If you are a salt and pepper steak fan like I am, I would look somewhere else.  But if you want to try something with flavors you can't find anywhere else, this is worth a shot.",
