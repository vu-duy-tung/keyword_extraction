From normal lagers to goses to different stouts and porters. If they don't have a beer that you like, then you probably don't even like beer haha. The food is also delicious! I had a bahn mi and it was very flavorful with a good kick. They also have a built in strip of metal that keeps your beer cold when you set it down on it. Check it out!",

Lastly, the reason we come here, is the beer selection.  It is hands down one of the best in Las Vegas, rotating regularly with plenty of variety!

They have a nice selection of beers. I came in because I saw they had Cali Creamin' on tap from a photo another yelper posted. When I asked for it I was told that this bar rotated through their beers so they don't always have the same selections. I thought that was an awesome way to keep people coming back to try different beers. The  counter is super cool! I didn't realize it until the end, but the silver panel is meant to keep your drinks cold.  They let you sample if you want. They have a nice selection of sours which a lot of breweries don't have in Las Vegas. Their happy hour menu is good, I definitely recommend pairing the food with a beer or a drink. It is definitely drunk food lol, salty and fried everything. But even if you don't drink the food is still a plus.   I ordered -fried chicken skins -fried deviled eggs -chicken banh mi -original banh mi  I liked everything! I love fried chicken skins (especially from Carson Kitchen), but these were different. They reminded me more of chicharon with the texture and the breading on it and the sauce was like vinegar. If you're Filipino then you'll know what Im talking about lol. I liked it, they give you a large portion. The deviled eggs were delicious, I've never had them fried before. And both of the banh mis were good! I appreciated the fact that the bread was on the softer side because nothing sucks more than bread that cuts the inside of your mouth (ahemmm Lee's).   The bartender there was awesome, she definitely was cool to talk to and told us a lot about the place. The owners are from San Diego, which to me, made more sense of the beer selection, decor, and ambiance. They have cool events to look forward to, and they are planning to come out with a brunch menu on Saturday's and Sunday's. I can't wait for that because who doesn't love brunch? I will be coming back!",

This dude was swamped with covers but still was able to greet us promptly and fulfill our order in timely fashion. The banh mi sandwiches were incredible. We got their traditional (perhaps signature, I can't remember) and pork belly. Holy moly y'all. I have been in the biz for 20 years. I know good food. This place has good food.   Our party was not drinking on this occasion, but as a downtown bartender, I can assure you, their beer selection is on point. Local breweries are proudly represented as well as hard hitting micros.   I can't wait to come back here. Place is bomb, yo.",

I had the rum based cocktail I can't remember the name but it was very strong and so good! Not so strong it tastes like pure liquor but not sweet either. Delish. I then had fried chicken skins and shared the fried deviled eggs they were so yummy. I think this will be a fun to hang out to come to and they have a good deal on happy hour",

I love the casual yet sexy setting, which reminds me of a boutique hotel w/ stylish interior designs.   The unique menu offers comfort food selections, balanced by fresh ingredients, topped with gourmet & delicate flavors. Some of the foods have popular Vietnamese themes, such as cold spring rolls and Banh Mi sandwiches. And there are a ton of delicious American food selections as well.   I like the variety of music selections and/or genres at 595. I also appreciate multiple flat-screen TV's at the pub for people that enjoy watching sports.   Last, but certainly not the least, I like the reasonable pricing of their beer & food items. It is immensely refreshing to have a cool local hangout, instead of walking through smokey, pricey, & noisy casinos.",

The beer, the food, the vibe was awesome!!!! The week after we took our in laws they loved it and have talked about going back constantly even though they live in Henderson. This place is awesome!! Great food and great drinks.  Unfortunately I can't give 5 stars due to a few days ago me and my husband brought our friends to have them try since they all live around the area as well. When we first got there it was completely full and we looked at the bartenders he said it's open seating sit anywhere we sat at the first table available that was for 8 people. We made sure we only used half of the table Incase other people showed up ( we know these places always have to share seats so not a big deal. However at the end of the night after buying drinks, apps, entrees, and more drinks and spending over 100$. We go to the restroom and as I am walking back to the table one of the waitress who didn't even help us rudely says \" are you already done we have people waiting you know\". We immediately get up pack up and leave my husband didn't get to even finish his beer he just ordered. I understand we were in the wrong here we should have tried to stand or go to the bar since we were only 4 at an 8 table but I have to say I was very disappointed in the way we were talked too. Even if she had said maybe you guys can sit in the bank benches. Other than that horrible everything else is awesome! The food and beer are amazing!",

Pork belly Bnah MI has the wrong bun and looks silly with so little content. 8d beers?  Sorry, this is not the strip, and while the burger was fantastic, the rest of the options are laughable.",

Even when he is sweating thru eating it and drinking his weight in water to cool his mouth down, he is ultimately the happiest guy for having ordered it! Now lets get to the cherry on the top of every visit here and that is the bread pudding!! Every time we go in they have a different flavor of bread pudding, once it was traditional, then in the fall it was pumpkin spice, then it was chocolate, they have made a nutella with PB topped one and the one today that I had was s'mores!! I never order bread pudding because if I am being honest, its really not my thing, or so I thought. This is by far better than whatever it is your;e thinking a bread pudding is, this is perfection. Please do yourself a favor and go and see what I'm talking about. I hope everyone that reads this post goes and that this place never goes out of business! The atmosphere is casual and welcoming, the staff are seriously the best, the owner is awesome. Stop driving by and stop in!!!",

They have all kinds of flavors & types  so there is something for everyone. I've had numerous items on their menu, the deviled eggs & the crab dip being my two favorites. I always recommend this bar when people are looking for a cool local spot to try. The owner, Van, & the night bartender, Charles, are super friendly",

I haven't had a single dish that wasn't exceptional and made with love. The burgers are juicy and flavorful, their chicken sandwiches are spicy and fried to perfection and even their popcorn is enhanced with beautifully creative flavors.   What makes this place even better is their ever rotating selections of beer. Focusing on craft beers from all over they carry some of my local favorites as well as breweries from out of state that are exceptional.   Service is always on point as well. Friendly staff, delicious food and a lovely beer selection has easily made this one of my favorite new spots!",

    "text": "When friends suggested this place, I was reluctant, as I'd been to the now-closed Elements Martini Bar several times which was its old location.  Old ownership and management was terrible, and I was hesitant, as I assumed they had just reopened under a new name.  I was absolutely wrong.  Our experience at 595 Craft and Kitchen was amazing.  As a group of four at the bar, we attempted to get a table in the dining room after our first round, but the bartender Patrick was able to squeeze the four of us in at the bar as the after work crowd thinned out.  We ordered the beer cheese with pretzels, the dynamite crab dip, the loco moco poutine fries, and four different sandwiches to share.  The appetizers were definitely the stars of all the dishes we ordered, though my hot chicken sandwich was pretty fantastic as well.  What made our experience amazing rests 100% on our bartender for the evening Patrick.  I overheard him giving another guest some advice on IPAs, and his passion for beer definitely shows.  We ordered entirely too many difficult order cocktails, which Patrick never gave us any flack about, as he happily concocted our drinks all evening.  On our drive home we all agreed that had we had another bartender, we weren't sure we would have loved our experience as much as we did.  I would absolutely return.  I have and will continue to recommend this place to friends.  Perfect spot for a beer or two after work or to meet up with friends.  Kudos to new owners and management, and eight thumbs up from the four of us for Patrick.",

The place is nice and cozy, atmosphere was inviting from the second you step foot inside. It was already off to a good start.   After looking at their list of Appetizers, we decided on the Garbage Nachos. These were freaking fantastic! Brisket, pork belly, chicken, cheese blend, pico, guacamole and cilantro lime crema. These were amazing! It's hard to find good nachos. We really enjoyed these, especially because it wasn't just about overdoing the cheese, they really put together a great balance of ingredients.     After the nachos, we moved on to our main course. My husband ordered their Beer Brined Chicken Wings (Buffalo & Hoisin Sambal). There were delicious, nice and flavorful with a bit of a kick. The hoisin ones were the perfect sticky spicy ratio. To go along with those he decided on their Caesar Salad. This was really good as well. I went with their Pork Belly Burger which was put together with some cabbage slaw, gochujang aioli and fried shallots. The Burger was of course my favorite! Pork Belly was tender and juicy, the burger patty was well seasoned and flavorful. It looked amazing, and the taste matched the look. I highly recommend the pork belly burger.   For drinks, we simply went with an old fashioned- But it was a damn delicious old fashioned! Perfect mix of everything.   The staff was extremely friendly and on top of everything. Our server was very helpful in explaining everything and I specially love the fact that when I asked, he gave me  his opinion no hesitation (he knew and had tasted the menu). I can definitely see us coming back here in the future to try out more of their menu and drinks. Looking forward to visiting during their happy hour as well!",

It's misleading... in the classy glass is adorable drink that will slap you lit.    I've visited this place a few times before, it's one of the few gems in Spring Valley.

But, for $9 I don't think it's worth it .  SERVICE:  3/5.  Im guessing it took around 15-20 min for all of us to our food.  AMBIENCE:  3/5.  It's a small restaurant with a bar.

I would recommend going here for a drink but not the food. We wanted to give it a 2nd chance after trying for HH. Everything I've tasted here hasn't been good. Crab dip was ok but very oily & hot chicken sandwich lacked flavor. It was hot but tasteless. I can't say I'll go back.",

We came late on a weekend night for some nosh, not an entire meal and there was absolutely no wait. We were greeted immediately by our awesome waitress Ruda. She and Chelsea who brought us our dishes, filled waters attentively, and made recommendations were super personable and should absolutely be commended. They made our entire visit extra enjoyable.   The table shared:  -Fried deviled eggs with Gochujang Aioli. Beautifully plated and well received by hubs.   -Thai Cashew Hummus with Pickled Veggies and delicious light crispy House Crackers. So different than any hummus I've tasted before! It definitely had a kick but not too much the littles couldn't enjoy it. The house made crackers were awesome!   -Hand Cut House Fries perfectly fried and salted, served with Sambal Ketchup, Gochujang Aioli or Roasted Garlic Aioli. I hear their poutine is popular and came recommended, but plain was a veg friendly option that was certainly delish.   All plates were very well liked and we would recommend them all. The menu has a heavy Asian influence, but you'll find anything from burgers to a handful of Bahn Mi, even a popcorn of the day. Love that last one!  Vegan and GF options available.  Lighter options such as salads too.   For a sweet ending the crew went for the bread pudding of the day which was a salted caramel they really loved. The Chocolate Olive Oil Budino Chocolate Soil + Sea Salt + Candied Peanut seems to be a fan favorite however.   The craft list which is an obvious huge draw was very impressive and interesting and included many locals. It offered something for every beer drinker's taste...ambers, pilsners, IPA, blondes and pales, porters and stouts. They are heavy on the fruit here ...blueberry wheat, boysenberry sour, tangerine pale ales, a blood orange option, even pear or pineapple cider. I'm personally happy to see any pumpkin brews on a menu in the summertime! Oh, and beer aficionados, they're on tap finder if you want to see what's happening.   If brews aren't your thing, the cocktails were creative and included the oh so trendy shrubs and bitters. They had intriguing rock and roll-ish names too.   If you're looking to stay off the beaten path in a more casual, neighborhood bar type atmosphere and just taking a load off while enjoying brews and smaller bites, this place should be considered.  We had a great time just chilling and snacking here.",

This bar is one of my favorites as the beer selection on tap is always rotating an eclectic variety of treats. Odell and Pure Project are hard to come by in the valley so I take a bow to you 595... get it!  Also, another highlight here is the kitchen and the amazing selections of poutine, pork belly dishes made in house, and refreshing salad compilations. I drive across town for the pork belly burger. The spicy slaw and crispy pork belly just hits the spot without fail.   There is a metal strip that runs the bar top that is iced to keep your glass chilled as you enjoy beverage after beverage. Pretty cool idea you guys!",

Also, I had take out last time which I failed to mention.   So I thought to myself , well that is not cool. I decided to come in again by myself so I could really soak up the experience.   One of the first question I ask the lady at the bar in regards to the Poutine was \"How is it prepared ?\"   She hit me back with a side look and said \"what do you mean?\" And just stared at me a bit.   She then said \"fries , Gravy a fried egg scallions. \"   ...... so far I'm displeased just by her asinine attitude.   The crowd at the present are mostly middle aged or late 40's.   So while I appreciate that you went into great detail being the public representative of your company I'd more so appreciate a person who isn't obviously miserable to be here at her job.   I deal with many people through out the day and she isn't as welcoming or informative as me id like, however I'll not dote on.   She asked me what type of wings did I want I said I didn't know she told me the selection. She said what she liked best so I decided to pick those.   So now I await my poutine and these wings made with a Korean marinade with Hoysen and gochujang.   I'm Korean so I'm taking her suggestion. I'm also understanding so I'm not going to assume this will be the attitude for the remainder of my meal.   I do dish off a heavy attitude myself when disrespect is concerned.   I'll brb.  Ok as far as the wings and using Korean ingredients. I'd honestly love for them to have more flavor. Korean food is well known for being super flavorful.   They weren't horrible they just didn't hit that high peak of Asian expectations I have when using my homeland ingredients.   I'd love to come in and show you the best way to prepare these to be honest.   Also the poutine was much better. The fries were freshly made. The gravy is way too thick in my opinion. The curds were perfectly melted as opposed to my ice cold curds I had prior.   Overall the atmosphere was super chill. Everyone was enjoying the Golden Knights game , the bar maid's attitude didn't bug me as much as she seemingly is there only for the drinkers and I was sitting at the bar.   The quality of the food is good and I only had a few things. I took some hummus to go and even though we are super Asian we just could not get past all the sweet notes and how you pair it with cracker or pita bread.   I think some veggies with that sort of hummus would be spot on. It wasn't as velvety as I like my hummus, which does tell you they make it in-house yet they could work on the texture a bit.",

    "text": "This gastropub has a lot of Asian-inspired dishes. They also use a lot of salt which is not Asian-inspired. If you want Instagrammable food porn, go when the sun is still out. Otherwise, it's daaark in this place which is perfect if your dating confidence is not high. The lack of lighting and the good drinks (per friends who drink) are your friends.  I've tried several dishes here...  Fried Deviled Eggs:  Just what it is plus, a gochujang aioli dipping sauce. I think it's the dipping sauce that makes this salty. Eat without the dip and it's just fine. 3.5/5  Crispy Chicken Skins: Lightly breaded chicken skins, deep-fried. Comes with a sweet chili dipping sauce. Possibly the best appetizer on their menu. Savory and crispy. 4/5  Beer Cheese: Pretzels you dip into beer cheese. I didn't like this. I don't even know how to describe it other than add beer to Cheez Wiz and dip bread into it. 2/5  Banh Mi: Pretty good but nothing spectacular. Comparable to banh mi you can get from Chinatown. 3/5  Pork Belly Burger: I was under the impression I'd get like a pork belly sandwich. What I got instead was a thick beef patty topped with pork belly! Yum! But what was missing was the acidity to cut off the fattiness and richness of the beef and pork belly. Texture-wise, they could've added more crunch to this burger with some fresh crisp veggies. 3/5  Fries: Really crunchy fried potatoes. Well-seasoned. I think they fry them twice to get the perfect crunch. Ask for regular ketchup if you don't want their salty dipping sauces. 4/5  Dynamite Crab Dip: Chunks of imitation crab in sriracha aioli with a side of different types of bread/ cracker. I think they could've shredded the imitation crab a bit so when you scoop up some dip, you get a nice even ratio of crab and aioli instead of a big chunk of crab coated in aioli. 2/5  Vermicelli Noodle Salad: Not sure why this is called a salad as there was not enough greens/ vegetables for it to count as a salad. You can add proteins to it like grilled garlic chicken, pork belly, etc for a few bucks more. The dressing is watery, vinegary and has a nice spicy kick to it - it goes well with the dish. 3/5  Furikake Tuna Burger:  Ground tuna patty - yeah, I don't like the thought of that. I'd have to skip writing about this.  Hot Fried Chicken Sandwich: Crispy fried chicken.  Chocolate Budino: Bittersweet chocolate that's smooth and creamy.   As you can tell, I just got lazy towards the end of this review. This place isn't as exciting as the other reviews make it seem. There's usually just 1 or 2 servers/ bartenders working so, if more than 3 tables are occupied, the service can be slow/ lacking. Also, it seems like every time we come here, there's always people making out or necking. LOL.",

Service is super friendly and I loved that our server was very attentive, but I would've appreciated a little more space and time to ponder the menu and enjoy our meal. Otherwise, she gave some great recommendations and was knowledgeable about the menu.  I really enjoyed the fried deviled eggs. Super original and delicious idea. I was super skeptical, but it wasn't greasy at all. Plus, the breading was very well done.  I was not a fan of the heirloom tomato salad. I thought the food quality was good, but I wasn't a fan of the dressing. Something about it reminded me of barbecue sauce, but my boyfriend loved it, so I think it's just up to preference.   My boyfriend loved the signature banh mi. He thought the pork was amazing and said it was the best Viet sandwich he ever had.  Overall, even though I was kind of disappointed in my salad, their menu looks super promising. I'll definitely be back for drinks and the food (especially that broccolini banh mi).",

Oh and the special of the day which was Fried Salmon.  The Thai Cashew Hummus was REALLY good. A little spicy and different than anything I've had before. They give you quite a lot. I would definitely go back just for this hummus.  Beer Cheese Poutine is definitely an appetizer to share. So good though!  Crispy Chicken Skins were a nice snack, but the batter was a little to heavy for my liking. A little less and it would have been perfect.  I do not recommend getting the wings if you're expecting Gochujang flavor because it definitely was NOT that. They were ok, a little too dry. The buffalo wasn't anything special. I asked for a side of Hoison sambal sauce because I was curious what it tasted like. NOT like Hoison at all. it was too vinegary and I did not like it.  Beef Brisket Banh Mi was also a tad dry. Pouring some of the chili sauce from the Chicken Skin helped make it much better. So I'd recommend asking for some on the side if that's the case for you.  Surprisingly we didn't try any of the beers. I'd definitely come back for some of the food we liked and to try some beers.",

    "text": "595 Craft And Kitchen is a very welcome addition to the neighborhood. I stumbled upon this place while looking for good pubs on the west side of town on yelp, and decided to check it out. It's a relatively smaller space, but with plenty of big tables and bar area to fit any size group. I've been back a few times and so far the food and beer selection has always been good. All of their Bahn Mi sandwiches, as well as their garbage fries and burgers are really great, and the fried deviled eggs are interested and delicious. Their craft beer selection is also a huge selling point. They always have something interesting from sours, porters, stouts and beyond, from local breweries to a variety from around the country there is something for everyone. The ONLY thing we've ever had issues with is sometimes the Nashville Hot chicken sandwich has been overly spicy a few times, to the point where it was almost impossible to eat (and we LOVE spicy food), however, we chalk this up to the fact they use all fresh ingredients in all their menu items and peppers can change in intensity from one batch to the next, as we've had the sandwich before when it was just perfect. They should do a bit more control on that particular sauce, but they do warn you on the menu and the one time we had an overly spicy version they were very apologetic and replaced my husbands order free of charge with a different item. All in all all the other food is incredibly flavorful, and service is good whether you're at a table or at the bar.",

They have a lot of local beers to try but we were not familiar with any local breweries so we were happy they had some beer from San Diego that we were familiar with. We both got a Mother Earth brew. We ordered the pork belly banh mi and a small order of wings (I forget which kind we ordered though). The banh mi was great and had some of the best pork belly I've tried. The wings were decent, but very small portion, 4 wings I believe and not good enough to remember what kind we ordered and wouldn't order them again. If you're in town and want a cold beer in a cool little place, this might just be a good place to stop by!",

Great beers, wonderful and delicious food. We took advantage of their everyday Happy Hour except Saturday and all day when there's a game on Sunday. We enjoyed the fried chicken skins, wings and basically ordered one of everything on the HH menu. Their regular menu had a great selection, folks next to us ordered the Furikake Tuna Burger and said it was excellent. Tristan our lovely bartender, who we affectionally call Jimmy Joe, because my 90 yr old Father in law Bob, who we then called Bobby Joe was hitting on her...lol, she was very friendly and a great sport! It's a great place, lots of fun... a must go to place!",

    "text": "\"595 Craft and Kitchen\" occupies a corner spot within a suburban shopping center. You can find it easily, as you approach the intersection of Rainbow and Tropicana. I would describe this enterprise as a tap house featuring a great selection of craft beers. But what sets it apart from other tap houses are the kitchen offerings. They don't offer generic \"pub food\".  During my last visit, I tried the \"furikake tuna burger\" ($14.00). For additional $3.00, I got a small salad. I've had tuna burgers at other restaurants. That said, the taste and texture was very good; the price point, relative to the portion, was fair. As for the salad, it wasn't just chopped lettuce. It was a quality bend of mixed greens, diced tomatoes and sliced cucumber.  The complete menu, along with pricing, is available on their website.  BTW: how did I find this place? I Googled looking for a place in Las Vegas that served \"poutine\". Yup, they have that--and a lot of other than ordinary bar snacks.",

    "text": "One of the few places that none of us had ever been to... the perfect recipe for success. At least this time it was.   I hate deviled eggs. I like theirs. Deep fry anything I think I could at least try it... anything. I took one bite I was like this is yummy, and then I tasted the hard boiled egg, it's the texture really, but I highly recommend it to the deviled egg inclined.  Beer cheese and pretzels. It is hard to screw up a pretzel so, they nailed that. The beer cheese I had low expectations for. Just the perfect amount of beer flavor. Too many times I have had beer cheese that tastes like... just beer, not cheese at all. It was delightful.  Pork belly sandwich. I wish we would have got so much more of this. Delicious, tender belly. Tasty sauce and overall just a stellar experience without much expectation.   THE VERDICT: Go and get yourself some pork belly. The perfect amount of food for three people who weren't very hungry when they went, and it still tickled our stomach to the maximum. No leftovers and nothing was overly expensive. I don't know what the number 595 stands for... but you need it. Believe me. Okay... maybe not need.",

I asked yelp for some assistance . \"Yelp, who has the best hot wings in LV?\"  Yelp replied 595. For me to eat hot wings I need a really good blue cheese dressing. Unfortunately 595 does not have it. Needless to say, I passed on the wings. I did have the burger and fries that hit the spot.  Last but not least, the service. Service was top notch. I looked on the receipt to get her name. Funny, she doesn't look like a Van Alan? Maybe her dad wanted a boy? Anyway, she was awesome and I will be back... Cheers.",

We popped in to try happy hour before a movie and enjoyed a variety of foods including delicious fried deviled eggs 5/5, crispy chicken skins with a good sauce to dip in 4/5, hand cut house fries 4/5, honey soy chicken bahn mi slider 5/5, signature bahn mi slider 3/5, beer brined chicken wings 3/5 and lastly the Chris' BAD ASS chili 4/5. I would say my favorite things were the fried deviled eggs and the chicken skins, both unique and tasty.  Everything we tried we shared three ways amongst friends. The seating area in 595 Craft and Kitchen was very limited so we were lucky to get in and seated for their Happy Hour (which lasts 3-6 PM and then midnight to close). People around us were trying other items and we all chatted about how good the food was. All of the servers were friendly and very helpful. Enjoy the pics and give this place a try for yourself!",

Off to one wall is a garage opening style seating area. The parrel side was the actual bar with plenty of beers/cocktail/wines to choose from. I got there with 30mintes left to happy hour. So the guy serving us came back to grab our drink menus and gave us some info on some of the asian fusion food items on the menu.   We both ordered chicken wings; I got the classic buffalo and my friend got the hoisin sauce. They were both equally delicious. I recommend trying the hoisin style wings to change up what youre used to.   Looking at the rest of the menu, they had burgers, banh mi's, and other fusion type items. I wanted to try their banhi mi. I thought it would be too much to eat but OMG it was so good that I had to finish the nearly foot long banh mi sandwhich.   I will definitely return with some friends and maybe even look into their pumpkin carving event! It's such a cool place to hang out--it looks like they even have board games available just to hangout.",

Like everything has been recently disinfected, but not in a chemical way. Like, if you go in the restroom and look up at the vent fan, it is completely free of dust. I mean, how many times you go into a restroom in a restaurant and the vent fan is caked with nasty dust?? This place is SPOTLESS! And that has to translate to the kitchen. The brisket bahn mi was absolutely delicious. The fries were hot and crisp, the wings are outstanding, literally everything was perfect. Definitely putting this place on our short list - even though we live on the complete other side of vegas.",

Upon entering, found this place small but hip and chill.   Athough beer is the main attraction, the owners are seeking to establish the gastropub as a family-friendly community hangout. It's great it's a no-smoking and no-gaming place.  The menu is interesting, unique and reasonably priced.  I skipped the variety of beers as I'm not a beer fan. I had their Sparking wine and my bf had their Cocktails called Gordon's Cup that consists of Gin + Cucumber + Mint + Fresh Lime. It was tasty but not strong.  Their craft beers are from all over and they let you sample if you want.  Some of the food ordered were- Garbage Nachos from the Special menu Pork Belly Burger Chicken Skins: breaded, slightly spicy. Pork Belly Bahn Mi: added an egg on it, it's my fave. The pork belly was cooked to perfection and flavorful.  The waitress was attentive and nice.",

    "text": "Excellent gastropub in Spring Valley that isn't obnoxiously loud with patrons drunk on beer. Everything from the food to the service was five stars for me. The gastropub itself isn't too big, so we had one server serve us the entire time. She had a smile on her face the entire time when she attended to us and did so genuinely. Everything from taking our orders promptly, to filling our water cups, to correcting a minor hiccup along the way was spot on. You can tell, this business truly emphasizes excellent customer service.   My boyfriend and I skipped the variety of beers they have on tap because we aren't avid beer drinkers and can't appreciate it. But we did try their burgers and sides.  The badass pork belly burger ($13) was really badass. There were slices of fatty pork belly on top of a burger patty, and cole slaw. I also added a farm egg for $2 extra. The combination was filling and tasty. The red peppers in the cole slaw gave the burger a mild kick and was surprising to the tongue. I added a simple salad as a side for $3 extra. The salad came with mixed greens, carrots, cumcubers, tomatoes, radish and a light citrus vinaigrette.   The chili burger ($12) was chili atop a hamburger patty. Although the chili was tasty, the burger itself was a bit dry. Be prepared to get down and dirty with this burger because it will get messy. A side of fries were added to this order for $3 extra and it came with a side of aioli dipping sauce.   For dessert, we tried the Reese's bread pudding. Save room for dessert because this decadent peanut butter and chocolate dish is too good to skip. Sticks of bread are stacked atop one another and served with a side of sweet whipped cream and crumbs. The portion is pretty hefty too and can serve up to 4 people!  I will definitely be coming back to try all the other dishes 595 has to offer. This place is truly a gem.",

Our server gave us many suggestions based on the types of beers we liked and didn't hesitate to give us a sample for anything we were unsure of. We were very pleased with our beer choices.  We ordered the Beer Cheese with pretzel bites to go along with our brews. The beer cheese was not very flavorful, but the pretzels were really fresh and tasty. We also ordered the Beer Brined Chicken Wings (buffalo flavor) which came with pickled veggies. The wings were amazing, but the pickled veggies were not great. Lastly, we ordered Chris' Bad Ass Chili Poutine. We loved it! The chili was delicious and packed with flavor. I would definitely like to come back and explore other items on their menu.",

It's open seating, so we found a little shelf rail bar to sit at in the back. The wait staff was prompt, friendly and knowledgeable. They have a great selection of very tasty beers. The food was top notch. I ordered the heirloom tomato salad with added (seared) tuna. Best. Decision. Ever. I highly recommend it. They don't have freezers so everything they make is fresh. Their pricing reflects this, but it is still worth it.",

This is a fantastic place to enjoy craft beers and they are very supportive of local breweries. They also regularly host the local beer community for bottle shares and special events.  The reason they don't get 4 stars or more from me (yet) is because of the service. The 1st time I was in there was for a bottle share, which had been planned pretty far in advance. The server who was scheduled to work that day had apparently called in (which is no fault of the restaurants, that stuff happens). In a pinch, they had the wife (I think) of the Manager fill in. It didn't go so well, unfortunately. She wasn't familiar with the beers and we ended up with not 1, but 2 issues with our bill. She charged us for someone elses tab.  Anyhow, it wasn't a major deal breaker - I would still consider them a new place with some kinks to work out, but overall it's a great vibe and we need more places like this in town. Definitely check it out if you get a chance.",

Tonnes of on tap craft beer options; we chose the Modern Times and were surprised with the tartness of it. But fresh and good for our early afternoon drink. The food menu offered many tasty delights; chopped cabbage salad, veggie summer spring rolls, Bahn mi sandwiches, garbage nachos; but we came for one thing, the poutine. I'm Canadian and needed my fix. They nailed it, yummy, homemade brown gravy, thick cheese curds, scallions and added fried egg. Good and salty, crispy fries. Hit the spot. Great and friendly service, Val was awesome. Loved the music they had on very inviting space. Will be back.",

    "text": "Cool late night hang out spot! 595 Craft and Kitchen is located right behind Walgreens on Rainbow and Trop.   They got an awesome selection of beers. I would come back just for this reason...seems their selection changes often so looking forward to their next rotation.   Food was hit or miss....  Deviled egg: recommended appetizer which turned out to be the highlight. Fried egg white with creamy/paste-like egg yolk on top. Came with a dipping sauce. This is one of those simple but great appetizer.   Furikake tuna burger: tuna was seared and perfectly cooked. I liked how the sauce had a hint of spice, but wish they sprinkled more furikake or offered extra furikake on the side. This was one of my favorite.  Chicken sandwich: sadly no bueno. Chicken was waaaay to greasy and there was aftertaste of old oil or grease that lingered in my mouth.   Loco moco poutine: Choose spam, came with 3 slices. Egg was cooked perfectly with runny yolk. Fries were not too crispy as it was covered in gravy that instantly turned all the fries soggy. Gravy itself was mediocre and not my favorite.   I'd come back here to drink. Great service but food was hit or miss. 4 out of 5 I would recommend!",

Service was non existent! After being told to sit anywhere in the small dining room we than proceeded to wait almost 10 minutes to just get our drinks.  Than she finally took our orders.  Food did not take that long to get to our table.  However we sat there and never once was checked back on, got refills or even our check.  The other tables in the dining room were constantly looking around for the blonde bartender/server as well.  During this time she was constantly at the bar talking to some guy she apparently knew.  He did not even appear to be customer.  I finally just left some cash on the table hoping it was enough to cover our tab and left.  It is great that they have lunch specials but most of us that go out to eat for lunch during the week are on break from work and don't get an unlimited amount of time away from our jobs.",

As far as drinks go, I'm not much of a beer lover (I know, I know. They're known for their wide beer selection), but I've had good ciders and great cocktails there. My personal favorites are the Daiquiri and one of their specialty cocktail's Queen Bee. When it comes to food, it's always mouthwatering. I can't stop in and not order their beer cheese with pretzels. I've tried the beer cheese at other restaurants, and 595's is, without a doubt, my favorite. They also make amazing chicken wings, and an even better Bahn Mi \"burger.\" GAME CHANGER. I'm telling you. And if you're looking for something spicy, and I mean really spicy, try the Hot Fried Chicken Sandwich. They aren't kidding when they say spicy - you have been warned! They also have games you can play at your table, which is fun and different for a bar/restaurant. I really enjoy the vibe in here; a lot of Vegas bars can either lean too far into college territory, or they have slots and cater to an older crowd. It feels cool and young, without trying too hard. One of my favorite spots in Vegas as a local.",

When you walk in, it kind of has a California vibe the bar has a few chalk boards with all the beers on tab. My boyfriend ordered the \"New IPA who dis\" by Joseph James he said it was good.   We shared the FRIED DEVILED EGGS 5/5 on those. They are beer battered and fried to perfection! The spicy aioli it comes with is delicious too!  We also shared the PORK BELLY BUHN MI 5/5 sooo good! The pork belly is seasoned so well and melts in your mouth and the fresh veggies in the bun are crispy.   I ordered the Gordon Gin, it was very well mixed. Not too heavy on the lemon and a good taste of gin and mint. I'd come back for this cocktail alone.   We were really impressed!",

After checking out the excellent yelp reviews and noticing they have a nice selection of craft beers on tap, we agreed to meet her there. Located in a strip mall, lots of parking, seating at the bar, tables or high tops. Our server, Tristan, was very friendly and knowledgeable, explaining that all the food dishes were prepared fresh only after the customer orders since everything the kitchen prepares is ordered daily. We ordered two Pork Belly Bahn Mi sandwiches, a Chicken Bahn Mi and Veggie Spring Rolls-everything was flavorful, fresh and very tasty! I asked Tristan for some beer suggestions and she sold me on the Occidental Dunkel, which was very nice with lunch-smooth and perfect with my Pork Belly Bahn Mi! They also had Coca-Cola products which is a definite plus with my wife, who must have a Coke with her meals! Looking forward to going again and checking out more of their food and beers!",

Mostly because of the bartenders and their witty banter with the guests at the bar.  I went in for the playoff game and immediately asked for my favorite bar tender, Tristian (who usually works on Wednesday's) and was told that she is no longer with the company.. To be honest, she is the kind of person who makes all experiences memorable, all bad days better and all heavy days lighter. Isn't that why most regulars frequent places such as these? Yes. And that is why 595 became my regular dwelling place.. Now that this special soul is gone, I can't imagine myself coming back here. It feels empty and lifeless.  When you find employees who have such an impact on their patrons, one should be mindful and keep them around. She touched my life and I know she touched others in an extremely positive way.  595 will never be the same in my opinion.",

She checked on us regularly and even joked about food comas when we asked for the check.   I went to get lunch with a friend during their happy hour. The appetizers were cheap but the portions were large for the most part. I ordered the pork tacos which were rather simple in my opinion  along with a set of the garbage nachos which were definitely loaded, I had to power through to finish them.  My friend ordered wings, chili fries and the unbelievably delicious deviled eggs which she had to take home due to, again, the large serving sizes. The eggs were breaded and baked, I've never seen that done before.  If you want alcohol I recommend trying their beers only because the daiquiri I ordered was outrageously small- it came served in a tiny snifter glass I picked up with two fingers.",

In particular, you want to be at 595 when Bozo is behind the bar! That's why Jim G and I went all the way out there, to see our man Bozo.  He's the best, SON! (As Bozo says)  Tons of craft beer, as well as cocktails. The menu has an interesting Asian-fusion flair.  We only tasted a few things, as most of the dishes are pretty carb heavy and, therefore, not for us.  But if we did eat carbs, we would have indulged in plenty of dishes!   Check out 595; you'll be glad you did!",

Everyone was there just to hang out and relax, maybe watch a game. Talk to each other and see what they're eating. lol. So chill.   The last time I was there, we couldn't stop ordering the deviled eggs! Please try those! And it was the first time I tried the Pork Belly Bahn Mi.

    "text": "I didn't like 595 from the get go but it wasn't their fault.   When I used to work in this plaza I used to get food to go from the place that occupied this spot before and honestly it was always such a negative experience that it carried over to 595. The banh mi was my bodega sandwich growing up and to see it become the trendy butchered flavor of the month, I was eager to judge. I thought \"$10 for a banh mi?!\" and honestly probably couldn't get past my ego to give it a fair taste.   Fast forward a few years and a lot of humbling I was blown away by the same sandwich I once thought \"this ain't it chief\". The thing is though, 595 isn't just about that one sandwich, its about its dozens of killer food options (garbage fries umphh), the extensive deep craft beer list AND most importantly how it has chosen to integrate itself into the community. Imagine how easy it is to be another spot that just mindlessly rides on the craft beer wave without the ounce of passion that 595 puts in? Sorry for counting you guys out.   Check out their beer list on their website, the mini bottle shop, their Instagram for beer and sports events, and their $10 lunch specials (I recommend the pork belly banh mi of course).",

Well, I walked in, said I had a group of 12-14 people coming, and Van accommodated is IMMEDIATELY. Put some tables together and made it work out perfectly. I was super happy about this. Drinks and food were awesome. I had the hot fried chicken sandwich and a few house beers. I literally have zero complaints. Definitely coming back here even for a drink after work. Happens to be so conveniently on my way home. Thanks again guys! You've gained a loyal customer. :)",

Great brioche bun from local bakery and the bacon was super nice and crispy. Solid burger!  I recommend getting their hot chicken sandwich as well. That was on point.

We live in Henderson so it's a bit of a drive but what an amazing revolving tap list with great Asian fusion bar food to go with it... though, our wings tonight weren't quite on par as previous visits, everything in general is amazing and completely makes up for aberrations in delivery!!. Yes, it's a very small restaurant/pub, but service is on point  and every detail is attended to..  Craft bottles fridged, bottle shares and other events frequently.. Happy Hour M-F 3-6pm with $1-2 off drafts, cheap bites, check-in offers etc..we'll be back for more!! It's so nice to see a local joint that cares about the little details. Thx again Craft Kitchen 595!!",

I read some yelp reviews that claimed the food was a bit salty and I would have to agree. We got the crispy fried deviled eggs which were very crisp, unfortunately they were fairly standard and came with a sauce that wasn't really necessary in my opinion. The hot fried chicken sandwich was pretty hot for me but had great flavor - just would have loved some pickled vegetables on the side or some sort of slaw to cool everything down. The loco moco poutine was good with spam but it was way too salty. Gravy flavor was excellent though.  I will admit we could have ordered a little better and had a more balanced meal - that being said the loco moco all by itself with spam was very salty.  Overall not bad. 3.75/5.",

    "text": "Ive been looking for new places to eat ever since I visited Vegas a couple months ago and went for a crazy one day and a half stay before I had to go back to work but of course the trusty yelp led me to this place. Besides the sweltering daily humid heat of vegas this restaurant was nice and modern. The server was great and nice and she offered me suggestions of whats good. So I ended up getting the pork belly burger and accompanied it with a Belgian sour cherry beer for the drink. The pickled slaw they had on the pork belly and the sauce went pretty well with each other and the fries were crispy. I loved the Belgian sour cherry beer I got and everything from start to finish was great. This place definitely didn't disappoint and it was like a tall glass of shade in this desert heat. Being checked upon if everything was great led to some great service even though their were only a couple people there but mostly at the bar. Itll be one of my go to's when I visit vegas again so I can have a pork belly burger again and try another beer as well. Thanks guys",

    "text": "Who needs a side of fries when you have fried chicken skins!  The chicken skins probably didn't help my cholesterol...but I couldn't stop eating them.  A very large portion, each bite perfectly crispy and seasoned (salty with a slight kick).  The batter is light and crunchy and paired with a sweet chili sauce.  This was definitely a great side to my furikake tuna burger.  The tuna burger was quite possibly just slightly under seasoned for my taste but seared perfectly.  To clarify, one review scared me when they mentioned ground tuna....the tuna was a seared tuna steak cut into slices...no ground tuna here.  I thought the garlic aioli, arugula, heirloom tomatoes, and shitake mushrooms were a perfect pairing for the tuna.   I might see if they can turn this into a salad for me next time, the bun was a little underwhelming.  The chicken skins were so good, I wanted to shove them inside my tuna burger....  My husband got the loco moco poutine, opting for the hamburger patty.  I sampled a fry with the gravy and the gravy was on point.  I saw they have a brunch menu on the weekends with some good options.  We will definitely be back.  I kept talking about the chicken skins all weekend....please get them!  It's a bar but we also saw some kids eating here, they have a separate dining section.  Limited table seating, mostly bar tables...so might not be the best with lots of little kids.  We did note they have at least one high chair.  The one down side, don't come here if your looking for a \"quick\" bite.  The food took quite some time to come out of the kitchen, and we were there on a slow night.",

Not only does this place have a variety of craft beers/cocktails/wine to choose from, but they also have amazing food with an Asian twist. This is the second time I've been here and I have to say that this place has always been consistent with excellent service and yummy food. My friends and I came here this afternoon for their happy hour and were seated immediately. Our waitress was very nice and allowed us to sample the craft beers before making a decision. My friends and I ended up ordering the Mango Hefeweizen and it was pretty good. From the happy hour menu, we ordered the Thai cashew hummus, Garbage Nachos, and the Fried Deviled Eggs to share. The food came out fast and we found everything to be delicious. In addition, I ordered a signature banh mi sandwich with a side of Hangover fries to-go for my boyfriend to bring back home and he loved it! I definitely recommend this place.

My bf wanted to remove the extra cabbage slaw but I insisted to eat it the way it comes ( how the chef/cooks invisioned it!) so he agreed and was very happy! We both were! What a damn good burger. I had a well drink he ordered a signature cocktail and both were delicious. My bfs was a bit strong (to him) but I thought it was just strong enough. There were also tons of beers to choose from, including on tap. Music was lively and loud and it wasn't too crowded inside but was busy. We recommended this place and the pork belly burger to everyone the following days it was so delicious!  .   Our waiter was also very nice, he talked with us a bit and was quick with our food & drinks . Also had some good recommendations.    All in all the place was great! We will be back and with friends !

The vermicelli noodle salad with the brisket was good too but needed that...umami flavor???...like it needed that fish sauce and it would have been perfect!  That hot fried chicken sandwich was...HOT (as described on the menu)!!  Like it was too hot that you really can't enjoy the sandwich.  And I can love spicy food - like on a scale of 1 to 10 with a Thai Chili...usually a 7 or 8.  This was like a 12.  After scraping the breading off the chicken, the sandwich was still pretty good.  Craft beer selection was good too!  I had a Lovelady Mojito Sour and it was delicious!  The place is a bit small so large parties of 8 or more might have to wait for tables.",

We seated ourselves at the bar where we ran into some old friends. We're not beer drinkers (I know blasphemy) so I had a Powderfinger and he had an After the Gold Rush. Both were very good, but nothing that knocked my socks  next we ordered the chicken skins and the poutine with porkbelly. Both dishes were amazing! The chicken skins were the best I've had and the pork belly was perfect. The only bummer is that the Mr wanted a Sailor Jerry  and Diet Coke for a second round. The bar only carries a white and a dark, but no spiced rum. J isn't picky so he settled for just a white rum.   All in all it seems like this will be a great neighborhood place that I look forward to visiting again. I know it's a beer focused place, but it'd be nice to see a more fleshed out cocktail menu, maybe some mead (please!), and a larger selection of alcohol in general.",

There were some people seated at the bar with food and drinks already, but no bartender, host, or waiter in sight. We stood around for a few minutes wondering if it was self seating or not. We wanted to sit at the booths but there was a large partition and we didn't want to be overlooked so we decided to sit at the bar, seeing as how there were no waiters to be found. Through the small window in the door we could see \"employees\" in the back walking around. It appeared that one was either eating or drinking something in the back. 5 minutes pass by.... what seemed like 10 minutes passed by until someone finally walked out. At this point we were about to walk out. No apology. He tended to the customers that were already there first. Finally he came over and handed us menus. He clearly had no service industry experience. We basically had to flag him down to order drinks and food. It took about 5 minutes in between each order because he kept walking away and talking to other people and wouldn't check in on us. We basically had to interrupt him to order things. And when we did he just gave us a blank look and said OK or YEAH. We ordered the loco moco poutine with has option of spam or hamburger and he didn't even bother to ask which we wanted. We had to tell him to make sure he knew. We had to order our Bahn mi through the other bar tender, who was a smidge more personable. Our food came and it smelled and looked amazing. But once we took a bite of the poutine... it wasn't very good. Gravy was too thick and bland. The Bahn mi sandwich was decent. The pork belly was cooked well but all I tasted was raw jalapeno. We finished our drinks and No one asked if we wanted a refill. We asked for the check and waited forever because the guy was talking to other patrons. We had to ask again because we thought he forgot. Then I think he realized we were upset and then started being friendly. A little too late. He made small talk about my tattoo and informed me that he was a tattoo artist. Not sure why is was working the bar. Overall... this wouldn't such a bad place if the service was even decent but the customer service is non existent and the bar was dirty, it had a bunch of dried beer on it and had not been wiped. Not sure if I came on an off day or what, but I really don't understand how it has such  good reviews.",

The servers were so knowledgeable and friendly, they brought us over samples of beers they thought we'd like without us even requesting to try them. I also loved the asian fusion in the menu and that their support of the local community is reflected in both the food (using Great Buns bread) and beer menu. We will definitely be back!",

We went in around 1130 on a Saturday and sat at the bar. The bartender was very friendly and offered great service. We enjoyed their beer selection and immediately ordered one for the lady and I.  We ordered the brisket banh mi and a burger for the lady with fries. The brisket was $11 with an extra $3 for a side salad. The burger was around the same. The burger came out and was good but small and overpowered by the lettuce on top. The brisket sandwich lacked any brisket. A $11 brisket sandwich should have more than one layer of brisket. It also didn't complement the bread (which was good). The bread was large and at least three times the height of the brisket which further made the lack of brisket even more significant. The sandwich had good flavors but ultimately would have been happier eating at subway.  Hopefully they're able to add some more meat to that sad sad brisket sandwich.  Tldr: beers great food lacks value.",

My friend and I sat at the bar and all the bartenders that helped us were friendly. They also let me try a couple of their beers before I decided. It took a while for us to get our bill though and we had to ask twice. Their food is quite average. Portions are generous, but flavors are not all there. We shared the furikake tuna burger, the crispy chicken skins, and the traditional poutine. We like the crispy chicken skins the most (the one at carson kitchen is way better though). Tuna burger was edible, but nothing special. I say skip the poutine. The fries was soggy and flavorless and the gravy was tasteless. I'd go back for their beers, but not for their food.",

I appreciated the advice on the poutines! While we ordered the bad ass chili poutine, we ended up with the beer cheese poutine. It wasn't the end of the world, since the beer cheese poutine was pretty good anyway.  I liked the industrial overhaul from what the Elements restaurant was, but I'm not a fan of the not well lit interior. I like to see my food, and my company, and it makes taking food pictures a lot more challenging (I realize that's a dumb reason :) ).  We ended up with beer cheese poutine, pork belly burger, and crispy chicken skins. Beer cheese poutine was tasty, even though it wasn't what we ordered, but it wasn't really a poutine, more like fries with cheese sauce. The crispy chicken skins were good, it wasn't greasy, but the sweet chili sauce it came with was a let down. The pork belly burger was the highlight of the meal. So. Delicious. Nothing needed to change about it.  Overall I would be back again since it's close to home and has some truly delicious options.",

I felt welcome here.   And the food was fantastic.   --  I've now been here 3 more times.  Food and service continue to be fantastic.  Great salads.  Best double fried fries ever.   Server Casey. Incredibly warm and friendly.   Thanks 595   --------------- Again and again and again.  I think my naive and I who live in Alaska patronize 595 as much as a local.   Can't stop coming here.  Stopped by yet again.  I thought I'd be good with a song order.  Nope! I had to order a second serving.  So juicy , flavorful, easy to bite a chunk of chicken protein off a bone.   Between the gourmet fries The artistic salads , and the beer.  I wish I lived next door.  Well..... then I'd be drunk and stuffed all the time!  Hmmmm Not a bad idea.   Wanna get stuffed and buzzed.   Come in! ------  Next day 4-12-18  Stopped by AGAIN! The VERY NEXT DAY!?  I must like this place!!! --------------  4-16/18.  AGAIN!!! Damn the fries here are fantastic.  I've tried to make my own at home. Water soaking  Double frying, getting the best counter top Grier I can get...( no such thing)  595 soaks their potatoes for thee hours in cold water to draw the starches out, then fries them.  Then...... Fries then a second time.  Makes me want to spend 400$ on my own 220v fryer to use next to my outdoor grill.....  hmmmm maybe not.   It's a lot easier to get served these delicacies at 595 and get s beer to boot. ( faster too)  The wings are so juicy.  I'm afraid to try to poutine, it's also made from scratch.  My bellies big enough.  I have enough addictions.   The fries are one of them.   Servers and ambiance are so warm.  Thanks 595! -----------/ AGAIN. 4th visit this week ! God the fries are orgasmic.  Casey. Our favorite server.  Smiley,warm,conversational when time allows.  What a gem.",

    "text": "The rise of gastropubs have reached an apex in the valley; many of which offer a wide variety of beers to tickle ones curiousity. 595 is no exception. A solid combination of stouts, ales and sours can fill up your beeradvocate card quickly. I came for the Belching Beaver Mexican Peanut Butter Stout and the Cherry Sour. The one impressive and ever changing trait is the menu. Yes, they do have the typical bar favorites as the hamburger and fries, but they include banh mis, poutine, and other savory dishes that beats the usual \"x food pairs with y beer\" archtype. The crispy chicken skins are so devishly delicious.",

The food was delicious, the beer was exceptionally cold, and the customer service was great. I ordered the Pork Belly Banh Mi, which was sexy AF. Just the right amount of spice, sweet, and savory. The fries were fresh as hell and complimented the sando perfectly. Damn good beer as well. The owners really know their sh*t. If you want to get away from the hustle & bustle of the strip and have a good beer & burger, I definitely recommend stop by and becoming a regular here. Prices are pretty decent considering the selection of brews on tap and the quality of food.  Best part for me was the cold strip!!! Never have I ever seen such a thing; keep your drinks cold on the bar. DOPE AS HELL!!!!",

TVs everywhere, of course, with a clear view in every seat.  The food is not amazing, but I really enjoy the Asian/Vietnamese fusion. I tried their Furikake Tuna Burger, Craft Burger (added bacon and egg), and Hot Fried Chicken Sandwich. The tuna burger was just okay, but I really liked the Craft Burger. During happy hour, I like getting the Bahn Mi slider and my boyfriend LOVES the Chicken Skins, which I personally don't like, as it basically tastes like all fried breading and barely any actual chicken skin.   On nice days out, they slide the windows up so you can feel some breeze, adding some more *chill* to the bar. They also have wifi, games (like Cards Against Humanity, Cranium playing cards), and coloring books!",

I added an egg and the soggyness created a perfect addition.  The beer menu is quite good with a bunch of unknown San Diego breweries on draft.  They let you sample which I always enjoy, though no flights were offered.  The entrees ranged from $9-13 and the beers were around $6-7.  Plenty of TVs and high tops make it a great spot to watch some sports if in the area.  The food is very unique with a Vietnamese entree feel, but also specializing in poutine and fries.  Overall I really enjoyed 595 and recommend it as a new beer locale in the city.",

We got the crispy chicken skins , the fried deviled eggs And the pretzel with beer cheese . All we're very good and would reorder .   The ambience is part dive and part gastropub .

They have a few games in the corner that you can play while you wait or as a social thing if you're with friends. The food is spectacular also my mom and I went and I had the pork belly burger, she had the chili cheese burger and we split the beer cheese fries!! YYYUUUUMMMMMMMM is all I can say! The one suggestion I have maybe indicating on the menus items that are spicy. I know we could've asked as well but sometimes it's nice to know ahead of time. The chili on the burger had a pretty good kick to it.",

This place isn't close to home and I'd like to come back and try again, but I definitely won't go out of my way again.   My boyfriend loves beer but I prefer ciders and I checked Yelp before going to see what ciders they had but tonight they only had 1 to choose from. The cider was really really good and smooth, but I chose not to try anything else.  Food wise, also disappointed. I was sooo excited to try the Signature Banh Mi but the meat was dry, crispy and burnt on the edges, and there wasn't enough versus the bread ratio. The French fries were squishy, my fave, but my boyfriend prefers them more crisp.",

It is a cute little place on rainbow and you can choose to sit either at the bar or in their little dining room area. I would say that their food ranges from regular bar foods to Asian fusion. And they have a good variety of beers on tap, kombucha, wines, and even nitro cold brew coffees.   I had the cocktail called the Mezcal Cup and it was very light and refreshing with the mint and cucumber. Something I would definitely order every time especially around the summer time.   The traditional poutine was really great. The gravy wasn't too bland or too heavy and with their perfectly crispy fries and fried egg on top made it heavenly.   So I love banh mi's and theirs just hits the spot. I had the pork belly and the pork was marinated very well and it was a good slice of meat that wasn't too fatty which is what I was worried about. It had a jalapeno aioli as well as pickled vegetables like a traditional one would.   I would really want to go again to try more of the sides and other banh mi's",

Both of the sandwiches were amazing and their beer selection was through the roof as well.   The only gripe I had about this place was their fries.

Stopped in for dinner, we were seated right away. We ordered the Thai cashew hummus which was amazing. It comes with grilled pita and crispy wonton chips. And topped with a little bit of pickled veggies. That was my favorite item. I decided to go with the broccolini banh mi as my entree. The waitress did warn me it was spicy. I wanted to like but the sauce was overpowering the entire sandwich and it wasn't a good sauce. So that was disappointing. But the BF got their garbage fries: brisket, pork belly, chicken, mozzarella cheddar, guacamole, pico de Gallo and cilantro lime crema. That dish we both enjoyed. The flavors were great, like carne asada fries on crack. Fries were crispy and not soggy.   Overall good experience here, really enjoyed the vibe. Good service too. Hoping to come back to try another dish when we are in town again.",

Husband got here first to arrange for seats while I picked up the family. Good thing he was there, very busy and we needed a big table! There are about five high tables, high bar seating around back wall and a bank of tables with half bench seats. The bar has plenty of seats.   Ordered a Odell's pale ale on tap, nice and cold. For apps we tried the Fried Deviled Eggs Togarashi + Scallion + Gochujang Aioli. Pretty good, the fried shell crunchy while egg remains moist.  We also got the Garbage Nachos Brisket + Pork Belly + Chicken House Cheese Blend + Pico de Gallo + Guacamole + Cilantro Lime Crema. Really good, fresh not too spicy.   For the main event, I chose the Signature Banh Mi Honey Soy Glazed BBQ Pork + Cucumber + Pickled Veggies + Cilantro + Jalapeno + Mayo + Maggi. It was on a great baguette, fresh, both crunchy and soft. I loved the fresh cilantro and the thinly slice jalapeno. Meat tender and tasty.   Three of the family tried the Pork Belly Burger* Cabbage Slaw + Gochujang Aioli + Fried Shallots, it was bit spicy for some. But I thought the spice just right.   And someone tried the Beer Brined Chicken Wings Buffalo, Gochujang Honey Fish Sauce or Hoisin Sambal + Buttermilk Dressing + Celery Sticks. She thought them to be too spicy, I didn't try them but my husband agreed about too hot, but he's not much of a heat guy!  Overall, impressed with the freshness, the spice and the combinations, loved it and would go again. Wait staff quick and attentive, friendly and helpful with selections.",

    "text": "This is a truly sad story. Whoever's vision it was to create this concept spent a ton of time, imagination and money to put this restaurant together. They did a fantastic job, 5.5 on the restaurant scale. But, if you are someone like me, who doesn't necessarily understand craft beer, you are going to need a bartender that is patient and understands people's beer taste to get them what they like. And, as a bartender that wants to work at a craft beer bar, you should want to get the customer the perfect beer because they will take your recommendation on anything moving forward. Gain the trust, get the money =) What happened at my experience is that I arrived on a Sunday afternoon, there were two tables sat in the dining room, and two people sitting at the bar. The bartender asked me what I would like to drink and like any human being, when there's a million choices, it will take a second. I told the bartender what I usually drink, she poured me two small samples and I didn't like either. She looked super frustrated so I asked the gentleman to the left of me what type of beer he was drinking. He said some sort of IPA. I said, \"fine, I will have one of what he is having.\" The beer was definitely not the type of beer I would ever drink again but I didn't want to deal with the bartender's attitude to find the perfect match for my palette. To the investors, owners, or whoever, you did so much work to put this restaurant together and it is sad that someone who gets paid minimum wage and has no stake in the game and most likely doesn't care, can ruin your vision and the guest experience to the point where I am writing a novel to tell you something is definitely broken at your bar. Best of luck, your menu is fantastic =)",

We also ordered the garbage nachos and the hangover fries. Hands down the fries were the most popular at our table. The nachos are really good, but that fry sauce and pickled chilis made the fries that much better. They both come out on a platter and could easily feed 3 people each, unless you're super hungry, Either way, the portions are decent. We didn't have any room for the bread pudding and was told this particular batch wasn't always going to be available, so I hope it'll be around when I return.

From the loco moco poutine to the bread pudding of the day; you are sure to be pleased with all the offerings at 595. On my most recent visit - we ordered pulled pork belly tacos (it was the daily special), a pork belly banh mi and s'mores bread pudding.   The pork belly tacos were delicious - cooked to a juicy and tender perfection. The tortillas were just a tad too \"crisp\" for my liking and I do wish there was a little less guac and a little more salsa - however, it was still great and I would definitely have them again. The pork belly banh mi is still my favorite offering at 595. It's so good, ya'll! Amazingly seasoned pork belly accompanied by cucumber, pickled veggies, cilantro and an amazing jalapeno mayo...I promise it will not disappoint. I wish I had a photo to share but I was way too busy stuffing my face. The bread pudding changes frequently. The s'mores bread pudding was so good! Previously, we had a peanut butter cup bread pudding. Also delicious, but slightly too sweet for my taste.  Overall, always a great experience here. It does get a little crowded during major sports games - other than that, all tables are fair game. Stop in soon!",

    "text": "I might've been a little hard-pressed to give more than 4 stars if I'd visited here only for food, but now that I'm also a fan of craft beer, this is one of my new favorite spots.  595 Craft and Kitchen is a gastropub in an area of town which isn't as well-known for that sort of thing. As I suggested above, the highlight is their craft beer selection, which is comprised of 24 rotating draft beers from local and remote breweries, more so the latter. That's great for someone like me who wants to have new tastes, and so are the $5-7 prices for most of the taps (with a few understandably pricier choices).  I won't spend (relatively) too much time on describing the beers themselves, but considering my enjoyment of each of my choices, it's a feather in 595's cap that they've procured such a selection.  I started with some beers priced awesomely for happy hour ($1 off non-local beers, from Mon-Fri 3-6pm and midnight-close), namely Mikkeller (San Diego)'s Big Hazy NE TIPA ($4 for about 10-12 oz) and the Mother Earth / Melvin collaboration Four Seasons, Spring 2018 edition (also $4 for about 10-12 oz). The Big Hazy was delicious and somewhat reminiscent of the trendy hazy IPA style, while the Four Seasons stayed more toward traditional yet fruit-tinged IPA territory.  Next, I ventured into the specials of this particular day, the $4.20 beers. I got the New Belgium Hemperor HPA first, and I'm glad to have had such a unique experience. It smells exactly like the smoke produced by one method of usage of a particular recreational/medicinal drug which has been legalized in certain states, including Nevada. The burps also have that scent. Then I went for the Lagunitas Waldos' Special Ale, which is inspired by the group credited with creating the term 420, but certainly doesn't have as much of that \"dank\" quality. However, I still enjoyed the rich, relatively \"sweet\" flavor and would gladly order it again.  Food-wise, I mostly stuck to the aforementioned happy hour deals. They'll be more than enough to satisfy my palate next time I come here, although I wouldn't mind branching out.  The banh mi slider ($3) was surprisingly True to what you might expect if you miniaturized a grilled pork Vietnamese sandwich, including all the veggies, a small baguette, a hit of something spicy, and even mayonnaise. I won't make any claims due to my inebriated status, but I would order that again.  The fries ($3) were a gigantic portion of somewhat thickly cut potatoes, and I liked them despite most pieces ending up relatively soft. They came with one helping of ketchup and two helpings of something that's like a fry/special/secret sauce, but slightly different - a higher amount of horseradish, perhaps? I enjoyed them from start to end of meal, hot to cold (room temp).  The chicken wings ($5) came out with a less-than-ideal sauce, after the bartender defaulted to buffalo style without asking me for my choice, but I still enjoyed them. Five moist pieces arrived with a mild version of buffalo sauce, proper seasoning, and a moist if not juicy interior. The ranch and celery were therefore not strictly necessary, but they were fun. These aren't battered, but you'll be able to find enough carbs elsewhere I'm sure.  I was also able to try the special of the day in the food realm, namely 2 tacos for $4.20. They were pork belly \"chicharron\" tacos, and both came out with properly cooked(!) tortillas, which sometimes is a challenge for restaurants for some reason. The belly was rich in flavor and had crunchy bits, and the guacamole added enough creaminess to make it not so boring. Hopefully they'll consider making this a more permanent menu item.  Atmosphere was great, although I should disclaim that having the proper amount of beer makes every place pretty tolerable. It was on the louder side, but not so much that you couldn't hold a conversation. Service was pretty solid aside from denying me the chance to try some of the fancier chicken wing sauces (but I've decided to try those in the future already, so I'm not too bummed).  I will definitely return to 595 Craft and Kitchen, especially for weekday happy hour. This is the best and most affordable combination of craft beer and great food in town so far, and although it's somewhat far from Henderson, I've been known to drive to Rainbow Blvd on a weekly basis in the past.",

Well 595 has all three with out a doubt. 24 taps of Stouts, ales, IPA's, Sours, constantly changing line up of kegs so always something new to sink your taste buds into. Now for the really \"cool\" part. The bar counter top has an ice cold steel rail built into it that you set your beer glass on top of to keep you drink ice cold.(I've included pictures) I've only seen this at one other bar before (in Salt Lake City) I can't believe more places haven't incorporated this awesome experience enhancing addition.   The bar and table area is not too big so it can fill up fast. We were in on a Saturday evening and it started out real quiet but a few hours in and the place was bustling. People laughing, drinking, eating and having a good time. The decor is pub style, clean and comfortable. Two unisex bathrooms that are well kept also.    The food menu is just the right size and will satisfy the hardiest of beer munchies. Items range from finger foods, salads, Springs rolls, nachos to unique sandwich and burger choices. Tonight we snacked on the Thai hummus appetizer (flavor explosion )while sipping on bar tender recommended IPA's.   The whole staff seemed to take on any duty necessary to keep everyone eating, drinking and having a good time. I especially enjoy that there is no video poker and that they're not just another run of the mill, cookie cutter, average, smoke filled Vegas strip mall bar.   Unique, fun and satisfying. Get down and get join the party for yourself. What are you waiting for!!!?????",

I added a farm fresh egg - they broke the egg, probably while building, bummer. He got his with bacon. This made them $15 burgers. Were they? Not really. Probably would've paid $12 total. They were cooked great, good size; a little fatty. Probably a 70/30 ground beef.  Last note: they have games there including cards against humanity, in case you don't want to watch sports on one of their three screens.",

I know, typically, people hate this but I'm born and raised in Vegas and any place that doesn't let me stay there all night is a win in my book! That means that I know for certain my boyfriend can't convince me to stay out longer than 2, and we get to say we closed the bar down ! Second of all, there's no gaming and you can't smoke inside. Yes and yes ! I won't lose extra money feeding the game machine after I've had too much to drink! I also won't come home smelling like an ashtray.   We came on a Friday night and it wasn't packed but they were busy enough. It took awhile for anybody to come around and take our order which is where the one star drops off. Whenever they did come around (which wasn't often) they were really nice though. In the corner they have a ton of games you can choose from to play with your friends. Our group chose exploding kittens! We had a really great time :).  Also we all ordered different things and every one of us was pleased with our selections. The deviled eggs, hummus, spring rolls, and pork bun were all a hit at our table ! Will definitely be back to try out more craft beers, more of their food menu, and to play some games while doing so.  Good hangout spot !",

They support local business and promote local brews, which makes this place a cornerstone for good eats. The ambiance is fantastic, with tables that have that butcher block nouveau feel. It's comfortable and the service is fantastic. What's even better is the food.  The menu has an amazing variety of Asian and American fare, from their in-hoise cured pork belly to the Butcher Block (the Vegas meat vendor, yes) burger, and their varieties of poutine. We have the chicken wings, Asian style, and their made from scratch burrata with ginger apricot chutney a try for starters. The wings hit hard with great soy and gochuchang flavor, crispy on the first bite, and finger licking good--literally.  The burrata is a gentle cloud of cheese goodness that is enhanced by the chutney.   The butcher block burger is so well seasoned and cooked to perfection that squeezing down with my fingers against the bun bring out a lot of juice. The toppings don't overpower the great flavor of the burger itself, but compliment it with every bite. On top do the beautiful bun, it's a perfect meal with or without fries. However, the fries here are made with love, so I strongly suggest ordering a side with aioli. The hot Fried chicken is spicy, crunchy goodness topped with cool lettuce and pickles. It's just a great chicken sandwich that satisfies any southern chicken cravings. I highly recommend the poutine made with gravy made in house and some cheese curds and a fried egg. Lovely, crispy fries that don't get soggy even with gravy, it was creamy, perfectly flavored goodness. I wanted to lick the paper! I know now that every visit here will include poutine no matter what.  Dessert was amazing, served in the cutest jars and with crumbles that felt like my childhood cookie dreams on a plate. The dark chocolate dessert topped with sea salt and crumble, olive oil drizzle and roasted hazelnuts was crunchy, chocolate goodness. Almost close to a ganache but still at a mousse consistency, I enjoyed every chocolatey, nutty bite. Their cheesecake topped with yuzu and served with strawberries and a shortbread crumble with olive oil drizzle made my night! Light, citrus tones and sweet cookie crumble made this dessert a must for those wanting a sweet but light finish.  Paired with local beers, each part of the experience was fun and a True experience. I love the fact that the owner and chef work hard to make everything from scratch, because it shows with every bite. I appreciate the care and love in the food, and look forward to our trip through the menu soon.   Followers, you know how my five stars don't come easy. Trust me when I say this place deserves five full stars. You won't regret eating here, ever.",

Our bartender took the time to ask us what kind of drinks we liked, to better compliment our tastes. Incredibly friendly and easy to talk to. When you walk in, its open seating. You'll find that the atmosphere is friendly and cozy. Perfect place to catch up with a friend or watch the game.  But what I came here for is the Vietnamese geared food, with a twist. Yes, they do have food such as fries and chicken. But what caught my attention was their Beef Brisket Banh Minh Sandwich and Pork Belly Burger. Both of which were delicious! Both dished we ordered were a blend of tender meat, cooked to perfection, fresh and crisp radish and carrots. I will say that their meat does lean on the salty side. These are great when paired with their fries.  But if a burger or sandwich isn't what your craving, fear not! You have the option to opt for a salad or taste something light from their appetizers. Or, if you feel like having sweets they do have something to help you satisfy that as well. They have bread pudding, cheesecake, and chocolate budino(kind of like a cake/pudding hybrid)!",

I remember seeing a food instagrammer post about this place so I checked it out immediately! To be honest, we both were not expecting this place to be that good since I never kept up with those food bloggers. Plus, it is a beer pub.  HOWEVER, this place had so many craft beers to choose from. Our server let us try samples until we could decide what to order. We even told her that we are a blonde ale fan and she knew immediately what to reach out for (Super chill and sweet). Each server checked up on us on a timely manner and it wasn't difficult to reach out to them even if the table/bar area is a bit segregated.  Now with the food, the fried deviled eggs were amazing. The crispiness with the soft boiled eggs were an amazing combination. The gochujang aioli wasn't super spicy and overpowering either. The pork belly banhmi had a nice jalapeno kick to it and the craft burger was extremely juicy.   I would definitely come back again to try the other beers and menu items. The menu items definitely has a twist of American and Asian fusion, which I love!!",

The prices were really good for draft beers. This is the only part that deserves more than 2 stars.   Service: our waiter seemed seriously annoyed that he had to wait on us. Party of 6 that included 2 kids and 4 adults. If you can't act happy to serve people you need to be sent home.   Food: mediocre at best. We ordered a salad it was ok. 2 appetizers that came out with our meals. The kids food came out very last and it was the chili. The temperature of the chili was so hot we had to add several ice cubes to it. Not acceptable. We also ordered A bob mi sandwich that was tasteless.   They did have games for the family to play. That was a plus.",

All that hard work and preparation shows in the layers of flavor the chef at 595 is able to produce. The combinations of flavors, service, and excellent craft beer pairings will keep me coming back for more.  In fact we came back the next day to get more great food and beers.   I got to try the Burrata with Ginger Apricot Chutney, Gochujang Honey Chicken Wings, Traditional Poutine, Hot Fried Chicken Sandwich, and the \"Butcher Block\" Craft Sandwich paired with a Mother Earth Big Mother Triple IPA. We came back the following day for the Craft Popcorn, Pork Belly Burger, and Banh Mi. The \"Butcher Block\" burger is named as such because the meat comes from the Butcher Block just down the street and the beautiful buns are locally sourced from Great Buns. The chicken  in the Hot Fried Chicken Sandwich stays crispy even with the hot sauce on it. That Pork Belly Burger had me wanting to order another one. I'm hooked on their Banh Mi and am excited to go back and try it with pork belly. All sauces are scratch made and flavorful. Needless to say that I think the food at 595 is amazing. I could write for days about it, but you should try it for yourself.",

They focus on high- quality food then a regular pub. Very unique menu not often seen. I'm pretty sure there's no other pub in town like this. Right away I noticed crispy chicken skin on their menu. That was to die for. The skin was fried perfectly. It comes with a dipping sauce was so good!! I devoured that too!!   Now I'm a very picky eater when it comes to banh mi sandwiches. Meat needs to be tender and has to have lots of good flavors and bread needs to be perfect, not hard. I can't believe a place like this makes one of the best Banh mi sandwich!!   For those times you just feel like getting a drink and eating some really good food 595 craft and kitchen is the place! I will definitely be back to try their burgers and desserts.",

    "text": "Quickly becoming my favorite spot for grubs in Vegas. They're a new joint - and doing quite well so it seems.   Went in Wednesday night (the place is tucked away behind the rainbow Walgreens) - and was blown away. Cute place (tiny, but still seemingly ample seating), great decor, awesome vibe with the music - reminds me of a bar I would visit in beach town Charleston, SC.   Amazing service on Wednesday. Offered to sample many beers I wasn't familiar with. Ended up doing a beer/food pairing. Van, took great care of me and was very enthusiastic about my food selections. Always a good vibe when they get hyped about how you're eating the food.   Outstanding food. Seriously. Incredible. And very very fair priced. A side of out-of-this-world pork belly is very generous for $5. I went in alone, and crushed..  -an appetizer of the fried deviled eggs (being from the south - this was a foodgasm) // paired with blueberry wheat -Mixed greens salad with the garlic chicken and pork belly (omfg. Awesome. And they have chopsticks to enjoy the food slowly as intended) // paired with farmhouse ale -Nutella Dark Chocolate Almond Bread Pudding (I shared a photo with a friend.. this is a party in your mouth) // paired with cali' creamin.   The dessert was so damn good I almost ordered a second round. Except by this point I was stuffed.   SO I CAME BACK ON THURSDAY. I had to try the burgers. Had to. And god, am I glad I did. Also incredible. Perfect bun.   Only downside? Menu offered grilled or fried onions.. grilled onions gross me out so I asked for fried. They're still grilled.. bartender told me he meant to tell me that. Service tonight was okay, but not as mind blowing as Wednesday - they seemed preoccupied with personal convos. But no biggie. The food made up for it!! And the place is new, so turnover is bound to happen while ironing it out! Besides, once I got my bread pudding, all was forgotten.   Will definitely be back. And again soon.",

The staff is pretty laid back. Very friendly and professional if you are not a beer savvy type of person like I am. The bartender was helpful and patient enough to have me try a bunch of IPA samples and find that one taste I'd like.   I already know I do not like the super hoppy taste. I wanted a fruit taste to help. I don't remember the name of the IPA I had at the time, but it was a great taste. Too bad they didn't carry it the second time. I do remember having an \"Abomination IPA\" recently and that was pretty good. To be honest, I'm amazed that I'm drinking these types of beers.   Anyway, aside from the amazing selection of craft beers. They have a surprising food menu that I typically don't see at a \"bar/brewery.\" For example, they have friggin banh-mi sandwiches?! I didn't have to go to Chinatown or a Vietnamese restaurant for that. I ordered the shredded chicken banh-mi and it was soooo good. Also, the popular deviled eggs are worth it, the hangover fries (must), and the Craft Burger! (yess).   It will be my mission to try the rest of the menu as I'm sure it's all yummy. At least I can wash it down trying out new IPAs lol,",

Both burgers were super juicy, the egg's texture was silky with a runny yummy yolk, and the pork belly was braised & seasoned perfectly and soft as hell. The nachos were coo, no wow factor to me, the pieces of pork belly were a little dry but the dollop of guac on it was bomb. 5 stars cause the service was cherry, food came out in a timely manner, atmosphere and vibe were chill, nice and knowledgeable server & they have a lot of specials going on. If you check in you get a free beer, I forget what it was called but it was light and crisp! Also was told for any game that's playing, they hold happy hour the ENTIRE game!

Solid craft beer pub with great pub grub minus the typical craft beer snobbery.  Food is where it's at.  This is beer food.  Flavors are bold and punchy.  Mate, you know how a pub works; order and share.  Fried deviled eggs (boiled, halved, coated in panko and togarashi and deep fried till golden brown then refilled with a gochujang aioli mixed back with its hard boiled yolk) makes for the perfect palate cleanser to nearly any hoppy offering.  Wings, not bad.  Well fried, well drained but excessively sauced.  The hoisin sambal, sweet chili and honey garlic BBQ tasty but strong begging for more light ales and lagers.  Pork belly bahn mi, very good.  Big slab of tender braised pork belly finished in a hoisin sambal glaze, this time taking advantage of the earthy, sweet, spicy stickiness to pair well with the jalapeno mayo and brightened by a handful of fresh cilantro and a tiny amount of pickled veg.   Beer food.  Better yet, the hot fried chicken sandwich.  Boneless, crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside thick chunk of chicken seasoned with fiery spices, deep fried, and splashed with hot sauce with a toasted brioche bun slathered with mayo simple lettuce and a slice of tomato.  Fiery kick and good eats!  Various poutines (traditional, hangover and stoner sampled), all A-OK.  This isn't Quebec so...  Very well chosen cross section of beer from all genres at all octane levels (light buzz to F you up).  US producers.  Good selection from local producers.  Changes regularly.  Good off Strip prices.  Daily HH.  15:00 - 18:00 M-F with reverse 23:00 - Close M-R.  See website for changing specials and details.  A bloody fine way to refuel and take the edge off before returning to the grind that is Vegas.",

I like that the selections will rotate in and out.. so each time they should be a new experience!  The food and service was outstanding! We didn't wait on anything, all items came out hot, fresh and as ordered. Our waiter suggested a few things, and Oooomygawd they were delicious!  I'll be recommending this place to others, and come back myself again.. great job :-)",

This was one of their suggestions of the best things they served and I could see why. It was full of amazing flavor and texture. The side salad was great as well. The third and fourth pictures were the fried deviled eggs and they were off the chain! Don't get a chance to have fried deviled eggs very often, but these were the best ones I've ever had. Also came with the gochujang aioli that absolutely made it. The wait staff was super helpful and cool. This is a must try spot for sure!",

Flavor was great, decent amount of heat, but I asked for no pickles but it came with it anyway. Picked them off but still had some pickle juice on the sandwich which I'm really not a fan of. My friend got the seared ahi tuna burger, so juicy and cooked just right.   Went during a really slow hour, it was just me and my friend and another couple in the dining room, but it took a while to get our orders taken and then when it came time to pay the bill I couldn't find anyone. Had to wait at the bar about 5 minutes before someone asked how they could help so I could pay the bill. I understand that if a place is busy that waiting is to be expected. But there were literally only 2 tables occupied.",

The unique offerings....especially IPA's.....was really special for a relatively small place with a neighborhood feel.   The Brouwerij West Picnic Lightning ($8), Revision Battle of the Lords ($6) and Bearded Iris Offbeat ($8) were right down my alley.  My friend went with a crazy Modern Times Nitro Stout ($6) and Belching Beaver Mosaic ($6) - and enjoyed them thoroughly.   We ordered the Thai Cashew Hummus ($9) and loved it - the Lavash cracker pairing was a very different dipping approach that we both enjoyed.   My buddy had his eye on the Hot Chicken Sandwich ($10) as it was called out in reviews and by our waiter as spicy.  He didn't leave any of it behind :)   I went with the Chicken Banh Mi ($9) and the toppings were really fresh - however I'd rather have less \"bread\" vs meat/toppings to enhance the flavor experience.  The fries on the side ($3) were awesome!  Service from Van Alan was spot on.  Love this place and can't wait to come back!",

Lots of local brews and a few to the east that were more my taste.  They have a signature Banh Mi sandwich with pork but I opted for the Pork belly instead.  Man was it a treat.  Full of flavor and priced right.  Small place with about 10-12 bar seats and several tables and booths.  Kid friendly so that's a plus.  The only thing different is they do not do flights of beer.

Not only is he unfriendly but he has no effing idea wtf to do to help a customer!!!

ARE YOU FU***NG kidding me?? You are the owner of a bar/ restaurant and you lack the balls to own up to the poor service your guests are receiving???

    "text": "So always had 595 on my radar. Since it was my birthday got to decide the restaurant celebrate with my roommates. Gastropub is there any better spot! You get quality craft beers from small micro brews all around the world and great food. Think not!  My frist impression nothing new reading past reviews was dam walking into dark abyss. We went for early dinner so lot of natural light out. Soon walk in think someone moved the clock forward. I missed cool buffalo head on one of the walls. Thankfully my roommate caught it in the darkness. The rolling garage door on one side that assume better weather might open it up. The bar area is small not many seats but love the way all set up. The whole place is really small. Later in the night once got pack it can get loud. Overall fan of the vibe of the whole look just think weird that the place is so dark.   The craft beer list is TOP NOTCH. I am in no way craft expert but they have lot of beers that hardly see and nice selection from IPA, and list goes on. Our server made two great recommendations based on thinking red ale or new castle style. She like can give you sample of each. She found the perfect beer celebrate my birthday.  The food was awesome!!! It was not planned but got in on some of the HH food. We got three items for appetizers. The Fried Devil Eggs, Beer and Cheese Poutine, and Mini Banh Mi sliders (we got the signature chicken ones; if going get them HH it one per order and basically half size regular size Banh MI). The Devil Eggs never really had them fried traditional size many times. It adds another element with either panko or breadcrumbs coated on the outside. Its nice crispy outside then have perfect hard boiled egg with the filling that creamy, delicious, and addicting cause pop one in mouth just want more. The poutine fries was solid. It interesting that they have five different ones. Not many places serve it so kind of cool seeing few options besides traditional. Honest need try the traditional next go around cause not having brown gravy on it  feel off. Beer and Cheese great combination. The portion size is nice. It definitely made to share cause for one that lot of food. The little Banh Mi slider was winnah winnah chicken dinner. The bread was on point. The bread for me makes or break Banh Mi. The whole sandwich was tasty. The price was great for HH and think about portion size. One of the better HH food menus. My entree had Banh Mi before got HH ones. I got another one but tried the beef brisket one instead. It was really good. But honestly if had choose between the two would go back to the chicken or signature one. The beef brisket felt like little dried out but the filling with the sauce, vegetables, and the bread all good still. Just if had choose not order it again.   The service was awesome. Maybe cause went for early dinner and not as busy. She was very attentive, friendly, made great recommendations on beer selection, and great service. I definitely see myself coming back to try more of the menu. Till the next time...",

Their service is supper friendly and attentive. We ordered a lot of different dishes and shared with each other. I'm Vietnamese, and I rarely eat American food. But their food is the BOMB. I think there a combination of Vietnamese style in their American food. That's why I enjoyed all dishes we ordered!!! My favorite are chicken wings with fish sauce and banh mi belly pork. It was too damn good! I would say I was addicted to chicken wings and ordered extra one to eat at the hotel :) Fiends, if you are in Vegas, come and check out this place. You will love it. FOR SURE!!!",

    "text": "595 Craft and Kitchen  Disclaimer alert...I don't drink.  I eat.  That being said, this review is about their food and service.  Overall service was good. Our server was very attentive and our items served quickly. If I had one complaint about the service, it was our server's negative comments about Yelpers. I'm not going into details to what she said.  She basically accused all Yelpers of being unethical. Bottom line, her comments put a bad taste in my mouth. What didn't put a bad taste in my mouth was their Fried Crispy Chicken Skins. This was so good, crispy, tasty, and not greasy.  If there's one food item to get at 595, this is it.  I also tried their Beer Cheese (pretzel bread w/beer cheese) and the Craft Burger.  The beer cheese lacked flavor and the burger was on the salty side.  Actually, I think everything was on the salty side.  Overall, with the exception of the fried chicken skins, everything I tried was just okay.  On the bright side, the pretzel bread and bun was fabulous.  Overall, 595 gets 3 stars from me.  Service is good, their fried chicken skin is excellent, unwarranted comments from our server sucked, and the rest of the food is just \"A-Ok\".",

Being as it was late and I was feeling extra lazy, I decided to find a place that offered it close by.   We ordered pickup and customer service was pleasant. I'm giving two stars based on the food. The chicken skin had too much breading on it and I could barely taste the skin. It literally just tasted like breading. My boyfriend ordered buffalo wings and we could barely taste the buffalo sauce!! It was just fried chicken wings/thighs. I'll take a pass.",

I don't recommend the popcorn - salty and not that great tasting. The burger was good - it helped that there was lettuce and onions in the burger to balance the salty infusion of pork belly and burger meat and sauce. The fries - salty.   I had to drink a full glass of water after my meal to get the salty taste out of my mouth. Hubby ordered a beer so our bill was around $30.",

It comes with crispy pita and chips (a variety with some being salty and some being bland). The staff is friendly and easy going. Great selection of beers especially since they have some sour ales (a favorite of mine!)  Cons: The table was messy like sticky messy. Whoever is cleaning kind of need to be aware of that. The seating area was small so if you have a party of more than 4 be aware because you may need to grab two tables. Burgers were just mediocre which is negative because if in paying 10-15$ for a burger I expect it to be different than whataburger. Not bad but nothing special. Fries are 7$??.... that seems kinda high to me but that's my opinion.  Overall dinner cost 60$ for two people getting burgers ... too pricy in my opinion. I'd check it out simply because of the beer selection though!",

Me and my girlfriend have pronounced 595 as our numero UNO favorite bar/gastropub in town. It hits all the buttons and makes for a great experience consistently every time. Upon 5 visits I find more reasons to love the spot and plan on making a habit on coming more.   The food is SO DARN GOOD. Perhaps the biggest distinguishing factor of this spot. True personality dashed on each dish, it's really hard to go wrong anywhere on the menu. The Vietnamese fusion of classy gastropub dishes is evident throughout the menu and makes for tough selection every time. So far our hands down favorites are that ridiculous dynamite dip (R U kidding this idea is gold) and the banh mi (classic, porkbelly WHATEVA). The beer selection is great too I always try a new IPA every time I stop in!  One of the biggest reasons for our returning is the consistently amazing service and company of the bartenders, especially Charles. That guy is truly awesome, remembered us after our first visit and is so welcoming every time we come back. He balances his dope company with solid service like a True professional and really completes the whole visit. Thank you Charles and thank you 595 for being such an awesome lil joint for us to loiter!",

I'm not sure which was which because the server didn't tell us, but I think I liked the original one. One of our sandwiches took about 30 minutes to come out after the all the other food, so we were literally just sitting there waiting for it. When I saw slider, I thought it would come with a couple like how you usually see with sliders, but it just came with 1. I honestly think I could have skipped this.  fried chicken skins: Delicious, but I would go between \"omg this is so good,\" and then realize I'm eating pure fat and think \"omg I can't keep eating this.\" It's very interesting dish and they give you a lot. I would recommend it, just don't think too much about what it is because you really forget it's chicken skins. I was a big fan of the chili sauce.  fried deviled eggs: Pretty self-explanatory. I liked the sauce it came with.  The service wavered between super helpful to \"I can't even get a glass of water.\" I literally had to try and just keep my hand up to get her attention for some water. We also had to ask for our last sandwich twice before it came.",

With a rustic bar look, the place is very casual, selling their interesting beer menu look.  The staff was friendly, easily asking any questions I had.  The food was great too! Would I come back though? Probably not. Their menu is very similar to many Vietnamese fusion places in town, but with different quirks, such as poutine. The restaurant puts out a wide variety of dishes; while all delicious, are not to the level of similar restaurants such as District One or Bachi Burger. Take this with a grain of salt since these are just my taste buds preferring a less \"hearty\" menu.  The place is delicious to try if you are in the mood, however I believe there are current just better options than 595.",

Since I'm not too knowledgeable about what kind of beers I like, I asked the bartender for recommendations and he gave me a couple different options to taste to find which one I want to commit to. I've been here a few different times and each time I had a different style of beer that I really liked! Their taps are constantly rotating but I know that there's always going to be something I'll like when I come. I give them a ton of props for bringing more craft beer to Vegas!  Now onto the munchies! There are so many good things on the menu that I love.   For appetizers I highly recommend the fried deviled eggs and the chicken skins. Both are super addicting!   For main dishes all the banh mis are fiiirrree. If you don't know what a banh mi is, crawl out from under that rock and welcome to the best sandwich you've ever had. The hot fried chicken sandwich is also everything I've ever wanted in a chicken sandwich. Make sure to ask for the home made buttermilk (ranch) dressing for your sandwich and fries. It's bomb diggity.   Right now they have a pumpkin spice bread pudding that makes you forget it's still 80 degrees in October. I also love that it comes with home made whipped cream on top.   TL:DR Come for the craft beer selection; stay for the sandwiches!",

When I lived in Canada all I did was sample poutine and 595's is very very authentic tasting. They just need to add more cheese curds and they'll be solid! The burger and tuna was cooked to upmost perfection. Weird that I paid 2$ for ONE slice of bacon on my burger though.  Drinks ordered Mother Earth beer, powderfinger and after the gold rush. The after the gold rush drink was disgusting and the server was so so nice to me and offered his own drink called the Trinidad sour. THANK YOU ERIC! He was literally psychic because I didn't complain about my drink and he knew i didn't like it. Eric gave me the best service I've ever received at a bar/restaurant. He kept my water filled and kept checking on me to make sure everything was delicious. My mother earth was perfect. Great service, drinks, and food! I will be back :)  Btw it's confusing bc I didn't know if it was open seating and none of the servers had a uniform on",

I tried the pineapple flavored beer which was a little too sweet for my taste but still drinkable. As far as food, the deviled eggs are a must try, the fried chicken burger was awesome, and the bahn mi sandwich was pretty good as well. They just opened a couple months ago so they seem to be finding their groove. Service was a little slow but the place was packed so it's understandable. There was also a lot of confusion with food orders. A few dishes came out to our table that we're meant for other tables but we told them we didn't order them and they figured it out. There's a few menu items we still want to try so we'll be back sometime soon.",

I'd heard about the hummus being pretty great but wasn't really head over heels about it. The wings were just so-so as well. The loco moco fries though, they were excellent and even let us add a slice of pork belly on top. For dessert, we shared the pudding and it was great except for the peanut oil that is drizzled on the plate...that's not a good flavor combination. I suggest honey or anything else but peanut oil. Place wasn't very busy, cooks and staff seemed bored. Very clean establishment, clean bathrooms and adequate space. Since this sits on the corner of Tropicana and Rainbow, I'd hope that they continue to get more business.",

Great beer selection and great bartenders/staff.  Menu looks promising for the most part.  One day, I went there by myself after work and I had an order of chicken wings that didn't agree with me.  I noticed it was bloody inside, sent it back to the kitchen and they voided it.  Mind you, I work in a restaurant on the strip and using a thermometer prior to sending out an order of chicken wings will save you the headache.  I had chicken wings here before and when it's not busy without no issues. Things happen when your busy with happy hour and it being a newer restaurant.  Please don't justify your not wrong by telling the server/bartender to tell you the temperature it came out after my wings were served bloody inside.  If you have a oven and a warmer, please pre bake your wings in the oven, hold it in a warmer, and then fry the wings to order will solve that issue. Logistic and temperature issues solved especially when your busy during happy hour.  I really like this place, but after this incident I think I'll eat at home to be safe.",

Having said that, they are all over priced just like all alcohol in Vegas. We are no where near the strip or DTLV...why should an IPA cost $7? For the sours and beer styles that cost a lot more, and more time to make I understand paying up for a beer....but this is a little much.  While the food is innovative and has great concept, execution  is lacking or just isn't as great as we would hope. We have been several times already because of location, and every time I feel like we spent to much money, more than we planned. I have no problem spending good money on great food and craft beer...but we are just a little let down by 595.",

I ticked a few off my list last night. Next time I'm going for a burger, hearing good things about them, \"each bite is like biting into a steak\". I gotta experience that. I would probably had been happy with either great beer selection or mediocre beer selection and good food but we're getting stellar efforts of both! Bravo and see you next time!",

Then stuffed to the brim we couldn't say no to dessert, a delicious bread pudding. Service was impeccable ,too bad we aren't local, I would definitely come back! Good brew, good food, and good service. Highly recommend !",

I think the deviled eggs are a bit expensive for what you get... but they are still fire(really good). Hot fried chicken sandwich is my favorite sandwich and the hoisin sambal beer chicken wings are dank(even better). Beer and cider taps are epic and I always finish with a somtging out of there broad whiskey selection. High west campfire was tonight's selection. Kasey is the best. Then there is a really sweet Irish girl who's name I forget. But point blank period. Food, drinks and service is off the chain.",

    "text": "Came here on a Sunday evening.    I had the noodle salad topped with egg and seared pork belly.  My friend and I also shared the popcorn of-the-day: kochujang and honey.    The popcorn was a little overly \"wet\" or mushy which I guess was to be expected when mixing it with honey and spicy bean paste.  But we did not get a choice on what kind of popcorn we wanted.  After about halfway in, it became too salty for our palate.  I understand the need to be unique and the blending of flavors, but to me it did not work.  The \"noodle salad\" was reminiscent of the Vietnamese \"bun\" dishes at any pho restaurant.  I thought the chef might have been going for some type of fusion--so naturally I expected more melding of differing flavors East and West.  I saw none of that.  It really looked like an imitation of a pricier and less authentic bun dish.  The noodles used were a bit stiffer and slightly chewier than the vermicelli used in pho restaurants.  Despite the menu's description, it didn't taste any better.   It also got saltier towards the bottom of the bowl.  In a pho restaurant you can add as much of the sweet/savory nam pla as you want, but here it's added when prepped.  It's also more saltier than your traditional nam pla fish sauce.    The pork belly was cooked fairly well--tender and semi-moist.    They had 1 waitress and 1 or 2 bartenders.  Service got slow when the relatively small dining area filled up to about 50-75% capacity.  We were checked up on once after the main course was dropped.   I didn't use the bathrooms, but my friend said they were very clean and immaculate.    No dessert offered and I can't remember if anything was on the menu.  But we went to the Fluff Ice down the road on Russell and Rainbow.",

The food is great as well, their fried deviled eggs are by far the most phenomenal thing you have tasted, creative twist on a deviled egg and so worth a couple orders ;-). Tristian and Kasey are amazing, they are the only staff I have really interacted with since I always make it a point to stop in and say hi to these lovely folks. They are fun, welcoming, knowledgeable, personable, and know how to connect the patrons at their bar to make for a lively social setting. I have met some really awesome people at 595! Great little gem here in Vegas, that's for sure! Do yourself a favor and stop by next time you're on this side of town grab a cold beer and an order of the fried deviled eggs!!",

    "text": "Apparently just opened 6 days ago. Excellent selection of craft beers on tap plus a full bar. The fusion food was absolutely delicious and the sauces were fantastic. The food prices are a little high for the quantity but the flavors were excellent. The fries were the best we have ever had. A bunch of dishes have extra add ons, but it worth it. The fried deviled eggs were very tasty but you only get 4 halves for $9. The spring rolls were super tasty but the wrap could have been much tighter and not so messy. The noodle salad was small but a great flavor especially if you add pork belly. The chicken wings were crispy and juicy. We had the sauce on the side since we didn't know the hoisin and sambal was going to be awesome. Though the chicken sandwich was our least favorite, it was still very good. The food seems to come one at a time and the seating is a free for all. The place is not very big and it filled up fast. Oh, don't let them take your sauces as they clear each plate. We dipped our fries in all the sauces.",

The waitress got our drink order then after we decided on our lunch choices, we waited to order and waited and waited... She clearly is playing the \"I'm busy\" game. Yes, she is by herself in the dining area, but with 3 other tables occupied it's not New years eve in there. She is busing tables and ignoring us Priority is to take our order and as we are waiting she can bus a table, but no we didn't exist.  I finally got up and asked her to attend to us. She acted surprised like 'oh you want to eat?\" I guess the food was ok, the crab dip was oily and no good. Everything else was average, but the waitresses attitude spoiled the lunch. Left a basic tip because of her poor service. What causes this? I have no idea. I will wait in line at the Greek place next time.",

Asked about beers, she told us she didn't KNOW about beers and she would get someone. WTH... a guy server arrived he did not know anything about beer selection. Finally got a menu, and it was a limited food selection... WTH we looked up the menu because we have two vegetarians with us. We asked what was going on and she said it's a Pup UP, where they loan the place out to a different chef. Staff was clearly clueless, had no idea what was going on, asked for the same beer 5 times no one would bring it. These people were brain dead, would ask for napkins and they could not remember to bring them. We thought we were in a time warp... A 5 year old could have done better, we will not come back. I do not know how you Loan your business out and let people who have no idea how to serve, how to explain the menu, what the beer menu is. This is a crazy business plan.",

Inside the ambience is casual and the first thing you see when you walk in is a bar area go the right and then seating area to the left.   It's self seating and the bar was full so we chose to sit in a small table for four. It took a little while to get our drink order. I ordered an apricot cider which was a bit sour but good. My glass had some lipstick stain on it and I was not wearing any lipstick so I had to send it back unfortunately. The waitress was very apologetic and was happy to get me a new glass.   The food was good. We got fried chicken skins and dynamite crab dip for appetizers. The crab dip was pretty good and had a kick to it. The chicken skins were good and reminded me of calamari but everyone on yelp raved about it so far so we had to give it a try.   I ordered the signature banh mi. It was okay. Not the banh mi I'm used to but the bread was soft which I liked. My husband got a pork belly burger and he ate that all up.   Overall, we had a good experience and will most likely come back to try other things on their menu.the random Buffalo head adds a nice touch to the place since it's the only decoration they have on the wall.",

We asked to watch a UFC fight and ended up feeling guilty for wanting to watch it- the bartender was pretty passive aggressive in communicating that it wasn't something she wanted on the tv (which was a bummer because other bar guests ended up watching and enjoying with us!)

The signature banh mi and the buffalo chicken tacos are hands down the best I've had. The service is top notch with knowledgeable bartenders and a very friendly atmosphere. If you have a chance to check this place out, then you most definitely should.",

It was weird tho to add fries with my burger for $3 while the burger didn't have enough flavor IMO. Patty was thick but not juicy. Expected better!  *Updating after owner's response: I submitted my review too hastily that I forgot to mention my husband got the Signature Banh Mi and he loved it! Bread was softly toasted (not hard and crunchy where traditional Vietnamese do it), and he said the loaded meat portion and unique pickled taste was well done! Glad it came from a Vietnamese owner who knows how to do it correctly at an American place, and better than most Vietnamese places. I'm leaving it at 3 stars bc as vacationers and our first and only visit, it was average. Not bad, not great overall. I appreciate the Asian fusion with the American vibe and your reason for offering the fries/salad extra to avoid waste. We were there for a late dinner earlier this week. Too bad I expected a juicier burger. The caramelized onions saved it. Hope the team doesn't keep missing the mark!",

We sat at the bar and were greeted by the bartender. The service was okay. I felt like because we ordered regular cocktails  it wasn't the full on craft experience. We had trouble with some of the ingredients on the menu and the bartender helped us out but I felt like she was annoyed. No biggie we ordered our drinks Queen Bee, Daquiri and the C + E. The drinks were good. Really strong. There happy hour menu was pretty good. We ordered the spicy crab dip. The dip was a 10. Served with crackers and pita bread. Will definitely be coming back for the food!",

They have their beer list on chalkboard that hanging behind bar , and it's very hard for ppl like me without perfect vision to read , but I did found their online menu so overall was excellent place to hang out !",

They have a good selection of drinks and the food is delicious! My favorite thing on the menu is the fries with the buffalo chicken on top and their fried deviled eggs.   The service is usually pretty good. However the past few times that we have tried to go past 12am, they're already closed. One time, I called 10 mins before coming, to ask what time they were closing and they said 2 am. After arriving, I noticed the doors were locked. I called again and the same woman picked the phone up and said they just closed. 10 mins after speaking with her!!! Although it isn't a far drive, it is still pretty disappointing to show up and the place is closed. Maybe they should change their hours of operation on Yelp or something?",

Prices are not bad, not cheap, yet you get what you pay for. I'd rather pay more to eat well.   I came to eat by myself on a late Sunday night, and Tristan, the server was very welcoming! I ordered a water and hot water, mentioned how I was feeling it a little in my throat, and she brought back this magical mix of hot water, honey, lemon, mint and ginger syrup. It was delicious, almost like a hotty toddy, mint mojito drink for a sore throat. She read my mind! Tristian was also helpful with helping me decide what to eat and what to expect.   I got the house popcorn, which was furakaki that day, fried deviled eggs and house bhan mi. All was so good! It was a good portion, but since I was hungry, I finished it! Popcorn was perfectly flavored, not too strong or salty. Great to munch on. I've eaten  a lot of Bhan Mis, but this was one of the best! The baguette was warm, but not overly toasted, meat was tender and filling was flavorful. The fried deviled eggs was crispy, yet the yolk was smooth. I would definitely come back, bring friends and I highly Recommend this place!   Pros: Service  Tasty High quality food and drinks  Cool, hip, trendy, chill place  Clean resturant and bathroom  Cons: None",

I was a little bummed because I couldn't partake in drinking, they have a pretty good selection of crafted beers and cocktails. I will definitely be coming back for some sangria.   After observing the menu and getting feed back on the food, I decided I definitely wanted to try the Deep fried devil eggs and Vermicelli Noodle salad, they said the dressing would be worth it. Boy was he right Themis salad was so good, the dressing amplified the greens and I am a sucker for noodles.  I would definitely recommend the salad and the Deviled eggs was a good starter, it had a unique flavor and the textures was good, I even try dipping it In my dressing and it was soooooo good.  Another recommendation was the bread pudding of the day- so of course I had to jump in dessert, the current flavor was Reese Peanut Butter cup, and boy was it good, I loved the cream and sauce m, it was a perfect balance and it was moist and not soggy, so the texture and flavor was in point. I just wish I could finish it, but sadly it's meant to share. Overall, I enjoyed the food and the atmosphere. The staff super friendly and very knowledgeable, they will definitely give you some good recommendations. The quality of food is delicious and good, they definitely take pride on providing fresh and high quality ingredients.",

They don't do reservations but I gave a head notice cuz of how big my party was.   Not only was the manager Van accommodating, we loved our server. I don't remember her name. Sorry! She was really sweet and upbeat. I almost thought she was gonna cream me with my birthday cake. Lmao. But my friend had already done that -_-.  I got the Bahn Mi special. People said they don't toast this but it is toasted. It's just lightly toasted, it's not rock hard like Lee's sandwich. But a little extra toasty would give it the right texture. Flavor was good however my friends had a hard time because of how spicy it was.   I loved it because I'm always asking for extra jalapenos. But if you're not digging the spicy, I'd suggest asking for none. I had two in mine and it was pretty kicking.   I also ordered the poutine! It was so good! I haven't had it since I was in Vancouver. But it was just delicious! I honestly wanted to eat all of it but I was too full.   My friend got the crab dip that we shared. It was with imitation crab. I think this was my least favorite item.   I also had ordered a queen bee. It was so yummy I had to have two! I think all their drinks hit the spot with my group. And our server recommended some drinks to everyone!   Thank you for accommodating us and making our dining experience fun to the staff!",

There is a huge selection to choose from which can be daunting but also exciting to get something you've never had before.   The food was pretty average in terms of bar food.  I really liked that they try to make it funky and fun but I think the execution is off.   For example, the fried chicken skin and the crab dip were so salty that even my beer couldn't tame the salt but the cabbage salad was seriously lacking in flavor.   That item was close to being my favorite if it only had some seasoning or pizzazz.     I was surprised at the portion size of everything.  They were very large for the pricing in my opinion.   The service was ok too.   You seat yourself which is fun but it also means you wait a hot second for the server especially if it's busy.   Also I think there might have only been one server plus the bartender so we did have to wait for drink refills and the check.   However, I will say that our server was awesome when we did see her.",

The chicken sandwich had a sauce that was very unique. It tasted like the hot Nashville chicken from KFC! But better.  I didn't drink bc it being my lunch hour, but there seemed to be quite the selection of beers and drinks on the board. The wait was above average for the crowd that was in there but giving the quality of the food I'm okay with that. Can't wait to come back and try some of the other things on the menu as the other burgers that they had listed looked pretty intriguing as well.",

I came here for lunch and it was also happy hour.   I ordered the \"bad ass\" poutine which is spicy chili, smoked bacon, cheese, and beer on top of crispy fries. It is definitely spicy, but nothing I couldn't handle.   The Vietnamese spring roll is a classic and I love how they made it. Fresh ingredients.  They have an array of beer, and they even let you test a few! I ordered quite a few, I cant remember which ones. So, I guess you'd have to stop in to try! I met Van, the owner, when he served me one of my beers. He is a great guy. Can't wait to go back again!",

We decided to go for a drink and bite to eat on a Friday around 7 pm. The place was PACKED, but luckily we were able to snag two bar seats in the corner.  The service was a little spotty. It took a while to place our drink order and get menus, but I'm assuming it's because they're new and not entirely organized. Food wise I had the Signature Banh Mi which was amazing. The flavors and spices were very well balanced and everything tasted very fresh. I also really enjoyed the cocktail I had which they said they'd be adding soon to their permanent cocktail menu.   I'm excited to see what the future holds for this place and will certainly be back again for more.",

    "text": "595 is definitely a gastropub- the dark, industrial redesign of the former Elements space is highlighted by a menu focusing on brews, burgers, and shareable apps. Visited with some of my favorite dudes and tried a handful of stuff on the menu. Overall consensus was that the slow-cooked pork belly is a standout but most other dishes were on the salty side- maybe this effect is lessened when there is more drinking involved.  The beer cheese app (featuring pretzel rolls from Great Buns bakery) was accented with flaked sea salt that it really didn't need. The roux-based sauce was decently smooth though. The classic poutine arrived to the table slightly cold and with an egg verging on over-hard rather than runny, but the portion size was large and the fries are made from fresh-cut potatoes which always makes them tastier. Needed more cheese curds! The sandwiches seemed to fare a bit better, with the pork belly bahn mi being thick and savory while the fried chicken sandwich (warned as being spicy) was also notably salty. Opting for a side salad over the fries might be a better option if sodium intake is an issue.  Though I don't drink, I'm told the beer list is pretty interesting. There's seating at four-tops, high-tops, and the bar, as well as a small (currently unused) patio space. So far, no word on a happy hour or any brunch offerings, but those will likely come in time. I'm open to a revisit to try a couple of other dishes; the burrata app, bundino dessert, and brisket bahn mi all sound good on paper but I'll give them a bit more time to get the kitchen flowing better.",

The spring rolls (thanks pretty Irish bartender/server lady for double checking  these are the fresh spring rolls we wanted as opposed to fried egg roll-type rolls) came with a tasty non-traditional peanut sauce. Dessert was bread pudding - an apple and candied walnut caramel saucy delight. Everything was on point and the service was warm and friendly.  We will come back for more beer and to try the garbage nachos, burgers and the loco moco poutine!",

There were some beers on the menu that I had never heard of or tried before, and some local favorites that weren't the typical ones you see at every bar. Whoever is the buyer is doing a great job.   If I had gone there just for food it would have been a four star review only because nothing was that impressive... almost like they were trying too hard to be crafty? Not sure can't put my finger on it, because nothing was bad... But nothing was really that good.

The beer selection is nice.  My friend had one of their specialty drinks and she wasn't crazy for it.. We had the hummus which came with super hard pita chips... suggestion, maybe something softer like pita bread..? Otherwise hummus itself was tasty.  The chicken wings were dry and over cooked. Didn't care much for the sauces.  The \"crispy\" chicken skins were ok. They weren't too crispy and a bit soggy. Maybe just not fried long enough.  My friend asked for no tomatoes in her $9 salad. Tons of tomatoes in it! Good thing she wasn't allergic but did end up getting real sick. The deep fried deviled eggs were just ok. One piece was enough for me... The Bahn mi slider, or whatever it's called was not good. Hardly no taste and mostly just bread. Waste.  Overall, we were not satisfied with the food. Service was great! Beer was yummy.  Small and cozy place. They just need to improve their food.  Oh and those sheets the food comes on....really? 2 eggs on something that big? We hardly had any room on our tables for everything because of all those metal sheets. Cute but not necessary. Focus more on the taste of the food rather than the presentation please:)",

As a bit of a beer geek I am really excited to have a local place with a interesting beer list. The staff was cool, Laid back, and attentive. We really didn't have to ask for anything. I will be going back ........... often!!",

Very flavorful, fresh and they were very generous with the marinated pork! This was yummy! A must try.  The Craft Burger with bacon: the bun was just the right texture! Meat cooked to a medium perfection with just the right toppings!   We ordered 2 orders of the fries, I would recommend ordering one to share. It was big enough for two people. That would be my only suggestion, the server should have informed us of the portion size.   They have a full bar with a variety of craft beers on tap, I'm not a drinker but I'm sure it would be a beer lovers paradise!",

    "text": "So my husband and I decided to check this place out last night for a quick bite to eat before going to a show. If my rating could only reflect the service, i would give it 5 stars. We sat at the bar and were greeted immediately. Shortly after, we ordered our drinks and food, and were impressed  at how quickly  everything  arrived despite  how extremely busy the restaurant was. Prior to arriving we looked at the reviews  and pictures  on yelp. And I have to say that the presentation  was just as perfect as the photos. But here's the problem ....... this is where our satisfaction ended .   Although everything  we ordered was prepared perfectly,  2 out of the 3 dishes were lacking flavor.  We had the chicken sandwich,  crab dip,  and bad ass fries. The chili on the fries was extremely  bland. The chicken sandwich was a decent size, and it was so moist  it could melt in your mouth, but it lacked seasoning. The crab dip however, was phenomenal.   Due to the great prices, wonderful service, and quality of food, i would still give it another shot. The chef could have just had a bad night. Overall, a good experience.",

One thing I loved was learning how 595 got its name, as well as some of the local Vegas history with the old race track. This is one of those spots where I don't want anyone to go because I want it all to myself.",

They came in a semi-transparent wrapper that felt and tasted like some combination between plastic and rubber. There wasn't much flavor to them at all. If you eating at the same time as others in your party, then this isn't the place for you. They brought out our meals at different times. Not sure why they do that here. Had the loco moko for an entree and it came with a fried egg and beef patty on top of gravy-covered French fries. It was pretty bland as well. They don't have any mainstream beers on tap. The closest thing to bud light I got tasted more like Dos Equis. I'm not sure why gastropubs serve small portion sizes of food in Vegas, but that was, again, the case here. The burgers don't come with fries! You have to add the fries for 3 bucks more. The service was the lone bright spot. They were friendly. If you're hungry for loko moko, better try Born and Raised instead. If you're really hungry, go eat something somewhere else before coming here.",

I have eaten banh-mi sandwiches all over Las Vegas and this one really stands out, just the right amount of heat.  Great selection of beer. Van brought 2 samples and we ordered a Sierra Nevada. I appreciated the friendly staff, maybe the owner, who checked to see if everything was OK. They will be opening a patio soon. The decor was interesting with a variety of lights and paneling. Important to me was a very clean bathroom.  They need more eye level exterior signage because they are in a strip mall with several other restaurants and their sign is really high up.",

I highly recommend it. The fried deviled eggs were pretty good, but I've had better before. The pork belly Banh mi was very good and very spicy. We also got a burrata chutney that was good, but where we sat by the window it got cold quickly. So we ate about half of it, then it then it wasn't very melty anymore. Over all the food is good, cocktails were amazing, and service was a little slow but a good experience over all and would come back on a weekday.",

I'm kind of new to las Vegas and came to the unfortunate conclusion that the craft beer scene here is horrible. 595 craft and brewery is a hoppy oasis in the barren desert of las Vegas. Not the biggest selection but it's beers you actually WANT to drink. Well done 595. Well done.",

The deep fried eggs were 4 pieces which amounted to 2 eggs total. All that came with it were some chopped up chives on the tray. This was $9. The tuna sandwich was tuna steak on a roll with some garlic aioli and some greens and this was $14. All sides were extra. Are you kidding me?",

    "text": "Stopped by this place before heading into the strip because my friend was raving about it! And boy, it did not disappoint. I had the Pork Belly burger and it was by far the most amazing burger I've ever had. It was so moist and juicy and the flavors were on point. The customer service was great as well. The beers on tap were really good too! When you order drinks at the bar, the bartop has a built in apparatus (not sure what it's called ) to keep your drinks nice and cold. Genius! Perfect for the sweltering heat in Vegas. This will definitely be my watering hole every time I go to Vegas!",

I got to try their Signature Banh Mi, Pork Belly burger, french fries and that Dynamite Crab Dip (Spicy!).  Everything were really good.  That pork belly burger was to die for though!  It's too bad I don't live in the area or I will be stopping by here often just for that burger.  I will definitely stop here whenever I am in Vegas.  You guys should really give them a try if you haven't yet.  You won't be disappointed.  Thanks Van!!!",

I wish they had a couple straight up vegan options I don't have to modify when I order, but they get an extra point for playing the new Tribe Called Quest album in its entirety. Can't wait to get back to this place.",

    "text": "Went here on a Saturday night around 11pm. I liked the space, small but nice. Seemed like a cool little neighborhood bar.  Unfortunately the food and service left something to be desired... I tried to order a specialty cocktail from their menu, however it was unavailable. Then I tried to order a bacaradi and coke - no Bacardi so I had to settle on house rum. Then I tried to order pretzels and beer cheese - no pretzels.  The server offered to serve the beer cheese with pita, which I accepted. I also ordered the classic poutine. When my drink came out it was without a straw, as they were even out of straws!! What kind of bar runs out of straws?? Very strange, especially since there is a Smiths right across the street. The food took a long time to come out, about 20 minutes from the time I ordered and it was disappointing to say the least.... everything was cold and just not good. The beer cheese was too thick and bland. The poutine was just ok - the gravy was good but the fries were cold and soggy and the cheese curds were almost non existent.  Overall left feeling disappointed.",

    "text": "Came back for a 3rd time and ordered the chili cheese burger for a 2nd time. One thing I noticed is that the fries were better than the 1st time. The first time they tasted plain or too salty if anything. Today they had a little pepper flavor to it. I enjoyed my chili cheeseburger AGAIN and I added bacon this time I also got more into the craft beer this go/round since I've been trying to step my craft beer game up. I tried the green flash IPA and I'm not an IPA guy. It was solid. I ordered a heffawizen and an orange blood kolsch. All of the beers were good. What's cool is if you are into craft beer is that they continuously switch up their beer menu. The bartenders and other servers were very attentive . I noticed they had a power outlet up front at the bar which was a plus for me since my phone is always dead lol .  The 1st time I came by they didn't have wifi . This time they did. For a craft beer/west coast comfort food spot this  place seems to be on the up & up to me.",
