It is right next to the canal so you can wave at the gondolas going by.   I agree with the other guy. The food was solid.  We ordered the carne asada tacos which came with 3 tacos and a side of rice and beans. It was good, but we weren't raving over it. THE POSOLE THOUGH. It was my first time having Posole (I was surprised it was green) and it was really tasty. My friend knows her food and she loved it as well. We kept wanting to go back for more Posole, but didn't have the chance to.",

Crab salad I'm told was good, but the other 2 dishes were very bland and the meat was incredibly tough. Considered reordering but frankly  don't have tone for that noise.  I just stopped eating in favor of getting something elsewhere.  Seriously.  $23 for fajitas? Better be some good damn fajitas. Get it right the first time. Oh and check arrived before everyone was done eating. Second star is for the drinks and salad, and the server wasn't quite as apathetic as the others I saw there.

The place is sooo pretty. Drinks were sooooo good. But the food was terrible. i had the Pollo con Mole Poblano, i sent it back, it was waaay over cooked, it was soooo dry, the rice was ok but i couldnt eat the chicken at all. zero flavor, i didnt even bother ordering anything else, my fiance had the Shrimp Burrito, it was soooo good, we just shared his meal. My best friend had the Fajitas Tejanas, the chicken was dried, the meat was tough and over cooked and she had waaay more veggies then anything else. The bride and her mother had the Shrimp & Mussels Moqueca, they did not like it, i was told it was not good but we were all hungry so we ate. Oh i did have the Manchego Spinach Salad - Baby spinach, sliced Spanish Manchego cheese, smoked bacon, shredded green apples, chipotle-bacon vinaigrette. that salad was amazing. only thing that was good for me was the salad.",

If you have ever ate flautas, you know that they are fried which makes them crunchy on the outside with different filings on the inside-almost like a taquito. Anyway, the faults here are perfectly fried with not too much crunch-it doesn't hurt the rook of you mouth when you bite into it AND the filling inside with the different dipping sauces are amazing.  The food is very reasonably priced for Vegas and being in the Canal Shops.  Our server was very nice and attentive.  Lastly, the BEST part about this restaurant is the location. Should you decide to try this yummy establishment, be sure to request a table alongside the actual canal where they are performing the gondola rides. Huge plus is you get to hear the gondola singers while you enjoy your mexican food.   Great experience and so fun!",

    "text": "I stopped by this restaurant to grab a few drinks after a long day at work. This restaurant is conveniently located close to the entrance of the Grand Canal Shoppes in The Venetian Resort. The restaurant is unique with it being one of only a few restaurants that offer seating along and prime views of the Grand Canal inside the resort. We decided to sit at the bar. I was addressed by the bartender in a way that I did not appreciate and was not politically correct for lack of better words. The comment was based on my appearance. Even after standard business practices like checking a guest's ID to verify qualifications about someone like age, the bartender continued to address me in a way that was obviously not accurate. I was very embarrassed by this as I was put in a very awkward and uncomfortable position of deciding whether or not to address it or ignore it. I was embarrassed as the company I was with definitely noticed and heard the comments. I felt that the intention to incorrectly address me was not malicious but it was definitely ignorant and pretty much ruined my experience here. It's unfortunate because the cocktails were decent. Rare and impactful guest issues like this unfortunately leave little opportunity for guest recovery and needless to say I will not be returning nor recommending this restaurant to anyone in the future.",

We weren't sure if we wanted to sit and eat so they brought us menus to look over while we watched the chef make corn tortillas by hand. The manager saw us staring at the chef and brought us two fresh hot tortillas to have. That sold us! They were so delicious and the people were so nice we decided to sit down.   They have a great happy hour! $5 drinks! We got two each of the RumChata and the PassionFuit Margarita. Both delicious drinks!! You have to like Horchata to like the Rumchata.   The food was delicious!!    The Barbacoa was melt in your mouth amazing with the sauces and the tender pork! Oh I dream about that dish! It also came with the house made tortillas, which we were in love with! Which was paired perfectly with the Spinach and Manchengo salad. Loved every bite!   It is located right on the end of the canal towards one end of the shops. You are away from the public but get a great serenade by the gondoliers every time one of them float by.  The space is large and has patio-esque seating. (Where you think you are outside but aren't really.)   I would love to go back here! Kudos to the staff and the servers! All amazing!",

    "text": "My Uncle and Cousin were in town for a trade-show, and I met up with them to give a quick tour and grab some late lunch before their flight back to California.  I was going to take them to Bouchon, but only the Oyster Bar was opened at that time of the day.  Anyway, I enjoyed the appetizer we ordered: Queso Fundido - their exclusive blend of cheeses, manchego, asadero, monterrey jack & cilantro, melted in a cazuela (cast iron dish) & served w/ fresh hand made flour tortillas.  The cheese blend was alright (not great and not terrible) but the homemade flour tortillas were really good (which was almost like a fresh out of the oven pita bread-ish thin puck of yumminess).  I also ordered their \"Santa Rosa Barbacoa de Puerco\" - Marinated pork slowly roasted in a banana leaf, served with cilantro rice, black beans & a chipotle barbecue sauce.   The pork was definitely very tender and went well with the chipotle sauce. The combination of the beans, pork, sauce and cilantro rice in one bite was superb.   Only thing that can make this better is the plate presentation, because it looks like the presentation style of your average Mexican fare (from taco trucks to mom & pop diners).  Would I order this again? Yes.  What didn't impressed me was the dessert that my cousin ordered, which was the \"Corn Creme Brulee\" - sweet corn custard with seasonal fruits. It was your average creme brulee that pretty much any pastry arts student can prepare after taking a Baking class in any of the local culinary programs.  And the \"seasonal fruits\" is one single solitary raspberry covered up by a sprig of mint. (A+ for driving down your food cost on this item)  In summary, the food we ordered for the most part were tasty (of course I didn't tried their tacos, which seems to have a few negative reviews), the service we received was good, plate presentation is definitely not going to win any medals or awards, perceived value for the meal and experience is average.  Would I come back for more?  Yes. But I will for sure skip their dessert offerings and head over to Bouchon Bakery.",

When we asked for a specific table with a good view she made it seems like it was such an issue. Not what I want to be greeted with. Then our food was slow to come out even though we just ordered the fish tacos and a shrimp cocktail. The tortillas were flavorless and basically fell apart in my hands. The fish was Talapia which I should have known not to order since it's the cheapest fish a resturant could buy. Lastly, this place claims it's \"Mexican soul food\" which makes no sense. By definition soul food is traditional African American cuisine so what the heck? I really would only recommend for drinks with a good view of the canal.",

Definitely a great place to have lunch or dinner and a fun time either alone or with friends. They have happy hour from 3-6 and 9pm-close very convenient!",

    "text": "Let me start by saying that I don't really care for the Venetian Grand Canal Shoppes.  When I'm in Las Vegas I don't care to spend time wandering around a mall, especially one so big that I've gotten lost more than once (sad but True).  There's only one thing that keeps me visiting the Grand Canal Shoppes, and that's Taqueria Canonita.  This is one of my favorite restaurants in Las Vegas, so I seek them out whenever I can.  I've never had a bad dish on the menu, though my favorite is the Tres Tacos.   Served with black beans and cilantro rice, you just cannot go wrong with any of their taco varieties.  I can't even pick a favorite, they are all good.    Taqueria Canonita also makes some tasty, tasty margaritas.   For Cinco de Mayo they had a special margarita that involved Serrano peppers that was amazing.  If there isn't a good special going on, The Canonita Margarita, made with Patron, is also a favorite.  You just cannot go wrong with Patron!  Just watch out because those suckers will sneak up on you!  Whether you sit on the \"patio\" along the canal or in the bar, this place is always fun.  The one and only reason they don't get 5 stars is because the restroom is located outside the restaurant in the Grand Canal Shoppes food court, which after a few shots of Patron is not exactly ideal.  Still, I'll let it slide and I look forward to visiting them again next time I'm in Las Vegas!",

Seriously, I can't say enough good things about Canonita, from the quality of the food, to the service, to the atmosphere.  Get a table near the grand canal, sip a margarita with some chips and salsa, relax and enjoy.  The flautas were perfectly executed, tasty, crispy outside, flavorful chicken inside.  The Sonora Filet Mignon was melt-in-your mouth tender, with a divine sauce, and the tamale was excellent (and I don't usually even like tamales.)  Just writing this review and remembering how good it was, I'm drooling.  The prices are on the high side, but worth it, in my opinion.  If I had money to burn, I'd fly from NY to Vegas just to go here for dinner.  Sorry if this sounds over the top, but I'm serious, Canonita is Mexican soul food at its best!",

    "text": "At the end of 2009's \"SBC Goes to Vegas\" epic comedy/tragedy, JMC, Cobber, and I spent one last day in Vegas, the start of which JMC led us to this spot overlooking the Venetian Canal. We imbibed carafe after carafe of a delicious sangria. I took note.  This year, at the end of a traditional/annual BFF/coworker trip, Sarah E, Sarah M, KarKar, and I spent an extra day in Vegas, the start of which led us to this same spot for lunch, touting it's sangria. It did not disappoint my hazy recollection.  We were quickly seated by the hostess, the restaurant/\"patio\" on the waterfront being sparsely occupied on a Tuesday afternoon. Julio, our server - an elder but spirited gentleman - came over with menus, introduced himself, and immediately prompted us for drinks to start... \"A pitcher of sangria, please?\" \"Excellente. Four glasses? \"Yes, please. Thank you.\"  With drinks on their way and requisite chips & salsa on the table, lunch/sustenance was in order. Both Sarahs ordered the Tres Tacos plates while KarKar went with lighter fare, having a bowl of the Corn & Green Chile Soup. I ordered the smoked chicken quesadilla, thinking it would be like... um, one big quesadilla, but they (3) were [pleasantly] more akin to grill flattened/pressed tacos.  The Corn & Green Chile soup was flavorful! A bit of sweet from the corn, heat from the green chile, a hearty fullness of potato, and depth/salt from smoked bacon.  The taco combination platters and the smoked chicken quesadilla plate satisfying and freshly flavored. Each taco was dressed with toppings complimentary to their filling - shredded chicken salpicon, mushrooms with queso blanco/fresco, and [grilled] fish with a pineapple salsa. The three palm-sized smoked chicken quesadillas are heavy with chicken and cheese. Both platters come garnished with a sharp and tangy serano slaw, black beans, and fresh flavorful cilantro rice.  Back to what brought us here... the Sangria.  Now its hard to tell (especially in Vegas) just how good/effective a sangria can be. It's *meant* to creep, right? (JM, Cobes, and I went 2-3 carafes not realizing the fade!) But I must say, the sangria here is good. Not too tart, not too sweet. Retains the silken feel of red wine and the warm flush of brandy is subtle. It's a slow ride into troubled waters. What a perfect way to ease into the crazy. Gimme more!  Safe to say, for casual dining, good people watching, and a creeper of a drink, I'd gladly add Canonita to the yearly tradition. _________________________________________________ No, really. I have a note to myself on my phone from last year...  \"Must do Sangria again!\" I don't remember writing it.",

The margaritas were a little small for what you pay for. The server recommended the salmon and I didn't think a Mexican restaurant could do a great job of creating the best salmon entree but I was wrong. The salmon was delicious and it wasn't dry or overcooked!! Everything on the plate was tasty including the rice. The portion was so large I could not even eat 1/3 of the meal. I packed it up and ate the rest the next day.  I highly recommend this restaurant and the salmon entree!!",

We ordered a pineapple margarita as well as a jalapeno margarita. Then to top the night off, our server, Jonathan, remembered my bday was this weekend and totally surprised me with a celebratory tres leches cake!! I will definitely dine here again the next time I'm in Las Vegas!",

First glance at the menu, I was taken aback at how the prices were not your average over priced costs as is usual per Las Vegas. The array of drinks to choose from was also quite a treat. My friends and I ordered margaritas and a few appetizers. The chicken flautas were just amazing. Had all the right toppings and the guacamole was so flavorful. Next up, the queso fundido with the fresh tortillas was melt in your mouth good. I thoroughly enjoyed my experience at this fine establishment. Next time I'm in Las Vegas, I will be back!",

I feel there is much flavor in the pork  as well as the shrimp broth with mussels.  For those who fear cheese there really isn't a lot of cheese in this type of food. The flan dessert was a disappointment as it was not very smooth but it was the  coffee n vanilla bean specks  within the flan that was wonderful. Unfortunately, talking about coffee, we just purchased a cup of coffee and were requested to toss it or drink it up before entering the restaurant. I felt that was quite a waste of money but being in Vegas nothing is about money right.   The service was good the lady was pretty new so we got a pretty attentive but very nervous waitress. The annoying thing to me was watching and hearing the gondola rides (the singing) through my meal although I could be biased since I go to Vegas so often that is the food that will ultimately  impressed me and not the tourist attractions.   Price for two which included the tuna ceviche, flan,  and two entrees was close to $100.  Better than playing slots. At least u get to taste some goodness.",

The chicken was burnt to a crisp, to the point that you literally could not even bite into the meat. And the chefs know as the burnt side was put down. The meat you could eat (had to surgically get to it), was dry and flavorless.  On top of that, the veggies had no flavor and the chicken portion was just tiny. If this weren't a business dinner on a compressed timeline, I would have sent it back.   Besides the awful fajitas, service was spotty with drinks forgotten, the waitress never came to check how everything was going and other service mistakes that should not happen at a restaurant with these pricepoints.   Beyond disappointed. Don't make the same mistake my party did, go somewhere else. Trust me, you will thank me later.",

The location of the restaurant is also very nice as it's next to the canal so you could pretend that you're in Venice. Some tables even have umbrellas shading the customers from the fake blue sky to give it that extra appeal.   I felt like the menu contained a good variety for breakfast. There were pancakes, steak and eggs, and the traditional eggs, bacon, and potatoes. But there were also traditional Mexican staples as well. I got an order of the Huevos Rancheros ($13). The rest of the party got the Canonita BLT ($10), which came with eggs, poblano peppers, bacon, black beans, lettuce, tomato, guacamole, chiptole aoili, and Texas toast; the Steak and Eggs ($20); and the Canonita Omelette ($12), which came with Monterey Jack, peppers, poblano chiles, and red onions.   The huevos rancheros were alright but nothing special. My food did not seem to be hot when it came to me. It made the tortilla a bit more difficult to eat because it hardened more. Perhaps it was sitting at the window for a little bit longer, as the waiter for all the entrees to come out? Also, the waiter did not ask for preference when it came to the steak and eggs. The steak was a little more well done than liked.  Overall, service was slow. We were one of four other parties there for breakfast and we got there at 9, a good hour after they have opened. Our waiter was not very attentive and seemed to be out of sight most of the time. Took us a while to get the check as well. The food was decent but nothing super spectacular. I've had better. This place is worth it for the view and it's convenient location though! Perhaps, their lunch and dinner menu is better.",

Try to get a table by the canals so you can see the gondolas with gondoliers serenading guests as they go by the restaurant. Very beautiful ambiance. Service was quick and friendly.  The chips and salsa and guacamole (guac is an additional extra cost) is a must try as a sharable appetizer! Very flavorful and chips tasted fresh and not stale.  I came here for a weekday lunch. Ordered the chicken enchiladas combination plate. It came with 3 enchiladas (choice of green or red sauce) and cilantro lime rice and black beans. I opted for all rice. BIG PORTIONS!!!! If you're not that hungry or got a small appetite, it's best to share dishes with your party. My co-worker got her usual favorite chicken mole entree with beans and rice.   I think this is a great option from your other many wonderful restaurant choices the Venetian/Palazzo has to offer. I'm glad they have a Mexican restaurant here since there's so many steakhouses and Italian places, it's a good alternative if you're not a fan or craving the more common restaurants. Try to make a reservation here as it does get busy...especially on holidays, weekends or when there's a big convention in town.  I've always wanted to try Canonita and I'm glad I did. The food did not disappoint at all.",

However, they had a great happy hour with four dollar and five dollar drinks between 4 and 7 PM and the food was excellent. The service was a little bit slow but that does not take away from the fact that when they were around, they were very attentive and nice. So I did not deduct any stars for that. That Miss fear is beautiful and be sure to ask for a table on the canal where the gondolas swing by. The view is breathtakingly amazing. I would definitely recommend and return on my next trip to Vegas.",

The tortilla's for the fajita's were a very thick breadlike consistency and they were not very nice at all. It felt like you were eating in a food court rather than a restaurant. My husband had a steak and it wasn't great.The prices were expensive as it lacked atmosphere. Back to the waiter...he was rude when we tried to  pay the bill. All in all, there are many more lovely places to eat in Vegas than this place. I wouldn't go again.",

I'll admit, I'm weary of some restaurants on the strip, particularly Mexican as it has always turned out to be a disappointing experience for me (i.e., Gardunos at the Palms, Isla at TI, Yolos at Planet Hollywood).  I was pleasantly surprised to find a nice Happy Hour at this place (<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.venetian.com%2FuploadedImages%2FThe_Venetian%2FContent_Blocks%2FRestaurants%2FCasual_Dining%2F2011CANHappyHourPromoeBlast.jpg%23zoom%3D100&s=762eae171d02dbd7a88d541088b5df24087f133ffda45bd2cadeb65750d3253b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">venetian.com/uploadedIma...</a>).  $3 well drinks and $5 classic and specialty margaritas from 3pm to 6pm and 9pm to closing.  We had the $5 prickly pear margaritas, which were actually pretty good as well as chips and guacamole.  The guac was nothing to write home about but was decent.  However, the drinks -- and HH prices -- were excellent, particularly because it doesn't seem like many strip joints offer decent happy hour options.  The restaurant is also along the fake Grand Canal, so the singing gondoliers are fun entertainment.",

She then passed again all laughing with a table I called her asking to get my server I sat there seeing my server in the front with the girls. I ordered steak it was bad wasn't cooked all the way, my husband got salmon his was good. I didn't enjoy the service or the food. My husband though because was at the strip we get a good experience for are 10 year anniversary. From the time they sat us to end was bad we didnt even get a have a good day when we left.

My brother was served his shrimp burrito with shrimp tails still on the little guys, which made for a crunchy(not to mention inconvenient) experience. Cost is reasonable......for Vegas.  The cocktails were very good, the classic margarita and the michelada were ordered several times at our table with no complaints. NOTE: they do a happy hour until 7pm on most nights, but only at the bar!! The happy hour price is nearly 50% off on the margaritas, if your looking to save a buck. If your not eating dinner, they serve drinks in TO-GO cups even at happy hour prices.....very nice!  The best thing about this place is the location inside the Venetian, if you get a table on the \"patio\"(which means its not the bar area, hence not included in happy hour) you can sit right next to the water for the Gondola rides and listen to them sing(and watch the couples awkwardly stare at each other.... whilst taking their romantic trip in a circle..... through a hotel made to look like Venice, Italy) . It makes for a bit of a romantic dinner if your into that sort of thing, or at the very least some awesome people watching(im a fan).   BOTTOM LINE: have a cocktail before seven, share an entree or the guaco and chips, sit back/relax and have a gander(or a laugh) over the lovely Gondoliers and their customers.",

It had been about 2-3 years since I had been to vegas (moved to Macau) I visited last night and I cant explain how disappointed I was in the quality and taste of food now compared to before.   Flying in from Macau, I thought the first place I will stop at seeing how my hotel is in the Venetian will be Canonita, I had been craving the Chili Relleno for years. Our server asked if we had been here before we said yes. We placed our orders, got a taco platter for appetizer, margaritas, chille relleno, and the barbacoa. The barbacoa and margaritas were pretty much the same, but the taco platter was changed for the worse. And the relleno was just plain disgusting now. It went from being their best dish in my opinion to the worst. I'm really not sure what happened to this place, it looks a lot more corporate now and just was lacking these authentic flavors that it possessed in previous years.   The quality has gone down a lot and we dont know if thats because there is some new chefs or if the chefs just stopped trying. The taco platter took off at least one taco from the previous years and replaced it with \"carnitas.\" The carnitas tasted like plastic and had the texture of it as well. I took one bite and its obvious they load it with that salsa on top to give it all the flavor because the meat was lacking taste.   Overall im giving it a 2 star rating now because the margaritas were fine (hard to mess up a margarita) and the barbacoa for keeping the same recipe. But honestly, we wont be dining here again until they bring back the delicious relleno with nuts and fruits inside. I cant be the only one who thinks this new rendition is disgusting. There is way better choices when it comes to Mexican food in Vegas.",

The principle and his wife took my friend and myself out to dinner here our first night in Vegas.   From the outside it looks like your standard mexican food type of place. However, there is something about sitting by the canal  that really transformed the experience for me. I didn't feel like I was eating at a chain place or even a run of the mill hotel restaurant.   I had the slow cooked pork wrapped in a banana leaf. This was my first time ordering pork ever - and it was delicious. The portions were generous, and the cilantro lime rice was perfect.

I mean, when you have something as special and romantic as a Venice canal with gondolas passing by every 15mnts and gondoliers serenading their guests, why wouldn't you take full advantage of it!!   The place itself was very vegetarian-friendly, albeit relied heavily on mushrooms (which I'm allergic to). The only downside of this place was that they were unwilling to do any substitutions at all, which means for a mushroom-allergic person such as myself, there weren't really that many vegetarian options left. We tried the guac-chips and fondido as well as sides of beans and cilantro rice.",

It took an hour to get our main courses and 20 minutes to get our drinks. Our water was not refilled with a whole table with empty glasses. When we asked for hot sauce, it was not brought. When we went to the waiter to get it, the waiter said \"he forgot\". They ran out of the dinner we wanted (salmon) and didn't have a dessert that was advertised. Both of those menus items were not told to us until after we ordered.",

The food was good but not very imaginative.  The pricing is a bit high for what you get. It was $24 for the beef enchiladas which were just OK.    There are so many stellar choices at Venetian/Palazzo, I would rather spend my money elsewhere.",

    "text": "This is woefully overdue. I had thought I'd saved the updated review months ago. I'm embarrassed to discover now that it never posted. My apologies.  ___________________________  Where to begin? How about the service? As mentioned before, it was the service on follow-up that convinced me to come back to Canonita and give them another chance. And it's generally more about the service than anything else when I consider how I feel about my experience at a restaurant.   Rarely if ever have I been so pleased to be turned around on my opinion of a restaurant.  To say that Alejandro and his staff treated my guests and me like treasured friends would be an understatement. Now I know full well that they were looking to make up for a previous poor experience but I was watching the scene throughout the restaurant and, well, it wasn't just us. The staff was attentive and welcoming to everybody, and I could see lots of smiles and hear lots of laughter throughout the restaurant. This was what had been lacking the first time. Yes, the food was a major FAIL then, but it was the service that caused much of the problem. And it was the follow-up by Alejandro that had started to turn me around. This was five star, white glove service. Perfection.  As for the food, it was nothing short of spectacular. I can be a bit of a food snob at times. Okay, maybe more than a bit. But my daughter still talks about her fish from that night. High praise from a picky pescatarian about the fish she essentially HAD to order because there weren't exactly a lot of choices available to her. It made her old man smile from ear to ear. Her attitude went from \"do we really have to go back there?\" to \"when can we go back there again?\" I tasted it. It melted like butter in my mouth. My steak was heavenly but her fish was truly incredible. I wanted to steal it from her. All of the dishes were brilliantly prepared and beautifully presented. Everything about our meal was close to perfect - the atmosphere, the service, the food, the drinks. I even enjoyed the desserts - and I'm not really a huge desserts guy.    Alejandro, thank you. You and your staff have restored my faith and we WILL be back.    ______________________  Okay, so that's what has been unwittingly stuck as a draft since the end of November.   And if you want to know if we're still thinking about that meal, well.... My birthday's coming up and my kids asked to go back to Vegas to celebrate. (In the summer. Yeah, I know!) My daughter was quick to insist that we go to Canonita for my birthday dinner. She still talks about that fish seven months later. My son suggested Canonita too, and he wasn't even with us in November. He's been listening to his sister rave about her meal for months. As for me, well, who am I to argue? Canonita it is. I think maybe I'll order the fish....",

I ordered the Garden Egg White Omelette (with spinach, mushroom, and cheese only), Yogurt and Granola (served with Mexican wedding cookies), and Watermelon Agua Fresca.  Personally, I didn't care for my food - it was all bland to me and I've had better elsewhere.  My dining companion liked her food though (Huevos BLT), so maybe I just didn't order the right thing.  I love watermelon so I liked my drink and found it to be pretty refreshing.  Service was decent, and our food was brought out pretty fast.  It was neat sitting by the water and seeing gondolas go by, so I found the ambiance to be nice.  If the food were any tastier, I'd give Canonita a four, but since it wasn't, three stars it is based on my experience.",

So the truck is like a to go type window but it was a \"truck\" off to the back side and we had them add habanero salsa to the top for flavor and they were great.  Better than food court food and then we found all our friends sitting int the actual restaurant so had some of their chips and salsa and guacamole and more food. Yummy for mall Mexican food. And the jalapenos  margaritas were delicious too! Chips were crispy and the salad was a smoked something flavor and yummy! Good stuff",

The chips and salsa, tacos and quesadillas were all delicious though so that made up for the mediocre service. It was cool to be in the Canal Shops though.

During our stay at the Venetian, we came here several times. It's conveniently located near all the shops, singing gondoliers, and close to the casino. The reason I give them three stars, however, is because of the consistently slow service, despite how busy or slow it was, or time of day. At each visit, and with all different servers each time, it always took a long time to be greeted at our table, brought water, food, or drinks.   Otherwise, it's worth a shot. I would come back.",

This restaurant is contained within the Venetian Hotel in Las Vegas, directly aligned with their Grand Canal, with gondolas floating by, gondoliers singing, a ceiling painted with sky and clouds, False building fronts as if you are outside in Venice,.... After flying into Vegas, this was a heavenly place to drop in, get a bite to eat, before driving to a hotel to prepare for a several day conference.  There used to be a different restaurant with an \"outdoor patio\" near the canal and gondolas, but they seem to have shifted things, so I chose this restaurant based upon it's location.    They had a nice selection on their menu.  I ordered the Ahi tuna medallions with polenta cakes, and a Sangria swirl type of drink.  I did not want to leave.  It looked like they also had a good menu for breakfast, but I was not staying near enough to come back.    Vegas is a hectic place.  If you want a little bit of peace and tranquility, this is an excellent choice to unwind and have a bite to eat or drink!",

Pros: Food is actually not terrible, location, portion size Cons: price, authenticity.  Food: I had the chicken burrito ($18) and it was surprisingly good if I forgot that I was eating Mexican food. The burrito was smothered in what tasted like bbq sauce (what??) and filled with shredded chicken, beans, fajita veggies, cheese, etc. The cilantro rice and black beans on the side were actually better than the burrito.   Atmosphere: Probably why people come. They have a patio on the Venetian \"canal\" so you can watch gondoliers go by while you eat.   Value: Vegas is expensive, but $18 for a burrito??? At least this has extra large portions. Would be easy to split in two and save some for later.   Service: Very amenable!",

We decided to try Canonita and were happy with our experience. We got a cheese appetizer that came with tortillas which was really good and decided to split a meal since we were going to go get a milkshake after. we got the enchiladas with green sauce. the enchiladas came with rice and beans. and The enchiladas were good but the RICE was amazing! it was cilantro rice and I could have just eaten a meal filled with that.",

The tomatillo sauce served with was very sweet like they added quite a bit of sugar. And no zip, no spice, no lime flavor. Just a very bland meal. The waiter was very nice.

It is conveniently located along the Venetian Canal.  I love having my meal at the tables along the water and watching the people on their Gondola rides.  It's an excellent spot to listen to them sing their beautiful Italian songs.  I always order the Queso Fundido as my appetizer.  Their homemade Guacamole is in a league of its own.  My favorite entree is the Pork Barbacoa tacos.  The pork is slow cooked inside a banana leaf.  The rice and beans are excellent.  Canonita also makes excellent margaritas.  They have a $5 margarita special around happy hour.  They don't mind if you just sit and watch the canal after your meal is done.  It's a great place to stop for lunch during a day of shopping!",

The service was prompt and the restaurant had a fun look. We loved the food we had--dessert empanadas, two vegetable egg white omelettes, and cheese enchiladas with egg. The coffee was also great. Our only issue was that a glass came out with lipstick on the rim. It was not a huge deal because it was likely adhered onto the glass during the dishwashing process. A server quickly fixed this situation for us. Overall, we enjoyed our breakfast and would love to try the restaurant for lunch or dinner.",

Highlight 1: Their guacamole. It's the best I've ever had. Granted, I don't have an especially extensive knowledge/experience with guac, but I found it to be extremely tasty. Definitely worth it to spend the small added cost to have it with your chips & salsa.  Highlight 2: Cheese fundido. I'd never had this before dining at Canonita so I have no basis of comparison, but it is definitely delicious. You can add a meat to the cheese (we did chicken once), but I thought it tasted just as good plain, with no meat added.  Highlight 3: Service. This is a casual dining restaurant at the Venetian, but the service is still top notch. Every server I've had has been very polite, friendly, and helpful.  I've never had any of the alcoholic beverages here, so I can't vouch for Canonita in that department, but I've liked everything I've ordered here.

Now, my opinion of the tacos may be colored by knowing in a mere 4 hours I'd be stepping off the plane in Los Angeles, soon to fill my mouth and belly with all sorts of delightful Mexican goodies (thinking of it now, I'm not sure why we chose a taqueria in Vegas anyway), so let me tell you about this margarita.   First, it was 5 bucks--now, 5 bucks is a decent happy hour price in D.C., but in Vegas? Insane. This was called a \"Blackberry Fresca Margarita.\" I'm normally a blended margarita girl, but this delight on ice may have changed my mind. It was fresh blackberries with triple sec and silver tequila, a perfectly refreshing blend of sweet and the 1-2 punch of tequila. Most interestingly, but still wholly enjoyable, was that the glass was rimmed with both salt and sugar, which I've never had.   I genuinely hope this margarita wasn't a special, because everyone who can should try it! I'm planning an attempt at my own as part of a red-white-and-blue drink spread for July 4 this summer.   I would sit through the \"ok\" food in a heartbeat for more of these margaritas.",

While it did not have that oft desired taste of human sacrifice boy was it scrumptious!  The haunting melodies of low wage gondoliers reverberate through the patio for the entire duration of your stay.  As you can guess, it lacks soul too.  But there is heart.  Lots of heart.  If I am not mistaken it is the opening song from the lion king.  The chips are also great.  Tasting not unlike the kind your great grandmother anne felaroe crafted in her tiny tiny kitchen all those years ago.  Everything was going fine until santana featuring rob thomas started playing.  I went through a bad breakup in high school while this song was popular and it left a bad taste in my mouth.  A bad taste the perfectly cooked pork quickly replaced.

Not your traditional Mexican food but very tasty nonetheless. The waiter was really nice and had a very down to earth attitude. He even brought us a sample of their guacamole, which was delicious. I ordered the Tres Tacos and my husband ordered the chicken mole. The mole was exquisite and did not look like any of the mole dishes we've seen. It looked like a more \"fine dining\" version. Decent prices for being in the Venetian. We would definitely go back here.",

Not sure why this guac is good, but it really is.  Since they charge for chip refills anyways, just get the guac.  It has a strong good taste of cilantro - my fav.  We both had the chicken enchiladas- they were good, but nothing too memorable.  Good service- worth a try for the location, and reasonable prices.",

    "text": "2.0 Stars  Canonita Express is located in the mall-like eatery in the Venetian Grand Canal Shoppes. Apparently it's the little sister restaurant of Taqueria Canonita, also located in the vicinity. Despite Taqueria Canonita having better reviews, I don't see Canonita Express living up to the standards of its elder sibling.  Like with most mall-like eateries, the food won't exactly be stellar, but it's quick, convenient, and relatively cheap. I decided to try the steak taco platter for $7.50 and it came with 2 crispy tacos, rice, and beans . The chicken version went for $0.50 cheaper.  The tacos had a nice crisp and the Pico de Gallo on the side was fresh. The steak itself didn't have much flavor, but the hot sauce packets did help. The beans and rice were mediocre at best.  My food came out relatively fast and our server was friendly enough to provide refills on my water. Aside from these factors, I feel there are better options in the food court to try like \"Awesome Panda\".",

    "text": "I'm somewhat shocked that this place averaged 3 1/2 stars.  Coming from Los Angeles, I've had my fair share of Mexican food.  From the hole in the one senora style to even the finer dining version of Mexican restaurants, this place was not too shabby.  First of all, the location is a hit. Right by the canal for viewers to watch gandolas go by, it's a perfect setting.  Then, munch on some nachos with their salsa and guacamole while sipping on some fruity margarita, dinner seemingly sounds better. We feel the buzz from our delicioso margaritas so we go the high route and order the most expensive dish on the menu - the AZTEC BONE IN NY STEAK.  It came with the the crab cornbread with truffle butter.  Lets just say that the crab cornbread with the truffle bread saved this order because this side dish was worth going home to write about.  As for the steak, if you love overdosing on sodium or you just came out of a sweaty and exhausting basketball game, then this over salty steak is just for you!  For folks who don't crave that saltiness (that's me), I would not recommend this dish.  We had to ask for it to be redone and the waitress was extremely nice about it.  I can tell the chef or cook was snooty about this because the 2nd steak we got back had absolutely no flavor, just the meat itself.  You can tell easily what the chef was thinking when he was told that the customer didn't like his steak. I was a big fan of the cornbread.  If you think the cornbread is worth $37 and you have money to dispose, I would give this order a shot. And so what the steak came out overly salty and then the second one came out tame.  We had the salt from our margarita glasses that we used to pick and press onto our flavorless steak and made the most out of it.  All in all, the cornbread, the margarita, chips and salsa and the setting was good.  Just not the salty and unsalty steaks.  If you're looking for a good Mexican restaurant in Vegas, try Border Grill at The Mirage.",

Certainly not the worst margarita i've had, and it was only $5.  Wild mushroom enchiladas were nutritious and delicious, if not scrumptious.  Pinto beans were a tad undercooked, but in a positive way that added nice texture.  Lots of interesting pork options for next time.",

This was DELICIOUS!  I think we got a few \"refills\" before our orders arrived.  We found out afterwards that the restaurant made their own chips on the premise.  The service was excellent.  When our waiter found out that it was my Mom's birthday, he promptly gave her a tequila when drinks were served.  At the end of lunch, he gave her a surprise dessert with happy birthday written on the plate.  Last but not least, he gave us more chips as take-out free of charge.  The restaurant was right on the Grand Canal level.  So even though we were inside, it felt that we were \"outside\" when we were seated at the \"patio.\"  All in all, very excellent eating experience and highly recommended.",

I walked around a lot looking for a place I could have a drink and feel comfortable by myself. I finally found myself in the Venetian. As I walked through I noticed a Mexican restaurant. Not in the mood for wine (as it was unbearably hot out) I opted for a margarita. Javier, the server/bartender was very gracious and friendly. The couple next to me ordered Guacamole and some sort of tomato based shrimp and mussels. It looked great. I had already eaten so just stuck with a drink. Javier was helpful in selecting a top shelf tequila, there was a vast selection. I ended up getting their Jalapeno Margarita, which is made by steeping tequila, sugar and oranges in a large glass container. They also offer a sweeter pineapple based option, which Javier offered to me in a taster sized glass. Very delicious, kind of like a dessert. Thanks for making me feel welcome and giving me a place to rest my feet and cool down.",

The vegetarian entrees at most Mexican restaurants can be dull, but not here.    My boyfriend and I ordered the chile relleno, served with roasted vegetables and jicama salad, and the wild mushroom enchiladas served with borracho beans and rice.  The chile relleno was stuffed with a mixture of dried fruit, almonds, and cheese, and the contrast between sweet and savory was a party in my mouth.  The salad was light and the orange dressing was a refreshing surprise.  The enchiladas were drenched with a velvety poblano sauce, and combined with the mushrooms, the enchiladas just slid down my throat.  The borracho beans were a smoky kidney beans with a hint of chili powder.  Oh, and don't skip the chips and fire roasted salsa; it's so good that you'll want to drink it straight from the bowl.  For dessert, we shared the Ancho Brownie, garnished with pepita ice cream.  This ancho infused brownie was ooey, gooey, and very fudgy.   The ambiance is nice for people watching, and the restaurant's location next to the canal gives the illusion that you are dining outside.  It can be a bit noisy, but all in all, I'd eat here again.",

We had a reservation for lunch at 3pm on the patio to enjoy the ambiance, people watching and gondola rides. We were told it was happy hour. We tried to place an order for a drink that was on the happy hour menu, but were told it was only available in the main dining area, not on the patio. We asked if we could order our drinks in the bar and bring it to our table and our waitress highly discouraged it. We asked if there was something she could do and she said she didn't know. Ok, whatever. We ended up just ordering our drinks through our waitress. We got chips and salsa for the table, but they charge for that. It's not complimentary, like most standard mexican restaurants.   When placing an order, our waitress kept leaving to go ask questions to the manager. She obviously had no knowledge of the menu. We asked her for a cheese quesadilla with beans on the side and she said they couldn't do that. Huh? Seriously?!?   We ordered the mushroom enchiladas. 10 minutes later our waitress comes back and says they're out of mushroom enchiladas. So we order a bean burrito with beans and veggies inside. 10 minutes later, a different waitress comes by to tell us they can't do a bean burrito with beans inside because the flour tortilla would become soggy. Ok. So, we asked her what else she had to offer that was vegetarian? She replied mushroom enchiladas. We told her that our previous waitress just told us your kitchen was out of mushroom enchiladas. She simply replied, no, we have it. Ummm....ok. Communication issues much?   We finally get our food almost an hour and a half after initially being seated. The mushroom enchiladas were good, but nothing to write home about. Guacamole was also tasty, but after dealing with all of the headaches of our waitress and slow service, I can't recommend this restaurant to anyone. Go to Dos Caminos inside The Palazzo instead. You won't get the ambiance, but at least you'll get delicious Mexican food with good service and capable waiters/waitresses.",

It is still nice as I recall overlooking the canals and a great spot to people watch if there were still people walking around.   Let me tell you this... your favored three SBC bros. did not let you down. We drank our asses off on sangria in the last hour that place was open. Everything, from discussions of where to go next, to inside politics, to the cute girl that walked on by took on a very alcoholic slant that induced laughter till the wee hours of the morning.

Saw Canonita and said, let's try Mexican in Vegas.    The decor at Taqueria Canonita is characterized by high-ceilings, bright bold colors, Mexican tiles and Mexican art. Taqueria Canonita offers outside patio dining beside the Grand Canal which offers views of the Venetian streetscape and passing gondolas.  We started with guacomole and chips.  The guac was fantastic...I could have just eaten that with a spoon.  Great texture, very chunky and flavorful.  My entree was thePescado Vera Cruz - fresh catch of the day (happened to be Mahi Mahi that day) sauteed w/ sweet chiles, red onions, green olives, and lemon all simmered with a hearty marisco broth and white rice.  It was yummy.  I'd get that again if I wanted to eat on the light said.    He ordered the Colima Pollo con Limon - grilled chicken breast marinated w/ lime and roasted garlic topped w/ chayote and red cabbage salad, seasonal grilled vegetable and borracho beans.  I wish I had ordered that instead.  Not only did it look yummy, it was great!  The chicken was tender and juicy.  Total bill with tip:  $58",

So I ordered the Sopa de Tortilla. A dish I love to order in Mexican restaurants. Not terrible, but not balanced and it really tasted only like a bowl of chili. Eh.  Then my friend ordered the 6 taco platter and I tried the Rajas and Mushroom tacos. Blech. No flavor. Plus (and I hate when restaurants do this) although the menu stated the Rajas Tacos came with Queso Fresco (versus just queso), when it came it was melted Jack Cheese.   That is not Queso Fresco. I guess they don't expect people to know the difference!  The only reason I am giving the 2 stars and not 1 is because their house  made salsa was pretty good. Thank god for that, because it was the only way to flavor the tacos!",

It's Vegas (obligatory: baby)!  Q: How is the sangria here? A: Oh! I'm glad you asked. It is absolutely delicious. Chilled to perfection. Nice large chunks of fruit in there. Get a pitcher. Get two! Thank me later! I don't have sangria often but this is the benchmark on which all other sangria pitchers will be judged.  Q: Woah, this looks like it's right next to the canal, right? A: Totally! It's good times. Be bold, heckle the tourists and the gondola operator.  FYI ... Good times, good people, good location, good food, good booze. No hassles? 5-stars!",

    "text": "I had been to this restaurant before, a couple of years ago, and we went again because of the ambiance and good food.  This time food wasn't great, it was okay, and service was bad.  We made a reservation for 6 at 8:15.  I was really hungry, so I suggested to the group that we go a little early to see if we could get in.  I know that on some occasions ( i.e. when restaurants are busy) that just doesn't work, which would have been fine.  However, there were a total of 3 tables occupied in the restaurant and when we walked up to say we were a little early, they looked at us like, \"how dare you!\"  It then took about ten minutes for one man to set up 6 sets of utensils, while three other servers stood around. Also, the hosts didn't smile at all.   Our server was nice and helpful about the menu, but the food and drinks still came out slower than we would have hoped.  Finally, the reason I only give this place one star is because when I checked my checking account balance, my debit card was charged $16 more than it should have been! I don't know who's editing the tips on credit card receipts, whether it be the server, manager, whatever, but that's just really sheisty. I'm a server, and I have never tried to basically, steal money from someone on the 'tips' line.",

We ordered the shrimp and mussels moqueca to share. The curry taste wasn't overpowering and the coconut milk wasn't undermining the curry. It was the perfect blend of flavors. The shrimp and mussels were beautifully cooked with veggies in the most delicious broth.  We also ordered the chicken quesadillas. Much to my surprise and pleasure it did not come hidden underneath cheese. It was perfectly cooked in yummy tortillas and came with guacamole and beans and cilantro rice (I can still taste the rice btw).  You should definitely go and order more food here.  The service was prompt and nice. Our waitress came with the check quickly because we were in a hurry and made no qualms about the fact that we took a table at prime time and only ordered two plates. That's how you get loyal customers I guess ;)",

Its in the Venetian and its right on the canal. But man , outside of that we were left really underwhelmed. Our server was a phantom . We would have to  flag him down multiple times and ask for something like salsa,  and then he would vanish and totally forget to bring whatever we asked for... ....then when we finished we asked for a to-go cup for my wifes beer (you can do that in Vegas) and hes like: 'sure BRB'.....and then disappeared quietly into the night never to be seen again....... granted this was our only experience at this restaurant so maybe it was a fluke but Considering how many fantastic dining options there are in vegas, we would for sure not be returning here...",

    "text": "Two of us had lunch here with a menu selected by the chef.  Here's a list of items served the two of us.  Chips with rustic salsa and spicy chile salsa and guacamole Roasted mussels and shrimp skillet. Jalapeno queso fundido with tortillas. Appetizer trio sampler--tuna ceviche tostada, posole verde, and chorizo gordito. Patzcuaro duck relleno. Toluca portobello mushroom. Wild mushroom enchildas. Santa Rosa pork barbacoa. Shrimp and mussels Moqueca. Carne asada. Trio of desserts--coffee flan, tres leches cake, warm chocolate brownie.  My dining mate was brought a trio of margaritas to sample in the beginning and later we each were brought a trio of aqua fresca drinks--horchata, prickly pear cactus with lemonade, and watermelon.  I have rarely had a meal when I left without having some comment about something being able to be done better or spiced more or something along those lines. Everything I tasted yesterday was perfectly executed and beautifully plated. Some standouts were the posole verde. Prepared differently than I've ever seen, there was hominy, diced pork, green chile, tomatillos, Mexican oregano, shredded cabbage, and shredded red radish. What a great take on a classic soup! Another was the shrimp and mussel moquec--a Brazilian dish done here with a Mexican flair. The coconut aji amarillo sauce, looking like a curry but tasting nothing like it, gave the shrimp, rice, and mussels a great flavor. Last, the Patzcuaro duck relleno, a Michoacan dish, was superb! The duck confit was excellent. The dish is normally made with smaller poblano chiles, but Chef Willey made two larger ancho chile versions yesterday.  Service throughout lunch was top notch. The ingredients of every dish were explained and we were alerted when we were being served something that was spicy but there was nothing that would raise any spice alarms for me. The green salsa made with several chiles including habanero was spicy hot and I liked it.  Executive chef Willey came by several times to check on us, answer questions, and explain how some of the dishes came about. The General Manager, Annaliza McKinney, also came by to check up on us.  Two hours after being seated I left, very full and very satisfied. Every dish was really well done and I was pleased to have had the chance to try Canonita--a restaurant that I've walked by many times and always wanted to try but somehow never did.",

Clearly popular and on par for prices in Vegas, the food is plentiful and tasty. (Seems like it could be a chain, but never seen one elsewhere.)  Service was prompt and attentive, and they cater for all ages and group sizes.   We went with Chile relleno and the seafood stew, the latter being the better choice. Margaritas were tasty - classic for me, jalapeno for him (big thumbs up on this one!).

We ordered the chicken enchiladas and they were light and flavorful! The shrimp and mussels appetizer was MOUTH WATERING! The side of vegetables were perfectly cooked. The churros for dessert were BEYOND. Case and point - Canonita is a must stop if you're at the Venetian; but even if you're not, it's worth the trip!",

Located on the canal in the Venetian we sat on the patio, enjoying both a view of the canal and the bar and the kitchen. Lots to see and enjoy!  The place seems to draw a good crowd but we had no problem getting reservations via OpenTable.   I have vivid memories of both the great service and food. We enjoyed Mexican pancakes, breakfast burrito, chilaquiles, and something else. I can only remember so much. I had the chilaquiles and really enjoyed them.   A really good experience!",

Details:  Place is found in the Grand Canal Shoppes at Venetian. It's not too expensive and one of the few decent sit down Mexican joints on the strip. Margaritas are awesome and the drinks are not at all watered down.   Service is very good. Never had an issue.   On busy weekends make a reservation through Yelp or Open Table ahead of time.

Simple!  I've been on the road a month and I missed this cuisine terribly. Living in L.A. Mexican food is a staple for me and SoCal (other than Mexico) has the best!  So here I am at Canonita salivating over their comprehensive menu wanting to order everything. I settle for the beef Mexico City style enchiladas with rice and beans. Good call on my part, this combo plate was delicious. Washing it all down with a Pacifico beer, I was a happy camper.  The service and atmosphere at Canonita are terrific.   I finished my dinner, hopped in a taxi, saw Hamiton (the musical) and put this evening down as one of my better ones this year.",

Depending on seat availability (and how many people in the party), you can get a seat next to the canal to watch passing-by gondoliers/gondolas.  The waiter came out right away as soon as I was seated. My waiter was hepful in explaining the available drinks and menu. As usual, I often order \"whatever the bartender wants to make\" drink and had the taco sampler. The drink was so good I had to order a second one. I think it was a spin of \"mule\" (Moscow mule?) of some type.  The ambiance was great if you want to take a break from all the noise and traffic of Venetian. You still get to observe/watch the crowd but you are sitting down enjoying a great meal.  The tacos were delicious  Price is pretty decent and affordable.",

First off , They charge you for chips n salsa which is free at virtually every Mexican Resturant . The salsa is bland & no flavor.   The ceviche trio was NOT fresh n we had to send back. The Chef try's to get too creative with his ceviche recipes as one is more disgusting n lacking flavor or seasoning as the next.  Way overpriced fajitas , which once again had zero flavor , no seasoning and very low quality meat (steak). They basically give u about 7-8 pieces of very fatty meat and load up on the vegetables and get u for $18. The chicken quesadilla literally smelled like that stuff u find between ur toes. We basically ate almost nothing and they credited us for most of the food. When the waitress agrees that the quality had gone done hill fast , it's never a good sign. Would never go back even if they comped the entire meal . I'm embarrassed for this place and the Mgr. seems so aloof to the problems . There are way better places to eat in Las Vegas for the same $$ , don't waste ur time n money at this place.",

We're not the type to walk around Vegas with a huge tube of alcohol, or lack of in this case, but my friend's been saying he would get one of those one day but we didn't think it would cost us $31! Seriously it would've been a great deal if it had a lot of alcohol in it, but it just tasted like bland watermelon juice.  I'm glad that we didn't wait 30mins for dinner because it doesn't seem like the food would've been good. We headed to Dos Caminos @ the Palazzo which has better ratings. Drinks were great over there.",

But, Canonita proved to be a pleasant surprise with it's quality ingredients and above average execution. Located  in the Grand Canal area of the Venetian with much of the narrow restaurant overlooking the man made waterways and sitting under the faux sky, the ambiance can be surprisingly relaxing.  Their drink list is full of custom cocktails and margaritas. The pineapple infusion margarita ($11) was excellent with tropical flavors and hints of vanilla. For those that can't decide, they've got a margarita flight ($15) with a classic,  jalapeno, and pineapple version.  Plenty of popular dishes can be found on the menu like flautas ($12), three per order, all crispy and tightly rolled with ample amount of ground beef inside topped with an avocado-tomatillo sauce, lettuce and quest fresco. The entrees were quite good. The wild mushroom enchiladas ($21), covered in a poblano cream sauce, were an excellent vegetarian option. The Santa Rosa pork barbacoa ($21) was a hefty portion of for-tender meat topped with a slightly acidic sauce, surrounded by fluffy and buttery cilantro rice and accompanied by tortillas to make your own tacos.",

Friend got the salmon which was probably a better call but overall the menu doesn't have a ton of choices and there just are so many other better places.   Plus side: good view of canal.",

And I still couldn't get it down- no bueno. Had the chips and salsa and guacamole. Star of the night was the guac. Maybe should have had a draft Mexican beer and guac and  left happy. Ventured to the crab salad next- it was OK, a little over dressed. Ordered the carne nortena- had a salty crust on it- too much; needed to back off. I think the server was stretched because  he went missing for long periods of time. When he did stop by he was attentive but you could tell he was harried. All in all it was over $100 for two and just OK. So many options in Vegas might want to just hit this for the view and an appetizer and keep moving.",

Service subpar.   Booking a reservation through open table was a breeze and was honored when I showed up. And the good service comes to an end right there. Being seated right next to the canal was something very beautiful that you can only do in Vegas. Lights hang above your head and overall it really is a beautiful location. But the food does not match anything close to the decor. You'd expect amazing food at a prime spot at one of the world's largest hotels. Unfortunately not so much at this place. Not horrid, but definitely not wow. The fajitas were just there. You're tasting the steak the peppers the onions, but where's the wow ? Where's the melting in your mouth? Where's the mmm? Perhaps the waiter took it along with the what seems to look like a place with awesome service on the outside. Not too attentive despite a not so busy day. When asked for lemon or anything else to be brought at the table it took a good 10 minutes for the waiter to come around again. All in all was checked up on once. I suppose the service matches the food. Mediocre. It is a True travesty both could not match what is other wise a beautiful restaurant in a prime location. Do I recommend it ? It depends , what's your definition of a memorable restaurant experience while you're on vacation?",

I had some issues dealing with some other restaurants and finding a place that worked with our budget. For the event pricing, the prices were reasonable and the food and ambiance matched what we were looking for.   The event coordinator, Jessica, was great to work with. She was accommodating and very responsive. In our party, we had a child, an infant, and someone with special needs. Jessica and the restaurant staff were accommodating.  We had a special menu that our guests were allowed to pick from at the time of the event. I liked that we were able to do that instead of deciding days/weeks before the event. Our table was along the canal and we were situated a little further from everyone else. It worked out perfectly for us. Everyone at the table enjoyed the chips, salsa, guac, and their menu items. I had the Vaquero Beef Rib. It was excellent! It was tender and the polenta that came with it was great. I also tried the Chile Relleno. It was good. We had a great time and great food - we couldn't be happier with our choice.",

Unfortunately, I feel like the dining experiences in the Las Vegas area just aren't as exciting as they used to be. Canonita is no exception. I'm not saying the food was bad. But, for the prices these places are charging, I want to feel like I am getting my money's worth. And, come on... charging $4 for chips and salsa?  and another $9 to add guac???   Our dinner just was not exciting enough to make me want to come back. Standard Mexican fair at twice the price. . .",

The food was pretty good but the reason why I will not go back is because they charged me .75 for salsa. Are you serious? I ordered a burrito and the cheese fundito. I asked for hot sauce or salsa, which they brought out. But I couldn't believe when I saw the charge for salsa at a Mexican food restaurant. This is absolutely unacceptable. What's next? Charging me for ketchup on my hamburger? Ridiculous.  Forgot to mention. Chips and salsa are extra. They also made me a cherry coke using grenadine. But when I asked for a refill, the bartender said no more grenadine. This place is poorly run and not up to Vegas standards. Hire a new manager and make the experience fun instead of nickel and diming us to death.",

Venice feels great, when you get a seat munching on food right next to water with singing people and tourists.  I m late reviewing this place and it's food, probably missed it amidst the glitter of Las Vegas. The food here is good, and we also tried some margaritas to go with our food, which were a bit disappointing. Couldn't taste much alcohol in them, so had them get a new order, which were far more improved version.  The food was good, but nothing out of the world. We tried tres leeches which was just ok, expected it too be better, but too much orange killed it.  I wished the food was a bit better as the location and service were excellent. Would like to come here and try something new next time, the vibe is just amazing.",

I also ordered a side of guacamole.  Do not order it if you are the only one at the table that likes it because they give u a lot.  My hub ordered the braised beef tacos which he stated that he did not like the taste of the taco shells, but did enjoy the rice.  He said the meat was seasoned well.  I also ordered the ginger tea which was delicious.  It's a nice place.  A tad pricey but we wanted to try something different than the food court options.

We both really liked the food and loved the view of the gondola canal -we even saw a wedding in one of the gondolas while we were dining here! Once we decided to have our wedding in Vegas, we knew we wanted to have dinner here. I had been working with Valerie since I made the reservation around July 2017 so it was definitely a long planning process! Valerie was so patient and accommodating with my requests and questions, she made sure everything turned out perfect! At first I wanted a simple dinner, no extra requests. But after speaking with our photographer from the Wynn hotel where we had our ceremony, she suggested we could do a cake cutting at the restaurant which I brought up to Valerie. I was able to order a cake through the AquaKnox bakery -Valerie allowed me to customize it with flowers, my own cake topper, cutter and server. I sent her a pinterest inspiration image which she gave to the bakery and it turned out  A M A Z I N G!!! The bakery totally nailed it and it was so delicious too! The staff at Canonita were awesome as well! We requested our own sweetheart table when we got there -my dress was pretty fluffy with the long train so it was difficult to sit amongst everyone else with the chairs being so close. I asked one of the servers and they brought out a table and two chairs for us right away and took our drink orders as well. They definitely made sure we had everything we needed. They also made sure we were on schedule and reminded us towards the end of dinner about the cake cutting. Overall, we had an amazing experience and would definitely recommend Canonita for dining and special events. Thank you Valerie and Canonita for helping make our wedding day so special!",

The food was very good and our particular server was nice. My daughter is a very successful food/lifestyle blogger in NYC so when the food came out she took our plates to an EMPTY table by the water to do a 2 minute shoot for her blog which would have been free advertising for the place. A lady came over.I don't know if she was a server or the manager and blessed her out, saying loudly, you can't do that . Move that stuff right now! Talk about rude! My daughter tried to explain, but this woman was not hearing it. She kept repeating now we will have to reset this table! Really lady. Nobody is eating here. I wanted to just leave but we stayed. I guess this blog will be different than the one last week where she was invited to The James Beard House. Inexcusable behavior.",

Waitress was nice and gave excellent suggestions, and this is what we ordered:  Chips and guac: Bf wanted side of guac for his burrito, and waitress suggested getting this ($8) as it comes with chips, salsa, and a big tub of guac rather than $6 for a tiny dish of it. She was right...salsa is AMAZING! Guac was plenty flavorful with a slight kick, and the chips were light, fresh, and salty yum! Not oily or heavy at all :)  Chicken burrito: Yum. Came in a big plate with rice, lettuce/tomatoes, and black beans. Wet burrito...very filling and flavorful. It was a wonderful dish.  Ceviche sampler: Came with a different type of tortilla chips...thicker and flaky with some seasoning. The crab-shrimp ceviche was AMAZING and the lemon added a zing to it. Ahi tuna/mango was very good as well, but you really need to mix it in the sauce otherwise it has a slightly fishy smell. The fish ceviche was okay, but rather plain and the oil really threw me off. The sampler as a whole was not bad though.  I think the bf and I found a new restaurant for us to be regulars at! Very relaxing atmosphere, good food at a decent Vegas price....what more can we want? Only thing is that for happy hour, the well drinks (whiskey and coke for instance) comes in a super tiny cup...may not be worth it.",

But then you taste it, damnnnnn, before you know it you're on your third cup of it.   I've been coming here every Vegas trip for years, they must have a high turnover as far as staff goes becuase I don't recognize one person each time. Its a little cheesy watching the singing gondolas go by while you're drinking overpriced Don Juilio Real and munching on the chips and salsa, but hey its Vegas.   Back to the salsa, because as far as the food goes, we're spolied in L.A., we get better mexican food at little holes in the wall and at home than we do in these high end joints. It seems like they've kicked the salsa up a notch in recent years, still gabacho friendly but with a little bit more of a kick.",

    "text": "We will become regulars here very, very soon.  We like to go to restaurants and eat a few bites here and there, plus a good signature cocktail, wine or beer. Taqueria Canonita satisfied every taste bud possible.  We ordered: Sake to Me (Sake, Tequila, Horchata and Cinnamon), Chips, guacamole and salsa, and then two chicken tacos, one beef taco, one pork taco and one fish taco. Before I told the waiter, Ishmael, that I was gluten free, I asked if the tacos came with corn tortillas. This one comment lit a lightbulb and he knew I was gluten free and just a list of knowledge came from his mouth. He told me I couldn't have this or that meat because it is marinaded in beer or soy sauce (without checking with his chef/manager), that I can have the flautas, but they're fried with glutenous items, that the chips were safe because they were corn and that we must have the guacamole. WOW.   Normally I love guacamole that burns and cools all at the same time. Taqueria's guacamole was excellent, and that's without them asking if we would like it mild, medium or spicy. I didn't care that it didn't burn, it was fresh and delicious. The salsa had a healthy kick but the lime and cilantro added great flavor to the chips and tacos.   The drink? Wowzers. Not too sweet, not too savory, not a strong taste of alcohol but it definitely had a punch. Creamy but still silky without being too rich. I will try to replicate this drink at home until my dying day.  The tacos. Ohhhhh, the tacos. I wish I had ordered five of the fish tacos with a beautiful mango salsa, grilled and blackened and oh so happy. The chicken tacos were made of white AND dark meat (necessary)and were tender and flavorful and were topped with cilantro and onions. My husband could have eaten the beef tacos all night (not gluten free), and he said they were some of the top beef tacos he's ever had (and we eat far too many tacos). The pork tacos did not ignite as much excitement, but he still enjoyed them just the same. All of them were wrapped in homemade, thick, warm corn tortillas which made my world go round that night.   All in all, we will be back. If you're gluten free, get over here now. Great environment, try to sit on the patio which rests alongside the canals in the canal shoppes so you can hear the beautiful singing of the gondoliers and relax under the beautiful Venetian skies.",

I was seated with a table of 12 of my coworkers for a team dinner.The waiter had already served drinks to the first arrivals but when the rest of us got there it was literally about 20 minutes before he came back again. From there it was just a service nightmare. I think this guy figured that it was a party of more than 8 so his gratuity would be just automatic. After that, he phoned it in.  I asked for a veggie quesadilla-simple request-take your cheese one and add some peppers and onions. The server literally said \"We won't have any veggies up any time soon other than potatoes.\" Most bizarre comment ever. I got an entree salad that had a few beans and tomatoes but other than that was a snooze fest.  It took about 45 minutes to get our entrees and by the time it was all said and done, the entire ordeal was nearly 3 hours long. That was from seating to the completion of the meal-and believe me, it's not because all my coworkers felt like hanging out all night. Skip it!",

The guys were still heading down from the hotel, so we felt completely rushed and uncomfortable. We finally ordered and mine was wrong, and we sent it back. The manager started laughing! The place was a joke. If you are closing why would you seat a party of four? It makes no sense. Don't seat us and then rush us out. It was very strange and we will never be back.

So glad we had lunch there! First of all, the gondoliers belt out beautiful songs there as they make the turn to head back under the bridges under the painted sky. We opted to sit right next to the waterway and were not disappointed with our view and dining experience. Our server was friendly, knowledgeable and quick to refill my husband's ice tea numerous times; thanks Juliette! The food was delish and the picky eater in our group was happily fed. I'm still craving the Queso Fundido and I have to go back and order the Taco Sampler again so I can have more of that Mushroom Taco. Would not have typically ordered that but it was packed full of flavor and had I not already been stuffed, I would've surprisingly finished that too! Unfortunately our tabletop was a little small for containing our order but it was definitely worth shuffling plates around a bit and the servers were very accommodating. Overall, a great experience which I intend to revisit in the future and I highly recommend trying out if you are in Las Vegas.",

We had seating on the patio, but because we were on the far end near the shops I almost wish we had just taken a table inside because you couldn't see the water anyway. Just something to consider when you have a large guest- you will not be right by the water.   The food is not good enough to make me want to come back and I think more than a few people were a little disappointed in their dishes. I will say though that if you are looking for a spot that does Mexican dishes a little differently, with a creative twist, this might be your place.   I will mention that the hosts were very friendly but our main serve did not make me feel comfortable.",

She is excited to be working there, loves the food and just has a wonderful positive energy that can't help but make you smile. I highly suggest asking for her if she is working when you are there.

The flautas are a tasty appetizer - be sure to spread the sauce on each bite!  One of my favorite dishes here is the quesadilla (see attached photo). We've also tried the Mexico City Enchiladas and a few other dishes, and always the sauce and the freshness of the ingredients made it tasty and delicious.  The margaritas are a little small, but that's okay if you're a light drinker.  And the location is relaxing, with the gondola boats floating by the railing.  This place gets super busy at peak times, so we try to go at off hours to get a seat without waiting too long.  The service is pretty good - most of the wait staff have been friendly, so we'll be back.",

Our waitress messed up our order and split the kids lunch (quesadilla) which I didn't ask for. Luckily she did because my son did not like it.  So that saved me money. The waitress was slow to get us refills on drinks. Save your money and go to a fancy restaurant, you'll pay the same price. I paid the same amount for lunch here as I did for a 5 Star meal at Chef Ramsay's Hell's Kitchen at Cesar's Palace. Which was unbelievable good! Best service there too!

I ordered a drink, chips & salsa, plus guacamole to start ($14 btw). Everything tasted fine and very fresh, but the waiter only came over once during the hour or so that I was there. He did not stop by to see if I wanted to actually order dinner, so I got the check (which I of course had to flag him down and ask for, and then wait another 10 mins before I got it) and left after paying.

The food though... the food was freaking fantastic and so were the sangria de rojo and regular sangrias. Barbacoa, fajitas, burritos - all outstanding. The sangria de rojo is an awesome mix of a red sangria and a margarita. Heavenly! I like to sit near the canal and watch the gondolas.

The chips and guac are a must try along with the chicken fajitas.  So much flavor packed into each of the items!  The decor and feel of the place is like a True modern cantina.  Sit along the edge of the canal and watch as the gondolas circle through the end of the canal.  The server was very friendly, knowledgable of the menu, and prompt to get us whatever we needed.  Overall a great experience.  If you're looking for mexican food in this area of the strip it's worth a try!",

Not bad, but nothing that will bring me back again with all the other Vegas dining options. They do have a great \"Patio\" - next to the indoor grand canal. So that was fun.  Service was awesome... I even forgot my brand new sweater....they had it tucked away safe for me!",

The tacos are neither street nor gourmet: on a par with Chipotle. The sauce on the chile relleno had way too much tomato and not nearly enough spice and tasted more Italian than Mexican. Also, the batter was the thickest, breadiest - not light, airy, or fluffy - that I've ever had.   On the plus side, the chips were freshly made and warm, the cilantro rice was tasty, and the shrimp cocktail was decent.",

We started with the Guacamole.. pretty standard fare, no complaints.    I had my standard favorite which was the Pollo Mole Poblano, which was an excellent choice. They had a Quinoa side listed for another dish, so I substituted that for the rice and I wasn't disappointed!  This really made my dish unique and awesome.

They were able to get us a table fairly quickly. Our server was attentive and friendly through out the experience.  We started with the Queso Fundido. We opted to add the housemade chorizo and house pickled jalapenos. It was good. The chorizo and jalapenos were nice additions. The cheese was good on its own but those additions gave it even more flavor and texture. One of these is a good starter for up to four people.  For my meal I chose the Pork A La Michocana. It is a roasted tenderloin with manchamantel sauce and cranberry-tomatillo chutney. It comes with roasted vegetables and potatoes gratin. The pork was ok. It was a touch dry but the flavor was good. The potatoes were the best part for me. I truly enjoyed them. You get a large portion of them too.  This is a solid place. It falls somewhere between three and four stars for me. The service was good. The food was mostly good.",

Really liked sitting \"outside\" next to the canal to watch and listen to the gondolas passing by. So relaxing and enjoyable. Nice selection of classic and more modern dishes. Shared the Vaquero beer-braised short ribs and they were so tender with wonderful flavors. Also had the flour tacos - chicken, beef and fish - all so good. And to have some greens, enjoyed the chicken tortilla salad - very fresh and crunchy. We couldn't pass up the highly recommended tres leches and chocolate brownies accompanied by some coffee and Baileys. Very much enjoyed each course. Staff and service were wonderful and attentive. Will be back again when in the canal shops. Highly recommended.",

    "text": "This restaurant is a great spot to grab some food for a casual dining experience. It's located inside the Venetian and is situated right alongside their indoor canal. Food is great! Service is excellent! Drinks are delightful! They describe themselves as Mexico City Soul Food and I think they nailed it with that. The food was so delicious - traditional Mexican food with an upgraded twist. Not your average Mexican restaurant that's for sure! I had the Barbacoa which had some really good, flavorful spices and coupled it with their \"Independent\" cocktail off their happy hour menu (which also had some great beverage choices for the adults!) Would definitely recommend and go again! Lastly - If you are deciding between the short rib plate and the barbacoa, I highly recommend the barbacoa because of the sides it comes with. Short rib plate is a little more hearty and heavy because of the hominy which tastes similar to creamy mashed potatoes and the tortilla chips crumbled on top. The Barbacoa plate is paired excellently with cilantro rice (SO SO GOOD) and black beans with a side of tortillas.",

Settled along the indoor river, Canonita is a large establishment that features great food at reasonable prices, or at least, as reasonable as you would find on the strip. The taste is amazing to their credit and the service is professional and efficient. I have come in big parties and small, they have always been able to accommodate me fairly quickly. The drinks are pretty strong here as well. There isn't anything I didn't like here, except maybe the prices but that is the Vegas strip in general. Overall, if you want some good Mexican food, I recommend coming to Cananita.",

Afterwards, we both got really horrible (read: painful) gas bubbles, which isn't normal after I eat Mexican. So, for the price, I expected much better food that doesn't cause discomfort.

Different strokes I guess. I sampled the drink in the coconut (don't remember the name), and a habanero margarita. My drinks were delicious and the coconut drink was awesome as well. We also had a great server and I enjoyed hanging out here on a Sunday morning while the boys were enjoying the football game.

Given it was NY eve, we didn't want to venture out from where we were staying (Mirage).  I yelped for a few other Mex places and came across Canonita and decided to give this place a shot. I am glad we did. We were a party of 5 and got seated immediately.  Jonathan, our waiter, was engaging and gave us great tips on what to order.  We were given ample amount of chips and salsa dips to start.  The chips were freshly made and hot.  I got a five taco entree which you can mix and match the protein (chicken, beef, fish, etc). No additional if you get fish.  It was nice to see they also offer corn tortilla as my wife has gluten allergy.  She got the scallops appy which was also fresh.  For drinks, we got the frozen margarita mango flavor.  Wow that was one tall pitcher for $41.  All in all, great great place and highly recommended.",

And certainly a meal type. It's not going to over stuff you. My plate that included the chicken mole. Was very tasty.   As appetizers we also went for the Pork Empanadas. Which by the way were very sweet tasting. I am more into sweetness then spicy foods. They were rather small. But I'd definitely go back for those.   Then for desert we finished with a tres leches . Sharing it. It definitely was \"tres leches\" it wasn't at all dry. Had sufficient fruit on it as well.   To drink we had two Horchatas and one Watermelon. I think something like the Horchata was spiked because I felt rather dizzy throughout.   The service was very nice our waitress was very attentive and quick. The restaurant was actually very empty maybe that's why the service wasn't late.   The bill was $85 and I would come back.",

But i don't recommend ordering the quesadilla, it's a pretty simple dish, but they found a way to mess it up, the cheese was a bit odd, and the frijoles and arroz was very bland, no flavor what so ever. The pico de gallo had some flavor, also you have to pay for your chips and salsa here, but at a traditional Mexican restaurant it's not common where you pay for the chips and salsa.",

If you read my other reviews, you know I'm especially hard on any Mexican food, especially ones located under a fake blue sky and a much cleaner version of Venice's grand canal.   Boy, was I surprised. I started off with a few bites of the ceviche and ordinary chips and salsa, which were both surprisingly tasty. I ordered the three pork tacos with corn tortillas and they were done very well. Their flavors weren't too strong, which I liked.   Can I just write that it tasted, well, good?  Oh, and the horchata...magnificent! Perfectly balanced between sweetness and thickness. One of the best cups I've had.  For the price, atmosphere, location, and food, this place strikes a good balance for those on a budget but don't want to wander onto the strip looking for the McD's/Denny's/Chipotle around the corner.",

Both were great, my boyfriend doesn't eat mussels but was exceptionally wowed by the broth that they sit in (weird, I know).  I had the platter of tacos, which was excellent. My boyfriend has enchiladas which he said were seasoned great.  The setting is right off the end of the Venetian canal.  The location is central to that of Ceasers palace and the Wynn",

    "text": "Mexican food at an Italian themed hotel. That should have been the red flag :)  Definitely not my favorite of my time in Vegas, but a decent meal. Not quite sure I'd give it only 2 stars, but it's not truly a 3, though their Cilantro Rice made me feeling generous.   We started our meal with the following apps: Chips, Salsa and Guacamole. Salsa was good- fresh, hint of spice, tomato based salsa. The Guacamole...ok. I'm not too keen of tomatoes in my guac. I prefer it to be simple- garlic, lime, cilantro & onion, it was just ok. Queso Fundido w/ Chorizo- My fave of the apps- Slightly spiced, ooey, gooey cheesy dip mixed with crumbled chorizo sausage and served with warm tortillas. Yum! Pork Empanadas- Crisp pockets of shredded seasoned pork  For my main dish I chose the Tres Tacos with the Grilled Chicken, Grilled Fish and Crispy Pork Belly. The chicken was pretty basic- grilled citrus flavored chicken amply piled into the soft taco shell. The Grilled Fish- my least favorite- had an odd overly fishy taste. I didn't get sick from it, so I don't think it was bad, but it was poorly flavored. I'm not sure what they put on it, but perhaps they should just stick to some S&P and grill, leave it simple. The Crispy Pork Belly- well...it wasn't very crispy. I was definitely expecting something different. Something closer to a bacon texture? The Pork, with a nice smoky flavor, was tender but didn't have that crisp sear I was hoping for especially given the description, but still tasty.  The highlight of this dish? The Cilantro Rice! WOW! I loved this stuff! What a great fresh, light taste! It had the familiar light and fluffy texture of mexican rice, but was tinged green from the cilantro and had this great herbaceous, savory cilantro flavor! Had I known about this rice, I would have nixed the beans for sure! This rice along earned it the additional 3rd star :)   The service was friendly and the food came out timely though we did have to flag down our server to get refills.   With a plethora of options in Vegas, I'll definitely pass on this one on my future visits, overall a 2.5 star review, but that rice! So delish, for me earned that extra 1/2 star.",

Since it opened, I have not gone to Vegas without eating there.  Everything is delicious without exception - right down to the salsa and chips that are hard not to fill up on.  Even the rice, which comes as a side with just about everything, is not to be missed.  The star of the meal, however, is always their salsa verde - hands down the best salsa verde I've ever had.  Ask for a side of it (they will charge you $1 or so but it's worth it) and pour it onto whatever you end up eating.  Don't expect a taqueria in the conventional sense because Canonita has little in common with the holes-in-the-wall where you often find the best Mexican food.  Which is not to say Canonita isn't authentic - it's just a gentrified (and thereby both healthier and more elaborate) version of the same cuisine.",

The beans were good, too.  We also had chips and guacamole which was very big and quite good.  I was definitely full when I left here.

Not your typical taqueria nor Mexican food you typically find in the US, but not perfectly authentic since this is Vegas. The recommended things are the tacos as an appetizer and the smoked/steamed carnitas in a banana leaf. The guacamole was ok, if not a little bland. Their salsa is ok, lacking a little on spiciness for my taste though.   The service was friendly and efficient. The place does get loud since your on the canal and you have multitudes of people walking by. There's also a bar with decent drinks. Their margarita mix is way too sweet though.",

Anyway Canonita is definitely on the other end of the spectrum; it's the type that doesn't serve margaritas by the pitcher. Still tasty in served in a glass though. I had the carne asada, which was delicious. Did I have a lobster tail with it? ...I'm sure it was delicious if I did.  I loved the setting! We sat in the \"outdoor\" area of the restaurant.

We weren't in the \"patio\" (along the canal), but were beneath a graceful arch and close enough to see the gondolas drifting by - actually they were maneuvering quite a bit because it's near the embarkation point.  In fact, the only thing separating us was a small group celebrating a wedding - I thought it a very suitable venue for a Vegas reception....more of a choice to forego the big church wedding and Italian honeymoon instead of a we-can't-afford-it substitute.  Well, that's the vibe I got since they had obviously put in a lot of attention to detail with the nicest spot, table set up, cake table, etc.  Well, it lent some romance to our dinner since we weren't a menage a trois, but there with our teenage son.  The menu was very tempting - there were a few things we couldn't decide between.  Looking over at the next table, I recommended that my son order a dish full of shell fish, chicken skewers, and delicious looking bread; it turned out not to be quite enough for him.  The ceviche appetizer was sufficient as an entree for me though - the tuna was good, the shrimp and olive too salty, and the third not memorable.  Oh, another diner came over and asked me what I thought of it, so the dishes match the menu description very accurately!  My husband had the succulent pork, and we shared a carafe of strong (I felt) sangria.  It would have been nice if chips and salsa were included instead of being offered separately on the menu (duh, restaurateurs, I probably could have handled more sangria then).  I'm recommending it for kids also because watching the boats is pretty entertaining, it's noisy anyway, and I imagine the railings are close enough that they can't slip through.  I think this place was mentioned in one of the in-room magazines, but in this case, it wasn't all hype.  Besides the tastiness, the setting and presentation make it truly special.",

He said that everything on the menu was to die for, except the chicken enchiladas.  This made my choice very easy as I was trying to decide between the mushroom and chicken enchiladas.  They were A-MAZING.  I ate up every bite until my stomach hurt (not such great self-control this evening).    On another note, there are two different kinds of rice that could possibly come with your order- mine came with a plain white rice with some veggies and some of the entrees came with a cilantro rice.  i was a bit jealous that mine didn't have cilantro rice. So, if you might care about such a thing, you may want to specify which kind of rice you want.   I'm only not giving it 5 stars because of the service/timing of the food delivery.  We sat down and waited a good ten minutes before our waiter came over for our drink order.  When he came, he was wonderful and talkative.  We waited another good 5-8 minutes before we got our drinks, and salsa and chips.  We ordered our entrees at this time and they were in front of us in the next five minutes.  It kind of threw the dinner off a bit, and was a bit irritating.  I'd definitely check it out again, in hopes that the service would be more consistent and they could earn that last star back!",

We decided to go to Taqueria Canonita because we can sit next to the canals and watch the gondaliers. We have also eaten here in the past and the food was very good.  The hostess was very friendly and promptly seated us next to the canal. We waited for quite awhile before the waiter came over to bring water, it went south from here. He took the drink order and we never saw him again. The manager delivered our drinks, brought the water we had originally requested and that was the extent of our service.  This was very disappointing as the restaurant was by no means full. The waiter never checked back in nor did the manager. He dropped the check on the table without even stopping and was observed chit chatting over off to the side while tables were being ignored. We left cash to cover the drinks, no tip.  Although the food is good, and the ambiance of being next to the canal is nice, the service of an eatery speaks volumes to me. I doubt I will ever go back. If I treated my clients with that same type of service I would be out of business. Maybe they ought to think of that, my bill pays your wages, without a client you won't have a job. Enough preaching. Just disappointed in the lack of service I am seeing in some of my past favorites in Las Vegas.",

You can sit right at the edge and see the gondolas go by and sing. All of the food that I've had here was good quality, good size portions (I'm usually STUFFED when I leave here), and tasty margs.  Definitely will come back again and again when I am in vegas.",

He offered great guidance on choices and was just all around amazing.  A special thanks to him for a great time.    The setting is very pleasant on the canal shops in the Venetian.  The table salsa was smoky and delicious.  Joey suggested a particular Tequila flight was was fun to experience the differences between the Tequilas.  All of the food was great.  For me this was 4 1/2 stars but Joey made it a 5 1/2.  A great stop if you are ever looking for a casual spot in Vegas.",

We ordered chips & salsa, several drinks ( 8) and throughout the entire time we got excellent service. Many people around us were also commenting how down to earth and great the service is at the Canonita Bar, which I can't help but agree. I've been coming to this bar since 2012 and will continue to go during their happy hour.   Thanks again Mario!",

    "text": "Stopped in tonight (Wednesday) at about 8:30 pm and was dining solo.  The hostess asked if I wanted a place at their shared tables - I expect this was because they had some type of private event going on taking up a lot of spots that are \"canal\" side. I decided I'd rather sit at the bar and was immediately helped by multiple bartenders offering me Margaritas and the like.  I was looking for a lighter and less calorie stuffed meal, so ordered a large Pellegrino w/Lime.    The bartenders seemed very knowledgeable about the menu and practically congratulated me for my decision to order the Pozole Verde.... which... was.... delicious! The flavor was fantastic! I was a little bit disheartened to see the size of the pork -- not that they were skimpy on the pork overall, just the size of the pieces seemed awfully tiny compared to other Pozoles I've had. I probably could have stopped there as I wasn't ravenous -- the Pozole was probably about a cup and a half. Not too big and not too small.   I ended up deciding I was hungry enough to get something else and tried their Tuna Ceviche Tostada.  The presentation was simple -- one corn tortilla, tostada style, secured on the plate by some guacamole (underneath) to prevent slipping around the plate during transport and topped with a Tuna ceviche that had a cilantro and serrano pesto with onions and jalapeno.  The bartender had warned me that it was spicy, but I guess I didn't get a very spicy jalapeno because I could have handled more heat.  On top of the well portioned ceviche was about a 1/4 avocado which was ripe and tasty.    Overall, I really enjoyed my meal with Canonita and will likely visit again sometime this week to try another dish as many of my bar neighbors seemed to have some delicious dishes in front of them.",

I got the Mexican torta. It seems like a lot of bread for the food inside, so I took it off the bread. There were tortilla Chips underneath it anyways. I do wish they offered this dish as an egg dish instead of a sandwich. I also wish that it came with two eggs. The inside of the sandwich was very tasty!   My boyfriend got the breakfast burrito. He said it was okay (I definitely chose the better dish!)   Service was fast but nothing special. It was a good meal, which is why I would rate it 3.5.",

The service was up and down. They changed waiters on us mid-stream and without notice. It was VERY slow to get a check and so forth, even though the place had pretty much emptied out.  Fortunately, the food was pretty good. They do have this annoying thing about trying to up-sell you on stuff. Like they charged for every little side you ask for.  The mushroom enchiladas were really good and the veggie fajitas (not explicitly on the menu) were decent. It was \"happy hour\" and we were tempted by the drinks deals which ended up not being very happy. Just a weak showing there.  Overall, not bad. We did get a really nice seat next to the canals of Venice. Gotta make the best of the fake world we were in.",

I mean, I'd go rockclimbing at the world famous Red Rock Canyon (20 miles outside of LV), but always stay away from the seedy strip, despite its glitz and glam exterior. That is, until I discovered Taqueria Canonita.   It was by force of circumstance that I was stuck in the Venetian, and being always hungry, I stumbled into the taqueria. Immediately, the place made this Texas girl feel right at home, the waiters and the chef were all hispanic and you can tell it was a tight knit group- like a little family. Everyone was incredibly nice, and their passion for food, and particularly Mexican food, showed.   My waiter, Ricardo, recommended a number of his favorite dishes, just like (or as the case may be, better than) his father would make, he said.  I settled on the tasty Sietes Mares, and was very impressed.  When I finally met up with my party, we came back (just 4 hours later) for a second dinner.   I specifically requested the same waiter, and he recommended more tasty options. My next dish (and arguably my last) was the Santa Rosa Barbacoa de Puerco. The pork was so fantastic, slow cooked so that it melts in your mouth when it hits your pallet, that I had a total food-gasm. The pork's complex, perfectly balanced flavors mixed with the cilantro rice, made me think I had died and gone to heaven.   In the span of just over a day, I ate there 4 times (including three servings of the Santa Rosa Barbacoa de Puerco). The staff was so amused by my reaction, that they gave me the recipe and the chef's e-mail address in case I ran into problems cooking it at home.   Of course, I've never actually done it 'cause it takes 48 hours, and I lack the patience. Still... fabulous food, fabulous service, and they have \"river side\" dining. I surprised myself by saying... \"it doesn't really get better than this.\"",

The drinks here are pretty good for happy hour and they have it from 4-6 and 9-close (I think those are the hours)  What keeps me coming back is the wonderful location has, and you can be asked to be seated along the water and watch tourists take the gondola ride!",

The decor/ambiance was pleasant.  I ordered the Chicken Caesar Salad for $15. The chicken was flavorless and chewy. I ate about a quarter of the chicken. I informed the waiter that the chicken was not very appetizing. I expected him to either offer another dish or to remove the item from my bill. He did neither.  I also had a Cadillac margarita for $12.50, which I thought was very good. My second drink I asked for the happy hour margarita for $5. I laughed when I got it, it's half the price, because it's literally half the size. Despite it's \"short\" comings, I thought that it was also very good.  In defense of the restaurant, all of my friends said they really enjoyed their meal and would come back. Maybe I just lucked out with my entree selection.  If you like expensive Mexican food, give it a try.",

Since the reception was small and casual, I had the opportunity to try their margaritas and a few appetizers/finger foods. Their margaritas, while potent, were a little bland, and the appetizers were over cooked,  flavorless, and uninspiring. The experience did not make me want to frequent the establishment again.",

I could just eat that alone and make a meal out of it.  It's a big whopping plate of mussels cooked in a ultra flavorful red broth.  Comes with toasted garlic herb bread too!  I realized by coming here why I didn't like mussels before.  It's because most places don't use fresh mussels.  This place does.  There is absolutely no fishiness at all.  Just sweet tasty morsels.  I know they use fresh mussels because on a recent trip there I wasn't able to order them because the supplier didn't have any that day.  The main course are ok.  Nothing to write home about.  Their Sangria is pretty good, it would be better if they didn't fill the little cup with so much ice.  This place is worth 4 stars just on the mussels alone :)",

    "text": "Absolutely one of the best Mexican restaurants I've ever visited. This place serves very creative and eclectic style Mexican food. Most dishes aren't what people would traditionally imagine. One of my favorite dishes is the wild mushroom enchiladas. They are super tender and come covered with a light green colored sauce. Very mellow flavors. They have a vegetarian torta with a thick slice of grilled tofu, and typically I'll only eat tofu if it's in miso soup. One of my absolute favorites is the pezcado veracruz. It's the 'catch of the day' in a marisco (red) sauce with rice. Imagine a fish stew, with a large cut of fish in the middle. The Vaquero beef rib is also excellent. It's a well prepared short rib in mildly spicy mashed potatoes. This restaurant is the ONLY restaurant in The Venetian that is located directly on the canal. Whenever we went, we always were seated directly next to the canal. The wait staff is always super friendly. Although the hostesses have often been unfriendly and will take forever to acknowledge your presence. Their drinks are pretty good. I recommend the sangria by the bottle. It's fairly inexpensive and very good. Not a bad way to pass an hour or so, sitting with your sangria at the canal. I think a lot of people are expecting a different style of food here. It's more of a gourmet style, with interesting interpretations. Don't expect a big sloppy wet burrito. For the amount and quality of food, I consider this place to be cheap. Entrees are around the $20 mark and they charge for chips and salsa. But the portions are generous (not gigantic) and the food and atmosphere are second to none. You would be hard pressed to find a better location than this, in Vegas. I highly recommend for a late breakfast/early lunch, when they open around 11a. It's also nice to eat at a place when I don't have to get dressed  up, seriously I am on vacation, don't make me wear something nice.",

I love the fact that it's right on the edge of the gondola river running throughout the Grand Canal Shoppes.  The end of the river is right at the restaurant so all the gondoliers would pause to serenade their riders and the crowd.  I think people at the restaurant should be given point cards so we can rate the singing.  It's sad, but some of the gondoliers shouldn't sing.  Others were so amazing that their voices echoed off the walls!!",

The most awesome part about dining here is the fact that you're eating delicious food and drinking bomb-azz sangria right next to the Grand Canal, serenaded by the gondola singers and getting that awesome water reflection off the roof and the lights surrounding the area.  I want to quote About.com's review on Taqueria Canonita (because this is exactly how I feel and couldn't describe it better): \"This inspired eatery takes the flavors of Old Mexico and serves them with an exciting, New American ambiance- all beside the gracefully flowing Grand Canal. Experience True \"south of the border\" taste and tradition with authentic Mexican offerings like chile rellenos, tacos al carbon or shrimp quesadillas. The taste of their hand-made corn tortillas alone is enough to transport you to another world. The dcor is as vivid as the menu with casual ambiance, high ceilings and bright, bold colors. Taqueria Caonita's lively exhibition kitchen is the restaurant's centerpiece. Enjoy your meal amidst the sculpted steel and wrought-iron gates, colorful Mexican tiles and authentic Mexican folk art. Even better, Taqueria Caonita's patio is set beside the Grand Canal, offering terrific views of our Venetian streetscapes and passing gondolas.\"  I would also like to add that 90% of the servers who work here are easy on the eyes and know what customer service is all about ;) which makes for an even better dining experience.",

The salsa did not have any kick to it. The meat in my tacos seemed as it had been cooked and then left in a heating device before it was served. The tortillas were at least fresh and fluffy.

    "text": "I have been to a lot of Mexican restaurants in Vegas and the rest of America but this place is up-scale.  Some real traditional Mexican cooking with good quality fresh ingredients.  You might have to listen to some tourists on the canal and some gondola captain singing, but the food is great.   Fresh flour tortillas, Pork Empanadas, with a fantastic red sauce.  Some of the best guacamole that wasn't all garlicy.  It was good and fresh.  Also had a fantastic vegy chile relleno with dried fruit, masa crust, wonderful roasted vegetables, rice and a great poblano sauce  and would be just fantastic if not for the goat cheese.  Why must I always have to eat goat cheese and butternutt squash in nice restaurants.  The salsa is a smoky variety with good chips and some fantastic queso or fundido.  This place has been around a long time and is really good.",

I have been here at least once for every visit that I have made to Las Vegas, to mark the completeness of my time spent in the desert :) I have brought several friends, and they are as pleased as I am. I remember my first time dining here, as someone at a nearby table attempted to order a chimichanga. The server said to me \"this is Mexican SOUL food! None of that Taco Bell stuff..\", and he was right. Everything here (from the fabulous choices of margarita, to the horchata and desserts), is SOOO finger-licking good. After one visit, I had finally had enough of being without my favorite horchata, and asked the chef for a recipe. Not only did he write it down for me, but he emailed it to me as well! As I'm writing this review, my mouth is watering..but I know that nothing in Seattle will compare to this food.",

    "text": "After getting in mid Saturday afternoon we were hungry for Mexican food. Walking into the Venetian and scanning the canal we settled on Taqueria Canonita. We were seated quickly right at the canal with a great view of everyone on their Gondolas.   Everything on the menu looked good and so did all the plates we saw. We did choose to get their $29.99 app, entree, and dessert. Good value there. Salads were big and very fresh, the tortilla-esque  soup had good kick to it, enchiladas were perfect, and the desserts were perfectly portioned and tasty.  Drinks were actually pretty well priced for Vegas...obviously not considering all the free ones you can get on the casino floor. Mojitos are good and well sized for $9 and their sangrias, especially the white, are top notch.  Great casual restaurant but nothing in paticular stood out to me to make it a 5 star. Great casual place to stop for a walking break and snack.   Spend-o-meter: We spent $80 with drinks but really the 2 full 3 course meals were $29ea. Value: If you pass on alcohol than it's a great value...alcohol probably takes it just outside of good value.  Will I go back: Yes...too many good looking dishes I wanted to try. Their salsas and guac seem to make a good impression on everyone.  Definately visit Taqueria Canonita at the Venetian...you'll be glad you did.",

As many other reviewers commented, if you go, it can be nice to sit in the fake \"outside\" by the canal.  And my meal started in a pleasant enough fashion, with the previously-mentioned good margarita and chips and salsa.  But everything fell apart when my entree came out.  Chicken enchiladas are pretty difficult to screw up, but they somehow found a way to do so.  This was the most bland Mexican food I ever tasted in my life.  Diner meatloaf in southern Indiana is more interesting.  The black beans tasted like water.  I'm not joking.  Water.  The \"cilantro rice\" tasted like it just came out of the boil-in-a-bag.  The \"queso fresco\" on top of the enchiladas certainly didn't taste like any kind of real cheese.  And the enchiladas themselves were skimpy on the chicken and heavy on the lettuce (a clear cost-saving measure).  Oh, and yes, the chicken also didn't even taste like anything.   And of course, if you just want the 'rita, save yourself having to tip your sever and get your drink in the food court location of this restaurant that's steps away from the location by the \"canal\".",

    "text": "In order to fairly review Taqueria Canonita, I have to tell a story to that will highlight our interesting, but wonderful experience. Here goes:  I was dining here with 2 friends and their mother. We were craving for Mexican food and decided to give Taqueria Canonita a try in the Venetian Canal Shoppes. We were greeted and only waited for about 3-5 minutes, which was remarkable given that this was on Sunday afternoon on a holiday weekend. The place was plenty big and had very pleasant seating right on the canal as well as inside. We eventually found a table right on the canal and it really felt like we were seated outdoors. Anyway, our waiter was a very kind and professional gentleman. He immediately offered to bring us some drinks and chips/salsa. So, to fast forward a bit, here's the INTERESTING part. My friend's mother (who is 65 years old) accidentally knocked over her glass of sangria. Some of the sangria happened to splash on some European tourists sitting right behind her. We jumped in immediately and offered help clean up the mess, and we apologized for the incident. My friend's mother felt just terrible! It was obviously purely an accident by an old lady who is on the verge of losing her senses. However, the European tourists were completely and totally unforgiving and ruthless towards us. I believe they were from Yugoslavia, Croatia, France, or maybe Russia (I'm going to be careful here), but they were definitely European of some sort. Immediately the European woman at the opposing table accused my friend's mother (who can't speak or understand English may I add) in a scornful and direct manor. She bluntly told us (pointing finger), \"You have to pay for that! That's my son's new t-shirt!\"  Next, the wait staff rushed out and cleaned up the mess. Our waiter told us to just relax and not let it ruin our day. The waiter brought out my friend's mother a replacement glass of sangria and assured us that the restaurant will take care of any cleaning expenses for the shirt, because \"accidents happen.\" He was a gentleman about it. Meanwhile, at the opposing table, the European tourists were throwing a hissy fit towards the restaurant manager and wait staff, demanding that they pay for the shirt and waive the bill that \"they\" (we) caused. The manager patiently listened to the demands and offered to pay for the cleaning expenses. That wasn't enough, however. They wanted the reimbursement of a brand new shirt (which looked like just a plain white t-shirt may I add) as well as to waive the bill. It seemed to me that they were taking advantage of the situation. The European woman then pointed her finger at my friend and told her to come over, and once again she asked us how we were going to pay for the shirt and/or cleaning expenses. At this point, all of us are pretty much in shock and awe, and we all just completely lost our appetite. Eventually, the European tourists and the manager came to a compromise and gave them one half off the bill and they offered to pay for the cleaning expenses for the t-shirt. Obviously the European tourists believed this compromise was unreasonable and they were not happy about it at all. Why he (the manager) didn't give into their full demands, his reasoning was once again, \"Accidents happen.\"  As the European tourists were leaving their tables, the woman confronted our table and said in a snobby way, \"If the restaurant wants us to pay for our entire bill, then you pay for it!\"  She walked off before my friend got the chance to say anything back. Apparently they walked away from the table without paying for any of the bill, even after the deduction.  Before I conclude, I'd like to make a note that the food was truly excellent and even if the incident didn't happen, I would still rant and rave about the service I received. Oh yeah, did I mention the food here is excellent?  Why do I go through this long story? Because it highlights not only wonderful customer service, but also human understanding. The wait staff and management at Taqueria Canonita clearly went above and beyond expectations towards their customers. They were extremely accommodating and did everything in their power to make a rigid situation smooth, in spite of some bitchy customers... and they did it like gentlemen. We ended up giving them a $50 tip on a $90 dollar bill.  Thank you, Taqueria Canonita, for truly exceeding expectations and delivering outstanding customer service.",

The only thing tasty were the fresh, warm tortilla chips and salsa.  The guacamole was alright, though it was very onion-y.  (I detest onions, on a personal note.)  I ordered the grilled mushroom tacos.  They were awful!  The mushrooms were over-cooked and rubbery.  The queso on the tacos was bland and tasteless.  The tortilla for the tacos themselves was bland as well.  The colleague beside me ordered chicken tacos and complained as well that it was tasteless and inedible.  Neither of us ate more than the first half of one taco (though the platter comes with three).  I heard the Sangria was good from colleagues on the other side of the table.  My boyfriend also enjoyed his pollo con mole, though he said that the chicken was unbearably dry after a few bites.  Such a waste of food!  It really pains me to waste anything, especially food.  So if that sort of thing pains you too, I suggest eating somewhere else.  The service was also slow, curt and overall rather grumpy.  I guess I'd be grumpy too if I worked here and served up this yuckiness.",

If you're lucky, you can maybe get a seat by the canal and watch them float by while you're eating.  I thought it was very reasonable compared to what other vegas places charge.",

The tres tacos are also good in that you can select between various meats or veggie varieties. The house margarita was not very good so I would recommend sticking with the Patron margarita. On one occasion, the waiter was not very accommodating however the manager was able to help out. The atmosphere is very nice over looking the canal. I don't recall eating a better Mexican meal anywhere else in Vegas.",

We started with delicious agave margaritas which were delicious bit pricey.  We shared the empanadas (good) and flautas (spectacular).  I had the beef rib and polenta which was rich and delicious.  The huge chunks of tomato on top were off putting and marinated in something that made them too acidic.  My man child had chorizo appetizer for his meal which was incredible.  Our other dining companion had the carne Asada which he enjoyed thourghly.  5 stars for service which was helpful with recommendations and kept my water full which is important in a desert!",

The lights, the constant bombardment of second-hand smoke, the noise - I just don't like it.  I do, however, make a couple of trips a year to LV for business. This past trip my team and I worked out of the Venitian and had a very full schedule. As such, we had no time to get \"off the beaten track\" to find good-eats in Vegas.  The one meal we had that is worthy of a post is the Taqueria Canonita. The food is not great - but very good. The staff are wonderful. These was a wonderful person who helped us find our way around the menu. We had a working lunch and the server was so gracious in allowing us to linger and talk.  If you are ever \"stranded\" on the Las Vegas strip - this is a place that will \"tick the box\" of the food experience . . . and not set you back too much cash.",

Her leadership was impressive. She greeted my colleagues and I with a great smile and attitude.  We were a party of 5 and while she was trying to get someone to do it nobody did it, so she said give me a minute let me set up your table. The hostess had it ready in no time. She got the menus, explained it to us as well as the happy hour menu and gave us a few suggestions on dishes. She always had a smile on, even when it was really busy.   We decided to go again the next day and the hostess was there again.  We requested the same table and she set it up for us and welcomed us back. Even though we took up the table for quite a while. Will definitely be back again!",

They were really enjoyable. The only item I missed was cheddar cheese. I never understand why some reataurants don't include cheese with fajitas but they were still great. It came with yummy guacamole and rice and beans. My friend had I think a shrimp burrito. She loved it! It was huge!  I also had a margarita with Grand Marnier. It was one of the best I have ever had.   Our server was very nice but I had to repeatedly ask for simple things like ice. It was annoying. He also never asked how we were enjoying our meal.  It was a delicious meal and would have loved the chance to go back during my stay at the hotel. Prices were reasonable as well. Definitely recommend it!! I would have given it a 4.5 if I could have....and even higher if service was better.",

Ambience was great what with the gondolas going by with their magnificent serenades.   Food came after a short 10 to 15min wait. Ordered the chicken quesadilla, good sized portion. Tasted great.  My partner had the mahi mahi, fish was cooked to perfection, not overcooked. Rice was not soggy despite being in the broth.   Service staff warmed up through dinner. Initial welcome was a tad curt and tight faced, but it all went well specially when the restaurant manager went on his rounds. :-)   Affordable, mid-priced restaurant found quaintly im the venetian!",

When I asked the waiter which was better of the choices I was looking at, he jumped on the pork with such conviction that I was really looking forward to it. What I got was pretty close to Texas style BBQ pulled pork. It was ok, but I am not a BBQ pulled pork fan and I was really hoping for something more like carnitas. Judging from everyone's dishes, it looks like the theme is the same...severely Americanized Mexican food.",

I've had it many times before from Salvadorans that made it from scratch at home so I get pretty picky. Here, the sauce is amazing and so is the stuffing. I didn't pick this dish but I think it was the best one in the group. If I come back here, this is what I'd get, hands down.  I got the Seared Ahi dish but it was not that great. It was ok, but the sauce was more thick and curry like rather than light and delicate.   The chips and salsa were amazing. Fresh hot chips and the salsa was just spicy enough.   The margaritas are ok, nothing great, but it wasn't bad. We got the pitcher, which is cheaper than buying individual drinks. We got the strawberry blended margarita and the pineapple margarita on the rocks. The strawberry is better.   The dishes are quite pricey but the appetizers and tacos were decently priced.",

When you first get there, they ask you if you want a table \"outside\" or \"inside\" which is funny because its actually all the same, but if you want the fake clouds and view of the gondolas going by, say \"outside\". The ambiance is perfect for either an intimate date, but its also ideal for large groups because of their huge tables. We had a group of 12 and were seated on Saturday afternoon within minutes.   The make-your-own Bloody Mary station ended up confusing my friends with all the options...one of them basically ended up with an entire salad in her drink, since the vegetables were unlimited. But hey, if you like blue-cheese stuffed olives and green beans galore, you will be happy!   If you're vegan, the options here are a bit limited. The rice has butter, but you can ask for the seasoned potatoes which were really good! The manager specifically came out to deliver the item to assure everything was okay with everyone's specific dietary restrictions.   I got the breakfast burrito which is served with a little salsa on top and one chip. LITERALLY ONE CHIP. I guess they did it to make it look pretty, but it was a very interesting sight. I love that the cheese was melted onto the entire surface of the tortilla instead of being thrown in the middle and disregarded...it was almost like a quesadilla-turned-burrito. Maybe I'll order a separate side of chips next time I come, so I'm not disappointed by the one lonely chip accompanying my burrito. Overall a good experience though!",

We found Canonita near the Canal Shoppes and were quickly seated \"outside\" and had a cute view of the canal.   We enjoyed some margaritas along with tortilla chips, salsa, and guacamole. I had the pomegranate margarita and it was decent, I would have had another, but the early hour and the $12 price tag kept me in check.   For a meal I ordered the beef flautas, they were decent, but more appropriately described as taquitos, as they were made of corn vs flour tortillas. They were topped with green sauce, cheese and pico de gallo.  The food and view were decent, not great enough to pull us in for a second visit.",

Chips were standard out of a bag probably, but the salsa was good with some roasted pepper in there.  UPDATE: Despite not being a featured happy hour drink, I ordered the jalapeno-infused margarita. MUCH better, the ingredients seem fresher (the Classic was too syrupy). The jalapeno-infused has fresh orange and cilantro in it for an interesting twist.",

We had a few questions about the food and the manager came very quickly and was very thorough!! I usually love trying new restaurants in LV but this has earned a second & probably third visit. Try the Carne Asada Nortena (the side tamale was basically the best tamale I've ever had ..and that's coming from someone who lives in LA and not huge fan of them).",

I love tres leches cake and I know how to make a very good one and this one was kind of dry and not as spongy as it should be.   The best part about this place is happy hour. Margaritas are $5 and well drinks are $3. That's great for Vegas prices! Also, the location of this place is cool--right by the cannel.   In other words, come for happy hour.",

I was in town for the Vegas marathon and on an extremely tight schedule between flying in, checking into the Venetian, getting to the Expo and trying to grab a tasty dinner before heading to the Mirage to see \"Love\". I honestly thought, trying to fit in a sit down dinner at a decent restaurant with less than an hour would be insane. I made a reservation on line via open table days in advance and when I finally found Taqueria Canonita in the canals - there seemed to be a wait , by the time it was my turn in line I was seated immediately. I ordered guac, salsa and chips right away and a pomegranate margie. The guac and salsa were delicious! I ordered the Barbocoa by suggestion of my server and within a few minutes my plate was on the table. I understand the black beans, and cilantro rice are probably already made and I think the server said this pork is cooked for 4 hours... I'd only had a few sips of my margarita before ordering but can't recall, anyhow my plate was out SO fast. I literally thought, was this just sitting pre made in the kitchen already. It was very tasty and came with nice warm corn tortillas. I ate as much as I could and put the salsa over the rice - SO good! I wish I could have finished it all. Service was great. I would definitely return. Bill $43 before tip",

It was perfectly adequate but nothing special.  I ordered the chicken burrito, which I assumed would be much like most standard burritos.  What I failed to discern were the words \"barbecue sauce\" in the description.  And yes, it was absolutely smothered in KC Masterpiece.   To me, this was totally inedible.   Fortunately my daughter's fajitas came with extra corn tortillas, so I could cobble together something salvageable with the innards of the BBQ burrito.

The dinner is $18 per person and there is TONS of food. The Carne is always cooked to perfection. Oh order flour tortillas instead of corn they are more homemade-ish. The atmosphere is nice as you are right along the canal and get to see all the gondolas. Check this one out if you are in the mood for Mexican Food!!!",

After a shitty experience at RA, my husband and I continue on our food frenzy (it's amazing how much he can eat and still be thin) and hit up Canonita.    We first sit at the bar to let the sushi digest and then order a couple drinks:  -Raspberry mojito, I love that my husband has no shame and says proudly that mojitos are his fave drink -Sangria margarita, just skip this drink it was disgusting, I don't even want to get into the grueling details  We asked for chips and salsa and find out later that it's $2 for the first batch and $1.00 for each chip refill and $.50 for salsa refills. WTF, that's why I docked a point.   We sit down at the table and order the chile relleno and the mushroom enchiladas.   No joke, this is one of the best non-traditional chile rellenos I have ever had.  It had goat cheese, nuts and dried fruits inside the pepper and then it was breaded and flash fried.  My mouth is watering just thinking about it.   The mushroom enchiladas were equally amazing, they had a green creamy sauce on top.    No wonder my diet is sucking.",

We were seated \"outside\" under the Venetian's ceiling next to their version of the Grand Canal. It's a great place for people watching - you can see the gondolas row by and hear the gondoliers singing.  The focus is on food from Mexico City. The queso fundido appetizer was excellent, as was the Mexican sandwich (torta). The pitchers of margaritas are generous.   The service was great and the waiter clearly adjusted when we made it clear we wanted to linger over our margaritas.",

    "text": "I am upgrading my original review to 4 stars because of the exceptional, GM at Canonita. Annaliza reached out to me after learning of my experience dining at the restaurant. I was very impressed by her genuine concern over the issues I had experienced while dining there and her overall commitment and enthusiasm for the restaurant, as well as her assurance in setting the highest standards of service. She changed my views and opinions of the restaurant for the better. I'm just very pleased with how she directly dealt with the problem herself, as well as her high level of professionalism, which she maintained throughout. I wish more managers possessed the same integrity and passion for their business and genuine care and concern for clients as Annaliza does. There is a great deal of assurance in knowing that a highly respectable and hard-working person is managing a business. Should something fall short or anything be less than perfect, I believe that Annaliza will take up the task herself and resolve the issue immediately, as she has done so with me. That is just the type of person she is. How she runs the restaurant is very reassuring to a customer such as myself because she seems to listen and truly values and respects the views and experience of all dining guests. It is something I both appreciate and admire about this manager. I am certain that she lets nothing slip by because of the way in which she oversaw and personally handled my issue. It leaves me to wonder how I had an issue in the first place, as Annaliza seems very involved in ensuring that every aspect of the business runs smoothly. I am glad that such a caring, dedicated, and competent person is the one behind all operations at Canonita. She has proven to be an effective GM and is quick to act against problems and resolves all issues almost immediately. I am convinced that she and her team work hard and tirelessly on all trajectories in order to make the restaurant what it is and are very eager to please their patrons and meet the expectations of every customer. I can also now say with a certain level of confidence, that Canonita is a fine restaurant under the good care of a manager who genuinely values each one of her customers and who carries a deep respect for her business. She has certainly earned my appreciation and respect. I felt it appropriate to express my gratitude in the same professional and caring manner that Annaliza had shown me. I only hope that this amended review matches up to the degree of respect and kindness with which she had extended to me. I now have a very different and positive impression of the restaurant and would love to dine there again on my next stay at the resort. She has turned my entire experience around for the better. It still astounds me that a GM would go to such lengths to ensure that all guests receive excellent service and treatment. I have never had anyone write such a thoughtful letter to me. It was rare. That was the first time I've had a manger follow up with me, and it just shows how much she cares about the guests, and I truly respect her for that. I will now leave as a happy patron and this restaurant has definitely gained my support again and any future business.",

    "text": "As a local, I rarely make it to the strip. We went to the Venetian to see the Blue Man Group (tewtelly awesome, btw!) and we had to eat first. Not wanting to spend an arm and leg for the lamb brains served at Mario Batali's (ew!) we decided to go to Taqueria Canonita instead.  I see this as a sort of fusion restaurant - mixing Mexican traditions with  European and American cooking techniques to make something that is new and affordable while still being special. It made me think of what might be eaten in Mexico City for  a normal (and maybe a bit bourgeois) night out. Instead of covering everything in greasy cheeses and diced tomatoes, the Taqueria Canonita emphasizes different tastes of Mexican cuisine put together in unique ways.  We had: Queso Fundido con Raja - a favorite of ours, we always get it at Lindo Michoacan. The tortillas were handmade and divine. The cheese was top-notch, but not too stringy.  Enselada de Cangrejo - salad with lump blue crab meat and a creamy jalapeno dressing. Honestly, what's not to like?  Michoacan Pork Chop - Wow! Just... wow. The pork chop was juicy, tender, and delicious. The reduction over the mushroom hominy (polenta/grits) was magical.   Tequila - served in a beautiful glass and a full selection of blancos, repasados and anejos.   Mojito - admittedly, not a Mexican drink. But I don't care. It rocked my socks.  Also, the service was excellent and very friendly. We sat on the \"patio\" which gave us a nice view of the \"canal\" and the singing gondola folks.",

    "text": "I went to Taqueria Canonita with a large group.  In our party was a 50-year-old, white southerner who, we later find out, eats nothing but meat and potatoes.  And has truly never had Mexican food.  It was hilarious watching this extremely polite man's reactions as we tried to explain what a burrito is or why anyone would slow-roast pork on a banana leaf.  He eventually settled on three soft tacos with rice but was perplexed with the color of the restaurant's cilantro rice.  \"Now, I hope you don't mind me asking but is green a normal color for rice?\"  I really liked Taqueria Canonita.  I tried the Pepita Crab Cakes and the Smoked Chicken Quesadilla as appetizers.  Both were very flavorful.  I was actually surprised with the crab cakes because I usually compare them against those found in New England.  They were solid, especially given that we were sitting in the middle of the desert.  The chips were just okay but the salsa was good.  And the guacamole was excellent and they give you a ton of it.  For my entree, I ordered the Mexico City Chicken Enchiladas.  It was good but nothing spectacular.  I had a couple margaritas and they were okay.  Nothing to write home about either but it did its job.  The inside of the restaurant had a really fresh, hip vibe.  We sat on the patio, under the Venetian's stars and next to the canal.  After the second drink, I almost forgot that I was inside of a mall.  For a place that serves green rice, this place was definitely able to please the crowd.",

Our server Danielle was wonderful; she made sure to check in with us a lot, she was I eat about what was vega and what was not, and she was fun.

Throw in a 21 year old and you have to be able to adjust. As she slept in, our breakfast buffet plans went out the window..like Doug's mattress.   So, down the strip we went in search of a place for a late breakfast. She had never been in the Venetian and as she stared wide eyed at the tables next to the indoor canal, she said, \"At some point I want to eat here.\" I took a quick look at the menu & they serve breakfast until 11:30am.  We were seated immediately, right on the water. It was so lovely to watch the gondolas pass throughout the meal. This restaurant is in a prime location, right where the boats stop for a brief serenade. We heard numerous versions, from the traditional to the light hearted for the kids.   Now for the food. I am still thinking about my plate here. I have searched high & wide for an excellent Huevos Rancheros and Canonita truly delivered. The rice was light, pillowy, fresh and full of that deep stock flavor that a good Mexican rice deserves. The beans were also fresh, seasoned perfectly, and had a hearty texture. Each side of the plate featured a sauce, red to the right and green to the left. The red sauce was slightly sweet and complimented everything on the plate. The green sauce had just the right kick to make your tastebuds sing. Both were complimented with a perfectly cooked, over easy egg and luscious jack cheese.   Service was wonderful and the prices were great, especially considering the ambiance. The whole experience was truly 5 star.",

Besides the amazing service, another thing that gives this place the advantage of being 5 stars, is simply the Location and view of the whole place, in the Venetian Next to the water & gondola, with italian Fences, and an adorable flower on the table. This place gives you an amazing feel under the Beautiful Fake sky that makes Las Vegas so amazing!   My drink was amazing, & the food was excellent! This is Mexican food by the way, served in a very fancy way. I loved that they have flan. Yummyyy!!  I will defenetly come here again forshure. I recommend canonitas to everyone. Its a MUST come if youre out here in Las Vegas.",

I love that it's located next to the canal so you can watch the gondolas float by.   Our reservations were for 10:15 PM but it was nice that they were able to seat us earlier. At that time of night Canonita was only half full so we got a prime table on the water. This is a great photo spot by the way!  I ordered the Tres tacos with a beef filling and my husband got a chicken quasadilla. I expected ground beef in the tacos but the meat was actually in the form of small cubes in a tasty sauce so I loved the tacos! You also get this delicious rice and black beans. My plate was spotless when I had finished! It's just the right amount of food. They also have a great happy hour that we were able to take advantage of when picking drinks. All in all, I loved this place, and would definitely come back to get some good Mexican food.",

    "text": "I've honestly had better- Javiers, El Dorado Cantina, El Sombrero, Tacos El Gordo and even El Segundo Sol (on a good day) all come to mind. Canonita describes itself as Mexican soul food and I just didnt taste it. Whenever I try a place for the first time I like to stick with the basics- if a Mexican restaurant can impress me with great tasting tacos then I'll venture out and try the mole, sopes and enchiladas. Well they didn't impress me with the Tres Tacos. I think when the server told me they came with salsa already on them I knew something was amiss. I asked for the salsa on the side because often times the salsa will hide the flavor of the whole taco and to be honest I've never had a taco come with salsa on it. Thats like covering a flat iron steak in A1.    The entree arrived with 3 tacos and one hot, dried out lime, rice, beans and salsas on the side and to my surprise the cilantro and red onions were on the side as well! Yes, red onions on a taco. The beans were awful- lacked flavor and were hard. The cilantro rice was good but seemed like a waste to even bother eating it. The chicken taco was dry- dear god- was it a dry taco. The corn tortillas are made in house, but I'd never had a tortilla like that. It had the sturdiness and dryness of a corn tortilla and the softness of a flour tortilla. My mouth was perplexed. The carne asada taco was just as dry, but their saving grace was the pork taco. Its hard to find dry pork so they get a pass on that one. I expected more flavors for a $4 dollar taco at such a nice restaurant.   The margarita was good but short on ice and a bit too sweet and I drink the same margarita everywhere I go- on the rocks, no salt. Perhaps that's just personal preference. In closing, I'll never understand how a server disappears when it comes time to present a check, pick up the check and return with the change. This place was no different but I wasn't on a schedule so I was fine waiting and waiting and waiting.   Would I venture into Canonita again? Perhaps not.",

You pay five dollars for weird salsa and chips.  The chips are fresh - but the salsa is weird smoked garbage.  Our waiter - OMG - he was so annoyed that we didn't order the second he came over - 30 seconds after we sat down.  He approached again 1 minute later, and again two minutes later.  Hubby almost lost it.  I had \"fish tacos\" - tilapia - and two pounds of red onion.  Nothing else, just bland fish and chopped red onion in little soggy tortillas.  No slaw.  No crema.  No sauce.  So bad.  I grabbed a fork and just ate the fish - left the rest on the plate.  GROSS.  My hubby had the Pork Carnitas plate - three chunks of meat on some lame white rice.    The bill - a cool 100.00 for crap.  Again, nice location, but the food is better at Taco Bell.  And seriously - what decent Mexican place makes you pay for chips and salsa.  Just pass on this and go over the Mandalay and eat at Hussong's.  (Hussong's was soooo good!)",

They did not have a couple of the wine we wanted to order, and the food was just ok. I did not find them to be of great quality and though we did not order alot, the bill was more than it deserved to be. I did notice that during the day time they had street tacos available, so I would recommend doing, or just getting drinks.

(I mean the fake canal, but hey, you're in Las Vegas, this is what you've come to expect.) They have decent vegetarian options including enchiladas, mushroom and tacos, and their rice and beans are vegetarian.  They also have Mojito and Margarita flights available (and who doesn't love a flight of anything?!)  I had the Wild Mushroom Enchiladas. This was a great dish served with three enchiladas. This was a bit more creamy than \"enchilada saucy\" but was very filling. The white rice with peas and corn it was served with was light and delicious...as were the \"special\" kidney beans that were mixed with corn and were just very good.  They offer chips and salsa for $5. I maintain that if you are at a Mexican restaurant, it is your god-given right to have chips and salsa automatically provided as part of the experience so I balk a bit at having to pay for them separately...and in this case I wish we hadn't...the chips were a little too thick and were not evenly salted. The salsa they came with was good though.  As I mentioned, it's right on the canal so the atmosphere was nice (though you have to be a party of 2 to sit at one of the tables next to the water.)",

    "text": "Mexican \"Soul Food\" in the heart of the Italian Venetian's Grand Canal Shoppes? Sounds pretentious and I had my doubts. I was surprised! Don't judge a restaurant necessarily by its location.   Chips, guacamole and salsa were pretty standard, and freshly made instead of broken, bagged chips would've made a big difference.  Canonita's menu includes Americanized, non-threatening Mexican fare; however, it also lists inspiring and unique takes on Platos Fuertes traditional regional dishes such as:  *Santa Rosa Barbacoa - Guajillo chile-ribbed pork wrapped in banana leaf;  *Vaquero Beer-braised Short Rib - Negra Modelo, mushroom hominy, spiced tobacco onions, pasilla Oaxaca chile reduction;  *Pollo Mole Poblano - (unfortunately named) Airline chicken breast;  *Seared Cabo Ahi Tuna - Padilla Oaxaca chile cream sauce, papas bravas, smoked tomato-roasted serrano aioli. I chose this dish mainly due to college memories of deep sea fishing in Cabo San Lucas, catching and eating the freshest Ahi tuna I ever had, in many different ways including as sashimi.  I questioned the waiter about how much it was seared and didn't want it over-cooked. He assured me it would be great. And he was right, an excellent sear on fresh, very rare Ahi and generous portions. The sauce was awesome! It earned 5 stars for taking me right back to Cabo, and was the highlight meal of my trip.  Service was constant, personable and friendly. There was no rush felt to turn over the table. In the frenzy of the mall, we were able to relax, enjoy Margaritas, and taste a bit of delicious Mexican soul food in the middle of \"Italy\"!",

The filling was tasty but the green sauce took the dish to another level.  I was not a fan of the rice and beans because the beans had a bite to them which I don't like in my beans.  I'm also more of a refried beans type of gal. The other dish ordered was the Veracruz mahi mahi, WOW!!!! The presentation was beautiful and that sauce, veggies, and fish was exquisite.  Try their homemade hot sauce,  I really enjoyed it. The customer service was grade A.  Our waitress checked on us appropriately and our drink were refilled constantly.",

We ordered the happy hour drink specials margaritas. Appetizer we got the lump crab and shrimp cake and for entree the tacos. The tacos came out fairly fast, but we still haven't gotten our appetizer nor drinks. Waiter was hard to come by to address. Finally, he was able to bring them out and said he upgraded our drinks to a large, which looked regular size to me. Once we were done with our meals again, waiter was nowhere to be found. Handed us the wrong check and laughed about it.   Overall, very poor service. Food is decent. Would not recommend.",

We had the guacamole and queso fundido and both were amazing - very fresh and great flavors! I would highly recommend them both. I had the short rib quesadillas and they were just okay. I expected the short rib to be shredded and it was more like grisly pieces of short rib. I loved the black beans that came with it. If you are looking for something spicy to accommodate your entree or chips, get the hot green salsa. It was extremely spicy so start off slow. My colleagues had the crab salad - the avocado croutons are to die for, the cazuela de mariscos and the fajitas and they all said their entrees were good. The guys had some issues with the tortillas falling apart but other than that everything was great!   Service was a little slow but he was friendly and knowledgeable. Can't beat the prices for Vegas!! We sat on the patio and it was a great view of the gondola rides.",

As I was about to pay, I asked for a cup of water in which the guy told me I have to buy a bottle because the company doesn't want to give a plastic cup for free. I then proceeded to tell him I was just there yesterday and the lady gave me the water no questions asked. He then told me not today and basically rudely implying I should buy a bottle and not be so cheap. At this point I asked to speak to a manager and the manager agreed with me that he should have given me a cup with no problem. I left because there is no way I was going to let this guy touch my food knowing he is capable of doing something to my food like SPITTING IN IT! I will never give this place any business again and will tell all my industry people that this is how they run their business.",

We sought this restaurant out on a recent visit to Vegas because we both remembered it fondly from independent visits to Vegas years ago. It continues to be a nice, mid-priced option for good food and fun atmosphere. You aren't dining in Vegas's finest here, but you also aren't paying for that. It's in the mall part of The Venetian. Think of it as an excellent, mid-priced lunch option as you move about the strip. The restaurant juts into the canal that the gondoliers come down. A major 'stop and sing' point for them is right where you dine, separated by just a railing over the water. The chicken mole was amazing according to my husband. My slow-roasted pork (in a banana leaf) was ok. The speciality drinks were good. I really enjoyed the pina, served in a coconut, but felt it was a small amount of liquid in the actual drink.",

Probably the best guacamole I've had at any other restaurant, (still not as good as momma's homemad guac though lol). I got the Tuna tartar which was yummy, but a little too much tuna lol which is nothing to complain about. My friends all had different dishes and they all enjoyed it, so no complaints on the food. The margarita's weren't amazing but still not bad. Would I come here again if I were in Vegas? probably not, but I did enjoy my time here. Also, the service was wonderful as well.",

We always get the 3 taco plate, which I guess is as close to a \"bargain\" as you can get on the strip.  My favorites are fish and pork, with the pork having a very good pineapple salsa.  The queso fundido has been an appetizer we go back to several times over.  The chorizo is a good addition, but can be greasy, so be advised.  Also, the cheese hardens fairly quickly, so this is an appetizer I wouldn't linger over.  Standard Mexican beer selection and some margarita choices.  It's a fun way to not lose your shirt on dinner on the strip.",

    "text": "I remember this place fondly because of the tasty mojitos they offer.   Oh what a difference 3 years make.  I was looking at the menu online and it seemed like a good idea to revisit this place since the entrees are between $14 - $23, which is affordable for a place located in the Venetian. The drinks were WEAK (we ordered a carafe of white sangria and two mojitos), seriously when I'm in Vegas, I want to be at least tipsy! (if not passed out!)  My pork al pastor with pineapple salsa was salty and dry. Same thing with my sis' chicken quesadilla. My bros said their burritos were okay, but then again, those two will eat anything. (yup. they don't Yelp either!) On the other hand, the cilantro rice was actually pretty good.   Oh, did you know that this place charges $2 for chips n salsa?!? That's a crime -- even for a Mexican restaurant on the strip! What's even worse is, there's an additional 50 cents charge for refills!   The service. Holy effin guacamole.  I couldn't tell you how BAD it was. (okay, you insist so let me tell you) Let me start by saying, my sis and I both used to work in the restaurant business. My bros still work in the food industry.  Bad service means less than 15% tip or no tip at all. Our server does NOT deserve the automatic 18% charge on our bill (we were a party of 6).  We waited awhile for our dishes to come out, we had to keep asking for water refills, napkins, utensils and it took FOREVER to get the check.    Canonita, get your act together! the only decent part of this experience was the nice ambiance sitting next to the grand canal. Kudos to the smiling hostess as well. I know parting is SUCH sweet sorrow....  NOT.",

Eating here is quite mind boggling when you consider that the whole atmosphere is a sham. No, you're not in Venice. And no, you're not outside. It really doesn't matter when you're sipping a delicious strawberry margarita and watching the gondolas float by. No matter how odd it may be, everything just works together to give you an interesting, if not wonderful, eating experience.  The sangria's and margarita's are great, the service is good, and the food passes in my book. The chips and salsa are delicious. I definitely suggest getting some guacamole to accompany your crunchy treat. The soups and taquito's were also yummy. I got a chicken ceasar salad as my main course, and unfortunately, I wasn't too impressed. Let's just say I've had better. Aside from that, I really enjoyed my experience at Canonita's and wouldn't mind giving it another shot in the future.",

The sweet chipotle BBQ sauce perfectly complimented the Barbacoa. I didn't care much for the cilantro rice and bean though, but the meat was more than enough to satisfy my appetite.

First off, it was quite confusing to get here, we asked for directions several times, since the path from Palazzo to Venetian is a bit of a maze. But once we walked into this beautiful fake piazza looking area, with bridges and gondolas we were in awe.   We wished we could have sat right next to the canal at this place but they reserve the canal view for tables for two. We were still able to enjoy the \"fake\" sights \"outside\". We ordered a pitcher of margaritas that our waiter had recommended which had Grand Manier, and boy was that strong!   We each got the taco platter which comes with three tacos you can choose from (you can mix and matches them too), and also comes with cillantro rice and beans.   I got the pork, beef and fish tacos. The pork was a bit dry, but the mango salsa on top was to die for! The beef tacos were my favorite- moist and flavorful. The fish ones had the mango salsa as well and were also very good. You could also choose the kind of tortilla, but unfortunately, I don't think they serve hard shell tacos which I personally love.  Their tomato salsa was also very delicious (and cheap) so I would recommend putting in an order of those. The waitstaff was friendly and helpful for the most part, though they were reluctant to allow us to charge our bill on 6 credit cards even though we were splittling the bill evenly. Eventually the informed us they would accomodate our request \"just this once\", but that it might take them a while to do so.",

It didn't seem fresh at all and I have had some killer ceviche (at La Mer in San Fran) and made ceviche with Iron Chef Jose Garces. Yes, I actually MADE shrimp ceviche with an Iron Chef but that's a story for another day or one you can read on my blog. :) The quacamole and chips and salsa were tasty. The chicken flautas were good. I still love flautas from Chevy's (they are just yummy unauthentic goodness) so I compare theirs to everyone. The view of the canal is what really sells this place. We had great seats to listen to the gondola singers--their voices are amazing. I do not know how they sing all day. Ok, I digress, Taqueria Canonita was good for the Happy Hour and ok for food.

It was a crap load of food but after a long day of traveling and walking, it hit the spot.  I was with a group and we had a plethora of margaritas and tequila shots (a few on the house) and our waiter brought us some pineapple slices soaked in tequila that were also on the house and pretty much knocked everyone on their ass.

Service was prompt - we were seated immediately, by friendly employees. The waiter was very attentive - was proactive about bringing us water after I had finished my first round of drinks - a very nice plus. Drinks were fine - nothing special, and on the weaker side, but still good. Waiter asked us multiple time whether we wanted to put in food, which, being from New York felt a little pushy, but it was also towards the end of the night, so it probably had to more to do with the place closing soon, than being pushy. Anyway, we ordered dessert towards closing, a tres leches cake, which was again, was good, but not necessarily the best tres leches cake ever. For the hour we were there between 10 to close at 11pm, it was nice to sit by the fake venetian canal, enjoy some solid drinks, talk and relax. It's a worthy place to relax in the late evening, especially if you aren't trying to get drunk.",

    "text": "I really wanted to find Mexican in Las Vegas, but there were so many places and reviews that we just came here since it was close to our hotel. Our waiter was Mexican, and had some good recommendations about what was good. He was very friendly and knowledgeable about eh menu. Also, I got enchiladas and they had 4 or 5 sauces to choose from based on spice-level. I got the mild mole and they were awesome! And even though it was $18, it seemed worth it since there were 3 of them, plus a huge heap of rice and beans. Given Vegas overpricing, it was definitely a decent value. The chips and salsa was $3 and good, so we didn't mind spending the 3 bucks. We didn't drink because we were too exhausted and dehydrated (1st day in Vegas- walked way too much!), but overall we were happy with our decision to try this place!",

This time wasn't a major disappointment but we will question eating here again in the future. I had the Tres Tacos (fish, pork and mushroom). The pork taco was a bit to \"porky\". It just tasted like a low end taco shop taco in my opinion. The fish had an odor I cannot describe and while it wasn't offensive it wasn't exactly inviting. The mushroom taco was good and as always the cilantro rice was really good.",

Guacamole, I get that, that's always extra (amirite Chipotle?). Any sit-down Mexican restaurant should give you chips and salsa at the table, ESPECIALLY nicer ones like Canonita is trying to be. I payed for the chips and salsa because it's pretty necessary ($5 in case you were wondering), and they were just alright. The chips were great, but the salsa lacks heat completely.   It's the kind of salsa that is afraid to be salsa, afraid to offend the palates of as many people as possible. But brah, it's a Mexican restaurant, we need spicy salsa. At least like, kind of spicy?? If you can't hang with some heat, you shouldn't be at a Mexican place. I don't really get it. Canonita, please raise the damn heat above level 0 on the salsa. Also it should be free at the table. Pls.  I also ordered the chicken burrito. Was it $18? Yes. Did it taste like an $18 burrito? Meh. Don't get me wrong, it was tasty, but for that price that burrito should have everything and the kitchen sink in it. I wasn't wowed by the cilantro rice on the side either, that wasn't terribly flavorful. Chipotle does better rice, I probably should have just gone there instead. Sigh.",

After they brought the meal the offered to bring salsa, oh that happens to be another $1 on the bill at the end.

Hearing the beautiful Italian songs while eating inventive Mexican Cuisine, helps you to appreciate the best of what Vegas has to offer.  We ordered the shrimp fajita, and the Ahi Tuna Crudo. The shrimp fajitas also came with a side of the cilantro rice. The shrimp fajita was more than generous with the amount of shrimp that you actually got. Full of lime, garlic, and lots of pungent peppers. The Ahi Tuna Crudo was covered in beautiful edible flowers, and had just the right amount of salt. They serve the Crudo with rosemary crackers, that are so filling they could almost be a meal on their own. The cilantro rice is the surprising star of the entire meal. It is so bright, and flavorful. I honestly expected only a hint of cilantro, but what I ended up getting was a True to flavor experience. If you are on the fence about whether or not you enjoy cilantro, steer clear. This is full flavor only.  I can safely say I have a new favorite spot the next time I come to Vegas.",

Rico was our server and was a friendly face.  We ordered the chips and salsa appetizer with added guacamole. It was delicious!! The tortillas are made in house, so the chips were very light, crispy, and wonderful. The guacamole was seasoned very well with occasional chunks of avocado. The salsa had no heat to it whatsoever, but was very Smoky.  My boyfriend ordered a patron margarita that was very good.  I docked a star for prices. I know we are in Vegas and everything is more expensive, but I felt it was not clear on their menu that chips and salsa was $5 and the guacamole added was $9 additionally. It seemed it was $9 total for the guacamole, chips and salsa. I would come back just knowing what I am getting this time around.",

    "text": "Meh... Good, not great.   Girlfriends and I were starving after sitting out by the pool all day and we wanted to grab something quick. The menu for Canonita caught our eye, so we decided to check it out.  I feel personally victimized when I go to a Mexican restaurant and they don't rush over an order of chips and salsa. At Canonita, you need to place an order and they're not free - the nerve! But of course we were greedy and ordered the chips, salsa and guacamole as our appetizer. For my main entree I ordered the shrimp burrito. The flavors of the burrito were more Spanish style than Mexican. The sauce on top was on the sweet side and the burrito was  mostly filled with bell peppers, which I did not care for. I did, however enjoy my side of cilantro rice and black beans.  As far as service, it was alright. She did the bare minimum of taking our order and bringing out our food. No check ins or asking if we needed refills, etc.  Not rushing back here on my next visit.",

    "text": "This is a fun restaurant inside The Palazzo! There are so many different shops, restaurants, and bars in The Venetian/The Palazzo (The Grand Canal Shopping Complex). After walking around for a bit, and looking on Yelp, we decided to try Canonita. I LOVE LOVE LOVE Mexican food, so we had to give it a try, and I am happy we did! The atmosphere alone was great. You can sit inside or \"outside\" on their patio, which is right next to the gondolas passing by in the water. The ceiling in this portion of the shopping center is painted in the sky, so you have bright colors opening up the shopping center. It's so relaxing and different, very delightful when having a meal with my hubby. I, of course, ordered the enchiladas, and my husband had their taco plate. I will drive to Vegas, just to have these enchiladas again. The tortillas were stuffed with chicken and drenched in their queso fresco. Holy bananas..... My mouth was in heaven, haha! I couldn't tell you if my husband enjoyed his tacos or not because I was in my own little world enjoying my enchiladas. I am sure he did because he cleared his plate and said they were good, but I looked like I was enjoying my food more than him. I do have to admit; I almost stabbed him with my fork when he tried taking some of my food! :) I eventually shared, and he finally understood why I was so happy. The only reason I didn't give the restaurant 5 stars was the service. It took our waiter some time to get our drinks from the bar and a very long time to get our waters. There were not a lot of people in the restaurant at the time, so on a slow day, I am not sure what the hold up was. Other than that we really enjoyed our time at Canonita. We will be back on our next trip to Vegas in a few months!",

There's two entrances; one coming from the Palazzo side and one from the Venetian side.  They have 'balcony' seating so you can watch the gondolas as they float by and indoor seating.    Staff: Our hostess and waitress were efficient at getting us seated and getting our order out, respectively.    Food:  I ordered the fish tacos and hubs ordered the braised beef enchiladas.  The fish was tender and flaky with a lot of flavor.  The braised beef was also very tender and tasty.  We both loved the cilantro rice that came with our dishes (so much that we looked up how to make it).    Overall, great place to grab some food and watch the gondolas float by.",

We were just looking for a nice spot to sit and watch the gondolas and listen to them singing as they went by.    Canonita was in the right spot and not very busy so we grabbed a table to have some drinks and small plates.    We order the margarita flight which had some pretty tasty versions along with the classic.  To have something to wash down with them we had the queso fundito.  Can't say it was the best I have ever had but it was good with the drinks.    Over all this is an OK place for sitting kind of outside to enjoy the ambiance of the Venetian and having some drinks.  The price is on par with Vegas which means expensive.  The queso was just OK so if the rest of the menu is similar would probably not come back just to have dinner as there are many more better options.  But not bad.",

My fiance and I decided to check the place out during the week and the second to the last day for restaurant week.   Glad they decided to be participating as one of the restaurants in collaboration to supporting a good cause. I thought it was an awesome deal that they decided to do a 3 course meal. Instead of their daily menu my fiance and I both had the prix fix meal. Luckily they both had good options for all 3. We both ended up getting the Santa Rosa Barbacoa along with cilantro rice, beans, and fresh tortillas. I also got the Caesar salad, while the fiance tried the tortilla soup. Dessert, was a brownie sundae and churros with their sauce.   Wait time for everything was perfect and so was the service. Getting the salad proved that their portions would be generous. As soon as our barbacoa  plates came, ohhh how I was thinking that it was going to rock hard. Luckily, as soon as I took a slice it was soooooo tender, juicy and omg the best barbacoa I have tried thus far. The cilantro added a kick of spice to the meal. Definitely would recommend if you love this combo. The entree itself exceeded all my expectations that I cannot believe we waited this long to try this place. What made the cake itself was the desserts. Churros were hot and fresh and enough to share. They also were made to perfection not too cinnamony or sugary. As for the brownie sundae, this too was amazingly good. Felt light not to sweet or overbearing. Almost close to a flourless chocolate cake. Top it off with ice cream and it makes a home run!   Definitely Canonita has our hearts and we cannot wait to come back to try out the regular menu. Try the place out as you will want to come back. Thanks Canonita for the experience!",

I wasn't overly hungry so I went with two street tacos and I love that they used corn tortillas instead of flour. The roasted mushroom taco was my favorite! I also recommend the Mexican city street corn which tastes like it was just cut from the cob after a summer time grilling. You will encounter husk however, but that's the price for fresh ingredients I suspect.",

    "text": "If you get here relatively early on a Saturday or Sunday (and by relatively early I mean around 9 am) I guarantee you can find a nice table by the \"canal\" because majority of people in Vegas will still be asleep/hungover! That is exactly what we did and it was awesome! There really weren't that many people so it was quiet and relaxing, add on top of that awesome food and perfect service and this place is definitely one that we will come back to if we're ever in Vegas, at least for breakfast!   For our drinks we had just regular coffee and a cappuccino. Nothing special about the cappuccino but my husband really enjoyed the drip coffee. For our food we had the Braised Short Rib Chilaquiles and the huevos rancheros. We also requested a side of guacamole and at the end we got churros as breakfast dessert even though we were so full already. Seems they make everything fresh here, including their tacos and quesadillas so overall I just highly recommend this place. Of course our experience is only with breakfast and I cannot speak to other courses that they have.  On to the food. If you're hungry and want meat, you should get the Braised Short Rib Chilaquiles!! These were absolutely delicious and the portion size is humongous, honestly you could probably share it between 2 people. The Monterey jack quesadilla that comes with the huevos rancheros was a nice and unique touch, the eggs were perfectly cooked over easy and our side guacamole tasted fantastic (its $6 for the side guacamole by the way, just fyi, a little steeper than I thought it would be). The churros were also freshly made (upon ordering!) and while they weren't like the ones I had in Spain, they surely were delicious still. They weren't overly sweet which I really appreciated and enjoyed.   I think the only constructive criticism I have for this place is that they could try heating up their coffee cups and more so their plates before serving the food. The plates were cold (not for the braised rib dish as it comes in its own plate, but for the huevos) so it resulted in the food getting cold faster than it would have had the plates been warmed a bit. I think this would make a world of difference in a customer's experience, especially for those of us who eat slowly.  Also, our server Kim S. was so fantastic that I do hope a manager reads this review and gives her a raise or a bonus or something, because she absolutely deserves it. She never made us feel rushed, she gave us space but was also readily available when needed, and overall just a great person. It seems a lot of reviewers were happy with the service they received so it must be a restaurant culture thing, and they're definitely doing a great job with it! Keep up the great work!",

I gave this two stars because the margaritas are amazing and the house made guacamole was delicious but very expensive.  I still have no understanding why chips cost so much when at other places they are still free.  When we sat down the server appeared but he spoke so quickly that it was impossible to understand him.  We asked a couple of questions and I was sure that he understood while my mouth liked heat, my stomach didn't so I couldn't tolerate anything too spicy.  I ordered a chili relleno which normally is not at all spicy and the server took my order without batting an eye.  When the dish arrived, it didn't look like any dish of that name I'd ever had.  It was a deep fried roll on a bed of red sauce.  I took one bite and my mouth was totally on fire and I knew eating that dish would not be in my best interest.  While I like spice, this was bordering on hot pepper status.  I pushed it to the side and finally the server came to ask what was wrong and when I told him his comment, well it's probably because the pepper was picked in the winter and they are hotter.  I've never heard that before believe me.  He offered another dish which I declined.    There is no reason the dish should have tasted like that, it's typically a very bland dish.  Believe me we won't go back again",

We had a party of 11 and she was very attentive to each one of us. I had the posole and beef enchiladas. The soup was amazing and the enchiladas hit the spot. They had generous serving sizes and the flavors were authentic. She even had the bartender make us micheladas which aren't typically on the menu. She also split the check amongst each of us with no problems. I highly recommend this cute restaurant for a great meal. I hope to come back to this place again and try some of their seafood options! Everyone loved their meal!!! Can't wait to be back",

    "text": "Lorrrrrdly lord, I was not prepared for the deliciousness I encountered while dining at this place (I actually ended up here more than once on my trip to Vegas).  Here's the breakdown of what we got, not in one sitting, but over the course of the couple times I've been here...   Caution - everything was delicious.  CHIPS, SALSA, GUAC: def a standard starter at any Mexican restaurant. I NEED my guac and theirs is pretty dang tasty! (Rating: 10/10)  QUESO: We added chorizo and house pickled jalapenos. My GOLLY I'm craving this right now. It was a little thick for my liking when it comes to queso, but it was still good AF. It also comes with some bomb flour tortillas. (Rating: 9/10)  PORK POZOLE VERDE SOUP: I'm a sucker for pozole and FML I loved theirs. Definitely add this to your list if you need a hangover cure. The pork was so tender, and it had a good amount of it in there. (Rating:10/10)  VAQUERO BEER-BRAISED SHORT RIB: If you like tender short rib, GET THIS. I'm drooling thinking about it. The creamy hominy acts like the typical mashed potatoes you'd receive with a short rib dish. It's on the heavy side, so if you want something lifht, I'd avoid it. (Rating: 10/10)  SALMON TORTILLA SALAD: I love a good grilled salmon salad. It's really their chicken tortilla salad, but we just subbed out the chicken for salmon. Highly recommend! (Rating: 10/10)  BREAKFAST BURRITO: If you need the perfect hangover cure, ORDER THIS! I was nursing an awful hangover and this was everything I needed and more. We ordered it to go, and they literally gave us a side of salsa, beans, etc. for each burrito. I think I walked out of there with (10) sides for the (5) burritos I ordered. Will be asking for less next time I'm there since the salsa sides are pretty big. (Rating: 10/10)  They also have this drink that comes in a coconut that's freaking delicious!",

They charge 3 dollars for chips and salsa. Any Mexican place that charges for this is a joke. Especially when the entrees were $25 a plate. I had a salad that had some strange dressing that was OK. That was the highlight of the meal. Then they delivered some barbacoa with rice and beans. The rice was green and flavorless. The black beans were the same. I've had better seasoning on beans from a can. The barbacoa was tender, but the sauce was awful. Only salvation was to dip it in the bland ass hot sauce they provided. There was no heat at all in anything.",

The ambience was perfect and decor was lovely as expected since it's in the Venetian. I thought it was gonna be just your average Mexican restaurant but it was so much more than that!   I had the cheese enchiladas with cilantro rice and I can't even begin to say how delicious it was! It was too perfect for words.   I've had cilantro rice at a few other restaurants after that but it's nothing compared to this place! The portions are big enough to where you can have leftovers to savor for a late night snack!   A little pricy, I'll admit but well worth it! To this day I'm still raving about my amazing dining experience at this place! I'm definitely coming back the next time in Vegas!",

    "text": "Eating here was a bit of a happy accident. Our group of six was on the hunt for a brunch spot and didn't want to spend upwards of an hour waiting for a table. We also didn't want to admit defeat and eat at Denny's. We started looking for lunch instead of brunch, saw that Canonita was nearly empty on a Saturday a little after 11 am, and decided to look no further. I had no great expectations regarding authenticity (I would have gone to Tacos El Gordo for that) but I was optimistic that our meal would be reasonably tasty. I was right.  As luck would have it, the special that day was a chorizo and egg burrito, so I got to have brunch after all. The massive, fork-and-knife burrito was served with cilantro rice and black beans. The beans were nice--mild and lightly sweet--and the rice had a refreshing quality about it. The burrito itself was very tasty (I mean, chorizo and egg, how can you go wrong?). My cactus margarita (made with puree of the fruit, not the paddle) was kind of dull . . . it could have been any margarita, really. My friends ordered a pitcher of some sort of pineapple infused margarita and that was a great choice. Incredibly sweet, but really good. No free table chips/salsa here, but it's Vegas so everything has a price. We ordered chips, salsa and guacamole and it was all very worthy.  Although everything was tasty I'd probably only award three stars if it weren't for the canal-side seating and the fantastic service. I recognize that we were one of the only parties dining at the time so attentiveness should be a given but the attitude was superb as well, particularly when we managed to spill not one but two beverages (and that was before we started drinking!).",

They say Mexico City cuisine but it's not even close. It's more like a cross between Mexico City cuisine meets American meets Tex mex. The food temperature was almost cold or barley warm. One person in our group is a vegetarian so as part of the 3 dishes he ordered, one was a Cobb salad minus the bacon. Their version is spinach with some shaved cheese and dressing. Last time I ordered a Cobb salad it has tomatoes, eggs, cheese, and a few other thing. We did order the flautas and empanadas as an appetizers.  The flautas were probably the best out of all of our dishes. The empanadas were ok but they had so much sauce in the serving bowl that they were soggy on the bottom. The stuffed chicken was oddly flavored with half the dish being very sweet and have more savory. Very odd. Lastly the staff was not very friendly at all.",

It's also a great place for a date, just be sure to ask for a table near the \"canal\" so you can sit while the gondola singers pass by every 10 mins or so.",

We tried 6 of the Venetian restaurants on this trip, and this was one of two that we really enjoyed.  Our waiter was Jesus, and he was excellent!  He happily recommended menu items for us that turned out to be really great.  He was very attentive throughout the entire meal.  We had a seat right next to the canal, so if you enjoy the singing of the gondoliers, it's a nice environment.  They also have seats more inside toward the bar if you don't want to be near the canal.  Appetizer:  Queso Fundido - this was amazing!  We ordered it with chorizo, but I would probably order it with jalapeno as well next time to make it spicy.  It was served with fresh tortillas and we ended up requesting additonal tortillas for it.  Meals: - Wild Mushroom Enchiladas with poblano chili sauce, cilantro rice, borracho beans (pintos and corn). - Carne Asada Nortena with black beans, roasted cerranos and garlic, and sweet corn tamales. - Requested a side of fresh tortillas for this dish also since it was sliced up in a manner similar to a flank steak.  Both meals were presented very nicely and the food was great.  Dessert: - Tres Leches - very good!  We'll be back the next time we come to Vegas if for nothing else than to order the Queso Fundido again.  The only knock on it was that we had to keep requesting more tortillas because they were really small and we were charged each time we requested them.",

The guac was serviceable and had a bit of a spicy bite to it.  Another coworker got the stuffed chile relleno, which she didn't even eat half of (said it wasn't all that great).    The very bad:  My other coworker got food poisoning after eating here.  He was up for hours later that evening puking his guts out.  (I'm pretty sure he got the carne asada.)  The moderately bad: This is a really annoying place to eat if you just want peace and quiet.  We were seated \"outside on the patio\" which really means \"inside the building but they painted the ceiling to look like you're outside.\"  The gondolas go right by you, which I suppose could be a touristy thing to see, but it's painful when you've been working all day and someone boats by 2 feet away shout-singing in your ear.  All in all, I\"d never go back here.",

    "text": "A couple nights ago my friend who is the Beverage manager at the Taqueria Canonita invited my friends and I to an event to celebrate the new concept and remodeling that had taken place here. I had been to the Canonita and the food had been good and the locale is in a prime spot for people-watching. Since it is right next to the Canal in the Venetian, you get to watch the gondolas go by while you sit at one of their tables \"outside\". Now the restaurant has been remodeled and it looks great. The changes are small and discreet, let getting rid of some paitings and adding more light fixtures, etc. But it really looks nice. They painted sectionsof the walls above the kitchen turquoise green and it brightens up the space. On the outside patio there are now umbrellas and little tables that lend it a casual and inviting scene.   They were serving ahi tuna on plaintain chips; the tuna was fresh and delicious. The pork empanadas, short rib on tortilla chip and the albondigas con papa were all very good, and very addictive. There was also a fried avocado with sesame seed (I think sesame seed) that was kind of like a Mexican tempura. The shrimp skewers were kind of difficult to eat the way they were placed on the stick, but were good also. They were served very interesting though, stuck into a big piece of pineapple. Cool presentation.   At the far end of the restaurant they had a couple of people preparing tacos to your liking; they offered carne asada, chicken, carnitas and a couple of different meats. I went with the carnitas, they were very good. They also had different toppings and salsas to add on as well. Oh and for dessert they had pastel de tres leches. Now, any of my friends will tell you that when it comes to dessert, although I have a tremendous sweet tooth, I am still kind of picky. I don't like flan, jello or anything that's too moist, like pastel de tres leches. However, I had been snacking on salty food (and plenty or margaritas) for two hours straight (thanks Alex!) and was open to try a bite for the sugar rush. I must say it was quite good, what won me over was the strawberry jelly. I would recommend you try it.   The food is is supposed to be Mexico City soul food, I don't know if the mean like cocinas economicas or what. I'm not sure if it's particularly chilango food per se, maybe they should add some huitlacoche, flor de calabaza, etc. But all in all the food is very good and quite affordable if you consider where the restaurant is located. As they say, location, location, location.",

Umm, breakfast is great,but not lunch the quality of food has gotten bad and low quality food then what it used to be. Horchata water taste really nasty taste like coconut, orange juice is out of a box carton, limeade  is not good and you pay $5.25 for each drink.

Luckily we arrived during happy hour and was recommended by our waiter to try their margaritas; so I ordered one while my boyfriend stuck with water and Sprite. It didn't take long to get our drinks either; I'm a super fan of speedy and professional service. =)  Dishes: I ordered the Mexico City beef enchiladas and my boyfriend ordered the Carne Asada Nortena. Our appetizer was the pork empanadas. Dessert was their famous tres leches. Everything was divine! The cilantro rice was flavorful and the carne asada was rich and tangy. Yum yum yum!  Only downside is the location of restrooms; it's by the food court. It's not a bad/far walk but kinda strange. The food though was excellent, the service was quick, and the ambiance was fun and relaxing. If we're in the area again, we'll be back!",

If she had simply informed me politely that they didn't allow outside drinks that would have been fine but she pretty much went out of her way to make a scene. When I finished my drink and was seated with my party the ENTIRE night she kept motioning and pointing to me, telling the wait staff to keep and eye on me and kept shorting me dirty looks and shaking her head. A shame that the hostess really ruined a great meal for me and my party...just remember: it's not what you say but how you say it!",

The steak was asked to be cooked \"Rear//Red//Bloody\" and came \"Well done\" with baked potatoes that were cold and hard as rocks. Also, the oysters were good but some of them weren't fresh and were stinking really bad. Hence my 4 out of 5 star rating.  My advice - Stay in the pure Italian register such as pizza/pasta and you'll be more than happy!",

    "text": "Review #700, I'm taking it on the road! Canonita is well worth the trip. Of course, if you're staying at The Venetian, it's as close as the gondolas.   Came here for a party and was delighted from the word 'Go'. Mind you, I kinda stopped with the Mexican food thing because it's so often so mediocre (and that's in any city). And, truly, not the healthiest. But Canonita blew up both of my prejudices.  * Margaritas. Yes, very tasty and potent without knocking me over. Enjoyed the balance of sweetness to citrusy tartness. Mmm. (And they gave us cups for when we later taxi'd off to Karaoke.) * Chips and guac. The chips were tasty, with just enough crisp and just enough salt, and certainly no oily residue. The guacamole was damn good -- thick and tasty, without a lot of mysterious ingredients. Straightforward and delish.  *Filet Mignon was my choice (could have also gone for Salmon or a chicken dish). Lovely 8 oz I think was the weight. Don't bother requesting a temp for your meat, because the kitchen really doesn't think know what's best. Happily, we were of the same mind in term of heat: Medium Rare and loving it. Wonderful flavors that I frankly can't recall (I mentioned the margaritas, right?). If you at all interested in steak, this is a worthy choice for your entree.  I must say the dessert was fine, but anticlimactic. Really not necessary. However, I did have a brownie sundae which definitely didn't hurt anything - except maybe my waistline.  Service was pleasant and attentive without being all over us. Water was refilled as necessary, which for me, is fairly often.   Overall, I was most surprised that the Yelp reviews seemed so unenthusiastic. I would absolutely recommend Canonita, and if you do sit 'outside' by the gondolas, you don't even notice them. Gracias! Muchas gracias!",

Meat just shouldn't smell or taste like it was made last week.  Lastly, the server put the wrong order of tacos on our table & had to swap it out while we were mid bite.

Had to request items to add some flavor (cheese, lime) because it was so flavorless. Another person at our table had the same thing and same feeling. Notified both the waiter and the manager and they offered a different food item, but by then we had eaten it anyhow (we were starving).  At that point, we wished we'd just gone to Chipotle because $13 for a bad salad is a bad bet. So many good places to eat in Vegas. I'd skip this one.",

Obviously I had the flautas and they were soooooo good!!! The sauce was like nothing I have ever tasted before and I hope I can find a place in Arizona that has something remotely close to it.   My wife had the tacos with chicken, rice and beans. Everything was delicious!!! I could not believe how much good food we got for the price and their drinks were just as good.   This was the number one surprise find for me after a week in Vegas. There is even seating alone the river area passing through the hotel giving you the sense that you are out side by the river in Italy.",

    "text": "I'm bumping 3 star food up to 4 stars for a fun drink menu, liberal pours, and great location.  You're in the middle of the grand canal shops, many of the tables overlook the water filled canal with an italian restaurant across the way.  The host and waitress were friendly, and while service was not the most attentive, I was in no rush.  The guacamole was okay.  Not great... it was missing some lime and salt, but it was good.  I had the chile relleno, and was no too impressed.  The pepper and cheese filling were good, but the breading was way too thick and oily.  There was very little sauce, and it did nothing to curb the thick crisp breading on the chile, so it was kind of like biting into an airy cracker or cookie with every bite.  Taste was there, but just an odd experience.  The tres leches was pretty good too... but I remember trying it last time I was here two years ago and loving it.  I don't know if my tastes changed or the tres leches changed, but it was a bit disappointing having built it up in my mind only to be presented with an average dessert.  If you're dining in a Venetian/Palazzo canal shop restaurant, you shouldn't be concerned about the price, you know it's going to be expensive.  But I was fairly surprised the bill was so low for a couple drinks, guac, entree, and dessert.  As I started out the review by saying, you're getting pretty good food, decent prices, and it's a great setting to have a few drinks and sit back to people watch.",

The great thing is that I never return food back because I hate the attitude they can give you, our server noticed I didn't eat it and offered himself to get me something else and came back to check on me.

I usually love my drinks more on the tart side but this was just too much. My husband ordered the margarita flight and seemed to enjoy it. We ordered chips and salsa for an appetizer.

Also a must get is the Santa Rosa Pork Barbacoa which just falls off your fork and melts in your mouth with barbecue sauce.  Another favorite was the wild mushroom enchilada.

Seating was a bit weird as they had several open tables and instantly seated the person who walked up seconds before I did and was also solo, yet I was asked to wait for 30 minutes. Oh well. I walked around browsing shops and sampling gelato.  When I was seated service was pleasant and helpful. I seemed to have to waiters but the gentleman who helped me was very pleasant and suggested the pork barbacoa, even when he knew I was considering a more expensive dish. Plus one star for integrity!  I ordered chips and salsa. A very inexpensive appetizer and I devoured them with joy. Chips were ultra fresh and the salsa had a gentle spice and was tasty.  When the pork arrived it came with warm and supple corn tortilla, sides of rice and black beans. The rice had plenty of flavor but was a hair drier than I prefer. The beans were simple and perfectly cooked. I loathe an undercooked bean and black beans are almost always served that way so I was very pleased.  I urge anyone to ask for a couple lime wedges with this meal. The pork was amazingly falling apart tender and the chipotle BBQ was satisfyingly complex. The squeeze of lime over it offset the \"dry\" spice pallet of the BBQ sauce and made the pork flawless.   My only regret was my dinner was so delectable that I no longer have room for the gelato I was eyeing. Ah well. There's always tomorrow! ;)",

    "text": "Very very disappointing experience. My cousin had been planning his proposal to his fiance for months. As locals, there are tons of cool places to plan such a special night. After weighing out his options he decided to pop the question on the gondolas in the Venetian and have all of our friends and family wear \"will you marry me?\" shirts on the patio of Canonita and to enjoy dinner there afterwards as part of the surprise. Due to it being such a large party (20 people) he made sure to make the reservation and explain the situation multiple days in advance. Upon our arrival, we executed the plan as explained over the phone, briefly took group photos and took our seats. As we went to sit down there was only seating prepared for 16 people, not 20 as expected and the seating for the 16 was all split up and not even together. The 4 of us who did not end up having seats (2 of the 4 being the newly engaged couple) looked around confused and due to their being plenty of open tables decided to just take a seat at the next closest vacant table to the rest of our party. Within a seconds a waiter walked over and slammed a \"reserved\" sign down on the table we were sitting at and rudely told us we needed to move. He did not offer an alternative table or any help and we were really caught off guard. Luckily another waitress came over and helped us to another table. Our waitress was good and attentive once we were finally settled in and our experience was starting to be ok. Just as we all got our food and began to eat, the manager, katherine keuling came over, interrupted our meal and informed us that they would be charging us an additional $15 per person due to our group photo taking too long before we sat down.....? We were taken by complete surprise and felt as if not only were we fast with the photos but were confused as to why she would wait until we all had began eating to come over and inform us of this. We were extremely offended for the second time during our visit on what should have been such a special night for our family. We ended up just getting up and leaving with most of our food and alcohol untouched. Our waitress missed out on a 20% tip on a $1,000 bill due to her rude colleague and careless manager. We will be sure to spread the word about our experience to our other friends and family that live here in town and enjoy dining out. Absolutely unacceptable.",

We had a table on the patio overlooking the canal as the gondolas slid by, the gondoliers singing beautifully, their songs echoing off the sky painted on the ceiling.  Everything in Vegas is fake something else and this is one of the better cases.  Anyway, I love Mexican food and the food here was quite good.  I had the chicken fajitas and my friend had the chicken mole.  It wasn't the chocolately style of mole he likes but it was good all the same.  My fajitas were tasty and plentiful but nothing exceptional.  The margaritas were very good.  If you compare prices to other Mexican restaurants you know, this is pretty expensive.  (The charge for chips and salsa.). But if you compare the cost of a decent meal in a beautiful setting anywhere else in Vegas, it's a bargain.  Pros:  good food, good service, reasonable prices, wonderful setting  Cons: should have asked \"salt/no salt\" when we ordered margaritas and why did I have to ask for a glass with my beer?",

However, there is one particular dish here that I ALWAYS get, so although I may not be the best judge in determining if this restaurant is particularly good overall, at least I know one thing...their barbarcoa plate is DEEEEELICIOUS!  I mean, I have tried bites of other items on their menu from people that I'm eating with, and they all seem pretty decent, however none of them have compared to the barbarcoa.  It's so tender that no knife is needed; the meat just falls apart when poked gently with the fork.  It comes with cilantro rice, which is really good too, black beans, which I don't really eat cuz I'm simply not a fan of beans, and tortillas.  They also have strong, but tasty drinks here, and the servers have always been nice.  And, you can pretend you sitting outside a Venetian restaurant because its right by the gondola ride.  What more can you ask for?!?",

We were told the tres tacos were all white meat but it as mixed (no problem with but it would've been nice to know...the manager said it's supposed to be all white so I have no idea what happened there). We asked if we could special order some nachos and we were told the chef has \"attempted many times to make nachos but keeps failing\" - at first we didn't understand exactly what that meant, the manger later told me they don't have the proper cheese and they cheese they use doesn't melt well and the chef wouldn't send it out with her name on it and doesn't see it as presentable - but that's what we wanted melted cheese or not and frankly, the chef sent out our other food seemingly not caring if her name was on that and it wasn't that great. The refried beans with chroizo is defintely worth it. Overall it was a waste - $55 for okay service, one order of \"street\" tacos, 2 orders of \"flautas\" and the chips and salsa we had to pay for. When I addressed my concerns with the manager she didn't really seem to care and stood by the food (absolutely great and a quality I admire in a manager but I really feel she should've bent a little as we left feeling like she didn't care about our experience) we are locals and will never go back to this restaurant. Your money is much better spent in the Venetian food court.",

Plates are huge, so I would suggest splitting. That is exactly what we did. Got the a la carte taco platter with 6 different tacos...mushroom and queso, fish with mango, chicken, beef, pork, and rajas with queso. Light, fresh, and good. Great midday snack before we headed back out onto the Vegas Strip. Love the iron gates, columns, and tiling...located right on the Venetian's canal.",

Just off the Venetian Hotel next to all the shops, you can feel like you're sitting outdoors at a Mexican cafe with the sunny blue skies (aka the ceiling) and gondolas drifting by.    I loved the guacamole here - so good!  And pretty spicy.  Loved it!  The bf got the seared tuna.  It was delicious!  I can't remember the name of what I got, but it was short ribs served over mashed potatoes - also delicious.  The meat was so tender and just fell off the bone.  MOUTH-WATERINGLY DELICIOUS!  :)  We were here for dinner to celebrate our friend's birthday...we told the hostess AND our waitress...and that doesn't get you anything.  I think that's really stupid!",

    "text": "I had doubts about the authenticity of the food at first,  being that this is a Mexican place at the Venitian hotel. And though I cant say the dishes were 100% traditional, everything my party tried was delicious. Im not sure if the twist they put on their dishes is just to make them unique or if they are fused with a different culture, all I know is that the flavors blended well and left me wanting to go back! I ordered the Chiapaneco citrus glazed salmon, which was marinated in a delicious tamarind sauce, topped with mandarins and served with a sweet potato hash. Honestly,  I was very surprised at how much I enjoyed it! My boyfriend ordered the Mazatin seared ahi with quinoa salad and that was also really good. The ahi was seared with this really tasty chile sauce... best seared tuna ive ever had! He also ordered the shrimp calamari cocktail, which I expected to be a bland American version, but was actually very close to the authentic Mexican style... also very good. My sister and her girlfriend tried the chicken enchiladas and a Tarascan chicken soup, which I did not try but they loved. And last but not least, my absolute favorite thing was the sangria de rojo, which is a blend of sangria and margarita. Now I want to go back to try every other drink on the menu! **The service and the view were great too!**",

The food was surprisingly delicious, but the service was a little iffy....  just slow and it seemed like a long conversation just to put one order in.  Despite the speed, the food came out perfect.  And I scarfed down what I could of my beef enchiladas.  The entrees come with black beans and cilantro rice, which were awesome, but there was too much of it.  I always feel bad when I leave food on my plate.  We had just seen our boy, Pacquiao win his title event on the casino floor which was invigorating, but we were also starving too.    Since we were so hungry... I think that made it seem like the service was slower, but looking at our watches afterward... we did kill a whole bunch of time just sitting there and eating.  We also ordered chips and guacamole... which were nice and hot and good.    Overall it was a good meal and it was nice sitting next to the canal and hearing the gondoliers sing their songs to the couples riding in the boats.",

    "text": "I had the pleasure of dining here today (6/11/10) actually while exploring the Venetian for all its wonders. It happened to be happy hour when we were passing by.  The big happy hour menu is what caught our attention and from there we were drawn in like moths to a flame.   We were seated very quickly and the setting overlooked the Venetian's waterway. A nice romantic scene for you and your loved one. The waiter Alejandro who's name brought Lady GaGa's song to mind immediately. Alejandro, Alejandro, Ale, Ale, Ale, Ale, Alejandro... however many times she repeats it. He was awesome.  I was in a chicken taco kind of mood as usual, but I quickly changed my mind after I saw the chicken enchiladas. You had your choice of toppings but I can only remember the mole poblano for whatever reason. My wife opted for the chicken tacos surprisingly.   Of course I ordered a Modelo (it was fitting at the time) and my wife ordered the cape cod. We should have ordered chips and salsa because the drinks came right away which was cool, but since we haven't really eaten anything prior to, our buzz started to kick in after a few rounds. The cape cod was very strong as you can taste more vodka then cranberry juice, but we were in Vegas so who cared. The stronger the better.    When the food arrived we were slightly tipsy and before my wife got the opportunity top dig in I reached for my fork and blocked her from grabbing the chicken tacos. I wanted to take a few snaps of them as they were. It's what I do.   The chicken tacos according to my wife were very flavorful and juicy. My chicken enchiladas were excellent and I would highly recommend them topped with the mole poblano sauce as it adds a wonderful kick. The black beans and cilantro rice were the perfect sides.   If you get the opportunity give it a try and if possible see if you can get seated in Alejandro's section. He was very attentive. We had an awesome experience!",

We were hungry but didn't want to spoil our dinner that was in a few hours.  So we all ordered the Mexican Chopped Salad of grilled chicken, roasted veggies, smoked panela cheese in a beautiful Sherry-cumin vinaigrette (4.5 stars).  Along with margaritas (4.5) and great chips, salsa and guacamole (4.5), we were satisfied.  Service was prompt and pleasant (4 stars).  A rather interesting setting along the \"Venetian canals\" under a simulated wintry-blue sky.  Mexican food in \"Venice\".  There's a first for everything.  Tally: Mexican Chopped Salad:  4.5 stars Margaritas:  4.5 stars Chips/Salsa:  4.5 stars Service:  4 stars 4.5+4.5+4.5+4= 17.5/4= 4.4 stars.",

    "text": "Chips and salsa is a MUST here. Guac is decent. I lalaloooove the cilantro rice and black beans that come with most dishes. The tacos are fucking BOMB diggity...so are the margaritas; it all tastes very authentic. Nothing better than homemade EVERYTHING...and you can actually taste it!!  I seriously crave their margaritas after a while! So refreshing and tasty.   The service is always superb. I usually sit at the bar, just to kind of avoid that kitschy Venetian feel. All of the bartenders are attentive and friendly. The overall vibe of the place is welcoming and warm - disregarding the \"mall atmosphere\" happening around the place.   If you like the feel of the Venetian, this would be the place to relax and enjoy a very good meal - the Canal flows right past the restaurant as you hear the gondola singer's serenading echoes.   There's an open kitchen where you can see fresh tortillas being made and dishes being cooked to order. I absolutely love it. Excellent execution of service, very well organized, clean and customer oriented. I'm definitely a fan of this place.",

It was my mistake to order this dish not knowing it is melted cheese.  My advice google the image of any dish you have not ordered before. That's my lesson for ordering this thinking it's another name for quesadilla.   Would not recommend this place for vegetarians. The drinks were good, it is right by the gondola ride inside the Venetitian. Still, all of this did not add up to the food options for vegetarian.",

It's a relaxing atmosphere, both for the young and old. Try to opt for this seating area instead of inside.   Their shrimp burrito is phenomenal - loaded with shrimp in every bite, no exaggeration. The cilantro rice was the perfect touch.  The chicken tacos (came with 3) were pretty standard- but they did have pickled onions which were a nice addition.   Each plate ranged from 16-20 dollars, so it's pretty reasonable for Vegas.  P.S. Sometimes it's too busy that they won't be able to seat you if you try to walk in- so your best bet is getting a reservation!",

You are right on the canal so you get to watch all the gondolas go by. Watching all the people with their frozen smiles as they gaze up at the singing gondoliers is good fun.   The guac and salsa is excellent. The enchiladas are pretty good - I prefer the red sauce over the green because even though the green is tasty, the red has a nice kick and something about the green sauce causes everything to go a little soggy. I don't like soggy food - ever. The sangria margarita is not good (Sangria is supposed to be sweet which is a nice counterbalance to your margarita. Their sangria is tart and the drink does not work). Their soups tend to be heavy, but otherwise very tasty. Their fajitas are pretty good too.   I'm sure I'll eat here again.",

The biggest draw back was the flavors. We got the 5 taco sampler and tried mushroom, chicken, pork and beef. Chicken and beef were both pretty good with fresh ingredients. The mushroom tasted like they were almost pickled and the pork had decent flavor but was so dry it was almost not edible. The chips are very thick and overwhelmed the salsa that had almost zero flavor. Overall good atmosphere, just lacked great food.",

We were seated quickly and the food was well paced. Our waiter was friendly yet not overbearing. Clearly knew the menu, offered great suggestions, and took note on our special requests.  Food: 5 stars! Thank god for advertising or else we would have by passed this place. On the board outside the restaurant each colored slide of their food looked amazing, orgasmic we kept moaning and commenting on every picture haha. When girls are hungry! Lol. And we can now add that the pictures live up to the hype!!!. Everything was fantastic here, wish we would have tried more. The queso fundito was amazing amazing, the highlight of the appetizers. Their tacos plates are awesome as well, I'd recommend the sampler plate but if I had to recommend one I'd say go with the carnitas. Even the little things were good, awesome rice and beans.  A tecate with lime juice and Ice brought the final scoring up to 5 stars! Can't wait to come back next vacation. So yummy!",

The waitress did skip me for the drink orders though. She finally asked me if I wanted something as the food was coming out, but at that point I was over it.   If you do come here, please whatever you do, GET THE GUAC. I know, Mexican restaurant, the guac is just guac. NO. This place has theeee best guac, I've had in a long time. I filled up on guac before my main meal came. (No regrets.)  We ordered a variety of things. All yummy. I personally got the taco sampler. It came with pork, fish, chicken, mushroom, and steak tacos. All yummy, although the steak was prob the winner. The mushroom was something different though. Also a good option were the Ahi tuna tacos. They come with some king of polenta which is spicy.   The only thing we weren't too crazy about was the cilantro lime rice. For me, it was a little toooo much cilantro. And i even love it. Its bright green if you don't believe me.  The staff otherwise was super friendly and had great interaction with the toddler in our group.   Check it out!",

It was the one time I wished I was more hungry so I could finish it. While I wasn't a fan of the cilantro rice because I don't like cilantro, my mom absolutely loved it. This place was also super accommodating to my allergies.   I knocked off one star because it took us 30+ minutes to get our food and the place wasn't very busy. In addition, they left the beans and tomato on my plate when I specifically said I didn't want any.  But they were quick to fix the mistake. The place was great, just be prepared to wait a little bit for your food.",

    "text": "*This review is for breakfast only*  I feel like I discovered this joint deep in the Venetian/Palazzo labyrinth! You could pretty much walk by (or float by in one of the gondolas) and not notice it amongst all the colorful background action going on, but you'd be wise to track it down next time you're at the Venetian. Beautiful, open restaurant with a nice bar and lots of seating right along the canal.  WHEN YOU GO- I love eating breakfast right at the bar. Feels so decadent! Plus you always get great service because the bartenders are prepping for the day and not dealing with drunks. The Short Rib Chilaquillas are a must try. Cheesy, spicy with perfectly marinated chips, this dish is without a doubt my favorite. The omelets and breakfast burritos are very good as well. Fantastic, friendly service by all + very good house coffee makes this spot my go- to for breakfast when at the Venetian!",

It was insanely beautiful and a fun space! We came on cinco de mayo, so they had a girl with a patron ice luge in the front for $5 a shot. It was fun, but sadly the tequila didn't actually go through the luge (just went through a tube) so it was super warm when you got it.  The food, drinks, and service were all great! We started off with the chips/salsa/guac and queso fundido. They were both on point! I split the mushroom enchiladas with one of the other girls and it was definitely the BEST dish at the table! The poblano sauce was so amazing and the dish as a whole was just perfect! The cinco de mayo menu had black bean empanadas on the specials menu, so we tried that, as well and it was great - definitely had a nice kick to it! We ordered pitchers of margs for the table and enjoyed them, as well- super strong.   The service was fast, attentive, and friendly. Definitely had a great experience here and would for sure come back another time I'm in Vegas.",

    "text": "The wife and I found this place by chance as we were walking after a long day in Vegas and decided we wanted some place to sit down and have a drink.  This place looked really nice and had some open spots so we asked for a table by the faux river that had the guys singing to various guests as they paddled up and down the fake scenery.  We thought maybe it'd be nice to check out their food but we weren't hungry enough for a full meal so we just decided to get dessert.  I didn't want anything to heavy so the server recommended I try the Tres leches and my wife went with the warm banana brownie.  When mine arrived and I tasted it, it was incredible..like a sponge cake with fruit, very light and sweet but not overwhelming. My wife's warm banana brownie was also incredibly good, although a bit rich for me.  Very rich chocolate and the wife loved it.    Their desserts were both really fantastic and our server couldn't have been more helpful or nice to us.  She was spot on with the recommendation for me to get the Spicy Bloody Mary.  Yes it was quite spicy but hit the spot perfect.  What was going to be one drink quickly became two.  I'd highly recommend this place, they are total class and the food, from what we sampled, is top notch.  Note, not only was our server nice but everyone in here seemed to go out of their way to say hello or acknowledge us and seemed like they were really having a good time here, something that can't be said of a lot of restaurants.  Very welcoming!  When we come back to Vegas we plan to come back to Canonita and get a full meal next time.. Highly recommend!",

I walked over to the Venetian hoping I could be there before they stopped serving breakfast. Ended up getting completely lost but found it with 4 mins to spare. I was seated right away. I have a table right next to the indoor gondola so I could see the gondolas passing and the gondoliers singing. Absolutely wonderful view and very romantic.   I ordered the Mexican Pancakes, which came with bacon, and breakfast potatoes. I also ordered a mimosa. The portion size of the pancakes was large. The potatoes were great. The bacon was cooked perfectly. The pancakes were... meh. They did taste homemade and the flavor of them were good but they were extremely dry. I used 3 servings of syrup and they still needed more. The mimosa was strong but good.  I enjoyed the ambiance and the service at Canonita but the food was nothing special. Maybe the lunch and dinner options are better but breakfast is not a good indication.",

They feature 5 types of taco, shredded chicken, beef, pork, fish and vegetarian, on either wheat or corn tortillas. Fortunately, they are happy to make the plate with one of each type of taco. We ordered two of the variety plates to share, one on corn, the second on wheat...every combination. All of the tacos were delicious. I especially liked the vegetarian (lots of mushrooms) and the pork. I usually prefer corn tortillas for tacos, but here, I preferred the wheat. Where we come from, spending nearly five dollars on a single street taco would be crazy, but the Venetian (all of the Strip, actually) does that to you. Also, the margaritas are good.",

Although the margarita is a little small for $15 I get why. It was delicious. I normally don't like my margaritas too sweet but yet not too strong either and I think they nailed it with this one.   I ordered the ahi tostada to start with and after tasting my first bite I was addicted. It doesn't look like it's too much but it ended up being a good amount once you start eating it. It had a little kick too it which I liked.   We then ordered some chips and guacamole to share. It comes with salsa too which is great, another great choice. The guacamole tasted so fresh and the chips we're a great consistency.   If the drinks and apps tasted this good I can't wait to come back to try the entrees!",

    "text": "This place has been here for 19 years.  It's right by the Venetian lake where you can be serenaded by the gondoliers and tourists floating by you on gondolas.  The renovated decor here is quite nice, and colorful, as though it were a street corner in Mexico.  (A nice touch is the bright robin's egg blue Citroen truck parked on one side of the restaurant where tacos are sold--smart!)  The crab cakes ARE quite good (as others have said), but \"muy picante\" (very spicy).  It would have been nice for the server to let us know that.  Thankfully, I enjoy spicy, and it was delicious.  But my husband did not fare as well, and could only take a bite.  He also ordered a steak dish with beans that had really spicy onion and jalapenos on it that made his eyes immediately water and his hands reach out for water (which was almost gone).  Needless to say, he did not enjoy his meal.  And at $36, it was a waste.  Again, this is something the server should have given a heads-up about!  I took some of his onions/jalapenos and placed them in my pozole soup, and MAN ALIVE, it was HOT! I had to immediately take them out, but the contact with the soup, made it irredeemably spicy thereafter, even for me.  (Though I did nearly finish it, anyway).  I think the server should have given a heads up, as I said. I even ASKED about the spiciness level, and he said not to worry.  The menu should probably give a better heads-up, too.  Not everyone is a spicy food person; some of us are gringos, remember! This is a tourist place, after all.   And it took a long time to get re-fills on drinks, and our server kept forgetting our corn tortillas, etc.  I was trying to get him to get me the enchiladas to try, but he didn't catch on. Maybe he was given too many tables?  It's a busy location.   Aside from the crab cakes, the Queso fundido is a safe bet, too. (Cheesy, rich, and not spicy). The pork pozole had a nice, mild flavor.  I would avoid the chocolate dessert.  (Though I am a chocolate fanatic!)  It was way too dense.  But the tres leches cake was better.  Overall, the food was tasty (though I suspect loaded with salt and/or MSG, or artificial sugar or something--we were really quite bloated that night--first time in a long while, despite eating out a LOT), but the service was lacking.    Aside from not providing good information about the spice level of the food (despite asking), and not getting drinks filled, the server failed to give us the 10% discount that the manager suggested that we get for being locals.  Even though we asked, and he said he would, he didn't do it.  I didn't notice until I reviewed the bill walking away from the restaurant.  And we called about it, and were told that they would take it off the bill and get back to us...but no one got back to us.  Bummer.",

Since I ate so many of the yummy chips, I didn't eat the rice and beans, but the tacos were beyond yummy!  My husband ordered the 5 street tacos (combo of chicken and pork).  He asked for no onions, but they overcompensated with extra cilantro.  It was a little too much for his liking, but after taking some of it out, he loved his too.  The 5 tacos don't come with anything though.  The service at Canonita is great too.  Our server was friendly, and gave us advice on food and drinks since this was our first visit.

We also ordered the \"quesadilla\" off the appetizer menu to share and chips & salsa. The chips were kind of hard, but the salsa was good. The quesadilla was more of an empanada, but it was delicious.  Maybe we'd give it another try if we're back in the shops there.",

We arrived with a party of 12 and ordered a few appetizers; floutas, nachos and with Salsa.    I ordered the 3 taco meal that allows for a choice of beef, chicken, shrimp, or pork.  I just ordered all of mine with shrimp which also came with a side of rice and beans for $20.99.  My dish looked amazing but lacked flavor so I used the green and regular salsa on top.  Honesty, the 3 tacos filled me up and I barely touched the sides.    Our waiter was very attentive to our table and paid attention with refilling our glasses.  He also checked up on us often to ensure we were happy with our meals.  His service was great and deserves as 5 star rating.  As far as location, it's perfect; especially if you enter through the Venetian entrance near Madame Tussaud's.  It's right next to the Gondola rides inside the Mall area.  We enjoyed the singing and views!  Check out the place, the margaritas looked good!",

The waiter forgot to bring the chips and salsa we ordered (we're used to that being automatic and free) so he gave us a free dessert, tres leches cake. It was ok, but not anywhere near the best we've had. Maybe if we didn't have so much Mexican food at home in Houston, we would've been more impressed.",

While Canonita is basically inside of a mall, it also sits on the canal that the gondolas of the Venetian turn around.  This can be romantic, comical and cheesy at the same time.  I mean the atmosphere is supposed to be of Venice, Italy but you are eating tacos with a Sketchers in the background lol.    We started off with the guac and chips.  They do not do the whole free chips and salsa thing.  The guacamole was fresh and had a little spicy kick to it.  I also decided to order a flight of margaritas. Did you read that?  A FLIGHT OF MARGARITAS!!!  It comes with 3 margaritas: a classic on the rocks, a pineapple and a jalapeno.  The jalapeno was very spicy and harder to get down than the other 2.  The classic was very heavy on lime.  For an entree I got the Pollo Mole Poblano.  I love chicken with mole sauce and get it anytime I see it.  This one had poblano peppers in the sauce so it tasted spicier than usual.  It came with a seasoned rice and mixed veggies.  Definitely a great meal.  If you are looking for Mexican while on the Vegas strip, this is worth a stop for sure.",

I wasn't a huge fan of the potatoes. I thought maybe they needed more seasonings. The restaurant is small but it feels like you are in a different part of the world. It also had a bar. I didn't order and alcoholic beverage but I noticed that they did have happy hour and they had a variety of different options for margaritas. I also did notice that the restaurant makes their own tortillas and you get to see the lady working hard to make them as you eat your food.

    "text": "Breakfast during the 2nd day of the CES convention this week -arrived shortly after they opened around 8am without a reservation; no problem getting a table, and right on the canal.  My server was Udelle, service was prompt and excellent throughout my meal -had my coffee within 5min, ordered the Huevos BLT, arrived within 5min.  Didn't see the advertised chipotle crema on the BLT so asked for more on the side -got that within 3min.  The sandwich was good -a bit rich with that brioche bun.  Ranchero potatoes were over-spiced for my taste -heavily dusted with chili powder, cumin & salt.  Perhaps the asadero cheese potatoes offered with some of the other entrees are a better option.  My tab came to $19 incl tip -reasonable, considering I paid $13 the previous morning for Starbucks and a Subway breakfast sandwich to go!  Departed at 9am and tables were still available, so the hot tip for a sit down breakfast option during CES!",

One of our pancakes was under cooked in one spot and our two eggs on the huevos came out super overcooked even though we ordered over medium. I would recommend trying another spot for breakfast in the Venetian/palazzo or even walk over to the Wynn and go to the Terrace restaurant.",

    "text": "This was our first visit to Canonitas in the Palazzo/Venetian Canal shops, and enjoyed the meal and service very much.  Open Table reservations worked great, and they accommodated the request for the desired table by the canal, and recognized our Anniversary celebration.  Front desk was very friendly and sat us promptly, followed quickly by our server greeting us.  There is a variety of choices for food, but don't expect the typically Mexican food, as there seems to be a originality to many of the dishes.  Started with Chips, Salsa, and Guacamole (this is menu item, not complimentary) with the Salsa having a slight smokiness which as very enjoyable.  Followed by a chicken tortillas soup, and entrees of Santa Rosa Barbacoa and Wilde Mushroom enchiladas.  Both entrees were delicious, and well seasoned.  Dessert followed with a traditional churros (Hot out of the fryer) and a non-traditional brownie and ice cream.  The churros dipping sauce was very tasty, not your typically chocolate sauce.  Overall, our server Juan and the management made our first visit memorable and very enjoyable, and we would plan to return again.  FYI - sitting on the patio next to the canal is very enjoyable, and maintains a good noise level that normal conversation can still be held.",

Polenta medallions were mushed up into cake form and Pan fried so it had a crispy outside. It was tasty but texture wise I could only eat 1 of the 3 cause it was mushy  Vegetarian burrito - 3/3 - off the menu for my vegetarian cousin. Normal, nothing super exciting.  Liked the big chunks of veg. Huge burrito, should have just shared it and been fine. Comes with cilantro rice and black beans. I asked for a side of their poblano creamb sauce which was a good complement.   Service - 4/5 - nice waiter. Had to call him over a couple times so could have checked in on us a little more in a not super crowded restaurant.  But went out of his way to try to get pics of us with the gondola.  Hostess was very friendly as well.",

I wouldn't go back- but I had a nice experience and a fine dinner- I ate the mushroom enchiladas and ordered the salsa with guacamole. The service was nice and kind.   I would say my review is neutral and without negativity - perhaps I was just expecting more amazing flavor.",

I realized quickly the menu was from Mexico City, not \"Americanized Mexican\".   We made reservations for 4, the guacamole had a light kick, the queso fundido was awesome, I was happy to introduce it to my work friends who had never tried it before. We were seated on the patio next to the Gondola ride so it was a nice \"people watching\" place for sure.   I was torn between the chile relleno and the taco flight. I went with the chile relleno, it had a strong kick to it. I couldn't finish it. My friend had the taco flight and they looked AMAZING! Will have to try it next time I'm in town.   The michelada was not as expected but still tasted good.   And the coffee flan was a perfect ending to our night!",

My boyfriend ordered the Mexico City beef enchiladas which came with black beans and cilantro rice. His plate was pretty tasty. But mine was definitely better. I ordered the wild mushroom enchiladas that came with beans and buttered rice. It was rich and decadent covered in this sinful green sauce. The mushrooms were soaked in this cream sauce that almost made me cry. I would come back here again for this dish alone.

She directed us to the bar when I specifically told her I wanted a table by the river. She insisted that they were about to close. The tall red head saw that she didn't want to seat us and she apologized and sat us at a table by the river. She was very nice and apologetic and explained the happy hour menu to us and gave us some drink recommendations. She gave us her name but I don't remember, Briana perhaps . But besides that  food was delicious and waitress was great.  Maybe next time I will make sure I am not there 5 minutes before close!",

Taqueria Canonita, you would  think being so close to the border and with so many people coming from LA to Vegas, they would have some great Mexican food.  I ordered the Santa Rosa Pork Barbacoa at the recommendation of the waiter.  As my stomach churned for that slow cooked, delicious pork, I was greeted with a fairly bland and very dry pork.  I would have been better off with Chipotle's barbacoa than what Canonita served up.  The empanadas that were ordered for the table were far from crispy and the guacamole that came with the tortilla chips were not fully mashed.  Far too many errors for a sit down restaurant to be any good.  On the plus side, the tequila helped me forget the awful food.",

Our group tried a little bit of everything -- starting with crispy tortilla chips accompanied by fresh guacamole that let the avocado shine. The jalapeno margaritas and sangria helped get the party turned up, too. Our server, Juan Carlos, was delighted to help with recommendations; in addition, he is very good at hospitality and made us feel welcome instantly. I couldn't make up my mind when it was time to order an entree, so I asked Juan Carlos what he would pick. He suggested the Santa Rosa Barbacoa that features \"guajillo chile rubbed pork served in a banana leaf, chipotle barbecue sauce, cilantro rice, black beans, and housemade corn tortillas.\" The kitchen roasts the pork in that banana leaf for five hours, so the meat is tender and can be pulled apart easily. I layered it inside the tortillas with the rice, beans, and sauce. What a treat! My two friends ordered the taco sampler and chicken enchiladas. They were equally impressed by their dishes. The location of the restaurant on one of the Venetian's \"canals\" adds to the delightful atmosphere, and your chances of hearing a singing gondolier are very good. I will definitely return the next time I'm in Vegas!",

How could they change our favorite foods??? But I will have to say , yes it's possible, it is even better!!!! We tried 4 different things tonight. For an appetizer we had the shrimp and calamari cocktail. How many ways can I say delicious, it literally melts in your mouth ,with a little kick of habanero. Next was the Ensanada crab cakes. They are stuffed with crab and shrimp and come with a chili cream sauce to sop up with the crab cakes. My husband had the San Luis Potosi Pork Chop with creamy mushroom hominy. There is just not enough good yummy words to say about this meal. To top it off we had the  newest dessert, peach bunuelos . That , with the always awesome margaritas and good fellowship , was the perfect evening.  Thanks again Canonita family for a super great dining experience.",

    "text": "Invited Chef's Tasting, Not Billed but tipped appropritately:  Told that the Chef would be cooking for us, but offering up menus in case something specific struck our eye, it was with gracious tableside service from a middle-aged Hispanic gentleman that the afternoon commenced and with a jokey sort of professionalism guiding us through the afternoon one really could not have asked for better, Northeastern-born but Border Grill educated Chef Donna Willey also stopping by frequently to discuss her inspiration and training, as well as techniques implemented in more than a dozen plates plus two trios of drinks.  Undoubtedly a 'touristy' setting, the views of artificial sky alongside the canal juxtaposing traditional Mexican decorations within the restaurant's confines, it was with a trio of Margaritas and chips rewarmed from an outside source that the dining began and finding both the green salsa and Jalapeno Infusion far too poignant for my tastes it was on the Vanilla tinged pineapple cocktail and guacamole that I focused, the former a formidable refresher with alcohol well balanced by the fruit while the later was rather dull without a bit of the chipotle salsa added to taste.  At this point ready to see what the kitchen could do, tables around us receiving all sorts of divine looking plates, it was perhaps ten minutes later that a sizzling cast-iron skillet arrived and with the smell of smoke quickly filling the air it was only once things finally cooled down that we finally had a chance to indulge in the snappy butterflied shrimp, meaty mussels, and housemade chorizo teaming with spice, each taste as good as the last with a second dish of queso fundido proving most fortuitous in timing as the still-bubbling cheese topped in jalapenos was a bit timid on its own, but a near-perfect addition when spread on  flour tortillas with some of the seafood piled on top.  At this point requesting service be slowed as our sizable two-top was already filled to capacity with plates, glasses, and utensils it was next to a trio of the Chef's signature appetizers that we were treated and progressing left to right one would be hard pressed to cite a single bite as less than superlative - the ceviche showing clean acidity alongside its accoutrements while the Pozole was equally well balanced and intensely vegetal, the 'gordita' a lightly fried set of bites that was at once bold yet nuanced, creamy but acidic, and entirely greaseless with just the right amount of heat.  Obviously unable to forgo anything stuffed with duck, plus generally fancying most things featuring mushrooms, the next three plates were served in slow succession and although the cinnamon tinged fowl stuffed inside a smoky pepper was indeed quite good it was in fact the fungus that saw me swoon, both the black bean laminated Portobello bathed in fennel tomato sauce and the signature enchiladas showing a deft hand with quality produce, Chef Willey's time at Border Grill undoubtedly well spent.  At this point progressing towards heavier proteins, plus an entirely unexpected Brazilian fish stew, suffice it to say that while the Carne Asada struck me as something I could have just as easily had anywhere both the Barbacoa and Moqueca were amongst the very best bites of the meal, the former brightly spiced and easily cut with a spoon before being added to corn tortillas to form makeshift tacos while the later was a seamless marriage of sea and sweet with coconut milk playing foil to notes of spice that only became evident after a satisfied breath between bites.  Moving onward to desserts, originally offered two but eventually seeing three, it was with a double espresso over ice that the meal would come to an end and although personal preferences obviously have much to do with all things in dining one would be challenged to find a better tres leches in town, the fully saturated sponge entirely sweet yet finding levity in strawberries and meringue, while both the brownie and the flan were also quite good - the former obviously quite hefty while the latter proved far lighter than other versions offered in town, the XO just boozy enough to give it some kick while the unrefined sugar syrup helped soften the blow.  Clearly given the VIP treatment, and as such sampling a far greater swath of the menu than the average duo possibly could, the food that Chef Willey is creating at Canonita is at once almost universally approachable yet at the same time bold and complicated in a way that few other Casino-based ethnic restaurants would dare.  Admittedly underwhelmed by more routine plates like guacamole, queso fundido, as well as carne asada and still perplexed as to why the restaurant would outsource something like tortilla chips when executing more complex items so well there is no doubt that a great meal can be had at Canonita by those willing to venture away from the tried and True, particularly when taking into account the vibe and the view.",

We were seated immediately well not immediately there was some confusion with the staff as they circled each other searching for purpose.  Our server was pleasant but there were gaps in delivery. For instance we asked for onions and tomatoes on the side and the tacos were delivered with them right on top. Luckily, the onions were big chunks that could be easily removed. We ordered an avocado, since there guacamole is made in the morning, not fresh to order. The avocado was delivered late and keep in mind this is just avocado in a bowl not a fancy presentation. The salsa was salty and not that interesting. With all of the above why am I rating a 4 ... because the tacos were delicious! We ordered a trio: pork, chicken, and beef. Good stuff. Keep in mind you're in Vegas and everything on the strip is more than off the strip. So don't complain about the prices ;)",

Our reservation was for a small table facing the screen to watch the Pack play the Cardinals,  when we arrived they tried to seat us out by the canal.  When we made the reservation from a seat at the bar 2 hours earlier the hostess wrote down our request and over the next two hours it was forgotten.  Hence the 4 star and not 5. These folks work quickly and with a smile when you sit at the bar which is where we ended up again. The Mahi, and Mexico Citi Enchiladas were very good. The drinks were well done for a happy hour, and totally acceptable.  Sitting at the bar, while not what was planned was just fine for us. We will be back..",

    "text": "This was an almost daily happy hour haunt for me on my week long Vegas voyage and I'm really upset I didn't get to eat an actual meal here. So this review is mostly for the bar.  The happy hour is from 3-6pm and 9pm-close. $3 wells and beers and $5 margaritas and specialty drinks, one of which was a Long Island Iced Tea!   There is a bartender who is there almost daily and while he is seemingly polite and friendly he is absolutely buried all the time. Hire this guy some help! And be nice to him, he works hard.  The margaritas are pretty good, not quite as artisinal as some places but good ingredients and a nice amount of the strong stuff. The long islands are served in a short glass but have plenty of kick for the price. Just a great spot to start the day-drinking off right.  The food I was lucky enough to try was awesome. The salsa is made with roasted chilis and has an amazing depth of flavor. Some of my favorite ever. The queso is ridiculous. Get it with the jalapenos and bask in a bowl of awesome cheese. I do wish they gave you more tortillas with it. If you combine it with the salsa you will not be disappointed.  Everything else on the menu sounded really awesome and I will have to eat an actual meal here on my next trip out. It's a favorite.",

The brownie dessert was also rather indulgent and I could have had another.  Service was just ok, our waitress seemed a little timid and checked on us only once or twice, but it was fine, the manager made a round that compensated for it.   This was the least expensive of our dinners in Vegas, but we enjoyed it thoroughly. It was also a leaner tab as we were done with drinking by that point.
