I can't tell if it smells like a dirty kitty litter box, horse stables, or some hippy's armpit. Sorry to say, I will never eat there again.",

    "text": "So I've been here two other times before and loved it. This time, however, was a different story all together. Maybe it was because my husband and I finally decided to buy the groupon that has been on there for weeks, but either way, our experience was less than desirable. The staff said hello pleasantly enough when we came in, but then the guy taking our order started to have a bad attitude and not listen. My husband knew exactly what he wanted, what type of meat on his wrap, etc., and ordered it that way. The guy then (nearly screaming, mind you) asked him at least three more times while making the wrap if he wanted chicken or steak. We had our kids and their friend with us also (maybe the larger group caused the bad attitude?  Not sure) and the guy did the same thing to my son a few times, as well. We got combos on the meals (majority of them) and when we got to check out, my husband presented the groupon. The girl then told us with the groupon we couldn't get the combos. We were a little confused as to why we couldn't get fries and a drink and had to ask her several times before she managed to properly explain that the combo was a 'special deal' and we could only do one deal per transaction. We told her that's fine then and to ring the fries and drinks up separately. We still wanted those regardless of price. It took quite a while to get the fries, which was fine as we ate our actual food until then, but the steak shawarma itself was actually not that great this time. It was dry and kind of crusty, and I myself had a terrible stomach ache the rest of the night like I was going to be sick. The worst part was they kept belittling another employee in there in front of us and ignoring him by speaking Spanish to each other and kept telling him to get in the back. In Spanish they'd say they didn't want him up front with them and to send him in the back. Honestly this visit really upset me because the other times I absolutely loved this place but I don't feel like I'd go back now due to this experience. Maybe it was a bad day for these guys but it definitely produced terrible service and a not so great meal.",

Unfortunately this is a really bad one. 4 stars? Wow! What are people thinking? This place is horrible! Salad was old and full of water with nothing else really. Whatever that white sauce with cucumbers in it I believe was nasty. I'm assuming it was a type of taziki sauce. Chicken is fine if u like unseasoned meat just grilled. I expected more marination of sorts. Basically no effort except cutting chicken and putting it on the grill. My girlfriend bought two meals. I had the chicken kabob. The yellow rice is completely tasteless. I could buy one of those instant rice packets at the store and been more satisfied for .99 cents. Not sure how this place is still in business. Wouldn't go back for free. I would not recommend it to anyone! If you think this is even half way decent food from anywhere, well I feel sorry for you and I should make you a meal that would easily surpass this place with just about zero effort. Just to let everyone know I had no expectations of this place good or bad. I would be happy to help the owners for free to provide a better product. I work for a very large hospitality company that serves all kinds of food and different types of experiences. This has to be one of the worst places I ever ate and paid for it. I'm a food and beverage manager in Vegas who is from Chicago and let me say this food needs a lot of help. Save your money. Really, if you need help I'd give my consultation for free if wanted. In fact I wouldn't mind a refund if possible. Sorry:(",

I got the same exact entree but I felt that the steak was overdone and dry. The rice and salad are your standard Mediterranean fare. I really loved the homemade cucumber chiller. Their hummus and tzatziki sauce were delicious. We also ordered the Parsley fries with feta and parsley on top, and that was excellent.   Customer service was good; the young lady at the counter who helped us was friendly. When we were leaving an older lady came out from the back and said goodbye to us. It was a nice feeling.  All in all, I felt like there were hits and misses with the menu but there seems to be many options to choose from that can make or break your experience. For my husband, it's a winner. For me, not so much.",

Although next time, no fresh onions with the nachos!  - Reminds me of a Mediterranean style Chipotle! - Hummus was great. I loved the olives and it comes with extra pita bread. - Some of the pita breads were hard to open and when I did, it ripped. xD - Although the pita chips appeared burnt, they were really tasty and good.  - The steak was very flavorful. The chicken, however, was somewhat dry. The hummus sauce did the trick!  - The meat are carved thin and marinated on a vertical skewer. Great aromatic flavors.",

I ordered the falafel salad, expecting it to be like a Greek salad with falafel on top. Not even close. When I asked about different dressings (wanting a more traditional Greek style dressing) they were at a loss. And the falafel was burnt, which made the whole thing a throw away. All that and it cost me about what it would at a good Mediterranean restaurant.   I'm giving it two stars because maybe they had an off day, or I just ordered the wrong thing here (I'm hoping the meat selections fare better). I wouldn't go back.",

We wanted a side of chicken curry to go and she kept insisting on giving me a combo plate.  I finally had to raise my voice and tell her very sternly I ONLY WANT A SIDE, NO COMB.  She was very annoyed.  This is the rudest service I've ever had and unfortunately it does not look like management reads reviews as I've not seen any responses to other reviews so nothing will change here.  I do not recommend this place unless you have patience to deal with them because you will not be treated respectfully here.  I wish you the best of you choose to go here.",

Then I stood and watched her dump part of the food that my friend didn't want back into the buffet style bar, huffing and puffing with anger. My friend asks for cucumbers on her salad, the lady ignores her and slides the plate to the next employee, then my friend again says to her she's like cucumbers. I thought the employee was going to flip out. She threw some cucumbers on top of her salad. The food was overly salted in my opinion, nothing special at all.  Wouldn't return.",

Now, on to my falafel bowl. A metal container full of iceberg lettuce and more of the \"red cabbage\" chickpeas, cucumbers and \"spicy carrots\" which are actually just plain carrot sticks, no spice. Falafel was kind of dry and hard, I know this because I can taste actual blood in my mouth from trying to chew it. I'm assuming the iceberg is being served in place of Romaine at the moment (I hope at least) this is being priced at $8 and it honestly worth maybe $5. The best part of the entire meal was the side of Tzatziki sauce. I most likely will never order food from this place again and they should be quite embarrassed of themselves.",

I got the chicken shishkabob plate with the cucumber yogurt sauce. Everything about this plate was PERFECT. Even better then the memories I had of this food back in New York. This is by far the best plate of Mediterranean food I've had to date. The chicken was charred evenly. The salad was super fresh and not welted like some places. And the rice was cooked at a fantastic al dente. Mic that yummy yogurt sauce onto every bite and it's like combo flavor heaven. Will definitely be back to try everything on the menu.",

Apparently now they're open until 9 so I can make the trip! It's my favorite Mediterranean fast casual restaurant by far. It's similar to Chipotle in process. The meats are cooked on a rotisserie and shaved off, and the chicken I've had is thinly sliced and delicious. Most recently I had their falafel which is deep fried to order and not too dried out. Their wraps use gigantic pieces of pita and get stuffed full of goodies such as lettuce, carrots, onions, cabbage, hummus, hot or mild sauce, and tahini or tzatziki sauce. Seriously this thing will feed you for two meals. I've had the bowl too which comes with all of the above minus hummus plus rice. They have extras like olives but they are kind of spendy at $1.00 a piece and can add up quickly. You really don't need any. The customer service is friendly and they're always hustlin to get you through the line quick. Definitely recommend Parsley for anyone looking for a huge, healthy, and delicious meal.",

Since I moved over here in the state I was locking for authentic food like that.  I am from Middle East and I can recommend that with close eyes . They gave a small tiny modern. Kick to the traditional food without any compromise In taste  Consider it as  chipotle for middle eastern food but very  authentic    I do recommend humus sharwerma bowl with some fried eggplant . I tried it wit tahini , I would say try it better with Greek zasiki.   My wife had chicken shawarma and was great also   I will write this review in different languages since I love both food and languages ;) lol  Para empezar soy Arabe y me gusta comer todo. Este lugar fantastico y muy original . El pan es fresco hecho adentro y tiene blanco y integral. A mi me gusta el segundo mas. Es mi fijo parece hasta una tortilla mexicana grande. Pero sabe diferente .  El humus es fresco hecho en casa y tambien la shawarma    ( el pincho redondo de pollo y carne )  La gente son amable y muy servicial . Hasta John el americano blanco habla espanol ( mi respeto John ) ere super amable .  Usted puede compartir tal vez el plato mezclado con su pareja porque son generosos y servian  bastante . Yo soy comilon.  Lo comi casi solo. Loooool  Tuve  en Vegas 2 experiencias una excelente de este sitio y otra pesima de un restaurante Indo a lo cual escribi tambien una   -------------  Portugues   Uma lanchonete muito boa. Gostei de tudo . Eu sou arabe e gosto muito de comer.  Este lugar era autentico fresco y limpo , o pao , humus, shaweram tudo sao feitos a casa .  ------------ Auf Deutsch  Ich kann Ihnen nur dienen Laden empfehlen. Der Doner ( auf Turkisch aber  auf arabisch heiet  shawermea) ist frech gemacht auch das Brot und der humus.   Was mir extra gefallen ist dass, das Volkern Brot. Ist ein Art Fladen Brot.   I'm laden gepackten in frisch.y  Ich glaube der Laden biete israelische Kuche ( ist auch der lebensechte Kuche manchmal sehr nah )   Die Mitarbeiter sind nett und sehr hoflich .  Echt ein muss .schade dass ich die Falafel nicht probiert habe        .     .       .     .         .       .  .      .

The hummus was a little different and trust me, I've had a lot of hummus different places over the years but it grew on me, not sure what they do different but I did end up liking it.

    "text": "I stopped into this place out of pure convenience yesterday.  I happened to be sitting right in front of it when I did a search for vegan food in Vegas.  So I asked myself, \"Why not?\".    I was greeted by a friendly, smiling man; the one in the video.  It's a small, casual place but seemed very clean.   It's set up sort of like a Subway.  I wasn't familiar with some of the choices so they gave me a taste of a few different options and reassured me several times that what they served me had no animal products in it.  (I did notice that there were meat options available) I opted for a Falafel bowl, which was 6 falafel patties on a bed of rice over fresh greens.  I chose sides of babaganoush, cucumber, tomato and a small bit of tabouli, all topped with a creamy tahini dressing.  It was a huge lunch, but it was a wonderful blend of fresh flavors.   I can't wait to go back again!   If you haven't been here, you should definitely give it a try.",

I ordered 2 small steak wraps, with 2 combos of fries and a drink.When I went to pay, the cashier looked confused, which I didn't understand because I had used groupon before with no issues. She then called over another lady (who had a rude attitude) that told me I couldn't use the groupon with a combo (fries and a drink). I was confused because it doesn't even say that on the groupon. However, I didn't want to cause any issues so I just let them charge me for the wraps, fries and one drink at their regular price. They overcharged me because the total for my food was $24.68, which means I only needed to pay them $4.68 since my groupon value was good for $20. I ended up paying $9.46 instead. I really think the cashier had no idea what she was doing. Also, it was difficult to communicate with the staff because it seemed like they didn't understand English so well.  They also had problems adding my purchases onto the Perka app that they advertise to use. Overall, I felt cheated and I will not be returning to this place anytime soon. Beware if you are using groupon!",

She was slicing the meat, putting the food together, cashiering, and in to help us, then the lady behind us (who wasn't so polite, & we all know handling impolite people takes patience and time). Amazing! I always enjoy watching hard workers. Not to mention the food was great.  The only reason I give this 4/5 stars is I saw another person \"working\" but she didn't seem to be of much help nor did her customer service seem to be up to par. She was kind of forgetful. She had to ask my wife a few times if she wanted wheat or white bread for her wrap, but thank goodness the First Lady I mentioned made up for it all. Do try this place!",

    "text": "Everyone back in SoCal has been going crazy over The Halal Guys but I don't think these two places are that much different from each other (minus the hot sauce and white sauce from The Halal guys).   I bought a $16 voucher on groupon (paid $7.50 because of a coupon code) and ended up paying $2 out of pocket for a beef and chicken bowl.   What's the difference between a bowl and a plate? The girl working told us that the plate separates everything while a bowl has salad first then rice, whatever veggies you put on and then the meat.   The salad had a light vinegrette dressing on it, not sure what it was but it definitely wasn't heavy. The salad we got looked fresh and not all wilted. I asked the girl working what people can put in their bowls and she said pickled carrots, cabbage, and garbanzo beans. I love their picked carrots!! Ask for them on the side because you'll get more that way. We didn't, and they were so stingy with the carrots!! I was afraid they weren't going to give us a lot of meat because of the way she was cutting the meat but it turned out to be a good amount. They have two different sauces, one is a cucumber sauce and the other is a sesame sauce... Not sure what the names were but I got both sauces. My friend and I both liked the cucumber one more, the sesame one was kind of plain for us. But you can try both and see which one you like better. If you want hot sauce, just ask for it and they'll give it to you.   Without the groupon the beef/ chicken plates or bowls would be $8.99. They have some vegetarian and vegan options too and good deals on Tuesdays.",

They also have an appetizer and specialty menu- the curry and nachos are good! Always choose steak, always choose Tzatziki.  My only complaint is that when we ordered chicken curry they offered us half chicken and half  steak so that we could \"try both curries.\" We expected the two curries to be put on opposite sides, but instead they put the curries on top of eachother....... like, directly on top of eachother. So if you do get ask for half and half, make sure you specify that you want them separated haha. I'm still confused.  The curries are spicy, ask for a sample before you commit! The steak bowl is like a Chipotle bowl, but with Tzatziki instead of salsa and yellow rice instead of white. Same concept of ordering.",

They give you plenty of food for what you pay for and you can tell the ingredients are super fresh. The wait is usually pretty short, but it does get busy around lunch time just like any other place. The employees are always really nice and you can tell that they enjoy working there, which makes the experience way better. Jo is the manager there, and one of the main reasons why I keep going! Awesome service, great food, A+!",

I ordered the falafel plate with taboulleh, baba ghanouj, and rice and salad. Nothing tasted authentic, the rice was a bit lumpy and not fresh tasting. The falafel's were probably the best thing in this combo, and they were mediocre at best. Taboulleh was a bit soggy and nowhere near lemony enough. Baba G was not smoky, just bland. I'm pretty disappointed, although I do think for something so simple... I have eaten at so many places that screw this meal up. Add this to that list. The prices are reasonable,and the service is decent. But the food certainly doesn't warrant any reason to return.  Cest la vie, Parsley...",

    "text": "I like how this restaurant is easy to find, it's on the corner of E Pecos Rd and E Sunset Rd and it's a short walk to Starbucks. It is a small place with reasonable seating but the food taste amazing. You have a choice to make your meal as a bowl, plate, a wrap, or sandwich.   I chose Chicken Shawarma Plate ($9.49) with Yellow Rice and Fresh Crisp Salad. The carved chicken has a slight hint of crispiness which taste yummy when you eat it with tzatziki. The yellow rice is fluffy and good. I selected every topping for the fresh crisp salad, it has romaine lettuce, dice cucumber, dice tomato, red onion, chickpeas, red cabbage slaw, parsley, crunchy slice carrots, and a mild green spicy sauce. Also I ordered the Chicken Curry ($3.99) which comes with soft tender chicken, green bell pepper, tomato, and the gravy taste creamy and flavorful. The eggplant ($1.00) is serve as a cold savory side and it has red bell pepper. I wish I had more of the delicious eggplant. And they offer Baklava ($1.99) for dessert. I had two different kind of Baklava: one with whole almonds and chocolate drizzle, and one with almond filling topped with almond slice. Both baklava have honey but the one with whole almonds and chocolate drizzle is a better choice, I like that it has a nice sweet and tasty crunch.  On the wall they have a canvas of rich, vivid imagery of spices and herbs. There are at least 5 to 6 tables and a side window seating. And when the weather is nice and sunny, you can enjoy your meal outdoor dining on one of their colorful rustic metal table. While dining in, they were playing upbeat music like Janet Jackson \"Escapade\" and it brings back fond memories of the 90's. The service is nice and the people are friendly. For a plate they give you a generous portion at a good price. It does get super busy around lunch hour but the food here is definitely worth trying.",

If you greet the staff here a \"hello how are you\" they just ignore & just want to know your order. I agree with another Yelper who also reviewed this place that they all have a \"well what do you want\" type of attitude. When I went during lunch time , they had a semi-busy line - woman giving me toppings for my chicken sharwma bowl just looked at me , made it seem like everything you see behind the glass you can put in your bowl. At cash register , cashier wanted to charged me extra for feta cheese & referred me to the glass print when the lady who was handling my food shouldve told me what I want is extra before putting in my bowl & refer me to the side glass menu at that exact moment. I don't look at that glass print (I'm looking at the food behind glass lol) esp when line is moving fast & I already chose what entree/meat I want. I just know avocado is extra anywhere you go. No matter how busy it is or how fast you want line to go , staff should always communicate with customers.",

They had items on their menu I didn't typically associate with Mediterranean food -- nachos, curries, and baguette sandwiches. So there you go: your culturally infused bits of Mexico, Thailand, and France just in case you were experiencing a food conflict and didn't know where to go.  You will find that bowls and plates cost the same. What's the difference? Bowls have everything mixed in, while plates keep everything separate. You will also discover that no lamb or goat is served here, their main meats are either beef or chicken, which roast vertically on a turning spit. I believe they have tuna options for all the pescatarians in the house, and of course, falafel is indeed served here for all the veggie-heads.  I originally wanted to get the chicken shiskabob plate, but she said it would take about 10 minutes to cook and offered the chicken shawarma instead. I took it, but it was the wrong decision -- the sliced pieces of meat were cold and on the dry side. It was nearing the end of the day, so that may be why... but still, no excuse. I'd say wait and get the kabob! Tzatziki sauce, too.   My bf ordered the chicken curry served with rice. It reminded me of Thai yellow curry, but with an overpowering coconut flavor. Not really my style. I noticed that gyros aren't served here, but again, it's not a Greek place. Instead you'll find they have wraps and baguette options. Oh, try their cucumber chiller drink. It's light and refreshing.  PS -- Get the Groupon! Valid at two locations.",

I'm not doing a good job selling this place, but you have to try it.  This tiny restaurant on Pecos, in a massive parking lot has a variety to satisfy the taste buds.  I guess you either like it or you don't.  The kebobs are not sitting out, but in it's own refrigerated section.  The skewer is a decent size and I would consider it a generous portion for the price point.    I'm totally into their chicken curry here.  It's a bowl of coconut milk, spiciness with thin strips of chicken and all the fresh parsley my bowl can hold.  The basmati rice is so fluffy, I'm glad it's all soaked in my curry sauce to make it that much more satisfying.  My husband really enjoys their chicken shawarma bowl, with some free added ingredients and some for an up charge.   Their nachos are made with fried pita bread and their seasoning for their chicken is totally on point with me.  I really enjoy their tzatziki sauce, so I don't mind throwing that into the mix of it all.  They have their own version of hot sauce, a bit too spicy for me, but a little would go a long way.    Prices are fair, but the running Groupon deal makes it that much more sweeter to try a new place.  The workers were nice, super patient and it made our visit quite pleasant on both occasions. It's a little of a trek for us, but definitely a must return restaurant for us to keep in our rotation.  They are part of the Perka app, so check-in for free appetizer and future rewards as stated on the receipt.  Enjoy!",

She looked irritated while I was looking at the menu. When I did end up ordering a falafel bowl, she piled everything into the bowl. The attitude here, as mentioned in a previous review, is \"sooo what do you want?\" No exaggeration, she put at least a cup of hummus on top of my whopping amount of lettuce. She drenched it all in yogurt. When ended up throwing everything away. It ended up being an overpriced salad with way too much dressing.",

Also, have one favorite there- forgot to ask her name she is the sweetest and lovely , I saw her last night. I would definitely recommend this restaurant because the service was really good and they have vegan options too  which why I keep on coming  back here. Food was very good and reasonably price.

It made me very happy.  2 stars= for their even more flavorful steak.  I've had their steak shwarma salad and I was even more content with the outcome than I was with chicken.  But chicken is probably the best for your body!  3 stars = parsley.  Lots of parsley.  I never thought to add this stuff to my salad, but what a great combination they have made with their salad.  Lots of cucumber cubes too!  Their salads here are really fresh, and they hav 2 types of dressings to choose from.  Both are really tasty.  4 stars = check your Groupon NOW deals.  They are always on there offering great deals!  This place is great for a quick and healthy lunch.  Their helpings are fairly large so you will definitely be fulfilled!  If you're into Baklava, they have Chocolate Baklava.  Yelp Challenge! Started 8/20/2011 (63/365).",

I usually go with the shwarma chicken wrap, but I'm also a fan of the specials. Last time I had the chicken curry which was out of this world flavorful. The closest I've found to something I enjoyed in Morocco. The seasoned fries are good which isn't a good thing for me and my bikini so I pass on that goodness MOST of the time. Also a fan of the falafel. It's the best I've ever had. Just dip that lovin' in their homemade tzakiki and you are straight money!   The staff is always friendly and accommodating. No attitudes here. Just smiles and quick service. Also, the restaurant itself is always spotless. Only prob is they close at 8pm when I am still unwinding and not ready to grub, yet. No biggie.   Do yourself and whoever sees you naked a favor and get your Parsley on.",

The menu didn't include a description of any of the items and they seemed annoyed when I asked what came in 2 of them. I ordered a chicken salad, my husband had the chicken bowl and my kids shared a plate. I had to ask for them to put tomatoes and cucumber in my salad, I guess it comes with just lettuce and chicken? My kids love olives and to get a couple on the chicken plate it costs extra. My husband ordered the bowl and it's strange, there's no rice or anything, just chicken and hummus and chick pea. He decided to buy a side of pita chips but they were stale and disgusting. He immediately took them back. No apology was given, the lady actually looked pissed that he said anything. She gave him fries instead but was really weird about it. None of the food had much flavor and the pita bread was really chewy. I wouldn't be surprised if some of the good reviews are from friends or family of the owners because there was absolutely nothing \"4 star\" about this place. I would definitely not return. The Great Greek and even Stephano's are a million times better, the staff are polite and the food actually has flavor.",

I can't even eat this salad so it was a waist .. but I will be back to try it again Because I was craving it .. this place is really good if not so hot ... one more thing they could of sold me on so much more if they would or asked if I wanted anything else I would of got some hummus.. and added olives but I felt awkward because when I asked to add the cheese she made it seem like it was a bad thing an that it would be a additional 1.00 but that's not a bad a bad price she should of said it more positively. On a plus note if your hungry the portions a big almost two meals can be made of one salad. The first time I ate there I had a chicken plate which was delicious the second time I think it was a bowl that I had it was a lot of yummy crunchy lettuce with rice and chicken !! Super good",

    "text": "#latereview 8/13/2015  I came here after hearing so much about it from a couple of friends and I was in the mood for Mediterranean, so I decided to come check them out.  It was such a hassle trying to find the place. I even walked in to a different restaurant, thanks Google maps fail! Haha. But after finding the restaurant I decided to go right in.  I ordered the Chicken Curry and a side of hummus and pita chips.  Chicken Curry  - 4/5  The flavor was ok. I wasn't a big fan of it, but I wasn't unimpressed either. The flavor, although ok, felt like it was lacking something... that extra oomph that would make me want to come back and try something else on their menu. On the bright side, the Asian in Mr enjoyed the saffron rice more than the main entree itself, so I'll give them that. Rice was fluffy and not soggy. The rice was the saving grace of this dish.  Hummus and Pita Chips - 4/5  No matter where I go and try different forms of hummus, I will always be critical because I have been spoiled by a fellow coworker and friend's hummus. Yes I understand that Tahini is part of the ingredient but I am very partial to garbanzo beans. I want to taste the garbanzo and tahini working together, not just straight out tahini. And yes I am an avid salt user but the pita chips had to give me pause as it was a little bit too much salt for me.  If the craving for Mediterranean hits me again, this will not be the first thing that pops in to my mind. But if I'm in the area doing errands, I will definitely give them a try again.",

    "text": "Ordered through uber eats (google discount codes!). I was happy with the experience. Not sure if it's the restaurant's responsibility, but I would appreciate more pictures of the menu items.   Appetizer size falafel - 6 pieces on top of hummus. Good serving size for the price. Both falafel and hummus a tad too salty. Ate with pita and it was more than satisfactory.   Parsley Nachos with chicken - Big chunks of shredded chicken, feta cheese, tzatziki, and a sprinkle of tomato, cucumber, & cilantro. Seasoned fried pita chips were slightly too salty. Portion can be a meal or appetizer for 2-3 people. Overall pretty good; would order again.  Steak shawarma bowl - thinly sliced steak; good seasoning, but was dry and there were some chewy/grisly pieces. Steak was piled on yellow (saffron? couldn't tell) rice and salad. Also came with a side of tzatziki. This would be great if the meat was better.   \"Beef Kabob\" plate - was expecting cubes of beef, but when I opened the container I was like, \"oh, I guess it's more like kofta (formed ground meat)\". But then it wasn't like any kofta I've had :( the meat had a dry, more congealed texture like a sausage, as a matter of fact, my husband said, \"this kinda tastes like a hot dog\". Plate came with yellow rice, salad, and a side of tzatziki. Would not order again.  2 orders of baklava - this looked and tasted like the baklava a former boss of mine ordered from Sinbad Sweets to give as holiday gifts. Point is, did not look and taste like it was made in-house.   Our order also came with 2 foil packets of pita (4 half pieces each). Not sure which items these were supposed to accompany. They came warm, which is a plus.",

The nachos come with certain toppings, but they don't tell you what,  and you have to pay $1.00 extra if you want something else added on.  I had to pay for rice, hummus, olives, extra garlic sauce, etc.  I was not expecting this because the place I usually go to in Henderson is same price for a bowl no matter how many ingredients you add.   The place is very small and they don't have a good flow.  It is Chipolte style service but very crammed.  There was a huge line but the workers were trying to fill call in and delivery orders at the same time. I'm only giving 2 stars for the following reasons....paying extra for toppings, serving romaine lettuce during an e-coli outbreak, and the confusing ordering process.  They earned the 2 stars for the fact that there beef and chicken are cooked and served from a spit and the portions are very generous.",

They cook the kababs and falafels after you place your order. Once they are about to get ready you get to choose a bowl,wrap, or plate option. I got the bowl and they piled it up with rice and salad and other accoutrements at my request. Try the pickled carrots for a kick (spicy! And so good!!). $1 extra for hummus. The bowl comes with either tahini or  Tzatziki sauce but I got both. I love the tzatziki.   The appetiser falafel option comes with hummus and 6 falafels.   Check in on yelp for a baklava!   I was visiting from LA for work and I was in the area for two days and we went to this place two days in a row, it is that good.  This place does NOT serve alcohol. But the drink they have on the counter (usually a cucumber mint lemonade but not overly sweetened) is really refreshing!  There is very little seating inside and it can get chaotic when there are more than 4 people trying to grab food but they are trying really hard and the food is amazing. I hope they thrive.",

That's a bit annoying but the food still tastes great.  The service is slightly below average. They are inconsistent and they seem to like to cut corners to save money (even though you are paying for the food). For example, the salad is supposed to come with pita bread, but you always have to ask because they always \"forget\" to give it to you.... or are they just trying to save money even though your meal is supposed to include the pita bread? Also, they aren't completely friendly or helpful if you have questions when ordering.   I have continued going back because I do like the food the service is something I just thought I'd mention.",

    "text": "So after watching The Avengers I was a bit curious as to what Shawarma was, I did not understand Iron Man's craving for this magical \"Shawarma\" but I was intrigued and determined to find out.   On a day out with my mom we could not decide what we wanted to eat, but I was starving for something different. She said we could eat Greek, something something chicken, at first I was hesitant, \"chicken\", it's not my favorite meat, but I was up for the challenge. As soon as we got to Parsley during this monsoon-like Las Vegas weather a huge raindrop landed in my eye, I guess it must have been good luck that I was visually impaired, it was indeed a sign from Zeus himself saying \"Feast on the nectar of the Gods my dear child.\".  Luckily this place not only has Chicken Shawarma but also Beef Shawarma so I opted for the latter in wrap form with all the works and an added treat of those beautiful olives. The serving size was more than enough for me, I could only eat half my wrap, and beware these wraps can get messy.  This place is on an popping on those rainy days I might add with all sorts of people, it's kinda cool. The customer service is really great! Lots of friendly people.   The layout if this place is pretty small. I'd say 30 people max? There is outdoor seating though.  For those who say \"Ehh, it's not the best Shawarma.\" I wonder what really good quality Shawarma taste like because this is just fabulous.   Sorry for this mini epic, but now I know what Iron Man was on about, we should listen more often ;)",

FYI: their beef and chicken is not halal but their falafel is a great option if you have diet restrictions.  It felt like we were at Chipotle but mediteranean style.  You get in line....you can choose from a wrap (white or wheat), bowl or sandwich.  Option of mild, medium or hot sauce.  I chose all. LOL.  then the vegetables, etc....  I ordered the steak wrap.

The bad: -The falafels and salad are heavy on the oil. The fried chickpea patties tend to absorb too much of the frying oil. The taste was magnificent though. I like that they serve it with hummus for dipping. The salad needed more acid instead of base. -Peanuts are used in the baklava and overpowers the walnuts. Instead of pistachios, Parsley uses peanuts and that is all you can taste. Honey is not a big component of the dessert and it comes out kind of dry. It just reminds me of the peanut toffees you get at the Asian markets.  I was amazed that I ordered everything for less than $18. I ended up taking so much of it home. With a few customized request, I could see myself loving Parsley.",

    "text": "I'm sad. I love Mediterranean food and was probably spoiled at the variety and quality of the ones find in the Washington D.C.  and northern Virginia area. However, now that Las Vegas is my home, I am constantly searching for more places to love. I've been to this restaurant about a year and a half ago, it seemed they had just opened and so I was willing to overlook the lack of customer service and mediocre food. This time I returned around mid day and once again stood around while the employees worked in front of me without helping. I mentioned that I wasn't familiar with the menu and still no assistance. Finally I decided on the pita nachos with meat. The meat looked like Gyro style. The plate itself looked good, with cucumbers, tomato, onion and tzatziki sauce and meat. That was the biggest let down. Just like the first time, the meat was full of tendon, rubbery gristle. What's worse is it was barely like warm. Shocking that this place gets good reviews. Maybe it's the veggies, they look good. Sadly, I'm not about to return.",

In my opinion very very good wraps always looks fresh and clean and their salads are actual salads,  not just a whole bunch of cheap lettuce and a few shredded carrot pieces.   If you like shawarma- definitely try this place.",

Employees were very helpful and even let me sample the shawarma. Ended up going with the chicken kabob bowl, which takes a few extra minutes to prepare, but was worth the wait. The meat was so juicy and flavorful. I also love those little picked carrots they serve. So tasty! I would love to have one of these closer to where I live.",

    "text": "I was led here by Emily R. who posted the most DELICIOUS looking photo of a wrap from Parsley, so I purchased the Groupon and off we went to Parsley. For our family of 4 (2 adults & 2 small children), we ordered a ton of food, but were able to finish it all, and without the Groupon, the total would have come out to about $40.  My husband ordered a large steak shwarma wrap combo on wheat (I love that it is an option), I got the chicken shwarma salad, the kids shared our food plus falafel, and two baklavas (squares, not cigars). When I went to pay, I was told that the combo is not valid with the Groupon. She told me she could charge for the side of fries separately, until I told her to charge the combo separately because the side of fries was $4.00 + change whereas the combo upgrade was $2 + change. She also charged me $.50 for olives on my salad, and $.50 for chickpeas even though the guy said it was free. Also $.50 for tzatziki sauce. They seriously nickel and dime you here. We got a soda cup which came with the combo, but their soda machine doesn't offer water... They do however, have a fridge full of bottled drinks that DOES include water... They also do not freely give out napkins, so you have to wait until someone is available if you want more than the 1 they gave you... It seems like very very cheap management happening in this establishment.   The food was alright. The salad mix came pre-mixed and was very very wet. I like being able to control the amount of dressing on my salad, but overall, the flavors were very fresh and the chicken was alright. My husband's wrap was better than mine which was layered with hummus, their salad mix, and steak. He did not love it however. I enjoyed the couple of bites I took but didn't want the carb bomb that came with the 16\" tortilla. The falafel and hummus were tasty and a generous serving for the price. Lastly, when I ordered the baklava, the girl told me that the cigars have no nuts and only cinnamon. I was confused as to how that could be a baklava, but took her word on it because my son is allergic to peanuts and they were unable to answer \"Do these have peanuts?\" We were later told that they do have nuts in them, although uncertain as to what kind, plus the cinnamon. Whatever. We just got some. There was no honey on them which made the filo dry, but the nut mix inside was yummy. There is just SUCH better baklava other places in town (Manan Bakery!).   Overall, we'll be passing on another visit to Parsley. I think the food looks better than it tastes.",

I'm not the kind of \"regular\" where the employees should know my name and I theirs, but every time I go in during the weekday and during my lunch break (somewhere between 12-2 P.M.) the employees who greet and serve me are so friendly and patient (which is helpful because I don't always know what I want right away - too many yummy options!).  Also, my first time there I really wanted to try the Hummus, but the guy at the counter stopped me and warned me that Hummus is (generously) put on their shawarma before the rest of the ingredients- not many places will do that and try to trick you into buying the extras so I appreciated that!",

We ordered two Large Chicken Shawarma wrap combos.  Chose seasoned fries for the side and a small fountain drink you can refill.  The shawarma was pretty good. The wraps were huge. I noticed they had garlic paste so asked for some and the server slapped some of that in before wrapping them up.  Love the garlic paste!  Enuf greens and decent amount of meat.  Have to say I'm used to having more meat vs greens and other fillings.  But it was a nice balance.  The fries were much better than most burger joints!  Nicely crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.  Came with their special mayo/thousand dipping sauce which complimented the fries very well.  Will definitely come back!  Piece out!!!",

    "text": "Parsely let me count the ways... One of my all time lunch favorites this places is literally out the back door of my salon.  One of us from work eats here daily sometime up to 8 of us.   Such a healthy option to the burger and fries.  I absolutely love the Shwarma the way it slow roasts on the spit.  Mmmmm so good.  I don't eat a whole lot of red meat but the Steak and the Chicken here is seasoned so perfectly.  I usually get a Steak and Chicken Shwarma.  The tzatziki and hummus on it with the fresh veggies just finish it off I like to get mine with a bit of the spicy green sauce.  BTW the Shwarmas are so big I usually get two meals out of it.  So the Shwarma is a treat for me I usually opt for Salad wich usually leaves me hungry again in an hour but here with all the toppings and meat it fills me up, the dressing here is REALY good.  I've also had the Tagine a slow cooked stew, basically the meat falls apart in your mouth it's so tender.  The Falafel here ranks in the top 3 that I have ever had.  You can also get fries seasoned or unseasoned.  The seasoning here on everything is perfect, the staff are nice and smile while feeding you the decor is modern yet inviting.  This is a local guy living his dream, which I will continue to support the little guy in a big buiness world.  By the way they also have a punch card where you get a certain amount you get the next one free be sure to ask for it at the register.  As I said Parsely let me count the ways Mmmmm...",

The way the place is arranged does not really leave much room for a line of people. My daughter had the chicken shawarma wrap and I had the steak. First thing, the wraps didn't look appetizing at all. They just looked kind of blah. The first bite I took, the steak was hard and chewy. I had dispose of it in my napkin. I had to repeat that on several other bites that were just too tough to be edible. Also, there was too much sauce. I don't like my wraps dry so it takes a lot of sauce for me to say there is too much. My daughter did better with her chicken but she  said there was a few bites that tasted like there was sand in them. Needless to say , I will not be returning.",

Then, we saw the young woman behind the counter use a rag to clean either the floor or the clean-up sink behind her (we can't remember which), and THEN use the same rag to clean around the bins of food.

Scheduled for an 11:30am arrival and actually besting that number by a few minutes by way of EZCater, a plethora of Styrofoam and plastic clamshells brought up to the third floor in one trip using a push-cart and thick cardboard boxes, it was from containers containing Beef, Chicken or Vegetable Wraps plus Fries and Desserts that attendees took their pick, seasoned Spuds unfortunately suffering some sogginess thanks to the warm temperature inside the packaging but nicely flavored just the same.   Moving next to Pita Bread, an item intended to accompany Plates served with Rice and Salad, it was with cool Yogurt and Cucumber Dip that rounds softer than prior were topped, the same creamy Dressing found inside of Wraps available in Wheat or White surrounding fresh Vegetables, Chickpeas, Cheese and thick-cut Beef Kabob or thinly sliced Chicken Shawarma that was as juicy as it was rich with herbal aromatics.  Only suggesting \"assorted\" Baklava as Dessert, the housemade collection actually including traditional Date Cookies and several unique styles of crispy Phyllo packed and stacked with Walnuts, Pistachios, Chocolate, Honey and more, suffice it to say traditionalists should be quite contented by triangles bold with Cloves and Cinnamon plus a faint hint of Orange while those seeking something a little more interesting should set their sights on either the tall purses offering three styles of Nuts plus Chocolate drizzle or the Powdered Sugar dusted Ma'amoul with Dates.",

Whenever I want quick good quality Mediterranean food, I go to Parsley!  Plenty of options, even for vegetarians! I love that they have bowls, plates and salads. Their falafel is so delicious - they form and fry it fresh to order and add some of their yummy hummus in the middle for dipping. The appetizer comes with 6 pieces!   Since I have a gluten allergy, I normally can't eat many different things at restaurants, including rice. At Parsley's, I can have everything except the pita fries and parsley fries, and even though I'm sure they're good, I never feel like I'm missing out!  The owner is so friendly and really cares about the food he gives his customers. The restaurant is always clean, and the options are endless. You won't be disappointed eating at Parsley's!  P.S.

    "text": "The stars are only for the food as the service here sucks. I've came here over 50 times in the past year and I love the food but not the service . I always feel rushed even when there is no one in line, like there are so many add on items can you give me a second. Unfortunately, I like my meat well done and although they do accommodate that here it always seems like it is tasking for them and puts them in a bad mood, they all do it differently some fry it more on the pan and some just bring the grill closer to the meat longer. There is no consistency.   So I placed a phone order tonight and had questions about the parsley fries and was asking about adding steak to it. The lady on the phone stated they could do it like the nachos. When I asked what was on the nachos she seemed irritated in explaining and when I asked if I could put lettuce on it instead of other veggies she stated we don't do that and if I want to change it to come in restaurant in person to choose. Now I am in no way an unreasonable person and there is in fact a polite way to say this to someone instead of being very rude over the phone. I held my temper as I didn't want to stoop to her level and she started to state my total, I wasn't even done placing order and had to interrupt her to add one more item to pick up.   I am very bothered by this because I really love the food there but am thinking of never returning due to the lack of good service.   There is one great employee there and it is the older lady but I hardly see her there anymore. She is awesome!",

At the Tropicana location, they're warm, cheery, and so welcoming.   - I didn't get a pita with either of my plate meals.   - both the chicken and steak were dry.   - they were beginning to run out of ingredients so the portions were smaller.   I hate that I've given this location 3 chances and each time it's the same poor experience. I'll be making the 30min drive to the Tropicana location from here on out. :/",

The food has always been fresh, healthy, full of flavor, and have I mentioned inexpensive. I don't think they had anything over $10 and I'm sure there's a Groupon floating around. My favorite would have to be one of the chicken or steak shawarma wraps. It's so good. Last time there I told myself I was only going to eat half of my wrap of course I ended up eating the entire thing. The setup is like the very efficient Chipotle or Subway style makes Parsley a popular spot for lunch, you're usually in and out.   If you don't like wraps they have other food choices. You can get the same meats from the wrap as a bowl, a plate, a salad, or a baguette. I just prefer the wraps. They also have some delicious looking falafel and hummus plates. I've been really craving some Mediterranean food since Friday this is probably why I'm finally writing this review. Hmm tomorrow I want to stuff my face in some Parsley food. Yeap that sounds like an awesome plan. BTW Parsley is kind of small establishment, so you kind of have to leave when I arrive jk.",

I asked what else the woman suggested we try and she had a Beef Tagine on special.  Did not expect to her tagine from a small place like this, so I decided to order their special, which included an appetizer of my choosing, YES I chose the falafel.  Hubby and I were have a short break and needed a bite to eat, but not an entire meal.  This was perfect for us to share.  The beef was served over perfectly cooked rice.  There was a lot of flavor in the beef tagine and it was tender.  My one objection to this dish was that it was overly salted.  I have been avoiding adding salt to my food, so maybe I like things less salty, but even Hubby said he found it too salty, so I will go with it was overly salted.  The falafel on the other hand is some of THE best I have ever had.  It did not taste like the pre-made mix that so many other places use.  It really tasted freshly made, and if they are using a mix they are definitely adding fresh ingredients to it.  It was actually moist on the inside.  Crunchy on the outside and fresh and moist inside, they were delicious.  Their tahini dip was excellent too, not overly sesame flavored and a perfect balance to the falafel.  I'll be honest, the falafel was so good we are going back there today for lunch.  I'm thinking a falafel wrap is in order.",

Maybe my tongue is just used to really spicy food. I don't know. The hot sauce had a good flavor to it, though!   As for customer service, it was Nicole who prepared my food and she is such a sweetheart! Gave out a coupon at the cashier, so I'm coming back soon. Hopefully they have the kabobs next time.",

Like the other review said the chicken tasted really old, overdone, and maybe even rotten :/  The tahini dressing was also really gross which is weird because tahini is delicious!?  Also feta cheese was not included and was an additional $1 -_- which is pretty sheisty in my opinion. I think a $10 salad should include cheese. So they taxed extra for cheese and veggies that are normally included and gave me old ass chicken. Merp. For these reasons they get a bad review and hopefully they see this and stop serving people old crusty chicken. Someone could get sick  Positives* Friendly customer service Unlike the chicken the veggies and salad seemed pretty fresh",

My family and I had the opportunity to reside in Qatar for several years as I was growing up. There were those days that mom got lazy to cook dinner so going to a shawarma joint was almost always the alternative choice. I've been to a lot of spots in town offering shawarma, trying to find that distinct taste. The search is over! This place offers not only the best shawarma but also nostalgia with every bite. Parsley is my one and only shawarma spot in Las Vegas.",

I saw them making one and I was amazed at the portion size! But lots of food ain't my style... especially if it is lots of crappy food! Tasted both of the shawarmas and they were drier than the Sahara desert plus gristle. Adding tons of tzatziki couldn't even save my meal. Their food didn't seem fresh to me at all, which is one of their selling points on their website. Either things have gone downhill, or it just wasn't in the cards for me tonight. I was really disappointed with their food and what I ordered. I really wanted to like Parsley Mediterranean Grill since it's local and I heard good things but I probably won't be back. The extra star is for the service and the chocolate dessert as both of those were good.",

It was savory and hearty. There were so many flavors that just screamed Mediterranean, but not in an obnoxious, overpowering way. This place is a gem, but now I'm inspired to compare it to other places in town. Thanks Parsley for jumpstarting this quest hahaha",

I saw a huge group of bugs/ants in the back corner by the soda machine where i was sitting.  I should have just left at that point.  Then, I saw them drop a piece of raw chicken in the salad and then take it out, and then continue to serve the salad!  That is a MAJOR HEALTH CODE VIOLATION!  I could not believe it.   The food was mediocre at best - too many sauces and very soggy.  When I brought it up to the owner, I think his name is Effie, he said it was fine and everything was \"fresh\" - i told him that wasn't the point, but his macho-self didn't want to hear it.  This place should be shut down by the health department - and their customer service sucks.    Oh, and 50 cents for extra olives????  REALLY???? It is a Mediterranean restaurant!",

Just a hint of heat, and so tasty.  The prices are fantastic. Not expensive at all! The service was GREAT. The girls were extremely friendly and helpful. This place has what I look for when dining out: good food, good service and decent prices. They definitely excelled when it came to all 3! I plan on coming back again.

Went there not sure what to expect but I was delightfully surprised. The food is flavorful and delicious. Those pickled carrots or whatever they were are awesome. I love it. Anyways, great experience prompted me to get another groupon. I look forward to going back.",

I got over it and ordered the Steak Shwarrma.  Well, my wife and I were both unimpressed.  The steak was very dry.  It was almost like warm beef jerky.  Flavor wise, the whole thing was utterly bland.  Sadly, the marinated carrots were the most flavorful thing we had.  My five year old son wanted nothing to do with the place.  They only offer three kids options. Perhaps the salads are the main draw here, but I am not going to be taking that chance considering the number of places to eat in town.",

Parsley is counter service where you have the food prepared for you from all the ingrediants behind a glass food bar.  You can have any item custom made the way you like it, which is was we like.  I love a chicken shawarma plate but I only like certain sides on the plate so this works out great.  They are a little stingy on the pita bread and they charge for every little extra you order but with the use of the groupon that is no problem.  We have started to like parsley over Daily Chicken across from UNLV on Marlyland Pky as it is cheaper and really just as good.",

Parsley has never skimped on their ingredients. The wrap was jammed packed with crunchy falafel, a ton of veggies, tahini sauce, and chickpeas -- which I typically don't like eating in their original form, but I like eating them at Parsley. Portions are gigantic! Even with a large appetite (and I eat A LOT), I can only eat half of my wrap; the wraps will surely keep your appetite satiated for hours. It might be best to order your food to go even if you plan on dining at the restaurant, just so you have a container ready in case you can't finish all of your food in one sitting.   Even after several months of not visiting Parsley, the quantity and quality of the food is still fantastic. Such a shame Parsley is located on the other side of the world for me, but when hunger strikes it remains one of my favorite restaurants to consider eating at whenever I'm in the area.",

There was a combo deal that was advertised outside and inside there was a sign which mentioned it came with a drink. However, the lady working there said that it does not include a drink. We only realized this after we left instead of asking her why. In addition, when I went up to ask for hot sauce, the same guy who helped me didn't recognize me and asked if I ordered take out. I mean it's not like it was busy or a large place.. We sat right in front. Just thought that was funny.   However, the curry was very bland and seemed to have less quantity than the actual chicken or steak bowls. The bowls are very large, could be shared between two people. They are pretty good. Just be aware of the pricing and what you are getting beforehand.",

    "text": "While visiting the Starbucks across the way the ladies working behind the counter were eating lunch. Their lunch was Parsley! It smelled so good.   Offering me a taste I almost took it but remembered that they were strangers. You never know. So after finishing my coffee and donut; here I am for lunch.   Before eating lunch here I consulted my Yelp app to see what type of food and variety they sell here. The ladies at Starbucks we're enjoying the Shawarma Hummus Bowl. They did state that at Parsley this comes hot! Real hot!  I enjoy hot food that I am familiar with, so airing on the side of caution went as bland as could possibly be. The menu is very easy to order from and since I was staring at it aimlessly as it was my turn; the customer next to me aided me. When the ladies making the food found out she was the best.  Now I feel that I am have a better understanding on what goes here; and what that is in that bowl: just for giggles. I had the steak bowl today which is a bargain for the huge size of it at $10.99.  The steak bowl comes with yellow curry, a mix of greens, cucumber slices, steak that tastes so delicious; and green parsley that is mild. The bowl is then topped off with a cucumber and yogurt dressing. The green parsley mix is still hot and will water up ones eyes. But it's a nice burn that you feel all the way to the stomach.   The bowl came with a slice of pita bread on the side; which is included in the price of the bowl. As I mentioned the steak was delicious. Cooked all day in its juices; it hit the spot.   The lobby area is full of tables and if this speaks volume they have been full the whole time I was here. The people come and eat and leave in droves. That is how fabulous this place is. Plus Parsley offers a Yelp check in free dessert Baklava. How sweet is that!  So come and eat or have delivered this remarkable restaurant. You will learn something new if not already familiar with their food! Plus free dessert!",

    "text": "I skipped out on this one for a long time.  I've thought about it, and I never would order.   So right now, I'm working in the area.  I love to try other things that I haven't tried.  So I decided to check out the Falafel  appetizer.  I must say it was one of the best Falafels I've every had!  And I really liked there hummus as well. So I decided to go back with my coworker that's a vegan.  Since it was pretty much our first time there, they let us sample quite a few items.  I loved the jalapeno and serrano sauce.  It was so funny, one of the ladies, was tripping so hard, she kept warning us that it was really hot.  She asked us are we sure?  lol  Then when we tasted it, her mouth was just open watching us.  It was really good, just needed salt.  My friend ordered Falafel bowl, fried brussels sprouts. and I ordered the steak bowl with a side of hummus and pita bread.  I just felt like, my warm or hot steak, sat at the register without a lid on it for at least 5 minutes, like why aren't you checking me out, so I can sit down and eat my hot food!  I don't know what she was doing.  The person behind me had like 3 bowls, and she was  ready to check out.  everything was really good.  I think next time she and I will just split 1 salad.  It was alot of food for a lunch.  But with a little added salt everything was on point.  I will be back.",

You want beef? You can have both okuurrr. They got different sauces and flavor variations. It's really great . Can't wait to go back.  Pro tip; if you get a drink, you might as well get the combo cause it's only a few cents more and you get either a baklava (so yummy) or some feta fries!! Which are GREAt.",

Then they completely ignore what toppings we wanted on our plates and just throw everything on it including tons of onions which absolutely hate so now my food is ruined. Pay extra for feta and there's the tiniest amount ever on it and mostly stuck to the nasty onions. The tzatziki sauce it comes with is only 1/4 way filled in the tiny cup. Rip off. Finally the icing on the cake is that my chicken is not cooked properly and has a weird texture! Never again!",

    "text": "Eh, the concept here isn't new..  They should rename this place \"The Mediterranean Chipotle.\" You pick your meat, then whether you want it in a bowl, salad, plate, and then there's Kabob versions of each of those too. 6 options. That's more options than at most brothels! .. So I've heard..  The good: The fries are pretty damn good. Better than most Greek places, but I'm still used to krinkle cut fries at Greek places in the Midwest. The chicken kabob was a normal kabob. Nothing amazing, but nothing boring. Just on par with most other places. The cauliflower thingy(see pic) was good, but not as good as the photo looks.  The bad: Honestly, this place is super unorganized, hence missing a star, and getting 4 in this review. My first time here, and everyone is shouting over everyone else. I couldn't hear the lady or understand her over her thick accent. After asking, \"Huh?\" LITTERALLY 7 times, I found out I have to sit and wait 12 minutes to make the chicken.. the whole time, watching over a dozen others get their steak and chicken plates before me.   All in all, this place would benefit from photos of their food on the wall or menu. I had no idea what I was ordering, and to be honest, AFTER I ordered, the steak burrito thingy looked amazing.",

Not too greasy with all the good veggie tastes.   I recently came into this location for lunch and ordered the veggie plate to go with a side of fries. Ooof! Yummmm. For the veggie plate, I chose rice, quinoa, grape leaves, eggplant, hummus, and baba ganoush (and a side of fries, of course!). Their hummus, first of all, is absolutely perfect. It took me a while to enjoy hummus, but this spot has some of the good stuff, Great texture and super flavorful. I was also super surprised by the baba gaboush. I always thought I hated baba ganoush, but I couldn't get enough of this stuff.  Put some amazing customer service on top of that, and now I am a regular!",

I had their curry last time which was tasty but almost bland. It may have been because I got the last serving but hey it was served to me so that's what I'm judging. I'm a sucker for curries too.  I also had a chicken kabob plate. This was okay. It was kind if bland. Served with a pita, rice, and a salad. This was $8 I believe.  Most recently I got their chicken scwharma over hummus. This was advertised as a special which was lame because I assumed it would be a meal. It was a tin filled with hummus with chicken sliced into it with chickpeas. It had sauce over it and served with a thin very large pita type bread. This was good but more of a shared appetizer. Couldn't eat a large serving of this. The chicken was good with a nice smokey grilled taste to it. This was $8 I believe.  Overall I think the place is affordable for something unique and fresh. Their food is consistent. The place is clean.   I would definitely return for their falafel but I am still on the look out for a good casual Mediterranean place with good falafel.",

With that I would've given another star to make it 5-stars if they didn't charge a dollar extra for olives & quinoa & everything else that's laying out like a Subway sandwich line.   Check it out... but if you're confused on how to order then grab a take-out menu & read because you will hold up the line. YIKES!!",

I've tried quite a few of their items and everything has been delicious, but one of the main reasons I decided to update and upgrade my review of Parsley is their version of nachos.   My mom was the genius who ordered them and they are beyond amazing. Pita chips instead of chips, with tzaziki sauce, feta, tomatoes, cucumbers and parsley. I'm so glad my mom was generous enough to share! For less than $6 this dish is an absolute steal and there was plenty for two people to share as a meal. I think I was addicted after the first bite, it's that good. The rest of their menu is yummy and healthy as well and I've never had a bad meal here. I only wish they were closer for me to go more often.  Not to mention customer service is always outstanding. They are so friendly and accommodating here!",

I've been coming to this place for a while and they had a program to give a free meal after 5 paid meals. The last two times I went they said next time they would honor the free meal the next time I came in. I even had a signed receipt stating they would honor the free meal. Of course when I came to get my free meal they didn't honor. They switched there program over to an app that doesn't work and never honored the free meal I earned. Guess they don't value repeat business.",

This place is located on Pecos Road not too far from highways so it is pretty convenient to get there, and the restaurant does offer quite a lot of parking spaces so it shouldn't be hard to park. The restaurant itself has a typical fast food layout, and can get a little crowded at times so you should maybe avoid the lunch and dinner rush hour. Keep in mind that this place is very small.  We had chicken wraps and falafel plates and they all tasted good. The price is also reasonable for what you get. Expect to pay around $8 for most items and also expect to be filled after that.   In conclusion, I would say that this place offers a good quality/price ratio and I would recommend it. Feel free to message me for any additional details that you may need!",

However today i got one and noticed an odd taste.  I discovered the falafels were the culprit. They were very crunchy inside. Usually they are soft.  My immediate worry was undercooked beans, and I recognized the odd taste to be similar to the taste of chickpea flour Ive used in gf baking. I called and asked if they use raw chickpeas and they confirmed, yes they do. So I started freaking out because I know undercooked beans are toxic.  I only ate about 2 falafels, and I kno undercooked chickpeas arent as toxic as undercooked Kidney beans, but still. Not cool. I get that mistakes happen...but that is a pretty big one. Make sure to check that ur food has been cooked properly if u eat here.",

Steak wrap on wheat. Slather hummus. Add on rice(1$). Lettuce, spicy carrots, seasoned onions, parsley. Maybe..extra parsley. And then add on whatever else you want..if they can fit it in the wrap! So good!!! Share it with a friend because it is huge, healthy and filling. I'm actually missing it as I type right now.   Falafel is also a good sub for steak, if you're into that no-meat life. Chicken is there, too...but the steak is the best. No contest.   P.s. Try not to come around regular lunch times.

It was beautiful. With each visit my admiration and love grew stronger.   But then my office moved further away from you, and limited time for a lunch break meant less of you. It was hard to let go because I craved you often.   Now, I work from home and can have you whenever I want. Alas, our love has returned again, strong as ever.   I had you yesterday in the form of a small wrap. Your chicken was scrumptious and full of flavor. Your hummus,  so tasty and fresh. Your quinoa mix - wow. Simply the best I've ever had. You were delicious and as delicious as I had recalled. My heart and my belly were full once again. And I remember now how much I've missed you.   I can't wait to have you again soon.   Xoxo, Kayla",

    "text": "I've dined here maybe 30 times and have always picked a bowl with beef, chicken or falafel. Tonight I tried something new.   They usually have a special platter of chicken curry, lentil soup, both of which are amazing but tonight I chose the Tagune special. $11.99 and every bite of the stew was a blend of comforting sauce, tender beef, okra, black olives, crunchy carrots, tomatoes, onions and yellow rice. A fresh side salad with tahini dressing. The kind of comfort food or a cold night.   The staff here is amazing. They are accommodating, patient, and positive and though there are only two of them they always acknowledge you when you come in the door; So  very inviting. I've never had a bad meal here.   With all these fast food franchises around, this place provides good, healthy and wholesome alternatives.   Please support your local small businesses.",

My boyfriend LOVED the hummus (as did I) and everything looked and tasted super fresh! He got a falafel plate and I got a chicken bowl. Both were excellent!!

My friend and I had never been in before and the employees were GREAT about informing us of menu items and letting us try absolutely everything before committing.  We both ended up with steak bowls and a hummus appetizer.  I got my bowl with spicy carrots, onions, cabbage, tomato, and cucumber.  Their portions are massive and make great leftovers. The hummus was great but there was so much hummus and only 3 pieces of pita. My biggest concern here is that they seem a little messy and I cross-contamination is a pretty valid concern. Overall, Parsley's food was great and I'll definitely be back but if I was vegan or vegetarian, I probably would avoid it.",

Food was mediocre, and my delivery was missing things that I paid extra for.  Food: 2  Chicken Kabob Plate: Chicken was well seasoned, but it was unevenly cooked. Some pieces were overcooked and some pieces were actually undercooked.  Beef Kabob Plate: Beware that this is actually a kefta (ground beef). It is pretty tasty though! In both plates, the rice was very, very dry and the salad tasted barely seasoned.  Delivery: 1  My order was pretty messed up. I specified that I wanted tzatziki, but I got tahini. I paid for extra pita, but I never received it. The only plus side is that they somehow managed to add the right veggies to the salad as specified in my order.",

Not to mention, the first experience I had here, I wasn't given pita bread with my entre. The size of the piece that was given to me (seen in photos) in correction of their mistake. I approached the lady that served me and created my meal to ask her for a regular size pita because this did not balance out with the mistake made. She said they all come in different sizes to excuse and avoid replacing my pita bread after clearly stating I am dissatisfied with it did not replace it. Not to mention, I asked for more lettuce and you know that she only put three additional pieces of lettuce on top?! I asked her that because my salad was drowned in dressing!  Customer service and hospitality is more than a smile within business, especially when a problem arises. Tasty food is only 50% of an experience. Especially when my money is invested in it. Stop attempting to cut corners and take care of the needs of the customer from a higher level of integrity past a smile and welcome for ALL demographics.",

They make their own superb curry that was just perfect. We will absolutely be return customers and will tell our friends about this place. They have a nice small seating area in front that was perfect.  Thank you Parsley you are an asset to the food lovers community!! Karen McCormack  I don't know how to post two different reviews from two different visits so I'm doing it this way. My hubby and I visited Parsley again for supper and it was DELICIOUS again. Shelia prepared our curry, falafel and tuna bowl. The falafel was honestly the BEST I have ever had. All the other falafel I've ever had was dry dry dry but not at Parsley. It was crunchy on the outside and creamy inside. Sooooo good! I am planning on calling the owner to let them know how much we enjoy their food and the super polite and efficient employees. Thank you Shelia for making our visit absolutely wonderful! We will return! Sincerely Karen McCormack  Ate there again and it was spectacular AGAIN! Thank you Sheila with your service with a smile! Very professional and virtuous. It's obvious she loves her job. I LOVE the curry at ol this place! It's so mellow and bright!",

    "text": "So my roommate and I were craving greek food one evening and decided to try out parsley.   I ordered a plate with the steak. I was surprised there was no gyro meat? I thought greek food staple was gyros? haha maybe I missed something.  Anyway, plenty of options at this location. Very easy pick and choose what you want on your plate. They give you a size-able portion. Lots of options too. And of course, you can customize your plate to have whatever colorful toppings you want on there. The food was alright, there are plenty of other options out here in Vegas for Greek food. This might be a good quick grab and go but not the best for me. The service was also A-okay--it was a greeting and a smile but they definitely wanted to rush into getting the orders out. So it was really a 3.5 for me.  It comes with pita as well.! So I feel that the restaurant was actually just A-okay. I'll have to come back in the earlier hours to maybe re-try another dish or maybe it was just an off day for them. My return rating is 7 out of 10.",

    "text": "we went to this place recently because their menu is predominantly Shawarma. They have steak and chicken Shawarma. The problem is it isn't Shawarma. True Shawarma is meat whether it be chicken, Lamb or beef marinated with the appropriate spices for about 12+ hours. I ordered the steak Shawarma. It was not marinated and therfore was not Shawarma. My wife ordered the chicken Shawarma and it was not marinated but a very plainly cooked chicken. They didnt even use salt and pepper. My steak Shawarma was doused with Tzatziki. It tasted ok but we were really looking forward to some real authentix Shawarma. Another thing that was odd was they didnt even offer gyros on their menu...wtf!? The women working there were ok but when we got up to leave they didnt say goodbye or thanks for coming in...nada nothing zip. They were just hanging out and chatting. The only plus was that the place is very clean and neat and we didnt have to wait becuase we were the only ones there. Also the rice and salad that come with the Shawarma meals is bland like cardboard. Very little rice and no dressing for the salad. Other Mediterranean restaurants really hook you up with the rice but not this place. Barely a serving of rice actually. So in summation if your looking for real Shawarma stay away from this place. Im sure there's much better out there.",

He said it was a Shawarma Steak, in a pita with hummus, greens, and different sauces...  Looked huge and really good.  Well today i tried this shawarma for lunch...  I said you fly I buy, and off we went...  It was pretty busy at lunch but moved quickly... If you send a text to this # and type Parsley you get free hummus and a few pitas...  I have to say that was really good... Now this is my first time trying it so what did i know... It was good, so this is the one i will compare other hummus'es to..  I did the steak, and as others have stated its pretty large.  I could of finished it but i would of wanted to take a nap, so saved it..  My first bite was ike hmmmm,, ok this is good...  The pita, was soft and really fresh, the salad was good, complimented the hummus spread and the meat nicely,  There are sauces you can us to dip it in,, my boy did mine up..  He calls it a mediterrean burrito, which it pretty much was.. Most cultures have \" same as\" or \"a lot like\" dishes...  I went there looking for a GYRO but the older feller behind the counter said try this, gave me a sample of chicken of beef..  I am glad i tried something new.. I will try the beef kabobs, and the chicken. The baklava,,, once i had my friends ya ya's anyone else's recipe is marginal at best but I agree with our fellow yelpers,, this is a must try if you are in the area...  Corner of Pecos and sunset...  Hope this yelps",

We were generally disappointed.  There was nothing in the website that would have tipped me off that it was a simple, small fast food place with plastic plates and utensils.  But we were game for the meals.  The food was OK, though the staff could not explain what shwarma meant and how it was different from other similar foods.  I had the steak shwarma plate with had reasonable sized portions of rice and vegetables, and carrot sticks soaked in a spice liquid (which I did not care for or knew about).  My wife got a chicken shawarma on a bread roll, which was filling.  The staff messed up her order and gave her fries to another customer, told us the fries would be coming out soon (even though the other customer received an added plate of rice to make up for screwing up their order.  We never received the fries even after mentioning it again at the counter.  Needless to say the quality of the service undercut the quality of the food and we shall not be going back.  And as a tip to the owner, we observed the male who appeared to be in charge, taking the orders and payments, opening the cash drawer on his own when there was no payments.  The rest of the cooking staff and the manager would vanish into the back leaving all the customers (3 small groups) alone in the front (and us still waiting for those fries) feeling abandoned.  My wife commented that if this had been her franchise she would have fired all the staff.  We were not told about the card for 5 meals.  All in all very poor service.  Even if I was in the area I'd not go there.  There are too many other good places for mediterranean food to waste time going here.",

The guy who helped me not sure if he was owner or not was super helpful and explained what they offered and even gave me a sample of falafel to try before ordering it. I ended up ordering a falafel salad that contained about 9 falafel, lettuce, chick peas, marinated carrots and tomatoes plus parsley ;) The falafel was a little too crispy for my liking but still yummy. The salad dressing I think was hummus based instead of the typical oil & vinegar on a Greek salad. It wasn't my favorite so I think I'll ask for another option next time. It comes with a side of homemade pita bread that was warm and chewy. A great addition to the salad. I would recommend this place for a great lunch choice. Awesome service and for you meat eaters it looked like they had great choices for a wrap!",

The piece we tried, they were good.  However, when he cut it for our plate, he cut from the bottom, which has a lot of fat, tough, and the chewy part in it.  Price wise, for a plate (come with a small scope of rice, meat, salad, sauce, spicy carrot and a pita bread is $9.49+ tax.  According to the menu, I ordered the beef shawarma bowl, it should be $8.xx, but he charges me the same price as the plate.  I didn't look at the receipt till I got back to the hotel, it's not worth my time to go back and argue for the $.  The prices listed on their web site are pretty outdated.  Plates are $10.25, bowls are more than $9 after tax.  The guy is cutting from his skin.  I like the falafel as they cook it when I ordered it.  The Babaganoush is not bad.

    "text": "I really like Mediterranean food but this place was a big disappointment - primarily becasue it did not offer things that I really look forward to like dolmas.  I came in with a Groupon - second time I have used a Groupon for a Mediterrean place in Vegas that does not click, will stop buying Groupons I guess. I ordered two schwarma plates. I usually like vegetarian sampler type of plates. The people behind the counter were not helpful at all. When I asked about the sampler, they kind of pointed around at some hummus etc,, could not tell what I would get.  Really did not care for the chicken schwarma (agree too dry), the tzakiki (sorry for the spelling)in the squeeze bottle really turned me off so I asked them to lay off that stuff (usually like tzatiki).  The rice smelled odd and was a disappointment - am used to a choice but was told fries would be extra ( really like Paymon's, Daphne's Greek Cafe style fries) if I wanted to subsitute.  We took our food to go, got home, ate and really did not feel like we had eaten anything.  The place looks ok if you like wraps but I was really looking forward to a plate.  Location is squishy - not comfortable to dine in had I wanted my food fresher (with all the empty retail in Vegas - something with a little casual  outside vibe would be preferable - there is a big empty Henderson Town Center down the street I would recommend- squished in by the Jack in the Box drive through does not quite cut it). Anyway, unlike \"Arnold\", I will not be back.",

Go here if you want tasty, healthy food that is also affordable.",

I have gotten the hummus and dolmeh appetizers (both soooo good) and the gyro w/ fries. Their gyro meat was juicy (and had a nice crisp to the outside) and the fresh pita bread was so good. My one suggestion is that the olives they use are generic black olives (not kalamata olives) in their salad and hummus.   Prices are great too. I got the 3 items above for around $12. Super affordable.   I would 100% recommend eating here.",

We ordered steak shawarma and the guy asked me 6 more times if I wanted chicken or steak and by ask me I mean he yelled at me and my son.  At one point the older gentleman that was cleaning the counter answered for me and told him that I said steak.  The food took a very long time and I'm assuming that it was due to us using a Groupon.  The girl that rang us up was less than happy to take the Groupon and actually told us we couldn't use the Groupon for or combo meals and that she would have to ring our 5 orders up separately from the fries and drinks.  So we asked her kindly to please do so and even gave her a tip.  Afterward we could here the two employees speaking in Spanish to each other deciding what to do with the older gentleman  until they eventually told him to stay in the back and out of the front.  He was really nice by the way.  Then I could hear the two of them clamoring on about customers and just being overall unkind about their patrons.  I guess they figured a group of white people obviously can't understand Spanish, guess again!",

And way to much oil in the salad plus more nasty sauce. Then to top it off ZERO pita bread. Called them and they offer me $1.08 off my bill. A place I will NEVER return to & not recommend.

Had a few customer service issues redeeming my deal, mostly pertaining to the receipt- face value of my deal was for $18, yet I only received credit for $15.36 and somehow owed about $2. Employees were unable or unwilling to explain why the transaction happened this way.  In any case, the food was fairly tasty. Beef tagine seems to be a frequent special, and it smells amazing. Taste isn't quite as delicious as the smell though, but I did appreciate that the dish was served on a bed of rice and with a drink (though they didn't give me mine). Beef itself is on the dry side, but it's a saucy dish so it did not ruin the meal. The chicken shwarma salad is decent: moist chicken and fresh veggies, but a bit too much rice for my liking turned it into more of a bowl. Tahini dressing was on the bland side and slightly chalky. They charge 50 cents to add a tablespoon of feta to your dish- and they literally measure out it with a spoon, which is bizarre and stingy to me.  I wouldn't hurry to rush back, largely because of their lack of transparency with billing, but there are so many other places that do Mediterranean in Vegas that I'd rather try another. I can say though, if you are craving beef tagine specifically, this place will probably hit the spot- flavors are correct, but hope it was just an off day for the meat.",

    "text": "Ordered the schwarma chicken wrap. Everything tasted fine until I got to the end of my wrap and bit down on something hard and.. well, my closest guess is ceramic. I don't know if this was some freak accident in the kitchen but I was immediately disgusted. I removed the small, tooth-sized chunk from my mouth, washed it over water to examine it. Still couldn't figure out what it was but it had been in my wrap the whole time.  I couldn't finish the wrap after that. And it had been so delicious up to then! But how disgusting. I hope no one else has had this issue.   It was a very unpleasant experience for me and one that will prevent me from coming back here again. I can't even describe how nauseated I felt when this occurred.   Again, hope this doesn't happen to anyone. Probably just a bizarre event, but, it did happen and it shouldn't have. FYI.",

    "text": "Time for an update.  I've found over the many times that I've been here since last review that, while they do offer pretty good food with some vaguely healthy ingredients, they don't have that something special to warrant my previous five star rating.  - The beef tagine hasn't lived up to the first time that I had it. - While the falafel balls are still good, especially if you have it in a wrap and get a salad that (ironically) doesn't include chickpeas, I have definitely had better places. - The meat options that I've tried are pretty decent but not great. Steak shawarma was a letdown. Beef kebab was pretty good but isn't really worth a ten minute additional wait (cook time).  I would call them somewhat of an Americanized take on the cuisine since they don't really have all the spices (or sweet/spicy sauces) that you find at great falafel / shawarma places. My friend actually had a beef BBQ baguette today, and I'm pretty sure the BBQ-esque flavor that I sampled doesn't belong in any sort of authentic restaurant of this sort. Still, with the prevalence of their salad mix and spicy carrots, they're a decent casual place for food that doesn't feel wholly unhealthy.  One more thing: you should know that they've been raising their prices and that they seem to do some strange things with entering Groupons at the register. Regarding prices, I'm pretty sure salads and large wraps were $8.49, baguettes were $7.49, and regular wraps were $6.49 today. Regarding Groupon, I'm guessing that the value is applied after tax or something, but others and I have found ourselves to be paying unusual (albeit small) amounts of cash when we didn't expect to owe anything.",

They are also very stingy (or maybe just with me and they are just profiling me). The lady in front of the couple in front of me got a lot of olives (more than 6) without asking for extra. I asked for olives (with an \"s\") she put one piece of olive on my hummus. Also asked to fill only half of container with hummus so she can put more olive oil....nope! She's so stingy with olive oil (only put two circular dash--that's after I asked for her to put more than just one circular dash so she added one more dash) maybe she thought I just like half a container of hummus just for kicks.   If you have time, go to their other location on Tropicana Ave. The other location has fresher food (atleast with the curry and eggplant salad but just the same with hummus). They are also not stingy and actually put a lot of toppings on curry. Not stingy with olives and olive oil too. I asked for olives at their other location--she put 4 without me asking for extra/more! The other location did not charge me Groupon Tax but idk if they just started that policy so they might also charge it. But still, it is not in the Groupon fine print!!!!",

It is a grab and go which is perfect for the ones on a quick time crunch. The place is very clean and friendly. It was nice to see that after every customer, the employee would wash their hands. It gave me a sense of relief.   I ordered the falafel salad, which was made fresh. It was not soggy and you had the option of adding additional toppings for $1 extra.   The reason I ranked it 4 star is because the menu did not list the ingredients of each menu item. I had to kept asking the staff, which were helpful, but would have been nice to see it while staring at the menu.",

You order an entree and it comes with a salad with your choice of ingredients.  You want it in a wrap, they wrap it.  The rice was wonderful as was my beef shish kabab.  Right around $20 for the two of us to enjoy this meal - the little one shared Mom's plate. Since they serve baklava, why aren't they serving coffee or espresso?

    "text": "My Recomendation: Steak Shwarma.  I've always been a fan of Mediterranean food, but I haven't been too impressed by a lot of the places I've been to out here. Fortunately, Parsley is a trend breaker!  The selection on the menu was pretty small, which is fine. It's not overwelming. And they make up for their small menu size with their heaping portion sizes. If you're able to finish one of their shwarmas in one sitting, you should try out for one of those professional eating contests because you definitely have some talent.   The food itself was delicious! It kind of reminded me of a gyro, but better.The steak was nice and juicy, the vegetables seemed pretty fresh and they used just enough sauce and hummus. I've been to other mediterranean places where they drench it in so much sauce that my bread gets soggy before I get to finish my meal.  One complaint I have is how small the store is. There was no room to even stand in line without feeling like you're intruding someone's eating area. Maybe I just went on a busy day, but the place was packed. A bigger, more open store would fit them better.   Customer service was great. Everyone was so polite and had a big, friendly smile the whole time. Even though I was asking some pretty dumb questions (like, what's a shwarma? What goes on it?) the guy I talked to was happy to answer with sincerity. He didn't make it seem like they were dumb questions at all.  I would definitely recommend this place to anybody!",

He said this is the best he ever had. This man usually complains no matter how legendary a restaurant is. I ordered the caprese salad which was memorable in every bite.",

And my mom sampled the meat on the spit and she said it was to die for.  Next time I go, I'll definitely get something else, but overall we enjoyed our experience.

    "text": "It was a Sunday, in the library, with an appetite.  No, I wasn't caught while playing Clue, I was planning what to do!  Eric R. and I were with friends at a community grant meeting and they were hungry.  They raved about Parsley so off we went.  Upon arrival, we mentioned we were newbies, and were immediately provided with lots of samples: chicken and steak schwarma, chicken curry, and beef tagine.  Eric, who planned on schwarma before we even got there, changed his tune and ordered a small chicken curry plus a side of pita (50 cents).  It was tasty, but I am not sure exactly what kind of curry it was.  It was creamy and enhanced with turmeric.  On a side note, my mother-in-law and I have a joke about naming children after spices.  Eric has a cousin with the middle name Sage, which his mom doesn't like.  I told her to honor my husband I can name my child Turmeric.  Anyway, back to the food.  I love bowls.  No, that does not mean I went to Taco Bell to try a cantina bowl or KFC for a potato fried chicken corn and cheese biscuit bowl...no no no.  I like rice bowls though - Chipotle burrito bowls, sushi rice with fish on top bowls/chirashi, rice topped with anything in general is just very appealing to me.  Parsley has bowls!  I got the steak schwarma bowl - Israeli salad on the bottom, yellow rice, steak schwarma, tahini sauce.  I asked for the 3 hot sauces on the side (green is mild but yummy and chimichurri -like) and the 2 red sauces are hot.  I am not sure which was supposed to be hotter - one was too weird tasting for me, but the deep red oily one was really good and I spread it on the top of my bowl.  It was huge.  Though the curry comes in 2 sizes, the bowl is only one and I had to have Eric R. finish it.  There are many good things on the menu to try, including baguette sandwiches!  They also have kabobs.  Fresh, relatively healthy food, and fast!",

    "text": "Parsley has found itself as one of my regular visits for lunch lately.  I hate how everyone, including myself refers to a restaurant as \"Chipotle style\" but yes, essentially it's like Chipotle with Greek food.   You pick a wrap, salad, bowl, etc, a protein (chicken, beef, falafel) then a bunch of fixins.  I generally am the type who tries new things every other visit, even if I find something I like.  At Parsley I've pretty much stuck to the exact same order each time I've frequented:   Red Quinoa salad with added chicken (costs extra), and then I add the spicy carrots, some of the green sauce (everyone's got a green sauce nowadays), and some tahini.   The salad mix that you start with is fairly standard with lettuce, cabbage, cucumber, tomato with some garbanzo beans mixed in.   The vinaigrette as I've seen others state is mild, but tasty.   If you know nothing about red quinoa then we're in the same boat, and there's a list of health benefits that Parsley advertises that I can neither confirm nor deny, but I mean it's quinoa, so I can't imagine there's any sort of deception there right?  To be honest it doesn't add much more flavor than one would expect some scoops of quinoa would add to a salad, which is why the carnivore in me always has to add chicken as well.   I would prefer to do the chicken Kabob style vs Shawarma  style but it does take quite a bit longer for them to cook the kabobs vs just cutting it right off the giant spinning hunk of meat, so time wins that battle.   Side note:  the amount of different spellings of shawarma within the photos and reviews of this place are hysterical.   It's 2016 people, no excuse.  Anyhow, all of these components combine to form an extremely delicious salad, and there are enough options to satisfy anyone I would think [tzatziki instead of tahini, feta/olives/hummus options, fiery red sauce (BEWARE) over milder green sauce (which also packs a kick), etc]   The only downsides for me are sometimes the service seems a bit rushed.   It's always friendly, but I feel that sometimes my salad ends up with the person at the end of the assembly line before I can finish with the additions I wanted from the first person.   They get busy and want to stress the quickness factor which I understand.   Also I have a few times ordered a double order of chicken, and what I've received has been inconsistent.   Sometimes it's a giant heap of chicken, and other times it doesn't seem much different from the single.   Lastly some of the extras that you can add include an upcharge that I wish didn't.  Feta and olives to be exact.  It's especially frustrating for me because I really only want a tiny bit of each but don't want to pay the extra charge for the large amount they give you.  I realize it's a slippery slope for them though.   Minor grievances to what has always ended up being a fantastic meal.  One pro tip before I go:  if you want to indulge in either of the sauces, ask for them to give it in a separate container instead of having them put it directly in the bowl.   Much easier to distribute according to your own tastes that way.",

I ordered steak shwarma and opted for the wheat wrap. I got extra taziki sauce and red onion. I also got a slight sprinkling of feta cheese.  When I got home and opened my wrap it looked good - but the taste was MEH. The shwarma was very over-done, almost burnt tasting and crispy. The lady had shaved off the meat for awhile (I wasn't sure what she was doing), but apparently whatever it was, it yielded some not-so-great steak shwarma.

The chicken was only slightly better so my husband and I both ordered the chicken. It came with rice which was neither fluffy nor flavorful. The largest portion on the plate was the salad which was okay. I found it to be the most edible thing on the plate. The pita bread was your basic packaged pita.   The chicken and the rice were so dry and bland that my husband and I left all but a couple of forkfuls and gave the rest to our dogs who were also indifferent. They ate it anyway but not with the same enthusiasm as for other leftovers.   My son had the BBQ Beef Sandwich combo ($10) - the beef was flavorless but was \"saved by the BBQ sauce\" according to my son. And the bread was soggy. The fries were kind of mushy.  He said he wished we would have went to McDonald's. Me too I guess. It's cheaper anyway.   I say skip this place and save your money.",

They have a patio with tables and chairs. It's basically build your own bowl/salad/entre type. I love the fresh options they have to select from. The chicken and beef options are literally cut out in front of you from the revolving gyro machine. The salad I got was tasty and healthy. I would come back here, specially for lunch. Bring your coworkers.",

Rice was really bland , no flavor whatsoever.  Same applies to the hummus. Falafel was very salty. All i tasted was salt. Salad was ok. May be their meat dishes are better i did not try them. Overall this place gave me an impression of  unauthentic  poorly made food.  I usually go to Amena Bakery and Deli when i am in Las Vegas. It is basically the same price but a lot better quality food.",

    "text": "I'm not a huge fan of hummus or Mediterranean food sadly, but when I want to eat out and feel good about it, parsleys is one of my first considerations.  They have a lot of excellent healthy options like the hummus or chicken skewer plate, although the chicken is a tiny bit dry. And if you're really feeling riskaay you can treat yourself to a nice little check in baklava freebie huhuhu.  Their Groupon deal is also a huge steal, I always make sure I have it handy when I go in. Their portions are decently sized, but make sure you watch what extras you put on your plate because if you don't pick correctly you can get charged extra. Staff is always very nice whenever I stop by as well, I don't honk I've ever gone in once and had a rude person serve me.  Also if youre not on a diet and have to choose between the chicken or steak make sure to get the steak, it's a little extra but flavor is more seasoned and worth it if you aren't in the mood to watch weight.",

    "text": "I love Parsley! I eat lunch here often with my co workers, and occasionally crave it so much I make my husband take me here for dinner.   I've had the chicken, curry chicken, fried chicken, bbq beef, shishkabob, and falafel. Falafel is probably my favorite. Bowls, wraps and plates. Same concepts just different portions and serving styles I think bowls and plates come with pita bread on the side. You can also get small sides to taste for a 1.00! All the items I have tried are good. Everything tastes great and I have never had a quality issue or anything not be fresh out of the dozen times I have been there. Also had the lentil soup, it was not as good as I'd hoped but ok if you enjoy lentil soup. It was not as broth as I hoped for, more chunky.  The wraps are huge, and they are never stingy with toppings. I have only tried the mild green sauce (being someone who likes spicy food), I do warn you the green sauce is super spicy. I can only imagine what the red hot sauce taste like. You can also order small wraps which are not as gargantuous as the regular one is, it's a good value either way.  I have also had the curry chicken plate it was good but needed a little more spice for me. But for 11 bucks I got a huge portion and a drink.  My husband had the nachos once, cute idea but super messy to eat LOL  The service is always good and they are always friendly to us. The only reason they lose a star is because the location is very small, and it is very hard to get a table or sit down and eat for lunch. It does get congested and loud inside and is not always as clean as it could be. Also word to the wise don't go after 8 o'clock because they are usually cleaning up and are often out of a lot of things, and maybe are not as inviting as usual lol.  which makes me sad because I love this restaurant and I hate to point out flaws. None the less I will continue to go there and I hope they grow maybe get some Green Valley locations!",

It will not disappoint. If you aren't great with spicy food - don't risk it. This stuff is legit!   I won't recommend specific items because everything seems to be great - if you like red meat, go for it. If you're into chicken - you do you. It's all good!

The reason for the low star rating is for the poor customer service. This was my first time eating here and honestly I don't know much about Mediterranean food. I told the guy behind the counter this and I asked for his recommendation. Instead of telling me some of their popular items, he began to read off the menu (which I don't understand why since I can read it myself). When it was time to pay, another older gentleman was working the register. I showed him my check in (since they had a Yelp check in offer for free baklava) and he asked me for my name to confirm my check in. After I told him, he said he didn't see it on his register. I even showed him my Yelp check in and he kept on saying he couldn't see it even though it was right there on my phone. After awhile he just seem annoyed at the entire situation, which left me feeling confused. He ended the conversation with an attitude like as if he was doing me a favor by giving me a baklava. As I was dining in, the same worker went around and chatted with all the customers (asking how their food was, removing trash/taking their tray). He went to all the table except mine. What's that all about?  Decent food. However, the customer service left something to be desired.",

This place is really nice for a \"fast food\" type Mediterranean eatery. It reminded me of a Subway Sandwich type set up where you let them know what you want on your order while they make it in front of you.      For my drink they had a fresh lemon and cucumber water on the drink line which was so delicious and refreshing.       I love the decor and art in this tiny place.

Parsley came to mind since it was on the way home and would be healthier than many other options.  The shop features large boards above the ordering area outlining the various food options. I did have to ask what was included in a beef kabob bowl versus a beef kabob plate (they are the same). I decided on a Beef Kabob bowl, Hummus, and Baklava. At this time I was also warned that the kabob would be a 10 minute wait. It wasn't a big deal since I was told ahead of time. Next visit I'll probably call in my order now that I know the lead time.   The Beef Kabob plate was really good. The beef kabob was tender and full of delicious seasoning. There was also a lot of meat included. The salad was fresh and had a really refreshing, light dressing on it. The rice was simple, but delicious. It worked really well mixed in with the salad. The tzatziki dressing on top was tasty and didn't drown the other flavors. The bowl came together like a Mediterranean version of a Chipotle bowl. The hummus was creamy and delicious with soft pita on the side. The baklava was pretty good too. All of the food I enjoyed tasted fresh.  The food was inexpensive. My bowl was around $9 and had plenty of food for a satisfying meal. The side and dessert were inexpensive as well.",

    "text": "Good spot for a quick Mediterranean lunch. I'm usually pretty rushed since my lunch time is short, but the service here is pretty quick.  Environment: it seems like a lot of people from local businesses come here to grab a quick lunch. It's a pretty small store and is exactly what it is, a small clean and fair priced restaurant. It is similar to a cafeteria in the way that you wait in line and select your options, so not really a spot to eat and have long conversations.   Service: the staff were friendly and had the line moving pretty quick. They are a little bit rushed since the line is usually consistent, but I didn't mind it since I was rushed on time as well.  Food: the food is good, I say you have the option of eating healthy or having a heavier meal here which is nice. I have had the chicken and steak plate before with the rice, it is really good and doesn't feel super heavy but you do get full. I enjoy salads more for lunch, and I think their chicken and beef go well with it. Their beef and chicken are cooked on a doner, those large revolving heated flame stick, so it has a little bit of a burnt taste to it which I kind of liked. They also have many other Mediterranean options like pita bread, hummus and tzatziki sauce.  All in all, great location for Mediterranean food. It's quick and you don't feel too heavy or tired when you head back to work.",

It is a chipotle or subway style of restaurant where you tell them what you want on and in your food. Pretty small area but I usually take my orders to go.  Portions are very generous.. however, you need to pay a dollar for any additional toppings other than what your food includes.   Nice restaurant if you're looking for a healthier option!",

    "text": "Love this place! Since moving here from NY, I haven't really found a Mediterranean place that was satisfactory but this is pretty great. The veggies are super fresh and the chicken is never dry. We ordered a shish kabob chicken bowl, a chicken wrap, and a falafel plate.  The falafel was perfectly crunchy and their tzatziki sauce paired with it beautifully.  My mom took one look at the wrap and said she would only eat half. However, she enjoyed it so much she finished all of it anyway. My husband also enjoyed the shish kabob plate and even though he's not a big fan of veggies, he scarfed it all down.   This place would have definitely been 5 stars if it weren't for the service. Out of the three ladies that were there, only one was nice and helpful. The cashier with curly hair was extremely rude and kept asking if I wanted anything else while I was still giving my order to her coworker. I'd still go back though!",

I say the gyro wraps, or salads are good choice.  I did their Wrap and fries my fried had salad with the gyro meat on it.  The have some nachos that look great will try next time and let you know.",

    "text": "*** Two of the BEST MOUTHGASMS EVER!*** Just ate here for the first time so the hubby and I opted for a variety of things so we could taste as much as possible. There aren't enough adjectives to describe how AMAZING this place is!   They are beyond 5 stars and A+ for us! I may be back this weekend even though they are not close to anything for us. We just happened to need the extended hours post office up the street and decided to try it out.   Oh, and btw I am a connoisseur of Mediterranean food, lol. The point being that I definitely know the difference between EXCELLENT and mediocre.   We had a chicken shawarma plate with babaganoush and a steak plate with hummus. Both plates came piled as full as absolutely possible with food which included rice and salad.  I included two pics one showing the two plates about 5 minutes into eating (Duh, sorry) and one of the hubby's plate after he finished. I thought he might lick it clean before all was said and done. I, on the other hand, had enough left over to FILL a full sized to-go box. Seriously folks, BIG portions!  The service was quick and both of the people working were kind and helpful. I asked a lot of questions considering it was our first time there and the young lady who helped us was patient and descriptive with a great smile as an additional treat. She did not rush us or so much as hint to being annoyed by the many questions.  I couldn't help myself and had to order some baklava when I went up for the to-go box. Haven't tried it yet because we are too full. They have several varieties so of course I got an assortment.   We were DELIGHTED to see that they have a loyalty program, especially since this just became my favorite restaurant and new hangout.   DELICIOUS...WONDERFUL....SURPRISING... SCRUMPTIOUS... FANTASTIC... AWESOME...   You get the point, right? Go! You won't be disappointed!",

I was really expecting to not like it because I'm picky, but Damn!! This was really good! As soon as I entered, I was greeted by two young ladies who were smiling and they asked if I had any questions (clearly I looked confused). Both Alejandra and Alicia were awesome! They didn't rush me, they were both so sweet and explained everything about every question. I explained I'd never tried anything like this before, and they both had my back and never made me feel uncomfortable or silly for not being familiar. I ordered the plate (to go) since the items were separated. I got the steak, rice, salad with extra cucumber, feta and those spicy carrots. They offered pita bread, and even put the sauce on the side so I could try it out. Everything was fabulous! Why did I wait so long to try this place?? I totally appreciate those two young ladies for their above and beyond amazing customer care!  I definitely recommend this place for anyone! It was clean, everyone was friendly, and Even if y'all are picky- check it out!!!  The meat was tender, everything else tasted fresh and I couldn't finish half bc there was so much food! I'll be back in no doubt, but I'll try something different. Totally surprised myself trying a new thing!  See you guys there!!",

When they ask you if you want olives, feta, etc. in your wrap or bowl they never mention that it costs extra! This should be stated and not used as a surprise up sell tactic to ambush your patrons with.  The meat was way too salty but the veggies were fresh and the wrap was decent.

We'll see how long it takes for me to get tired of it. As it stands, I went for lunch yesterday and I returned today. It's that delicious.  Yesterday, I was looking for something somewhat healthy and found Parsley through Yelp. I got a beef shawarma salad to go and I ate it at the parking lot along Sunset where people watch planes take off and land (or do other activities not related to aviation). I don't think I even saw a single plane because I was too busy enjoying my salad.  Today, I went back to try chicken instead, but once I saw what the guy ahead of me ordered, I basically told the lady, \"I want that.\" That being a gigantic half chicken, half beef shawarma wrap. For a slightly lower price, it seems like you get more food. What I like about the wrap is how it reminds me of the Doner Kebab--something we don't really have in Las Vegas.  For messy hands sake, I'll probably stick with the salad. In any case, I feel like you just can't go wrong with Parsley Mediterranean Grill.",

Not only is everything incredibly fresh, but the people are super kind and helpful, and the fact you can get your meal to go in a chipotle style system makes Parsley a great choice for any occasion.    I come for lunch and there is always a great deal that I try to take advantage of, but can never stray away from the parsley fries... if you come you have to check them out.  The meals are priced great (usually under $10) and they have huge portions, so I am able to fill myself at lunch then have a snack for later.  Overall, I try to stick to the mediterranean diet (healthiest diet there is) so having Parsley around makes that goal so much more obtainable.  Whether its a salad, or kabob wrap, everything is so dang good you'll have to come back to try them all.  Check out Parsley and you will be glad you did!",

Hands down, the best falafel in Las Vegas, period.  The falafel is always fried fresh to order and they are very good about custom orders (my boyfriend is not a cucumber fan, so he always gets a fresh salad made).   The house-made hummus is also very tasty, and the fries are delicious. Their red hot sauce will make your tongue insanely happy. I love this place so much.  I'm only sad there isn't a location closer to my house and that they aren't open just a bit later so I can have it when those late-night cravings hit.",

For example, every time I had their baklava it was stale.    The employees are nice and attentive.  The prices are reasonable and the portions are large, but it was definitely a case of quantity over quality.

    "text": "I came here with a living social deal $14, and it served me well. It looks and feels like any fast food Mediterranean style place, which is to say that it was rather unimpressive. This is the sort of place you go for a quick pick up, or carry out while you sit at home and watch Netflix or a sports game.  Service was fair, no complaints there. One big complaint I do have is that the restaurant offers NO LAMB. How can you call yourself a Mediterranean grill and have no lamb as an option? I was really craving a gyro or at least a lamb kabob and was unable to have one. They basically offer 4 options for adult eaters: Beef shawerma, Chicken Shawerma, Beef Kabob, Chicken Kabob-- each available in wrap, sandwich, salad, or plate form. The plate is for a larger appetite, the wrap will suffice a medium appetite. We tried the chicken shawerma salad and beef shawerma plate. They add a Tahini dressing that they keep in a plastic squeeze bottle, much like you would find at a Subway. It was tasty stuff but honestly it was yet another reminder of how authentic this place ISN'T. Real tahini is slathered onto things or served in a bowl because it should not have such a creamy, dressing like consistency.    I don't mean to sound so harsh because the food IS actually pretty tasty and I LIKED it a lot more than I like eating at most of the big corporate fastfood joints that I no longer support. The salad they serve has garbanzo beans and a tasty tangy dressing.  Big compliments to the spicy paste. The green and red stuff ( the name of which escapes me) are both quite good options. The red really packs a punch so don't get it unless you're an adventurous spicy eater like myself. That alone makes this place worth coming to if you've got a craving for spicy and meaty.  They serve pickled carrots with the salad and the helping of shawerma is pretty generous. As I write this review, I admit to feeling quite stuffed. It's a fair value for what you pay but unless I was already out here in the area, (cough--Sunrise Coffee--cough) I can't honestly say I'd be craving them badly enough to drive out here. I would come back again with another coupon deal though.",

It was something with chickpeas.  While that probably says a lot right there, the food wasn't bad, it just wasn't anywhere near where I like my Mediterranean fare to be. There was nothing special or memorable to it, and it was sort of overall quite bland. Possibly because it's not Persian or Greek or Moroccan, but some sort of Americanized, averaged version of all the widely varied cuisines that get lumped into \"Mediterranean\". It's a sort of \"health-food-ified\" Frankenstein that has all the right parts of delicious Mediterranean food, but they just aren't working quiiiiite right.  Food alone would give it 3 stars, though. I never feel oogy after eating it, and it is what it advertises.  What knocks it down to two, is the fact that every time I come in, I'm treated very rudely. One of my co-workers with a stamp loyalty card who was buying another co-worker who forgot his wallet in his desk lunch tried to get two stamps, and was actually yelled at. On another occasion I was given the third degree for asking for napkins with my takeout. There's a rather snarly atmosphere of \"the customer is trying to pull the wool over our eyes and steal our plastic cutlery!\" that just does not impress.",

We split the Parsley fries with feta, the loaded nachos (on house made pita chips), and a steak wrap. The wrap was good, but the nachos and fries were out of this world. The ingredients were really fresh and the menu offered plenty of choices without being overwhelming. Super friendly staff and quick service made for a win-win(-win) dining experience. Bonus: the sweet lady working there also gave us free take-home samples of the chicken curry.

    "text": "I give 2 stars because the people working there were very nice and understood customer service, that being said, I don't agree with the place being a \"Mediterranean\"  place and I have my reasons as well.   First thing, as many might know, a Mediterranean place will 99% of the time serve Basmati Rice to go with the food. This place, no where close. Second, too much salad... Infact a lot of salad. Don't get me wrong, I love salad but if I am getting a shwarma plate, I want more of rice and chicken. This, the Mediterranean chicken is supposed to be marinated overnight in spices and the chicken I had here, well it was really blend.   Some people might like the way they make their food but I have eaten authentic Mediterranean food many many times and I don't like this place.",
