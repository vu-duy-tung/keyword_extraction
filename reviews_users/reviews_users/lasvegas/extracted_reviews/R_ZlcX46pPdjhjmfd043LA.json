    "text": "Top Of The World Restaurant 5/11/12 WOW! A full 360 from the dinner we had last night. I am going to start with our elegant server, Jeanne. She only works lunch so she can be more personable. In Las Vegas lunch is just as important as breakfast or dinner. Jeanne know her menu and her surroundings. She has got to be the most perfect server I have ever had, and kudos to her assistant server.  Now as far as the food; way to go on thinking out of the box. Who would have thought of Smoked Salomon On a BLT and thick whole grain bread. And eating with the lobster bisque was divine. Dessert was absolutely sinful but we are in Las Vegas. Now the atmosphere is just incredible. You can see the old and the new. All the mountain regions. It takes a little over an hour to spin completely around., But they don't rush you plus you pass the dessert cart twice and the dessert anticipation is almost more than you can stand. The staff from the time we valet the car all thought the whole experience of the stratosphere and Lunch at the Top of the World was delightful and friendly. Have lunch at Top Of The World Restaurant  the best place to dine in Las Vegas.",

The restaurant is located at the very top of the Stratosphere hotel and casino and is without any doubt the best restaurant on that side of the strip.    Note.. the prices are expensive but they do offer a one person and two person pre-fix menu.",

    "text": "Walked out!   The first restaurant I walked out on. I had high expectations after reading the reviews here. It took us almost an hour to get up there, and then we were seated by a table as far away from the revolving window as possible. We were disappointed with being seated so far away from the window but besides that disappointed in the cleanliness of the place. It had a funky smell, moldy and possibly smokey? The carpet looked dirty and so did the bench that we were seated on. 5 star restaurant, so dirty? Well, I guess it is old so okay.. we stayed and waited (for a very long time for our waiter), we talked about asking to be seated closer to the window. How cool would it be to enjoy the view as the restaurant revolved! It was a week night and there were plenty of tables available right next to the windows, we figured it should be no problem. The waitress told us \"no,\" and looked at us like we were problem customers. The restaurant is very expensive here and atmosphere is important to us. We asked if she could ask a manager because we were considering going elsewhere if we couldn't enjoy the view. The manager (or hostess, couldn't tell) told us \"no,\" as well with the same disapproving look and we left (embarrassed and disappointed) to go to the Eiffel Tower Restaurant where we had one of the most amazing dining experiences we've ever had - seriously! I highly recommend Eiffel Tower.   We'll never come here again because of this experience. It's so sad that we were so dressed up and excited to be here and we felt we were treated so poorly. Boo!",

I would pay more to go up have dinner at John Hankock but not his one. We ordered a sea bass, steak which were not good. The drink that I ordered Frosty Navel was kind of horrible. However, the soup was the best in there i thought. We also tried the dessert Cremen Brulee and Choco Tart. Well, the desert were totally bad.",

    "text": "First of all, the service here was excellent.  A server that can sit along side with me after our wine was served and before our appetizer was ready to share photos of our puppies is surely a moment of good interaction vs. scripted menu specials and courtesy calls like\"how is that wine?\" when they really don't give a damn...  Eventhough, this flamboyant waitor still gave good recommendations, after our moment, I trusted him fully.  We both started with our own lobster bisque.  It was spectacular.  No black pepper needed, just fyi if the server asks if you would like some black pepper with that, say no!   I had the black cod and my man had the filet.  His steak was cooked perfect.  It was so tender and flavorful. My fish on the other hand was only so so.  It was moist, and the fish was fresh, but somehow the fish loss its flavor.  I wouldn't order this again.  Their dessert menu was in very small portions, so even after our very satisfied meals, we were able to try the cheesecake trio and the chocolate creme brulee.  The bf loved the cheesecake, which was on a stick like a lollipop which you dip in different flavor sides, his favorite was the oreo.    The view was amazing, we sat there front early evening when the sun was still out until night and saw the restaurant just transform.  From full of light and open space and windows as walls that we face from the table where we were sat.  To dim lights insdie so that the las vegas city strip lights are still considered bright.  I have not stepped into the stratosphere for the hotel or casino, but will definitely come back to this restaurant again.  Next time, I want to have their steak and lobster combo!  Great wine selection.  Once in a while a bungee jumper will be in sight while he/she drops off the side of the building.    The restaurants rotates very slowly so you get a different view every minute.   Great staff, even the manager of the restaurant gets around to almost every table to chat a bit.  Excellent service from beginning to end.",

I had the best duck dish ever and my fiance had a great steak. The wine pairings were spot on and the service was excellent. Even had a great cocktail in the lounge while we waited for our table. The only complaint I have is the lame security line you have to go through to get up to the tower. I mean come on, when you're dressed to the nines and there for a fancy and expensive meal you shouldn't get patted down with the other riff raff. There should be a different entrance for dining only.",

They've since figured out that they won't let you book reservations then skip 'em to get up the tower for free, but I imagine the food is still good, and there's still that business of a 1HP motor that keeps the view spinning about.   Or maybe it's that I've been there 4 times and never once had to pay a dime for it? Yeah. That's the one.  Several of my trips included the chef's summer special \"Tornados and their sauces,\" which was, as it turned out, three delicious lumps of fillet mignon each with a very very good sauce.   Don't forget to ride the Big-Shot after your meal. It'll help it all settle.",

We're from New York and used to expensive restaurants but this was definitely up there.

Chicken pasta and lobster salad sandwich were both very good. 2. Lots of food options. 3. Pretty reasonably priced for lunch.  Okay: 1. Steak.  My dad said it was fine, not the best and not the worst. 2. None of our meals were super hot when they arrived - felt like maybe they had been sitting a while.  Bad: 1. COLD french fries when they first arrived.  BUT the waitress immediately took them back and brought a new fresh batch that was amazing!  So bad turns into great!",

It was a great place for a date. We had a window seat. I had an appetizer platter that had duck, fish, and something else I don't remember...hehe My boyfriend had a filet mignon, which he really enjoyed. At any rate, it was great!

Every one and everything was just so superb! The restaurant rotates around the strip giving you a 360 degree view of the whole Las Vegas! Of course the best time to go is at night to see all the beautiful lights!   The food they served was extravagant! It's pricey but well worth it! You pretty much pay for the view more than the food! Lol. The atmosphere was just so calming, lights were dim but not too dark. I had the lobster soup (it's called something else but basically speaks for itself!) and OMG! I'm telling you! If you've never had lobster soup before, you've got to try it here! I also had their potatoes and it was cooked just right. When it comes to extravagant places like these you really will enjoy all the types of dishes they serve you. Everything was just at the right temperature and right flavor. I didn't have to add salt or pepper to anything. My tastebuds were happy!!   I would love to come back here! I would most definitely recommend this place to everyone. When I'm Vegas....see the view! This is the place to do it! They also have rides on top of the Stratosphere!!",

The restaurant alone may be a four, but access to the observation deck and the views during dinner pushes the overall rating to a five.  My husband and I celebrated our anniversary here shortly after moving to town. We loved our meals and thought the service was top notch. I liked that the delicious bread came out with three different types of butter. My lobster bisque was pretty good and my husband liked his caesar salad as well. My steak was well prepared and flavorful. For dessert, we split a bananas foster dish that was both unique and delicious. It was nice to be able to check out the observation deck after we finished our meal too.  We visited a second time when my parents were in town. My parents were just as impressed with the experience as we were. It's a good option for out of town guests because the rotating view gives some entertainment while you enjoy the meal.   I'd recommend this restaurant/experience for locals and tourists alike.",

As a local, we have tried the very best such as Hells Kitchen, SW Steakhouse, and Gordan Ramsey Steakhouse but never found anything that compared to the experience of Top of The World. Our recent visit was to celebrate my wifes birthday too which our experience unfolded.... I booked a reservation about 1 week ago and was given plenty options for time (had the impression the restaurant was not booked up). Upon arriving on time, we were seated at an inner table having to stare across at another party to glance at the view (how awkward). Looking around, there were plenty of empty window tables. I asked the waitress to be moved and was told those tables are not open. It was also relayed that if we wanted to move, it would be a 1.5 hour wait. 10 minutes later, two tables opened up and we were not offered to move. By the look on other guests in our situation, I could tell that they also were pretty upset that only a small portion of the restaurant seating was open. Everyone had been crammed into one area and am venturing a guess this was to make it appear that the restaurant was busy. In all of the times I have dined at this restaurant, it has never been full but was always offered to sit at a window table which far outweighs the impression of feeling \"special\" for dining in a busy restaurant.  As mentioned in other recent reviews, the menu has been trimmed down considerably. Our favourite chilean sea bass and succotash were missing. When talking with the waitress, it was mentioned that chilean sea bass is on the endangered list and succotash is just not offered anymore. As an alternative, we ordered the filet mignon, halibut, and creamed sweet corn which were both excellent!!! Upon finishing the meal, I had mentioned that it was my wifes birthday to the waitress and was told that if we ordered a desert they would put a candle in it... wow!! I am completely gobsmacked at the fact that the restaurant could not provide a complementary dessert to my wife for her birthday considering my bill was $170!!!  This restaurant continues to serve food that is of the highest standards but has forgotten about what makes it stand out against all other restaurants on the strip..... view and service!!!",

By far the most unique factor this restaurant has is the fact that it rotates a full 360 degrees as you're eating, over the course of an hour and a half I believe, so take your time to enjoy the good company and good food. The seafood my table had was extremely good and very fresh tasting and the service really helped polish the night off perfectly with family.",

Zachary M. was my waiter and he was \"johnny on the spot\".  I had a beer and a small Caesar salad.  They served three different breads and some handmade crackers.  the butter had lava salt and something else and it was very good.  Zachary was knowledgeable about the views.  I then got to go to the top and take more pictures.  I did not ride any of the rides.  the cost of lunch was $23.  I would have spent $20 or $25 just to go to the top and get a view.  Having lunch is the way to go.  I think if they offered going to the top at $10 they would get more people but they probably charge what they charge so you will stop in for lunch.  Great afternoon.

I ordered the $74 dollar Waygu steak.  I was expecting to be blown away. I was.. with how HORRIBLE it was.    First, when enjoying a steak at this price, I was expecting to taste the meat.  It was covered in sauteed onions like a cheap $6 dollar Salisbury steak.  It was cooked medium well when I asked for medium rare.  You can get a better steak at a coffee shop.  I didn't send the steak back because my wife set the reservation up and I didn't want her to think I wasn't appreciating the experience. So I had to sit back and choke down this horrible piece of meat knowing that I was going to be paying over $300 for the dinner, which made it all that much worse.  The desert is no better than a $20 Vegas strip buffet.    I wish I took a photo of the meal to share. Anyhow, the view is great and so is the atmosphere and that is what you are paying for. So bottom line. Go there for a few drinks and save yourself aggravation by having dinner elsewhere.  5 Stars for restaurant atmosphere, 1 star for food. 2 stars total.",

    "text": "Top of the World is a MUST when you're in Vegas. We had the best night experience from start to finish. Our table was positioned at the windows for the incredible 360-degree view of the city, wow! The Top of the World is a high class restaurant that rotates around every 80 min or so and gives you the most spectacular views of the city.     It is very unfortunately that I forgot the name of my waiter but man hands down to world class service! Our waiter was very knowledgeable about the menu and was capable of thoroughly explaining any dish that we asked about. He also made recommendations based on our likes. He started us off with a complimentary starter that included different breads with 3 types of butter (ginger & orange, basil pesto & classic) and we ordered a few cocktails to start the night. I ordered my all-time favorite Sapphire Gin & Tonic.    For my main entree I ordered the Rack of Lamb and they were very tender and superb! The racks were seasoned with fresh condiments and spices to perfection. The sauce that was used was not overwhelming and it just was right. The fresh ingredients gave the rack of lamb a great flavor taste by diminishing the scent of the lamb. Lamb meat in general has a very strong smell and taste but if \"cured\" right with the proper seasoning then that natural taste will diminish and an enhanced taste will take place. I really recommend this dish to anyone that goes.   At the end of our dinner we decided to continue the night with more cocktails by moving to Sky Lounge Bar in the floor above the restaurant. Make sure you visit the Sky Lounge Bar on the 107th floor! It is definitely worth the breath-taking views!   The overall experience from start to finish lasted about 3 hours and all I can say is that it is worth every penny. This restaurant is pricey, so be prepared to spend a little over $150 per person if you decide to do dinner and cocktails all together.   Interesting note: The lobby elevator travels up at 21 miles per hour!",

The only thing is that there is a lounge above the restaurant and you can hear all the obnoxiously loud drunk people during dinner.   Atmosphere: 4.5/5  The food was great and much larger portions than I expected. My boyfriend and I shared the pork belly starter which was delicious, and I had the salmon for my entree which was a huge piece of excellently cooked salmon. I didn't taste my boyfriends steak but he said it was pretty good even though there were many fatty pieces he was cutting off. Oh and the cheese rolls and flavored butters they bring you are fantastic.   Food: 4.5/5  Service was nice but for the price and fine dining I would expect a bit better. There was nothing really wrong with the service but my glass was empty a few times and I asked for a lemon for my water which I never ended up receiving.   Service: 4/5  Overall it was a very romantic lovely night and I would definitely enjoy going again in the future.",

    "text": "Top of the World Restaurant, located on the top level of The Stratosphere Hotel and Casino, is a bit of old school fine dining that banks heavily on its rotating dining room that offers a wonderful view of Las Vegas and the surrounding area. The reviews seem to run hot and cold here, with the complaints primarily surrounding price and poor service. As for the former, yes it is pricy ... but the price does include access to the tower, which is $18/person. Factor that into the price of the meal and, depending on what you get, can be a pretty good deal. As for the service, I had no issues, except for the mechanical issue they were experiencing that prevented the restaurant from rotating until the very end of the meal.  I had planned a lunch with a business colleague during my Vegas vacation, I let him choose the location, and I picked this out of the options he suggested. He also suggested the lobster bisque and, as many other reviews have noted, it is heavenly. Possibly the best soup I have ever had. For my entree I went for ultra-decadence with their \"Ultra Burger\" topped with foie gras. The burger itself is made from braised short rib, topped with a choice of cheese and a healthy portion of foie gras. My colleague ordered the NY Steak served with a poached egg, and potato hash. It was something he had never ordered there before, but he had no complaints.  My only complaint is that there was no draft beer, and the bottled beer selection was weak. But their bread, served before the meal with three different types of spreads, was outstanding. That orange butter ... so so good. Before tax and tip, and factoring out the $18 each for Tower Admission, the two meals, lobster bisque, and drinks were about $50, before tax and tip. (And since they are factoring in the price of Tower Admission in their meals, that's why they charge a minimum and a fee for splitting plates)  Dinner may not be as great of a value, but if you are dying to go up in the tower and are willing to pay the $18 admission, then IMO you'd be crazy not to get lunch at Top of the World. Back out the $18 admission price and you are getting some REALLY great lunch options for $8-$14. The food, and the view, are both well worth it.",

I personally had the surf and turf and the steak was the best I have ever had (I have had a lot!) literally melted in my mouth.   The lobster was amazingly tender also! No overly fishy taste which I run into a lot.  My boyfriend had the chicken and it was also very tender!! Boy was it delicious also? (Not as good as mine though ;)   Others had the wedge salad, lobster bisque, chefs tasting menu, pasta dish. All said it was amazing. We also got the cheese potatoes for the table and the crust was yummy!!!! The bread to hold you over is also great.   And the view wow the view was amazing!!!! Best part of my trip!!! I have already told people they have to go and experience  it. It was worth every cent.  The restaurant rotates so you have a amazing view the whole time it takes about an hour to completely rotate   We also had a few drinks our total was about 400 really not that bad for the quality of food and a group of 6. The waiter was also awesome!! I plan to go back here with just my boyfriend one of these days for a romantic evening.",

This time, we got a table right by the window - thus, giving us an even more amazing view. And a thunderstorm was happening in the distance, which added to the coolness of the view. It was a Sunday night, but it wasn't particularly busy. Our server was absolutely outstanding! We started with the oysters, which were seriously fabulous (some of the best in town). And, of course, we had to have steak. This time, though, we added a lobster tail to one and king crab legs to the other. Oh so delicious! Perfectly prepared and super fresh. Definitely splurge and create your own surf and turf. The steaks were perfectly cooked and quite tasty. And the bernaise sauce was amazing. You really must eat here! Excellent food paired with exceptional service and the best view in town. And they never rush you even slightly. Plus, after your meal, you can head up to the very top for free.",

Salty to a point that you would want to spit it out (disgusting!).  Returned it and they brought out another SALTY lobster.  At this point, there is no reason to bring out another SALTY lobster, so we asked to have it be removed from the bill.  Surf and Turf $89, they removed $20 since that is all the Lobster is worth.  You've got to be kidding me.  I held back my rage and asked for them to remove 50% off the $89.  Not counting that this whole thing ruined our nice dinner, disrupted it bringing out another SALTY lobster and the audacity of insulting us with a $20 discount.  SHAME ON YOU TOP OF THE WORLD \"MANAGER\"  Please go back managing the buffet line and learn some decorum....my suggestion...within the \"Fine Dining\" arena.

    "text": "My husband and I decided to dine here to celebrate his birthday and our wedding anniversary. We have been living here in Las Vegas for a year, but have never been inside the Stratosphere. There are signs in the hotel that direct you to the restaurant, although it is quite a walk (well at least it seemed that way the first time). They make you walk through the Tower Shops, so you may run into the annoying sales people who work in the kiosks. After you check in, they will send you through a security checkpoint. So leave all your weapons and anything illegal at home, LOL. Dress code is business casual, although we did see a few people wearing jeans.  Well the best thing about this place is the view! We went at night and it was amazing! The restaurant revolves 360 degrees every 80 minutes and it goes slowly so you don't really feel like you are moving. I think the motor was underneath or near the booth that we sat in because every so often we felt our butts vibrate!  The food was alright, but honestly I was expecting much more from a restaurant like this. We ordered:  -Roasted Scottish Salmon with creamy Fennel Sauce: I know that salmon is salmon. But this one was very tasty. The Fennel sauce added a lot of flavor.  -16 oz. Rib Eye: my husband ordered this and said that it was one of the best tasting steaks ever!  -Yukon Gold Mashed Potatoes: nothing special, just regular mashed potatoes. But it turned cold very quickly :(  -Ricotta Gnocchi Mac and Cheese: the pasta was very overcooked and they went overboard with the truffle oil.  -Cookies and Cream Cheesecake Lollipops: You dip these in vanilla sauce and crushed Oreos. Each order comes with 2 lollipops. They were good but a little too sweet for me.   -Ice Cream: one huge scoop!  Customer Service was average. Our server was nice but it seemed like he was rarely around. The people who refilled our drinks were very attentive. Also, the woman who was taking pictures at every table passed by and ignored us a few times. Maybe she has something against Asians?   Honestly, I don't feel like I would want to come back again. The price and the quality of the food was just not equal. But I'm glad I got to experience this!",

    "text": "As locals, it's a shame it took me over four years to finally visit this restaurant.  The occasion was my pending birthday and my girlfriend made the reservation.  From the cocktale waitress giving directions to the reservation verifyer to the security guard to the one of many elevator operators, they all made us feel welcome and it was so obvious they were engaged in making \"an experience\" instead of just another dinner reservation.  Our waiter, Bon, and his able helper, Alma, gave the best table service with fun, food and tales of the city and area that were new to us.  For an appetizer, we selected the grilled portobello and buffalo mozzarella that was an absolute wonderful way to start the evening.  Coupled with fresh bread and humongous sheet chips. our taste buds were woken up.  For an entree and as the birthday fella, I chose the surf & turf with 10 oz center cut and garlic Mexican prawns.  The presentation, aroma and flavor all melted into one with the first bite and stayed through the very last scooping of Yukon Gold mashed potatoes.  This is one of the best overall meals I've ever had the pleasure of.  Perfect seasoning, temperatures, textures and ease of navigating the feast.  I accepted the recommended pairing of Chateau Coutet, St. Emilion and there couldn't have been a better choice of wine.  Served early in the meal, the wine enhanced and brought out the deep beef and prawn flavors throughout the experience.  Going a bit overboard for the birthday, I selected the Chocolate Delight (?) that is almost indescribable.  As much as I didn't want to finish off with anything too heavy or rich, this was a perfect selection.  Enough chocolate in casing and cake to satisfy even the most demanding tastebuds, but light enough to leave a pleasantly full, but not overstuffed, feeling when it was time to go.  Not much said about the absollutely breathtaking views from 800+ feet above Las Vegas Blvd with bunjee jumpers taking off down the side of the building and the carnivall rides that go scarily over the edge of the building were enough to remain a memory for a lifetime.    I don't recall the Asst General Manager's name, but he stopped by several times during our experience to see how things were going and to share a thought about the venue and views.  Good stuff.  Will do again!",

I knew well that what I was paying for was the view (109th floor)and I feel coming in with this state of mind was helpful. See, the view really is SPECTACULAR and the fact that you're rotating the entire time is like nothing you'll probably ever do (while eating). The craziest thing, was just sitting there as people jumped off the building (no, Vegas didn't suddenly become suicide friendly, they have an attraction where you bungee off the very top of the building). It's an experience and I'm glad I can say I did it. The food was alright, I tasted some of my friends dishes and I had no complaints about their food, I had the churassco with au gratin potatoes. Their pork belly was tasty and their lobster bisque was alright but could have used a little less nutmeg. Like I said, at $101 dollars for a one person meal, you're paying mostly for the view.",

    "text": "This place should get less then one star... Too bad it is not an option!!! I am a chef here in Las Vegas and had a special guest come in from out of town and wanted to show him VEGAS! What a better way to start off showing Vegas to him by dinner at the top of the world restaurant at the stratosphere. With views of the strip and showing him where we're going to go each day that he was here. We got to the restaurant on time for our reservation, but still had to wait 30 minutes. We then were sat down with no attention to us at all. Finally somebody came by to take our drink order, but we had already had drinks before the restaurant. We then proceeded to order our food. We were waiting and waiting for our food and while waiting I noticed there was a little bread plate and a butter knife and it was empty. Empty for a very long time, and I was wondering if they were going to ever bring us bread. I'm just as we asked for it because I didn't want to wait any longer, our appetizer showed up and shortly after so did the bread. Our appetizer was the crab cake which was actually phenomenal. Or maybe it was because we were so hungry by the time it came.... We then had our delicious steak dinner which was Cooked to perfection! Unfortunately, my date started to not feel well. He proceeded to the restroom, which had only one stall and he was quite sick! He could not wait for the guest to leave the stall. Looking for a safe place to vomit, where it would not intrude on anybody too much, he found the door to the stairwell but it was locked. What happens if there was a fire and the stairwell is locked? Not knowing where to turn and it nature taking it's course on its own, my friend vomited by the reception desk. No one cared no one tried to help him no one tried to see if he was OK no one tried to see if he was there with anybody that could help him! He then took some time until he found our table since the restaurant spins and it's dark inside he had a hard time finding me. Once he found me he said I'm really sick, we have to go. I tried to find the waiter to get the bill, but he was nowhere to be found. Nobody came to our table to see if we needed anything or if we were OK or satisfied with the food or anything! A lot of time had passed I'm not sure how how much time but enough time for my date to throw up four times on top of the table with nobody coming around not a waiter not somebody filling water nobody! Finally the Waiter showed up, and asked us if we were ready for dessert! That's how oblivious and horrible the service was that they didn't even realize that their guest has been throwing up all over their table 4 times. Anyway finally he went to go get our bill which took a long time, then we gave him the credit card and he took a very long time to come back with that and we were able to safely get home. The next day, we called to speak to the manager of the restaurant to share with him this horrible service we had on the fact that my date was throwing up, and it could be a direct effect of the food that we ate we are not sure. He proceeded to say that we ruined the time and the ambience of the other patriots at the restaurant. And that it cost him a lot of money to have extra staff to come and clean up his mess. He offered us no compensation and when he said hold on to us on the phone, my date was telling me that the manager was being an asshole. Unfortunately or not unfortunately, the Manager heard this comment and hung up on us! This was the worst service I've ever had at any restaurant bar none ever!!!",

Well, lemme tell you...for a like the Top of the World, their service was REALLLLLY crappy. It took us about an hour or a little longer than that to get our food so our whole dinner took us about 2 hours. The food was definitely not worth it. Their menu did not have much of a variety and I think I can make a better meal at home lol.  The POSITIVE about this place is the environment and the experience. It was really cool being able to sit by the window and having a whole 360 degree view of Vegas and being able to see people bungee jump off the Stratosphere.   THE END!",

We decided to give it go after seeing an online deal come up for it and I'm glad we did.   The ambience is nice; the view of Las Vegas from the restaurant, as I'm sure goes without saying, is amazing. The service was also really great; our waiter was polite and attentive. We had a drink at the lounge upstairs while we waited for our table (the wait was much longer than they told us, but we were a no reservation walk-in, so no big deal).   The food: We started with the Lobster Bisque, which was really, really good. The bread they brought out was served with a very inters testing orange ginger butter that we both really enjoyed. My girlfriend had the rack of lamb and I had the New York steak; both were of great quality, were cooked perfectly and tasted delicious. I will say that the food feels a little dated here; that isn't to say that it wasn't executed amazingly, because it was, but it felt a little less current than I might have expected and I think that some other reviewers might be giving it less credit because of that.    It was well worth the price and I'm glad I finally made it there. The added bonus was that we were able to go to the observation deck (and to the rides) without paying the tower ticket ($12-$16 each).",

I made reservations in advance and arrived on time.  They were busy and we were advised to find a seat in the bar/lounge area, which we did.  We hardly got our drinks when we were summoned that our table was ready.  We were shown to the perfect table for two, right again the windows, so that we could observe all of Vegas and the restaurant revolves.  Wow, what a breathtaking adventure.    Our server was Dan D.  He was courteous, kind and easy to get along with.  He was also very attentive.  High marks for him!  This evening the restaurant had a 3 course special.  Soup or salad, meat or fish, and dessert.  We ordered the Lobster Bisque, which is always great.  I've had it here before.  It's one of the restaurant's specialties.  Next we had sort of a pasta appetizer presented.  They call it the four cheese Cavatelli.  It's part of the meal and no additional charge.  It was great, hot and fresh pasta in a meat sauce.  Next came the Filet.  WOW, was it great.  Tender as a mother's love!  Every bite was excellent and it was prepared just right.  Finally, we had ordered the Creme Brulee for dessert.  We were so stuffed we couldn't eat it.  Dan, our server, suggested we try at least one bite.  We did so and it was great.  Overall, I highly recommend you try Top of the World.  It's romantic and lots of fun.  The food is / was great!  Total bill: $129.90 without tip.",

My overall comment for my dining experience is this restaurant is missing out an opportunity to modernize!! The decor is very outdated and the menu has nothing that sets it apart from other well known steakhouse restaurants like Ruth's Chris or Capital Grille.  The service was decent, but the food was mediocre at best.  We ordered the Mary's Chicken which was a crab stuffed half chicken. The chicken tasted salty and I could barely taste or see the crab in the dish, but at least the chicken was cooked well. It was tender and juicy, not dry at all. Sides are separate and sharing sized so we also tried asparagus and decided to splurge on the lobster macaroni. The asparagus was cooked well and I liked how the outside was thinly peeled off to remove any tough parts - it was probably the best part of the dinner. The lobster macaroni was disappointing! The pasta was over cooked almost mushy, and had no flavor - it did not even taste like butter noodles.   Definitely an underwhelming dinner.   I'm giving this 2 stars because the view is amazing and at least the white cake that was a special order to the pastry chef for my friend's birthday was amazing.",

They first make you go through a metal detector at the front, no big deal keeping everyone safe.   When you finally get up to the top you check in and get seated at your table. (You can ask to be seated  next to the Window if you can handle it.) We got lucky and got a window seat. Wow what a view of the city. It takes 1hr and 20minutes to go all the way around. The first thing our server tells us is that if you see people falling of the edge this is normal due to the sky jump platform right above us!!!!   We started with one app the Kurobuta pork belly..... Amazing so good. It didn't take long to order our food. I got the Wagyu Rib eye and my fellow diners opted for the Kansas City Bone-In and the Aspen Ridge Ribeye. Omg talk about steak over load, they did not disappoint.The Wagyu is a lean cut but it just melts in your mouth. The Kansas City has more fat but oh baby this is a True rib eye. The Aspen is just as good with a horseradish crust..... For our sides they included Mashed Yukon Gold Potatoes and Twice Baked Potato with Bacon, Cheddar, and Green Onion.....   At this point we are filled to our hearts content, but of course we could not pass on dessert we got the trio of ice cream, vanilla,strawberry and chocolate!   We had a great time here and got to see all of Las vegas oh id say about 3 times or so... Yah we were here awhile eating, drinking and laughing with amazing views! Our server was awesome taking the time to explain the menu and offer up lots of suggestions. I will definitely be returning here soon.... Be sure to give this place a try and Happy eating",

I took my friend for her birthday and we saw this trip before the sunset during the sunset and after sunset... oh my God it was just spectacular! The filet mignon and the creme brulee were to die for. The Caesar salad was yummy and the only negative I could say was my crab cake was too salty. Their ice cream was so good I can only dream about it now.  The customer service was beyond phenomenal. #madmax and his assistant were amazing!  They made sure our experience was unforgettable in a good way. It's definitely a place I'd go back.  I now have two very $$$$ favorite restaurants. I think this is a perfect place for special occasions. Birthdays, anniversaries, engagements, or just to take your date to an unforgettable night. You can also go up after dinner several floors up to view the entire city without paying extra which was great. We were so lucky to have had a clear not breezy night. Pictures were breathtaking.",

As a local I've eaten here a handful of times and have always held a positive impression of this restaurant. I had 3 out of town guests with me last night and was embarrassed that this is the restaurant I brought them too.   The service was the most cringe-worthy part of the entire evening. The hostess was the only employee we encountered with an ounce of professionalism. The server couldn't explain the daily special and lacked professionalism and menu knowledge. At one point in the might a tray fell next to our table and swearing was heard by all of us. While I understand that mistakes happen, the response to it was painfully unprofessional.   The food was lackluster and dated, just like the restaurant itself.   The only positive out of this experience is that I now know not to take any more out of town guests here when they come to visit. I hope this restaurant is able to return to its former glory, but until that happens there's no need to dine here.",

With each deal, you get four courses(1 appetizer, pretty much two entrees, and dessert). With the drinks and tip, we spent a little less than $200. Although it isn't mentioned on the Groupon policy, the waiter informed us we would each need to order a drink. It could be any drink such as soda or alcoholic. We were okay with that. The waiter gave us suggestions between the options we had. The both opted for the filet mignon. It was a huge piece and we were not expecting it to be so big. It was cooked perfectly, and so tender! We got lobster bisque which I liked but for my husband, he said was too \"seafoody\" taste. I got the pasta which noodles were cooked al dente and perfect. But I didn't care too much for the stew type beef. Husband got the crab cake which was a little sweet but he gobbled that down. The salted caramel creme brulee was so good, just a little sweeter than most creme brulee's I've had. The basket of bread comes with sour dough bread and this delicious sweet bread covered in butter. It reminded me of those Asian sweet breads we buy from like 85 degree bakery. They serve the bread with a salted butter. I'd definitely go back to this place when back in Vegas.",

While reading review after review, I thought where else can you enjoy a highly praised meal while so high in the sky.  The adventure began as we ascended to the 106th floor and were seated at a plush table overlooking Vegas.  The views were absolutely gorgeous, which change as the restaurant slowly turns in a circle.  It turns so slowly that you dont actually feel it moving but if you turn away from the view for a minute and turn back, your view has changed.  Besides the breathtaking views, the food is mouthwatering delicious.  We had shrimp, scallops, king salmon and steak -- each of which does not have enough words to explain.  I recommend making a 4:30 - 5:00 reservation so you can observe a beautiful skyline turning to nightfall and sitting in the 2nd row (not right by the glass).  Truly the best restaurant I've ever been to.",

But the views are unbeatable. To mitigate the queasiness, sit facing the front of the aircraft.   The Caesar salad lettuce was perfectly cut, crisp and fresh. My filet mignon was perfectly cooked to medium rare. (Don't over-cook your steak, you heathens!) I chose the shrimp over lobster pairing. The 3 shrimp were also prepared perfectly and delicious.   The real highlight for me was the buttery mashed potatoes...with SRIRACHA.   Cleaned my plate spotless leaving the busboy baffled and confused.

Also, they say they have a dress code, but apparently shorts and ball caps are acceptable. If you are thinking about coming here, make sure and leave the baseball cap and basketball jersey at home/your hotel room. Maybe try a nice shirt and pants for a change.   Aside from the lack-luster dress code, this place is pretty great. Obviously, the view is amazing. It's a revolving restaurant, so no matter where you sit, you will have a great view. I don't remember exactly what it was called, but we basically had the Surf and Turf lunch special (it's about half as expensive as the dinner portion). They have a full bar and fancy breads are served at your table. I had the lobster bisque (may have been called a chowder), and it was delicious.   For the main course, a beautiful lobster tail and an absolutely delicious medium rare steak appeared for me (see picture). My wife had the steak and shrimp version and it was just as good. The lobster came with butter (of course) and it was to die for. Every thing we had for lunch there was simply amazing.   The service was great, so make sure and tip accordingly. We each had a drink with the meal and the bill came to just under $200, so plan ahead. If we were there for dinner and drinks, I'm assuming it would be in the $300 range.

Truth be told, that is what you are paying for here is the experience. A revolving restaurant above The Strip that you occasionally see people bungee jump off of.  There are a lot of great choices on the menu. My wife and I opted for Chef's Tasting Menu at $98 per person without wine pairings. After looking at what we wanted to have individually, it worked out to be about the same. I started with the Lobster Bisque, then the Kurobuta Pork Belly, and ended with the Filet Mignon and Shrimp Scampi. Unfortunately, I can't recall what my wife had. Which, for me, means the food was just ok, and it was. Based upon other yelp reviews, I was expecting better things from the food. The prices and the food are way off so expect to drop some serious cash.   For the two of us, our bill came to $283 without tip. That included our food and two drinks a piece. I feel, the for the quality of the food we had, the Chef's Tasting menu would have been more reasonably priced at $50 per person, and the drinks at about $10 to $12 a piece. Most of you can tell from my reviews that I am more than willing to drop some serious cash for a good meal, but this wasn't that kind of meal.   Getting to the restaurant is probably the most interesting part. I likened it to waiting to get on a ride at Disneyland, except there was a metal detector involved. You practically walk through the whole casino, then up stairs and escalators, through the metal detector and onto an elevator that takes 30 seconds to go 106 floors up.   If you want just a unique experience and don't care about price, then dine at Top of the World. I will probably go back at some point, but probably just to the lounge. I recommend taking Uber or Lyft to get to the Stratosphere. It will help you avoid the headache of parking. Also, book through Opentable. It is much easier than calling the restaurant.",

Dessert was Creme Brulee made to perfection. My wife had Chop salad,an incredible version of French Onion Soup cheesecake for dessert. All incredibly delicious.I highly recommend top of the world restaurant.",

Our reservation was at 11:30 and didn't leave until 2p that's how bad the service was. And it wasn't even bz! She gave us our bill and didn't even mention on how to use our dining credit. She was a terribly waitress. And for a place to be a 5 star restaurant they should probably hire people who have a nice demeanor and attitude. And know how to do their job.",

    "text": "We recently went to this restaurant.  The food was overall pretty good.  With so many exciting and gourmet restaurants in Las Vegas, it does not really keep up though.  The food is old fashioned but mostly done well.  I ordered salmon that was clearly previously frozen and so fishy that it made me gag.  Then a busser spilled a whole pitcher of heavy cream on us.  The manager was called and he was very apologetic and comped us nearly the whole meal.  The waiter was extremely personable and attentive and clearly felt terrible about the experience.  Now, for the view.  I don't get why everyone says it so great. I think it's best to go late so that you don't actually see all the economically depressed streets that are within view of the hotel.  It's unattractive and depressing to look at.  Once it gets dark, you can see the strip when the restaurant is rotated in that direction, and its fun to look at.  In addition, the Stratosphere hotel is one of the seediest, grossest hotels I have ever had the displeasure to walk through and it definitely takes the whole experience down a notch.    Sorry, I don't think this was nearly as much of a great experience as it was chalked up to be.",

I had the Filet Mignon and the big potato and it was very very yummy. The service on the other hand wasn't too great! We arrived and got a rose and we were taken to our table. Once we arrived at the table the waiter handed our menus to us not explaining anything and asked if we wanted water. They have ice water or bottle we didn't get those options. Later learned about it because a different waiter offered it to the table next to us. Then when our waiter came back he asked what we wanted to drink. Since we don't drink we asked for a lemonade and he seemed annoyed. He then came and asked for a food order and again he was annoyed. Our food arrived and our lemonade was still missing. We asked the person who brought our food out. Not everyone's experience is going to be the same I did notice other waiters and their good customer service making me wish they were my waiters.

    "text": "My husband and I planned on eloping in Las Vegas (see my review for the Little White Wedding Chapel) and in preparation I made a reservation at the Top of the World a few months in advance.  This was to be our big celebration dinner the night after we married.  I requested a window seat, of course, which I was nervous we may not get but hoped for the best.    The night of our dinner we dressed to the nines and barely ate all day so we could save our appetite.  When we arrived we did have to wait a little longer than I hoped considering we had an 8:45 p.m. reservation.  We went to the lounge which is on another floor, grabbed a drink, then headed out to the observation deck to see what all the fuss is about.  It really is a fantastic view.    The reason I can't give a five star review is because in addition to our wait, when our buzzer went off we simply couldn't find our way back to the restaurant!  the lounge is on a different floor and the bartender's directions were very obscure.  I don't know how we did it but we did.   i know it sounds silly but it honestly was not easy to navigate :o)    The food, service and wine, however, IS five star.  the prices were a little intimidating because we are by no means \"fancy.\"  In fact, we were nervous that we would act too silly or that our manners may be sub par hahaha.  The server (I wish i could remember his name) was great.  We started with oysters and lobster bisque.  Very fresh and very, very tasty.  I'm from New England so I consider myself fairly educated on what is good seafood.    My husband got the filet and alaskan crab leg while i got the filet and lobster tail.  Perfectly cooked.  absolutely delicious.  the menu offers wine suggestions for each dish, which we went with because we are not experts on wine and food pairings.  They were spot on.  The meal was so savory, we were very happy.    With the food aside, the restaurant itself was incredible.  Oh, we DID get that window seat, by the way :o)   We were there for nearly two hours (not because of service, we wanted to take our time, which they didn't seem to mind at all) and because the restaurant floor rotates 360 degrees every hour or so, we got the most fantastic, romantic view of the strip.  The only thing (and they do warn you) that was a little odd was the jumpers dropping from the top of the Stratosphere outside of the window.  Honestly, we thought it was funny.    Overall I had a wonderful time.  the food was delicious and the staff was great.  One of the managers was adorable; he came over to thank my husband for bringing \"such a beautiful young lady into the restaurant.\"  Maybe he was just buttering us up but it worked haha.  Very beautiful, very romantic and tasty.",

The dessert tray is on the non spinning part and you see it as you are moving by. Our meal for two was about $120 ( one alcoholic drink, two sodas, to entrees, a side of potato, and a dessert to share). But with out thinking twice I would go again!!",

I have eaten at a lot of nice restaurants in Chicago, LA, San Diego, Chicago, and other major cities, and this place was not up to par on any level except the view.  First of all, the service was slow. I definitely understand if a restaurant is busy, but when your food comes out cold and the waiter doesn't check on you for long periods of time, that is an issue.  Secondly, the food was mediocre at best. If I am paying a lot of money per person, I expect at least a decent meal. Personally, I would have been more satisfied with a meal from a restaurant half the price.  The portion sizes were good, and the wine was delicious. The view was also amazing! However, it became very dark in the restaurant when the sun went down (this may be to make the view outside better).  I would not go back to this restaurant, but if you are looking for a great view, I would recommend going for wine and dessert. Do not waste your time on  the food.",

However once we arrived everything went downhill from that point. There were several vacant tables that were close to the window and we saw parties of Twos being seating there. After being seated by the hostess we waiting quite some time for our food. We were able to talk to the manager on duty (Bald headed stocky guy) we asked to be relocated from where we sat. He stated, \"We do not change tables because we have a full night of reservations and our policy is not change tables.\" Mind blown and pissed off I was annoyed as was my girlfriend. Not to mention our table candle holder was empty along with several other tables. (Way to set the mood TOW.) Apparently attention to detail is not a priority to you. Its either all tables have a lit candle or dont place a candle holder on the tables at all. Its looks tacky. We asked the server about this and she tells us, \"oh they are charging them.\" Are you kidding me!!! Today is Valentine's Day!!!! Helloooo TOW Management you should have done this the night before!!!! Sigh, we ordered from the Valentine's Day Menu which was $199.00 with pre-arranged courses. Each course portion size was very small yet at times salty. It was a joke!!! I left hungry. Needless to say I was a little embarrassed for bringing my girlfriend here. TOW is a good atmosphere for the view but dont expect much more than that or else youll be just as disappointed as me and my date for the price.",

It is hard to describe how beautiful it is from the top of this tower.  We were seated in one of the booths facing the windows which was cozy and comfy.  I was in the mood for a good steak so I ordered the filet done medium rare.  The soup of the day was a tomato bisque which was flavorful and a nice way to start the meal.  Our server suggested a Merlot that did not disappoint(thank you Karen).  My steak was tender and delicious,but I do have one minor complaint, I love my food hot and the steak was a bit cool when I received it.  Our server Karen was terrific which made the dining experience even better.  The food was good not over the top fabulous but the view was something I will never forget.",

We requested a table by the window by Open Table which they happily provided. However, the booths look cozy and you can see the view right in front of you, especially if there's only two of you.  I agree with the reviews I have read on Yelp. The atmosphere and service are top notch and the food good, but not 5 stars. You are paying for the experience but it is not out of line with all the other nicer restaurants on the strip and those don't have the view! We started with the \"complimentary\" bread beakfast with 3 kinds of butter and I ordered the lobster bisque which was yummy! My martini was made perfectly.Then I ordered the lobster, shrimp, scallop combo and my date ordered the lamb. My seafood was cooked perfectly, not dry or rubbery, but I didn't care for the tomato sauce. It also had a white garlic type sauce that I preferred. Both sauces were  on the bottom and around the seafood so you could work around it if you didn't care for it. The lamb was a little chewy and we didn't care for the tomato sauce on that either. However, both dishes went well with our speical bottle of wine that we brought with us. (extra kuddos for letting us bring our own wine- with corkage fee, of course!) Service was great! Which leads me to the panic part of the evening... So, as we all know this restaurant slowly revolves to give you a 360 view in about an hour. Sitting next to the windows it can seem like you are sitting still as the outside moves around you. in reality the opposite is True. Well, when I first sat down, I put my purse next to my chair, on the floor, on the window side so it would be out of the way. About midway through my martini, I looked down and realized my purse was missing! Then I noticed that the floor was moving and I had put my purse on a section that was not! So, basically my purse was visiting all the other tables along the whole perimeter of the restaurant! Just taking a little ride around! LOL. I got up to go find it and the waiters all assured me this happens all the time, to sit down and enjoy my evening and they would locate it! And they did, everything was intact. They said they had never had a problem with a purse not being returned, only a shoe was never found! hahaha! Guess if you have a shoe fetish this could be your place! But, I couldn't help wonder why, if this happens all the time, why didn't the hostess warn me?  And, yes, I will go back!",

I started with the Lobster Bisque soup, it was ok. I would rather have a bowl of pho. Then my entree was Surf and Turf crab cake.. it was good, nothing special.  You can also see people sky dive off the floor above us while eating. I got surprise when I seen a person falling. Did a guy just jump off? Pretty cool.  Also a lady keep coming over to try and take a picture but kindly told her to give us time. She came back and said let me know when your ready to take a picture we were like ok. So she came back. Kinda felt sorry for her she was an older lady.. very nice. She took our picture and said she will be right back after she prints and put it in one of those hard paper frames. The thing is it was like $20-25 bucks.",

What a spectacular view this restaurant provided. The food, ambiance and service were superb. If you want to try something fun for dessert, try the three scoops of sorbet (raspberry, mango and orange) with mint and crystalized sugar. What a treat! Make sure you share this dessert as it is very large. In fact, everything they serve is large so make sure you have an appetite. We enjoyed ourselves and will definitely return.   Visited July 2013",

I walked in hoping we can get a good seat because in the back of my head I thought my request wouldn't have met since it was very busy. However, we got the best seats in the house! It was our first time there and it was absolutely breath taking. I didn't really read what the hype was about but when I walked in....we actually realized it was SPINNING . It was SO COOL. We started off by getting complimentary bread and butter. They provide 3 different types of butter and all 3 were so good. My favorite was the one with pineapples! The food is definitely on the pricey side but it was so worth it. I got the Wagyu steak with a side of potato puree and mushrooms. IT WAS MOUTH WATERING. Everything was super delicious and my friend had the best 30th birthday here. We will definitely be returning to celebrate more events here.",

    "text": "Went to dinner with the Better Half at the Top of the World Restaurant.  I've been there for lunch many times, but have never been for dinner.  We were seated at a table along the edge of the restaurant, which had a perfect, unobstructed view of the valley.  Since our reservations were for 6:30 pm in the 1st week of April, we knew we were going to get a great view of the sunset.  The waitress was very friendly and told us to take our time.  Here's a brief summary of our experience:  Wine - We ordered a bottle of 2006 Scott Harvey Zinfandel.  It had a nice bite to it....hints of blackberry and pepper made it robust....yum!  Appetizer - Portobello Mushroom, Red Pepper, and Buffalo Mozzarella in Olive Oil and Balsamic Vinegar......one of our favorites.  Very good.  Entree - Lobster Tail stuffed with Crab meat.  Prime New York Strip with peppercorn crust.  Very, very good.  The meat was cooked just right.  Side Dishes - Sides are ordered separately here.  We had Foie Gras, Risotto Gnocchi with Cheese, and Au Gratin Potatoes with Cheese.  The Au Gratin were a little overcooked, but the rest of them were fantastic!  Dessert - They offered small desserts, which is perfect because I really hate large dessert dishes.  I think they're a waste of money and food.  The Better Half had a chocolate something or other...can't remember right now (Thank you Scott Harvey!) ...I had the strawberry cheesecake lollipops and the cookies & cream lollipops....with dipping sauce and crumbled cookies....yes, they are as good as it sounds.  Check out the photos above to see them.  Service - We were treated well from start to finish.  We had to ask for water a few times but that was the only strike against a perfect evening.  I would have scored the restaurant 5 stars, but I felt that the menu was lacking more vegetarian options.  At the time of this visit I was trying to avoid eating meat....not go vegetarian, but just avoid it for a while.  There was only a grilled vegetable option, which sounded \"blah\" to me....so I broke my diet and went for the Prime NY Strip.  Would I visit this place again?  Absolutely!  Awesome place to take your significant other and spend a romantic evening overlooking the Vegas Valley.",

Needless to say we didn't purchase those pics didn't particularly want to be reminded of that portion of our trip. The food was alright a decent filet mignon and the scallops were good but dessert was lackluster as was the lobster bisque and salads oh but definitely get the amazing twice backed potato is you come it's huge and is such gooey goodness.

We had the Cesar salad which was delicious (the croutons are better at Grimaldi's Pizza).  We shared the Surf and Turf.  The 10oz steak was amazing.  All the fat had been trimmed away and all that was left was the most tender and flavorful steak I've ever had.  The lobster was delicious as well.  The duo chocolate desert we had was decadent.  Yes, the view was spectacular.  Yes, the service was good.  We also had the pleasure of having our photo taken by Sherrie, the restaurant photographer.  She was amazing.  She took shots of us together and of us individually.  Yes, I know she's a professional photographer, but I didn't expect her to go to that much effort setting up our poses and the pictures turned out fantastic.  It's not often a reviewer spends this much time gushing over the photographer vs the meal, but Sherrie deserves high praise.  She made out wonderful night out immortal with her beautiful photos.  Thank you, Sherrie.  After dinner, we went up to the observation deck.  The view was incredible and it was loads of fun watching the people on the rides.  This is a great date night out for anyone who wants a wonderful environment, a delicious dinner, and memories of a life time.",

    "text": "Not sure what to expect exactly in terms of cuisine, we were happy to find it was a good ol' steak place.  Maybe not a steakhouse in it's True form, but steak place nonetheless.  We arrived a bit early for our reservation, considering we did a pit stop on the floors above (the guys went on the thrill rides), so we decided to wait for the rest of our dining party at the bar.  The bar itself does not revolve, so it was quite interesting to see the tables below you moving as well as feel some of the residual aftershocks of some of the rides.  My Long Island Iced Tea (or their variation) was quite nice though a bit warm and the guys' drinks, according to them, were actually a bit weak.  The waitress was kind enough to bring them back for an extra shot and didn't charge...though also kind enough to point out that normally they would.  For some reason, I did have to go back to the hostess' to remind them that our entire party was here, because it was well beyond 15 minutes past our reservation and it seemed like they had forgotten us.  Considering that upon making the reservation they were required to provide us with the dress code (dining attire - no jeans, t-shirts, hats, or sneakers), they were pretty rude and abrasive when I tried to inquire if there was a reason for the delay in our seating.  Not very courteous I tell ya.  But aside from that really, our waiter was extremely pleasant and even kind enough to take a group shot...which I am sure they get asked all the time.  Everyone seemed to enjoy their food, and although my steak was overcooked....it was still pretty tasty, alongside of the mashed potatoes and crab cake it came with (I got the surf and turf).  My salad was also pretty tasty, and the bread basket another thing to look forward too, as it was paired nicely with some flavored butter.  (Sorry for going a bit backwards there with the courses).  If there is anything to truly note about their entrees though, is that even though the menu says the steaks do not come with sides...they actually do.  Everyone had some kind of potato (mashed or au gratin) alongside of their steak...in addition to the sides we actually ordered.  And if your waiter tells you the sides can only feed 1, he's lying.  It's a good 2 person/portion serving.  I do recommend the mac & cheese or the gnocchi with truffle oil (just make sure you like truffle oil..it can be a bit rich).   **NOTE TO SELVES** If you are planning to eat at that Top of the World Restaurant, you get to go up the observatory FOR FREE!",

Was told that due to the seating request, they would be able to get us the table until 9:15pm, which I agreed to do. We arrived 5 minutes early. Now the lady told us that they were 20 minutes behind. I said it was okay as long as we got the seating reserved. Was told that of we wanted the seating by the window, we had to wait another hour to an hour and half.  I told them that the reason why we had to opt for a later dinner was because that was the earliest time they could get us in for the seating requested. She was very rude and acted like she didn't care, that they had enough diners anyway. If there is a way to give a minus star, I would have given them 10 minus star for customer service. That simply ruined the special birthday celebration night. What an awful place. It's already expensive to start with. And being treated like that was really a huge disappointment. Will NEVER come back again, not even if the food is free. There's no need to treat your customers that way! If they could not meet the time they had guaranteed us, then they should have given us a free appetizer or a free drink or a discount to accommodate the wasted time!!!!",

    "text": "I didn't realize that the restaurant was revolving at first- but when Dad pointed it out, I started feeling a sense of vertigo (although it went away pretty quickly). The view is INCREDIBLE (although you're up so high that the streets/cars below are reminiscent of a child's playmat). The waitress was extremely friendly. Mom ordered an apple martini; I ordered a white gummi bear cocktail. Most places will tell you they don't have the drink, and that's the end of that. But the bar was VERY accommodating and said they would put the drink together for me if I listed all the ingredients (slight miss, but the drink was still pretty strong).   Neither Mom nor I were really hungry (she just wanted soup, and I had JUST eaten somewhere else), so Dad ordered an appetizer and a five-course tasting menu to share.   Appetizer: Calamari (pretty good, but I was so busy chatting with Mom that I'm not sure there was anything particularly special about it) First course:  Mom picked the lobster bisque (she liked it) Second course: Beef Tenderloin Carpaccio (VERY moist and tender) Third course: Muscovy Duck with Hoisin Lime and Baby Lobster Tail (the plate was in front of Dad, so I don't remember duck, but I vaguely remember him asking me if I wanted any... and I probably said no. The baby lobster tail was also very moist, albeit a little on the salty side) Fourth course: There was supposed to be a chef's assortment of gourmet imported and domestic cheeses with seasonal fresh fruit (either Dad replaced this with an appetizer, or he inhaled everything with lightning speed while I was in the bathroom, because I did NOT see this at the table. And no, I was not drunk from my cocktail) Fifth course: Mini Desserts Trio. The dessert plate included banana bread (very good also... Dad usually doesn't care for banana bread), a chocolate/caramel torte (too sweet in my opinion, but it was Dad's favorite), and a raspberry mousse (my favorite of the three, because it wasn't overly sweet).  Overall, a pleasant experience for my first actual meal in Vegas. It's a little far from the main area of the strip, but I would definitely wander back here again.",

Second, try to pick a sunny day to come because the view is awesome. DATE alert!!! If you wanna impress a girl on a first date, I definitely recommend this place. Now get back to the food and service. The food portion was decent and actually good. The service was very good also. The price is actually not bad when you think about the location and view.",

    "text": "Over hyped, over expensive food. I'm a True believer that good food should not cost an arm and a leg. But if its expensive it should taste better than Olive garden. I had the lobster bisque which tasted good during the first 5 spoon fulls but become too rich for a large bowl ($12). For entree, I ordered the seafood alfredo with lobster, prawns and scallops. Lobster was overcooked and I only found 2 chunks ($45). The pasta tasted like whole wheat pasta and I'm pretty sure the menu did not state whole wheat. I sampled my friend's salmon dish ($40) and it tasted overcooked and dried out. I also tried the foie gras tater tots ($11) which tasted more like mediocre hush puppies than anything like foie gras. The Mini desserts trio are not even worth mentioning. I was really looking forward to the meal and its sad that I prefer Olive Garden over this place. Yes, the view is pretty awesome and its rotating. But you can pay $16 to check out the view and walk around it slowly if you want to simulate the rotating view. There are so many better options on/off the strip!  If you like thrill rides, check out Big Shot, Insanity and X Scream. Price of tickets include admission to the top of the tower.  If you don't believe me that this place is overpriced compare the lunch menu to the dinner menu. The same entrees on the lunch menu are double in price on the dinner menu.   Don't fall for this tourist trap!",

Though the food we ordered (turf and quack, a salad with blue cheese and bacon) was acceptable, menu options are very limited. And don't worry about dressing up like I did because there were diners who were wearing jeans and a t shirt. And even though we were on the 108th floor, Vegas does not have much to view.",

    "text": "The ONLY thing good about this place is the view. I researched this restaurant before making reservations. (I'm flying in from Hawaii mind you). There was a dress code, business casual. That means men wear a jacket, women wear a dress,  skirt or pants suit.     Upon arrival at the elevator to take you up to the restaurant, you are sent through a metal detector and if they are not satisfied with that you are asked to remove articles of clothing and or accessories. This was a huge embarrassment to the woman I was with. I should have left the establishment at that point. But she wanted to be a good sport about it and we continued to the elevator.     We got into the elevator with other hotel guests who were dressed in cargo shorts and t-shirts. I assumed they were going to ride the rides at the top of the tower. Our elevator operator Leroy, was dressed in a tuxedo and he is the only reason I didn't rate this restaurant  a 1 star. Leroy was very personable and it was quite an entertaining elevator ride.       We disembark at the restaurant level and are seated. We looked around and noticed most of the other dining guests are dressed in blue jeans, cut off jeans, shorts, t-shirts, baseball caps, mismatched clothes and the like. It looked like we were at a picnic for a Little League game.       I'm wearing a black suit and tie and my date is wearing a very smart  women's business suit. We looked so out of place. Our waiter looked better then most of the dining guests. We questioned the Hostess about the dress code and she said yes, there is a dress code but the restaurant figured since there was a Construction Equipment Convention in town, they wouldn't be so strict on the dress code.       We almost left then. I mean after all, we researched this restaurant and made plans around their advertisement. And now I have to sit across a guy in overalls, in a Green Bay Packer cap, who just kicked a bread stick under his table after he dropped it on the floor?       We looked at a menu. A rib-eye steak was $45. ONLY the steak! No potato, no vegetable, nothing, just the plain steak. We tried to make the best of it. My date ordered a plain salad... at $13. I got the steak. Thoroughly disappointed we left after we ate and went down the block to the IHOP were we had a great dessert. The Stratosphere Hotel is nice, it's this Top Of The World  restaurant that's iffy.",

The filet was melt in your mouth as you can expect, cook exactly as I had ordered. The view at sunset is spectacular, I would recommend making a reservation at this time. The dress code says business attire, but you will be fine as long as your neatly dressed. You do have to go through security but its no big deal, just empty your pockets and move along. I would recommend this place to any one visiting Vegas.",

It was under seasoned, and the pasta did not seem fresh, it seemed like the standard de hydrated pasta you get at the store. This was akin to something priced at $14 from the olive garden. My wife's salad was also a 3. The vinegrette was nothing special. The cauliflower soup was great and worthy of 4 stars, as was the prime rib. The desert was 5 stars! Amazing mentioned in your mouth delicious!",

Ambiance 5 stars- Whilst you sit enjoying the food, the restaurant imperceptibly revolve, thus you are afforded a spectacular 360 view of Las Vegas.

    "text": "Sorry but no way this place is worth a ride to the Vegas ghetto. The view is decent yes and food is OKAY but not great.  Standard steakhouse pricing, menu and sides ect.  Service from start to finish terrible or at least we happened to have one of the worst waiters I've encountered. Yes,that's harsh and no, I'm not a crazy complaining person that over exaggerates.  I could care less if service is slow and orders get messed. This guy happened to be incredulously arrogant and obnoxious it was laughable.   The stratosphere hotel where the restaurant is located is in a really rough side of Vegas about 10 min or so from the main strip and the walk through the hotel and its \"mall\" to get to the restaurant would probably be hard for even a good restaurant to overcome.  If you are dead set on eating here I recommend coming during daylight. I wish I had taken pictures of the walk inside the hotel to get to this place, man o'man. I hope none of my friends see this as I was jolly that evening since I was in good company and I don't like complaining especially when someone else is treating me to a $100 meal but boy was I glad to get back to the good side of town and our hotel.  There are so many other really really good steakhouses in Vegas, would recommend skipping this place for certain.  I'm surprised that someplace with a coveted view and such high pricing can still have such a sleezy feel. There were several drinks and meal items on our table that missed the mark but won't get nitpicky as restaurant doesn't allege to be a 5 star or Michelin rated one.",

I have a slight fear or heights and we were seated right at the edge, but after a little while you get used to it. Even the occasional roller coaster in the corner of the eye and sky jumpers dropping  added to the ambience. Very nice place, but for the price, I would save it for special occasions only.",

A lot of the reviews I've seen from unhappy guests are in regard to the pricing. Don't come here if you're on a budget and if you come with a negative attitude toward it it's never going to meet expectations. The restaurant revolves which is interesting and they have attractions such as the observation deck. The reason this restaurant didn't get 4 stars is how difficult it is to leave. We waited 20 minutes to get on an elevator with an insanely rude attendant that didn't want to take us for some reason. Honestly after a beautiful night the last thing we wanted was a difficult exit. Great food and drinks, excellent dirty martini and awesome views just don't beat anyone when you get to the elevators (and trust me it's hard not to).",

When we ordered desert we asked to bring cream brulee. Our waiter Max wanted to sell us so bad Teramissu. Which we didnt want. He pushed us to order it. And when they brought it, we still didn't want to eat Terramisu, and he resisted to exchange it , even it was not touched. But the most disgusting moment was, that the waiter Max told me \"to give it to my friend if I don't want to eat. But he wont change it...\" Is this considered high class steak house??!!! Beside that the floor is moving and you have view on the city, it doesn't worth it even to eat there food, as you still WONT GET what ever you ordered... NEVER AGAIN!!!",

The restaurant is located at the top of the Stratosphere Hotel where it spins slowly, giving you a 360 view of the surrounding hotels and the Las Vegas Strip.  We got to see a few thrill seekers jump off the Stratosphere while we were dining.  I had the four course dinner and it was to die for. The Lobster Bisque soup was delicious and is a must have.  I had the Filet Mignon and it just melted in my mouth. It was so delicious! I celebrated my birthday there and was gifted a mini Melted Lava cake with a candle, that was nice of them.  The pricing is very expensive but well worth it. I Loved my entire experience!",

The surf & turf was OK.  I do recommend upgrading to the lobster.  It was a full lobster tail.  The shrimp were overcooked and rubbery.

Set atop the stratosphere, a mid grade somewhat and outdated downtown hotel and casino, the property is kinda lost in a stretch of the las vegas strips no mans land. The back of the property is easily one of the citied worst and most dangerous neighborhoods.... As seen on COPS on fox. That being said, at the top of the towering hotel ( it easily is by far the tallest building in the vegas skyline ) lies a revolving restaurant topped off with an unrelated group of thrill rides and observation deck. The food at the restaurant is fair and executed competently, but in a town with such a plethora of great dining experiences, this place falls far short of being worthy a visit for fine dining. The experience of this place lies not in the food but in the location, as a high speed elevator will speed you to the top to seat you in its revolving dining room. Huge slanted windows gives a great view of the city as a whole and is a neat gimmick but does not compensate for the seemingly old and outdated furnishings accompanied by average food making this a tourist trap at its best.",

The glass panels aren't exactly romantic, but the view definitely is.   I expected the food to be decent and to be paying for the view, but that wasn't exactly the case. I had the Steak and Crab Cake combination as my entree and it was fantastic. I go medium and the steak was just red enough to be flavorful, without the sinewy raw taste you get when its undercooked in the middle. The sauce was great and the portabello mushroom underneath was a great pairing. My GF had the Chicken which she thought was very good (not amazing, but good). We shared the ahi tuna salad which was very nice as well.   Our waiter (I forgot his name, but he had short dark hair). was awesome. The entire meal he was helpful and always there to check up on us. The sommelier was very helpful in helping us pick our half bottle of whine and understood we were on a budget of sorts.   Overall, the food was great if not fantastic, however, at nearly 200 bucks after tip, I can't give it 5 stars for great food, it would have to be some of the best I have had.   Again, great place to take a Date",

The food was out of this world.  The BEST food my husband and I have ever eaten, hands down!  They start by bringing you a warm bread basket with fresh bread, rolls and crispy pita style bread.  It is paired with four or five different flavored butter spreads....melt in your mouth delicious.  We ordered salad before the main course (everything is a la cart making it very pricey- our tab for 2 dinners, 2 salads 2 beers, 1 soda and 1 dessert to share was $200, but well worth it).  I had the market greens salad, which came out looking like a work of art with cucumbers formed into a bowl holding fresh field greens and a really delicate tasting balsamic vinaigrette.  My husband had a lettuce wedge with this amazing bacon crumbled on it...tasted nothing like you can buy at the store.  For the main course I had seafood pasta...I expected lots of noodles, heavy sauce and little sea food.  I was mistaken.  Every bite was loaded with the freshest best lobster, scallops and prawns I have ever tasted.  The sauce was phenomenal as well.  The portion was so huge I could only finish about half of it.  My husband had filet and muskovey duck.  It came with a yam puree and he also ordered bok choy on the side.  His was sooo yummy as well.  The filet was so tender and cooked to perfection.  For dessert we had a lemon bar cheese cake. It was beautifully, artfully prepared and was far better than any cheesecake Ive ever had..anywhere!  Top of the World is a MUST when you are in Vegas.  I cant wait to go back, just so I can go here again!",

    "text": "This was a very nice dining experience.  I would have rated The Top of the World a '5', but we had to ask for things repeatedly a couple of times and at this level of dining, a '5' means 'perfect'.  We arrived about ten minutes prior to our reservation and were told that reservations were running about 15 minutes behind.  We took the opportunity to go up to the level 107 observation deck and watch some of the less faint-of-heart partake in the thrill rides there.  The time passed quickly and we were called for our table.  The maitre d' introduced himself to everyone in the party and gave a tour, providing the history of the restaurant, on the way to our table.  There are no bad seats in this restaurant.  Every table has an incredible view and the restaurant makes a 360 degree rotation in two hours.  The staff was very helpful, particularly the sommelier who gave us an interesting history on our favorite vineyard and associated wine labels.  The four course tasting menu was a hit for our party of four.  We enjoyed the accompanying wine flight in addition to our bottle of Joseph Phelps cabernet sauvignon.  The lobster bisque, crab cakes, sea bass and the fillets were incredible. The experience lasted over two hours allowing us a little more than one full rotation of the restaurant.  I highly recommend Top of the World.",

As you might have guessed, it is very expensive but well worth it. The food and service was excellent as well as the view.  I had the Chilean Sea Bass which was breaded in something really good -- the fish was the moistest! (Shout out to my new friend Christian, heehee). Also ordered green beans on the side, excellent as it was all buttered up. Had a glass of Pinot Gris to accentuate the flavors. But the best thing I think I have ever tasted ever was the dessert - White Chocolate Macademia Nut Creme Brule... absolutely flawless. Enough said.",

    "text": "This restaurant has the most spectacular view but that is where spectacular stops.  We live in town and had family visiting from Canada last weekend and we went there for what we hoped would be a great dining experience.  The \"arrival\" experience was very strange - after checking in with a very unfriendly lady at a podium in the main casino, we went thru a metal detector and then squashed in an elevator with a ton of other people.  We then had to check in again and were told to wait as we were early - no offer of \"would you like to go to our lounge\" or anything.  The people were completely indifferent and at this stage had we not had guests I would have already left.  When we asked we were told yes we have a lounge it's upstairs and was given a pager to carry that would alert us when we had to return in a 4/5 star restaurant???  We walked upstairs and had to find a table - no one to greet you - the table was filthy and had a ton of trash underneath.  Two waitresses showed up and wiped the table with a very wet rag and left it wet!!!  We ordered drinks after which we were told it was happy hour but not for beer or wine - what???  Of course the pager went off before we got our drinks and had to settle the check there before we could go downstairs - why couldn't it be transferred???  We also had to carry our drinks downstairs ourselves - not very impressive.  We sat down and yes the view s superb BUT waiter was barely even interested that we sat down - menu was OK but extremely over priced for what we got.  I wanted the lamb but wanted it plain and not with the Moroccan spices and was told NO we can't do that - WHAT???  I am just not getting the NO can do attitude here.  All of our entrees came with NO vegetables at all, the lamb had a spoonful of rice and the salmon and spoonful of salad.  For a $300 check with no appetizers or dessert, two glasses of wine and a beer they will not get this local resident back.  Very disappointing and why as a local we just don't bother with these type of restaurants, they just assume you are a tourist, won't be back and treat you accordingly.  Very sad.",

At first I was a bit skeptical since the Northern end of the strip is outdated compared to the rest, but I was surprised when I saw the restaurant on the top of the stratosphere.  I'm from San Francisco, so I loved the idea of the rotating dining area, the one at the SF Hyatt closed down a couple years back, so I was nostalgic.  :)  The view was amazing, the food was great, but I deduct a star for the service.  The service was not bad, BUT the service was not 5-stars.  I don't know if it is the location of the restaurant, but the staff definitely did not look like the normal \"VEGAS\" staff personnels you see near the center of the strip.  However, the food was amazing and I loved my time here with my boyfriend.",

    "text": "Top of the World Restaurant has the BEST view in Vegas. Period. But now, the best view is complimented with gourmet dining experience thanks to executive Chef Pawan Pinisetti's fresh new menu.  We tried for lunch and dinner and both were amazing. For less than $50, their 3 course lunch menu is a great deal. This is a revolving restaurant and a full circle takes about 1 hr 20 mins. The restaurant is very accommodating to dietary choices. Being vegetarian, I had quite a few choices. The warm spinach salad was made without bacon vinaigrette and was substituted with balsamic which was excellent.  For main I had their spaghetti squash with seasonal vegetables which was delicious. The chef also made this amazing pasta (which he calls a vegetarian's take on steak) served with mushrooms and horseradish cream, it was fantastic! Hubby tried Maryland crab stuffed chicken served over red pepper romesco, beautifully presented, chicken was extremely tender. They do also serve kids size steak (not on the menu) which my boys devoured.  I am not a fan of mashed potatoes, but these are a MUST try, so simplistic and yet so flavorful.  Now the best part... DESSERT!!! Being a chocolate fan, I tried the 21 layer chocolate cake which was decadent.  I highly recommend their baked Alaska. It's a trio of strawberry, brownie and cookies&cream ice cream, streusel crumble, that is covered in meringue that's flambe at the table.. it's sooo good!!  If you dine at Top of the World, you also get complimentary access to the indoor and outdoor viewing lounge :)",

Obviously, when you are about to pay $300 dollars for two you would expect the best service out there especially for it being in Vegas. but it wasn't all there.   Prior to going to the Top of the World restaurant, we checked the Yelp photos of the menu and somewhat decided on what we wanted to have that evening. We wanted a cheese platter to start, unfortunately, they did not have that on their new menu. The server told us they were in a period of transition since they had switched chefs. He hyped up the new chef and said he has been on the food network multiple times. We definitely were excited to hear about this. When we told our server that we had seen a cheese platter being offered at this restaurant online, he tried to accommodate us as well as possible. He went to the cafe and was able to get us the cheese platter. Honestly, that was the best part of this whole dining experience!  We had a selection of three cheeses, fruits on the side, some good bread, and a real piece of honeycomb that we devoured! next we ordered a french onion soup, It was alright. It seemed cheaply made and not with the best ingredients. It was overly salted as well.",

Service is quick and pleasant, views are great. Ordered the lobster bisque and the chopped salad for starters, with lobster Mac and cheese and a burger for the main course. We also split a bottle of wine.  Lobster bisque was probably the worst cup I've ever had in my life and I honestly shouldn't have ate the thing and sent it back but I didn't want to get our meal off to a bad start. The chopped salad was some how too salty according to my friend. Truffle burger is literally just a regular burger. 3 people at the table all ordered the same burger, same medium-well. Each burger was cooked differently. The lobster Mac and cheese was made with some sort of shell pasta that clumped together and didn't absorb the sauce well. The sauce was also mediocre.   Service and table staff were great. My two star review solely reflects the quality of the food.   I don't usually go in that hard on places like this, but this is Vegas and whoever is running this place needs to update this establishment ASAP.",

Apparently there is a total rebrand going on that includes massive upgrades to everything - rooms, the restaurant, etc. Oh, okay... the view, let's try it.   Valet was easy. The Strat is striving to be better than the same old run down Stratosphere I remembered. Not saying I'm starting here, but the marketing did get us to try Top of the World for dinner. Easy ride up. Rotating view that takes about 40-45 minutes to see it all while you enjoy the meals. Simple classic menu with great steaks. Attentive but not intrusive service. Dinner was great! Also includes ability to check out the observation decks, that you otherwise pay for. I would come back for sure. Next time we may try the lounge upstairs but dinner is not out of the question.  Well done, Strat. Your marketing got me here when I otherwise never would have come. We enjoyed it and had a nice dinner. Not a bad night out in Vegas at all pre-gambling.",

    "text": "My love and I went to Top of the World for Valentine's Day. I'm a Vegas local, but have never been to the top of the Stratosphere before. I loved the view and the fact that the restaurant rotates.   As for the food, I have mixed feelings. The bread could've been better for such an exoensive restaurant. We had been gifted groupons for the 4-course meal, so chose from the selective menu.   I had the following: lobster bisque (delicious), crab cake ('meh'...not a fan), the filet mignon and shrimp (the shrimp was average, the steak was absolutely fantastic--flavorful, insanely tender, and perfectly cooked at medium well), and, for dessert, the caramel creme brulee (pretty good, but I've had better). My boyfriend ordered the same, except he had the pasta in replacement of the crab cake (which I thought was better).   The staff was very friendly, and accommodated my boyfriend (who is in a wheelchair). Overall, the experience is lovely for tourists. The full rotation of the restaurant takes about an hour and a half. We were able to see SkyJumpers bungee off the side of the tower. After/before eating, you also get free access to the bar and outdoor/indoor viewing area for pictures or lounging.   For locals, I'd recommend a different restaurant for a pricey, fine-dining meal--such as a steak house or the like--where they pride themselves on the food alone. However, for tourists, this experience and view can't be beat.",

It's a bit pricey but totally worth it.  There is a Groupon discount you can get if you dine on Sundays-Thursday.",

The food was great, although it's not the best in LV. My main complaint is that I feel that the filet mignon could have been a bit better. I would've liked something closer to a Ruth's Chris version, but that's just my preference and I'm not going to dock them for that. It was still a great steak, and the king salmon was perfect. Great cocktails and service as well. I was worried that this place will be all about the view and not food, but I was pleasantly surprised to find out that they pretty much nail both.   Easy to access, free parking and valet service. Overall a wonderful spot for a special night. I would recommend this as your first stop in Vegas. It really leaves you with a great experience to ride out the rest of the trip on.",

I kind of suspected this is how it would be, but I made a reservation because I didn't actually know you could just come up the bar above instead (and you will need a reservation in order to be allowed up and into to the restaurant). Next time that's what I'll do and that's what I recommend. But it is nice to have a table close to the window. A unique experience.   I also somehow had no idea that the restaurant rotated! So now you're warned. THE RESTAURANT ROTATES.   You get a full 360-degree view of Vegas from up here in an hour and 20 minutes, I think. If you get queasy easily maybe it'll cause you some issues. It took us a while to get used to, that's for sure.",

The restaurant is on the 106th floor and has a revolving floor. The hostesses and waiters and staff are all very friendly.   All of the food we ordered ( in clueing the brown bread they bring to the table) was amazing! In all we ordered: crab cakes, brussel sprouts, asparagus, green beans, potatoes, mushrooms, and bananas foster. The highlights were : mushrooms (impeccably flavored), crab cake, and bananas foster.   Additionally, this restaurant has a great view of the city. I would definitely recommend this restaurant when visiting Vegas.",

From the indifferent staff at the 2nd check in to the 1 hour wait to get drinks(coke and water) to having to wait another 30 minutes just to speak with a manager. At that point I had enough. It's unfortunate that a restaurant I loved so much turned out this way this time.  Message to the top of the world: incentivize your staff because they all seem like they don't wanna be there. I get it was memorial weekend and it was a late dinner but I'd rather be told I can't be served than to take me in and make me wait hours for service.   Just terrible. The manager was completely empathetic and professional so the 2 stars are for him but everything else was less than ordinary tonight.",

The lobster Mac and cheese on the other hand was amazing and definitely a great side dish to compliment the salmon. I enjoyed the old school 90s R&B music they had playing in the background as well. Definitely worth going to if you are in the Strat Hotel in Vegas.",

However on this special day, my wife ordered a Cosmopolitan which she did not like. The only person in the immediate area was a bus boy named \"GENE\". My wife said excuse me, and GENE turned around and said, \"Yeah? What do you want? While these words may sound innocent enough, his tone conveyed a level of disrespect that totally caught me off guard.  We played it off and she explained that she was not happy with her drink. (She is a bartender). We were not seeking free food or services, only a drink replacement. At that time, our server returned and GENE told her \"She doesn't like her drink\" in an equally annoyed tone. The waitress pleasantly took the drink and replaced it also removing it from our bill.  I don't like creating issues but GENE'S attitude towards my wife on this special day bothered me greatly. (Imagine if you took your wife out and this happened, what would you say or how would you feel?) I listened to the way Gene addresses other customers and he spoke to them in a manner that I expected my wife to be spoken to. I began to feel that the fact that my family is mixed race may have impacted his attitude toward us. I told our waitress about the situation and asked to speak to the manager. She told me that she did not know the bus-boys name and he was not on her team. I told her that I really didn't care whose team he was on. She got The manager and I explained the situation to him and he told me he would \"talk to GENE\". That was it, no apology for the situation, nothing else. This gave me the impression that the manager didn't care either. He did talk to Gene for about two minutes after which GENE returned to his duties as usual occasionally starring at me occasionally. The only reason I left a 15% tip which is half what I usually do is because the server was not the the offending person. Way to kill a special occasion.",

    "text": "This review is for the experience of the restaurant. Out of most of the places I been to in Vegas this is thus far the best bang for the buck!  Everyone told me to check out the stratosphere for the views and the food was just ok. I beg to differ! The food was great, and so was the service! When you get to the stratosphere you get on an elevator which seems to take forever, which is understandable when you look up from the ground level from the outside LoL! When you reach the restaurant level, you are greeted by security, and then the front desk directs you to either the observation deck, or the restaurant. The restaurant overlooks all of Vegas! The restaurant actually rotates at a speed of 3 mph. Not that fast but you can soak in all the views from different angles!   As we enter the dining room we take our seat by the window. We were given a delectable bread basket with 3 different butters! Yumm-O! The great news is they have a three course pre-fix! You get soup, surf n turf, and dessert for $50 per person. To start off we had the lobster bisque. It was great, it had that nice sherry taste, and also some chunks of lobster. It was really good! For the surf n turf it was a filet & lobster tail. Both were cooked perfectly. Both were tender and delicious. The nice part, the lobster was served with REAL butter! Then, the best for last, dessert! For desert you get a mini creme brulee, and a mini flourless chocolate cake. Again, Yumm-O! So just when you thought your experience here couldn't be any more epic, when you dine in the restaurant you get to visit the observation deck for free!!! If you are in Vegas and walking the strip I highly suggest visiting here, it is so worth it! This place will not have your head spinning, that's what the restaurant is for!",

No complaints. Excellent place to have lunch or dinner for a special occasion. A la Carte menu.  ADVICE:  show up at least 30 minutes before your dinner time.  Reservations will be held for an additional 20 minutes only. The restaurant is on the 106th floor, so you have to wait in line then board the elevator.  Get to the restaurant on TIME don't be late for your meal appointment.    CONS:  Bring your ID card. My spouse and I were carded by the bartender at the bar on the 107th floor where we waited until we got our table.  We walked away instead.   Other than that, we enjoyed our stay. Well worth it!",

    "text": "First of all I want to start of by saying that the food was good but everything else was not so great. We dined here with a party of 12 on Saturday, August 3, 2019. Our reservation was for 6:30pm. Per their instructions, we arrived 15 minutes early to find that they only had one elevator working. we waited approximately 30 minutes to finally get an elevator to the restaurant. Needless to say we couldn't all fit on the elevator so we were about 25 minutes behind on our reservation.   Upon arriving we were greeted by a less that enthusiastic host who was simply reciting a script and gong through the motions . once seated were greeted by our server and she became immediately annoyed that we were still getting settled. this attitude did not get any better throughout the night.  I will say however that the assistant server (Courtney) was such a delight and was far more attentive than our actual server. Kudos to the kitchen as the food was really good, however a bit overpriced but I guess you are paying for the view. I ordered a 2009 Bordeaux from their wine list and was greeted by one of their sommeiliers and told that they didn't have to 2009 and was offered the 2011. this was just fine. We ordered a bottle of 2014 Cabernet next and when another Sommelier came to us he informed us that they didn't have that either and offered the 2015. Please understand this doesn't fall on the sommeliers nut on the GM and Wine Director. you would think in a fine dining restaurant, that they would keep their lists up to date. The photographer also stopped by during dinner to take photos and her attitude was not much better than our servers. She did however do a great job with the photos which we did purchase. at the end of the evening we were presented with a check that included gratuity (we were aware of this ahead of time). I think this is the only time I have ever dined where I didn't feel the server earned that automatic gratuity. I think for what you are going to pay, there are better places to spend your money in Las Vegas. If you want the view go up to the bar or pay for the elevator ride to the observation deck and then go have a nice dinner. kudos to the chefs, Sommeliers and our assistant server for doing their best with what tools they were given.",

I got the filet for dinner an it literally melted in my mouth. We had a great server and the sommelier was so fun to talk to. We got the Chateau St Michelle cab and it was the best wine I have had in a long time.   I loved that the whole restaurant spun and we got a 360 view of Vegas. It was just like my favorite restaurant in Los Angeles. It was so fun watching everyone jump off the top. I got the chills just watching them jump!!  We are from San Diego and we both keep saying we cant wait to go back to vegas solely for that dinner we had.",

I'd recommend checking when the sun is setting and reserving a time that fits what kind of a view you'd like during your meal. I feel I got to see the best of both worlds :) I got a seat next to the window and as you eat you get to see not only the strip but also people bungee-jumping off the building! Food is not cheap but its a rotating restaurant in Vegas. We ordered the seafood pasta and the duck. The seafood pasta actually had so much seafood that I couldn't finish all the shrimp!! That never happens.. With little chunks of crab meat hiding inside made every bite enjoyable. The duck was pretty good too! No room for dessert this time.   I would recommend this place for the experience or a special night out!",

On our last day, I was talked into going, I truly didn't want to spend the money at that point or drive to end of strip however we went and I'm truly pleased we did. The drive was nice, parking was easy, made reservation and was seated immediately, server was on point, friendly and pleasant, the view is like no other (be on alert for the sky jumpers on roof top while dining), we ordered the lunch prix fixe menu and it did not disappoint, other menu specials available too. By dining at Top of the World, we were permitted to the observation deck both indoor and outdoor, we saw all of Vegas and observed the folks on the extreme rides. I highly recommend this experience",

It's True, place is expensive, and if not for the view- definitely overrated, but you're on the 67890th floor and you get a 360 view of Las Vegas. We scored seeing the city in the daytime, twilight time, sunset, and night time. The floor rotates and the whole rotation takes about 2 hours, which is how long dinner lasted- totes worth it! The service from check in to send off was great- professional, not pretentious, and actually funny.   The menu  is a la cart, but me and my boo did the tasting menu (4 courses). FYI- you can substitute the meat course with lamb chops- yum! The lobster bisque was OK, kinda salty, but Boo Thang loved it. As with any fancy restaurant the portions are small, but you do get full with the tasting menu. I don't know the final price, but Boo Thang said the damage wasn't that bad... for the unlimited time on the rooftop, 360 degree Las Vegas view, food, and drinks you would have spent the same monetary amount at a fancy steakhouse.   I rated this place a 4 because it's a restaurant with no party in my mouth, but the value and experience is definitely worth it!   The Good: 360 degree view of Vegas  Unlimited time on the rooftop   The Bad:  After a romantic dinner, we went up to look at the skyline, two words: Tourist Central.   PS: This place is everybody friendly. The attire is business casual, but it's not strict. We had dinner and we saw a family celebrating a birthday, couple anniversary, and even a wedding reception.",

We wasted over $600.00 on dinner, which was OK, but nothing special. After dinner we found out that the guys from valley lost my husband's car keys. We had guests who were late for their flight, so the restaurant provided a cab for them. We had no choice but to stay in Vegas and we couldn't return to LA for our work on Monday and lost our income for the day. However, they charged us the full price for the dinner. When I spoke with the manager Brandon about this matter and requested to get at least a discount for all the inconvenience they caused, he refused saying that he compensated more than enough.

The view and atmosphere are absolutely amazing and totally worth it :) Rotating restaurant, 106th floor up, top of the stratosphere hotel, definitely offers the best view and experience of vegas I've ever seen. It takes about 1h20m to fully rotate for a complete view; I did feel a little dizzy, I guess it's cause I was sitting anti-clockwise.   Food was alright. New york steak was a bit chewy. Salmon was fine. Lamb rack was exceptionally good.  Their bread, served with 3 different spreads, garlic/orange/ginger, was amazing! We did the wine pairing for an extra 40. It was sooooo good, perfectly goes with our lamb rack and steak :) We also had the grain with four cheese as side dish which was a very nice size and presentation.   Here comes the best part of the meal! Their desserts....omahgawdddd everything was beautifully presented and completly flavorful.   HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!   1.Bananas Foster in a Florentine Box Artisanal vanilla ice cream, foster sauce with myers rum and fresh banana, all served in a caramel almond box  2. Chocolate Duo Duo of mini chocolate pot de creme and mixed fresh berries in a white chocolate cup with vanilla mousseline cream  3. Chocolate Lover's Dream Dark chocolate teardrop shell wrapped around a moist chocolate cake, Grand Marnier and semi sweet chocolate mousse  Our waiter, David, was excellent and knowledgeable about the menu. Service is nice but somehow slow even with all their running around.   Price was reasonable, we spent about $350. Overall, I'd recommend it as a once in a lifetime experience. :)",

    "text": "We have been eating at Top of the World for several years now.  I would give it 4.5 stars, but that's not an option.  So, 4 stars it is, because it's not a 5 star place.  As other yelpers note, the Stratosphere is off the beaten path if you are staying in the more crowded part of the strip.  And, it's not a very nice hotel/casino.  But, Top of the World is worth the cab ride.  The restaurant does spin, so if you get motion sickness I would not advise sitting on the outer circle.  I have never sat there because I didn't want to feel motion while I eat.  The lobster bisque is a dish we have ordered on more than one occasion.  It's a very solid representation of this fine dining staple.  Likewise, the crabcakes are large and have a good helping of crab meat, as opposed to some cakes that are mostly filler.  The horseradish crusted ribeye is a definite repeat order.  It's not as large as some of the dinosaur bones you get on the strip at 16 ounces, but it's more than enough and has an excellent kick due to the crust.  The wine list is not vastly extensive, but it's not short either.  Prices are expected given its location.  Service is very prompt, never had an issue in several visits.  After dinner, have a drink or 3 at the bar downstairs and get a great view of the valley.",

It's such a spectacular view and the rotating feature gives you a 360 degree view right from your table while you dine. The food was very good. There was not a single thing I had that wasn't good. With the bread, they serve 3 different butters - all wonderful. The lobster bisque was the best I've ever had. If I'm remembering correctly, the friend I went with had been there several times before and had always ordered the duck but it was not on the menu this time. He was really looking forward to having it and was naturally disappointed to find it wasn't on the menu but he did very much enjoy what he ordered instead.  If you haven't been here before while visiting Vegas, it's worth the experience but know it's going to be an expensive night.",

    "text": "The food is beyond exceptional! The steak & sea bass are what we ordered this time, both mouth watering/melt in your mouth awesome! My teenage son who typically just grunts his acceptance of food that is edible, actually rolled his eyes and said, \"oh my god\". I was scared at first and asked \"what?!\" Then he said with his mouth full \"this is outstanding... So good...\" I'm not sure if there are different staff on the days some of these bad reviews were written, but I'm shocked to read that some people actually feel the food is \"inedible\". The same thing with the service (which was also exceptional). They're probably the people who complain about everything and nothing is ever good enough for them - we all have one of those relatives. I will say that when compared to other higher quality restaurants, it is still priced about 25 to 30 percent higher than it needs to be, but then again so is everything else in Vegas. At least with food this good, you're not kicking yourself afterward. You pay $50 for a buffet of just regular food, you tend to be grumpy or even regretful. You pay $50 for a steak that is mind blowing, and suddenly it's not that bad. Especially when the staff are SOOOO friendly and totally go above and beyond. I never had to look for our server once! He was all over it, every step of the meal. He sensed my son was struggling with the menu and came over to explain what things were. My son was almost finished with his soda and our server was at the table with a refill before my son took his last sip. My son actually said \"woah!\" I've never seen a server anticipate every need of a diner before, quite impressive.  It was an excellent experience that I thoroughly enjoyed and will go again when back in town.",

    "text": "The atmosphere alone is worth this experience. Our server was phenomenal at every moment. We started with a fabulous appetizer - it had amazing tuna and salmon poke, 4 freshly shucked oysters, amazing large chilled shrimp, lobster cocktail and a large king crab leg called the Mosaic of Chilled Seafood. The lobster bisque was next along with a Caesar Salad. The bisque was unique and one of the best we had ever tried with a unique blend of spices that seemed to end with a touch of nutmeg- delicious! The salad was not noteworthy but cold and fresh with a nice Parmesan crisp. I can't forget the bread selection including a Lavosh that was great served with a Orange Ginger, Herb and Regular whipped butters.   We ordered the Lobster Thermidor and I was sadly disappointed upon arrival. It seemed to be a regular lobster tail served alongside what was called a souffle. The souffle had a half inch of bread crumbs on top and my first bite was bland so I passed to Clarence. It was when I looked closely at the lobster that it seemed the Thermidor was missing- who doesn't love those creamy bites of lobster, crab and sherry richness but alas it was missing. We motioned our server who agreed and he whisked it back to be told the chef had incorporated the Thermidor into this souffle. Thankfully he agreed to switch our entree to the Cobia which was nice.   Since we were celebrating our anniversary our server brought a delicious mini chocolate flourless cake with berries. It was just decadent!   Make reservations as the wait for a table was 2.5 hours at 7:30 pm in a Friday. Definitely go and don't hesitate to ask questions as the service was phenomenal. Take advantage of the observation deck along with your meal rather than purchasing a separate ticket too.",

Of all, the lobster bisque was probably the best dish. The dessert chocolate mousse was quite satisfying. The bf didn't like sweet too much but he really enjoyed it.

We had to have reservations and they treat it like an exclusive club with many \"waiting areas\" to get in the the dining area. There is plenty of signage guiding you to the restaurant elevator area, which you must check into before climbing aboard.  We went at sunset and were lucky enough to get a raised booth right in front of the kitchen, so our view of Vegas was phenomenal. A visit to the viewing deck was free with your meal as well.   The food was all very well done and the service great. There was a lot of diversity on the staff with workers from a cross the world, which we appreciated. Hubby loved his lobster bisque but was surprised that the lobster was served separately from the bisque. He loved his NY steak and lobster tail. I really enjoyed my salad and seafood fettuccine, although it was so rich and huge that I may order something else if we ever go back. The seafood was all very fresh and tasty. We had a wonderful experience here! At least at dinner, I wouldn't bring children and I would dress at least business casual.",

Lobster bisque was good, scallop was literally 1 scallop.  He got the filet which was large and very good.  It had mushrooms and some sort of sauce on it but it didn't come with any sides.  I got the fettuccini with scallops, shrimp and crab.  It was very good and a large portion.  It was only $55, less than the wine.  Atmosphere and experience: Ok so we made a 7:30 reservation for Sunday night and show up about 15 minutes early to ask for a window seat.  They said there were none available and we would have to wait 45 min to an hour.  We decided to go ahead and take a table instead of wait which I deeply regret.  A couple who were only there for a drink were sat at a large window table 20 minutes after we sat down.  So there are 3 rows of tables in the circle.  The window tables which are 2-4 person tables obviously have the best view.  The second row is only 2 person tables.  The third row are large booths that are round and face the outer windows and there also a level above the first 2 rows.  So we were in the middle row which was the worst.  Service was good.  All in all the food was good but for $250 I want the view.",

    "text": "Decided to come here with the boyfriend since we were staying a night at the Stratosphere, and couldn't help but notice how fun this restaurant looked.  We were able to get a reservation for 8:45pm on a Sunday night, but beware, it's going to take you at least 15 minutes to get seated after you make the trek from the first reservation stand to your table via the elevator.  I felt like I was in a line at Disneyland's Tomorrowland, except I was hangry.  They only let ten people in the elevator at a time, and there was some large party going on at the top of the Stratosphere, thus... a long wait to get to the top.  Once you get the the 108th floor, you have to wait another several minutes in a line of guests waiting to be seated.  I will say, once you are seated, and you see the view, the mood gets better.  The restaurant slowly turns 360 degrees so that you get views of all of Vegas.  I started with the lobster bisque, which was quite a large portion.  Loved the fresh chunks of chilled lobster in the middle.  Boyfriend didn't get a starter.  We were too hooked on their bread with three different butters (regular, honey, and PESTO).  Then, more waiting ensued.  We weren't in a major rush, but we did have to make it back to our hotel room by 10:30pm to meet our group for the rest of the night's activities.  Something had to be going wrong in the kitchen, because we heard tables around us complaining about the wait for their food, even one guest completely cancelling everything and asking for the bill.  My boyfriend and I started getting antsy because we didn't want to have to rush through our entrees when paying that much for a meal.  Our server was literally no where to be found for a majority of the meal, not even when my boyfriend's wine glass was empty.  We would see him pop up now and then, but it was so clear that he was avoiding our table because he KNEW the wait for our next course was getting ridiculous.  It wasn't until my boyfriend got up to complain to one of the bussers and then flagging down the server, did he address the issue.  The entrees came out shortly after.  I ordered:  Pan Seared Foie Gras (cocoa nib fleur de sel, seasonal chutney, balsamic reduction, toasted bioche): Being a Californian, of course I order foie gras when I'm in Vegas!  This was delicious, though a smaller portion than I've received at other restaurants.  The chutney paired very well with the foie.  Organic Australian Wagyu Filet Carpaccio (parmesan reggiano, white truffle sea salt, potato gaufrettes): This dish was a bit of a let down.  The amount of wagyu served was minuscule, especially when compaired to the parmesan reggiano, and they went way overboard on the sea salt.  I could mainly taste cheese and salt.  My boyfriend ordered the Prime New York Steak with peppercorn sauce, cooked medium rare, and a side of Yukon Gold Mashed Potatoes.  No complaints there.  If steak and potatoes are involved, he's happy.  Getting back down to the lobby level was a bigger pain in the a$$.  Elevators kept stopping on the 108th floor, but then would say they are only going up.  It took us at least another 15 minutes to get back downstairs.  Take about a buzzkill to start the rest of the night off.  Overall, Top of the World gets an A++++ for the view and experience, but the service and mediocre food didn't really justify the cost.",

We got there and were seated immediately by the window. The views were incredible. It takes about 80 minutes to go around the entire restaurant so enjoy the time while you're there. We both ordered the rack of lamb, which was incredible. After you place your order, they bring you a bread basket with freshly baked rolls and 3 types of butter for all the different rolls. For dessert, we had the bananas foster and it was to die for. Our server had a little bit of a stutter, but that didn't interfere with the incredible service she provided. I had read about some horrible service reviews and how the food was just alright but I had the most wonderful experience here, and I will definitely be back when my wallet can afford it!",

    "text": "my lovely sisters arranged dinner here for my birthday while we were in Las Vegas last week. We arrived before dark and purposefully arrived early. This allowed us to enjoy the observation deck as the sun set and the lights came on all across the desert view. Incredible and a little eerie from up so high! 108 stories up above the strip. You can see forever! We went down to the restaurant, one floor below the deck. The restaurant turns continuously as you dine. You can barely tell it is moving so I promise it wont bother you at all! It takes a full 80 minutes to make one turn all the way around 360 degrees. The thrill rides are above you and you can occasionally see a sky jumper dive off the building!  Wow!   The service was impeccable and we were treated very well! We ordered the crab cake appetizer and split a Caesar salad three ways.  The crab was delish  as was the salad but we ordered our anchovies on the side. They were huge! lol.  We had the New England Prawns and  the Filet Mignon .   The butter was even a treat, arriving in three little bundles, regular, orange and Basil. It was a perfect compliment to the great bread basket.   We only managed to peek at the desserts as we had plenty to eat. I would come back here again! It was a fabulous evening!",

This restaurant is located inside of a casino, so whatever your reservation time is for you should leave at least 20 minutes before. It takes about 10 minutes just to get to the top of the restaurant once your inside. I when for Fourth of July weekend so the casino and lobby area were full more than usual. Once you get upstairs you will go through security and there is one elevator that takes you to the top so there is awaiting process depending on how busy they are. Me and my husband made reservations for 9:00 we weren't seated til about 10:15. We could've been seated at 9:15 but we asked for a window seat so it was a longer wait. I must say it was definitely worth the wait. The food was incredible and the staff was so sweet perfect place for date night.",

It was good but with prices that rival top steak houses you would expect top notch food.  I mean they charge $76 for a bone in ribeye.  It's good but nothing better than what you could get at Longhorn Steak house.  If the steak was $35-40 then yes it would be a great steak for the money but when you charge  $76 I expect a great 5 star meal.  The sides we got a ceasar salad and asparagus which again were good but nothing great.  I asked for a Window seat and was placed one level above.  I'm not one to complain to the staff so I didn't say anything.  Even where we were seated the view is outstanding.  Service was kinda on the slow side but only because 2 waiters were getting every table.  We waited forever to get drinks and food was on the slower side.  Now this is really nit picking and if I didn't spend $200 for 2 people I would have loved every second of it.  Everyone definitely needs to try this place just for the view alone but just realize you will be spending $150-200 for 2 people.",

You can bank on every point listed above to provide you with and experience to be remembered!  A very nice point that is observed by all of the staff is the fact I never felt rushed to vacate our table.  Even when our meal was obviously finished and we were dawdling over our drinks while watching the skyline and the jumpers go by.   As I learned later a full rotation of the seating area around the tower takes about 120 minutes.  They allow everyone who comes in to enjoy at least a full rotation before even thinking about addressing your stay.  Couple the leisurely meal and view with the excellent food served and it all adds up to time an money well spent whether you come for lunch or dinner.  We started out with the Flash Fried Calamari Served with tomato sauce and wasabi sour cream.  A tender and tasty starter served in a visually appealing way. (I'll add photos later).   Also served to start was a selection of rolls with various flavors butters.   The one I really liked was an Orange flavored butter with a bit of orange in the center of the shell shaped pat as a surprise.  Super yummy on the warm rolls!   My meal was the Petit Filet Mignon With roasted portobellini mushroom and Yukon gold mashed potatoes.  Also comes with a selection of sauces but I stuck with the Brandy peppercorn sauce.  The Filet arrived perfectly rare.  The meat quality was top notch as was everything else about the plating.   My lunch was gone all to fast!  Even the  portobellini mushroom which am usually none too fond of.  My daughter's was the Fettuccine Seafood Alfredo Hand made pasta, sauteed prawns and scallops, cream, garlic and Parmesan, peas, teardrop tomato and asparagus.  Nothing says satisfaction from your child like the verbal silence that you hear while your daughter devours her meal.   Of special note were the scallops and prawns.  The prawns were actually prawn sized as opposed to the cocktail shrimp other places try to pass off as prawns.  The scallops were large pieces of goodness that disappeared even before the prawns did.  The paste and the rest of the composition was spot on. Yes, I had to sneak in a bite or two when she wasn't looking.  Both meals gave their money's worth in quality and amount.  Everything was served perfectly with attention during the meal at well timed intervals.   A special note of thanks to our server who addressed both my 10 year old and me with equal grace and attention.  You really made her feel well treated too!  The final topper was the Coca-Cola to go.  I am Coke snob but the Top of the World Restaurant  must be keeping on top of the coke machine like everything else they do.   It was an excellent coke with no fuss about a cup to go.  Another service offered by the Top of the World Restaurant  and Cashman are meal photos.  The person who took our did an excellent job.  Since in was lunch and perfectly clear outside, the backdrop of the surrounding city and hills was and pleasing counterpoint to the restaurant.  When a photo comes together, especially a photo with your girl, you act it without hesitation!  The whole set I opted for was $100 in addition to the meal and worth every cent for the way pictures came out.   I recommend the Top of the World Restaurant as a Las Vegas destination for any local or visitor to experience at least once.",

This caused us to be a little bit late but the staff is so friendly they don't worry about it (and it probably happens all the time because people don't expect it). Service is good. The whole restaurant seems to move at it's own pace. It's a little slow - the time between people checking on your table, the wait for drinks, time between order and food arrival - but it's not terrible, it is what it is and it seems to fit the slow rotation of the restaurant. The food was great. Not incredible hence not 5 stars. My duck was meh... was better with the sauce intended for the beef. But the steak was amazing... melt in your mouth greatness.  The free-range chicken was delicious as well, a tad too much cheese inside but the taste more than made up for it. Totally recommend going.",

Especially when you consider that going up for the view alone is about $18, a lunch where you pay $20 is a bargain.  I read the Yelp reviews and so lobster bisque was my pick for food.  It was very good, but not the best i've ever eaten.  Definitely worth the price, especially with the rolls it was a very filling lunch; but the bisque was bordering on too salty (and I love salty food).  My friends got burgers and loved them, and I snitched some french fries and they were excellent.  Some of our party also got dessert and raved about the bananas foster.  I tried a bite and it was pretty excellent from what I could taste.  Would I come here for dinner knowing how expensive it is and the quality of food?  Probably not.  Unless the view is really the priority (which, it is an amazing view) I don't know that the food is worth the price I saw on the dinner menus.",

Not only that the restaurant does a complete 360 rotation about every hour I believe so you get a good view of all of Vegas.   I had a steak and it was fantastic. The servers here are excellent as well. They also warn you before not to get alarmed if you see people jumping from the building because the free fall ride they have jumps off from just above the restaurant, and sure enough a few minutes later we saw someone go off.   As a bonus too you get free admission to the observation deck.",

While the view is spectacular, the food was 'meh' and the service well, to be told upon seating that the manager was pushing tables because the restaurant had over-booked just set the tone for the evening.  The carpaccio was drenched in some type of cream sauce, the foie gras was dry, the pork belly on a bed of rice was actually the highlight of the whole meal.  My husband  did enjoy his sea bass, my daughter's filet was overcooked (how to you go from rare to well done I have no idea) son-in-law had the horseradish encrusted ribeye bu encrusted they mean a blob of horseradish on top, and I had the filet.  Food was  just on the side of being cold, not ever room temperature.    I prefer the view from Binions.",

There was 6 in our group.  Items ordered were: 2 Mexican prawns, scallops and lobster grilled on a panache with a couscous type tanouleh. Exquisite Seafood fettuccini  rib eye steak x 2 Rack of lamb. Very tender and just right  We shared sides of creamy polenta with creme fraiche And omg to die for gnocchi which had brown butter on top. Yummy. My mouth is drooling as I type. We also got a side of sauteed mushrooms with parsley and garlic.  This too was delish. The portions were surprisingly huge. We all had leftovers and had no room for desert.  We watched people dive from the insanity ride from the floor above us and enjoyed the breathtaking views of Las Vegas at night. Our waitress Karen was very sweet funny and kept on checking in on us every few minutes.  Highly recommended.  Will definitely go back when I visit Vegas in the near future.",

    "text": "This is my second time visiting the Top of the World restaurant and the first for other members of the party. This time I was disappointed and did not complain on site because I waited tables for 6 years and I always find it uncomfortable. However, a few things really did bother me.  They need to work on managing the guest's experience and work on training their employees to be more perceptive to their needs.   1.) Our drinks took about ten minutes to come out. It should take an average of five minutes.  2.) The bread did not come out until we requested it when the appetizer hit the table. 3.) The appetizer, the pork belly is a great dish, but was losing temperature and wasn't warm. I asked an employee if it should be cold and it was not offered to be replaced. 4.) My sister ordered her filet temperature as medium and it was medium well. In addition, another was medium rare and it was medium. I worked in a steak house and when this happen to my guests, I noticed and offered to have it recooked to order. It should have been noticed for the medium well, at least. That is terrible. 5.) It took an extremely long time to get our check. I am not sure of the policy for when they train their servers to drop it off.  6.) I wanted a cabernet, the server didn't even know which were offered by the glass.... which turns out it only three, no further comment necessary.  7.) Going down the elevator was a hassle because they continued to send employees down. It happen three times in a row. The poor elevator girl ask how dinner was, the other guests in the elevator really voiced their discontent. We weren't the only ones that evening.   The view gets an A+ and a B for food.  I just feel like you pay for the view. Unfortunately this time the service wasn't up to standards.  Try to look at other business models of fine dining for service tips, it may help.",

    "text": "Can you get a better meal on the strip?  Sure. Is the food alone worth the trip to the Top of the World?  Absolutely.   Are you coming to Top of the World for the food alone?  Heck no!  Do the views make this one of the best overall dining experiences in Vegas?  You betcha they do!  Look, this place rocks and I'll be back again.  The restaurant, like the Stratosphere itself is showing some age, but its very good.  If you're staying in one of the megaresorts on the Strip, you're going to need to save a few bucks from the tables and spring for the cab ride to and from the Stratosphere to try the Top of the World.  This is not a short walk from the Wynn, Venetian, Mirage, etc.    While having to go through security and a metal detector, just to go to dinner may seem a bit disconcerting, here, its worth it.  We made our reservation several months in advance based on a recommendation from friends who had recently dined there.  We booked the reservation for about 20 minutes before sunset, in hopes we would be seated right around the time the strip lights up.  We were seated promptly and got to see Vegas transform from day to night.  While the strip lighting up was fun, the sun setting behind the mountains was beautiful.  The food is very good.  Yes, you can find some places on the strip where it is better for comparable prices, but remember the view!  You pay extra for a hotel with a view and you do the same here (albeit not that much extra given the high quality of the fare).  Service was top notch.  Our server was attentive, prompt and not rushed, even though we were occupying a prized window seat.    I had the wedge salad which had big chunks of bacon. The filet and pork tenderloin were both well portioned and cooked perfectly.  Both, along with the salad were enough to fill anyone up.  The desserts all looked very good, but we simply did not leave room.  As noted by other reviews, the restaurant moves.  I can get motion sick, but the motion here, is barely noticeable.  There were no issues.  One of the more exciting things is when you realize there are people riding the rides and bungee jumping from the top of the tower, above you.  It is kind of neat to see people plummeting past the windows as you eat.  After dinner you have access to the observation deck which is a blast.  You get to see people riding the insane rides and bungeeing from the building.  In addition, you get great unobstructed views of the strip, all lit up.    In the end, this was worth the trip, good food, very good service and amazing views.",

My wife got the filet mignon with mashed potatoes and it was very very good, melt in your mouth. I got the ribey and it was very good and rightly juicy (that parmesan crust on it was interesting but i would not have put it there). The grilled beans on the side was below standard. As dessert our little one got the manho sorbet and it was good, and my wife and i shared the creme broule and it was very good. As wine, i got some pinot noir 2012 dry and good as i like it and brachetto d'aqui with dessert, very veru good! Our waiter Max was very kind, lovely and prepared. Location is the best part of this place, we got rim seats and we had great time also watching the sunset! Great experience. Food is overall heavy and hot 5 stars premium steak house but you dont go there necesserlly for that. You want the package and you'll get it. You feel like you are on a first class seat on a plane landing on Los Angeles! As they say there, great view! Check can be expensive, but at the end is more than fair and convennient, conisderimg also you get access to the deck at 109th. Floor (which it would cost i believe $20 per person, itself). Perfect spot to celebrate a good occasion! Also, stratosphere hotel was better than expected and valet service is free (kinda rare in vegas these days) quick! We have been to vegas many times, and we are happy we finally tried this place! Highly recommended!",

    "text": "I've always felt the Top of the World restaurant that sits close to the top of the 1,149-foot Stratosphere hotel and casino was a bit of a gimmick and a tourist trap. It's 844 feet in the air so you're guaranteed a spectacular view of Las Vegas, and it rotates so your viewpoint is constantly changing, but what about the food?  As the missus and I didn't want to risk $20 a person on appetizers, and then spend another $40 to $50 each on entrees (should they just be passable because the view was certainly there to make up for them), we decided to take this restaurant around for a spin for a less expensive lunch and were, much to our surprise, quite impressed.  I settled on a salad for my meal: fresh heirloom tomatoes interlaced with chunks of bright red watermelon and squeaky mozzarella, supported by crunchy pistachio bits and a sweet balsamic and sherry vinaigrette drizzle. This was followed by a calamari and shrimp fritto misto appetizer that also included fried peppers and olives, and was presented in what I would call \"Two-Face\" style: half the plate was resting in a warm, somewhat chunky old-school tomato sauce, and the other half was basking in a delightful wasabi sour cream. Both of these plates had some thought put into them, as they were carefully designed to be tiny works of art on a plate, yet also flavorful and perfect for a light lunch.  This missus opted for the lobster grilled cheese sandwich that was served with a tomato bisque. The sandwich was prepared with huge chunks of scrumptious Canadian lobster trapped between layers of gooey cheddar and Brie, while the bisque was smooth and was presented with some playfulness -- the cup sat atop a raw slice of tomato that seemed to represent the \"tomato base\"  this dish used. She relished both items.  Some of the marketing this restaurant uses in its ads suggests eating here will \"heighten your senses\" and you can \"taste the unexpected\". Truth in advertising? Most definitely. The dishes we ate here exceeded our initial, jaded expectations, and I would come back to try their dinner or tasting menu, and experience Vegas at dusk.  That said, the view does seem to have an impact on the menu's prices. While I am definitely not shy when it comes to spending around $150 for a nice dinner out for two in Vegas, especially when what's offered is something unique, would I spend the same to eat at Top of World for dinner if it was 100 floors or so lower? Maybe? Maybe not?   Top of the World reminded me of a small restaurant I used to frequent very often in Montreal, Quebec that had an ever-changing, delectable seasonal menu, and always served consistently good comfort food, but an appetizer, main and dessert at dinner would never cost more than $35 per person, whereas lunch here was $45 each for what we ordered (plus two drinks).  When I focus on the quality of the food alone and the way it was presented, Top of the World was definitely on par with that spot, which still holds a special place in my heart, so maybe that's why I feel its pricing might get in the way of a repeat visit if you don't really care about the view.   I think this is a restaurant one must definitely experience if you've been to Vegas a couple times or it's your first trip there, and you'd never take a helicopter tour of the strip. You definitely won't be disappointed by the sensory experiences this restaurant offers -- from its crafty, tempting dishes to its breath-taking city views. When everything is factored together, the price is indeed right for the whole package, but if you're on a budget or just want to sample their menu, they are open for lunch.",

The restaurant rotates very slowly so you can pretty much see the entire 360 view while you're eating. You can also see people bungee jumping from the building... eek! I don't remember if it was from an adjacent building or the same building as the restaurant, but all I remember is seeing people hooked to cables and jumping off while we were having dinner.

    "text": "I have very conflicted opinions about Top of the World. On one hand, I proposed to my wife here, on the other hand, the service was just terrible.  I did a lot of research before choosing this restaurant to propose. I knew I'd be in Vegas with some of our closest friends and I needed a nice place that could accommodate all of us. In the end, I ended up choosing this restaurant.  Now the restaurant is very nice. The view at night was just marvelous, and I highly recommend coming here for a drink or two if you're in Vegas, just for the view itself. This is a rotating restaurant, meaning that you get a 360 degree view of Vegas.  We had a party of 12, so had to sit in 2 different tables, that were next to each other. We had 2 different waiters (I mention this for a reason, so read on...).  We ordered a few different appetizers, and I think most of us ordered steak for the entree, and we were all happy with the food (albeit the price).  Now I had popped the question after dinner, and we were all very happy because she had said \"yes\". There was a small band in the restaurant that even sang a song for us. Everything was nice, until the waiters for one of our table came by and told us we had to leave because another group was waiting for our table. We had just gotten dessert at our table, so we weren't even finished with our meal. The waitress was very rude and her supervisor also came by and said we had to leave.  I was a little surprised at their tone, and didn't expect this kind of behavior from this restaurant.  For 12 of us, our bill was over $1,200. You would think after spending that much, they would be a little nicer to you.  It's a shame that service was so bad here. We came here to celebrate such a memorable occasion, but in the end, the service left a bad taste in our mouth.",

However.... the food was horrible the steaks were all drizzled in mystery sauces and they had absolutely no flavor.  Our party ordered at least 10 bone in rib eyes 3 salmon dinners, 3 Surf and Turfs and each person complained about taste, done level and toughness.  The Lobster Bisque tasted sugary and the Cucumber cocktails were horrible.  Quite frankly the only thing we enjoyed was the bread and even that was a stretch and we purposely waited in hopes that this dining experience would be top notch.  We spent $2500 on a table of food not including tip.  The food reminded me of ponderosa.  My suggestion would be to collect feedback to help improve the dining experience.  It would be a shame to waste such a beautiful view and decor on crappy food.  I think you all have potential!!!!! But only if you take action  Look to hire a chef that is more forward thinking one that seeks feedback. In order to be a 5 star restaurant you all will need to send the chef out to interact with your customers or at least a manager.  After the first 15 minutes of Oooos and Ahhhs it was a horrible experience.  Thanks Eyenoticed!",

Came here for lunch and had the three course prix fixie lunch which was really worth the price because the portion was good and the food such as the lobster tail and filet mignon was excellent but the lobster bisque soup was a bit to heavy for me. The dessert were also just an okay because it had the looks but just tasted alright and was tad simple nothing that makes you have that you know satisfaction moment. but overall it was well worth it to come here and have lunch even though it's at the far end of the strip it was still worth the trip.",

    "text": "Food was a 3 star rating, but that gorgeous view bumped this up to 5 stars. I mean really now, you're paying for the ambiance and the views. There's nowhere else like this in the city. A restaurant that rotates all 360 degrees in an hour span? Yeah, it's real nice.  Came here for Valentine's Day dinner (not on the actual day but the weekend before) around 7pm. We valet because it'll be quite a hike if you park in their parking garage. If you valet, it's only a short walk to the tower entrance. And as of Feb 2017, self parking is still at no charge.  For appetizers, we each ordered a salad; Caesar and Wedge salads. They were big enough to share. For entrees, I ordered Miso-Glazed Chilean Sea Bass-with baby bok choy, tamari, ginger, garlic, and pickled carrot garnish. Portions were big enough for leftovers. My boyfriend got a steak filet. And we shared the twice baked potato topped with bacon, cheddar and green onions. Honestly, the food was alright. It was good....but nothing like \"whoa!!!!\" And my dish might have sat out for awhile because it wasn't pippin hot when it arrived to my table. That's one of my pet peeves....lukewarm food. Blehhhhh!!! I still would like to come back for lunch though...looking at some of the pictures of the lobster sandwich...yum!  Skipped on dessert because I'm not much of a sweets person plus we were too full already. But I have no doubt their dessert items must taste divine.  Like I mentioned before, you're really paying for the view. Especially during dinnertime. The restaurant rotates 360 degrees so don't worry if you don't have a view of The Las Vegas Strip when you first get seated. Eventually, you'll get to it. And for those that are sensitive to motion, it moves so slow, you really don't feel it. You're definitely NOT moving like a merry-go-round.  Tourist or local, I would recommend trying this restaurant. Lunch or dinner....you can't really go wrong. They have the menu on their website complete with pricing too. Enjoy!",

However, many of our neighbors in dining showed up in lackluster shorts and tee shirts. But dare you ask for accommodations on your meal such as extra butter or no lobster in the Mac n cheese. The servers are kind but not accommodating. Views are incredible but not worth the price tag of the disappointing dinner.",

    "text": "A rotating restaurant on the 106 th floor overlooking Las Vegas. Must have a reservation. Beautiful and constantly changing view. We went after dark for dinner and the city was all aglow.  Had a wonderful meal. We went with the four course meal. Lobster bisque was rich and creamy, Caesar salad was large and crisp. Then had Maryland lump crab cakes - excellent. There was also a choice of a pasta dish rather than the crab cake. Main course was a choice of filet mignon and jumbo shrimp, or a Wild salmon steak with large jumbo shrimp's in the citrus glaze. The portions were large and perfectly cooked. For dessert you have a choice of salted caramel creme brulee or spumoni ice cream. Both were delicious and portions very large. By the time our desserts came we were almost to full to eat them, mind you I said almost too full.  Both the beef, the shrimp and the salmon were cooked to perfection. Each of the four course meal's was of $105. A bottle of sparkling water is eight dollars. Our waiter was perfect attentive but did not rush us in anyway. Our waiter brought the food out with perfect timing between each course. He checked in once and a while  but not too often to make sure everything was fine and brought extra bread etc. when we needed it.We sat at nine and the restaurant was open till 11 and they never asked us to move or make us feel rushed as we needed to get out. Was very happy with our dinner and the view was amazing. If you're going to Vegas it's worth it to try the top of the world restaurant. Oh by the way, you can order straight off the menu you don't need to order a four course meal. But when I added together all the items I wanted to try the lobster bisque a Caesar salad etc. it was less expensive to just go with the four course meal",

It seems we paid heavily for a nice view, because the food was far from worth the cost. We will not return or recommend.",

    "text": "Food: We went with a party of 10 and all agreed to this. The taste of the food was good but nothing special to brag about. It is very expensive. For example, you order a steak, depending on which one between $46-$79, and it doesn't even come with anything else! Then you'll have to order your side which would be another $15-$25. The portions were not that great and the food was over cooked in my opinion. The bread basket they bring before the meal, one type of bread and a giant Dorito with a cream dipping sauce, was not that great! I give the food 3 stars.  Venue: The scenery is amazing! Definitely cannot complain about it at all. The place is clean and set up nicely. The bathrooms were very clean as well. I couldn't hear the cooks yelling or playing their music which is annoying to me. If you don't like heights this place may not be for you and to top things off the place spins so it may make you a little sick. I give the venue 5 stars!  Service: It was good but not great. I had to ask my waiter twice to fill my glass. We asked him for a group photo and he made a face. When one person in my group asked for a $15 salad, he made a face and asked, \"That's what you're gonna have for the dinner?\"  I give the service a 3.  Location: I know there is nothing they can do to relocate the stratosphere so I'll be fair. By the time you get through traffic on the Strip, wait in line to get into the garage, go through a crowded tight garage and find a tight parking space, walk through their long crowded Smokey casino with their employees bugging you as to whether you want to purchase tickets for their show, walk through their mall with their employees bugging you as to whether you would like a butt massage, go through a metal detector, wait for an elevator in a long line, wait in a small crowded elevator with a lot of people and have your head feel like it's going to explode from the quick  altitude change, then arrive to wait in line again to get seated, then told you can't be seated until your entire party arrives, then finally get seated and have to wait another 30-45 mins for the food, then after you eat, reverse everything all over again, you can feel really exhausted, drained, or disappointed. I give the location a 2.  Final score: 3+5+3+2=13 13/4=3.25  Recommendation: If you want to see your house, the entire city, or trying to impress your date with a beautiful sunset or a selfie, then take her here to see the city on the Stratosphere observation floor, which is above the restaurant and free of charge. Then, after burning all them calories to get there, burn a little more and take her for another nice view, but better food, service and venue at the Paris restaurant. Also about the same price. Just make sure you make reservations ahead of time.   BUT, if you want really good food, a nice romantic night, nice venue, great service, for a 1/4 the price of the Stratosphere or the Paris, and save a ton load more money to get her a nice gift later, take her to Capos Italian restaurant! You won't regret it! Again, make reservations!",

If you get motion sickness this isn't for you! I totally got a little light headed and dizzy after watching the view for sure. Now ... let's talk about the food ! Very average nothing special but the prices are ridiculous! We had a party of 8 and out bill was about 1k. Totally sucks that the so called \"Steak\" is really similar to some damn carne asada from home ! From one of the guys that came in our group said the wine wasn't so pleasant at all. Only thing I can say was pretty good was the Mac and cheese with lobster! Maryland stuffed chicken weren't so great! If I would of known how much money we would of spent I would of gotten to another awesome place on the strip !",

I've been to a rotating restaurant before (shout-out to The View in NYC), so that didn't really phase or impress me, but yeah. It's very pretty. and 2.) going to the restaurant gives you free access to the Stratosphere observation deck afterwards.  The food was really lame, though. I got the rotini, which was overcooked with pasta sauce that tasted like nothing. I paid probably $30+ for something I could have made for myself way better at home. I got the lobster mac as well so I had something to eat later in the hotel; it also just wasn't that good. Way too rich.  The cocktails were weak but very tasty. I highly recommend the dessert cocktails. I got the Spark Plug & the Key Lime Pie.  Just recognize that you're coming here for the view and not an amazing culinary experience.

This also seems to be a \"Stratosphere hotel,\" kinda issue. I will say I went to other hotels and got a 12/13 dollar drink and that's kind of just a Vegas thing. At the top of the world they are charging 17 and up! Come on now if you are going to charge me 17 that better be a great cocktail and guess what it was mehhhh.   Long story short it's expensive, it's worth it. But maybe have the cocktails elsewhere not at this particular location.",

When it comes to the food, I had some delicious Lamb and filet mignon tartare, all great, I would totally come back here, the view is amazing, you can see the strip and also see the people who jump our of the bungee. Also they have a cool bar that is not spinning.",

The food were okay, just decent enough because the atmosphere made up for it. On the other hand, service was terrible. The lady that served us just seemed like she didn't care. Her face was nonchalant. I don't know if she just have no emotion but she seemed apathetic l(I feel like gratuity were already included so she didn't have any concerns). It took forever for food to come out. By the time our steaks came out, our appetite were ruined. Each time, I have to raised my hand and tracked the server down. If it's too busy for her, then they should hire more servers on the floor.   Also, drinks here are not great. How can you messed up on a martinis?? I asked the server about this cocktail drink, if it's really sweet? Because I don't like too sweet. She assure me, it's not too sweet. Honey, it was really sweet. I didn't even drink half of my drink.   Overall, the server killed it for us.",

It's honestly breath-taking. So cool.   We ordered A L O T of food. We truly went all out. The beet salad, lobster bisque, shellfish tower, filet mignon, green beans, twice baked potato, bottle of wine. Everything was perfect.   The service was lacking, however. The waitress wasn't entire attentive and she was rather slow. It didn't take away from the overall experience and food though!  I recommend after dinner going up to the bar and then all the way up to the top to go watch people bungy jump and ride on the rides. I'm so happy we made our way here!! Would love to come back.",

We waited 40 minutes for our reservation at a bar in the upper deck with a bartender that couldn't handle a party of six at her bar. (It was only ya at the bar)   After being seated a waiter poured water for us and spilt it everywhere. After a long wait another waiter came to take our order we were told that we must order and entree or order food that is similar priced. This stipulation was not mentioned anywhere in the restaurant or menu or during our reservation.  We asked to have a moment and were left for about 20 minutes while the restaurant was very slow.   My cup of ice I ordered did not come out until the entrees after asking three different people. The entries were bland and the sides were decent.   The waiting staff treated us poorly based on the money amount of food we were ordering and we only saw our waiter twice during our dining experience.   My wife found lobster shell in her lobster Mac and cheese and the staff argued with me about discounting that side from our check.   Over all I suggest you come here to enjoy the view and have a snack. Don't dine unless you're prepared for a long wait, poor service and over priced food.",

The Spaghetti Squash was flavorful and delicious but the highlight of my meal was the warm bread that they brought to the table and the Bananas Foster that I had for dessert.   The views were breathtaking and we got to see a few people bungee jumping right off the rooftop directly outside the restaurant window. It took about an hour for the restaurant to spin back to it's starting point so we were able to see all of the sights...it was very beautiful.

Pros- bussers and food runners, view Cons- food sanitation, hair in our food, worst waiter I have ever had  As a Las Vegas local I have tried my share of fine dining in the valley, I have been to this restaurant multiple times throughout the years as we enjoy the view, and it's always a unique experience for guests staying with us. This time around I was pleasantly surprised to find a groupon at a great price, it doesn't matter how much money you have, saving money is always a bonus. With our second course there was a hair in our food, we let our waiter know and he just picked up the plate and said oh ok. No apology, no I'm sorry for the inconvenience, nothing. Later the manager came by with the remade plate, apologized and was very kind, however he's not the one working for tips. By the time we finished, we asked for our food to be put away to go, I asked him to include the sauces we paid for, but obviously he was in another world and did whatever he wanted. By the time we paid, he was acting extremely rude and just plopped the check with our change on the table, I was just waiting for him to throw it at us. Didn't even say thank you, or acknowledge our presence. Awful awful service, for the first time in my entire life I actually considered leaving no tip, but that wouldn't have been fair to the bussers and food runners who were actually kind and did their job.   If you want to see the view, just go to the sky deck for a drink, we still had a fabulous time despite the dreadful service. I would recommend taking your money somewhere else.",

First off, the food is very limited and everything is over priced. I ordered lobster ravioli for $38 and all I got was 6 raviolis and a lobster *tail* which was more like a very small piece of lobster meat. My bf ordered a filet mignon that barely had any flavor and cost $44. The only item I really enjoyed was my garlic mashed potatoes (($8). Other than that, the service was poor. The waiter didn't even come back with my change AND I waited 30 mins. for the change. I was gonna tip him more, but since he never came back, I just let him keep the change.",

They give you a beautiful large bowl with pieces of lobster and butter in the middle, they then serve you the bisque separately.  I really enjoyed this, the rest of the food that my husband and son ordered was really good.  I'd come here again just for that lobster bisque.  Don't miss out!!!  By the way, our waitress was great, she was really good with my son and was so nice!",

Then again this was 3 years ago so i hope they improved but i will NEVER go back.

    "text": "First, let me say I and my wife have celebrated our anniversary at the TOW for 18 consecutive years. On 4 October we once again made reservations for 5:30 PM so we could enjoy the sunset and Las Vegas Lights. We arrived 20 minutes early, checked in and went to the lounge. We were called and were shown to our table, by the window, as requested. When the waiter arrived he began speaking very fast and in broken English that neither of us could understand. The only understandable word was \"soup\". I asked the maitre de if we could have another waiter. After a few minutes he returned and told us there were no tables available for at least another half hour and he indicated we could wait in the lounge. On the way to the lounge we noticed many tables were vacant. When we asked about them the maitre de replied: \"We don't have any waiters for those areas yet.\" I and my wife were both flabbergasted by this strange occurrence of events and expressed our feelings. By now, both of us were discouraged and we decided to leave. It is very unfortunate that a good waiter will suffer since we normally tip between 25-40%, depending on the service. We were staying in our Motor Home at Sam's Town and we decided to return there and try the restaurant. We were pleasantly surprised at the quality of the food and the service was excellent.  I am sure we will miss dining at the TOW but we can afford better service.",

    "text": "Getting into this restaurant is almost like going through airport security, just without the pat down.  I had called and asked about dress code, then asked about reservations on a Tuesday night. The woman I spoke with said it was necessary if I wanted to get in.  After finally getting in, there wasn't anyone else there. In fact, they just opened and were still setting up. Great views as the restaurant rotated.  Watched the sky jumpers fly by!  Got a great waiter, Kevin.  Being my second time here, I knew the prices were a little high, IMO. But forty bucks for chicken? My wife said it was good, but forty bucks?  I understand the ambience, which was nice and the overhead. My wife wanted to split a meal with a friend who joined us because she is a light eater. The waiter told us they would have to order an 80 dollar meal and there would also be an 8 dollar plate charge.  Huh? Is this customary at most high-end restaurants?  I ordered the salmon, which was excellent. The Yukon Gold mashed potatoes were absolutely delicious.  Bread and butter was very good also.  Overall, it was a good time.  I did expect to pay a pretty penny to eat here.   If you are talking about value for the cost, though, this did not meet or exceed my expectations. But I think the next time I want a great romantic meal, I will choose some place else.",

    "text": "On a trip to Vegas a few months ago  we decided to give the stratosphere a try for our last night in town. Paid les than 100.00 for the oasis suite on Sunday night. We were looking forward to dinning at the Top of the world restaurant mainly for the view. Getting to the restaurant was somewhat of a challenge from the time we entered the elevator loading area on the main floor to the restaurant.  Had to ask for directions a couple a times. Once seated we began with their very taste bread basket and wine.   My wife ordered the ribeye and was fairly satisfied with it, but not a memorable steak. ( I prefer a fire charred steak)  We shared a huge twice baked potato (very good) and field greens salad. I ordered the lobster bisque (not bad, I've eaten better) and the prawns, scallops and lobster plate. The roasted salad and the scallops were very good, that's where it stopped. The lobster and the shrimp had a little bit of foul fishy taste. I could not identify it at the time but the other day I was eating crab legs and took a bite of the shoulder meat, there's that the taste I remember. We will not be back for the food, but if we book a room we may have a drink at the bar for the view.(fantastic view)  There are much  better restaurants in town for the same prices. I give the view 5 stars.",

    "text": "So, the Fella and I had a great spontaneous weekend in Vegas.  Business trip layover that turned into a little holiday for us, complete with show and gambling.  Yay!  The Fella had heard through the grapevine that lunch at the Stratosphere was delicious, and a bit of a better deal than the dinner, so we tried it out before I schlepped off to the airport.  Pretty much everything on the lunch menu was around $20, and that included the price of the ride up to the top.  After our meal we were also able to go to the indoor observation deck, and would have gone to the outdoor deck as well, but it had closed due to a lightning storm. Let me say, I was a little nervous... not about the height, but about the rotation.  I get seriously motion sick, and even just the swaying of the tower could make me ill.  Fortunately, it seems that the circumference of the rotating area must be larger than other rotating places I've eaten, because I was able to enjoy the sweeping mountain views, and the top notch prime rib!  The Fella isn't usually an atmosphere kind of guy, but he LOVED it (the steak helped, too).  We'll be back!",

    "text": "My boyfriend took me here for my birthday Sunday evening.  I want to start with one note about Stratosphere employees- they ARE AWESOME.  Everyone from security to the janitors were so FRIENDLY.  I mean I have never had a janitor be so nice (she was working Sunday night around 8 or 9 cleaning the bathroom in Top of the World restaurant.)  This was my first time in the Stratosphere ever and I was very impressed how darn nice every employee was.  It makes a huge difference when even janitors and security are nice!  Anyways, I will start the night at security!  My first impression of a line going through a metal detector was \"ghetto!\"  I didn't realize to get to the top of the Stratosphere that we would be subject to a pat-down!  I never experienced this anywhere else on the strip.  There was a delay for my boyfriend and I so it took us longer to get through.  The security kid called the restaurant for us and told them we would be a bit late.  How nice is that that he did that for us???  The security director came and cleared us to go up after a brief wait.  So we go upstairs and of course the person operating the elevator was super friendly (as was a different person on the way back down.)  The Top of the World restaurant was kind of older looking- like the carpet was very thin and worn-out looking but it was still cute and of course the view is so neat!  Can't beat the view.  Our server was also very good although a bit pushy throughout our meal to upsell us on drinks, upgrades, etc.  A bit annoying because we don't drink alcohol much and I am trying to cut back on caffeine sine I am trying to get pregnant.  None of her business but it was annoying to be asked over and over again if we wanted drinks of coffee.  I digress.  I ended up ordering the tasting menu for $90.  Quite expensive considering the portions I received for the tasting menu.  I would have been better off just getting a meal and a dessert.  I swear it would have been the same price but I would have gotten full-sized items.  My tasting menu started out with lobster bisque.  It was excellent!  I could definitely taste the sherry and cream that was poured over fresh chives and lobster pieces.  Again, it was not a full bowl but enough.  Then came one scallop in a grain and sauce.  The scallop was pretty good but could have been seared more.  Next came a full-sized salmon portion with some kind of seed crust, two prawn and it was over some mayo-type cream and baby potato halves.  I was absolutely disgusted by whatever the mayo-cream was.  It was thick and literally was like mayonnaise.  So gross!!!!  The salmon was good but very oily- and I am not talking about natural omega-3 oils.  The prawn were overcooked.  My boyfriend's meal of fettucine pasta with lobster, scallops and shrimp arrived with my salmon entree.  He ate all the seafood but was sad the pasta was very buttery and not cheesy.  Major fail that a \"nice\" restaurant can't get an alfredo correct.  Both entrees were very disappointing.  I upgraded to the grand marnier cake which my boyfriend said ended up being a $15 upcharge.  I hope that I misheard that because I would not have upgraded had I known that.  Not worth it at all.  I love cake and this cake was lacking in taste.  It was a cake wrapped in a hard chocolate shell.  Very pretty but I prefer frosting to thin, hard chocolate.  I just wasn't terribly impressed with the food.  Honestly I would have been happier eating at Nora's or Honeysalt and just seeing the view from Mandalay Bay or the ferris wheel at the Linq.  Dinner was a total of just under $200.  Absolutely not worth it.  The view is cool but if you come here I recommend not being sat for a full dinner.  Just go get drinks and an appetizer.  Don't waste your money on the tasting menu either.  $90 is crazy when it wasn't that good of an entree and you don't get much in terms of starters.",

Stratosphere is famous for their 360 rotating view of the city. There are some sections where you can see people bungee jump off thr building. Its scary to watch I guess because we had several people warn us about it. A photographer will  also go around and ask if you want your picture taken and sell them to you later for $25-$45 depending on what you purchase (very touristy). Our waiter was funny and often checked up on us. For service I would give it 5 stars. I would give the food 4 stars it was good but not the best. I ordered lobster bisque and the color was darker than normal and it was way too salty. They pour the soup from a container in front of you. I also ordered the surf and turf (lobster and filet mignon) that was pretty good. For drinks I got a Kentucky mule. It was not strong at all and there was not enough of the Ginger beer taste. They didn't make their drinks so good there. My bf got the Lamb chops. I actually preferred that over my steak since his had so much more flavor. Overall I would still give the place 4 stars because it was still a magicial experience mostly from the view and service. But the food and drinks could have been better for what we paid for.",

I could have cut the filet with a spoon because it was so tender. The rotation takes about an hour which is perfect for a nice dinner. I also suggest making reservations, especially on a weekend. For a filet/shrimp, filet/lobster tail, 2 Cokes and 2 caesar salads it cost $210 before a tip.. so have your wallet prepared! Totally worth it though, I'm telling you!",

    "text": "Vegas is pricey these days...and every celeb chef and their uncle has opened a sooooooper-high-end restaurant in Sin City to capitalize on the wannabe-foodie trends.  Most of these places are in windowless casinos, or worse, underground in the bowels of echoey mega-malls along the strip.  If you're going to pay $50 for an entree, don't you at least want a view???  Yes, you do.  And this is precisely why you want to reserve a table at sunset at the Top of the World Restaurant.  Trust me, it's worth it.    The service is superb, the diningroom isn't uber-crowded or loud, and the waiters hop around the spectacular moving dining floor like ballet dancers!  Your water glass will never fall empty, your dinner won't take forever to exit the kitchen, and if you are a glutton (of COURSE you are, you came to Vegas, didn't you?!!), this is a great place to indulge!  Nothing on the menu is visionary.  If you're looking for molecular gastronomy, far-flung ingredients you've never heard of, or deconstructed dishes with fifty ingredients that all together amount to two whole bites of food, you've come to the wrong place.  You come here for the view, and a perfectly cooked steak.  And while you're at it, try the Lobster Bisque.  It's exquisite.  I promise!  I ordered the Turf and Quack:  A sublimely seared hunk of foie gras perching next to a like-buttah rare filet, complimented by a divinely tender duck breast.  There are sauces on each of these, and they are all tasty.  But even if you ordered this dish without sauce, it wouldn't matter:  the quality of ingredients plus the perfection with which they are cooked is enough to make a girl swoon!  Rumor has it there were some carbs on that plate, too, but for the life of me, I couldn't tell you what they were, because I was so busy moaning over each buttery bite of duck, foie, or filet!  Oh, yes, the floor moves......very.........sloooooooooooowwwwwly.  Don't worry, unless you are particularly sensitive, this won't make you queasy, and in fact, since it takes almost an hour to do a 365 degree rotation.  You will be warned by your server not to freak out if you see someone sky-diving by during dinner...this is Vegas, what would your vacation be without vicariously enjoying a flying Elvis or three?!  Next time I'm in Vegas, this is at the top of my dining to-do list...After all, I can't imagine a better way to spend a Sin City sunset than dining on a delicious dish and whiling away the hours at the Top of the World...!",

We also ordered some appetizers which were pretty tasty. Yes it is pricey, but that is what I expect for Vegas. If you haven't checked this place out, it is definitely worth the trip to the Stratosphere. Also, you get to see all the jumpers (bungee that is lol).",

The Lobster Bisque is something out of this world. Our steaks were cooked to perfection and we ended our meal with a sampling of amazing deserts.

An ample steak-house like menu, but some great gourmet upgrades.  The Foie Gras appetizer leaves you wanting to order a second dish.  The lobster bisque is a meaty and hearty bowl, poured tableside.  The steak is grilled and a great marbled cut, while the chicken breast was moist with a crispy skin and an amazing sauce.  While you eat, the entire restaurant slowly rotates, taking about an hour to make a full rotation.  You'll be sure to see the skydivers jumping from the roof right past your window at some point of the tour.  A little bit pricey but considering it's vegas and you're floating up above the entire city, the meal is not a bad value.",

They did not even have the air conditioning working until the later half of my meal.  I went here 5 years ago and was very impressed.  After this last visit I won't return.",

    "text": "We went for lunch on a Sunday, because it would be more casual and cheaper.  I didn't expect a lame metal detector when you get in.  The restaurant spins very slowly, and takes something like an hour and a half to fully rotate.  I can't imagine getting dizzy because of this, but with enough wine, I guess anyone could.  Obviously everything is pricey.  I don't think the food was amazing enough to be priced that way, but it was very good nonetheless.    The view was great, I imagine its really great at night as well.  There are crazy rides on top of the building, so occasionally you see a glimpse of people flying around above you.  Service was impeccable, and we ended up staying almost two hours.  Glad to have gone, but probably wouldn't go back.",

Food was really great and the staff was so helpful. We have been there on a number of occasions but decided to take our 11 month old and were a bit worried of how it would work out since the restaurant does not seem to be \"kid friendly\" and more \"romantic\". Soon as we arrived, they were extremely great with us and even kept stopping by to say hello to our daughter. She loved the place and relaxed while mommy and daddy had a great dinner. Would highly recommend this place to anyone! :) Will definitely visit again soon.",

Meeting him really explained the amazeing service staff he has because positive attitude like his tends to have the trickle down effect.  This place is in the running for best view in vegas and let me say it is well deserved.  I brought a friend up with me and although the view wasn't wasted on us I couldn't help thinking how nice it would have been if I had brought my boyfriend up.  The food is amazeing all the way down to the side dishes.  I love my vegetables so I had 3 sides and each had the expected texture and flavor I was looking for.  Start out with the pork belly you will not be dissappointed.  The plan cha main was to die for.  I had the greatest service by Sheila (very attentive, sweet and knowledgeable)  but great service did not stop there.  Jen the photographer took the nicest pictures of us and was not pushy with the sale.  I would buy anything from someone like that.  I don't know who the chef is but he really knows what he is doing.  I wish I could get him to cater some parties for me.  I would be the envy of all my friends if I could serve food like that.  I just hope the staff here will take time to pay it forward and write nice reviews about others as well.  Let's spread the positive energy whenever we can.  I will be back.",

    "text": "Similar to other folks, I give the view 5/5, and the food 3/5.    It's certainly not that the food is _bad_, just that it doesn't live up to the prices.    we ordered the four course tasting menu with wine.  The food was good, not great; the wines were uniformly tasty.  Some of the wine-food pairings were questionable - one dish was a roasted lamb chop served with a sauteed sea bass.  the served strong red wine tasted nice with the lamb dish, but wine accentuated the fishy flavor of the fish dish, which I don't think was the intended effect.  Desserts tasted good, and were very well presented.  Overall, I would definitely recommend it for a romantic or memorable dinner.   In my opinion, _don't_ order the tasting menus, as the extra cost in food isn't worth it here. Order an app, an entree, enjoy the wine menu and recommendations, and save room for desert.  The view, however, is worth the cost, especially around sunset.  I'd suggest coming ~30 min before sunset, so that you get some lighted view, and get to see most of the lights on.      last 2 tips:  every seat has a great view, and there is free valet parking at the hotel for anyone who has a reservation at the restaurant. turn right when you come in the parking lot.",

Dinner and the view is always incredible.  However once our dinner was over that was pretty much it.  When we were seated the greeter wished us a happy anniversary and that was that... not a complimentary NOTHING.  We were pretty bummed.

Live band and attentive bartenders. Great place just to have a few drinks. Our server Lou was great. She was very honest about food options and she was attentive. We both ordered the pre-fixed four course meal. First course we had Caesar salad which was delicious. Second was crab cake for me and saw bass for my husband. Crab cakes were so delicious bursts of so many flavors cilantro and capers tasted great together. Sea bass had great flavor but it was on the small side, but great flavor. Third we ordered filet cooked medium. It was delicious with mushroom sauce and string beans. Fourth course were two measly mini desserts it was disappointing. Dessert is what we always look forward to. One bite was a bananas foster which was really good the second bite was a dry chocolate with some fruit jelly maybe raspberry it wasn't good. But it didn't ruin the experience. Ambience is nice and romantic. Even though I have lived here for 8 years I never tire of looking at the valley lit up at night. We had a great experience and will go back!",

The service was one of the best I have ever experienced. Our waiter, Jeff, was incredibly kind, very professional and constantly checked on us during our meal.  The reason I left off 1 star is for the portions, price and the main reason is that this restaurant and the Stratosphere is in a VERY bad part of town. Me and my Wife accidentally walked down the wrong street in a suit and dress and got harassed by some gang banger. Literally one block later, there is the Stratosphere. This isn't their fault, but it takes away from the overall experience.",

I contemplated the Palms Alize(great service, great food, great scenery) or Anthony's in the M Resort.  I choose the Stratosphere.    The food was over priced.  The food tasted that of a $15-25 range.  The alcohol drinks were decent.  Scenery was nice but not worth the price.  Folks are better off ordering Apple Bee's to go and paying the $7-10 to go the top and eat while watching folks jump of the side for the added thrill.  Not worth the money.  Glenn is a horrible server.  If you are a party of two he will ignore you.  Eric the waiter & Tomas the buser were the only two that provided exemplary customer service.  Eric was not our server but he did such a wonderful job in providing good service for the party of two next to our table I asked for his name.  Tomas was courteous and very helpful.  Do not waste your money folks just visit the top & eat somewhere else to get the bang for your recessional buck or dine at a place where the staff are appreciative of your business and are grateful you'll spend over $200 to eat at their establishment.",

When I took the Stratosphere Tower Tour five years ago, I knew that the next time we went to Vegas we had to have a meal in the Top of the World Restaurant.  So, with a month's advance booking, we enjoyed a Saturday lunch here.    Looking out over the desert, no wait, out over the city, no wait, out toward the mountains ... from this rotating restaurant we saw the expanse of The Meadows as never before.  We could see the runways at Nellis.  We could see the red rocks.  We could see an entire train, all 4 engines and 100 cars, in one sweeping view below us.  Oh, how about 8 helicopters flying below us?  Yes, from 1,000 feet up, everything looks different.    Daytime or nighttime, it's a spectacular view.    Yes, we ate.  Let's see ... iced tea ... no, you know it was fantastic!  Here:  an appetizer of salmon with salsa, cream, and homemade chips, you had to be there to believe it, but go ahead and look at the pictures.  A Caesar salad that was not so Caesar, but an interesting mix of things.  Surf & turf.  You bet.  More salmon, on a bed of asparagus, or some such thing.  House champagne, which is why my notes were less than perfect.   OK, I forgot to photograph the entrees, what am I, a columnist?  No, I'm a guy who was having a great time in the sky.    Oh, yeah.  Stratosphere chocolate for dessert.   A variety dish, with 3 desserts on it.  Hey, I got a shot of that one!   OK, so lunch for 2 was $109.18 + tip.  If you need to work up the nerve to go there, try the Stratosphere Tower Tour first.  Then, when you want to impress Your Lady, take her to this \"romantic experience\" restaurant.  You won't be sorry.",

I had read the reviews prior to going and some reviews complained about high prices and mediocre food. Yes prices might be a tad high (I'm originally from Chicago now a Neveda local) but didn't find the prices that extreme for a fine dining restaurant with an awesome view. I read several reviews complaining about the steak(s) having no flavor so I was going to steer clear of steak. I informed our friends about the steak reviews but 2 of them went ahead and ordered steak anyways. Both steaks different cuts and preparations were delicious. My hubby ordered seafood fettuccine Alfredo, I'm not a big Alfredo fan but tried it and it was loaded with seafood (lobster, shrimp, crabmeat) and had great seasoning very yummy. My reason for 4 stars is because I ordered the Colorado lamb chops. I had heard that Colorado lamb is the best and have had it before. 2 nice sized chops cooked perfectly (medium rare) very tender.  Problem it came with a glace sauce over it (which I was aware of) but the sauce was beef flavored so much that I couldn't really taste the lamb. So if you like lamb like I do I would ask to skip the sauce all together or ask for it on the side. The best dessert of the night was the bananas foster and the presentation isn't bad either. So if your celebrating something special or just a splurge night out this is the place.",

We arrived at dusk & let me tell you the atmosphere was beautiful as it slowly turns and you are able to see a view of the whole city, it was just lovely as the sunset Wow then all the jewels (lights) came on gorgeous, my son is a gem and loves to take me to fabulous restaurants in LV. Our dinner was delicious & our waiter was very friendly we were not rushed at all. All in all it was a spectacular Mother's Day dinner! After dinner we went to the bar one floor up and had a drink sitting by the window and enjoying our conversation in our beautiful city!",

Oh god please let us be revolving, because if we're not then I'll feel like such the dumbass suggesting we have dinner in a revolving restaurant that doesn't revolve.  Those where the thoughts revolving through my head as we waited in the lounge for our table.  Thank Allah my prayers were answered and we were indeed revolving.  Does food taste better while it revolves?  Is it worth the hella price markup?  I would say, mehpm *shrug*.  I'm a big believer in unity and coming together, so this whole \"everything a la carte\" thang rubs me the wrong way.  In spite of being seperated at delivery my steak was delectable and the asparagus spears were mutantally large (see pic for proof).  We had a bottle of wine, that was difficult for me to order well knowing that I could buy it for 30 dollars less at Costco.  Yep, that's the classy dame in me coming out.  After dinner, you're allowed access to the observation deck.  Make sure to take pictures in the cheesy \"Stratesphere\" photo booth.  They make great postcards and you get a couple wallet sized as well.  All in all, I would come here, if this is your first time dining like a record baby. (right round round round)",

    "text": "I walked away (well, actually Skyjumped away) from cocktails and appetizers at Top of the World very pleasantly surprised by the experience.  This lounge/restaurant at the top of The Stratosphere tower is obviously a Vegas tourist spot, and the primary draw will always be the views.  I was part of a group of 6 ladies who were sharing happy hour cocktails and snacks on a Tuesday evening when plenty of table were available.  We were greeted by a very friendly hostess who set us up at a sweet lounge table with 6 wingback chairs, and presented us with menus and an explanation of the 2-for-1 martini happy hour.  We ordered a round of blueberry martinis which were made with muddled fresh blueberries and a choice of premium vodkas.  We were entertained to learn that the \"2-for-1\" meant that we would each receive two giant cocktails at the same time.  Whee!  We shared an assortment of snacks including duck sliders, shrimp cocktail, calamari, tomato-cheese fondue, and tuna tataki.  All were very good, and the presentation of each was lovely.  I was pleasantly surprised by the diversity of the flavor profiles among the dishes, as they could get away with a much more generic menu.  The portions were appropriately appetizer sized and, if one wanted to make a tapas meal out of happy hour, 3-4 items per person would yield a generous amount of food.  I regret not looking over the dinner menu, as our appetizers here were some of the best tasting food I had while in Vegas.  If I found myself back in Vegas, I would definitely go back to Top of the World for cocktails and snacks, and would probably give it a go for dinner.",

We got the yukon mashed potatoes, glazed carrots, twice baked potato and button mushrooms for the table. I had a nice glass of merlot with my steak.  The twice baked was rich and creamy.  You really can't go wrong with bacon, cheese and potatoes.  It was Christmas Day when we went.  I was slightly  annoyed I couldn't  get a burger for my daughter because lunch items were not available, I was able to get a grilled cheese and fries for my son.  (Just as background: my daughter is autistic and incredibly picky, I would have been fine being charged for a steak and getting a burger, although I did not share this with my server, they might have been more flexible if I had shared.  I just didn't  want to get into it).    The highlight of my meal was dessert.  I had the tres leches trifle.  It was amazing.  It included traditional tres leches cake and fresh berries layered with fresh whipped cream.  The teardrop chocolate cake and the cheesecake mouse were also hits.  Thank you Top of the world for some yummy Christmas food.",

    "text": "Of all the restaurants in Vegas, this one is the most unique and memorable for me.  I have been here around 15 to 20 times and nearly every time I go I bring someone new to experience it.    The top of the word is a high class restaurant that rotates around every 80 min or so and gives you the most spectacular views of the city.  You should make reservations and request a window table.    If you want the most spectacular views then plan a dinner there so you can see Vegas in its full luster with everything lite up but plan on spending about $100.00 a head which is well worth the experience.  Trust me.  The food quality, presentation and views are all 5 stars.    There is a secondary plan that I exercise often and that is a lunch date.  Again, make reservations and ask for a window table. I typically go around 11:30am and they have a killer cheeseburger as well as a large variety of lunch items like salads and sandwiches.  The pricing is more reasonable (like $20 for a meal) and you also get free admission to go up on top and ride the many rides or just continue your time taking in some additional views and pictures.    So, let me repeat.  If you only have time or money for one \"special night\" then book your lunch or dinner here.  This is a lifetime experience that you will not soon forget.    I have to update this only because the pricing for the lunches has escalated just a bit.  The burger is now $26 and most all of the meals are $25 to $40.  Even the grilled cheese is $25, albeit I'm sure it's huge. Even at that this is still the best view in Vegas and worth it.   Enjoy!",

I made a reservation on OpenTable and mentioned that the we were celebrating our 1 year wedding anniversary. The staff were kind enough to reserve a booth with an excellent view. I really thank you!  A really nice touch is that they provide a complimentary starter - different breads with 3 types of butter (ginger & orange, basil pesto & classic)  For the main dish I settled for the bone in fillet mignon & foie gras with a side of steamed asparagus & poached egg. I asked for the steak to be rare and they got it absolutely right. The steak also featured excellent caramelization like you would expect in such a high class restaurant. The poached egg had the perfect shape and consistency, it complemented both the steak and the asparagus. Another nice touch is that the sides are shareable. (they bring them in a separate plate)  For the desert I asked our server to recommend something and she mentioned their all chocolate cake. I accepted the recommendation and I don't regret it. The cake was really well balanced and the right portion size.  All in all, this restaurant was the best place to celebrate our anniversary. We will be back! Thank you for the experience!",

In other words, the world was ours, we were going crazy and we were being extra indulgent. So even though we had already eaten, it was early and we still had plenty of time. We both were in the mood for a place with a view where we could share a couple small things. I made a reservation through Open Table without a problem only an hour prior. Perfect!  We arrived just around sunset, which I would absolutely recommend! The sky was beautiful and eventually melted away to darkness illuminated by the lights of the city. So fun!!  The mixed bread basket was brought to the table after only a few minutes by our friendly waiter. My favorite was one that had a Cheese on top. But the large, seasoned crackers were good, too! There was also a trio of butter with the bread. One was some kind of garlic chive, another was a sweetened ginger and then there was plain. They were so flavorful and absolutely delicious!  We decided to the share the pork belly Appetizer. Pork belly is something I'm always interested in ordering, even though I've had very hot or miss experiences. Good news - this was a hit! The portion was decent, the meat was crispy/caramalized on the edges while the fat melted to butter and the sauce was great!  We were torn about dessert...thank goodness they have samples sitting out for you to see and your table eventually passes by them. I really like seeing the desserts before ordering because it really is important to me that I get something large. Also, the waiter made a good suggestion - he insisted the the berry Tres Leches was one of their bests. So we went with that and a creme brulee. Both were great, but the tres Leches was definitely my favorite! It was a pit sweeter than the brulee and I really enjoyed the different layers and textures.   This place was perfect for our romantic evening! I would definitely recommend checking it out!",

After that it was all down hill. My wife's 12oz lobster tail was dry and over cooked, my steak was just mediocre. We both had the baked potato and shared the mushrooms, which were also mediocre. Service was good except waiter never returned to check on our meal. When waiter returned we told him about the lobster. He offered to buy us dessert, nice but the lobster was $119.

We were trying to decide where to go eat on our special day.   After doing a little bit of research we decided to go here! Absolutely worth it!!!!   Beautiful building, with an amazing view!!! It is located in the 106th floor! The elevator takes 30'seconds to go all the way up! Staff are really nice, well educated, friendly, social, and excellent customer services.   As soon as we got there they sat us since we had a reservation! The only thing was we didn't get a table right in front of the view but our booth was pretty awesome!   Since it was our first time we did not know how the restaurant looked like or how everything works! I was astonished!!! The restaurant moves around 24/7. The table routes all night!!! Giving you an excellent beautiful unique awesome fenomenal view of the entire city of Las Vegas!!!!!! Not only that but you can expect people flying in front of you because the skydiving is in the other floor!   Our waitress was awesome! I don't rememb r her name but she was on point!!!!!   Food was terrific!!! Omg so yummy!!!!!! Delicious!!!! The complementary bread was yummy as well!   We decided to go with the chefs menu selection! I upgraded mine to the lobster!!!   We started of with the ceaser salad which was very tasty!!!!   Then we got the seared scallops!' Super tasty as well   My filet was right how I like it medium! Very juicy tender!!! And my lobster was one of the best lobster I had!!! My boyfriend steak was a little bit over cooked but he was okay with that so we didn't say anything!!   Our desert was the pumpkin crume bule!! At first I was like ewwww because I don't like pumpkin but I decided to give it a try and it was good!! I actually liked it! They also gave us a complementary dessert for our anniversary very sweet from them!!   Our check came up to 300 with drinks and everything a little bit expensive but worth it!!!   I also forgot!!!! They take pictures and omg very professional pictures! We couldn't resist so we ended up buying them!!!   This place is awesome!! If you go to Las Vegas you must go here!!!'n the atmosphere is very good!!!!",

    "text": "To be fair, the view, as well as the ability to see all 360 degrees of it was fantastic. The rest was, at best, kinda so so. Walking through the smoky, dingy casino to get to elevator was less than enjoyable.   They started by bringing a bread basket to the table. It consisted of flatbread, which was fine, and cold, dense orange flavored, elementary school style rolls, which were horrible. In an alleged fine dining establishment, that was a big turn off.   My husband had the lobster bisque to start, and I can't say it was great. Thin, and a bit fishy tasting, not the rich, robustly flavored concoction we have had at other places.   The menu is pretty pedestrian. When in doubt, I don't push it, go for something simple, like a steak. I ordered the ribeye. After telling the waiter how I liked my steak, he strongly suggested I order it medium rare. Unfortunately, it came out medium. To his credit, he saw that I was not pleased and insisted on bringing me another one, cooked rare, which was perfect.   On the plate with the steak were two carrots. I ordered the steamed broccolini with mushrooms as a side. It was bland and the mushrooms just tasted wet and soggy. My husband had the filet and a twice baked potato. The steak was ok, not fabulous, and the potato was pretty dry and awful. We had the tiramisu for dessert. It wasn't tiramisu by any definition that I would recognize, but wasn't terrible. With tip and half bottle of red wine we were out a little over $300. For that kind of money there are a thousand other way better places. Again, we enjoyed the experience and were glad we had done it, but do not feel the need to go again.",

    "text": "My boyfriend surprised me and took me here on a Monday for date night. We sat right by the window and we were rotating. It was a cool experience. One minute we can see the strip, the next we can see the Golden Nugget casino in downtown. I ordered the Mango Madness for my alcoholic drink and I loved it. I could drink this more often! My boyfriend ordered the tasting menu with the steak, salad, pork belly and we got cream brulee with dark chocolate for dessert. I also ordered the sea bass for myself but my boyfriend and I love to share so we did try every dish together. I loved the salad. It was refreshing and just enough salad dressing. The tomatoes were yummy in it. The pork belly was so tender and juicy. Loved it. I didn't care for the crispy part in the pork belly dish. It was added for texture I guess. My sea bass was absolutely delicious and cooked perfectly. Our server said the kitchen gave me an extra piece of fish and she didn't know why. I was like ok great lol. I let my boyfriend try my sea bass and he loved it! And he's not a fish guy but he finished that fish quick. I really enjoyed my dish. He got steak and shrimp with string beans. I tried his steak and it was tender and delicious as well.  He ordered a glass of Riesling for his alcoholic drink. Our dessert was amazing. I loved the cream brulee and the chocolate that came with it. So good! I also ordered another dessert which was white cake with cream and fruit. It was served in a glass and it was good but I prefer the cream brulee. We went to the Skyfall lounge after dinner for some drinks. It was right on top of the dinner place. Don't forget to go look at the observation deck. It is very pretty!",

The woman in front of us checked her very large pocket knife at the metal detector and asked if she should check her necklace which had a little silver colored gun on it as well. Our elevator guy was friendly and that helped. Had reservations but they sat us away from the view. When asked if we could get a table closer we were told no that people were waiting in the lounge for tables . They then sat a couple who rode the elevator with us and had no reservations at the table with the view. The steak was good but not remarkable. Vegetables were swimming in sauces and cheese and pretty gross. Our waiter though was absolutely delightful and between him and the elevator guy, alone earned this restaurant the only stars given in this review.  Hope they both get jobs at one of the high end restaurants in town",

    "text": "20th Anniversary Dinner Review 4/24/16  WHY WE LOVED IT  ROMANTIC, Romantic, romantic! I did not want the night of our 20th anniversary dinner celebration to end! Fantastic million-dollar views, romantic atmosphere, great service, and delicious food. What more could you ask for? A MUST for a special one-of-a-kind experience in Las Vegas!   I'll start off my review by saying that OUR SERVER, DANA G., WAS FANTASTIC! With higher-end restaurants, your server can either help make or break your experience. It was our first time dining at the Top of the World on this Sunday night and Dana helped to ensure that our 20th anniversary dining experience was absolutely five stars!  SERVICE: THANK YOU, DANA! From the couple in California who flew out to to Vegas to celebrate their 20th anniversary. I dropped my cloth napkin a few times off my lap and lost them while the restaurant revolved. Dana always got me a new one. I took a hundred photos, not satisfied with any of them because the restaurant had dimmer lighting for some romantic atmosphere. You offered to take a couple of camera shots for us and the photos came out fantastic! (We also bought some professional pics). You made great menu suggestions. I also want to mention that you didn't automatically steer us to the most expensive items on the menu (like some servers do, to get a bigger tip on percentage), but gave a range of mid-price suggestions. You were always smiling. You were genuine, happy, positive, super helpful, and that made all the difference in our visit.   VIEWS: 360-views in the revolving restaurant. Our dinner was at 7:30 pm on a Sunday night. We saw the glittering lights of the strip, the city, bungee jumpers, and helicopters touring tourists everywhere. Spectacular!  RESERVATIONS: We were about 20 minutes late arriving for our reservation. We called ahead to let them know. It's a long walk from the front of the Stratosphere where our cab dropped us off, through the hotel, and all the way up to find the entrance of the restaurant. You'll also go through a security gate/metal detector. We were willing to wait about 15-20 minutes for a window table, which was very much well worth it!   LOUNGE AND OBSERVATION DECK: Make sure you visit the Sky Lounge Bar on the 107th floor. The restaurant is on the 106th floor. The Outdoor Observation Deck is on the 108th floor. Don't miss any of it - breathtaking!   Interesting note: The elevator travels up at 21 miles per hour!   DINNER: Our dinner was served with assorted artisan bread.  JUMBO PRAWNS SHRIMP COCKTAIL WITH GULF PRAWNS AND COCKTAIL SAUCE $17 - served in a bowl. Yum! I was very happy with my jumbo prawns (see pics of food).   LOBSTER BISQUE $13 - creamy and delicious. My husband's choice - I tried his lobster bisque and wanted to steal it away from him.   SURF AND TURF LOBSTER TAIL WITH FILET MIGNON $79  - I went all out for my anniversary and ordered exactly what I wanted. THE BIGGEST LOBSTER TAIL I'VE EVER HAD! A 9 0z. tender filet mignon, a lobster tail served on a bed of spaghetti squash, and roasted vegetables. If you are into lobster and steak, GET THIS.  ORGANIC FREE-RANGE HALF ROASTED CHICKEN $44 - organic free-range half roasted chicken with bacon, mushrooms, and creme fraiche demi glace. My husband's choice. I tried this and it was absolutely delicious.   Dessert - we were really full by dessert time. On the house, we were given a warm chocolate lava cake with fresh berries for our anniversary and it was very good.   COST: With tax and tip, our anniversary dinner was about $190. Well worth it for this special occasion.   FIRST TIMERS - WOULD WE GO BACK? - YES! It was a beautiful dinner experience. We're thinking about bringing our children with us next time because they would love the view and being up 106 stories in the air during dinner. Our server Dana mentioned that they do have kids meals there for $14. Since they are well behaved at restaurants, we just may take them with us next time. I would like to try the Seafood Platter on our next visit!  We look forward to the next time that we go to Top of the World!",

Not so much. We've had a better steak/seafood experience at chains or other restaurants on the strip like Joe's Stone Crab for example. Just not worth the price.. They should really update the decor as well :(",

It is a week later and I am still livid, seething even, in response to her incredible rudeness.  I complained to the manager about her of course, she seemed like a nice person, but insipid and impotent. I am sure she won't even talk to Roxanne about her attitude.  The food is nice at Stratosphere, the view is great, but they really need to sort out their check-in staff. I could not enjoy my meal there at all after the rudeness of Roxanne.",

I ordered the 16 oz. rib-eye ($54) with a 1/2 lb lobster tail ($26) and an added foie gras ($10).   -Rib-eye: soft but a little too fatty (and I like the fat on my meat) -Foie gras: small (what can you expect for $10) and good but nothing special.  A little too much liver tang in the flavor -Lobster tail: NO NO NO.  It was just completely wrong -- the flavor and the texture were just off.  One of the driest lobsters I've had.  As for the service.....well, it took nearly 20 minutes for someone to come around.  Then another 40 minutes for the food to come out.  And another 15 minutes at the end of our meal to get the Snoot face.    A cool part of the experience to note, however, is that the restaurant rotates very slowly so diners can partake in the \"360\" view.  The sudden awareness that the room was spinning gave me a split second feeling of drunkenness..until I realized that the room was actually spinning.    Overall, romantic ambiance.  Next time, I'm just going to hang out at the lounge upstairs after dinner elsewhere.  Same view and ambiance but better service.",

    "text": "I took my girlfriend to Vegas to celebrate her graduation and chose Top of the World for the celebration dinner. However, our waiter treated us very bizarre. First he forgot our wine, which can happen from time to time and frankly was not a big deal. But when we asked him about the soup of the day, he replied with \"I do not know, I think it is some kind of vegetable.\" Again, forgetting something after a long evening is understandable so we politely asked him to confirm what exactly it was. To his credit, he did. My girlfriend and I are extremely lactose intolerant and when the bread and butter was brought, he politely offered us olive oil and vinegar, which we accepted. However, when we brought it back, he went to us and I quote \"you guys know how to mix this right?\" Of course we know how to mix olive oil and vinegar but just to have been asked that question, especially at a restaurant like Top of the World, I was speechless.   Also, the food took quite a long time and because of the disappointing service, we frankly were not confident that it was dairy free. We asked the person who brought the food, which confirmed it but after looking at the Brussels Sprouts, we did not feel confident they were dairy free and did not eat them. The food that we did eat was very good and I do want to point out that the bus boy, whose name I did not get was incredible and I wish I could of tipped him directly.   I did ask to speak to the manager, who I did not get his name but relayed our concerns. The waiter than came back to talk to us and said it was \"misunderstanding,\" which clearly it was not. We ordered wine and did not receive it, we received horrible service and then we were offered free dessert. A very kind offer, except being lactose intolerant, neither of us can eat it.   So after all of this, we paid full price. Now the money is not the concern. I know the prices at Top of the World and was happily expecting to pay what I did, but I expected top-notch service, which I did not receive.   In closing, as someone who visits Vegas on a consistent basis, I am having real reservations about ever coming back to Top of the World and also having second thoughts about referring it as well.  I truly hope the service improves because at its best, Top of the World is one of the best restaurants in Vegas.",

We had the the fresh seafood appetizer ( gulf shrimp, fresh oysters, tuna poke, Alaska king crab, and lobster in a cocktail sauce, and the porterhouse was tender, excellent choice. I came here under the suggestion of a friend and he was right. Only thing is you need to be taxied in, I wouldn't suggest walking around this area at night.",

When enter, they check like it's airport security. surprised. Waiting for the elevator take a while, good 5-10min per elevator which hold 6-8 people. Elevator seems a bit old, but does the trick. When arrived we were told to wait on floor 107 until called upon.  The restaurant spin around the tower at a slow paste of 4ft/min. Occasionally we see bungee jumper hanging outside, since they jump from a higher floor.  We ask the waiter to take picture for us, since we have our own camera. He didn't seems too happy about it, the picture came out blurry. eh...  Food is good but expensive. Expect to pay $90/person.  Overall, do it for a one time experience.",

    "text": "Valentine's evening 2013, my wonderful husband surprised me with dinner at this restaurant as we had never been to either the Stratosphere or the restaurant before. I was so looking forward to a wonderful evening with one of my bestest friends and my wonderful husband. Unfortunately the experience as a whole left a bad taste in my mouth. It was a combination of the Management of the facility as well as another diner in the restaurant that honestly I wish I was able to confront for ruining such a wonderful evening.  Without letting that situation put a bias on my review of their food, it was mediocre at best and seriously over-priced for what we had tried to consume before being rudely interupted by the manager. It seems that one of the other diners near us were offended by our laughter and enjoyment, enthusiasm for being together, and certain words that were spoken at my table. The manager then approached our table, looked at me directly and asked that we refrain from these activities immediately. Now please keep in mind I spent well over 200 dollars for dinner and had not even been served as yet. I promptly requested to know whom had made such a request of us, as I intended to embarass and humiliate them as they had done to me. Maybe not the best approach but honestly - who in their right mind is so narcassistic to believe that they are allowed to go out in Public then mandate that the Public behave in the way they deem they should? If you are so easily offended by others, stay at home and don't ever leave.  Back to dinner, I gathered my things, my 25 dollar valentine's day dinner picture, my BFF and left my husband to deal with getting our dinner to go. We had split some of the meal with my friend so he had 2 cards and some cash he wanted to give towards the dinner with the intent of giving cash to the waitress after the transaction as a tip (we prefer tipping in cash as we believe the servers are not taxed on this and get to keep more of it - if that makes sense). I am not real clear on what the cash portion my husband provided was for as I think he had wanted to get change from it but it seems the waitress took it upon herself not to return 20 dollars of that cash. Funny, she was going to receive a much larger tip than 20 dollars as she was excellent, it was her manager that was the jerk, but just taking the money and not returning it, allowed us to assume thats all she thought she deserved and we did not offer anything more.   All in all, as I indicated, the food really wasn't all that compared to other places we have been to with similar offerings. The price was not fitting of the quality of food, the service was excellent but that last little action was uncalled for. The manager needs a class in people skills and the only real redeeming quality this place has is that it sits at the top of the Stratosphere, spins and provides a nice view of the strip when your table finally gets there. If it was just an observation deck with a bar it could have been a much better place to go. Overall I was pretty bummed that this place seems to get a lot of hype but really is disappointing in the end.",

    "text": "Reading reviews of The Top of the World before I dined here, my biggest fear of this place was the price compared to the quality of the food as some people raved, some people boo'ed.  Yes, we all know the view is the selling point, but why pay quite a bit of money for crappy food?  Well, I'll get to the food, but I feel there's more to speak about to give a better picture of this place.     First off, by all means, I recommend getting there about 75 to 90 minutes or so before sunset to enjoy a bit for the 2 for 1 martinis and the cool, hip music during Happy Hour from 4pm - 7pm.  The hubby and I went to Las Vegas in late February (good time to go IMO), got to The Top at 4:15pm, enjoyed a couple of tasty Mango martinis at the lounge above the restaurant before our reservation at 4:45pm - sunset was at 5:30pm.  Come 4:57pm, our pager for our reservation had not buzzed yet, but that was okay...we figured let's try another 2 for 1 cocktail...this time, we went for the Chocolate martini and BOY was this good!!!!!  And right when we got the Chocolate martinis our pager rang...good timing!    So...we are led to our table by one of the hostesses, and our waiter, Bon, introduces himself.   Both the hostess and Bon were relaxed and unrushed.  We are stunned by the view.  Oh...and the restaurant moves, very slowly, about 80 minutes for one complete 360 degree revolution as mentioned in other reviews.  We found it difficult at times to review the menu and/or to concentrate on the conversation since the view is always changing.  You'll see helicopters flying around, the sunset behind the mountains, the cityscape below you light up as nighttime approaches, and most likely a few thrill seeking vacationers skydiving off the Top of the World (when you have the Las Vegas Blvd. in your view, that's when you see them).   There's also signs posted on the columns warning you when your table is in view of the jumpers...we were lucky enough to have one guy jumping off the plank just when we were under him...my heart beat faster for him, and the gasps of the other diners around you, even though they know it's going to happen, are quite fun.    So how's the food?  We went for the four course tasting menu (currently at this writing for $90).  For the first course, we both went for the lobster bisque.  It was a great choice (but an easy one...this vs. salad???  A no-brainer); very rich and creamy.  Be sure to stir a bit to get that blob of lobster meat mixed into the bisque before eating.  Stellar!  For course # 2, hubby went with the crab cakes which he liked, but I sure enjoyed that seared sea bream with Tamari Brown butter!  So tender, and a nice crunchy skin.  The butter really enhanced the dish.  Course # 3 and 4, there was no choice; the filet, which was perfectly cooked to our liking and melt in your mouth good.  The deserts?  A chocolate mousse and a lovely \"flower\" with blueberries and white chocolate in it (and the flower is edible, too).  Both were exquisite.    We were so impressed with the food!  A real nice treat considering it's pretty easy to assume one is paying for just the view in places like this.  Not to worry about that here.    Some other notes...Bon felt our courses were a bit rushed.   He originally told us that each course will come every 25 minutes.  This wasn't necessarily the case (but I honestly didn't mind all that much).  He told us to take our time and take in the view as much as we wanted before desert, and when we were ready for it, we could let him know.  Nice touch.   When you're done for dinner, do yourself a favor and go up to the inside and outside observation decks.   You will get a good view of the skydivers jumping off on the inside deck, and those other fun looking thrill rides on the outside one.  And one last gander at those great views.    Well worth going to!  Having one of those Amex gift cards to soften the blow of the bill helps.  We're really glad we went.  We don't dine at pricey places often, but sometimes, a little luxury is necessary...especially when one is on vacation, and more so in the life of excess Vegas.  Go ahead and treat yourself and feel like a superstar.  Not to be missed for a fun, novel and tasty dinner in Sin City!",

We ordered:  -oysters -fettucine -surf & turf -mashed yams -green beans -cheesecake lollipops -bread pudding  The food was delicious, I think my favorite was the cheesecake lollipops. They are small bite-sized balls of cheesecake and you can choose what type of dippings you want with it. We chose cookies and cream. So delish. Service was excellent. The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because the decor/ambience is a bit dated. The carpet is older. And of course you have to walk through the Stratosphere to get there, which itself is quite dated. Luckily there were no funky smells, and the view really was quite nice. Considering the cost (in the ball park of $300 without alcohol) and occasion, he and I were both dressed up. Most other patrons were too, although I did see one guy wearing a Lands End sweatshirt and jeans. I'm not sure how enforced the dress code is here. Overall though, an excellent meal. I think it would be in the restaurant's best interest to update the flooring and decor.",

    "text": "Ugh, I ate here on Sunday and I still feel ill just thinking about it.  To begin with, the dining experience is terrible, and I can give five good examples right here.   1. They served a strangely sweet lobster bisque, and then later dumped that same weird-tasting bisque over the Surf and Turf Gnocchi Pasta and attempted to pass it off as \"sauce.\"  Same unappetizing color and flavor.  2. Cold \"house fries.\" Mind you, it was 12:30 pm (lunch) and there weren't that many people. I reason that the fries, at the very least, should've been made fresh for the amount of time it took to get them.  3. The bread and butter were BOTH hard as a rock. The butter must have been right out of the fridge. The bread...probably the same.  4. Vietnamese Banh Mi Sandwich was soggy and mediocre (a word I don't typically use to describe things with pork belly).   5. They serve beverages in tall goblets with long straws, so there's no good way to drink your soda without looking/feeling awkward or having your damn straw fall out of the glass if you move it wrong. It sounds trivial, but this is just annoying to me.   If nothing else, they should at least ditch their \"Voted best gourmet restaurant in Las Vegas\" brag (no sources or dates listed on the website) and embrace the True novelty of the place.   I realize \"you're paying for the view,\" as so many other reviewers have stated. This ought to just become the restaurant's motto. The carnies working the elevators and the skydiving tourists dropping outside the window and interrupting the otherwise beautiful view just don't bring to mind a \"fancy\" restaurant. There's a huge marketing clash here.  I've never written a review in my life, but I think a sub-mediocre experience at any Vegas restaurant with $$$$ as a price range indicator is ammo for heavy scrutiny.",

We had a larger group of about ten people, and to accommodate us they had 2-3 servers come to the table together to take our drink orders, fill water glasses constantly, bring us bread ect. My steak was a New York strip cooked medium rare, exactly as I had asked for. I wasn't too impressed with the asparagus but the potatoes were delicious. And of course, this restaurant has an amazing 360 view of Las Vegas, which is absolutely worth seeing!",

The restaurant is located at the top of Stratosphere Casino and let me say that the view does not disappoint.  We arrived a bit early so we were told to relax at the bar, or observe the observation deck until our name was called.  Omg Best view ever!!!  I reserved a table for myself and my hubby for our 7 year anniversary it was a surprise for him and he was speechless and dumbfounded that a restaurant even rotates!!!  Staff paid attention to detail and customer service, something that goes a long way in our book.  Great job for all the staff at Top Of The World for Making our night truly a night to remember!!",

    "text": "I really love this restaurant! This was my third time. Now, first off, the first thing that I didn't like was the absence of the three different butters that they used to have. Now, it's this maple butter that neither one of us liked. But, our waiter did bring us regular butter which helped the situation. The lavash and the other bread were both delicious. I started off with a Caramel apple martini which was pretty good. But, it was a little more bitter and less sweet. For my second martini, I got my usual lemon drop and it was perfection. Our entrees were delicious. I had gotten the lobster Thermidor the first two times so this time I got the filet mignon and the lobster Thermidor. I have to say, the lobster Thermidor was more like just Lobster on a tail then the actual Thermidor, but it was still rather good. And the fillet mignon was broiled to perfection. He got the filet mignon with the shrimp scampi. Both of our entrees came with mashed potatoes and vegetables that were also delicious. He got the chef's tasting menu. And, the lobster bisque he loved, but the scallop was just one tiny scallop. He shared it with me but it was just one. I thought there would be at least two or three. Also, for dessert, it was a creme brulee and I believe a chocolate mousse that came with his chef's tasting menu and it was tiny also. Barely enough to share, barely enough for one. All in all, I still give this restaurant a 4. The food was rather good and the views are breathtaking. Afterwords, we did go to the observation deck inside and out and took spectacular pictures! WThe restaurant slowly rotated all around & we saw breathtaking views of Vegas in all it's glory!",

I love to eat and I love an experience and when I'm about to spend $250+ on a meal with my lady, I have some expectations about the quality of the food, the quality and selection of spirits, the ambiance and the service.  It is obvious that you pay for the view which, by the way, is amazing.  It really is spectacular....that's pretty much all about this restaurant that's worth the money.  The menu is limited and if you aren't in the mood for steak, well, good luck.  Yes there are non-steak options but it is limited.  The bread is even so-so.  When I'm paying $70+ for an a la carte entre and the bread is meh...it doesn't set the rest of the expectation up to be very high.  Got the 4 course meal because it seemed like the best potential deal.  The lobster bisque was decent but didn't have a ton of lobster flavor.  The pasta noodles were actually really good but the sauce and meat really just tasted like something you'd get at a chain restaurant.  The shrimp was over cooked and under seasoned and the salmon was bland and anti-climactic.  $300.  Never going back but am glad I did the touristy thing and saw the amazing view.  The view is awesome and was worth it....once.",

The waiter and manager did not even apologize when we brought it up. Again the view was amazing but don't expect anything from the food, and the service was not only slow but almost nonexistent.",

Also went above and beyond with our multiple requests to take our pictures of the group with the view behind us.   1 Star for the hostesses system, not particularly to any specific hostess, but to the system that the restaurant has.  We booked a party of 10 and paid the deposit.   We arrived 15-20 mins after our reservation (we also called saying we were late) and the hostess said they gave up our table.   The restaurant should take the initiative and make a phone call to the reservation and ask to see what the status is. Instead of marking us a no show and giving the table up.   Especially in a place like this, definitely need to call first.  Ive spent over a decade working in multiple restaurants of many styles and we also have hostesses call reservations before giving up the table.  It was a good that the manager Paolo who gave us a free first round because the night did not start off well.",

We tried the Chef's Tasting Menu:  - Lobster bisque: the lobster came in a bowl and the waiter pours the bisque of stock, brandy, and cream in front of you at the table. I enjoyed eating that chunk of lobster and slurping up every last drop of the bisque. It was even better dipping the complimentary bread into the bisque.  - Maine scallops a la Plancha: Perfectly cooked scallops with a delicious glaze and sweet potato puree. This may have been my favorite dish.   - Grilled portobello mushroom: Well-cooked and seasoned.   - Filet mignon and shrimp scampi: filet mignon was juicy, tender, and delicious and the mashed potatoes paired nicely with it.  - Salmon with basil pesto crust and prawns: Well-cooked salmon and juicy. The haricot verts was delicious, as well.   - Duet plate: ** Thank you, Top of the World, for adding on the candles and a \"Happy Anniversary\" chocolate sign to this plate. Such a considerate and thoughtful gift! It was the perfect finish for a very romantic and beautiful dinner.   Note: If you have motion sickness like me, you may have a difficult time looking at the 360 degree view. However, I found that you can buy SeaBands at any CVS/pharmacy and it works like a charm!  Tip: Go to the observation rooftop after dinner! I kid you not, it is one of the most beautiful city views I've ever seen! And, I'm saying that after having visited the famous city views at NYC, Seattle, Hong Kong, Chicago, Taiwan, Los Angeles, etc.",

    "text": "Here lies one of the perennial questions, does one give a notable establishment the five star review without being blinded by the view?  Let's defrag.   One or two stars can easily be dropped on the ambience/view itself, because who the hell wouldn't wanna dine over sin city in rotating fashion am I right?   Our server of the night was a gentleman by the name of Jeff. His impeccable service was seamless throughout our experience. You could take apart this man but he would only come back with an even more polished, professional answer to whatever your questions or needs may be.  The sommelier and servers were all kind and attentive to your needs. No question of professionalism displayed.   Food: We skipped on starters as we didn't feel too hungry. Otherwise I would've loved to try their lobster bisque.  Notes: The bread served on the side was not a favourite of mine personally, could have given more butter. Also a personal preference. Lol.   We both had the grass fed wagyu ribeye. My fiance had medium with the blue cheese and I had mine plain, medium rare. Usually when dining for the first time at any establishment I like to have mine sans sauce to really get into the flavour and texture of the meat.   The meat was done exactly the way we both wanted, seasoned well and the beef was of good, fresh quality. We both had the mushrooms as a side. Very generic side, nothing to shout about.   Dessert: We had their 21 layer chocolate cake. Am cut throat about chocolate cake so I have to say this was disappointing. Although I'm sure it pleases the masses aesthetically it was at best average in taste. Perhaps one should try the creme brulee instead.   All in all, bill came up to about 400 with a bottle of wine (we had the chateauneuf du pape, fantastic) and tips. Very worthy of a special occasion.   Summary: Will shave off one star for dessert. Otherwise it's a great way to spend a special occasion or spoil a loved one.",

    "text": "In town for our 13th wedding anniversary and the renewal of our vows, we decided to take a trip to the \"Top of the World\". We arrived about a half hour early for our reservation, so we stepped upstairs to the lounge of a pre-dinner drink. This was just the beginning of what would be a stellar evening for us.   Back downstairs to head to our table, the hostess was very personable as she led us to our table. She dropped us off at a lovely table for two right up against the window, and turned us over to our server, Eric. For the rest of the evening, we were in his very capable hands. His personal recommendations were compelling enough for us both to take his advice on the Ribeye. We shared a couple of sides as well as a beautifully complementary bottle of wine - all great choices!   The service, food, and views were all absolutely perfect! Our only gripe is that a number of our fellow patrons did not give this experience the respect it deserves. Gentlemen, when you come to a restaurant like this, please leave the shorts and tennis shoes at home (seriously, would a dinner jacket kill you?). Moms - teach your kids the value of dressing up once in awhile. Just because you're on vacation, doesn't mean you and your precious angels need to go to every meal dressed like you just got out of the pool. OK - enough of that - I'm off my soap box now.  All in all, we couldn't have been more pleased. Arrived before sunset, watched the sun disappear behind the mountains, then watched the lights of Las Vegas come up in full bloom. Food, wine, and service were truly impeccable. This was an unforgettable experience, and we wholeheartedly recommend you take a trip to the \"Top of the World\"!",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I recently came here for our anniversary.  We were able to make reservations the same day, when we arrived we were directed towards a separate entrance so that we didn't have to wait in the same line as everyone just going to the observation deck.  The elevator brought us to the top super quick, I think they said it's the worlds fastest double-decker elevator.  The restaurant itself is super cool, it looks a little dated but the best part is that the whole restaurant rotates, we were there about an hour and it did one full rotations, so we got to see the whole city.  The staff was very nice and accommodating.  My boyfriend went with the lunch chef's tasting menu and I got the dinner chef's tasting menu.  We both got the wine option as well, which included a different wine that paired with each course.  The first course, we had the option of soup or salad and we both got the lobster bisque.  It was the most amazing soup that either of us had ever had.  There was a bread basket that came with it and the bread was alright but the herb butter made it great.  The next course which was only included with my meal, was a roasted mushroom with pesto and some kind of cheese, which was so good!  The next course was the main, his included a petite fillet and lobster tail, mine was pesto salmon with shrimp (the shrimp were huge), the polenta that accompanied it was probably the most amazing thing I have ever eaten.  Next was desert, I wasn't crazy about the wine that came with it but the chocolate mousse and creme brule was so good!  Our bill was around 200, so if you are looking for a special occasion dinner, this would be a good choice, even for a local!",

The steak that was suggested to me the \"Kobe Ribeye Special\" wasn't special at all.  Service was horrendous.  It took me 25 min after sitting down to get a gingerale. After our meal came and we had finished and our plates were cleared it took 30 min to get the check. Just unacceptable.  -As long as you realize this restaurant only exists because it's 800 feet in the air and your paying \"fine dining\" prices only because of the views you won't be disappointed.  If your looking for good food and good service don't come here.",

    "text": "This restaurant spins probably just to keep you so dizzy that you cannot look at your egregious bill and bland food.   All in all, unimpressive. Food completely lacks any finesse. It's edible, but that's about it.  Finished the meal wishing that I spent the $160 bill gambling downstairs instead.  Here's the punchline: food was mediocre, service sub-par, wifi-bereft, bill atrocious, people rude, view sleep-inducing.   The view is very dull. Since the stratosphere is a bit removed from the Strip, all you can see is the suburbs. I was basically getting the same view from the restaurant as from my hotel room. I cannot believe people would actually pay to go up to the stratosphere.   Poor service, with overbearing servers. I was slowly eating my salad and with at least 1/4 of the salad left when the server came over and rushed me to finish as my entree was apparently ready.   Please, who do you think you are. In case it was not clear already, I am paying to eat here. I should feel comfortable eating at whatever pace I want, especially when I was only 10 minutes into my salad.   My server was also staring down on my bill the whole time I was trying to foot the bill.    Reservations said that dress was business casual but I definitely saw a bunch of people in sneakers and flipflops.   Must I say that the small details matter as well. I really disliked how the gave us pink Splendex packets for sugar instead of real sugar in a nice jar. This is not a college cafeteria.   Finally, the food. Bread was dry and disgusting, no thought given to it at all. Dessert was overly saccharine and creme brulee was limp. My entree of shrimp and lobster was alright, but the sriracha cream sauce was just really weird. The only highlight of the meal was the salad, so essentially we paid $160 for two salads.   Probably one of the worst decisions I made on this Vegas weekend trip, and being in Vegas that really says something.",

Went there back in March 2012 for dinner for 5 people and it was great!  Meal was $88 for a 4-course dinner, not including drinks. I booked thru Open Table and had a coupon ... and when we showed up there, everything was in order and we were whisked away to our table.  Server was very pleasant and attentive.   After eating you can check out the rides on the top of the tower, and an observation area with telescopes.   Only drag (3-stars) is that the elevators are strategically placed at the end of a long walk thru the casino & shopping areas ... so if you have older folks who are not able to walk quickly or for long distances, might want to consider adding extra time (15-20 minutes) or even a wheel chair.  So 5-star for the service & ambience, 4-star for the food.",

    "text": "My husband and I were on this past Friday night for dinner and what an experience. It was a bummer at first we were advised the restaurant wasn't going to be turning because of maintenance but eh we continued with our plans anyways. We shared the Chefs Taste Menu and paired it with wine, we enjoyed the lobster bisque and the steak dish lastly the dessert, mmm creme brulee super good but the pork belly dish wasn't anything special. After about 30 mins into our dining the restaurant began to move, yes!!! so then we were even more happy that it started to work after all. The view is breathtaking, very romantic environment. The Sky Lounge is above you so its not super quiet in there you can hear the drinkers around you but it was all good again we are in Vegas and everyone is here to have a great time. A lady came around to take photos which we knew we would have to buy afterwards but eh we did it anyways. Of course when she came back around they were an arm and a leg. really $49 or so for 2 5x7 photos hahaha no thank you. One thing I would suggest is to make that price more reasonable and you will have everyone buying their photos! What were they going to do with my photos anyways after the fact? Throw them away :( The photos did come out very good and it was hard to resist but for that price no thanks we will use our iphones...  OVERALL:  Food-Excellent!!!  Experience - Excellent I will definitely recommend for any couples Service - Excellent, he explained the entire menu we requested window seats but didn't get window seats, another couple finished and because our server was so great he found a way to move us to the window seat... happy camper again at that point. :)  I am recommending this to all of my friends who love experiencing new restaurants and eateries with a little more class :) Get dresses up feel beautiful, enjoy the view and go with a significant other. Love is in the air here. At least its how it made my husband and I feel.",

I've never been to a restaurant that doesn't at least bring a small desert with a candle for someone's Birthday. Even cheap restaurants do that. I was disappointed and so was my husband. We spent $200 and another $45 for pictures and they didn't even bring a small desert. Terrible",

The atmosphere is lovely, staff friendly, casual attire, beautiful scenery... on top of Las Vegas.   Food was presented beautifully, and in a timely manner, and the drinks were great.  It's hard to honestly give it a True \"honest\" review, because I hadn't seen my friend in over a year, so we had lots of catching up to do, so much of my focus wasn't primarily on the food, or scenery.  Although what I do recall about the experience was that it was delicious food, very attentive staff... and regardless of where we were seated, it was a good view.  Worthy of my friend calling this his favorite place in LV...  :)",

    "text": "They ruined our anniversary! I had made reservations three weeks ago for me and my wife as this was our third year anniversary. There was only one thing that my wife wanted, a table on the outside. The person making the reservation said that they put notes on our reservation so that they knew when the time came, there would be a seat for us. Come three weeks later, today, my wife and I show up as this is something we have never done and I wanted it to be special. They seat us furthest in the dining area, where the view was limited. I spoke with the waiter who was seating us about our  reservation and how I requested a window seat. She basically said just because you ask doesn't mean you will get it. So what is the point of even having us make that request if we have no say in it?! We noticed that there was another table that had the view we wanted that was not taken. We then asked another waiter about the seat and we were told that the seat was taken by another person waiting for a window seat in which there was a hour long line for. WHY THE HECK WERE WE NOT TOLD ABOUT THIS WHEN I REQUESTED THREE WEEKS AGO FOR THE WINDOW TABLE?! Having dinner ruined, they told us they could not give us a seat by the window and said we could go view their observation deck free of charge. Normally there is a cost to go up if you are not going to dinner. I would have never accepted that offer if I had known it would take over half an hour just to get back down! Because of that, the other restaurant I was considering had already closed. The only good thing I got out of this is knowing to never go back there again.",

My low rating is due to their customer service. With the exception of our waitress, the hostess and even the manager of the restaurant made us feel like we needed to leave once we were done. My friends and I went to walk around the restaurant once we were done with dinner and the manager told us we were not allowed to just walk around and asked us to leave. Horrible customer service! After spending a considerable amount of money on dinner, they just want you out. Other than the views, I don't recommend this restaurant for its food and customer service. It's not worth the money with their customer service!",

He was cracking jokes with us and explained the menu when we had questions. Our waters were always filled thanks to another guy working with our server.   As far as food goes, overall was okay. I ordered the 16 oz ribeye and got it medium well. I would have to say it was a little dry and not really worth the price. My boyfriend got the skirt steak and that had lots of oil and too much sauce, but if you're a sauce person then it would be great for you! We ordered a side of mashed potatoes and they were the BEST potatoes I've ever had in my life. It was fantastic. For dessert, we got the first two on the dessert menu (cannot recall what they were named) but it was mediocre. It was cute for them to put \"Happy Anniversary\" on our dessert!  The place has a great view. The restaurant does spin. My boyfriend got a little dizzy so we had to switch seats. He was sitting facing a certain way so he was turning backwards. When I sat where he sat, I was fine. I didn't feel dizzy. We also got to see the sky jumpers who jump from the top of the Stratosphere! It was so cool!",

I read the reviews about it and how it rotates around at a slow pace so you can get a view of the Las Vegas strip. I loved the atmosphere and how classy it was. It does rotate at a very slow speed so you almost can't tell you're moving.  We ordered the Caesar salad for an appetizer as well as another dish which basically was raw beef. I like to explore my palate and although I can finally say I tried raw beef, I'm not a huge fan of it and won't be ordering again. For dinner, I had the seared orange miso glazed 56 Chilean sea bass ($56). For the sides we ordered the roasted baby carrot with lemon honey-glaze  ($12) and the twice baked potato, bacon, cheddar, green onion ($14). It was all delicious! They also have ppl that come around and will take pictures of you and your group. The pictures run from $60-$100. The tables are a bit tiny for my liking. Also we didn't get seat near the window which was disappointing. The seats where we sat didn't have much privacy. My overall experience here was good - from making the reservation, the time I walked in and saw the view, being greeted by the wait staff, the ambience, and the sight of the city.",

Our first day in Vegas, staying at the Stratosphere, we decided to do lunch at this restaurant and get it out of our system.  We also opted to do lunch here over dinner figuring that we'd get a better price for lunch, and I believe we were right.  The view was incredible, however if you're not looking out over the strip, it is a bit boring and drab.  It's a desert, after all.  The most amusing part of the view was when the rides on the top hung over and we could see the people on the Insanity... which was humorous alone since I noted to my companion \"you'd have to be INSANE to go on that\" before I knew the ride was actually titled Insanity.    The food was very good.  As I said, the best Alfredo sauce ever.  And the chicken breasts on top were cooked to absolute perfection... I actually enjoyed the chicken more than the fettuccine.  I also ordered the Fromage du Jour from the drinks/dessert/appetizer menu, which I have to say I was a bit disappointed from.  The cheeses were Mozzarella, which was excellent, a Parmesan, which you can't really eat alone but worked great to crumble over my pasta, and a Reggiano which smelled like ASS and almost turned my stomach.  It tasted no better than it smelled either.  There was also some sort of compote on the plate that tainted some of the cheese and fruit.    I guess if I'd liked the compote it wouldn't have tainted anything, but I didn't care for it.  All in all the price wasn't too extravagant, but we did get one of the cheapest dishes on the menu at $14.  The staff was nice, the atmosphere incredible, so it's worth the 4 stars.",

The first New Year's I spent here, there was an amazing buffet (the levels below the lounge, I believe). The tables were decorated with elegant ice sculptures, and there were tables of seafood, fondue, and other fine foods. The food was delicious.  The lounge is a great place to spend New Year's. Everyone gets all dressed up, and you're away from all the crazy party people down by the strip. You get the best view of the New Year's fireworks from up top.  It's a place to go at least once in your life...",

    "text": "I had dinner here for my birthday.  My entire experience with this restaurant was absolutely positive.  The host was very nice, informative, and accommodating.  We were able to sit next to a window, which had an amazing view of the city.  Do note that the view of the strip is limited, but you get a 360 degree view of the city of Las Vegas (the restaurant spins - slowly).  The waiter was very friendly, attentive, and prompt with bringing us our drinks.  I ordered grilled organic chicken, which was very tender and succulent.  My boyfriend ordered the steak, and he said it was the best steak he has ever had - very tender and juicy.  There was an item that I didn't personally like, and I was surprised that (what I think was) the manager came out to check on us.  That just shows they really care about the customer's experience.  I would definitely recommend this restaurant, and I would definitely come back again.",

    "text": "Aw man, this place could get five stars for the view alone. Even though I've been to Vegas a number of times over the past ten years or so, I've never been up to the top of the Stratosphere. Having dinner at the \"Top of the World\" is an experience you have to try at least once if you go to Vegas, and could quite possibly be voted \"Most Romantic Dining Spot\" in Vegas if it hasn't already been voted that.  Having said all that, dinner comes second to the spectacular views of the city that you get from being that high. Yeah sure, you could go down the road and experience something similar with the Eiffel Tower Experience, but 1) the Eiffel Tower isn't that high and 2) you're still outdoors and subject to the elements. Whereas if you were to have dinner at Top of the World you have a better 360 degree view and you're indoors in climate controlled A/C.  My grandma actually took me out to dinner here so she knew the whole procedure for getting the most out of our experience. She made our reservations for just the right time, early evening, just before the sun started to set. That way as we ate the sun would set and we could see the city both in daylight (before we ate) and at night (by the end of our meal). She also said that when you make reservations and again when you show up, you have to specifically ask to be seated next to the window in order to get a window table (which are the tables with the best views). Otherwise if you don't say anything they seat you on the inside tables instead.  With pretty much everything set for perfect viewing we enjoyed a great natural show as the city came to life at night with all the lights as we enjoyed our dinner. Now I guess on to the food portion of my experience?  I got a New York Strip steak which was pretty good. I was also able to taste the fillet mignon with a really great sauce. However, probably what stood out from the whole dish was my side order of potato au gratin. Man it was so cheesy and creamy. Very tasty. The food didn't fail to disappoint. The prices are a little higher than what I'm used to, but then again and usually don't eat at high-end restaurants to often. I didn't think the prices were outrageous though. No shorts and t-shirts here either. You gotta dress it up at least a little bit.  Can't say enough about that view. Pretty surreal and amazing.",

My boyfriend had made reservation with this restaurants months before our trip to Vegas. It was a surprise,  I did not know which restaurant he was going to take me out to. But when we got to the Stratosphere hotel, we had to find the entrance & elevator to get to the top of the tower (106th floor). oh my, was it amazing. The restaurant rotates in a complete circle in 2 hours (we were there for 3 hours). We got there at 6pm and ordered the Kobe beef for appetizer. it  was SO SO delicious! I have never tried thinly sliced raw beef that tasted as good as this place! Our entree came when the sun was setting and our dessert ( creme brulee, my favorite) came when it was already dark.  The view here is so pretty. I loved how it is all glass window so you get to view the entire Vegas, the strip, and the city lights as you are eating.I was speechless that my bf took me here. They also have a photographer who walks around & takes very nice pictures of you & your party. me & my  bf bought them for $60. it was worth it! Our dinner cost $200. reasonable price for such a romantic and beautiful dinner with wonderful food.",

The 3-course lunch was pretty cheap ($35). However, my prosciutto wrapped salmon dish was only mediocre. It was a little dry, the prosciutto was hard, but the pear + Beurre blanc sauce was a pretty good match w/ the salmon. I did try a little prime rib & I thought it was delicious -- I should have ordered that instead of the salmon! The meat connoisseur I was with said it was \"just okay\".   Overall, the restaurant isn't one of my favorites & I wouldn't choose it all the time even if I did live in Vegas, but for tourists & guests, I think its a great experience.",

While out there his dad treated all of us to dinner there, and boy were we all impressed.  We had a great table right against the glass, so we enjoyed our view the entire time.  Having never been to Vegas before this it was amazing for me to see the strip, and then what surrounded it.  The food was so good, and the dessert was great too.  I forget what it was called but it was an all chocolate mock up of the stratosphere, so that was pretty impressive by itself.  We decided to all go dressed up in suits, although it was not required.  We felt that since we were on vacation and going out to a nice dinner we might as well go all out.",

They also take your credit card info down at the time you make your reservation, because if you cancel and don't give them enough time, they charge your card like $50!  Friends of ours were also in town and decided that Saturday to go eat there.  The only time they got was a 5:30pm time.  They were still there when we arrived for our 6:30pm reservation.  To our dismay, they were seated right by the windows.  We were disapointed as we were seated at a booth as far away from the windows, and right by the walking area / preparation area of the servers.  But as the night went out, we realized we actually had a nice view and didn't have to turn our necks to enjoy it.  And it doesn't rotate as quickly as you'd think, we saw the strip maybe 2 or 3 times the entire time we were there.  We both got steaks, and they were good, nothing outstanding, but I wasn't expecting anything spectacular.  The dessert was amazing though - we got the chocolate Stratosphere with the fruit and it was SO GOOD.  It's worth it to go just for the dessert.  It's a bit of a hike, and you have to go through some sketchy parts of the strip if you walk here, but it's a Vegas \"must go\" if you have the $$$.",

I literally had a meal 2 hours before this, but when I saw the food, I got hungry all over again.  Our dinner started around sunset and the view outside was magnificent. It was so breathtaking.  I love love love love the bread and butter. The different types were a joy to try. My favorite was the orange ginger butter... and it was my group's favorite too!  The entrees were what was expected. I had the pork chops. They were delicious. It was a little dry, but the sauce and fruit made it all better. I tried a bit of the salmon and I suggest that a whole lot more.  We were all so full from the entree that we couldn't fit in dessert, even though they are every small.  Our waitress, Ellen, made the whole experience a lot more welcoming and memorable. She was super friendly and chatted with us from time to time, seeing how we are doing and such. So considerate. She has some interesting stories. hahaha Oh!! When outside looked perfect, she came by and asked us if we wanted a picture with the view. TALK ABOUT AWESOME TO THE MAX SERVICE!!  This place is pricey, but it was one hell of an experience. I'm so glad I tried this.",

A band was playing live on and off during dinner, SADE cover band, it was nice. Take a dramamine motion sickness pill before you go if you get motion sickeness of any kind. I did . This restaurant revoles 360 degress, very cool. You get to see the bungee jumpers fall right at your table when you hit that window....crazy cool. WORTH to budget a NICE ,PRICEY WONDERFUL dinner on your trip to Vegas. **I recommend having lunch instead if dining with family and or kids. The views would be much better than nighttime. As vegas is surrounded by mountains, the view is of the Strip ,street lights a a wall of darkness as there are no lights on the mountains. To see the snow capped mountains in the endless horizon would have been more magical. ***For a Great Photo, just purchase the one from the in house photographer. The lighting and view comes out great and they go mild retouching. ($25-45)  ***I went 12/24 for dinner. I used a coupon from <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FRestaurant.com&s=0aab4cbd731f3d3b0d1453050d3abc56a8c80bd214e25469c7555b750dca8a51\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Restaurant.com</a>  and got $25 of the Bill......",

So needless to say they didn't have much of anything to cater to Vegans. That's not their fault though, just a victim of circumstance. Other than not being able to eat anything. It is a bit pricey but I expected that, however I will not personally be eating here again but I'd recommend those who aren't vegan to go check out the scenery.

Far better than I have had previously.  The crab cake was heavy on crab and flavor.  The filet and lobster were so tender!!! Caesar salad was delicious.  Then.... there was dessert.... my oh my... so good!!!  Will defiantly make a point of visiting there again when we are back in Vegas!!!",

I didn't expect to have much to say about the food and I still don't although the wine list was pretty extensive. You pretty much go there for the view and the food is an extra.  I must say the view is spectacular. And we were lucky that it was a very clear night so we could see everything there was to see.  My 5.5 year old grand nephew, when he looked up from the iPad (which was rarely) was even impressed by it. The fact that every once in while he was able to see the bungee jumpers speed past was very exciting for him.  So in the end I'm very glad we went as it was a singular experience and added a really nice touch to the trip.",

They didn't get us seated until 45 minutes later because they were backed up so we asked if the manager could give us a free drink or a free desert for the two of us celebrating our birthday - Manager did neither. Food arrived late and cold. My wife's steak was medium well when it should have been medium rare so we talked to the GM who made it right.  The issue is mostly timing, I have a limo outside that I'm paying $125 an hour for. I can't be wasting time inside this restaurant, we need to get in and get out just like you need us in and out to flip our table. What should have been a 1.5 hour dinner (max) turned into a 3 hour dinner.  For a restaurant of this potential caliber you would think they would have their stuff together.  Waitress and GM were great.  Im just saying there's better options on the strip.",

    "text": "I was in Vegas and wanted to do something special for my special someone. I had read up on the Top of the World restaurant and thought between the time of year (winter), food and views, that this place would be ideal and romantic.  I had booked my reservation very easily through a website called Open Table via the Top of the World website link. However, I found a place in Vegas that sold discounted tickets and was so excited to take advantage of that. I was able to get 25% off of my entree's for the cost of only $3 per person. Basically I saved $34 for a $6 investment. Keep in mind that this offer is good but it's M-Th only and I did happen to go to the restaurant on a Monday night. The ticket place not only saved me money but also was abe to re-book my reservation for a more convenient time.   So the hotel itself is what I call...ghetto-fab, and it is not located in the best part of Vegas since it is in the Stratosphere. I would only take this experience down a notch because of the location.   We came dressed to impress (they do have a dress code), and we took a private elevator to the top of the Stratosphere to the restaurant entrance.  We got there a little earlier than our reservation time and took advantage of their lounge area.  The lounge had very ambient lighting and was surrounded by amazing night views of the city. The staff were friendly, and the drinks were well made.   When it came time for dinner, we decided on an appetizer and the Surf & Turf.  Everything was amazing. We received an assortment of breads and 3 different types of butter as our pre-appetizer. The butter didn't even taste like butter, it was very delicious!!! The steak cut like butter, the lobster was perfecty cooked, and our appetizer (thinly cut steak, capers, sauce), was so delicious.  We skipped dessert because I was very full from dinner and I hope to try some the next time we go.  We also had our pictures professionaly taken by a photographer who walks around. Prices were somewhat typical but she did a good job and I actually purchased some of the pictures.   The view was amazing and we found ourselves just staring at the city for periods of time.  It was very cold out (November) but we walked around on the inside and watched the crazy people do the Sky Jump off of that floor. Which is, by the way, something you get to see in the restaurant. People dropping off the top ads a different element to your dinner experience.   Overall, it was well worth it (especially after getting the discount coupon), and I highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a nice place to wine and dine.",

    "text": "This place is amazing and I would've gladly given it five stars but here's why I didn't:  We went to Top of The World for my boyfriends birthday 2 weeks ago so I will try and remember everything I ordered. We planned to go here for many months and were really looked forward to it. We ordered the Pork Belly for an appetizer and it was AMAZING. Forgive me if I am wrong but If I remember correctly our servers name was Niki. She was cute as a button. Her service and recommendations were excellent (she should get a raise).   My main course was the Rack of Lamb and it was just exquisite. It was PERFECTLY cooked and melted in my mouth. By far, the best lamb I have EVER had. The lamb was accompanied by couscous with a wasabi style of kick to it and was out of this world. It complimented the lamb perfectly. I even had one of the managers stop at our table to tell me how excited he was that I ordered that because it is among their best dishes and his personal favorite.  My boyfriend ordered the Fillet Mignon and a side of bok choy. I had the privilege to get a taste of both and they were divine. The fillet was perfectly cooked and, again, melted in the mouth. The bok choy was still nicely firm and not overcooked.  The wine: We ordered a bottle of Forefront Cabernet Sauvignon which was the perfect pairing for the lamb and the fillet. Everything was perfect...until I decided to walk over to my boyfriend and wish him a happy birthday in his ear. I briefly sat, respectfully, legs closed on his lap to do this when GEORGE the \"big boss\" of the restaurant quickly comes out of nowhere to tell me to \"get off of his lap because there is an 8 year old child sitting near by.\" REALLY??? What 8 year hasn't seen that! She wasn't even paying any attention to us! He just TOTALLY ruined a perfect night. Not only did he interrupt our sweet meaningful conversation but he embarrassed us without necessity!  Our whole dining experience was perfect until he did that. I feel sorry for the people who have to deal with him with any kind of regularity. This was completely uncalled for, rude, and inexplicable especially for a place of this caliber. Shame on you George, you should know better.",

I think the 360 degrees view of Las Vegas is the \"most expensive\" of this dinner. We had ordered a bowl of lobster bisque and we both thought it was soso. The one at Ventano (Henderson) is much better and cheaper. And then we had an appetizer plater. I remembered there were some kobe beef and duck on it. Kobe beef was okay and we both thought that the duck was really good. We didnt know which part of duck is it but it's like the fat of the duck (not quite sure) but it was good. And then for the entree, i had lamb and it was okay, im a big fan of lamb but it wont make me say \"WOW\".  My boyfriend had ribeye and the outside of the ribeye was kinda overcook, looked dark but he said the inside was okay. (he ordered medium rare). We were full after dinner so I just ordered a single creme burlee as dessert and nothing special about the dessert. I heard that there's something called chocolate tower and was really delicious but i didnt see it in the menu ( maybe i missed it or they didnt have it?? i dunno)  The restaurant will keep moving around so you will be able to see the view of Las Vegas and the view of the strip. Definitely go there at night since the night view is the best. We spent around $220 (include tax and tips) and we wont go back. I think they overprice everything since the food was not very delicious. Once again, the view is the selling point. Maybe you can consider to go to there lounge or just pay few bucks to go to the top.",

The reasonable price is just a bonus. No, I don't work for either place and live, though I visit often, thousands of miles away.",

Our server was not attentive at all, half the time I would have forgotten what she had looked like if it wasnt for her horrific bleached blonde hair [with the roots showing]. We were a party of 4 and she went around assisting her other tables [larger parties] before us so we ended up constantly waiting for service the entire night, which was extremely annoying. She didnt bring out our food or drinks, nor did she refill them. I wanted to tip our her assistant because she was pretty much serving us.    The food was mediocre. I wasnt expecting too much, but to be payin $50-60 for just a steak with no side.. I wanted at least decent.   [+1]  My mood did get better so alrighttttttt.. the view was pretty cool. And we did get a booth facing out. Their butters were the shape of the stratosphere, which was kinda cool.. i guessss. We did end up tipping just 18%, knowing that her assistant would get tip share.",

Everything was going excellent until they seated a family of four with two young children next to us. One child was an infant that kept crying. The second child was maybe two years old and started screaming as soon as he was placed in a high chair. The high chair was one foot directly behind me. The kid never stopped screaming and the parents made no effort to control him. We would have stayed for coffee or desert but I could not stand the constant screaming. I did not pay $200 per person, $800 total to sit 1 foot away from a constant screaming kid. There is supposed to be a dress code but it is not enforced. This family was wearing T-Shirts and shorts. If the dress code was enforced I would not have had my Birthday evening ruined by screaming kids.",

When we arrived, there were plenty of empty tables beside the window but they lied that all were reserved (did not see a single person coming and we were there till close). We ordered the appetizers as we were already full. The waiter was very rude. When we told him that we are not interested in main course his behavior changed and we felt unwelcome. He kept pressurizing us to order some main course though we made it very clear that we were not interested. At that point we felt really uncomfortable and we were in half a mind to leave. Finally the food came. I had lobster bisque and the husband had the pork belly. Both were pretty good. After dinner when the check came i signed and then the waiter took it while we were still sitting there. It seems he wanted us to leave as we did not go for the full course dinner. When we were leaving he even stopped me and verified the tip!!!!! At that point I really wanted to make it zero. Overall food was good but way too pricy and attitude of the servers are proportional to the amount of money you are spending!!!",

Instead of taking a cab to this restaurant I decided to take a walk, sight see and wheel him over.  Keep in mind that I was staying at the Aria in the new City Center.  Omg, it look me over an hr to get there and I was in a very BAD mood.    To my surprises this place was everything I expected.  The food was decent and so were the prices.  We ordered there $30 rita so we could take the souvenir glass home.  I loved every moment that I was there and it was such a romantic setting for us.  We enjoyed the view of Vegas, it was beautiful.  The staff was SUPER friendly.  I also enjoyed seeing people ride the rides at from the top.  We later look our drinks to the observation level.  We spent several hrs there and really did enjoy our self.    Thanks Top of the World for giving me a V-day to remember!!",

What an awesome way to enjoy dinner.  We happened to be dining as the sun was setting, and it was simply gorgeous.  Our waiter was helpful and pleasant, and he made our experience enjoyable.  Another plus was the Baby Frisee Salad with Maytag Blue Cheese and Bacon Lardons.  Sooo fresh and delicious.  After beginning with this salad, I was really looking forward to dinner!  But alas, dinner was the bad part.  I ordered the Seared Organic Salmon with Lemon Grass Beurre Blanc.  Wow, was that salmon strong tasting, and also smelled strongly of fish (isn't that a sign that the fish isn't fresh??).  We also ordered some mashed potatoes to share, and they had developed a crust on top like they were sitting under a heat lamp for a couple of hours.  YUK.  So disappointing.  Also, I wasn't impressed with the cleanliness of the place.  It actually smelled kind of moldy.  Not something I like in a restaurant.",

I like the waiter/waitress to see that my drink is empty and refill it not ask me if I need a refill. I like less talk at a place like this and that is exactly what I get here. That way me and my hubby have a romantic dinner without being interrupted too much. I want to come here every year for my anniversary.  First trip I believe we ordered Filet and lobster bisque nothing out of the ordinary and it was soooo good. The second trip we went for the five course tasting menu, I really wasn't too pleased with a few things I had but next time I will order what I want :)",

I asked if they could make a specific cake for my dinner but they couldn't and referred me to Freed's bakery which did a great job! They were also nice and kind to waive the cake slice fee which they normally have if you don't order dessert from them.  The waiter was ok. He was nice and he was tying his best but he had 3 large parties including ours so he got a few of our orders wrong and we did have a wait a while for our food. But it's ok. Overall he wasn't rude, he came and checked on us as much as he could. So no complaints here, because he was very busy which I completely understand.  The view is gorgeous! It's a revolving restaurant and you can see the strip and downtown. It's an amazing view! It's on the 107th floor. The food was amazing too!! Of course the bill was expensive but you get your monies worth. You also get to go up to the observatory deck for free which normally you'd have to pay to go up.   Definitely will return, maybe I'll try the lunch to see the view during the day too..",

The view was spectacular and you get a 360 view during dinner. The restaurant slowly moves as you enjoy your dinner. The service provided by the waiters were great and they were very attentive.   I ordered the rack of lamb and it was delicious. The lamb basically melts in your mouth and was cooked to perfection. My boyfriend ordered the filet mignon and it was great! They are \"a la carte\" so you would have to order the sides on your own. The lobster mac and cheese was delicious as well.   Overall, I definitely recommend anyone to try this restaurant.

    "text": "DONT GO HERE !!!! Where to begin. I made a reservation couple weeks in advance and explained then that my wife and I live in different countries, it's both our birthdays, and could we please have a window table. There are three categories of tables. Those at the window, those off the window lower level (with the most obstructed view) and those off the window elevated level, so at least you have a good view just further away. There are also two different table sizes. A table that fits 4 and a table that fits 2 - that is a joke. Smallest table I have ever seen   Despite that we requested a window, they sat us at the worst table possible; A small table lower level obstructed view. The table was a few inches bigger then the place mat.   There were however plenty of other tables available both at the window and on the elevated level. So I asked to be moved. The waiter told us that he would have to ask, but that other tables were for other people. I didn't understand this - why wasn't I allowed?  He said that they seat as people arrive. So when I arrived, I got the crappy table available. However, someone who comes later could get the better table, just luck. So I complained...and said \"so you are telling me that people who arrive after me and who are not even in the building yet can have that table by the window, but I can't because I got here already?  Answer:  correct.   I asked him why would someone coming after us get a better table than me but never got any answer except \"I'm sorry, it's all just the timing.\"  Right by us there was an empty table. I asked about moving to that specific table at the window. I was told that they were likely holding it for 4 people since it was bigger, so we couldn't have it. The table I asked to move to was empty for over 30 minutes. Then they seated a couple - 2 people - at the table. Incredible. When I complained how ridiculous this was, I was told that it wasn't his decision and management just gives the tables how they decide. Doesn't matter if it's fair.   My wife ordered lemonade.  It was undrinkable. Switched to a coke. I ordered a mixed drink. It took 20 minutes to get it. Appetizer and main course were ok. Definitely nothing great or sophisticated. This is not a place for the food. It was pedestrian food, not developed in flavors at all. They say they are a new restaurant and one of the best now , they absolutely are not. It's the same marginal food as always from years ago, but with new carpet.   Our waiter was hardly ever there to help. At the end of the night I wanted to leave a $10 tip on a $150 bill. My wife made me leave $15.   I have been here many times over the years. I'm absolutely never going back. Management doesn't care about you. You don't matter. The food is not anything special. You go for the view. If you get a crappy little table with people in front of you, you wasted all the effort of getting into the place (which itself took 30 minutes to clear security and go up the elevators) and get nothing. I'm never going back.   I told the waiter than I would tell the truth of this place in my review and to tell management. They didn't care. Despite my multiple complaints no one even bothered to come say one word to me.   If you want a great view at dinner of the whole strip you have plenty of options where people care and the food is great. Look toward the south end at the Mandalay Bay for instance. But whatever you do, don't come here.   I fully expect some type of management reply to the review. I really don't care what you folks have to say, or how sorry you are, or whatever bogus explanation you give. You couldn't bother to talk to me yesterday, save it now. There was no reason to seat people who arrive after me in better tables than me. You weren't at capacity. There were plenty of options, even if you pretend now there were not - I was there. You just didn't care. And I truly hope that this review discourages other from dining with you. My wife came from Mexico, me from Florida and we didn't ask for much. I gave you plenty of notice. But I didn't matter to you. And so you don't matter to me.",

The only thing that was a small disappointment was the lobster bisque. It seemed a little bland. We were here 4th of July 2015 and we had a wonderful view of the fireworks display Vegas is so well known for. I had the bananas foster for dessert and was one of the best desserts I have ever had. I still have yet to find a bananas foster that even comes close to comparing to the one we had that evening.  This restaurant made for a wonderful evening and a most memorable celebration.",

Making a reservation was as easy as can be, just used Open Table and we were set. Made sure to call them before we left our home to make sure they had the reservation and they did! Since we were going to Las Vegas for our 24th Anniversary we decided that this would be our fancy Anniversary dinner.  This restaurant is at the top of the Stratosphere Hotel and Casino on the 106th floor. We self parked in the parking garage of the Stratosphere and it was FREE! We had to walk through to the casino to get to the escalator and elevators that go to the restaurant. We checked in at the desk before getting on the elevator and the girl at the desk wished us a Happy Anniversary...so nice! We got on the elevator and there was an attendant that escorted us to the 107th floor, checked in at another desk and the girl there wished us a Happy Anniversary also! A hostess came to escort us to our table, we walked down a flight of stairs to the 106th floor and was seated at our table near the window. This floor rotates 360o very slowly, you can't even tell it's moving, we got there just before sunset, so we got to see the city in the daylight, at dawn and at night with all the beautiful lights...just breathtaking!  Our server greeted us and as soon as we were seated we were brought water and bread. I told the waiter that we had a Groupon and he gave us a special Groupon menu. We choose between to starters, two appetizers, two entrees and two desserts. So I ordered what I wanted and my husband ordered the other choice so we could try everything. I thought because it was a special Groupon menu that it wouldn't be that great but I was wrong, everything was delicious!  So we tried the following:  Ceasar Salad: fresh, crisp lettuce, just the right amount of dressing and croutons.  Lobster Bisque: Lumps of lobster with a tomato cream soup, warm and delicious.  Crab Cake: Lightly breaded and fried with a creamy mustard sauce.  Cavatelli Pasta & Shortribs: YUM!  Filet Mignon & Shrimp: Medium temp., melt in your mouth, served on a bed of pureed potatoes.  Ora King Salmon & Shrimp: Served with lemon butter. It was moist and tasty.  Salted Carmel Creme Brulee: Mmmmmmm...!  Spumoni: Cherry, Pistachio & Chocolate coated in a chocolate candy shell!  We were so full!!!  Also got to watch the people bungee jumping off the top of the Stratosphere right in front of us!   We really enjoyed it and would definitely go back!!! After dinner we went to the 109th floor to the observation deck to check it out, there is usually a charge to go to the observation deck but if you dine at the restaurant it is complimentary.",

I made reservation weeks in advance actually.We were going to be Vegas for  a family reunion so I had to make a visit here! Also we were staying at the Strat Hotel as well. It was a surprise dinner for my honey as hes almost done with his schooling and I'm so very proud of him.We go window seating just as I requested. He ordered a steak of course I had lobster and potatoes. We didn't have any drinks as we had a few of those already lol so just water was fine.The service was great i cant recall our servers name. Only hiccup we had was when came time to pay my card got DECLINED!!!! I WAS EXTREMELY UPSET I SAID NO WAY RUN IT AGAIN. MY GREAT BANK WELLS FARGO THOUGHT IT WAS FRAUD SO THEY DECLINED THE PAYMENT.My honey paid and I just zelled the money back to him because it was my treat. I CALLED AND GAVE THEM A PIECE OF MY MIND!! I understand they were only trying to protect my account but I had been spending money all weekend.It would have been nice to get a call or text to verify if it was me before doing so. It was Embarrassing to say the least. That was the only downfall of dinner but other than that it was excellent. We will be back again for sure.",

    "text": "Very Exquisite Restaurant!  My hubby and I ended our mini vacation at this restaurant on a Saturday evening.  The restaurant is located on the 106th floor of the Stratosphere tower.   Be aware of coming through a security checkpoint and metal detector before coming on the elevator.  My husband had to take off his belt and it felt almost like a TSA checkpoint.  One we passed that, we got off the elevator and we checked in at the booth. It took about 5 minutes to be called to be seated.  At first, we were looking around because 2 parties had come in after us, but seated before us.  But when we were escorted to our table, we realized it was because they saved a window seat for our reservation!  Our server was Max, whom was very professional and attentive.  He made excellent recommendations and my husband got the crabcake appetizer and salmon w/ shrimp entree.   I ordered the crab-stuffed chicken and we shared the lobster mac & cheese.  The chicken breast was seasoned well on the outside, and the crabmeat was filled inside the chicken.  Mac & Cheese was creamy based with jumbo peices of lobster meat through out (Definitely enough to share)  I sampled my husband's crabcake and it had a crispy coating and soft inside with sauces drizzled on the side for dipping.  Very tasty.  The view is what makes this restaurant one of a kind.  It slowly spins 360 degrees allowing you to catch every angle of the city.  Since we got dinner, we were invited to the observation deck (at no additional charge) to see the city a little higher up.  We had a amazing time!",

    "text": "By the time news had spread of Pawan Pinisetti's pending departure from Top of The World Restaurant reservations had already been made for Saturday, dinner for three originally intended to take a look at Spring's bounty quickly turning into a delicious \"Bon Voyage\" spanning three courses.  The fourth visit in seven months, all with the newly-crowned Chopped champion at the helm, it was ascending to the 107th Floor that guests checked in prior to occupying a window-side seats one level down, a young man this time providing professional service that was simultaneously friendly and genuine.  Tweaking everything from Appetizers to Desserts in early April, Pawan's penchant for sourcing and simplicity on display across ten new items, it was starting with seasonal Cocktails that setting sun was watched, both Honey Bumble Bee and Top of The World's twist on a Cable Car sweet but balanced while the Orange Cosmo is far more Spirit-forward.  Trying to show restraint with Bread, though the lightly-sugared Brioche and Baguette made for soaking-up Sauces were mostly gone by meal's end, it was utilizing top-grade Avocados that the first of two Salads shined thanks to Hot Sauce and Sunflower Seeds, a follow-up of Tomatoes and domestic Mozzarella also performing well without trying to reinvent the wheel.   Quickly growing more meaty, Winter's Tuna Tartare with picked Wasabi replaced by Fish brightened by Soy and Fresno Chilis, it was actually finely ground Beef that this time stole the spotlight, in one part due to the inclusion of classic accoutrements but additionally owing to fried Pita intended to be used as a delivery mechanism.     Overloading the table for round two, sixteen ounces of Grass-fed Beef from Tasmania prepared medium the centerpiece, it was with sides of Lobster Macaroni and Cheese and buttery Potatoes that each bite delivered big flavor, the addition of three Sauces gilding the proverbial lily and a toss-up between Bearnaise and Truffle Gouda Cheese as to which was better.  Neglecting to photograph Pea Pods with a hint of Mint, each bite the very definition of fresh, it was finding Brussels Sprouts a touch undercooked that focus switched back to Beef, previously-tasted Cavatelli and braised Wagyu standing up well to Horseradish-infused Cream just as Swordfish Steak did to Pepperonata that varied from sweet to spicy and back again with each bite.  Obligated to offer Scallops, the fan-favorites expertly seared atop creamy Cauliflower, it should come as no surprise to savvy diners that U3 Prawns packed far more bang for the buck with nothing more than Garlic Butter and Lemon while Lamb from New Zealand also took a \"less is more\" approach in allowing the Protein to shine.     Requesting Coffee with Dessert, its delivery timely despite the grand finale arriving fast, suffice it to say that Top of the World's 21-layer Chocolate Cake and Baked Alaska both remain formidable showstoppers, though the newly-launched Butter Cake is not far off thanks to what must be a whole stick dissolved in Sugar and Flour that retains a bit of tooth, thus contrasting nicely against slowly melting Ice Cream.",

The view of the City of Vegas during the sunset is breathtaking, need I say more?  During a lovely weekend in Vegas, Mr. and I were driving around trying to escape the rain. While he was trying to take me to Fremont Street for a night stroll, it began to rain and I refused to get out the car and mess up my hair. Welp, he got it after a while and drove around downtown Vegas when I had noticed the Stratosphere. In extreme excitement, I requested we go there to see what was in the building. He gave me a smirk and replied, \"Oh, you're going to love me for this\". Without hesitation, I sucked my lips and gave him a \"yea, okay\" type of look. Little did I know, it was in for a lovely ride to the 104th floor. Although we didn't have reservations, we had no problem getting access to be seated right away, it was perfect! Everything worked out so smoothly like it was meant to be.   This is absolutely perfect for a romantic dinner; pricey, but nice indeed! Our wonderful host, Damien, was able to seat us with a lovely view of the strip of Downtown Vegas as we began our 360 degrees (slow) revolving view of the city. We had a wonderful view from the window. The rotating restaurant offers a wonderful view of the strip and once you have had enough drinks and food, you get free access to the 108 and 109 floors (observation deck)! Make sure you ask your server because our server, Dana, wasn't the friendliest but it helped that we had a wonderful waiter that kept us entertained by talking to us about Vegas and the different things to do in the Stratosphere building. Our waiter was actually the one that informed us that we would have access to the observation deck. Alas, Dana must have disliked me and the boo because she previously informed us that if we get JUST drinks, then we wouldn't have access to the observation deck (totally left a bad taste in my mouth) UGH.   LET'S MOVE ON....   The drinks here are delicious and totally worth it! We heard so much about the bread so we had to order it. Little did we know, the bread was not complimentary and cost $5. Ugh, I sure wish they could have told us that before we ordered it! But, let's be honest--its Vegas what did I expect?! I love that you can see people bungee-jumping from the building. It was actually very cool to watch while dining.   Let's just say, the Top of the WORLD is OVER the TOP! One of the MOST romantic things that we both could have done, definitely something to remember.",

    "text": "We first dined at Top of the. World many years ago shortly after moving to Vegas, coming to celebrate an occasion with our adult daughter. We loved it. But it fell off our radar and we hadn't been back since. Mistake! Friends who have eaten here many times suggested it for dinner and conversation. Excellent idea.  Probably the only real negative to the evening was having to walk through the casino and then through security to get to the elevators to take you up to the restaurant. We came at a bad time because it took about 10 minutes just to get through the security line and on to the elevator (and the elevator was really packed for the ride up). Once we got into the restaurant, everything improved. We had hoped to get a table next to the window but ended up in a booth. Advantages to each. The tables are closer to the window but you sit facing your dinner companions, not the view. In the booth, you get to look out at the view while you dine. Because the booths are elevated there is no obstructed view in the house. The meal starts with a basket of breads - three different small rolls and a few boards of the very thin crisps. I opted to get the tasting menu (4 courses, $106). My wife ordered the ribeye ($59) with a side of sweet potato fries ($12). My first course was a lobster bisque soup. The server brings a bowl with a serving of lobster in the center and then adds the hot soup in at the table. The bisque was very thick and very tasty. Outstanding start to the meal. For my second course, I chose the cavatelli pasta. This is a small tube pasta with wagyu beef ragu, wild mushrooms with a horseradish cream on top. Wow! Delish. For my third course, I chose the filet mignon. This was a 10 oz piece of meat with a brown sauce cooked to perfection. One of the best filets I have had in years. It was served with three large grilled shrimp, potato puree and 3 asparagus spears. I'm not a fan of asparagus, but the potatoes and the shrimp were excellent. For dessert, I shared my salted caramel creme brulee with my wife. So much food, neither of us could finish it all.  Service was excellent throughout. Clint, our server, was informative and personable. The food runners and busboys all did a great job. Is it pricey? Yup. But is it worth it? Also yes.",

I suggest the four course with filet minion to go with the 360 view of Las Vegas.  Make reservations at 7-730pm.  Which is taller the space needle in Seattle or the LAS Vegas Stratosphere?",

The surf and turf was amazing along with their complimentary bread. I believe the floor we were on was floor 106. But 107 is the lounge and 108 is the observation with bungee jumpers. And last but certainly not the least the Rooftop has a bar and rides to get on. All of them have the same spectacular view. Oh! And keep in mind the elevator to take you to these floors goes 1,800 feet per minute. Feels pretty scary lol but you'll get get over it. But anyway this is the place to be with your date or even family.  There is also a photographer that goes around and offers to take pictures for you. Our pictures came out so great!",

The restaurant slowly rotates. And it is fun seeing people jump off the top.   Foie Gras and lobster bisque appetizers were ok. Nothing too special.   Seafood alfredo: okay. Loved the shrimp n lobster, fresh and succulent. But the pasta itself was bland.   Truffle pasta: skip. Flavorless. And the pasta was too mushy for me. Cooked a bit too long.   Wagyu Ribeye added lobster tail: ok. Steak was a bit tough.   Note: need to go through a metal detector downstairs.",

We were seated immediately at 7:45pm on a Friday night.  Took an elevator to go all the way upstairs and its split between the restaurant and the viewing area.  Ordered the Australian lobster tail with the wagyu steak and it was delicious!!!!!!!! the dining area spins as you dine and you can get a 360 view of vegas and it was MINDBLOWING!!!! definitely would recommend this place, it is a bit pricey tho but that view just makes up for it !",

The view *was* sensational though!   It was good, but didn't think it was worth the exorbitant price. We unfortunately won't be back.",

The breathtaking view on the 106th floor over seeing the entire Vegas strip, the ambience was dim and romantic, the music was fun with a mixture of old & new school. THE FOOD was delicious, we had the lobster bisque for starters, I had the swordfish which was remarkable full of flavor and seasoned to perfection, a side order of the lobster Mac & cheese & the Brussels sprouts. My partner whom we celebrated his birthday at Top of the World had the grilled salmon which was wonderful . We even brought our own bottle of champagne  and paid a small cork fee . The customer service was exceptional from start to finish. I will most definitely be visiting here again",

    "text": "Top of the World restaurant in the Stratosphere Hotel/Casino was an amazing experience. The tower is the tallest structure in Vegas and the view is incredible.   The restaurant rotates in a circle while dining which takes about 45 minutes for a full revolution so you get a spectacular view of all sides of Vegas.   Make sure to go early before your reservation (make sure to make a reservation) as there is a wait for the elevator up the tower and the security checkpoint that consists of a metal detector and bag check (safety first). My only other tip is to make sure to request a seat by the window when making reservations. If you are taking the time and spending the money....make sure you have the maximum experience.   We went at sunset so we were able to view Vegas at daylight and during the evening with the lights.   Staff was very friendly and the food was delicious. Our waitress upgraded us to the window seat for my birthday. People all around us were there for special occasions and recommend to wear nice clothing. When it's 108 in Vegas it's easy to just wear shorts and a t-shirt without thinking twice about it.   Stratosphere is among the older hotels but the restaurant is still the best dining experience in Vegas.",

In a little over an hour, you get to see the entire Vegas skyline from the top of the Stratosphere. We had really great service and the food was super great. I highly recommend the lobster bisque! That was probably the best bowl of lobster bisque I've ever had. That alone was worth it. My husband and I each got steak, and they were delicious. We shared the lobster mac & cheese and green beans, but honestly we were so full by the end of the meal, we should have shared just one side.

    "text": "This place was eh. 5 stars for the view and 3 stars for the food. So I'm visiting Vegas to celebrate my sisters birthday and I told her to choose the place she would like no matter the cost for her b-day dinner. She chose \"Top of the World\" restaurant at the Stratosphere hotel. The place is easy to find. Once you check in, you're directed to go thru a metal detector then proceed to the elevator to be taken to the top.   Although I requested to be sat on the outer rim close to the window when I made reservations online two weeks in advance, it's not guaranteed and you must ask upon arrival. So this was a bummer when we couldn't get seated in our requested area for the better view and pictures. None the less where we were seated was ok. We had two waiters but I forget their names and they were nice explaining the menu items and their specials.   My sister and I for drinks ordered the mango madness and a glass of moscato and both were really good. For our main course we both went with their surf and turf which came with a 9 oz Filet mignon, lobster tail and mixed vegetables. We also order a shared side of mashed potatoes. They do give a complimentary basket of bread variety with different butters. The food was ok. Could have been a lot better for what I paid. If you're going for the view cool but the food is just mediocre in my opinion and I have dined at some of the best fine dining restaurants in DC and NY so I definitely know the difference.   Another thing as mentioned above...this was a birthday celebration and my sister was acknowledged however when it came down to her birthday desert they do not offer complimentary special occasion dessert you have to pay for it. Never been to a place that don't give a free dessert when celebrating a special event when we could have gone somewhere else. So this was new to me and maybe it's just how it's done is Vegas idk.   This was definitely a one time visit and I would not be back. Mainly because I think there are better options I can spend over $200 on.",

Even still, I had to call in to let them know I might be arriving a little later and they did a great job accommodating my arrival time.  This was my first time at Stratosphere even though I've been to Vegas a mess of time. The whole experience from parking to going up to the restaurant was a nice journey. I liked that parking didn't cost. Each person in check in was very nice and well mannered.   Food: French Onion Soup - I prefer traditional mozzarella instead of the fondue. It was an interesting take  Tuna Tartare Tacos - amazing, best thing I had, The taro shells were a great compliment.   Filet Mignon 10oz - Very average. Dry, overcooked, and the plating on the big plate made the steak look very pathetic. I was extremely disappointed.  Sides - Lobster Mac - Great Mac, saucy style Mac but the amount of lobster was always disappointing. Any lobster Mac lacks the lobster so I guess you can't expect much.  Sauteed Broccolini - Very average. Waiter warned us it might be spicy cause of the chili flakes. Hot Cheetos has more kick than this.   The food itself was okay. I loved the Tuna Tartare tacos. Everything else wasn't all that impressive. I thought they would have the pre fixe menu but that ended the day before. The pre fixe menu had a better course than the items presented. I think it was a little more well thought out. The filet was the worst decision. I don't expect a filet to be overly juicy, but it was honestly poorly cooked. I like my steak medium rare and it was a solid medium. The dryness of the steak showed that it sat too long. If they had the sauce they described in the pre fixe, it would've made a lot of sense. Everything else I order was okay. The service itself was great. I don't mind that.  Luckily the view and the fact the sunset was priceless. I don't regret the experience and I am glad I got to share it with my date. I would just never come back there again. The revolving restaurant was a cool ploy but I don't think the food stands up to the atmosphere. Nevertheless, I don't discourage people to come here, there's a lot of value. I just think you shouldn't be caught up with everything and the price tag to not be able to see the quality in the food.",

The waiters were MIA all night. Never got a refill on water even when asked.  Also if you like multiple cocktails order them all up front. Good luck getting more of anything from this restaurant.  Something to know. Getting out of this restaurant may take some time. A few people waiting to get on the elevator to leave threw temper tantrums due to the wait. What made everything worse was the staff who instead of being polite and attempting to ease the tension decided to also act like children and yell back with their own tantrum. Absolutely pathetic.. It was comedic",

Front desk, I dinging them because I told them I wanted a table where we can see the sunset. They told us 7:45pm. Well, we missed it.

The lobster bisque was not very good like other people have raved about. The pork belly was actually very flavorful and I did enjoy that. I got the 14 ounce ribeye cooked medium. It was probably the worst the steak I've ever had in my life. We got a glass of Merlot and it was also not good. The only good thing about this place is the view at night. It is very cool to see the city lit up. The service was good and everyone was very friendly. However expect to drop a pretty penny for your meal. If I were you reading this review I would skip the overrated overly expensive low quality food and opt for the half-price appetizers late night. Do yourself a favor and pay yourself $200 by not going here.",

We were told that it takes about 1 hour & 20 minutes for it to go a complete circle.   The view is GORGEOUS. I believe you are about 108 floors up. And because the view is so amazing, they get 4 stars. The one missing star is for their food. It's really not the best. I'm sure a lot of people come here for the view, not the food.",

    "text": "When I booked a table for 4 at the Top of The World I was expecting a typical Vegas high end tourist trap (translation: bad service, so-so food, astronomical prices). Boy I was wrong. Let me go straight to the details:  1) Incredible view of Vegas, and the restaurant spins, thus you get a 360o view in about 1 hour. After dinner you have free access to the observation deck. Awesome.  2) Food was very good.... but expensive (thus the 4*'s). We ordered a lot of stuff, from salads to appetizers to entree and then the delicious banana flambee desert. OMG, and the wines, fairly priced, we had two bottles.  3) Service: attentive, polite, efficient. Really. Yes, I know, can this be Vegas? Yep. I wish most fancy Vegas restaurants had waiters like the one we had at TOTW.  4) Other goodies: valet parking is free, also enjoy the observation deck as much as you want, and watch the nut-freaks jumping of the platform (they charge $110 for you to crap in your pants). Take lots pictures. I took 7584 pictures that evening. I also believe a wheel chair is complimentary after you over-eat and over-drink and can't even walk to your car. Also lot's of hot babes with their boyfriends  note: if  he catches you staring at his girl friend's ultra-mini-skirt (is that a Victoria Secret price tag dangling of the thong's back part?) and cleavage (34dd), and he wants to beat the soul out off your skull, pretend you are a tourist from Estonia and staring at someones girlfriends boobs will bring great luck to the village and fertility to the cows. Don't forget the Russian accent, otherwise you are dead.  In summary: we had a great evening at TOTW restaurant. I was not expecting it, I was pleasantly surprised. Recommended!",

I ordered the wagyu skirt steak medium well. I was blown away. The sauce it was cooked in was wonderful and the steak itself was cooked to perfection and was not tough or anything. I can't explain how good it was.  My bf ordered the new York strip medium and his also was made perfectly. It melted in your mouth.   The only part I would complain about is our waitress's service took a little nose dive with us after another table of hers blew something wrong with their order completely out of proportion. She became very short with us and didn't seem like she had the time of day for us.  Also, if you take the monorail over take a left once you cross the street. Don't go straight. It's kind of a sketchy neighborhood. So honestly I would just take a cab",

    "text": "This restaurant has a stunning view of Las Vegas, and makes a full rotation in about an hour, so every spot has an amazing view.  The sections are numbered, which is helpful to find your table if you leave to wash your hands or whatnot.  The rotation of the restaurant is slow so don't worry about getting sick or dizzy. I've been in rotating restaurants before that spun too fast, which isn't fun when you're trying to enjoy a good meal.  We started our meal with the market greens salad:  tomatoes, fennel, roasted beets, with balsamic vinaigrette on top.  The salad is held together with thick strips of fresh, crunchy cucumber.  Delicious.  For dinner I had the Large Mexican Prawns, New England Scallops & Lobster a la Plancha with roasted cauliflower salad with red bell pepper, golden raisins and capers, Moorish tomato sauce and chive oil.  I had never had Lobster a la plancha before, and this was simply amazing.  My husband ordered the Fettuccine Seafood Alfredo with Lobster, Prawns & Scallops with artisanal pasta, teardrop tomatoes, Parmesan Reggiano, garlic, parsley and basil.  The alfredo sauce wasn't too heavy which is nice and flavorful.  For dessert, everything looked amazing but we finally chose the lemon cheesecake with white chocolate shavings.  Tarty and thick, this cheesecake was amazing.  This restaurant is perfect for a romantic dinner to celebrate a special occasion.  Business casual attire is required, so don't try to come here in flip flops and shorts.  I would also recommend getting a reservation so you can guarantee you'll get a spot by the window.",

It did take a while to go up because of the long elevator line.  But when we finally made it to the top the view was amazing!! The food was delicious but the server was eh! You could tell he didn't care for his job.  We took pictures and they were offered to us at the end but they were $45. It was way too much for our blood lol. Fyi, it is an older place now so when it's turning there is a part where it makes the loudest noise!!!! The first time we heard it we got a little frighten.  But we were told it was normal,  but you would think with the prices they would be able to oil those wheels up or something.  Anyways,  after dinner we went to the Final floor and enjoyed the view.  It was an overall great experience!",

Our reservation was for 4:45, perfect to see the sights in the daylight AND after sunset.   Our server, Dalia, was a total sweetheart. She even helped take some pictures using my camera, as I kept trying to get one of the sunset and they just weren't turning out right.  The food was phenomenal. Both my boyfriend and I went with the five course tasting menu. Everything was top notch but my favorites were the crab cake and the filet mignon. Both of those were the best I've ever had! The crab cake was so decadent, and the filet was melt-in-your-mouth and cooked perfectly.  The best part, however, was right before dessert. My boyfriend got up from the table, came around to my side, got down on one knee and proposed! He had even spoken to Dalia ealier in the evening and had arranged for the professional photographer to come around and snap photos while he proposed, how special is that?! Oh, and of course I said yes :)  We ended up getting two photo albums and two wallet size albums, which cost a pretty penny BUT since we were already spending a lot for the amazing dinner, springing for the photos was too good to pass up. Plus, how often do you get photo's of your proposal?! That, to me, made the whole night totally priceless.",

Our server asked immediately asked us if we were ready to order before we had even chosen our drinks. In addition the menu was very limited and overpriced for the selection. After waiting another 15 minutes or so before she returned we decided we did not want to eat there due to the poor service. Upon telling our server we had changed our mind about dining there, she promptly said \"ok, you will need to move to the bar\" instead of even asking why or what was wrong! Overall very disappointing experience. We ended up going to Morton's instead and they were wonderful!",

I need to go back there and just enjoy a fantastic meal and drinks again -- the cost is a little high but you're paying for the view, the great company of a server that cares, and the most incredible food (that you can tell the chef cares a great deal about). If you are unhappy with anything, they replace the item immediately and apologize profusely for the mistake. I spent probably more than I should have but this is definitely a spot worth spending serious cash on. If you go, the atmosphere is just amazing and order the lobster bisque and almost anything seafood related. You will not be disappointed.",

We ordered the four course tasting menu and the skirt steak.  Everything (lobster bisque, crab cakes, filet and skirt steak) was very dry and lacked much flavor.  The food was definitely extremely disappointing and overpriced.  The positives for this restaurant were the views and the service; Rafael was our waiter and gave great service throughout the whole meal, especially selling food that he probably knew was subpar.  My recommendation, go to the observatory for the views and get your meal somewhere else.",

I made reservations for 6pm in the hopes of catching the sunset, which we did.  Big plus.  We were also able to see a sky jumper, another plus!  Our server, Bon, was great.  He was very pleasant, friendly, and helpful.     The food was just okay which is disappointing because the entrees are pretty pricey.  My husband had the halibut (bland) and I had the turf and quack (perfectly prepared but flavor was just eh).  It just wasn't anything to write home about really.  I was hoping for a fantastic meal but the flavor just wasn't there.  For the money, you can definitely find a better meal anywhere on The Strip!  I personally wouldn't come back for the food.  I do, however, highly recommend the view.  So I would suggest paying the $16 (or whatever it cost)  to access the viewing deck or go there for lunch and spend way less than what you would for dinner.",

    "text": "The more sophisticated \"roller coaster\" of the Stratosphere Hotel. And I say this because the restaurant spins around the hotel at the top, giving you a 360 degree view of the city.  VENUE: We were escorted via elevator to the very top of the hotel. We stepped out, and were greeted and immediately sat at a table for two by the windows. As the circumference of the restaurant is ceiling-to-floor glass, and because it was 1PM in the afternoon, natural light just streamed in all around us. It was super bright yet, quiet and intimate. Not too many tables at 1PM (on the 4th of July, no less), which meant 2-3 people were coming by to check on us and make sure we were comfortable. Also as the restaurant spins around, you get a view of the people who are doing the bungee jump off the hotel. Fun to watch and it didn't take away from the air of sophistication at all.   FOOD/DRINK: Oh my heavens. If you decide to drink and enjoy sweet alcoholic beverages, please please please try the \"Razz-jito.\" I ordered this per recommendation of our server, and it was FANTASTIC. Super delicious. My boyfriend ordered the \"Mango Madness\" and it was super strong (for me). I tasted more alcohol than anything and did not ask for a second sip. We ordered off the lunch menu. We started with the Lobster Bisque. It was solid you can't really go wrong with this soupd. I got the Mediterranean Salad with Lamb. The Lamb was huge and salad portions were huge as well. Pretty standard lamb choice but nothing to go through the roof about. Salad was fresh and came with fried onions on top (myfavorite). The bf ordered the Seafood Sandwich - a seemingly good choice. He stated that he liked everything IN the sandwich but to have it combined in that way was not favorable. However, the sandwich was pretty big and came with these really neat looking potato chips.  Food was okay, maybe we just weren't ordering the right stuff.  SERVICE: As stated in the first paragraph, service was awesome.  Overall the view and service compensated for our food.",

ATMOSPHERE:   The view from the revolving restaurant is what made the experience fun.  After lunch, we went out on the terrace and enjoyed the view and watched the rides that were at the top.  We didn't go on the rides because they seemed so insane.    WOULD I GO THERE AGAIN?:   Sure, I would go there again, just for the view.  The food was adequate, but the view made our experience fun.",

    "text": "We went to the stratosphere for our one year wedding anniversary, it wasn't the best hotel and after going thru security and up the old elevator with the elevator attendant we arrived at the restaurant. we were seated at a great table by the window and as you know it takes about an hour an half to turn around the entire hotel. The views are specatacular.  Our Waiter, David, has been there forever and gave us all the history and recommendations. The manager for some reason wasn't thrilled that he would speak to us but he was definately doing his job. Our water was always full and we were even given extra bread and butter.  I started off with the lobster bisque and that was specatacular. My husband had a salad and the ribeye with mushrooms. I had a filet mignon and baked potatoe.  He said my filet was much better than his rib eye and the potatoe was nothing to write home about. The mushrooms were good. and our drinks were just average. We do have to say that the service and view were definately top quality. We would suggest for a special night and great memory afterwards you are able to go up to the tip top and see the view from outside and see all the crazys jump off the side of the building. Keep in mind: Although they tell you to dress up. most people go very casual.  we could hear the people up at the lounge upstairs. ANd the crowd of kids who go for the rides is not what you want for a special occasion.",

My friend and I had an excellent lobster bisque...downside...it was luke warm!  What a way to destroy a first impression.  The ceasar salad was a bit drenched in dressing, otherwise tasty.  The Kobe burger came out fully pink in the middle and we had to send it back.  Fortunately, our waiter was able to comp us for the burger.  The service was very good and the wait staff were all very attentive, promptly refilling our waters and checking in with us.   We went at around 3pm and the sun really hit us hard at one point.  This place is just beautiful around sunset.",

Well that;s like asking me to sneeze with my eyes open. w/e. I ordered the salad w/ the maytag blue cheese dressing. The best freaking salad I've ever had. Main course i had the Jumbo prawns and scallops. Never  had either b4 and they were so freakin good. Sides: had 3 cheese au gratin potatoes and grilled asparagus. Delicious. SO much food I was so full. Did I mention the 3 types of butter w/ the bread? Delicious. I beleive one of them was orange flavored OMG so good. Too bad the meal averages about $80-100 a head b/c if it was just a tad cheaper I'd go back. Delicious! It was the fanciest night. And while normally I wouldnt had enjoyed the picture taking I was very happy she was there b/c I couldnt find my camera before we left for the strip that night. Thank goodness for $150 pictures.

Our dinner was at 6:00, so we got to watch the sun set and see all the shimmery lights come on throughout the area. Incredible. The wait staff was extremely courteous, our waiter knew my name and addressed me directly the entire night. Also, a very nice woman came to our table as our view reached the strip and took some lovely photos of me and my friends. I got the baby kale salad to start which was delicious, and the bread basket was amazing, too; sourdough, Asiago crusted, everything crackers, and three different flavors of butter. For my main course I ordered the New York strip steak with a side of gnocchi and butternut squash. The steak was cooked to perfection, and the gnocchi was some of the best I have ever had.  I was too full to even think about desert, which is saying something considering some upscale restaurants leave you wanting to get another dinner afterwards with their small portions. Not the case here. I was actually upset about being so full because I had really wanted to try the mixed berries in a white chocolate cup. Oh well, there is always next time. And the next time I am in Vegas, I will DEFINITELY be returning. Everything about the dinner experience at Top of the World was divine.",

The restaurant is on the 106th floor, easily accessed by very fast elevators (I could hear my ears pop 3 times), revolves slowly (one revolution in about an hour) so you can enjoy the crazy panoramic view of Las Vegas sprawled around you, and the food & service can't be beat.  The prices are reasonable, and the selection is decent.    I had a few friends who didn't take too well to the motion (bring Dramamine if you're one of those), and my booze-snob friends thought the martinis were kind of low-brow. I only had a mild freaking out when I noticed flying humans in the air above the restaurant.  OMG there's a ride up there!  Not for me; there'd be pee, vomit and crap trailing my shoes.  Drama drama drama.  But besides that, I had a wonderful time.  If Trump builds anything higher than the Stratosphere, he ought to be ashamed of himself.",

If i'm going to pay $40 for chicken it better blow my foodie mind. I can assure you, it did not. While it was above decent, It didn't seem like anything I couldn't get in any other less expensive steak house. The menu is pretty limited so make sure you either like steak or seafood (neither of which i like) before you decide to spend the $$$ to eat here. The view is gorgeous (you have to go at night), but I could have just seen that by going to the observation deck. They did have orange flavored butter for the bread that was the highlight of my meal! One redeeming quality!  Oh and the couple in front of us that was about the get it on at the table didn't really add to my experience. Please go back to your room....",

For lunch you reap the same benefits as dinner,  such as being able to go to the top of the Stratosphere without having to pay extra.  To sum it up the lunch menu offers the dinner entrees worth getting at a fraction of the price. Lunch ranges ~$12-$17 for sandwiches, and the pre fixe menu for ~$30. Definitely worth a try.

It was spectacular.  We also had skyjumpers jump past our window.  Wow.  The food?  Also spectacular!  What a nice surprise.  The staff took great care of us.I had the lobster bisque to start, and it was rich and full of lobster flavor.  I then had a special steak item.  My sister had a bacon wrapped pork tenderloin.  My Dad, a light eater, had soup to start and the crab cake appetizer as his entree.  The server didn't even blink at his request.  They have small desserts that you order in trios.  We ordered two raspberry mousses (I think) and (my choice) a mini bread pudding.  The two mouses were great, but (the only slightly less than wonderful moment of the evening) the bread pudding was dry and hard.    We were ready for a leisurely meal, and the staff moved the dinner along at our pace.  The entire experience was elegant, delicious, and wonderful.  It is very expensive, but the food and the view were worth it!",

Our table was in the second row and had a perfect face on view.  The view was amazing, breathtaking even.  Our waiter was very attentive and the service was perfect.  To start, I had the Grilled Portobello and Buffalo Mozzarella.  It was very delicious and everything on it tasted very fresh.  For my main meal, I had the filet mignon.  It was one of the best cuts of steak I have had in a really long time, if not ever.  It was perfectly cooked to medium and extremely flavorful.  It was in a red wine mushroom sauce, which was very yummy.  For my side, I had mashed potatoes.  These were fluffy and prepared wonderfully.  For dessert, we split the lemon bar cheesecake.  It was phenomenal.  The cheesecake was surprisingly light and the lemon bar was a nice addition.  This restaurant is pretty expensive, but for one of the best meals I have ever eaten in my entire life, it was worth every cent.  Definitely make it a point to make this your splurge meal while spending time in Las Vegas, you will not be disappointed.",

    "text": "SUMMARY:  Make no mistake people, you'll definitely end up paying a hefty price for dining here so just plan for it.  Having said that, its (mostly) worth the price -- especially if you're seeking a romantic dining experience.  I still can't give it an absolute five stars. My general rating philosophy is to only give a place five stars if it's absolute perfection.  PROS: - Excellent breath-taking views. - Absolutely delicious food items. - Fast service. - Great ambiance (live music, mood lighting, etc)  NEUTRAL: - Slightly over-priced items. $215 for two people... - Slightly limited item selection (but to be fair, the BEST restaurants don't try to do everything... they specialize) - 98% of the staff were very polite.  CONS: - One staff-member was slightly kurt. Not a huge deal really. I try to give people the benefit of the doubt... maybe he was having a bad day. - There is an ever-so-slight arrogant aire of sophistication at the restaurant. I don't think it's anyone's fault... it just felt like people who dined there were expected to be fully aware of all dining etiquette. Maybe I'm just imagining things though.  ADVICE: - Always, always, ALWAYS get reservations. This place is popular even on weekdays. - If you're visiting Vegas with the family, consider dining somewhere else. The atmosphere at the Top of the World restaurant lends itself to business meetings and romantic dining. Not to mention that you'll get a much better value elsewhere.",

    "text": "I'm so sad to write this review.  My husband and I have regularly visited the Top of the World since 2002, when we got engaged.  The food and service was always superb.  Until last night.   We always order the same thing (we are a little stuck in our ways): filet mignon medium rare, garlic mashed potatoes, grilled asparagus and lobster bisque.  Every single visit up to last night provided for the most amazing filet either one of us had ever tasted... Like butter.  The sides were to die for as well...   And the lobster bisque-oh my God!!     When we visited last night we were disappointed to see that their menu had changed and the prices had been raised significantly.  But that still didn't deter us from ordering as their food and service has never let us down.  We both started with the lobster bisque and were very pleased.  Still delicious.    We then got our medium rare filets, Yukon gold potatoes and sauteed mushrooms (they no longer have asparagus-major letdown).   Neither one of us received a medium rare filet.  It was most definitely medium, which I know most people enjoy, but we are not those people.  The potatoes were dry and the mushrooms.....  I don't know even know what to say.  Generally we both love mushrooms, but these were far from  the quality and taste that we have come to expect over the decade we have been visiting.  They were just not good.  Compound our dissatisfaction with the meal with the fact that they had raised those prices, and you've got some unhappy customers.    Additionally, our waiter was one odd guy.  He was just not friendly and when he tried to serve us with a double order of mashed potatoes instead of our mushrooms, he seemed annoyed when we told him and even showed my husband his notes.... \"oh mash and mush look very similar\".   Okay, crazy- go get my shrooms! :)  The view is unbelievable and for us this place has a special memory, so we will probably come back, with the hope that Top of the World will return to it's original glory.   But if it weren't for that, this would probably have been our last visit.",

A $50 appetizer should be a-maaay-zing.  It wasn't.   On the upside, the sommelier was very knowledgeable about wine and turned us on to a great Chateau-nuf-du Pape (sp?).  The wine and the view were the best things about this place.  Save yourself $300. buy a good bottle, and head to the rooftop observation deck.   Then go eat elsewhere.",

Had booked 10-12 days before with a request for a window table. But did not get one, even when there were several window tables open. We were given the option to wait upstairs in the lounge for 45-60 mins for a window. That was Strike 1.   Food was very ordinary. Almost the class of a roadside diner. I have loved the foie gras in past.  This time it was tasteless unseasoned and even the balsamic reduction and brioche or whatever was tasteless. The miso sea bass was tough on outside and uncooked on inside and again tasteless. Even the bok choy on plate was boring. My friend's pasta was very ordinary. The mango cocktail was extremely sweet and undrinkable. The service was OK.  For a so called fine dining place, first there was no candle on table and when questioned, the waiter almost arrogantly said they didn't hv enough candles for the inside tables. Then one of the bus boys came and put a plastic battery operated tealight in the candle holder. Really? Fine dining ha?   Please save your money. There are lots of great restaurants in LV to choose from. The view may be great but the rest is unacceptable. I will not be coming back !",

It's pretty neat, although the height and slow rotation might make you a bit nauseous if you're sensitive to that.  Came on a Saturday afternoon around 3pm-absolutely no line and the restaurant was quite empty. It's a fun experience, you get to watch people fly past the window from the SkyJump a couple stories above you and catch the tips of peoples' shoes as they spin around on the Stratosphere thrill rides. Also, someone came and took pictures of us during the meal to show us after (for purchase).   Food:  Bread basket Mixed greens salad Portobello mushrooms Rib eye Ultra burger ($26) Banana foster Creme brulee  Total for 4 came to about $120 if I remember correctly.   The good stuff: salad was good, bread was good (there was a variety and came with 3 different spreads instead of just butter), banana foster was tasty and came in an \"almond box\" which was like a light nutty brittle and ice cream, and we asked if they could make the fries that came with the burger into garlic fries, and they did and it was amazing.   The things that could've been better: portobello mushrooms were just alright, rib eye was cooked well when we asked for medium well (but still good just could've been better), the burger wasn't that special and probably didn't have to be $26 for what we got, and the creme brulee wasn't the best I've had (it was a little too much vanilla flavor and very creamy, would've liked it to be a little thinner or lighter)...   Now that I've tried it, I don't feel like I have to come back. But it was an overall positive experience.",

Best thing was the view Food was so so...Had to salt my wagyu skirt steak because it was really lacking. The chimichurri sauce helped out though. Potatoes were great.  Bread and the plethora of butters were good, too.  My boyfriend had basics that are hard to screw up - cocktail shrimp, portobello mushroom, smoked salmon... Fresh and delicious. I preferred his selections over mine.  What I couldn't stand was the antiquated feel of the place... has a slight 1980s hotel restaurant vibe to it, maybe the maitre d butter, carpet with starburst patterns. A bit too cheesy for me. But nonetheless excellent and attentive service. I know this was a happening spot back in the day, but now I think the best thing going for them is the 360 degree rotating view.",

I love asparagus but somehow they messed it up! The steak sauce (gouda and truffle sauce) was served on the side and was like warm, served in the consistancy of butter rather than a sauce. And just be forewarned that there is a photographer that will bug you if you dont want to stand up and pose for a photo or 5. The food was good, but the ribeye was same as you can get at any Outback or Logans, and cold.  I'm not sure if they have to bring the food up the entire 120 floors by foot? But that would explain the temperature.   Also, you will have to go through a metal detector line before the elevator ride.  I would recommend going up there for the observation deck, but I wouldn't eat there again because the food was disappointing.",

    "text": "Came here with my wife for Valentine's Day. Been a local for 7 years, but my first time coming to the Stratosphere. The view was amazing, although fixating on the fact that you're constantly spinning can definitely lead to some nausea.  They had a tasting menu for Valentine's, but honestly there wasn't even a single thing on any of the courses that stood out to either of us. There were plenty of things on the menu that looked quite nice, so we created our own tasting menu that ended up at the same price ($200).  We started with the wedge salad, caesar salad with anchovies, shrimp cocktail and seared scallops. All were good, although certainly had better. Would happily have any of them again.  As for the main course, the waiter hyped up their \"signature dish\" of the wagyu ribeye. This is exactly what I would be looking to order just about anywhere and sounded fantastic. It was priced at $79, which sounded quite cheap for what it was supposed to be We complimented it with the seafood alfredo pasta dish and would continue to share.  The wagyu was served similar to what you would expect from Salisbury steak. It was smothered with onions on top and the entire plate was covered in sauce. This was certainly a bizarre presentation for what was supposed to be a high quality piece of meat.  That said, I don't think what they serve is actually wagyu. This is one of the lowest quality steaks I have ever eaten. If I were offered the same meal at any point in the future for $5, I would absolutely turn it down. There was no flavor. There was no marbling. There was tons of fat, but not in the way you would want in a high quality piece of meat. I don't fancy myself much of a grill master, but the choice steaks I get from Walmart are without a doubt far higher quality. And it wasn't like it just wasn't cooked well, it was legitimately a bad piece of meat. We couldn't even force it down and didn't box it up.  Whatever you do, please don't order this horrible dish. It is truly a steak that late night diners would be embarrassed to serve.   The pasta was pretty good, although certainly different from what you would expect from an alfredo pasta. The seafood in the dish was of decent quality and cooked well.  The service was also severely lacking. We waited for over 20 minutes to get water after our entrees arrived. This was not aided by the fact that one of our entrees was completely inedible.  The waiter and manager both acted shocked that we thought the steak was terrible, but after looking at yelp reviews while sitting at the table for an hour waiting to actually be able to pay our bill and leave, we found out that most people have thought this dish is horrible. Big mistake not yelping first! The manager offered to comp us a dessert, but we had already been there 2 hours and just wanted to leave so badly (it was after midnight at this point). We ended up getting it boxed to go, but the cheesecake mousse was still good the next day.  I feel like we were robbed of the $79 they charged for the inedible steak and the bad service made this an experience that will not have us ever returning to this restaurant (very surprised they didn't offer to take anything off the bill for serving trash). That said, if you do end up here, go with the seafood and dodge the steak and you should have a nice meal.",

    "text": "Whenever I read reviews of Las Vegas restaurants (especially those on the Strip) I'm intrigued by how many spend so little time discussing the food and, instead, concentrate on extraneous details like the friendliness of the wait staff or prices We're \"locals\" and as such have a lot of experience with these restaurants so here are a few thoughts on the Top of the World. First, after many visits we've found that the food here is almost always excellent. It's essentially a steak house and the menu (as well as the prices) reflect it. Don't come here for a burger or expect cheap menu options because there really aren't any. Tabs for two people can easily top $200. There are any number of other places within walking distance that can accommodate your taste for ground beef at much lower prices. Locals consider places like Top of the World to be \"event\" restaurants for things like anniversaries, birthdays and such. That's why the majority of diners always seem to be visitors, whose cell phone cameras seem to be permanently attached to their hands. Expect constant flashes. Most locals rarely venture to the strip outside of special occasions or to meet with friends visiting from out of town. Second, you can expect excellent service from a professional staff that understands the menu and will gladly help you with your selections as well as wine pairings if you so desire. Many have noted that orders seem to take a long time to arrive. I agree and have never been able to figure out why since the restaurant always seems adequately staffed. In any case, sit back and enjoy the spectacular view while you wait. Third, experiment a little with your food choices. Although it's a steak house, the menu includes a number of creative dishes that you probably won't find back home. You'll probably be surprised at how much enjoyment you can get out of being a little adventurous. Now a couple of gripes: Unfortunately, like almost all Vegas restaurants, there is no dress code. As such, you and your beautiful companion dressed for your anniversary can easily find yourself seated next to a table of guys who look (and sound) like they just arrived from a tailgate party. To my way of thinking, tee shirts, shorts and flip flops add nothing to what should be a fine dining experience. But hey, all money is green so Vegas accommodates. Tables full of beautiful young women dressed for the clubs likewise, can be just as distracting based on the amount of liquor already consumed and how many flash pictures they insist on taking, but that's a different story. Next, children. Why anyone would bring their kids to Vegas in the first place confuses me but there they are and the later it gets the more restless they become. Why not prohibit them after 8 pm?  Better yet, leave them at home. Finally, understand before coming to Vegas that (outside of cheap air fares and hotel rooms) this is an expensive town. Everything from food to booze and entertainment to gaming, is designed to separate you from your money. (How do you think Nevada gets by without a state income tax?) Enjoy your stay but be prepared to pay for it. TOTW is a memory you'll have long after returning home and forgetting how much you spent. I probably could pick a few more nits but the bottom line is that TOTW is an excellent Vegas experience and we'll be back.",

We started by being greeted by the friendly host that said Happy Birthday to me when we gave her our name and they made sure to make my night extra special for my night.   When we sat down we had water and the most delicious bread brought to us. This may be a little weird, but Im a fatty; The butter options were amazing. We were given a ginger orange butter, a pesto butter, and a regular butter for our bread. The bread was so good that we ate two baskets of bread.   We had the seafood platter as the appetizer which was a very nice size and presentation.   I had the steak and lobster for dinner with the side of twice baked potato, sauteed mushrooms, and gnocchi dish. The entire meal was delicious.   The only thing that I had a hard time with was that towards the end of our time at the top of the tower I started to feel a little bit of motion sickness. I was sitting backwards at the table and the rotation of the dining area was a little difficult for me, but it was totally worth it because the views were the best I have ever seen in Las Vegas.   I definitely would recommend this place to any of my friends.",

    "text": "From the minute we walked in and saw the view, I knew this was going to be a good experience.  106 floors up, at the top of the Stratosphere in Las Vegas, this rotating restaurant offers the most amazing panoramic views of Las Vegas that I have ever seen (and we visit here quite often from New York).  The restaurant is round in shape with a complete glass wall. It does rotate, taking an hour and 20 minutes to complete a 360 degree view. We were worried that my husband would get sick, but it moves so slowly that you can barely tell. If you make reservations, you can score one of the better seats in the house, a booth facing outwards looking head on at the windowed wall. So I definitely recommend reservations.  Food was AMAZING, service was impeccable. Staff acknowledged our anniversary, made it personal and special. Views are stunning. Would recommend 1000x over. I'm so sad we haven't visited this restaurant sooner and will be coming back EVERY time we are back in town.",

You can also see people sky jump off the stratosphere while you eat.  I picked a bottle of Sanctuary Pinot Noir from Santa Maria to start off. My wife had the Lobster Bisque for a first course and they do it table side for an awesome touch. For our main course she had the lamb chops and I had a filet with foie gras. Both dishes were amazing and also had great presentation. Afterward she had bananas foster and I had a glass of Pinot Noir from the wines by the glass. The glass of Pinot Noir was SO much different from the bottle that ordered it actually was the only negative of the night. I should went with a cab or merlot but that's my bad. After dessert we finished with coffee and expresso. Our waiter was great, everything went smooth. He was prefect, never missed a mark and was on point. Even talked to a manager on the way out and told him how smooth everything was. Top of the World ran like a well oil machine that night.",

I think this might have been the nicest restaurant I have ever been to in comparison to some of the more upscale restaurants in New York. However, this review doesn't do it justice. You need to experience this for yourself.  The views were 360 meaning the restaurant spun around the whole time you were dining and occasionally you would see people doing the sky jump which was pretty entertaining. For dinner, my friend and I ordered the prefix tasting menu which was great. It included an appetizer, entree, and a dessert of your choice. We also ordered a few glasses of wine. Everything was so delicious, but the views were just impeccable. The bill for 2 came out to be around $250 with tip. I think this experience was definitely worth every penny. Hopefully next time I'll be able to get a window seat!   PLEASE GO if you haven't yet!",

Definitely a really romantic place!   The eating area slowly revolves, so you are sure to see all of Vegas in a 360 view at least once during your meal. I would recommend going at night because those Las Vegas lights are stunning.   I had the lobster bisque and seafood Alfredo and my boyfriend had the steak. The bisque was amazing, but my Alfredo left a little to be desired with flavor. The seafood used in my plate was really fresh though. My boyfriend's steak was a little over cooked but the side of twice baked potato he had was amazing!   It was pretty pricey and I really think you are paying for the view, not really the food. But I do think it's something you have to do at least once!",

I made the reservation for myself and my husband about a week before and requested a window table . When the host came to seat us she said there was a 45 min wait for a window table and offered us a table that would still offer a great view . However, I decided  to wait the 45 min for the window since I knew I would likely never get to experience such a cool way to dine anytime soon . Luckily for us, a window table opened within 5 minutes !  The view of Vegas from that height with all the shimmering lights was spectacular. I loved how the scenery changed as we were served , I was actually mesmerized . The waiter was very knowledgeable and kind although did seem a bit rushed . I ordered a steak with twice baked potatoes and broccolini  and the wine suggested on the menu . The food was absolutely delicious !!!  If I ever return to Vegas I would certainly return to this place for the great food and the unique dining  experience . Give it a try, you will not be disappointed!",

A cab ride from the Monte Carlo cost us $50 so I walked in feeling like I had already spent too much money.   We arrived in time for happy hour at the bar, but it was only for cocktails, not wine, which was disappointing.  We had a table by the window which was great as the views are spectacular.   We even were able to see people bungy jumping off the top.    We both started with the lobster bisque soup which was wonderful.   Loads of flavor and actually some ground up lobster.  It was so filling, I could have stopped there.     They had a pasta option which I had never heard of.   Surf and Turf, which was lobster gnocchi and a braised beef.     The lobster chunks were large and tasty.   The gnocchi was way overcooked, but the sauce was very good.   The beef was super tender and the sauce was very good.    My husband had real surf and turf of filet mignon and crab legs.    The crab legs were already split and he said they were some of the best he ever had.  He could only finish half the filet.   We were both stuffed.  Our server was very helpful and knowledgeable of the menu.   Yes, we had a great meal, and the views are awesome, but I think it's a bit overpriced.  I could have had dinner (and enjoyed it just as well) for 3-4 nights, for what we paid here.",

I was excited to see the view and have a nice romantic dinner. The view was beautiful but the movement of the restaurant almost made me sick. We both decided on the chef's special 4 course meal and I added the wine pairing. The lobster bisque was just okay. Weird sweet taste to it.  Next course for me was a scallop. It was just okay too. A little chewy. Hubs had the pork belly. He said it was just alright. Next for the main course we both got surf and turf. It was offered with shrimp but could upgrade to lobster for another $10 so we both did that. Glad we did because that was the best part of the meal. Hubs upgraded his steak and he liked it. Mine was not good at all. Had a nasty mushroom gravy on it and I only could eat a few bites. The dessert was good. The wine pairing was good. I really enjoyed all of the wines. But for $300 total bill go somewhere else. Totally not worth it.",

Be prepared to take off all metal items before getting on the elevator [annoying!].  The view was lovely and rotated over our lunch experience. Watching the sky-jumpers was highly entertaining.  The pre-meal bread came with three lovely flavored butters, yay! (pesto, regular butter, and tangerine flavors)  I ordered the lobster bisque and sea bass. The bisque was acceptable tasting (not better than Target's lobster bisque) but the sea bass was NOT. It was a cheap cut of fish, not real sea bass, OUTRAGEOUS! Not what they showed in the pictures at the reservation desk. Fishy tasting in a bad way. :( !!!  I also tried the salmon and lobster mac and cheese from others at my table; those were nice and delicious. Burgers also a good choice here.  Service was average from the waitstaff.  Elevator attendant told us afterwards the restaurant experience came with observation deck time, above the restaurant - wish we had known. ----- In summary, DOT NOT GET THE SEA BASS but there are other palatable options. The view was great, and it is a better value to eat here and go up the private elevator than to just buy an observation deck pass.",

My motto is if you are going to go out, go all out and don't hold back.  The food is awesome, the wine selection is really good, and the atmosphere is cool.  Also like the gradual rotation.  The only sad thing for me is that the last time I went they had removed the tower of chocolate from the dessert menu.  It was one of the high points for us when we went the first time because it's a need little model of the stratosphere made of different types of chocolate.  That was the only dissapointment.  I recommend the lobster bisque, potatos au gratin, lamb chops, and ravioli (I think lobster or shrimp filled).",

The view is great, as the restaurant spins while you eat an you get a 360 view of Vegas. don't worry, you won't get motion sickness, you can't even tell its spinning.  The food was not up to par though. We had wine, appetizer, entree, and dessert. The bill was close to $300 and not worth it. I don't remember what we had for appetizer (see, that's how unmemorable it was) but my entree was duck. Bland. My boyfriend ordered a steak and he did not enjoy it either.   They also take a picture for you at your table and it costs $60 to buy it. I'm a sucker for that kind of stuff, so I went ahead and purchased it. It came with a frame and 2 more wallet sized photos. Shouldn't have costed $60, but ah well, it's Vegas.",

We planned it so we would be able to watch the sun come down, which was just gorgeous! There was people doing the bungee jumping, and it was really fun to watch them fly by the windows.    For my meal, I started off with lobster bisque soup, which was delicious. The waiter brought me a bowl full of lobster meat, and pouring in the cream in front of me. The second course was a sea bass on bok choy, very fresh. My main course I chose the was a steak, which was amazing. The dessert was almost too much. They brought each of us a plate of 4 different mini desserts. I couldn't even eat it all, despite how tasty it was.   Our waiter was very friendly, on top of his job. My only complaint is I kept getting lost finding the bathroom lol. But other then that, amazing food and experience!",

The fellow in the elevator was quite comical as was the man that was the busser for the table. Our waitress was okay, nothing out of the ordinary unfortunately. I like to think I am particular about my food and being that I'm Indian I am not willing to spend large amounts of money (or even allow someone to spend such money on me) on mediocre food. However, the food here was amazing! I started with a salad and had a vegetarian dish for my main course. The food had so much flavor! I was so surprised, it was so tasty!. My boyfriend also started with a salad and had a seafood alfredo dish for his main course. He loved it and devoured it within minutes. Who can forget the amazing view?! We watched the sunset over the city/valley. The restaurant was quite and intimate, the booth was spacious and I spent the evening with my lovely boyfriend and had a fantastic experience. I would definitely frequent this restaurant again in the future.  I am taking a star off because the waitress was lacking personality. If you make a substantial tip regardless, I expect a little bit of happiness out of you. The manager or owner was greeting all of the tables, which I thought was a wise business tactic. He complimented my boyfriend and myself. Although this was lovely, he used the same line on the next table; which was fine, but at least use mix it up bro. Maybe I'm being too picky, but I used to work in the restaurant/hospitality industry; so I might as well be picky (:  All in all, I would recommend this restaurant for the grandeur food, breathtaking view, and lovely experience!",

FUN: 1.go up to the observation deck at the stratosphere (Which alone costs $16) to see people do sky jumping.  2.Photographers will take photos of you at the restaurant.

Lobster bisque tasted nothing like the bisque I ate before. It tasted like pumpkin pie filling. When asked waiter he said the chef adds allspice in it. I sent it back and got potato soup instead, which was OK. We did get charged for the bisque though.  My husband got ribeye and it was greasy and tough. My skirt steak was good, when we were ordering the waiter didn't tell us that the ribeye came with caramelized carrots and the skirt steak came with green beans. He offered us baked potato and mushrooms. We knew nothing about the size of the portions. There was too much food. If I knew my steak was going to include green beans I wouldn't have ordered the mushrooms. Our daughter ordered lobster Thermidor and it was good.  The view was breathtaking and we paid for it. We've dined at fancy restaurants before with the views and paid a lot of money for dinners but at least the food was worth the money. This restaurant's food was not. I would not recommend this restaurant.",

Well look no further this is the spot you have a 360 view of Las Vegas and for food I recommend if taking a date order two filet mignon and just one order of baked potato with everything on it and trust me it will be a night to remember. Also go on the Internet and find out what time the sun will set that day and make reservations for half an hour before that way when your up there you guys can have a view like no other.",

The Top of The World Restaurant  We went here to celebrate our 5 year wedding anniversary at sunset. The same time we got married. This was one of the very best dining experiences we have had in Vegas. Of course you can't beat the view....that's a given. The food, however, is to die for! I've never had a baked potato as huge as the one that came as a side with our dinner! I ordered the Fettuccine Seafood Alfredo with Lobster, Prawns & Scallops. My husband ordered the New York Steak with Brandy Peppercorn sauce. We both could not believe how great this meal was. I mean, it's Vegas.....and everything is so over priced! But, here we found a pricey meal that was worth every single penny! So yummy!  We will be back to visit the Top of the World very soon! We love good food, great views & of course the memory of our beautiful wedding.",

    "text": "We went to dinner at the Stratosphere with our two teenagers. As you can see from any photo on the place, the views are unbelieveable and the rotating experience, especially at sunset, are unparalleled. So, it would be easy for the Strat to rely on its iconic views of Las Vegas and neglect the food and service. Surprisingly, both the food and the service are superb.  Our waiter, Max, was a True dining professional and guided us seamlessly through the experience in ways we didn't even realize we needing guiding. For example, he told us when to expect the \"sky jumpers\" to appear before us, how to prepare our camera for the best photo and more. He seemed to be working with an experienced serving team that anticipated our every need.  I got the tasting menu with filet mignon and it was devine. Daughter got the seafood pasta and is still talking about it. Max even got my 15 year old French fries that were not on the menu and allowed him to share my filet with me.  The reason that this isn't 5 stars is not the Stratosphere's fault. I hadn't realized how much I am afraid of heights until dining at the top of 106 floors. Being this high up was actually very stressful and watching the sky fallers jump past our window every few minutes for the entire meal was kind of terrifying. When Max told us we could go upstairs to the open air viewing platform as part of our meal, my husband and daughter eagerly went up to take in the views outdoors, while my son and I waited inside. So while the dinner and service were impeccable, I realize that sky top dining is probably not for me.",

From our greeting by the host staff to our server, everyone was awesome, acknowledging our special night.   We were slightly disappointed that our table was not right along the window, however we had a more spacious booth seat, and the window seating is a bit chilly in March.  The meal was equally as awesome, we both indulged in the Lobster Bisque, it was creamy and wonderful. In hindsight, we could have split a bowl, as we both were so full half way through our entree we determined that we could not possibly order a dessert. Fortunately, the Top of The World took care of us with a celebratory little chocolate cake which was perfect. Delicate, yet rich and perfectly sweet to end the dinner.   We went up to the outdoor observation floor and marveled at the view. Watching the people on the various thrill rides was fun as well.",

    "text": "What a colossal let down this place was. From beginning to end. My boyfriend proposed just prior to dinner here, so it really wasn't going to take a lot to impress me. I was so far on cloud 9 that literally everything would have to go wrong for me to hate this place.    Short version: don't waste your time or money.    I did my research before choosing eat here, so I knew what to expect. A great view with mediocre food. I knew we were paying for the view.    My fiance (that's weird!) booked a reservation through Open Table and followed up with emails to Top of the World staff to confirm a window seat for dinner. All was set... Except when we got there we did not have a window seat. Not a huge deal, but when I have already accepted I might be sacrificing food quality for ambiance, I want the unobstructed view!   They quoted us 20 minutes to get a window seat, so we killed time in the bar upstairs where we were promptly ignored. 20 minutes turned into 50 minutes. I get that's not their fault. But, had they not messed up in the first place this wouldn't have happened. We had reservations after dinner so their mess up put up back one hour and we had  to rush through dinner.  If they had been more honest with their quote time, we wouldn't have waited.  Who wants to spend over $250 on dinner and rush through it?  We finally sit down for dinner and both order the $70 steaks, medium well. For $70...it should come out as requested. Mine was rare. So obviously rare to anyone who even looked at it. I sent it back and knew it would come back like leather, which it did. So disappointing.   At that point not even a view of the strip could salvage the meal.   Definitely not going back, and would only recommend this place if you actually enjoy throwing your money away.",

ALSO, they search you before you go up into the elevator to get to the restaurant.  Like go through a metal detector search. And look in your purse search---frist time for everything!  They also require you to be DRESSED nice, group of 8 before us, the men were in t-shirts, no dice, wouldn't sit them. So keep that in mind",

    "text": "I have to admit, I came here for the view. The restaurant is on the 109th floor with a slowly rotating floor that shows the entire 360 degrees view of Vegas in all it's glory. There is also a bar one floor above. Plus you get free entrance to the observation deck afterwards. I didn't have high expectations of the food and figured it would be overpriced for the quality. It turned out as I expected but the food tasted slightly better than expectations. I came here twice so far, once for brunch and tonight, I came for dinner.   With the view, I give this restaurant 4 stars. If without the view, I'd give it 2.5 stars.   Let's start with the decor:  I'm not sure how I should comment. The walls are painted a navy blue color with stars. It looks much more elegant at night time than day time since everything becomes dimly light. I remember coming here for lunch and thought I walked in to a casual diner called Saturn. Night time, it looks a bit more elegant. I still wouldn't consider it very sophisticated but it looks much better. Does it matter what the decor looks like? Not really. Who's looking if you have such a nice view of VEGAS.   Let's get to the juicy stuff. The food (dinner):   Bread- thought it deserves a comment. This bread basket is pretty good. Comes with three flavors of butter cream. You get an assortment of breads. Great start to the meal.   Lobster Bisque- The lobster bisque has a nice and creamy texture with fairly decent bits of lobster. Flavors are there, except too much salt. I personally did find it a bit too salty for my liking so I thought it was just fair.   Seared Jumbo Lump Crab Cake- A decent sized crab cake with lumps of crab and shreds of radish. The crab cake was a bit mushy. Not much of flavor.   Organic Aspen Ridge Ribeye with Horseradish Crust and Demi Glace (medium rare)- This ribeye turned out to be pretty good. Glad we decided on medium rare because I suspect it would become too chewy if ordered medium or they might overcook it. They do put the horseradish on top and cook it into a crust. I'm personally not a fan of horseradish as I think it masks the flavor of the ribeye. I asked it to be a thin and light layer of horseradish. Turned out to be pretty good. Came with tiny carrots.   Large Mexican Prawns, New England Scallops & Lobster a la Plancha- This dish came with successes and fails. The scallops were nice and tender. I am a big fan of scallops and eat it a lot so I was happy taking a bite into this. It was cooked thoroughly but not overcooked. The prawns were plain under cooked and slightly blue at the bottom. It was pretty gross. The lobster was decent. Some bits were juicy and succulent and other parts were a bit dry. I suspect uneven cooking.   Did not order desserts this time. I did have the banana foster last time. I thought it was decent but nothing amazing. It looked pretty cool, like some crazy tower of deliciousness. However, it failed in terms of taste.   Service was a hit or miss. Last time, I came for lunch and the lady serving us was amazing. I give her two thumbs up. Tonight, my server was a man who barely paid attention to us. I was not too happy with that. He kept on kissing up to the table with party of 6 next to us. Barely came by even if we needed something. I give him 4 thumbs DOWN.  Go up to the observation deck after dinner. Walk around and burn off some of the calories you consumed. Watch some of the bungee jumpers scream like little girls. Go outside. It's nice and breezy. You get the entire view of Vegas and won't have to take photos through a glass window.  Would I come here again? Yeah, probably once in a while. I enjoy the view. This place is only worth it if you go up to the observation deck. The food is overpriced but you do get free entrance to the observation deck.",

Looking through the menu, I glanced at their lunch specials and chose the Grilled Cheese Frenchie. Now my feeling was that $25? Really? How good can it be? Well judging by the picture you can see that this restaurant doesn't mess around. A delicious blend of decadent cheese and tomatoes, it tastes a bit like Alfredo pasta with bacon for good. If you don't mind paying a little because it is Vegas after all with a killer view even in the afternoon. You can't go wrong with this restaurant.",

Miles & miles of views care of the 1,000 feet elevation Foie gras w/rabbit Filet mignon Creme brule w/berries  Add martinis & a glass of red wine and you'll end up with the reasonable, family-friendly cost of $200 including tip.

    "text": "*This has been a draft since October.. delayed. My apologies.  The group is us made reservations, they gave us an early time because they said they were booked later on in the evening.  We got there for 530 and spent just about an hour an a half there.  They were not booked through that time however we did appreciate that it was revolving through at sunset so it worked out just fine and realized if we were given a later time we would not have got to see the sights as we rotated.  You check in and head toward a small security station where you either get patted down or bag searched and walk through a metal detector.  This to me was a little strange, if I'm going up to this $60+ a head meal not including drinks and sides mind you, I really don't feel like I should have to be body searched to do so.  That, was disheartening.  They told us on the phone that they can turn people away about what people wear, we got really dressed up and we were very well expecting the rest of the restaurant to also be fancy.  The people that were ahead of us were certainly far from dressed up and they still allowed them to get in the place.  Classin' up the joint, eyy.   We got in the elevator and shot up while the attendant spat his speech, he was great except too scripted but perfectly timed.  We were seated and had a wonderful view.  The actual views alone are great, everything else isn't.  The menu was fine but the price was ridiculous and none of us left raving about our meals. I got the pasta with shrimp, scallops and lobster.  I got that because it was really the only dish with a variety.  All the other dishes were expensive but didn't come with sides, those had to be purchased separately, and the pasta and fish was a good combo.  Our waiter was a hoot, he was really nice and helpful.  He had some funny one liners and was knowledgeable about Vegas history.  He also reminded me of a theatrical voice where I just wanted him to keep talking, he reminded me of a narrator of a play or story.  The way this place rotates is really cool.  I feel like the food was just mediocre for the price but the atmosphere is really what we paid for, I wouldn't go again though the next time I go to Vegas, once was enough.",

The night is the best with the lights, It is really beautiful, Your up so high like your in a plane!!! Before you come I recommend making reservations so you can be sure to get in because this place does get busy. This is truly a dining experience. From the moment you arrive, till you leave. The food is amazing no matter what we have ordered here it is always so good.  I always have the lobster bisque soup. It is really delicious! Has to be one of the best in town. Anyone who does not have a wonderful dining experience here is crazy. They are always consistent.  This is a place to go for a dining experience or special occasion.  Make sure what the dress code is because I think lunch is a little more casual. Once your done with lunch or dinner you can go to check out the view in the observatory. You can take pictures there and visit some of the shops. Taking the elevator back down seems to go pretty fast for being up so high. All I can say is try this place for yourself. It is not cheap by no means. Your paying for the wonderful dining experience you will have as well as the amazing food you will get,",

    "text": "We flew to Vegas and landed on the Top of the World!   My boyfriend and I had a double date here with my best and her bf and all four of us were excited to see what this place was about, neither of us tried it, so we were ready to eat and enjoy the amazing views.  Located at the very top of the stratosphere, which is also a hotel with shops and tons of restaurants, it's off the strip but in no way does it keep you from seeing the lights and beauty of the strip.    You can easily make reservations here online which is very convenient. We were seated promptly and the hostess was sweet and friendly.  Our waiter came by and seemed like he was in a grumpy mood.  Now, out of all the good things I wish to share with you about this restaurant, our waiter was a major downer, he was sarcastic, seemed irritated when asked if he could take our picture, and couldn't answer my friend nicely when asked where the salmon was from. He didn't even know where it was from.  He made us want to leave and skip dessert.  =( skip dessert?!?! -----something I ALWAYS make room for.    Anyways, like all the other reviews the revolving restaurant feature is pretty darn cool.  What's even cooler, is the fact that you can see people bungee jumping off of one sides of the top building.  Now, that's definitely something I'd like to do in the future.    The food was delish!  The only exception was the truffle mac & cheese.  It had a weird texture and I found it to be heavy and reminded me of lima beans, strange.  I ordered the salmon which came with mushrooms and mashed potatoes.  This was DIVINE.  I loved every bite and wished i could have chowed down the whole thing, unfortunately my stomach told me to stop putting food in my mouth, before getting sick.  The bf ordered the lobster pasta which he enjoyed so much he ate almost everything.  My best and her boyfriend enjoyed their meals as well.    Basically the food here is absolutely worth a try, the views will set the mood for a romantic date night or double date night, and watching the bungee jumpers will be a great conversation starter.  Just hope you have a different waiter from us.  ENJOY!   #Yelp 365 - 01/365",

Sometimes you would even see a bungee jumper flying over the side and down.  The food was not bad, but not as good as it could have been.  My scallops were raw in the middle, and my creme brulee was cold, and not fresh.  I like my flaming when it comes out, not taken out of the fridge.  The breads and butter spreads are very tasty, my salad was perfect.  The poor waiter struggled to help my poor wife who has several allergies.  In stead of the chef coming out, or the manager, the waiter would make a mistake and we would have to wait for a new dish to come out.  This happened all night, and in the end, she became sick due to contamination.  If I had to do it again I should have asked for the chef to come out.  I heard several staff members behind us complain about working here, and one of the managers reprimand a staff member, which was very unprofessional.  And finally they have employees whose only job it is, is to take pictures of the customers, and try to sale you a photography package.  Who wants a photograph of them at the dinner table?  Strange.",

Usually restaurants that have a gimmicky atmosphere have subpar food. Oh boy did the food here blow other restaurants out of the water! We ordered the rack of lamb and one 4 course meal to share.  The staff was friendly and attentive. They gave us recommendations on what to order and advised perfectly.   We started with bread, which was AMAZING! It was fresh and came with 3 flavored butters. The orange one was my favorite!   Lobster Bisque - oh so tasty and filled with lobster. Waiter served it table side to show how much lobster is actually in the bisque.  Branzino - perfectly seared and delicious!  Steak - perfectly cooked as we asked and tasty, but the rack of lamb seriously outshined this.  Rack of Lamb - absolutely orgasmic!!!! I started with this while the hubs ate the steak so we could switch off and I told him I needed to finish with this. The mint sauce was great and we each had 2 pieces. A very generous portion.  Dessert that came with the 4 course meal was good, but seriously that rack of lamb. Mmmmmm!  At one point during dinner you rotate to where bungee jumpers are falling from above (keep in mind we are on the 107th(?) floor). It's pretty entertaining.  We went out to the observation deck after dinner and it was a great way to end the night. Worth every penny. Wonderful service, atmosphere and food!",

I ordered the seafood Alfredo ($59) and Caesar salad ($15) and it wasn't good at all. It had a weird taste I can't even explain. My friend ordered the same and agreed with me. We also ordered a side of mushrooms to share but they were burnt and returned them. Food took long enough we didn't want to wait for just mushrooms. Everyone else didn't like their food either. You'd think if you're putting out $100 on food it would be phenomenal. I understand you're paying for the view also butttt yeah no. The only thing we all did enjoy was the different infused butters that was complementary with bread. ALSO the walk to get there is RIDICULOUS. You have to walk thro the casino then around a extremely long mall just to get to the elevator for the restaurant. LADIES I REPEAT DONT WEAR HEELS ON THIS VENTURE. The walk was about 10 mins which is absurd.   Also you go thro a metal detector before the elevator. Which is very weird but it became the norm while in Vegas. Everything was metal detectors, pat downs or purse searches.   So the view and butter were the only positives.",

It's not at all unusual for a dinner for two costing around $200, so save your pennies.  The TOTW was chosen one year, when the governors of all 50 states were meeting here in Las Vegas.  Can you imagine the entire states' leadership in one location, 800 feet above the ground?  The view is spectacular (see the attached photos), the food is sensational, and the service is terrific.  What more do you need?  The restaurant \"spins\" at a speed where one complete revolution takes approximately one hour, and my social engagements there averaged \"two complete spins.\"  There is also a unique kind of \"optical illusion\" that is experienced while you're dining there, but it isn't mentioned all that much.  As you're seated and eating, watching your scenery constantly changing before you, you come to believe that you are in some kind of \"flying saucer,\" HOVERING over the city.  You don't think of yourself as being in a building; you feel that you might be aboard some sort of an aircraft, which actually adds to your enjoyment.  (Another way to truly enjoy your visit, is to pay for it with your company's expense account.)  Just one bit of advice or \"admonishment\" from me, if you please...  If you are one of those folks who will probably go there only ONCE during your lifetime, let me suggest that you go only at night (to get the most from your visit), and that afterwards, you go up to the next level to have your after-dinner drinks in their \"stationary\" cocktail lounge.",

    "text": "We came here last Monday night to celebrate my birthday we originally made reservations for 715 but we had difficulties with Uber trying to get here and this restaurant is way way way in the back of the hotel so we ended up getting there around eight but we only waited for about 15 minutes or so before we were seated! You have to go through a metal detector before entering the elevators which is strange for a restaurant but we waited longer for the elevator to come get us and we did to be seated they have a person in each elevator because they are confusing I guess anyhow we were seated not directly next to the window but one table over so we still were able to get an excellent view.. I know this is a place for the great experience and I was kind of hesitant to eat dinner here because of all the negative reviews but I can honestly say we had a pleasant experience I had a margarita  and started off with a Caesar salad my husband had the soup of the night which was cream of chicken and he said it was great I'm not much of a meat eater but I did have a few bites of my husbands 9 ounce filet that was absolutely perfect!!  We also split the mashed Yukon Gold potatoes and sauteed mushrooms which were also good.  Our waiter was excellent I feel bad I can't remember his name but he was very attentive and checked on us Sevral times. We did not have dessert because we were way too full although I've never been to a restaurant that doesn't offer a free birthday dessert but I did not make a big deal of it because like I said we were too full to eat dessert anyway after our dinner he told us we could go up one floor to the observation deck which was gorgeous it was such an amazing view we had a good experience here overall!",

    "text": "So, we planned my wife's birthday dinner at Top of the World restaurant at the Stratosphere. Even after reading mixed reviews I hoped for the best, but sadly was disappointed.  We walked through the (and I'm being nice) dated stratosphere hotel and casino (think late 80's Vegas), up to the area where the elevator was. We had to go through a metal detector to get to the elevator, and were asked repeatedly if we were going to the club or the restaurant.  We got to the top to be seated by a nice hostess. The initial view of the strip is impressive, and then you start seeing the sad parts of Las Vegas :-(.  Our server introduced himself and that was the last we saw of him. After seeing the prices the restaurant was charging then looking around at the dated atmosphere, the poorly maintained inside of the restaurant and the lack of service, we left.  I write this review as I sit eating my salad at Lawry's and celebrating my (much happier) wife's birthday dinner.  Long story short, view is neat, but definitely not worth dinner.  . . Go to Lowry's Prime Rib instead :-)",

We got there right as the sun was setting and it was really great. The view made up for having to go to the stratosphere (which is kind of a dump). We had the creme brulee and it was hands down the best one I've ever had. If this was a restaurant in another city I would probably give 4 or 5 stars, but since vegas has SO many amazing places to eat this falls a little short in my opinion.",

Our waiter Bon was super helpful, friendly and entertaining.  The entire staff was engaged with us and the others from the security screener to the elevator operators.   We shared the tomato, buffalo mozzarella, grilled pepper and Portabello appetizer with herb oil and balsamic redux dressing along with an assortment of freshly baked bread.  My boyfriend enjoyed the Surf and turf done perfectly while I experienced the well balanced and seasoned Vegetarian plate.  The big finish after watching the desert tray from our first full 360 degree location was the Chocolate lovers delight.     The food, wine and service was not only outstanding but, the best I've ever experienced.  As a local, I now wonder what took us so long to come see for ourselves what all the talk was about.  I'm breathless from the view and watching the sun set was an added bonus.  We will return and I highly recommend, and I don't use that word lightly, others see for themselves.",

It is incomprehensible that this place manages to stay open given all of the great restaurants in Las Vegas.  $44 for a piece of uninspired chicken topped with a sweet sauce that you'd expect to find in a coffee shop.  Same for the wedge salad.  And fois gras paired with white chocolate?!  Friendly but inept service.  But, hey, a nice view.",

    "text": "For the most part my vegas eating occurs around what we're planning to do... so when skyjump became a \"must do\" we found this place.   We have a 360 restaurant at home so the novelty of the concept didn't speak to us.  I knew the view in the day is alright and, although vegas has a nice night view,  it's not really taking advantage of the revolving dining experience even to the extent of the one back home.   So we decided we'd like a 360 dinner at sunset followed by a night jump as I love my sunsets.   We carefully planned out the sunset timing and set the reservation so we'd see the best of it while we ate and still had darkness for the jump.  We made a few calls to the restaurant to confirm a window seat and I was looking forward to the vegan menu item they have that sounded yummy.  This was near the tail end of our trip so we'd been looking forward to it for a while and   i'm sad to say we actually left without eating because I got so upset before we got that far.   I tend to expect that when I make a reservation,  I can show up 10 minutes before and be seated by the time I booked.  Especially in a place such as this.   Well...   we waited for some time at the bottom hostess as she talked to non-dinners and left us waiting there.   We have heard that when skyjump first opened people were terrified of the jumpers out the window resulting in upset, broken plates and wine down the wrong pipe for many dinners so The Top of World started to tell dinners about the jumpers long before they sat at tables.  In this case the lovely elevator man informed us that jumps had been all canceled due to wind so we WOULDN'T see jumpers over our meal.    Wow,  bummer considering we had a jump reservation and hadn't been told this yet...  So we  arrived at the top a little bummed and was met and subsequently ignored by a cold hostess that made us feel like an inconvenience.   Other than greeting people at the elevator,  I'm not sure what else she was suppose to be so busy doing that set our priority way down... Eventually we're addressed and at the end of the interaction she set our menus aside with no further conversation and we piece together we were waiting for someone to come seat us.   Well... we wait.. and wait... and the hostess is just sanding there in an empty foyer with just the 3 of us not talking to us or explaining away the hold up.  Eventually someone who I don't believe normally seats people noticed us and rushed to seat us - alas a turn around to the evening?  No... we've been placed at a non-window seat despite 3 requests!   We said we asked for a window and could see 3 such empty window tables sitting there and was told they were for other people but we could wait for one to be available or just eat now away from the window.  We opt to wait for the window.   We're lead back to the cold hostess and we're told 20 -30 minutes for a window seat  (interestingly enough we're still the only party waiting for a table)  so we waited a bit and could eventually see the sunset disappear from sight via an obstructed view across the building.    I'm pretty upset the sunset is gone, the service was dismal,  the jump was canceled AND no one has even called to notify us of the jump cancelation even 30 minutes after we found out from the restaurant.  Frankly by that point I lacked the motivation to shell out $100+ p/p for a diner I felt too grumpy to enjoy... and so we left.  Honestly I'm unsure I'll ever be back... maybe next trip we'll try again with both elements but the upset is too fresh in my mind to say.   This place is REALLY far away from everything and the area it's situated in very seedy...  I'm glad we didn't walk it in the dark to say the least.",

    "text": "I wound up here completely by chance.  It all began with a last minute Hotwire reservation that put me at the Stratosphere hotel for a night (I was extending my stay in town for a day, and rooms were hard to come by).  Checking in mid afternoon, a very nice Guatemalan girl at reception gave me a voucher for my choice of a free drink (champagne or bloody mary) or a free ceviche at the Top of the World Restaurant located at the very top of the hotel.  The voucher even had a detailed recipe for the ceviche on the back, and it looked delicious.  I was famished and even though it was mid-afternoon I could still make it for lunch.  So off I went.  I should probably begin by describing the view.  That is obviously the clear draw of this restaurant.  The main floor is encircled by windows that extend down to the floor and allow, collectively, a 360 degree, panoramic view of the desert floor below.  While the view was very impressive, I thought initially, that where I was seated would determine how good my view actually was.  The designers of the restaurant, of course, thought about this.  Their creative solution?  Make the restaurant revolve!  That's right, in the course of an hour, you will make a full spin, so everyone will be guaranteed a private minute with the best vantage point of the Strip lying below.  Genius.  It was probably the only time I used my camera in a restaurant for taking pictures of something other than the food.  If that were not enough, you will occasionally witness bodies dropping past your window, hurtling downward to a most certain death only to be granted a reprieve at the very last moment.  Some sort of macabre activity called a SkyJump.  I was pretty pleased with all of this.  I was able to see Las Vegas in a way that I never saw it before, so it really transcended the level of being a gimmick.  I was happy I went here for lunch.    So, what about that lunch?  Well, I opted for the free ceviche and additionally ordered a po boy.  The ceviche, for all of the hype and glossy advertisement, was singularly disappointing.  A lone jumbo shrimp in a shot glass of spicy sauce.  There were no implements to assist in eating this, so one could only dip the shrimp in the sauce and eat it directly -- not exactly a ceviche.  More like a step up from shrimp cocktail, but the flavor profile of the dipping sauce was not particularly memorable.  The sandwich was considerably better though.  The portion size was especially large, and the flavor was clear and consistent throughout.  The ingredients were of good quality, and I was pleased with the texture.  Even the shoestring fries were good.  So they redeemed themselves.     Between my comfort food, my glass of white wine, and the extraordinary views, I had a grand time making my way through a lazy afternoon.  Highly recommend going at least once for the view.  A more economical option is to go for lunch rather than dinner, since the view is the same.  The food seems to be generally good, but it's not the biggest draw as one can certainly eat better elsewhere on the Strip.  Overall, 4 stars. (slightly less if there was no view)",

There are better restaurants out there. The waiter are also not attentive. It took them forever to come to place our order and they hardly check up on you after ordering. I recommend this restaurant for people who wants to bring their family, but not on a date because although the view is breathtaking, the service and food us mediocre. They also offer photo taking, and it is charged pretty expensive. Oh yeah, 1 more thing, since the restaurant rotates, the lighting of the restaurant also changes.

And of course there's the view, absolutely exquisite, and after about 20 mins I stopped noticing the tower rotations.

What's unique about this restaurant is the fact it sits high above the strip and offers views of all directions because the restaurant continuously rotates (very slowly) while you are enjoying your meal.  I will warn that if you don't like motion, you may have a problem with the motion despite the fact it turns very slowly.  I was initially sitting backwards; but, had to switch places with my wife as I was becoming slightly nauseated.  My wife and I both ordered sandwiches which came promptly and were good.  The portions were average and overall the prices was much higher than what you expect to pay for the same meal at another restaurant.  The two sandwiches and sodas came to $60 after tip.  Honestly, if you're looking for a good similar quality lunch, you can find it priced about 1/2 of what the Stratosphere charges.  It's clear they are charging a premium price for the food due to the view.   That said, we were not disappointed.  The service and ambiance was excellent so were willing to pay a premium for the meal.",

Went here for 4th of july right before sunset...the view is amazing...and just when it got dark we saw all of the fireworks going off all over...you get to see the people jumping off from the rooftop as well....  I ordered the Surf and Turf with 10 oz steak with mexican prawns...MMMMm it was sooooo good!!! My girlfried ordered the California Free Range Chicken Breast filled with Three Cheese Fondue....Sooooo 'Not Good\" it tasted gross...the fondue inside tasted like burnt rubber...  the chocolate martinis where to die for...  Its a very nice romantic restaurant...I mean if your going out to a fancy restaurant expect to pay more than $100 dollars for your meal...if you dont want to spend alot dont go to a fancy restaurant..  It's worth it...:)",

Our server was superb, with our first time visit, I wish I would of remember his name but I forgot so bummer. Anyway it was such a fantastic view especially for me I enoyed it because I'm usually scared of height, but didn't stop me. We ordered our food and we ordered one thing off the menu because we wanted to share. We didn't say anything to our server that if they could split the food for us because we were just going to split it ourself but he did the most incredible thing and told the chef if could split the food into two plates. How generous he was serving it to me and my girlfriend. It made us feel special as a customer to the resturant. At the end he gave us a free little chocolate brownie as a little celebration with two candles for both of us to blow on. Our server went above and beyond our experience, hopefully everyone else does too because we sure will come back here again.   While we waited there was this women going around taking picture of people and when she got to our table she took pictures of us. At the end she made you take a look of the picture if you wanted any of it  Ofcouse the picture werent free so it made you have a choice if you wanted it or not. Surely we did buy the picture because they look amazing and keep them for memories. They werent cheap but werent expensive as well. So buy them as for memories.  Next time we go here we want to go during the night time because you could see all the light around Vegas. Takes 1 hour and a half I think for the whole thing to go around so you could see everything. Great experience, couldnt have spend it more!  05-14-16",

We had a private room that was decorated very elegantly and had our own private server and bartender.  The views were outstanding, especially at night as you can see practically all of Las Vegas lit up and also people bungee jumping.    Anyways, on to the food.    Appetizer: Lobster bisque and garden salad.  The bisque was thick and tasty.  The salad was okay, but had very nice dressing.  Entree: Filet mignon with some greens.  I asked for it medium rare and it was cooked perfectly. It was like 12 to 14 oz.  I loved it!  I usually can finish all my meals, but I definitely struggled with this one and if it wasn't a corporate dinner, I probably would have taken it home.  Dessert: Dessert trio.  I can't really say, because I'm not a sweets person, but they looked pretty.  Overall, this place has a great view and a great food and the positive reviews speak for itself.",

Before going up to the restaurant they do require full search of body & belongings for safety measures. They accommodated us for the best seat we could have asked for. We were pleased by the experience especially the view of Vegas skyline. The food was delicious and as well as dessert.  Steak was prime to taste but could use sharper knives at least. Ordered wife the wagyu steak and lobster tail and cooked to perfection and her favorite twice big baked potatoe and it was big alright. I ordered the Kansas New York boned in steak and scampi with side button mushrooms. There's complimentary breads and butters pesto, original and citrus we loved the pesto and citrus flavors. We also added a bottle of their monthly white wine as glasses weren't worth it don't finish tale it back with you. As you eat you spin 360 with out even noticing. You get photo shoots as well seperate packaging pay but reasonable to some degree. Overall, we loved the experience and coming back next time as we celebrated our anniversary this time. Remember to dress nicely for date night casual works just fine but for the price go dressy for the occasion. We'd loved it and enjoyed every moment of it can't wait for next time.",

We checked in and were pleasantly surprised that they sat us at a wonderful table by the window anyways, but it wouldn't have mattered. The entire place is set up so you have a spectacular view of Las Vegas, so never fear where your table is.  We both went with the tasting menu. Joey provided  excellent service, and his knowledge of the wine menu was impressively helpful. I had the lobster bisque that was very nice, and hearty at the same time. The scallop was amazing with the sauce. The filet melted away as I savored every bite.   Bottom line- amazing experience, amazing food, amazing service. It's easy to see why they've earned as many awards as they have.  P.S.- you can take as many pictures as you wish so long as you aren't disturbing other diners (like the Germans next to us who turned our table area into a studio).",

The place looked somewhat modern and very upscale. Wait staff was tremendous and knowledgeable about the menu. I had the Prime Ribeye Steak sandwich which consists of Caramelized onion, Peppadew aioli, cheddar, arugula, ciabatta bread. Amazing. All the flavors worked real nice together. The onions gave it a moist sweet taste which was nice against the dry cheddar. 10/10 would recommend again. It is pricey but you're paying for the view honestly which is more than worth it. Fellas take your girl here and guarantee you'll get a little more than a kiss goodnight. Only negative and it's not a huge deal but the dinning room rotates so you can see the whole view in the hour you spend there. It made me dizzy after a while. Other than that enjoy yourself!

The Chef and his team have done a remarkable job delivering quality and flavor for great value. You won't be disappointed.",

Plus with the view you can't complain and you'll randomly see bungee jumpers heading down.  For starters they brought out some bread with these awesome infused butters. First plate I had sea scallops omg they were to die for. Then the chef brought out pork belly with Chimchurri. Perfect combinations of flavor with every dish. On to my main course I had skirt steak and it was bombbbbbb af!   Lastly for dessert we had the triple chocolate cake. It was so rich and moist!  I will definitely be coming back here again because everything was so good and the chef was awesome.",

    "text": "Yes, the metal detector before the ride up was a little weird, but whatever, they do it as a precautionary measure since 9/11 because the stratosphere is one of the tallest buildings in Vegas (I asked).   ***the floor rotates 360 degrees in an hour, VERY slowly, if you're complaining about sea sickness and dizziness you've got a lot more issues than you think, I'd start with visiting a psychiatrist first. The view is spectacular and the jumpers really don't detract from dinner like all these other people have said, it's actually kinda cool to watch then fly by and the place rotates so it's not like they're in your way during dinner the ENTIRE time.  Moving on...  Our reservation was for 6:15, we checked in at 6:09 and they gave us a pager, they directed is to the 107 lounge upstairs where we ordered two most delicious dirty martinis, we waited maybe 10 minutes before our pager went off. Nothing ridiculous, it's a nice restaurant you might have to wait a moment, no big deal.  We were seated in the booth, which honestly  wasn't right next to the window but instead of having to turn our heads to enjoy the view we got to sit and look straight out; personally I think that was the best seat in the house.   Karen was our waitress; she was awesome, her recommendations were spot on! She was cheerful and checked on us frequently but not overly frequently, I hate when servers come back every 2 mins when you've got a mouthful. Haha.  What was ordered; Crab cakes, $19 for one  we ordered two and I think it was one of the best crab cakes I've ever had, if not the best!  Ordered lobster bisque soup, Karen kindly offered to split the soup for us, which was really nice, and honestly with a 4-course meal the portion was perfect, not too much, not too little and it tasted PHENOMENAL! It wasn't too salty had a slight almond flavor to it, it was just magnificent. By far the best lobster bisque I've had! Better than Ruth's Chris that's for certain.  My bf ordered the horseradish crusted ribeye...it was yummy, he ordered it MR and it came out a little more on the rare dude (Karen had suggested it cooked Medium before hand, but he didn't complain and still ate it, it was really yummy)  I ordered the filet, it was very tender and at first it was just okay, they had some mushroom sauce over it which personally I think it probably would've tastes better just plain with pepper and butter seasoning like most restaurants do, but as I got more toward the middle it got a lot better. I also had the paired cab with it, and that opened up really nicely.  Our sides: Potatoes au gratin - HEAVENLY! Button Mushrooms - Wow!  Dessert: Strawberries Romanoff- never had anything like it before but it was light and refreshing, perfect for after a heavy meal, absolutely delectable! It was my Bf's birthday so they brought him out a cute tiny flourless cake and that was orgasmic!  Coffee, a bit strong tasting to my liking, but my bf said it wasn't too bad, I had the espresso which was yummy and came with a rock candy to stir and sweeten the espresso, very cute.   They also had a photographer there that takes pictures...they're like $45 for two big photos. They came out very nice.   For such a fantastic meal and my BF ordering two beers through dinner as well, the bill only came to $250, and with tip $300 which I would gladly go back and pay again the next time I'm in Vegas. :)",

I've had better steak at Outback Steakhouse than what I had here tonight. Unfortunately I think this will be the last time we come here.",

When we arrived they had us sitting at a table that was not near the window. I asked if we could move and they did accompany us but we had to wait an extra half hour. Fair enough. The view was amazing and our waiter was very nice and attentive, however, the lady helping him was kind of stern and not as friendly. We requested bread with our meal. The salad was brought...but no bread. So we sat and stared at our salad, waiting for bread. Finally they brought bread and apologized for it taking so long. When it was time to bring the dinner plate, we asked for more bread. And we waited...and waited...and waited...and finally ate without bread. Just as we were taking our last few bites, the bread was brought - so we sent it back because dinner was finished by that point. What was kind of crazy is our waiter told us he asked his server (the stern lady) to bring us bread three times, but when she finally brought it, she said she didn't know we wanted bread - so one of them was lying. Anyhow, our server did compensate us by not charging us for our split meal (would have been $15) and gave us an extra dessert. So for that, and the stunning view, we give three stars.",

Finally made it up to the lounge area we were looking for and enjoyed 2 for 1 cocktails and half price appetizers. The service was ok, the food was good, the view is AMAZING. Plus you get to watch people jump of the side of the building so that's cool too.

At the end of our dinner the waiter stated that the manager would like to buy us two drinks! (the drinks are $17.00), we found out it was Marty, whom we asked to take our picture. Thank you Marty! You made our night extra special and he took the best picture of us! We also loved the observation deck, we were higher than the helicopters! We also visited the lounge 107, which we thought was a club, it was nice, but not a club as advertised. A great place to get a drink and admire the views though.",

We went here for mother's day and we enjoyed the staff and our present company more than the food.    We ordered a couple of steak dishes and some seafood. The Steak was tough and the seafood was overcooked. Desert was decent and better than the main courses we had.  I do hope that this changes. It's a shame that the view doesn't meet the standard that the rest of the strip emphasizes.   Should anyone go, go for drinks and the view. You will enjoy the hospitality that everyone that works there exudes. Just plan on going elsewhere to eat.",

It was truly an amazing experience, one we will always do when we visit Las Vegas!!! Be sure you make reservations! The food was superb we had the filet mignon and the twice baked potato and I had the mozzarella tomato watermelon salad which was delicious and for dessert we had the chocolate teardrop cake which was out of this world!!!

We made reservations online through Open Table and my husband called earlier the day of our reservation to request a table by the window. It is a good idea to call as we were told that we got the last open window view table.   Our waitress was very friendly and did not rush us at all when ordering. The food did come out fast, which is great, but take your time ordering if you plan to enjoy the sunset like we did.   I ordered the salmon and it was great, my husband ordered the shellfish meal and most of the meal was great but the scallops were a little chewy.  Overall I'd definitely suggest the restaurant if you are looking for a nice, classy meal with amazing views!",

Because it's located a bit off from the main part of the Strip, not many people seem to drive here for a meal, but this restaurant is well deserving of it's stellar reviews.   Highly recommend the 3 courses prix fixe menu for $45, available at lunch until around 3:30pm. The lobster bisque is tasty, as well as the soup of the day, which was a vegetable corn soup with fennel. For my entree of surf and turf, I chose the Canadian lobster for the seafood. I absolutely loved the succulent lobster. The steak was tender too. The dessert duo was not as impressive. I think you might be able to upgrade to a different dessert for a small upgrade fee.   Overall, it was a memorable lunch, and you get to go to the observation level both indoor and outdoor before or after your meal. So you save around $20 on the observation fee on the Tower. It was also enjoyable to watch people go on the adventurous rides they have. Highly recommended! We will be coming back for sure!",

To start off, we made a reservation a day before at 8pm and the lady insisted on arriving 30 minutes earlier. That was a great tip because we made it just in time for our reservation. Not to mention, our window seating request was satisfied with no complications. The elevator staff are very welcoming. Our server was from Mexico City; very pleasant to be able to speak in both languages and have some connection with him. The service we received from him was extremely friendly. He always made sure our drinks were never empty and always checked up on us in a timely manner.   The food was phenomenal. They start you off with different types of breads with a side of 3 different types of butters. The bread was warm and it was great having different butter options. I'm a big steak fan so I ordered the 9oz filet mignon medium-well along with a side of their mashed potatoes. My dad ordered the 22oz. Kansas City Bone-In Strip. My sister had the chef special, Organic Half Chicken. VERY juicy meat and cooked to its best.   The view is breath taking. A full 360 view of Las Vegas while enjoying your dinner. The rotation isn't as bad as I thought; I thought I would've been dizzy while eating. After dinner, you can always walk upstairs and experience the view behind a mini fence. Overall a great experience and I'm glad I chose this place for my Dad's birthday.",

The bungee jumpers from atop the building are a surprising and fun addition. The service was good. The food was mediocre and not worth the price. The dessert was the best part of the meal. Everyone should experience it once, if you go back for a second trip then you must really love the view. The restaurant moves so slowly that you will not get dizzy or sick. The top floor observation deck where the amusement rides are located is included for dining guests. Visit the top on your way out.",

    "text": "My first time here was with my bf 8 years ago, whom is now my fiance as he proposed to me on Top of the World after dinner!  We went here 8 years ago when we first went to Vegas together. We had dinner when the sun was about to set and it was so romantic. The upstairs of the restaurants spins at a 360 degree angle, but you could barely tell. So at night is the best view you can get, especially if you're by the window. You can see the whole strip. So pretty, especially with all of the lights   Our most recent trip was a couple years ago and I couldn't get over how great our meal was. He had scallops and I had steak and we shared the seafood tower as an appetizer. Everything was amazingly prepared.  The only thing I brought up was that the butter they provided was in the shape of the stratosphere and now they don't offer it like that??  It's also a pretty cool view to see people jumping off of the top of the stratosphere when they're bungee jumping while enjoying your dinner lol.  I'm sure we will be back here as it is a special place in our hearts since it was our first romantic dinner in Vegas and where we decided to spend forever together when he proposed. It's definitely a place for a romantic date night with your significant other and if you wanna impress them with that view!",

We came with family for a weekend lunch and I was pleased with the lunch and brunch selections. Also, the full menu was available all day!  Their bread basket was delicious and we loved the flavored butters, especially the herb one.   Short Rib Benedict ($28): Poached eggs, short rib, crab, hollandaise, potato cake, and seasonal vegetables. Everything about this benedict was amazing! The potato cakes were creamy and delicious, the short rib was insanely tender, great crab, tasty hollandaise with the right consistency, and the soft poached eggs were absolute perfection. The roasted vegetables were pretty great, too.  East Coast Lobster Tail BLT ($30): Lobster, applewood smoked bacon, yellow tomato, lemon aioli, avocado, and arugula on multigrain toast. An awesome sandwich with a generous serving of lobster tail. I loved the additional twist of yellow tomato and arugula, plus, avocado is great everywhere. The BLT was accompanied by a delicious simply-dressed salad and lattice potato chips.  Seafood Platter ($56): Prawns with Top of the World cocktail sauce, ahi poke cones, yellowtail crudo, lobster cocktail, and crab salad. This platter is insane and so awesome!! It is loaded with seafood goodies. As is no surprise, EVERYTHING was delicious. It doesn't matter what else you order, but you need this platter in your life.  Bananas Foster in a Florentine Box ($10): Artisanal vanilla ice cream, foster sauce with Myers' rum and fresh banana, served in a caramel almond box. Um, yes. I love Bananas Foster and this is a great version of it. The box makes it even better. The box is delicious.  Great food, great service, and amazing views of the whole valley (if you didn't already know, the restaurant rotates 360 degrees in 80 minutes). What else do you need?",

    "text": "I am kinda sad to give this place 3 stars, but I have to be honest with myself. The food was average, at best. Granted, I did not get steak and lobster (maybe that is where I went wrong), but I still had high expectations for my dish.   As many have said prior, it is a great experience. The view of Vegas, the night lights, and the sky jumpers is a delight. But, you may be better off just paying to either go the sky lounge/bar or the observation deck to get the views but save some money.   My cousin made reservations here for her birthday, and despite taking a look at the menu and seeing the prices, I was intrigued. I was for sure certain that for the prices I saw on the menu, the food was going to be great. But, somewhere, the food fell flat. For starters, I ordered the lobster bisque. My indifference of the soup was more a preference. It was a bit more tangy and tomato based than I prefer, but it was decent. For my entree, I ordered the salmon dish, which is one of my favorite dishes to eat when I am out. The salmon was served on top of a lobster rice. The lobster rice was very good! My cousin complained that she did not get any lobster in her rice, but I had several pieces in my dish. Honestly, the rice saved the salmon. At first bite, the salmon tasted good, but as I got closer to the center I realized it wasn't seasoned well and something was missing. I also prefer a little crisp on the surface of my salmon and this piece was very soft. Though I didn't hate my food, I was not excited about it either. And, though I started to regret getting another dish I was eyeing, I am slightly glad I chose the salmon because I don't exactly feel like I wasted money. Had I chosen a $70 dish, I may have been more disappointed.   The service overall was great. I appreciated the attentiveness of our server. There is also a photographer that comes around and takes your picture, of course there is fee, but it's typical for any major attraction. By the way, what do they do with those pictures that people do not buy? I always wondered that.   This is a nice place for a special night or celebration, but honestly, there are a ton of high-quality restaurants in Vegas that I think will be enjoyed much more. But, if you are solely concerned about the experience, go for it. But, please expect average/slightly above average food for well above average prices.",

    "text": "DISAPPOINTING!   There are 3 different components here: The view/experience The food The service.  Remember, you are paying for the view/experience. The food, alas, is not the draw. It's okay. It is not worth the price. When you're paying $100 or more for dinner it should be really good. It is not.  This is a once-a-year excursion for my friend and I, and we go for the sunset. That's the view/experience part. Always excellent.   Once we were seated, it took the waiter about 5 minutes to come to our table to greet us and hand us menus. He told us the night's specials which were numerous and varied. Too much to remember. Another 5 minutes passed when I caught his eye and pointed to the empty water glasses -- he came right over and filled them. A very nice man, but let me just say the service is leisurely. Of course, you are not in a rush since it makes one revolution every hour (it does not spin!) and you want to see it all. But still ...  The menu had changed since our last visit, so it took us a few minutes to decide. Our waiter told us the rack of lamb was only two small chops. Really? Not worth the price. Oh, did I mention then have a new chef. He's made changes. And not for the better.  So, after we had ordered, the assistant brought us the bread basket. It had been sitting in view for the entire time and usually in a restaurant they bring the bread so you have something to munch while perusing the menu. Anyway, it arrived with two dinner rolls right out of a package from the market, two pretzel bread somethings and the now obligatory parmesan seeded cracker bread. All cold. And a little teeny-tiny pat of butter.   I ordered the Caesar salad with anchovies. \"No anchovies,\" the waiter told us. That's disappointing! If I were at Denney's I would not expect anchovies, but this is a \"gourmet\" restaurant. No excuse. When the salad arrived, there was no ground pepper offered (there were little salt and pepper grinders on the table). I know it's an affectation when the waiter carries a two foot long pepper grinder, but that's part of the fun of going out somewhere swank, isn't it? So I ground my own pepper. First bite. What?? This isn't Caesar dressing. It looked like it, but it tasted more like oil and vinegar. When the waiter came by to see how everything was, I asked about the dressing. He assured me it was a real Caesar dressing with anchovy paste, etc. I KNOW what a Caesar dressing should taste like. For years it was my specialty when we entertained. I made it from scratch. This was not it. He offered to remove it and take it off the bill. I said, \"yes, please do that.\" Again, disappointing.  Both of us had steak and I have to say my grass fed ribeye was tender and delicious. No quarrel there. EXCEPT. It was simply a hunk of meat plunked in the middle of a large white plate. On a presentation scale of 1-10, I give it a Zero. I mean, how much time and money would it take to pipe a bit of mashed potatoes around the meat, or put a pretty little garnish at one edge? Nope. Nothing. This chef is out to save money any way he can. But you're there for the experience, right?  My friend had the filet mignon and enjoyed it. We shared the asparagus and green beans, which were very well prepared. We also shared the 21 layer chocolate cake which was very good and way too much for two people, but of course we brought it home. The coffee, when it came, was warm, not hot, but refills were generously offered and we were invited to linger and enjoy the evening.   In summary, I am very disappointed in this new \"chef.\" I hope the Strat finds someone with a little more savvy who can actually put out a meal worthy of a gourmet restaurant with attention to detail.   So, go for the view and the experience, be prepared to shell out the big bucks and don't sweat the small stuff.",

    "text": "My husband and I went for our 10th anniversary I made reservations in early October and I was told that I had to prepay $126.52 per person prior to getting there and to keep the reservation.  Once we were seated we asked the server, Joel to verify that we were getting a prepaid menu and let him know that we had paid already.  He explained that anything over and above what we had paid we would need to pay for we understood we ordered two glasses of Pinot Noir and when we received our bill it was $70!!!! Our waiter Joel explain to us that the price had gone up since we had prepaid for our meal and therefore that is the reason why it was $119 per person plus tax and gratuity and not $126 per person plus tax tip and gratuity. If we did not say anything we would have been charged the extra $40 per person and would have paid $70 more over and above what we had expected to pay. I'm not sure what most people call this but this is purely an ethical to have someone prepay for a meal and then the meal go up and then not let them know ahead of time that the meal price has changed and that they would pay a different price ahead of time. However they tried to get away with it and it wasn't until I had become almost belligerent that they changed the price to what I agreed to pay for two and months ago. If you're reading this please do not make reservations with Stratosphere, they are predators and you should not patronize them.",

The lights from the whole valley with a vibe hats both electric yet calming, making it ideal for romantic engagements or business dinners. The staff is both knowledgeable of the menu as well as food and beverage trends and hospitality. However, the food here is UNBELIEVABLE. Truly an experience that is so mouth watering it makes the view and the staff together just worthy enough to prepare and serve. I have enjoyed a large portion of the menu and I must say the menu is evocative of exotic flavors without taking away from the quality and natural flavors of menu item in question. Bravo. I will be back again and again. Chef Johnny Church is the real deal and his latest menu is just another example of his genius. It was truly an unforgettable experience and birthday.",

Boyfriend and I started with a wedge salad and lobster bisque and something about both of them was... Off. The wedge salad dressing wasn't bleu cheese so it just wasn't what we are used to. It wasn't terrible. Neither was the lobster bisque. I wish there were actually some meat in it! It was extremely rich and tasted more like cream than anything. I had the New York strip steak cooked medium and Scott had the lobster Thermidor. Both pretty good but just not THAT impressive. However the side of potato puree with Gruyere was sinfully delicious, along with the bread basket and different butters at the beginning. Those were almost worth the whole thing! The wine list was impressive.   The service was amazing! Fast, personable, and professional. I enjoyed overall but would not return. Take a trip to the observation deck after dinner for an awesome view and rides.",

Service is well done and unobtrusive.  When we were there we enjoyed the Prix Fixe meal for $150/2 ppl which included appetizer, salad/soup, entree, and a kitchy chocolate dessert that modeled the tower itself.  We also shared a half bottle of wine so the bill came to slightly over $220.  Food is secondary to the rest of the experience, but it was pretty well done and sufficient for me not to complain.  We had a kobe beef and lentil leek appetizer, lobster bisque or the house salad, sole burre blanc with haricot verts, and the chocolate dessert mentioned above.  All of it was tasty, but a little heavy (in terms of portions and butter) and didn't suit me well for the prolonged evening after.    Two thumbs up, overall.",

    "text": "The food is here is good but not excellent but still worth the price, assuming you remember that you're in Vegas and that everything is at least somewhat overpriced.  The view is amazing of course and it just makes for a real fun experience.  For starters we sampled the cheese / fruit plate and I had a shrimp cocktail.  Both were pretty good.  For entrees, my date had the lobster ravioli and I had the surf and turf, a 10z fillet with a 8oz lobster tail.  Everything was delicious and we were both very satisfied.  The service was good and attentive.  The only real detractor in the evening was a manifestation of the \"compelled photography\" experience that is becoming increasingly prevalent in Vegas.  Any time you do something even remotely touristy in Vegas, they want to force you to stand or sit somewhere and get your picture taken, so that later on someone in your group will see the picture up on a screen, have a very emotional reaction to it and insist that you buy it, usually for no less than 15 dollars.  Well, this has found its way unfortunately even into this restaurant.  The photographer was an older lady who bordered on being crass.  We agreed to let her take the photographs and she does shots of each of us individually - including some very contrived poses - and then a couple of shots together.  Then she comes back a while later and gives you the sales pitch, like trying to convince you to pick five (!!!) different photos and get them all in some fancy book.  Lady, this isn't my high school or college graduation and it's not my wedding.  I'm not going to pass this down as a fairly heirloom, so relax.  One of the photos did come out VERY nice and so I bought it, but the whole experience took way too long, felt too forced and in general broke up the last part of the meal too much.  They need someone who can get in there, take just a couple of photos nice and fast and be charming enough to not make it feel like an ordeal.  And maybe do the sales pitch after I've left the dinner table.  The idea isn't terrible, it just needs better execution.  It didn't even really detract from the evening that much, you just kind of get out of it and go, \"Wow, really?\"  This place was an enjoyable experience but to be honest, once is enough.  There are enough other places on The Strip with great food that I won't be compelled to return here.  But if you've never done it before, it's fun and worth checking out.",

It's worth coming here for the view alone - seeing the Strip at night from such a height is a breathtaking experience.  The base of the restaurant gently rotates so your view is constantly changing.  It's not noticeable and is a really nice touch to get a view of the entire valley.    The food is very good as well, and the service was attentive and courteous.  It's quite an expensive meal, especially at dinner, but you're paying for the overall experience.

BUT...if you're only gonna be in vegas for a few days, eating here can be a very time consuming experience, considering that it takes a while to get there if you're staying on the strip and you then have to get to the top of the stratosphere. the day we went, the elevator either wasn't working or was just being hella slow, bc there was def. about 40 mins between arriving at the stratosphere and finally being seated!   We had a 1:30 reservation, and were suprised at how few people there were eating there. It's a huge dining room, but I would say there were only about 30 others. Considering that, our service should have been awesome, right? Well, actually, it SUCKED. big time. Our server was a complete snobby beezatch, after we placed our order and had been awkwardly awaiting our food for about 45 mins she came by and casually noted that \"your dishes will be out soon.\" Maybe they ran out of ingredients and had to leave the Stratosphere, go to the grocery store, then come back and fix our meal? That's really the only reason it should have taken that long to get our food, esp. considering it wasn't even crowded!  That being said, our food was actually delicious and well worth the price. I had some sort of veal medallions with a big hunk of mozzarella stuffed w/ greens on top; BF had the perfectly velvety lobster bisque and a humongous ribeye, absolutely divine, but the accompanying potatoes sucked. Also, the menu was a lot smaller than I expected, and there seemed to be things on the website that weren't even on the lunch menu when we got there. Overall, I might go back if I had nothing else to do and was w/ somebody who'd never been that before, but other than that, it's just not worth the trouble.",

The staff was friendly, our waiter was super kind, and my New York Strip steak was grilled to perfection and my mashed potatoes were quite delectable.  This place is top notch and for a high end restaurant the prices are very competitive, especially for Las Vegas.  I'd recommend this place to anyone and can't wait to eat there again myself!

Let me give you a hint as a local... if you want to see the view without the pricey elevator ride and long wait, book a reservation here, take the private elevator up for free, and just don't go to the restaurant.  Take the stairs up top or another elevator up one floor and VOILA free view at the top of the stratosphere!",

    "text": "What a painful experience.  Someone else chose the restaurant.  I knew it was going to be a bad idea with the $$$$ prices, gimmicky location of the restaurant.  Place sets itself up to be all snazzy.  Fancy view, dimmed lights, elegance and all that jazz.  Prices seem to match.  Short version of the review:  Save your money, find a restaurant for a few notches down you won't notice the difference.  If you don't mind the costs, try a Buffet on the trip, it'll cost you less, give you more variety and the quality will be on par or perhaps better.  So please be aware, I'm more harsh in this review, because if I'm gonna pay more, I'm going to expect everything to be proportional to the prices.  Food:  It wasn't bad.  But nothing special.  Got a Mediterranean seabass filet.  Tasted fine.  Not great, just fine.  I'd happily pay 10 for it.  Grudgingly 15 for it.  Unfortunately it cost me 44.  Found a bone in my first bite.   Flavor was fine, but nothing amazing.  Serving size was good.  Unless you get the 88 dollar 4 course meal, you have to order everything a la carte.  10 dollar sides.  Seeing as my group was made up of 3 chinese people, we opted out of trying their 10 dollar Baby Bok Choy or the Shitake and white mushroom with garlic sides (same price).  Tried the cream spinach and potatoes gratin.  They weren't bad, but we didn't bother finishing either side.  Someone else got the first, and the last person got the Pork tenderloin (wrapped in bacon).  Not bad.  My friend liked his fish more, pork was a bit dry for him.  I liked the heartiness, hit the spot better than the fish.  Food:  3/5 (Taste 4/5)  (Price 2/5)  The experience:  This one is hard... people at the front desk seemed nice enough.  The waitress that help refill our drinks and clean up was very friendly.  Unfortunately the waiter left a bad taste in my mouth.  He seemed like he was having a bad day.  Not sure if it was because of our party --- seems we weren't high class enough for his fancy restaurant with a 50 dollar minimum per person.  Didn't know upstanding high end restaurants had to twist people's arms to buy their food.  He began by recommending the 4 course menu, because it was a better deal -- everything else was a la carte aka overpriced and not worth it.  Unfortunately we weren't too keen on spending 88 dollars per person.  So we opted to have one person try it and share some of the extra, since 4 courses was quite a bit of food and gave a good general glimpse of the restaurant's food.  Of course when we went to order, the waiter decided to tell us now that the 4 course menu is only recommended when everyone orders 4 courses.  Because I guess my frugal group's decision to not pay 15 dollars for soup/appetizers, would mean that as I receive my first 2 courses they would have to sit by and watch me eat because the chef would not be happy serving their food till I was on my main course as well.  He seems pretty bothered by this as he was explaining it to me.  I assume he was hoping we'd spend more, cause his tip on the minimum 50 dollars per person, was not worth his time to talk to us.  So on that new information I changed my order, got the fish and 2 sides for my party.  As I ordered the side of spinach, pointing to it on the menu, a very strange dialogue came up.  He started explaining to me that the spinach that came with my fish was not the creamed spinach but just some sauteed spinach.  He was obviously annoyed that I could not process the complexity of his simple a la carte menu.  I didn't even know that the fish came with anything else.  I assumed a la carte meant... by itself... without anything else.  Guess I was wrong, maybe i shouldn't have ordered the extra spinach.  But since I wanted to make sure i hit that 50 dollar minimum, and had wanted to try it.  I kindly pointed to the bottom of the menu again... under the part that read SIDES.  Next to the nice $10 price.  And repeated that I wanted a side of creamed spinach and the potato gratin to share with my party.  I guess that annoyed me more than i remember it being, bad taste in my mouth.  On a side note, my waiter reminded me of Hugo Weaving  (Agent Smith from Matrix or Elrond from LOTR).  He had that frown down cold!  Yeah, service: 3.5/5  Nothing was especially great, in general it'd be a 4.  That waiter dropped it to a 3.5  I'd drop it more cause of him, but he may have been a random lemon.  The view?  Eh.  The only reason you'd come to the restaurant is if you stay at Strat.  If you stay at strat, you get free tickets to the observation deck.  You get a better view there.  Food: 3/5 Service 3.5/5 Price: Not worth it. View: Nothing you can't find elsewhere in vegas.  Sorry this was long.  Just know what you're getting into.",

Good thing our reservations were for dinner time, because the city isn't much of a sight to see without all the neon lights of the night.  The view is spectacular.  And the floor revolves.  You don't feel it, but if you look closely enough, you can see it.  Nothing like the \"mood\" lighting and the white tablecloth on the table.  It was well-worth it.    They have a number next to each item on the menu.  Common sense would say that it is the price.  Everything is a la carte.  The food is cuisine-like.  Don't expect to get full...unless you're prepared to pay.  But for my honey and I, it really was so well-worth it.    I would definately come back here for special occassions and with my other half, but not too often.  This place is so special and visually-stunning, that I'd hate to keep coming back only to evetually feel just like any mediocre place.  But to Top of the World Restaurant....I definately give my hats off to you.",

Met a friend in Las Vegas and we had lunch here.   What was funny was that when walking in my friend asked \"Are you supposed to be wearing a jacket to go in here\"?   Answer to that is \"Oh course not, this is Las Vegas\".  I think we were wearing shorts and T-Shirts.    The food wasn't anything outstanding to justify the price.  They say (a commercial says) \"What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas.\"   What happened here is my $50 for a lunch for two stayed in Vegas.    The view is great, you can see all of Las Vegas and a lotta lotta desert and mountains off in the distance.   And I am not surprised that some people get dizzy even as slow as the restaurant rotates.   We didn't get dizzy but it was nice to get back to the ground, even $50 lighter.  If anything, eating here made me totally miss what was one of my favorite restaurants ever, Windows on the World that was at the top of the World Trade Center.  Now that was a nice one and totally worth the price.",

    "text": "I have been coming to this restaurant for over 6 years every time I come to Vegas which is quite often and the food USED TO BE amazing but not anymore. After they changed the chef about a year and a half ago the quality of food and presentation has been going down the drain. This last visit has done it for me and I wish I took pictures of the dishes because the words just won't describe it. We started with the lobster bisque which was too brown and had caramelized sugar taste to it. It used to be by far my favorite soup but this time I could not finish it because of the strange tart aftertaste after each spoon...it tasted overcooked and too sweet. I had the scallops and shrimp and my husband had the lamb chops. The scallops came with the couscous that had raisins in it giving it a sweet taste and the scallops came grilled or fried with butter sauce and oversalted. The scallops and couscous did not go together well at all and the way it was presented was underwhelming as well. The scallops were laid out around the what seemed to have been just a pile of couscous. I did not finish it either ..weird combination of sweet raisins in the couscous and salty buttery shrimp did nothing for me. I would expect this in the restaurant by the road at a $15 dollar price not $44 in a supposedly world class restaurant. My husband's lamb chops came with the same couscous and a pile of green beans (and I mean a pile) ...the presentation was non-existent. He ordered them medium rare and they came out dry, with too much paprika and too much salt, usually the signs of disguising the low quality meat.   We have paid over $150 for what we felt was worth $50 tops. The service was good no complaints there but whole experience ruined by mediocre food.  We will not be going back for the food. The view  is amazing but save your money on the food and go have an amazing dinner at Paris - Eiffel Tower   or La Cirque at Bellagio both have amazing views and amazing food and service.",

    "text": "If you are looking to make memories with a special person in your life while in Vegas, go here.   Going here with my boyfriend for our anniversary, not only was it romantic, but one of the best experiences we have had at a restaurant ever - and when everything, from the ambiance, to the food,  to the service, rings wonderful - then you are guaranteed a beautiful, euphoric feeling inside. It ended up being one of our most favorite memories on any trip thus far.  We came by around 4:30 to catch the sunset, so we could get the best of both views - very good idea, if you are going for dinner. The manager greeted us and came by several times throughout our dinner, and our waitress was a complete darling. She was very helpful since I am vegetarian and she is vegan, so we clicked quickly.    Despite the menu having only one vegetarian entree, it was great to just see a nice plate of veggies when all the other well-to-do places try to do pasta/gnochhi as vegetarian fare. I also got the market greens salad which was so delicious. My boyfriend had the tomato/mushroom/buffalo mozzarella dish which he loved to death, along with his pork dish that had some buttery yams on it. We got a side of potatoes au gratin but I do not recommend this because the side vegetables are at least $10 and the portion is *small*.  For dessert, we did the trio. I actually think this is my only slight regret because for 8 dollars, you get very tiny desserts. It's nice if you want a light touch at the end, but for two people I don't think the portions were enough - especially for someone like me who loves dessert above all other courses! However, what we did get was very delicious. It was fun to dip the cheesecake lollipop into the different toppings, and I adored the banana bread pudding!  During the meal, a woman comes around and takes several  souvenir pictures. We had two taken together, and then of just us, separately. These pictures were stunning, with the strip in the background/distance,  and despite being overpriced, my boyfriend and I got a few. Two big pictures came in a nice album which on front says \"Top of the World\" with a Stratosphere, and you can also get tiny wallet-sized versions which are slightly cheaper.   We ate leisurely and enjoyed ourselves, and finally left, happy and full. You are able to go up to the observation deck or the lounge afterwards to extend your time, which we did.   What really solidified TOTW as a wonderful place for us was that after hitting ground again, I had suddenly remembered a <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FRestaurant.com&s=0aab4cbd731f3d3b0d1453050d3abc56a8c80bd214e25469c7555b750dca8a51\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Restaurant.com</a> giftcard for $25 that we had meant to use, but forgot! My boyfriend called and explained this to the manager, who invited us to come right back up so he could apply the discount. As soon as we were back up there, he immediately helped us, completely friendly and understanding. I cannot tell you how happy this made us, and just made our experience that much better.  It's the best to find a place that makes you feel good, that gives you happiness and good service, and all of that can be found here. Do yourself a favor and splurge - that money would've just found itself in a slot machine anyhow, right?   It was really worth it, to sit up in the sky, high above such a beautiful, usually busy city, and see it from a calm perspective. After coming back down from this heavenly view, I definitely felt different, more relaxed, now full of great memories.",

    "text": "Last Spring, The Lover and I decided to head to Las Vegas in hopes to win millions and retire early. Well, that didn't happen. BUT we did try Top of the World since we were staying at the Stratosphere.   Five Stars - The ambiance, view, and the food we had was excellent. Service was phenomenal. Just what we've expected and we were really glad it measured to our expectations and more.  Location - Staying at The Stratosphere, the restaurant is located above us - exactly 844 feet in the air. And also, according to the review preceding ours, she mentioned that \"ghetto-fab, and it is not located in the best part of Vegas.\" News alert: the whole Vegas strip IS ghetto-fab. Did you happen to look around? I mean, unless you're staying at the Bellagio's Presidential Suite... And, if you do not find the Mexican card clickers on the MAIN strip \"ghetto-fab\" then I really do not understand your definition of \"ghetto-fab.\" Moving on...   First Impressions - Business casual dress code is always a plus. There is velvet rope and a podium at the bottom of the Stratosphere, where a formally dressed staff member checks reservations, and directs diners into the foyer.  Toward the left, the staff guides the uninitiated to the elevator that delivers them to the upper eschelon that is Top of the World.  A helpful elevator operator warmly greets diners, and tosses out Stratosphere facts, such as that the elevator is traveling at a crisp 20 miles per hour.  In less than 30 seconds and more than 105 floors. You can definitely hear and feel your ears popping. I think the elevator added excitement and mystery to what lied ahead. Definitely well-received.  Food - For starters, we had the Ahi Tuna Tataki and Asian Salad, which was Ahi tuna, seared rare, Wasabi vinaigrette and potato gaufrette drizzled with soy reduction. This was altogether enjoyed by The Lover and I with a basket of warm artisan bread and butter that's exceptionally good. And to cleanse our palettes, I decided to go with a glass of their Pascual Toso Malbec and The Lover had Stella Artois.   Entrees: I put their Turf and Quack with Duo of Sauces to the test. The dish consisted of a Petit filet, seared duck foie gras and Muscovy duck breast, red wine mushroom and brandy peppercorn sauces, and yam puree. The filet melted in your mouth like butter with an explosion of flavors accompanying it at every bite. The foie gras tasted fresh and was cooked to perfection. Each ingredient in that dish complemented each other. On the other hand, The Lover went with the 10oz. USDA Choice Filet with red wine mushroom sauce, served with roasted portobello mushroom. I could tell that the dish was to die for because he did not speak to me until after everything on his plate was finished. It looked great. It smelled fabulous. Chef Giffen did well.  Dessert: The Lover never had creme brulee before this experience, so it was a must. We ordered an assortment of decadent desserts, such as Cheesecake Lollipops served with cookies & cream with vanilla sauce and crushed Oreo, Pistachio Creme Brulee, and the Mini Raspberry Mousse Cup, a handmade chocolate cup filled with raspberry mousse. The Lover doesn't have much of a sweet tooth but he devoured everything along with me. I felt that it was a dessert heaven success.   Final Verdict - The view alone is a must-see; revolving at 360 degrees every 80 minutes, a perfect dinner getaway while you're in Vegas. The food, along with the service, is on-point. Worth every penny.",

    "text": "The food is very good and the view is spectacular.  The \"hospitality\" is grossly lacking and because of this I cannot recommend this restaurant.  When you pay a certain amount for a meal (there is a \"$50/person minimum, $15 split plate charge\" for example) you should be able to expect a certain level of service.  Not so for \"Top of the World\" - I was very disappointed.  People were ridiculously rude at the security checkpoint, as if we were burdening them for being there (seriously?!  This guy's ONE job is to lead people through a metal detector and show them the elevator.  It's hardly taxing, dude.  Get another job if you don't like this one.)  Our waiter was outrageously rude about the <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> gift certificate we had.  We sat down and he was fine.  We tell him about the GC and his demeanor changed (to attitude and rudeness) IMMEDIATELY.  No joke.  He actually didn't even want to let us use it because we didn't have it printed out, even though the website specifically stated we didn't need a printout, just the code (we even showed him a screenshot of this exact wording on the site, since we were concerned about not having a printout either, but wanted to take the site's word).  He made a loud scene and called his manager over while telling us \"he's not going to accept it\" either - unbelievable!  The manager graciously just took the code down and said it was fine, slipped away, and then unfortunately left us again with our charming server.  I got the feeling he was used to dealing with our guy's \"personality\".  After this debacle, the meal went on.  But instead of splurging as we had intended though (this was supposed to be a nice family dinner with my husband, mom, and brother), we basically stuck to the order minimum, since we really did not feel like patronizing this place.  No overpriced champagne for us!    As I said, the view is gorgeous, and the food was good.  All tall rotating restaurants are overpriced for the food and drink, but you're paying for that view, of course.  If we hadn't had such atrocious \"service\" I'd maybe recommend this place (as long as you remember what kind of restaurant it is and how that affects the prices); but the Stratosphere is getting run down (walking through the casino and shopping area was pretty deserted and almost creepy feeling), and the whole experience being as it was, I'll have to say you can spend your money at many, many other fine establishments and have a MUCH nicer experience while in Vegas.",

Every other time I have gone to an upscale restaurant, the chef has always been able to accommodate my dietary needs, but TOTW failed miserably in this area. I was given a plate of under-cooked lukewarm to cool veggies for my vegetarian gluten free meal, and left still hungry after a $50 (total bill $100 + tip) meal. All in all.. I am sure this is a fine place to eat if you don't have dietary restrictions, but avoid it if you do.",

When our waitress arrived she was very cold and rehearsed. She did not even try to talk to us.  This might not sound unusual but we saw her with a few other tables and she was chatty.  She took our drink order and said she would be back. Someone else brought our drinks. We waited and waited and finally she came back. She took our order and left right away. About 45 minutes went by and she never checked on us. Finally our food came.  For the price we expected a little more. Expect to spend $50+ per person just for your main meal.  Appetizers, desert and drinks expect to spend $200 plus for 2 people. Don't get me wrong the food is great and the view is spectacular but the service is why they are only getting 3 1/2 stars.",

I had the rack of lamb, which was tender, juicy, and filling.    we sat near the window, which provided great views of LV, rotating a full circle every 60 minutes.  the move is very subtle, so shouldn't cause any dizziness.  the price includes access to the top floors (which usually is $18/person).  you can bungee jump, ride rides, and the balcony has fantastic views.    The only problem was the prices were on the high side, upwards of 50-60/dish.  They certainly factor in the $18 fee to the top into your meal.    overall, great experience, and one definitely must try it once, especially for a special occasion.",

I went with my wife for a late lunch and we were both delighted.  Having said this, as many others have stated, the food is over-priced and unremarkable. I ordered a medium steak and got it almost well-done, whilst my wife got the vegan plate, which was $40 for a big plate of mostly steamed veggies and quinoa. House wines are also sub-par; you'll get the equivalent of a 10-dollar wine.  I never thought I'd say this, but I highly recommend this restaurant in spite of the food!",

Bill comes and we throw 3 credit cards in - fortunately one for us looked at the bill - the service charge was about 50% of the food and drink total!!!  He asked for the manager, who looked puzzled and said it was a mistake and they would re-run the ticket and I think he comped our deserts.  This cannot be an accident - its a computer!!

Beautiful atmosphere, wonderful meal and great service.  We all had the 4 course tasting menu, which for $90, and all things considering, I thought was a very nice price.  Especially since the third course, the filet, I would guess at 10 to 12 oz.  A far larger portion than I have seen on any tasting menu.  While the food was not spectacular, it was certainly very good, and we all enjoyed.  The wine pairing for $30 was fabulous, and for me perhaps the best part of the meal.  It would have been a bargain for even more.  I also highly recommend the bananas foster in a a almond brittlle bowl.  The service was excellent, but not rushed at all.  Servers were always in the area, but we had a rather slow pace to meal, to enjoy the view.  We were there 2+ hours, and since the restaurant slowly rotates, we enjoyed 2 complete rotations, and spectacular views.  The atmosphere is quiet on the inside, and the views cannot be beat.  I would recommend this experience to anyone.",

My salad was overpowered with blue cheese and the \"bacon\" seemed to be pieces of fat thrown into my salad.   If the review was for the food only, it would be 1 star.  I'm giving the extra 2 stars for the friendliness of our server and for the amazing view.

It was very succulent. We were thinking each thinking about getting our own but decided to share, which I'm very glad we did. The portion was very generous and the perfect precursor to our meal  3) Rack of Lamb. Oh, my, goodness. This was incredible. I ordered it medium and it literally melted in my mouth. It came with a side of chutney which was the perfect accompaniment. I was full half way but couldn't help but eat the whole plate. That is NOT the kind of meal you waste.   4) Bone-in rib-eye.

    "text": "The views alone are 5 star. I had to take 2 stars away for the service. With the prices they have, service should be a lot better than it was. We had a group of 7, so the gratuity was added, and I feel like our waiter knew his tip was guaranteed and didn't give us great service. Everything started great, some of our group were late, so we were able to wait in the lounge. I think that has the best view. We ordered some beers at $8 each. Once all of party arrived we were seated immediately by the window. Service was ok, we were getting settled in and checking out the view, so it took us a minute to decide what we wanted. Originally I planned on seafood Alfredo but chose the chefs tasting menu at $98. Course 1 was lobster bisque, I didn't like it. I ended up fishing all the lobster out and didn't finish my soup. Course 2 was the pork belly, so good and crispy in a delicious sauce. Hubby got scallop and it was also yummy. Upgraded the main entree to lobster tail for $10, and glad I did, well worth it! I ordered my filet mignon well done, instead of medium well. My fault, it was not good. My husband loved his and said it melted in his mouth. We upgraded the dessert for $5 to whatever we wanted. I ordered creme brulee and it was food. I should've ordered tiramisu. But I was stuffed already anyway. Our waiter kept avoiding us, and it took 20 mins to get our dessert order and 30 minutes to get our check. We were there for over 2 hours! And most of it was waiting! I did enjoy the company and the views. The food and service should be a lot better for the price though. I would still recommend, but not highly.",

The whole place rotates, so you get fantastic views of the whole city.  The food was fairly expensive, between $35 & $50 a plate.  For four of us, including drinks, it was about $250 with tip.  The food was not spectacular, but it was good, you're paying more for the view.  If you're looking for the view, without the high cost to eat, I suggest the twice baked potato.  It was $12, but it was huge, tasty and filling.  The bread they brought was very good as well.",

Cocktails mixed perfectly.   View....stunning.   Then why only 4 stars?   Price.   I get it.   You pay for the view and executive chef but a dinner for two was over 250 without wine though we did each have a cocktail and we had dessert.   With tip I spent 300 bucks and sorry Top of the World.   You were great but that is too much.   Significantly too much.   For 225 with a tip it is a slam dunk 5 star experience.   For 250 it is getting testy but I still likely would have given 5 stars and grumbled about it.   But 300.   You're nuts.   Would love to eat there again one day but not likely at that price.",

The waiter was a nice guy, which was one of the few positives. When my boyfriend for his Surf & Turf Gnocchi, he realizes there was no lobster in it. John (the waiter) was very apologetic, and had the waiter make another plate. Again, you're paying for the view and not much else. If you want great meat, go to Fogo De Chao, at least the sides are included.  If you want the view, go to the lounge that's above the Top of the World, and save some money.  We were disappointed, to say the least.",

Bread was fresh and warm with a selection of butters.   The orange butter stood out on top!!!WOW!!!    We both ordered Wedge salads, which I believe had some of the best bacon on it that I have ever eaten,  huge portion which could be a meal in itself.   I ordered a 9oz Filet Mignon, rare, and they substituted seared scallops for me instead of lobster or shrimp.  The scallops were on the tasting menu and sounded really good!  Mine came out perfect!!   5 Stars plus!!!!!   The fillet was perfect,  I could cut it with my fork and the scallops melted in my mouth!!   My partner in crime ordered Tagliatelle Primavera, the plate came out and it looked like it could feed a village of 50 people!!  The pasta was cooked perfectly,  the vegetables were on point, outstanding dish!!   I think I might order it next time I'm there and see if they could put the seared scallops on top!!  We finished up with a shared dessert called Chocolate Lovers Dream,  which has a moist chocolate cake, Grand Marnier and chocolate mouse wrapped in a dark chocolate teardrop shell!!!    Amazing!!   When in Vegas,  go to this restraurant!!!!!",

    "text": "I had been here 10+ years ago and I couldn't stop raving about this place. This was a must do meal for my new wife. (We got married in the Chapel in the Clouds at the hotel).  Anyways, we made a reservation and requested a window seat. They had no problems accommodating us.  When seated, our waiter was pretty slow getting our drink order. He served the wine my wife ordered right away. My non-alcoholic, non $13 glass of wine took another 8 minutes.  Food came out pretty quick. The lobster bisque was very good but also extremely rich. The waiter, when serving it (they pour the soup over a small mound of lobster meat right at the table) splattered a few droplets on my wife's blouse. We didn't notice (because the restaurant is very dark) until right after the waiter left. We asked for some club soda to clean the droplets off which the manager brought but there was no apology whatsoever. They acted as if she spilled it on herself.  The crab cake I ordered was pretty good but not even remotely close to the best I've ever had. $18 for a single crab cake seemed more than just regular steep. It was exceptionally steep.  Our entrees were very good. She had the surf and turf gnocchi and I had the duo of lobster tails. Like everything in a revolving restaurant, they were overpriced.  During the meal, I asked the waiter for a refill on my Coke. He forgot about it and only remembered it 5 minutes later when I was about to point it out again. He gave some bs excuse that a few years ago, he only had to wait 4 tables at a time, instead of the 9 he does now. ARE YOU KIDDING ME? 9 tables is nothing. If you hustle and do your damn job, you can do twice that number and still provide exceptional service.  The bill took forever to come and they refused to give the 10% discount as an Ace Play Club member. It explicitly states, in the Guest Services Directory, that you get a 10% discount. I complained at the front desk and they adjusted our bill to compensate.  I love how, with the bill, there's a little insert that explains how to tip. \"Exceptional service gets 15-20%\". If the service was exceptional, he would have gotten 25-30%, but it was garbage. I felt like I was cheating myself by even giving him 8%. The last time I was here 10 years ago, I gave a $100 tip on a $400 bill.  The views are fantastic, the food was good (although not worth the prices). Waiters are hit and miss. With a different waiter, I might have given this place 4 or 5 stars.  Since waiters are random, I cannot recommend this place as it's a pretty expensive dice roll.",

She loves beautiful views and the the restaurant revolves, giving everyone a different awe  -inspiring view during their time there.  The whole experience was amazing.  From being greeted with \"Happy Anniversary\" at the hostess stand to  having a great server like Christian. These things made our experience special.  My wife has a very restrictive diet (no gluten, no nightshades, no eggs, pescatarian) and she was able to order normally from the menu. The carpaccio was delicious. So tender with lobster in the middle. She had the shrimp cocktail. The shrimp were huge and tender. The Waygu skirt steak was amazing. I opted for no sauce because it is that good. The Ora King salmon was perfectly cooked and soubise was so flavorful.   For dessert, I had the baked Alaska. It was so amazing, I ate the whole thing. All of the layers of deliciousness were too irresistible.  She had a drink called the spark plug which was a delicious coffee based martini for dessert. Giving you the option of a dessert cocktail was a nice touch too.   Hats off to Executive Chef Pawan Pinisetti and his staff for his spectacular menu and quality of preparation.  It was honestly the best dining experience I've ever had out here.",

He made the night extra special with his sense of humor and ya know I love a great waiter/waitress. We chose the pre selected menu lobster bisque md crab cake filet mignon and shrimp and creme broulee. This food was soooooo good and filling by the time dinner was over we had the itis.   I really can't say enough about this view it was too beautiful. Now I had a couple moon and stars drink which was very different but tasty, but drinking and going to the restroom doesn't always go hand in hand. The restaraunt rotates so you gotta remember which way you came in meaning head back to your table and not the lobby like a couple of us did playing follow the leader  but before we sat down the beautiful hostess explained to us why she told us our number section Thank you to her . Overall I had a blast and I will be back thank you to our waiter for making the night awesome!!!",

    "text": "Top of the World restaurant is located on the 106th floor of the Statosphere Hotel. Reservations are recommended as the food and view from the rotating restaurant are the attractions. Plan to spend a minimum of 80 minutes to enjoy a full rotation. Booths and tables are the choices. I recommend a booth because both people sit side by side and look directly out the window. Tables are closer to the window but you must turn your head  to look out the window. Service is slowly paced. Plenty of time to enjoy the view. Our server Jeanne was friendly and pointed our various places around the valley. She also provided an in depth explanation of the menu with a la carte and chef tasting selections. Our choices were a la carte. Summer &  Butternut Squash Soup Filet Mignon 9 oz portion Twice Baked Potato Seafood Alfredo  Lobster Bisque soup was on the menu but the special of the day was the Squash soup. The Squash soup was creamy with a hint of cinnamon and onion. An excellent choice, simply delicious. The Filet Mignon was cooked perfectly as requested and served with a brown gravy on the side. The twice baked potato was large, enough for two. The outside had a nice crisp texture and the inside soft and creamy. The potato was topped with bacon and onion.  Seafood Alfredo was offered with 3 choices of sauces. I chose the marinara. A large portion of tagtiatelle pasta was surrounded by jumbo shrimp, large chunks of lobster and crap meat. The bowl was covered with the marinara sauce. The entree was perfectly cooked. As with most pasta entrees, it was more then could be consumed. The dessert menu had several interesting choices but we passed. There's always next time.  Reservations at the restaurant includes complementary admission to the indoor and outdoor observation decks on the 107th and 108th floors. The indoor space is nothing special but the outdoor deck is more interesting, a wind in your face experience. Save the visit until after dinner when the strip is all lit up. Top of the World is a great choice for a special occasion or introducing visitors to Las Vegas.",

It almost doesn't matter where you sit except that you don't want to end up in the in between seatings...those are kinda awkward seatings. There's the row of booths that are intimate and give you a good view above the head of the diners that are dining a row below you, then there's the row of seats that are directly in front of the windows and those are amazing as well...and then there's the awkward in between seatings. Yes, I was unfortunate to be stuck in between. You wanna look out at the view...but instead your view is obstructed by the other wonderful couple that are awkwardly having an awesome time not talking to each other and are directly in front of the gorgeous view and they know my husband and I are both staring past them to the view...also staring at the man's failed attempts to make his lady smile (but that's none of my business). I didn't like that I had to tell the lady that I wasn't staring at her husband ...just the view.  On an amazing note...the steak i ordered medium rare was medium rare and ah-maze-ing!!! It melts in your mouth not your hands. My husband and I got the four course meal. I took a shitty pic of the lobster bisque because I already started eating it like a thirsty dog on a hot day. We ordered lobster bisque, crab cakes, filet mignon &shrimp and creme brulee.   The service was to be expected. Waitress was nice enough and she told us the groupon voucher we had was only valid on the weekdays not the weekend (my bad) but I knew it'd be expensive so I planned for it. Lol.   We had a great time. Would go there again.",

During the day, it's not so busy and the sun fills the place with natural light so you can look out onto the desert. Don't be startled as people casually fly by your window as they bungee jump off the tower.   The server was very professional and nice. She brought out complimentary fresh baked rolls with butter and cheese crackers shaped like giant Doritos.   I ordered the lobster BLT and a chocolate martini. Both were amazing- as they should've been for the price. Although it was a little pricy, the experience of eating in a beautiful rotating restaurant with a sweeping view of Vegas was worth it.  I can't wait to go back to experience it at night.   Check out the 3 course prix fixe lunch menu for $49, which includes a petite filet mignon, and the 4 course chef's tasting menu for $98, which includes a lobster tail!",

I only wish there is a way to see it without suffering through the food.  With the price you pay, you get to grind your own pepper...  Now here comes the real bad part.  First, the bread basket had four types of bread that were all cold.  Can't they serve at least at room temp?  Mixed green salad was weltered in marination probably due to sitting too long in the kitchen.  Grass fed rib-eye was so tough, I was getting tired just to slice them not to mention chewing it.  Do the feed the cow with artificial-turf?.  Ahi tuna was simply overcooked.  The correct way (I hope the cooks are reading this) is to slightly brown the surface while inside is stays raw and then slice thinner to plate them.  The tuna was like sponge where moisture was sucked out from freezing/defrosting.  Sweet potato was cold.  We ended up leaving behind more than half of the food.  Just could not bare it.  But the view was phenomenal and relaxing being inside the rotating room.",

I made reservations to take my husband here for his birthday. Reservations were for 9:15pm & unfortunately mother nature wasn't on our side & the big Ridgecrest earthquake hit about 8:30pm. Understandably so the servers freaked out & pretty much all left. When we went to check in at the \"hostess stand\" the man behind the counter was super rude & told us our reservation was cancelled due to the earthquake. He told us to come back tomorrow in which I explained tonight was out last night in town so that wasn't an option. Then he told us we could go to the lounge so we agreed to that. Then we get to the next guy who tells us we can't go to the lounge. Frustrated & hungry we decide to leave in which another guy comes & tells us we can go. Confused but excited we can go we make the journey up the elevator. We get there & a lady tells us we can be seated at the restaurant but it'll take about an hour or we can just eat at the lounge. We put our name down for them to call when a table is ready but go to the lou he in the hopes to order an app & some drinks. As soon as we sit down head chef comes & tells wait staff kitchen is closed. Good god man can this place please provide better communication amongst the employees. We ended up at Yardbird at the Venetian & hot damn that food was well worth the hell we went through!",

The view itself gets 5 stars and the fact that this restaurant rotates and you get to see the beautiful dusty views of Vegas.   I was disappointed with the menu selections, since this is a high end restaurant I did expect them to have more options for non-beef eaters but this place is known for their steaks.   I did ask for a special accommodation and I was informed that if anything is not on the menu they cannot serve it, which was a bummer. I really was not happy with my meal at all and was not worth the $200 my boyfriend spent but he enjoyed his juicy steak.  However, the drinks were delicious and it was yummy...so the drinks were worth it. If you have certain dietary restrictions I highly recommend do not dine here unless you love steak.  However, our server was lovely and even took our picture for us. He did not recommend any specials. I do hope they change their menu, then I'll probably be back. After dinner we did go up on top of the Stratosphere and enjoyed the view, if you dine in the restaurant you get to go up for free and see the view, so many memories you can create there! Definitely a must see!",

Our reservation was at 7:30 pm so we got to enjoy the terrific 360 scenic view of Vegas during the day, sundown, and at night w/ all the bright lights. Also, watching people sky jump off the tower was amusing!  I ordered the 5 course tasting menu and my bf ordered the rack of lamb and a bottle of wine. Portions were big and there was more than enough for the two of us. The lamb was cooked and seasoned well. The tasting menu I got included the following:  Lobster bisque - Lots of lobster, good texture, my bf liked it but I found it to be too salty. Crab cakes - This was yummy! Crispy and golden outside, and soft inside. The papaya salad added a nice balance. Miso black cod - Also yummy. Cooked well, not over seasoned, melts in your mouth. Filet w/ Red Wine Mushroom Sauce - Yum! No A1 here =P Dessert Trio - banana something was my favorite, chocolate cake, and a raspberry mousse.  Service was excellent. Waitress was so sweet and attentive and the staff helps you find your way to the restroom ( a little confusing when you're rotating and had a couple drinks). Not at all disappointed, despite the $200+ bill. Great place for a special occasion, I definitely enjoyed it and will be back.",

She mumbled her words making it very difficult to understand her. When taking our dinner orders she neglected one person, and only came back when we protested. She didn't ask if we wanted appetizers or any side items... she just got the main course orders and turned around and left. Again we protested and got her back to order our salads. The food and the view were outstanding. We had a very nice time. It's too bad they have someone like Elizabeth there trying to spoil it for the guests!  Our bill was about $600; we expected service to match. There are hundreds of great servers in Las Vegas who would love to have the job she seems not to care about.",

We had the 4 course dinner with wine and it was AMAZING! They give you a different type of wine with every course. The food was also AMAZING! The lobster bisque was by far the best Ive ever had and the filet mignon  was perfect. We were so full by desert we barely tasted had any but it was delicious! The room is always moving so you get a full view of all of Las Vegas. The moon was full and the night was impeccable. I had such an amazing experience. I hope to return to Las Vegas one day and I will surely return to this restaurant.",

The waitresses and waiters here are so professional and friendly.  I was given a dodo color orange collard shirt to wear over my Tshirt because we didn't know they had a dress code lol. I can't complain though, most high class restaurants will tell you \"sorry come back later\" but they were cool about it.  Hands down the best complimentary bread and butter assortment I've ever had. 3 different breads/crackers and butters. Shit, I couldv'e ate just that and be happy :)  I had the NY steak I think? I forget because we ate so damn much on our trip to Vegas lol. Anyways it was some beef, but was mmm mmm good. Gfs pasta was good too with huge pieces of shrimp and lobster.  Thanks for the great service and friendly attitudes Top of The World Staff. :) Would return to eat here on my next trip to Vegas again! Visited Aug 2011",

    "text": "I spent Thanksgiving day with my family here, and while the food was absolutely spectacular, I feel compelled to comment on the service, which was, to be honest, terrible.   When we arrived, everything seemed fine, it wasn't until we started looking at the prix-fixe menu that things started to go awry--the waiter assured us that it was a three course meal, despite it being Thanksgiving and despite my having experienced every single other prix-fixe menu being written in such a way that the choices for each course are inbetween thick black lines, indicating the differences in each course. (This menu indicated that this was a FOUR course menu). The waiter told me I was incorrect when I asked, confused, why the two choices for the second course (a lamb chop and scallops) were in a different section on the menu than the main course, Thanksgiving dinner. I was incredibly polite about the whole affair, and he maintained that I was incorrect.  He disappeared for about 15 minutes and finally came back with our drinks. The table next to us that was seated after our arrival had already been given drinks and bread by their server. I had to ASK for bread from our server, and he seemed slightly annoyed that I would ask for such a thing. By the time the bread arrived, we'd been waiting 20 plus minutes for our first course and were absolutely starving. (Our reservation was for 2:15, so by 2:45 and no lunch, we were ravenous.) After he FINALLY brings the first course, he's gotten wind that he was indeed incorrect about the menu, and makes us reorder our food. Cut to about 30 minutes later, I have to ask him exactly what is going on, as the people next to us, (who were, again, seated after us) had already gotten their main course and we'd only been given our appetizer. Also,  the restaurant was absolutely not busy at all. We were among 3-4 tables in our section, two of which were staffed by other servers. The surrounding area was completely empty otherwise.  When I finally grabbed our server again. (After trying to politely get his attention and being ignored, I had to actually WALK to him) I explained that we needed to leave as soon as possible, because we had a 4 pm show at the MGM. I had never DREAMED it would take an hour and a half to get our food from a prix-fixe menu, since everything should be ready to go. Again, the food was lovely, but it really put a damper on Thanksgiving because we had to eat so quickly and were unable to enjoy our food because it took so incredibly long for the server to bring our meal and also because I was so freaking STARVING that I gorged on cheap bread instead of the awesome Thanksgiving dinner!  Finally, I had to actually get up and search for over server because he had been absent for so long, and I've NEVER had to do this, even in a dump like Denny's.   I'm usually pretty easy going about servers being slow--I understand that they can get swamped when things get busy, but the restaurant wasn't busy at all, and the servers taking care of the surrounding tables seemed to have no trouble at all and had a much more friendly demeanor.  Our server was the older gentleman from Oaxaca, and I don't know if he was having an off day or what, but when my family spends several hundred dollars at a restaurant, I expect better service that what one would get at  Olive Garden. I live in Los Angeles, home of terrible waiters, and this guy takes the cake.",

I do have 1 small gripe though, the place smells like lobster bisque as this is the house soup and you have to go through a metal detector to get there, other than that, this place is top notch.",

At that time, very few of the tables were taken, so there was no wait and the restaurant was nice and quiet.  At the end of a fun trip to Vegas, it was great to be able to look down on the whole area and see all the places we'd been.  The tables are located on a ring that rotates, completing a full rotation about once every 90 minutes or so.  Your table is about 800 feet above the ground, so it is easy to see the Strip, downtown, and all the surround area.  It's also fun to see the skydivers jump off the roof above you.  The food was good.  Lunch prices were reasonable.  I had a deliciously tender filet mignon.",

Prices are definitely a little on the high side, however, the food is great and the view is spectacular.  Make sure you go slightly before sunset so you can see Vegas in the sunlight, then the sunset on the mountains, and then the Strip lit up at night.   On to the food: The kobe beef carpaccio was excellent.  The truffle oil and capers were perfect with the thinly sliced meat.  I had the New York Strip, which was perfectly cooked to medium-rare and extremely tasty.  The Cabernet that I had with my steak was definitely too expensive and very average.  The desserts were also great, we shared the strawberry cheesecake lollipops, the chocolate raspberry creme brulee and the mousse cup and all 3 were delicious.  All in all, ToW is slightly overpriced but definitely a spot to hit up for the experience alone.  The service was excellent as well, we were seated promptly, our waiter was attentive and the food came out fairly quickly.",

It was really nice with an awesome view of the strip. There was great live music. Then we got seated and our table was right by the window. We enjoyed an awesome panoramic view of Las Vegas as the restaurant rotated around. The food was mouth-wateringly amazing. We enjoyed some wine and a portobello mushroom and red pepper appetizer. My fiance ordered the Turf & Quack for his entree, and I ordered Miso Black Cod. For sides we ordered ricotta stuffed gnocchi and bok choy. Everything was incredibly yummy! Our server was super nice and we had great service the whole night.   On the ride all the way to the top, we shared the elevator with a few people who were going to jump off the top of the Stratosphere! So, along with the beautiful view of Las Vegas, we got to enjoy watching people JUMP off of the Stratosphere. Over and over there were people just flying by our window! I could see the bottom of the platform where they were standing before they jumped, and then they just hopped right off and down 107 stories (or something like that!).  We had such a great time, the restaurant was perfect for enjoying a romantic evening. I loved it.  :-D If you want to enjoy a memorable and romantic experience with your significant other, this place is a great choice!",

We dine at the Effie tower thinking the restaurant was at the top but it wasn't, it still had a nice view of the water show, but wasn't the experience we had at top of the world.  The restaurant rotates so you get a 360 view during your dinner! That was very cool. The server even came over to point out a few landmarks to us as we rotated. Everything from the salad to the dessert was fantastic. The avocado salad was excellent and not your normal salad. It had avocados,cucumbers,onions and a spicy sauce that made it so delicious. We ordered the porterhouse and that was fantastic. It came with potatoes and Broccoli Rabe which most steakhouses don't include sides. We also ordered the lobster Mac n cheese that was tasty too. The warm butter cake dessert was so good!   Then we got to go to the outside deck since we dine at the top of the world. The dinner was expensive so it was nice that it included that. We walked around the observatory inside and then went outside. They also had a bar lounge and gift shop.  I would definitely recommend this and come back again!",

Top of the World is located at the Stratosphere and I highly recommend you make reservations before sunset so you can watch the sunset from your window seat of the restaurant.   This restaurant is an experience. You are essentially paying for the view and the meal which reflects on the menu. They will have complimentary dinner rolls and butter offered. We ordered the Australian Wagyu skirt steak and the Maryland Crab Stuffed Chicken and a side of grilled asparagus. Everything was delicious and savory. The asparagus was the best I've ever had, it had the perfect amount of garlic and parmesan and complimented the different meats well. The steak was so tender and juicy.   If you are coming to Vegas for the first time and are staying for a short time, COME HERE! The restaurant revolves and that could be a motion sickness thing, but I did not notice it at all. We even got to enjoy some folks bungee jumping off the top!   If you would like to see all of Vegas without visiting all of Vegas, come here. The view is breathtaking and you are guaranteed to have a great time due to the great service of the employees.",

    "text": "Let me make it clear that this is a very conflicting review.  I am not one to give low stars.  Typically I try to find positive things to counter the negative experiences.   I called and made my Valentine's dinner reservation 3 months earlier.   I called twice to make sure we got a window seat as this was a very special Anniversary for my husband and I.   Upon showing up, I checked in and confirmed that I was going to get a window seat.   Young lady that checked us in, confirmed and asked me to wait few minutes to be seated.  Then another person came to seat us.  She proceeded to seat us on the interior portion.   When I asked her to seat us at a window seat as requested,  she very rudely said that those free tables are for VIPs.  I took a picture of those tables as they sat for over 30 minutes without any patrons.  I was super irritated at that!  Our waiter Dennis was pleasant.   The best personality and professionalism came from Sergio (from Mexico).  Sergio was very welcoming and attentive.   In all honesty, Sergio needs to teach a little class and customer service to the rest of the staff at Top of the World.  We ordered... Moon & Star  Mango Maggie Tuna tartare  Crab cake  Mixed green salad  Rib eye with blue cheese  Vegetarian entree (zucchini spaghetti) Asparagus   The drinks were good.  Tartare and Crab cake were good.  The Vegetarian spaghetti was okay.  My husband asked for some hot sauce or flakes and finally got them when he almost finished his plate.  The rib eye was good but that had to be the most plastic baked cheese over it that imitated blue cheese.  It was awful!  I scraped it off and still couldn't finish it as the taste of that baked on plastic tasting cheese was unbearable.   Although in the end, we were given coupons for free Champagne up at the bar,  we couldn't wait to leave.  After making reservations in advance and calling couple of times few times within the week to reconfirm,  we weren't seated where we requested.     Customer service in the front 0 stars Waiter service 3 stars  Drinks 3 stars Food 3 stars  Sergio from Mexico=5stars!  So in conclusion,  this was the biggest disappointment and waste of my money on a very special Anniversary.   Giving 2 stars is me being generous,  considering how upset I was.  Too many options with better food and customer service in Vegas to waste time here.  If you want to go up there, just go have a drink at the bar.  The restaurant is absolutely not worth it!",

We were told they were in the middle of a water and power outage. they told us everything was on track to be back on for a reservation at 7 PM and when we showed up they still were beating around the bush about when exactly everything would be OK to go up. Instead of being truthful about their situation they kept leading us to believe that everything will be OK momentarily and we ended up wasting a whole bunch of time bunch of time. Now we are left to find a last-minute reservation for our anniversary on a Saturday night. So thanks a lot! I probably won't but again just based on the bad taste in my mouth from this experience.",

    "text": "This review is for Top of the World, as a part of my quest to eat at all of the steakhouses in Las Vegas. The overall score is an average of all other categories with steak being counted twice, since it is a review of a steakhouse.    Overall: 4.1 Decor: 5 Bread: 4 Appetizer: 4 Filet: 4 Side: 4 Dessert: 4   Top of the World is a steakhouse located at the top of the Stratosphere tower in the north area of Las Vegas.   The decor is very nice with excellent views of the entire Las Vegas Valley. It actually reminded me of the scene in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade when they were in the restaurant of the zeppelin.    The bread was very good.   I ordered the shrimp cocktail as an appetizer and it was very good.   The filet mignon was also very good.   As a side I ordered a twice baked potato and it was very good.    For dessert I ordered Chocolate cake and it was also very good.   Overall, Top of the World was a pleasant surprise. I expected the food to be mediocre at best, but it was actually very good across the board. The service was absolutely excellent.",

    "text": "Was not pleased with this experience. Unfortunately the breathtaking view was not enough to make up for the terrible service. Our party of 8 was there for a bachelorette trip and only came to this restaurant because it was recommended to us.   We were introduced to THREE servers and none of them were attentive. NONE. The wait times were so  ridiculously long that our dinner took an unnecessary three hours. When we finally received our food, it didn't all come out on time - and we only ordered appetizers and two entrees for our meals. You would think the food would have come out in a timely manner. Nope. I've been a server so I thought \"maybe the kitchen is backed up\" but when I got my chicken it was dry and cold. But I was too hungry to even think about sending it back.    When we were done with our meal, we sat with empty plates and glasses in front of us, for no joke, AN HOUR. We had to ask a buss boy for our server but didn't even catch his name so we couldn't tell this buss boy who our server actually was. We requested our checks and that took another 30 minutes. When we finally got our checks, we were all nervous to even hand over our cards because we weren't sure if we would even get them back.   We requested to talk to a manager who took his sweet time coming to our table. He was a total prick and said \"Sorry about the service. There was a larger party that was more demanding.\" So because we were easy going and polite, we got pushed to the side and ignored.  We told the manager we didn't feel comfortable leaving a tip that was so low or a tip at all without expressing our concerns and, no joke, this manager just shrugged his shoulders!!! So we left without leaving any tip for our three servers. It was the worst experience and a terrible way to start our trip to Vegas. This place consumed our entire evening and I do not feel confident to suggest this place to anyone.",

    "text": "We came here for Mom's 70th Birthday. Beautiful restaurant on the 106th floor. We went for lunch so I'm sure the evening views would be much nicer with the lights.  Our server Jeruscha was pleasant.  The food was very good. I had the Power lunch for $50 which consists of a starter, protein and a dessert. I had caesar  salad, salmon and the desert was a salted caramel creme brulee. Surprisingly, the Caesar salad was larger than I expected. The salmon was tasty and was a nice portion size. The salmon sat on a tasty puree and had a small amount of orange segments. I've had similar menus but typically a side is included so that was a slight disappointment but again does not take away from the delicious taste of the food. Sides ordered were asparagus, brussels sprouts, lobster mac & cheese and fries. The asparagus was really good as well as the brussels sprouts however in my opinion the brussels sprouts could have been a little softer. I did not care for the lobster mac & cheese but that's more preference, I have not found a restaurant to make a good mac & cheese. It honestly is the side I typically never order due to their various disappointments.  On to the desert, I literally had to push the creme brulee away for me. The flavor was divine I am not a huge fan of creme brulee although I've had it several times in the past but I must say this was the best creme brulee I've tasted. I wanted to keep eating this treat as it was very delicious and the serving size exceeding my expectations.",

The views are absolutely stunning at night and the restaurant rotates slowly so you can see the entire city lit up! All of the tables have a view no matter where you sit, so don't worry. You do have to take an elevator to the top and check in with a hostess then you are sat. Our server, Dalia was very sweet. She even moved our table mid dinner so we could sit at the window.   I was disappointed with the quality of the food here. I was expecting much more considering it's on average $100 per person. The food was meek, and all of it came out at room temperature and not warm. The bread was dry as well. I will shoutout the Cavatelli pasta, however because of the flavor. We did the 4 course tasting menu, ordered 8 different dishes and all of them at room temperature and nothing special. It also took 2 hours for service for 4 courses.   I think you should enjoy this restaurant at least once, but you are definitely paying for the view more so than the cuisine.",

The four course experience is $106 per person but with Groupon deal it's $80 some dollars. The lobster bisque was creamy but had somewhat of a smoke taste which I would have preferred less of. The crab cake was exceptional covered in panko bread crumbs and a good portion. The filet mignon phenomenal.  Now for the experience. The level we were on was literally rotating g the entire time and took a little over an hour for a complete 360 of the Vegas skyline. Which at first was a little scary as I felt myself getting dizzy but once I relaxed I was fine. Great service and such a magical experience. Don't forget to stop by top creamery after dinner two more floors up.",

    "text": "One thing is certain, Top of the World delivers some spectacular views of Vegas. The restaurant slowly rotates so you can enjoy all of Vegas as you eat, without getting motion sickness. A full rotation is 80 minutes so plan accordingly.   This is the third restaurant of this kind that I've been to (the others in Seattle and NYC) and they all seem to have the same decor. I think because of this the decor seems a bit dated to me, especially since my visits to the other two were years ago. Also the Stratosphere, recently renamed Strat, is old and dumpy inside. After walking through the rest of the hotel to get here you don't feel like you should be entering a restaurant that is this pricey. The metal detector at the bottom also doesn't lend itself to a classy restaurant but hey I get it, security trumps ambiance.   Now let me get to the food. I decided to share a filet mignon with my friend, since their smallest steak was 10 oz. We also shared a side of fries. Both were more than enough for the two of us and our steak was cooked perfectly (med/well). Our other friend ordered the wagyu steak.  At $30/oz. minimum 4 oz. you would expect this steak to be cooked to perfection. She ordered it medium rare but it came out like medium well. When she brought this to the attention of our waiter he actually argued with her and told her it was the lighting and reluctantly took it back. It came out the second time still cold in the middle. After this she didn't bother waiting for a third one.   Our waiter did apologize for questioning her the first time and offered to comp the lobster mac n' cheese she ordered. He also gave us vouchers to get free champagne at the bar upstairs.   Overall not a bad meal but with all the options in the area I wouldn't return. You can also enjoy the view from the bar upstairs but it does not rotate.",

This time, I was there at lunchtime during the week.  The menu is different for lunch and it was really quite good except for my kids. The chicken sandwich was not suitable for kids (spicy sauce, not \"hot\" spicy, but not kid appropriate either). As a foodie adult, yes, it was great. But the wait staff should know to advise against it for kids. Thankfully one of my kids ordered the burger and between it and two orders of fries, they were full. My wife and I split the chicken sandwich.  Service was rather slow this time, especially considering weekday lunch and that the restaurant wasn't even half full. I remember wondering a couple of times if our server had gone on a break or something.  The main thing that degraded this visit though was the cheesy photographer that was getting everyone to get up from the table and stand for pictures by the windows and in weird, uncomfortable poses. Maybe this is a lunchtime thing only, but at a restaurant of this level, I don't want such things at all. Yes, I came partly for the view, but I don't want pictures like I'm getting on a cruise ship or entering Disney World.",

I got some ice cream and cookies from the little place by the elevators and managed to spill it all over myself.  It was melting in the cone faster than I was eating it so I went back to my hotel to change and just forgot to go back.  The ice cream was delicious and the cookies were just ok.

    "text": "Top of the World may seem a bit gimmicky but it's actually a very nice spot for a special occasion dinner. It's pricey so I don't suggest it for anything other than a treat yo self meal! My bf brought me here for our anniversary and it was the perfect choice. It's located in the Stratosphere and you take an elevator all the way to the top where upon being seated every table is met with a gorgeous view of downtown LV.   The restaurant rotates slowly throughout the meal although unfortunately they were filming a commercial while we were there so we didn't get to experience that. Even so, the view was gorgeous. A professional photographer will come take your photo and sell it to you after the meal. Of course my bf gave in and spent the $30 or $35 for the photo which is a lot! But it's a nice keepsake.  We checked in for our 10pm reservation and waited about 10 minutes to be seated even though the restaurant wasn't full and no one else was checking in. I hate when restaurants do that. But our server was professional and we both really enjoyed the food. The bread basket alone was phenomenal. You can never go wrong with a classic fresh Sourdough loaf, and they also had a chocolate bread which I thought would be nasty but was actually very tasty and unique.  We ordered 2 entrees and 1 side to share, which was a nice amount of food without leaving us stuffed. The USDA Prime Center Cut Ribeye had so much flavor and was exquisitely juicy, without too much fat. I know a ribeye isn't considered as nice a cut as others, but I really recommend it here. The Ora King Salmon over a fennel sauce with lemon butter and citrus segments was high-quality fish and we both enjoyed it, although I think there are other items on the menu that are more exciting. The Lobster Mac n Cheese made with orichette pasta, mascarpone, and bechamel sauce was packed with lobster so we had some in every bite.  Although it might not be the newest and hippest, Top of the World is a special place and definitely has the Vegas vibe.",

You first have to check in at a main desk for restaurant dining and Yu must have reservations or cannot dine. The wait for the elevator was 3 minutes but not too bad as there are double elevators which can fit about 10 at one time.  *DISCLOSURE: You have to pass thru a metal detector so hubbs had to valet his weapon before getting onto the elevator.  The restaurant revolves and take 80 minutes to complete one revolution. Because we had reservations they seated us prior to the couples/groups ahead of us. Made us feel like VIP guests.  We ordered the Power lunch consisting of three courses. We both selected the 5-oz filet mignon w lobster tail, hubbs started w lobster bisque and I picked greens salad, and ended w creme brulee topped w caramel corn.     Even the table breads were delectable-one pair of sweet glazed rolls and glazed French baguette served w pad of room temp butter.   Lobster was topped w rich sauce that we forgot the mini ladles of melted butter set close by our plates. The filets were drizzled w a thin au ju and cooked to perfection mine medium hubbs' med rare both served on a bed of light mashed potatoes.",

    "text": "I came here with two co-workers for dinner on March 21, 2019.  I haven't been to the Strat casino since it was called Bob Stupak's Vegas World, and the surrounding area and casino has gotten worse over time and is very seedy.  After going through security and waiting a long time as there was only one functioning elevator, we made it to the top and walked downstairs to the restaurant area (not sure what people do if they are handicapped).  The view is really nice, and our waiter did a great job.  Two of us ordered ribeyes and the other ordered a filet, with a total of three sides.  After starting with salads, three sides should have been two.  The sides (brussel sprouts, mushrooms, and sweet potatoes) were very good as was the filet, but the ribeyes were very disappointing as they were way too thin.  They do have an excellent wine list, and the bottle of Caymus complimented the meal.  Dessert was the bomb - a huge 20+ layer of chocolate cake that we split yet could not finish.  I wish I could find that one here in Houston it was that good.  If you go to the Strat I wouldn't call it as fine of a dining experience as other places I have enjoyed in Vegas.  The view, uniqueness, and good service made it a memorable time that I will remember more than I would at a high-end steakhouse somewhere on the strip.",

Honestly this place deserves a 10 star review because not only is the view amazing, the staff tentative, and the waiting and dining area well decorated, comfortable, and inviting but the food is truly incredible. I went for a bachelorette weekend and was treated like the queen I am! We had Jason as our waiter who was so well spoken, quick to help, and served us with a smile. I had an old fashioned for my drink and I as strong and decadent- just like I like it! Vegas style lol. When we went they had a three course meal for 106$. I mean come on- if that's not a steal I don't know what is. I got a wonderful salad for my first course, a perfectly season steak, with PLUMP AND BUTTERY shrimp (literally the best!!!), with mashed potatoes and asparagus for my second course, and a trio of ice cream for my third which I didn't have room to finish. If you are trying to choose between this restaurant and another for a wonderful dinner- PICK HERE! Also you should call ahead for big groups.",

This came with a lobster bisque, filet mignon, large lobster tail, and chocolate fruit muse. They also serve complimentary bread with flavored butter.   Everything was just right. The lobster and steak was tender and very flavorful. The dessert was sweet and addictive. I will definitely be back and I would definitely recommend this place.   The only complaint that I have keeping it from reaching 5 stars is the building itself. The atmosphere is just run down and old looking.   The Stratosphere's campaign is to \"take back Vegas\" but they don't seem up to date with the new and upcoming resorts just down the street.   However, the view is definitely worth visiting! Very beautiful. They will charge you $20 just to visit the observation deck. But if you eat at the restaurant or visit the lounge, you can visit the observation deck for free.",

We decided springing for an expensive lunch was worth it for the view. And that's where it went bad.   We sat for 15 minutes before a waitress came over, and then told my wife to relax (it was not busy and 12:30 pm on a Sunday). We were immediately under the impression that we were not a high caliber guest. Translate: the \"I don't think you can afford to eat here\" look. I can't remember the last time I was made to feel unwelcome in a restaurant by superficial wait staff. On the other hand, the sweetheart taking care of our water and bread was attentive and respectful.   The food was very good but ridiculously overpriced. My wife and I eat out regularly and travel quite a bit, so we are not misplaced. For $40-80 a person I expect outstanding good and impeccable service. We got really good food and very poor service.

The pricing was on the expensive side for what you receive, but hey, you're paying for the venue as well.   The wait staff was absolutely wonderful. Very attentive and didn't rush you to eat and leave. Or drinks were always refilled without us asking. Five stars to the staff.   We started with an appetizer of foia gras. It was very well cooked on a bed of bread and caramelized apples. May not be worth the price but it was somewhat enjoyable. I would suggest trying something else if you want bang for your buck.   We also ordered the duck confit and the rack of lamb. The duck was a bit salty and dry, so maybe try something else as well.   The lamb on the other hand was amazing. Cooked to perfection, tender, and well seasoned. Definitely would get this again.   Also had an Arnold Palmer. Do not get this! Water down and nasty. I generally judge a place by how much time they put into the ingredients. Attention to detail is a must. This was lemon water with a splash of tea in ice.   My one True complaint is that I requested a window seat a day in advance for a Thursday which isn't very busy. And there were open tables at the window and they still didn't seat us. This made me drop the rating one star.   This place would have gotten three stars for the lesser table option and the duck I had, but the wait staff definitely raised it another star. I will give it another try and maybe change my review next time. So yes, I will be coming back.",

I had to drench the steak into a1 sauce and salt to get any flavor out of it. However, the meat was very tender which made up for it. Personally, i think eating at texas de brazil is a LOT better. They have a wider selection of meat that is very delicious. However, the best thing i have to say about top of the world is their baked potato. Oh my lordddd that is the most amazingly tasty baked potato ive ever had.",

It takes 1 hour and 20 minutes for a full rotation, which is the effect time for a lunch.  Their food is as good as their view. The lobster bisque and their ultra burger are memorable. In addition to their crab cake and steaks.  Skye was our waitress, and she was a funny and accommodating host.  Thanks !",

First, the table was perfect right next to the window, unobstructed view as we twirled, our service also excellent, and the food was so good!  We got the four course tasting menu but got two extra apps. The big seafood trio with crab, colossal shrimps, and tuna tartar. Very good, we also got pork belly very tender.   Our tasting menu, we got the lobster bisque, fish, filet and desert trio.   Overall, very romatic, good food and great views!",

You are paying strictly for the view as it is breathtaking and we still cant stop talking about it. Now I made my reservation over the phone which she required a $50 deposit apparently because it was new years weekend. To get to this place is a journey in it self. You go on an elevator that goes 21 mph how cool. It's very tight security up there so be prepared. We immediately sat down to a window seat and were blown away. It was 1030pm and vegas lit up. So we started off with bread that was hard as a rock and almost broke my tooth. It is cool they bring you different flavor butters but damn why is the bread so hard? I could not even enjoy the butters because my tooth hurt from the bread. We ordered the pasta and chicken. Absolutely no flavor so bland I was appalled that this nice restaurant had this flavorless food. But we ate it anyway. Note to management: you need to change up your menus and head chefs because if this food was good this place would be the most amazing restaurant out there.",

    "text": "Do yourself a favor and take the $250+ you will spend on dinner for 2, elsewhere.   A little about myself: I worked in the restaurant industry for ten years. I've dined in restaurants at the same price point as Top of the World. I know a good steak when I taste one. You could call me a steak aficionado. I also know good service when I see it.   Trust me when I say, this restaurant was a COMPLETE waste of time AND money.  Let me start with the waitstaff: Lack of formality. Lack of menu knowledge. There were no recommendations made for us, no suggested appetizers, and no complementing glass of wine offered. I was indecisive about which glass of wine I wanted to pair with my $75 steak and the waitress said okay and stared at me before telling me she'd be back.  Water came right away. Then another waiter came and asked if we wanted water. Our glasses had just been filled. The bread basket was brought out quite timely. It contained five pieces of all different bread with four different types of butter, which were described nicely, but not by our waitress but the other waiter who failed to realize we already had water in front of us.   The food was horrible. The cocktail sauce for the Shrimp Cocktail was marinara.  The lobster tail didn't look right, nor taste right.  The steaks were huge but the flavor and texture were off. I let an 8 oz filet and 6 oz lobster tail go right to the garbage. The manager stopped over as soon as the food was dropped, before we had a chance to taste it, and we never saw him again.   The only thing that was decent was my glass of Shiraz and the view. Complete disappointment. Complete waste of money.",

And for the record, they require business casual, but they don't enforce that rule during the summer due to the heat.  I found this out by sweating my ass off while walking in business casual attire only to see someone walking out of the restaurant in a t-shirt and cargo shorts.    Don't pay to ride to the top of the Eiffel Tower.  Don't pay to ride the Ferris wheel.  Have dinner here to get, without question, the best view of Vegas.  It doesn't even matter where you sit because the Stratosphere slowly rotates so you get to see a 360 degrees view.  They bring out various types of bread and various types of butters which I found all to be good.  My wife got the salmon.  The plating didn't look that nice to me but she said it tasted great.  I started off with the lobster bisque which was excellent.  The soup was followed up by the roasted chicken.  It was very tasty.  Could've used less salt, but the presentation was good and it tasted equally as good.  Stay away from the alcoholic beverages.  I wanted to try a couple of their martini's.  Didn't find out they were $15 a pop until afterwards.  And don't get sticker shock when you see your bill.",

    "text": "If you want a fine dining experience in beautiful Las Vegas, this is the place to go.  I always wanted to dine on top of  the world and watch the city lights from below.  We came here around 4 pm, planning to make a reservation for 6 pm, while we spent time doing the crazy rides.  The lady at the booth helped us make our reservation and allowed us to bypass the security lines for the rides since we were their guest.  Upon checking in and requesting a window seat, the hostess said she would send us a text when our table was ready while we waited at the Observation Deck bar.    The hostess did hook us up as we got a nice table overlooking the strip.  Our waiter was friendly and came often to refill our drinks.  We shared a lobster bisque as our appetizer and the waiter even offered to give us two bowls.  The bisque was amazing and creamy.  We also got delicious bread with 3 types of butter.  I think it was normal butter, basil butter and mango butter.  For my entree, I ordered a seafood dish that had shrimp, scallop and lobster with a side of vegetables. I can't quite remember, but it was delicious, just a tad bit salty.  It was definitely portioned a lot better than the Lobster Tail I ordered at Alexander's that left me feeling unfulfilled.  The restaurant rotated slowly so that you could see the view of the strip.  It was romantic and refreshing.  My boyfriend joked that if he had a ring, it would have been the perfect place to propose.  We were full by the end of the night, so did not opt for any expensive dessert (especially since they no longer carried the delicious tiramisu that I read about).  When we inquired about any birthday dessert, they did bring out a little lava brownie, which was cute.  It was the perfect dinner to have before watching Le Reve.",

The service was spectacular from the moment we walked up to the security area. The hostesses were personable and our waiter was fantastic!   Please note: if you wish for a window seat, you may have to wait. Even online, when making the reservation it states it's based on how busy they are. All seats appear to have a good view, but obviously, the window view is preferred by many. We had a group sit next to us where a grown woman, quite literally, pouted for the duration of our meal. Luckily, for us... I requested a window and they weren't too busy when we arrived. I also noted it was our anniversary and each person (hostess, the lady who took us to our table, and the waiter) congratulated us on 10 years. A very nice touch!  I got the 14 oz. New York Strip, which comes with two small carrots. I also ordered the wine recommended for that dish - a great choice! The steak was flavorful and cooked perfectly. My husband got the rack of lamb and said it was the best he had ever had. I even tried it for the first time - and it was wonderful. We both got the caesar salad (the best salad I've had) and shared the potatoe puree side (comes with fontina cheese/breadcrumbs.) Everything, down to the bread with flavored butters, was incredible. While the dessert tray was enticing, we were too stuffed to think about trying anything.  As someone else mentioned, it might be nicer if folks stuck to a \"fancier\" dress code. The pouter mentioned above was in cutoffs and a tank, while folks surrounding her were in sports jackets. I'd definitely return and recommend to anyone. Thanks, Top of the World, for a great meal and experience.",

The other seats are great as well but the booth gives you a view a little higher up outward facing vs the tables that you'd have to turn your head to see things. We each had the tasting menu with the wine pairing. The food was excellent, and cooked perfectly.  The portions surprisingly generous, considering it's a tasting menu. The wine pairing was a great ad on I wish they were slightly more generous with the portions.  Service was excellent and courteous. Lastly there is a photographer who will take your pic if you'd like. There is a cost associated so be sure to ask first, we didn't and I felt bad when we only purchased 1 pic because I imagined it takes time and at least some cost to print and assemble the pics on the spot.",

So we had an AMAZiNG dinner here for my parent's 25th anniversary. We got a champagne that our server recommended which was delicious. Then we had the trio appetizer of the foie gras, crab cakes, & scallops. That was my favorite thing there! Soooo freaking YUMMM. Then we had the Surf & Turf which was also good.   Service was very attentive & superb.   I would definitely come back again for a special occasion :)",

The food quality and presentation is nothing short of fantabulous!  Go there before sunset and you will enjoy an amazing sunset from the top of the Stratosphere. The restaurant itself rotates 360 degrees each and every hour. You will see the Las Vegas city lights come alive! The wine selection is outstanding and the staff is simply the best. By the way, order their world famous Chocolate Tower. It is absolutely perfect with a great wine!!  Bon Appetit!!",

It still had red lipstick from the previous customer. GROUSE!! When the meal arrived, it was not cooked as we had ordered. We specifically ordered Medium Rare and it was sent out done. Soooo done, like a boot. The steak was horrible and for what you pay ( $60 plus ), it's not worth it. This is the worst experience I've ever had!! Save your $$$ and go elsewhere. Such a waste of time and a HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!!!!! They don't even deserve one star, that's how bad it was.",

Husband had a wonderful burger (cheese, beef and shredded short rib meat!!! - yummo).  Not being that hungry, I ordered a small green salad - (hold the beets): about $12.  I asked that they add some grilled shrimp, just to make it more interesting.  Four (4) large shrimp surrounded my salad greens -- very tasty and just the right amount for me.  Then the bill arrived.  Salad:  $35.00.  Are you kidding me???? $22.00 for four shrimp???    Where did they have to go to get them?   I can overlook overcharging for wine at $12 - $16 a glass - but come on: $ 5.50 for one shrimp????",

My Fiance got the Prawns, scallops and lobster and thought it was good but not great.  And my friend's wife got the center cut filet which she enjoyed.

While good, the cheapest steak if $47, but remember that it would cost you to go up to the observatory anyway, so we tried to mentally subtract the cost of just that ticket from the meal price. We spent about $250 for the 3 of us. The service was great - Glenn - our server, was phenomenal. Loved the view. We ended up going around 2 revolutions (and we had wanted a leisurely meal so we could see both day and night views (our reservation was at 6:45 to facilitate this in mid-August). After dinner, we walked up to the next two decks, the top deck being open air observation deck. There, you could catch a glimpse of the people doing the \"attractions.\" It was our son's 10th birthday and we made a reservation on OpenTable and noted it was his birthday. Everyone who helped us from hostess to Glenn made a point to wish him Happy Birthday, which made him feel special. While we didn't order desert because were were full from a delicious lobster bisque (with lobster in the center of the bowl and the soup poured around it at table), and the skirt steak, Glenn surprised our son with a s'more dessert with a candle. It made his night very special. They also called you by name and gave you that extra special attention. All our needs were met - from a request for more garlic pesto butter, to making a special virgin drink for our son. It is definitely something we were glad we did once while in Vegas. There is a photographer who comes around to take your picture (like on a cruise ship) but there wasn't any real pressure to (a) take the photo or (b) buy them (approximately $65).",

Our server was more than happy to walk us through the menu and offer his opinion, and he recommended this 4 course tasting menu for $90. As he was explaining what the offer entailed it is my opinion that he purposely mislead us to believe that it was $90 for two people when in reality it was $90/ per person. As he was explaining what we got for our money he used phrases like \"You each get to pick from one of the following options\" and \"this deal is perfect for couples\". I remarked that it seemed like a deal too good to be True and he confirmed that it was the \"Best value on the menu for parties of 2\" needless to say we were more than a little shocked when we received our bill and saw that it was double what we had expected it to be.   Instead of confronting the waiter we paid the bill (tip included) and left right away, feeling tricked and a little stupid.   Pros: Easily the most delicious steak either of us have ever had. Cons: Felt mislead and tricked by our server.",

The crab cakes tasted alright, nothing special, but it was such a small portion. The appetizer was for two people and only came with one crab cake ($18). However, the au gratin potatoes were good.

It was quiet when we go there and ordered drinks (which were ok).   But damn, those sliders have been haunting my mind so much that I would fly back to Las Vegas, eat them, and go right back home if I wanted to. I don't know what special sauce they put it them, but the sliders are delicious! I still think I can taste them right now.   So do yourself a favor, go during lunch on an off day, grab a drink, eat some sliders, and watch the crazies bungy jump off the building.",

We made a reservation weeks ago for lunch at 3, because the lunch menu is reasonably priced. $50 per person as opposed to $102 per person. We arrived on time and it took about a half hour to seat us and right before we were seated we were told it's ONLY dinner menu, for today? I asked why and that when I made my reservation no one told us that. The chef and establishment is trying to con us out of our money just to make more money for New Years. Needless to say we left and ate elsewhere! Top of the world ruined our anniversary because they are money hungry and also didn't have the common sense to say it's only dinner all day UNTIL we were basically seated. When I called I made sure it was going to be lunch at 3 pm and I was told it would be. Never ever ever eating nor coming here again in my entire life! They ruined what was suppose to be a special day for my fiance and I. Selfish and money hungry.",

    "text": "Top of the World or Vegas world at least.  At the last moment, my eating companions decided to eat here versus somewhere else.  It was off the strip but was told well worth the cab ride and the view is spectacular.  Yep, despite the location away from the strip, I would have to agree that this place is great for the breathtaking views and their food.  Located in The Stratosphere tower, you have to make your way up to the 106 floor to this lounge/restaurant.  I am told that it takes approximately 120 min to go around the valley of Vegas.  The views are great during your dining experience with no obstructing view for your enjoyment.  Though the menu is a little pricey, you get good food and view.    We bought our own bottle of wine so it saved us a bit for the food.  For our appetizers, I got the tuna tartare. That was ok. Kinda fishy.  The oysters were good along with the foie gras.  Better eat them while you can before California's law goes into effect in July. No foie grae. Ugh!!!!  Again, I decided to order the Muscovy duck with a light glazed with asian bok choy and lightly seasoned salad on the side.  It was asian fusion-like that was quite good, surprisingly.  While my other companion decided to go with steak, lamb chops and more foie gras.  The food was quite good.  I would come here for the food more so than the view.  I can't take the view home but I certainly can take the food home.  In my belly. Lol  The service was attentive and I have to give it to our waitress who did an excellent job to accomodate our palates. Again, it was an expensive dining experience, but for the view along witht the food, you can  not put a pricetag on such.",

(Gnocchi was a little grainy/too soft and squishy.)  Kids' filet, while a neat idea, was $30 for a 5 oz cut.  Wife liked her cobia and crab cake (a little too much garnish on crab cake for her taste.)  Pork belly appetizer was pretty good.  Views are great (go about an hour before sunset and watch the day turn to night), our kids were well-behaved (and complimented, always cool) and the drinks are good (wife loved the blueberry martini and the sangria is good.)

We had a party of 6, it was a birthday celebration and we had a limousine scheduled to pick us up after dinner. At our appointed scheduled dinner time, they refused to seat us because two of our party had not arrived. 20'minutes...  refused! Almost 30 minutes...Still refused. Finally, I told them, we're on a schedule and if the last two don't show up, they simply won't eat. We're not going to destroy this birthday celebration and lose our limo ride because of two people. I could not believe this treatment. I'm sure if Wayne Newton said he was ready now, they would not experience this kind of service. They finally seated us. When our limo arrived, I had to pay for the driver to sit outside while we finished dinner.  If you're entire party is not on time, don't expect to eat until they show up.",

First of all the elevator ride to the restaurant takes only 32 seconds which is really moving. The staff from the elevator operator to the reception area at the top were all polite and professional. The view is amazing and the rotating platform you are on gives you great views of the city.  We were brought to our table and our server came over quickly. He was knowlegable and had a very good personality. The food quality was very good. My wife had the prix fix dinner which included king salmon and prawns. I had the lobster thermador which consisted of a two and a half pound Maine lobster. Both meals were prepared well and I know my wife would like to go back. The only thing is the cost of the food was quite pricey but I guess that includes the view. For the two of us with one drink each and tip it came to just under $400.  If you are looking for the total experience it is worth it, but if you are looking for a restaurant in that price range there are better options.",

THIS WAS  THE WORST EXPERIENCE I ever had. I can understand changes happening when the company changes ownership. That's Vegas but these changes were all terrible.    Let's start with my family's and friends favorite appetizer the Pork Belly.  It's no longer on the menu. WTF? The menu has been cut down with very limited options.  I ordered the ribeye med rare. It came out dripping blood. WOW!  My mom order the filet mignon med rare and it came out cooked perfectly.  I wanted to try something different for the Top of the World so my side item was the macaroni lobster.  It came out looking like and tasking like  it came from the box  called Suddenly Salad. Yuck.   Time for dessert! Why would you take away the dessert cart?  Bad Move!  Sight is 100% up sale on its own. The cart would pass the table and you would pick out what you were going to have for dessert before you ordered the main entree.  I will not be coming back unless I hear of some original menu items coming back.",

The warm spinach salad was light enough for me. We also had the lobster macaroni. We didn't expect that much lobster meat in it. Quite a great deal! My mom had the crab cake and she enjoyed it very much. Unfortunately, I forgot to take any pictures of the food. Was mostly absorbing the view. I must say the service was incredible. They really made you feel very welcomed and attentive, but not in the annoying kind. They just appear when you need them. Once again, I think I will definitely come again next time when I visit.",

    "text": "We had dinner at Top of the World in the Stratosphere and it was a fun experience.  The restaurant revolves 360 degrees so you get a great view of all of the strip, downtown and the outskirts of Las Vegas.  The menu is minimal - focusing on classic like Wagyu, Chilean Sea Bass and Lobster Thermidor.  I had the salmon - it was served with green beans, polenta and a small side of lobster.  I chose the Riesling, which the menu said paired well with the fish dish.   I wasn't disappointed.  The salmon was delicious!  It was beautifully presented on the bed of polenta with the lobster and green beans on top.  The salmon was perfect; buttery and flaky and it was absolutely delicious with the polenta.  We also had the cheesecake for dessert and, of course, it was absolutely decadent!  A perfect way to finish off our dinner.  The only downside was the long wait for the elevator (there's only two elevators to the top) and when the restaurant rotated around towards the sun, it was IN YOUR FACE.  They had shades for the windows but only for the bottom panes, not the top.  So the sun was shining in my face for a bit until we rotated away from it.  I'd definitely recommend having dinner here later in the evening when the strip is lit up.  I'm sure it's an absolutely amazing view.",

    "text": "What an experience!! I have been wanting to check this place out since I moved to Vegas and finally had the chance. I'm scared of heights so I was very relieved when we were escorted to a booth a good distance from the windows but you faced the windows, you also face the table directly informant of you so it can kinda seem like your staring at them eat.  The view was absolutely breathtaking, being able to look out into the city to the mountains simply beautiful. Be warned you might see a jumper lol half of the restaurant gasped when someone was on the free fall thing.  We were seated and the waiter was right with us, he gave us a rundown of the menu and he's recommendations.  The wait staff was absolutely amazing they make you feel very important while your there. I went with the taster menu that gave me 4 courses price was $103.  It came with my choice of two different salads and lobster bisque, I went with the lobster bisque because I had never had it before and I figured if I'm going to try it a upgrade restaurant would be the place to try it. I enjoyed it, there were a few pieces of lobster and it was extremely rich in flavor. Second choice was out of scallops, pork belly or portobello mushrooms, I already had my eye on the pork belly. It was paired with corn black beans green onion and a salsa. The flavors were so good together I could have eaten more. Main course I went with the Fillet mignon and shrimp scampi that also had green beans and mashed potatoes. The steak melted in my mouth, the shrimp were nice size and delicious.  My husband ordered steak and lobster. The first thing my husband said when he cut into the steak was \"just like cutting butter, I can tell this is going to be good\" he agrees with my five stars. I definitely recommend giving this place a try if your looking for a romantic place to eat and for a special occasion. You will be paying about $150-200 minimum per person.",

    "text": "I visited this place when I went to Vegas for my birthday around late February/ early March and the food was amazing! I got a steak (forgot what cut) medium rare and it was juicy and buttery it literally melted in my mouth! I got it with a side of fries (mediocre tbh) and a side of lobster mac & cheese that I had to order two of because it was so good my sister took it from me! The waitress seemed to be in a rush taking our order-- but she was kind overall. I asked for a wine pairing recommendation and I didn't like the wine that was recommended but I don't really like reds anyway so it was my fault. My sister ordered the chicken breast (not pictured) and it was equally delicious. Some of the best cooked chicken I've ever had. Also the restaurant spins in circles as you dine but it's very subtle so you don't get nauseous. I sat further back (pictured) but maybe sitting right next to the window might have been a different experience in terms of nausea. Only down side was the lighting-- very dark, but that's to be expected in steak houses. Also VERY pricey but since the food and the experience was good, I did not mind! Besides this is a place you go to treat yourself, not your local steakhouse you visit a couple times a month. If you're not willing to splurge on great steak, and a great view, don't bother. BUT if you're down, eat here ONCE and you won't regret it!",

You check in at the front desk of the lower floor then you go through security. Security will search your bag and you have to go through a metal detector.  The elevator will take you up to the 106th floor where a hostess will bring you to your seat. TIP: reserve a window table for the best view in Las Vegas. You get 360 degree views of the city because the restaurant rotates.  The menu is on the pricier side. Be prepared to spend about $100 a person before drinks. We got the chef's tasting menu which was about $100 a person. We added the wine tasting which was an additional $30 a person. The wines were pre selected but you have two or three options for the food items.  I had the lobster bisque to start which was excellent. My next course was the scallop, yes singular because it was one. It was average. For my main course I had the filet mignon. It was a generous size and came with mashed potatoes and green beans. It was very delicious and filling. The last course, dessert, was creme brulee and chocolate mousse. The creme brulee was good but the chocolate mousse was outstanding. All the wine pairings were tasty and complimented the courses.  The waitstaff was very friendly.  TIP: Dining in the restaurant gets you complimentary access to the 107 bar and the observation deck. Rides are an additional fee.",

The restaurant takes 80 minutes to complete a revolution--we had enough food and drink to make three laps:) There were four Sommeliers to assist with your favorite wine. The seafood tower was excellent and was more than enough for two people. Also had the fillet and stuffed chicken-both fantastic but brought most if it home as we were stuffed from all the chilled seafood. Wine was great, cocktails were great. Assorted bread basket was a nice addition too. We didn't make it to the observation deck that night due to rain and lightning that kicked up at the end of dinner. We came back a couple nights later, explained what happened and of course they let us back up top for some outdoor viewing. Just prior to making it to the top, we stopped in the lounge one floor below for some drinks, comfortable seating, and great views. Go and enjoy. Cheers!",

The bar is located above the restaurant and has many sitting areas around the bar along with seating at the bar. The happy hour was offering half off drinks specials and appetizers. We decided to just grab a drink before the show and check out the gorgeous views of Las Vegas.  The bartending staff was very friendly and attentive. The environment was very clean.

    "text": "A visit to the Top of the Stratosphere was on our to do list while in Vegas. Doing research, the Top of the World restaurant got great reviews so we decided to make a lunch experience. At $60 pp for lunch , it is not cheap for a family of four but it was well worth it. If you buy lunch, it includes the otherwise $25 fee for a ticket to the rotating top of the space needle which I believe is or used to be the tallest structure in Vegas.  The Stratosphere hotel itself is unremarkable....somewhat old, outdated and it smells of your aunts basement who chain smokes. However, once we got to the top for lunch, it is a different world,... refined, sophisticated and the views were stunning. What's more, the food was even better! I ordered the steak and lobster, with a Caprese salad as my appetizer. Wifey has Crab cakes and lobster bisque. We all had creme brulee for dessert.  All I can say is...$&;@!  Best meal we had in Vegas. I'll spare you the details but every single item was sheer perfection. Add to that the rotating view of the strip and surrounding mountains and it was a truly memorable experience!  At the top are also several death defying rides (see YouTube). While my family did not have the stomach to get on the rides, we spent quite a bit of time watching others take the challenge. We took lots of pics as well.   Highly recommend putting this experience on your Vegas list.",

Sherene was a pleasure to interact with and definetely enhanced the role et of my night and early morning. Thank you!",

    "text": "My fiance and I ate here to celebrate our anniversary. I love scenic views and the view up there was amazing. It is a revolving restaurant so you are able to see EVERYTHING. You can even see airplanes waiting to deplane, which was awesome. This restaurant is located inside the STRAT hotel.   Tip/ I would make reservations in advance. We did not have to wait for our table to be ready. We were able to be seated right away and our seat was next to the huge glass windows. We were able to see the view of everything pretty up close.   Ambiance/ Romantic for sure. Candlelit and pretty dim lighting so you are able to see the nice view outside.   Food/ So good. I ordered the lobster bisque as an appetizer and it was delicious. I also ordered the scallops and they were made perfectly. My fiance ordered the 16oz ribeye steak, and it was juicy. Some restaurants when we order steak, they end up being really dry and chewy, with no flavor at all. The steak at Top of the World, was flavorful. We also ordered the 21 layered chocolate cake for dessert. SO GOOD. But since it was a big slice, we ended up taking it home as well. Portions are great.   Service/ Waitress and Waiters were awesome and on top of everything. Checking in every once in a while to see how we were doing. Offering to top off our waters. She even offered to take our picture! We never had to waive down a server to help us out. They beat us to it always, which is by far the best service we have ever received.   Photographer/ There are photographers going around asking if you'd like to take photos. I RECOMMEND THIS. Especially if you are out on a date with your loved one. The pictures came out perfect. It is something we will treasure for the rest of our lives.   Would I come back? That is a definite yes.  If you have not tried this place out, I suggest you do! Perfect for date night!",

    "text": "Top of Vegas means you gotta be up on the Stratosphere for an epic meal. We came here for my friend's birthday dinner and it was a spectacular event with a rotating dining area and bungee jumpers taking the plunge. Don't come to eat here if you don't like seeing people falling.  Since you're paying for the view, expect to pay some high end prices for your meal. Their menu consists of mostly new American options such as cuts of meat, seafood, and more. On the night we went, they offered a tasting menu for $106 where you can sample a lot of their specialties. Given my budget, I opted for their RIbeye ($59) and split some table sides of asparagus and Brussels sprouts.  First came the bread basket which was utterly disappointing. Our bread was incredibly stale so for the first time ever, I decided to not touch it beyond the first few bites. One of their bread options was so stale that you can use it as an edged weapon.  My ribeye cooked medium-rare was actually very good. Juicy inner portions of red meat with a seared outside made it very chewy and tender. For a 16oz portion, this was actually a lot of meat that took a while to get through. I was very happy with this plate even if it took us over an hour to get the food.  Service was okay as it took a very long time for them to finally get our order. On a personal level, I also was a bit taken back at how the servers near groveled at your every whim. Our server was exceptionally nice but almost to a point where he would apologize and excuse himself for every small thing. I understand it's a high end restaurant but it felt uncomfortable having him act this way... it's like I wonder what he says behind the scene in the kitchen when not around customers. You can't stay perky that long lol.  So while the food was pretty good, the high prices and extremely up and down service/wait time made this probably a once-in-a-lifetime experience for me.",

    "text": "A friend suggested we have dinner at the Top of the World since we both never been there before.   In order to find the elevator to the restaurant you have to go through the casino and up a flight of escalators to where the showroom is located. They have a reception desk just to the left of that. From there you go through a security metal detector to take the elevator up.  Another reception desk is located as you exit the elevator to check-in. It was a little crowded and could have been organized better as diners are trying to get in/out of the elevator while others are waiting to be seated.  Once we were seated it was no problem. Our server was Jeruscha and she made sure everything was taken care of. The view from the restaurant is second to none in Las Vegas. The restaurant revolves so you have a 360 view of the city.  Our meal consisted of Caesar's salad, Lobster Bisque, Shellfish Tower and the 40oz Dry Aged Porterhouse Steak. Both the salad and bisque was good. The seafood tower was HUGE! It could have been a meal in itself with jumbo shrimp, snow crab pinchers, lobster and king crab legs. The Porterhouse steak was was good as well. For dessert we ordered the Baked Alaska and Creme Brulee which were both excellent.  The ambiance, view, service and food makes Top of the World a must visit.!",

    "text": "Great views and good service.  Our waiter was a hoot.   The portion sizes were more than we anticipated.  My guy and I went on Groupon for the meal deal.  We ended up ordering:  Lobster bisque:  3 stars- a tad salty, but still good flavor.  Had chunks of lobster in it and was plated well.  Fillet mignon:  3 stars- a large portion, but a bit salty for my guy's liking  Salmon:  5 stars-  similar to how a moist Seabass would be lightly glazed and seared to perfection.  Mmm.  There were 2 pieces of shrimp that were plated along with this, and they were just as good and buttery.  Crab cakes:  3 stars-  lightly salted with a good crust.  Unsure but the texture wasn't sitting well with me.  Dessert:  5 stars- neopolitan ice cream (strawberry, chocolate, vanilla) covered in a thin chocolate shell  Creme brulee- 4 stars- a tad sweet, but oh so decadent.  Tip:  give yourself a good amount of time to take pictures at the top, unfortunately we rushed on over to see \"O\" so we couldn't do this.  Otherwise, have your phones ready to record the jumps from the side windows.  They're definitely a spectacle.",

From the view to the service to the food, this was a top dining experience. Our server Isaac was so sweet and helpful.   I ordered the Australian Wagyu strip steak with sweet potato fries and burssel sprouts. The steak was cooked perfectly to my order, literally melted in my mouth. The fries were also yummy. The brussel sprouts were unfortunately disappointing. The aioli tasted like mayo which completely turned my taste buds off. But our server was great and didn't include it in the bill which was a great gesture. The view, while eating the perfectly cooked steak, and sweet po -teets was one I will always remember.   This is a location you must go to of you're in Vegas. FYI it is reservation ONLY and they pack up fast enough so don't make it the same day of (a couple days before is best). I would also recommend going at night versus during the day because the city lights are just one of a kind.  A trip to the observation deck is included with your dining experience so also make sure to take advantage of that!",

    "text": "I was having a girl's weekend with a few of my closest friends and we wanted to have a fancy dinner out. We decided to look at Groupon to see if there was anything worth trying. I noticed the Groupon for Top  of the World at The Strastasphere had four stars. I read through some of the reviews and it sounded like the majority of the people had a great experience.   The Groupon was for their 4 course dinner for $87. It's normally a $106 meal. That's a great deal, so we went ahead and purchased it and made reservations. I am SO glad I did!  We made reservations for 7:00 and requested window seating. This was the perfect time as we got to witness the sunset during our meal and see the glittery lights of the strip as the evening went on. The dining room rotates at very slow speed so you get a 360 degree view!   Not only was the food delicious but the view, service, and ambiance of the restaurant was spectacular. Our server's name was Frank and he was very helpful and patient with us. He helped us make decisions on our dishes and was very personable.   The meal begins with a beautiful basket of artisan bread and butter. The presentation of the bread was better than the bread in my opinion. This was the only setback of the meal. The bread was more baguette style and very hard. The best tasting bread was what our server called the fig bread. It was sweet and much softer than the rest of the breads in the basket.   Because we went in a party of 4, we opted to order different items on the first 2 courses, so we could try a bit of each.   Lobster Bisque: I was highly impressed with the presentation of this soup! They place the bowl of soup in front of you with the lobster in the center and pour the bisque over it. This soup was as I imagined it to be! The bisque was savory, smooth, and sweet. It complemented the sweetness of the lobster very well. Absolutely delicious!   Ceaser Salad: this was your basic ceaser salad with crispy romaine, Parmesan cheese, and croutons. It was tasty and the serving was big, but I much prefer the bisque!   Crab Cakes: the crab cake was very good. There was plenty of crab which complimented the flavor of the saffron aoli and arugula beautifully.   Cavatelli Pasta: this pasta dish had a lot of flavor profiles, but they all worked so well and it was my favorite of the second course. The wagyu Beef was melt in your mouth delicious. Frank recommended that we mix the dish up, but I opted to just take a bite of each item together. I was hesitant about the horseradish cream, but the spiciness and coolness melded so well with the beef.   Filet Mignon and Shrimp Duo: Melt in your mouth delicious and the huge juicy shrimps cooked to perfection!   Salted Caramel Creme Brulee: This was a big serving and very good. It was smooth and had the perfect crunchy top a creme brulee should have! The addition of the popcorn was also fun.   If you're ever in Vegas and looking for a fun dinner experience, I highly recommend coming here. Keep in mind though, it will be a longer dinner since it's 4 courses. You will also want to stay and enjoy the views throughout the rotation. We were there for about 2 hours total.",

Be warned though, you only get one! Oh did I mention the delicious warm bread?! It was so good, 4 different types! I got the lobster bisque and absolutely loved it! It's rich and delicious and has chunks of lobster in it! We weren't too hungry so shared the cut rib eye with pepper sauce and a side of brussel sprouts! The steak was delicious and tender and quite big even though it was the 10oz one! The pepper sauce was a good accompaniment but the brussel sprouts were so darned good!!!  For dessert we couldn't pass on the warm butter cake! So delicious!!! When we were seated I was excited because we got the booths so could face the lights but then I realized that I couldn't set up my phone to do a hyperlapse of the skyline because I would get all the people sitting in front of me!

Please note you will also have to go through security. Seemed more like going to an attraction than dinner. Once in the dinning room, the view is spectacular. It's breathtaking! The room rotates 360 degrees in 1 hour. At some point in the rotation you see the people above bungee jumping. That's pretty cool to watch! The wait staff were nice however the service was slow. Don't plan on going unless you got 3 hrs of time to give them.   As for the food..it was ok. Our table had mixed reviews depending on the dish compared to the price. You definitely did not get what you paid for. For the price the taste of the food should have least started at the quality of \"Ruth Chris Steakhouse\" if you know what I mean. I ordered the Salmon dish and Brussels Sprouts and my husband ate the stuff crab chicken with lobster Mac and cheese. We sort of ate each other's. The salmon was good and the lobster Mac and cheese was awesome. The other 2 dishes just average.   If I had to do it again, I'd definitely go again. But I'll pass on a 2nd visit. This is a solid 3.5 review.",

Our group was very frustrated with process.  Once you find the check in location you will go through \"security.\" Now this is an utter joke. I watched as the lone security officer let people through *beep* after *beep*.  People would simply chuckle and make their excuse.  The guard never had them go back through the metal detector or question what they actually had.  So what's the point!?   Then I try to pass through \"security\" with a wine bottle and you would think I'm Michael Corleone.  The guard said I couldn't bring it up and told me I'd have to stow the bottle somewhere. Which is strange because the restaurant has a corkage fee.  So I ask if they could call the restaurant.  Instead they call their supervisor.  Yup.  Still a no go.    So then we walk back to where we checked in.  They explained that the wine bottle can't go up with me and that they must take up 107 floors.  Apparently 9/11 triggered this rigorous security process. So back through the metal beepy thing and then you wait for an elevator. The elevator only holds about 10-12 bodies so we had to wait 2 cycles.    So now that is out of the way the restaurant and food is great.  I didn't even know the restaurant rotates!  About 1 rotation an hour so you can see everything.   We ordered the dry aged  28 day porterhouse which is probably the best steak I've had in Vegas.  Better then Joes, Echo & Rig and Mastros.  Yeah, I was shocked too. It can feed about 3 people and comes with two sides.  Retail price: $159.00 and worth it.   We also tried the lobster mac & cheese that was worth the $19.00.  We finished with the warm butter cake which was delicious.  I was pretty  impressed by Top of the World.  The view really was incredible and the food was just as good.  Just getting their sucked.",

    "text": "No complaints at all about Top of the World restaurant, located on the 106th floor of the Stratosphere tower; This restaurant gets a solid 4.5 stars from me.  Food and service were both excellent, the views of Vegas and the Strip unrivaled, and for fine dining, the price wasn't out of line.  We decided to try this place for late dinner on a Tuesday, and found that they had a 9 p.m. reservation available.  We were greeted on the ground floor at a welcome desk by a host who took our names, verified our reservation and invited us to go through the metal detector and take the elevator up to the 107th floor.  Once there, the elevator opened to a hostess stand where they again verified our names and after a brief 5 minute wait, took us down a staircase to the main restaurant on the 106th floor and showed us to our table.  The restaurant really wasn't full on this night, so we were lucky enough to snag one of the larger tables for 4 just in front of the windows.  According to at least one website, this rotating restaurant makes one trip around every 80 minutes, but to me, it seemed to move a bit faster.  One can definitely tell you're moving, and it seemed that, before we were even served our dessert courses, we were back looking at the same view we could see when we first arrived.  For starters we had the shrimp cocktail.  We then ordered the skirt steak and the ribeye and planned to share both, and had the lobster mac and cheese as our shared side.  We enjoyed a bottle of Jordan Cabernet Sauvignon with our meals, and finished off with the creme brulee.    Everything we had was exceptional, both steaks cut like butter and everything was very flavorful, including the breads and butter we were given upon our arrival.  As previously mentioned, pricing wasn't terribly out of line for a better restaurant in a larger city: The shrimp cocktail was $19, the ribeye $59 and the skirt steak $47.  The lobster mac was also $19 and the creme brulee dessert $12.  The bottle of Jordan, however, was a bit pricey at $105.  For everything we ate and drank, our bill came to $282.53 before gratuity.  Again, not bad for fine dining in a larger city and the quality of the steaks and other foods really was superb.  The only possible critique is that it seems they overly hype the height of this building and restaurant.  They claim, for instance that it's on the 106th floor, with the bar above on the 107th.  The elevator attendant made a big deal about how long it takes for the double deck elevator to get from the bottom floor all the way to the top, etc. That said, the Sears tower is 110 floors tall and is much, MUCH taller than the Strat, so it seems that their floor count is a bit exaggerated, or mostly hype.   That said, it's an interesting dining experience to have a meal while rotating and overlooking Vegas, but also to see amusement rides spin out over the windows above you, see people jumping off the top of this tower and falling in front of you as you dine, etc.",

I requested a window seat  but  so disappointed that after that long minutes  of wait to pass and  get up to the restaurant,  we were seated in a corner in a little table . I understand there was no guarantee but a little consideration  could have been nice . We can see little portions of the view in between  the 4 guests beside us.  I addressed the issue to the waiter, we were told if we want that seat we have to wait for minutes to an hour... ( isn't that's the reason you make reservations  for ? So you won't have to wait for an hour for a table) Too upset and disappointed, we just cancelled it and went back to Bellagio where we are staying  and went to  LAGO (  an Italian restaurant)who took us eventhough it was late (1015 pm) gave us a nice table with view of the fountain. ..  Excellent dinner, a bottle of fine  prosecco, couple of cocktails  and 4 waiters attending to us. They TRULY made us feel  ON TOP OF THE WORLD ***just a little advice when making a reservation on this Stratosphere TOTW... especially if you have a special occasion to celebrate, be prepared to be disappointed and and better yet have a plan B*** Anyways  if you just want \" the view\" just have a window seat next time you fly to and from vegas.",

Please make your reservation ahead of time through open tables or with the restaurant directly because they do get busy, especially on the weekends .   This restaurant is located on the 72nd floor at stratosphere hotel overlooking Las Vegas strip. The ambience is lovely and the view is phenomenal. The restaurant have a beautiful revolving view of the strip.   The service was wonderful. I order the filet mignon. The taste was a little bit more than average . I'm giving it a four stars because I felt that the  food was just above average but it wasn't exceptional or left a unique impression .   Other than that it was overall a good experience. They also have an open bar right above the restaurant level with the same view .",

The reservation form also asked if we were celebrating a special occasion and we put that we were coming for our 5th anniversary. When we arrived we were greeted and told \"Happy Anniversary\".  My husband asked the hostess about a table by the window and she assured us it was all taken care of.   We waited a few minutes in the lobby then were taken to our table by the windows. We decided to do the pre fixed menu with the wine pairing. Our first course came out quickly. We were left to enjoy our food and wine. The waiters were very attentive yet did not rush us. They waited until we were done with each course to come and take our plates then bring the next. The food was amazing and the wine pairings were spot on. Bring a big appetite because it's a good amount of food!  Our dessert even came with a little Happy Anniversary sign.   We almost didn't come here because of not so great reviews, but I'm so glad we did. We had a wonderful time. Our waiter even offered to take our picture and it came out so much nicer than the one the professional photographer took.   We capped the the night off with old fashioneds at the 107 sky lounge after.",

Because there really wasn't too much to choose from we opted for the tasting menu for $90 per person. This was a lot more than we wanted to spend but all the other entrees were $45 and over already plus cost of sides we decided this was a better deal to at least have selection. The tasting menu came with soup or Caesar salad. We got soup which was a Thai chicken soup (best item we had all night). Next was Branzino or crab cake, we had 1 of each so we could taste each others and hands down the crab cake was better....Branzino was horrible! Next was the filet with green beans and pearl onions 1 decent and cooked well, the beans were fresh and had a crisp crunch. Finally dessert but this was the most disappointing. You know those mini desserts you can get in any cheap buffet....well that's what we got. It was a mini cup or a dark chocolate mouse and a berry whip cream in a white chocolate cup. I wish we could have had a real choice of a decent sized dessert that didn't taste like it was from a buffet....I mean you sure pay for it at $90 a person! The view was nice, and maybe of we decide to go back we'd go later at night for a night view since we went for early dinner at 6.  Overall I would return...but I wish they'd add better seafood selections.",

Because according to the manager we were way too hammer to drink.  She stated you guys need some food first and funny thing was, we just had appetizers at the lounge.  Maybe she just didn't like MC Hammer!  I was talking straight, walking straight but still too drunk for them.  I think it was more like we looked too young for that old crowd. Left without eating and went to Wolfgang Puck's restaurant at Cesar's and got the best service and food ever.

    "text": "So I visited this place tonight... and after everything was done I was only somewhat unimpressed.... first off, I did not have a reservation and was told by locals that because of the high $$$$ as long as its not on the weekend you can do a walk in due to the fact that the restaurant is mainly used by tourist. Upon getting there I had to endure a 20-30 minute wait. Although when we were seated, I saw many empty tables which made me believe that the \"wait time\" was done on purpose to give the illusion that its full. On to the food, the only thing I would highly recommend is their lobster bisque soup, which was delicious! I ordered the pork sirloin ($50) and my girlfriend ordered the steak (10 oz) and lobster tail ($79). To me the food portions were small and did not come with any sides. To me the price doesn't justify the quantity. By the way the mixed drinks were very \"light\" on liquor... but your paying a premium price of about $13-$15 bucks for a mixed drink. Overall my total bill was $214... and while the view is remarkable I probably wont be back again unless its a really important occasion... and even that is something i'd have to give serious thought about doing.",

    "text": "I had a great time at Top of the World in Las  Vegas tonight.  The view is spectacular and my husband is always good company for me.  You truly do get a 360 degree view of the city.  The staff is friendly and helpful.  Not all are as bubbly as they could or maybe should be (first greeter at the desk take note!).  So I gave them 1 star for first impressions (my star rating is cumulative...so you can earn up to 5 stars but you also lose stars as the meal progresses)  The decor is old and needs refreshing but the view is all that matters.  They earn a star for the 360 degree view. (If you tend to be at all queasy with motion sickness this is not the spot for you!)  The food is pricy but what you would expect at a highly rated restaurant (Zagat 23 out of 30 for food; voted LV best restaurant consistently, average 4.5 rating on TripAdvisor, Yelp, UrbanSpoon). Yes, I do my homework before I commit to a dinner that potentially could cost over $200.  The ala carte side dish offerings are adequate, but the chicken (1 option) and seafood choices (4 options) were limited in my opinion. Still they earned a star for having enough variety that we both found something easily.  We started off with soup.  While we waited the waiter brought a basket of warm bread that was very good.  We enjoyed the view and took some pictures, but after quite some time my husband asked whether they had to go out to get the lobster for my soup, it was taking so long.  About that time the waiter realized our soup had not come out and immediately brought it to our tables with appropriate apologies.  Oops lost a star for that one.  OMG the Lobster Bisque is wonderful.  Some of the best I have ever had.  My husband had the SOTD which was a Vegetable Soup (can't remember the ingredients but it was made with pesto and a grain). Very good also. Add another star.  I ordered: Roasted \"Loch Etive\" Scottish Salmon with Thai Jungle Curry Foam* for $42 (description says \"from the deep Scottish water sea inlet named \"Etive,\" high in Omega 3. Kelp noodle salad with Asian vinaigrette, peas and wild blueberries).  The Salmon was grilled perfectly, flakey, moist and seasoned just enough.  I couldn't really discern the spices in the Thai Jungle Curry Foam, but the kelp noodle salad and dressing was tasty.  BUT the ENGLISH PEAS were RAW.  Yes, RAW.  Read that hard, dry and not cooked at all.I tried to mash one with my fork and could not.  I commented to my waiter and he brought a plate to ask me to send a couple to the kitchen for the Chef.  He also tried to squeeze one and it did not give.  A young man from the kitchen came out and apologized and said he would check with the Chef about the intent of the peas. I hoped that he did not INTEND for them to be raw.  When the young man returned he informed me that the Chef prepared the peas this way to give them crunch.  I don't like mushy peas and I do like them crispy and I know my peas and these were not \"crispy\" they were hard and inedible.  I don't know why but that's the truth.   My husband had the \"California Mary's Farm Free Range Chicken Breast with Lemon Herb\" for $44 (included Gnocchi with arugula pesto, English peas, roasted tomato and chicken jus) and the chicken was just DELICIOUS, but guess what! The peas in his dish were also RAW. Minus a star for the peas, but you get it back for the rest of the meal so its a wash.  The manager took off the cost of our Haricot Verts with Roasted Tomatoes (also very good) and so they won a star back .  Overall my rating is 4 stars.  I will go back but won't make it a \"must\" on my next visit.",

But if you're looking for a special occasion place where you can take the whole family, I wouldn't hesitate to suggest Top of the World.  The waiters we've had never spoke down to the kids, treating them w/great respect.  Case in point:  our 6 y/o spilled his virgin strawberry daquiri (very accommodating w/the virgin drinks, btw), and the staff couldn't have been more understanding and helpful about it.  They even replaced his drink for no extra charge.  I've been in much lower-priced restaurants that haven't done something like that.  If you can get everyone's attention off the tremendous view (try to time your dinner to encompass sunset), and you have kids in your party, be sure and order the chocolate souffle at the beginning of your meal.  And start off the meal w/one of the aforementioned virgin drinks - the strawberry daquiri was like a fantastic strawberry smoothie and the whipped cream on top really made the kids feel special.  And for the adults?  The food has been fantastic each time we've visited.  And if you want the experience but don't want to spend big money on dinner, having a drink in the attached lounge is an incredible way to savor the view that's unlike any other in Las Vegas!",

My wife and I had a dinner reservation for sunset and are still talking about how wonderful the experience was.  The staff were extraordinarily professional and attentive.  The food was awesome - including the desserts.  I highly recommend this restaurant for a classy romantic and memorable dinner.",

    "text": "Took a special lady at the time here for her birthday awhile back. This is one of those restaurants worth at least experiencing at least once in your visits to Las Vegas.   The view up here was pretty cool with a different perspective. 800 feet high with a 360 degree view of Las Vegas and the surrounding desert and mountains from a revolving tower restaurant. We had dinner reservations in the evening so we were able to see Las Vegas during the day and then watch the night come to life with the crazy lights the city is known for.  I thought the food was okay. Not too small, but not hearty either. I'm an I-can-eat-anything-and-everything type of guy (except for fruits and vegetables) and prefer buffets when I'm in Vegas, but since this was a special occasion I wanted to take my date out to someplace different and nice. In all I spent around $160 for dinner and then another $40 for 2 drinks in the upstairs level lounge area; debit card ouch!..but it was worth it at the time. Like everyone here comments, you're really paying for the view and experience to be on Top Of The World.  I would give this place 5 stars if they maybe offered a buffet option without breaking the bank. Yup, I wants me my Las Vegas buffets! LoL",

    "text": "I've lived in Las Vegas for five years and this was my first time in the Stratosphere and at the Top of the World Restaurant!  I made reservations for 5pm, knowing that the sun will set around 5:20pm.  I had heard going up there when the sun is setting is the perfect time.  We were sat in a both.  My husband and I looked at each other and we really wanted a table right at the glass.  Luckily, we saw a table of two moving to a both and we were able to move to their table.  At first, you feel a little iffy, because you are actually moving.  And you think \"hopefully this feeling goes away\" and it does!  FYI: It is a $40/pp minimum. (which is not hard to do!)  We started off with drinks.  I ordered a glass of Riesling (delicious!) and the husband ordered a whiskey sour.   Our waitress was great and once we placed our order she said that it will be about 35 minutes.  Normally, that would suck, but since it takes 120 minutes for you to rotate the entire city, that was perfect.  The husband and I just chilled and enjoyed our drinks and the view.  It was VERY relaxing up there.  I loved it!  Going up at sunset was PERFECT!  You get to see everything with the normal light and see the sun setting and the entire city's lights coming on was gorgeous!  So glad we got the best of both worlds at that time!  They brought out bread that was really good.  A sourdough and a bread that had like cheese & bacon baked into it!  Two butters- a chili butter and a sea salt butter.  Yum!  The food: I had ordered two apps as my main course: - Grilled Portobello Mushroom & Buffalo Mozzarella w/ Roasted Red Pepper, herb oil & balsamic reduction. This was delicious!  Just a fancy version of a Caprese- minus the basil, + adding portobello mushroom. - Seared Jumbo Lump Crab Cake W/ Green papaya salad, pink grapefruit, lemon grass beurre blanc. This was good.  Not the best crab cake ever, but good.  The husband ordered:  - 16oz. USDA Prime Rib-Eye with Horseradish Crust and Demi-Glace - Twice Baked Potato He said that the steak was good.  To me, it looked like it was cooked a little more than medium, but had decent flavor.  He also said that the twice baked potato was \"money!\"  They had a live jazzy-type band playing that was nice.    We just really enjoyed how calm it was up there.  We got to see some people jumping off the side of the Stratosphere, which was fun!  You usually pay just go up in the Stratosphere (like $30 pp or something) and if you eat there, you can go up even higher for free and check it out.  It was super windy at the top, but pretty cool.  You can check out the rides (no thanks!) and just see the interesting people that are there.  You think when you go to a place like this, that you are paying for the view and the food is going to be gross.  The food was decent and you get an awesome view.  However, I would definitely go back for more drinks and less food!",

    "text": "I made a reservation for a Wednesday here to celebrate my wife and I first anniversary. Going through those not so obvious passageways and blistering fast elevators to get to the restaurant felt very special indeed. I'm gonna repeat what mostly everyone's been saying and that is the view is spectacular. A great view of Las Vegas rotating at about an hour for one full rotation (per my wife's observation). The food was great. We got the Prie Fixed Menu ($90 per person for 4 courses) bc everything else seemed to be around 30-50 bucks a plate. For our first course my wife and I got a salad and the lobster bisque. The salad was salad but the lobster bisque was delicious . That was probably the best soup I've tasted here in Vegas. It was creamy yet light and I like that they put some lobster meat in the middle of the bowl. Our second course was a single sauteed scallop with a corn and butter sauce. The scallop was perfectly cooked and you can't go wrong with butter and seafood. Our main courses were salmon with prawns and a filet mignon with haricovert (pronounced ha-ri-co-vare), roasted cipollini onion, and some kind of red wine/butter sauce. Again, everything tasted great and my wife ate everything. Our dessert was some kind of chocolate pudding with a small floral bowl made of white chocolate that carried some fruit and whipped cream. I would say the only misses about this place is that for dinner time it is pretty dark inside so looking at the menu can be a little hard and the dessert wasn't that special. Everything else though was superb and I would recommended this place for any anniversary or special occasion. My wife told me she would come back here for lunch and I agreed as prices are little bit lower. Overall, I think this restaurant is \"close to the top\" on my top resto list bc of the ambience and the attentive service.",

Dress to impress, as there is a bar one floor beneath that plays music in the evening. Can't hear it while you eat, it's actually a very quiet place. Amazing time and worth the money imo. Been there a few times and plan on going back a few more. Did I mention the food is amazing?",

The food was pretty darn good. I had the free range chicken (minus the three cheese fondue) and my boyfriend had the large mexican prawns and new england scallops. Since I'm lactose intolerant, I had to send the chicken back when it came out with the cheese still inside. But the waiter was extremely apologetic and made sure that I got what I ordered. I loved the chicken - it was so moist and well seasoned. My boyfriend said that for the quality of the restaurant the seafood was a bit chewy and disappointing. (So minus a star for that.)  Also, I know that this isn't any fault of the restaurant, but the Stratosphere itself (which the restaurant sits on top of) is Ghetto with a capital \"G.\"  The service by Anthony was great! He was extremely knowledgeable about the Strip and we had a lengthy conversation on what happened to the Sahara hotel, who owns certain hotels & buildings, etc.  Overall, a wonderful experience for a romantic anniversary dinner and we'll definitely return.",

    "text": "To go up to the observation deck at the Stratosphere is $16 each so we decided to go up and have lunch instead. My husband had the salmon caeser salad and a bowl of lobster bisque and I had the 3 course lunch tasting and our bill came in $50-ish. Seeing as we would have spent $32 just for the view I felt this was a good value and we spent over an hour there. We were wearing jeans and I didn't feel under dressed for lunch there at all.   The food was great and the restaurant was not too busy at all so we had a great time. If you are a fan of lobster bisque you HAVE to try their version of it--it's amazing! We all had it and loved it. It was the best thing I ate in Vegas period. I chose salmon as my entree and there was a trio of desserts. One of them was the banana bread pudding and I would say it also makes the list of one of the other best things I ate.   My mom did the $37 trio and had steak and lobster tail as her entree. It was a pretty small amount of lobster but it was lunch and she said the steak was really good. She also ordered a sangria and I had a sip it was pretty tasty but not worth $13 in my opinion.   Bottom line: go for a nice lunch and you won't be sorry!",

    "text": "My sister with her family came to visit me first time for 3 years! They had to fly 13 hours over continents and ocean, and then we were driving 5 hours to Las Vegas to celebrate  my nephew`s birthday. I booked in advance a table in this restaurant via Open Table, hoping that it will be an unforgettable experience for me, my family and my birthday boy nephew. It was unforgettable. But definitely in the negative meaning.   In addition to the Open table booking request, yesterday,  June 12, I specifically called the restaurant in the afternoon  to confirm this booking and the greatest desire of my nephew to seat near with the window.  My biggest mistake was that I did not remember the receptionist's name and I did not record this conversation.... Very friendly receptionist confirmed our reservations for this evening, and assured me that we are going to seat by the window as it had to be the birthday party.   When we arrived at the restaurant, we were provided the table in the second row from the window with no city view. We were given any comments. We had to ask twice and it takes 15 minutes to call the manager to our table.   In the brazen manner we have been given very unprofessional response - I do not know with whom you spoke, we have no tables for you by the window. Moreover to my question: \"If you are not responsible for the confirmations, which is given by your restaurant representatives by the phone, did I had to make a record to have opportunity to prove that my request was confirmed?\" The manager said - yes, you have to!!  Furthermore the manager make it clear that he does not care at all of the negative feedbacks.... WTF? Seriously?! It was the most  unprofessional behavior that we`ve ever met!   How others said, the food at this restaurant is not worth the money that they ask for. And all you are paying for is the city view.  When we went around the restaurant, we found out a number of available tables for party of 5 from which the view was really good, exactly what we were expected and CONFIRMED to get at this place!  We had to wait our order about an hour. During this time, several tables by the window became vacant, but the waiter denied our 4th request to change the table.   Finalizing: not professional, boorish service, very intrusive waiters, not tasty food. If you are going to celebrate here a really important event, be ready to make a record of telephone conversation with the restaurant representative to be able to set-down an unprofessional manager.   Don't have respect for promise, poor standards = no tips, no positive feedback. Honestly.",

    "text": "Felt like I was having dinner on a cruise ship, except the cost of dinner could have paid for an entire cruise!  The experience was fun, but I don't think I will be back. I will start with the positives. The staff was extremely friendly and the experience was unique. If you do decide to go, request a seat on the lower level, preferably at the window because the entire restaurant rotates. However, if you sit at the second level, you don't rotate and will have the same view your entire dining experience. The food was tasty for the most par. I had the lobster bisque which was very good and rich and my husband had the cesar salad which was pretty large and yummy. The bread basket was also good (but they never came by to refill or even offer to refill it). For dinner, I had the filet which was good, although there really wasn't much to it. I added the Foie gras for $20. (see below for my comments on the foie gras). We ordered the fontina cheese potatoes which was the best menu item we had all night. We did not order dessert because the lemon tart cheesecake which I went into dinner wanting to order, was not on the menu that night. The view was also amazing. It takes an hour and 20 minutes to do one complete loop. They time the dining perfectly because we were in and out in the hour and 20. We also came 30 minutes before sunset which was perfect because it was fun to see the valley during the daylight and the lights of the strip once the sun set.  Negatives: I literally felt like I was on a cruise ship. From the cheesy stratosphere olive pick in my martini to the waiter's name pins that had their country of origin to the menus and to the bathrooms- I could have sworn I was on a boat. The problem is for the cost of our dinner, we literally could have booked a four day cruise to Mexico! My other issue was the attentiveness of the service. Everyone was very friendly, but no one ever asked if I wanted another martini until I was halfway done with my entree (my drink was empty since the appetizer portion) nor did they refill our bread basket. Also, my husband and I were there to celebrate our wedding anniversary and indicated as much on our reservation. Now, I am not looking for freebies as I would have ordered the lemon tart cheesecake if it were on the menu, but they did not offer us a celebratory complimentary dessert, which I thought was in bad form. The foie gras was literally the worst I have ever had. There was something wrong with it for sure or it was just prepared terribly. The taste wasn't the only problem. I paid for it as an add-on to my filet for an additional $20. However, the foie gras was also an appetizer on the menu. The appetizer consisted of the foie gras, some sort of jam, and brioche. The cost of the appetizer was also $20! I literally got two bites of foie gras on my steak for the same price.  There are so many better steak houses on the strip. The only reason to choose Top of the World over SW steakhouse, Joes, Capital Grille, etc. is because of the view. However, if you want to experience the view, pay $20 to go up to the observation deck or Sky Lounge for a drink and save your money and go out to a nice dinner on the strip after.",

If not, nah~~~ NOTE: If you have the ace|PLAY red, green and orange memberships, you can get 10% discount for dinner.  Location (4.5): The restaurant locates on the 106th floor of Stratosphere hotel. This is the second tallest tower in the west! This tower unfortunately is not near the Vegas strip. You can see the whole city in the restaurant since it spins 360 degree.   Service (3): If you have a reservation, you can check in with the host downstairs before getting inside the elevator. If not, you may have to pay for tickets to visit the tower. Before going inside the elevator, they would check your phones, purses and coats to prevent you from carrying harmful things up the tower. Our waitor for the night was nice. He did what he had to do, but I wish he could be more lively! While dinning, there will be a photographer walking around to take photos for you. I appreciated the fact that she was being direct on what we should pose for the photos. That saved a lot of our thinking times! Later, she would come back and bring copies of the photos of you - $20/photo wallet with two small photos of your choices and $45/ picture frame with two large photos of your choices. If you want the digital version, $25 more!   Food (2.5): They have the tasting menu $90/person if you are interested. It also comes with the optional $30 wine pairings. We went with the regular menu. We ordered the pork belly appetizer, their so-called well known lobster bisque, ribeye, a lack of lamp and a side of french fries. No worries if the french fries doesn't appear on the menu. Just ask for it if you want it :) Overall, the food was salty for our taste. If I was to be the chef, I would make the pork belly skin extra crispy to make the whole dish less fatty. I would also make the lobster bisque and the rest of the entrees less salty... OMG it was THAT salty!!!!! I mean throughout dinner, we saw a stand of dessert display and we were so excited! After trying the entrees, our hunger for the beautiful looking desserts vanished...  Satisfaction factor (2.5): As much as trying food thousands feet up high and seeing people doing sky jumping outside the windows, the view itself was the only reason why we stayed... As for the food, no more thank you very much! If I was to come back, I would rather to go the 107th floor for coffee or tea while enjoying the beautiful view!  So think twice before you dine here. With the price that they charge, you will find much more quality food down the middle of the strip!",

    "text": "Let's start with their view, it's awesome. You get the 360 from pretty much top of the strip! It's a nice view especially if you've never seen it. But one time is good enough for me. Depending on how sensitive you are to motion sickness, you're going to get motion sickness....yup I did! So there's a fair warning to that lol  The service was top notch and no one at our table had an empty glass for too long. They were definitely on top of their game on that!   The fresh bread and butter they had was pretty delicious. They serve it with three different butters, whipped butter, pesto, and a fruity one I believe. All of which were delicious!   For my entree I had asked for a rare filet mignon which was slightly overcooked but still delicious. The entrees don't come with any sides so you have to add anything you want. The sides are portioned to serve maybe two people at most but we're all fatties so really one person.   My friend ordered the bone-in filet but black and blue and it came out overcooked. Sadly, for a restaurant of this caliber, they should be capable of cooking a rare black and blue steak.   Everything else was good and they even gave us an extra birthday dessert for free because one of the kids wanted that specific dessert.   Overall it was a good time, our party had fun and the service was good. Just for that, I'm willing to come back again.",

    "text": "After clowning around in Circus, Circus for a While I decided to walk to the Stratosphere from there to work up an appetite. When I first Entered the Stratosphere, taking a couple turns and going through Security (They do the Same there like they do at the Airport) and taking the elevator to the top floor, I made it.   My reaction when I first walked in was (OMFG) this place is amazing, 3 Decks of Tables and I was immediately sat down by the Window, such a spectacular view of the Las Vegas Strip, the Outskirts of the Strip, The Mountains (I wasn't sure if I saw Old Vegas or not). The Restaurant also rotates at 360 Degrees and you can see all of Las Vegas within 80 Minutes, also you'll notice that divers from the Sky Jump pass us on their way down (so remember to wave).   I started off with some bread and 3 different compound Butters to spread on (1. Lime, 2. Orange and 3. Garlic, They were all so good a nice little something to start off with). For my Appetizer I got the Roasted Kurobuta Pork Belly topped with Chimichurri and an Orange Gastrique over an Arborio Rice Cake with Cilantro, Aji Amirillo (Peruvian Yellow Chile Pepper) and Lime Powder (I loved it Juicy, Succulent, Cubes of Pork with those Crispy Rice Cakes on the Bottom, Perfect Contrast).   For my Entree I got the Seared Branzino topped with a Citrus Brown Butter Emulsion over a Mushroom Fricasee with Huitlacoche (Mexican Corn Truffle), Corn and Asparagus and finished with a Hibiscus Gastrique (Fish was perfectly cooked, flaky, good color on the Skin, Acidity from the Butter Sauce, Earthiness from the Fricassee and the Huitlacoche and a little of Tartness from the Gastrique).  The only negative thing about that dish was the Asparagus (it looked like it was steamed or Blanched, they were very bland and they had no part of being on that Plate, they were just leaning against the fish, it was unnecessary in my opinion. they should've just left it off the plate).   For my Dessert I got the Chocolate Duo: on the left was a Mini Chocolate Pot de Creme (French for Pot of Custard) and on the right were Fresh Mixed Berries in a White Chocolate Cup with a Vanilla Mousseline Cream (Such a nice ending to Lunch, The Pot de Creme with its smooth, creamy decadence and the White Chocolate Cup acting like a vessel to hold these fresh and tart berries). Lunch came out to almost $75 (Most Expensive lunch I've ever had) but I enjoyed it. Everything was marvelous The Food, the service, the people and especially The View (I loved having Lunch with a View). Such an awesome place for Dinner or a Date or to bring some friends (I'll be sure of that next time). After lunch I was all set to ride The X-Scream and The Big Shot, but I'll be sure to return again pretty soon",

    "text": "I'll try not to repeat everyone else's comments, and add a couple of things that stood out:  - Out of our party of 10, the steak of one surf and turf was overdone. When brought to the attention of the server, the steak was replaced with one done just right very quickly, without anything but attention to rectifying the situation. A second lobster tail accompanied as well, which was very nice of them.  - You get admission to the viewing deck included with your meal (normally about $20, plus sometimes a wait in line). The view from there and from the restaurant is amazing, of course. Helicopters making close passes and diving bungee cord danglers provide entertainment.  - The lamb is a delicious alternative to a steak, especially for those who enjoy a bit of spice.  - This is not specific to this place, but if you've never had the dessert wine known as Pedro Ximenez, then this is as good a place as any for an introduction. A crowd-pleaser, to say the least.  This turned out to be an ideal location for a classy bachelor party dinner. Well done, ladies and gents.",

Even though they prefer you go to Lounge 107 for dessert, appetizers and drinks, we asked if an exception could be made on a Saturday night?  After a quick check  in with the manager, we were told to come in. We were seated right away, and had an awesome server. Even after we told him we were only there for dessert. We felt completely taken care of start to finish! For dessert we had Banana Foster. A delicious cookie box filled with vanilla ice cream and caramelized bananas that they pour at the table. YUM! The individual lemon cheese cake is also amazing, easily enough to split as it is a small 4\" cheesecake. The youngster, not a fan of trying anything to adventurous, had 2 scoops of vanilla ice cream and chocolate sauce. Simple enough, and he seemed happy.  After our awesome desserts, we headed up to the observatory for a few minutes to take in the lights of Las Vegas. Overall an amazing finish to a great night playing tourist with my visiting family!",

You get panoramic views of Las Vegas, and at night the lights make it even more gorgeous. If you get motion sickness like me, you had better come prepared. The restaurant rotates and even though they say you hardly notice, I'll have to say that you really do notice.   I came here with a group of six. My sister joined us, even though she's on an extremely strict diet and would only be ordering a plain salad. That's when it all went downhill. Our server treated us like we were poor folk venturing out to a fancy city meal. We hardly saw her. She didn't explain the menu, and I was so sad because all the servers around us were being so friendly.  She, was not friendly. And honestly, if I'm paying they much money for food, I expect a certain level of service. The bill for 6 people was just under $400. We however left unhappy.  The food wasn't spectacular, and I think it was really overpriced for that it was.  I got the ribeye, and it didn't have any flavor. My boyfriend got the salmon, and it was decent. I won't be going back here, I was so upset. If you want the view, they have a lounge. Check that out instead.",

It took forever for the food to be served. My soup was cold, the steak was over cooked, and the lobster was raw. By the time we were served our food and paid for our beverages, we had 10 minutes to celebrate in the lounge. This meal definitely was not worth the cost.",

    "text": "I do not like leaving negative reviews, but if the plate fits...sometimes you have to do it.  I was so looking forward to having dinner here because as often we are in Vegas we just never seem to have time.  So it was with great excitement that we booked our reservation for dinner at Top of The World.  First I want to say that the view IS amazing and a great way to see Vegas.  The atmosphere was extremely romantic which is exactly what we were looking for.  We were seated right away but here is where it went wrong.  I am not sure if our server was down an assistant but he was slow to get to us the whole evening.  While he was friendly, he seemed to rushed to really serve us and at the price, we expect excellent service.  We waited about 10 minutes before our server greeted us...and another 10 minutes before he came back for our drink order.  We were okay with that because hey you are there for the ambience so we sat back and relaxed taking in the view.  I just cannot eat a lot so hubby and I split a Caprese Salad with Heirloom tomatoes.  I have to say it was delicious and the only good part of my meal.  I ordered the Organic Half Chicken and hubby had the duck and we shared a potato dish.  My chicken was horrible.  I took two bites into it and could not eat anymore, it was over-cooked and dry.  My hubby's duck was overcooked as well but he was able to eat his.  While he did not think it was horrible he rated it about a 5 out of 10....but back to my chicken.  I kept waiting for our server to return so I could tell him about the chicken but by the time he checked back my husband was finished with his meal.  Here is what really peeved me.  Our server finally came back to check on us and when I told him about the chicken he looked at me in disbelief.  All you had to do was look at my barely touched plate and you could see it was extremely overcooked (I am not sure how it wasn't caught in the plating process).  He kept saying \"really?\"  YES REALLY! He then asks me if I want them to bring something else and I said no my husband was finished with his meal so I did not want to wait for another meal and eat alone.  He then tells me he has to check with his manager.  He then comes back and says they are going to comp our drinks BUT not the chicken!! The chicken I couldn't even eat!  So let's do the math....my husband had a drink 13.00 I had a drink 13.00 so they comped us 26.00 instead of the 37.00 (price of the chicken) that I couldn't eat! Look I realize it's only a 10.00 difference BUT I could drink my drink I couldn't eat the chicken.  We eat at a lot of nice restaurants and have no problem spending the money for great food but this was over the top bad service.  I didn't expect them to comp the meal BUT  I did expect them to not charge me for a meal that was so bad I couldn't eat it.  So sad it was not a good experience because I would have loved to put it on our must do's in Vegas  but bad food, bad service at this price makes it a no go.",

This place is located within the Stratosphere, and reservations are strongly recommended. Getting to this revolving restaurant involves taking the elevator to the top, and checking in at the desk. Once your table is ready, you will be taken to the revolving restaurant and you will be amazed by the great views. The restaurant rotates at a slow rate, so you will get a change to enjoy the 360 degree view of Las Vegas. The view is especially great at night. The food itself is phenomenal. It is well worth the price, as it is made with the right balance of ingredients. Thus far, I've had the filet mignon and the salmon. To drink, I opt for the pinot noir. I have a glass to take in the view, and another one to accompany my meal.  The service is efficient, and the meal comes with many trimmings. I have not yet tried their desserts, but I will update when I do. Chances are, I will come back here on my next Vegas trip, so stay tuned.",

You won't be able to pass on dessert, as the rotating floor brings you by the dessert stand a few times, so go for the lemon bar cheesecake.   There were also people bungee jumping off of the top of the Stratosphere, and would swing by our window from time to time. Ha! This place is the quintessential Las Vegas experience. I won't be able to come back to town without going to The Top of the World!!",

    "text": "Top of the World is for sure a tourist destination - but one of the better ones I experienced.   Just so everyone knows - yes the restaurant spins! We went at 8:30 PM and it was dark outside - I feel this would be the best time to sit high above the strip and take in all the lights of the city that never sleeps.   To begin, you have to go through quite a bit of pre-screening before arriving to the restaurant. (After walking through the casino and up an escalator to get to the elevators to go up) so keep that in mind when you're giving yourself time to get to the restaurant.   To begin - YOU MUST if you like chocolate martini's get one. It was delicious. My coworker and I both got a few. Secondly - the bread is \"hard\" per their direction so don't bite into it expecting fluffy flakes. (This was odd but the butters were delicious so I went with it).  We did the al la carte menu, but there is a chef's tasting menu option as well. I had the 9 oz fiet that was cooked to perfection and we shared the green beans and potato puree sides. And the sides were heavenly. Also we got salads to start - they were much larger than anticipated. Two could easily share one as an appetizer.   Additionally - they have a photographer that goes around and takes photos while you're at dinner. We got suckered into buying one for each of us because we were there for a special occasion (it was my birthday) but normally we wouldn't buy one. The also gave a \"free dessert\" because of my birthday. It was rather small and one person even called it a \"Chocolate fart\"....which was funny. But alas, it was small but mighty of a dessert.   Lastly, since we ate at the restaurant they allowed us free entranced to the observation deck. I'm not sure what the cost of that is but it was nice.   Overall, fun experience. Not something super awesome that I would do again - but still fun",

    "text": "So how I ended up at this restaurant is I wanted to see the view of Vegas from the Stratosphere Hotel (note this is not a good area of town. One wrong turn and you'd be somewhere you don't want to be). Unbeknownst to me there was a $20 fee to go to up to the observation floor. Hmm no and thank you but since it was lunch time I rationalized that it would make sense to eat and see the view at the same time. My waiter's name was Zachary. He was nice and checked on me a lot... in the beginning lol. The restaurant is fancy but low key during lunch. I wanted the cheapest dish on the menu but ordering a sandwich seemed too casual. Then I reminded myself that I was on vacation alone and I deserved to treat myself. So I went for the gusto and ordered the Chef's tasting menu! First course I ordered the lobster bisque. The flavor was decent but another tablespoon of lobster was needed. For my Second course I ordered the seared scallop with cauliflower salad because I love both. This was insteresting not sure in a good way. The scallop was cooked perfectly but the cauliflower was cut uneven. There were big pieces and little pieces so it altered the eating experience. There were also raisins in the salad. The sweet element was different but I could have done without it. For my Third course I ordered filet mignon and shrimp scampi. The steak was bland and over cooked. I asked for medium. It came out medium well. I didn't send it back like I normally would have. The string beans were bland. The shrimp scampi was ok but I wasn't really  interested since the star of the show was ruined. Dessert was pretty but again wasn't enthused by this point. Service between the courses was slow. Not sure why because it wasn't busy. Good thing I had a bottle of wine to occupy me which a time or two I had to pour myself a glass and when the waiter did pour it he'd leave the cap off smh. This visit $180 and 2 hours later. In conclusion the view is AMAZING and and distracted me from the sub par food. This was a been there done that place for me. I wouldn't come back.",

The price fix menu was great with the filet darn good, but again not the absolute best.  All in all it was worth it to go and have this unique experience.

Hawaii was amazing of course, but there were still buildings in the way but since this particular restaurant is higher ...the view was amazing.   we went during lunch time on a Wednesday...which was perfect bc there weren't too many people..so we were seated right next to the window.  this is a rotating restaurant and by the time we finished our lunch , which was a 3 course meal we opted for, we had made a full rotation.    Our waiter was informative, gave us the right suggestions and gave us information about visiting the observation deck after lunch , so we thank him for that.   the food...AMAZING. we have been to 5 star restaurants where the views is amazing..the ambiance is amazing...but the food is blah...not this place...it was amazing.  we had the lobster bisque , the filet (JR) , with a side of potatoes and the dessert was yummy.

And you can never get enough of it!  Yes, they search your bags and make you go through the metal detector. Yes, the dress-code is business casual. But what did u expect? Sweaty T-shirts and shorts with hairy legs all around?! We had to wait some 15 mins before taken to our table, so we spent the time on the outside terrace, enjoying the breath-taking view.  All of our requests were kindly met, the waiters were polite, funny, professional and not at all annoying. It was an extremely comfortable pass-time.  We even had a birthday candle to make a wish on the desert :) As for the food, well, I'm not much of a high-class restaurant goer, but I felt it could be improved. Let me be clear, evthing we ordered was tasty, well-done, nothing wrong. BUT! I can cook that very same New York steak myself... Guess, I expected food to be as impressive as the view outside. However, this was an evening to remember, and I strongly recommend  everyone to share the pleasure. By the way, the cost is quite reasonable.",

The service was very good and we got a visit from the GM who saw our request and came over.  He is also former Navy and wanted to meet my daughter.  Excellent touch.  The food is good, but I will say if you are a foodie type or you really like deep flavor, this is really not the place.  There are more top chefs around on the strip or go to Smith and Wollensky.  Not saying it is bad, but for the price you pay you can do better.  If you are having a special occassion and want it to be memorable, then by all means go to the Top of the World.,",

    "text": "This was my first time here and indeed the view of the city was amazing!  However, that was all I can really say was great about this restaurant.  Even though we had reservation, the hosting at the door was quite unorganized.  We checked in, and was told to stand to the side to wait for our table.  We waited for a while, and finally had to flag down another hostess to take us to our table.  She didn't seem very happy, and didn't even greet us until we arrived at our table.  My boyfriend had the five course tasting menu which came with the soup of the day, crab cake with green papaya salad, roasted miso black cod with ponzu butter sauce, grilled petit filet mignon, and mini desserts trio.  I had the large prawns and scallops with Morrocan couscous, and we ordered half a dozen oysters to share.  The food overall was mediocre for such a nice restaurant, and not flavorful at all.  My favorite out of all those dishes were the oysters, but I've tasted so much better in Vegas.  Our waiter was nice and had our glasses of water refilled constantly.  Other than the ambiance, I wouldn't recommend this place if you wanted something yummy for your palate.  Also, the restaurant slowly revolves so you get to see all angles of the city.  I am sensitive to motion, so it was a little uneasy at first, but after a while, I got use to it.",

Now, it was quiet and friendly and entertaining with the jumpers from the higher floor, very cool to see.. Thought about doing it, but i am a chicken haha  I got the Lobster and Steak Combination dinner  for only $40, which came with Lobster Bisque, roasted Potatoes, seared vegetables AND DESSERT!  Presentation was fabulous, all of the staff were friendly nice and hapy...  LOBSTER... I have had lobster A LOT... and 90% of the time at restaurants its Overcooked and tuff and flavorless.. and 1 time it was so bad i had to ask them to make it again... the Chef told me that was the way its supposed to be cooked... uh huh..  Top of the world restaurant Chef, I Love You... You made the most perfect succulent and sweet lobster i have ever had the pleasure of eating... Lobster wow.. :)  Steak, flavorful perfectly cooked to my liking, if only they had better cuts..   The Lobster Bisque was smoky rustic and authentic tasting, it may have been slightly smoky for me but i still ate every drop.. and sopped it up with my bread  DESSERT... There were three different kinds one with raspberry creme which was delicious a chocolate morsel and something else i cannot remember.. i ate them too fast... lovely presentation  The Chef is amazing, i found out at the end of the meal he is French no wonder!!

    "text": "\"What a big steaming pile of pony loaf.\"  That's the first thought that pops into my mind when I think of Top of the World Restaurant @ Stratosphere.  This is the single worst of the supposed \"mid/high class restaurants\" that I've been to in Vegas.  PURE CLASSLESS PANDERING: The second thing that pops into my mind is, \"What an incredibly classless sham.\"  But if you've ever been to the Stratosphere Tower, you already knew that didn't you?  What, with the endless parade of Disneyland-esque shops that they just happen to force you to wander past just to get to the restaurant's very entrance, it should be obvious after realizing that the restaurant was just another revenue generator around the one-trick-pony that is the Stratosphere, that this was all going to lead to nothing but utter disappointment for the evening.  How do I loathe this place?  Let me start with the view.  WAIT... YOU HATE IT BECAUSE OF THE 108 STORY VIEW? Not exactly.  I have a problem with this restaurant because the view is absolutely the only thing they have going for it.  The view is gorgeous whether you're near the windows or \"above\" in the loge dining area.  The rotating restaurant is a great concept and I'm sure all year long, the patrons flock to Top of the World to \"dine in the sky\", only to discover that they may have a view from heaven, but a they also get a dining experience from hell.  this Restaurant is about as well-tended to as a Denny's - and the Vegas Strip Denny's has much better prices, and piping hot food to boot.    To be 100% clear, if this restaurant wasn't on the bazillionth floor of the Stratasphere, I absolutely believe that it would have gone out of business years ago.  WOW... WHAT'S SO BAD THAT THEY'D GO OUT OF BUSINESS? First of all, I've been there 3 times, (Stratosphere's got some good casino coupons) and 2 out of 3 of these times I was there my main course was served cold. In one case, part of my Kobe medallions course tasted like death barely warmed over, prompting me to send it back.  I even talked to a couple next to me and they mentioned that their food could have been warmer too.  But this isn't that surprising because the service is so atrociously slow.  I used to think that the problem lay entirely with the wait staff not delivering the food in a timely fashion when my order is up but since my lukewarm Kobe, I've come to the conclusion that everyone there from the host to the chefs to the waiters just... don't... really care.  It frankly goes beyond service though:  I had Filet Mignon here, and it had a wine & mushroom sauce on it.  Filet's usually not the most flavorful cut but I certainly expected the softest steak they had available, and instead I got something like a tasteless cube of what I suppose was beef but considering the difficulty I had with it and a steak knife, I can't really be certain.  And then suddenly, I understood why they put a mushroom wine sauce on it:  To cover up the fact that it was a weak tasteless steak to begin with.    SAUCES, HUH?  OVERUSED MAYBE? Well, as I went from dish to dish (asparagus, lobster ravioli, etc.) I realized that that was what the common thread was:  It felt like it was a warmed over cafeteria meal served 108 floors up.  None of the dishes would ever stand on their own so every course was constantly covered up in some sort of thick sauce or glaze.  Hollandaise sauce, Wine sauce, Apricot sauce, Ginger sauce... over and over again with the sauces.  Additionally, I think the cheesy & cheap nature of the Stratosphere lends itself to getting a rather crass group of customers.  I saw people in the restaurant with very questionable attire and I was trying to figure out if I was the one being and old codger or were these kids wearing just completely inappropriate clothes.  Tennis shoes & jeans appear to be the norm with lots of douchebag-ish Ed Hardy garb.  One girl looked like she was wearing lingerie and just grabbing a bite to eat on her way to Poly Esthers... or maybe the Rhino.  One never can tell with this bunch.  On a humorous note, I once saw one of those cheesy photographers going around taking couple's pictures as this \"momentous occasion\" of eating at Top of the World, the later showing them the photo and charging them something like $20 on their restaurant bill for the photo.  The price springs to mind because a couple I sat next to was muttering something about the price they paid while they were perusing the check.  CONCLUSION: I'll say that this establishment barely escaped from having  the \"1-Star of Doom\"(TM) stamped on their forehead and  I will pull no punches when an organization deserves serious criticism: - The horrendous service - The unforgivably cold food - The poor quality of the steak - The crass environment ...and +1 star for being in the damned Stratosphere and having a view.  2-Stars.  Terrible, borderline awful.",

The portion was bigger than I thought (2 thumbs up especially for the fine dining price.) I ordered the quail (WOW) and my bf ordered the filet mignon (another WOW). Both dishes were AWESOME!! As for dessert, we ordered the trio where u get to choose any 3 from their dessert menu. I think we ordered chocolate lava cake, banana bread pudding, and creme brulee. OMG the creme brulee was my FAVORITE of all 3 and my bf said that the bread pudding was the best he's ever tasted (and he's tasted ALOT.)  Service: what more can I say. 5 star service.",

    "text": "A spinning restaurant sounds a bit like a disaster of nausea waiting to happen, but it's really not like that.   This restaurant looks out over all of Las Vegas and, yes it spins, but so slowly you don't really notice it. Well, not until you get up to go to the bathroom and lose your table for a few seconds.   Overall, it's a bit overpriced for the quality of the food, but our waiter was fantastic, we were in a great mood, the view was fantastic, and my friends and I looked fantastic (it's all about me, me, me).   I ordered the Filet Mignon and it was cooked to my specifications, the wine that accompanied it was a good choice, and the sides did the job. I wouldn't say this is anywhere close to the best steak I've ever had, but it was pretty darn good. Plus, the joy of looking out over the bright Vegas lights gives it an extra star.   I would suggest checking it out if you're a Vegas regular and haven't had the chance yet.",

    "text": "Okay, I was in Vegas a couple of weeks ago for the biggest gathering of nerds, techies, rocket scientists and geeks on the planet.  And yes, I admit, I'm one of them, and yes, we are HOT.  Anyways, it was time to make a decision for dinner. The choice was to either have dinner with my fellow co-workers from out-of-town at this place or eat by myself at another hotel buffet (ugh, not another...).  So, simple enough, join the group.  The view is indeed spectacular and the service, attentive.    But, and a BIG BUT, the menu was predictable and boring consisting of your typical red-meat Black Angus Schmangus shit, salmon, and sea bass (woohoo) and pairing it with sides like garlic mashed potatoes (good gawd),  asparagus (yippee), plus salads (Caesar's, told you they're predictable), and soup (lobster bisque, oh come on), desserts (creme brulee....lord almighty)  I got the lamb chops which was, ehh, okay but cooked a bit too rare.  It's a revolving restaurant, so please, do yourself a favor and mind how much you drink  because I don't want to pick you 1,000 feet down, your pea brain splattered all over the sidewalk, nor smell your fucking puke in the elevator 104 floors up!  And don't get lost going around in circles trying to find the restroom. It's always been on the same spot, it's the table where you're seated that's moving, dumbass.  Good thing it's on company expense because I'm not going to spend this much money on this place.   Minus 1 more star for the looong ass way getting to this restaurant. And stop frisking me already, I'm not going to bomb Stratosphere, you TSA wannabe!",

    "text": "Undoubtably, the view at Top of the World is breathtakingly gorgeous. Five stars if all we are yelping on is views alone.  But I can't eat a view, so Top of the World ranks considerably more south of the equator in my book.  Food: Entrees are priced from $45 - $65. Sides are a la carte, which means if you want more than just a slab of meat on your plate, you will probably dish out another $20. I find this kind of pricing a little deceitful and offensive. Even so, it would have been fine with me if the food was good. Unfortunately......  (prices are approximate. I don't have that kind of memory.) Chilean Sea Bass: $45 - boring and bland. Not so much moist as it was soggy. No distinct flavor at all. It was encrusted with porcini mushroom dust but it could have been pixie dust for all I could discern. It was also served on wilted romaine lettuce, which I think romaine lettuce should never be served as. Better choices would have been wilted baby spinach, kale, or even beet greens. I'm a big huge fan of sea bass and found this dish quite disappointing.  Asparagus: $10 - Christ. These were the soggiest, blandest asparagus I've ever had. Were they boiled in unfiltered tap water for an hour?! Cooked for just a second longer and you could have scooped these up in a jar and stuck a Gerber label on it. Asparagus tastes amazing broiled or grilled, with maybe a slight glaze of olive oil and a pinch of sea salt -- none of which will compete with the natural flavor and sweetness of this green-stalked pee-smell-changer. To have such a simply delicious vegetable stripped of any nutrients or flavor is downright  veggie blasphemy. I was tempted to throw a stalk at the revolving window just to see what the staff would do.   Lobster Mashed Potatoes: $14 ooooooh, how I wanted to love this dish! Two of my favorite foods mating in one big bowl, what could possibly go wrong? Alas, the potatoes were so dry, I could have used them to plaster that crack in my bedroom ceiling. There was some kind of bbq-flavored \"gravy\" and little chunks of lobster...it wasn't horrible, but I wasn't impressed.   Garlic Mashed Potatoes: $10 Technically my bf's dish, but of course I noshed too. Dry. Uninspired. And I couldn't discern any real garlic. Roast those suckers and blend them in, folks.   Ribeye: $50 bf's meal since I don't eat cow. He actually liked his meal; it was cooked perfectly and had great texture. However, he said he had better. On many occasions.  Overall, my impression is that Top of the World caters to a very base culinary crowd. Those whom are so distracted and awestruck by the view that they actually think the mediocre food they are shoveling into their mouth tastes good.   We ended up spending almost $200 for a dinner for two (I'm including the $40+ it cost us to get from MGM to Stratosphere and back, because I'm a bit bitter about it. I would have been so much happier eating at any of the restaurants within our own hotel). We didn't even order any wine, alchohol, or dessert.  After dinner, we took the elevator up to the Observatory Deck (outdoor), which was **incredible**!  You can see all of Vegas, including the main strip. I tried to convince my pusssy bf to ride the roller-coaster with me, but he wasn't having it.   Bottom Line: eat at a REAL restaurant, then go up to the Observatory Deck for the astounding view, without the huge markup on sub-par, \"Black Angus\" type food.",

    "text": "My review is for the LOUNGE part of the restaurant.   My boyfriend and I were staying at the Stratosphere and looking for somewhere to hang out and have a drink. He mentioned the lounge at the top of the tower and I reluctantly agreed. I'm scared of heights but I was curious to check it out. It's normally $6 for hotel guests to gain access to the top of the tower, but since we were going to the lounge, it was free and we were able to go through a private entrance with a separate elevator. It was pretty cool.. it felt a little VIP even though it wasn't ;) You do have to go through a small security check before you can ride to the top.  Once we got to the top (the trip up took about 2 minutes), we exited the elevator and saw the view. Immediate vertigo.. it's such a weird feeling. The lounge is very dark and lit by little blue lights.. it's nice and intimate. You can sit wherever you want for the most part. They have a nice selection of martinis. Drinks are reasonable.. we expected them to be pricey but my martini was $10. It's a one drink per person minimum which isn't bad at all.   The view is breathtaking. I think it would be so cool to watch the sun set up there. The kind of scary thing is that the place shakes a bit every few minutes. You get used to it while seated, but I walked around and freaked out a bit when it shook. We stayed for almost two hours. It would be really fun with a small group.  I think it would be nice to eat in the restaurant, but I had a look at the menu and none of the offerings suit my tastes. Duck and whatnot, and pretty pricey. I like that the restaurant slowly rotates.. unfortunately the lounge doesn't.",

I define ghetto by the old, moldy smell of the carpets, slot machines that looked like it was from the 80's and the classless crowd.  I define classy as something like the Wynn. The restaurant itself anything but modern  and the dishes were average at most but had a above average price tag.  I did get a little annoyed too when the picture taking lady were pressuring us to buy the portrait she took of us. She didn't even take the time to wait till we were all ready. she jus snapped away and I swore my eyes were looking elsewhere in the photo. when we rejected her ridiculous offer of 20 dollars per portrait she gave us the biggest attitude and walked away.

Don't mind the walk through the low stakes gambling tables and Midwestern flip flops because this restaurant is definitely a special place for a special occasion.

And all of this while eating the best filets ever (literally melts in your mouth). The servers were very attentive and the staff was professional and pleasant. But make sure you bring your Platinum AMEX because between a few drinks, two filets and a couple of side dishes, the bar and table bill came in at $350 with tip.

    "text": "BF: so they were thinking of going to Stratosphere for dinner tomorrow, the revolving one. Me: oh OK. Me thinking:  that's kinda corny isn't it?  But oh well, we're going with people visiting from NJ, and I've never been there myself.  1st, the valet is in the back of the building as opposed the front. Then, you have to go the long way to get to the bottom of the tower since there's no short cut, for some odd reason.  When you get to the bottom of the tower, you have to \"check-in\" for the restaurant.  Then they asked you to wait in some kind of green room, until you're escorted to the  ..  metal detector?  I didn't realize I'm having dinner at the airport.  After the brief puzzle, we waited for the elevator.    So we're in front of the elevator, waiting, and noticed the button wasn't lit. What would *you* normally do? Exactly!  As soon as we started walking forward to reach for the button, we were notified rather startlingly  that we're not allowed to press the button.  Should have told us sooner, no? or put a sign by the button \"not\" to touch it.  We finally got up to the 107th floor, were told to go to the door on the left and had to check-in again before someone finally escorted to our table. I've never experienced such lengthy process just to have dinner.  Our waiter did make a good suggestion, so I liked him.  I normally make it a point to ask what the more popular dishes are at the restaurant (or what's the chef's favorite is), and most of the time it has not disappoint me.   Between the 4 of us, we had 1/2lb king crab legs for appetizer which was good.  As for entree: fillet mignon -- which I heard was pretty good; sea bass which in my opinion didn't look too appetizing; my bf had pork chop which was over cooked; and I had veal which I thought was very good.  Mine was probably the best out of the 4, w/o trying the fillet and the sea bass.  Although the view was awesome, and  I enjoyed my meal, this isn't a place where I'd go back to unless I'm showing people around LV.  And when I do, I will either have the recommended Veal or rack of Lamb.  We capped the night at the jazz lounge upstairs with some cocktails. It was an enjoyable evening for our last night in Vegas.   BTW.. can someone explain the Purell anti-bacterial dispenser by the entrance to the restaurant?",

Its in the stratosphere and literally at the top of the hotel. It slowly spins while eating. I definitely say its a must place to dine while visiting Vegas, or those that frequent Vegas quite a bit its worth a stop and deserve a spot in your itinerary.  It does get a bit pricey but thats Vegas for you. Any fine dining your expected to drop a couple hundred. I believe a meal for us 4 with two bottles of wine came out around $400.   I would definitely dine here again. Though don't get too full, u want to save room for all that alcohol and raging at the Vegas night clubs.",

    "text": "Beautiful view of the Las Vegas Strip = overpriced food. I know we are in Vegas but come on if you are spending $$$$ on dinner you expect the kitchen to cook a proper steak. Service was great... the waiter was patient with us asking all these questions about the food and drinks. Our table ordered the Seafood Appetizer which included jumbo shrimp, lobster, ahi poke, ceviche. The lobster and shrimp were yummy but the ahi poke didn't look fresh at all. I ordered the filet mignon and the bf ordered the rib eye we also split the creamed spinach with blue cheese and potatoes gratin. We both got our steaks medium rare but they were sort of overcooked I don't know if it was a bad night but it's no excuse for a steakhouse to serve overcooked steaks to their customers. The creamed spinach and potatoes were yummy of course! Not a place to go back to or recommend. If you really want to see the view of the strip pay the $20 and take the elevator up.",

But they were on point this time.   Had the quack and turf, duck, steak and fois grois (yes i spelled that wrong) damn tasty. The service was great. Friendly staff, always filling your water, asking if you need something, bringing you more bread, or clearing crumbs and plates away. The staff is pretty funny and happy.  yes this place rotates. I didn't realize it till we sat down. And it was night time too. It was terrible. it went really slow. Towards the end of dinner we finally saw the kitchen, and how busy it was. Just try not to stare out the window to keep from throwing up.  I have a fear of heights, but if you don't stare intensely out the window it'll be ok. Food was good, and then afterward you can go upstairs to the observation deck.",

    "text": "First, you should know the food was delicious so this poor review is not for the food.  This review is for the service.  Absolutely horrendous.  I made a reservation a month before maybe even two months before and when my party arrived we had to wait for 1/2 an hour.  Yes a whole 30 minutes to be seated.  When I asked what the problem was I got excuse after excuse.  That is unacceptable.  I want a table not a reason why you do not have one of which is not even valid considering I have a reservation for 20 minutes ago.    After being seated the waiter took forever to take our order.  We did get our drink order in but unfortunately (and maybe this was because no alcohol was ordered.. hey people I know I know.. it's Vegas and all but we had a bottle service waiting for us and well...  two bottles and six girls...  no drinking at dinner...) only the ones who ordered soda were given refills.  The rest of us were never asked if we wanted another drink... another strike against.  The bread... what bread... they don't serve bread.  Actually they do but it came just before our meal which was about 45 minutes into the dinner.  Also, finally....  The waiter was chewing GUM!!!  So gross.. I am sorry but this type of restaurant should not even allow gum on the premises.  yuck.    Needless to say after the meal I spoke with the manager.  of course my little professional side came out and I was very straightforward and as polite as one can be when explaining about how unacceptable the service was for the evening from beginning to end.  He asked what he could do for me.. I responded, \"we have already paid the check, what can you do for me\"?  So, he bought a round of drinks for me and my girls as well as made sure to not only sit us at the best spot in the bar but also escort us up to the bar.  That was very professional and gave him points but all in all this restaurant was a bust.  Food... very good... service... not worth the food...  make of it what you will",

The food is nice but not really worth The price at $100 to about $300 per person. the wine pairings are for the most part near perfect and perhaps the only reason worth braving the wait, (post reservation) and the feeling of being gouged for seemingly overpriced yet very superb cuisine. I would say that if you live in the area and you need somewhere nice to go for an anniversary this might be it, but other than that, the top of the world restaurant doesn't really have much purpose, other than taking in the big time tourist bucks.

There is a metal detector and weapons are prohibited, so if you have a concealed carry permit and you carry in Vegas (you should), you have to leave it in your car as they have no storage lockers available. Luckily the valet hadn't moved my car yet, so I was able to leave my Glock hidden in there. Not the most satisfactory solution, but there were no problems.  Food was excellent, service was great, prices were expensive. I would certainly return for one of those \"special occasion\" dinners.",

Instead of paying to go to the observation deck (which is $17 per person!), we decided to have lunch at the restaurant instead.  What a treat!  They have a decent menu with good lunch options, but they also had a chef's fixed price option (3 courses).  We decided to go with the chef's menu, which was wonderful.  We both had lobster bisque as an appetizer, which was good.  Then the entrees were ricotta gnocci and miso glazed salmon, both of which were delectible.  The gnocci was very tender and the salmon just melted in your mouth.  For dessert, it was a tasting tray of mini desserts, which looked like they came out of a cooking magazine.  One of them actually had a little bit of gold leaf on it!  The drinks were fabulous, we tried the Bloody Mary (nice and peppery/spicy) and the Mango Madness (it was lightand refreshing).  What a great place, I would definitely go back there!",

I am very sorry he either had a rare bad one or he was in a less rare bad mood when he went.   The waiter smiled the whole time, he answered our questions, he was smooth, efficient and considerate, there when he needed to be and out of the way the rest of the time.    My friend had the same meal Kurt had, said it was the best filet mignon around.  Cooked to perfection.    This place is everything you expect from four star dining, and yes, the prices reflect it, so please just go ready to spend $170-200 for two.  This is the dining event you dress up and save up for.   Oh and that's one more thing.  I am really aghast at permanent low-class cheap ass tourists who want to walk into a classy place like this in halter tops and ripped off jeans shorts and sandals and 70s hair they never comb.  You people can go dumpster dive for medium rare squirrel filet.  Stop ruining the atmosphere for the rest of us that have some decency and respect for ourselves and other people.  This place is definitely worth a 3 piece suit or tux for dinner, but business casual is the dress code.",

    "text": "My husband and I dined here with another couple, and had a decent visit. Before I get into the review of the food, it should be known that what really makes this an experience is, of course, the amazing view and ambiance. The Stratosphere offers a second to none view of the entire valley from the slowly rotating platform upon which the restaurant is positioned. This is definitely a place that will impress out-of-towners and locals alike. But why did I give it only 3 stars? Here's why:  The food was underwhelming. The prices weren't outrageous, but the dishes were all unremarkable. We had the pork belly appetizer, which is usually great anywhere (hello, bacon). This one wasn't seared to give it the nice crunchy texture, and left something to be desired. The lobster bisque had a strong curry flavor, which overpowered the lobster completely. Tasty it was, but not what I was expecting or like any seafood bisque I've ever had. I ordered the pork tenderloin wrapped in bacon (warning: huge portion), and it was overcooked. I specifically asked for it to be cooked to a medium, and the waitress initially said the chef wouldn't do it. I asked her to check, but that I would order something else if he really wouldn't, but she came back and said he would. He didn't. I ate maybe half of one pork medallion and decided I wasn't into it enough to keep eating. We finished with the cheese plate, which was good - not spectacular.  The service was very good, and the Sommelier was really helpful in choosing a wine to suit all of us. Again, I really didn't dislike the food...it was just not as delicious as I would've hoped for.  Bottom Line: Come here for the view, experience, and drinks, not for excellent food.",

    "text": "This is a rotating restaurant on top of the Stratosphere.  It's about on the same level as that place on top of the Space Needle in Seattle.  You're coming for the joy of rotating round and round while you look down at the view.  The food is OK but nobody comes for the food, except possibly to eat the Chocolate Stratosphere dessert (a molded chocolate replica of the tower where you're eating) which was kitschy cool.    As others have noted, the Stratosphere is old and looks kinda \"ghetto\" compared to the newer places in Vegas; it's also at the far far end of the strip away from most of the newer and fancier places.  The restaurant itself is nice but the downstairs you have to walk through to get to the restaurant is old and dorky.      Also, the Stratosphere has thrill rides operating on top of it and as the restaurant rotates you will probably see people flying past your window on the sky ride a hundred stories up.   If you are planning to have some drinks you probably want to be aware of this in advance.  I myself was not  aware and when I saw human bodies flying past the window after a couple of glasses of something, I about freaked out.  If the sight of these folks inspires you to go on the rides yourself, you need to go all the way downstairs again and get tickets, which is a hassle.    Overall it's more of a retro-silly Las Vegas dining experience than an elegant or fancy dining experience.   If you want a really nice dinner, pay more and go to a nicer place.  If you just want a fun sit-down restaurant lunch or dinner, the Stratosphere restaurant is fine for that.",

I was disappointed that they no longer serve bread pudding. I had the twin lobster tails and my bf had the surf and turf. He admits that my lobster was \"fresher\" than his crab legs but he still enjoyed everything. Oh, the sangria is AMAZING!   You may even catch a skydiver or two.",

The food was AMAZING. My boyfriend got the Cesar salad to start and it was really good. I got the shrimp cocktail. It was really good as well--the shrimp were huge. For the main course, my boyfriend got the center cut New York strip steak and I got the Wagyu ribeye. The New York strip steak was amazing. It was tender and cooked to perfection. My ribeye was, hands down, the best steak I have ever had in my life. It was buttery, flavorful and tender. We also got some asparagus to share and it was really good. For dessert, we got the baked Alaska. It was really amazing as well. We actually weren't expecting to get dessert, but it was so good that we cleaned the plate. This place is definitely in my top 3 favorite restaurants. I hope to be back soon!",

Like other reviewers have stated, you do have to go through security check prior to taking the elevator up to the restaurant.   After dinner take advantage of going to the observation deck to take more pictures and look at the views!  Reservations: Made ours through open table which was so easy and convenient. When you make your reservation, ask for a table next to the window so you have a good view. We saw jumpers while we were eating! I knew to watch out for this from other Yelp reviews.   Environment:  Dim lighting perfect for a romantic dinner. Somewhat loud upbeat music for a romantic feeling place. It was fine though, I mean it was Vegas. Views were beautiful. Don't look outside for too long, you get kind of dizzy!  Food: I had the tasting menu with wine pairing. I chose: lobster bisque (SO good- watch out if your lactose intolerant though), seared scallop (my favorite part of the entire meal), filet with shrimp, and the chocolate duo (only desert option on tasting menu) - all very tasty. Shrimp was a tad overcooked for my liking, but I'm picky with food. Filet cooked perfectly and the red wine mushroom reduction was delicious. Portions small, BUT filling! Wine selections paired with each course we're perfectly paired! Keep in mind the wine portions are very small. (See pictures) My husband had the wagyu chef special (NOT the wagyu skirt steak on the menu, I bet it would have been better) and he did not like it at all. In fact he did not even finish it, which is not like him at all. He said it tasted like maple syrup was poured on top of the meat. I didn't even want to try it after he described it that way. He ended up helping me eat some of my food - which he really liked!  Service: very nice and professional. Super quick with serving drinks and food... So take your time ordering so you can enjoy the atmosphere!  I took off 1 star because of my husband's meal. You would think for a super expensive plate it would have at least tasted good. Oh well, it's Vegas and most nice restaurants are very pricy... So to be expected. Just wish he enjoyed his meal.",

My food was served to me COLD... I had to wait about 15-20 after being served AND had to tell another waiter to go and ask for my waiter to even check on us to see if my food was served up to par. After letting my waiter know that my food was cold, it took an additional 20 minutes just reheat my food. By this time, my guest was finished eating her food COMPLETELY and she had to eat alone on her birthday. Managers came by to apologize and basically still gave me the ticket for the food that I did not eat at full price. Oh..they sent one glass of moscato to compensate for a $159.00 meal to reconcile. The view was nice but I won't be returning because of the service experience.",

Normally you are required to pay per person to go up to the top of the tower for the view but it is included with your meal purchase.  We ordered surf and turf which included steak and lobster for a hefty price of around $100 per person plus tip. I've eaten off the strip for around $20 Per person plus tip with comparable food.  I love the experience but cannot justify going to this restaurant unless I am celebrating a special occasion and want to spend quite a bit of money.  I had family from out of town visiting and decided to give an extravagant experience. For my normal days, my steak and lobster experience will be off the strip at one of the locals' casinos with a View from an elevated location to overview the city.",

But there is a new high rise under construction, next to the SLS hotel, that blocks quite a big chunk of the view towards the strip, such as the Wynn Resort. So at night you see a big black space next to the west side of strip.   Unfortunately because of that building one won't be able to see the entire strip as one could before. Rest of Vegas is quite interesting, but not unique, since it is just a regular city one sees when flying out of an airport at night.",

The servers, sommeliers and chefs do a magnificent job of letting you take all this in with elegant comfort and service. Kodos to all!  There is, however, one small, but not unimportant shortcoming at the start: the bread rolls brought to our table are soft, tasteless and unappetizing. There are few more special joys with a cocktail or a glass of aperitif glass of wine than a warm, crunchy bread roll with butter and olive oil. But, Alas, this has been replaced with the aforementioned mushy cottonwad-like replacement. So, please do think this change through, because you had these treats in many of our past visits to this world-class venue over the years.  The one advantage of this situation, of course, is that we do have a little more room to enjoy more of the magnificent entrees from the classy menu's selections. But still, we would welcome back the crispy rolls and baguette slices from the recent past as we peruse the wonderful menu with our aperitifs.  Thank you --  A recent very pleased diner.",

The garlic one was really good but the orange one was disgusting. The lobster bisque was too sweet and there was barely any lobster, maybe like a tiny little piece cut into little tiny pieces. The duck was not flavored good at all. It was too sweet as well, weird taste to it. The stratosphere white chocolate mousse tower was the reason I have to give this restaurant a 3 because it was really good. The baked potato was really good too. The view was romantic and amazing, you could see most of Las Vegas. The  concept of the restaurant moving was also pretty cool, it took an hour and 20 to spin around completely. Our waiter was really friendly and welcoming, he spoke to us for about 15 minutes and checked up on us a couple times. The price was definitely overpriced and wasn't worth it. Maybe we should've tried the steak but we were tired from having steak in other places.",

    "text": "Came here alone for a late lunch on a beautiful Sunday, April 26, at around 2:15 PM.  I've been here on several occasions before, but never alone...  Checked in with the hostess at the front desk on the 2nd floor of the Stratosphere.  Made my way through security line and waited for the elevator for a little over 5 minutes before I was able to get to the 106th floor.  The ride up was about a minute or so...  Upon exiting the elevator, you have to check in again, which was a little overwhelming, considering you've already made so many stops.  The wait for a table for one was about 10 good minutes...considering the lunch crowd has pretty much died down by this time.  I was seated at a table behind 3 gentlemen facing away from them.  My waiter, Andrew, came by to see what I wanted to drink & I ordered my usual boring virgin pina colada.  After he brought my drink, he took my order and I was ready to get down to business.  The view was magnificent and the weather was just perfect.  I couldn't have picked a better day to sit atop this beautiful restaurant, while taking in all that Vegas has to offer.  When my wagyu carpaccio arrived, Andrew also had another table show up waiting to be seated.  He had to go and tend to them so I didn't want to be rude and bother him to take a picture of me with my food.  So, I decided to bother the 3 gentlemen behind me instead.  Yes, I literally turned around just to interrupt their meals.  But they were so sweet about it...  The wagyu carpaccio was excellent.  Beautiful presentation as well.  It had just the perfect blend of flavor, oil, and the consistency was just to die for.  It literally melts in your mouth and the cheese adds just the right amount of salt to give it that extra flavor.  I basically finished the whole thing in under 3 minutes.  Lol  A few minutes later, my short rib and crabmeat Benedict shows up.  It was delicious!  The hollandaise sauce was perfect with every bite.  The short rib was moist and tender.  I couldn't finish it because I had already finished my appetizer, plus I'm not a potato fan...but even then the potatoes tasted great.  Andrew came back to check on me several times to ensure that I was enjoying my meal and indeed I was in heaven.  Great food, beautiful view and excellent service!!  What else can a girl ask for?  Andrew suggested that dessert would make it even better, but unfortunately I didn't have any room.  It would've definitely been great to have my friend, Joe, with me again...but I forgave him for not meeting me due to his being so busy prepping for the big fight at the MGM next week.  I still had a wonderful time nonetheless.",

The Top of the World is located around the 106th floor of the Stratosphere hotel and has a rotating dining room giving you fantastic views of all of Las Vegas. The menu gives you a few different choices but is largely overpriced. However, the $90 tasting option is the best way to go. You start off with soup or salad and then proceed through three other courses, including a peppered salmon and delicious desserts. Although I don't usually like to spend big on dinners in Vegas, I recommend giving this place a try just once. And definitely get the wine pairings for only a little bit more!",

We went to the happy hour at 107 sky lounge first and enjoyed the BOGO cocktails. They were awesome and what a great deal. After walking down to the restaurant, we were greeted and seated promptly. We came for the steak and ordered the filet cooked rare. OMG, me and my wife both agreed it was better than Ruth's Chris. We had potatoes on potatoes for sides. The potato puree, and the twice baked potato. The puree was better tasting if you were only going to side on one or the other. Only negative comment I have was I had a non-expiring $25 <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> gift certificate and they did not except it. They told me I could call <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> and try to figure out. I figured spending over $200 that the manger would just credit me $25. He did ask if we wanted a cocktail as we were leaving but my wife was ready to go. I wasn't sure if he was going to comp that or not but we kindly declined. Other than that, the service and quality of food was a+ and we will more than likely return.",

We then had the chicken, filet, salmon and ribeye for entrees. Everything was cooked perfectly. Another awesome part about this restaurant are the crazy people who do the Sky Jump at the top of the Stratosphere.

If you have reservations you can go right up, no problems.    We were very early so we decided to hang out in the lounge, we were greeted by the waitress very quickly and offered a menu. We ordered the last tango cocktail and it was good but not something I would ever try again.   We were seated at 825, and given great service from our waitress, she offered us drinks and let us know what some of the favored items on the menu were. my fiance got the wagyu skirt steak, I ordered the rack of lamb. Both were very tasteful and very well prepaired.   The wagyu was very good but I didn't feel it was worth as much as they charge.  The lamb was cooked perfectly, the only thing I didn't care for was the risotto it was dry. We also ordered a side of broccolini that was no more than steamed with no flavor.  We got desert after, we ordered the lemon bar cheesecake, it was outstanding, had to be the best cheese cake I had ever tried. I also ordered coffee which was fresh and delicious.   For the 2 of us it was about 165$ after tip, and we also had the 10% discount from using the players card. I would recommend that this place should be tried at least once if you have the money to spend.",

    "text": "Three stars for the spectacular view 800+ feet above the entire Las Vegas valley. But there are more things to point that weren't great, than things that were.  Here's what you need to know about this restaurant on the 106th floor: You must make a reservation; make it for just prior to sunset and ask for a window table. After you're seated, you'll definitely hear people plead for those tables instead of their own booths set back from the windows (\"Please....? We are from Ecuador.\") What?? That family, by the way, was told they could sit where they were seated, or wait about 30 minutes for the next window table to possibly open up. They stayed put, and complained about everything from their drinks to the temperature of their meat.  This place is very expensive, but worth it for special occasions, or that once-in-a-lifetime romantic dinner. What will irk you, though: They make a point of saying there is a dress code - business casual. That's a little subjective, sure -- but the woman on the phone specifically said no shorts, no jeans, and men must wear shoes and a collared shirt of some kind. Not a problem for most folks, foreign tourists and Americans from all corners, alike. The problem is, it's not enforced, which really, really takes away from the experience. We walked in dressed very nicely (casual, but proper dining attire) behind a whole family of four wearing T-shirts, shorts and sneakers. And some hick had a sleeveless shirt with sandals, and his teenage bride's ass was hanging out of her Daisy-Dukes. It soured everything from the start. We tried to ignore that and focus on us, and the view. Because the 360-degree rotation takes about 80 minutes, the service is deliberately slow-paced, which is fine. You're paying for the view and ambiance (if you can avoid looking at the white-trash family two tables over).  We chose the chef's 4-course tasting menu, at $98/per person. My Caesar salad was fantastic. Fresh and flavorful. My wife's lobster bisque was garbage. Watery (not creamy), overly salty, with a tiny chunk of lobster meat at the bottom. Her next course was a SINGLE scallop, which tasted good, but was sitting in an unnecessary bed of roasted corn and red peppers. My pork belly was a solitary piece of pork fat with a hint of swine. We both got the same entree, and our filet mignons were ridiculously good, cooked perfectly. String beans and mashed potatoes were equally good. The 2 accompanying shrimps were NOT good in the least. Tasted old and squishy, no flavor, smelled like fish. I once heard chef Emeril Lagasse (not affiliated with this place) say: \"If the fish smells like fish, go with the chicken.\" The dessert -- a small helping each of chocolate mousse and crime brulee --was definitely good, but nothing to rave about.  The waitstaff was on-point: polite, refilled water constantly, checked on us when appropriate. As the room rotated, however, you'd move past the open kitchen, where you could hear the cooks yelling out orders and ringing their little bell to signify plates were ready to serve -- that, again, takes you out of the experience and makes you wonder why you're paying about $250 for diner grub and service. All in all, glad we went for the experience, but there's no need to ever go back. And they're doing themselves a huge disservice by pretending they're a sophisticated, exclusive restaurant -- and then allowing in anyone with a working credit card. Final, side point: Eating here allows you to go up one level to the 107th-floor observatory. Views are the same as dinner. Don't waste your time. There's a bar, inexplicably loud-ass club music, a juice/smoothie/candy place, and a gift shop. It was a tremendously tacky waste of space, and most people were just hanging out and looking at their smartphones anyway. One floor above that are the outdoor rides, which were closed due to high winds.",

    "text": "Everything that could be wrong with the food was wrong. We ordered the chefs pre fixe, which is $98 per person. The free bread was stale and bland, the butter was cheap and one was very sweet tasting, like in a bad way. The lobster bisque was a pathetic joke, they poured a dark orange looking thin broth over the tiniest lump of creamed lobster in the center of the plate. The soup tasted like vinegar and was so unpleasant I couldn't finish it. Of course the waiter said nothing when he picked up my totally full bowl of soup but I had hopes for the next courses. The one scallop was covered in a cloyingly sweet sauce it took over the delicate flavor but then the scallop itself was so undercooked that it was slimy.  The filet was covered in some type of A1 steak sauce and it tasted like it came out of a microwave and yet was not hot. It also tasted like not a filet mignon. It tasted like it was hammered to death.  I'm very saddened because I was with a special guest that night and could not say anything to my waiter in the moment. $100 I spent on my meal and I still had nothing I could eat. The dessert was also sad. The creme brulee didn't have a sugar coating that was hard!! That's like.. what creme brulee is. Also it was thin consistency and bland. The chocolate just tasted like chocolate with an oily white chocolate stick in it. Just sad.  In addition I think they should slow down the spinning of the room, I timed it from one point full circle to the same point and it took under 38 minutes!! I believe it should be at least an hour. It's slow, but it's the type of speed that you're never able to not notice you're moving... and if you're the one seated with your back to the movement it makes you feel like you're moving backwards the whole time which is a confusing feeling when trying to eat. But seriously if that poor \"filet\" had been edible I wouldn't really have had such issue with everything else. I've paid well over $100 for a good steak and will continue to do so. I'm from Texas and I know steaks. NO filet mignon should have a gravy covering it. No decent steak should be hidden under any sauce. It had fake grill marks on it for gods sake!! I think the sauce was indeed to hide a very cheap and microwaved cut of beef.",

    "text": "If you would like the view of the entire Vegas light, this is your place.  However, I will not recommend this place for dinner. Go to the lounge instead for a drink.  It will save you some heartache and pocket sore.  Food is definitely average at best.  We had one Chef's tasting menu for $98, a soup dish and one pasta.  1/2 bottle of VC champagne.   Lobster Bisque, come luke warm and with a bitter taste.  Secondi, Kurobuta Pork Belly, absolutely disastrous.  The taste was all right, Thai favor with subtle hint of lemon grass. But the presentation of pork belly was bad, the meat pieces were with a pale color, worst is the temperature.  It is not even warm.  You would think it was pickled pieces of bacon.  Ugh.  Then it is the Filet mignon  and Shrimp scampi.  Pretty good portion, again food temperature like it had been sitting there forever.  The desert was acceptable - chocolate duo.  A chocolate mouse in ramkin and white choco cup with cream and berries.  From the service part; the girls who greeted in the front were just plain bored with their job.  No reception and call by a single word of your last name.  Made me feel like I was going to a dental office.  The champagne half bottle came after our first course.  It wasn't even cold when poured.  The waiter came and pour a full glass.  The waiter tried hard but he was so busy.  I told him that it was my mom's 92 birthday, he came with a candle on the ordered desert. No songs no complimentary cake.  It seemed that they were overworked and under paid.  The bus boy came with very nice bread.  He presented 3 types of butter, rattling out some mumbles. I had him repeated 3 times before I could catch the words.  Everyone was on the rush for something else except attending to the patron.    The bill came at $244.  The price didn't surprised.  It was the cattle call behavior and airplane catering food quality that really disappointing.",

    "text": "First time here and was happy with the results! Came for our anniversary!  Fair warning, this place is expensive! Make sure you are prepared to spend over $200 for a couple. That's not including a tip.   We went to the observation tower while waiting. The view is breath taking! Literally taking your breath away! Received a text letting me know that our table is ready. Was greeted by the hostess and asked how our night was going. They warned us that the dining area rotates, please be careful. Takes 1 hour, 20 mins to make full rotation.   My husband ordered 16 oz steak with fried horseradish - amazing! I ordered the seafood alfredo with extra alfredo sauce, grape tomatoes, shrimp and lobster - awesome! Needed more parmesan cheese as I love cheese! The bread was warm and yummy. Ordered broccoli with mushrooms and creamy spinach sides. All food was excellent! I must say I really enjoyed my husband's steak more than my dinner. That steak was so amazingly awesome! Melt in your mouth tasty! We ordered drinks from the lounge.  Our waitress was helpful and attentive. I asked her to take our picture and was so happy to do so. Our table was in front of the windows, which made viewing better as there was no one in front of our view.   This is a great place to go, experience something new! Don't come here with expectations. Come here with an open mind and enjoy yourselves! You will thank yourself later! Enjoy!",

It was my birthday and she didn't do anything to acomandate to make the day more special for someone's birthday!  She didn't assign us a seat by the window even though there were tables that were empty by the view...  It would've been better if she gave me a reason to why we couldn't have the window seating but she made no effort what so ever ...   For $300 dinner for 2 you would expect much better service from the host she didn't even smile one bit! Obviously customer service was not one of her traits.   Besides the negatives. Our dinner was excellent.  Must have the Chocolate Godiva cocktail  The foie gras and the porkbelly appetizer was mouth watering!  Our entree was ribeye steak amazing ..!  The lamb was just okay ..",

    "text": "Absolutely the best lunch value in all of Las Vegas in my opinion!  I try to visit every time I'm in town and have never been disappointed in any aspect of the service and food in all the years I've been going there.  Most recently was last week, taking my 24yo daughter to Vegas for the first time.  We planned our nice lunch for last Friday.  And for the first time, I actually bought the discount tickets from Tix4Tonight - they have kiosks all about town.  For only a few bucks a coupon we got a 25% discount off each lunch!  And of course, if you have lunch at the Stratosphere, your \"ride to the top\" is included - normally $20 a person.  We were greeted and promptly seated - the staff here are consistently pretty amazing.  And of course being a later lunch on a weekday, we got a window table so my daughter could take in the 80-minute, 2-mile long ride in a circle - just about the time it takes for a leisurely lunch and you get to see the entire skyline go by.  For starters we ordered the Smoked Atlantic Salmon with Brioche Toast, with capers shallots and creme fraiche.  And as always, it did not disappoint.  Simply superb.  My daughter isn't a big fan of salmon but this changed her mind!  She actually ate half the plate!  My only criticism is there's simply not enough toast.  Four very small pieces is just not right.  I'd like to see them up the toast count... but we made do with the bread basket so it was just fine.  For our mains, I had the Braised Beef Sort Rib Benedict and Crab Red Pepper Hollandaise, served over a four cheese potato cake, with 2 perfectly poached eggs, roasted carrots and green beans.  It was simply heaven on a plate... wonderful flavors, perfectly balanced.  The beef was \"melt in your mouth\" - so moist and tender it was just amazing.  Jenny and I shared both our entre choices and she loved the Benedict as much as I did.  Her choice was the Lobster Bisque and a Twice Baked Potato.  I've never seen bisque served the way they do here - a nicely seasoned 1/4-cup pile of crab is in the bottom of the bowl when served, and the bisque is gently poured around it.  It was a tad sweet for my taste, but otherwise - like everything else - pretty amazing.  And the twice baked potato was HUGE!!  There was no way we could finish all of this wonderful food and boxes were't an option - pity, because I'd otherwise never leave leftovers of this quality behind.  The service was impeccable.  It's as if they all have a \"third eye\" and know when to attend and when to stay back.  We were never once interrupted in conversation, yet never left without refills or empty plates needing to be picked up.  Sure it's a tad spendy by some standards - but for less than $90 including 20% gratuity, my daughter had a lunch she won't soon forget.  We finished our visit by watching the crazy people jump off the tower (1,140 feet) and the other rides on the roof.  There's a reason they have a whole wall full of Zagat and other awards for culinary excellence.  Great job Top of the World.  I will be back.",

With reservations,  my bf&I were seated right away&taken into a slowly revolving tower overlooking the flashing lights of Vegas. Service - great friendly service & very attentive! Food - high quality&amazing! For starter,we got the crab cake which had delicious chunky pieces of crab & a refreshing cabbage slaw&remoulade sauce to compliment it. For the main meal, I ordered the large gulf prawns,scallops&lobster w/ a side of gnocchi. Wow,the prawns,scallops&lobsters were perfectly cooked&seasoned,& the gnocchi had the perfect soft texture.   Overall, I was absolutely impressed w/ the food&had an enjoyable experience. Def recommend trying!",

    "text": "I wanted to surprise my girlfriend for our 3 year anniversary and take her out to eat at a really nice restaurant. I spent days trying to figure out when I finally decided on here. Man oh man did I choose correctly.   I made reservations through open table, which was really efficient.   We get here at like 9:30 so the sun is completely down. We get to the lobby, they do bag checks for the ladies and make you go through a metal detector before you can get on the elevator to go up to the restaurant.   The restaurant is on floor 107 and you can feel how fast the elevator is flying to get there.   We get seated in no time and all I can say is WOW for the view. It was so awesome.    It's a perfect date restaurant, dim lighting, awesome view. Although, the music threw me off as it was upbeat. You would think it would be more romantic type music. For how romantic the restaurant is.   The restaurant takes an 1 hr and 30 min to spin all the way around to get a full 360 view of the strip.  You may get a little dizzy looking out the window but if your date is going well you shouldn't be looking out the window that much!! Lol  The service was great, they quickly took our drinks and food orders.   I ordered the \"Wagyu Skirt Steak\" 12oz Girlfriend ordered \" Filet Mignon\" 9oz And we got a side of mashed potatoes we knew the steaks alone wouldn't fill us up  My Wagyu steak was just amazing. Cooked perfectly medium rare. Left me wanting more!   My girlfriend never had filet Mignon before so she was just blown away at the texture and flavor.   The mashed potatoes, for just being mashed potatoes. Tasted amazing too!   The bill came out to 126$ but to celebrate our three years this was the perfect place to go.  Taking her here definitely earned me some brownie points! Lol so fellas if you got a big date coming up , anniversary , proposal, just a date. This is the perfect place!",

We went for lunch---which was about the same price as paying for a ticket to get up to the observation deck, so why not get food with it.  The sandwiches were good, and the side salad was generous.  I know at dinner its super expensive, but for lunch its a steal.  Service was very attentive---which was what I expected for an expensive restaurant (see my review of Mix for the night before so my expectations were low).  They used flair in the presentation of the soup we ordered, offered to use our camera to take photos of us, chatted without being overly chatty, and made me feel like they were glad we were there and that they could share the experience.    Go for lunch, spend time on the observation deck afterwards...and don't be surprised when people go flying by the windows (thank goodness they had signs telling you what was going on!)",

Once you get to the hotel area, You go up in a small elevator and it does feel weird to go up so high, but once you walk into the restaurant and out of the elevator, you feel kind of normal again.  The BEST part is where your table is, we were close to the window, had a great view, great table, and got to enjoy the whole rotation of seeing Las Vegas city lights at night.  It was really cool for me :)   The rotation moves very very slow, and you can enjoy the window view high up in the sky while having dinner.   I felt the restaurant was romantic atmosphere too!   We had a good server and the food was delicious but expensive!!  We ordered seafood and steak with mashed potatoes.   The bread was great and the butter comes in this cute shape form of a \" mini Stratosphere\".   I think it takes about 1 hour for the whole restaurant to spin 360,  and you will pass by dessert tables...  so you can get an idea of what you want to order for dessert later ;)   Overall, great experience especially as a tourist and I would like to go back again!  Definitely make reservations and take the time to sit, eat, relax, enjoy dinner with a view!",

The drink pairings that came with it was just perfect and enhanced the taste of the food.  Not only is the food excellent, but the service is amazing.

Nothing was noticeable from the dining table, but the carpet and walls were clearly aged all along the route one must take from valet to tower entrance. There is a brief security check before ascending the tower. They also say - and have a sign saying - business casual strictly enforced however while there were folks dressed up beyond business casual there were also people in jeans and athletic wear. The servers were all friendly and all the food we were served was good, if only a bit salty. There is a photographer who comes by and takes your picture several ways. She really did a brilliant job and I actually bought one of the $45 displays featuring one of our solo portraits and our pic together. 2 wallets with holder sold for something in the 20s. This restaurant does revolve and we got around about 1.5 times - and saw one sky jumper fly by our window during dinner. I actually do recommend this place. I know a lot of places that are iconic (e.g., have height or revolve) get lazy in making good food but this wasn't one of those places. From the looks of the area though and my brief experience in town this is not a section of the strip worth hanging out much in. Drive down here for dinner but then go back south on Las Vegas Blvd for more fun on the strip.",

    "text": "The Top of the World Restaurant .. dot dot dot...  Came with a huge party to celebrate a birthday on a Saturday night.  The restaurant was not very busy which makes sense for the current economy and the prices of this restaurant.  Besides their amazing view and outstanding service, this place was maybe on top of the world but certainly not on top of their food.  I can describe this experience as cafeteria food in the elegant setting.  The sixty something dollars I spent here would've been better spent going to the terrace upstairs and riding the rides.    I ordered the Kurobuta Pork Chop which was, again, something I could probably get at  a hospital's cafeteria for less than $7 but instead I paid 6 times more that amount.  Which by the way, they charge minimum $50 per person since they include the \"ride\" to see the view.  The only thing that was good was the sweet mashed potatoes.  I actually enjoyed the pork chop's sauce with the sweet mashed potatoes more than with the dry flavorless pork chop.  The sauce had a sweet and spicy kick that didn't overwhelm the dish.  The service however, outstanding!  Top notch.  Our server has to be one of the best servers I've had.  I forgot his name but he had interesting eyebrows.  He knew the entire menu and did not leave our side the entire time.  Here's my recommendation if you're reading this.  Eat at the Stratosphere's food court (or somewhere else besides this restaurant) and take your date upstairs to enjoy the amazing view.  You will not regret this as much, TRUST ME.  Actually, there's a very cool bar on the second floor where you can enjoy the view too.  Do not eat here though.  I tried other plates from the rest of my party and nothing really had a great taste considering their prices.  1 Star for the food, 5 stars for the location and the service.",

I came along with a meat-loving foodie who was picking up the tab on an expense account (thank god! it is PRICEY!).  He was not crazy about any of his food (which I believe was a cheese plate and steak?), but the wine was great and the view is of course spectacular!!  The service was very good as well.  I had a good time, but the food isn't good enough to bring me back. Especially when you can just go up to the lounge and have a $10 cocktail and enjoy essentially the same view.

The city view of Las Vegas is a dream and it's so cool while you are dining the restaurant rotates 360 degrees so you get to see the city from different angles. Our waiter Dan D. was super nice and very attentive. The reason I am giving this place a four stars is because the food isn't that great. I ordered the Mexican prawns and scallops and they were kind of blend and salty, not to mention very pricey! but I guess you get charged for the experience and not so much for the food.",

    "text": "This is a very nice restaurant albeit obscenely expensive.  But that's not my biggest beef with the place. They make a point of telling you (on 'hold' messages, on their website and when you make a reservation) that it is 'business casual' dress (in other words, nice clothes - no shorts, t-shirts, flip flops, etc.)  So we brought nice clothes and went to the restaurant.  You have to go through at least 4 'checkpoints' (including a metal detector a la airports) to get to the restaurant itself - plenty of opportunity to let the unwashed, clueless cretins who stroll in with a wifebeater and swim trunks wanting to eat in a clearly fine dining restaurant.  But NOOOOOOOOO....apparently they let anybody who can fog up a mirror and afford the prices come in dressed like they're going to the pool. I asked one of the waiters about it and he gave me this pained look of agreement. He said it is pretty common that people come in dressed contrary to the dress code, and to complain to management is futile. He said to go on Yelp and leave candid feedback and hopefully that would get the management's attention.  Well, here it is. Enforce your dress code or don't have one!  By the way, the view is pretty awesome.  But bring the equivalent of your mortgage or rent payment to cover your bill.  :-)",

We took the ride up to the top of the world restaurant and the view was awesome. The restaurant rotates continuously and the view is breathtaking. Our server was very polite and courteous. I ordered the curry chicken soup and my wife had a salad to begin with along with some great hot bread. Soup was great. I decided to go with the Ribeye steak medium and my wife went with the short rib lobster stuffed pasta. Food came out pretty late, about 30 minutes later. My steak was looking fabulous and tasted great until I finished the outer portion. When I bit into the juicier part it was apparent that the steak was extremely rare. It tasted so bloody and the fat portion was even rubbery from lack of being cooked. I totally lost my appetite and could not eat anymore. I asked the bus boy to take it away, I was so disappointed. Meanwhile, my wife was so loving her short rib lobster stuffed pasta. I tried it as well and it was very good. The waiter finally came over and apologized for the steak. I told him it wasn't his fault but I was disappointed and totally lost my appetite. After wife finished her food, I asked for the check. I was not in the mood for dessert even though we were celebrating our 20th year anniversary. They didn't even give us a free dessert like most places do for special occasions. When the waiter came back, he gave us our check and told me he removed the steak from the bill. I thanked, paid and left. We did go up to the observatory to check out the view. Too bad, it was a good night till the steak and lack of customer service ruined it. Won't be back again",

Recommended by another friend, I'm glad we ditched our reservations at a trendy new place at Bellagio for this \"old school\" classic. The restaurant spins around so you get amazing 360' views of Las Vegas at night, and every once in a while someone bungee jumps off in front of you! Or waitress was trained by Disney before moving to Vegas, and she knew her stuff! Attentive, but not hovering, and knowledgeable about the menu. Quiet atmosphere and very good food. I had the tice baked potato side dish and shared it, because as described it is huge. Desserts were luxurious, and I had a delicious spiked coffee to finish. Then we went on the observation deck to enjoy the views, and watch the folks in the \"thrill rides\". Make it a must do on your list.",

Getting to the stratosphere we took the monorail and it is about a 10 minute walk to get from the last stop that is by the SLS hotel. once you enter the hotel it takes about another 5-10 minute depending how fast you walk to make it to the reservation table. Then go thru security. take the elevator up that goes 21mph where your ears start to pop. check in to get seated. Pay attention to where you are seated in what section so you do not get lost. The whole tower rotates around so it is easy to get lost. They say it takes about 1 hour and 20 minutes to go all the way around. We did the groupon deal where we get the 4 course meal. Honestly it is worth it and enough. My girl and I both chose the opposite of what we wanted. So we get to try everything. Lobster bisque was good but the seasoning was a little to much. second course the pasta was good nothing crazy. I had the filet it looked more like a regular steak than filet, but it was a big portion a little salty over seasoned but good, the mashed potatoes was really good. The salmon is honestly fresh and really good if you had to choose. The dessert was the best part. I liked the chocolate ice cream, just amazing and good to top it off. We left feeling full, and satisfied. We ended up purchasing the wallet size picture that was taken was about $28 why not. We did not have time to go check out the other levels, but i am sure it is amazing. It is a cool experience to check out if you have time.",

We ordered the bone in rib eye with been side and wagyu rib eye; along with potato puree and asparagus.   We were also brought a generous serving of tasty bread to begin our meals.   It was tasty, the steak fat wasn't quite rendered down enough on the bone in rib eye but still enjoyable.   Yes the meal is a bit more expensive but you are paying for the view and experience.  The motion is noticeable if you are particularly sensitive, but you should be able to manage (as I did).",

We were treated like royalty and seated next to the windows on the revolving floor. In the course of 80 minutes to make a full revolution, we were treated to magnificent views of Las Vegas and the surrounding mountains. The service was efficient and friendly but not solicitous or hurried. My wife and I split the large caprese salad. She then had spaghetti squash, and I had Scottish salmon with grilled asparagus. For dessert we shared spumoni in a dark chocolate shell. Everything was outstanding. There is a wide variety of steaks as well as other dishes (on the expensive side, though). Photographers are also there to take photos for special occasions and offer them for sale tableside at a reasonable price. This is the ideal place for romantic getaways, anniversaries, and marriage proposals. You just can't go wrong here.",

The restaurant wasn't busy when I arrived but got worse as the night went on. It's okay to be busy, but it's not okay to lack employees for it.   The view? Yeah...that's nice.

(I think he told us if we want to share, it will be $15 charge)  Thanks to our waiter for his recommendation for everything we asked, but during the meal, we don't really feel like we are being take care.   Also, when we need to pay our check, he and other three waiters are chatting. We wave at him but one of them just ignore us.  There will be photographer walking around taking photos for your groups, but her attitude? Hah... you better be prepared. Maybe she went through some bad things, she looks really unhappy talking to us. After she took the photo, she brought us the printed photos, two photos with the cover cost $45. Still, with inpatient attitude. We don't like the photos so we didn't take that. She took the photos and turn back to us with unfriendly and impatient voice: \"enjoy your evening.\" Well, I don't really feel she wish us to enjoy.

There are a handful of great restaurants with a view of Vegas but none compare to this at the top of Stratosphere.",

It brings great joy to me to show friends & family the beauty of our city.  Both views in the day & at night are a must so I will have to bring them to dinner one day too!  The restaurant rotates slowly as you eat so you can take it all in leisurely.  I always go when I'm not rushed for time & can spend a good hour and a half or so.    The Caprese is mmm, a must!  It's seasonal w/ sweet slices of watermelon layered between burrata & yellow heirloom tomatoes, topped w/ edible flowers, my fav!  Drizzle of balsamic, pesto & pine nuts.  Beautiful presentation!    Dee recommended her fav, the Seafood Linguine that I added some red pepper flakes to since I love everything to be spicy & it was even more tasty!  They do not skimp on the shrimp or crab, both cooked perfectly & paired so well w/ a surprisingly lite cream sauce.    Love the bread as well w/ the orange butter & pesto butter.  After all that, we had no room for dessert, but I took pix of how nice of a job the pastry chefs do.",

I would order this again. my hubby got the Maryland crab stuffed chicken...I tried his and didn't really like it, maybe it's cause I'm not a fan of crab with chicken together. overall, it was a great experience.",

Being 106 stories up and slowly spinning around to give you complete 360 views of the area was great.  Our waiter was awesome. Explained the menu very well to us and made sure we had everything we need every step of the way. My wife ordered the filet mignon and I had the wagyu skirt steak with the lobster tail. My steak was very tender and the lobster was fantastic  my wife's filet was so tender and juicy it almost melted in your mouth. One of the better steaks I have had. I had a few beers with dinner and my wife had a few glasses of wine. The dinner was very good and we both enjoyed the views while eating. We did decide to order the cheese cake for desert. It was also very good! Thanks to Top of the World for giving this to us free for our anniversary!  We did check out the observation tower on the 109th floor after dinner!  Would definitely recommend this place to anyone wanting to celebrate a special occasion.",

No casual business attire. No worries.   The service. The view. The live music. The view. Had to throw that in again as you're dining up a hundred floors up while the restaurant is rotating so you have a view of the entire valley. One complete revolution in 120 minutes.   Anyway, called the restaurant as it was mentioned that admittance to the tower is waived if you're dining up there. No openings except for a 9:45 slot so that's the end of the call. A few minutes later, decide to call back to ask about reservations for Saturday night but then was invited to come down \"now\" to be taken care probably because of the little white lie about being a \"Vegas first-timer\".   Casino parking - valet or self park. Make your way to the host/hostess who directs you to security where you pass thru a metal detector. That's also where you see multiple signs about the dress code. I was dressed down to the point where if I saw myself on the street, I might give myself some spare change or maybe even a few bucks. But, no one says anything. Not the hostess; security guard; elevator attendant; three more hostesses, the server, the bus person and the manager. I'm not worried about it too much as I have the attitude that if they don't want my money, I'll spend it elsewhere.  Anyway - the food. Ordered the Mosaic of Chilled Seafood. That's a meal in itself. Lobster, Poke, Oysters, Shrimp and an Oyster shooter. The Poke was incredible. The rest was good. Not great. Good.   For my meal, I had the Surf and Turf. Steak and shrimp. Steak was ordered medium and it was served medium. Juicy, tender; full of flavor. Mashed potatoes were on the creamy side - I tend to like it a little chunky. The shrimps were huge and cooked just right. Really good overall.   Service was most excellent. She was always there when she was needed but she wasn't annoyingly present. Bus person always showed up to clear plates to refill the drinks. The manager even stopped by to check up on us. Being doted on is not a bad thing. And either the staff thought I have celeb status or the staff is just really good. And though I like to think it's all about me, I have to admit, the staff was just pros and looked like they enjoyed their job.   The views were spectacular. You'll have to trust me on that one or see it for yourself. Try to be there for sunset.",

The food was pretty good but not exceptional enough to warrant the insane prices. However the biggest problem was the service.  For example, I ordered my steak seared (almost raw) how could that possibly take almost an hour??   But by far the most insulting part was our waiter, named \"Bon\" what a total a-hole.  He was totally inattentive, never checked on us, we had to almost throw shit at him to get him to refill our drinks while we waited endlessly for even a bread basket.  Meanwhile he chatted up the table text to us while leaning over to stick his fat butt in my face.  This is one of the worst waiters I've ever had, especially in such and expensive place.  He even had an assistant waiter, Andy, who was super nice, but he kept undermining him when he tried to take care of us. I would not recommend this place to anyone.  Or go to the lounge on floor 107 to enjoy the view.  This place made me furious and put a major damper on my night.  Hopefully I'll drink so much at the next club I'll forget all about it.",

    "text": "$$ makes the world and this restaurant go round.  During an impromptu Vegas trip, I made resos for this popular place. Being from Chicago, I love all things tall and a chance to get breath-taking view is always at the top of my list. We had been drinking a little before, as everyone does in Vegas. We were running a little late for our reso but when I called to notify, they seemed cool. We walk through the airport-type security and my buzzed self thinks i'm going to meet a celebrity with all these precautionary measures. Who's up there, Jay-Z?  We get to the pretty empty restaurant and it's very cool and unique, as everyone's mentioned, it spins! We are immediately greeted and given the specials by our waiter which is the sole reason I'm giving this place 2 stars. Granted, it was cool seeing people bun-jee off the building and the sunset was taking place around the time of our meal, but spinning in circles made me a little whoozy when I realized it. Looking around at other patrons, I notice two extremes, there's groups of retirees and high school prom dates. Was I in the twilight zone? Or did I just make a bad reso? I try to carry on without thinking much of it.  We ordered a bottle of cab sav. Sure, it wasn't the most expensive, but it was freaking horrendous. Fiancee at the time ordered a filet and I had the seared branzino. They brought us a bread basket which was nice. My fish was gross. I was trying to make the most of it because we were on a tight schedule so I swallowed it and kept it going.  He enjoyed his meal but mentioed his belly was aching a bit. We took pics of the scenery, paid the bill and skiddatled out of there.   After our show, I started feeling ill, like really ill, as did he. We went back to our hotel and pretty much everything we ate came up and we were stuck in bed for the remainder of the night. Thankfully it was a short-term stomach issue because the next day we were able to continue with our trip, but limited with what our tummies could tolerate. Idk if my fish wasn't cooked right or if there was a germ issue, but every time I think of this place, I primarily recall heaving, sleeping and missing out on a night on the town.  Grrr, Top Of the World. You're on the top of my ish list.",

    "text": "The Stratosphere is located at the very end of the strip and right before the iffy area of Vegas. I personally like the Stratosphere and have stayed here a few times on business trips. After a very long, hard day at a convention, my colleague and I decided to treat ourselves to a nice dinner at the Top of the World Restaurant.   As we rode up the elevator, with our ears popping on the way up, I became a bit anxious as I'm actually afraid of heights. I gingerly stepped out of the elevator with caution as I did not know what to expect. We found a large restaurant that SPINS!!!! Slowly, of course, but the restaurant is rotating as you eat so you get a full view of Las Vegas, Henderson and other nearby towns. We were there at night, so we got to really see all of Vegas lit up and let me tell you that was an absolute treat for the eye. Vegas is truly beautiful. You don't see the drunks stumbling the streets or the depressed people who just lost their entire life savings from up here. All you see is the beauty that makes up this awesome city. You can truly appreciate the architecture and design of LV from Top of the World Restaurant.   If I remember correctly, we both chose the Four Course Tasting Menu which included a soup or salad, a small appetizer, a steak and dessert. Now, it's been a while since I was here, so I'm guessing it's changed a little but I did peek at their current menu and they still offer this option for $90 per person. Now, let me take this opportunity to tell you that the food was very good, but it is overpriced. You are paying for the atmosphere and the view, for sure! The service was slightly above average but not to the level I would have expected for the amount of money you spend when dining here.  The meal was well paced and allowed you to view the complete 360-degrees of scenery and more if you took your time during dessert.   I would say it's worth a visit...if someone else is paying!",

I made reservations through Open Table, however, because this was a very special evening for both my husband and I celebrating birthdays I elected to make contact with Arianna also. This evening could not have been any more perfect without her assistance. She made certain we were going to be taken care of with kit gloves. Unfortunately Arianna was not working the evening we were there, but Anthony was a True professional in further handling all for us. From the minute we sat down we knew this would be an evening to remember thanks to both Arianna and Anthony.  Our waiter Abraham was delightful and very attentive. I ordered the Chef's Tasting Menu which consisted of Lobster Bisque, Kurobuta Pork Belly, and Filet Mignon with Shrimp. This was an absolute meal to die for. My Lobster Bisque arrived rather cool so I asked it be returned. There was absolutely no hisitation upon them removing it and replacing with another in a matter of minutes. The Filet was one of the best I have had ever!!! My husband ordered the Caesar Salad, Smoked Salmon and Ribeye Steak. His meal was fantastic. I could go on and one about the view, the fantastic food, the wonderful service and how romantic our evening was. My pictures should give you an idea of the beautiful night we had.",

    "text": "I have eaten here with my wife and her family a few times when we have travelled to Vegas together, and it is definitely a place I see myself going back to during future trips to Vegas. FOOD: the food here is really nice, albeit very pricy (in fact so much so that it's really this alone that keeps my review at 4 stars instead of 5; if you're gonna charge $60 for a steak, fine, but it better be the best damn steak I've ever had, which this isn't.  It's very good, but it doesn't earn the price that they charge for it.).  I usually get a Filet Mignon or some sort of steak, along with a side of either mashed potatoes or asparagus or something like that, but I have tasted several things off the menu off of other people's plate.  The beef carpaccio is one of the best I have ever had, and if I remember correctly, there is a particularly nice Caesar Salad on the menu.  SERVICE: the service here is always top notch.  Again, I've been there maybe three or four times, and I've always had great waiters and waitresses here.  They are always very knowledgeable about the menu and happy to answer any questions I might have.  My water glass is never empty, and I've never had to wait an unreasonable amount of time for a food or drink order here.  In addition, I one time ordered a dish (I don't remember what it was), that had onions in it, which I did not know when I ordered it (I hate onions; not an allergy, just a strong aversion).  I mentioned this to our waiter, who immediately offered to bring me an entirely new dish off the menu.  VIEW: it goes without saying that the view at Top of the World Restaurant is one of the best views I have had in my entire life. You are 100+ stories up in the air, and on top of that, the restaurant is continuously rotating, so by the end of the meal, you have literally seen a view of all of Las Vegas. An absolutely breathtaking view, perfect for any occasion, romatic or otherwise.  I definitely reccomend this place, just keep in mind you will be spending quite a bit to eat here.",

I felt the dress code should be stricter and more enforced. The table next to use looked like they were celebrating a wedding anniversary and didn't look too happy about the children in street clothes running around.

But I spent almost $50 on just a steak and two baby carrots....no salad, no other vegetables or side. Just meat. And while the steak was good, I have had much better for much less. I will admit the chocolate wine I had was divine and paired well with my steak. Just wish I had more to eat then just meat. If I ever return it would be simply for the ambiance and dessert.

Along with the view and the dimly lit setting, this place is very romantic and quite the place to visit if you are trying to impress someone.  The menu when I visited was different that it was now. When I dined here, the menu had a three course tasting featuring chateubriand for two. We started the meal with lobster bisque. The soup was tasty and full of lobster flavor. The chateubriand was carved tableside and was cooked to perfection. We finished the meal with a chocolate tower resembling the Stratosphere tower.

We saw people bungee jumping from the windows which was a bit scary to see while you're eating.  We were able to go to the outside observation deck for free. The views were gorgeous n u were able to see some of the stratosphere adventure rides from the deck. Overall, this was a cool spot to see one time because the prices are a bit steep. I've actually been to a similar restaurant in Riverwalk, San antonio Texas called charthouse.",

Trust me when I say he is knowledgeable and amazing at his job, I was set off by the price at first but said efffff it mayne I'm n vegas and enjoy it...so I did...and it all was great. The seafood Alfredo was the absolute bomb yo! I had the crabcake appetizer and it was just okay. I wasnt blown away by the taste or the sauce. The ceasar salad was incredible, and the lobster bisque was NOT a pleasant taste to me...HOWEVER, the Seafood alfredo was incredible, lobster, shrimp, and scallops all combined in a homemade pasta sauce that was to die for!

After a lot of shuffling around because we hadn't booked in a half empty restaurant, the four of us were eventually seated. The service was awful, but I think that was because they are short staffed. We were left for long periods of time looking around for anyone, anyone who could take an order. We were there for much longer than we should have been. View was amazing but i was there for so long I actually started to feel travel sick. No thank you.",

The restaurant crew time your meal to take at least 90 minutes.  This is how long it takes for the restaurant to rotate the full 360 so you can take in all of the sights before you leave.  As for the food this is truly a fine dining experience.  The lobster bisque is outstanding.  Beautifully rich and flavorful without being heavy.  Both times I have tried their steaks, and on both occasions the steak was cooked perfectly with a great seer, phenomenal flavoring and was extremely tender.  I have tried several sides, as well, sharing with my dining companions and everything has been very tasty.  I haven't personally tried any of their desserts, but anyone I have dined with who did said they were made incredibly well also.  If you are interested in a more upscale evening I recommend driving just slightly farther down the strip to experience what this restaurant has to offer.  Don't forget to visit the room as well when you are done so you can take in the view, and maybe even a nice photo op.",

My 10 oz steak was cooked to perfection.  The steak was tender and melted in my mouth.  Also tried the gnocchi with lobster and braised beef short ribs.   That was ok.  For dessert,  banana foster in a caramel and almond box.  Delicious!!! What a great way to end the meal.  Overall great experience! The service was good.  Awesome view. Good food!

I had the prix fixe for lunch, which was steak, lobster tail and mash potatoes with dessert. The food was good. However, I wasn't pleased that it was warm and probably was sitting on the counter for a while. My friend, who had the hamburger, said hers was warm, too, and very plain. The dessert, which was the creme brule and pot de creme, were not so great. The brule was overly sweet and I've had and can make much better. The pot de creme was too stiff, and I didn't care for it since it was dark chocolate. I prefer milk chocolate. I gave it to my fiend. My other gripe is that our waitress wasn't very attentive and hardly came around. She actually seemed grumpy. It's too bad we had to experience that since we were really looking forward to our first time there.",

    "text": "The Space: I came here for my cousin's bachelorette party; none of us have ever been there so we didn't know what to expect. First off, it is way down the Strip so if you're on the opposite end (near Aria) be prepared to pay a hefty taxi fee. Anyway, the place is really nice. The restaurant rotates while you dine so you can see all of Las Vegas. When you've just got off a plane, got only a few hours of sleep and go straight to Top of the World like we did, you might get semi-dizzy as we did. What's neat is that while you're dining, you can see the people sky jumping and doing all sorts of stuff I just can't do. As far as the restaurant itself, it's very clean and they didn't go over the top with the decor because who would want to take away from the incredible views.   The Food: The food was pretty good. They start you off with a bread basket and three types of butter: plain, pesto (we all LOVED this stuff) and orange (it was good and sweet but I'm just used eating my bread with something more savory). Being a fan of childhood favorites, I got the Lobster Grilled Cheese and Tomato Bisque. I do wish there was more cheese than lobster in the sandwich but other than that, the food was seasoned well and had lots of flavor.   The Staff: From the lady checking you in and leading you to the elevator, to the hostess bringing you to your table and of course the waitress we had, everyone was so professional, welcoming and helpful. Our waitress was as sweet as can be and was pretty entertaining. This is just a side note but there are people walking around taking pictures of your party to sell. I wouldn't mind this IF the pictures came out nice. However, when we saw the final product, it looked as if they clicked the \"contrast\" button ten times; so much to the point, everyone looked greasy. Also, with the rose border they added (they said we didn't have the option to take the border out) it looked like a memorial picture. I don't know and you but I don't want a picture like that when I want to remember our a Las Vegas trip.",

I wish I could give a half a star rating because 3 stars is not quite enough but 4 is just a little too many. The food was good to almost very good. It was just missing that little extra something that you would expect at the menu prices. We all had steaks they all came out at the right temps but the presentation was lacking. The desserts were very good I would recommend the bananas foster. What really needed work was the wait staff. No communication and a bit standoffish. They offered no recommendations and they all seemed to be hurried. Overall go for the views! Enjoy the food but realize you might not be talking about your meal the next day.

    "text": "$40 for a 3 course brunch was such a bargain considering we were dining at a restaurant 108 stories up in the sky, rotating 360 degrees to capture every possible view of the strip.  They had me hooked from the 1st course-Kobe Carpaccio. I was so hungry that I devoured it in less than 5 minutes despite the fact that we each got a complimentary shrimp cocktail just prior because I happen to find a coupon from a booklet they handed me back at the hotel. Don't be too quick to throw those coupon booklets away! You might lose out on a tasty shrimp cocktail. Speaking of \"free\" food, the brunch also came with complimentary champagne which worked out perfectly since we were in Vegas, alcohol is our best friend.  My friends swapped the 3rd course-Berry Delight for creme brulee.  Luckily I decided to stick with mine because their creme brulee came out too thick AND at room temperature. Ick!  The downfall of the meal was the photographer lady who went around to each table taking pictures to pressure us to buy after the meal.  Our pictures came out alright, well, except for the smudge on my friend's face.  The photographer told me that one of the waiters thought I was hot.  I wasn't sure if that was really the case or if it was just a ploy to get me to buy the pictures.  Well, truth or not, it worked!! I was the only one who ended up purchasing a picture. Damn, I hate being female, I'm such a sucker for compliments.  Bottom line: Eat brunch here, but watch out for False compliments ladies!!",

    "text": "Very pricey but very romantic.  We got a table by the window.  The view was absolutely breathtaking--It reminded me of being on top of the Eiffel Tower at night when I was studying abroad in France.  However, I get motion sickness very easily so the turning platform actually got me lightheaded whenever I looked down.  I tried to ignore looking down or the fact that I was moving BUT it's really hard once I realized that I was!  hah  It wasn't too bad though and after 20 mins or so my queasy feeling went away for the most part.  I recommend sitting on the upper level if you're incredibly sensitive to motion like me.  (Plus, you actually get to sit next to your date and cuddle vs. sitting across from them.)  The food was good, not worth the $$$$ but the view made it worth it.    One bad after taste I have though about this place was the lady who took our picture (Caucasian in her 50's), which you get the option of buying after dinner.  We purchased 1 photo for $22, gave the lady $30, which she then asks, \"Do you want change?\"  Umm...my bf and I aren't cheap tippers but like ~27% for just snapping 3 pictures and after JUST paying for a really pricey meal??  Come on?!  But that wasn't what bothered me, what bothered me was what she said afterward: \"Oh well, it's a good thing I asked.  I tend not to ask sometimes.\"  Are you serious?  Bleh. Overall though I would recommend this restaurant for a romantic dinner date.",

Second time we went with friends, food was still excellent, service was horrendous (which is why they aren't getting a higher rating), and they removed the dessert options we loved rom before.  It will be a long time before we consider going back.  It's a higher end on the prices to have such bad service.  Enjoy the view and the live music as well.",

Last night was the first time I dined at Top of the World restaurant at the Stratosphere--I was absolutely impressed and regret not going sooner!  The food was delicious (although I did not care too much for their lobster bisque) and the service was top notch. The view of the valley was just amazing since it was at night.  The only recommendation I have for the restaurant is to enforce a dress code--too many patrons in yoga pants, jeans and tees--since it is at the pricier end.",

This restaurant should NOT even be considered if you have any sort of dizziness, anxiety or have ever been car sick.   Metal detector first. We rode up the elevator.  Hated it.  It seemed unsafe.  We were packed in.  The elevator attendant looked up the shaft many times to see if we were going to run into the elevator above us.  Weird and very unsettling to say the least. We get to the top and the service was top notch.  A very beautiful restaurant until you are seated. Ug... immediately we all tried to enjoy, but it was inevitable.  All four of us felt like we were on a small boat out in the ocean.  The space ship ride, bungy jumpers.... just not our scene.  The rotation of the restaurant made eating miserable.  The view was amazing. The food:  I would rate 4 stars.  It was delicious.  the Caesar with white anchovies is a must.  The flank steak melted in our mouth.  The fatty pork app could eat all day and the seafood pasta dish was so worth the trip.  We all love to indulge in wine and cocktails, however, felt too weak stomached to order any drinks.",

Dinner for three cost us 350.00, and we didn't even order any drinks.  I will be going back here again on our next trip though, it is my new favorite place to go in Vegas.",

Our reservations were at 8 o'clock, and due to traffic, we did not arrive until about 815pm, and we were worried that our table would not be available. When we arrived and explained our situation, the staff could not have been more understanding. Our server was very friendly, and was exactly what I was expecting. She was very attentive to our needs, and my water glass never got below half. The food was outstanding - also exactly what I was expecting. The views are breathtaking, and the restaurant does not revolve too fast so you don't get nauseous. The Top of the World Restaurant is truly a fine dining experience, and if I ever make my way back to Vegas, I will definitely come here again. It is worth the money!",

We came here with intent to: -enjoy the scenic view of LV from above by night -have a slow romantic dinner for two -receive great service from a place that preferred more-than-casual dresscode -have good enough food to prove that this wasn't just a tourist trap.  All those expectations were met to a greater extent than I could have asked for.. the service was absolutely spot-on and friendly enough to make you feel comfortable. It was on the slower side, but that's how it always is at higher end restaurants. If you think you're waiting too long, you've never been to Italy where the average dinner is 3-4 hours long. Chat, relax, and enjoy the view!  The food selection was better than I expected, my prime rib was perfect and I barely finished it but couldn't say no to the dessert bites after eyeing a trayful being delivered to the table next to ours. Overall, I absolutely loved it here, it made for a great experience. Nothing's better than going upstairs afterwards and watching those brave souls on the X-Scream: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DJSOKHvc9Obw%26feature%3Dfvw&s=1e0ff867a17fb9a8b0a1fe110e16d97291868f98751583d036651ac8abe7da1c\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">youtube.com/watch?v=JSOK...</a>",

    "text": "Ok I admit, the view is breathtaking. The fact that it was a 360deg view was just amazing. Being surrounded by the night time view so Las Vegas... I was in awe. But the food is a different story.   We came in a large party so I got to try a few things. The general consensus is that the food is good quality, BUT poorly poorly executed. I ordered the seafood dish and my scallops, shrimp, and lobster were all overlooked. It was tasty enough so I still enjoyed it, but for the hefty price tag I expected it to be cooked perfectly. Almost everyone else in my party ordered steaks.  I tried the filet and it was very tender, but unevenly cooked. Everyone commented that their steak was either overlooked or undercooked. We didn't figure it out until the end that they must have switched up all our orders - a detrimental mistake. My poor little cousin got my boyfriend's rare+ steak. At the end he said it sucked cause his cow was still bleeding! We were pretty upset at this point, but there wasn't much we could do. My sister ordered a steak with foie gras on the side and it was horrible. Nothing like foie gras I've had before. The sides were good.  Like most restaurants with an amazing view, the food was just ok. I'm glad I came here once to see the view, but I wouldn't come again. There is also a lounge above the restaurant. So if you want to see the view without splurging $50-80 per entree for dinner, ride the elevator straight to the lounge! You can also go outside where there are telescopes and rides.   They had a photographer come around and take pictures for us, which I thought was cool! I thought they would post it somewhere, but silly me! Of course they are for sale. Guess how much a picture costs?? $60!!!",

We arrived a bit early so we got to hang out in the lounge and have a few drinks and half price appetizers while we waited for a text to let us know that our table was ready. The restaurant was very prompt in honoring our reservation, as well as our request to be seated at a table next to the window for our anniversary (make special requests via email or via open table reservation system). Our server was excellent. My husband enjoyed the bread basket, and I loved the portabello/mozarella appetizer. My dinner was fabulous...I got the filet and roasted carrots/parsnips. They were truly delicious and I was totally happy. My husband loved his Caesar salad and his entree (but I'm blanking on what he ordered right now...I know we loved everything).   The motion of the restaurant floor can be a bit disconcerting at first. I admit I felt a bit queasy for a while. But pretty soon I got used to it and felt fine. Another disconcerting thing...periodically people jump off the building and go flying down into the night right next to you. Don't be alarmed. All part of the fun!  This was a great way to celebrate our anniversary and end our little Vegas escape.",

    "text": "I decided to give this restaurant a second try, as the first time I tried it, about five years ago, left me unimpressed. I came tonight with a couple of friends. They ordered the soup of the day which was a cauliflower cream soup and I ordered the tomato and burratta salad. Both were good. I ordered the Seabass which the chef told me was phenomenal and I have no idea why he would tell me that because it tasted fishy and it was just unappetizing and disappointing. My friends got the filet mignon and said it wasn't bad at all. For dessert, the vanilla creme brulee was delicious and that saved a good part of how bad the Seabass was. I did order a Bordeaux for wine in the glass and it was OK, but I have had way better. The bread that initially came to us was hard and a little stale so I was very unimpressed. This restaurant still leaves me underwhelmed and the only thing I can say is that the reason it gets such acclaims must be because of its view and the observation deck three floors above it. We did go up to the observation deck after having dinner and it is beautiful. The view from the restaurant itself is very impressive. This is a very nice place to bring anyone that has never been to Las Vegas, who would like to see the city from a different and broader vantage point, but do not expect excellence in food because it does not compare even close to the excellence that Las Vegas offers with top chefs. This restaurant may be called Top of the world, yet it in no way signifies the quality of food, which is anything but at the top. Really too bad, as was hoping for better. There are other restaurants that offer views and currently, even though I love how high up it is and the views that you get from the restaurant, I just don't see the point of coming here when the food is as average or below average as what is available in Las Vegas. Also, the prices are exorbitant. For three people, with only one glass of wine each, it came out to $100 a person and with tip, the bill was $360. I would've hoped for way better quality of food. I will not likely be coming back. I gave it three stars because our waiter was very nice and because I love the view from the restaurant and the observation deck. I can do without the food.",

It was let's just say about 8 years ago, and leave it at that! ha ha  We had an amazing dinner, it was at night and as it slowly moved we got an AMAZING view of the Las Vegas lights.   We ordered a wonderful bottle of wine, it was sweet and fruity in a great way, It was so good I still talk about it to this day. I finished it off by myself and it was suggested to us, he also mentioned that it's not sold in many places in the U.S so I haven't even tried looking for it on my own.   But most importantly for a great special occasion, a birthday, and anniversary or just a nice night out to end a vacation visit..   You should at least try it out once. A little pricy but SOOOOOOO worth it. It's all about the memories right???",

The food is average for an upscale restaurant but totally overpriced. You are paying for the view!!! My skirt steak was very flavorful, cooked how I wanted. The mashed potatoes were a big portion ($12). My husband ordered a lobster bisque which he loved (14), but I hated it. The lobster taste was so strong, it felt more like a thick broth than a soup. The service was below average. We were only able to split the check two ways, and it was confusing.

He knew all the small details about everything on the menu and even had many personal recommendations of his own.  His service was perfect, always keeping us in the loop on when our main course was going to be delivered to the table.  The manager Anthony, stopped by our table to see how our experience was going.  He wanted to make sure our experience was meaningful, he also was a pleasure to talk with.  You know what he was saying was meaningful and not something he would say to every table.  We were extremely happy with our overall experience, highly recommend this restaurant!",

We ordered an appetizer to split, each got a salad, and shared seafood Alfredo. We were stuffed! My fiance tried a signature cocktail as well. Chocolate something. I would recommend this place for sure.",

I went with a party of 12, and amongst both meat and fish orderers alike, we felt that while the food was good, it wasn't worth the price in terms of taste/quality. I had the Branzino, and had much better branzino for half the price recently. The Foie Gras was strangly mushy and falls apart to touch. The asparagus side was good.   You pass through a security scanner before taking the elevator up. The restaurant takes about 60-90 minutes to make a full turn, which in combination with the crazy slow service allows you to enjoy the entire view during your meal.  The dining experience is not for the easily  motion sick, like myself. While the rotation is very slow and mostly smooth, the movement of the view made me a bit queasy. Moreover the lights don't move with the restaurant, so your lighting is constantly changing, at times dim, at other times blinding.  It is definitely a unique Vegas experience though.",

    "text": "First off, I am so sad to be leaving this review.  ****Tried reaching out the them VIA FACEBOOK, and they deleted my comment (multiple times) .They also blocked me on the page so I couldn't \"like\" or comment on anything they posted.   My husband and I were here two years ago, for a \"just cause\", and that was our reason last night (saturday, aug 24, 2013). A member of the staff walks around, and goes from table to table, and asks \"what are you celebrating?\"  Uh. Nothing, we just came to have dinner.... Does it have to be a \"special occasion\" to eat here? Jeez.  Lou A. Is the nicest server ! She was attentive, and between her and her busser \"team\" we only were low on water/essentials once. I started a drink order of a   \"summer mint margarita\" $(14)- Hornitos Reposado Tequila, cointreau, sweet&sour, Fresh mint & lime... My husband had a stella (bottled) and a shot of gold tequila. My margarita was pretty strong, and I took my time to finish it.. because I was getting...... loopy.  For appetizers, my husband ordered the  Iceberg Wedge with Nueske's Bacon & oven roasted tomato ($13)- White whine Dijon vinaigrette, Maytag Blue cheese and chopped chives. I had the beef carpaccio (forgive my spelling), with white truffle oil and crispy capers.  Both of our appetizers were so delicious, we couldn't wait for more. Me, feeling my margarita, reached for more bread, and that's when we ran into a problem. As shown in the picture, there was this long, straight black hair, BAKED INTO THE ROLL. Thank God I was tearing it, and eating it in pieces, or else I would have vomited.  I was trying to not make a scene, and flagged down someone who told me he would get the manager.... Waiting... Waiting... The manager goes to the wrong table and then gets to us. I tell him, and show him the hair...  He then inspects it, and asks if I would like more bread (uh, heck no) or if he could clear the bread...YES PLEASE.  I ordered the Colorado rack of lamb with Morcoccan Flavors  Seasonal chutney, tomato puree, quinoa tabbouleh, demi glace and minted greek yogurt. I ordered a side of Au Gratin potatoes (extra $10)  Husband ordered the surf and turf, with rib-eye and crab legs...    I'll post pictures of our receipt.   We both loved our meals. LOVED THEM. LOVED LOVED LOVED. My lamb was a little salty, and I didn't quite like the chutney, and the yogurt didn't go with the lamb... but it was the best lamb I had ever had, and the quinoa was, delicious, how quinoa should be.   The au gratin, though, looked bad on the plate. Like someone had just slapped it on there. It was suppose to be \"4 cheese\", but all I tasted was one flavor. There wasn't that crunchy top to the potatoes either.  For dessert, I ordered a chocolate duo, with came with pudding and fruit, and my husband ordered a scoop of raspberry sorbet. Yummy, but the sorbet was especially sugary.  Now, the part I've been waiting to see. Don't get me wrong... I don't look for comps normally, I don't complain for bad service, and rarely complain about food / drink. But a hair, is so disgusting.   Not a single discount.... not our drinks, not our $8 dollar dessert... Nothing. Almost like it was my fault for finding the \"oops\" roll. It was a great dinner, and we had fantastic service... But this was a True disappointment. I even feel bad for saying that I thought we should have some compensation... but it is something that I feel strongly about. I wasn't just complaining because I had nothing better to do.  Spend two hundred dollars on dinner, and have some hairy rolls.....",

We had a wonderful seat, was like a booth but facing windows, raised over the tables in front of us so we had a spectacular view!!!!!!!!  Wait staff was friendly, informative and accommodating.  We each had a lemon in coconut cocktail.  Was very good.  We each had salads Very large and perfectly put together.   Bread basket was full of variety and the choice of 3 different butters on the plate was an unexpected touch.  Groom had surf and turf. Lobster was cooked perfectly (we New Englanders know such things)  Filet Mignon was done perfectly as well.  Bride had the Ribeye. Horseradish crust.  We shared the pureed potatoes.  Ribeye was done perfectly, was a large steak and took half back to room with us.  Potatoes we shared and were sooooo good.  I had looked at reviews and noticed a lot of people complaining about the slow service.  If you are dining in a spinning restaurant that gives you a 360 degree view of Vegas that takes over an hour to go all the way around, did it ever occur to you that the slower service is there for your benefit, to get the whole 360 degree view?     I appreciated the whole experience and enjoyed sitting there taking in the view and lights, the food.    So I would suggest that if you go there and are in a hurry to leave....just let the wait staff know, I'm sure they can speed things up if needed.  Thank You to the wait staff at the Top of The World...for such a wonderful and memorable Wedding Dinner!",

While the view was spectacular and the staff was nice, the food was sub par and over priced.  We could have gotten the same meal at Montana Meat Company for a third of the price.   We don't mind paying a lot for a good meal but this experience made me feel that I had been taken.  Also when we got to the bottom of the elevator after dinner we had to walk through a creepy deserted  mall to get back to valet. Here is a tip, skip the restaurant and go to the cocktail lounge one level above.  You get the same great view.",

We had the three course meal and it was worth every penny.  We started off with a complimentary basket of delicious bread.  For the three course meal we had the lobster bisque, filet mignon, lobster tail with potatoes.  For the dessert we had the chocolate mousse and cream brulee.  We also ordered the ribeye steak with the poach egg.  I was skeptical of the blue cheese sauce because I usually don't like blue cheese but, how the sauce was prepared was incredibly good.  Overall we were both very happy with the dining experience, everything was perfect and tasted just right and the staff was friendly, professional and provided excellent customer service.  The coolest thing we encountered was seeing the skydivers jump from the restaurant view while the restaurant was slowly spinning.",

That was the best chocolate martini I've had in a long time.  The food was good and quality, we had good bread with 3 choices of butters (I liked the sweeter one).  We both ordered the seafood pasta, the pasta seemed fresh and cooked al dente and the quality of the seafood was good.  The shrimp were large and the lobster was in chunks and was the good pieces, not the claw meat that some places serve.  I did add some salt, a little of the sweet butter, and some parmesan cheese to spruce up the pasta from being somewhat bland.    I was too full to have dessert or I would have gotten something.  With our dinner purchase, we were also permitted to go to the top with our meal receipt and look out.  This was nice once it got later in the evening.  A very expensive meal but overall a great experience.",

The top two reasons I come here:  first, the view can't be beat and is romantic.   It is one of the best views of the city.  The second is the lobster bisque. It is probably my favorite.  The rest of the food is just as great and I have had their sea bass, lobster, and wagyu steaks.  With soup, main course and drinks we spend about $200.  You could easily spend more.  The only down side is there is no dress code and they allow small children.  On the plus side they are one of the few casinos not charging for parking.",

The restaurant is on level 106, rotating with an amazing 360 degree view of Las Vegas.  Our server was really good and helpful. You start with a basket of bread fresh baked and hot so delicious in addition to three different butter flavors : I really recommend the butter with orange one of a kind.  For the dinner everyone tried something different: steak, fish, caesar salad, scallop, crab cake : presentation is amazing and the taste is delicious !!  At the end I got free delicious chocolate cake for my birthday ! It was one of the best chocolate cake I ever had! I really recommend their desserts. Tips: After the restaurant u can go for free to the deck on level 107-108 and enjoy an amazing outdoor view of las Vegas !!",

    "text": "We celebrated with my husband's sister, boyfriend and all her friends when the Tough Mudder was in town. I just pretended it was my birthday meal since it was the next day anyway.   They had a special four course menu going on that I was tempted to get because I really wanted steak. My sister in law said I could try some of hers so I opted to get the Seafood Alfredo with Shrimp Cocktail for my appetizer. When I had sampling of steak from my sister in law I wasn't impressed. It was tough and had no taste. I was so glad I went with the Alfredo after some I freshly squeezed lemon on top of it was delightful! The shrimp cocktail was a disappointment because it wasn't made traditionally. It had guacamole in it. I figured if I wanted it Mexican style I would have opted it to be in a ceviche instead.   This is a beautiful restaurant but what made me sad was every person at our table about 8 of us all got our meal and was done before they delivered my husband's steak. I know my husband always wants his steaks well done but I think they should have timed the dishes better so we could have eaten together. Everyone was offering him food off their plates. The waiter blamed it on the cooking time of the steak and didn't really offer any sorry for how late the food was. In the future it would be nice if the dishes were timed accordingly.",

I don't think there are any bad views to be honest. The service was great! The food was yummy. I had a lobster pasta dish with a house salad, and the hubby had the chicken with potatoes. The prices are high, but keep in mind you are paying for ambiance as well, which you can't beat. We got to see people jumping off the top of the Stratosphere which was so awesome (bungee of course).   The evening was so perfect. We had renewed our vows across the street at The Little Vegas Chapel, then walked over and up to the The Top of the World. We were staying in the Stratosphere so it was all easy and convenient. Had a terrific memorable time!",

We got the window seat that I requested so I was super happy with that.  The food - I had lobster bisque and crab cake. Both were good. DH had the surf and turf - lobster was perfectly cooked, filet mignon was a little chewy and overcooked for a medium rare.  I came here for the view and the ambiance, so I didn't have very high expectations on food.  Yes, it's pricey, but not any pricier than many fine dining establishments that serve sub-par food.",

Well salty, a bit burnt tasting, lobster was poor quality and they served it into the bowls with metallic pitchers which is a complete no no and gave it a metal taste as well.  Salad was the next coarse with a non existent vinaigrette  but was edible.  Next coarse was a 10 oz filet.  Note to cook season you damn meat before cooking.  This was bland and had no flavor.  The potatoes were over seasoned.  Glad I didn't pay for this cause I sent all but the salad back.  Also to be noted that looking around at others and multiple tables.  They also didn't touch the soup only a few ate it and a lot of people didn't eat their filet either.  Who doesn't eat a filet.  Everyone if the chef has lost their ambition.  What a waste of product.  Please get yourself a chef that has creativity and a zest for good food.  Others there said they wouldn't give it to their pets and that wasn't even me cause I don't have one.  Shame shame on you Top of the World. Shame",

I am so glad we did. Hands down best meal I've ever had in my life. We ordered the 4 course for $106 and literally every course was so flavorful and delicious. Perfect is not an oversell. The lobster bisque, amazing. The crab cake, amazing. More crab then cake, which is what you want. The filet mignon, amazing. So tender, cooked perfectly, creamy mashed potatoes. Melt in your mouth. By the time dessert rolled around, I was stuffed but 100% certain I had to force it down if it was anything like the previous 3 courses. And guess what, salted caramel creme brulee, amazing. We left stuffed, completely satisfied, and happy to have spent the money we spent because it was well worth it. The view was awesome too.",

    "text": "Worthy of 2.5 stars. I ordered a 16oz. medium prime ribeye with horseradish crust and demi-glace, along with a twice-baked potato. The steak was overcooked -- it was medium well with a barely pink center. I explained to the server that the steak was overcooked and cut the steak through the thickest center portion to show him at which point he asked me to explain what I would like him to convey to the Chef. I was flabbergasted and asked that he simply explain that I ordered my steak medium and that this steak was medium well and tough. He took the steak away (leaving my untouched potato to cool by itself) and returned a minute later to ask if I would like to take this opportunity to order a different cut of meat, a filet mignon perhaps. I simply stated that I did not want another type of steak and would prefer what I originally ordered, properly cooked. The question in and of itself insinuated to me that I did not understand the differences between various cuts of meat and that if I didn't like my perfectly (over)cooked ribeye, perhaps I should order a more tender cut of beef -- in essence attempting to shift the blame to me...WOW, that's class. When I pointed out my lonely potato, he acted as though it was his intent to replace it from the get go. The replacement steak was alright. The twice cooked potato was nothing special. Overall, for two dinners, four glasses of wine, and 3 mini deserts, $220.00 bucks, including a 15% tip was a little steep for a table with a view.  Chef Gordon Ramsey suggests that if you see anything on a menu containing white truffle oil, run the other way. I should have known better when I noticed the ricotta gnocchi \"mac and cheese\" and white truffle oil listed under sides...",

    "text": "My wife and I decided to choose this restaurant for our one year anniversary dinner and we definitely made a great choice! We were a little nervous about how most people say that restaurants with a great view usually don't have food to match the view, but this restaurant is not the case. Best view in Vegas and delicious food to go along with it.  We had 7:30 reservations on a Saturday night and were promptly seated when we arrived. The restaurant looked pretty busy but our server (David) was very attentive to all our needs throughout the evening.   The meal started off with a few cocktails, a great wine suggestion from our server, and a delicious assortment of breads and butters. I'd highly recommend the garlic butter. For appetizers the wife got the Ahi Tuna and I enjoyed the Lobster bisque. Both were great choices. The Bisque could have been a tad hotter but the flavor, seasoning, and amount of lobster were all phenomenal. The Tuna was seared rare and was extremely tasty.   For our meals I had the surf and turf with mashed potatoes. Everything was cooked perfectly and tasted better than I could have imagined. You can't go wrong with their fillet or their lobster, but together it's to die for.  I'd highly recommend this dish. The wife also had a fillet with a side of mash and was raving about it the whole meal.   By the end of our entrees, we were way too stuffed to even attempt a dessert but we saw plenty of desserts come out of the kitchen that looked amazing. The table next to us was only there for dessert and it looked like they ordered every one on the menu. We heard lots of oooo's and ahhhhh's!   Overall, we give this restaurant a 4.5 with the only deduction for the price of a jack + coke ($11). If I'm drinking an $11 jack + coke, it better be a stiff drink :-)",

Of course, the prices were on the high side, but nothing unusual for this caliber of a restaurant. Being on top of the Stratosphere tower and slowly spinning, taking in the wonderful views of the mountains and the strip was breathtaking and extremely romantic!  I ordered filet mignon and it was delicious! I like medium rare and it was done exactly to my liking. The salad and eggplant appetizers were also out of this world. I liked the small portions. They were not \"tiny\" but rather very reasonable. No oversized portions here! But, I don't like humongous plates anyway, I like good food and great atmosphere and that's what I got at Top of the World.  Our next anniversary dining establishment will have a hard time measuring up to Stratosphere's Top of the World.  P.S. I would recommend dining here at dusk, that way, you will see the sun go down and will enjoy the views of Vegas at night.",

Was told there was a 45 minute wait for lunch. Fine, we will wait. We ask to go to the bar and were told that the main bar was closed till four. We ask about the other bar one level above the restaurant. The woman then starts ranting and raving, not making any sense. Kept throwing around $16, $16. Our party of four had no idea what she was saying. This went on for like ten minutes, not kidding. It was very odd. We had no intention of trying to get to the top for \"free\" and I think that was her concern. She barely spoke English and not us or another group standing there could make heads or tails of what she was saying. She then says \"yes, you can go to bar upstairs before lunch\". I guess you had to be there, but we were like OMG. Laughed about it all the way up.   Had a drink at the bar, very nice bartender there. Waited the 45 minutes for a table.  Waited and waited for an elevator. should have taken the stairs but someone said the door would be locked.   Had a nice table with a nice view.  One woman took our drink orders. Great. Another took our meal order.  Hubbie and I each wanted a bowl of lobster bisque soup and then we were going to split a burger. Hubbie likes his medium rare, me, I like medium but will eat medium rare.  Waitress comes out with hubbie's soup and walks away.  We are kinda laughing now, as this is just getting funny.  Call the waitress and explain I should have gotten a bowl of soup also and she just give me a look and says \"no, it is your entree\". We again explain splitting the burger, etc. All is good.   Until the entree's are served. Our friends each got a salad which were huge and really good.  But our burger is raw, not rare, not medium rare, but pure and simple raw hamburger meat. We were going to send it back, but between not seeing a wait person anywhere and questioning what they would do, not that this would be our second situation, hubbie decided to eat what he could. I had nothing but the soup and bread. No one ever came to inquire about the food. No one ever took another drink order even though our glasses had been empty since we got the soup, etc. Not quire sure how they can even serve food like that. Aren't there some health guidelines about raw meat unless it is tar-tare?  All is still good, we are in Vegas and  that trumps all.  I still wasn't going to say a word, simply not worth it. hubbie is getting ready to do the jump off Strat so that is all we were talking about anyway,  Deserts were offered and declined and the bill put on the table. Now, I never check a bill, I just let hubbie handle it, so it was weird I picked it up to look at it.  I notice we were charged a $6 or $8 meal split.  When the waitress came over to take our payment, I questioned her on that and that she probably should have pointed it out when we ordered. NOW, if she would have been like \"oh, sorry, it is on the menu\" or something like that, I would have shrugged it off and paid the bill. Still would have been left with a bad feeling about the whole thing, but instead she was like \"what do you want me to do about it? It is right there on the menu\". When I questioned her if perhaps she should point it out when people split a meal, wouldn't that be better for everyone all around. She pretty much responded with \"you should have read the menu\".  All said with a smirk and in broken English. NOW, I was pissed.  Laughed at the check in woman, laughed at the elevator situation (although whose fault that is, is anyone's guess) laughed at the non existent service, laughed at being served raw meat, but mock me and be openly rude to me, that quite possible was my breaking point, and I asked to speak to a manager.   An Assistant Manager did come to talk with us. We tried telling him the whole story, but he was stuck on the check in woman and kept coming back to that  and how people try to avoid that $16 charge all the time. Oh lord, again with the $16 charge. In all fairness, he did take off all the food charges and we only paid for our one drink each, but the whole thing left a bad taste in my mouth. And we did tip on the original bill.  In full disclosure, the four of us are big foodies. The Top of the World at Stratosphere tries very hard to compete with the Eiffel Tower at Paris and does not compare. We ate a special anniversary dinner there the night before. The restaurant manager emailed me, set up reservations, set up a special table by the windows with red plates and rose petals all over the table and special comped deserts. We were very impressed and I highly recommend that restaurant to everyone. We dropped over $400 there just the night previous.  Maybe they are better prepared at dinner. That is when we have eaten there before.  Just be aware of what can happen during lunch.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I spent a romantic night at the Stratosphere and wanted a nice place to have lunch, thus we came here. Best decision of the weekend! We ordered one of their 3-course lunch options, which may sound like a lot but each course was perfectly portioned, a rarity in today's restaurants that love to overfeed (and over charge) you. The first course was their Lobster Bisque. When it arrived, we were given bowls with elegantly piled lobster meat, and no soup. Very confusing at first- until the waiter ever so carefully poured in the soup mixture! Quite the presentation! And what a delicious soup! I loved it from the first sip to the last bits I could coax into my spoon! Then came the entree- a petite steak on a portobello mushroom in a delicious sauce with whipped mashed potatoes on the side. The steak/portobello mushroom combination was wonderful! I am not a fan of mushrooms for textural reasons- but this combination was too good to not enjoy! And the creaminess of the mashed potatoes made them a pleasure to savor! Then came dessert- again, another wonderful presentation! The rectangular plate had 3 small desserts- a bread pudding with a creamy caramel sauce and cooked banana piece on top, a chocolate turtle mini cake with chocolate mousse layered with caramel and pecans, and lastly a raspberry creme dessert. The raspberry dessert was my favorite- such a wonderful blend of sweet and tart!  Of course, you cannot talk about this restaurant without talking about the view- and WHAT A VIEW!!! The restaurant spins, so you get a wonderful view of the whole area! Luckily, it spins at a very slow pace, so don't worry about getting motion sick :P",

Everything is a la carte with a minimum purchase per person so don't expect to save money on your kids tower passes because you are taking them to dinner.  Be careful of the water, it comes in a nice looking decorated glass bottle without any mention of price. It will set you back $12 per bottle.  The only real plus to going to dinner here is to dodge the line for the tower site seeing. If you are willing to pay top dollar for average food at least it gets you vip line treatment and puts 45 minutes back in your life.",

Our waiter was very polite.  ONE tiny complaint, or thing that my lover and I thought was strange, was a lady came around and took our pictures...towards the end of the meal she came back and showed them to us, offering them for sale.  We very politely declined and she literally went silent, face turned into a frown and stormed off.  Lover and I kind of looked at each other and giggled...\"is she serious?\"  Sorry, Miss!  It was like she spent $80 of her own money to print these pictures for us when we never said we wanted to buy the darn things.  I'm sure she's just a 3rd party vendor, but sheesh!  Don't take it personal, sister.  I had the lobster bisque--amazeballs.  We went out on the deck afterwards and took pictures.",

    "text": "I will NOT recommend this restaurant to anyone due to poor customer service. We made our reservations and arrived early. We waited patiently as the Hostess stated it would be 10 minutes longer than our reservation time since they had to clear off tables and wait for people to pay their bills. WE watched as they set 5 different groups ahead of us that had the same reservation time we did and only 2 of the groups were waiting at the same time as we were.   We were finally seated for dinner. The waiter brought over our water and said he would be right back. The waiter then proceeded to wait on the people that were seated after we were seated. The waiter introduced himself to their table and telling about the other server working with that evening. That was the final insult.  I was willing to spend my money and time in their restaurant and to be treated poorly by the Hostess and wait staff was unacceptable. The feeling by the staff that were condescending toward us and were doing us a favor to be there. Customer service was POOR and when shared that with other employees at the Stratosphere they were not surprised.   I will let others know when  traveling to Las Vegas not to dine there. My company and different associations hold their conferences there at least three times a year and will share this with them. I would have given them no stars but wasn't able to post unless I gave them one star.   I will recommend TJ's Steakhouse and Benihana at Las Vegas Hilton where they appreciated our money and provided TERRIFIC customer service.",

We shared a desert shaped like the tower called the chocolate stratosphere. The food was good but the view was even better. We were 108 stories up and the restaurant would rotate 360 within 1 hr. We were able to get a window table and the view was just incredible.   After dinner we walked one floor up to the romance lounge where they had a piano and played live jazz music. The interior was velvet red and the lighting was very dim. I remember mostly candles being lit in the bar that night. It had a very romantic setting to have a few drinks and listen to some live jazz music and just lounge. We really enjoyed ourselves that night.",

The scallops were bitter, the lobster had little to no flavor, but the shrimp (all two of them) were very good.  My wife had the salmon which I tasted and it was dry and hopelessly mediocre. If you really want to eat here, get a burger on the observation deck for a fraction of the cost and enjoy the view and food that way.",

    "text": "I went here just yesterday for dinner to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday. For a quick summary, here are my thoughts: -View: 5 stars. -Ambience: 3 stars -Service/Wait Time: 3 stars -Food: 3 stars  And for more in-depth explanation:  View: It's a view 800ft above the ground overlooking the strip. And it rotates. It is just as amazing and breathtaking as you would expect. We requested a seat by the giant floor to ceiling windows, which made it even better. We also saw 5 different people jump  for the Stratosphere sky jump, which was great fun to watch. If you want to go somewhere with a great view, this can't be beat.  Ambience: Despite the gorgeous view, the restaurant's ambience was lacking. The decor (table setting, furniture, lighting) appeared very outdated and did not give a sense of elegance. The lighting was especially weak. It did not give the kind of ambience that so many restaurants in LA give. If you take away the amazing view and just look at the restaurant in general, I guarantee anyone would be severely disappointed. In addition, the restaurant's website said the business casual dress code was \"strictly enforced\", yet I saw people wearing shorts, flip-flops and tank tops. My boyfriend and I got dressed up for the night and wanted to go somewhere fancy. I think it just really kills the mood and feeling of extravagance when you look behind you and some guy is in a wife beater.  Service: We got there at exactly 6:30pm (our reservation time) and was seated right away. However, the hostess brought us to a table that wasn't right next to the window, so we asked to be moved. She said it would be a 20 minute wait, which we agreed to. During the wait, we went upstairs to the bar/lounge area, which was nice. It wasn't busy at all but it happened to be Happy Hour and we got a 2-for-1 deal on a delicious margarita (some type of orange flavor with pop rocks!). Anyways, we waited for a while and enjoyed the view from the lounge, but then 20 minutes became 30 which then became 40! We finally went back down and they apologized for the long wait and led us to a window table right away. Our waiter was friendly and helpful - not exemplary but certainly not bad. However, our food took another 40 MINUTES to prepare!! I definitely did not expect that long of a wait and was severely disappointed at that (especially because the restaurant was not busy AT ALL. I saw at least 4 empty tables around ours). Overall, the service was fine but the wait time (especially on a slow night) was awful. However, keep in mind that we went there with a $25 gift certificate, which might have affected our service? If so, that is pretty dishonorable.   Food: The complimentary bread/butter they gave was delicious. They give you a plate of three different kinds of butter (regular, garlic, and marmalade) which was awesome and was actually my favorite food of the night (whether that' s a good or bad thing - you decide).  My boyfriend had the 10oz. USDA Choice Filet with Red Wine Mushroom Sauce for $53. The portion was quite small and all he had was literally the piece of steak and that was it. No vegetables or anything. The steak itself was good (I had a piece) - tender and juicy. However, it is nowhere near the best steak I've ever eaten and, in my opinion, not worth the price AT ALL! Lala's Argentine Grill in West Hollywood, CA has significantly better steaks for around $20.  I had the Fettuccine Seafood Alfredo with Lobster, Prawns and Scallops or $40. It was ONLY OKAY. Honestly, I've had better pasta at casual restaurants like CPK and BJ's for around $20 (Baby Clam Linguini with lemon cream sauce at CPK or the Spaghettini with Fresh Clams at the Grand Lux Cafe in the Palazzo are significantly better). The sauce was not creamy and actually kind of cold right at the start. Some of the pasta was even hard/undercooked. However, the prawns and scallops were a hearty size and cooked very well. My plate only had one piece of lobster though, and that was dry and almost tasteless.  So, overall, if you want to go for the view - DO IT, because the view is amazing. However, I felt the food was NOT WORTH THE PRICE at all and really regret going there. If you have the money to spend, do it. Otherwise, tell them you just want to go up to the Lounge, not the restaurant. You'll still get to go up the tower and see the view and if it's Happy Hour,you get 2-for-1 martinis! Then, take the money you save and go to the RIO seafood buffet and eat to your heart's content.",

The only thing saving me from giving this place 1 star is the view of the strip (that comes around every 15-20 mins or so) which is actually very pretty.  The food, on the other hand, is nothing at all spectacular considering the prices that  you pay.  My husband & I shared the lobster mashed potatoes & to be absolutely honest, it looked like mashed potatoes topped with vomit & it didn't taste all that great either.  The rack of lamb that I had tasted gamey & the port reduction that came with it was actually kind of hard for me to stomach.  My husband had the salmon & that looked like something I throw together when I don't feel like making dinner.  Yeah, not worth the $40 price tag.  I could get the same size piece of fish for $5 & make it taste 100x better.  Best thing of the night?  The mojito I had & the Grey Goose screwdriver my husband had.  Can't ever go wrong with the booze =]",

Even though I went for lunch, it's important to make reservations. Lunch is more casual than dinner. The view from Top of the World Restaurant is truly amazing. One of the best views you can get while eating lunch or dinner. Definitely the best view I've experienced while eating. The restaurant turns while you are eating, you get a full view of Las Vegas. Before I ordered my lunch, one of the employees took some photos of me. The lady taking the photos really does a great job having you pose for pictures. She has you take different poses with different background views as the restaurant turns. The lady was really nice and down to earth.I ended up buying the photos after lunch for the memories. It's hard to focus on ordering food with such a nice view of LasVegas. For lunch, I ordered the crab cake appetitzers.The crab cake appetizer were delicious. The crab cakes were full of crab meat. I also ordered the Cajun fried chicken sandwhich. The Cajun fried chicken sandwich consisted of cabbage slaw, sriracha aioli , and ciabatta bread.To my surprise, the sandwich was delicious. Top of the World Restaurant food quality compliment the nice view of the restaurant. The service at Top of the World Restaurant was great. The waitress was very attentive. Top of the World Restaurant has a nice romantic atmosphere. If you want a romantic restaurant in Las Vegas, look no further. I recommend Top of the World Restaurant for the view of Las Vegas and the delicious food.",

Our waiter was very friendly. Then it goes south from there... We ordered the cold seafood appetizer with extra shrimp instead of oysters. When it arrived there was half of a crab leg already split, large shrimp and both tuna and salmon poke however since both pokes were in the same cup the flavors blended so they should have just stirred it at that point. The salmon was definitely the fresher of the two. For almost $60, you may expect an appetizer to be shareable, well, don't! Moving on to the salad, the wedge had nice flavor and the bacon was a thick cut. An hour and a half after ordering, our steaks came (we knew it was that long because we had already done a full rotation which takes an hour and 20 minutes.) We ordered two steaks, both New York strips which were nice in size. The first was to be a medium well with peppercorn sauce... What came out was a piece of well done with sauce dried to the plate in places. The carrot garnishes were soggy and wrinkly on one side and undercooked on the other. The second was to be a medium rare with a red wine and mushroom sauce...what came out was a medium well steak with the same under impressive carrots. The shared side was to be cheesy au gratin potatoes which came out looking like burnt thanksgiving left overs. We did not have time to have new steaks or sides prepared. The waiter was apologetic and had them removed from the bill which he should have since we did not eat them. However he made it seem like he was doing us the greatest favor. We were staying at the hotel and we loved the stay otherwise. Really disappointing.  If yelp had half stars, that would still be too generous of a rating.",

We asked the waiter to take a picture and he sent over a high priced mediocre photographer.  The soup was delicious and served with a nice basket of breads. The meals were beautifully presented.  The steak was absolutely delicious.  We waited for the potatoes which never came.  The lobster was overcooked and tough.  The chocolate dessert was yummy.  Dinner was enjoyable.  The views are amazing.  All in all, mostly hits with a couple of misses.",

    "text": "They have a pretty good view and their food is not bad.  With so many good places to eat in Vegas, it's hard to argue for this place.  Though the view is nice, I wish their food quality was just a bit better to make it all the more enjoyable.  -soup of the day:  This was a potato soup, it was pretty tasty and I thought there would be a sliced filet topping, I didn't see it =T -pork belly app:  After having those roasted brussel sprouts, nothing can compare.  The pork belly was okay but it'd be a lot better if they had braised the belly and then seared the skin to a crisp.  It was delicious because it was a pork belly but it tasted just like a boiled bork belly on top of sliced brussel sprouts. -gnocchi:  This was okay, not the best I've had but the flavor was fine.  I'd order something else. -filet with wine reduction:  The temperature of the steak was a bit more cooked than I asked for.  Otherwise, it was pretty standard. -crabcake:  Nice lump crabcake.  Not too much mayo, just the way I like it =) -foie gras:  Since it's banned in Los Angeles, how could I say no for an extra $12???  Easy, n.o. T_T  It wasn't supple and melty-in-mouthy-like.  I don't think it was cleaned correctly because it was kind of gritty in some parts and not very tasty =T  The staff was extremely nice though.  I just wish the hotel let me extend late checkout for a bit more so that I could finish my meal without rushing since the food was coming out slower than I thought it would.  Oh wellz, you can't win them all =T",

I really enjoyed our meal here.  My husband and I both choose the premiere tasting menu ($36).  We both enjoyed salads as starters instead of the lobster bisque.  The salad was delicious. Light, flavorful, crisp, and well portioned.  For our second course I opt for the steak and crab cakes; my husband gets the steak with the lobster tail.  We really enjoyed the crab cakes and lobster, but our steak was not cooked to our liking.  We both ordered them 'medium', and got them at medium-well.  And they're pretty tricky by sitting it on top of a mini portabella...making me think I have more meat than I really do.  Lastly the dessert.  Excellent array of raspberry mousse, bread pudding, and chocolate cake.  The service at Top of the World was excellent.  One thing I found amusing was our host had under his name: Compton Hills, CA (all employees have a notation of where they're from).  Compton Hills, CA.....highly suspect. Haha.  The view is spectacular, and the food is good.  I wouldn't put it on my list of 'must-haves' in Vegas, but maybe 'must try at least once'.",

Service was impeccable, we were greeted by the owner, who thanked us for coming to his restaurant, and the food was delicious and well presented.   The reason to come here is obviously for the rotating 360 degree view of Las Vegas.  The prices are very high end, but you are paying more for the atmosphere and less for the actual food itself (although it was really delicious and cooked to our liking).  There is also a second level lounge and live music (not sure if they do that every night or just on weekends).   We were wearing our wedding dress and suit and clearly enjoying a fabulous wedding dinner. the staff was super friendly and complimentary, although i kind of thought they might throw us a freebie, but who am i kidding, nothing is free in Vegas!  Beware of the really nice photographer lady, if you are swept away by the ambiance, you might get sucked into buying one of her photos, which will be one million dollars.    The elevator staff was very knowledgeable, and without their guidance i would have never been able to navigate the place. they also have a bit of trivia and facts for you.  fun!   Best night of my life! if you are in vegas, you should eat here (do it on someone else's dime if you can!)",

I've been twice now, and was just as impressed as I was the first time. It's spectacular! Really breathtaking, and it will guarantee you'll have a memorable visit.  Pleasantly surprised that the menu identifies gluten free options, and they have a great wine selection too.  As well as the restaurant on 106, they have a bar on 107 (happy hour means half price cocktails from 4pm to 7pm daily). The bar doesn't revolve, but you still get a good view, so if you're on a budget, go for a drink, or you could come up for lunch instead.  BTW, on floor 112 you can get outside for the viewing gallery, where you can walk around the outside of the tower, as well as watch the nutters doing the rides. But it's $18 for a ticket just get up here, so you might as well go to the bar instead, get a couple of happy hour drinks then once inside you can take the internal elevators up to the viewing gallery.",

Totally made reservations via Yelp and OpenTable & even better: got a good deal with <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a>!!   We had just finished doing the XScream & Insanity rides atop the Stratosphere, so the view did not bother us at all. Plus, we're used to the rotating restaurant theme because of the Top of Waikiki restaurant here at home!   First of all, we had originally planned on going back to our hotel to change for dinner, but we stayed at the Luxor and that would've been an hour or so situation - so we chanced it and went in our casual attire (tank and denim skirt for me, T shirt and cargo shorts for him) - we were told that they had just changed their dress code policy to where men have to wear collared shirts, but they had extra ones in the back. So they brought out a huge mustardy colored shirt - it looked like it was a doorman's shirt from the hotel. It was a little big, but the color wasn't so bad on him.   Anyway, we got seated and our waitress Ellen, was the best! Right from the get-go, she was very nice and friendly - we never felt out of place, despite our wardrobe. Her assistant (I feel so bad, I can't remember his name), was very nice also. I believe my BF ordered the Prime Rib and I got the Seafood Fettuccine Alfredo. We were also served a bread basket with 3 different butters - the breads were soo delicious! It included sourdough, flat bread, and a cheddar cheese bread - we ate so much of it!!   My alfredo was very good - it had shrimp, scallops, and lobster. I'm glad that the fettuccine noodles were green, it made my dish look so much more appetizing than having plain white/yellow noodles! My BF enjoyed his prime rib, and I did have a taste - it was good!! We were too stuffed for dessert, but from what I saw - it didn't look that good.   You are able to see people doing the jump over the Stratosphere (they whiz by really fast), and you can also see the front of the XScream dip down during your meal - some people seemed a little stressed to see all of that, but it didn't bother us! I'm sure a meal here would be soo much better and romantic after the sun goes down and all of the lights from the hotels are in full effect, but we still enjoyed our dinner.",

The service begins in the elevator with a friendly elevator man, and once the doors open, the feel of the restaurant is luxurious. All the employees are smiling, and they greet you as you are guided to your table. This restaurant rotates 360 degrees in an hour so you don't miss anything (assuming you will be eating for at least an hour.) Water is always filled, and the waitress is there for anything you may need throughout your meal.  Plus dining with the view of Vegas? Amazing.  The food is great. Ordered duck breast and sea bass (my fav!). You can taste the quality of the dish and its not too salty (thank goodness).  The reason why I gave 4 stars is because its a hefty price for the amount of food you get. Fancy places are usually smaller proportions and pricey, but this place wasn't filling enough for the price. I personally was full because I scarfed down 2 pieces of complimentary bread  before even getting our entrees, but my family wasn't satisfied with how full they were. Everything else was great though! I highly recommend this place for a nice date, or a fancy family dinner.",

We wanted our friends to have an unforgettable dining experience so I booked reservations for an 8PM dining via Open Table back in March. This was my post ceremony celebration so of course I wanted everything to go smoothly. Unfortunately that did not happen. Please keep in the mind the 1 star is a reflection of the treatment my party and I received prior to being seated. The food, the view, and our server Brian was amazing!   We were finishing up our photo shoot on the strip when we arrived about 8:10PM to my party sitting in a small corner across from the hostess desk. I asked them why weren't they seated and was informed by one of my friends that our reservation was for 9pm. Ummm no it's not. It has always been 8PM. I go to the desk and the African-American hostess with brownish hair RUDELY says your reservation is for 9pm you have to wait and pointed us back to the corner. #1 You DO NOT speak to anyone that way, #2 NO ONE PUTS ME IN A CORNER! I explained to her that our reservations were confirmed today and have always been 8pm. She rolls her eyes and the Caucasian hostess with jet black hair next to her gives me dirty looks. At this point I ask for their manager to find out who changed my reservation and why. The manager arrives and says that our table is ready and we were able to be seated (so why were thing 1 and thing 2 giving my group such a hard time?) and he said employee #151 messed up the reservations in Open Table.   Just based on that treatment alone, I do not recommend anyone to dine here. The elevator attendants and hostess all hate their jobs and it shows. You are the first impression of the restaurant and this is what people get? Unacceptable! They need to fire them all and get some fresh, happy faces in there.",

We did the tasting menu which was a great section of food and of course a bottle of wine. Got to see a few jumpers fall from the sky fall which was neat something you couldn't pay me to do.  Went at 6pm which was perfect as we got to see the sun set. Overall it was a nice experience and evening out",

The rotating restaurant lets you view not only the city, but far off into the hills (which I always thought made a better view than the buildings).  Getting up was pretty easy, and it's a great way to bypass the crowds who just want to see the observation deck.  By the time people had gone through the line for the floor above me, I was already chowing down.  The food is decent.  It's not bad, but given the price and atmosphere, I expect some pretty good food.  Fifty bucks for a mediocre meal seems like a lot, but then I'm paying for the view, not the food.",

The waiter offered to have sliced chicken on top of pasta, like chicken alfredo, with less chicken than the original meal but added pasta. I thought it would increase the price a little but it went from $37 to $49! For not that much more food. Service was good. A little on the stiff side for some of the staff, but our waiter was very nice. We skipped dessert because we were so full but they looked good. Overall, a nice experience with the rotating view but not sure it was worthy of the price.",

The location: It is beautiful. I was upset we didn't a next to the window seat like I had requested when I made our reservations, they said it would be another 45 minute wait. We didn't want to wait that long, and they seat we got was not that bad.  The service: Service was pretty good. Didn't have to ask for much.  The food: This is where my rating comes from.  The complimentary bread, I wasn't a fan. It was hard; didn't like it at all. We had the scallops for appetizer. It was decent, but nothing to write home about. My husband ordered the filet mignon, it was delicious and flavorful.   My seafood alfredo was not worth the $59 we paid. The noodles were not done enough and it was very bland. I have better at Red Lobster for less than a third of the price.  I would give them another chance, but I won't be getting the pasta.",

    "text": "Although I didn't give this restaurant high marks (see the reason why if you skip to the final paragraph below), I do think it is worth mentioning that the top of the world restaurant has the absolute best views in Las Vegas. You get to see all of Las Vegas from the top of the Stratosphere, as the restaurant slowly turns 360 degrees every 80 minutes. However, you can accomplish this by visiting their bar, versus paying for an expensive meal. I've been to this restaurant several times and always enjoyed the staff and the views. Although they do have good food, I have had much better meals at many other famous restaurants in Vegas, including Gordon Ramsay's Steak restaurant in The Paris hotel (it would be difficult to find better food than Ramsay's).   Unfortunately, my most recent trip to the top of the world restaurant was the most disappointing experience I've ever had at a fine dining establishment. This is particularly disappointing because we actually canceled another reservation at a five-star restaurant to return to the top of the world. It was our anniversary.   I understand this is a dining \"experience\", and you can't expect to eat here without spending at least an hour and a half.  However, I told our waiter we had plans at 8:30pm (we arrived at 6:15 PM).   We chose the \"chef selection menu\", which included three courses. Again, this is good food but there was nothing special or creative about the menu (soup/salad, scallops, steak). We received our first course and wine very quickly/within 20 minutes of sitting down. The second course came about 25-30 minutes later. The final course took over 45 minutes and we had to ask for it three times!  Each time, the waiter told us \"it would be right up\".  On the final/3rd time, I asked to see the Manager. This is where it gets interesting.  Someone who called himself the Manager came out and told us how busy the kitchen was. I understand that kitchens are busy in Las Vegas, especially on Saturday nights. He didn't offer to comp a portion of our meal or even pay for our dessert. This is not something I would ever expect from a casual dining restaurant. However, when I am spending $450 on a meal (and I am a returning customer who has referred many friends), I expect great service.  The \"Manager\" also laughed when I told him we were running late to meet our friends, and said \"you should have your friends come here\".  I didn't appreciate the flippant response when I was hoping for an apology. So, I asked to see the General Manager.  Someone claiming to be the general manager (although he never offered his name and I found a different general manager listed under social media sites) came over with a very bad attitude and explained that the kitchen was running behind. I told him about the comment from the manager, and explained how much I love this restaurant (and have referred many friends) but that we were a little disappointed that we had waited over an hour at this point for our final course. He didn't offer to take care of us at all. In fact, he seemed frustrated that he had to come speak with me. Again, he didn't offer to resolve the situation nor did he apologize. When I suggested that he refund my entree, he became very defensive. He then proceeded to explain that he had worked at dozens of high-end restaurants and that this is the third best restaurant in Las Vegas. If that is True, it's definitely because of the views and not the service.  Anyway, I explained to the \"general manager\" that I had such beautiful memories at this place and would continue to spend money there and refer friends / business colleagues if he was willing to do the right thing. He said \"I don't appreciate being threatened\" and he proceeded to walk away from the conversation!   I cannot believe the unprofessional way he handled the situation. For the cost of a $100 meal/course, he has lost my business, my friends and family's business, and I will be honest about this experience on social media so other patrons don't experience the same thing.   If you're going to spend this kind of money, go someplace else for dinner!  Another interesting note: I was upset on the way down the elevator after leaving this restaurant. There was another employee, whom I won't mention, in the elevator with us. I told her about my bad experience with the general manager and she said \"I have had to ride in the elevator with him before, and I'm not surprised he acted that way\".",

At the 30 min mark we got our free bread. Another 20 mins pass, and our waiter comes to get our drink orders.  15 mins again, we get our orders taken. I order a soup of the day and a ribeye med rare, and my wife gets the 4 course meal. 20 mins later, we get our soup. 20 mins later we get the 2nd course. By this time i'm eating my wife's food. Main course comes out right around the 2 hour mark. By this time we had passed the strip twice.   The rib eye was good, the soup was aight. The wife's food was not all that. The picture taken by the waiter was horrible, the long island iced tea i ordered costed more than their specialty cocktails. Then the bill comes: they charge me for the lobster bisque and include the cheaper soup in the 4 course meal.   The 2 stars is for the food and the view. The wait time sucked and they didnt seem to be apologetic at all. We lost so much mojo waiting for our main course and barely consumed half of it, as our appetites were gone by then. We finally got out of there at 10:15pm, and that's not because we were having such an awesome time. Never going back.",

The revolving can be a little disorienting at first but the longer you sit there it's just incredible to see the city. We started with the Caesar salad, followed by the kurobuta pork belly-amazzzzzing!! Next course we had the Chilean Sea Bass which crazy ridiculous-definitely order this! Our last course was the 16oz Ribeye with the red wine mushroom sauce. It takes about 120 mins to revolve all the way around, but with great food and company the time flys by. 10/10 recommend for anyone wanting to have a nice romantic dinner or just wanting to enjoy an incredible view.",

We went for lunch as a quick meal after arriving in town that also afforded us a worthwhile experience since it was my birthday weeekend.  We both had the chicken sandwich, which was delicious! We devoured it (we were also hungry) but enjoyed it. The service was very attentive and friendly; we never wanted for anything. My one caveat is that the prices are really not coinciding with the food you get; you are really paying for the view and the experience as the food is rather overpriced for what you get compared to most of the nicer restaurants on the strip. That being said, we were glad we were able to order off the lunch specials menu instead of the dinner menu. I would recommend dining here at least once but make it a special occasion!",

The service is perfect, they have you go through a detector before taking you up to the restaurant, and the staff is always all smiles. I recommend making a reservation before going. If there is a wait, you could chill at their lounge and they'll call you when your table is ready. Once you are about to be seated, they lead you to your table which is set on a rotating floor that slowly moves around the top of the Stratosphere. You can't really feel yourself moving once youre seated, but every so often you will see a different view of Las Vegas. Sometimes if you're lucky, you'll see people jumping off the side from Stratosphere's Skyjump attraction.  The last time I came I had decided to bring my family and my dad and ex were both wearing shirts which wasn't allowed so they had them wear a weird shade of orange, oversized dress shirt over it which was pretty funny. So unless you want to be mismatched and standing out, I suggest you suit up! Or dress somewhat nice.  I've tried their Crab Cakes, Ribeye, Rack of Lamb, and Salmon which all tasted delightful to me. The horseradish addition to the Ribeye was such a wonderful combination. The juicyness of the steak blended so well with the slight pungent and distinct taste of horseradish which really made my tastebuds jump for joy. The salmon was not dry at all and was very soft and tender. I love lamb and although they are typically small portions, the sauce they put on top was extremely enjoyable. Most of all, their wide assortment of bread was one of my favorite parts of dinner.   I think their pricing is somewhat agreeable and fair for the food and views you get. You're pretty much paying for the experience and views and I mean it is Vegas after all.  Overall, this place is a great spot to go on a date whether it's for something special, or something casual. The food, service, and views are all on point and you will not be disappointed!",

    "text": "I wish the view had it's own category of star's. If that was the case, well then the view would get \"5\" stars from me. However the \"A-OK\" 3 star rating is for the service and the food.   Came here to celebrate my birthday and obviously I wanted it to be extra special!  Let's start from the beginning - it takes about 10 minutes from the lobby to catch an elevator up the restaurant. Not sure why, just it is what it is. Once you are in the packed elevator you will make your way up to the 106th floor and your ears will feel clogged along the way.   Once we were greeted by the host; who was not polite...I reminded her I had called multiple times (weeks in advance) asking to be sat right by the glass window as it was my birthday and I really wanted the \"4 - top table\" right by the edge. However, they were for some reason unable to accommodate that despite me saying I would wait no matter how long.   We were sat in a booth that was a level up and I mean do not get me wrong... THE VIEW IS INSANE. Such an amazing view and that view is gorgeous no matter where you sit.   Fun fact: The dining room spins while you eat so you get a different view every few minutes you look up. This also makes it a little bit difficult to find your way to the restroom.   The service was so so slow like painfully slow. Our food was good. Just good, nothing I would want as my last meal in prison. So I will not go into detail about the entree's we ordered. The complimentary bread is nice with the variety of soft whipped butters however all of the break was rock hard, too hard. I could see where the flavor may have potential....also warning it has nuts in it. In case you are allergic..  Once the meal was done - they did nothing for my birthday despite me telling the host multiple times. Oh well I am not going to cry about it.  The server finally took our payment and upon getting the receipt shined a flashlight on the receipt. It was as if he was looking for the tip we were leaving. It was so awkward and seemed rude. Luckily we tip 20% no matter what...  The bill was around $150 for (3) entree's and (2) drinks.  Go for the view but don't expect good service or mouth-watering entrees.",

We got there 15 min before our reservation and was asked by the hostess to wait at the bar and they gave us a pager which is normal ... we sat down at one of the tables and after a couple of minutes a waitress that look like she was miserable being there dropped off some menus and said she would be back to take our order... she walked back and forth numerous times and never did get our order ... we were a party of 9!!! It would've been a nice check and a nice tip but it looks like she didn't care ... 15 min went by and our pager went off so we went to go get seated ... they had an amazing and delicious chef special w lobster bisque, crab cakes, steak and cream brulee for $106 so I couldn't go wrong with that ... well dinner took 2 hours to the point that I was so tired of sitting there I just ate to eat .. I don't know what the delay was I can't blame it on the waiter he was very pleasant but everything took forever .... but the food was delicious ... I have spoken to several Vegas locals and they all have the same experience ... I don't work in restaurants so I don't know what the challenges are but I know the cocktail miserable servers on the second floor should not be there because that sets a negative tone for the rest of the night",

We ordered the foie gras for an appetizer, which was perfectly cooked.  For dinner, I had the Orange Miso glazed Chilean Sea Bass, and my husband had Lamb Chops, also cooked to perfection.  Dessert was the Chocolate Teardrop Cale and the chocolate Stratosphere replica with berries and mousse.  These pastry chefs truly showed expertise in the presentation of thaws desserts.  Be prepared to spend top dollar, but both food and service was top notch.  Our server Micah was very knowledgeable about the menu.  Great romantic dinner for our last night in Vegas.",

Verdict: Amazing!  We arrived a little before our reservation time but were seated instantly.  Luckily our table was positioned at the windows for the incredible 360 degree view of the city.  Wow.    The eclectic fresh bread basket had its charm especially since it's accompanied with 3 different butters.  Who doesn't love butter? We split the Caesar Salad which made the serving size perfect.  The delicious fresh parmesan cracker bits are delightful!   I had an entree picked out in my mind but then our waiter told me the special was Shrimp Pesto Gnocchi.  Yes Please!  It truly was a special dish.  The shrimp were huge.  The gnocchi was prepared wonderfully with the pesto and spinach.  The dish is rich and filling.  Luckily I had some leftovers to take home.    Our waiter was absolutely pleasant and attentive for our date night.  It's a great place for an unforgettable evening.",

The service in impeccable, the food was great, the view is the best and overall it was a very nice time. It is a bit pricey but very nice for special occasions.   This restaurant is at the top of the Stratosphere Hotel Tower and it rotates slowly. It takes 1 & 1/2 hours to make a complete rotation. What a view!!!   We have never been here because my wife hates heights and would never go up to the top. Well we had guests in town and it was the husbands birthday so she begrudgingly agreed to go up and she ended up having a good time.",

We got the 4-course meal and the bisque was not good, the crab cake was average, the steak was well below average, the shrimp was good and the deserts were excellent.  The beer selection is terrible.  Every other place in Vegas has at least some craft beers, why not here?  Every employee we encountered wished us a happy anniversary...except the waiter.  He was gruff all night and at the end, ended up charging us full price when we gave him a groupon beforehand.  In my book, that is a really big mistake.  The pay the bill process took over 20 minutes which was a bad way to end the night.  Maybe he was having a bad night?  I would not go here again and would definitely not recommend.  The view is great, but there are a lot of great views in Vegas that are a lot less expensive than this one.",

First, we were a little late to our lunch reservation but since they were having a slow day, they totally didn't give us any problems and seated us right next to the window. The view was BREATHTAKING!!! So worth it. I ordered the surf and turf but I always ask for well done steak. The server told me that every restaurant is different but if I like it not dry but still cooked all the way through, I should try medium. She was so right. The steak was cooked to perfection (in my eyes). She also suggested I try the strawberry lemonade & that was amazing too! We couldn't stop gushing about the food and the view. Don't forget to check out the observation deck just two floors above the restaurant! They'll let you up for free if you ask nicely!",

I ordered a Ribeye with blue cheese butter topping and creamed spinach while my partner had the seafood pasta. Both were delicious although they took about 20-25 minutes to arrive. My steak was cooked perfectly and the blue cheese butter complimented it very well. The service was excellent and we enjoyed the beautiful (but overpriced) photo that the photographer captured of us.

My husband took pity and switched plates with me.  Celebrating daughters 21st BDay brunch and not a mention--thanks for the love, Stratosphere",

Menu selection is horrible and over priced expected it's Vegas you basically pay for the view. Food was not worth it. You would be better off going to the lounge and ordering drinks and appetizers you can still enjoy the view from the lounge. To give you an idea of the price I ordered spaghetti squash and zucchini dish which was basically zoodles and pasta sauce and my husband had a salad with salmon salad was average at best. Two mixed drinks, 2 beers and a dessert. Bill came to $196.00 That's a bit much I think. Also for a classy place people wore whatever the heck they wanted. I think you can get the same experience cheaper by utilizing there lounge!",

It was so disorganized, we waited for the elevator for 10mins. Then got pulled to the \"VIP\" elevator because \"that one was faster\" waited for another 10mins. Got pulled back to the our original area we waited for the 1st elevator. Like what the hell?? Was that even neccessary?  No one could give us a straight answer.  For how pricey the restaurant is, you would think all operations moved smoothly. Nothing really stood out besides the view, food was ok, drinks ok... not something I would repeat.",

Definitely one of my favorite steakhouse restaurants in town with a nice overview of Las Vegas, it rotates 360 degrees and you get to see everything throughout your dining time. I must say you get large portion of meals, so don't be scared of the numbers on the menu lol. My favorite steak was NY steak and we got the Mac and cheese with double baked potato. Everything came out pretty fast and delicious. We will definitely go back!!",

We came early so we got to see the incredible view by day and night.  The service staff was wonderful and helped us pick some wine and even dessert wine later.  The entrees were ok but we really enjoyed each other and the service and the view!  The server was friendly and professional and so was the rest of the staff from the moment of check in downstairs to the elevator ride.  I highly recommend coming here for a special night.  We will be back to try the bar some night.  Great job to everyone at this restaurant!!",

This place certainly takes the cake for a truly enjoyable dining experience for everyone to take in.     Everything from the service, the decor, the lighting, the ambience was fantastic.     While not really paying attention to what was going on as we were enjoying some beverages, something had caught all of our eyes, something outside the window had zipped past our vision.   Upon further review, we soon notices that there were cables for people that were free jumping off of the top of the roof of the place.   That was awesome to see!    The steak that I ordered rivaled some of the better steaks I've had in my lifetime.   Everything that I had ordered was very enjoyable, cooked perfectly, and just really hit the spot.     The dessert menu?   Oh boy... That was the thing that put it all over the top.   The Chocolate mousse cake was amazing.. and everyone else I was with couldn't stop raving about the creme brulee that they had ordered.     One thing to watch out for.... if you're sitting non the rotating part of the restaurant, make sure that you don't have any motion sickness.   I felt a little off after our meal, and I didn't think about it but I was spinning backwards the whole time we were there.   As soon as I had gotten to stable ground... I felt a little disoriented (it couldn't have been the wine either)... but it was still a great time.",

I try not to let stuff like that bother me, but I'm guessing the B team works the lunch shifts while the A team works the dinner.  We had the Power lunch which was a 3 course meal.  We had the lobster bisque and French onion soup to start with.  The surf and turf as our main course, and finished off for dessert with a salted caramel creme brulee.

We sent them back and were apologized to over the undercooked seafood. As a way of trying to apologize, they offered two free desserts. We selected the baked Alaska and chocolate cake. A member of the party took a bite of the baked Alaska dessert and as he was chewing, we heard a loud crack. His tooth painfully cracked out of his mouth by something hard in the dessert. We believe that there was plastic in the dessert - or something hard in it that should not have been. Upon telling the manager about the situation, HOLDING UP THE CRACKED TOOTH, the manager was completely rude, unapologetic, and downright hostile. We came to dine at this restaurant, were fed raw seafood, given a cracked tooth and we're treated like trash?????? Better yet -- now they are refusing to pay the dental bills!!! A VERY expensive night for an incredibly low quality (and hazardous....and painful) dinner.   Did I mention it was my 21st birthday?????",

We ordered their surf and turf special, which consisted of a petit filet mignon, lobster tail and mashed potatoes with a red wine and mushroom reduction. We're not fans of seafood so the lobster was replaced with chicken. The filet mignon and mashed potatoes were delicious. The meat was cooked perfectly and the reduction was very savory and It complemented  the dish perfectly. The chicken, however, was flavorless and dry. I did not enjoy It at all!  The meal special came with a salad and a desert. The desert was small but It was very yummy. It includes a small serving of creme brulee and Dark chocolate mousse with some sort of berry jelly.   Very happy with our experience",

I'm talking $8 for flat tap water splurge.  The food is delicious, though not the largest portions. They go for quality rather than quantity here. To be honest, I filled up on the assortment of bread and butter before my meal even came to me.   I was told when making a reservation everyone had to order an entree but that wasn't True. I enjoyed the lobster bisque soup (under starters) and lobster mac n cheese (under side dish) and that was perfectly fine. My boyfriend ordered the lamb chops with baked potato. One of my friends ordered the tomato caprese. Another friend ordered the chicken but said it was a bit bland under seasoned.  Go for the great views of the city lit up, and the quality time with friends. Also, if you're brave enough test out the roller coaster or bungee jump off the Stratosphere. My heart couldn't take it.  Pro tip: Check out the menu ahead of time so you don't have sticker shock. I sent the menu link to my friends hours before we went so they had time to adjust accordingly and figure out what they wanted.",

Steaks are spot on, great variety of options, sides are decent, and desserts fantastic.  French Onion Soup - This is not your traditional FOS.  If you are expecting Cap Grille crock with a nice piece of gruyere melted across the top - well have news for ya, skip this dish.  My first one came out cold and had to send back.  The second one was loaded with onions and broth which was hot, good news, but then it was an assembly of croutons with a cheese sauce - only way I can describe it.  Was not tasty at all.  Wine - Ordered a $100+ bottle and I don't know if it was the sommelier, but they did open, pour and give me a taste.  We had 5 glasses and they poured way too much into the glasses and dumped the bottom sediment pour into the last glass.  Prompt to hit me up for a new bottle to which I said, lets see how this goes.  I did order a second bottle and while I was in the restroom, they opened the bottle, never let me taste it, and apparently just poured it on top of the others without asking if we wanted new glasses.  I guess I can chalk this up to the service for the evening.  Food wise - tried lamb instead of steak since I wasn't that hungry.  The lamb was cooked perfectly medium rare and there are 3 side accompaniments which nobody bothered to explain what they were.  I had to ask to learn about the horseradish, jelly (which I of course knew), and side sauce.   Still, for what I'm spending, come satisfy my curiosity.  The view of course is great and the overall experience is still nice, especially being able to go up to the observation deck.  Still an experience you need to have.",

The views are magnificent! The service is great! Parking is Free! I really didn't want to write a review, some of my Yelp friends have done a really good job on that before!  With all the interest on the photos though,  I feel obligated to give some more info on my experience.  The white chocolate bread in the bread basket was irresistible!  The crab cakes were the best I ever had!  The spinach salad white gorgonzola was scrumptious! The salmon was like butter and didn't smell like fish! The filet mignon was tender and delicious! The sweet potatoes with white meringue and apple nut was exceptional!  The bananas foster were delicious! The cream brulee was creamy and delicious! The 21 layer chocolate cake was delightful, enough for 4 people! The ingredients are  high quality and fresh, done in a healthy way! I haven't reviewed for a very long time... this place was worth reviewing again!",

The server was so rude, when we ordered an expensive bottle of wine, the server refilled our glasses and said \"just like you remembered it\" insinuating that we had never had ordered an expensive bottle of wine before, are you kidding ME.  No sequence of service or care what so ever about us.  I had the pork, boring and dry again nothing special.  This was our wedding night (we are 50 somethings, not 20 somethings) and really wanted something to remember, well unfortunately it will be remembered for poor food and what's even worse poor service.  Our server did not have a name tag nor bothered to introduce himself so I can't mention him by name unfortunately.  Again, believe the poor reviews and eat somewhere else, the view is simply not worth the lack of caring by every person that we met.",

I usually don't have the patient to sit and wait, but since the view was changing, I didn't feel very boring between the food. Only tip for anyone read this is before going there, go to one of the ticket 4 tonight booth and pay $3 to get 25% off. I only know that afterwards. My total bill was $180 for two people, if I would knew, it will save me good $45, which was not a small number. I felt, restaurant should post it instead of letting ticket 4 tonight to make their money. I felt I was one of the thousand stupid guests to be ripped off?",

The tower will rotate 360 within 1 hr, the view and the resto's ambience is soooo perfect for a dinner date (I don't recommend bringing kids @ this place)  Our waiter was very nice, and he didn't complain about taking pic with us every time he brings our food LOL! below are what we ordered: -DRINKS *iced tea $5 *Miller lite $7.50 (we don't drink wine but they have a bunch of wine in the menu)  -APPETIZER PLATTER  *$50 ($25 per person) kobe beef, shrimp scampi & lobster ravioli -MAIN COURSE  * Chilean Sea bass $42 * Filet Mignon $48 * Potato Au Gratin $10 * Asparagus $10  -DESSERT * chocolate stratosphere $13 all of the food that we ordered are perfect and soooo yummy, only thing i would suggest though is don't order the asparagus unless ur a big veggie eater I prolly had 2 sticks from the plate full of asparagus for $10  after dinner we went to the romantic lounge, cocktails are buy 1 get 1 free with the receipt from our dinner, they had a live jazz band and the lounge had the same view as the resto   OVERALL EXPERIENCE: 5 STARS++++ I got nothing neg to say about this resto, the food we had were great and the service was perfect they have a photog inside though that will try to sell you a package of pics for $160 BRING UR OWN CAMERA and take pics yourself or have the waiter do it for you, although we bought wallet pics from their photog for $16 otherwise our dinner experience here was perfect :)",

The food, was equally amazing.  The beef carpaccio was possibly the best dish I've ever had at any restaurant (rivaled only by the sweetbreads at Bouchon).  The salad was amazing too, with just the right balance of everything.  I don't remember everything since this was two years ago, but I think it was arugula, pecans, an amazing bleu cheese crumbled on top, with mandarin oranges, and a balsamic reduction to give it the right blend of sweet and acidic.  I don't remember what my main entree was or what the dessert was, but I remember thinking that it was pretty awesome.  I know one of us (could've been me or my girlfriend) had a lobster dish that was really spectacular.  Anyway, even though I don't remember all the details, I remember enough to recommend it to anyone in Las Vegas for the weekend.",

But having heard decent things about the restraunt, and given that it provided a free ride up (otherwise $15/adult), a lunch time stop when recently in Las Vegas was planned.  As I recalled, there is a bit of a cheap almost junky atmosphere to much of the walk through the Casino and shops, and when finally up in the restraunt (which is nicer, though not on par with some of the other establishments in Las Vegas), found the view was maybe even better than I recalled.  With that much as expected, I was pleasantly suprised to find the food very good!  Excellent even.  Service was also good... in fact everything was right on.",

The view is nothing but spectacular--and nothing you can get anywhere else in Vegas. And that's pretty much what you want when it comes to Vegas--something fabulous that stands out above all the rest, right?  Well worth the price, Top of the World scores high ratings for its unique, rotating, ever-changing view of the entire Vegas area.  Professional staff who is polished, poised, and focused on providing a memorable experience also ups the rating for Top of the World.  As for food, everything we ordered was stellar. I enjoyed the sea scallop and shrimp entree nestled on a bed of mediterranean couscous.  Other favorites at our table were the lamb entree and the potato gnocchi and cheese.  If you want to create a moment in time that will fairly sparkle in your memory, look no further than Top of the World.",

    "text": "My girlfriend booked reservations here a month in advance.  As you can see in other reviews we too had to wait 45 minutes still to get a table after our reservation time.  That didn't bother us really but the food did.  Terrible.  Anyone who thinks they have good food probably ranks Burger King as their favorite burger.  I had the lobster ravioli-the portion was ok- but after one bite I was creeped out by its taste.  It comes with a baby lobster tail, that I literally had trouble cutting w/ a steak knife because it was so tuff and stringy.   We also had Alaskan King Crab legs-  You could get fresher crab legs at shithole here in Chicago in Chinatown.  They're fishy and just plain low quality.  My girlfriend loves shrimp and ordered the shrimp scampi-she at about two shrimp before the toughness and grainyness creeped her out too much to eat.   She also had mashed potatoes-somehow they managed to come up with a unique taste to make mashed potatoes bad.  The view is great-thats it.  Go here if you are just want to sit in the lounge and drink.  The seafood is so bad that even if you love seafood you will not want to eat it for awhile after eating this garbage.  The inside is somewhat rundown as well.  Our waiter barely could speak english and was actually helped by other waiters at somepoints because they could see (or have seen before) that we could only  make out half of what he said.  If this place weren't on top of the stratosphere every review would say \"I wanted to puke after one bite of my meal.\"  The prices are expected for the atmosphere, but to have such a great atmosphere and a terribly run place is ridiculous, but I guess expected since no one would ever need to go there twice with it being in Vegas.  They know they can bend you over and they certainly do.",

    "text": "Having been to the Space Needle in Seattle and having dinner, and the CN tower in Toronto and having dinner, my next natural stop while in Vegas was the Stratosphere for dinner. Dinner atop a tower is not a thing for those with vertigo or motion sickness. This was the bad part for my group as shortly after being seated a couple started feeling it. Yes this restaurant REVOLVES so you get a full view of Vegas. I love this but it may not be good for others. Order a drink and wait to order before deciding you do actually want to eat here and can eat a good portion of your meal.  Service was great although our waiter said his name was something other than was on his name tag which was odd - he was attentive and kept our water glasses filled so we ignored that. The a-la cart options as others mention are kinda pricey but yo are paying for the view moreso than the dinner - I've come to realize this after the first two towers.  I settled on a Caesar salad and steak along with their recommended wine pairing (each main dish has one). The ceasar salad was great and very crisp and fresh and dressing was creamy and tasty. The steak came with a pepper Burgundy reduction that was a bit too strong for my tastes and i immediately ended up scrapping it off and just dunking in for a little extra kick every third bite or so. It was a good sized steak and cooked perfectly for me though.  Stick around for a full rotation to get the full strip and the Fremont Street. Unfortunately with the Fontainebleau still being under construction and blacked out it really distracts from an otherwise amazing view. Occasionally you get a view of people flying by doing the skydiving experience from the tower or the edge ride. And once in a while helicopters will fly by which is pretty cool as well. All in all you really are getting an amazing show with pretty decent dinner and save the price of ticket to the top of the stratosphere.",

We've only gone for lunch since it seems like you get the same food at half the price with the same view(which is kind of what you're paying for.) The service is good but the food itself leaves you expecting to have had more. The pastas are good, however, I like the pasta at the Italian restaurant downstairs more. I've tried the burgers which were actually really good, however last time I had a philly cheesesteak sandwich and it was a little on the small side. Sure $15 isn't outrageous for a sandwich, you just expect it to be a slightly bigger size. Also, last time we went, there was a woman who kept walking behind us so that she could take pictures outside the window. This isn't that bad, but when she kept doing it over and over for 10 minutes straight, eventually, we'd like to be able to enjoy the view rather than stare at her ass in our faces the whole time. I thought the staff could have really said something to her after she just wouldn't sit down. Also, the fire alarm was set off downstairs while we were eating and it was going off for what was literally 10-15 minutes. This is a long time to have a very loud BLARING alarm going off while you are paying for what I consider a classy restaraunt experience. The manager did come around to every table and apologize after about 5, minutes, and then came around again to every table to let us know that they were working on turning it off. That's nice, but after 15 minutes of not being able to hear each other speak and having this blaring alarm in our ears, I really thought we could expect some kind of discount. 10% or at least a free drink. I understand you can't go around looking for free stuff all the time, but when you're paying for a classy experience and as your food arrives you have to sit there and listen to a fire alarm going off right next your ears(it wasn't in the room over or somewhere far away, it was LOUD, and in the dining area), you'd expect something, right? Well we didn't get anything comped which was surprising for how bad our experience was, and then we had to wait 10 minutes for the elevators to start working again since they shut off automatically when the fire alarm goes off. We thought about going upstairs to walk around but when we saw the crowd of people on the observation deck waiting for an elevator, we walked back down to wait in their lounge area. I'm not saying this place is bad, I just think for the price you could definitely get better, and you don't wan't to know what it's like to pay $25-$30 a person to get front row tickets to the fire alarm concert.",

Another tip is to get a table at the windows and not set back on the second level, especially if you are susceptible to motion sickness! You definitely know you are moving and the second levels of seats look straight out so you aren't part of the ride like by the windows which is disconcerting. Now the food...it seems stuck in the 90s. The steaks, which were tender and cooked perfectly, were sitting in a heavy wine sauce which distracted from the great steak. The potato graitin could have been delicious if not over salted. My boyfriend had the surf and turf and the lobster was so over cooked it was mushy and inedible. What was great..the bread, the house salad with a bowl made of shaved cucumbers and the banana bread pudding. Also the fact that you get to bypass lines for the top rides and observation decks as well as the ticket price for the observation deck!",

    "text": "The view is amazing and basically that is what you are paying for.  I passed on the steaks because the average 8oz was $64.  And it's la carte.  I had the marinated pork chops which were perfect.  The caesar salad was just ok but the portion was very small and served in a large dish.  The garlic mashed were good. The drinks were very strong.  I drink Malibu Bay Breeze and it was the strongest one I've had in ages.   I passed on dessert.  Service was perfect.  It's definitely a place to go to at least once.  (We were there for a friends birthday.) The food overall is good but the prices justify the view not the food.",

You can't beat the deal for lunch since it also includes tower admission and the service is incredible. The staff doesn't rush you and gives you plenty of time to enjoy the full restaurant rotation, which I believe takes 80 minutes for a complete circle.  We saw several people doing the sky jump last week and everyone loved their meals.  For ambiance, service, and price no one else beats the Top of the World Restaurant.",

    "text": "I do not understand the positive reviews on here for such a horrible restaurant!  The food was over prices and tasteless.  My husband had the filet $54.  it was drowning in a horrible brandy sauce.  It was possibly the fattiest steak i have ever seen, especially for a filet.  Over half was left over due to the fat that was cut away.  The Creamed spinach was OK.  But $10 for a vat of it.  it would be nice if they had single servings.  I had the tasting menu, $85.  The lobster bisque was ok but too rich.  The Crab cake was over powered but a papaya slaw (the papaya clearly out of season as it was bitter and rancid tasting).  The Fish... OMG, the fish... it was completely tasteless. Then my filet... yuck!  it came with a side of Potato Au Gratin with tasted like paste.  again my steak was drowning in a sauce with onions that we inedible.  Finally time for dessert... it was a trio of desserts (banana pudding, some chocolate tradgedy and raspberry whipped cream).  My husband took a bite of the banana pudding and described it as \"flour mixed with snot\".  Our Bill was over $200 and that did not include wine.  The view was nice, but then again, there are many other places you can eat with a nice view.  MIX and Mandalay Bay has a wondeful view and dynamite food.",

    "text": "I came here at 10pm and it was still pretty busy. The reason why I am giving it 3 stars is because it takes forever to get here with traffic from the main part of the strip, and if you take a taxi, be prepared to pay $20 for the cab ride. Anyway, they have metal detectors there before you go up the SMALL ASS elevator. The view is AMAZING though which is a plus. As far as the food...i've definately had better. It was just alright. I had the Colorrado lamb or something like that. There was too much fat on that, yuck! I thought the actual top part of the stratosphere spun, but it is actually the floor that spins. Yes it's pretty slow, but you can definately feel it. I'm one to get motion sickness and that's what I had. I immediately got a headache after 5 minutes of sitting down. So just be prepared to get queezy if you are sensitive to motion. It is VERY PRICY here so be prepared to spend about $150 for 2 people here for food that is just mediocre. You are paying for the VIEW. As far as the elevators. down, that is another story. I knocked off one star for that because it takes FOREVER. There is a viewing deck above the restaurant and everytime the elevator comes to the floor of the restaurant, it's always full because it stops all the way at the top first. We had to wait 20 minutes for a ride down. It sucked. I hated those damn elevators.",

Our waiter was very gracious and not pushy at all. He actually suggested that we were ordering too much food since the portions were so large. I started my meal out with a caesar salad and while it was nothing spectacular, it was pretty good. But then again, if a restaurant can mess up a simple salad, be very worried. We both ordered steak - the strip and filet. This was hands down the BEST steak I have ever had in my entire life!!!!! I wanted to cry knowing that I would never be able to finish it and since we had no fridge in the room, it would go in the garbage. :-( I also had the au gratin potatoes. The potatoes were cooked in heaven I think. They were not too hard, not too soft and had a blend of cheesy gooeyness.  Needless to say, we did not have room left for dessert, but they looked delicious. Oh yeah, the view was spectacular!!!",

    "text": "GROPON DEAL BEWARE!  Purchased the Groupon deal for myself so I can try out the food at this restaurant for the first time. Took my buddy with me and she ordered her own stuff. Made the reservation and let them know I got 1 Groupon deal. I also let the server know as well and he gave me the special menu.   We sat in the booth so there's 2 layers of people blocking the view. Whatever, the lobster bisque was salty af. Crab cake was good and the mustard sauce was a great pair. The filet mignon was nicely grilled. The salted caramel creme brulee was runny, I can drink it with a straw. We also ordered the lamb chops, 4 cocktails, beef tartar. Service was good.   We were pretty intoxicated by the end. I was trying to be careful when I was looking at the receipt, saw that he marked some Groupon items as 0.00 (stupid me, should've read all of it, he charged me the Groupon deal  on one item which adds up to $82 total). Yadda yadda, went back to the hotel room and sobered up. Looked at the receipt again and noticed I was charged for the Groupon deal. The restaurant was already closed so I called and was bounced around until I got to a voicemail. Left a message. I have to head back to LA the next morning so I didn't have time to go back to get a refund. I attempted to call again the next day (10 times, no less), bounced to the same voicemail, I don't know why it's so hard for these people to transfer me to the right person. Never raised my voice or rude. I was calm.   I already paid Groupon for the 4 items, why am I paying for it again at the restaurant? Makes no sense. For Groupon, if you click \"View Voucher\", you can't get a refund on it afterwards. Pretty upset at this point. Sent emails and left voicemails. Time to file a chargeback. One tip for my fellow foodies, you don't have to sign the receipt, the restaurant can still run the charge on the card. The signature is to protect them, not us. If you don't sign it, you have a very high chance of winning a chargeback if they overcharge you. When sh*t hit the fan, good luck trying to reach the restaurant. They'll hear it from the bank though. Thank god for credit cards!",

My boyfriend and I made a reservation at 9 we got there at 8:50 checked in and we had to wait for a table to be cleared. We got seated around 9:15, and our waiter was kind enough to apologize for the wait. We ordered the sea food platter and a steak. We didn't get our food until 10:15. Honestly for the amount we spent on this date we expected way more. The sea food platter had more ice than it did food, the steak wasn't filling, and the time it took for it to be ready was extremely long. The view of the strip lasted about 10 minutes, and for the whole restaurant to circle around took about an hour. Our bill came up to about $340 that's not including gratuity. I wouldn't return, it was nice for the experience.  P.s. If you want good sea food, go to M resort, all you can eat sea food buffet. Less expensive too. And their steak is amazing!",

Both asparagus and Brussel sprouts were fresh and cooked to perfection. Retained their crispness without being raw.  Actually regret ordering though, because too much food.   We were disappointed in the establishment's claim of being upscale. They have a dress code they don't enforce and they had a photographer come around the dining room offering to take photos. Felt cruise ship- like. Definitely detracts from the ambience.",

Where Top of the World really excelled was at helping me find my lost rental car key.  I either dropped it or left it on the table.  Of course I did not discover this until after the long walk through the Casino to the Parking Garage.    I walked back and was fearful of a a penalty fee from the rental car company and a long wait to get this sorted out.  We were both tired.    When I reached the hostess stand one was very attentive and let me return to my table to look.  I realized that the key may have fallen on the outside non moving part of the restaurant so I looked over there too.  No key.   I returned to the hostess stand and the hostess that had previously helped me told me that the key had been turned into security. So I went security and got my key.    These hostesses probably catch hell all day long because they can't always seat people by the window.  In spite if this, the lady helping me was extremely compassionate.  I  ate there on January 25th and I had a 6:30 pm reservation.  I sat in section 5.  This information is provided to help management locate this employee and commend her.",

Caprese salad was one of my favorites with colorful chunks of fresh tomato and fresh mozzarella. Served with micro greens a balsamic drizzle and a basil puree. Another very nice starter, not to heavy.  The shrimp cocktail was delicious, extremely fresh and generously sized shrimp.  The strip steak was the best I've ever had, tender and flavorful! It was a nice portion size as well. I was able to take half home. Along side I ordered the grilled asparagus with Parmesan crouton topping. Again very fresh veggies! The crunch of the Parmesan and croutons was a very nice addition to the tender grilled asparagus.  I tried my husbands fillet as well and it was one of the best fillets I have ever had. Simply seasoned and tender, it nearly melts in your mouth. Delicious!  I tried my husbands loaded twice baked potato as well, it was a very big portion and was fluffy and simply delicious.  All the food was rich and delicious but did not leave us feeling too full or yucky by the end of the meal.  The view was AMAZING! As a local it was fun to identify locations around town near and far off into the distance. It was also a lot of fun to watch people enjoying the crazy rides on the floor about the restaurant. We got to see a number of people bungee jump and found that really cool.  It takes the restaurant an hour and 20 minutes to make a whole revolution and in the time we spent enjoying the restaurant I would say we got to go around a time and a half.  The service was great, prompt and extremely friendly. I wish I could remember our waiters name he was very personable and helpful with suggestions on the menu. I very much enjoyed my experience and felt that although the service was prompt we were still able to spend a nice chunk of time enjoying the beautiful restaurant and view.  I hope to enjoy this restaurant again soon. It was a very nice treat!",

Once you're off the elevator, you have to wait again just to be seated. Once we were seated, we had to wait...and wait for the waiter to come by. The waiter that we had did not bother to ask what we wanted to drink, did not bother to ask how the food was, and didn't ask if we wanted dessert/coffee. The cocktails (which we had to tell the waiter we wanted) were very good. There is not an extensive menu so I hope you like overpriced steak or seafood. The salmon I had was small, greasy, and definitely not worth the price. However, the bread was delicious.   If you want to see the view, I recommend going to 107 Sky Lounge because the restaurant is nothing to write home about.",

We requested a window table for my husband's birthday and got it.  However, they are correct by saying there are gorgeous views from any table or booth at the restaurant.    We started with the lump crab, filet mignon tartare, and avocado salad.  OMG, the best lump crab and steak tartare ever!!  The avocado salad was also light and refreshing.  I only had a few bites because I wanted to save my appetite.  For our entrees, I ordered the Australian Wagyu Skirt Steak and my husband had the bone-in ribeye.  The skirt steak was incredible.  I brought the leftovers back to our hotel and had a refrigerator delivered to my room for just that purpose.  (I had to fib and say I needed to refrigerate my medication...oops.)  Unfortunately, we had too many other amazing meals that weekend, so the leftovers never got eaten.  That is a darn shame because it was the best meal of the weekend!  Kudos to TOTW which could have gotten by on their looks alone but stepped up to the plate with some f****ing amazing food!",

We were seated right away, even though we were early for our reservation. Our server, Micah, was prompt and very professional. We both ordered power lunches- with the Groupon special. I ordered a Caesar salad (pretty standard but good), the filet and lobster tail (very good, lobster tail is small but overall the dish was well cooked) and the creme brulee (very good) and my partner ordered the beet/burrata (amazing flavors) the salmon (slightly salty but cooked perfectly) and the baked Alaska (upcharge but worth it). Overall, I would recommended it. I wouldn't say I HAVE to go everytime I'm in LV but it's a good experience. And they give you free access to the observation floors after!",

First off, you are required to pay the fee to go to the top deck in order to get to the restaurant despite being told from others on Yelp that this wasn't the case. However, it was worth it. We enjoyed the views.   It wasn't busy so we were able to have a seat along the edge. The view is spectacular!!! We almost made it all the way around but we were able to see from all angles. I believe our server told us it takes an hour and 15 minutes to get all the way around but don't quote me on that.   Our server was great and very attentive. She brought us water and a break basket right away. We ordered drinks cause, why not? They came quickly and tasted delicious. I ordered the sangria.   My husband and think alike too much but we both ordered the steak sandwich. It was so good! Very flavorful, with a TON of meat but for some reason I didn't take a picture which is not like me.   We did not get a chance to have desert because we were so full from the sandwich and to be honest my fear of heights was taking its toll on me so I was anxious to get my feet back on the ground. They have a desert cart that you pass on your trip around the tower.   While having lunch we watched the crazy people on the ride they have on the observation deck. We also watched two crazy people do the \"bungee jump.\"    Overall it was a great experience. Service was good, food was good and the view was amazing.",

Courteous staff, but lacking.   2 stars for food. Highly disappointed about everything. You don't pay $78.00 for the wagyu ribeye, and get a piece that has 3 inches of fat and a huge line of grisle. I should not have to chew like I have a piece of jerky in my mouth.   The filet was way under cooked, rare moo rare. They then took it back and re-fired the same piece. Never do that, it came back super tough. Like we should not have to keep chewing the same piece like a cow chewing grass.  The duck confit was so overcooked as well. Hardly any pink left in the meat. The leg was fine, but the breast was ruined. It was dry, and the Yukon potato scalloped circle was inedible. It tasted old, and re cooked.   The sea bass was not hot, and salty. More than likely it was salted as well as having the miso sauce. The miso sauce is already salty as it is.   The twice baked potato was recommended, but I would not recommend it.  The haricorts had a balsamic reduction or sauce that wasn't mentioned. Underseasoned.   The salads were alright. Caesar was more outer leaves instead of hearts. It was definitely overdressed, but for some who like the extra dressing it was perfect. The butter/ bibb salad was alright with roasted beets.   The bread was alright, no sourdough like the waiter mentioned. Three types of butter: orange, pesto, and regular. Some were hot, and some not.  There were also some flat chip like bread. They were salty in places, spicy in others, and okay.  Creme brulee was good, a little burnt on the sugar top. The teardrop chocolate cake was dense and the outer chocolate was really hard.   Overall I would say come for drinks and appetizers. DO NOT COME FOR STEAK! The couple next to us got the ribeye with the horseradish crust. They only ate half- chewy and undercooked.   Manager stepped in, and comped one dish. They decided that since the leg of the duck was moist, but the breast was dry, they comped half of that.  Still a disappointment.",

The view is also spectacular, and it rotates slowly enough that you can probably get two rotations before end of your dinner.  food: hands down wagyu beef is the best thing on the menu. It melts in your mouth and is extremely flavorful. I added grilled mushrooms to the entree and it only made it better.   I would highly recommend",

The restaurant itself was fairly full and as far as I know had a long waiting list. If you eat here, I would highly recommend making a reservation a day in advance as well as making a reservation for the evening after the sun has set as the nighttime views of The Strip are fantastic. Food service was a bit slow, but the quality of our food was well worth it. Definitely one of the best meals I have ever had in a revolving restaurant and in general. Our server was phenomenal. Even though a lounge is located right above, the restaurant was also surprisingly quiet. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone who is visiting Las Vegas!",

Each time a little something something came to our table to eat, it was paired with a glass of wine! I was in drink heaven. The food was excellent, from the salad to the filet mignon to the desert. I might be biased, but the desert was my favorite part.... my now husband had an engagement ring waiting for me in one of the desert cakes and he proposed! It was magical! Turns out he pre-planned the occasion with the engagement special, and the wait staff was 'in on it'. A photographer took pictures (it was apart of the engagement special) and now I have the memories forever.   The second time I went was with a girlfriend for happy hour. Buy one get one drinks! Yes! The drink was really refreshing (can't remember the name... cucumber something or other). I'm glad we caught Happy hour because drink prices on regular menu seemed steep (19$-22$). Even though it was really crowded, we still found a place to sit and had excellent service.   Check this place out! The views alone are worth the cost of a drink.",

    "text": "So....you want a steak? And you're thinking to yourself,\" I'm in Vegas and I need to get myself a fine dining experience, with a killer view of the city and enjoy a beautiful moment in the madness of Vegas night life.\" Well fellow readers, this is your spot.  Now, let me be clear, there are some pretty amazing steak houses in Vegas. You got Cut, Maesto's and other spots. They are all pricey and bring a certain charm to your world. So be prepared for a dinner for two costing (without good wine) $350. That's a pretty good sum for a great experience.  The Resteraunt is located in top of the Stratosphere. This casino is all honesty is a dump. It's the borderland between the strip and downtown. Broken dreams powered by pawn shops, short order wedding chapels and ya tattoo parlors lifter the surroundings. But you will avoid al that when you drive direct to the Tower itself. The hotel is a dump now because of low maintenance and the parking lot being filthy. Parking is free though which is nice given how other casinos now barge $12 for 24 hour parking.  So, go through the casino and catch the elevator going up to the Resteraunt. The elevators take forever. Be patient, that's how it is. You will encounter drunks and other orcs going in and out with their bottomless margaritas. It's ok...keep going.  Now, the resteraunt entry is easy. And when you get in, you will be seated on this amazing, tall ceiling space. The entire floor is like a lazy Susan and turns a full 360 while you sit and eat. Menu is pretty straightforward.  We ordered surf and turf filet mignon. Around $65 bucks a pop. Not bad. Steak can be prepared blue in the center for all you savage carnivores out there.  The desert iand the wine list is pretty good. Oh and the waiters are very personable and super chill. You won't be disappointed. Get the souffle, it is one of the best. Avoid the ice cream, it's just ok.  Anyhow, great steak and very beautiful view. Truly a joy for a night in Vegas. Oh and when you are done, go watch the sky divers jumping off the building....it's insane.",

The Strat is no exception, but prices on par with other fine dining on the strip and you're not just paying for the view: the food was excellent. I had the crab stuffed chicken, Brussels sprouts and twice baked potatoes. The wine list was well curated with reasonable options.  You really do get a lovely and intimate experience: dimly lit, quiet, with ample space so you don't feel as if you're dining with the strangers seated at the next table over :)",

The restaurant sits at about the top of the Stratosphere Tower, and it's a neat and beautiful view of Vegas and the Strip. The eating area slowly oscillates around the tower, providing for the all around view. We waited a very minimal additional time after our reservation to get an outer edge seat - worth it as well.  The food was great, prices are reasonable, and our service was great as well. I think the only major thing missing was the ambiance of the actual interior. It just seemed lackluster, dull, and a bit outdated. Nonetheless, I'd give it 4.5 stars, so I'll throw the extra half in there.  Also, we went to the Sky Lounge for happy hour first and were able to bring down much cheaper drinks for dinner. Definitely the suggested route...",

We opted for the tasting menu and opted to upgrade the shrimp to lobster for an extra 10 bucks. well worth it.   We started with the lobster bisque (a little too much Brandy for my taste) and my cousin got the Caesar. I then got the scallop and she got the pork belly. We shared them. I liked the scallop (it's just one) much better. The filet and lobster were next and they were amazing. Lastly was the dessert, which I was too full to enjoy!   Get there early. The lines for the elevators are long and you have to go through a metal detector. But it's an amazing experience to do in the beginning of your trip to get the full view!",

The long ride in the elevator built up the anticipation.  We did need to wait for perhaps 10 minutes though we had our reservation.  Every table has a view of Las Vegas as the restaurant rotates 360 degrees.  The night view was romantic and spectacular.  We tried the prawn shrimp and crab cake appetizers.  They were excellent.  The lobster bisque tops the best I had and is a must try.  However, my New York steak was just average and a bit chewy.  The restaurant seemed to rotate faster than I thought.  You could feel the movement.  I guess it's ok as long as you don't feel dizzy.  The waiter told us that you don't feel as much movement facing the direction of the clockwise rotation.  My waiter's service was excellent and cordial.   You can see people doing bungee jump from the roof. Overall, I'd recommend it as it is a once in lifetime experience.  Price was reasonable, we spent about $65 per person considering the venue and the price you pay for food on the Strip.  BTW, I was told to be dressy but most people in the restaurants showed up with just casual clothing and even jeans and tennis shoes.",

First recommendation I have is to get reservations, on the Friday that i went the wait averaged about 2.5-3 hours, so be prepared for that if you don't have a reservation.  We were promptly seated after arriving a couple minutes after our reservation time. The service was great, very friendly and attentive hostess, waiter and manager who came around and asked about our stay and experience so far which is always a plus.  The obvious thing that makes this place so great is the views, it was a clear night and you could see for miles, the strip was gorgeous, it was breathtaking to say the least. Whoever thought of the revolving floor concept is a genius because it is the perfect speed to allow you to see all sides of vegas without giving you any motion-sickness.  We decided to start with the crab cake for our appetizer, it was great, very meaty and the consistency was better than most I have had. The slaw it came with also complimented it nicely.  For my entree I got the 10oz center cut steak with a side of mashed potatoes. Perfect steak, marble fat which just melted in your mouth and the steak was made to a perfect medium, literally would dissolve in your mouth and leave you with such good flavor. I was very impressed with the quality of the food and the experience as a whole. The price is so worth it, you won't forget this dining experience, it's a must!",

I attended lunch at this restaurant with two other people. My steak was okay, I had the filet. Not cooked to my specifications but it wasn't a big deal. My mother had the prime rib sandwich and the cut was so bad she didn't take one bite for the fact she couldn't cut or bite the steak whatsoever. But the most frustrating part was our server. Not once did \"Armida M.\", according to the receipt, ask us if we needed anything or how anything tasted. Not the kind of service or lack thereof you should get when you are spending that kind of money. I also think good servers should acknowledge that a dish was untouched and question if the guest would like another dish or remove it from the bill. Although the views are incredible. This restaurant is not the best you will find in Vegas especially when it comes to quality control and the customer service.",

It was at the rubbery, about to melt stage, but didn't quite make it. All the staff was great except for our waitress. I think she got kind of miffed that we asked for a kids menu for my 15 year old niece who didn't see anything she liked on the lunch menu. We didn't get the kids menu any way because she told us in a rather bitchy tone that it's policy that you must be 12 and under. Fine. So I ask for a dessert menu for my niece. Waitress acted shocked. For lunch!? Jesus lady just give me the damn menu. I've been here before and I am not coming back anymore.",

It was all so cold! And on top of this, I asked for a Medium steak and got a well done!!  Only after complaining to the manager, we got new food and Kevin has changed attitude.

We were there at night and the spinning top with the circular view of the Vegas night lights is amazing. Gorgeous place for a date or romantic dinner. The service was great and the food was very good. Steak and appetizers were good and went well with the red wine. We honestly didn't want to leave and hubby had a coffee and I got another wine after dinner just to stay there as we were chatting cause it was so pleasant and gorgeous there and the waitress was great. Definitely the best part of the stratosphere all together hands down. Even if you're not staying at the hotel, i would strongly recommend visiting the top of the world for dinner.",

We had 4:00pm reservations for our first night in Las Vegas and while it wasn't busy, its better to be safe than sorry.  Yes, it is a little early for dinner but this was a great time as we were able to enjoy the beautiful sunset and watch the city go from day to night.  Be sure to ask for a window seat!    The waitress, Dalia, was very nice and attentive.  We were served a bountiful bread basket with 3 different infused butter options - highly recommend the honey ginger one!  We both ordered filets (no soups or salads - saving room for our anticipated meal!)  We were told that the sides are bigger but not really \"shareable\" so we ordered our own - I got the butternut risotto and my husband ordered the baked potato.  FYI - these are definitely shareable!  Everything was delicious and prepared well -although the presentation was a little lacking (steak on the plate with 2 cooked carrots).   They have a photographer who goes around and will take photos of you - of course they charge for the photos but this a great chance to get some really nice mementos of a great date night!  After dinner, be sure to go to the observation deck and take a look around!  Again, what a view!",

    "text": "Called ahead to make reservations several days prior, as I wanted to surprise my girlfriend by bringing her here for or anniversary. I specifically requested a table on the outer rim, and was told that she could put the request into the reservation, but she couldn't guarantee that we wouldn't have to wait once we got there- which was no problem, just so long as they set us up when we got there.   Called again 30 minutes prior to the reservation time just to make sure my request had been put it in, and was assured that it had been.   Once we got there of course they tried to seat us and when I asked about the outer rim table that I had specifically requested, she said she didn't see anything and it would be a 20 minute wait. Again, not sure why I was assured twice that it was taken care of when it wasn't, but okay.  The service after that continued the trend of being subpar- (it was a slow Wednesday night and the restaurant was not very busy). After ordering our soup and salad, we were told our bread was on the way, which showed up 15 minutes later (after we had finished our first course). We then proceeded to wait a full hour for our main course, at which point our server didn't check in on us ONCE. No drink refills, no asking if we needed anything or wanted more bread, no update on when our food was coming out, nothing.   We finally received our meals (the food was decent, but nothing to rave about) and we waited another 30 minutes after we finished to be asked about dessert or a check. I understand that individual results may vary depending on who you get as a server, but for being a top rated restaurant in Las Vegas, I was extremely disappointed at the customer service and overall attention to customers. It was like they didn't even care we were eating there, so long as we paid our bill at the end of the night.",

The bar is a great location as is the view but after that there isn't much to talk about. The oyster on half shell had in the bathroom 20minutes later. The steak was poor quality actually shredded like roast beef. Plus the view is only good actually for the 10 minutes it rotates by the strip after that you have to realize the rest of the valley is pretty dim and not much to look at. Simply said you pay for a ten minute view and not the food or service.",

    "text": "For a long time, I've held a negative image of the Stratosphere. I've never stayed there, but many years ago I visited the casino and wrote it off. However, my image has changed after dining in the Top of the World Restaurant last September.  Arrive early, as it's a long walk through the hotel and to the elevators that take you to the top. You also must go through a security check point that took about ten minutes.   The views are breathtaking. Really, one of the best views on the strip.   The service is top notch. Everyone on staff was warm, welcoming and more than competent. Along with the view, they are the superstars of the restaurant.  Do not order the tasting menu, unless you are on the competitive eating circuit. The portions are mammoth. If you do decide to try it, as it is a great deal, make sure to eat about 1/3 of each course, so that you will have enough room to taste them all. The food is excellent and I nearly cried when I felt ill during my steak from too much food. I couldn't even take the smallest bite of dessert because I was so stuffed. Our server told us that the tasting menu has grown in size over the years and people rarely are able to eat it all. You've been warned!  It's a little cheesy, but also exciting to occasionally see people bungee jumping off the side of the building. It's so unexpected, that they have warning signs on the walls. They will also send around a photographer, which again is cheesy, but we got such a great photograph out of it, that we bought it.  I'm glad to have had this dining experience. It's well worth the money.",

I am from Maine and ordered the seafood Alfredo, I wouldn't have paid $5 for that meal, the lobster was like rubber and VERY fishy, and even worse the next day (Alfredo always tends to be the best the day after). My boyfriend had a decent meal but we shared a side of \"roasted vegetables\" which tasted and looked like someone just took them out of a freezer bag and nuked them. We both also got VERY motion sick. The motion of the spinning is very apparent and the outside walls stay in place and can be very disorienting. We asked for our food to go because we just couldn't take it anymore. They don't even have to try with the food and can charge a ridiculous amount of money for a mediocre meal because of their location. If you're in Vegas eat somewhere else, and go have a drink at the observatory. Worst $200 I've ever spent.",

The view is undeniably gorgeous.  I had a romantic dinner overlooking all of Las Vegas.  We were sat near the outer edge so that we can see everything.  They even have jumpers off of the building.  Sadly, that didn't happen because there was lightning.  Understood.  There is not too much to choose from on the menu and is rather pricey.  All the entrees are just that.  The entree.  I got the 14oz. New York steak with Brandy peppercorn sauce.  Pretty large steak!  If you want sides, you have to pony up about $10.  The wait staff was impeccable.  They always made sure our drinks were filled (could only afford free water at this point) and that everything tasted good--which the food did.  You do have to spend a minimum of $50 per person, so if you order the chicken which is $46, you will have to order additional items (extra sauce is $2, so get two sauces!).  Overall a good experience.  Breathtaking view!",

    "text": "All atmosphere and little else...To begin, our waiter took far too long to come back to the table and take our order after our menus were closed and on the table.  I ordered the filet mignon, medium rare and the mushroom side.  My filet came out between medium and medium well.  My date's sea bass was good, but certainly nothing exceptional.  When the waiter finally came back to check on our food...WAY too long after serving...I informed that my filet was overcooked and would like another.  He took the plate away, but did not offer to take my date's away or the mushrooms and bring out together.  My date had eaten about 95% of her sea bass when my steak arrived.  I had eaten the mushrooms while waiting, (lukewarm)...and then proceeded to cut my filet to find that it still wasn't a PERFECT medium rare.  I ate it anyway, (lukewarm sauce)...and tried to make the best of an evening.  We also ordered 2 glasses of wine and while I am guessing that a 6 ounce pour is the goal...my Cab was probably closer to 5 ounces.  There was no recognition from the staff or management that I was paying $250 for a meal where we each ate while the other watched.  No offer to buy a dessert...(we ordered the cheesecake...rather dry)...and called it a day.  Awful, awful, awful and worst of all is that no member of management or ownership even offered an apology.  I understand that this place caters to tourists and losing me will not ruin their business, but my date was a local and assuredly will spread the negative word.  Go for the view and order a 5 ounce glass of wine, then leave...not a restaurant that is worth spending $250.  There is better food and service at virtually any other reputable restaurant in Las Vegas.",

The food is definitely overpriced and is decent but not great. The view of the Vegas city from above kind of makes up for that. This is a really romantic place especially if you go later in the evening during sunset time. I would recommend this place mainly because of the atmosphere, great service, and the view but not because of the food.",

Once you arrive and take the elevator up, the restaurant decor is dated - but that was sort of the fun of it - everything in Vegas is tacky so we just went with it. The waiter was awesome - very attentive and accommodating to our large party. The food was super rich and a bit pricey but again, this is what you expect in Vegas so I was fine with it.The views are amazing and we were there long enough to go around a little more than one time and could see it in the light and after sunset so we have a lot of neat pictures. One warning that I didn't come across before going - if anyone in your group has motion sickness, make sure they take something or choose a different restaurant. There were two people in our group of 15 who had issues with the movement.",

The restaurant itself rotates once every hour and has amazing views of every part of Las Vegas from downtown to the strip. The food on the other hand is nothing special. Overpriced for the quality and portion size. But the atmosphere makes up for it. Definitely worth the price of admission. Which in this case is under quality food at high quality prices. So I base my rating on my overall experience which was great because the view and atmosphere.",

Twelve years ago my husband and I had our dinner reception here on our wedding day, and a year later my best friend and her husband did the same. Since then, Vegas has changed a lot, but the view and food at Top of the World remains as good as the first time.   The menu has a good variety, the wine list is extensive (they also have a very long list of scotch). The food is great, the service is attentive, and the view is among the best you can get in Vegas.  Over the years we have bought many friends here, and I would still go back in a heart beat!  Come here for dinner instead of lunch. Make an early dinner reservation so you get to see Vegas at sunset and at night. There is no better place to spend three hours for a relaxing, enjoyable and delightful dinner.",

    "text": "My review is for my visit on 02/22/2014. We had reservations for a party of 12 on Saturday at 8pm. When we got there, the view was spectacular but that's the only positive thing I can say about my visit. The food was terrible! I got the \"Surf and Turf Gnochi with Lobster and Braised Beef Short Rib\" and was promptly disappointed with my meal. The pasta flavor was extra \"fishy\" and was really not a good combination to have the beef short rib added. Whoever thought this was a good way to combine the meal, needs to rethink their taste buds...Seriously.   What was even more disappointing was my husband's meal. He wanted to stay away from seafood and stick to pasta and chicken, so the waiter said that he could do the \"Fettuccine Seafood Alfredo with Lobster, Prawns & Scallops\" from the menu, no seafood, and replace with chicken. Both my sister-in-law and my husband ordered the waiter's suggestion. When my husband and sister-in-law got his meal, however, it was as if the chef removed the scallops and slapped some chicken on top of it. The meal was fishy, exactly what we were trying to avoid. When we spoke with the waiter about the matter, he said that there was no way the meal had any seafood. What?! The waiter made both my sister-in-law and husband look like liars; very embarrassing in front of our large group of friends. And to top it all off, the waiter did not even bother calling his manager for assistance or replacing the meal with something else. So practically, we were stuck paying for a meal that we did not eat. And you call this fine dining? I don't think so!  And finally, the entire group and I were pretty upset when we noticed that directly across from us was a table with a group as big as ours receiving totally different service than we were just because there was some type of minor league baseball player in their group. The manager was showing them their different champagnes, catering to their every need. How is that fair? Shouldn't all the customers receive the same service?   In conclusion, I would only recommend this place for their view, but definitely not for a nice dining experience!",

We had gone at night and it was just very beautiful evening to be sitting 1000 feet or so in the air, eating dinner, and having the entire restaurant rotate around Las Vegas. The view was just spectacular.   You know dinner was a little expensive, but it was worth every dime. If you have never been there before, not only is the restaurant located around 1000 feet in the air, but there is an entire amusement park of sorts above the restaurant. Yes, that shocked me to when I found out.  As a matter of fact, while I was eating I kept hearing this faint noise from time to time and eventually asked the server what sound was and that is how I found out.   I don't know how much things have changed since then, but I had a great a experience back then and it is worth going back if I go back to Vegas again.",

    "text": "Worst experience ever! Decided to take my family here for our Thanksgiving dinner. Had a reservation for 9 people, which was made months in advance. Got there on time for our 7:30 reservation and was given a pager and asked to wait in the upper lounge, not once in the 40 minutes we waited did a waitress ever come by to offer us drinks. After 45 minutes the pager we were given went off and we went back down to be seated. I was greeted by 4 hostesses who took the pager and then asked my family to move out of the way as they were not ready for us. After making sure they understood we had been waiting over 45 minutes for a reservation we were finally seated. The manager at that time decided to finally acknowledge the absurdity of the situation and offered us a free bottle of wine. We then ordered, which most of us got the Thanksgiving special which should have been a very quick turn around for them. It was not, and 2 hours after our reservation we still had not been served our entrees. In that time our waiter avoided our table, and did not refill our water glasses at any point. Needless to say we decided at that point to leave. I figured they would at least comp the one bottle of wine ordered as my family's entire evening had been ruined, but no they handed me the check for it. So we ended our evening going to a crummy dinner and having burgers for our Thanksgiving meal. The whole experience was beyond disappointing as my family and I came from all over the globe to meet and have a nice dinner and instead ended up just trying to find a place that we could sit at a table together. The view might be nice, but everything else was a nightmare experience and I would not recommend this place to anyone. For a restaurant that runs $100 per person, you would never expect to have this type of experience.",

Yes-it's not at the best hotel (the hole in the wall Stratosphere)  and furthest away from the strip (North end), but for the price and atmosphere, it's great for any occasion or celebration.  I have taken my family, friends and planned a bachelorette dinner here.  Brunch prices are $9-$22 and dinner prices are $30-$50, drinks are $15.  The prices are reasonable and the quality food is excellent.  The restaurant revolves 360 degrees, if you get motion sickness, request to dine away from the window.  Great place to enjoy the city views, take pictures, and enjoy good food without breaking your bank.  Reservations are recommended.  We get a lot of wind/dust in Vegas, so make sure you go when it's not windy, the dust will just ruin the views.  Also with your reservations, you can go to the observatory deck and go outside (where the rides are) and take pictures.   If you don't want to pay the high dinner prices, go to brunch.   It will be under $30 per person.  I actually enjoy dinng here during the day as you can see more of the strip and the whole city of Las Vegas.  You can even see the people walking below you on the strip (they look like ants, hehe!)",

I got the roast chicken and it was swimming in some funky sauce.  I didn't even bother to eat the salad because it smelled like feet.  Dessert was decent but it was the meal's only saving grace.        I was sitting at a four person table with two people and the wait staff knocked into me a couple of times.  You'd think they would have mastered walking in between the spinning part and non-spinning part of the place.  I was told one of the windows was shot out and they could not replace it.  (How ghetto is that?)  How did they get the windows in in the first place?  Can't put in another one, now the wind whips and rattles a black board stuffed up in there.  Kind of distracting when your trying to have a nice meal.        There are some people walking around taking pictures, don't do it.  It's a total rip-off.  Our pictures were blurry and made us look really shinny.  Some even had red eye.  One had a waiter in the back ground and I was told I could go home and just cut up the pictures.  Seventy eight bucks for two photos and two wallets is insane, especially when they suck.  If it wasn't my anniversary and my husband wanting them I probably would have told them to forget it.      Not coming back here.  The view is not worth it.  I'd go back to the Voodoo Lounge because they have a view too, and food you'd actually want to eat.",

    "text": "Second time to restaurant.  First was very enjoyable with the best views Vegas has to offer.  This time, the views still incredible. Food, not so much. Ordered the rib eye, medium.  The steak was bland with no flavor.  Truly ate maybe three bites. Oddly, waiter never asked if any of us at our table enjoyed the meal or not.  Wasn't looking for anything other than a great meal. Would of thought some steak sauce or something to add to the steak would of been nice to suggest. Others at table agreed, bland food overall.  Still, views are enjoyable.  Just need help in kicking it up a little and adding a touch of care from the customer service point of view.  With that being said, I'll check it off of my list, noting the incredible views, and move on to the many other restaurants as I don't believe I'd return.",

Wow, were we surprised! First, the table we got was right on the window.  A spectacular place to get a 360 degree view of Vegas. Our waiter was extremely friendly, chatty and professional. He gave us a \"tip\" that our having dinner there gets us access up onto the obese action deck after dinner. We looked forward to that.  We both ordered the filet, my husband also got the shrimp scampi.  We subbed bearnaise sauce for the wine mushroom sauce, and that bearnaise sauce was to die for! Fantastic. While we ate, e room rotated so that by sunset we were facing the Vegas strip, and the lights were just starting to come on. Again, what a view! We got to see a couple of bungy jumpers leap off the platform too, which was startling. The dessert offerings were varied, and I settled on the \"white chocolate lemon cheesecake\". The portion size was way too big, and while I'm a big fan of lemon, there wasn't enough lemon flavor in it for my taste. It was just ok.  The rest of the meal was great, and the service very professional.",

For the entree I got the lamb chops which was simply a AHHHHMAZING. The flavors and worked harmoniously with the lamb meat, it was simply amazing with every bite. If the meat is done so well with flavors then you over look the price as then it was totally worth it. I will definitely recommend this restaurant as it was an amazing experience.

    "text": "There's really no point of a reservation with this place. We had a reservation for 6:45 and showed up half an hour early at 6:15. We were instructed to wait at the bar for half an hour until our reservation. I approached the front desk at 6:45 again and they told me at least 15 more minutes, so we waited and waited, yet we did not get seated until 7:15. The hostess at the stand was also rude when I checked in with her at 6:45 and refused to talk to us when bringing us to our seats. It's usually not a big deal for us to wait but we didn't eat dinner comfortably because we had a 9:00 Vegas show and felt rushed since we were seated so late. We also spoke to some other folks while waiting: one man had a reservation at 6:30 and was told to wait an extra 45 minutes. Overall, this place has a terrible reservation system and does not accommodate their guest's schedules as long as you spend your money there. However, while spending time waiting at the bar, we could see many tables open..  The food was good, we just didn't enjoy it as much as we did because of the time constraint. For a four course meal that had to be scarfed down since we were seated so late, we just didn't find the value in paying so much for it. However, our server was phenomenal and so was the photographer.  My recommendation is that if you want to take advantage of the full dining experience at this place, just make sure you don't have any other set plans at night.  Two stars for the food, service, and view.",

    "text": "I ate here once as a tourist and it was on my to do list for a number of years.  I was seated promptly and my server, Mirella, came by to ask for drink order and questions about the menu.  I ordered the chef's tasting menu with the following choices:  lobster bisque, Kurobuta pork belly, filet mignon and shrimp scampi, and a chocolate duo for dessert.  I was soon brought a small bread basket--two rolls and a piece of lavash along with three butter florets, one sweet, one pesto flavored, and the third was ginger peach.  The best was the pesto but it's best to let the butter come closer to room temperature to get the most of the flavors.  I'm glad they downsized the bread basket for one person.  It's smarter than bringing a regular basket and a lot of it goes back.  The lobster bisque was a win.  There was a fair amount of lobster and the broth was good.  The pork belly was a let down.  The menu says that it has root vegetables, farro, quinoa, chimichurri, Chinese five spice.  All these ingredients tended to overpower the pork belly, not enhance it.  The filet was cooked blue as I ordered.  It and two shrimp scampi were served on a  bed of mashed potatoes along with some green beans.  The steak had a red wine reduction and I'd say this was the best part of the meal.  There is no choice for dessert--it's a chocolate duo consisting of two chocolate dishes.  One is a dark chocolate pot de creme--very rich and very good.  The other was a white chocolate shaped cup holding some fresh berries and vanilla mousseline.  Service was excellent during the meal.  Mirella brought me a fresh glass of iced tea before I asked for a refill and she was there to refill my coffee with dessert.  The view is great.  I found myself less concentrated on looking at Las Vegas Boulevard and the Strip hotels and more of the neighborhoods.  The tourists were all taking photos of the Strip.  The meal was A-OK but you're paying Strip prices plus an extra for the view.  The bonus is you have access to the rooftop observation deck after dinner.  If you subtract the $12 cost of just going up the tower for the view, the price is a bit better.",

    "text": "Only only gets 3 stars for its view!   Also FYI, this is a moving restaurant, it's subtle but the platform still moves.  Let's start with the process on getting up to top of the world. First you have to go through a metal detector, something they started since 9/11. Then you get to the host stand, no place to stand to wait for your table. If there are tons of people waiting for their table or the elevators which there were, you feel like a sardine.   Service was only par. For being a $$$$ restaurant you would expect immaculate service.   I would say the same for food. My husband and I always share meals so we started with a wedge salad which is is favorite not mine. Presentation of the salad (picture added) was pretty but the dressing was not good and there was barely any toppings. I think they counted out the pieces of bacon they put on their salad, there was 5.   Portobello mushrooms app was not good either. It seemed as though the mushrooms and tomatoes should have been warm but they were in between temperatures so it was strange. Didn't know if it should be cold or hot app.  The filet comes with a red wine reduction on top and we opted to have that removed. Probably a bad item because the meat was dry and a bit tough. Something a filet medium rare should not be.  Yukon potatoes were creamy and I will say our dessert (picture added) was delicious. Mixing creme brulee and cheesecake together was yummy.   I would recommend tourist or first timers here for the experience and view. Try something else besides steaks.",

I booked my reservation through Open Table about two months and made sure I requested for a table next to the windows.  The day of our reservation, I changed our reservation time twice..so I was a bit worried that I was going to lose out on the table I requested for but thank goodness I didn't! Upon arrival to the restaurant, we were seated immediately by the hostess, and the view is absolutely breathtaking!!  The view is so stunning I couldn't even focus ordering from the menu lol, but finally decided on:   appetizer - Seafood Platter main entree - surf n turf (filet mignon, medium rare, just how I like it)  main entree - ribeye  glass of pinot grigio hennessy on the rocks   There is also a photographer that goes around taking pictures which you have the option to buy towards the end of dinner ...which I would suggest since it makes a great souvenir!    Also,  be aware that you may see a few bungee jumpers during your dining experience as well and the restaurant revolves at a full 360 degrees every 80 minutes...which I barely even felt.  Only downfall that I would have to say is that I wish the Stratosphere was closer to the center of the strip.  Other than that, I had an amazing time =)",

Positives:  1) Wait staff was friendly and gave great dining recommendations 2) Presentation and flavor of lobster bisque was awesome 3) Views are obviously spectacular  Negatives: 1) Not an inexpensive evening  As I knew what to expect from a cost perspective, I was thrilled to find that all other aspects of the dining experience to be on point, from the greeting when we arrived by the folks at the host/hostess station to the words from the same folks as we departed at the end of the evening.  I've been to many of the \"awesome\" restaurants in Vegas, and I'd put my experience here right at or near the top of the list.  A great night out - Thanks!",

I would recommend coming after it's dark because depending on which side of the table you're sitting you, you can get blinded by the sun. The view from the restaurant at night is beautiful. It spins slowly enough so that you can enjoy the sights and not get horrible vertigo.  The service is amazing. The food is great, but comparable to the other fine dining restaurants on the strip. You would come here to have a relaxing drawn out dinner, enjoy the company you're with, and get some good food at the same time.",

    "text": "Wanted to treat my husband for his 30th birthday. We had the kids with us (ages 4, 3, and 1) so I made reservations for a late lunch on a weekday, thinking that would be the most child-friendly time. Confirmed with the hostess on the phone that this was acceptable, but got blatantly-annoyed eyerolls from the waitress when we walked in.  We write about family travel for a living, so our boys are extremely well-behaved and used to being in settings like this. The one time the baby fussed, I took him to the restroom for a break. Seems our group had already been judged, though, as the waitress was inattentive throughout our meal and walked away when were mid-sentence no less then 4 times. On one occasion she asked if we had questions about a dish and then immediately walked away to help a table of 50-something-year-olds right behind us as I desperately trailed a question in her direction. That's something I'd expect from a restaurant that hires 17-year-olds on roller skates, not an $80-dollar-per-plate establishment that serves filet mignon rare.  The food was decent. The view was stunning. Getting access to the observatory was a nice bonus. I just wish we hadn't been treated like second-class citizens. After being ignored for at least two-thirds of our 80-minute rotation and helped primarily by the gentleman who filled our drinks (thanks Maurice!) we skipped dessert. In spite of our children's excitement and desire for the colorful sorbet on the table next to us and the mouth-watering creme brulee that rotated by on display, we decided to forego dessert to save us another 30 minutes of \"taking up someone's time.\"",

As a business owner my husband and I have had many meeting at different restaurant locations and experience good customer service but nothing like this waiter.

Our kids where amazed by the way this waiter spoke, he had amazing manners from pardon my reach when he was serving our food to being very informational when it came to Las Vegas and their food.

The view is alright, we arrived just before the sunset so by the time we were eating our first course, we were looking at east vegas. Yikes. The food was outstanding and the wine pairing was divine! We were seated promptly even though we were ten minutes late on the Saturday evening before Valentine's Day. Our table was very small but it's an observation tower so *shrug*. We were greeted by Rebecca and she is the best server I've ever had in fine dining. Very informative and attentive she made our whole evening! She recommended the prefixe menu with the wine pairing. My boyfriend and I both had the lobster bisque, scallops, portobello mushroom, filet mignon with the gulf shrimp, and for dessert, a white chocolate bowl with fruit and cream. We finished our night with Pinot Grigio and a Fat Tire.   Lobster bisque- presentation was beautiful, lobster tasted kind of chalky, it was good not great.  Scallops- good, slightly on the chewy side. The Fish Hopper in Carmel has the best scallops so my standard is already pretty high. There was only one scallop, but it's a prefixe I get it. Portobello mushroom- I hate mushrooms but my boyfriend loves them and it wasn't that bad. The plate had three slices of mushroom served with roasted tomato, mozzarella and balsamic vinegar.  Filet mignon with gulf shrimp- medium rare, this dish took the longest but with the wine parings we had, time seemed slow anyway! This steak is huge. I'm so sad I couldn't finish it! It had a delicious mushroom sauce that went well with the buttery mashed potatoes and a. The gulf shrimp was not peeled so that was agitating because it's fine dining. Would you want to eat feces if you had a choice? Exactly. I took out the nasty stuff and continued eating. Super juicy and succulent every bite was heaven. White chocolate bowl with fruit and cream- just that. Nothing gourmet or decedent. It also came with a small bowl that had a dark chocolate ganache that tasted like powered Swiss Miss and two small white chocolate decorations on top. Nothing to write home about, it was way too much sugar for me. I prefer a balance.  The wine- Rebecca served us just as the meals came out and gave a detailed description of the glasses. I could have went with the Cabernet but it's steak so I couldn't fight. The first wine she gave us was a Pinot Grigio from France? It was so ideal, my taste buds fell exactly in line and it was the perfect set up for the rest of the food that followed. I had the best Valentine's dinner with my sweetheart thanks to Rebecca. We definitely felt on top of the world",

When I checked in upstairs, another guest came out of the restaurant wanting a different seat, I was told I was set and to take a seat by the elevators. People came in and out of the restaurant (I figured guests with reservations) and I waited about 20 mins until the host looked at me and said, \"Do you need help? Oh, no wait, you ate already\". I answered,  \"No, I checked in a while ago, you told me to sit here\". The host apologized and searched my name in the system not knowing what happened. I made the excuse for them, \"That guest that wanted different seats must have distracted the check in process, it happens\". So, they made a big deal to get me a \"good seat\" (by the window - at the hotel I was staying at... With a view I've seen several times on this trip...that I mentioned when I checked in).  The view was gorgeous none-the-less but as soon as I sat down, a waiter dropped a plate of food, picking up only the big pieces.   I ordered a glass of wine, the Lobster Bisque and Steak and Lobster.  The Lobster Bisque was devine though some parts of the meat were cold while other parts were warm. And the steak and lobster was perfect as well.   While I was eating, my water was never filled and a different waitress broke a wine glass (again, only picking up the big pieces). While enjoying the food and view all the waiters (3 in our area) are speaking on the different restaurant levels in Spanish rather loudly.   When I was done, the waitress that broke the glass asked if I was done and when I said yes, she took my plate away which I thought was strange. I had quite a bit of food left and I felt like for a place like this, wasting food wouldn't be an option. (I would have loved to finish left overs!)  While waiting for check, my waiter was bringing food to another table where he dropped the food cover.   I thought this restaurant staff was VERY careless and I left uneasy about my experience.",

The bar maid and wait staff service was impressive. Acute to the smallest of details. Made the experience very enjoyable. The food - we had the lobster bisque based on other reviews. Yes! Get it!! The presentation to the taste was fantastic. Dinner was a mix of dishes ordered. Several steaks, lamb and seafood.  - Lamb, was very tasty but over cooked to request. Asked for med rare and it was well done. I would have sent it back but it was still very tasty so I was OK with it. - Steaks, most had the NY Strip and I heard all highly positive comments. One ordered the rib eye and said it was just OK. Not bad but not great either. He felt it was the type of steak and wished he ordered the strip instead. - Seafood pasta dishes, both gave positive comments  I saw some Yelp comments on tepid temp food being served. Not us. Soups and meals all hot.   Summary: great atmosphere, epic Las Vegas views, really good food. Also I felt was another bonus was the restaurant is a quick and easy walk from the hotel's front doors. Having been to many LV hotel restaurants with clients, you can find yourself walking for 15+ minutes through smelly, smokey casinos to get to the restaurant. This one was quick and easy.",

Porcini Crusted, Pan Seared Sea Bass. Another very good course.   Dessert  I was expecting Berry Delight, which was the dessert listed with the special I ordered, but my server brought out the Chocolate Stratosphere Mousse! When I asked him why, he said he saw my reaction when he brought the Mousse to another table and thought I would like it more. He definitely was right!   I really like the fact that they don't just rely on the novelty factor of a rotating restaurant. We have one in Milwaukee and the food is barely passable. Top of The World is wheelchair accessible, and even at lunch, the view was wonderful!",

The server brought me a steak knife. This is equivalent to putting steak sauce on an steak but this is supposed to be a top level steakhouse. He thought I'd never been given a steak knife like that before and chuckled when I was shocked to see it. I thought that was funny because yes, I was shocked to see it... IN A FINE DINING STEAKHOUSE. Lol. It claims it's steak is wagyu so I ordered it medium. It was medium well and almost well. Was good but I doubt it was really what they said. First off, the price for an 10 oz cut was very very low at $65. I was told that this was where the casino makes its money. If they are selling wagyu steak for that price, I kinda doubt they are making any money on it. The server was really nice just inexperienced. I don't think it's his fault as he is probably told what to say and the head just hopes that the customers will be bedazzled by the rotating room, which BTW, takes an hour to acclimate to if you are near the edge. I felt like I needed a seatbelt while sitting in my chair. Although the atmosphere is cool and the windows are fun to look down through, I was disappointed with the food itself.",

Killing two+ hours for dinner is easy; so you can take in all of the views. Plan on arriving an hour before sunset to enjoy the view during the day, the sunset and then the Vegas lights by night.  Food quality is always outstanding, the service is always top notch and the cost is on par with any other establishment of this caliber in Vegas.  The two things that keep me at 4 stars are:  1. Kind of funky feel of having people bungy jump by your window while eating.  2. Restaurant & Lounge are great; rest of casino and hotel as a little cheesey (although it does look like they are trying to bump up the style).  All things considred; we'll keep visiting when ever we find ourselves in Vegas!  Cheers!",

    "text": "The view alone is worth a million bucks!  I wanted to take my wife somewhere nice, and somewhere we have never been before so I decided on taking her here for lunch.  It was a perfect date!  I made some reservations on <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FOpentable.com&s=e2215de09505b8fbf3a047b68af38708cbc8b52c843ab34faaecc46b3704d557\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Opentable.com</a> for 12:30.  We got there early and it wasn't that busy so they told us to head on up.  To get there is a mission in itself.  You are lead over to a metal detector where a security guard asks you to empty out your pockets etc.   You are then led to the elevator and you get in. Up to floor 106!   You exit the elevator and then are greeted by the hostess and led to your table.  You cant even put into words what the view is like.  You are almost 900 feet up, in a revolving restaurant and you can see for what seems like an infinite distance!  Its a sight to see and if you are in Vegas, you have to come here at least one time...you will be glad you did! The restaurant rotates very slow.  It takes an hour and twenty minutes to make a full 360 so if you take your time eating lunch, you can see all of Las Vegas.  Its such an amazing sight to see.  Words cant describe it.   As far as the food...........  For an appetizer, I ordered the flash fried calamari.  I rarely get to eat calamari and wanted to try theirs out.  It comes with 2 different sauces, a wasabi white sauce and a tomato sauce.  I liked the tomato one better.  I ate all of it because the wife doesn't like seafood and it was an excellent starter.  They also give you some cibatta bread with regular butter and a chili butter.  Good stuff!   For our entrees, I went with the burger and got it topped with the horseradish crust and fried onion strings.  It came with french fries too.  The burger was cooked perfectly medium and was tasty as can be.  The wife ordered their pesto pasta with chicken.  She let me have some and it was really good too.  The service was spot on, very attentive.  Total bill after tip was about $65 for lunch which seems like a lot, but once you get up to that restaurant and sit down, its totally worth the money!    Added bonus, you can go up to the top floor and go outside on the deck after you are done.  If you want to go up there by itself, I think it was either $14 or $16 per person so getting lunch for only $30 bucks more is a bargain in itself.   It was a great experience and I will definitely come back and recommend this to everyone I know!",

First of all, Yes, you are very high up and the view is pretty cool as well as the fact that the floor revolves.... BUT....  It is veryy expensive! Their cheapest entrees were in the 20s, their Caesar Salad was $12 ... for a salad!?! For some people that may not be a lot, but for ME it is! Just because you are up really high in the sky means you have to pay out the ass for food? Me thinks not! ... Personally when I saw my friends meals I was glad I didn't order anything - It didnt look worth the money and my friend ended up not feeling well afterwards.  My friend said \"all you're paying for is the experience\" .. Well I've been to restaurants at the same price with better service, food and had a better \"experience!\" If it means not having a view then so be it! Why does the restaurant think the view makes up for all of that?  Anywayss.. The interior is very drab, looks like it's from the 80s, dark colors, they tried brightening the place up with white tablecloths, but that doesn't help when the lighting is so low you can barely see your plate - I feel like theyre trying to hide something. Also, they weren't playing any music, it was kind of awkward so I put a Jazz Pandora station on my phone so we didn't feel so awkward.. At one poing a live band started playing upstairs somewhere, but it was just in one spot  (they dont revolve) so the sound was quiet then loud when you got closer.. just weird.  Overall I was very dissappointed with the \"restaurant\" when I walked in, it really needs to be renovated! If you want the \"experience\" go for it, but I honestly don't think it's worth your time or money :(",

    "text": "If you like a good view and can handle being extremely high up, then the Top of the World is an impressive place to dine and experience some of the best Vegas has to offer.  Most people don't have high expectations (pun) of this restaurant given its location at the Stratosphere, but first timers seem fairly surprised and impressed as the place features beautiful decor, a fabulous view, excellent service, and food.  My favorite item here is their delicious filet mignon.  It was cooked just perfectly (medium rare), with just enough juice, savoring the succulent flavor the poor cow had waiting for me.  Its easy to split a bottle of wine with a romantic date here as it can get incredible intimate here and with a beautiful strip view, full of lights and glamour, it makes for a very interesting proposal spot (which I'm told happens weekly here).",

    "text": "The view is phenomenal, food can be purchased from any 24 hour diner. Steak no flavor. Mashed potatoes from a box etc....etc......you get the idea, except instead of paying $7.99 for steak you'll pay $60. Typical vegas turn and burn.",

    "text": "The atmosphere was GREAT! The staff were super kind to our young children in tow. It's hard to travel through Vegas with Littles, especially those potty training, but they were patient with us. Our server, Joey, was very polite--but WAY too apologetic for everything. Even though nothing was wrong. The seafood sampler was amazing but our lamb and New York strip were just a tad overcooked and lacked flavor. Loved the view and the little guys LOVED being as high as helicopters! A good night overall",
