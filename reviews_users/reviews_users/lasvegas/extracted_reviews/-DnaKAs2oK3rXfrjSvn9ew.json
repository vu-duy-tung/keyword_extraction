    "text": "Tokyo Cafe is the most recent business to give it a try in this tenant space.  I remember this address being a Guamanian restaurant, an Italian/Chinese restaurant, a wannabe Panda Express restaurant, and now it's a Japanese restaurant.  This is potentially the best one of the bunch.  For those of you living in North Las Vegas, the most significant thing about Tokyo Cafe is that (to my knowledge) they are the only ones serving a \"real\" bowl of ramen in this part of town.  Choice of tonkotsu, shoyu, or miso broths, chashu pork, soft boild eggs, seaweed, bamboo shoots; it's mostly all there.  I've had the miso ramen, which actually looked and tasted like a shoyu ramen.  The broth had decent but light flavor, which had me adding plenty of garlic and togarashi.  The chashu was tender, small in portion, and light on flavor.  Noodles were overcooked and past al dente.  The menu also offers some other noodle dishes, and some curry dishes, along with a few appetizers.  Based on the one dish I've had, I can at least take it for what it is, and acknowledge that this is probably the best/only choice for ramen in North Las Vegas.  It was decent enough that I'll be sure to return and try their other offerings; otherwise, make the drive out to Chinatown for full satisfaction.",

We were chomping down on chicken katsu curry and pork katsu udon when a homeless man walked in and sat down on a bench. I kept looking over thinking I should either complain about him or offer to buy him food... I would decide after I was done eating. (The guy wasn't bothering anybody but I think I was mildly annoyed that none of the staff noticed him.) Out of nowhere the homeless man got up and started coming towards us and instead went to the counter where one of the older gentlemen that worked there had left the man a box full of food. The homeless man took the food, bowed thank you and left. Very awesome that they do this type of thing on a regular basis since the homeless man never spoke a word about wanting food and they seemed to have a routine. Would defs go back for the food and for the feeling of a moral compass polishing. I also liked the pork katsu curry way more (spice 4) than the chicken katsu curry (spice 3). PS the garlic sauce condiment is bomb, ask the homeless guy. (jk)",

Ordered veggie fried rice, tempura veggies and tonkatsu ramen.  Food came out quick, like in 5 minutes!  First bite was the ramen, excellent!! The broth was superb with flavor that was layered with ginger, onion, garlic and pork. It was the perfect place for those noodles that were also perfect.  Next bite which looked like a carrot turned out to be tempura sweet potatoe. So crispy and wonderfully salty in a good way. The tempura zuchini and carrots were good too.  Last but not least was the veggie fried rice which was so good , I couldn't stop shoveling it in my mouth with my soup spoon. It was light and full of veggies.  This place is a \"hole in the wall\" but one that gets 4 stars.   They could charge double and I would pay for it.  You gotta check this place out!!",

This place reminds me so much of those hole in the wall places in Okinawa. Ordered a spicy miso ramen for takeout. In less than 15mins we were out the door. Everyone was super friendly too. Couldn't wait to get home to inhale my ramen. I was surprised by how much food there was. The broth was pretty good but I think it needs a little more miso. FYI, they are not kidding about the \"spicy\" part. It is spicy good. I liked that they had the noodles in a separate container.  So glad we have a ramen place in our side of town now. No more trips to Chinatown for my ramen cravings. Their prices are very affordable too.   We'll be back. Next time I'm going to try their tonkotsu ramen and some gyoza and maybe a boba too.

Yeah, well it got me on Thursday, so I #obvi needed some ramen in my life. Living in the North, this really isn't a great problem to have....except I remembered seeing that Tokyo Cafe offered ramen, and they're pretty new....so why not?  When we arrived, we were the only people in the whole place. The place smelled like Pine Sol - and I could think of at least 78 things that smell worse than Pine Sol in a restaurant - so far so good. The staff was super friendly. Their menu offerings are listed on the back wall (not all spelled correctly, but we could totally get the gist). I ordered the shoyu ramen, seaweed salad, fried gyoza and a teriyaki chicken bowl to go. The bill was under $30.   As we waited for our food, I checked into Yelp and two people came in - they were clearly excited to order, and kept talking about what they got last time versus what their friend Karen got here every time, and maybe they would also try this....it was reassuring to hear people talking so positively about a place when we were the only ones there at dinner time.   The food came out in a cardboard box - which I have never had happen before - it was fun. The guy went through the order to make sure nothing was missing, and when he realized the nori wasn't there, he ran back to get it for us.   When we got home, we found that the noodles were packaged separately from the broth - brilliant. They weren't bloated and overcooked - they were just right when I added them in. They had a pre-made texture to them, definitely didn't feel fresh on the palate - but I was not complaining, because the broth made my body feel well and I liked the flavor. It was exactly what I wanted and needed. The gyoza was good, too! Not too spicy, not greasy at all - actually quite a treat. My husband, who by-the-way loves chicken teriyaki bowls, says that this is the best he's ever had. The chicken was plentiful, it came with a salad, and he was shocked at the serving size - saying 'If this is a bowl, I can't imagine what a plate looks like!' I saved the seaweed salad and half of my ramen for the following day, as I spent it home from work on the couch, and it was the perfect way to start my day.   We'll be back over and over again. It's not Monta Ramen, but it's great in a pinch. We were incredibly pleased with what we found here. Thanks for coming to the neighborhood!",

    "text": "A mom and pop looking restaurant with good ramen? Don't judge a book by its cover!  I ordered for a party of 12ish to go and was already getting anxious that my order would be messed up. We ordered ramen, chicken katsu, and some milk teas.  The gentleman taking my order was patient and before we hung up, he reread all my orders to me with the correct add ins and omitted ingredients for each order.  The ramen is separated from the broth, and your seaweed is also packaged separately. For the katsu, the curry is separate and if you don't know how spicy they will make it, you can ask for it on the side as well.  I appreciate the separation of everything without having to request for it.  I ordered the tonkotsu ramen with an extra egg and spicy. The ramen is not over cooked so it still has the chew to it - just the way it should be. One of my eggs was completely cooked through while the other one still had a semi-cooked yolk, which I love!   The broth is savory and exactly how I asked for it: spicy. It's a good spice where your nose is running at the end of the bowl but doesn't make you cry or prevent you from eating more throughout. The broth has bamboo shoots, mushrooms (I want to say it's wood eat mushrooms? I could be wrong), and two slices of melt in your mouth chasu pork! I wish there was more pork but I could do without it.  My taro milk tea was average, nothing fancy. $3.99 for a cup though is a bit pricey but their cups are like larges for OC milk tea.  Overall, my family's ramen cravings were satisfied and I think we're all glad this place was near our weekend stay in North LV :)",

The food is good and consistent. Ive had pretty much everything here - and let me tell you -- it's the best prices in town! The teriyaki is always juicy and fresh. The ramen is never mushy. The miso and shoyu ramen are super tasty. The veggies are fresh and crispy. The soba is to die for.  Both the cold and stir fried Yaki Soba are delicious. 1 order is enough for 2 people to share.   Service is friendly. Atmosphere is quiet and never too busy.   The one thing this place needs to improve on is their boba drinks. I've had both the Thai tea and milk tea - both of which is sugar overload. Drinks are premade and can not be adjusted. When asking for less sweet -- I was told it's not possible since it's premixed. Of you're looking for an authentic boba tea - look elsewhere. Their sugary drinks tastes like flavored milk with a ton of sweetener. But if you're in the mood for ramen or soba -- this is the go to spot!",

The ambiance is casual, not as clean as I'd like, but the staff was friendly and the food came out within 20 minutes.    $6.99 Chicken Katsu Curry- PLENTY of rice, a nice-sized container of runny curry that was packaged separately, and the chicken was hot, crispy, and tender, if not a bit bland. I much prefer the version at Curry Zen.  There was also a pile of cabbage in the corner of the container that had began to turn.  Lovely garnish, thanks.    $6.99 Shoyu Ramen - When you get it to-go the noodles are packaged separately from the broth, and the seaweed is separated as well.  I appreciate the thought that went into that.  There was a half an egg in mine and two pieces of unknown meat.  The noodles have a great firm texture. The broth was mild.  It seems very home-made.     Milk tea with boba....oh lordy...pretty bad.  So sugary it made me nauseated even though I loves me some sugar.  All I wanted to do was dump half of it out and fill it back up with milk or water to dilute it---it was that bad.  And I dunno what's up with their straws but I wasn't able to pull up any boba with it unless I aimed it at the boba and stabbed it.  I would not order this again.    I do appreciate having this type of food outside of the spring mountain area.  It's a one and done for me.",

I ordered a beef teriyaki plate with a side of fried gyozas and seaweed salad.   The beef teriyaki was a bit over drenched with sauce (made it a tad salty). But, was still fulfilling for my teriyaki fix. The side salad was good, lightly dressed with a ginger vinaigrette. The appetizers I ordered were on point. I didn't try their ramen noodles this time around.  I will definitely give there noodles a shot on my next visit. Overall, Tokyo Cafe is the go to spot to soothe any Japanese cuisine cravings.",

No one was eating in, there were people waiting for to go orders. The weather was horrible that day so, that didn't surprise me.   We ordered the tonkotsu ramen  it was great! Flaw or was amazing, it had plenty of noodles and fixings! My mom ordered the veggie tempura udon soup! Mmmmm I almost regretted having ramen after tasting the udon. Tempura was Krispy you could tell it was not store bought or frozen. To go we orders chicken fried rice. The rice didn't have much color to it, which in my opinion is good. I hate rice that has overwhelming soy sauce flavor. This rice was great. The chicken to rice ratio was great and the portions on their meals are a steal for the price they are charging. Not one thing is priced over $8.00!!!",

I always order it extra spicy...it comes super duper spicy and I love it! Usually places are afraid to make things that spicy especially when a 120 pound Asian women is ordering it.

It's a nice quiet little cafe that seem to just open recently. Great place to get Thai tea or even ramune soda pop. Their customer service is definitely a plus. Really friendly and all smiles.

We also ordered their shoyu ramen and chicken teriyaki. Everything is good and the price is great! We always order to-go, because their place is small. When we ordered the ramen, they separated the soup, so it's still good when we ate at home. Ordering on the phone is fast and easy. They are very friendly!",

    "text": "As someone that once worked in many a Japanese restaurant, I will say that this place is the real deal when it comes to Japanese food. You can tell that the workers in the restaurant have cooked Japanese food for quite some time, and this is evident in not only the presentation, but also the flavors.   The pricing is extremely reasonable, with the average meal around $9 (which is also well balanced, considering that they serve up a small side salad with the entree). As my good friend noted, the ambiance is \"like being in an anime\", in regards to the music, and the food. This is secretly one of my date night spots, amongst all the other establishments in the vicinity.  There are very few places that I will consistently return to for dining; this is one of them!",

The shrimp and veggie tempura rivals anywhere on the Strip or in Shibuya. Gyoza is a must have. Yakisoba is authentic, right out of the alleys in Shitamachi. I can't wait to come back. And I will as often as I can. Gochi soo sama deshita!",

    "text": "I was surprised when I recently found this place on Yelp since it's just a few miles from where I work and had somehow missed it for years.  Don't let the appearance fool you:  the place is kind of hiding in plain sight, but the food is wonderful.  The menu is great and the price is right.  Walk up to the counter, place your order, grab a seat and wait for the deliciousness!  Here's the scoop on some favorites so far:  Miso Ramen -- Delicious, and more than enough for lunch!  Grab some chop sticks to accompany your spoon and settle in.  Don't be in a hurry; just savor the flavor.  This is probably my favorite thing so far.  Chicken Soba -- A close second.  When I'm not in the mood for soup, the chicken soba is delicious.  As with the soup, they're going to serve you a lot so plan accordingly.  This is a great dish to take some home with you though, so don't worry about finishing it all.  Next on my list to try:  the Chicken Katsu.  Based on what I've tasted so far, and what I've seen brought to other customers, it's going to be delicious too.  Parking is basically behind the restaurant and shared with the other nearby businesses, but there's always plenty of slots open.  Access back onto Craig Road can be a little bit of a hassle if it's a busy time of day.  If you're on the northeast side of town and have a craving for noodles, give this place a try.  It's a pleasant break from all the usual fast food chains that seem to dominate the area.  Enjoy!",

    "text": "Ah finally a decently tasty Asian lunch option near my work! There's honestly not too much to chose from around this area other then fast food so a place that offers ramen, udon, tempura vegetables and a few other options is very refreshing.   Overall the esthetic of this place isn't super snazzy, but the food is good. When you walk in there's several tables and a self service drink area. You place your order at the counter in the front and then they bring it out to your table once it's ready. The employees are very friendly and the service is pretty quick even during lunch time.  As for the food I can't complain. The portion sizes are huge and the prices are very reasonable. I opted for the tonkasu spicy ramen this time around and it was very good. I loved the broth flavor and they definitely don't skimp on the other toppings. A great little hidden gem in North Las Vegas!",

I had the Shoyu Ramen with extra Chashu, extra egg and extra noodles. The noodles, soft boiled eggs and chashu were excellent. The broth was very flavorful, just short of perfect. Also, the broth was just between warm and hot. If they served it piping hot, it would have been much better. They did not have white pepper which should be offered automatically with Ramen. The steamed gyoza and milk tea were also very good. Can't wait to go back and try their udon and curry. So happy to have a Japanese comfort food restaurant in the neighborhood.",

The broth flavorful, the noodles cooked perfectly so that you had that very slight chewiness. The pork was so tender it melted in my mouth with intense flavor. The gyoza was spot on delicious.  It was just what i was looking for as i used to live in Japan for 15 years and i have missed that authentic ramen taste. Tokyo Cafe is so close to my house, i know I will be coming back again very soon. I recommend you stop by.",

Anyway, we tried again on a weekday and there were a couple families eating. It is a pretty limited seating area, but I don't forsee anyone having to wait for seating because I can't imagine it getting THAT busy in here.   The service was friendly so first impression--good. I ordered the shoyu ramen and the hubby had the tonkatsu. I seriously felt as if there wasn't a clear distinction between the two. My husband's broth almost tasted like my broth vice versa. I also didn't enjoy the brand of seaweed they used. I love shoyu ramen, however, I didn't love it here.  I think it's great that we have a ramen spot on this side of town because it saves the drive. As I always say...go in and have a try for yourself as everyday is a different one and perhaps I just caught them on a wrong day. I don't think I'd ever be back, and would prefer to drive into Chinatown for my ramen crave. But...if I wanted to catch a ramen fix, save a drive, and perhaps save a waiting time the other ramen spots will have you doing, jusssst maybe I'd consider it.  On a positive note, my husband enjoyed his. So just maybe I'll give it another shot.",

My ramen noodles were cooked perfectly and although I asked for normal and not spicy, there was enough spice in the miso soup for taste, which was incredible. The strawberry boba itself was okay. The boba balls were very soft, not frozen, and were perfectly chewy, though the actual strawberry flavor tasted way too artificial and was essentially bubblegum pink/flavor instead of strawberry. I'm sure another flavor would've been better.   Anyway, overall, this place is amazing and I definitely will recommend to friends and possibly bring some here too. Great service, great food.",

The tonkatsu ramen broth had a deep rich pork broth. Is it as good as ramen in LA or Kyoto no but it certainly is decent and at a cost of $7.99 it might be the cheapest bowl of decent ramen around.",

It was a little dirty since there were boxes stacked in a corner and the counters needed to be dusted. I ordered food anyway since the most unattractive places have the best food.   THIS PLACE IS LEGIT!! The food came out super fast. We ordered the tonkotsu ramen, spam katsu, fried gyoza and shrimp tempura. All was done in less than 10 min.  Y'all I'm in love. I was gonna be so made of this food was trash but I will define coming back here!!   I just wish they would decorate the place a little more but whatever. The food is the important part and they nailed it",

Also if you get some ramen save the broth when your done with the noodles and ask for a noodle refill then boom! A whole bowl of ramen all over again. Not as good as other ramen shops in Vegas but it's probably the best your gonna find near nellis afb.  I do recommend! Go go go!!",

    "text": "We've been trying to come out to Tokyo Cafe since August when we moved to NLV.  Something always comes up, and so yesterday, when my husband wasn't feeling well and having a serious craving for ramen, we decided to head over to try it out.  Given all the amazing reviews, we had pretty high hopes, and I have to say, I was impressed.   The location is small, but bright and tidy, and service was quick and very polite.  Tokyo Cafe has a small menu, but honestly, I still felt overwhelmed with choices!!  What did I want to try out this time?  Curry?  Ramen?  I wanted both!   We decided on: Tonkatsu Ramen Curry Udon with Shrimp Steamed Gyoza Seaweed Salad  My husband wasn't quite as enthusiastic about everything as I was.  He has his favorite ramen place, and nothing can beat that in his opinion.  He enjoyed everything though.  Me, on the other hand...I thought everything was delicious. The curry udon:  breaded butterflied shrimp served over a THICK curry sauce and perfect udon noodles.  This was awesome.  I've never met an udon I didn't like, but I really, truly enjoyed this.  It stayed piping hot till it was almost all gone (because the curry sauce was so thick!).  The shrimp was cooked well.  The noodles were perfect.  I asked for a level 0 spiciness, and I'm glad I did.  The curry had a bit of heat to it that built up really nicely.  I'm a wimp with spice, so the gentle build was perfect.    The ramen:  The broth was SO light, and delicate.  The noodles were cooked perfectly.  Really tasty.  I didn't try the meat, but I never eat meat in my ramen.  This was really good.    The seaweed salad:  Really tasty.  Only complaint was that it was cut into super small pieces that made eating the last bits a little difficult.  But the taste was incredible.    The steamed gyoza:  Tasty.  I've had better, and the gyoza sauce tasted and smelled strongly of vinegar.    We also, on the way out, ordered a Thai tea with no boba, and a taro tea with boba.   Both were delicious, and the boba was prepared really well.    All in all, I'm pleased with the visit.  We will most definitely be back.  I can't wait to try some more items!",

It was so full of flavor, the pork belly had an awkward taste to me but my husband & son thought it was good. The only negative about the place was the lady at the register. She literally had no personality! She seemed annoyed by us asking what some of the items were on the menu & at the time we were the only people there, so it's not like we were holding up the line? However the gentleman that brought out our food was very friendly. I'd definitely return, angry lady or not!",

I just found it and I'm glad I did. It's pretty great.   Ordered two chicken Teriyaki bowls, a beef Teriyaki plate, and a shoyou Ramen bowl with an extra egg.   The chicken Teriyaki was pretty good, loads of rice and chunky veggies. Kids enjoyed it. Even the picky one.    Beef plate had plenty of meat and a little bowl of rice. Was not enough for the hubby, but lucky the kids didn't finish and he filled up.   My soup came with two seaweed sheets, a bit of mushrooms, some bamboo shoots (that I convinced the childrens to try because they might turn into pandas. ) and some pork that I promptly shuffled to the littlest who offered a \"Humm, um YUMM!\" I found the soup to be a bit saltier than I'd like, but had some good flavor.   All in all, it's not Monta, but I'd return.",

    "text": "Tokyo Cafe is a very nice addition to this neighborhood's limited selection of non-Latino ethnic dining.  It's not a chain, and the food is all homemade from what I can tell.  I've been trying a few dishes here lately, so I'll go through my recommendations!  I am a big fan of the fried rice with beef, and the curry katsu with pork.  Both dishes are served with huge portions.  The fried rice lasts me 2 meals easily!  It's nicely light and fluffy, without a lot of salt and nearly no grease.  It is a less flavorful style of fried rice, but it's wholesome and filling.  I prefer to order it with beef, which is prepared in little bite sized strips, and is tender and quite flavorful.  The pork katsu here is quite nice.  If you haven't had Japanese curry, it's thick like Indian curry, but not as spicy and herbal as Indian or Thai curry.  This curry is maybe a little less spicy than Zen (often considered the best Japanese curry in town), but the flavor is still quite nice.  The fried batter is light and flaky, the pork strips very tender.  They serve you two big cutlets; a huge serving!  It also comes with a salad that has a very unique lemony dressing on it that was super refreshing.    I'm not a huge fan of the ramen (I am the former duke of Monta though, so I have had a lot of the best Vegas has to offer).  I've only tried the Miso.  It was a bit thin, and the flavors were a little off balanced.  By far not a bad dish, just something that doesn't hold up to the places over on Spring Mtn.    I find myself going to this restaurant almost one week.  I wouldn't recommend traveling far to eat here, but if you work or live in this area and you haven't tried the food, you are missing out for sure!",

We ordered a teriyaki beef plate that the menu said came with mixed vegetables and rice and Tonkotsu Ramen.  This was the first time we had ever had Ramen and my fiance said he liked it but it wasn't the greatest. It comes with pork, egg, seaweed and mushrooms but lacked flavor.  My teriyaki didn't come with vegetables (which is why I ordered it) but rather a small iceberg salad. I asked the girl about the veggies and she said that they changed that some time ago.  Wish I knew that before ordering.  The beef was a little tough and the sauce was ok. I have better at Samarai Sam's (sorry, I know that is totally wrong!) and Yogi's. Next time we will venture to China Town for some yummy Japanese ;-)",

It was a lightly breaded chicken breast, it was light and flaky and crunchy. It was served with white rice and curry gravy. I ordered it medium spice. I poured the gravy over everything... It is delicious! It was very well priced as well. My friend had the beef fried udon that also was delicious!  We're here in Las Vegas for a short time... We'll be hitting this place again.",

Little on the small side but still delicious. I also ordered the chicken katsu curry. The curry had no veggies and was the broth itself. It tasted a little bland. I think if veggies was added to it then it would have more flavor. Not sure why it has the word aloha in it because it's a Japanese place and nothing Hawaiian about it",

I live in north vegas and to be honest I am pretty doubtful of any ramen place not on Spring Mountain but damn am I SO EXCITED to have found this place.  I like it better that you go to the front to order like any fast food joint, free soda refills, etc good start. Ordered Miso Ramen (basic white weeboo bitch fave) no veggies and 2 eggs (most places think 1 egg is half an egg), extra noodles and a soda. Overall close to 15 bucks, not bad.  I wait at thier bar thing in the back, took less than 8 minutes i sware, and they bring this MONSTER BOWL OUT. I was so excited and ate damn near all of it. Also apparently they really give you a whole egg here so i have 2 whole friggen eggs AND IT EVEN COMES WITH A HALF EGG ALREADY. BEST, FUCKING, THING, OF MY LIFE.  Noodles were fa tastic, broth a little salty but was amazing.   Not only will I be coming back but I will also crown Tokyo Cafe my FAVORITE ramen house in the city. Bu bye Spring Mountain hello Craig.",

I rarely eat the gyoza since that's my wife's favorite appetizer here and I don't get a chance to try it.

I was hungry so I ordered a $4 Fried Gyoza appetizer (6 pieces) and $8 Chicken Katsu Curry, which both tasted good. My friend ordered the Tofu Katsu Curry, which was the first time I ever had Tofu Katsu and I enjoyed it! After having recently been spoiled by the food in Japan, I can still confidently recommend the food at Tokyo Cafe, especially because the food here is worth the price. Just don't order too much because it's definitely got that comfort food vibe, which means you can feel great while eating it, but not so much later on! ;)",

The restaurant is small and a little outdated/old looking (e.g. menu boards, decor, signage) but the prices can't be beat! We ordered the curry udon with pork katsu and a ramen. Portion sizes are good.   My curry udon packed a satisfying amount of heat for level 2 spice, and the noodles were soft and picked up the generous amount of curry sauce well. The piece of pork katsu was thin, light, and crispy and went really well with the noodles. I wish there was some type of veggie or something that came with it as the noodles + katsu was a little boring after a while.  My boyfriend also enjoyed his ramen! The broth was flavorful but a little on the salty side.  Overall would recommend! Didn't get drinks but they didn't look bad either.",

    "text": "After living in Japan for 3 years, there is one thing I absolutely miss, and that is good curry. Our favorite Japanese spot was a place called Coco Ichibanya, which has a few franchises in Southern California but nothing out here in Vegas yet. That being said, Tokyo Cafe has matched the nostalgia and flavor of the authentic Japanese curry experience I once had. It's a small shop not totally noticeable with a handful of restaurants across the street and a huge Casino on the other corner, sharing a parking lot with an odd auto repair/thrift shop. Small as it is; it can seat about 10 tables of 2-4 people. Prices are super fair, and they have a decent variety of items, to include ramen, takoyaki, Japanese beverages, etc.  I always default to the Pork Katsu Curry, which comes out perfectly breaded, tender, and crispy. They serve it with rice, curry on the side, and a small salad. You can opt for spicier, but I have the spice tolerance of a toddler.  I've frequently ordered over the phone since it is close to work, and they always serve up really fast! We've had several group lunches and small going away lunches here - the staff is great as well!",

Tokyo Cafe is the only one I've seen remain for so long. They've got great customer service. Their chicken katsu is delicious. Their portions are perfects I've yet to try their Ramen, which many of my friends say is also delicious. A must try!",

You order at the counter and they bring it to your table. I ordered the Shoyu Ramen .. I am a bit of a ramen snob but I thought the pieces of pork were a bit too fatty (I'm talking about 90% fat) and I thought the broth was too salty for my liking.    You can order your ramen to any degree of spiciness you want or no spicy taste at all. There are a TON of noodles in the ramen bowl so you will be full but it might not be the best for diets. Tokyo Cafe also offers tempura, udon, and Japanese curries, plus a few boba drinks. I did have the taro boba and it was very sweet - I did not enquire as to whether the sugar could be dialed down a notch or two.  If you are in need of a quick, cheap bite near the area or just have a general craving for Japanese type cuisine in the area, I would give Tokyo Cafe a try .. I just wouldn't go totally out of the way to find it.",

The cashier was a very unhappy and annoyed looking gentleman who rolled his eyes which sucked but after I ordered, the food came out super quick. I got the miso ramen and chicken katsu.  Both dishes were amazing! I fell in love with this place for the food. The ramen was salty and spicy and they give you a lot of noodles and broth. The chicken katsu had a Japanese curry that was so flavorful and it came with a ton of chicken that was crispy and nicely breaded. The pricing is very reasonable about $9 a dish.   I will def be coming back here! I can't wait to try their other dishes.",

    "text": "Tokyo Cafe is a win!  I'm not usually on this side of town, but I was out here visiting a friend and wanted to pick up food on my way home. With the help of the Yelp app, I found Tokyo Cafe.  Located in a small shopping center, Tokyo Cafe can be difficult to find at first. Once you park, you might try to rethink your decision if this was a good find or not. This place looks nondescript for a place called \"Tokyo Cafe\". Decor is not fancy by any means, but sometimes those are the most delicious places and in this case, it is True!  The menu is simple and straight forward. I ordered the steamed gyoza, the tonkotsu ramen, and the chicken katsu curry. The person who took my order was quick and friendly. I only waited about 10 minutes for my order. While I was waiting at one of the tables, I saw someone eating their order of fried rice. My mouth started to water so I jumped back in line and ordered a chicken fried rice to go. Don't judge me.  The gyoza was good. They come either steamed or fried to your liking. The ramen was really good despite some of the questionable pictures that I found on yelp. The broth was delicious and the toppings were generous. The chicken katsu curry was huge! The katsu was crunchy and the serving of rice was heavy. The curry came on the side, which I appreciated since my food was to go. The fried rice was flavorful and also a very generous serving.   The food alone was tasty which would be a solid four stars from me. The extra start comes from the price. All of this food for under $30 was a steal. Even the two of us couldn't even make a dent with these crazy portions. Talk about leftovers for lunch tomorrow. I can dig that.",

    "text": "I don't know how Tokyo Cafe has 4.5 stars. Maybe because it's the only ramen shop in North Las Vegas? I came here after realizing Jun's was closed. I intended to get the tempura udon but saw a picture of the curry udon and ordered that along with seaweed salad. The restaurant is small and casual. You order at the counter and get a number for your table. The seaweed salad came out quickly and I had no problems with it. The curry udon however was... not very appetizing. Maybe my problem is with the dish of curry udon and not Tokyo Cafe, who knows.   I've never loved udon. Compared to ramen and soba it's so... thick... wormy. However, with a light broth it can be enjoyable. That all changes with curry udon. You see, with curry rice you can slowly combine your curry and rice to the right ratio. With curry udon they just dump all your noodles into the curry and noodles don't do a very good job of soaking the curry up. So basically you're eating noodles and then if you want you can slurp up the equivalent of a gravy and have a heart attack. There are also no vegetables except the pickled onion and ginger you can get from the condiment table. And on top of it all... deep fried chicken! Needless to say I didn't finish this dish and I definitely didn't feel very healthy afterwards.   So yeah maybe I made a bad menu decision. I probably will come back to try the tempura udon or something not so heavy. I will say they do a swift business. I saw a lot of construction workers and business men coming and going, ordering ramen, fried rice, udon. I'm glad to see fast food Japanese food that isn't teriyaki chicken being enjoyed by so many people! However, I definitely wouldn't give this place more than 3 stars.",

It's not suppose to be udon noodles or ramen noodles, it's not teriyaki sauce or thai sauce, and it's also suppose to have veggies and I've never seen it spicy, until Vegas. I have spent the past 8 years in southern Utah and have looked through probably every Japanese/teriyaki joint on yelp trying to find images of what I know Yakisoba to be. I have ordered it one too many times to only be disappointed when it had arrived. Thanks to a fellow yelper, I saw he said he had been to Japan and this was the real thing, So I decided to give it a shot and sure enough! Hands down the one place I have found in 8 years in Oceanside, Vegas and St. George that makes it authentic! I was a happy camper yesterday and now i'm only sad I live 2 hrs away. =) Only down side was I like broccoli and mushrooms as well in mine, but I will take what I can get! I look forward to my next drive to Vegas.",

The service was friendly and guy at register recommended the Tonkotsu Ramen so went with that. Ramen was good and spicy as advertised. Served with pork, half an egg and other stuff I don't know the name of.  The amount of food you get is a good portion size for the price. Food was very good and the only thing I would recommend is an upgrade in appearance. Place seems very dated and there were boxes stacked up in a corner which were visible from the parking lot. I would definitely come back and try other stuff on the menu and I'm glad I now have another option of food in this area that is already loaded with food options.",

We also tried the chicken katsu and chicken teriyaki plate and my kids loved it!",

Jumping back & fourth on what to have, ramen or soba.... I ended up getting yakisoba- combination  at that. Over priced for 3 pics of shrimp. I spent $13.00 on salt. Too much soba sauce & not enough meat. The pork that was in it was super dry & chewy.   2 stars? I felt rushed for the 3 minutes I took to browse. Wasn't greeted when I came in nor thanked for visiting.   I may just go back for Boba. But not for food.",

We got the tonkatsu ramen and the pork tonkatsu curry. They were both good just nothing special. The cha shu in the ramen was really good just kinda thin and the soup was good too. The curry itself was good as well and surprisingly very spicy! I usually ask for spicy curry and it's just ok spicy but this was on fire.   This place is definitely worth a try especially since it's very well priced.",

Tokyo Cafe brings a bit of what's offered to Chinatown without the 15-20 minute drive.   Tonkotsu: Generous amounts of thick noodles, slices of chashu, a soft boiled egg, slices of green onions, and an over abundance of bamboo shoots bathed in a hot, milky-colored broth. Although the broth had that oily fattiness, its flavor didn't have depth.   Miso: The miso ramen that my boyfriend ordered was reminiscent to a shoyu ramen with a richer, saltier flavor.  Gyoza: Our bill was over $25, so we received complimentary gyoza, which makes for a good shareable appetizer.   If ramen and gyoza aren't your thing, there are also other items on the menu, such as a variety of curries.   I have to give props to the service. The staff here works incredibly hard to run this establishment and keep patrons happy.   Tokyo Cafe is worth the try if you're in the area looking for something to eat that isn't at a chain restaurant.",

He asked us if we wanted our soup spicy or not (which I recommend a little spicy). After charging us, the food came to us very quickly. He brought our food to our table. He was very kind.  Regardless, I'm only giving Tokyo Cafe 4/5 stars because the boba in this location is disappointing. I ordered the Milk Tea, it was alright. It tasted very similar to iced coffee with boba. But yet, I have tasted better. Also when we were done with our ramen, I ordered a second boba (to go) for my sister. I ordered the Coconut boba. It was truly disgusting. It tasted like evaporated milk from the can. I kid you not, that coconut boba tasted EXACTLY like that. I wish I would have known it was gross when I was at the restaurant. I would have gotten another flavor.   To add to the second boba order. I had a bitter Asian woman ring me up. She was so rude to me for no reason.

    "text": "Welcome to North Las Vegas where Chinese/Japanese food isn't really Chinese/Japanese. In order to keep business afloat, I understand that you must adapt to what customers want. This isn't Chinatown where Asian restaurants compete with each other. Craig Road has Panda Express, Sakura and Tokyo Cafe...offer food for cheap in order to compete.  This was once a Quizno's then became Pasta China and something else. We came here and the place was empty. They offer free edamame with your Yelp check-in. I didn't claim mine.  Thai Tea with Boba: I'm pretty sure they don't brew their own tea but it still tastes like Thai tea and didn't have that chalky taste to it. The balls were kind of hard and chewy. 3/5  Katsu Curry: You can get tofu, chicken,shrimp or pork. We tried the chicken and pork. Both were super thin. The curry was marginal. It comes with veggies and white rice. You can get brown rice for like $1 extra. 3/5  Chicken Teriyaki: Thin pieces of chicken drenched with salty teriyaki sauce. I should have asked for sauce on the side instead. 2/5  For $6/entree, it's not bad if you're in the area desperate for some milk tea, ramen and Japanese curry. If you're looking for something more authentic, this is not it. However, the service was good.",

    "text": "It was Date Night with the wifey and we couldn't decide to go down to Chinatown for some chow OR take a risk and go to the other side of Craig Road to give Tokyo Cafe a go.  Glad we did, this place is the little engine that could!  Somehow in all my years here, I have rarely ventured past The Cannery Hotel & Casino on that side of town.  This was a first in a long time.  Located just past The Cannery but right before the freeway sits unassuming, little Tokyo Cafe.  When we went for dinner, place was really empty, maybe only two other tables were occupied at the time.  But I shouldn't have worried because Tokyo Cafe is a good place to eat!  Restaurant itself is quaint but nice and newly painted.  Reminds me of a place where you can hang out with your friends and read anime.  Japanese-y.  Service though was spot on comforting.  We were greeted warmly by two little Asian fellas (yes they were little and NO I'm not being racist) who I am assuming were the owners of the place.  One is the front of the house runner/cashier, other was the cook in the kitchen.  Menu is very small but thankfully it is focused on serving Japanese food only.  I really didn't want to go to Tokyo Cafe and see Orange Chicken and Beef Broccoli on the menu, like many Asian-type restaurants do to appease the more American fan base.  The most important things are on the menu at Tokyo Cafe - ramen & rice.  Oh so nice.  Wifey is not a big fan of ramen (thinks lots of them are just TOO salty) but she opted for a bowl of Tonkatsu Ramen ($6.99) with extra noodles ($1.59) because it was a bit chilly.  I'm a huge fan of anything katsu and curry, so I ordered their Chicken Katsu Curry plate ($6.99).  For checking in with Yelp, we also got a free serving of edamame.  Ah, the perks of being a Yelper.  Food overall wasn't fancy, but it was good on taste!  Wifey said her ramen was tasty because it wasn't so salty but still flavorful, and the noodles weren't soggy.  Our server noticed that there was too many noodles in her bowl and proceeded to immediately get us another bowl with more tonkatsu broth inside.  He said, \"Too much noodles but not enough soup, so I bring another bowl for you.\"  Very polite and much appreciated!  Ramen was not skimpy on toppings either - had a generous amount of roasted pork, nori, menma (pickled bamboo shoots), and soft boiled egg in it.  And with the extra noodles, more than enough food for two people to share!  Wifey ate half the bowl and passed the other serving over to me, which I finished with aplomb.  My Chicken Katsu Curry fit the bill.  The portion was just big enough for me.  Two nicely golden brown pieces of chicken katsu, a small portion of steamed veggies, a bowl of curry, and another bowl with steamed rice.  Katsu was cooked perfectly and not greasy at all.  Curry may or may not have been from the package, but it's hard for me to tell.  No matter though because curry from scratch is a pretty daunting and time-consuming task.  Great dish for less than $7!  I ate all of it without barely leaving a grain of rice left on my plate.  Good surprise here was the Thai Milk Tea with Boba.  I don't normally drink boba because it's often too sweet with all that added sugar.  But the one from Tokyo Cafe was delicious!  Refreshing!  Just the way I like it, strong tea flavor, light on sugar and milk, lots of ice.  I wish refills were free.  We will be going to Tokyo Cafe again down the line.  Place is a nice gem in the North part of town.  Hope it stays around for a while.  Oishi!",

    "text": "What a solid establishment! Decided to give Tokyo Cafe a try and was surprised at the quality! Me and the misses both got the Miso Ramen along with free edamame with a yelp check in! Awesome! The edamame came out to the table very quickly and was salted perfectly and tasted as they should. The Ramen also arrived shortly after and was then slurping away! The Miso broth tasted very different from the broths Ive had at china town and I liked it! It seemed to be a soy sauce based broth with miso and had that extra salty kick that was a welcomed combo, the ramen was very chewy and dense and had perfect texture! The chashu was awesome! Less fatty, tender, and Great flavor! Along with bamboo shoots, Nori, and the egg was such a great taste! Two bowls of ramen with two drinks for just about $20 even, Not bad at all considering the amount you get. Def a great addition to North Las Vegas as we needed a good ramen spot! So it surprised us so much that we got the tofu and chicken curry to go. As we just finished those dished, The curry was also a great dish! The tofu and chicken both has great crust and crunch, the rice was cooked well, and the vegetable were fresh, steamed goodness! The curry was not overpowering and complemented the tofu and chicken very well. I hope Tokyo Cafe the best and that they prosper as It will be def in my reg rotation of restaurants to go and eat at!",
