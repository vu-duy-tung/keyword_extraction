    "text": "Pretty amazing atmosphere as I am sure has been said already. I had shrimp cocktail, cream spinach and the medium sized prime rib. My dining partner had angel chicken, asparagus & French onion soup.  Service was spectacular. French onion soup was really good and cheesy. Shrimp cocktail was not so terrific- The shrimp although large seemed a little old. Medium sized prime rib was huge and tasty. Angel chicken was light and flavorful. Asparagus was not so great - a large portion but something was missing. Cream spinach was OK, but I would've preferred sauteed spinach.  Overall, worth the trip and the experience of dining in a truly iconic Las Vegas location.",

I was a bit skeptical as its an older establishment. We drove up and I became a little more comfortable. As we walked in the staff was amazingly helpful. Our reservation was for 8pm and we showed up just after 7pm and they sat us right down. It is a beautiful place with amazing food and service.",

So, we go to the bar and order two Cadillac Margaritas. What we get are two regular margaritas that tasted like juice with ice and no alcohol. I remind the bartender we ordered Cadillacs that have premium tequila and a shot of Grand Marnier. He responds that it is premium and that's our house tequila. I look at the female bartender and ask her to please inform the male bartender how to make a Cadillac Margarita, which she does and we can tell that she's been picking up the slack for him. He gives us an attitude for us basically asking to receive what we're paying for. We finish our drinks and have now been waiting a half hour. I walk up to the Host to remind him we have reservations for a table twenty minutes ago and, he again states with a rude tone this time that there are no available tables. So, at this time, I assertively asked him what are those three tables for? He grudgingly grabs a couple menus and with an attitude says he can seat us now. I tell him no thanks, I'm done with this place and the gangsta attitudes from the staff. Place is in a crappy crime area and is way way way over rated. Save yourself the trip and head elsewhere.",

Chris's Pork Chop was as big as the plate WOW !! And her potato had to be served on its own plate because we have never seen a baked potato that large in our life !! You do NOT want for more food here when your finished eating here that's for sure... You will be full...  EVERYTHING was absolutely outstanding... My steak melted in my mouth and her Pork Chop was also very tender...           The atmosphere was wonderful in this old Vegas restaurant... We loved the decor and old photos and just the thought that we were from Florida but we're still able to enjoy a delicious meal where the Rat Pack ate many times years ago and Muhammad Ali and Mario Andretti was wonderful... It just doesn't get any better than that when your on vacation just looking for a place to have a nice meal....",

Next up was a side caesar for me and chicken and rice soup for my boyfriend. The caesar was delicious and freshly prepared. For our main course, I ordered the chicken parmesan (not a steak fan) & my boyfriend ordered the NY strip. My chicken was excellent and a very generous size!

I had the poached salmon with dill sauce and enjoyed it. There is nothing for children at all on this menu. My fourteen year old had the toasted ravioli with marinara sauce and liked it.  My ten year old would eat nothing but bread .  The desserts were definitely nothing special.  Cheesecake was very small and plain, no sauce whatsoever.  The creme brulee was likely the worst I've ever had... not creamy at all, very thin and runny. I would have no reason to return.  Sorry, but a lot of hype for an average place. Extremely overpriced.

    "text": "The reason this is 3 stars vs 4 is due to expectations vs reality.  This is a traditional, a la cart style steakhouse.  They are a left over from a different era and can be quite an experience to be in.  I've been in several similar restaurants (and worked in them as well in my youth) so I had a certain expectation to how it should be.  Atmosphere and ambiance was what I expected.  Service is off though.  I'm used to being introduced to the waiter or waiters for my table and the bus boy and asked if I'd been here before (if I wasn't recognized as a regular).  Instead it was very lack of warmth.  We were brought the wrong salads and when we got the right ones, they weren't brought out at the same time.  We also had to flag someone down for water and ice tea refills at least once.  Also, places of this caliber have an intermezzo service, Golden Steer does not.  The food was ok but not worth the price.  At this type of place I expect to pay high prices but I should be getting phenomenal service and top quality food and prep.  The so called \"world famous ceasar salad\" was not table side prep, was a small plate of a basic ceasar salad - nothing more.  The house salad a friend got was even more disappointing.  It looks like a salad I would get at a casino cafe.  Our tabled had 2 ribeyes and a top sirloin.  My wife commented that her sirlion was a bit overcooked and while good, she had had better.  The 2 ribeyes were cooked right and tasted fine but seemed to lack seasoning and didn't impress me much - for $52 bucks I can go to several other gourmet steak houses and get a superior piece of meat.  Golden steer is still trying to sell people on prime corn-fed beef at prices for what other competing places give for dried aging and grass-fed.  The power went out while we were there (not their fault).  Staff was vary accommodating because of it and reduced the check for the inconvenience (didn't even have to ask or mention anything).  We'll probably just skip this place in the future, there are better places where the food and service is better and I can get that fine dining experience.",

    "text": "Now, I will admit; I am very generous when it comes to reviewing and rating, but I only write about things when True emotion and feeling are conjured up. It's not like I don't have the time, it's just that the inspiration is gone. Not within The Golden Steer.  I will address the fact that I have been coming to and living in Las Vegas since the early 80s as a child. I have seen 90% (probably more) of the businesses come, flourish and then be gone. There are few places in Las Vegas that offer an AUTHENTIC old steakhouse, and even fewer near the Strip. Everything about this place, maitre's d  and all. Other than Bally's, Circus Circus, Smith & Wollensky and Golden Steer, EVERY SINGLE other steakhouse (on the strip) doesn't pre-date 1989.  I have been to ALL OF THEM. They all are 5 star worthy, But S&W can be a bit pricey... Golden Steer is far and away, my champion of Steak AND Service in Las Vegas. It sits in an inauspicious strip mall 1 block west of LVBLVD on Sahara. The best word to describe this place is Incognitus Majorus. It isn't pain-in-the-assedly normal \"In the Rear of the Casino\" Location, see: Circus Circus and Bally's. or tucked away in a location that is too crowded (everywhere downtown). Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr, Joey Bishop and Marilyn have their own booths. There is a Grand Piano in the front Lounge area. The decor looks as if it hasn't changed since 1957. It is reported that this was one of the frequents of aforementioned characters of yore. What a perfect spot, in close proximity to the Thunderbird, El Rancho and Riviera, and then later, Sahara.  I came to dinner with the most obnoxious accessory to diners and servers alike: A BABY. They not only sat us immediately, but Our Hostess, Stephanie (?) offered a bowl of mashed potatoes before even handing us the menus for food or wine. That was incredible. Haven't seen that before, or since.  It was my 5th time there overall and first time with my daughters. The prices were on par with every other steakhouse in town, so I don't mind. The food was not only phenomenal, but the service was incredible, and everyone was so polite about my baby girl. The same hostess even offered to hold her while we finished our last bites. The Crab Legs were huge, sweet and buttery. The steaks were cooked to perfection with the right amount of char and smokiness. The service was jaw droppingly amazing and we ended up tipping everyone that helped us.   Not only was this my favorite steakhouse from this point on; but my favorite dining experience in Las Vegas. Hands Down. I hope that someone actually reads this from front to back. I am a local concierge and VIP Host in town, it is my job to report accurate findings out and about in Vegas. I pass over the mediocre and certifiable, I give Kudos to the businesses that inspire me. Golden Steer offered a dining experience that I will remember for the rest of my life. Not only that, they set the curve. I have eaten quite literally around the world, and experienced service at all levels of remuneration, but have NEVER experienced dinner like my 5th visit to Golden Steer.",

    "text": "Had to try this place since its been rated so highly for years. Overall it was relatively normal for the environment. The steak was a bit dry and overcooked, but flavor delicate. The salad was awful, and the asparagus ok. The place is clean and nicely decorated. However the service was mediocre especially for the class they are supposed to be. The waiter spilled wine all over my table and several other servers dropped food tray lids, neatly dropped a salad bowl, and silverware. Hostess was rude after our last plate was taken and I paid the bill, she plopped into our booth and said our lounge is nice. It was very obvious that we were waiting on my two sips left of my wine.",

    "text": "There's always something interesting to see in Las Vegas.  The night BF and I went to Golden Steer, we saw a man pick up a streetwalker in the parking lot.  The interesting part was that, the street walker was an old man and he was wearing pink leotard and pink tutu.  I can't be certain but I think he also had a pink bow on his head. The whole incident took about 7 minutes and we couldn't stop staring!  When the lovely \"couple\" drove away, we decided it was safe to get out of our car and walked towards the restaurant.  From the outside, the restaurant doesn't look like much but inside, it was really nice.  I'm a sucker for ambiance and I really liked the old school and classy decor.  All the servers were dressed in formal uniform and they were very attentive.  To start with, we shared a bowl of Lobster Bisque.  It wasn't bad but it tasted slightly different from all other lobster bisque I've had before.  It was smooth and creamy but on the heavier side and somehow it tasted a little tart (kind of like sour cream).   For entree, BF had Petite Filet Mignon and I had Lil Cut Prime Rib.  We both ordered medium and both meat came out perfect.  The Prime Rib was HUGE and it was delicious especially with the freshly grated horseradish.  As for the Filet Mignon, BF said he's had tastier piece for much less at other restaurants. I believe him; the man always gets Filet Mignon at any restaurant that has one on menu.    Overall, I'd rate this place 3.5 stars.  I enjoyed the Prime Rib but the Lobster Bisque, not so much.  Also, we saw two of their staff hanging out and taking cigarette break in front of the restaurant - one before dinner and another after dinner.  I didn't expect that for this type of restaurant.",

The decor is very old school vegas. You can almost feel the energy that previously occupied this space. You can picture this place on a busy Friday in the late 50's or early 60's. We were seated in a large room in the back of the restaurant that we were told was used a meeting room by mob members visiting vegas and some of the members of the rat pack. Pretty cool.  We ordered our food and were all surprised with amount of food that came out. The portions are HUGE. I ordered a filet that while huge was a little bland. The twice baked potatoes were good but tasted like they'd been frozen at some point. The desert was okay but also had a frozen taste.  if I was judging this restaurant on the food it would have been a 3 star review but the service was pretty awful. Just slow, unconcerned and borderline rude.   Not saying I would never try this place again but for the money there is so many options that would blow this place out of the water.",

The ambiance alone is worth trotting over to what appears to be a hole in the wall restaurant in a rather less appealing part of town. The hubby and I tried it for a dinner out after a show and we were pleasantly surprised by the experience. I absolutely love love love the decor. When you walk in it's like walking back in time to when wood paneling and large leather covered booths were the epitome of class. The dimly lit dining room with the rich dark colors made my head swim at the sight of it (or maybe that was the wine). I imagined what it was like years ago when the Vegas elite frequented it and I don't think they have changed a bit since.   The service was impeccable. We couldn't have asked for a more attentive waiter. The food was scrumptious. We ordered the shrimp cocktail and oysters Rockefeller, both were divine. The oysters were lush and perfectly seasoned while the shrimp were fresh and cooked to the ideal texture. The bone in ribeye was delectable. I am a ribeye fanatic and I order my steaks rare which makes it easy to tell if a cut of meat isn't up to par. There was plenty of marble in the meat and although the outside wasn't as crispy as I usually like it, the taste was incredible. My husband ordered the filet and enjoyed his as well. The portions were ample and hearty. I relished the evening of divine food and vintage glamour.",

Cooked perfect and full of flavor. My prime-rib; however, was not very good. My first bite was awesome. Tender, moist and pure perfection. But as I ate on, I hit spots on the steak that tasted chalky. I don't know what the deal was, but it wasn't right. It didn't even have the texture of meat! Luckily the steaks here are the size of a side of cow so I was able to share my bf's steak.   The chopped salad was so so. Not your typical steakhouse salad. The only thing steakhouse about this salad was the price. It had large pieces of lettuce, garbanzo beans, tomatoes, and lettuce. I didn't even finish it and I shared with my bf!   The service isn't great either. Our waiter was not attentive. We had to ask for refills twice. He basically dropped our food and never came back until he had something else to drop off. Overall, the experience was okay. For the price, I'd go elsewhere.   And for those of you wondering about the bread basket.  That was average too. We were given three halves of a mini baguette. I'm sure it was good at one point but it was hard by the time it got to me; wasn't fresh  :(  Overall, I'm not impressed. But if you find yourself here, go for the rib-eye! :)",

I had the large filet and it was cooked perfect and served in an interesting au jus. The best part is its considerably cheaper then the strip options like blt cut craft etc. While there are dozens of those types of restaurants throughout the country, there is only one Golden Steer !

The last time I went was with a girlfriend, who loves to flirt and we got free bananas foster!    The food is some of the best food that I have had in Vegas.  I have had the escargot here and it is pretty tasty.  We always order the table side caesar and it is fantastic because the dressing is made from scratch right in front of you.  I don't usually order caesar salad because more times than not it is from a bottle and tastes terrible.  The steaks are very tender and flavorful and the sides are big enough to share.  The bananas foster is excellent and is also served tableside.  They add a little orange zest to the sauce, which I have never seen before, but it adds a nice little zing to the dish.    We love taking out of towners here for dinner mainly because it is fun to reserve the rat pack booths, but next time I will request Elvis's booth (just found out that he used to eat there).  Love the old timey vegas ambiance!",

    "text": "I recently went to Vegas for a conference and was more excited about the restaurants than the shows or gambling. Earlier in the week, I ate at Hell's Kitchen and was totally underwhelmed. The best meal I had in Vegas, and one of the best meals I've ever had, was at the Golden Steer.  According to the website, The Golden Steer is \"Las Vegas' oldest steakhouse\" and they carry on the tradition of old-school steakhouse dining. It's located at the north end of the strip near the Stratosphere.  Our service was spectacular. We had a waitstaff of at least 4 people who were knowledgeable, helpful and entertaining!  I love Caesar salads and I make them all the time. I've been perfecting my recipe for over 20 years. The Golden Steer Caesar was easily the best I've ever tasted. The chef made the salad at the table so I picked up a couple improvements for my own recipe.  Our sommelier recommended the Duckhorn Merlot. I'm typically not a Merlot drinker but it did not disappoint! Everything is a la carte so we had the sauteed mushrooms (in a pool of delicious butter sauce) and fresh cut fries, which have caramelized onions. I had the one of the specials which was filet Oscar (which is topped with asparagus, hollandaise and crab). It was perfectly cooked and the sauce was delicious! Everyone at our table had some kind of steak and everyone was blown away by the quality and preparation of their steak.  For dessert we shared cherries jubilee and bananas foster, again it was prepared at our table. By then we we had very little room to eat much more but both desserts were finished anyway.  Because if it's location, it could possibly be overlooked but it's totally worth the cab ride if you're staying on the south end of the strip or anywhere else in Vegas for that matter!",

We were blown away upon entering the Golden Steer: lipstick red leather booths, mammoth Jeroboam bottles of Perrier-Jouet and magnums of champagne utilized as decor, dim lighting, prerequisite steers bolted to walls, and a decidedly retro vibe. Not an iPhone in sight. This steakhouse delivered in spades to a family of vegetarians (one member of our party opted for steak). Everything about the Golden Steer was old school--menu, ambiance, attentive waitstaff, music, and milieu. We ordered salmon, halibut and the aforementioned steak--all good and all memorable. Service was impeccable (Ali and numerous other attendants).  The vibe was so strong and seductive that we adjourned in the bar following dinner for another hour of retro diversion.  Don't be fooled by the seedy exterior of this upscale restaurant. My favorite restaurants are all in the Wynn and I put the Golden Steer in the same category of par excellence. The Golden Steer is both a restaurant *and* an experience.",

    "text": "This is an excellent steak house.  We started with half a dozen oysters, and they were served beautifully with all the condiments that you'd expect.  We had the chateaubriand for two carved tableside.  How exactly can you go wrong?  The meat arrived just as we asked for, cooked to perfection.  The gentleman that carved the steak had clearly done this before, and he prepared and plated the food nicely, which was being served with a side of vegetables.  The veggies were also prepared perfectly.  They have a very nice wine selection, and we were able to find a bottle of zinfandel that went great with our dinner selection.  The big question you'll have to ask yourself is, is it worth the money?  If you at all flinch about spending a lot of money for oysters, meat, veggies and wine, then you do not want to come here.  If you like nostalgia, pictures of old Las Vegas on the wall, and fantastic service, this is a great place for you to consider.  So, there's the issue, what's important to you.  For me, once was probably enough, but I am glad that I went.",

But the Caesar salad was a bit too much dressing but the flavor was good. The waiters were attentive to our service. Not too many restaurants know how to make or serve lobster thermidor any more. The last time I tried it was my 1st wedding anniversary with my ex husband and that was 42 years ago.",

We now live out of state, but if there is only one place we can stop for dinner when we are there, it will be Golden Steer. The bar is also incredible and the drinks are generous.

    "text": "Old school eating at the oldest steakhouse in Vegas!  My companion and I greatly enjoyed our steak dinners at this restaurant. My friend went for the 22oz Ribeye while I opted for the leaner 16oz New York Strip. A giant glass of aged Chianti and a couple slices of warm bread later we received our meals. Aside from the red wine, our giant slabs of meat were the only contrast to our predominantly white dinner setup. It really makes the meal stand out, and for me to dive right in!  Both of our steaks were cooked to perfection and I was especially satisfied with mine. No need for extra garnishments, no steak sauce. Just pure, unadulterated meat. I really wish I could have ate it all but I easily hit my limit. I also wished that I had room for dessert after seeing a few of the waiters flambe some Cherries Jubilee right next to us.  Our server was very attentive, informative and made sure our glasses of wine stayed full. His formality is top notch and really reflected the establishment well. I really appreciated the recommendations, if you're open minded, definitely hear the staff out when inquiring about what to order.  Attentive and well-paced service accompanied by excellent food is a win-win for me, especially in a city where I always lose. I will definitely be back for more during my next visit in town!",

    "text": "Such a disappointment.  I had been looking forward to visiting this establishment since the reviews were promising and the overall history revolving around the Rat Pack and the icons of that era was intriguing.  Every time I visit Vegas, I plan and make reservations at establishments to check out their offerings of steaks.  On our last visit, my steak visit was The Barrymore and had a wonderful bone-in Ribeye steak so I knew my next visit would have to, at the very least, equal or rival the experience.  The Golden Steer is located on the north end of the strip, next to the Lucky Dragon Casino and west of the Riviera Hotel (sadly now gone.)  The exterior is easy to miss, given the drab strip mall front but the vintage steakhouse feel emanates old school Vegas the minute you step over the threshold.  Banquettes are lined with white linens, dim low lighting creates a cozy and romantic feel, candlelight flickering throughout.  The wait staff here also resonate old Vegas, dressed sharply in their b&w suits.  It made me wish I was born in that era of new music, big band, jazz,  A-list, and entertainment.  The menu encompasses typical steakhouse offerings: steaks, Italian, salads, appetizers, sides, and dessert.  I knew exactly what I wanted: 22 oz bone-in Ribeye steak.  When I placed the order, I requested medium rare but in hindsight, should have ordered it rare to avoid the possibility of it being too done and dry.  We also ordered the giant baked potato with all the fixings and the Chicken Parmigiana.    My steak looked amazing when it arrived so I was very excited to cut into it.  Imagine my shock when all the juices seeped out and covered my plate.  That was the first sign to me that the steak did not sit long enough.  My first bite was horrible: the steak was dry and chewy.  There was little to no marbling and the steak lacked any flavor.  My experiences with Ribeye is the thin layer of fat that weaves itself marking off several sections of the steak.  There was no evidence of this on my cut.  Unfortunately, I had to make do with the baked potato since that was very tasty chock full of butter, sour cream, chives, and bacon.  My friend's Chicken Parm was also very good: it was moist, tender, and the layer of melted cheese a blessing since it imparted even more goodness to the dish.  It was accompanied with a side plate of 3 deep fried raviolis in their marinara sauce, a slightly sweet and acidic tomato base, which I am more inclined to.  I was very disappointed with my steak experience here.  Perhaps it was an off day, but when I am paying $55 for a steak, the expectation is to receive the entree accordingly to the pricing.  That being said, my friend's meal was good and the service prompt and friendly, especially that of the staff refilling our waters and clearing off the table so to them, an easy 4 stars.",

    "text": "Are you looking for old school cool? Are you looking for the best steak in Vegas? Want to sit in the same booth that Frank Sinatra sat in before he'd do a show at the Sahara? Look no further than this glorious piece of Las Vegas culture and history. From the table-side prepared Caesar salad and the leather booths, everything here yells \"Las Vegas Institution.\"   Looking at the place from outside, may be a tad concerning...There's a ton of construction going on and the area isn't the greatest, plus the vintage bulb-illuminated sign and surrounding shops might give you pause. But don't judge this book by its cover...  We came here on a Monday night, place was busy but not at all packed. Reserved the Frank Sinatra booth (seats about five comfortably), on the phone they said, \"no guarantees\" but the booth was available and we got immediately seated. (You can also reserve booth's once occupied by Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr., John Wayne and a whole host of other pop culture luminaries.)   This is an old-school dining experience (think Ruth's Chris or Morton's), but not so old school...They've expanded and updated the restaurant in recent years but at the same time have made sure the older part retained its charm - while not making it feel like your Grandfather's den (ok, it feels a little like Grandpa's den, but that's ok).  We came for both the food and ambience. Both were excellent.   The meal: Our server was good-ish, not great. We told him we were 1st-timers and he was relatively informative, considering. We ordered a few different types of steaks - a bone-in rib eye, a filet mignon, salad, and a few sides. Then the server pretty much handed us off to his table buser after taking our order...   Meal overall was great. Steaks were incredible, pricey, but easily the best we've had at any point in Las Vegas - and we've dined at almost every high-end steak restaurant on the strip. But...we were very taken aback by the taste of the creamed corn side.   Apparently they prepare the cream corn old-school style, with nutmeg and some other sweeter spices - the server did not mention anything about this when we ordered the side. And there is no mention of the way it's prepared on the menu. We would have sent it back, but as I mentioned the server pretty much disappeared for the last half of our meal (after the food came). Server also did not offer to remove the side from the bill when we asked him it about (after he re-appeared) at the end of the meal and the whole side remained un-eaten.  Aside from that, Caesar salad (made table-side) was also the best we'd ever eaten. (We ate at Rao's in Caesar's Palace the following night - we also ordered a Caesar to start there too, but Rao's charged two dollars more for one that wasn't made tableside, wasn't nearly the same size and tasted like it was pre-made.)     Steer management, your server cost you a 5 star review because of no mention (by him or on menu) about the variation/prep of the creamed corn - thankfully, no one in our party had a food allergy to nutmeg...  Worth the trip, will definitely return again. Won't order the creamed corn.",

Shortly after we went to be seated in dining room and specifically asked to transfer tab. Same bartender said they don't do that and they are separate and we had to close out. Then he hands the credit card machine to the one paying and asked him to press the button equivalent to the percent tip he wanted to leave.  Bartender didn't bother telling him grat was already included for our party of 9. So embarrassing seeing someone so hard up for a tip scheming for money. Nobody goes there and wants to scam you out of a tip when they have no problem paying $60 for a steak so relax.   Go be a cabbie you sheisty hack..and wash your hands!   Oysters and apps were good. Table side caesar was nothing great. We only wanted 8, but they made 9, took the extra one away, and charged us for 9 anyway. Guess this is a tourist trap where they figure no one looks at the bill that goes on the company card anyway and that's how they make a few extra bucks that probably really adds up. 3 of us got steak Oscar (2 ordered medium rare and one medium) but all 3 filets were dry.  Tsk tsk. The guy that got the pasta enjoyed his dish though :-/.  Think it's just a place you go for the history and nostalgia.  The rest is out w old Vegas standards and in with the new cookie cutter garbage.",

As Vegas old continues to expand toward Vegas new this forgotten restaurant will surely be top of the list again.  Get there while it's still reasonably priced.  The presentation of food is inconsistent with modern standard...table side prep of Caesar salad is awesome, but that's tempered with a main course presentation reminiscent of room service.  The sides are a decade or three outdated, thankfully the dishes taste awesome and the historical ambiance is really unmatched.  I mean, the wood paneling at first feels dated but that's part of the whole point - relish the opportunity to dine as you would have back in the past.  This place won't be under appreciated too much longer, get there before it's another overpriced Vegas attraction.",

    "text": "On arrival at the Golden Steer, you may question yourself. The exterior is sketchy, it seems as if you are far from the glamorous Strip, and nearby Circus Circus looms, questioning your decision with its white pillars of 1970's hotel blocks. You walk in and things still don't seem right at the bar. Your barender is distant, demanding; you can't transfer to your table. It seems this is awkward.  However, you steel yourself, saying, \"I made the right call. The fancy overpriced places on the Strip have nothing on here, this is Old Vegas, and Frank was right. If they were trading on name alone, the Steer would be gone. I have faith.\" And you would be right.  As you're led into the main dining room with your date -- or, as with me, my cousin -- you would be wholly validated. The world opens, angels sing, tuxedoed waiters do their thing, and all is right in an onomatopoeic universe where quality is rare and the Steak is too, capital 's' intended. Enjoy it.  Do not question your decision. From the moment you set down in your red vinyl banquette, your waiter treats you as if it is 1958 and the Steer just opened. Charm and discipline exude in equal measure as the oiled wood and red banquettes simultaneously place you on display for all to see and sequester your conversation in privacy unheard of in the modern era. It's a lovely experience.  If you're an old-school aficionado of the steakhouse as I am, you should convince your partner to order one of the most difficult of \"old cuts\" of steak to find -- Chateaubriand for two. This extra-thick cut of the tenderloin is sliced tableside and accompanied by wonderfully crisp-tender carrots, asparagus, and broccoli with Bearnaise and Hollandaise sauces that put the 50's to shame. The vegetables and sauces were excellent and worth the wait. The steak was out of this world good, perfect doneness and a complete delight. My cousin and I opted to add a twice-baked potato with each of us having half. It was a good decision, but nothing special.  We skipped dessert as we were quite full but enjoyed our experience immensely. As we were there early in the evening, our waiter guided my cousin around to some of the named tables and pointed out how they used to enjoy their orders and experiences. She and I sat at Oscar Goodman's table, which was fitting for our evening, and enjoyed the history and charm of the staff immensely. I wish more places like this existed in the world; but if they did, they wouldn't be as special, would they?  Thank you, and I will certainly be back when in town. Cheers!",

We got here right at 4:30 and were seated right away. We were looking over the menu when one of the waiters Daniel I believe came over to us. He asked us if we have been here before and I said no but I have been to Golden Steer Steakhouse in California before it closed down. And he blunty said we have no affiliation with them and walked to the kitchen. There I heard him making fun of me and laughing with a coworker about my response. So my boyfriend and I were shocked that the workers here would mock their guests. We felt it inappropriate so we decided to leave. And when I got up, a man was trying to stop me from leaving my booth. I told him I did not appreciate the worker making fun of me and laughing so I was leaving. And he was trying to tell me that they were not making fun of me. But I just wanted to leave and I took a step and the man grabbed my arm! He was not letting me leave. He said I just want to explain to you. And I told him no, you do not touch me and I do not have to speak with you. I am leaving. And after everyone's attention was caught he finally let me go. I could not believe this happened to me at this restaurant. I just wanted to leave and he was not letting me, it's not like I had ordered anything yet. Very unprofessional",

    "text": "The Server Telling You To Tip In Front of Him! I'll start with the good- 1. I loved the ambiance and history of the inside. You get to sit in the booths of people like Elvis, Sammy Davis Jr., Sinatra, and the list goes on. This was very cool. 2. The ribeye (20.oz) was excellent, but it should be for $54.  The just okay- 1. The Caesar salad (overpriced). The filet, okay, but needed some more flavor. 2. The outside (a portion of a dilapidated strip mall). 3. The service- did check on us, but when we needed something they didn't take time to listen, and bolted off, then came back with the wrong things. The bad- 1. The $75 large lobster tale was overcooked, tough and chewy. The worst I have tried to eat at a restaurant (even including chains like Outback). Never again. The sides- I wouldn't recommend the $9 twice baked potato, the server said it could not be ordered without bacon, because it was made yesterday (ok, probably my bad decision). The asparagus was okay, but sauces cost extra (really?). 2. When the Bill Came, the server had a handheld credit card runner. He ran the card, and told us to put the tip on it Right Then and There. In front of him staring at us. Well, we hadn't expected that, and had not really figured out the tip. We were so shocked that we just guesstimated 20%. But, I really hated that whole thing. It was uncomfortable and tacky, not what you should get in a place as pricey as Golden Steer. 3. Holly Madison has a booth plaque...yeah, her. Has Gone Downhill....",

We ended up splitting the potato and the steak. She didn't get sick, but I did, which lets me know it was definitely the salad.  The vibe and decor are very old school. The service is black tie, which is nice. Everything is served a la carte, but the portions are so big that you can easily split everything, which ends up being extremely cost effective.  I want to give this place more stars, but I can't ignore the end result.",

It doesn't look like much on the outside, but you feel like you're in a mobster movie and stepped back in time when you walk in.    This is the spot where Frank Sinatra and other famous people would go on the regular.  I've heard from others that Frank Sinatra has his own booth here.  The servers were very friendly.  They definitely made sure we were taken care of.  At least 4-5 servers would come to our table just to make sure we were okay.    Their wine glasses are huge.  Their breads tasted like it was freshly made.  The steaks were juicy and cooked to perfection.  The whipped potatoes were light and fluffy.  We got the salad, 8 oz filet, 22 oz bone in ribeye, whipped mashed potatoes and creme brulee (with a hint of chocolate) for dessert.  Everything we tasted was purely amazing!  This is my favorite steakhouse by far.  Can't wait to go back!",

    "text": "MA$$IVE DI$APPOINTMENT.  I've been to the Golden Steer about half a dozen times. Last night was the first time in about  6 years. It has a retro, old school Vegas vibe. Unfortunately that's about all it has going for it now.  Last night was such a tacky, mediocre experience and when dinner for two was $384, it's just awful. The waiters were all very friendly and the meat was good, but that was about it. There is a plaque on the front entrance stating that proper dress is required. I can't imagine where they draw the line. The room had plenty of men in T-shirts and foam trucker hats and women dressed like they belonged with a guy in a foam trucker hat. The first chair my husband sat in had a shot seat cushion that collapsed.  The room is nice and dim and the atmosphere is continuously ruined by large families with plenty of young children on their phones taking flash photos or tables filming everything with their phone's  light on. In such a dim room, it's very annoying.  The room is swarming with busboys and waiters in oversized ill-fitting black jackets. I don't think I've ever seen so high a staff to customer ratio. Unfortunately, service was still slow and lackluster at best. I had to remind them of our drink order and I had to refill our wine glasses.   We started with the table side caesar salad for two. Instead of being prepared in a wooden bowl rubbed with garlic, it was prepared in a large pebble finished translucent plastic bowl like you'd see on ice in a cheap salad bar.  The bowl with the big plastic salad spoons created a loud annoying clapping sound.  I  didn't want to watch, just wanted it to end. The salad was fine but the table side presentation was just a bore, at best.  We had the Chateaubriand which came with lots of veggies and also ordered two lobster tails. The meat was fine. The accompanying hollandaise and bearnaise sauces were already coagulating in their little stainless gravy boats. The asparagus was under cooked and totally void of any seasoning, the broccoli nearly raw and equally bland and the carrots cooked to mush and again, no sign of seasoning. Think hospital food. A waiter asked how the food was and I told him how bad the veggies were. He kind of shrugged and said they're just steamed. Whatever. They're just horrible.  The lobster tails, $75 each were on the dry, chewy side. Not horrible but by no means excellent.  We had a bottle of riesling wine, one of the cheaper bottles on the list at $50. It was good.   As dinner concluded, two different waiters asked how everything was and I told them. One feigned surprise and the other understood. Both told me that they had no choice in how things were done there. Apologies and excuses are fine, I suppose, but they don't change the fact that it was a mediocre experience worsened by the ridiculous price.  They were kind enough to comp the wine and both offered us drinks or dessert. We declined. We just wanted to leave. The final bit of tackiness was when we paid. They bring a portable card reader to the table and it has preset buttons for the tip. 15%, 20% etc. It's a stupid way to take care of the bill. I'd much prefer that they just take my card and bring me a receipt to sign, like  a nice restaurant would do.    Considering all the dining options in Las Vegas, I can't think of a single reason to ever go to the Golden Steer.   We won't be back.",

The waiter(Tom/Tommy) was going to get us a wine list, never did. He barely even came back to the table. He wasn't very personable and waited over my shoulder as I entered in a tip and also pointed at the receipt showing me which gratuity examples there were for him.

Make sure you have a reservation or you could be waiting in the crowded bar for over an hour on a Monday night!

My partner had a huge 22oz rib eye which he said was one of the best steaks he ever had.  We shared the loaded humongous baked potato and added some asparagus for greenery. It was alot of food and a fantastic meal.  A fun blast to the past. We sat in the booth frequented by Pat Morita and our host was full of hilarious stories about his visits. It was a entertaining tasty evening.",

No. You haven't eaten a caesar's salad until Bobby has made one for you at the Golden Steer. We then get our prime ribs and lyonnaise potatoes. Awesome food. The finale however stole the show. The table ordered the bananas foster and the cherries jubilee. The cherries are likely the best dessert I have ever had. And i love good dessert. If you do nothing else, order the caesar salad and finish it off with cherries jubilee. Seriously. It could all end then and you would have lived a full life. Bon apetit",

The hostess was friendly and immediately walked us to the Dean Martin booth.  Lighting and decor were exactly what I expected - perfect for that old-school, \"Rat Pack\" dinner experience.  Our waiter was soft-spoken and attentive, checking in on us 3 times between order and check.  We enjoyed the Rib Eye, Prime Rib (end cut), Chicken Parmigiana, stuffed mushrooms & creamed spinach - all delicious and cooked to order, though it's worth noting the creamed spinach seemed more like cream w/ spinach.  No room for dessert this time, so we've already agreed to share an entree next time.  Overall, a great meal.",

The Golden Steer looks like a total dive on the outside, but inside it's the room that time forgot. Everything looks exactly like it would have back when the Rat Pack was said to be among the Steer's clientele. Service is equally old-school - your glasses will never be empty and every crumb quickly swept.  The menu is equally traditional - steaks, creamed spinach, etc. It's cooked to order and tasty.  We've gone here to celebrate signing big deals, but we've also just gone to get a great steak. It's worth the cab ride.",

The steak they brought us was defiantly not a Petite Filet, and we both noticed, but just ate it because it was there.  When we told our waiter, he told us we should have informed him as soon as they brought us our meal.  The wine list is average.  The Caesar Salad is the best!  The asparagus is plain, and the mushrooms are just ok.  For the price point, I would choose somewhere else.  You are basically paying for the atmosphere here.  If you are looking for some old school Vegas atmosphere, go here.  Our waiter seemed to be lost, and had a team of every single employee in the restaurant who insisted on introducing themselves the entire meal.  I prefer to have 3 to 4 people come to my table during a meal.  It feels less intimate with a tribe of servers, runners, and busers.  1 server, 1 runner, 1 busser, and 1 sommelier.",

The creamed spinach was runny, you needed a spoon to eat it. The whipped potatoes were too thin and had no \"whip\".   For dessert we ordered the plain cheesecake and the cherries jubilee. The cheesecake was very flat and mediocre at best and the cherries Jubilee was runny and not good. Then I ordered a cappuccino that said it had 8 different liqueurs in it, however it was way too strong and was basically liquor, no cappuccino flavor.    The ambience of the restaurant is nice and it is definitely old school!  I loved the decor and the old leather booths. But if you're looking for a nice steakhouse with a good meal this is definitely not the place for you.   If you are looking for old-school ambience and mediocre food then go for it!",

I love table side cooking, and felt that it's a big lost for modern fine dinning experience, unless you are here.  Yes, they do table side cooking! Only thing they could do better is if the prices were 20 years old too! I kid, but the prices aren't bad at all and cheaper than most fine dinning establishment on the strip.",

The wait staff are professionals, they know their product inside and out, they have the gift of making each dining patron feel like royalty.

If you order a dessert it is prepared right in front of you (flambe and all). To all those in the Yelposphere who are debating on whether to try it out......it's worth the money you spend.

Food: Prime Rib is a specialty on the menu but I've had the bone-in ribeye twice and am obsessed. Perfectly seasoned and cooked to the temperature of your liking. Never overcooked or undercooked - True steak professionals! Their sides are delicious too - I've tried the mushrooms, whipped potatoes, and creamed spinach. Their seasoning is definitely on point here!   Service: Nothing memorable (...TBH) however no complaints   The steak here is So. Dang. Good. I'll definitely be back just for the delicious food!",

It's a classic place with booths waiters in suits. Everyone was friendly but service seemed rushed. We ordered the table Caesar salad for two, 22oz ribeye , lobster tail, Mac n cheese, and twice baked potato. Caesar salad was amazing, the steak was delicious and so were the sides but the lobster tail although big, it was over cooked. We shared everything it was more than enough. My husband got a slice of cake and candle for his bday. Wine I believe I got merlot by the glass about $15/glass and my hubby drank Stella $7. Overall it was good experience! We will come back next year ... with stretchy pants :)",

    "text": "My wife and I were out for a drive and we were passing by the Golden Steer and I asked her if she ever ate there. She said yes, about 30 years ago. I said I have never been. She said she would take me for dinner one night. Well that day came and I was looking forward to a good steak. We arrived and were seated right away. I have to admit the decor did bring back the old days. Yes, \"old blue eyes was playing\". Our waiter/waiters set us up right away and after a few minutes took are orders. Wife's was the Chicken Parmesan, I went for the 24oz Porterhouse with a mixed salad and their big baked potato. Now mind you, there is two of us. They brought the rolls out to start and only bring 3 for two people, have to question that theory! Then my salad came out and looked big but then I noticed the plate was just small so lettuce kept falling off. Next the main courses came. Wife's Chicken Parm was just that, chicken, cheese, sauce and a side of ravioli, 3 of them again, not two, not four 3. Pasta would have been nice.  Now to my Porterhouse. Just like the salad the plate was to small for the steak. Hard time cutting it and keeping it on plate. Would have helped if the steak knife was sharp. Don't get me wrong it was good but I've had better and cheaper. Next I went for the baked potato. Took the first half and started to eat. The first few bites were just right but as I got to the middle it was still hard, not cooked through.  In a place like this that has been around since the 50's and the prices the dinner should have been spot on. Doubt if we will be back anytime soon.",

The bar is right in front of you and the dining room is to the right.  We had a large group and got the Prix-Fixe menu option two.  Toasted ravioli were tasty, marinara sauce was good. Stuffed seafood mushroom caps were also very good.   Caesar Salad was made tableside, only negative was our server did not call attention to the salad being made, so most of our party missed out.  New York strip with whipped potatoes.  Normally I'm a rib eye or prime rib fan, but the NY strip was huge!!  Hands down the best NY Strip steak I have ever had!!  So juicy, soft, and flavorful.  I gave my dessert away since I don't really eat sweets, but I'm told the Chocolate Cake was devine.  I highly recommend the Golden Steer to anyone wanting great food, great service, and great atmosphere.  I'd much rather come here than go to a place in a strip hotel.",

Impeccable service from the highly professional wait staff.  Pros: The server who was deboning a Dover sole thought it was slightly undercooked. He served it, but immediately put in an order for another one. He was right, but it was definitely edible! But the second one was perfect. Love love love the mobile credit card machine which has been used in other countries for decades! Bravo, Golden Steer!  Cons:  Guests wearing shorts, baseball caps, and getting louder and louder, behaving like they were in a local bar.  They should be seated in a separate section!!",

I don't prefer sauces on my meat but I gave the peppercorn one a try on the side, but decided the beef was so good it didn't need anything to mask it's flavor and I ate the whole 22 ounces just plain. We sat at the bar and the service was super friendly and attentive. Don't be scared off by the flashy neon exterior this is a classic steakhouse with bowtie servers. My only complaint and the reason for holding back a fourth star is they close up kind of early for a place like Vegas. By 11:30 they had turned the lights out cleaned up and were ushering us out the door. So there is room for improvement...but the steak was one of the best I've ever had!",

    "text": "This place.   Steakhouses in Vegas are in my view kind of a scam. Like everything else there they cost a fortune and eating in a casino basement, regardless of food quality, just doesn't seem that cool. And if you have even basic skills, or skills you can pick up by watching YouTube, and know where to buy quality meat you can cook a fantastic steak on your own grill for a small fraction of what you pay in Vegas. And even if you want to get a steak at a steakhouse in Vegas at the better ones quality is pretty consistent in terms of the meat so you're paying for brand, or to eat where so and so eats, or sides and appetizers.   In other words, you're paying for the scene not for some meal you can't produce yourself.   But, steakhouse scenes can be a fun experience and this one is tops. It's off-strip, old-Vegas, and looks the the part (if you want modern, sleek and stainless go elsewhere). Take an uber or taxi (the wine list is good, they have a great sommelier who can really help you find the exact bottle you want for what you're having, and parking sucks). And then enjoy.  This is an old Rat Pack hangout and it still has that kind of feel. You can imagine JFK dining in a back room and it's like you're stepping back in time with the furnishings and ambience inside. So while it's not cheap it's an experience worth paying for if you're into that kind of thing and the food is excellent. Really good (and really big) steaks, very solid standard sides, they do a real bananas foster dessert, and they make good old-school drinks the right way. Again, don't drive.   One thing that impressed me was that our server actually suggested we get one steak and split it rather than two when we were talking through our order - that's good service rather than trying to make the bill as big as possible service - and we should have taken his advice, we ended up with picnic lunch the next day for a desert trip.  Also relaxed not rushed service, this is not a turn and burn place.   But, regardless, this is not a cheap place but so worth it.  So look, to each their own, but in my view this beats the strip steakhouses hands down. Steaks are steaks, this place is costly but not outrageous for what you get, and the scene is just way more interesting than the \"name\" places on the strip.",

As they say don't judge a book by its cover well arriving at this non descript place from the 1950's on the corner of the strip a Sahara makes you long for Yesteryear when all of Las Vegas probably looked liked this.  Truly unremarkable as you drive up and enter then you are transported back to the days Frank, Sammy, Dean, and the boys swinging in for cocktails or sitting in one of the many red booths, or in our case our party of 12 is escorted to the back dining room where we have all the privacy in the world.   We sit and Joey our waiter begins the hey I'm not here to sell you anything extra I'm going to simply tell you what we are known for then let you make your own decision.  Those are words to live by unfortunately that's when Joey got rolling about the Shellfish platters, appetizers, etc and simply would NOT LET THE **** UP until I said listen we are all grown men, we know how to order a meal, please allow us to order whatever the hell we want in as many quantities as we want and shut the **** UP~! Again he interceded with the Have to have the Caesar salad mantra then you don't need 2 potatoes.. UGH if a guy wants to O.D. on starch allow him.  I almost replaced him but he finally got the point.   The Good:  Shrimp Cocktail, huge cold horseradish on side extra kick up tasty & Fresh 4 were enough for 2 persons $19.00  Escargots de Bourgogne | 16 fresh with sauce just enough to accent them without being overpowered  Alaskan King Crab Cocktail | 16 Hunks of crabmeat with same cocktail sauce that kicked up enough with butter made this a cant miss.  Caesar Salad made table side $11.00 per person was good - not spectacular just good  The Great Rib Eye Steak, Bone-in 22oz. | $54.00 4 of these were ordered to a man stated best steak they ever had.  New York Strip 16oz. | 50$  3 of these 2 absolutely perfect charred with temperature on the button flavor off the charts  1 was sent back overcooked then when returned it looked nuked then grilled quickly it as not consumed.   3 Filet mignon Oscars with crabmeat were all outstanding -  1 Market price $75.00 Australian lobster tail was simply OK a bit tough  Sides:  All excellent from the baked potatoes to the creamed spinach to the sauteed mushrooms, and twice baked potato they simply make each dish outstanding.   The Bad - the Steak being taken back and then returned unable to be consumed was a definite mark off.  Even had to tell them Take it off the bill at the end should have been done without asking.  Service was good after old Joey stopped selling me like a car salesman; it's not our 1st time dining out.  Private room for 12 of us was fantastic and rest of staff was A Plus.  Definitely on the repeat list when in Vegas!",

We started if off with the seafood appetizer, stuffed mushrooms and fried calamari.  All the appetizers were delicious.  We then had their Caesar salad which is made right there at your table.  I love anchovies so I was very impressed with the dressing.  I ordered the Oscar filet mignon.  All I can say is that it just melted in my mouth, it was so tender!!!! We ordered the twice baked potato, creamed spinach & steamed vegetables. I tried a little of everything, but I would definitely recommend the twice baked potato. It was crispy on the outside and creamy deliciousness on the inside.   The cocktails were good and strong just how I like them, and the service was absolutely impeccable.  We were all so full we couldn't even order dessert, but the table next to ours ordered the banana foster and it looked amazing!!!  They brought out a dessert for my cousin with a crazy sparkler on top.  Let's just say the evening was off to an excellent start.  Next stop Intrigue Nightclub to work off those extra lbs!!!",

The Golden Steer is nostalgic, some of the staff has been there for decades and every time we've been lucky to connect with an old timer who will share a story or two about his time there. We struck up a terrific conversation with the maitre de one evening who graciously offered us a quick tour of the restaurant - I didn't want to interrupt the other diners so we asked him to share a story instead...he obliged and mentioned a back door a certain member of the infamous Rat Pack had to use. Fascinating to hear.   Besides all the nostalgia this place is fantastic. I adore dimly lit dining rooms with those terrific naugahyde booths that line the perimeter. They envelope you almost like a hug.  Steaks are excellent...bone in ribeye is my usual and the last couple of times we were smart to share it as the portions are giant. The baked potato, perfectly baked with all the fixings is by itself too much for two people. We've had the petite filet and New York as well, both equally delicious. Lyonnais potatoes are a treat.  Classic cocktails flow easily (plan for Uber or taxi, GS has them on speed dial).  We always finish our meals with the bananas Foster table side, it's a treat complete with banana liqueur, butter and brown sugar en flambe.  Sure there are other steak restaurants, but this one has history and a charm all its own.  What's even better is the location...no casinos or valet parking. Can't wait for the next visit!",

It was memorably bad, the kind of bad that has the whole table on edge and wanting to leave. Allow me to explain.....   From top to bottom the whole experience was terrible.   Service: BAD and got worse: . The waiter visited our table EXACTLY 3 times in the 90 minutes we were there. Since the wine list was spotty, I went for a beer. In this day and age it is not unreasonable to ask for the selection since no drink menu was placed on our table. More to the point don't roll your eyes at me either and look put out, how hard is it to say Bud, Bud Light, et al. (Seriously no local craft beers?).  The next and biggest sin in my book was not clearing the table between courses. When you see the appetizer plates, the salad plates sitting at the table, perhaps its time to clear before you try to WEDGE the next course in.  Clear the table BEFORE you ask about desert.   If the service was bad the food bordered on edible. It was by far some of the worst food I have had in some time.   The appetizers:   Toasted Ravioli: Not only was it clearly a food service product (Sysco perhaps) it was not properly fried so the interior was not completely melted. (Food temp seems to be an issue with this place too) The marinara sauce had a canned quality to it and was pretty much lifeless.   Shrimp Cocktail: Shrimp was decent and the cocktail sauce was just okay. I also appreciate the addition of horseradish which helped pump up the cocktail sauce.   Bread: First basket was okay, the second clearly was old. I could have taken an at bat against Madison Baumgarner with it.   Salad/Soup  Table-side Ceasar: While they did prepare ours as part of the larger party next to us (and honestly I don't expect the poor guy doing it to make just two for us) it was dull and lifeless lacking much flavor. The croutons tasted like they were from a prior decade.   Onion Soup: The broth was actually okay (more like an Au Jus) but again the issue of properly heating things reared its ugly head. The soup looked like it had been placed under the salamander and was never brought up to a proper temperature. The soup was just warm at service and that made the Swiss cheese clump within minutes into a curd like manner.   Mains  Prime Rib: Not a lot to say here but it was clearly NOT slow roasted but rather quick cooked. No seasoning and it was tough and quite chewy. The Jus had no taste either.   No desert as we were thoroughly disgusted at this point. Its clear that this place is on its last legs and perhaps needs to a featured restaurant on Kitchen Nightmares or Restaurant Impossible.  Either that our closed to put and anybody who is thinking about eating there out of their misery",

Sure, it wasn't on the strip nor it didn't have any flashy decor; rather, it was dark, walls plastered with pics of famous actors and actresses from the heydays of LV, oozing with rich history. If only the walls could talk ...  As for the food, the quality of meat they prided themselves on wasn't just fluff; the 22oz Ribeye with bone in was very juicy and flavorful. The medium rare steak cut with ease, and the amount of plump fat was just right.  Like other $$$ steak houses, my heavenly creamed spinach was a la carte. Ate it all up.  I'll have to come back again to see how consistent they are. Until then, fly me to the moon ...",

    "text": "So, the next stop on my tour of old school Vegas steakhouses brought us to the Golden Steer Steakhouse tonight. After doing a bit of research and reading a fair share of reviews, I was a cautiously optimistic about what the evening may hold.  I have to say that, for the most part, this was a fine experience and I will certainly be back!  Ordered-  - Caesar salad ($12) - Whipped potatoes ($9) - Rib Eye Steak, Bone-in (22 oz.) ($54) - bread basket (complimentary)  (+) Ambiance and Decor are absolutely incredible! When setting up the reservation, I had requested the Frank Sinatra booth, if possible. Even though we were just a party of 2, they were able to accommodate my request! Usually, it is reserved for parties of 3-4 I was told. This was greatly appreciated! I was geeking out at the thought of dining in the same space where the 'Chairman of the Board' would dine as well! So. Freaking. Cool! The  bar area looked really sharp too! I can't wait to come back and enjoy some drinks here! (+) Service was off the charts outstanding! Everyone was attentive to our needs and checked in on us to make sure everything was good! Fantastic service all around! (+) The steaks were so tender and juicy and full of flavor! It's right up there as one of the best steaks I have ever had! (see pics) (+) Ordered one of the Caesar salads just to see them prepare it table side. lol It was prepared much faster than I thought and tasted great!  (-) those whipped potatoes were the only part of the meal that was not superb! They were actually quite disappointing and tasted like 'instant mashed potatoes'. Ugh. Definitely will avoid that next time!  It's a matter of when, not if, I will return to the Golden Steer! The steaks are big and tasty, the service is incredible, and the old school charm and history of the place is something I can't get enough of!!  I really went back and forth between 4 or 5 stars, which is why I wish Yelp! would institute 1/2 stars into the rating system. I will likely update after some more visits...so for now it will be..  4.5 stars!  Woohoo! Pretty f*cking awesome!",

    "text": "We were recommended Golden Steer as alternative to eating at pricey hotel steakhouse. Located in a bit of a run down area. Close to Strip. Great old fashioned interior ambience, prompt seating with reservation and expedited ordering and delivery of food by very good wait staff. Cocktails were good, a little on the strong side. I didn't care for the Golden Steer, regular martinis were enjoyed. Shrimp and mushroom appetizers were good, filet was okay; dry and no real flavor, sides such as creme corn are average size and okay, creme brulee dessert was not very good, had an un appetizing dark filling, left with smoky and bland aftertaste. Prices were almost as high as hotel. They bring a portable credit card machine and wait, prefer to take our time and tip with out waiter present. If the food, specifically the steak, had been over the top I would have given higher stars.",

We get the booth by the hostess stand that started the night. No one saying happy anniversary but again we were still being positive. We sit and wait 10 minutes before the server greeted us. He drops off the menu and leaves for another 15 minutes. He comes by never to share the specials for the evening as we get our salad and soup he doesnt offer fresh grown pepper.  He never checked back until we were almost  done with dinner. The restaurant wasnt busy but he had a table that seemed like his family as he was hanging out with. Had to ask for water several times as well as to ask 2 servers for our check. We get the check I tell him we had a groupon as he takes my phone which was also my purse and walks away with it. Then he brings back the check without my credit card or a pen. I get up to speak to the manager and all she says is sorry. That's it she sucked just like Henry which wasnt his name. We will never go back. The food was amazing but the services was the worse we ever had.",

It has been several years since I ate that slice of beefy heaven and I can still remember the delirious waves of culinary ecstasy that each bite sent swirling through my body.  No, it is not cheap, but its not the most expensive steak house in town either. Their baked potatoes are legendary for their size and flavor, so at least one person in your party should order that. Service is classy and attentive but not in your face. Their bar is gorgeous and glamorous too!  If you would enjoy traveling to another era for a couple of hours, then do try this place.

I had never heard of this place & even was a bit skeptical when he first mentioned it and I've been to Vegas about 5x per year. How could I not have heard of it??    Amazing is what I describe this place as. We got there early. Chris had  a reservation he made the same day. The hostess was unable to find , which may have been a problem on a weekend night; But we sat at the bar and caught up about our day...& tried to warm the crotchedy bartender up. Fail on that. He's old school and seemed  stressed by his 10 or so patrons and staff. Premium liquors and he poured what he liked , it seemed. He had some good wines... No list at the bar..& almost grumpy when you ask for one..lol... BUT I do get a kick out of old codgers like this. So there was no way this guy was gonna get to me on the last night in Vegas. The bartender knew all the wines nonetheless;and pours a good pour. Impressive. Don't try carrying the tab over to the table.. Nope. He's not having that either.   The decor is very old Vegas .. A bit mafioso... Many celebs from the era of when have been here : Marilyn Monroe; Joe Dimaggio; Mario Andretti, to name just the few we saw over the booths named after them and the restaurant  has that feel to it. I personally love character in a place and you will find it here. We ordered the chopped salad... With the Roquefort dressing ... It was divine. The serving size just enough. My date got the ribeye and I the filet...  My usual , when I eat steak. The twice baked potatoe.. And we shared the creamed spinache.. We ordered a Rodney Strong Cabernet.. Offed the bottle and two extra dirty Martinis ; it's Vegas, right?! I can't tell you how amazing this meal was ... Not that I could fit another bite in... My boyfriend didn't want the meal to end without a dessert ... So we ordered my favorite creme brulee ... And shared it... Yummy... It's not as vanilla--y or creme de la creme as I recall in France but still good ... And bc the waiter liked us so much... He said it was on him... Cheers to that!.. Go there ready to drop some $$ ... It's ala carte ordering ... And this was easily a $180 meal... But oh so worth it... :-) I would say my return factor is 10-10; even with the grouchy bartender.",

Everyone acted like they were at a funeral, no one smiled or made eye contact, the servers seemed like they didn't want to be bothered and it was a very unwelcoming vibe. A good expensive meal needs to be accompanied by good service but Golden Steer staff was rude and snobby.  It was such a disappointment because we were really looking forward to eating there and having a great experience. We won't be back and I hope the staff can cheer up and learn some guest service techniques 101 so they don't ruin the business.",

    "text": "We usually take my dad to Del Frisco's when he's in town, and he loves that place. However, this time, we decided to also try the Golden Steer. I'd been there before and like the ambiance (even though it's a bit worn), but I don't like being cheated, so I won't be back. Read on if interested.  We arrived early and had a drink at the bar. I ordered a very standard Cosmo, which the very grouchy bartender, who barely acknowledged us, is apparently unable to make. I asked him what he had put in it that made it so sweet, and he responded that he'd put in... pineapple juice! It was quite yucky and it was obvious that I was not happy, yet he made no attempt to make me happy. My dad doesn't like the fuss, so we paid for the drinks and took them into the dining room when the table was ready.  The nice waiter asked me if everything was ok with my drink, and I said I hated it. He was fantastic and immediately offered to give me a real Cosmo (for free, of course). He went and fetched it from the bar and I was definitely pleased with that. The food was decent, but not outstanding. However, when the  bill came, I saw that I was charged for a Cosmo -- what a job! I'd paid for the first one at the bar and the second one was supposed to be comped. Turns out the hostess and the waiter thought I'd ordered the first one from the waiter and thus charged me for it. How is that possible? They saw me walk into the dining room with the drink and he was the one who asked me if I had enjoyed it, and since he hadn't taken the order, it was clear that the drink must have come from the bar. I was quite flabbergasted by this and told the waiter to take the drink off the bill. He said it would take 15 minutes to do this, as they were so busy. What? THat's insane. As an alternative, he offered another drink instead. I didn't want another drink. as I had to drive, but they made it very clear to me that it was terribly inconvenient for them to remove this drink -- which was their mistake in the first place. The whole experience left a bad taste in my mouth and I will most certainly not recommend this place to tourist friends. I don't want them to get bad drinks and then get cheated!",

The history of this place alone makes it a once in a lifetime dining experience. Few things remain from the old Vegas, I hope this place never goes away.

It says proper dress attire required and people came in in sweat shirts and blue jeans.  There were several people yelling on their cell phones which if they had any manners they would have taken it outside or at the very least, management would have asked them to take it outside.  The food was normal steakhouse food, but we won't go back.  $220 later, I'll go back to Del fresco's anyway.  I never mind the price if the whole experience is worth it.  VERY disappointed.",

How convenient there was a Groupon as well!  Well, as soon as our waiter learned we had a Groupon, he treated us like dirt.  Didn't take a drink order.  When we finally got to place one, he brought them after our salad had arrived.  Terrible service.  If you're struggling and need to partner with Groupon to get new customers, something is wrong to start with and you better make sure you do your best to get those customers back.  Food was good - but their prices are pretty steep for what you are getting.  I used to think highly of this place - old school charm, etc, but they are clearly going downhill.",

    "text": "I don't know if it was an off night but this is just barely an okay steakhouse.  So many better choices in town that do it much better.  I have been wanting to go here literally for years, as this was my stepfather's favorite steakhouse, who passed away about 6-7 years ago.  A coupon came up on Groupon so my husband and I had a date night, and overall were pretty unenthusiastic about our meal.  Here's the good: The ribeye on the bone is really tasty, and it comes served with au jus that makes it taste even better.  However, there's very very little discernible char, which would have made it incredible.  I also ordered it medium rare, and it came out more on the medium side.  I actually enjoyed the flavor of this steak more than the American waygu at Cut, if you can believe it.   The service and the atmosphere is also mostly good, but the food came out so fast that we felt rushed to eat and get out.  We literally were back home in almost an hour after sitting down to eat.  Cocktails are pretty phenomenal, this might be a good place to do happy hour.  They know how to mix a drink better that I've had in most places.  The bad: The fillet mignon was tough.  This is supposed to be the most tender meat, but the ribeye came out much more tender than this.  Also, it was ordered by my husband medium rare, but was so rare it was almost inedible in some areas.  Why he didn't send it back was beyond me.  The french onion soup came out lukewarm and not hot, and the cheese was not melted all the way.  When you took a bite, you could see the entire slice of cheese come up out of the bowl.  I implored him to send it back, but being a dork he ate it.  Caesar salad - they do the table side Caesar service and it was okay, a little overdressed and on the oily side.  There are much better places to get a quality caesar salad for more than half the price.  Garlic bread - supposed to be \"famous,\" which reminded me of the meals I used to have at the Smoke House in Burbank, CA across from Warner Brothers Studios that had the greatest garlic bread ever.  This was prepared somewhat similar, but nowhere nearly as good.  And for $5, they give you a whopping three small pieces of it.   So I would not recommend this steakhouse at all, and recommend instead The Flame at El Cortez, or Vic and Anthony's in the Golden Nugget for more of an old school Vegas steakhouse that is much better in the same price range or lower.  I still have to try Hugo's Cellar, which I'm told is also similar but have not made it out to try it yet.",

Chop salad was very good with blue cheese dressing.  Overall probably the worst steak house I have been to in Vegas.  Avoid this place. way to many great steak houses.",

I geek-ed myself up to go check this place out cause I'm a history buff.Food is not that good. I ordered a NY Strip ($40) medium, when I got the steak it was burned I mean burned, when your suppose to be eating a medium steak its' not suppose to taste like charcoal, it tasted like a low end steak. Mash Potatoes ($8) that I got wore horrible, I expected fresh made mash potatoes for the price that I was paying, they were definitely instant mash potatoes, no doubt. Salad ($8) I ordered with ranch was horrible, it was drowned in dressing and then when they cut the lettuce they put the bottom of the head in the salad and it's nasty, salad didn't taste fresh at all. All in all I spent $64 on a meal that was in all honesty worth $17. I was amazed at how when I'm paying $40 for a steak its burnt. Very Disappointed in the food.  In all honesty when you look at this place from the outside your expecting a cheaper steak house and you figure its old etc, But to pay $64 for a NY strip dinner is crazy, maybe that's why there was only 2 other tables in the restaurant. If they charge $64 for a steak dinner then Outback needs to charge $128 cause there NY steak dinner is light years better.   Like I said don't spend money on the food WAY WAY overrated. If you want to see the place they do have a bar where you can have drinks and look at the place.",

This gave my friend and I (two girls) a chance to peruse the menu, as we had been invited and didn't know much as to what to expect.  After the initial sticker shock on the prices of the prime steaks, she and I settled on sharing a 18 oz. prime rib au jus with horseradish cream (the smallest size they had; $40) and a Jumbo Baked Potato ($8.)  They were both delicious.   The wines were good and fairly priced per glass in the low teens.  We could hear each other converse which personally I appreciate.  I would have liked to try the authentic Caesar Salad ($12 per person) made table-side, but we really didn't think we could eat that much so we didn't order it.  If it cost a bit less - say $8 per person, maybe we would have tried it.  The service was attentive and not overbearing.    I'd definitely come back.  I enjoyed the atmosphere of the Rat Pack era Las Vegas - the booths even have plaques with the names of the people who would reserve them, such as Dean Martin, Elvis Presley and Frank Sinatra.  There was a man playing piano in the bar.    I would like to see this restaurant busier - by 11pm when we finished the place was pretty empty and it's as good as any of the more crowded places at the strip hotels.  People need to know that it's still there!  (Since 1958.)",

We went on a Tuesday and the place was just about packed by the time we left.  I knew the inside would be dated.  Their menu describes it as Turn of the Century San Francisco.  Now that I think of it, it does remind me of the back food area at the Golden Gate Casino downtown.  Lots of red and brown going on.  Contrary to the other reviews, I thought the table side Caesar was pretty good.  The french onion soup was a little on the cheesy side, but who can really complain about that.  The lobster bisque was also good but of course any lobster bisque could always use a little more lobster in my opinion.  Auntie and I had the crab and fillet, GF just had the fillet.  I had mine cooked medium and it came out just right.  The crab was okay if not a little dry.  The entrees came out fairly quickly, actually within a few minutes of finishing the soup/salad...guess I prefer this to waiting too long.  Service was fine, although I was expecting a little more.",

Not going to be an issue if your taking a cab. The interior is something that we were both glad we were experiencing at night rather than daytime. If you know what i mean .The filet my friend ordered was perfect but my ribeye was something i honestly could have made better at home. For a dry aged 22 ounce ribeye i expected to be knocked out. It didn't happen. It reminded me of a steak cooked at Denny's or a roadside diner.The cream spinach was soupy and although it tasted delicious the texture was off. I chose this placed based on a locals recommendation. I think that local needs to explore other steak houses. Good ..... but not knock your socks off great.  Thus 3 stars.",

    "text": "SUMMARY: My Dad and I wanted the old-school, real-deal Vegas steakhouse experience. We got it!  THE SETTING: Red leather seats, crisp tablecloths, some Sinatra drifting by in the background. Waiters in bowties dressed better than the patrons. DO NOT LET THE CHINTZY FACADE OUTSIDE FOOL YOU - this is serious business.  THE SERVICE: My father has recently had a stroke, and as such has had to seriously limit his salt intake. This was noted when the reservation was taken, and the hostess took great pains to make sure that everything was setup to accommodate his needs. If we needed water or bread or anything, a waiter was right there to provide it.  THE FOOD: First and foremost, the tableside caesar HAS to be gotten. Anchovy, raw egg, the genuine article. I do not exaggerate when I say that we ate the salad one slice of Romaine at a time, as each piece had its own unique combination of elemental flavors.  'Elemental' was the watchword for the steaks, as well; simply beef plus time for aging in a controlled environment. Cut like butter, melted in the mouth, crisp on the outside and perfect-rare inside, sitting in a pool of savory juices.  The salad and steak were so filling we split only a potato on the side, with butter and sour cream. It was good, not great, but hey, it's a potato - it can be done poorly or decently, there is no 'amazing potato'.   The only slight miss was the creme brulee; the texture was a bit lumpish and it had clearly been kept in the fridge, then quickly blowtorched to melt sugar on top.  The coffee was excellent.  THE DRINKS: 2 martinis each, well-prepared, no complaints.  THE BILL: For four mixed drinks, two salads, two steaks, one potato, two coffees and one creme brulee, $200.",

    "text": "My parents, my cousin and her husband, and my gf and I went to the Golden Steer awhile back. My gf used to go here a lot when she was in college and always talked about it, how awesome it used to be to get a serious steak dinner in an old school steakhouse with charisma and old school charm. Johnny the original bartender is still there, been told he's been there for 50+ years. (I bet he has some stories)  Being from the Midwest and raising cattle my parents love a good steak. And my cousin and her husband are cowboys(girls) from Red River NM and they love a nice piece of meat as well.  This was perfect, they were all staying at the Flamingo Hilton (behind the flamingo tower) and I swung by to pick them up.  Being so close to the strip it's an easy trek up LV Blvd from flamingo.  We walked in and were immediately greeted and escorted to a table in the middle of the room, we wouldn't all fit in the few booths available. The place was remarkably quiet for the amount of people in there, a huge group of Texans with cowboy hats occupied a table of about 12 in the middle of the room but they kept it down even though there were about 4 bottles of wine empty on the table already haha.  I ordered the Ribeye and it was out of this world. Such a big piece of meat!!!! Ribeye is my favorite cut of steak, the marbling is perfect in this cut and it holds a flavor really well. Some cuts of steak that you try to season never really hold a marinade but ribeyes do. I had the baked potato and it was huge as well, I didn't finish it all.  My whole family still talks about their experience at \"that steakhouse\" in Vegas talking about how big and reasonably prices the food is. And they're from the Midwest where prices are about 60% of Vegas standards for the same quality and size of steaks so that's saying something.   Will definitely be back someday. Still waiting for a steakhouse to do better than this in this town, however there have been a few that are close to comparable.  Overall experience was 5 stars, Can't wait for my parents to come back so we can go again (since they paid (: )",

    "text": "I wish I had a 'to be fair' line I could throw in here, but it's impossible. My wife and I ate at the Golden Steer on 5/16/13 (Her review is before the Golden Steer plant's review below mine.), and the food was simply horrible. For starters, we sat at the Marilyn Monroe table. Yes, the place has been open for a while, but they do stress the old star-power a bit much, making one wonder of the quality of the food. You'll see why I say this:   When the bread and butter was brought out, we were eating it and noticed a really strange flavor. I tasted the butter on its own, and it tasted as if it had sat in the fridge for a very - very long time before being brought to our table. Sure we wanted to sit in Marilyn's booth, but we did not want to eat the same butter that was served to her!!! Right then and there I wanted to get out as fast as possible. Nevertheless, we decided to overlook this, notify the waiter, and give them another chance. He didn't bring out any more bread and butter, hence the bad butter must've been all they had. NOTE: Steak is often cooked with butter....  The ceasar salad came out and it was prepared at the table. We passed on the raw egg, which I feel is a wise move after reading previous reviews alleging salmonella. Barring that, the salad was edible.   I ordered the ribeye medium rare, and my wife ordered the porterhouse steak. Mine actually was tasty, though bloody and borderline raw. My wife's porterhouse, on the other hand, was a different story. She told me her steak tasted a bit off, similar to liver. I took a taste. To me it tasted like pee! I spit the bite into my napkin.   The waiter attempted damage control by bringing her a slab of prime rib. She didn't like it. I tasted it, and it was bland, unsalted, and I have had better at $15 buffets - time and time again.   I really wish I didn't have to write such a scathing review, but this place is priced like an exclusive fine-dining establishment, yet prepares food like as if to act in direct defiance of the health dept. We will not be returning.",

Although the quality of the food was high, the taste left much to be desired. Service seemed very unorganized which is strange for such an established restaurant. The hostess seemed confused, multiple servers asked if anyone \"had gotten your drinks\" and \"did anyone ask you if you'd like dessert\". One server took the check with card in it even though \"it was not his table\". The facilities were dirty for the sake of not going into detail. Overall- for the money and drive- Hugo's got this place beat 10x over on quality, price, taste, cleanliness and service!",

It felt like real Vegas old school swank -- the old oil paintings of the West, the tuxedo-clad waiters doing a nice tableside Caesar salad, the giant steaks that are cooked right and moist.     I wonder if Elvis had a giant roman candle jabbed into his slice of birthday cake, too?  It lit the entire room up for 45 seconds.  That's the Golden Steer -- doing it big, doing it right.",

    "text": "I have driven by this restaurant hundreds, probably thousands, of times while growing up here in Vegas, and I had never tried out out until yesterday evening. I wish I had tried this place out earlier, as it proved to be some of the most excellent steak I have had in Vegas.  The real reason I held off on trying this place out for so long was the cost. It is an expensive restaurant, which each steak priced at least $35 and the Italian Specialties (Chicken Parmigiana, etc) running at about $26-$27. That being said, I did use a Groupon to eat here. The Groupon was good for $50, enough to really only cover one person.  The interior of the restaurant stands in stark contrast to the crappy strip mall that it resides in. It's dark, as classic Vegas restaurants tend to be, and has a wonderful atmosphere. It's definently obvious the place was built in 1958, and the history of the building is easy to see and feel.  The waiters couldn't have been nicer. They greeted me as though I were a regular in the place, and popped over my table from time to time to share stories about the more famous patrons (The Rat Pack, Elvis Presley, Mario Andretti) of the restaurant. Apparently, Robert De Niro's son also works here as a waiter, which doesn't make much sense...but hey, that's cool.  As an appetizer, I ordered the signature garlic bread ($5), which was pretty tasty. It's pretty much impossible not to make a huge mess when eating it, which makes it all the more fun. The regular bread was excellent as well, and came out so fresh and hot that I almost burned myself when I grabbed it. No complaints though, I'll take hot, fresh bread any day of the week :)  For the entree, I had the 14 oz. Top Sirloin steak ($37) and a side order of steak fries ($8). I am a seasoning and sauce fanatic...but this steak needed nothing extra. Much like Bob Taylor's Ranch House, the meat is cooked in such a way that the natural flavor of the meat is rich enough that no extra seasoning is necessary.   When all was said and done, my bill came out exactly to $50, so I just had to throw the waiters a tip. It was truly an excellent meal, and I would consider this in the upper echelon of Vegas steakhouses.",

    "text": "We had been waiting in anticipation of our dinner here with our 3 children. When we arrived the host was nice and talked a little with our son and gave him glow sticks to share with his 2 sisters.  We were sat down and the first thing I noticed is how loud it was in the dining area. We were in the corner \"Ali\" booth and I had a hard time conversing across the table.  The wine menu was on the higher end of price but a decent selection. My husband and I enjoyed wine yet the children were not offered anything other than water.  I had a petite filet and quite honestly it was not that amazing for $40. It was cooked to perfection but didn't have much for flavor. Even the juices were bland and lacking. ( My 2 younger children ordered the 12 oz filet and shared it and my older daughter had the petite and they were just as underwhelmed. )  Our sides that we ordered were the \"whipped potatoes\", broccoli and asparagus. The potatoes were obviously russet and thinned out with cream/ milk. They were runny and lacked much for flavor. The asparagus was ok but the broccoli was woody and tough.  Time for desserts... hard to mess them up. My husband and I had a port. My children ordered cheese cake, Creme Brule, and tiramisu. My son devoured the cheese cake so we assume it was good. The creme Brule was different... it was dark brown  but taste ok. Not great but not horrid. My other daughter waited patiently for her tiramisu to come out and when it finally did she anxiously put her fork to the desert only to find it frozen solid! We got the attention of the staff and he apologized quietly and took it away. He assured us it would be taken off the bill. Nothing else was offered.  When it was time to pay the bill the staff was quick to point out the \"tipping chart\" at the bottom of the bill. We eat out often with our 3 children, often at nicer establishments, and this was a complete turn off. It isn't like our children are naughty or making a mess. They are 10,12,14! They sat with just as many,if not more, manners than many adults. Will we be back? No most likely not. It is great for the tourist who wants to be where the \"greats\" have been. I personally think that for the $350 I would rather eat at Hugo's Cellar at Four Queens or The Steak House at Circus Circus.",

    "text": "Short version: terrible service and staff is rude, food is just ok, good cut but bland (my steak was extremely under cooked). I recommend you to go somewhere else for steak.   Long version: After all the great reviews I read, I had to try it out myself and I am SO DISAPPOINTED. Hear me out, I am a recent college grad 21 and my bf,24 so obviously we are the youngest people at the place but we dress like everybody else in the restaurant so they shouldn't treat us any differently right? Wrong! The host gave us the most condescending look as soon as we walked in and act like it was the end of the world when we said we don't have a reservation. I said \"no sir, we called in and we want the bar, which is first come first serve\" but he gave us exasperated sigh and gesture us to the general direction at the empty seats (the restaurant wasn't busy so there are lots of seats) so first impression is already a zero star. We sat on a small table and waiters flew by multiple times without a second glance at us. A group walked in after us and the host was overjoyed and he would probably lick their shoe if they ask him to. The waiters almost ran up to give them some menus and treat them like royalty and we are still waiting for someone to notice our presence there and give us the menus, a glass of water or anything really. 10min passes and finally someone came by to put a fork on our table. I kid you not he gave us the weirdest stare (does it help to mention that I'm Asian and my bf is Hispanic?) but at least we get some service going here right? Well that's all we got. The food came, my steak was under cooked the cut was good but the steak was bland I felt insulted and will not recommended anyone coming to eat here unless they want terrible service and condescending stares.",

    "text": "The good part about living 30 min from the strip, is time to write your review while your dinner date drives you back home. 8:30 reservation, we arrived a little early and I had a martini while we waited for our table....not a long wait, we were seated just before 8:30. I had a little sticker shock when I realized martini was $18 (including tip.) sometimes I forget about strip prices...it was an excellent martini though, extra dirty as requested.  We ordered basic dinner salads, a side of asparagus, a side of twice baked potatoes, I got a  petite filet and my husband got the 12 oz filet.   We received our salads promptly and noticed a few minutes later that two very loafed carts were going to the dining room beside the one we were in. Even at 8:30, the place was very busy. I was feeling pretty relaxed from my (strong) martini, and didn't even notice how long we had waited for our food to come out until Lynn stopped by to apologize for our wait, and let us know that dessert would be on the house (which was super nice, but I had been hoping for honey toast somewhere else...)   The asparagus was perfectly cooked, the twice baked potatoes were okay, last time we had creamed spinach and I would have preferred it over the potatoes. Our steaks were glorious. I should preface this by getting a little cocky, and saying that I can grill a perfect filet mignon...I like medium rare with a gorgeous crust, and I've got it down pat. For this reason, I usually don't order filet when I am out to dinner...but theirs is *almost* as good as mine. I buy my filet at Costco for $38 for 3 steaks vs $42 for 1, so I have to take that into count... :-p   For dessert we went with their chocolate creme brulee that tastes exactly like my granny's homemade pudding, and the chocolate cake, which is one of the best cakes I've ever had at a steakhouse.   We had a $60 groupon, and dessert was on the house, so our bill came out to around $72. Considering I had purchased the groupon with a local deal coupon for like $20, that wasn't bad.   Staff is friendly and you get the fun old-Vegas ambiance, with the free entertainment of drunken bachelor parties, and middle aged men on golf trips. If you live in Las Vegas you should experience it at least once. Check for Groupons before you go.",

After eating dinner at the SLS and finding that there were no happy hour specials on Fridays we wandered onto Las Vegas BLVD - I saw the Golden Steer in the distance and was drawn into the light.   We walked in and were greeted by a tux with a furled brow. After explaining we just wanted few a drinks and we'd be out the door, he obliged and walked us over to the bar. This place is a True Vegas landmark with pictures of Mobsters, The Rat Pack, and Hollywood celebs adorning the walls. You get a real sense of old Vegas, where everyone knew your name and your drink. This place is so old school with the red vinyl seats and the golden accents everywhere; it makes the show \"Mad Men\" look like a modern day TV marvel.   The bartenders Patty and Blake were awesome, very friendly and willing to chat with us about the place. We ordered vodka sodas and shots right off the bat and after our second round, I started eyeballing the happy hour menu... \"One order of escargot please\"... Yes. I'm a big fan of this land dwelling mollusk, and whenever I see it on a menu, I have to order it. The Golden Steer's versions of these are very good. Swimming in butter and garlic sauce and not too chewy either, the snails simply melted in your mouth. The only thing is, I wish they came in their shells. These snails were served pre-shelled for easy consumption, where's the fun in that?  This was my first time here, but definitely not my last. It's time to make reservations and party like it's 1959!",

And I will always feel like the Rat Pack should be dining with me.  This visit was no different.  The T-bone was cooked to perfection.  The whipped potatoes were a wonderful surprise.  The only difference on this visit was that I split a dessert.  The chocolate cake is every bit the equal of their steak.  It was a wonderful combination of moist cake and a milk chocolate mousse and a darker chocolate icing.  I'm normally an ice cream guy if I do dessert at all -- but that cake may well be the best dessert I've had in a long time.  The real star of the evening was our server, Scot.  Scot told us he'd only been at Golden Steer for a year, but you'd never know it.  Utterly impeccable service.  He knew the menu and virtually the entire wine list.  He knew the history of the restaurant and its place in Vegas lore.  He was friendly and chatty without being overly obtrusive.    I look forward to my next trip to Vegas where I will go out of my way to have Scot take care of my steak cravings again.",

I feel like I should pay double, no no no, triple what they ask just for the pleasure of having the Golden Steer aromatics permeate the fabric of my totally unworthy attire. I don't bathe myself or my best steakhouse ensemble for weeks after visiting; every evening I roll around naked on top of the pile of clothes I wore, praying to the yellow bovine god that that smell never leave me... but it always does.    The thing that makes the Golden Steer so special is not the locally sourced, grass fed cattle that happily give up there lives so that we may live, it's not the award winning wine list or expertly made cocktails. It's the table side salad tossing.   Oh lawdy, you haven't lived until you've have your salad tossed by the sweet princes and princesses of the Golden Steer. The rigorous training these masters of the salad tossing industry have endured in order to step foot on the floor of this legendary institution are second to none, and no one, you shut your mouth, I said no one tosses better salad than Carl.   King Carl, tosser of salads, sweet-mouthed wizard of sangria, will be your Caesar Sherpa, his strong hands and subtle wrists making sure every piece of green has the perfect amount of sauce. Born a poor child of little wit with his left leg 3 inches shorter than the other, Carl had a tough road ahead of him, with expectations high for this 5 generation salad tosser, but like his father and his father's father, his father's  father's father, and great great Grandfather Carl, for whom our hero is named, Carl would not be stopped. He is without a doubt the Las Vegas Salad Tossing King. Bow down.   You stop what you're doing right now, put down the cough syrup, and book a flight to Sin City. Go get that salad tossed by a living legend at the greatest steakhouse to ever exist. And don't forget to ask about their fine selection of artisanal sangria.   Thank you, Carl, you sweet prince.",

Service was attentive, drinks were good though overpriced, atmosphere was comfortable and warm. We started with shrimp cocktail and crab cake appetizers and they were quite good.   The Ceasar salad, prepared tableside, was top notch. Dinners included shrimp scampi, filets, chicken of the angels, and prime rib.   Everyone enjoyed their meals.   I had the scampi and thought the shrimp were slightly overdone, especially compared with those served with the shrimp cocktail.   That was the only small complaint amongst the 6 of us. We were visiting from out of town so we probably wouldn't be inclined to be here again soon...with so many tempting places in town we'd likely try something else. But I would suggest this to other folks looking for a quality experience in LV",

Our waiter Scot was very nice and helpful with the wine and dinner menu. We got the ribeye which took up the whole plate you gotta have an appetite to finish the whole thing. Then the lobster and filet mignon was to die for, I love my steak a little pink on the inside and they cooked it perfect. Lobster tail was huge I couldn't even finish it all. The twiced baked potatoe was filling it's enough for 4 people, the mushrooms were so good I wasn't a fan of the asparagus it didn't have too much flavor. We got a bottle of wine which topped off the whole meal I definitely would recommend trying this place it's pricey but we'll worth it.",

I would judge it as very good, not fabulous, but very good. The table side Ceasar Salad was really good but be sure and tell the server that you don't want anchovies. He didn't ask before he started so you have to be proactive. I like anchovies, my wife doesn't so he tossed some on my salad after he served my wife.  My wife had the petite filet and really liked it. I had the highly recommended 22 ounce bone in rib-eye. It was cooked perfectly so no complaints there. But, it was not quite as tender as I expected and it didn't have that rich flavor of a great rib-eye. It was better than a super market steak but not up to the prime beef of other top level steak houses. When you pay $56 just for the steak you should have something special not just good.  We had the creamed spinach and the sides are so large two people can split them and still take some home. The creamed spinach was very good but had a spice flavor I couldn't identify. I would order it again. We also had the twice baked potato. Again, two people can share this big thing. You could taste chives, bacon and the cheese on top. I assume there was sour cream in there but I'm not sure. It was a little dry but I would order it again.  The place is definitely iconic. We ate in the Dean Martin booth and the background music was predominantly Sinatra. Would I go again? Probably if out of town guests wanted to go there, but there are other steak places I would rate just a little notch higher. But, I would not discourage anyone from going here.",

    "text": "It pains me to write this review. I have been coming to the Golden Steer for over 20 years. The food and the service have always been top notch. Our experience this evening, however, has changed my perception and I have sworn to never return there again. I don't know what's happening with the management there, but I hope they soon correct what is going on.   First off, when we arrived at our reserved time, our table was nowhere near ready, and other guests at our table were still in the middle of their entree. No big deal, since I was here to enjoy my dinner with friends on my birthday, we shrugged it off and waited the extra half hour for the prior occupants to leave.  A few minutes after we were seated, an extremely large group of men arrived. There were at least 40 of them in the group. They came in shouting, whistling, laughing and talking at the top of their lungs.  They took up the entire section across from where we were seated and continued to be so loud and obnoxious that we couldn't even enjoy conversation within our group. The 3 other groups around us were obviously feeling the same, as all of shared looks of dissatisfaction.  It go so bad that I finally walked up to the front desk and complained. The lady who said she was the manager told me she would talk to the group and ask them to keep the noise down.  SHE Didn't.  We decided to finish our meals and get out of there as quickly as we could.  Throughout the time, the group acted as if they were in a locker room, shouting, laughing, whistling and being obnoxious.  At one point we told our waiter that the noise was so disruptive it was ruining our meal.  He simply shrugged his shoulders and said, \"what can I do?\"  Another member of our group went and spoke to the same manager. She was virtually worthless. I asked why they didn't plan this event better and put the loud group in a more appropriate area of the restaurant. She told us that this group came every year and always reserved the same section.  Her response told us everything we needed to know: they were willing to ruin everyone else's meal experience for the sake of a large, well-paying group of loudmouth jerks.  It was at this point a waiter came up with a birthday dessert for me, which had a Roman candle thjng on it.  I had to shout over the noise of the other group, just to tell him he could keep the dessert and just give us our bill.  The female manager came over and said she would take the cost of 3 drinks off our meal.  Seriously? A ruined night out that cost hundreds of dollars? 3 drinks??  I told her I had been coming to the GS for over 20 years and had never had such a negative experience before. She did not even reply. It was clear she couldn't care less about our measly little group and our measly little meal.  We paid for our dinner, without leaving a tip, and told her we would never be back.  Do they even care?",

    "text": "What happened?? That's what I keep asking myself regarding my most recent trip to GS on April 13th.  I'm a semi frequent visitor to Vegas from SoCal.  The last couple of times I've come up with my friend.  We like the Craps tables and after getting our fill of \"rolling the bones\", we head off to get our fill of our favorite Steak House.  On this occasion, we decided to bring our wives.  Mine had never been to GS and I was anxious for her to sample the outstanding food.  We had reservations and arrived slightly early.  Our table was still occupied and we were asked to head over to the bar to wait.  This wasn't a huge deal for me.  Things like this are beyond the restaurants control.  The previous party were, obviously, simply enjoying themselves.  After about 30 minutes, the hostess came to get us and we proceeded to our table (Dean Martin).  About this same time, a large group of approximately 20 to 30 gentlemen entered the restaurant. The first thing we noticed was the significant rise in the decibel levels.  The second thing we noticed was that they were being seated in our same section of the restaurant no more than 20 feet from our table.    Next thing we know, there are people standing up giving loud speeches with loud whistling and cheering in response.  Because of the confined area, the sound levels became unbearable.  We were starting to have to shout to each other in order for us to hear what the person sitting only 2 feet away from us was saying.  Needless to say, we brought this to managements attention.  Not once, but twice.  What came as the biggest surprise was their reaction... or should I say their lack thereof. Let's put that on a back-burner and talk about the food.    Let me make this clear, the food at GS has always been AMAZING!!  That has not changed.  The petite filet and lobster I had that night was cooked to perfection.  The Caesar Salad mixed at our table is so beyond any other restaurant salad I've had... and I've had a lot of restaurant salads.  The desserts are no less labored over and easily measure up in their own rite.  Now let's pull that pot from the back burner.  Part of my dining experience is my desire to share in that experience with the people I come with.  To fellowship and engage in conversations that saunter on through the evening, winding their way to their ultimate conclusion and, inevitably, a night of great food and great memories.  On this evening, that was not to be the case.  On this night, Golden Steer management made it quite clear to us and the other diners around us that our comfort and enjoyment was not nearly as important as the larger group of individuals who were racking up a hell of lot bigger check than the $400 we ended up paying.  In fairness, the manager did offer to credit us a round of drinks to our check but the damage had already been done.  So, we left... terribly dismayed and upset... enough to write this unfortunate review.",

They have cool table side features such as Caesar salad made fresh at the table.  Another table had banana fosters made at table side too.  We, on the other hand, were too full to eat dessert. The steak wasn't melt in your mouth like butter. They did give you tons of veggies with it.  The sauces were good -- bernaisse and hollendaise.  The steak was a bit bland but wasn't the worst I've ever had.  I'd say the bake potato won the show in my book.  Too bad it was a $250 potato.    The service was fantastic,  which is the only reason I'm giving fore stars.    Not sure I will give it another try at their price point.",

If I could manifest a dang near perfect steakhouse from all my dreams and memories the Steer would not be far off. Once you step inside you forget you're in Vegas (this is a good thing). The surfaces are covered in rich mahogany tones and the walls are plastered with photos of crooners and movie starlets of yesteryear.  I had the 22oz ribeye ($58) cooked to a perfect medium rare and seasoned well. The wedge salad ($12) with lots of bacon and creamy blue cheese dressing did not disappoint. For sides we (three in our party) all shared creamed spinach, mushrooms and a twice baked potato ($11) each. I washed it all down with a glass of French Malbec ($17). Finally, for desert we shared the carrot cake and strawberry cheesecake ($7) a piece. Service was fantastic and the bill was very reasonable at $275 for our party before tip. This place has clearly been rocking the steakhouse vibes in sin city since 1958. I don't plan on heading back to Vegas for quite awhile but if I do, I'll be sure to bring folks to this magnificent vestige of Americana. The only drawback is once you leave you walk outside to see the blight of the Las Vegas strip and remember where you are...",

The decor is old school Vegas with beautiful wood paneling, brass fixtures, and red leather booths.   I've had the had the Caesar Salad made table side and the French Onion Soup as starters. The soup has a complex and fresh taste and the ceasar is flavorful, and tart.  The main entrees have been outstanding with fantastic flavor. The ribeye and t-bone are aged, sumptuous, rich, and perfectly cooked.  I've never had a better tasting t-bone. This visit we had the Chicken Angelo and the prime rib diamond Jim cut.  Both dishes were consummately executed.  The Chicken Angelo was a creamy and tangy delicious combination. The prime rib was tender, rich, and flavorful. The meat is of high quality and expertly slow roasted with an expertise that will soon be a thing of the past. Check it out before it goes the way of all cool great things.",

I've lived in Vegas for years.. best meal my husband and I have ever had in our lives.. no joke.  Service is very good and professional.  Worth it to spend $30 on the groupon to save $60 because it is EXPENSIVE.  I had the filet (I think it was 12oz?) and jumbo lobster tail.  It was $130 bucks.  Sides are $11 each.  Mac n cheese and creamed spinach were amazing.  Sides are quite large.  My husband got the ribeye.  Big, gorgeous, and both steaks cooked the most perfect med rare.  Lobster melted in my mouth.  All together meal was $215, groupon took off $60, but of course we tip on the original bill since waiters have to tip out on that, not discounted meals.  It was just amazing, but who can spend $200 on food? So once in a while, it's the perfect choice.",

The history behind the joint is impressive as well, to say the least.   Myself and two other coworkers ordered two appetizers - Meatballs and Mushrooms. They were both delicious, and the mushrooms were so good that I ordered them as a side with my entree as well. I had a Porter House (Medium Rare) because I was craving a huge piece of red meat. My table ordered two sides as well - mushrooms and cream corn.   The coolest part, was the Caesar salad. The waiter brought out an entire cart with and empty bowl, and made the salad in front of us, all while carrying on a very fun conversation with our table. It was intriguing, delicious, and I've wanted to make my own salad ever since!  The entire bill was around $550 with everything, including a bottle of wine. All together, I will come back here EVERY time I visit Las Vegas - hands down.",

    "text": "I went to Golden Steer in March 2019. Its located on the north end of the strip, not the best of neighborhoods, in a strip mall area which seemed a little strange.  When you walk in you definitely get a old school speakeasy steakhouse feel. If you are looking for something that screams old school rat pack vegas this is the place. I ordered the Cesar salad, Prime Rib English Cut 10 oz. and sauteed mushrooms. Everything's al a carte . They say the are famous for their table side prepared Cesar salad but I didn't think it was that special, it was good but not $12 good. The steak was delicious and I believe it was $47. The sauteed mushrooms were not to my liking, they didn't feel sauteed they were hard and just bathed in some sort of gravy. I would avoid the mushrooms. My friends got the baked potato and mac & cheese. The potato was huge and looked great. I did get to try the mac & cheese and it was great. They do not split the bill so if you go in a group it will be all on one check. You and your friends will have to settle up with each other. Overall I wasn't wowed or impressed especially for the price $75-$100 per person.

The bread was pretty good.  The place is a little outdated, but that is what preserves its history and elegance.  The servers were friendly, courteous and respectful.  I met my cousin and her husband for dinner.  They did the bill at our table with a handheld device which was pretty cool.  All this technology and they said that they couldn't split the checks.  WTF?  Seriously, WTF?  Every restaurant in Vegas splits checks except Golden Steer.  I'm glad I went, but I would never go back.

    "text": "I just received the worst service experience in my years of eating at high end steak houses. The food was good overall but I don't need to be disrespected and insulted on top of mediocre service when I'm dropping a grand in your establishment.  We had a group of 8 get together for a post Viva Las Vegas dinner. Please note that while this is a rockabilly convention we all dressed up to the nines for a \"classy\" dinner experience at the Golden Steer. When we arrived we asked to have separate checks because as with many high end steakhouses, the items are served ala carte. Thus, it makes figuring the bill at the end a nightmare with this many people. The excuse was the computer system can't handle it..and apparently writing it down on paper is too hard as well for the 200 dollar tip. Our group was not loud nor over demanding yet had a lot of trouble getting service in general as others have mentioned in reviews recently.   As expected, the chaos begins when it comes check time. We get handed one copy of the check and are basically told \"you need to figure it out\". After lots of asking we finally got multiple copies to try and make sense of the confusing bill. This whole process takes us 40 minutes of struggling with the staff to clarify the bill as if it just too much trouble for them despite the place being less than half full. We ended up missing a show in Vegas we wanted to attend dealing with this fiasco.  As we start paying, the real fun begins. We are told by one of the servers in a very condescending and rude tone \"well, maybe they do that at Denny's but we dont do it here\" in regards to the poor service with the check. It seemed to be a personal shot based on being from the convention. Also, when asked why we are not being taken care of as is a servers job.. He replies \"is it my job?\" as if he would be doing as little as possible for the 20 percent tip. The older waiter over hearing the conversation was clearly embarrassed by his colleagues remarks.  Sorry but there are too many other great steak houses in Vegas to deal with lazy and insulting staff. Perhaps he should not have been so judgmental. I work for a Fortune 100 company and like to take clients to dinner. I make a good living and I am highly educated, I dont eat at Denny's thanks.  I don't need this garbage. Guess who isn't taking any clients here anymore?  P.S. Denny's probably has a spot on their overnight staff for your rude server. He obviously can't handle this gig.",

I went on a couple of friends' advice that it was the best steakhouse in Vegas.  It is not.  A friend of mine and I ate in there not terribly long ago.  I had a filet, a salad, and a glass of wine.  He had a ribeye, a salad, and a beer, and we split a baked potato.  And it was about $225.  It might be old school Vegas, but they charge some really new school prices.  The servers were curt and not very friendly.  We had to ask for water refills.  That should never happen in any restaurant, let alone one you're paying a house note to eat at.  They weren't busy, so there was really no excuse.   I've had much better steaks at Gordon Ramsay, Carnevino, Hugo's Cellar, Capital Grille, Vic & Anthony's, and others.  So, unless someone else is buying, I will not be going back here.  It was not worth the hefty, hefty price tag.  And despite their lack of business, the parking is terrible.",

    "text": "Visited this place for the first time earlier this week, let me start by saying that it was phenomenal. The ambiance really makes you feel as if you are sitting across from an old time vegas mobster having a steak dinner.  Impeccable service from the moment we walked in to moment we left. I was impressed by one of what I would call a bus boy, he was quite young but his service was on par with someone who has been in that type of service industry for many years. I am sure you have heard enough about that, I know you all want to hear about the food.  Most everything is served Al la carte, I love this aspect because I can choose what I want with my meal. I started with the French onion soup.  It was so tasty I dreamt about it that night,  the cheeses stretches and stretches, I think they should supply scissors to cut it. I choose to have the baked Alaskan salmon with sauteed mushrooms. The salmon comes with a small serving of rice pilaf. The gravy the mushrooms comes served in is delctable. The salmon has a nice crust to it. They also have a wide variety of desserts, bananas foster and cherries jubilee are made and served table side. Even the coffee we finished the meal off with was delicious, strong and robust.  I will definitely be going back. This is an amazing place for a special date or to just feel the old nostalgic Vegas.",

The Steer, along with Hugo's Cellar downtown, are the last of a dying breed - classic Vegas restaurants with red tuck-and-roll upholstery booths and a vintage spirit. I wish I lived closer - their lounge would be my new home.  I ordered the scallops marsala which, I hate to say, was a bit strange and totally missed the mark - but the creamed corn and steamed broccoli sides were really well done. We told them it was our anniversary when we booked our reservation, so at the end of the meal they threw in a cheesecake dessert with a flame-thrower of a sparkler on top! Festive!  The waitress was chatty and filled with cheesy Vegas tales, the old goombahs in the booth across from us kept ordering the waiter around like ex-mobster royalty and talking about how so-and-so's neighbor was a prostitute. Lots of local character and vintage Vegas wackiness.  Like I said....you don't go here for the food!",

If you are hoping for anything beyond that, such as fresh mixed green salads, mind blowing sides, delicious seafood, or even a speck of modernity, I say skip it and head to one of the bajillion steak joints on the Strip. The Steer is Vegas, BABY, not the Vegas where what happens here stays here only in theory.  We went on a Saturday night, and it was dead. I was a bit concerned, but I was still grinning at the truly old school surrounds, complete with red banquettes and a live piano player. Service was relaxed; it could have been a bit more attentive in explaining the menu and getting our order in a prompt manner. (Casual is okay by the way as there were some old school locals there in their everyday getups.)    Our order included the chopped salad, the \"Ambassador of Tenderness\" (12 oz Filet) and onion rings. The salad is drenched in dressing and tossed table side, so you may want to request light dressing. It is basically an iceberg salad with some chickpeas and carrot sticks, nothing spectacular. The onion rings were breaded thickly, again okay, but I am still beholden to my Atlanta Varsity rings.  The steak, however, was perfect and lived up to its Ambassador title. Enough said.  They appear to have private rooms, so round up your Rat Pack and prepare for a protein feast.",

On a three night (aka three dinner) trip to Vegas, we went here twice after having such an amazing experience the first night.  As people have mentioned, the outside is not remarkable (strip mall-ish), but the inside is something out of the early 1960's.  The food is all fantastic - in our two visits we had escargot, Caesar salad (table-side...fantastic!), oysters Rockefeller (AMAZING), chicken parm, eggplant parm, petit filet mignon, baked potato, blackened salmon, cherries jubilee and bananas foster.  All were great.  But it is the service and care that make this place worth the price (items are a la carte and while cheaper than steak places on the Strip, still higher end).  Our server (both nights - we made sure!) was Scot who is remarkable, personable, kind, attentive and an absolute pro.  Any time we are in Las Vegas we will be back.",

    "text": "Old School Vegas Steakhouse.  AMBIENCE:  3 stars.  The bar needs to be fixed up--it is the first place you see when you walk in and it looks aged (and not in the good way),  Once you get into the steak house proper, then it is classic Rat Pack vinyl booths, with memoribilia and photos from famous people who used to frequent the steak house.  We sat at the Mario Andretti booth!  SERVICE:  4.5 stars.  We were met by a super nice hostess and seated immediately (we did have a reservation--which I highly recommend).  The server and his support staff were very good and attentive--and certainly knew the menu in and out.    DRINKS:  3 stars.  A steak house should have perfect cocktails--ie martinis, cosmos, etc--ours were served promptly but the Golden Steer seems to use fairly pedestrian liquor in their well.  FOOD:  4.5 stars.  We started with the best Caesar Salad we had ever had--made table side by a very skilled server.  We had the Ribeye, which was good sized, cooked perfectly, and very flavorful.  We also had the Lobster Tail--which was prepared perfectly as well.  Our sides were the Twice-Baked potatoes--which were amazing and I highly recommend them--and the Creamed Spinach--which was quite good as well.  The desert was the best part--Bananas Foster made table side--the bananas were lightly coated with the carmelized alcohol, and they were amazing!  Unfortunately the ice cream it was served atop of had ice crystals which kind of took away from the overall effect.  VALUE:  This place is not inexpensive--but it is nowhere near where some of the super fancy places on or just off of the strip.    OVERALL:  4 stars.  I think the service and food are quite good--but the bar is an issue that should be fixed.",

That's not necessarily good or bad, just a little more unique these days. They will tell you they let the food stand for itself. While, the're not serving the best cuts in town, they do serve a high quality product. For me it is all about the atmosphere. The Golden Steer isn't the place I'm typically interested in settling down in to enjoy my dinner, but I can still appreciate the charm and appeal to others...It's Vegas Baby!...Old School Vegas...better days, when the Mob still ran The Strip and you were taken care of so long as you played by the rules.   You are taken care of at Golden Steer as if you were an old mob boss. The staff is attentive and dressed to impress. The food is executed well. The bar tenders are lively and good for a story or joke if you're in off peak hours.

From the outside, it doesn't look like much, but the inside is nice enough. I called to see if a reservation was needed and the woman that answered the phone was a little punchy. She gave me the info but made me work for it.   When we arrived we noticed a lot of the other customers were very casual. It was warm out so my companion was happy to leave his coat and tie in the car.   I ordered the filet and crab legs. I think it came with a salad, or it was extra I'm not sure.... Either was the salad was over priced. Just a boring mix if basic lettuce and dressing. I will skip the salad next time.  The filet was cooked perfectly and very tender. Crab legs were opened and very easy to eat. A lot of meat per leg. Steak fries were pretty good as were the asparagus. All and all a pretty nice meal, although slightly overpriced.",

Not only did he treat my family with the upmost courtesy, professionalism, he had great descriptions that made your mouth water  while telling us about the specials. He knew the main menu inside and out. Service was flawless. He made several suggestions for specials and both of them were to die for. We have the bananas Foster which they do at the table and not only do they make it in front of you they tell you exactly how they're making it.  This is an iconic restaurant and if you truly want to taste the food, hospitality, and service of old Las Vegas  this is the place to go.",

This is off the strip here in Las Vegas and not many tourists go here. But the locals sure do. It's never real busy during the week but you do need to make reservations.   When you walk in here you feel like you just stepped in to the 1960's-1970's. It's really cool. And the respect to the dinning experience is what it is all about here. Unlike the rest of Las Vegas they care about service. A lot of the wait staff have been here for a long time and are just not working here until they finish school or make it in acting or something. They care about your experience.   Oh....and the food is off the charts. The steaks are amazing. The seafood tower is terrific. The Caesar salad is old school in the fact that they do it the RIGHT way. At the table with all the ingredients that are suppose to be in a Caesar salad. Like a raw egg and anchovies.   If you come to Vegas. Come here!",

We already loved the decor/furniture and the history all around us, then we were blown away by our servers in tuxes! They were all very professional and suave with all the humor you want! So fun!! Then ... our main server of the night ... Venko. Oh man, he took the cake and made the night one to remember. Venko, thank you for taking such time to cook for us table-side and share such incredible memories with us. Memories of the greats you had known so well over the years especially the greats who had sat in our very same booth! We can't wait to come back and see you! Oh, I should probably tell you they are the BEST at what they are best at ... the steaks were cooked to perfection and everything we ordered was so delicious. Seriously we were sad to finish eating, it was such a treat!",

We asked a few questions about the menu since it was our first time here. His responses were pretty rude. We ordered drinks and at that point I felt that we had made a mistake by coming here.  Thankfully we ordered the Caesar salad which is prepared table side. Venko prepared the best Caesar salad I have ever had! I have never seen someone prepare a salad so gracefully! His service was exceptional and definitely over compensated for the original servers poor customer service! I was originally disappointed but Venko definitely turned this experience around for us! Overall the food was great with the exception of asparagus which was a bit bland. Would definitely come back!",

My husband wanted something a little more intimate (it is our 22nd Anniversary)and spoke to the manager to see if they could move us to another booth, one that would be more private , we were willing  to wait; Instead of  the manager being accommodating he was a pompous and told my husband it wasn't  a large party we were seated next too and asked my husband if he would like to point out a booth he would prefer.  His  mannerism took my husband back and we decided to leave. We have enjoyed many nice dinners as locals in Vegas and we're highly disappointed.  We will never go back to this restaurant.

The table had the following items and then some.  The table side Caesar salad was probably the BEST Caesar salad we had all week in any restaurant in. Eggs! Old line food and service with a smile.  The service was a little slow but once they got going it was fine.  The table enjoyed some of the following items.  I of coarse had the worst meal as I subbed chicken for the veal in the marsala sauce and the chicken was rubbery and the sauce was quite salty.  The boys all enjoyed their steaks and the table had a few like a bone in rib eye, a filet and a couple others that slip my mind.  But all in all this is a great place in Vegas with wonderful history and always a fun night is had here! Drinks are also a decent size and not too watered down like some places!  We always try to have a meal here when we are in town.",

It was the sweetest, most flavorful and perfectly cooked tail I have ever had. And I have had lobster everywhere from Japan to France. I believe it was New Zealand lobster which is miles better than any Maine lobster I've ever had. It was pricey, as lobster usually is, but it was HUGE!   Highly recommend!

The parking here is small and the restaurant sign, although large is very plain and worn down. Shopping area around here is rundown but everything changes once you're inside. Decor is a very old school, dim lightening, wooden tables and chairs. The service is very attentive and pleasant. I ordered the calamari, snails, cream corn, double baked potato, and the ribeye. Food came out fast. Calamari was dry and I don't recommend ordering. The snails were also okay but honestly not worth the price. Cream corn and potato was interesting but fun to eat. Ribeye was delicious, very tender and juicy. Overall, experience here was good but I don't see myself coming back here anytime soon. Good place to celebrate a birthday (most people here are older, like 45+) or an anniversary.",

The lobster tail was succulent and sweet (5 stars as well); however, a bit overpriced at $75 for an 8 oz. tail (just because of the price 3 stars). The table side ceasar salad was good but, slightly oily. I'm not to sure how to describe the crab cakes. They were not fishy but, the texture was kind of doughy. It seemed like they were under cooked but, it was really hard to tell because the lighting in the restaurant was really dim. Overall, I recommend you order as their name implies... beef. Let's not forget dessert, the cheesecake was silky and creamy with a fantastic drizzle of strawberry puree.  The service was above my expectations. Our water glasses were always full and there were at least two waiters that were checking on us. Venko was our table side waiter and he was fantastic!",

Incredible old school ambiance, maitre d's, bow ties, red booths, table side preparation, and Elvis music playing in the background!! Golden Steer is one of my favorite go to places every time we are in Vegas, you may even have a star sighting! Steaks, salmon and shrimp cocktail were all a big hit tonight!",

However, I really do feel that we were discriminated against because we are Hispanic and I am choosing to not eat red meat (the other 5 family members do). From the moment we placed our 1st order the service has been sketchy to down right crappy.  Except for one of them.   Food good...service borders on very very poor.  It's rare that I feel this but other people in my party felt this way too including my mother.   I frequent Vegas and WILL never come back here.",

Meatballs and calamari for apps, both very good. Caesar Salad, great and made table side. Beef....the prime rib was great and oscar filet was outstanding. Both cooked perfectly. I have to mention the horseradish cream sauce (prime rib) and hollandaise sauce (filet) were both really good as well.  Veal Parmesan, surprisingly very good for a steakhouse. Creamed spinach was family style and so good. Even the hot rolls and butter were tasty. No room for dessert sadly, we really wanted to try the banana foster:/ I read reviews about the service not being great which I can agree with in the bar, but once we sat at our table the service was on par. Will go back for sure.",

It took 15-20 to get water (after we FLAGGED down someone) and the restaurant wasn't even halfway full. It was like we were invisible!   The food was okay. The petit filet mignon and the NY Strip was pretty bland, lacking flavor. They also didn't cook my bf's NY Strip as he requested (medium), and instead gave him a medium rare piece--red but not bloody. He's too polite to say anything so he ate it anyways. The oyster rockafeller, 2x baked potato & creamed spinach was delicious though. The \"special garlic bread\" was soooo lame though! 3 pieces for $5! It was basically texas toast! After reading reviews from others, I wanted to also mention that they also double charged us for the \"special garlic bread\" with 2 orders when we only ordered 1 and it was over-priced to begin with and dry.  To top off the night, the waiter had the audacity to ask me if we were using a GROUPON when giving us our check (keep in mind I had to ask for it because of the crappy service)! WTF!?! HAHA I'm not sure if that was a standard inquiry, but I thought it was an interesting question upon payment. I didn't find it appropriate, especially for a mediocre meal with embarrassing service. As Stephanie Tanner from Full House would say, \"How Rude!\".",

As we were trying to add to our order he thought we were finished and walked off. Several minutes later our iced tea arrived and the attitude was cold and icy. We had to beg to ask for service and it was clear larger tables with higher tabs were more important.  We l were dismissed as a low ticket table and treated as such. The tables were full and they will not miss us. Go there if you can show you will be spending a large ticket and I'm sure it will be fine. If not, the strip has plenty of options.  We travel the world and I have never been so dismissed as we were tonite.  By the way, the food was average at best.",

We went on a very slow night, and had the pleasure of being seated at Oscar Goodman's booth (soon to be Carolyn's booth, our waiter informed us), while the only other diners in the restaurant included an Elvis impersonator at the booth behind us. Frank Sinatra music played in the background. Bring in the showgirls. So Vegas.  Credit goes to our server for making the experience so memorable. He's been there for 33 years and shared a little of the restaurant's history with us. It's refreshing to see a truly professional front waiter, and I get a kick out of seeing my food served off a gueridon, as it reminds me of the horrors of a dining room service class I had to complete in culinary school.  Oh, right, and the food. My husband enjoyed his prime rib and twice baked potato. There's no room for a whiny vegetarian in a steakhouse, and I was perfectly content with my chopped green salad with garbanzo beans and housemade creamy Roquefort dressing and a large portion of fresh green asparagus with Hollandaise sauce. The garlic bread with cheese was also very tasty.   This is the kind of place I would love to take a visitor from out of town. I'm dying to go back and try a dessert prepared tableside (another culinary school memory), so hopefully some touristy people come soon!",

I got a petite filet and my husband ordered a filet.  Both were cooked to perfection.  Leave it to a steak house to get it right.  I also had the twice baked potato which was delicious as well. My husband had the asparagus and they were cooked enough but still had a little crunch to them and were very good.  To end the night, I had been hearing good things about the bananas foster that they make table side.  People come here for the bananas foster and cherries jubilee.  Because this is an older Las Vegas establishment, they are grandfathered in and one of the only places that are allowed to have an open flame to make their signature desserts.  I must say that my first bananas foster experience did NOT disappoint.  The one caveat is that they could not split up our check, however they do take multiple forms of payment.

I ordered French Onion Soup, a twice baked potato, creamed spinach and a the smallest cut of prime rib on the menu (18oz)  The food was sub par to say the least but at least the portions were huge.  Soup came out warm not hot and the cheese was not melted properly. The soup itself was tasty but again served at the wrong temperature.  Like many of the other reviewers mentioned the meat was not delivered at the correct temperature.  I ordered medium rare I got somewhere between medium and medium well.  The Prime rib was tender and served with a soup bowl full of horseradish which was necessary because the meat had no flavor of its own.  Normally creamed spinach is my favorite part of eating at a steakhouse.  It was inedible here. IN-E-DI-BLE!!! disgusting just plain horrible, the worst I've ever had, worse than I can even describe, sour, bitter and oily.  Also it was terrible.  The twice baked potato was... nothing to write about, turly uneventful, really neither good nor bad.  At least my Bourbon tasted Okay you can't really mess up pouring Bourbon in a glass from a bottle, Oh an the staff was pleasant, I never felt rushed or ignored.  Their friendliness should be commended.",

    "text": "Visited for my dad's birthday recently. I really enjoyed the Golden Steer. This is really a trow back to a couple generations earlier. It does not look like much from the outside but inside you will find a dimly lit classic steakhouse/lounge. Service was solid throughout our meal including a free birthday dessert. They have several table side preparations to add some old school flare including a Cesar salad and I believe bananas foster. I myself opted for the New Your strip steak which was cooked beautifully and had a great chard flavor and was seasoned well. A great steak for sure. I also had the twice baked potato which was very good. Had a lot of bacon and cheese and the texture of the potato was perfect.",

I've been to way better steakhouses in vegas for the quality and price point. I will say the Cesar Salad was as delicious as we expected and was so fun to watch the salad spinner make it in front of us.  My husband and I shared the Rib Eye (it was huge) and well prepared but we both felt it was under seasoned. The steaks come al a carte and the sides are definitely big enough to share. We had the twice baked potato as well as the creamed spinach. I thought both were ok and husband thought the twice baked was incredible. I'll tell you what was incredible -- the chocolate cake. My husband and I were fighting over it. I would of given three stars but Carl made the experience incredible- so attentive and friendly. He made the experience unforgettable- I give him 5 stars and the food 3 and a half. He suggested and awesome bottle of wine (Justin cab) that went perfectly with our meal. I'm glad we went it was on our vegas steak house bucket list. I like to say been there done that won't return.... but I'd return for the salad chocolate cake wine and conversation... if we could request Carl as our server !",

What was not was the seasoning, or lack there of. Prime rib is suppose to have a nice seasoned crust. There also seamed to be a lack of flavor overall. I also had the asparagus, average. As for the restaurant ambiance- the music selection was abysmal.   Rat Pack's 5 greatest hits on a loop. Decor dated, I realize they are going for the Rat Pack look, but my god!!

    "text": "I have a soft spot for this place... it's one of the last places, if not the last place, I ate out with my father. Walking in, I was waxing nostalgic and a little sad... and really - maybe too much so - looking forward to one of the most amazing meals on the planet.  Ooops.   To be fair, nothing was *wrong* but it just wasn't the 4-5 star amazing steakhouse that, I have no doubt, it once was.   The \"meh\" experiences:  The lobster bisque had a good flavor but it could have been a little bit deeper. It was also a bit too thick and began to form a skin pretty quickly. I expected much, much more.  The Caesar was a disappointment. (1) It was made in stages; the preparer actually walked away in the middle to do something else, then came back to finish. (2) It was made too soon... so it sat while I finished my soup. I felt rushed because of this and passed my soup on to one of my friends who wanted to try it, just to make room for the hovering staff to deliver the now wilted, warmish salad.  The great experiences:  My escargot were perfect. Tender, a lot of flavor, and with a generous portion of garlic butter without drowning in it. Simply prepared and presented, the meat was the shining star here; spot on.  My companions had the shrimp scampi with fettucini and a petite filet with a side of creamed spinach. The shrimp were large, tender, and done very well. The steak was cooked perfectly to order with just the right char on the outside. Very juicy, fantastic texture, and delicious. I didn't have the spinach (only because I was full off the escargot and tastes of the rest) but it was well received and, in fact, devoured promptly.  The wine service was done well and the bottle of Paso Robles cab sauv I chose was (of course! ;)) the perfect accompaniment to the meal. We were also gifted a Sebastiani as a second bottle. It was good, but nothing spectacular. The thought is what counts, yes, but - and I hate to look a gift horse in the mouth here - you are a steakhouse and touting your wines... serve us something you would tout and celebrate.  The creme brulee we shared was tasty. Nothing more, nothing less.  So far, a solid 3-star experience. A-OK, and \"good.\"  But then...  The AMAZING experiences:  The overall service (minus the salad fiasco) was personal and friendly and engaging. Camacho and Jay and the gang want to be a part of your experience and take care of you old-school style. They are ingrained in the history of the place and are, by far, the main reason to dine here. They will, in between filling your glasses and placing your plates, fill you in on history (the good, the bad, the baudy) and are always quick with a smile, a handshake for the guys, and a wink for the gals. They truly enjoy what they do and it shows.  If you want energetic, you have it. If you want quiet and intimate, you can have that, too. Let them know what to create, and you will find the atmosphere you want. *THIS* is the reason it's a 4-star review/place (as many say, I would do 3.5 if I could). Let the staff take care of you. Be not afraid to make requests, have opinions, and let yourself enjoy the evening.  PS - Camacho's special coffees (not for the under-21 crowd) are yumminess in a cup. ;)",

It's always good to go back in time and enjoy what Vegas was once all about.  Food was delicious. (Of course it was...wouldn't expect anything less from a fine establishment like this.) One really cool thing they do here is that they make certain foods in front of you. We ordered a Cesar Salad and it was a fun experience to watch them prepare it for us. Ordered steak and shrimp scampi as our entrees, we were blissfully satisfied.  Also...they lit desserts on fire??!! Seriously. It looks cool to watch but we were so full from our dinner...I couldn't stomach anymore food. Maybe I'll just come here for dessert another time?  Definitely check this place out!",

For our dinner, we spent over $600.00.  I ordered the large cut of prime rib.  The cut of meat was so full of gristle that I had trouble cutting it with restaurant's steak knife.  Because the meat was so difficult to chew, I could only eat a few bites.  I gave a bite to the person sitting next to me to confirm what I experienced.  So as not to disturb the celebratory atmosphere at our table, I discreetly asked to speak to the manager.  I was directed to a man who identified himself only as \"John.\"  I told John that his restaurant served me the worst cut of prime rib I had ever experienced.  John was not at concerned about the quality of the meat.  He did not even want to see the cut of meat.  He appeared to be concerned only that he might have to give me my money back (for which I never asked).   John said there was nothing he could do.  I would have to telephone and speak to the real manager on Friday.  I think we can find another place to eat on our next visit to Vegas.",

The service and the food were mediocre at best. Our server was short with us and acted like he didn't really want to be bothered with doing his job.   There were six of us in the party and we all ordered the table side Caesar salad, it was drenched in dressing and the dressing wasn't even tasty. I ordered the filet mignon medium and it was served medium well. The sides were nothing special, we had asparagus, mushrooms, whipped potatoes and creamed spinach. The others in the party seemed okay with their entree selections but nothing stood out. We had bananas foster for dessert which was the best part of an otherwise disappointing meal.    With all of the choices in Las Vegas, this is definitely not up to par with the best steakhouses. We will not be back.",

    "text": "Like someone else pointed out..... the prime rib was tasteless: it had not been properly seasoned prior to cooking and needed a lot of salt and pepper to give it taste. Even the Au Jus lacked flavor. I am 54 years old and consider myself a prime rib expert, eating it at least 10 times per year and often cooking it myself. The quality of the meat was acceptable with good marbling in the field worthy of a somewhat USDA Prime grade but the chef FAILED to season the meat which rendered a tasteless steak. No flavor!!!!! No fresh ground pepper or salt or rosemary for flavor!!!! WTF!!!!!! for $60???... WTF!!!! The lobster was nice sized and just ok in flavor... once again lacked seasoning!!!!. The asparagus was cooked perfectly but lacked seasoning. The twice baked potato was kind of lame. The table salad served by some guy was PERFECT!!! Our waiter suggested an\" Old Fashioned\" for a dinner drink...... the guy was a genius!, wow.... better than wine with dinner..... really great bite and flavor!!! The service was very good/excellent and the decor and ambiance is the best that I've been to in Vegas... so peaceful and relaxing. BOTTOM LINE: for a $300 dinner I'd rather drive the extra distance or take a UBER or LYFT to Tuscany Grill in Henderson... still the best prime rib I have ever had, not as romantic or classy but prime rib so tasty and seasoned I still remember it the first time I had it 5 years ago. I most likely wont be back........",

I guess I will stick with 3 stars, because truthfully I won't go back.   This restaurant is pretty upscale and the food is pricey.  I live next door, so I have wanted to try it for a while.  Then I saw a groupon for $30 off, so I took it.  I took my Grandpa who is 94 and loves a good prime rib, and one of my friends, because well, I like her.   We went pretty early because my Grandpa eats dinner at like 4 in the afternoon, so I have to usually feed him NLT 5:30. Anyway, we got there about 5:15 and it was empty except for one other couple. The decor is very nice with big red leather booths and a romantic atmosphere.  The great thing about the booths is that the tables slide out, so any size can fit!!!  Our waiter took our orders, but seemed very quiet and distant. We asked for tea with cream...no cream came. Then we asked to order wine and he started taking our food order before my friend even ordered her drink. Then there was a small spider in my wine. The waiter offered another glass, but I had drank most of this one and all the spiders siblings, so I declined.  He took it off the bill, but still had a distant demeanor. I almost felt like he didn't want us there. I kept telling my friend, you really expect so much better service from an upscale restaurant.   I ordered the massive 22oz rib eye, because that is my fav cut and the only one in the menu.  It was huge, cooked well and flavorful. I knew this would require a Togo box. Then my friend and I decided to share a twice baked potato. This was yummy. It was crispy in the outside and creamy in the middle with bacon yumminess.  I also ordered the sauteed mushrooms. Warning, these are not typical sauteed mushrooms. These were whole and came with a sauce over them instead of the expected slices in butter.  The weren't gross, but I didn't finish them or take then home with my steak.   Ok, so when we were getting the check, I heard a very bubbly friendly waiter giving the \"specials\" to his table. Dang, why didn't we get this waiter or were told the specials?!?  I decided to mention it to the manager, because the service was just so disappointing. She told us the waiter had been there for 40 years and was loosing his eyesight and confidence. Now I felt like a jerk. I feel bad for the guy, but I'm torn, because when you order a $52 rib eye, you expect a certain amount of top service to go with it....hmmmm.  What do you think?",

Bone in ribeye average at best, no comparison to Delmonico's where we dined the evening before, their \"famous garlic bread\" tasted like a margarine and cheap cheese on bunt bread, they add Tabasco to their table side Caesar salad which destroys the True flavor, (or masks the quality of the ingredients). We've been disappointed with food and service in the past but, this place was the worst! When I made the reservation on OpenTable I clearly stated we were celebrating my Lady's birthday, when I checked in with The hostess, who was rude, I reminded we were celebrating a birthday and again during dinner I reminded her and our waiter. After our mediocre meal they brought the check without mention of her birthday. I stated my displeasure whereupon they offered a slice of cake to go, I declined and stated my displeasure was being reflected in my gratitude. There are truly great steak houses in Vegas, Delmonico's and Cut in particular serve far superior food and know how to treat their customers. My advice, stay away from Golden Steer Steakhouse.",

Hands down the best steak you'll have and a staff that's been around for a while so knows what the meaning of service is.  This is upscale but not pretentious and great for any occasion. You can show up in diamond or denim and not feel out of place.  The bar is fantastic, so if there's a wait, grab a martini, and enjoy all the nostalgia from the days when Las Vegas was entertainment capital, when truly anything went, and when Deano, Sammy, and Ole Blue Eyes ruled the town.",

    "text": "The Golden Steer is not only the oldest steak house in Las Vegas, but it's also one of the tastiest.    The ambiance is classy and the staff are dressed to the \"T\".  We of course got the table side Cesar salad, as recommended by many fellow yelpers and also the fried calamari, which for a place in the middle of the desert was delicious!  For an entree, I got the bone in rib-eye, which was honestly one of the juiciest and delicious steaks to which I've ever indulged myself.  This accompanied with a twice baked potato was the perfect classic meat and potatoes meal.  My only regret was not being able to finish everything and get dessert.  Next time!  If you are looking for a great spot for a classic meal or an anniversary or birthday dinner and happen to be in Vegas.  Give this spot a shot, you won't regret it!",

    "text": "Definitely an old school steak house and I say that in a good way!  I haven't been here since the 80s when we came here as tourists.    A friend and I went here to enjoy a tasty steak, and that's just what we did.  Since we were there early, we had run of the place.  We took photos of the different booths where Sinatra, Elvis, Sammy Davis, Jr. and Dean Martin dined.  The hostess showed us a side room where she said Tony Spilotro would dine and she had a story about a counter where their guns were placed before they sat down.  When she said that he was there only a month before his body was found in the desert (after he was murdered, he was buried in a field in Indiana), it cast a little doubt on the authenticity of her story.  Enough of that, on to the meal.  We both ordered the 12 ounce filet that their menu refers to as \"the Aristocrat of Tenderness).  I ordered a chopped green salad with Roquefort dressing.  I got the jumbo baked potato that the menu bills as \"Vegas' biggest.\"  Finally, we each had some chocolate cake for dessert.  The bread basket was simply some sliced Italian bread--nothing special.  The steaks were wonderful.  Mine was very tender.  I ordered it black and blue and that's almost the way I got it.  It was done a bit more than I prefer.  My friend ordered his well done--he's a Brit--go figure, but he enjoyed his steak, too!  I only got butter with the baked potato and it was swimming in butter.  It was excellent!  My friend got fries which he described as chips as good as you can get in the States and as good as what he gets at home.  We both ordered the chocolate cake.  This was a bit of a disappointment.  It was a bit dry and a bit small.  There was no dollop of whipped cream to dress it up.    Service was great.  Our server has been with the Golden Steer for years, and he was on top of everything.  Very nice dining experience in a classic Las Vegas steakhouse that has been around for years and years.",

    "text": "I've been coming here for years and always enjoy it.  Since I'm new to Yelp I thought I'd make this one of my first reviews.  The Steer just oozes 1960's steakhouse.  If you aren't old enough to remember back then you may want to make comments about how dated it looks and how uninspired the menu is.... so you should not even stop here but just head right over to Prime at the Bellagio.  If, however, you have a clue and enjoy this type experience, read on.  The first time I came (many years ago), it was slow so the lovely lady who takes care of seating gave me the whole story of how the guys from the Ratpack used to go there after their shows for dinner.  They even have the booths that each of them traditionally sat in marked with plaques.  These days it's rarely slow and I would suggest reservations.  For those goofs that somehow seem to think the world is supposed to make way for their last minute whims, there is a bar area where you can wait.  Start with the seafood sampler but be sure to tell them for how many.  Not as much variety as some of the more elaborate offerings in Vegas, but not as expensive, either.  Follow up with the traditional French onion soup for sure.  Traditional in the 1960's sense.  Perfectly acceptable if you know what to expect... if you're a snotty food snob, maybe not for you.  The steaks are great.  If you want to argue about level of doneness when it's brought to you, please educate yourself before doing so.  They will of course do their best to please you but I have been present more than once when a pompous ass tries to show off what they think they know about internal temps for different levels of doneness only to end up proving how little they actually know.  I've never done desert here as I'm partial to Lappert's ice cream (another review to get done) and feel like the time for my driver to get into downtown is worth it.  I can say that the espresso is good and will send you on your way with a little energy to get moving after a heavy meal.  All in all this place is a great nostalgic experience for us older folks who appreciate the traditional and are not looking for the latest gastro-craze goofiness.",

We sat at the DiMaggio booth and the vibe of the place was really quite terrific.  The food, on the other hand... tasted really bland and dated.  We ordered the Chateaubriand for two.  The temperature on the steak was perfect.  However, there was not a lick of salt or pepper on either the vegetables or the meat.  I don't just mean that it was underseasoned, either... it literally tasted like a steak for someone who isn't allowed to consume added salt.  I'm not sure how can you leave cooked asparagus or broccoli unsalted?!  The dish did come with bernaise and hollandaise, and I presume that this was meant as the seasoning agent... but even still, the steak and veggies should have been seasoned.  The food was a massive letdown.  If they could just salt their dishes, then I think you have a winner.",

It was late and only 3 other couples were there. The decor was old school. The waiters were dressed elegantly. We had the house cab which was good. We started with the oysters Rockefeller and the flavor was yummy goodness. I had the filet mignon and crab legs and my honey had the 22 ounce bone in rib eye with a side of creamy spinach.

    "text": "Dined at this restaurant hoping to experience some of the charm of old Las Vegas. Unfortunately we only found some good sides, pictures of past celebrities, and poor customer service.  When we first arrived and were walking up to the front door we were not greeted by a valet or door man, but by a transient who was going through the butts in the ashtray next to the front door. When checking in at the host stand I mentioned that we had a reservation, and was told to pick any table since few tables were in use. I suggested that the host check the reservation two more times, hoping that he would see the special occasion notes that were made with it, The host did not check the reservation and I was never able to covertly mention the special occasion throughout the evening.  After selecting a table our drink orders were taken by the host. A short time later a waiter came to the table who spoke with a thick accent and was somewhat difficult to understand. He seemed to indicate that our drinks probably were not being made and said he would check on them. When the drinks did arrive, the waiter commented that it was a good thing he checked because they were not being made, then asked if we were ready to order. Waiter never introduced himself or explained anything about the restaurant or menu. We placed our orders of rib eye (medium rare) and fillet mignon (medium) with a table side Caesar, side salad, creamed corn, and twice baked potato.  Salads came to table and a busser/expediter tried to remove them from he table while we were still holding forks and eating. Explained to him that we were not done yet, but would definitely set our forks down on the plate when we were. Same young man came back about four minutes later and tried to take the salads again!  The entree's were brought by someone other than the server. The cooked medium was fine, but the medium rare was over cooked. When the server was flagged down by us (never came by on his own) we advised of the issue. The server looked at the cut and excused himself to get a woman who appeared to be the manager. We explained again that the piece was over cooked, and the server interrupted the conversation with the manager to insist that we cut further into the center of the steak in hopes that the exact center of the steak might be to our liking. The manager admonished the server a little, and said obviously the steak was over cooked and had a new one ordered.  When the replacement cut arrived it was under cooked and almost slimy. My partner was frustrated as my meal was almost completed at this time, and when asked if they should fire it up again we declined because my meal was nearly completed and mentioned to them that the cooks at a \"fine\" steak house should be able to get their cuts cooked correctly since that is their specialty.  We left feeling quite disappointed in our attempt to visit \"Old Vegas\" hospitality and dining, and have told friends both in LV and going to visit to skip this steak shop.",

I love nostalgia and especially the vibe of the golden age of Vegas, but that is all this place is surviving on and poorly at best.   The steakhouse salad we were served was disgraceful. The cheapest white garbage iceberg lettuce (cmon people, not a leaf of green) inadequately drained with chunks of carrot that were actually old and dried out, 5-6 chickpeas, husband had a tomato slice, all topped in an already runny \"Roquefort \" dressing. Diluted Roquefort dressing my favorite.  Prime rib was not prepared to temperature. No flavor. No herb crust. I prepare prime rib multiple times a year in salt crust and it's flavorful moist and delicious. This was NOT from top grade quality prime rib! The broccoli was essentially raw. The generic French Bagette wasn't even Trader Joe's or Smiths quality. Very generic. Dining partner had lamb chops which were decently flavorful. Nothing to rave about.  Service was \"ok\" but water spilled on member of our party. Main course dishes left to sit for was toooo long after dining was complete.  The vibe is one of surviving on a shoestring. ...Serving a fairly low quality and mediocre flavor experience for ridiculous prices to maximize profit. The leather circular booths are nostalgic. Don't look on the ledges surrounding where they meet the wall where some giant wine and liquor bottle replicas sit. Dust is 1/4 inch thick...  Look for this to make it maybe a few more years. Could be made really appealing. Clean it up a little, do a little overhaul and for Gods sake get a real chef in charge who didn't start his career  as a short order cook at Denny's.   Disappointing would be an understatement.",

The food is amazing: Caesar Salad is made at your table from scratch, Steak is perfectly done, the twice baked potato is a must 2. Love love love the atmosphere 3. Stiff drinks and good wine list  I can't understand why people poo poo this anything below 4 stars... and the reviews that complain about the servers... nonsense... old school gentlemen in tuxes who are no-nonsense.  I think others who don't dig it are used to the steak houses in the hotels that are more modern decor and such... pussies",

Just take a look at the exterior building, and the signage, and you'll know what I mean.  Once you enter the restaurant, you'll see the decor of an era that has come and gone, with the leather red booths, and classic bar.  If you are expecting or desire up to the date modern plating and presentation, this is not your cup of tea, unless you count 70's plating style as modern.    However, taken as a whole, serves good food with period decor and atmosphere that just isn't replicable and if replicate just isn't genuine.   My steak was cooked to temperature, I enjoyed the huge shrimp cocktail, and the twice cooked baked potato, as well as the caesar salad.",

There were 9 of us so to make it less confusing we had 2 people in our party order all the appetizers and the sides so we could share.  Three of the  fourteen  that we ordered were missing and it took another 15 min for those to arrive with no apology.  Our Waiter acted as though it was our fault. Everyone ordered their own dinner but I personally ordered 4 sides of mushrooms, 2 with butter and 2 without.  When the mushrooms came with the main dishes only 3 were delivered and it took 20  minutes to get the last one so most of us were finishing our steaks.  My prime rib had no flavor and was tough.  An expensive meal to be so disappointing.  One of the people in our party told the waiter she is vegetarian so she just ordered the baked potato as her entree.  When it was delivered, it had a lot of bacon on it so she was unable to eat it.  The waiter was indifferent. There were 2 birthdays in our party so they promised a complimentary piece of cheesecake but it wasn't delivered until after the bill was paid.  The 2 birthday people left after the bill was paid to go to a show so the waiter wouldn't leave the complimentary cheesecake with the remaining 7 people at the table.  How petty was that when it was his fault that he didn't get the cheesecake to the table 2 hours after we sat down and the bill was paid.  The 7 left at the table were just finishing the wine I personally brought which had a corkage fee of $30 per bottle for a total of $120 for 4 bottles.  We had been to the Classic Steakhouse at Circus Circus 2 nights earlier and the wine corkage fee was waived for a party this big and the food was fantastic.  Great Classic atmosphere but when you have bad service it takes away from the atmosphere and the food.",

The ambience and history of the restaurant make the dinner that much more memorable. We ordered 3 cuts: 2 bone in 22 oz ribeyes, 1 - 16 oz New York strip and 1 diamond Jim cut prime rib that was 24 oz. we started with the seafood stuffed mushrooms and ordered 3 sides to split between the four of us, which was more than enough to share and we had leftovers: creamed spinach, twice baked potato and sauteed mushrooms. We ended the meal with a shared order of the table side prepared bananas foster - to die for. It had this amazing pop of orange zest. Best I've ever had by far. On top of this amazing dinner, the staff is fantastic. They interacted with us and made the experience even more memorable. We come to Vegas at least once a year to visit family and this has always been on our list to try and I'm so glad we did.",

Good traditional prime rib and rib eye. It was cooked to the right temperature of medium rare. My husband ordered the $34 salmon and it was dry. That was a disappointment. But I told him who orders seafood at a steakhouse? LOL. We had the cream of spinach and the potato lyonnaise. I took a bite out of my neighbors baked potato- should have had ordered that instead. Sidecar was potent - thank you! The crowning moment of experiencing the flaming banana foster could be more theatrical. I had to ask the server to tell me about the restaurant which I think he could've entertained us more especially for a $1000 bill. He gave us history of the restaurant, the Brat pack and the Mafia. Now that is how you wow your guest.",

I usually start commenting on the food, but this time will start with the staff and service. WOW!  Amazing!  Excellent!  These folks have it together and didn't miss a beat all evening. From the time we walked in, they make you feel like family and that we are supposed to be here.  Once we were all situated and seated, the main waiter gave us a run down the appetizers and wine/drink selections. But he also proceeded to tell us a short story of the history of the Golden Steer. Very intriguing. Love the old pictures of Dean Martin and Sammy Davis jr.  For apps we ordered several of the seafood platters. Scallops, shrimp, crab, oysters and prepared to perfection. A few bottles of red wine were in order since we all selected steak as our main course. I personally had the 22oz ribeye. Delicious. Several others had Filet or prime rib. No one left hungry this evening and we skipped dessert.   I would HIGHLY recommend stopping by when in town and making this one of your meals in Vegas.",

My ribeye was very good. We ordered brocolli and a twice baked potatoe as a side. The sides were mediocre. The steak truly was the highlight of dinner.   The steakhouse totally had a old school feel to it. Dim lights, leather booths, and rat pack memorabilia.   It was a good no thrill restuarant, away from the vegas crowds. Would come again.

The steaks are my absolute favorite, very worth the high price.   Only two issues, one being the woman on the phone had attitude, I was trying to book a reservation and for some reason she didn't sound polite, she came off stuck up and rude. Always train your staff to be super sweet and professional with costumers.  Second being, it's super awkward when a waiter comes up to you at the end of the meal with a hand held credit card processing machine, where you're forced to pay the bill and select a tip option right in front of the server. I feel that should be a private choice to make, without the scrutinizing pressure. Why don't they just run cards the old fashioned way? If Frank Sinatra ever ate here, I doubt he had to experience that nonsense.   Food warrants the pricing, outter facade and a few other things need some work.",

The service was pretty slow overall and had a hard time knowing who our waiter was, or getting the attention of any waiter at all. The steak was good, as you should expect in a expensive steakhouse, but the fries just didn't cut it --they were pretty burnt when they came out. When the time came to bring out the birthday dessert, the waiter literally put the dessert in front of me, lit the candle, and stood there. He didn't sing or comment or even talk, just kinda stood there and stared at us.  I wasn't sure if that was restaurant policy or what, so I tried not to think anything of it. A few moments later, another table had a birthday, and the same waiter sang to them and did this whole thing. Like ok????? Time came for the check and the waiter (whom we had probably seen once) was shocked at our complaints and simply gave us attitude. For being so renown and expensive, it wasn't an experience worth the price, and the customer service didn't make up for it. Won't return.",

The food is supposed to be good as well as the history of the place.    When my friend mentioned he'd like to go here on his \"Goodbye Vegas\" tour (he's from here and moving \"forever\" away), I figured this would be the perfect time to finally try this place out.  Upon walking in, you can feel the history and not just with the kitsch on the walls.  Coming in from outside is almost like a time warp.  It's very reminiscent of what a \"fancy\" restaurant was like for me as a child.  I personally love the decor and ambiance.  Pure classic old school steakhouse.     While we didn't eat dinner, we did get a couple cocktails at the bar.  There's a section that's a couch, a love seat and few wing back chairs.  This couch is the most comfortable leather couch you'll ever sit in.  A very nice place to have a few drinks and conversation.  The bar is pretty big as well.  This section, plus ample bar tables and the bar itself (about 15 people long).  The service was good.  Bartender was quick and available.  Came by our seats to check on us.    The drinks were great.  The Golden Steer was perfect.  Great balance and really pretty.  The negroni was excellent and perfectly bitter in the right way.  I tried my friend's Bramble.  A little sweet but still very good.  Definitely looking forward to having a meal here.",

The other night we finally booked a table and went.   WOW! Everything about our experience was perfect. From the greeting, seating, our team of waiters, and the manager stopping by to check on us - TOP NOTCH.   The food is great, we love shared sides, and all the selections of main courses - so GOOD!   Our waiter Carl was a dream. Funny, engaging, super helpful, and just meshed well with our personalities - we will be requesting him from now on.   I ordered (at the waiter's suggestion) the Filet Oscar, on special that night. And it was DELISH! Thanks Carl.   The hubs ordered the 12 oz filet and it was just as tasty. The cut, prep, everything was YUM!   We are thrilled that our first time was so good - it will most definitely not be our last.   Thanks again, Golden Steer - we will see you again soon!  Cheers!",

    "text": "Talk about old school cool!  In town for business we always try to have a nice meal on the trip.  Perusing the hotel steakhouse offerings, they all seemed pretty similar and we weren't getting excited.  Then the bartender at our hotel recommended the Golden Steer.  Off the strip, we thought, we'd give it a chance.  Pulling up to the restaurant, it isn't much too look at.  Stepping in is taking a time machine back to the 60's style, with coffered ceilings and old style booths.  Straight out of Good Fellas I tell ya!  All the waiters were in tuxes, very well dressed, but the atmosphere was more casual, not so stodgy which we enjoyed.  The food, excellent.  Tried the scratch made Cesar Salad, the best cesar I've ever had.  The prime rib was perfectly prepared, much much better than Lawry's (I'll never go back to a Lawry's ever again) and I got it Oscar, cuz why not.   The Australian lobster tail had a great sweet flavor you expect from Australian lobster tails.  Moscow mules, well made.  All in all, if you have been too Vegas and haven't been too the Golden Steer, you haven't visited Vegas.  This excellent experience really has gotten me to consider getting out of the casinos for eating experiences.  The service was top notch and the experience was refreshing.  I think everything is better once you get out of those damn casinos!",

Major twist... Once you go in, you are transported in time to glamorous 60's!    In summary, best meal we had in Vegas (relative to value)!  Ordered oyster Rockefeller, stuffed mushroom, prime ribs - 10 and 18 oz - with side dishes Jumbo potato, creamed spinach & corn. Couldn't venture out this time on table side Caesar salad because of the recent e-coli outbreak. Maybe next time.  For someone who dislikes raw oyster, oyster Rockefeller was a perfect appetizer. Had better stuffed mushrooms but the important stuff, Prime Ribs, were cooked spot on - medium rare! Tasted better than Lawry's (and maybe better than House Of Prime Ribs in SF). Creamed corn was a tad sweet but couldn't stop eating. Creamed spinach was right on.  Definitely better attentive services than HOPR by Ali and his staffs! That is a huge~ plus.  All this feast (and some non-alcoholic drinks) was at about 1 person's price at a high end strip location restaurant. I like it!",

It has old world Vegas charm and friendly, professional staff who helped make it a great night. At our table we had two filets and one rib-eye. All three of us thought our steaks were perhaps the best ever. Cocktails, salads, sides, wine, coffee and dessert were also great.

From the service to the Desert everything was so good. The staff was so friendly and you felt like they truly wanted to make your time with them amazing.I know its not really a big deal but even the Ice tea was so fresh and perfect and the glass never when empty, the waiter would fill it again just after a few sips. I would suggest that if your looking for the best food and a real nice time you need to have dinner at this restraint when in Las Vegas.",

The side car and cosmo were great.  The ambiance is amazing and the knowledge that Clark had of the history of the place and his story telling was amazing. If you go ask to sit I the rat pack section and let the stories fly. Felt like I was transported back In Time to to 50's-60's. The place has a great feel don't  let the outside fool you. Open the doors have a drink in the lounge and enjoy the expierience.",

The ambiance and interior space are like so thoroughly nostalgic and exude that old school Vegas glamour (this restaurant has been open for 60 years, so it's actually like a perfect time capsule of that era). The service was exceptional; we had not one but TWO waiters, Scott and Eduardo, who were both really nice and super attentive. Also, Fabian from the kitchen was really sweet and offered to bring our food back out to present a second time without me even asking (my uncle was in the bathroom when he brought it the first time and he must have intuitively known I wanted to include him in the food presentation, lol). This was an amazing dining experience I will for sure treasure.",

    "text": "It was my husbands 30th birthday! His father was in town with his girlfriend   ... And wanted to take us out to dinner... We were having a hard time coming up with somewhere to eat...and I suggested the Golden Steer..have never been, but a landmark in Vegas I had always wanted to try... I am a upscale hairstylist and take many clients out and suggest many places to clients... Who are also educated and well to do....  We had reservations for 4 people at 7:45...     We walked in and over to his father and girlfriend sitting at the bar... they looked a bit frustrated...said they had been sitting there for 10+ mins and had not been offered a drink.. Said that \"It  seemed as if bartender couldnt have been bothered\"... Tried asking the bartender myself for a service when he had a moment... Didn't really aknowlage me and we stood there another 5 mins... I guess that should have been our sign... Decided to just go to dinner and order wine at the table... Stood at the front podium where I noticed an older lady who was our hostess? No greeting .. Just 4? And turns....we follow hoping that we should be .... Sit at the table and young man offers us water.., yes please and can we order some wine?              Then our waiter appears...      Fabian, I'm told later, he states  \"So we are in dire need of drinks!??\" with a condescending undertone, but doesn't even have the wine menu with him!.. Walks back and practically drops it in my husbands lap.  Another 15 mins later ! Comes back and we eagerly order wine and an appetizer. Fabian \"our waiter\" doesnt ask if there is a special occasion? nor does he introduce himself..or anything of that nature a waiter should do...  we are now all picking up his rude attitude around the table.. My father in laws girlfriend leans into me and says ... Did we do something wrong to our waiter? I has just wondered that myself I replied... With a shrug..;( When the wine and appetizer comes its been another length of time... Fabian drops it off and my husband has to call to him, quickly as he is already 10 feet from our table  ... \"Excuse me... But may we order please ??\"  Then he hastily takes our order in a way as if he is too busy to be doing so, doesn't write it down.. ...doesn't take our enormous menus from the table. My husband asks him to \"Please be more diligent with us and  would you mind checking on us more often, we also need...........\" ( I kid you not as he asking him this he is literally shaking his head yes while walking away before he can actually finish his sentence!  A few more minutes later a NEW waiter comes, I guess Fabian just handed us off?, with our wine and is much nicer but pours my Cabernet into my father in laws Zinfandel glass with wine actually still in it (cab is red and zin is pink)  I'm sure everyone knows and hate to say it but its absolutely a fau pas to do that..... .. Wow ! That's never actually happened before ) gives me my husbands merlot and  2 down and 2 to go... Father in laws girlfriend gets her Chardonnay (yay!) and no Zinfandel for for him;(.   Ah yes okay 3 wrong 1 right... Hahaha its almost comical how bad this is going The rest if the dinner is satisfactory.. ALL IN ALL... the food was very decent,  service sucked so  horribly bad that the overpriced (decent food ) was NOT worth it!!  Will be telling my family friends and  clients not to go..",

I ordered a coke which was flat,  a garden salad that was drenched in ranch, a filet mignon medium rare that was tasty and cooked to perfection, creamed spinach that was so soupy and runny it was disgusting, whipped potatoes that tasted like box potatoes, the \"famous\" garlic bread was burned and tasted like there wasn't even a hint of garlic on it, for dessert cherries jubilee that ended up like a soupy mess..the bill was $246.67 of course before tip. I have had much better service and food at other steakhouses.. I should've stuck with Anthony's at the M. They never do me wrong.",

    "text": "I went here with a few friends on friday and our experience on this night moved me to make this my first review.  First off, I'm a fan of this place, I've been here a few times.  It's a local steakhouse, interesting history, a real old school Vegas feel and definitely a place to try if you're looking for something cool and different in ambiance in LV.    So the service is eh, average.  Although the host was excited we were there, the waiter was less than friendly, robotic, interested in taking our order, and moving on to the next table.   The food was good, traditional steak, american and some italian pasta dishes.  We ordered the escargot, crab cakes and calamari.  The escargot were good, buttery and garlic-y.  The crab cakes big, nice and calamari was just ok.  I tried the lobster bisque and it was delicious.  Everyone had a some sort of steak and we shared the asparagus, which were done very well with a nice buttery hollandaise and also mashed potatoes.  When we got our steaks, one was wrong, not just grilled wrong but the wrong cut.  After a 10 minute wait the correct steak was brought out.  And it was disappointing that when the bill came out, we were charged for that steak despite the inconvenience and error on their part....and our starving guest having to wait for his food!    The Golden Steer has been around forever and obviously do things well and it is a must try place.  In the future though, I may try other local steakhouses unless I'm dragged here again by a GS virgin.  This experience was less than golden so I rate it 3 stars until they fully win me over again.",

    "text": "My husband and I ate here on May 16, 2013.  We've lived here for over 10 years and I have been wanting to go here for quite some time.  The ambience is nice - very old school Vegas, and romantic.  The service is also top notch.  Unfortunately, other than the caesar salad, the praise ends there.   The bread served was warm and tasted fine, but the butter was sour.  At first we thought perhaps we were eating sourdough bread, but when we tasted the two separately, it was obvious the problem lay in the butter.  We brought this to our waiter's attention, and it was quickly removed, and no replacement was brought out, which makes me think perhaps their entire butter supply was spoiled.  My husband wanted to flee, but I decided to stay the course.   Next up was the caesar salad, prepared table-side, which was tasty and fresh.   My husband ordered the ribeye, and I the t-bone steak.  We both asked for medium-rare and they turned out to be more on the rare side.  My husband's was good, albeit slightly chewy.  Mine, on the other hand, was absolutely awful.  The first few bites were o.k., and then somewhere in there the meat started to taste like liver.  I was amazed - maybe they had inadvertently dropped some butter on the grill?  Anyway, I had to return it.  The waiter brought out some prime rib gratis, even though I told him I didn't want any.  I'm not a prime rib person so I only took a bite;  hubby tried it and gave it a \"meh\".   This isn't something you would hear me say too often, but I should have listened to my husband and bolted the minute we tasted the butter.  Despite it's Vegas charms, this place does not deliver.",

So one Tuesday night, with Groupon in hand, the hubby and I ventured out to not the best neighborhood in town and tried it out for dinner. After walking past the neighboring seedy bar (the one that had signs saying \"Karaoke With Porn Stars\" plastered on the window), we walked into the Golden Steer. We were immediately welcomed and noticed the bar was bustling. The decor/ambience - dark, wood paneling, cowboy oil paintings, big horns on each wall, red pleather booths, staff in tuxedos - classic or cheesy? I can't decide. In comparison to the polished, popular places on the strip, I'll be nice and say vintage Vegas.   The lobster bisque was thick, heavy and creamy, and not in a good way. Consistency resembled ... plaster mix.   I ordered the NY Strip. Cooked perfectly. Very good. The hubby's rib eye was a little overcooked. But was ok. We've definitely had better for about the same price range in places like Mortons or Ruths Chris.   Overall, the whole experience was ok. Service was good. Not sure if we would eat here again though, but I'm glad we tried out it out, at least to experience a little \"old Vegas\".",

The steak was good but over cooked \"rare\" and the potato was sent back because it had a slice in the skin and 1/4 of the potato was black.  No quality check before serving the meal.

You feel like you are entering the 60's version of Las Vegas. Pretty classy. I was greeted by a beautiful hostess who led me straight to my table. From there it seemed like I had two waiters for some reason checking up on me. It was kind of weird.  I end up ordering the Caesar Salad, Stuffed Seafood Mushrooms, and the Bone in Ribeye Steak.  Caesar Salad: (5/5) The salad was tossed right at the table with all the classic ingredients. The salad itself was amazing, probably the best caesar salad i've had. You could taste the subtlety of the anchovy. The croutons were also crisp, by airy.   Stuffed Seafood Mushrooms: (2/5) I really did not like this appetizer. Usually I don't regret my orders, but this one was a big time meh. While the mushroom was cooked fine, the seafood stuffing was bland, lacked texture, and just tasted whatever. I had to force myself to finish it. Honestly, my friend makes a better version of stuffed mushrooms.   Bone in Ribeye Steak: (4/5) The steak came out on a sizzling plate and looked like ready to beast on. The first couple bites were out of this world. It was perfectly marbled. I was ready to give the trophy as the best steak to this one. But as I beasted on the edges of the steak, the interior got a tad bit tough and was not marbled. As I got closer to the bone, the marbling came back, and I was happy again.",

Fabian made us laugh and just made the dinner so much more delightful. He was poking fun at me for ordering an espresso while I was munching on my steak which sent me into scores of giggles (I must admit it isn't like me to have espresso before dessert...but I was dragging butt). Then he made the most amazing bananas foster table side. It was hot, sweet, tasty and gave us a good show by setting it on fire before pouring it over ice cream.

Very typical steakhouse fare but low quality steaks, a really, really crappy $20+ Caesar Salad (maybe the worst I've ever had) ....everything else marginal. The stuffy waiter was telling me how their Black Peppercorn Sauce was similar to a Bordelaise Sauce.......not even ballpark. It truly added nothing to the meal and was very bland (and about $5 extra)......a baked potato with too much butter & sour cream can be had anywhere...or at home for pennies on the dollar. Their desserts were ordinary.   Folks, there is nothing special about this place as far as I'm concerned. Decor is OK, certainly nothing to go out of your way for.   I am not a snob foodie at all, however: I cannot really see the appeal of your typical everyday steakhouse anyway. The food  all seems the same whether its Ruth Crist, Mortons or the Golden Steer. I admit to not having tried some of the joints from famous names (Craft, etc). A steak plopped onto plate is pretty boring and lacks insperation, and I can do a better technical job of cooking it myself.   If you want some tasty beef \"on the cheap\", pass this place by and head out to Southpoint Casino where for $16 (total) you can have a pretty good slice of prime rib with all the trimmings.....and it is, by far, more delicious than this hole. Or I have heard good reviews for some of the other pricey places....just don't do this one......really.  The only people I would \"Steer\" here are unwelcome visitors, drunken tourists, superstar entertainers, and a few deserving others that I know of.",

    "text": "While the steak and table side Cesar Salad was perfection, NOTHING else at this restaurant was even close to acceptable.  From the moment we arrived, until we left, our service was simply HORRIBLE. First, at the hostess stand the hostess stood glaring at her computer screen as we stood waiting to be acknowledged. Never did acknowledge us, so we turned around and went to the bar. 2 cocktails (a beer and a wine) 17 bucks, gave the older man bartender a 20 and he NEVER CAME BACK WITH OUR CHANGE! The assumption that, that was his tip was rude and in very bad service and bad form. Of course he was going to get that as his tip, but to assume. BAD!  VERY BAD. Its stealing! And if he \"forgot\" even worse, he shouldn't be working at such a restaurant as the Golden Steer.  So we went back to the stand and the \"harried\" hostess was able to accommodate our reservation, clueless as to our earlier \"encounter\".  The food service was slow, wreck-less (no refills of anything: water, bread, butter, coffee, or up-sell cocktails!), and the removal of dirty plates never happened. We stacked our plates to get them out of our way after sitting empty in front of us for 15 minutes.  The Prime aged 20 oz. T Bone was very good, as was the Cesar Salad. AS FOR the desert - forget it!! I wanted REAL NY cheesecake: I got Sara Lee...Im almost positive; NOT restaurant QUALITY in the least.  Coffee arrived bitter, luke warm, and no refills were offered.  In closing, Id skip Golden Steer. There are wayyyyy too many fine steak house in Vegas to be bothered with this dinosaur.",

I would try the other steakhouses that have similar price ranges, but better prepared steaks.  Probably won't return as there are a plethora of other steakhouses in LV that are better.",

The salad was not anything to rave about and the steak was served with steamed vegetables. I could have cooked this at home and done a better seasoning job. The waiters were more attentive to the tables with the big drinkers and after our food was served there was minimal interaction with us (only one glass of wine). What surprised me the most was when what I am assuming was the manager went over to the table next to us and requested that they move their party into the bar after they were done and relaxing. I know they were busy, however they had not finished long before that happened. Even thought this was not directed towards us I was immediately turned off. Will not return to this restaurant and will not recommend to anyone.",

    "text": "Wonderful hosts and superlative hospitality. One of the few stand-alone steakhouse establishments who offer the traditional accouterments of fine dining.  Unfortunately, those efforts seem to be wasted on most of the \"come as you are\" patrons who are most likely more comfortable with casual style dining.  Perhaps if you check your potty-mouthed, entitlement attitude at the door and, leave the flat-billed cap in your totally sick, lifted monster truck, wear a buttoned-up, collared shirt over your wife beater and \"I'm dangerous\" tattoos, keep your bro-ho in check and, generally speaking, act like civilized human beings, you may find your experience here even more delightful.  Seated in the DiMaggio booth, (my personal favorite), started dinner with a Cesar Salad, best I've ever had. The table side, properly trained technique, attention to detail in the presentation and preparation with fresh ingredients is superb.  I highly recommend the Chateaubriand for two, ordered medium rare. By the time it is sliced and plated table side, it has rested to perfection. Much better than most steakhouses serving up average $45 strip steaks. Spend the extra twenty, enjoy the show, and enjoy a proper cut of beef, served in a manner befitting an adult with refined tastes. The twice-baked potato is delicious!   Desert? Cherries Jubilee. Anytime you can have someone bring a pan of something sweet, covered in Kirschwasser, Cognac, or Brandy, and flambeed at your table, DO IT! Queen Victoria would be honored.  The Golden Steer has been and IS the best of Las Vegas.",

I would not mind spending nearly $400 for dinner for two (1 appetizer, two steak and lobster combos and 5 drinks) if the food was amazing.   I would have been irked spending that much of the food was just good.  Because the food was mediocre, at best, I was very upset.     I wasn't keen on the service.  But, that was no big deal.   The big deal was that the steak and lobster came out lukewarm.  And, the lobster was TOUGH.  I couldn't even cut it easily with my knife.  All this for $110 per person for the steak and lobster combo.    The creamed spinach tasted odd.  The twice baked potato was fantastic.     To be fair, I have to admit that I did not complain.   It was our first wedding anniversary and we were just so disappointed, we really ate what we could - left - and got a late night pizza that was amazing.",

Two of us got Caesar salads and mine came out right away and hers came during dinner, neither were made table side. The waiter got the wrong wine for my friend and said he would take care of it, he didn't get her another glass on the house or do ANYTHING about it. The food is extremely overpriced, but it's a steakhouse in Vegas.  Our waiter then brought out four desserts for our \"birthdays\" which was fun, but we didn't want all of that dessert and then felt the need to tip him. We asked for a dessert menu and he brought a bunch of desserts instead.  I purposefully didn't get my own steak, just had a few bits of my husbands, because I knew I wouldn't be able to eat it all...but still, I don't know - $120 for one steak, a twice baked potato, a Caesar salad and a glass of wine seems excessive, but we overtipped because of all of the desserts we didn't eat.

They messed up our bill adding a extra $50 for something we didn't buy, the waiter was kinda rude.. But we was the only blacks in there so maybe that's why all this occurred. With all the great reviews I can't understand why it was that bad! I have it 2 stars because it beautiful inside and the calamari was great!",

    "text": "So I am a big fan of the Rat Pack. No I don't mean Molly Ringwald, Emilio Estavez, Anthony Michael Hall, or Ally Sheedy. I'm talking about Frank, Dean, and Sammy baby. I'm talking about a time when being smooth was what it was all about and the dolls bore names like Marilyn Monroe, Judy Garland, and Shirley Maclaine.   I am also a big fan of Vegas and despite it's several facelifts over the years the gold mine in the desert is one of my favorite places on the planet. This is where the magic happened and sometimes still does, especially when I'm rollin the dice and lady luck is kind to me. Unlike many who go for the mega-clubs, rollercoaster's, and the latest Cirque du Soleil act. I go for the nostalgic shows and spots that make Vegas . . . VEGAS BABY!!!  One such stop is the legendary Golden Steer. This place is where the rats themselves would frequent which automatically makes it a must on my to do list. So after arriving in town Niki and I got ourselves ready and hit the road. Golden Steer is located on W Sahara Avenue just off the strip. Parking is convenient and it may not look like much on the outside but just wait. When you enter it is like you have been time warped to the late 50's-early 60's. The decor has an old school class that is rarely seen anymore but strangely still sheik. The wood plank walls and red leather booths set the scene and one feels transported to a different time almost instantly after being seated.   The staff is impeccable and informative answering every question and open to offering recommendations without making one feel uninformed. Drinks are a must and something classic is on my mind. I order a whiskey sour and as quickly as I ordered it arrives. It is absolutely perfect and if you like classic cocktails I guarantee that this is the place. When the waiter returned to take our order. To start we ordered the Caesar Salad for two prepared tableside. For our entrees Niki ordered the NY Strip and I the Prime Rib - End Cut with a Jumbo Baked Potato.  In a few short minutes a table was wheeled over and the salad was prepared. It was a show all by itself and it was clear this fellow has made this many times over the years. Let the eating begin. This is not your usual Caesar Salad by any means. The mix of vegetables makes this a more hearty Caesar but the hints of spice and anchovies is blended perfectly to taste.  After we were finished with our salads the entrees and sides arrived. Niki's strip was so tender she could cut it with a fork and my prime rib was equally tender and thick. Both cooked medium rare, juicy, and oh so delicious. This steak ranks up there at the top of my all time favorites.  The jumbo potato was simply that - jumbo. It was huge and cooked perfectly. It came with chives, sour cream, and butter. The combination as always, spectacular.  Now I know that Golden Steer is known for it's Bananas Foster prepared tableside but I am not that big a fan. So Niki and I order the cheesecake. I know it is a safe option but boy it was good. thick, creamy, with a hint of vanilla. Niki is a big fan of cheesecake and nothing gets between her and a slice especially when the quality is this superb.  So that's it folks, the shows over. When in Vegas, do what the boys used to do. Enjoy a great meal at Golden Steer and you'll be swingin like Deano himself. Since I got our attention I want to leave you with a quote from the man himself.  \"I feel sorry for people who don't drink. They wake up in the morning and that's the best they're going to feel all day.\"  Dean Martin",

    "text": "Las Vegas native that I am, i've been coming to this place for over 45 years. Though I've moved away and live in Berkeley's gourmet ghetto, I still come when I'm in town. The food is great, with fine quality steaks, wonderfully fresh oysters (how do they do that in Vegas?), Ceasar salad and cherries jubilee made table side, and a great ambiance that is light years away from some of the cookie cutter places on the strip.   This place has seen a lot of interesting faces and history in its time (rat pack and otherwise) and holds that in its bones. The hostess is warm and attentive, and the bartender Joe, who's been there for a gazillion years, is a classy work of art, never forgets a face, pours a fine drink, and is very welcoming. I confess that I like some of the old time waiters the best, particularly a waiter named Fabian, an Asian guy with impeccable service who's hair would make any girl swoon, be she 30 or 60, but there are some newbies that are impressive as well. These folks go out of their way to make It a special occasion for you.  I miss the piano players that they used to have here, which really set the place apart from anywhere else in Vegas, but it's still a wonderful place. Once Joe pours you a glass of wine or makes you a terrific Manhattan or Martini, you're transported back in time, ready to nestle into the red leather banquettes where Frank and his ilk once sat, and it's always a lovely visit. .",

    "text": "Started off seeing a physical golden steer off the side of the road.  I was curious.  I thought maybe it was a bar or something in a little strip mall. It ended up being a steak restaurant in an old strip mall.  It had some good reviews so I thought I would give it a try.  I was amazed when I walked in the door.  It was gorgeous inside.  Stained glass windows, nice upholstery, the lighting was good.  A hostess/waitress came over and welcomed us.  We said we were just looking and they said go ahead, walk around.  We decided to come back and eat here.  The 2nd visit was just as friendly.  We were seated at a beautiful booth.  The Hostess told us the history of the establishment.  The mobsters used to meet in the back where they had a special back door so they could get out fast if the cops arrived and in the 60's when Sammy Davis Jr could not stay in the hotels on the strip that he played at nor eat in their restaurants, he and his friends would come and eat there.   They still have his original booth with the same upholstery.  Very cool.  I love hearing the history about places.  We ordered the Caesars Salad, Steak, Prime Rib, and Asparagus. Caesers Salad was made fresh at our table and was incredible.  I would come here just for the salad. Both the steak and the Prime Rib were cooked exactly to our liking.  My husband likes Medium well and I like Black in Blue (rare&cold on the inside and just browned on the outside).  The asparagus was perfect.  Crisp, but cooked with a light sauce that was equally delicious. I will come here again.  We also saw the next table over having a birthday.  Their dessert came with sparklers and singing. :)",

Just park in front, make sure to put your alarm on and take your valuables.  1.  Ambiance - Inside it is old School Vegas or old School steak house. Dark, booths, tables. While not modern and I would wonder what the place looks like with all the lights on, this place kinda grows on you.  2.  Service - Same as the ambiance.  Old School for sure. Not your modern and gregarious type, but certainly knowledgeable and efficient!  3.  Food - All the steaks are great an I particularly enjoy the Filet and the Rib Eye.  These two cuts of meat here are fantastic, tender, perfectly cooked.  All the sides are great, especially the mushrooms!    4.  Price - A bit on the expensive side, but most steak places are.  5.  And... you can come here casual, dressed, in a large party or small.  This is a great place and while it may not have the \"it\" factor of other places, Golden Steer is very consistent!",

You can't help to feel like a Vegas mobster or celebrity as you walk into the Golden Steer, its decor fits the era of its existence and the service is very good.  I had the table side caesar salad, which was a neat experience. Taste was very fresh and filling. Three of us ordered prime rib of different sizes, massive cuts of meat although mine was fairly fatty the others were practically solid meat. No worries on sending anything back to the kitchen, just ask it they will handle it.  They also have a pick-up and drop-off service that works on tips, I highly recommend this!

    "text": "My dad was coming to town for his birthday and I wanted to take him somewhere Vegasy. As we were also celebrating my husband's birthday, I figured it was worth the splurge. I went in ahead of my husband and parents to give the hostess my credit card; I didn't want arguments when the bill came and she accommodated my request. The food was absolutely to die for! We got the oysters, shrimp cocktail, and fried ravioli as apps. The shrimp are huge and my husband said they were the best oysters ever. I got a bowl of clam chowder and it was seriously the best I've ever had. Everyone tried it and agreed. As for entrees: filet with crab legs (perfect) for me, a steak the size of his plate (dad), crab stuffed filet (I think) for hubs, and pasta with seafood for mom. Even though this was a highly anticipated visit with my parents from Ohio, no one spoke. The baked potatoes are big enough to share. Our table was literally overflowing with delicious food. So obviously I will go back...when I pay off this trip. I by no means think it was overpriced, but it was $500 after tip. The men each had a beer or two and my mom had a gin/tonic. The wine list looked fab and I would have indulged, but I was 7 months pregnant. The loss of a star is unfortunate- there was a group of females and older males in the back room; the \"ladies\" frequently walked past our table to the restroom and it definitely had a Goodfellas feel to it; which added to the atmosphere of old timey Vegas, but was unsettling nonetheless. Plus the hostess, while accommodating, was not dressed professionally. I just feel for a $500 dinner, I expect a higher standard. They have a dress code but hostess and much of clientele did not meet it. We'll go back!!",

When we arrived the dinning room was almost completely empty, the hostess was very sweet and set us up in a nice booth. This is where things started falling apart, it comes down to just crappy service. The waiters, dressed in tuxes gathered in a group outside the kitchen and showed little to no interest in providing any level of service. When a waiter did show up to take my coworkers drink order my coworker  asked if they had any IPA's to which the waiter said  that they had Heineken my coworker pointed out that this was not an IPA which the waiter then disputed. I asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored I went to the hostess and got one myself. I can't say enough about how bad the service was I'm pretty easy going but I was pissed my the time we were done eating. The food was good which is why I'm giving them 2 stars otherwise it would be one star.  When we were leaving  we told the hostess of our dissatisfaction and she took down our emails and assured us that we'd be taken care of and would receive some sort of compensation, over a week later this hasn't happened.",

FYI the Caesar salad is $12 a person and the dressing isn't very Ceaser-esk.  Not a fan, not going back, can not in good conscious recommend dining here.",

    "text": "Wow.... just wow... This place has the absolute best steaks that I have ever had. Went here with my wife along with my sister and her husband. Their treat I am thankful to say, lol.   The decor here is an absolute must experience for anyone living in Las Vegas, at least once. The outside of this place is extremely misleading from what actually lays on the inside. But once inside, it is classic Vegas. They have a table for the Rat Pack, a table used by Elvis, the works. The servers are friendly and we got to meet the waiter who'd been there for 30 years. The servers and the decor were all incredible in every aspect and I could find no fault whatsoever.  Now for the food... Everything is a la carte, so expect to spend a huge amount of cash. We got the stuffed mushrooms as an appetizer and they were quite yummy, but the portion was a bit small for a group of four. I got the massive Diamond Jim Cut Prime Rib which is 24 oz... I thought my stomach would explode from the size of that sucker! I got it medium rare and it was perfect, I will dream of that steak for years and years to come. Everyone else at my table got something different, wife got the veal parmigiana while my sister and her husband both got steaks, but we all agreed at the high quality.  We also ordered one of the potatoes but with my steak I never could get around to trying it =(",

My husbands's prime rib was just okay, a better one at half the cost can be had at Jerry's Nugget. Since this was a \"bucket list\" thing to do we were let down.

I had a NY Strip steak (about $40) with a chopped salad and it was one of the most mouth watering steaks I have ever eaten.

    "text": "Long on my Vegas bucket list, Golden Steer finally found me entering her hallowed halls for a recent monumental birthday celebration. The place conjures up everything that 'old Vegas' inspires in the minds of anyone of a certain age who is old enough to appreciate the Rat Pack era, but young enough to still be able to stay up as late as Sinatra did back in the day. Red leather banquettes, gold chandeliers, dim lighting, servers dressed at least as well as the patrons...it's all there. We were seated at Betty Grable's booth and promptly greeted by a somewhat aloof server. Our wine and calamari appetizer arrived quickly and we summoned our steaks and sides soon thereafter. We had ordered the signature tableside Caesar salad, but it was unfortunately forgotten. Once our steaks arrived we reminded our server of the forgotten salad and he halfheartedly acknowledged his gaffe. The hostess then arrived and told us that the salad would be compliments of the house. All appreciated. The steaks and salad were very good and prepared precisely as ordered, but once the bill arrived the salad was included. We reminded the hostess of the error and she quickly took care of it. (I wish she was waiting our table that night) Our server returned for the check, but without much to say other than the minimal niceties. All in all we definitely enjoyed our meal, but I have a feeling another server would have taken it to another level. I'd definitely visit again, but perhaps only when our particular server was enjoying a somewhat-deserved night off.",

The ambiance was nice--very old school Vegas--an older clientele. Lots of Rat Pack Music going. The service was fine, however we were disappointed in the food. My petite filet was cold and although it was cooked medium rare, like I had ordered, the cut of meat was not good. It seemed like a cheaper grade of beef than we had been served before at the Golden Steer. Also, I ordered fries that were supposed to be home cut, but were obviously frozen. My broccoli was raw. For the price we paid, we will have to reconsider & perhaps choose a more modern steakhouse with higher standards.",

The food is great and I really like the menu but the service is so terrible it ruins the entire experience.  They have a team service approach where any of the waiters can wait on you, but instead of the service being excellent they are just trying to push you out the door and you do not receive attentive service at all.  When I am paying $200 for dinner I expect the food to be excellent and the service to be professional.  The last time that we went there after we had been seated for about 15 minutes and a busser had brought us water a waiter came up to our table smacking gum, leaned on the table, clicked his pen and said \"are you ready to order?\"  WHAT!!!!!  This is something that I would expect at a Denny's not at a high end steak house.  I was actually mad that the waiter was so abrupt and I thought the gum chewing was DISGUSTING.    We explained that we were not ready to order quite yet and he just turned and walked away.  A couple minutes later another waiter comes up and says \"are you ready to order?  There was no introduction, didn't ask us if we had been there before and did not discuss the menu at all.  We finally ordered and another waiter brought our food out.  There was an issue with how the steak was cooked but we had to sit there waiting trying to catch a waiter's attention.  After sitting there for about 10 minutes not eating a waiter finally came over and asked if everything was OK (a different waiter).  We explained that there was an issue and he took the steak back.    I am actually sorry that the service is so bad because I like the restaurant, but when waiters are unprofessional and discourteous it ruins the experience for me.  The prices are commensurate with high-end steak houses on the strip but the service is not.",

However the food is extremely over-priced and very bland. For appetizers, we ordered the Toasted Ravioli with Marinara Sauce $10, which was really good.   For entree, they are best known for beef, so we order the Chateaubriand Bouquetiere for two with Hollandaise and Bearnaise Sauce ($55 per person) and we added on Whipped Potatoes $8 on the side. We have never tried Chateaubriand Bouquetiere before and it was boxed out on the menu, looked special and tempting, so we figured we'd give it a try.  The Chateaubriand Bouquetiere, which is a roasted beef tenderloin, was just ok. The sauces were very bland. For $55, it also came with some steams vegetables on the side (carrots, broccoli and asparagus), which were just plain steams with no seasoning at all. It was not even salted.   Our total (for 2 people)  with 1 drink, 1 appetizer, Chateaubriand Bouquetiere for 2, and 1 side + tax & tip, came to $180.  I don't know if we just order the wrong item from the menu or they were just having an off-day?  But we went there on a Friday night, from 5-6:45 pm. We were the only table there. There was one couple that came in during our dinner, sat down, took a look at the menu, then left. Another coouple came in as we were leaving. But overall, the place was empty on a Friday night!",

I asked about how I was dressed and if it was appropriate (shorts, collared silk shirt and flip-flops), she was cool with it. There were a few tables of people wearing golf hats, tennis shoes - Dressy? I dont think they mind.  Sat in the Mickey Rooney booth right next to the Elvis Presley booth. The Kings booth sat an extra 3-4 people. Im sure the King brought more folks in than MR ever did.  Wish I had eaten at the bar however, as I felt a little out of place with all the other groups and couples. No sweat, it worked out fine in the dining room.  Enjoyed the petite filet mignon with whipped potatoes and a stiff Jack and Coke.  The steak was almost perfect. A little overdone on the edges. The potatoes were the best Ive had!  I overheard one of the waiters saying he had worked there for 21 years. He was very helpful and attentive as were everyone else that night. I liked how the waiters were equipped with a little flashlight to help you see the menus in this dimly lit, schwanky joint!  From the outside, this place just looks like its going to do you right.

The onion soup was served somewhat lukewarm, and the flavor was average. Dover sole was excellent, as was the prime rib.  The score should be 4.5.

The one above our booth had non frosted bulbs and a Crooked shade that lit up half our table. It took almost 10 minutes for someone to come to the table and it was one of the 30 year vets. No hello or welcome just do you want a drink. After he took or order I asked him if he could either unscrew the non frosted bulbs or straighten the shade. He looks up at it and grumbles ''I'm not doing that Move to anyother table\". I've been in service for 30 years too and I've never said that to a customer. He points us to the next booth that had a reserved sign and walks away. We stand by the table not sure what to do until another waiter gestures for us to sit down at the reserved table. Having our drinks thinking ok bad start but better now when the hostess walks up to the table and loudly asks my guest if we reserved the table. I said no but could explain what happened. The old waiter was behind her. She said she new what happened and walked away. WTF then why bother us. Not an apology nothing just walks away.  One of the main reasons for going was the table side preparations. We all ordered the Caesar salad. Another one of the 30 year vets rolls up the salad cart but stops two tables away and starts making the salad. I thought it was for a center table until he served it to us. So much for the show.   Our food was eh at best. First the bring the entrees out in the middle of eating our salads and only offered to keep them warm under the lights. The prime rib ordered medium came out part rare, part medium rare and medium. Terribly uneven. The veal Marsala had absolutely no taste of wine and had a red sauce? The veal was tough. Only the chicken Angelo was decent. But hey they did bring out a tiny dry piece of cheese cake with a Roman candle. Too bad they didn't bring forks to share.   Lousy service from burned out waiters, overpriced and poorly cooked food. Don't waste your money.",

Steaks were ok. Worst creamed spinach ever. Just can't get past the rude waiter. Being a local business owner, I wonder how these people can survive in our competitive market. Don't waste your time.",

    "text": "I'd been there before with a large group (April 2009), and it was great. Some of the same group were there for this Sunday April 8th 2012 dinner. We were a large group, and the restaurant claimed it was \"no problem\". I'm sure we were all aware that we were going to be hit with an automatic 'large group' gratuity fee, and we were totally willing and able to pay it. While ordering, I inquired of our server (T#m) if it was possible to get \"separate bills\". He said that it would \"all be divided at the end\". OK. So we order. Some people's meals were much more expensive than others. The food was stellar. End of the meal, and the bill comes. One big bill. For everybody. When T#m was asked why our bills were not separated we were told: \"We don't do that here\". Which is BS, as I'd had it done before. We proceeded to spend about ONE HOUR trying to figure out who was supposed to pay for what. It COMPLETELY KILLED the good meal we had just consumed. In retrospect I believe he was just worried that we were trying to snake our way out of paying the automatic 'large group' gratuity. I normally over-tip as it is, but on this occasion I think I was sure to pay not a penny over what was required - purely out of spite. Oh yeah, he also uttered this gem: \"This isn't Denny's\". Huh, well Denny's has it all over the Golden Steer, as they automatically separate your bills! I don't think the Maitre D' was too impressed with T#m either, as he was openly mocking him whilst serving the appetizers.   It was doubly embarrassing for me personally as I had a couple of first-timers with me along for the experience. They were APPALLED at what occurred. Not a good experience, and a pricey one too!  I'd consider going again if I knew that T#m didn't work there anymore.",

    "text": "Anyone following my reviews knows how much I like good service, grand surprises and interesting anything.  The Golden Steer meets all of my criteria in such a huge way that there won't be enough room for me to sing its praises.  The strip can be so repetitive and boring.  Let's face it, sometimes over stimulation can become mundane.  The brain becomes numbed with flashing lights, bustier clad waitresses and $50 tiny bites decorated with balsamic squiggles.  Surprise me.  Take me to the Steer.  Walking in initially you'll say to yourself:  \"...What the Hell have I done?\"  (the place looks like a ranch house meets steak joint meets speakeasy - it's very old and in no way resembles the black lacquer, track-lit Wolfgang Emeril place you ate last night).  However,  if you keep an open mind, suspend your strip-sanitized expectations and really get in to it, you'll have the time of your life here.  For God's sake, people - dress up for the occasion.  Pay the proper respect to one of the last standing restaurants of old Vegas.  If it was good enough for Frank, Ava and Sammy to dress up for, it's good enough for you.    The staff fawns over the well heeled.  They,  themselves in tuxedos, bend over backward to make certain that you are comfortable, that you have what you need; they make recommendations, they give compliments, they prepare old school Caesar salad table side. The water & wine glasses are never empty.  It 's like being in an old black and white movie - they are just THAT courteous.    The food? It's not cheap, folks.  However, food is expensive in Vegas.  At the Steer, you'll be rewarded with huge, quality portions.  I am picky when it comes to red meat.  Very picky.  I like it so rare it might just be considered raw.  Few places ever get it right.  The Steer was right on the money.  My prime rib was seasoned beautifully, cooked perfectly, presented on dishes that probably have not been updated for 20+ years (to this last part I say, 'hooray'!  I'm so weary of the super slick scene in Vegas). My whipped potatoes were rich, creamy and delicious.  Don't miss the Caesar salad mentioned earlier.  They still use the raw egg and you can't beat the texture or the flavor of this authentic method.  My companion's NY steak was, again, a perfect medium-rare.  He commented that it was the best he'd had in recent memory.  Since the two of us eat out, literally, all over the U.S., Europe and central Mexico that's saying something.  I can't speak to the dessert tray as we were too stuffed for anything but coffee.  We sampled the coffee with seven liquors.  We made the mistake of ordering two and here comes my only criticism:  they are SO strong that they taste like gasoline smells.  Coupled with the bottle of wine we had, it was too much booze for one fabulous night.  I'd skip this staff recommended beverage and just have a standard cup.  When it was time to bid farewell, jump quickly back into a cab (the Steer isn't in the greatest area of town - be advised), and head back to the masses we were actually a little sad.  Everything back on the strip seemed too bright, too phony somehow.  How an old joint sporting a plaster cow outside can be glamorous is beyond me, but it is.  Eating at the Steer you'll feel like you've not only had a meal, but an adventure.  You'll also  feel a little smug having had the moxie to actually leave the strip to dine where American legends have knocked back a few together.",

    "text": "Not too happy with this place.  We went in to celebrate Fathers Day.  Although the food was pretty good (No where near worth the $!) the service was hands down the worst ever.  First off, the staff seemed irritated to be there, including the Bartender and Server. When we first came in we approached the bar and asked if we could sit and have our meal there, the bartender rudely replied that we could but the service would be extremely slow, then walked away.  We sat there for about 15 minutes while she did dishes and prepared 3 drinks before she bothered giving us a menu.  We decided to wait for a table instead. It took 30 minutes before our server came over to take our order.  We watched other tables being sat and orders taken while we sat and watched our server chat it up with the rest of his section. FINALLY I ordered the $40 Filet and a 12$ ceasar salad (it wasn't good at all) that was to be \"prepared table side\".  Someone from the back just came and dropped it off at the table.  I asked later why everyone else that ordered it had it prepared in front of them and I didn't. He said only at tables that order 2 or more salads.  Even though I watched the woman at the table next to mine order 1 salad for her table and get it prepared table side. We were younger than most of the crowd in there, but definitely were there to spend money. Hands down the worst service I've ever had.",

    "text": "We've been wanting to go to the Golden Steer for so long due to the history and what we had heard about the food.  The ambiance is awesome, even though they pack people into the same corner until it's completely full when the other side of the room is empty.  Don't understand that concept, but server Mike was great, along with his crew.  He was on top of our needs throughout the evening.  There was a 3 combo appetizer special, both in hot and cold versions.  We got the hot version with calamari, ravioli and stuffed mushroom.  We had forgotten about all the bad reviews on the mushrooms.  Needless to say, the other reviews are accurate.  The mushrooms were awful and cold.  In fact, none of the appetizer plates were real hot.  The calamari and ravioli are mediocre at best and the ravioli is breaded a fried (didn't expect that and it was not good).  The term I used throughout the evening was \"ordinary\".  We also ordered the Caesar Salad, sans anchovy paste, and it was cool having it made at your table.  Taste was what you would expect, but for the price, I would have at least expected the large pieces of cheese you get on nice salads and perhaps homemade croutons...instead we had shaker cheese and croutons out of a bag.  Nothing to write home about with the salad.  For dinner, my husband ordered the Veal Parmigiana.  After the first bite, I could tell it was awful...he was not impressed and was real disappointed since we expected to have a really good dinner.  I ordered the bone-in ribeye, as it's a specialty there....and it was very good and cooked to a perfect medium-rare.  They can do steaks just fine.  For the sides, we ordered the mashed potatoes and broccoli.  The broccoli was barely cooked, so very crunchy and had absolutely nothing on it; no olive oil, butter...nothing.  Couldn't eat it so packed it to take home and steam myself with some olive oil.  The mashed potatoes were ok, but nothing stellar.  I could eat those, but took most of it home.  Finally, for dessert, I ordered bananas foster for one.  It's cool they make it table side with the fire show and it was really good.  Glad there was a good dessert after a mostly disappointing meal.  Tab was around $225...and definitely not worth it.  We won't have dinner there again, but are glad we went and now finally know!  Way too much $$ for mediocre (at best) food.",

    "text": "For a place that bandies about the \"Rat Pack\" as being former patrons, I expected a bit more.  The decor is definitely what you'd expect from a \"steak and martinis\" type of establishment.  However, it's located in a run-down strip mall and we found the dining room virtually empty at 9:00 on a Thursday night.  This gave the place feel more like a seedy airport lounge than somewhere I would have found Frank Sinatra or Dean Martin.  As for the food, the pride that this restaurant has in its steaks is not misplaced.  The beef is really good, if overpriced.  The 14 oz. New York Strip that I had was a whopping $40.  Even the chicken entrees were $27-28.  I know it's expensive to eat in Vegas; but this seemed excessive.  Mind you, this is coming from someone who dines out regularly in San Francisco.  Anyway, the beef was the only thing that impressed.  The salad looked like it was from a bag and the sides of mashed potatoes and creamed spinach were nothing short of baby food.  The mixed seafood platter that we started with was stocked with king crab that was still frozen and cocktail sauce that could have come from Red Lobster.  The service was very attentive and our server was quite personable.  He even comped a couple of desserts when he found out we had some birthdays at the table.  If you're a carnivore with a fat wallet and little love for ambiance, then this place is for you.  As for me, I don't think I'll be coming back the next time I'm in Vegas.",

    "text": "If dinning out is about the experience then our evening was about learning to cope with disappointment.  And I have to tell you, no one was more disappointed than our waiter at having us for guests.    It started with the very obvious disdain most waiters have for us when we send a wine list away.  My personal feeling is they think because we're young and we're not ordering wine we're going to be cheap.  That's neither here nor there, but it's a common theme in higher end restaurants that we run into, and it was no different here.    I ordered a cocktail, and my father ordered a beer, and then we found that we had a seesaw for a table.  I tried to stop the waiter but he seemed really busy trying to work out in his head the minimum number of times he needed to stop at our table and still make a decent tip.    When it came time to order we asked if there were any specials or recommendations and we were told that everything was special.  Super helpful bro, especially when I was trying to wrangle two other indecisive orderers.  Our order failed to impress our waiter though as got bored  about halfway through it and started looking at the wall to see if there was any way it was more interesting than us.  It must have been, but he showed real grit when he forced his glance back to our table to take down the rest or our order.    Our premade salad came out to the table right around the same time as cart was rolling up to the table next to us.  They do table side Caesar salad prep?  Who knew?  I would consider that something special to recommend to a customer, but I guess we just weren't good enough for him to tell us about it.    The escargot was poorly done, with a mystery spice ruining what should be a very simple dish.  We think it was coriander.    We then fought with the server bringing our main course out for table space and no one seemed to want to come and clear off any plates on our table.  We resorted to busing the table ourselves and leaving a neat stack of plates on the edge of the table.  We would have asked our waiter, but again, he was probably in the back lamenting to the chefs about what a terrible table he had.   When the stakes came out we forgot momentarily about dirty seats, the leaning tower of plates and the see-saw table because these stakes were phenomenal. Well portioned, well seasoned and cooked.  We almost didn't care the broccoli came out cold because we were too enamored with our stakes.    My wife and dad had a filet, and I had the rib-eye.  It really was the saving grace the experience.    Gluttons for punishment, or maybe like a 10 year old son trying to earn his fathers approval, we stayed for coffee and dessert.  We had the Bananas Foster and Cheesecake with fireworks on it since we were celebrating my dads birthday.  The Bananas are served table-side with ice cream and are very good, the cheesecake is cheesecake, and the coffee was coffee.    All kidding aside though, when bills start to get up in the $100 per person range there is a level of service that is expected, and we did not receive anything close to that level of service.  I've had better service at an Outback and I hope this was just a one off, but it's disappointing when a poor experience detracts from an otherwise good meal.",

It has that old school vegas feel without looking tacky or cheap.  The host greeted us right away, and although they were booked, the bar area with tables was open seating.  We had the french onion soup and oysters for an appetizer.  The soup was delicious.  Great flavor.  The oysters were a bit small, but fresh and tasty.  For dinner I had the Porterhouse and the twice baked potato and the Prime Rib with creamed spinach.  Both pieces of meat were cooked perfect; however they had no flavor.  They were good cuts of beef, but very bland.  I doubt they were even salt or peppered before they were cooked.  The au jus for the prime rib was also flavorless.  It was like brown water.  The beed was very disappointing.  The twice baked potato was delicious.  The creamed spinach was a touch watery, but had good flavor.  Being that it was my first time here, I was not all that impressed by the food.  I would try it again, but it may be a while.",

This was one of the few places that Sammy Davis was allowed to dine at. Being a black man in Vegas during that time period was hard even for a star such as him. So he ate here and then the rest of the Rat Pack joined him. Though time has moved on, its still has the same charm and service as it did back then. It's great for a romantic night on the town or dinner with a few friends. It's hard to find this type of place in a forever changing place such as Vegas. But here it is. Besides the food is great and service is out of this world. I hope you will go and try it out for yourself. Trust me, you'll be glad you did. Be sure to ask for Franks booth. The server will fill in you in with the history that took place there. Thanks",

    "text": "This place is extremely overpriced and over rated. There were 5 in our party. We ordered stuffed mushrooms and the contents of the mushroom tasted fine, but the mushrooms were not cooked. They were hard and white (which equated to uncooked/raw). And they were sitting in a clear liquid that looked and tasted like water. It definitely was not butter. Very disappointing for $14. Three of us had the ribeye ($54 each) and they lacked flavor/seasoning and they were so tough to cut through that we thought our knives were dull. But the knives were fine. The steaks were just a very poor quality. And I know steaks. The prime cut steaks I get from Costco for $19 per pound put this place's steaks to shame.  We had a side of broccoli and it was nearly raw. Not steamed, as the menu stated. Another person in our party had grilled chicken, which was very salty, but juicy. And the other person had the filet mignon, which was the only steak that tasted good and was tender, as a filet should be. But definitely not worth $48. Ruth Chris's steak are a lot better and a little less in price.  Our bill was $318 and we only had two drinks (lemon drops) and no dessert. We will never recommend this place to anyone and we will never return. We all feel completely ripped off.   Update on September 18:  The only reason my husband and I returned to the Golden Steer on September 16, 2017 is because the general manager gave us a $100 gift card when we complained about poor steaks during our visit in April (see post above).  We were hoping that the steaks would be perfect this time around. But nope!  They were terrible. Nothing that anyone should ever expect from a prime steakhouse. I had the ribeye again and it was tough, with fat that was chewy and rubbery. There was zero flavor to the steak. I had to ask for butter to put on it and then I added lots of salt. I asked for medium rare plus and I got medium to almost done. My husband had the filet and asked for medium. His came out medium rare and as he got to the center, it became more rare. He had to heavily salt his to have flavor. In my opinion, they need a new chef, a new grill (so the steaks cook evenly), and they actually need to serve prime cut steaks (as they claim they do). I can tell you that they are not serving prime cut steaks. And if they are, then they need a new supplier.  Do not visit the Golden Steer for a great steak, because you will be disappointed and feel like you wasted your money.",

    "text": "Pros: Amazing ambience, definitely old school Vegas steakhouse, food was to perfection! Music brought me back home, my father loves Sinatra! 4 Stars.  Cons: We were greeted by the host who was blowing her nose, handed us the menus and walked us to our table - um I should have asked for her to sanitize her hands before handing us the menu cause that was a bit disgusting. Don't get me wrong she was great, very personable but we had our little ones with us (a toddler and a 6 month old - imagine the horror). Now the server, he informed us the specials etc, he was good up to but when my husband ordered for some soda, he seemed disappointed, mind you we had already ordered wine, he just likes soda - server didn't even said anything just walked away, not a \"I'll be right back or anything\" smh we both looked at each other stunned with the attitude?!? So if you're wondering why the tip was only 18% - here's why. We did notice he was and had an attitude with the couple next to us (I think she had too much to drink and was getting a little loud but don't roll your eyes where other guests can see you). -1  There's was another server but he was great! And the Caesar salad maker was pretty awesome too!  I will def be back!",

    "text": "OK so DON'T go here... it's that easy!!! There were so many things wrong with my dining experience it's hard to even figure out where to begin!  1) SERVICE-- I went on a Sunday evening and sat at the bar so I could watch football. The poor bartender does everything here.  She had 9 people at the bar, was cleaning glasses, answering the phone,getting our food  AND she has to make all the drinks for the waiters. And when I say ALL the drinks, they come up to her for a COKE, they don't even have a fountain drink machine for the waiters to do it themselves.  Needless to say, it took her a while to get my food ordered. There also was a group of 3 guys that sat next to me that were ordering food and playing video poker too [hold that thought].  2) DRINKS--They have video poker at the bar. Fine by me. THEY DON'T COMP your DRINKS at the bar. Unheard of in Vegas. I lost $40 bucks and still paid FULL price for my 2 glasses of wine.  3) FOOD--Bread? They have bread here???? Based on the other reviews apparently they do. We didn't' see any bread at the bar- carb free for us! My meal came out before my salad. Noooo bueno.  Also, about 25 mins after I ordered my meal arrived. WHY so long you ask? Because the bartender has to leave the BAR and go get the food herself. I have never in my life seen a restaurant where the bartender goes and gets her own food.  The reasoning for my salad coming out late, the waiters were getting there before her, and since the Caesars are made to order I lucked out.  Let's talk about the food...I order the combination meal-petite fillet, salad, veggie, & shrimp scampi to the tune of $65.   Outback has better steak then this place. It was really dry [see pix] there wasn't even any juice on the plate. When I think of shrimp scampi-garlic, white wine, shrimp, butter, and parsley comes to mind.  This was NOT that.  It was gelatinous kinda like shark fin soup & the tails were still on the 5 shrimp.  Side of broccoli extremely undercooked. It needed 2 or 3 more minutes in the microwave from where it came from.  Guys next to me started laughing when my food arrived. Then I one upped them told them I bet their apps come out with their food....well I was sort of right. Their food came out, but there were no apps with it. So poor little bartender, now has to leave the bar, for about the 5th time [with 9 people at it PS-it only seats 12] and once again go get our food.   PS- I complained about the order in which the food came out, hostess did come talk to me [she might have been the manager] instead of apologizing, offering me a dessert, taking off a glass of wine, she told the bartender if she starts to get behind let her know and she'll help out.  I mentioned to her too the same thing happened to the guys next to me. She offered no apologies and didn't even go speak with them.  Mind you we are drinking, eating, AND playing at this place.  My meal cost me well over $125 and was worth about $30 in my opinion.  Again STK or Botero are much better options. I also have no idea how anyone else had a GOOD experience here as this might be the worst experience I've had in Vegas and maybe in a restaurant period.",

So I ended up spending 84+35 for the groupon +tip which came out to about $150. Also, remember you're only allowed to use one groupon ticket per party (it's in the fine print) ... Very misleading.",

The stuffed mushrooms and crab on my steak were bland, the steak was good but undercooked (better than over-cooked), not outstanding...and lets face it, for over $100 pp, it should be outstanding.  The service was stuffy the last two times and it was once FUN! One of the most historical places in Vegas and on the first visit they made me feel as if I just missed an old actor or mobster.  I can get stuffy and overpriced all over over Vegas, so after two so-so tries, I'll probably give another place a shot next time.",

I had Chicken of the Angels, and it was VERY salty. It was supposed to be served over mushrooms and artichokes, though my meal had one piece of one artichoke! The side of asparagus were ordered to shared was ice cold - and barely enough for one person.  One person in my party ordered a steak medium (pink) and it was definitely well done. The baked potato was huge, and ice cold on the inside but steaming on the outside.  At a restaurant like this (and for these prices) I shouldn't have to ask for a wine list, and the server should ask if we want a second round of drinks.  Although this place is \"historic\" I think there are far better restaurants in town.",

    "text": "Spent our anniversary weekend in Vegas with another couple.  Husbands uncle is a local he says you gotta go to the Golden Steer forget about Gordon Ramseys place.  He says you get the same thing for $65 a person so we all gave it a try.    The atmosphere reminds me of an old time piano wine bar from the 70's/80's but a little run down in need of some updating.  Waiter was weird and had an attitude that kept growing throughout the night.  He told us how hed been there quite a long time but had left for a while and come back etc making a point I guess that most of them were there for 20+ years.    We got a bottle of wine and then ordered.  I had the filet which was nicely cooked and the twice cooked potato.  The potato was actually about the worst i have ever had because it was obvious that it had sat in the oven either all day or for hours.  It was completely burnt on the bottom but not in a good way.  You know how you can totally overdo a potato skin to complete crispy browness that its cracking apart but it still tastes good?  Ya well not like that this was BURNT.  Could not cut it with a fork burnt.  Had to use a steak knife to get through it sooo cuz our waiter was weird with attitude I wasnt going to say anything about my $10 potato.    The waiter came back at least 5 times aggressively asking if we wanted another bottle of wine.  It started to feel like it was a demand rather than a request which we all noticed.  At the end we all got dinner drinks/coffee and dessert.  The drinks came out right away and we had a nice conversation while we waited for dessert.  The restaurant only had 3 tables and I noticed 2 waiters and a couple bussers as well as the guy doing the salads and desserts so when we finished the drinks we asked where dessert was.  We were hoping to have it with the drinks but  its like 30 minutes or more later and the waiters response was really snotty that they only had one of those dessert trays and the guy was going to get to us.  We were there at 7 pm and the only people on dessert at the time.    We didnt understand the really negative reaction we were getting so we were doing our best to be respectful responding with yes sir etc.  Its almost as if he mistook our kindness for weakness which seems to be happening a whole lot these days when you go out.  So I watched the dessert guy make our dessert and I noticed he was making cherries jubilee instead of the bananas foster we ordered so I said something about it in a very nice way LOL that doesnt seem to matter.  The response was almost like are you effing kidding me?  This bitch makes a mistake I gotta fix?  He didnt say that but his body language sure did.  The dessert guy went away the waiter comes back with more attitude and do you want another bottle of wine again.  He seemed pissed at us that the guy was making cherries and that we didnt want that as well.    They finally made it right and I tasted one bite and not good.  We make it better at home.  Everyone at table agreed we make it better so good thing I got the tiramisu because that was pretty good.  This is the important part.  I would never have bothered writing any of this until this part happened!  The waiter brings the bill and most of the time my husband just takes care of it but this time I had a funny feeling about the waiter so I looked at it and thank the lord I did because that dude double charged us and charged us extra for stuff that already came with etc. For instance my husband ordered asparagus with Hollandaise sauce $11.  The waiter charged us for 2 of those $22 + Hollandaise sauce $5x 2 = $10 so his asparagus was $32.  When we pointed out the errors to the waiter he seemed intensely aggravated.  He responded very quickly like he was expecting it.  I bet he was.  I bet they do that all night long.  He said oh when they put it in they must have made a mistake like someone else rang his order in and like it happens and he will have to go straighten \"them\" out.  Bill came back minus $150 but I am positive we still paid too much because that extra sauce crap didnt hit me til we got home that the asparagus already had Hollandaise on it and I just looked it up on the menu to be sure and yep sure enough.    Bottom line:  These people can cook a steak but so can the Keg and Firebirds etc  DO NOT TRUST YOUR WAITER:  Go over your bill  -  They are looking for suckers  Fair restaurant prices on bottles of wine  NONE of us would ever return",

    "text": "It was a long search for the perfect place to celebrate after getting married by Elvis in Vegas but when I finally found the Golden Steer, I knew for sure that I had found the one! Off the strip and standing since 1958, this Vegas institution has served Frank and the Rat Pack, Marilyn, Ali, Joe DiMaggio, Vegas mobsters and the King himself.   We arrived dressed to the nines, him in his wedding suit and me in a white dress and fur. We were seated in a corner booth done in red tufted leather with a plaque that said \"Betty Grable.\" Betty Grable was a World War II pinup star and actress who frequented the Golden Steer with her husband, band leader and trumpeter Harry James. Apparently they rarely spoke to each other on those visits - hopefully that doesn't jinx me and my husband lol!    Our server was of the typical old time steakhouse variety - a bit gruff but accommodating. We ordered a nice bottle of Shiraz, Caesar salad for two, two filet mignons and some creamed spinach. The tableside preparation of the Caesar salad takes you back in time and tastes pretty darn delicious. The filet mignons were superb (though I should've taken the ladylike route and ordered the petite filet which would have been plenty filling at 8 oz, but my eyes are always hungrier than my stomach!). We were planning on ordering one of those spectacular flambe desserts but the Golden Steer had other plans for us. The waiters came over with a slice of cake lit with a sparkler singing \"Happy wedding to you\", which was just the sweetest (cake was delicious, too!). It was definitely the perfect way to celebrate our special day, and we would love to come back someday to celebrate our anniversary and look back on the wonderful time we had! (Hopefully we'll have a large enough party to snag the King's booth next time )",

For it supposedly being 22 oz it barely filled the plate. You can get the same cut at Austin's Steakhouse in the Texas, have it be bigger, with a free sauce, and all for 10 bucks cheaper. I asked for it to be medium and it was cooked perfectly. It was also very juicy. It didn't have a lot of flavor though.  I originally wanted to order the onion rings on the menu, but the waiter let me know they were frozen and come from a box, so I just settled on the fries.The fries I got were non-crisp, starchy, non-seasoned, too thick potato spears. No salt or flavored oil or butter coating them. I had to send the over-baked, no-flavor garlic bread away. They didn't want to make the tableside caesar salad fresh at first until I asked them to. When they did make it tableside, it ended up being the most flavorful thing of my meal. The bananas fosters I got was decent, it didn't have a real good sauce though, it tasted mostly of orange. It wasn't bad, but you think of rum, brown sugar, and banana when it comes to bananas foster, not orange.  The staff was nice and accommodating. They amptly took the bread off my bill when I said I didn't like it. Another waiter quickly made sure I got my tableside salad. My drink always stayed filled and I was always checked up on.  This place seems to be living through it's glory days instead of keeping their menu up to date and competitive. For the quality of food, they are seriously over charging. Unless they put up another groupon, I won't be coming here again.",

There are definitely swankier, trendier places to get a steak in Vegas, but I'm not sure there's a better atmosphere and food quality than the Golden Steer. We had a party of five and every person in the group agreed it was on par with the best steak they'd ever had.   The only downside is the restaurant is slightly off that strip and in kind of a sketchy area (tourist opinion). The outward appearance had us very concerned until we got inside.   We will be back.",

In a flour tortilla.... As I sit here full and happy, I feel compelled to write a review and share my experience. My fiance and I had the escargot, Cesar salad, bone-in rib eye, petit filet mignon, cream corn, and whipped potatoes. I noticed a few complaints about the a la carte entrees. This place is a  traditional steakhouse and that's the style! I'm THRILLED to see this type of place still around in Las Vegas. There aren't enough of them quite frankly. They make the salad dressing table side as well as the banana flambe!! Highly recommend both and the escargot was sooooo delicious. The cream corn is OUT OF THIS WORLD!!!!! I'm usually not a sweets fan but I loved this dish.   Scot and a few others whose names I, regretfully, didn't get, were just so accommodating. They told us the history of the place and provided a very fun experience. We had been looking for a spot in Vegas since we just moved here late last year. This is now our favorite restaurant and I can't wait to go back!",

However, the service wasn't what you would expect from a restaurant like this. We were never offered refills and they watched like hawks to take our plates as soon as they thought we might be finished. I expected more from this place as far as service.  Even without the great service, they offer a vintage Vegas feel that is getting harder to find! I would recommend this restaurant to someone looking for a piece of Vegas history, not necessarily looking for a nice dinner with a good steak.",

Immediately was impressed with the vibe of the place. Great looking bar, lots of dark wood and comfortable chairs. We all sat around in the bar waiting for the rest of our group. As we all arrived and were seated, the wait staff and manager made sure nothing was missed. No point in detailing the steaks, all the reviews were right, food is awesome. Service for us was perfect. We will be returning here often for all of the above reasons. Also, I have bought many large dinners in high-end Las Vegas Steakhouses. But this was the first time I got out for less than $900 for 10 adults. Yes I dig this place.",

The classy, vintage decor, rat pack feel, white table cloths, excellent customer service and melt-in-your mouth dishes make this place so special. All of the front of the house staff are excellent. Our waiter, Carl, was especially outstanding. He's one of the sommeliers and found the perfect pairing for our Steak Oscar. He created the Caesar salad table-side (which was a treat just watching him) with just the right amount of lemon, Parmesan cheese and anchovies. I wish I could have eaten more of everything. My tastebuds were disappointed when my stomach ran out of room because there were so many wonderful bites left on the plate.

Everything was under seasoned, over priced, and no one seemed happy to be there. $300 for a meal I've made better at home (for 2 people btw). They didn't  cook my lobster properly. It was tough and chewy and when I sent it back they proceeded to argue that the middle was raw (not sure if that was supposed to be comforting) even though it was so overcooked on the outside I had to saw at it with a steak knife. They just assumed I wanted another one cooked (although I didn't) and the second one they brought out was barely passable. My cocktail was average and the bread was average. The $12 per person table side Cesar salad was below average and they even served people who were seated after us before us.   There were no specials and the server was totally unhelpful despite the fact we mentioned we had never dined there and we're excited to finally be able to. They even cleared a plate that I was eating from without asking.  There was one thing that was good (crab cocktail) and it was the only reason I didn't give this place a 1 star review. I would never recommend this place to anyone. The servers look down on the clientele and they are pretty much absent if you need anything from them.",

With that out of the way. Service is top notch, they go out of their way for you. As an appetizer we ordered oyster Rockefeller. I am not a big fan of seafood, and these were delicious. Table service included a salad. I ordered a green salad with a Roquefort dressing. The dressing was bit on the light side, I would of preferred a bit more Roquefort cheese. It is a stronger cheese, so I can see better to err on the lighter than too much. I ordered the petite-est cut-English cut of prime rib with a twice baked potato.  The cut of beef was very generous, juicy and fairly tender, it is closer to a diamond cut in size. The cut is paired with a creamed horseradish. This sauce is served unmixed and is on the strong side. This can not play well with their beef as it is lighter tasting if you get it too strong. There options for a side, I chose the twice baked potato is hits all the points and is generous sized. In the end its a great place that you pay a premium for ambiance and the history, but it kind of balances out with the great food and service. A definite recommendation for special events and celebrations.",

My petit filet was cooked perfectly and my vodka tonic was just right (refilled at the right time too!). I will say that the salad was not very good - so I would either skip it or try the table side ceaser salad (maybe next time)....  It looks funny from the outside, but has cool history inside (this is where the Rat Pack dined - can't get any cooler than that :)  I love the dim lighting - perfect for a nice dinner.

From there, we had appetizers, more drinks, and our entrees.  After ordering beer and blood marys, we had oysters rockefeller, clams casino, veal marsala, twice baked potatoes, lyonnaise potatoes, toasted raviolis (which were a bonus as we didn't order them), and creamed corn.  I swear I could have stayed for 2 days!  I mentioned that I had a Groupon and not an eyelash was batted.  They retrieved it from my phone and we moved on without missing a beat.  Every single staff member was impeccably dressed, courteous, and accommodating.  I really did feel like I was \"Rat Pack\" worthy, all the way down the music being played.  We finished dinner and still managed to have enough leftovers to fill a bag. (We don't eat a lot but like to try a lot of different things.)  After paying the check and leaving the restaurant, we were called back by a staff member.  It seems Groupon automatically adds the gratuity and I had added another on top.  I find it refreshing and ethical that they would hurry out to find us to let me alter the total.  We have definitely added a new \"regular\" place to vist on every trip. I can't believe I didn't know about them before, but believe you me, I'll never forget them!!  Next time I'm asking for Sheckie Greene's table so my butt can sit in the same grooves as his!",

Met at the bar brought to our table, forgot to give menus which was not so terrible. Took another 30 minutes if not more before a waiter decided to come over. My glass of water was not replenished once throughout the meal. The waiter put on his best de Niro game face and tried to make light of the situation. But when diners are spending the kind of money we spent or would have spent more the service should have been top notch instead we were treated like this was steak and ale. Will not be back.",

We started with the table side Caesar Salad...by the way EVERYONE should make a tableside Caesar! But the person making it had NO personality....my husband even tried to joke around with him and he wouldn't crack a smile....tableside is about a show and we got no show....we barely got a hello. Our steaks were AMAZING I had a petite filet and it was cooked perfectly as our side were great too!  Dessert...of course we had the tableside bananas foster...again...same dry tableside waiter....and the desert was just ok...wasn't the best bananas foster I had (I suggest stop using banana liqueur as you don't need a fake banana flavor and Bacardi 151 and use a brandy.....as it doesn't burn as fast and lets the bananas caramelize more without burning...and yes we make this dessert in our house frequently) I'd like to go back and have a different waiter...maybe I can upgrade to a 5 star review...as the food was certainly deserving of it.",

The service was exceptional, the food was prepared and presented beautifully and the drinks were made properly.   We had Escargot, perfectly prepared. Jumbo and I mean jumbo shrimp cocktail and seafood stuffed mushrooms to start.  All perfectly prepared.  Caesar's salad was crisp and well presented. All the steaks were cooked to perfection and extremely tender with aged flavor.  The side dished were tasty and all the food was at the proper temperature.  Almost ate too much bread it was so good.  This was our 3th time here and will return. Always consistent with service and food. As you drive up its a little questionable with parking but don't lit that scare you away. Step back in time and enjoy this place!",

Our server was on top of it, and it seemed like there was an entire crew assembled to take care of us.  We even chatted with the nice lady in the front after dinner for a bit and enjoyed her telling us about the history. We loved the charm of the \"Old Vegas\" decor, and it is truly authentic as they've been in business since 1958.  My New York Steak was incredibly flavorful, and it was the meat and the juices you tasted, not a bunch of spice you didn't expect.  Twice baked potatoes tasted like a guilty pleasure and I tried my wife's desert (chocolate creme brulee) and it was out of this world.  I find it hard to believe that you could have a bad experience here unless you're looking for a bad experience, then you'll find it even in the best of places.",

The first time we came here we were mislead by a guidebook saying this place was tacky and not great but was frequented by the likes of Elvis, John Wayne, Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr and on and on. We pictured a diner that served diner type flat top fried steaks. When we walked in with t-shirts and jeans only to be greeted by a man in a tuxedo we knew we couldn't have been more wrong. They treated us great, so great we didn't even care the bill was over $200 for just the 2 of us. This was like stepping back into classy pre-strip Vegas, maybe that's why people aren't impressed.......",

Everyone else seemed to enjoy their flesh, so no complaints there.   The wait staff and hostess were so friendly!

Quality of the cocktails was excellent. The waiter engaged in friendly conversation.  The food was great. Our party of 7 covered quite a bit of ground for appetizers, soups, salads, entrees, sides and desserts. The steaks were very good - though not above what I've had at other places. All 7 of us enjoyed the experience. It was a nice \"old Vegas\" atmosphere.    We ended with a couple orders of bananas Foster which we passed around. Highly recommended for the table-side preparation and the quality of the dessert (it was really good).",

    "text": "I can probably best sum my opinion of this place up by saying that I could see this restaurant on Restaurant Impossible.  I won't dwell on the service, about which many have commented (which I could actually deal with if the food were good).  I'll start with the fact that none of the wine glasses set up at our table looked clean (all had some white-ish film and mine had a little extra something on it).  That's not acceptable at the prices they charge.  The real problem is the food.  We ordered chopped green salads that were something that looked like a 7-year old could make.  The toasted ravioli may daughters ordered looked and tasted like something you can try in the aisles of Costco on Saturday morning.  The quality of our steaks wasn't bad, but they weren't very juicy.  Of the 4 steaks we ordered, only one was cooked to the medium-rare that we asked for.  The others were medium to medium-well.  I ordered steak fries that were actually seasoned well, but were undercooked and looked like slightly higher quality than something you'd find in an elementary school lunch.  We ordered bananas foster (table-side service) for dessert.  it was kind of a fun process watching it flame up.  Taste-wise, it was just a sugar-bomb with only half a banana in it.  I'll sum up with 3 notes.  1.  I went here on the recommendation of my best friend, who is a certified foodie.  However, my wife reminded me after our beyond-disappointing-for-the-price meal that my friend is Hindu and generally doesn't eat beef (so maybe he doesn't know it when beef isn't great?).  2.  My wife said the best dish was the broccoli (which was a single steamed, unseasoned crown).  To be fair, my wife really liked her apple-tini.  3.  My daughters' comment after dinner:  \"The water was nice and cold.\"  If people like the historical significance of this place, maybe it should be converted into a museum.",

    "text": "I come from a fine dining background, and was very excited to try this place after reading the reviews.    we arrived and were promptly shown to our table.  our host was very friendly and told us a lot about the place.  who had ate there over the years, some of the darker history, ect.  a very nice start.  then we were presented with our menus....and he left with out explaining any of it.  i didn't need a 20min speal, but hearing a bit about different dishes would have been nice.  so he comes back 10 min later to take our order, we order escargot, cesar salad, prime rib and filet mignon.  he asks us if we would like any wine with dinner, and then there is a awkward moment of silence when he notices that we don't have a wine list.  he apologizes and returns with one.  not a big deal, i select a bottle  of champagne , and it is promptly brought out.  our first course arrives shortly there after, the escargot.  it comes old school style, in a dish with the little depressions for the escargot with melted butter, garlic and herbs.  the problem is that we were missing one.  it just wasn't in the dish. it vanished somewhere.  how it left the kitchen, went through our server and the captain who was serving us at the time, i do not know.  they made us another order and once again apologized.    while this was going on, my wine glass was empty.  not just for a second.  it was empty from before our first order was served till we got the second order, around 10 min.  during this time, we had our bread filled, and our water filled by 2 different busboys, and the our server and the host stopped by, none of the noticed.  not the biggest deal in the world, but another small thing that is starting to add up.  they also did not crumb our table, which after 2 orders of escargot, was looking bad.  next up is our cesar salad.  they do it table side, with a bit of flair and some jokes, it was very well done, and one of the better salads i have had in a wile.  no problems here, it was close to flawless.  they came to clear our dishes, and once again do not crumb our table.  i also finished poring out the champagne, as we were going to get a good bottle of red with the steaks.  they did not pour for us 1 time, or notice that the bottle was empty.  on to the main course.  steak is steak right?  sadly, not so.  they used no seasoning at all on our steaks.  both were very large cuts, and looked great, but had no seasoning at all, none.  i know its all personal taste, but i was again let down.  also,  with no red wine, the steak just lacked something.  sure i could have ordered a bottle, but no one came to check on us till we were mostly finished, and i didn't want to get up to chase someone down to order one.   they cleared our plates, but once again did not crumb the table.  we were ready to get out of there, just done and a bit sad overall, when they presented us with a desert menu.  table side bananas foster.  that has to be my favorite desert of all time, and i decide to give it a shot.    our host comes out and does a wonderful job of preparing it, and it looks and smells wonderful.  and it tastes pretty good too.  i was starting to enjoy it, when i found a huge ice chunk in my ice cream.  also they really need to switch to a better ice cream, it was not very good quality.  our bill came, but there were still desert dishes on the table, and crumbs everywhere.  not fine dining.   we paid it, and had to ask them to call us a cab.  not a huge thing once again, but everywhere else in vegas offers to do it for you.  all through out dinner, our host was very personable and funny.  they employees were funny and you could tell they enjoyed what they did.  as for the old school feel, it was wonderful.  as for the fine dining, they missed several points, and the food was average at best other than the salad.  my advice would be that if you don't mind spending a lot of money to experience a really good atmosphere with average food, you should check this out.  if you are only going to do one big dinner in Vegas though, you should check out something else.",

    "text": "I took my Dad here for his birthday. He was completely indifferent on where he wanted to go for his birthday, and we both love steak. I figured this place was historic in this town, so it'd be cool to say I have eaten here. Also, I had a living social deal that was soon to expire. For all those reasons, it just made sense to try it. The hostess was extremely friendly. She kinda set the tone for what should have been an excellent experience. The ambiance was also pretty sweet. It was exactly what you'd expect after hearing that this place has been around for a while, and the old time Vegas elites used to eat here.   After those two huge pluses, the main drawback was the servers. The servers here are absolutely terrible. No personality whatsoever, no customer service, inattentive, and even molasses would get infuriated with impatience waiting for service. It was a perfect storm of what makes someone a shitty waiter. After your waiter takes your order, you might as well say goodbye because that's the last time you're gonna see him. Someone else brings your food, which in and of itself isn't really a big deal. Your food even arrives in a timely manner. But your waiter won't be back again for anything. Want a refill on your soda? Nope. Apparently, you aren't good enough for refills on your sodas here. At other restaurants the waiter makes sure everything is good with your order, not here. No, at Golden Steer, you're on your own to track a busboy down with any requests or issues you may have. Then you need to cross your fingers and hope for the best. They do however, keep up on your water glass. So you aren't gonna die of dehydration at least. Upon looking around the sea of seemingly disheartened geriatrics eating their meals all around us, I assumed that all those people came into the establishment as bright eyed, young go getters. Then they aged horribly waiting for their check to arrive, while simultaneously losing all the hope they once had in this world. I was convinced I was going to suffer the same fate. I even managed to flag down our waiter and gave him my living social voucher after we were done eating, only to have a completely unrelated waiter bring me my bill without any discount showing on it (for what felt like at least a half hour later). I think they were trying some kind of strange, crafty server scheme. Maybe they would take the $50 off the bill afterwards and split it. Who knows, maybe they just get easily confused when they each have a whopping three tables to attend to.   That whole terrible waiter experience completely took away any of the old school charm the place could have had, it also didn't represent the price they charge for their food (around $100 for two people without any discount). I have no problem paying for a great meal with great service, but this place left much to be desired. It seems awful that the one thing getting the least amount of attention in my review is the actual food itself, which was actually pretty decent. You can do a lot better for your money though. I would take the Palm steakhouse at Caesar's over this place any day of the week. Much much better service, and better food on top of it. I believe the pricing is even a little better there. I was gonna give this place three stars, but when I read the summary of a two star review, it summed it up perfectly. \"Meh. I've experienced better.\" ... Cue \"That's what she said\" in 3...2...1..",

    "text": "I admit it, I was being petty AF. We had family in town and decided to meet here for dinner. This place sounded cool, being \"the oldest\" steakhouse in Las Vegas. Been living here for 7 years now and I have sadly seen many places come and go after being in business for only a short time. Golden Steer is located in a sketchy strip mall right next to the new Lucky Dragon Hotel. I really had my doubts about this place, but don't let the surroundings fool you!  The ambience was cool and it takes you back in time with their dim lighting, as well as pictures of legends like John Wayne and Marilyn Monroe on the walls. As recommended, we started off with the table side Caesar Salad. It was fun watching the server make it. Usually Caesar dressing is creamy, but this one was unique and tasted great too. I had the 8oz Petite Filet Mignon, which was cooked to perfection! Didn't have any fork and knife struggles because this steak was so easy to cut and full of flavor. All of us enjoyed the delicious food! We also ordered a side of Whipped Potatoes which were tasty, but nothing special. If you are planning to order dessert, stay away from the Creme Brulee. I'm no expert, but some restaurants are horrible with Creme Brulees. Don't waste your money on them here! Some in our party had the table side Bananas Foster. Watching them make it was very entertaining with the flames and all. I was told that it was good, but a little too sweet and they went kind of crazy with the rum.   Great service! The servers worked as a team and were very attentive with refilling drinks, taking plates away and constantly asking how the food was tasting. Definitely wouldn't mind coming back here again!",

The table side Ceasar salad was good but overhyped on the menu.  I have had much better in my days.   The T-bone steak was well prepared but under seasoned.   The Rib-eye steak was much better but again, a bit under seasoned.   The sides were a bit of a disappointment.  The twice baked potatoes were cool (almost cold) and nothing to write home about.  The broccoli was just three huge sprigs of steamed greenness.  They should have cut it down a bit and added an accompaniment or a sauce.  It was just sad vegetable on a plate.    We skipped dessert mostly due to lack of interest.   The meal was not terrible but it was not exciting at all.  Steakhouses should be a guilty pleasure, feel naughty and decedent.  This just was a steak with some sides.   There are much more inspiring steakhouses in Vegas at this quality point.  I am glad I went there as it was in my to-do list.

The steaks were delicious, service was awesome!  They also made a delicious cosmopolitan!!!  Make sure to order the Bananas Foster for dessert!  I am so happy that we selected this restaurant for dinner after our wedding.  It provided a great memory for us!",

We shared a shrimp cocktail and had cheesecake for dessert. Our servers Carl and Johnathan were so attentive and welcoming. If you're coming for a date night o  the weekend, i recommend before 7pm.

The only thing holding any stars at all was the ambiance and history. I'd just wished the food held up. And I can get both the ambiance and the food quality at THE steakhouse at circus circus. And I can guarantee that the Rat Pack would have been eating there if it were an option. Golden Steer was a sub par steak comparatively speaking and much more expensive! The Steakhouse at Circus Circus has much higher quality beef, is cooked on an open charcoal flame (you can watch them cook your food), and the price includes a soup or salad, a potato dish and a vegetable. Golden Steer (like many others) serves sides alecart. So for me, the best bang for the buck remains elsewhere. Unfortunately one and done.",

It's not located in the best area but who cares about that, we're talking about the food and the history of this place. When we arrived we had to wait a few minutes as they were just waiting to clean a table. No biggie, we just sat in the lounge and I enjoyed myself a glass of wine as we waited. Shortly after we were called and seated in a nice booth, it was Terry Fators booth. Wish we were seated in Sammy Davis Jr's or Frank Sinatra's but oh well. We were promptly approached by our waiter, I think his name was Anthony. He was great! We ordered the Toasted Ravioli to start, 2 tableside Caesar salads, 2 medium rare 22 oz. Bone in ribeyes and an order of mac & cheese. Toasted ravioli first. Omg these little suckers were so good!! It came with a side of a very thick marinara sauce which we absolutely loved. It had great flavor and they served a good amount of the raviolis. The tableside Caesar salads were cool. The gentleman advised everything he was putting in the dressing; egg yolk, anchovy paste, lemon juice, oil, Tabasco, red wine vinegar, I think I'm missing a thing or two... anyway he served us our salads and it was plentiful. No small portions here. Next up the ribeyes, I was halfway full at this point but I had to keep going. The steaks were perfectly cooked, buttery and had a nice char on the outside. The mac & cheese was velvety and had a bread crumb top which was good. It left me wanting more. My boyfriend finished off his meal with a latte and I had another glass of wine. We really wanted to do the bananas foster but we were just so stuffed there was no way we could enjoy it without feeling sick after. After all that, our bill was $201. Not bad at all for the service and food. They took great care of us and made us feel like royalty. We ended up looking around the place to find all the famous booths. That nostalgia and history alone is worth coming for here. I highly recommend this place to anyone who is looking for that old school Las Vegas feel in a world of boujee hotels and crazy crowds that Vegas has become. We will see you again Golden Steer! Cannot wait to come back!",

Then split an order of escargot which were some of the best I ever had. Super tender. Then had the bone in ribeye with twice baked and creamed spinach. The steak was easily in the top 3 steaks I have had and I've had steak all over the world. The creamed spinach was like a dessert. Left very full and happy. Would love to go here again some time.",

My veal parm was tough and covered in sauce and cheese to help camouflage the over cooked meat. I had to tell the waiter who graciously exchanged it for chicken parm. Two weeks ago my wife had the chicken parm and it was fabulous. Tonight not so. They offered deserts but we were over it. Then later I mentioned to Nickie that we would have desert. 15 minutes later she was running out the door and totally avoided us. How rude. The manager was worthless and took no responsibility for Nickies commitments. Put a really bad taste in my mouth, figuratively and literally. I won't be back. There's plenty of restaurants I can spend $700.00 at. Without attitude. Mike V8",

    "text": "Another steakhouse to add to the list of places I won't return to. If you like dated decor, the place was last remodelled in the '80s, then this is your place. The old boys club decor and service is still in effect here. The food is ok, the prices are high and the service leaves a lot to be desired. After enquiring if the bar had full service dinner menu, I sat down at the bar and ordered a drink and asked for a menu. I then ordered 6 oysters, a caesar salad and an 8 once filet medium rare. At no point did I receive or was asked if I wanted any bread, although others at the bar had received bread. I got the salad first, the dressing definitely had a little too much garlic but otherwise was ok. Then the steak appeared, I asked why  the steak had come before the oysters and the bartender said you didn't get the oysters? I then confirmed this. He asked if I would still like them and I said I wouldn't have ordered them if I didn't want them. He then took the steak back and I received the oysters about 5 minutes later. I had just finished the oysters and my steak reappeared. The steak was slightly overdone but not by much and I enjoyed it. I don't know what others have experienced but when the restaurant screws up by not delivering an appetizer its usually comped, I guess this is something that's not done at the golden steer. All in all it was ok but the lack of service is a little disappointing considering what the prices are. No bread or an offer of bread and forgetting an appetizer without so much an as sorry is unacceptable in my books.",

    "text": "One of the original Steakhouses in Las Vegas, the Golden Steakhouse has been on my \"to try\" list for many years. This weekend we decided to pull the trigger and try this place out, here is my review...  Ambiance - I really felt like we stepped back in time as I really like the old west/Victorian style of the restaurant. It was cool knowing the Rat Pack, Elvis Presley and other Vegas celebs have also dine there made you feel part of something cool, we even saw one of our state Senators. The wait staff were dressed in tuxedo uniforms and kinda really had that old school lounge vibe. The displays and pictures on the wall really sealed the experience.  Food - We all first started out with Caesar salad which was made and plated at table side, do not see a lot of steakhouses do this anymore. We then moved on to our meals, STEAK. Everyone received their cuts cooks as ordered and was really that \"melt in your mouth\" steak. Thou sauces were an option, they were not needed as the flavor of the steak was amazing. Oh yeah they do have chicken and stuff, but WHY?  Service - As expected was great. The wait staff worked well as a team and no one had a empty drink class and it seems the movement of the courses worked. If you read any of my other reviews, one thing I will say is if the cup is empty, there is something wrong.  All in all, no complaints but was happy I made reservations as we had no wait, we went from check in to seating to immediate attention. Therefore I will be back as the staff of the Golden Steer have set the bar pretty high in a town that has more of their fare share of steakhouses.",

It was a treat to see the history surrounding this place.   Service was excellent from the moment we walked in. Everyone greeted us with genuine smiles and warm welcomes. I agree with the reviews that state they make you feel like family. Table service is what they call \"team style\". You may or may not see the same server twice during your dining experience; Carl, our first server (also the one who cashed us out) mentioned this in the beginning. We didn't mind being served team style. Everyone was kind and super accommodating. I almost favor this type of service because there is ALWAYS someone available to help you when you need something. It's never fun to have a hot plate of food in front of you, but you can't delve in because you have no utensils and there are no servers to be found -yikes!   The best part about our dinner here was the food. I started off with the French onion soup - amazing! This was the best I've ever had. If you live French onion soup, don't miss out on this here. I'm salivating right now thinking about how juicy and flavorful my ribeye was. They hit a Homerun with this one. The marbling was just enough to add that extra kick and it was cooked to perfection. This rarely happens. We each ordered the Las Vegas baked potato. It was delicious, but could've easily been shared.   Everything about our dining experience here was nothing short of amazing. I'm just sad that it took us this long to make it. This is definitely one of my Vegas favorites now!  Can't wait to return!",

Naugahyde red upholstered booth, some named after famous regulars and a western decor reflected the glory days of Vegas. Big hair and mustache 'n mullets prevailed.   The Caesar salad prepared table side was perfect. Each piece of lettuce was coated with dressing. Every fork full was delicious.   My friend had the filet and it was well charred and still served medium rare. A side of mac'n cheese brought smiles.   The ribeye was good, not bad, but not great. The bearnaise made it tasty. The cream spinach was a bit too creamy.   Ended the evening with Tiramisu. The bomb!  It's a bit off The Strip near the short lived Lucky Dragon Casino. Worth a visit!",

Ordered medium but 75% steak came medium rare which is good for me but my husband and family members prefer meat cooked longer. Sides were decent. Cream spinach was just ok but asparagus was cooked spot on and one Caesar salad was good to share for two of us. My family enjoyed the twice baked potato. It's shareable as well.   The wait staff is friendly and efficient. Lots of servers truly managing a dining room is something to appreciate. The stars are definitely for top notch service. Hostess managed well. Reservation was for 8:30p. Tables were ready with in a few minutes of reservation time.   They are \"celebrating\" 60 years of being in business and you can see the growth/expansion of the the place as they've bought out the various spaces in the shopping center adding extra dining rooms. The decor is reminiscent of your parents/grandparents house with wood paneling and saloon leather style seats and dusty wall sconces.   The restaurant is not baby friendly. If your kid is potty trained then you're ok but there is no changing table in the ladies room. I had to use my superpowers to change her on my lap inside a bathroom stall.",

I saw this place on groupon and thought to check it out.   I paid on line but I couldn't RSVP until after 9:30 Cool  Finally got in lots of empty tables so no RSVP was even necessary.  That being said.  I ordered water baked loaded potatoe, house salad and (1) lobster tail.   My food took over 30-40 minutes to receive and the lobster tail was tough I too 4 bites and I was done.  Meanwhile the food to so long to receive I ordered shrimp cocktail while waiting its tasted chalky dont know why.   Waited came will the bill it was over $133.00.  I was just 1 person. Really even with groupon discounts I still paid 98 00 and left 15.00 because it's right to tip.      I left message on the website and also called and spoke to them, about reviews it seems no one was was really concerned.   Oh I LEFT MY LEFT OVERS ON THE TABLE I WAS SIMPLY SICK TO MY STOMACH.   call the restaurant back they told me they haven't checked the email for any concerns   No urgency at all for my concerns.   Lol.  Anthony. Please do yourself a favor its not worth the pain for a week over priced meal.   Go to high end buffets and save 100 00.  Itll be worth it I promise you.   Anthony",

    "text": "I had to laugh at the table side Caesar salad. The guy came out with a Caesar salad already made in a bowl, tossed it in front of us, and served. That was it. I was wondering why on earth they were acting like that was special, but noticed we were the exception. Everybody else got the full \"show\" where the salad was actually made in front of them with ingredients added individually. Not sure why they brought it out to us already made, but whatever. Was more funny than anything to us.   Pros: I enjoyed the old school setting. The crab legs were perfect, and petite filet was adequate. Not the best, but good enough. Servers were proficient. Caesar salad was delicious and my partner was happy with their wedge salad. Bananas Foster was on point (and it was made table side for real this time, unlike our Caesar salad ;)  Cons: whipped potatoes and creamed corn were disappointing. Potatoes didn't have much flavor. No gravy or any seasoning for that matter. Corn needed to be softer and my partner was really thrown off by the cinnamon flavor of it.   Overall, it's worth checking this place out! Especially if you like that old school Vegas feel! Is it the best steak house in town? Probably not. But good times were still had.",

    "text": "The Golden Steer was recommended to us by a bartender. Yes it is a classic and we loved the step back in time. The decor must have been very nice in the late 50's early 60's. We were seated at the John Wayne booth. It turns out my 22 year old daughter had no idea who John Wayne was. The service here is on point and these are professional servers. We started with a Cesar salad tossed and dressed table side was classic and very good. We each ordered a medium petite filet mignon at $47 each. It was a perfect medium. Sides are not included. We ordered the Lyonnaise potatoes, $11 and Bearnaise sauce, $4,00. I did not care for the potatoes and the whole time wished I had gone with the standard baked potato with fixings. The potatoes were sliced browned with onions - maybe just too oily for me. To keep the classic old school theme, we ordered cherries jubliee for one. It's $15 per person. One serving was quite a lot. The jubilee was also prepared table side. It was very good and the caramel was yummy.   A couple of disappointments.  All the meat is corn fed. If you are looking for grass fed meat, you won't find it here. But maybe that for the \"new school steak eaters\".  I know Las Vegas tends to be somewhat casual and warm most of the time but I just felt that all the very casually dressed diners in shorts after a day of golf kinda ruins the atmosphere. It seem disrespectful to the vintage and classic feel of the Golden Steer. Thank goodness for the perfectly shaken dry vodka martini to help me not see the shorts, baseball caps and t-shirts.",

    "text": "This venue exactly represents precisely what a Mid-Century upscale steakhouse experience is all about. Hands-down, your best rib eye ... and your best dining-room experience ... in Las Vegas.   At the beginning of the first episode of the second season of \"Mad Men,\" Roger, Don & Betty sip martinis while sitting in their restaurant's cozy, comfy, circular leather banquettes and watching their server construct their Caesar Salads fresh, tableside. You don't see that many places these days, but they still do it old-school here at The Golden Steer. And they will flame up your Cherries Jubilee or Bananas Foster desert tableside as well.   The Golden Steer has stubbornly - and quite wisely - retained virtually every detail of its upscale Mid-Century steakhouse dining experience since it was opened by Joe Kludjian on this very spot back in 1958. Only two restaurants have been continuously in operation longer than The Steer: El Sombrero (the Mexican dive joint downtown) and Bob Taylor's Ranch House (way out northwest near Ann Road). And I mean barely longer. And both, IMHO, are not the same experience as they once were back-in-the-day.   Those retained details include the front bar, as ornate and gorgeous as you'll find anywhere in Vegas. And they also include some of the wait staff, several on call here since the 1970s & 1980s. Indeed, the General Manager started here back in the 1980s, as a kid bussing tables.  The Steer has only changed hands once, when Kludjian sold it to Michael Signorelli in 2001. And it's plain that Signorelli takes pride in having changed almost nothing, in having preserved almost every nuance & tradition that The Golden Steer delivered its guests under Kludjian's reign. In fact, most of these black leather banquettes still bear their original leather.  This restaurant drips decades of history unlike any other dining venue in town (except, perhaps, Piero's). Sammy Davis, Jr. would come by after his shows for an after-hours meal at The Steer, because the hotels he performed in wouldn't let him eat in their restaurants. Sinatra once got drunk at the bar and stumbled through the entire restaurant, serenading every table. One of the famous photographs of Marilyn Monroe is of her and then-husband Joe DiMaggio ... dining in a booth at The Golden Steer.   Since it's Vegas, that means The Steer served not only the famous but the infamous as well. O. J. Simpson dined here the very night he committed his armed robbery at nearby Palace Station. Tony Spilotro (the gangster portrayed by Joe Peche in the movie \"Casino\") and his brother Michael dined at their usual back room table just before they disappeared, found buried in an Indiana cornfield just two days later.  The list of luminaries that have regularly dined at The Golden Steer extends over the decades to the present. But the greatest gift of The Golden Steer is that you too will be served here as though you were just as important as any of them. That is the tradition that steers The Golden Steer.  I've dined here a number of times--their gigantic shrimp cocktail & rib-eye--almost always with a lady friend who deserves the experience; I rely on The Golden Steer and Piero's as my two dining venues to impress. Not one lady friend has been disappointed with a visit to The Steer, given the service is as as tuxedo-ed & polished as it is fawning.   So I am quite sure The Steer will not disappoint you either.",

I would like to state upfront that I loved the 12oz Filet Mignon, Twice Baked Potato, Whipped Potatoes, and \"handmade\" Side Caesar but I give this place a 2 as I did not feel welcomed here at all. Have you ever been somewhere and felt just \"tolerated\"...well as the fellow once said \"ain't that a hole in the boat?\"  My first interaction with the staff at check-in was very cold and off-putting but I paid it no mind because \"OMG DEAN MARTIN ATE HERE\". For starters, we arrived 15 minutes early for our reservation so we were asked to sit in the lounge area, understandable. At that point I felt compelled to order a drink at the bar...BAD IDEA.   I walked to the bar unsure of what cocktail I was in the mood for so I asked the bartender Humberto for suggestions, his attitude towards me was so smug that I walked away in the middle of our exchange. My lady asked \"why didn't you order anything?\" and I stated \"the bartender was a snob\"...keep in mind that the room was completely black...I hugged her and she hugged back. How can someone be an on-shift bartender but then act as if they have something better to do than talk about and make drinks? Ain't that a kick in the head?  We were called to the table about 5 minutes passed our reserved time which was not bad. Overall the food was delicious but I'd never come back which is what I think the Golden Steer wants so \"job well done gang!\"",

Classic Vegas is truly on display at this gem of an institution. Steaks or seafood, you can't go wrong. The bone-in ribeye is my go to, but I have had and would recommend the porterhouse, petite filet and new york strip.   My wife is more of a seafood eater and loves the king crab, lobster, shrimp and scallops. The table side Caesar Salad is the best salad I have ever eaten. All the sides are great, we usually go with the creamed spinach and twice baked potatoes.   They are also known for their tableside Bananas Foster and Cherries Jubilee, but to be honest, I have been too full to even try them.",

However, I went with some customers on Monday night, September 9th and the waiter messed up the order from my colleague. She ordered a petite Filet and then they brought out a 24 oz New York Strip. When she said it was wrong, he argued with us that was what she ordered when everyone at the table said it was wrong. I ordered the Prime Rib and asked for Medium. It came out cold, almost all fat and was rare. The person spinning the salad was gruff and acted put off by having to make our Caesar salad. It was a bad dining experience and I always go there the 8 times a year I'm in Vegas. For our bill of $500.00, you think it would have been a little better than what we were served.",

The ambiance is amazing, the food is amazing!  I had the prime rib, Cesar salad table side, king crab cocktail and sauteed mushrooms.  My husband had the bone in ribeye, macaroni, twice baked potato and oysters Rockefeller. He is not easy to impress and he  was blown away.  The service was spot on, the food amazing I highly recommend this place if you are in Vegas.",

They had a great wine list and the food menu was amazing. The Caesar salad was one of the best I've had and they even make it table side. Their prime rib and filet were both great cuts of meat and was cooked to perfection. Most of the entrees are a la carte so you might want to order a few sides for the table to share. The service itself was something to be desired but the delicious food made up for that shortfall. This steakhouse should be on everyone's list to dine at!",

We started off with the King Crab cocktail and it was very fresh and the cocktail sauce was delicious and then we ordered a ceaser salad which they made at our table which is very cool that you don't see anymore. The salad was pretty good. My gf had the 8oz Filet and I ordered the Bone in Rib eye with a side of Asparagus and Creamed Spinach. Both of our steaks were delicious and the creamed spinach was surprisingly good. I mean it doesnt compare to Peter Lugers creamed spinach from NY but it was good. The asparagus was not good at all. It was just steamed asparagus with no seasoning on it and it was overcooked and very soft, had no snap crunch to it. The waiter gladly took it off of the bill. I know what I'm talking about, I am actually a professional Chef and I own a company out here in Vegas. Overall the experience was a 4 star review only because the Asparagus was boring and overcooked.",

My husband and I both ordered the 8 oz filets, his was the Oscar, with crab and Bernaise sauce. Both steaks were stringy and tough, more like chuck roast than filet and were clearly not tenderloin. I complained to the waiter who offered to bring another steak, which I declined. We were given a free dessert, and I told the waiter I wanted management to know at least 2 customers knew what a filet of beef was supposed to be like. Do not go if you are looking for a good filet.",

The worker thanked my dad for his service and again apologized for their policy.  This rule was not an issue with us.  That is until another man walks in with a hat ON his head.  Upon our exit ANOTHER man had a sombrero on.  I went right up to the same worker and said-- why did you ask my 79 year old father to remove his hat and you let other men wear theirs?? She fumbled on her words and said oh we don't allow hats that look like ball caps.  So military hats are not allowed but the other two ethnic hats are allowed.  Shame on you Golden Steer!! I took pictures..  Sorry dad-- I will always stick up for what is wrong.  Plus it is Father's Day .. and they disrespected you!!",

We were also given a tasting of a cabernet they had and it went perfect with the  18oz prime I had....and it was cooked perfectly and served with delicious creamy and fresh horseradish. After dinner we were served a complimentary cheesecake with the most sparkly candle ...what a nice surprise from our funny waiter. We also ordered Dirty martini's for after dinner cocktails.

We had ribeye and a couple of sides including the potatoes and I gotta say, I've had better elsewhere.  Everything was decent but not exceptional.  I hate to say it but N9NE, Capital Grill and Fleming's are all better, just to give you an idea.  They are better than Echo and Rig though.  Echo and Rig is a lot of show and no substance, service was terrible, but that's a whole other review.  Anyway, Golden Steer, worth a try to satisfy your curiosity but they need something more compelling to get me back.  All time favorite steakhouse is still Bern's in Tampa, FL.  Please don't review this business if you received a freebie for writing this review, or if you're connected in any way to the owner or employees.",

We had to wait for our reservation so we had drinks in the bar. Drinks were good. While having our drinks though, you notice things have changed. You wonder immediately why a restaurant of this caliber is doing a Groupon. Once we are seated, it takes awhile for anyone to get us drinks and then longer for a server to come. We ordered and things arrived in a good time frame. Once our steaks arrived though my husbands wasn't cooked properly. My husband isn't one to send things back but has said 3 times he regrets that. My filet though was delicious as were the cream corn and twiced baked potato. He ordered the most expensive steak on the menu and it should have been cooked right. We ordered dessert and my husband ordered coffee with espresso. The espresso came, then the coffee came and then the check came. No dessert. We just paid the check and left. This used  to be a very classy place. Proper attire required. It still says it at the door but it isn't being enforced. It was very unorganized and just not the great experience it always was. Maybe when the Groupon is done they can get back to serving people like they used too.",

But the difference here is the experience. Of course it's old Vegas and the other reviews talk about the history of the Golden Steer. But what sets this place apart is the ambiance, the service, and the old Vegas feel.   Definitely get the table side Caesar salad the first time you go and for the full experience get one of the tableside flambe desserts. There is no chance you can be disappointed with this dining experience. You don't have to go to the strip and the prices are fair and reasonable. Give it a try.",

We ordered the stuffed mushrooms and shrimp cocktail. It was pretty standard and we started to worry that it was just going to be a regular steak house. Then we got the Caesar  salad made fresh at our table...AND YUMMY! It was one of the best Caesar salads I have ever had!  And now the main course...bone in ribeye steak. Came to our table with perfect timing! The steak was cooked to order (medium well and medium rare). The steak was extremely flavorful! A distinct flavor that I would definitely come back for! The twice baked potato, fresh asparagus and mushrooms were good, but nothing exciting...but that steak...YUMMY!  Just when we thought they had topped themselves we ordered the bananas foster...and again...WOW! Excellent presentation and the the flavor was an excellent blend of bananas, ice cream and a hint of citrus. This place is a definite must! Come hungry, but don't come broke. It's about $270 for two people, including tip at 20%. We ordered two appetizers, Caesar salad, two ribeye steaks, twice baked potato, mushrooms, asparagus and two desserts.  FYI We plan on going back in about a month!",

The decor was awesome. I could totally imagine the rat pack sitting in these plush red leather booths while eating a juicy steak. The service was attentive and very friendly as well.  We each ordered the steak of our liking, me choosing my favorite, the New York. My boyfriend ordered the rib eye. Both were very good, cooked to a perfect medium rare. I ordered a side of bearnaise sauce that I also enjoyed. I love dipping steak in bearnaise.   We also had the table side Cesar. The server wheeled his little cart over and made the dressing from scratch. It was delicious.   This is an old hidden gem that Vegas should talk more about!",

    "text": "My wife and I dined at the Golden Steer in mid July 2010 with my parents.  I did a lot of online research regarding Vegas restaurants prior to our trip and the solid reviews on Yelp really got my Dad and I excited for this place.  We both love Frank Sinatra, 'old school' vegas, and good steaks.  We figured this place would be PERFECT for us.   It's only about a $15 cab ride from The Mirage as it's located just northwest of the strip. I don't know if we hit it on a bad night or what, but this place was the absolute disappointment of the trip.  We had a 7pm reservation on a Saturday night and the place was pretty much dead.  There were about 4 people in the bar upfront which had a guy playing the piano who was pretty average.  We were in the 'front' dining room (there was another in back) and it was only us and 2 other couples.  I thought the atmosphere lacked everything the other Yelp reviewers mentioned.  There were hardly any old school pictures of the famous clientele they claimed to have served in the past.  We were in the Frank Sinatra booth and they had a prototypical picture on the wall of the Rat Pack which you could buy for about $5 anywhere.  I didn't see any authentic pictures of anyone dining there in the past and nothing was autographed.  The booths weren't anything all that special - just the old school round leather style with small inconspicuous gold plaque of who's supposed booth it was.  Our group had 1 bottle of wine, soup/salad appetizers, a new york strip steak, 2 petitie fillets, surf and turf (pettite fillet and lobster tail), and a couple of sides consisting of twice baked potatoes and broccoli and the bill came up to $325.  I had no problem dropping a bunch of money on a meal and actually expected to be into it for about $500 at this place - but I thought the prices were an absolute crime for what it was.  The steaks were good but certainly not the best I ever had.  The soup and sides paled in comparison to other high end places I've been such as Mastro's.  I'm absolutely stunned they command the prices they do for how much competition is in Vegas for this price point and how much better it is.    The \"schtick\" of the place seemed to be sharing stories about who used to frequent the place, how some of their dishes came to be, and other 'humorous' stories.  All of them really lacked charm and authenticity.  Our waiter was Mexican and the hostess lady made 3 derogatory jokes about him being Mexican.  One of which was telling another table that they needed to say goodbye to him because it was the last they would see of him because Immigration was in the kitchen.  I'm not even kidding you, that actually happened.  Along with 2 other jokes along these lines.    It's at this point that I should probably mention that I'm actual not a pretentious person nor do I have excessive dining standards - I'm certainly not a food critic.  However, paying the prices they charge for the quality of their food along with the very underwhelming atmosphere was just a complete disappointment.  I also expect a certain level of professionalism out of the staff at this price point.    There are a number of other places my family and I would've rather dine in retrospect and we wouldn't even had to travel off the strip to do it...",

    "text": "This has been our favorite Steak House in Las Vegas for years.  When we are in town, we always have made a point to eat there, and usually bring friends with us. We brag it up about the great food, the great service, and the unique \"old Vegas\" charm.  However, this last weekend, I experienced something different than ALL the other times I have been there. There are reviews on here that suggest that it is slowly going downhill, and I would have to strongly agree.  We were there on a Saturday night and the place was half full. I have never seen that before. The server that waited on us seemed to be going through the motions. Completely uninspired.  The server who made the Caesar salad at the table(one of my favorite parts of the meal), was also totally uninspired and not interested at all in answering the questions our guests had about the process of making the salad. We seemed to be bothering him. We ordered a bottle of the Cakebread Cab ($140), and it came to the table warm.  At the prices they charge, and for a bottle of wine at that price point, it is pretty poor service to bring it to the table warm.  When I informed the server of the fact that it was warm, he asked me \"what would you like me to do\".  I didn't say it, but I thought to myself, \"solve the problem!\"  Instead, we asked him to chill the wine. We shouldn't have to tell the server how to handle a warm bottle of wine.  AND MORE IMPORTANTLY, why are they serving a nice bottle of wine warm?   Where are they keeping it?  Either way, not the kind of service you expect at a restaurant that charges a premium price. Outback, maybe....but not the Golden Steer. That being said, the food was very good.  Not as good as usual, but good. No complaints about the food. When we finished, the place was a ghost town.  No hostess around to ask to call a cab.  No one to thank us for stopping by.  Something has changed with this place.  Employees are uninspired. They are not busy on a Saturday night.  They are not taking care of the customers like they used to. No longer would I consider this a \"special\" place to go, and no longer certainly worth the extra time and effort to go off the strip.",

See, I'm a food and wine writer and I choose only to write positive things in my column - which means I had nothing to write about Golden Steer. We had been planning to dine there for awhile and by chance I happened to get a Living Social certificate for $50 for Golden Steer so everything seemed perfect. From the moment we arrived, it was clear that we were not welcome and our business was neither wanted, nor needed. I would mention the name of our rude, terrible, gum chewing (I KNOW!) server, but he never bothered to give it to us. Nor did he give us a wine list until I asked for one. The server had nothing but contempt for us from the moment we presented our Living Social voucher. (If restaurants have a problem with taking these vouchers, then they shouldn't offer them, in my opinion). I guess he figured we were cheap kids and he wouldn't get a good tip. That really doesn't account for the lackluster service and presentation overall. The food was okay, not great, not bad. My filet mignon did have a piece of gristle in it - which is unaccaptable for a $45 filet, but at least it was cooked properly. The same could not be said of my Husband's ribeye. Honestly, what they did to that poor piece of meat was criminal. It was nearly burned to a crisp (ordered medium rare). Overall, the food sucks, the service sucks, and the ambiance is depressing. It's really time to turn this Golden Steer out to pasture.",

    "text": "I finally got to the Golden Steer last night, and it was simultaneously more and less than what I expected/hoped for.   From the minute you walk in the, the odd juxtaposition of a nice steakhouse in a shitty strip mall makes it self known. Two of the signs on the doorway - \"PROPER ATTIRE REQUIRED\" & \"RESTROOMS ARE FOR CUSTOMERS ONLY\" are so rarely seen together. However, once you're inside the double entry-way, you have no idea you're on in a rundown plaza on the wrong side of Sahara. There's a very nice looking bar/lounge area immediately at the entrance, and the maitre'd is to the right. We had reservations, just to be safe (I know, it's only Thursday), and were seated immediately. (The Marilyn Monroe booth, if it matters). The decor is nice, no doubt about it, and it pulls off that old steakhouse vibe very well, without feeling phony or pretentious. I was actually quite skeptical on this, but there were no disappointments there. Our waiter, who was a younger guy, and not the old dude everyone talks about, was cordial enough, but definitely didn't do anything amazing. On to the food...  Appetizers: Toasted Ravioli - As Gordon H told me \"Not gourmet by any means, but I love them.\" And that's what went through my head as I ate them. Good stuff, but you're not gonna confuse it for a fancy dish.  Soup/salad: We skipped. The guy at the booth next to us ordered the Caeser though, and it looked good.  Entree:  8oz Petit Filet: My guest had this, and she proclaimed it easily better than the bone-in filet at Joe's, but not better than Joe's ribeye. This really surprised me to hear, but I didn't taste it, so I can't confirm/disconfirm.   20oz? Ribeye: Pretty good, but not great.. I didn't get to finish it, so maybe it could've deserved better. Don't get me wrong, I wouldn't kick it out of bed, but it doesn't stack up to the competition IMO.  Sides: Twice-baked potato: Con bacon. My fucking lady friend said that it was good. I think it was too, but I couldn't compare.  Creamed spinach: Not great. Sweet & too creamy, in both of our opinions. Definitely outdone by Joe's & Del Frisco's here. Onion rings: We both saw the onion rings, prominently displayed on the menu, and hoped that they were some extra special dish. They even had an aura emanating from them upon arrival, but ultimately they were just above-average beer-battered rings.   Desert: Bananas Foster: The fucking business. Flambeed table-side, as it should be. Our man with the frying pan had some liquor ignition issues, so he had to run to the back and start fresh, but the 2nd take went just fine. And the dish was well worth the wait. My FLF said it was definitely amongst the best she's had. I really enjoyed it, but I haven't had enough others to compare.   Overall, I wouldn't rush back here for the steaks. There was a lot of seafood on the menu, which may be excellent for all I know. I will be returning to try the chicken/veal parmigiana, and definitely for deserts. Cool place though, and if I wasn't aware of other places I liked better, I'd probably come here a helluva lot more often.",

We got hungry and being the drinkers we are didn't realize it was only 4:45pm when we got there.   I walked right up pulled the handle and it was closed.    Dang it.  No worries, they opened the door right up and welcomed us in....now THAT is service.  3 of us got the 24 ounce prime rib that they are famous for...2 medium rare (i would suggest the medium)   and 1 medium.   One got the bone in rib eye.  The sides, salads etc are all \"nice\" but they are $8-16 a piece and in my opinion not worth it.    4 people got out of there for $300.00 with tip.  It is old school, we didn't sit at anyone's booth but instead sat at a four top near Joe Dimaggio and Elvis Presley's table.  The ambience is classic 50-60's vegas....you could picture the rat pack in here smoking cigars when they allowed smoking in eating establishments and it brought a lot of clarity to our vegas trip.  I will say I did get the meat sweats from all the beef and I don't know how Man -v- Food gets it all down in an hour.  The reason why they get the ding on the star  --  The call the 18 oz cut of prime rib \"the ladies cut\" to goad you into getting the bigger one.   That is crap.   Get it and smile.",

The ambience if Old Vegas just enchanted me it just envelopes you as you walk in almost like the set of a movie.

I can see why they have been in business for so long - good old fashioned EXCELLENT food and IMPECCIBLE service.  I usually order filet mingnon (well done) not an easy task to do but they did it superbly. My steak was rich and juicy AND well done the way I ordered it.  The stuffed potatoe was GIGANTIC and very delicious too! Vegetables were fresh anad crisp and lightly butterred.  The shrimps we had for an appetizer were the size of small lobsters and mouthwatering GOOD!  LOVED then caesar salad and the way it was prepared - right at the table and FRESH and DELICIOUS! You can tell the shrimp and produce were not \"sitting\" in a fridge for a week either!! Beautiful and FRESH along with the rest of the meal.  No its not cheap but its sure not over priced for quality and service either! If you want cheap go to McDonalds and don't \"whine\" about the prices! If you want a meal thats \"out-of-this-world\" go here!  You will be treated like royalty.  I was very impressed that the Maitre-D waited who was kind enoug to wait with us outside while our cab came (yes I tipped him too!  It was just NICE and well deserved!).  A phenomenal experience and I am definitely coming BACK to this favorite restaurant!!  Another nice thing as I frequently travel it was nice to see diners who were dining alone were not ignored for a second - I'd be comfortable coming back here myself - oh its nice to dine with driends but I'd be just fine alone here too!! LOVE THIS PLACE!!!",

Driving up on it may dismay you, the outside it not cute nor inviting but once you walk in its a whole different story.  This is a True old school place where Sinatra, Sammy Davis and even OJ have eaten.  Our waiter who has been there 31 years informed us who has been in and out of this place.  The menu is classic steakhouse with prime beef that they age to perfection.  We ordered Cesar salad's for two, a rib eye 20oz, a filet mignon 12 oz, twice baked potato and mushroom's.  Every thing was perfect and delicious and huge!  Oh and for dessert we splurged on the bananas foster which was prepared table side.  This place is very pricey and you must drive to get to it.  This is also a must do on the Vegas list because of its past.  I love you GS, you will be missed and I will dream of my return sometime soon.",

Its pricing is the same as a typical class chain like Capital Grill or Del Frisco's, but the serving are huge!  You really get your money's worth here.  The small prime rib (perfectly cooked) is 17 ounces!  The waiters are quick to make suggestions for sides and appetizers.  Listen to them; they know what they are talking about.  And trust them on the wines.  They aren't trying to sell you on a $20 glass of wine.  It's extremely reasonable for what you get.  And ask about the history of the restaurant.  If you only have one night to go out for prime rib or steak in Vegas, make it at the Golden Steer!",

    "text": "I will NEVER  return to The Golden Steer.     I am a local resident, and had visited The Golden Steer only one time before, many years ago.  After my first visit I was convinced that I had eaten at one of the finest restaurants in the world.  The food, the ambiance, and the service were impeccable.  Could it be that when Thomas Wolf wrote 'You Can't Go Home Again' he was referring to restaurants, as well?   On Tuesday evening, December 20, I revisited The Golden Steer with my partner.    The ambiance on my first visit had been that of a Fine Steak House, elegant and tasteful.  On the Tuesday that we visited it was more akin to a Denny's in a depressed area.  Even though the room was nearly empty, we were seated next to a large corner booth occupied by what was obviously a family.  That would not have been a problem, except that shortly after our seating a young girl, about 5 or 6 years old, began singing the one partial verse of Jingle Bells that she knew - over and over.  Again, not so bad - until she started jumping up and down in the seat.  Then a \"Hostess' or some female employee came over to their booth and encouraged the little girl to keep it up, sing louder; and even joined in with her for a few more rounds of the same 8 - 10 words that she knew.  I could have asked to be reseated, but I let it go.  It was the Christmas Season, after all.   My guest ordered a dinner salad without tomatoes.   They seemed to take forever to arrive.   They finally arrived via table side cart.  They were finished and placed on the table.  There were tomatoes on both salads.  We told the server, and he took the incorrect salad away on the cart.  Nearly 10 minutes later he returned with the salad plate in his hand, and plopped it down, very unceremoniously, in front of my guest.   The entrees arrived.  I had ordered Prime Rib of Beef (36 oz), baked potato, and creamed corn.  My guest had the Top Sirloin, steak fries and broccoli.  We both asked for our entree to be cooked the same way; medium to medium well.   My prime rib was overcooked - to the point of being DRY.  Fortunately, the au jus was there to make it palatable.   My partner's steak was closer to cremated.   There wasn't even a tinge of pink to be found in that steak.  We have both had meat that was a little too done on the outside edges, only to have it turn out to be fine as we got closer to the center.  We both kept eating, hoping for a tasty outcome.  Unfortunately, that was not the case that night.     After reaching the center of the dry, tough steak, the waiter finally wandered by.  We pointed out how overcooked the meat was.   He made a production of inspecting every aspect of the half eaten steak, flashlight and all, trying desperately to find even a speck of pink.  Unable to do so, he offered to replace it, although he felt it necessary to point out that nearly half of the meat had already been eaten.  We declined his embarrassingly disingenuous offer.  He left, returning a few minutes later to say that he had spoken to the management who had graciously taken half the price of the steak off of our bill.   Nothing was right that night.  The corn was way too sweet.  The baked potato, while big,  was absolutely unfit to serve.  Nearly black on the bottom, it had about one half inch of dark brown, scorched flesh on the inside.  Fortunately, it was large enough that I could salvage some edible parts from the top half.  The broccoli was the opposite, both undercooked (to the point of being hard)  and COLD.  A dab of butter put on top in an attempt to make it palatable,  just sat there, unmelted, throughout the meal.   We asked to have the remainder of our meals wrapped to go.  I specifically mentioned wanting the au jus for my prime rib, since it was inedible without it.  I was absolutely stunned and actually embarrassed when they brought out our take home package.  Cheap Styrofoam clam-shells in a generic plastic bag!  Even Denny's has more class than to present their guests with such a cheap, inelegant farewell.  When I got home I found that the waiter had forgotten (?) to include the au jus.  My dogs appreciated The Golden Steer.  That night, they ate prime rib for the first time in their lives.   The prices were very high, on par with what one would expect from a steakhouse that actually serves good food.  The service was poor, and any sign of ambiance must have fled after Sinatra's last visit.  This is NOT \"Old School Vegas\".  This is just an establishment that  'jumped the shark' many years ago.",

Auntie order oysters Rockefeller and a grey goose martini she gives it a five for both of those.  Her husband ordered ribeye as did my husband.  Both felt the meat flavor was good and gave theirs 4 stars although they couldn't cut with a butter knife.  mom ordered a combo of crab legs and petite filet she thought her steak was a 3 and her crab legs tasteless like they had been frozen and then put under the broiler.  I am vegetarian I usually love the sides but I give it a 1.  The creamed spinach had an odd spice in it like anise or some strong flavor we all couldn't identify.  The asparagus was steamed and cold they brought us more that was warm but had a bitter sour flavor,  we couldn't eat it.  The $9 baked potato was a 1.50 potato.  I expected the skin to have a nice crust it didn't.  I expected it to be served with butter, sour cream and chives.  It was served with sour cream and margarine.  The French onion soup my husband said tasted like Sysco no flavor.  The salad was iceberg and large but not much too it a few garbanzo beans and tomorrow pieces.  The bread was French loaves but dry and flavorless.",

My only other major gripe is the wine list has a lot of room for improvement.  Avoid the twice-baked potato: very dry.  But it's fun and the waiters are great.",

This was evidenced by the table across from us, apparently regulars, who enjoyed (endured) a lo-o-ng conversation with their waiter, who bent over the table to talk to them - at great length - treating my husband and I to a close-up view of his backside, which literally was at the edge of our booth table.  Nice.  Had to ask for bread, and to remind them of our side dishes, which were served about 15 minutes after our a la carte steaks arrived at the table.  Steaks were very poor quality, full of gristle.  Ridiculous for a restaurant of this price range.  Treat yourself to one of the many other, quality steakhouses in Las Vegas - you'll be disappointed at this dive.",

It's not like anyone asked if it was ok though. My partner complained and the manager on duty after being asked if she had a moment to speak replied\" yeah I have three seconds, go.\" I don't care about this places tradition or previous reviews.

It's in a little shopping plaza so the parking is kind of small. But once your in there, it's surprisingly very nice. It's kinda dark in there, it reminds me of what I would think old skool Vegas would be. It was a little expensive but what do you expect for a steak house in Vegas. I ordered Prime Rib diamond Jim cut that sucker was huge. It looked really intimidating when it came out. I ordered it medium-well wow it was delicious. I would really recommend this. Just keep in mind that all side dishes are not included. I ordered the twice baked potato it was OK but I thought it would of tasted better, it was a little plain. My husband ordered the bone-in Rib Eye steak, this was delicious it was nice n tender and super juicy for being well done. He also ordered the sauteed mushrooms OMG if you love mushrooms you have to order these.. They we soooo good I don't know know what else to say, they were buttery garlicky just yummy. Along with the jumbo baked potato. All I can say about that was WoW. It was huge, it came with all the goodies. All n all I recommend this place if your  carnavor like us. It's a really nice restaurant great for date night or to try something new",

Please do yourself a favor and order the table side presentation caesar salad. The best caesar I have ever had. Had the filet and it is outstanding. The baked potatoes are the largest, and best, I have ever seen. And to top it off, the bananas foster table side presentation is the best way to top this fabulous dinner off.  The staff, Alfredo especially, are among the best in the city. Even Fabian, who has been serving there for 40 years, is a treat to interact with. We were lucky enough to sit in Elvis Presley's booth he sat in when he frequented GS. Of course if you would like to sit in Dean's booth, Franks table, or Sammy's as well, all are represented. The GS is worth the cab ride from any resort you may be staying at while in Vegas. It is an original icon and separates itself from the celebrity chef themed steak houses of the strip. Whether your celebrating a special event or are just wanting a great steak in an original, one of a kind environment, the Golden Steer will not disappoint.",

You'll likely be in the company of some Old Vegas Money sitting nearby...peering at you curiously. Regardless, its a cool experience with waiters dressed in tuxes and spouting cheesy jokes and factoids for first time diners. The interior is well maintained with classy paintings and red leather upholstered booths that make you feel like you are breaking bread with the rat pack. If you like atmosphere the way I do, you'll feel right at home.  The bread wasn't bad, but nothing particularly memorable. The steaks arrived at a reasonable time-- we didn't really wait that long. The steak itself was perfect-- definitely one of the ten best steaks I've ever tasted in my lifetime. I'm not sure if it was the best outright, or if it was considerably better than the one I had at Hank's steak and martini. It was a ribeye cooked medium rare--just the way any real steak eater likes em. My girlfriend had the prime rib which came with some pretty tasty horseradish and cream dip. We ordered steak fries as our solitary side. I had no problem finishing my rib eye and sampled some of my girlfriends cut, which was perfectly cooked as well. I can't comment much on the sides, other than to say that the fries we ordered were tasty but hardly better than the fat fries you can get at your local Fatburger. From what I've been told, the sides are good but not stellar at this joint. If i return in the future I'll be better able to assess the experience but from what I saw, it was an enjoyable night with good, expensive food.",

He was friendly, attentive, and with a great sense of humor. Out of the party of six 4 of us had the 22oz ribeye steak. It was like butter. Cooked perfectly. Our Caesar salad was made at the table. Our sides were asparagus and whipped potatoes. All very tasty. Wine and cocktails were very yum. And they surprised my husband and I with a cheesecake slice with a firework on top.",

Our latest event was to celebrate a friends 50th birthday party. We were fortunate to have the private room available for our party of 15. The room atmosphere was incredible. The service was very professional and the food was well worth the price. Hats off to the entire Staff for assisting with and setting up the presentation of the very memorable 50th birthday cake. Despite the large number of the party, our server handled everyone with individual attention and professionalism. Our friends were very impressed with both food and service. The 50th birthday dinner party was definitely a success, thanks to the Golden Steer. Highly recommend the Golden Steer to everybody!",

I wanted to celebrate him and he is a big steak lover so I couldn't wait.   We get there.. love the ambiance.. I feel like I'm temporarily in a different decade, honestly and I like it. They kept the history of the place in tact.. their menu states that among their guests, Elvis Presley and Frank Sinatra used to frequent this place, and it was cool to feel that for a second.   Next, the service was great from every angle. Everyone we interacted with was top level. Seemed to really enjoy what they do and take pride in their service. I appreciate great service.   Now, for the food and drinks- I ordered the first cocktail on the list, forget the name but it was the best drink I've ever had.. so I'll need to revisit because I'm usually not a cocktail girl. My bf drinks beer but he's a beer snob and he was happy too ;)  We ordered the Alaskan crab as an appetizer.. delicious. I had the filet and lobster for my meal and I couldn't have been more pleased. Incredible presentation and taste.  He had NY Strip and he mirrored my feelings.. we both shared that we were both more than impressed with this dinner.  The sides were good, recommend the twice baked potatoe.  As it was his birthday, they treated him to a piece of cheesecake and a pretty cool birthday candle.. and that ended the perfect celebration of my sweetie's birthday dinner. The experience will be among my favorites.  With it being",

Otherwise known as The Frank Sinatra Booth. How cool is that?  The food was amazing. Immediately, we were served bread and water, the wife ordered garlic bread for an appetizer. For the main course my wife had Veal Marsala ($34.00) Medallions of Veal, Mushrooms, Herbs and Marsala Wine. For a side dish she had Fresh Broccoli ($9.00). Personally I ordered New York Strip 16oz. ($50 .00). For a side dish I ordered Twice Baked Potato ($9.00).  The portions of the side dishes were huge! I don't mind saying, as much as I loved my steak. The twice baked potato was spectacular!   I expected The Golden Steer to be top notch, and that's what I got.",

Food - For appetizers we had the crab cakes and calamari. Both were really good! I had the special for the day which was a 12oz filet mignon topped with bearnaise sauce and asparagus. The filet was cooked to perfection and was delicious   Only thing that was just okay was the Caesar salad. It was a little heavy on the dressing   Service - our wait staff was great.

This place is something out of the 1950's that's appears not to have changed in years.  There's pictures of John Wayne and other's from that era on the walls.  You come here for a steak or some prime rib and the typical side dishes.   We shared the bone end rib eye that was about 22 ounces and plenty to share between two people.  Got a bottle of wine and started off with some Oysters Rockefeller.  It was a simple dinner, but we were pretty full and didn't have the side dishes.  If you want to get off the strip and you're into old school steak houses, this is a good place to go and get away from the strip (about $20 taxi) and go back in time.",

The bartenders are \"top notch, top notch\" as Ted Knight said in Caddyshack. Once you sit down for dinner, you have to order the Cesar Salad. They bring it out and make it right in front of you making your mouth water for more. After that order the filet with Alaskan King Crab legs (that's a solid deck at blackjack cost wise). Desert, the creme Berle is a must. It's the experience and journey along with the food that makes this place great. Oh...and it's the tradition and history that goes hand in hand with the great service that makes you feel #1 here. You haven't experienced Las Vegas dining until you have been to the Golden Steer!",

Our last experience provided us with a New York which was tough, flavorless  and sinewy. No herb butter, no rosemary or thyme sprig to add flavor. The Ribeye was not far behind.  I can only blame myself for expecting more than they are willing to deliver since they have name recognition.  Garlic bread was limited to 3 slices per order and the regular bread order  that followed was not even similar quality (it's the details I care about if I'm going to spend my hand earned $). Soup, house salad...all lacked luster. I could go on, but why dwell on it... Wishing you a better experience!",

I can now see why it's been around before my family even moved to the mainland.  Goes back to old school Vegas when you can see Italian-American influence in the decor down to your wait staff's uniforms. Menu's items also reflect old school tastes. LOL. Where else can you see a table-side Caesar salad get tossed for you? Or enviously watch your neighboring table get a flambeed banana foster? Apparently, the Golden Steer Steakhouse is one of the few remaining spots to get this vibe and action.  I've been debating about whether to give this place 4 or 5 stars. Honestly came down to getting great customer service on NYE. It's gotta be tough to be that hospitable when most people would rather actually be the ones out there celebrating with family and friends, so this 5 star review is for the wait staff that were just downright nice and accommodating.  Food and cocktails were great too. Mouth is literally watering just thinking about the lamb chops I had cooked to my preference perfectly. Didn't even mind that there was no accompanying mint jelly for the entree. Ooh... That prime rib the fiance ordered and actually shared with me was amazing. *SIGH*  With about 3-4 specialty cocktails, escargots, French onion soup, a 10 oz. prime rib, lamb chops, a twice-baked potato and sauteed mushrooms, and strawberry cheesecake, the bill came out to be around $275 (includes the 20-25% gratuity) for my fiance and I.  My only regret: not ordering the banana foster.  This place certainly made me feel better about breaking our San Diego trip tradition.",

We had mushrooms, twice baked potato, and the mac n cheese for our sides. All sides were great, a solid 4 stars, but none were straight up perfect.  From the outside, the restaurant looks average. Once you enter, the ambiance is lovely- it is low lighting with candle lit tables. Waiters were all attentive and drinks were always full.  BTW, utilized a Groupon deal here.

Service is impeccable and some of the best I have ever had, menu options were typical for a steakhouse, food tasted amazing, steak was cooked to perfection. I would highly recommend.",

    "text": "Decided on the Golden Steer to celebrate our 30th anniversary, as my wife and I are long (long) time Vegas locals. Unfortunately it didn't meet my expectations. The porterhouse house steak, was small in my opinion, good thing my wife couldn't finish her steak. Other than that, everything else was good. However, it was the loud mouth at the Joe DiMaggio table (across from the Marilyn Monroe table, our table) that was dropping the F-bomb loudly and frequently. I was going to tell him to shut up, but my wife didn't want me to cause a ruckus being just across from him. She didn't even want me to tell the waiters, as they obliviously heard him and should  have intervened. I have to agree. I waited to talk to the owner, Mike(?), who was greeting the table behind me but couldn't as our Uber driver arrived (had show tickets). We had such high expectations for a steakhouse that has been around since I we were kids.   I must say this, it's worth checking out just for the ambiance, decor and Vegas history.   p.s. get the table side Caesar Salad.",

I really wanted us to dine at the best possible steakhouse in Vegas while we were there for Labor Day weekend so I was looking and couldn't decide for almost 3 days, there were too many excellent choices after all. Finally we decided on this 'institution'. Hey if it's good enough for Frank Sinatra and Elvis Presley, it's good enough for us, right?   Upon getting there, we were welcomed and asked to wait for around 20 more minutes then we were led to our booth. Classy red leather, exudes quiet elegance. Zach was our server and was warm and friendly, though I felt service was a little inconsistent, had a few pockets where we weren't attended to for quite a long time, and I couldn't ask for another glass of Champagne for like 20 mins.  As for entrees, hubby and I shared the 22 oz. Ribeye steak which we asked to be cooked Medium (I do medium rare, husband likes medium and it was his birthday so it's a compromise), but our steak was done medium rare, which I kinda felt bad for the birthday boy. Creamed spinach was also good.  Given they knew we were celebrating his birthday, Zach brought over a slice of cheesecake complete with sparklers. I thought this was such a nice touch and was kind of the redeeming moment. We definitely appreciated it. We also decided to order the Bananas Foster dessert, which is a House speciality and flambeed tableside. We enjoyed watching the little production number and definitely enjoyed sharing it.  Overall, a memorable dining experience, which was worth coming off the strip for.",

While it's not stuffy it is very nice providing a relaxed dining experience with EXCELLENT service!    We started with cocktails, martinis & Manhattans both very GOOD and filled to the brim      We had the Caesar prepared table side which is always a nice touch AND it was delicious too PLUS it was a nice portion ~    Our filets were presented correctly as we ordered them & tasty too with bernaise sauce. Our sides were twice baked potato & asparagus both expertly cooked. The next time I would try a different sides especially the potato side dish just to mix it up.     Both of us ordered dessert, a chocolate cream brulee & tiramisu. My brulee's was good however the tiramisu was better ~     All in all we liked the Golden Steer and would be happy to go back the next time we want steak  ~",

    "text": "******UPDATED REVIEW: Aug. 2019:******* I have dined here several times- I used to enjoy coming here & made sure to spread the word but after our dinner last weekend I am very disappointed! We were going to order our usual filet mignon and maybe add some lobster but I asked if there was anything else good on the menu & our waiter mentioned the chicken in wine sauce etc. we both took a risk and ordered it. Huge mistake! Honestly, it was probably the worst meal we have had in awhile. Neither one of us even ate more then 1-2 bites! We were starving but it was so bland and soggy I was in utter disbelief that it was actually served. That dish should have never left the kitchen. Ugh. The bread is usually warm and soft but it was neither. I felt like we literally got someone else's leftover meal. It was presented already cut up which was not attractive. When two people don't even touch their meals that should be a huge red flag!! The caesar salad was good-never had the table side done before... but then as we were eating someone came back over and spoke to us for sooo long @ the history of the salad. I couldn't even eat bc he wouldn't leave. If you're going to do that please do it as he makes the salad not after so we cant even enjoy it. We felt very rushed bc the staff kept coming by -I do tend to eat slowly bc I have acid reflux & I like to take my time but I do Not want to be rushed when we are dining out.  We were both just so disappointed. Not sure if it was new servers or they wanted to go home but this was NOT a pleasant dining experience for us at all. Sorry but that chicken dish was awful. We both left extremely dissatisfied, hungry and upset. :(  Just moved to Vegas a couple weeks ago & this place was on my list. Made an early reservation on an off night (Tuesday @6p) Had a Groupon ($35/$60) but don't get it wrong this place is pricey so if you don't want to spend a lot don't bother going. Depends on what you order. Garlic bread was only $5/but they give you comp delish warm bread and butter. I asked for a recommendation for a Riesling/or Moacawhite sweet wine: Moscato/Asti-It was so good. Nice & chilled. Preserved the 12oz filet mignon ($51-the 8oz was $45 so I upgraded) and it was cooked perfectly which rarely happens bc I like mine well done. We also got a porterhouse which he said was good and 2 sides to share($10) Twice bakes potatoes & Mac n cheese. Overall a good meal. I could have def done without the lady who brought her kid and a baby which she was breastfeeding at he dining room table and chugging a 32 Oz beer while doing so. We were not interested in that drunken show. It got VERY loud @6:30pm so if you want a quiet dinner I suggest going super early 4:30-5:30. Our server \"Tom\" & his assist. \"Ali\" were great. I'd ask for butter and the other one would bring it within 30 seconds. You are paying $$$$ for a delicious meal quality & efficient service. We hear about 3 other tables using their Groupons so we don't feel out of place lol. Ask for Tom he was great. I'd def go back...also remember to leave at least 20% tip on the \"before bill total\" if using a Groupon.",

I had read this place on the various Vegas lists. So I was determined to try. Once we turned the corner of Sahara and saw that yellow sign in the strip mall  similar to many an adult video store back home. We thought, this might be a mistake.  Inside it looks like your classic steak house from the 50s.   First highlight. Table side Caesar salad. Are you kidding me. How could you even call the garbage I've been eating since Caesar salad. My friend and I were joking about going to a steak house and just getting a salad. For this Caesar. It would be totally acceptable.   Next highlight, the steak. Hands down the best steak I've ever had. I got the New York strip. Perfectly done. Simply seasoned. Super juicy. My only regret was not getting a bigger one.   I don't know if my brother wasn't feeling well or just wanted to be different but he got the sole. I thought it was lame but out the whole fish comes and out server with two spoons deftly deboned and plated the fish.  Wow!    Finally dessert. Bros don't share dessert...unless of course its bananas foster prepared table side. I'm a sucker for a table side presentation. Flames and smells and flair. I love it.    Service beyond reproach. Very professional and polished. Not some millennial that just got laid off from a Chili's.   This is a definite Vegas must do",

    "text": "Without a doubt, Las Vegas has no shortage of fine steakhouses. However, there is only a handful that will transport you back in time with an 'old school' Las Vegas vibe. We have been eyeing the Golden Steer and we're looking forward to experiencing the old fashioned charm of this legendary steakhouse, as it came highly recommended by our friends (and Yelp).   Las Vegas Restaurant Week was upon us this past June, and we wanted to take full advantage of the deals around the city. You see,  restaurants around Las Vegas will participate in this occasion by providing a special set menu while providing a discount to guests and donating a portion of the proceeds to a local Las Vegas food bank (Three Square). We saw that The Golden Steer was on the list of participating restaurants and secured our reservations.   As others have mentioned, this unassuming restaurant is tucked away in a rather 'iffy' strip mall located to the west of The Strip on Sahara. Don't let its outward appearance fool you. Once you step foot into this establishment, you'll be transported back in time for an exceptional dining experience. With a dimly lit, dark wood interior with red leather clad booths named after Las Vegas legends of years past, you'll immediately know you're in for a retro-infused experience.    We ordered off their Restaurant Week Menu set at $80 per person. The Four Course meal included our following selections :             Two Shrimp Cocktail  Each of us received two jumbo shrimp over ice with cocktail sauce             Two Tableside Cesar Salads  The dressing made fresh at your tableside with romaine lettuce tossed into the dressing mix. Ask them to leave out the anchovies if you'd like.             One Filet Mignon  Tender and well-seasoned steak that was cooked at a Medium temperature. My husband thoroughly enjoyed this cut, and even preferred it to their prime rib!             One Petite Cut Prime Rib  Tender and well-seasoned steak that was cooked at a Medium temperature and served with fresh horseradish. A heartier cut of steak, that he enjoyed as we generally don't order this cut.             One Jumbo Australian Lobster Tail  This was a special add on to the set  Restaurant Week menu. Listed as MP, it was $75 the day of our visit. I enjoyed every bite dipped in butter!             Two Banana's Foster Desserts  The banana slices are flambeed tableside in rum and served over a scoop of vanilla ice cream. It was perfectly delicious!             One Dinner Wine Pairing  This was a special add on to the set  Restaurant Week men that offered a wine pairing (half a pour) with each course of the four courses that were served.     I would highly recommend this steakhouse to tourists and locals alike (whether its restaurant week or not). If you're looking to try something new with a nod to Las Vegas history, come here. It was the best dinner I've had in a VERY long time. The ambiance was spot on, and the service is impeccable. We will return for a special occasion.",

The Grand Dame of Vegas steakhouses is showing her age, and can no longer offer the quality of food and service that originally made her famous.  I mean, The food is fine - pretty much what you'd expect - but the recipes  are a little old-school for my taste (The Creamed Spinach was mostly cream and cheese with just enough spinach for color. The Mac and Cheese is plain). These dishes might have been novel in 1968. Today, they seem tired.  Also, the tables are now so tightly packed together that the staff often has to scoot sideways to get past each other.  With so many people, The noise level is high, making communication challenging - both at the table, and with our servers. We had to endure at least four rounds of \"Happy Birthday\" while we ate. I think of that as more of a Hofbrauhaus kind of thing - not something you'd see in a *nice* restaurant.  So, Gone is the classy style of the Rat Pack era; now tourists from the Strip show up in flip flops and sun dresses, speaking in loud voices about how cool they are. Snore.  The history of the place makes it worth a visit. The food is fine, But you can do better in Vegas without spending this much money.",

The overall score is an average of all other categories with steak being counted twice, since it is a review of a steakhouse.    Overall: 4.2 Decor: 5 Bread: 4 Appetizer: 4 Filet: 5 Side: 3 Dessert: 4   Golden Steer is a classic, old-school steak house, located in the Sahara of Las Vegas.   The decor gives you a feeling of stepping back into the 60s and 70s, where you half expect the rat-pack to walk in the door.   The bread was very good.    I ordered the shrimp cocktail as an appetizer and it was also very good.   The filet mignon was excellent.   As a side I ordered the potatoes lyonnaise and it was not good at all. The potatoes were undercooked and soggy while the onions were piled on to the point where I had to use my bread plate to hold the excess onions after scraping them off. However, the twice baked potato was excellent.    For dessert I ordered Chocolate cake and it was very good.   Overall, Golden Steer Steakhouse was an excellent choice and is a must visit spot for anyone visiting Vegas.",

This evening was a medley of Frank Sinatra tunes. Again we enjoyed the evening in the Mayor's booth.  We were seated immediately upon arrival 10 minutes before our reservation. The bread basket arrived and the choice of water was offered. During dinner the water glasses were refilled without asking. Our server Jonathon was on point taking care of us throughout dinner. We ordered the following after enjoying refreshing cocktails of an Amaretto and a Vesper Martini. Escargots, Petite Filet Mignon, Australian Lobster Tail, Twice Baked Potato, Grilled Asparagus The Escargot Appetizer was delicious. Large plump morsels floating in butter. The dinner roll was great to absorb the last drops of butter.  The 8 oz Filet was cooked as requested, well done and was tender and juicy without being butterflied. The potato was large and the perfect choice for sharing. The Asparagus was lightly grilled and tender. The Lobster tail was 14 oz and the shell was removed table side. This was a large sweet piece of ocean goodness.  The Golden Steer is still firing on all cylinders. Don't change anything.",

    "text": "This steakhouse is an absolute gem!  I was hesitant to come here when my boyfriend suggested we bring his parents here for dinner, they were visiting from out of town.  First off, the drive here is rather deceiving as you pull up to an older strip mall.  The restaurants facade and signage screams old school/possible adult shop.  You're not quite sure what to make of it.  Like how could an upscale steakhouse be located right here???  However, as you enter the steakhouse, you are transported into an atmosphere that has all the old school Vegas vibes with a touch of class.  Such a pleasant surprise and it only gets better from here.    The decor is vintage with a bit of Western art. Pictures of the Rat Pack, Marilyn Monroe, Frank Sinatra and other legends scattered throughout the restaurant.  This is Vegas' oldest steakhouse and I can see why it continues to be a local favorite.  Now on to the food....we ordered the Caesar salad prepared table side, my boyfriend and I shared the Rib Eye Steak Bone-in (22 oz), his parents got the Prime Rib English Cut (10 oz) and Prime Rib Diamond Little Cut (18 oz).  For sides we shared the Twice baked potato and asparagus.    Everything was prepared to perfection.  The meat was unbelievably soft and seasoned flawlessly.  It practically melted into your mouth.  Just WOWWW!  Probably one of the best steaks I've ever tasted!!    Overall, I would not hesitate to come here again.  It is a great place to bring out of town guests or to celebrate special occasions.  Looking forward to my next visit!",

    "text": "My husband had a great idea when he suggested the Golden Steer. We love a good steakhouse, but had yet to try an old school steakhouse in Vegas. So the oldest steakhouse in Vegas it was for date night.  The restaurant is located in a small strip shopping center on Sahara. It's not far from The Strip, but not on Strip. It'd be a quick Uber ride for tourists.   Inside they have preserved the old Vegas feel, but in a kept up way. Large red leather booths and tables with pictures of famous past diners on the walls. Seating at the main dining room tables is a little tight, but it didn't mar the experience for us.  Service was professional, friendly, and attentive. Based on reviews I was worried that service might not be great, but we had great service.  One of my favorite things about old school steakhouses is the cart style service. The Golden Steer is no different. Everything is served from a rolled cart. The fun part is that several menu items are prepared tableside. For this experience order the Caesar salad, bananas fosters, or cherries jubilee.   The rolls to start seemed boring at first, but I really enjoyed the simplicity and flavor. I started with a Mixed Green Salad that was simple, but good. It was just iceberg lettuce, tomatoes, carrots, cucumbers, garbanzo beans, and a liberal amount of one of four dressings. My husband liked his Escargot enough, but did say it wasn't the best he's had.   For the main course I went with the Petite Filet Mignon which is eight ounces. I enjoyed the flavor of the seasoning. The steak was not the best I've ever had, but it was still steakhouse quality. My husband really enjoyed his Shorthorn which was plenty of steak for him at 16 ounces. We shared a Twice Baked Potato which was delicious and plenty for two.   Dessert is always a must for me. We each ordered Cherries Jubilee. Delicious! We each received a portion that we could have easily split. Plenty of vanilla ice cream covered in delicious cherries with a lovely hint of orange and cinnamon.  What a great meal and experience. I'd definitely consider returning when family or friends are in town to show them an old Vegas experience.",

    "text": "After a short taxi ride from the Bellagio, we arrived at what on the outside appeared to be a rundown place. But, when we walked in, it was like I was carried back in time, but in a good way.  This was one of the best meals I've ever had, but not just due to the food or service, but both, as well as listening to my boyfriend recount memories of when his parents came here in the 1990's.  We happened to be there during restaurant week, and chose to eat from that menu.  That began with a shrimp cocktail (if you see other people's pictures of the shrimp, yes, they are HUGE) for each of us, followed by the Caesar salad prepared table side.  I'm ruined now for all other Caesar salads.  That was followed by prime rib and twice baked potato for him, the filet and creamed spinach for me.  Dessert for me was Bananas Foster, because the only other time I had it, the place didn't flambe it....I mean seriously!  It was really good.  The servers were awesome and gracious, yet not stiff.  I've had service so bad that it pretty much ruined an experience for me.  We're already talking about trying to get back to Vegas for a short trip, and will definitely eat here again!",

We started with the table side Caesar salad for two. It was delicious. They have really perfected their dressing, garlicky and a good amount of acidity from the lemon and red wine vinegar, not overly oily and heavy, but perfectly coated the lettuce.  I went with the Shorthorn medium rare and Las Vegas' largest baked potato, fully loaded. Steak was cooked perfectly and needed no extra accoutrements. The potato is quite possibly not just the largest, but the most delicious I've ever had. The toppings were plentiful and the chives were so fresh, they must have a garden somewhere in back!  We saved room for the Cherries Jubilee, again table side service. Great show, and yummy dessert. It was an evening that made you feel like you were back in the glory days of the Rat Pack!",

On top of that, it's cheaper than the most of the other cuts. They serve sliced or whole which we elected the sliced, which was the right choice. Cooked a perfect medium rare and seasoned just right.   They offer their salad as a single, but prepare in the back instead of table side but also split on two plates for us. Was just ok though, but loved that they offered us the option. The creamed corn was avg and baked potato was awesome, just not the largest one in Vegas as advertised. All in all, I will be back again and again for the steak and hope to find other sides worthy of the meal. Service was fast and friendly as well, although you could tell it was the end of a long night for them.",

Our waiter was knowledgeable and attentive.   The food was great! I ordered the Filet Mignon which was cooked to perfection and juicy. The loaded baked potato was enormous!! My husband order the porterhouse which was probably the most favorable steak I've ever had. I probably preferred this cut better!  As for pricing, it was an expensive night. We ordered al la carte. Our steaks were about $60 a piece $10 for our sides/ desserts each.. on the other hand my GLASS of wine was $17 so that seemed a bit much. All in all if you're looking to splurge a little bit on a nice steakhouse this is the place to go!",

I had read comments about Humberto on here, so when I saw that our server was Humberto at the bar, I was like oh, no. Well, I guess it's all in how you treat others because Humberto was extremely nice and on top of everything.  We moved to our table and ordered appetizers -- escargot (best I've ever had) and calamari (very good). We ordered the table side Caesar salad (was YUMMY) and my husband had French onion soup which he said was delicious. Entrees ordered were my husband and I split Porterhouse (delicious), eggplant (my aunt said it was good but not great), and my uncle ordered lamb which he said was delicious. Sides we ordered were French fries (huge and a lot) and creamed corn (my husband liked, I did not). Dessert was bananas foster (delicious). Service was good!  Definitely a place I will go back to!!",

    "text": "Now I can cross off another iconic Las Vegas restaurant from my list.  I almost took us to Bavette's but changed my mind at the last minute.  This trip was all about keeping it old school.  The Golden Steer Steakhouse is about as old school as it gets.  Conventioneers enjoying dinner, an old guy with a young lady of the night.  A mixed crowd for sure.  It's Vegas.  Perfect!  It wasn't particularly busy on this Tuesday around 8:45 p.m.  We cozied up to a fairly empty bar and ordered a vodka martini with a blue cheese stuffed olive.  Perfectly made.  We got seated in the Mayors booth across from the old guy and his \"girlfriend\" for the night.  We split the wedge salad.  Holy smokes this thing was huge.  My half alone was almost half a head of iceberg lettuce.  Great blue cheese dressing.  They must make it here.  We split the 22 oz ribeye, a gigantic loaded baked potato, and a lobster tail.  Bernaise and peppercorn sauce on the side.  The peppercorn sauce was kinda sweet.  Skip it. Everything was on point.  Had to do the table side Banana's Foster.  Woo hoo!  Almost forgot my only grip with this place.  Instead of dropping the check like EVERY nice restaurant does, the waiter rolls up with a mobil credit card terminal and just stands there while you are expected to pay right then and there.  I said give me a minute pal.  He pretty much just stood there until I figured out the tip and did the transaction.  Felt like I was eating at a Red Robin in the end.  Maybe they get a lot of dine and dash situations.  I don't know but I didn't like it.  Will we go back?  Gosh, I don't know.  Probably not. There's so much to try in Las Vegas.  So many restaurants old and new.  At least I can say I've been there.  Recommended if your looking for old Vegas the way it used to be and pretty much still is if you know where to look.",

First off, if you're interested in dining at one of their specific booths such as the Frank Sinatra booth, make reservations in advance.. I called a week in advance to reserve the booth and my request was granted. Upon arrival, we were greeted by a gentleman who had us wait in the bar area as our booth was being prepared. When we were finally seated, he elaborated on a few fun facts about the Frank Sinatra booth. It was off to a good start..at least I thought.. Our server came by to introduce himself, gave us a few minutes or maybe more, and then finally took our drink order. After a lengthy wait, another server came by and took our food order.. to make this review short, the service was just weak, there was no interest when it came to our table. I'm not sure if the gentleman I saw walking around to each table was the manager, but I observed as he approached every single table, asked if everything was okay except ours. The quality of the food was decent, the bananas foster was a real hit! It's made table side and what better way to have dessert without adding a little flare! Overall, I wish the service was more pleasant.",

Dark and cozy, great bar, best Caesar salad, made table side, wonderful wine list, attentive service, great steak, over-sized baked potato, what more could one want? ( garlic bread could have been better).  Will make this a must place to eat every time we visit family in Lad Vegas.  Don't let the ugly strip mall it is located in scare you off. The restaurant is well worth visiting and returning to again and again.",

Nice booths, pictures of old school celebs, Sinatra songs in the background. ---  Service was quite good.  I was a bit worried after reading some of the reviews here, but our waiter was very nice and the service was attentive without being overbearing. ---  Steaks were tasty and cooked to perfection.  NEGATIVES: ---  The tableside Casear salads were merely OK.  I expected a bit better for $12 per.   ---  The sides weren't very good.  The twice-baked potato was marginal at best, and the asparagus with bernaise sauce was NO BUENO.  I'd avoid having the bernaise sauce on my steak if I were you. ---  It's a little spendy - everything is a la carte.  Ended up spending a bit over $100/plate after tip.  I'm not really sure how I still come up with four stars, but there you go.  I REALLY liked my steak, I guess...",

So-so on the creamed spinach. It was a little runny and tastes sweeter than I expected. (A little salt went a long way). Not a lot of wine by the glass options. They could improve on this for sure. Only 2-3 red wine glass options. Desserts looked amazing, but I didn't order one. I would go again and order the same salad and steak. I would also order a bottle of wine vs a glass.",

A brass plaque proudly announced the fact.i had the petite ( not really petite at 8 oz), a mixed green salad, and the whipped potatoes. As we informed the side dishes were large enough to share. My wife had the Dover sole. The table side preparation was quite a show. The sole was delicious. All of the food was of exceptional quality and perfectly prepared. The entire meal representative of an earlier era where the atmosphere and ambience was every bit as important as the food. We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. I would highly recommend this restaurant. I only wish that most patrons would have dressed appropriately and left the shorts and sweats at home.",

We had reservations and were seated quickly upon arrival.  Our waiter was quite knowledgeable which helped greatly in our meal choices.  Our friends started with the escargots which they said were \"divine\".  I had the poached salmon with dill cream sauce for my entree... It was spectacular!  The fish was cooked perfectly and the sauce so delicious that I wanted to lick the plate.  It also came with a side of wild rice.  My husband's 18oz prime rib was also good, but so much meat that he couldn't finish it. Our friends had the petite and regular filet mignons.  They raved!  The side of asparagus that we shared as a table was the perfect compliment to round out the meal.  Highly recommended all around!",

    "text": "I've now been to Golden Steer twice. It seems like I'm being treated progressively worse. I live in the condo building next door so I try to support businesses in my neighborhood. I can honestly say I'll never be a patron at Golden Steer again.   The first time I came to The restaurant the hostess tried to act like she couldn't seat me despite the restaurant literally being empty. There were literally 3 customers in the restaurant. I brushed it off. The servers were rude to me and practically ignored me and the prime rib was not good at all. I chalked it up to an isolated bad experience.   I came back about 6 months later (today) and the hostess tells me there's a 1.5 hour wait. She later gets on the phone and tells another potential customer that they have space if they come now.   I sat in the bar high tops area for about 25 minutes. Nobody brought me a menu or even acknowledged me. I literally had to go and find a server and place an order. This time I tried the ribeye. I asked for it medium rare +. They gave me a medium-medium well steak. When asked for another steak the server tried to blame it on the au jus. I eat at steakhouses weekly. Au jus had never made a steak more well done in my experience.   As I type this I've been finished with my dinner for about 20 minutes and no one has come to offer me the check. I'm practically invisible. This is very disappointing. None of the other patrons are being treated like this. I'm the only Black patron in the restaurant. I hope this is merely a coincidence.",

    "text": "Inside this unassuming exterior is a time machine of when the rat pack ran the streets of Vegas.  As we entered, we were greeted by a host and hostess, dressed in formal attire and intent on service.  We felt genuinely welcome and were escorted to one of the dining rooms.  The low-light ambiance made it feel private and red booths with plaques reserved for luminaries like Muhammad Ali and Joe DiMaggio ringed the walls with tables in the middle.    Seated quickly, we perused the menu.  It featured items that are not for casual dining.  Rather this place is a treat for those who have discerning tastes and expect excellent service.  Our main server, Tom reminded me of a classic Jersey boy - to the point.  No fluff.  All business.  Not that he's unfriendly.  That's far from the case.  It just felt like the kind of guy Sinatra would want at his table.  Another gem was Fabian.  He also assisted us and had almost a Hawaiian laid-back vibe to him.  Again, he was very attentive and requests were quickly met.  We felt like there was no rush.  That the experience was one to be savored.  We ordered the bone in ribeye, asparagus, surf and turf Combo with fillet mignon and crab.  For sides we also had the French onion soup and cesar salad.  Bread with butter was on the table to take the edge off while we waited.  The salad and steaks either met or slightly exceeded expectations for the investment.  We had them medium rare and medium.  Both were cooked appropriately and obviously seared to lock in juices.  Both were tender and flavorful.  Unlike some other steak houses, these were seasoned minimally to allow the customer to suit his/her tastes.  The bread was nothing spectacular.  Good, but unremarkable.  The asparagus was similar.  Using the lemon and adding some salt really raised it up a notch.  The crab was quite good, A nice touch was they split and grilled some of the legs.  It was a great counterpoint to the other traditional legs served with the meal.  The slightly crunchy texture was delightful.  However, the star of the evening was the French onion soup.  This masterpiece had us both raving.  The broth was very flavorful and the cheese expertly melted.  The thick layer ensured that one could have cheese with the soup even after the initial spoonfuls.    All the ingredients used were fresh and of the highest caliber.  We finished the night with the cherries jubilee.  Fabian attended us again and created the wonderful flaming display.  Always looking for improvement, my wife asked for some chocolate to go with it.  Unhesitatingly, Fabian brought out not only chocolate, but a raspberry topping as well.  He knocked it out of the park with the raspberry addition.  It was spectacular.  It was little touches like Fabian's thoughtfulness, and Tom's chutzpah that made the evening special.  Every person there was part of a team and their goal was the immediate and total satisfaction of the diner.  Though there may be hipper and newer steakhouses - the Golden Steer set the standard.  You don't have to be new and hip if you have brilliance in the basics.",

I had the pleasure of ordering a prime rib here, and they brought out this monstrous frigging piece of meat that look like it came off the biggest bull ever to walk the earth.  It was very thick, and had the bone still in.  Tender, juicy, and just absolutely the best I've ever had.  I also got a big giant dish of horseradish for it too.  It was amazing.  If you don't mind dining on the pricey side, and are in the mood for a steak, this is one of the very best places to get it.

We're old fashioned, a steak and potatoes ain't a Steakhouse meal UNLESS there's a fresh Caeser tossed in front of us where we can all watch the action.. our waiter Carl has the goods.  First heard about his skills via Yelp (*thanks Yelp!) so when we booked it, I had requested his services in my reservation.  We arrived and I hadn't been greet by Carl initially which made us all very, very uneasy.  We flew in just for this, you know, so finally after a good 3-4 minutes of awkward eye contact with my father and his lovers.. IT BEGAN!  'The-Beacon-of-Salad-Bowlsing' himself walks right up and just says it.. \"YOU BOYS READY TO GET TOSSED!!\". I got super wet in my mouth.. it was all happening so fast.  Out rolls the salad table and we all started grinning like children.. my father beat his fist on the table rhythmically and we started too... it was like slow boil that just started going NUTS!  We're here, he's here.. we're happy, he's happy!  Then he does it.. he grabs the bowl and spins it like he's a flipping Harlem Globetrotters, one of my father's lovers starts doing the Globetrotters whistle and Carl slams the bowl on the table shows us it's empty like a magician's hat then he pops out a bottle and does \"jerking\" motion then starts spraying the bowl with this pearly off white Caeser dressing.  My eyes rolled ALL the way back and I gripped the seat hard.  He flipping in the greens and I swear I heard classical music while he got to work!  I said \"YOU'RE THE MASTER... WHHHOOOOAAA!\"  Being ever the humble creeper, he goes.. \"a Master, you mean this idiot massaging these leafy greens with my tiny digits that always smell like a b-hole\" (then he said \"coincidentally\" while doing air quotes, smelled his Caeser dressing smoothed fingers and flipping winked).  The guy gots flare, who could deny it... seamlessly dancing his spinach shovels in and out while eye-raping the lady's neckline at the table behind us.  I challenged him by saying that he might do better if he became versed in something other than tossing stranger's salad while they're in Vegas.  He said his father did, his father's father did and it's just in his blood.",

    "text": "My friend and I went, mostly based on the mythos surrounding Sinatra and his coterie. We both figured it would be decent enough. We called to confirm our reservation and to see if Frank's booth was attainable. The hostess said we had a good shot, but that the evening hostess was different. That excited us, two Italians and Sinatra fans. As the cab pulled up we got worried. Looks like a strip bar in a strip mall, with blaring yellow placards. Upon entry we were greeted by the maitre'd, a hybrid of Alice Cooper and Vangelis, and a hostess who seemed like she thought herself a prosecutor at Nuremberg when we asked for Frank's booth. We let it go, hoping to receive a meal good enough to erase our initial treatment. We followed Igor back to our booth, a red leather wrap around older than either of us. Soon enough our waiter announced himself, in barely intelligible English. We ordered crab cakes to start. I also got the filet mignon, termed here \"the aristocrat of tenderness.\" The crab cakes arrived. Garnished with cocktail sauce and mayo, they had the appearance of breaded urinal cakes. Alas, they likely had worse flavor. First bite impression: undercooked batter. I got no hint of crab. It took immense will power to choke one and a half down. The filet was okay, but came rare, not medium rare as ordered. No sauce, either. Acceptable, but not at $48. We ordered dessert, just hoping that would be good. I asked for bananas Foster. The preparer worked table side, occasionally engaging in feeble attempts at humor. For $15 I got a sliced banana, cheap liquor, and a scoop of generic ice cream. When it came time to pay, $100 plus per including tip, we found out they don't do separate checks. I guess the POS system is circa 1958. I can accept a shoddy meal. Not at $100. That's terrible. Banking on Old Blue Eye's past patronage is pathetic. If this is what they served the Rat Pack and no one had their knees broken...This could be a cool place. They need to ditch the staff, shoot the cook, remodel the place, and not dishonor the Rat Pack. I am tempted to throw out my Sinatra collection.",

Quality old fashioned. Not fancy. Just right with whiskey and a little sweet.   House bread basket is the bomb. Garlic bread is a little over rated.   Cool place to visit in Vegas!  We will come again with friends!",

Upon arriving I was surprised to learn that it was owned by the same person who owned Chateau Vegas.( closed many years ago) Our favorite restaurant! Old school Las Vegas. Waiters wear tuxes, excellent service. My husband ordered a filet with a mushroom side. The  steak was cooked to perfection, mushrooms were delicious, with a brown gravy sauce. I ordered the Veal Marsala. The sauce was very good, but much to my dismay, the veal was very tough. Not pounded at all! Such a shame. I will definitely go back and try another entree. Don't let the outside of the building scare you away, please try it.",

Neither had been allowed to rest properly. (It had taken well over an hour to be served from the time we actually ordered, so no excuse there).  We did not send them back because we had already been there so long.                                                             The potato was so overcooked, it was brown and actually burned on bottom.     The $4 peppercorn sauce was a lump of cold brown gravy with peppercorns stirred in. It had to be dipped out of the gravy boat and spread like jam onto the steak. Not how I make mine by any stretch.                                 Good point---the ONE roll we were offered was delicious.                                                    We were in Vegas on a business not pleasure trip, for several nights. The night before we had a $30 meal at a hotel restaurant, and then the next night a $300 meal at this restaurant.  The first meal was much better in quality, service, and experience.   We will go back there. We will not be back at the Steer.",

On the downside, it's not the easiest to get to (parking can only be accessed from one lane of a divided highway), and the menu is overpriced.  For steak in this town I still prefer the (chain) options of Fogo de Chao or Smith & Wollensky",

He told all about the history of the restaurant & showed us around to the \"mob room\" and other famous booths, including the Rat Pack. We ordered the seafood stuffed mushroom caps to start. Delish! Then we had the Table side Caesar salad which was truly amazing and big enough for two. I ordered lobster and my husband got a ribeye. We shared the creamed corn- hands down the best I've ever had- and a twice baked potato and bottle of wine. It wasn't cheap. I think our bill was around $225. That's what you'd get on the strip without the history and incredible service. SO happy we came to Golden Steer. We can't wait to go back and take out of town visitors.",

Looked for a steak house and thought why not, let's give Golden Steer a try, lots of history and old...like me. I'm actually older by a couple years Inside was old fashion decor of years past, very inviting and a nice ambiance. Waiters and servers were very friendly.  Ordered the combo New York and Lobster dinner. The lobster was fantastic, the steak was just a bit overcooked from what I ordered, wanted medium rare, got medium. My waiter was more than happy to get me a new one but, I struggle with throwing a good piece of meat away. It was only a little overcooked and I thanked him for the offer. One of the most incredible taste is the table side made Caesar salad. They make the dressing right in front of you, super fresh and OMG flavor. Best ever. The French onion soup is very good as well. So when I start eating my dinner, things take a turn. They make an incredible Bananas Foster table side. And a few tables away was one being made. To start with they light a firework sparkler thing, like a fountain. Really nice for show but, it filled the entire room with a horrible sulfur smelling smoke. I mean it lingered for 10 minutes plus. Completely ruined my experience eating my meal. My nostrils and my taste buds where ruined for the night. From what I hear, on a busy night there could be 40 of these things going off during your meal. So sorry to give a not too impressive review but for the money, you didn't match my expectations.",

    "text": "Oh Golden Steer, I totally have a crush on you!  The Golden Steer is such a throwback to Old School Vegas.  When you walk through the front door, you are transported back to the 1950s.  Back in the 50s and 60s, this was THE place to go for a great steak dinner.  When you are eating, you keep looking over your shoulder to see if Frank Sinatra or Sammy Davis Jr. had just walked in.  It is just way too cool in my book.  So back in the old days of Vegas, all of the Vegas Elite came here and had their own table.  If you were anyone, you had a table with your name on it saving your seat.  This is one of the cool leftovers from that era still in the restaurant.  You can request to sit at Elvis', Marilyn Monroe, Dean Martin (my favorite Rat Packer, oh Dean-o I love you!), and numerous other celebrity tables.  My mom is the biggest Elvis fan in the world, so when I took her here for her birthday last year and got the Elvis table, she almost cried.  It is fun to have something fun in common with a superstar from yesteryear, in if it is just sitting at the same table at a great restaurant.  On top of the coolness factor, the steaks speak for themselves too.  I mean when the smallest steak on the menu is 12oz, you know you are in for a feast!  Last time I was here, i ordered the Prime Rib and it came out on its own plate because there was no room for anything else on the plate.  The Prime Rib was even hanging over the side in more than one place.  I only made a small dent in it and ended up taking it home and it turned into 2 more meals at home.  Now that is some serious MEAT.  Yum and drool all at the same time.  Another awesome aspect of this restaurant is the table side service for the desserts.  This is one of the only places left in the world that does flaming Cherries Jubilee and Bananas Fosters at your table, flames and all.  It is such a fun time watching your server make your dessert right there for you.  And seriously, how doesn't like desserts on fire right in front of you?  My absolute favorite part of this place is if you can go on a slow night when the owner is on property.  The owner is this very nice lady who will make friends with you as soon as she meets you.  I have been several times and she will always come by and just sit down with us at the table.  She will tell you all sorts of stories about interesting things that has happened at the place.  There are even some ghost stories about the place.  And yes, weird stuff still happens there.  BOO!  Now that is a fun dinner to have, steaks and ghosts!  So if you want to experience Old Vegas, eat a huge steak, have a flaming dessert, and maybe get spooked by a spook, this is your joint.  Go check it out and support a local legend.",

    "text": "I brought my family here while they were visiting from Pennsylvania as their one steakhouse experience for this trip. We've had good luck in the past but this was a big miss. The service was actually really bad, I'm not sure if our servers had more tables than normal or if they just weren't attentive but the reasont doesn't really matter. As a reference, it was bad in the way that three of the four of us were sitting with no drinks for well over 15 minutes during the meal.   We ordered three prime ribs and one filet. I was told the filet was excellent however, the prime rib was on par with the ones you can get for $12.99 in downtown Vegas. It had little to no seasoning and it was not tender whatsoever, more chewy than anything with the fat being hard and congealed rather than moist.   I wouldn't recommend this place at all considering it's at the same price point as any Strip steakhouse.",

    "text": "We went there with a group of people of about 25. our section was pre-booked, so they knew in advance to expect a rather large group of people. Our table was the first one the waiter took the order from. After a long wait, about 45 minutes, we noticed that everyone was served and eating but our table. So I complained to the waiter who then rushed off and got our food as well and gave us some fried Ravioli for free. Nice touch, but too little too late. I had the chicken which was very nice. Two others on my table had the crab cakes which were soggy and fishy, just awful. We were not able to eat them. This restaurant is overrated. It is only making money, because Elvis and the rat pack used to hang out there. There is nothing special about their food. Well, the prices are special, especially high! If you want good food (steak), good service and a very nice view, check out Binion's Steak House downtown!",

I had the jumbo shrimp cocktail that was soft mushy and the cocktail sauce came with a small bottle of hot sauce with no sign of horseradish it all. This was about the worst shrimp cocktail I ever had. Another person in our party had a garden salad with the house dressing that wasn't very tasty to them. We ordered drinks and the ginger ale and coke was flat and the Jack Daniels was weak tasting. \"How can you mess up Jack n Coke\". Someone in Our group also had a beer that had a funny aftertaste. The dinner was average not living up to the statement of \"World's Best Steakhouse\" however we will not return to this nightmare ever! I would seek another place to eat dinner. Our group only had two out of two that enjoyed their meals and one only had a vegetable dish!",

I am a local and have been to the Golden Steer on multiple occasions and never go home disappointed.  The staff is always friendly and the steaks are always a good quality cut.  The best part of this place, besides the meat, is the history.  For the out of towner's, this is the place where the Rat Pack used to eat and hang out after playing a show at the Sahara, what is now the SLS.  This is also where the Goodfella's used to hang out and eat.  If you ask the staff, they will be more than happy to recall countless stories about either.  Anytime someone is in town visiting, I take them here.  There are a million cookie cutter steakhouses on Las Vegas Blvd., but there's only one Golden Steer.  **There is one more thing I would like to add.  If there is something you do not like during your visit to the Golden Steer, try to bring it up to the management.  The staff at the Golden Steer take a lot of pride in what they do, but it's very difficult to change or correct an issue if they do not know something is wrong.  This restaurant has been in business for decades, and hopefully it will continue to serve Vegas for decades more.**",

Among the best pieces of steak I have ever had, in such a beautiful setting. What a find!!  Caesars salad made fresh, from scratch (including the dressing) right in front of you. Do not leave without ordering one. Best Caesar salad ever.  Outstanding service. Polite, kind, diligent, and enthusiastic waiters in tuxedos who LOVE their jobs. Our waiter had been there some 20+ years I think, and many of the others looked like they had seniority. He was so passionate about the restaurant, the owners and the food. I love that!  LOVELY ambiance. Oh how deceiving the outside is. The restaurant is off the strip in a strip mall with no windows. I was scared to walk in. Walked in , and loved it. Old hollywood indeed. And tuxed out waiters to top it off.     Finally the food. Porterhouse was OUT OF THIS WORLD. Amazing. Juicy. Perfect. Generous portion... Great for sharing.  Nothing more you can ask for. And with the groupon, the price was even great. Although with everything they offer, I'd go back in a heart beat, and pay full price... If I lived in Vegas :(",

Muhammad Ali celebrated his birthday here, the Rat Pack, Marilyn and Joltin Joe . . . LOVE IT!    You wanna know what I hate about Vegas?  How they import great restaurants from other parts of the country.  I don't want to eat at Nobu in Vegas.  I want to go to Malibu for that.  I don't want to eat at Carmine's in Vegas.  I want to eat at the one on 44th St in NYC with theatre tickets in hand.  I don't want the replica, I want the gawdamn original.  And that's what Golden Steer is.  Over 50 years.  est1958.  A Vegas original.  For those complaining about the service, you've gotta understand where you are.  You don't trot your significant other or your family into Golden Steer on a Friday night and expect rush service.  If you do expect that, then go to Black Angus.  This isn't 'dinner,' it's an event.  Soak it in.  Chill for a couple hours.  Actually chew your food.  Order dessert.  Extend the evening.  Experience it.    I've found the cooler you treat the staff, the faster and more pleasantly they serve you.  We were joking with our servers, taking pics with one server who looked like De Niro, and tipped the shit out of em.  We were there for a couple hours.  We loved it.  It was incredible.  All 8 steaks cooked perfectly.  If it's overcooked, send it back and grab another drink.  Sure beats a ruined evening while you quietly bitch about an overcooked steak and tell your fellow diner(s) how you can't wait to get on Yelp and destroy them.  Smile once in a while.  This legendary place rocks.  Bon appetit, bitches.",

We only saw our waiter to greet us, take our order, and ask us for dessert.  We order the \"famous\" garlic bread to start. It was extremely \"crumby\" and pretty tasteless.   Each of us ordered some kind of steak or prime rib. The meat was okay. Nothing to write home about. We also ordered the \"world's largest baked potato\". Again, nothing special here. One of our other sides was sauteed mushrooms. Unbeknownst to us, they are mushroom buttons and not sliced mushrooms.   The final time we saw our waiter, he was there to ask us if we wanted dessert....he REEKED like an ashtray. It was clear he had just finished a smoke break. He absolutely STUNK. And when he brought our bill, he had double charged us for the garlic bread (I mention this because after reading other Yelp comments, this seems to be a recurring problem).  If you want a great steakhouse which is worth it's weight in gold, go to Hugo's Cellar at Four Queens or Hank's at Green Valley Ranch. I promise you won't over pay for what you are getting.  This was a huge disappointment for us. We were really looking forward to this restaurant.",

We patronized the Golden Steer for our wedding anniversary and were not disappointed. The food is very good.  We had the prime rib with whipped potatoes and Caesar salad.  The salad was the best Caesar I had in years, the potatoes very good.  The prime rib was good, but not great.  I don't hold it against the place as you never really know how a whole roast is texture wise all the way through.  I would have preferred a touch more seasoning but that is personal preference.    I would highly recommend going there for the entire experience.",

I had prime rib and it came out cold, my baked potato's skin was rock hard, the chef knew it (the waiter confirmed) and sent it out anyway.  Yes, I could have complained and sent it back but I shouldn't have to ever be disappointed at a restaurant that charges $55 for a la carte steak and $110 for surf and turf.  It is on the staff to make 100% sure stuff is right before it goes out.  I will never be back and I recommend you find a different steakhouse to enjoy....you won't have any trouble in this town.",

We had to make a few changes with the time and the number in our party and they were very accommodating.  On arrival, they put us in a private room in the back, which was a nice surprise.  We were told that this was the room used by the \"bosses\" back in the day who had to come in and out through the back door.    We had a team of servers including the Robert DeNiro impersonator that hangs around.  We started out with the the seafood appetizer which was a mix of shrimp, oysters, crab, etc.  All of which was fresh and delicious.    This time, I went with the New York Strip which was cooked to perfection, as expected.  Out of all 12 in our group, there was not a single complaint and compliments all around.  The price tag is steep, but worth it.  Everything was great down to the food and the service.  A must do in Vegas if you are a meat connoisseur",

    "text": "The Golden Steer is a total old school Vegas steakhouse experience. We decided to go on a whim and had no problem making same day reservations.   The Steer is located on Sahara between the I-15 and Las Vegas Blvd in a strip mall. It doesn't look like much on the outside but the inside is quite a surprise. Walking through the double wood doors you are taken back to old Vegas, I expected to see Frank and Sammy walk in any minute. The dark red booths, steer horns over the doorway and pictures of the rat pack and famous celebrities who have tables in their honor.   We were seated at Sammy Davis Jr's table with a signed picture of the Rat Pack on the wall behind us. Our server Scott came right over to welcome us and take our drink orders. For dinner we decided on the caesar salad, the 22 oz bone in rib eye, the twice baked potato and creamed spinach. The Steer has many table side preperations such as the caesar salad, chateaubriand, dover sole as well as desserts.   Brian came over with his cart to prepare our table side caesars. Everything is made from scratch using an egg yolk, fresh garlic, EVOO and parmesan cheese. Although I wished it was served a little colder, it was one of the best caesars Ive had. Shortly after, the rest of the dinner arrived. The ribeye was cooked perfectly medium rare as ordered. I thought the quality was good, but Ive had much better steaks in my life. The twice baked potato was excellent with lots of cheese and bacon. The creamed spinach had an odd anise flavor that we did not care for and the spinach was barely warm so we sent it back.   For dessert we chose the table side bananas foster. At $30 for two I was expecting much more. Brian came back with his cart and started cooking the bananas with brown sugar and rum. He scooped it on to vanilla ice cream and set the dish in front of us. We were waiting for the second one but the one dish was for the two of us. It was quite small and way overpriced for bananas and ice cream although it was very good.   The ambience and history here is 5 stars. Service was also excellent and we enjoyed our table side preparations. Waters were always refilled without asking. I will definitely return, especially with out of town guests so they can experience \"old Vegas\" themselves.",

The host and what might have been the manager could definitely do some stepping up with their customer service. Upon arrival, the manager & host seemed annoyed that I was checking in, I arrived earlier than my reservation and she stated they wouldn't sit me until my reservation time which is fair but her tone and body language was unprofessional. When we sat (after my scheduled time) we found out ONE person would not make it (in my party) she visibly expressed her annoyance by rolling her eyes and giving us her back then proceeded to hand us the menus. I won't use her unprofessional manners against the quality of the food. My steak was great & Caesar salad on point! Our waiter was great.",

    "text": "I've been looking forward to coming here for a long time- brought my mother from out of town to have dinner on a weeknight, two hours before a show. The old-school Vegas vibe totally got her into the vacation spirit, and the food was pretty good, but unfortunately the service marred our evening.  Ordered the escargot appetizer ($16) - they were okay, it wasn't the best version I've had, and server did not replenish the bread so that we could enjoy the herbs and oil. Maybe we should have had the seafood-stuffed mushroom caps our server recommended. We had the Caesar salad for the table, prepared tableside ($12/pp) - was disappointed that no anchovies were used in the preparation considering the price, but I liked the croutons. Found it odd that the salad guy did not make eye contact, speak to us, or engage with us at all? Awkward. We waited an hour for our entrees- the Chicken of the Angels (egg battered chicken with artichokes and mushrooms), was incredible, tender and moist without being too heavy. The prime rib (rare as requested, with both fresh horseradish and horseradish cream) was decent, but the creamed spinach  was wayyy too rich.  Our server was absent for the majority of our visit, and was condescending when he was around. He asked for our order twice within 5 minutes of being seated, then copped an attitude when we asked where our food was after an hour of waiting. We let him know we had plans and he was rude about it instead of apologetic. His attitude was completely unnecessary and just made the experience even worse. After we wolfed down our entrees, he took his time coming back and getting our check- I had planned to order dessert, but he took so long that it wasn't an option.   Then, he stood over my shoulder and pointed at the gratuity chart and stared me down as I entered his tip! Completely uncalled for, unprofessional, and disrespectful. Bringing the portable card reader to the table is a tacky move in the first place but there's a way to handle it professionally, and this wasn't it. I was so embarrassed to have picked this spot for my mom to experience a nice dinner on vacation- she commented that even the sports bar we'd gone to the night before had superior service compared to this place.",

    "text": "To wrap up the foodie portion of my recent Vegas adventure, a friend of mine suggested my boyfriend and I join him at the oldest steakhouse in Vegas: The Golden Steer Steakhouse. I was swimming in visions of going to the trendier, newer restaurants on the strip but decided to roll with his suggestion to treat ourselves and experience old Vegas.   Our hotel happened to the be on the Northern part of the strip, which is where the restaurant is as well. I was feeling slightly apprehensive as this is the least active part of the strip and the venue is part of a tiny strip mall but as the old saying goes, never judge a book by its cover.  Walking in, it was like we were transported to 1950's Vegas. The venue isn't by any means touristy but rather the entire place was kept as it always has been (for the most part) and the servers were dressed up, photos of old Hollywood stars and musicians are scattered across the walls and the booths were delightfully old school (we sat opposite of Marilyn Monroe's go-to booth!). The decor was vintage and the ambiance was sophisticated and cool.  Menus were large in size and the prices meant business - especially since this was also suppose to be the best steakhouse in Vegas. We had one main server while others tended to our drinks and set up our table for each course. There was clearly a team effort happening behind-the-scenes and our main sever was extremely polite and patient answering our questions on the different cuts they offered and helping us make a decision.   Much to my wallet's dismay, I went with the $44 8oz petite filet mignon. They would not serve it medium rare but instead served it medium well. For each preference as to how we liked it cooked to how the food is typically prepared, our server went into great detail as to what we would expect. When my PFM arrived, it was exactly what he said it would be, except juicier. My boyfriend ordered the same as I did and my friend ordered the $40 10oz Prime Rib of Beef: English Cut. That of course was fatty but still very enjoyable and absolutely massive - he couldn't even finish it.  To share, we turned down their famous Caesar salad - which is made in front of every table - and instead enjoyed mashed potatoes and 2 pieces of broccoli so large you would think they were on steroids.  Since we spent the day abusing the Daquirri bars, the boyfriend and I opted to not have wine.  This was a shame as most people know you can enjoy a fine red wine with this meat but at least one of us was able to navigate their extensive wine list and order a glass of red.    In between bites, I took advantage to check out the scene around me. The people dining were older than us but not quite baby boomers and the music, like the venue, was old school. Trolleys would roll by and servers put on a sort of show making each salad and serving it - think old school steakhouse meets your favorite Mexican place that makes the guac right in front of you. Other people chose not to enjoy the steaks but enjoy the Italian and Seafood options instead. Once the meal was over, we were able to pay cash and with two cards (despite the ominous one check per table request) and looked over the dessert menu. Though we had no room for dessert, it did not look worth over stuffing myself for as they mostly covered the basics (think creme brulee). In the end, it was totally worth the splurge and made me appreciate Vegas  for what it used to be before all the glitzy celebrities of the new Millennium took over. The only real hurdle was not finding transportation there - because there are so many hotels and Ubers - but leaving. Cabs don't seem to frequent this part of the strip so you may want to call ahead, download Uber/Lyft whatever or simply wait.",

We were celebrating an anniversary and I requested the frank Sinatra booth. I was bummed that no one acknowledged our anniversary or even asked if we were celebrating anything special. We like to go to Echo & Rig in Tivoli village. It's our favorite but I convinced my husband to try something new. The filet was good, not great. My lobster tail was over cooked. The crab cocktail was very good. For the price point I thought the service should be more welcoming. At Echo & Rig they actually remember your name or if you are celebrating an anniversary and make it a special occasion every time you dine. We won't come back because of this.",

Both of our steaks came out wrong. You would think a place that has been cooking steaks for about half a century could get a steak cooked to temperature. I will note that the prices are definitely a bargain as compared to the modern steakhouses on the strip. Anyway, the whole experience was a disappointment.

It's been here since 1958, I moved to Vegas in 1992 and unfortunately it took me until 2018 to get here. Too bad I didn't come sooner. I ordered the Lobster Thermidor, an old school dish that was absolutely delicious. The lobster was cooked perfectly and as for the sauce, they could have brought me a bowl of it. The rest of our party ordered filets and asparagus. We also shared the table side Caesar salad. The steaks were cooked perfectly, and it was nice to have old school service with the salad. After dinner we ordered the Bananas Foster, also prepared table side. Once it hit the table, it disappeared quickly.  Topped off with great service. A great dining experience in Las Vegas.",

It let's you peek into the rat pack era, without the fabrication.   This was my third trip to Golden Steer.  I Started with a Dirty Martini which was very good. As a tradition, I ordered the Oysters on the half, which were fresh but less tasty then previous dinners. The plump shrimp cocktail made up for the oysters. I ordered the bone in ribeye (usually my favorite cut), but also had some of the wifes filet. I would do the filet here. Both were seasoned well. The sides (creamed spinich, wild rice) were just so so.   The service was excellent, like each visit. I most like this place for the atmosphere, steak and service, but rate it 4 overall.  The strip mall location doesn't fit today's vegas. (to be fair, they cant move it. Its the oldest steakhouse in vegas).  But if you don't want that manufactured, trying to look old school steakhouse, look past the exterior and try it.",

We weren't dressed to the nines but we were a lil casual considering a steak house. I always find the staff at steakhouses to be generally awkward and overly in your face helpful. The service towards us as opposed to the other table was the exact opposite. Not sure if it's the way we looked or maybe he didn't think we had $. Either way service was a 1 star rating and food was a 3.5 star. For the price I wase expecting a lot more. Ceaser salad was great. They make it in front of you but you have to get ceaser for at least 2 people. Food was good not great. They do bananas foster flambouyed in front of you. I'd rather go to any restaurant on the strip and pay strip prices with a view then go here.",

    "text": "I don't see what the big deal is about this place.  In Vegas for a trip away from the wives, we ended up at this old school steakhouse.  It started off well when the bellman at the hotel complimented us on our choice for dinner.  When we got to the restaurant, it was a bit bland outside. Picture a generic and plain front with the strip mall look.  We were seated into a booth, Mickey Rooney's!, and looked around to find a pretty empty room. It was a Thursday night at 7pm so we expected a bit more traffic in there.  The service was attentive enough (even when the waiter spilled a beer on the seat next to me).   Come to think of it, he apologized but provided nothing more than getting me an extra napkin to get the beer from the seat and my pants. I didn't press it as much as I should have.   An omen of things to come?  We skipped the starters since nothing was jumping out as us so we focused on the mains and sides.  Josh got the prime rib. I got a T-bone.   Neither of us were happy.   Both were ok to start, not bad, but not at all worth the price. We never felt that it was the best piece of meat we ever got in at a restaurant.    There were no happy plates.  (Moreover, we both felt a little \"off\" after finishing.)  For the sides, we got broccoli, sauteed mushrooms, and the whipped potatoes. I can't speak for the little trees but the mushrooms were good enough while the potatoes were too buttery. I only tasted butter.  Our intention was there to try something off the strip and something historic. Next time in Vegas, and there always be a next time, I'll find some other old school place.  So, skip it.   (I rounded up to 2 stars due to the fact it's been around so long.)",

As I looked around, all the other tables were marked with famous actors' names. Whenever a certain actor comes into the restaurant to eat, they get to eat at their table. It's pretty neat. Clint Eastwood's table was right across from ours, so I went over there and sat down. It sounds weird, but it was kind of cool to be sitting at Clint Eastwood's table and where he had sat and dined.  The restaurant has an old fashioned feel to it. It has wood paneling and the lights are dimmed down with Sinatra playing in the background. All the staff were wearing tuxedo's. Don't worry though, I ate in t-shirt and shorts. I felt a little out of place.  The first thing that really impressed me was that when we ordered their famous Caesar salad, the waiter mixed the dressing and lettuce right in front of us. It was one of the best salads that I've had in a long time.  If you love prime rib, this is the place to go! The Golden Steer is famous for it and they do not disappoint. When I cut through the steak, it felt like butter. The steak was cooked perfectly and I can say without a doubt, that it was the best prime rib that I've ever had.  Coupled with the history and the outstanding food, I can't think of better dining experiences. Every time someone asks me for a dining suggestion in Vegas, I always mention this restaurant. It is a little out of the way, but it is the perfect getaway to the hustle and bustle of the strip.",

Upon entering and being intimidatrd by thr dress code enforced sign we weren't greeted at all. After finding someone to recognize us we were seated and I immediately tried to redeem my Groupon. FYI my phone was acting up in this place so make sure you are able to pull up your groupon prior to ordering. We asked the waiter about their combo meals and holy wow they were almost all 100$ or more. Way more expensive than any other Steakhouse I've been to before. We ordered garlic bread and twice baked potato because of good reviews but I was sorely unimpressed. For $5 we got 3 pieces of dry garlic bread that was crumbly and overseasoned. The free bread is a wayyyyyyyyyy better deal. My gf and I ordered filet mignon which cam out burnt on the outside sitting in a pool of brown water w a single leafy garnish. Worst plating I have seen thus far. They do get one star because the center of my meat was pretty decent. The twice baked potato reminded me of the kind you can buy at the store in the freezer section and microwave. It was dry dry dry and just yuck! I didn't finish mine at all. During our meal we were sort of ignored by all of the staff which is quite odd as they spent plenty of time yacking to an elderly couple right next to us. The bill came and low and behold the guy that took our Groupon forgot to remove it from our bill. Even with a Groupon I thought I overpaid. I have to agree with others saying this place has old school prices for food that I guess is catered towards old people? As a local I will never be back nor refer anyone to this outfit.",

Both ok...not bad but nothing special. Wine list was just ok. Nothing was bad but the prices were similar to higher end steak restaurants and food just wasn't that good. I'd prefer to go to Del Friscos or several other places. The live piano/singer in the bar was nice.",

Unfortunately, our entrees came while still eating our. Salad and they hovered tableside until we were done with the salad. My filet, ordered butterflied wasn't and they twice tried to clear while we were still eating. Overall, it was good, but there were several small mistakes and they rushed us like no tomorrow.  Done and out in less than 50 minutes.  For their prices, you should be able to savor the meal longer.",

    "text": "Well, I wasn't expecting much when I came here -- oldest steakhouse in Vegas? Old rat-pack haunt? They can pretty much phone it in -- which the waiters do, or did on this particular night. But while the service and starters were crap, the steak really was wonderful. I was pleasantly surprised after such a poor start. I had a bone-in rib-eye, packed with flavor and tender. Friends enjoyed their fillet mignon as well. The steaks made up for the whole night. The asparagus and mash were pretty decent, though the cream of spinach was watery and the worst I've had anywhere.   I came for the experience as much as the food and it was 'interesting,' in a good way There was a Marylin lookalike kicking around, and a sign above our booth told us Joe DiMaggio used to eat where we were sitting. Still a formal dining experience but with a bit of kitsch thrown in.   Is it possible for waiters to be very nice and act like they don't give a crap at the same time? Pretty much what they managed here. We got no service for a half hour and then four guys came by in quick succession. One waiter told us he was from Belarus (I think) and then a Mexican waiter came by, and then the Belarus guy came back and said, 'You're all white folks so don't listen to what the Mexican says'. He was joking, they were friends, I guess, but it was inappropriate enough to add to the surreal humor of the evening.  I wouldn't rush back because of the service and the sides/starters -- the salad and calamari we started with were decidedly average -- but really, the steak saved it and got them from 2 stars to 3. And that's what you go there for after all.",

Everyone from the hostess to the bartender and waiters are actually glad that you went out of your way to stop by the Steer.   This place IS old school Vegas, table side salads, deep red leather booths and waiters in formal wear.  Start with a martini (gin, vermouth, olive) and enjoy a good experience.  The wine list has some nice selections at reasonable prices ($30-45). The menu has a nice selection of both beef and Italian. I'm a fan of the prime rib.",

I will say the waiters are still very attentive and full of stories about the glory days of the Golden Steer - we heard our waiter tell 4 tables the same story. The decor fairly rundown but you can overlook it at times to try and get into the spirit of old Las Vegas.  The food tonight just plain not good and far too expensive for what it was.  The shortcuts are evident and the quality compeltely gone.  The frozen lobster tail was $100.  The New York steak had a prime rib au jus poured on top that shouldn't be there and on top of that was so obviously from a powdered packet that it was insulting.  The waiter suggested a twice baked potato that tasted like it had been in the refrigerator since my last visit two years ago. The whole experience made me sad as we are obviously losing another Vegas landmark, as return customers at this time must be few and far between. Bottom line we could have spent the same money or less at Botero or Scarpetta and been wowed by the food - truth is being mugged for the $500 would have been less painful then this meal.",

No sooner were we seated that we were asked what we wanted to drink and what we wanted to order. I had to explain we were in no hurry to order dinner, wanted a drink first. While waiting for our one drink and bottle of wine, two more servers appeared to ask for our order.  Finally we gave in, not even 1/2 way through our drinks. Caesar salad still served tableside, server overdid the oil so all you tasted was oil. Ordered the filet, medium rare, was served to me raw+, sent it back and within seconds (no time whatsoever) to cook was served to me again and yep, raw, couldn't even cut it with a knife. Seriously? The best steakhouse in Las Vegas...not anymore. Decided not to chance a 3rd time. The baked potato was a baked potato. The bearnaise that was served with the first filet, sat there and got cold while someone in the kitchen attempted to cook the filet to medium rare.  The veal parmesan was adequate. Nothing special so much sauce you couldn't see the veal. They did remove the filet from our check and offered dessert but by that time we were so aggravated we paid our bill and left. Nothing like it used to be with the exception of the restaurant itself. Lastly, they need to get some servers who speak English. Don't bother, go to CUT inside the Palazzo.",

The facade looks like a cheesy run down Vegas spot, but inside the rich burgundy leather seating, crisp white linens, dim-but warm lighting, and pleasant atmosphere is anything bust cheesy and run down. The service is spectacular, the food is nothing less than perfect, and the over all experience is great. Locals and regular visitors alike love and frequent this place. On the more expensive side, but worth the price, the Golden Steer is a place where you are likely to find a high profile public figure or celebrity at the next table. It's a great place to treat yourself or your travel companions to a special dinner with your gambling winnings.",

I ate here, after hearing about all of the great stories about this place.  The staff is quick to tell you about all of the famous people that ate there including the infamous Chicago mobster Tony \"The Ant\" Spilatro, but how does that make this pace special?  Ok, if your on a date it is a really nice atmosphere that kind of takes you back to the old days, but the food is a \"let down\"  The rib-eye is good, but for $40 bucks, my God!  Not worth it!  Trust me when I say Morton's has a much better steak for the money.  However, the appitizers are excellent.  The escargot are done very well along with the oysters, and I must say the desert was fantastic!  The Cherries Jubillee I highly recomend as well as the bannanas foster.    So if you plan on stopping by and just getting a few appitizers along with desert with a date, this place is great.  If you plan on stopping by and getting a whole steak meal with the works, you will be dissappointed along with the two hundred dollar bill for two people!",

The prices were comparable to other high end steak restaurants. Drink orders were fill promptly but food orders took a little more time than expect for the amount of diners that were in the restaurant.  The server (his name was Jay) seemed pretentious and to have a classist attitude. I don't know if it was because we were the youngest ones in the place or not.  The waiters attitude wasn't bad enough to give this place a 3 star rating until we got our bill.  Our bill came (didn't have the our gratuity added to it yet) and it seemed right so I paid with a gift card.  When I got the charge slip back it showed my remaining balance on my gift card to be lower that it should have been.  I called my gift card to see how much was charged and it was $30 OVER what was printed on the charge slip.  We called the waiter over the inquire why my gift card was overcharged.  He said that the tip was already included in the bill.  I told him that he had no idea what we were going to tip and that gratuity was not automatically included with only a party of two.  He then got the manager who ran the card with my tip (which was 20% of the bill - $29.13) and said that it ran without a problem.  No apology given by the waiter or the manager was given.  This seemed highly dubious to me.  The pre-tip charge slip must have been printed and voided out and then reran for the higher amount.  It felt like the waiter was trying to guarantee himself a 20% tip without our knowledge.  The way the waiter and manager handled it felt like this fraudulent activity is a very common occurrence at this establishment.  My advice to anyone frequenting this establishment is to thoroughly inspect your bill and to pay CASH only.  It was an unfortunate event that ruined and otherwise pleasant dining experience.",

It has been open since 1958 and has a really great \"rat pack\" feel to it, which is appropriate considering Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis, Elvis, etc. came here often. Each table has a plaque behind it with a celebrity name of someone who dined at that spot; we sat at the Mickey Rooney table. Service is very professional with career waiters in tuxedos. One waiter has been there for 30 years. I had the prime rib, which is their specialty (they have a number of other beef cuts too). It was the best prime rib I have ever had...about an inch and a quarter thick and big. You will find a lot of classic steak house dishes here...tomato & blue cheese salad, creamed spinach, french onion soup, etc. All are very tasty and far more than routine. Most salads and desserts are made at your table by the waiters. The place has a very grown up vibe, not really a place for kids. Although there were a couple of people dining in shorts and t-shirts, I would advise guests to get in the spirit of the place; grow up and dress up! It's not cheap; prime rib alone is $35, add on all sides, appetizers & drinks, etc. Lobster and filet mignon combo was listed that night at $95. That said, I felt the experience was well worth it. I will definitely go back.",

This old school steakhouse is a True gem , simply the classic days of vegas ,with dim lighting ,rounded red and black booths surrounding the dining areas. Just to step into this time capsule  where the great performers of the past dined was truly a memorable experience especially from a change of pace from the newer overrated trendy joints.  The best steak I have ever had ( NY 16OZ )  along with a fantastic tableside prepared caesar salad and all the great side dishes.  Everything was outstanding  from the desserts,drinks , atmosphere as well as the friendly service  from all the staff which was top tier and of course our  many thanks go out  to Fernando , the Maitre d'  who entertained us with his funny humor  and out of this world hospitality . It was like a dinner and a show all in one as well as  some good laughs and conversation with some nice folks across the table from us . To sum it up , great food, great service and great feel of the ambiance of  old classic vegas .  It was a perfect dining experience to end the perfect weekend  .

I love the decor of this place. Lots of booths. Warm, dark and really really comfortable dim lighting.   The food. You ask?  Bone in ribeye - Soooo  gooood!!!! Cooked to medium rare perfection.very flavorful steak.   Filet - pink juicy center. Go meat.  Mushrooms - the sauce was awesome.   2x baked potato - its ok... this put our meal to  carbohydrate overload. I bit too much food I think for two people.   Overall, my experience here was pretty good. I'm pretty sure that I will be back.  Note: They have gaming machines at the bar.",

The atmosphere was some what like a old gangster classic joint. I'm really enjoying this. Ordered me a glass of red wine and of course had to try the prime rib if beef: diamond him cut 24oz cooked rare. Not the best prime rib I've had but gotta admit on my top 5 list. I would recommend this experience to anyone. Need more joints like this back home.",

It definitely doesn't look fancy on the outside but the inside is decorated with old celebrity photos, cozy, and extremely impressive! We ordered fresh oysters, and they were pretty good. Beware: their horseradish is no joke! It was good, but strong and unexpected. We also got the Caesar salad, which is prepared table side for two. Their steak is one of the best in town! They claim it's been the best since the 1950s, and they live up to the expectations. For a stand alone steak, with no fancy butters or seasonings, I recommend the golden steer. It is a great place for a date night, or close friends in an intimate environment. For dessert I reccommend the creme brulee...it's chocolate!",

I strolled in with my merry crew of hobos and drunkards lost in conversation.  We were seated in the deep warmth of vinyl plush cushions surrounded by history and glorious meat. But we were not swayed by these worldly temptations, we were focused on one thing and one thing only, that was Carl and his nimble delicate hands ready willing and able to commence the salad tossing extravaganza. A slight shiver and chill went down my spine as I sat there in anxious anticipation.  As the swirling and whirling of salad was tossed with the rich creamy sauce of Carls making, I was ready, ready to fork. All this salad tossing had me worked up. Each salad tossed made it's way to the table and i couldn't help myself, I started to fork one and then as I was near completion I started forking each ones tossed salad around me. I forked left and I forked right. Suddenly there was a frenzy of forking. I couldn't tell who was forking who and before I knew it the forking was over. The table was cleared and by the time the meat arrived we were all forked out. Alas jolly ole Carl came out with a smile and as the bill was paid we all looked at each other and knew we may never fork like this again.  But perhaps next time Carl,!perhaps next time.",

We would never have discovered this place on our own as it sits in a strip mall and seems less than outstanding in its exterior. But WOW! what a surprise on the interior! That old-time \"clubby\" feel of leather, dark woods and brass and seeing what the old-school RatPack saw in this place. We were seated in the Sammy Davis Jr.'s booth, which was black leather in a semi-circle, very cozy with my hubby! We had garlicky escargot to start with, yummy, then our choice of Ceasar Salad was prepared tableside, even the dressing!  So good. We had rib-eyes, with baked twice baked potatoes, and the creamed spinach was so \"over the top\" I had to be held down to keep me from getting the recipe in the kitchen! Because the atmosphere was so wonderful and our waiter so attentive, we decided to prolong the experience and ordered Bananas Foster, which was flamed and prepared tableside. It was indeed fabulous, met and exceeded our expectations. Yes, this place is pricey, but so worth it! And we will be back the next time we visit Las Vegas. During the entire week we spent in Vegas, this place and one other were the only ones we would come back to. And you know Vegas has a ton of good restaurants.",

    "text": "Wow! This is by far the BEST meal that I've ever had in Vegas. It made me regret spending $70 per person at Bacchanal Buffet in Caesar's the night before,  when I could've just come here for a higher quality meal. Everything was great, from the food to the service.  The Caesar's salad is made right at your table -- something that no other restaurant will do anymore because of health codes, but since the Golden Steer is the oldest restaurant in Vegas, it was grandfathered in. Freshly made Caesar salad is amazing and you can really taste the quality.  We started with the Seafood Platter and the King crab legs were so fresh and sweet that we didn't even need condiments. I got the filet and lobster combination and that came with a 16oz lobster!  I'm a huge seafood snob, and the lobster was clearly fresh and so succulent.  We ended with the creme Brule, which was pretty typical. Aside from the fresh and high quality seafood, I also loved how iconic the restaurant is.  We sat in Joe DiMaggio's personal booth, which is next to Clint Eastwood's booth and across from Marilyn Monroe's. It was also across the way from the rat pack's booth-- they used to come to the golden steer for drinks and food before their shows.  Very cool!  It was really neat to be in such a historic and iconic restaurant.  If you have the time and the funds, this place is definitely worth the experience. The host Mark and our server Tommy were splendid and ensured that we had a perfect dining experience. I will be returning!",

    "text": "Golden Steer Steakhouse is THE BEST steakhouse in Las Vegas and my family's personal favorite. Since the very first time we tried the oldest steakhouse in Las Vegas, we knew it would be our regular spot for special occasions and any day that ended in Y. We always always always ask for Tom because Tom gets it. We live in Las Vegas and have been in the service industry for many years so take it from us when we say the service is unmatched when we have Tom as our server. Frankly, the service is unmatched when Tom can't be our server but he's still in the building and coming over to our table knowing we requested him and checking in on us. Every time I send people to Golden Steer, I send them to Tom, and every time he doesn't disappoint. The most recent visit was just a couple of days ago and my friends were so impressed with the service that at one point someone said they totally expected someone from the waitstaff to come over with a toothbrush and clean our teeth. Let me not forget to mention the food. I don't really like prime rib, my husband loves prime rib. I now love prime rib at Golden Steer. We usually share the 24oz Jim Cut Prime Rib because the massive piece of meat that comes out to the table in all its perfection is more than enough to share between two people, especially when you order the largest baked potato in Las Vegas and the twice baked potato and a side of mushrooms. Don't forget to start with the fresh Caesar salad that they make table side for your enjoyment as well as starting with any of their amazing appetizers like the lump crab cakes or the toasted ravioli. Don't waste your time and money going to those heavily marketed, overpriced steakhouses on the strip. You want to try Golden Steer before your time in Las Vegas is over! Let them know if you're celebrating an event, they will make it a night you'll never forget!",

The service was average. There was nothing to write home about; for my money the Steak House at Circus Circus had similar ambience but far superior food and quality and yes, value for the money.",

    "text": "For my very first visit, I wanted to experience any vintage Las Vegas that still existed.  My research yielded the Golden Steer, and our experience was magnificent.  Away from the noise, hype, and over-priced cuisine of the strip, this classic 60s steakhouse has the decor, staff, menu, and presentation of a bygone era without being kitschy or fake.  It is completely authentic, from dark woods and red velvet chairs, to the western paintings and decor, to the low lighting and knowledgeable, friendly waiters in full tuxedos.  We enjoyed every second of it.  We intentionally ordered items prepared tableside, first Caesar salad and later Bananas Foster, so that we could be part of the experience and chat with the waiter.  He complimented our attire and my vintage necklace, saying it reminded him of a time when people knew how to  dress appropriately for dinner.  It made me smile, because that was exactly the experience we sought.  The wine list was classic and had plenty of great selections to accompany the menu.  The salad was flavorful and plentiful.  We chose escargot and Clams Casino as appetizers.  Both were delicious.  We did not soak up the escargot juices with the bread, but thinking back, I wish we had!  Our entrees were the 12oz filet and the T-bone with whipped potatoes and mushrooms as accompaniments.  I read one review that said the mushrooms were in a strange sauce, but I don't know where they got their taste buds.  They were perfectly sauteed in butter and garlic and full of flavor.  Had we not been in polite company, I am confident that my boyfriend would have chewed off what little meat remained on the bone when he finished!    For dessert, he had the chocolate cake, I had the Bananas Foster.  The preparation and end result were mouth watering!  The chocolate cake was good, nice and fudgy, but paled in comparison to the Bananas Foster.  Knowing that my boyfriend would inevitably steal some of mine, our waiter made us an extra large portion, so I could share.    I agree with the reviewer who noted that much of the charm and classic menu selections are lost on diners not old enough to remember the 60s.  If you want a 21st century experience, stay on the strip, but for those of us who were born in the 70s, but want to dine where Elvis, Frank, Dean, and Sammy dined, the Golden Steer hits the jackpot!",

    "text": "Let's start with the good things: escargot excellent; Caesar salad prepared table side one of the best of ever had, service excellent. Ambiance: Away from the noisy bar, excellent.  Now to \"not so good:\" I ordered my steak medium rare which, in all good restaurants means a \"warm red center\" and it came out rare to mooing. No big deal, mistakes happen. So I sent it back and 10 minutes later they brought me the same steak that had been reheated! C'mon guys, a fine dining restaurant knows that as soon as you cut into a steak the juices escape. I would expect a steak from a casino cafe to be reheated but not a fine restaurant! The steak should have been replaced with a fresh one, not reheated and dried out! Two people, 2 steaks, 2 baked potatoes, 1 shrimp cocktail and one escargot=$300.00! Definitely NOT worth the money.",

    "text": "Easily, Easily one of my favorite steak houses and restaurants in Las Vegas or pretty much anywhere!   Been here since 1958 and is just a touch off the strip. The look is very old school mafia style, but NOT musky or stale smelling. Great photos of patron celebrities from the past on the walls and just an awesome wait staff that know that have made their career to be there. IT matters to them that you get great service and an great experience in coming there.  Started off with cocktails, (which were made with tremendous care), and they were spectacular! Had a Caesar salad that they prepared in front of us and was amazing! We also got the calamari with homemade marinara sauce, which was decadent! I had the bone in ribeye and my wife had the Alaskan crab legs, - that she absolutely loved and my 10 year old son had the salmon - that he said was one of the best that he has had!   For desert we had tiramisu, which was phenomenal!    We randomly got seated in what ended up to be Muhammed Ali's favorite booth to sit in when he visited...  Such an awesome experience! We look forward to coming here again!",

My husband ordered the baked stuffed potato and the 22-oz bone-in ribeye while I had the 10 oz prime rib. They were both cooked the way we wanted them and ate to our hearts' delight.  We even had some left to go!. My hubby is already planning our next visit.That's how food it was!",

On Sahara, just west of Las Vegas Blvd, look for the golden cow and park in their tiny parking lot. Then walk past the red velvet ropes, and step into the vestibule where a vintage cappuccino machine greets you. Don't bother checking the year on your cell phone, it still is 2015, but not inside this joint.  An old fashioned bar with frosted bordered mirrors and a seasoned bar tender, who's probably got more stories than a library, takes your drunk order. Pricey? You bet-cha! Worth it? Yes please! The drinks go down smooth and before you know it, your party is escorted through the restaurant by the maitre-d who happily points out the famous Marilyn Monroe booth, Elvis Presley booth, etc etc.  Yes, every single employee in there takes pride in the restaurant as if it were their very own. I'm assuming the cooks do too because the steaks were cooked to perfection. There is a signature Caesar salad that is prepared table side, which was fun to watch, and tasted great. We skipped on dessert, but maybe next time we'll try one. Yes, there will be s next time.",

The history behind this establishment is very interesting as the Mobb used to frequent this restaurant often. The service was great our waiters were on point, yes you have to be patient as the other reviews stated. This is the kind of place you come to for dinner and sit and chat and enjoy the ambience and have some wine. We were there for 3 hours. The rib eye steak was cooked to perfection, oysters Rockefeller were delicious and the lamb chops were a favorite. It's dimly lit and old school decor with lots of historic memorabilia.

Nothing is cheap here, but that was already expected so no surprises there. We split the ceasar salad, made at the table. My husband liked it but I didn't care for it. Even though he went mild on the anchovies, all I could taste was fish. I got a giant baked potato for dinner, which was disappointing because all the fixings were dumped into and not on the side, and the cheese kind of tasted like government cheese. My husband got the ribeye steak and wished he would have got the prime rib. We will be back and try the seafood next time (although the crab legs were $62, so not that!).

Banana Foster is a must have if you have any room left after the meat feast. Forgot to mention the warm bread to start, so yummy.

I will say that the place was very busy which tells me at some point the service must have been great...  but I will tell you that the service that we received on our visit was the worst I have ever seen after waiting for over a half an hour past our reservation time they sat us next to a party of more than 10 people squeezed into a booth that was set up for at the most six people as stated we were celebrating our 25th wedding anniversary and didn't want to sit next to a party of this size as we wanted our privacy (keep in mind we asked For a private booth when we set the appointment) I got up and very nicely asked the manager on duty if there was a possibility to move us to a table not located with a big group of people The manager at this point seemed to get very irritated and asked me which table I would like to sit at...I explained to him that I would be more than happy to sit at any booth as long as there was not a huge group of people sitting right next to us At this point the manager stated that there was only eight people sitting next to us with an attitude in his voice I then stated that it doesn't matter if it's 8,10 or 12 people that we wanted privacy and that The hostess on the phone said it would be no issues When we had called two weeks earlier to set our reservation. Once the manager expressed to us that our business was not important to him or to the restaurant we decided that we did not want to spend our 25th anniversary there and I expressed to the manager how disappointed I was with how he handled the situation so as we gathered our coats and left the table he rudely and loudly expressed for us to have a great anniversary. I will say this that if my wife was not there with me I would've handled the situation much differently than I did.. but we went ahead and left without Incident. I will never go to this restaurant and I will let everybody that I know and anyone looking for a recommendation for a restaurant to never go to the Golden Steer.",

I have been going to Golden Steer in excess of 25 years and probably responsible for over $75,000 + in last 6 years from hosting private party's and recommendations. What a shame on a legendary place with so so much history.",

    "text": "The worst service in Las Vegas. I've had better service at McDonald's. At least the cashier at McDonald's asks if I would like fries with that. Not Golden Steer. The waiter doesn't want to talk to you. When your sideless dish arrives, before you can say, \"Where's my potato\", the waiter is gone, not to be seen again. Your beer is poured with the same finesse one uses to dump trash down a sink, and drink that beer slowly because it will be the last beer you'll be offered. In summary, if you want to eat at a restaurant with the worst service in Las Vegas, listening to the clientele boister about having posterior intercourse with a prostitute, Golden Steer is the place for you.",

It's old style Vegas and they do it really well...  aside from the video poker in the bar, but that's pretty standard in vegas... it does contrast sharply with the decor and ambiance...    The only thing I wouldn't order again is the lobster bisque, which I normally love.  It wasn't bad, it just wasn't spectacular.  We had the ceasar, which was a little over dressed, but made table side which is worth it.  And it tastes great, garlicy.  The bone in rib eye we shared but it was cooked perfectly.  Our table mates had the onion soup, which was great and not salty which is a problem with that soup often.  The roasted mushrooms which were a little weird but good, double baked potatoes and the filet.  We loved and will go back again.  So will they, I'm sure!!  Oh, and our service was perfect.  The waiter talked to us but wasn't annoying and they are on top of everything.  Loved it!",

It was clean, but very retro. My biggest complaint?  I ordered the petit filet with bernaise sauce, and was asked house or Caesar salad. Not add, just choose.... I ordered the Caesar, and it was very good, but I would only eat small amount so as not to ruin my meal. Guess what?  It was an a la carte item I would not have ordered..it was an additional. '$12.  I felt misled. Do I mind spending good money for good food?  Not at all...but I would not have not have spent $12 on something I knew I would not eat very much off.",

    "text": "A Vegas classic, opened in 1958, when it was across from the now burned down El Rancho, it is the oldest steakhouse in continuous operation in town.  The walls are covered with photos of celebrities and gangsters, plus a new one of of our current mayor and her husband, the former mayor and mob lawyer.  Ask for the room in the rear, as the lighting is a little lower and the wood paneling a little richer.  We had the Shecky Green booth at the far back and I will remember to ask for it again.  Our waiter, Fabian, was just right, no hovering or \"I'll be your server today\" prattle, but always just a little way off when we needed him.  And the steaks were fabulous.  My rib eye covered the whole plate. Succulent and marbled with just a little fat, cooked exactly medium rare and let to rest just long enough for the juices to stay inside.  My friend's medium well filet mignon was to his liking as well.  He started with crab cakes, light and flaky and my crab cocktail was the kind that brings you back to Vegas.  My wife's oysters on the half shell were fresh and sweet, though the horseradish sauce lacked punch.  My only gripe is that the wine list is just adequate, not great.  Fabian looked at the Barolo we brought to remedy the problem skeptically, but it was big and still tannic and a great match to the meat and corkage of $20 wasn't outrageous.  Can't wait to go back with our next out of town guests.",

Youre deffintatly paying for the scenario here. Old school place with alot of history.

Too many exclamation points? We ate early and sat at the Sinatra booth - pretty cool. The whole decor, the leather galore, the photos from back in the day, the music...all added to the experience. Every staff member we encountered was excellent. First though is that we ordered (and ate) too much. We started with two excellent crab cakes. Then the table side caesar salad which was perfectly balanced - lemon, garlic, anchovy, etc. My wife had the filet Oscar (which she loved) and I had the bone-in ribeye (which was the best steak I have ever had). Dry aged, prime beef cooked perfectly (rare). It was absolutely delicious! For sides, we had the twice baked potato and the creamed spinach. The potato was good, but the least good of everything. I thought the spinach was excellent, my wife wasn't crazy about it. They use a touch of nutmeg (which I love and is probably what turned my wife off). I would definitely go back and highly recommend it to anyone that loves a great steak. We wouldn't have known about this classic had it not been for Groupon. With a couple of glasses of wine, our tab was $230'ish - the Groupon knocked $60 off, and it was well worth the price!",

    "text": "Celebrated my birthday dinner at The Golden Steer.  We made reservations in advance and requested for Frank Sinatra's booth (Table 22) as we were walked to the table the hostess told us this was the best seat in the house.  Sinatra's booth was across from Dean Martin's booth and Sammy Davis Jr's.  Our dining experience started as soon as we walked through the door, from the host stand to sitting in our booth and all throughout the meal.    We started with cocktails: a dirty martini for me and 3 fingers of Jack with an ice cube for him.  The servers work as a team so there were several people coming around checking on us, complimenting on my boyfriends cocktail (Sinatra's drink of choice).    Now on to the food, we ordered the cocktail shrimp appetizer, ribeye med rare with a side of sauteed mushrooms for me and NY strip med rare with a loaded baked potato for him.  While waiting for our appetizers, the dining room was filled with other diners ordering table side Caesar salads or cherries jubilee for dessert.  There was so much to watch in the small dining room of about 9 or 10 booths, whisking of Caesar Salad dressing from scratch, flambeing of cherries, birthday sparklers going off around us, and this was all before we even got our food.  Our shrimp cocktail didn't have any bells or whistles when served, but it didn't need to, the size alone was ridiculous!  The shrimp cocktail comes with 4 huge pieces of shrimp, cocktail sauce, lemon wedges and small bottle of Tabasco.  When the entrees arrived, our steaks were cooked a perfect temperature of med rare and the serving size again, made for a hungry man.  Lucky for me, I don't believe in taking a good steak home for leftovers so I did some work.  The sides were good accompaniments but the steaks were the main star.    For dessert we decided on the Bananas Foster made table side.  You can definitely taste the ingredients added in front of you with hints of orange and nutmeg.  We ordered the Golden Steer Coffee to go with desert, the server forgot about this but as soon as we mentioned it, he immediately apologized and said, \"No, you have to get it, completely my fault, it's on me\"  as we were finishing up our dessert and coffee, the maitre d came by and asked us if we needed any assistance with a cab which I thought was a nice service touch.    After 4 drinks, appetizer, 2 entrees, 2 sides and dessert, bill came out to a little over $200 not including tip, not bad for the service and food.  Definitely recommend for the experience and a great steak.",

There are even plaques next to the booths they regularly sat at. (Yeah, I totally went and sat in the Elvis booth.) 5 stars.  When you walk in, there's a bar area with gaming on the bar and some couches and whatnot.   We were greeted and seated promptly. The place was virtually empty on a weeknight.  Our waiter was friendly, but the service just wasn't what one would expect of an old-school establishment, nor was it on par with the service at other Strip establishments. I love the old-school places where they fold your napkin for you if you get up and use the restroom, where the courses are properly timed, where the food is held and not brought to the table of everyone isn't there (because someone went to the restroom), etc. But alas, this place did not offer that sort of classy service. 2 stars.  We started with the Caesar salad and French onion soup. The salad is made table side and was $12 a person. It was crazy delicious. Easily one of the best Caesar salads I've ever had. 5 stars. The French onion soup was also yummy. Bubbly and full of cheese. 4 stars.  Before I was even done eating the salad (and whilst I was in the restroom), the steak was delivered. We opted to share the 22oz ribeye. At $50-some bucks, it's a big steak for a relatively low price (by comparison). But it wasn't all the great. It certainly wasn't bad and was cooked exactly as we ordered it. But it just didn't have a lot of flavor to it. 3 stars. Shoulda ordered the filet...  To go with the steak, we ordered the bernaise and peppercorn sauces. Both were rather ho-hum. 3 stars.  We also ordered the twice baked potato at the waiter's suggestion. It was overdone and not particularly flavorful. 2 stars.  With the Groupon, the price we paid wasn't too bad. But I gotta say, had we paid full price, I wouldn't have thought it worth it.  The main attraction here is the ambiance and history. The food is alright, but there are far better steak places around town.",

    "text": "The quintessential Vegas restaurant of yesteryear when the mobbed up town played host to the likes of Dean Martin, Sammy Davis, Jr, and Old Blue Eyes himself (the guys whom the streets are named for).  Back when a steakhouse served steak and service meant jacket clad waiters prepared your salad, shelled your lobster, and flambeed your dessert tableside.  The Golden Steer brings it all to you.  Make no mistake, despite its location in the Badlands and it's tacky 1960's looking sign, this is a classic, \"elegant\" steakhouse.  Ballers of the past called this their kitchen, do not come looking for the $2.99 NY steak.     Straight to it, do NOT pass on jumbo shrimp cocktail.  Huge (U8), perfectly cooked and chilled, sweet Gulf shrimp served simply with a lemon and horseradish supercharged cocktail sauce, classic in every respect.  Add a gin martini and all is right with the world.        The tableside Caesar salad as good as you want it to be.  Just chopped crisp romaine, raw egg, anchovy fillets, parm, and croutons.  Adjustments are made on the fly for personal preference so speak up.  A good French onion soup.  Beefy, load of caramelized onions.  Not as cheesy as hoped for but great taste.  To the steaks, all USDA Prime dry aged.  Well trimmed, tender, very even searing and always cooked to temp.  The T-bone and bone in rib eye very flavorful and though the char masks the umame finish, plenty of goodness to be enjoyed.  Next, the excellent prime rib.  Served with a deeply favored au jus and creamed horseradish.  Beefy, juicy, and just good eats.  Simple sides (no truffle this or pancetta that).  Steamed asparagus, creamed spinach, giant baked potato with the works.  Portions are shareable.  Finally the flambes.  Bananas foster and Cherries Jubilee are outstanding.  A great show and as classic as can be albeit a bit heavy on the liqueur flavorings.  Service is steakhouse friendly and efficient.  No complaints.  Weak wine list for a steakhouse lacking vintage, varietal, and producer depth.   Fair markup.  Sometimes, you just need to embrace Vegas.  Luck Be a Lady after all.  Do it My Way.  As Time Goes By remember, That's Life and most importantly, The Best Is Yet To Come.",

    "text": "FEAR THE STEER  We ventured here under the assumption that this was a high quality steakhouse and restaurant. The atmosphere didn't disappoint. Unfortunately, everything else did. If you decide to enter this establishment in anything less than full formal attire, you will be seated in a separate dining area hidden in the dank back corner of the restaurant. Soon after segregating you, they proceed to offer the quickest meal service possible to kick you out the door as if your money is no good there. If you order food that would normally be served tableside, don't be shocked to find it is pre-plated as if your highschool cafeteria lady had slopped it on like hamburger helper.   At this point I assume the staff just came off the boat fresh from a farm in Russia. Naturally I order a Moscow Mule. So the appetiser wasn't their forte, how could they possibly screw up a cocktail right? I'm not sure what they brought me, but it tasted like a glass full of aromatic bitters. If that fancies you, skip the beer at the steer and go for the mule!   Main course time. As they bring my plate with my New York and Crab legs, they are kind enough to offer me a complimentary briss. The sharp steak knife is hurled at my crotch like a trigger happy Rabbi trying to fulfil his quota for the month. Almost joining the Lance Armstrong club is truly what tipped the scales and inspired this review.   Please do yourself a favour, go to Outbacks and stear clear of the steer.",

    "text": "This review is for 3.5 stars.  To begin, I am a fan of strip steak houses.  Yes they are overpriced but they offer that upscale, good-eats environment that almost guarantees a quality meal.  Golden Steer steers in a little different direction by staying True to its Vegas origin.  The scale of the restaurant is less than a strip steak house, however.  Though the waiters are wearing tuxedos and the prices on par, the restaurant itself is located right off Sahara in a unwelcoming shopping plaza; the bar even has machines to play blackjack.  Very Vegassy vibe.  I decided to give Golden Steer a shot because I found a Groupon and was craving a nice dinner.  I ate at the bar and was served a very nice old fashioned for $12.  I then ordered a caesar salad ($12) and a 12oz filet ($48), medium rare.  The caesar salad, though not prepared bar side like I was hoping, was a top notch salad.  Nothing too extraordinary but a top quality salad nonetheless.  The steak came without sides and was cooked all over the place.  The outside was easily medium if not well done.  The inside was perfect, but only about 70% of the steak was cooked correctly, so that was a little lackluster for a top steak house.  In all, Golden Steer is worth a go only with a coupon.  It's a nice, classy environment and different from on strip places, but I believe you can find a very similar steak (if not better) either downtown or in the suburbs for a cheaper price. albeit not back in time in old Vegas.",

    "text": "I was going through my reviews today and I came to a shocking discovery. I have never written a review on our favorite steakhouse in Las Vegas, NV. HOW is this possible? Luckily, this wonderful restaurant was on my mind today since we just ate here again recently. We come here for every occasion that we can think of so that we have an excuse for spending $400+ on dinner. We have been here for birthdays, fathers day, Christmas Eve etc. It is without any doubt our favorite steakhouse in town.   First of all, the outside is hokey and unexpected. Do not judge a book by it's cover. Once you walk in the front door, you a transported to one of the oldest steakhouses in town where loads of celebrities and members of the Rat Pack dined. It is dark, quiet and full of oversized booths with tables sporting draped white table clothes. This is a destination place for anyone in this city.   We found a server we really like: Berto. We are now asking for him each time.   On multiple occasions, ordered the seafood tower which is superb but on this trip we ordered crab cocktail and escargot. Both were excellent. For dinner we ordered steaks, surf and turf combo with shrimp scampi and a lobster tail. There is not a single thing negative to be said. The steaks were cooked to perfection and their lobster tails are some on the best in town. We ordered asparagus, sauteed mushrooms and a twice bakes potato for the sides.   Let me tell you, this is the place to go. I urge anyone to try this steakhouse and really be taken to \"old Vegas\".",

    "text": "I recently had an amazing experience at the Golden Steer.  This place is full on old school Vegas and I had NEVER heard of it.  I was fortunate enough to be invited to a dinner party here by a friend's boss, who reserved a room and treated close to 20 people to an amazing meal.  had I come on my own, my experience may not have been so amazing, but this was awesome.     First, I felt like I'd gone back in time when I entered, then the staff was all dressed formally and the bartenders looked like they had been here since Sinatra was last here.  Our meal was a whirlwind of deliciousness.  We were started with a platter of cold seafood: lobster, crab, oysters, and shrimp with the appropriate accompaniments. There was yummy bread and butter, then our meals came.  Several at my table had prime rib, there were a few different steaks and a friend at another table went all out with the lobster!  We also had sides of mashed potatoes, creamed spinach and sauteed mushrooms.  I had ordered a baked potato and it was seriously one of the biggest potatoes I've ever seen!  Everything I ate was delicious.  We had beverages on our own dime and I have to say the whiskey sour was PERFECT.  We were definitely too full for desserts, but overall, we felt super spoiled, especially since all we paid for was our drinks!  The place was clean and cool looking.  You really feel like your in old Vegas    The ONLY reason why I didn't go for a full 5 stars is that our main waiter was a little odd - kind of brusque and then he jacked up our drink bill and was kind of snotty about it.  But otherwise, LOVE LOVE LOVED the experience!  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED, but keep in mind, it's PRICEY!",

I had the Chicken of the Angels with mushrooms and articokes, it was very tender and the best chicken I ever had. The boyfriend had Prime Rib, and loved it but also started eating off my plate too. We shared some stuffed mushrooms and had fried Ravioli with our food. We were full after that, even though we wanted dessert, we couldn't eat anymore.  Get to this place early, parking spots are few, and we had to park behind the restaurant by 7-Eleven. (Not a good idea, a guy told us it almost got towed) Over all, expensive but worth it, it was awesome and hopefully will be back!",

Saying their next table available will be in 3 hours I should have made a reso online.  Ok?!?!  So we debate if we should eat here. We decided to walk out, think about it and went back in.  Sat at the bar. Waiter was rude and sarcastic. I am visual so like to use yelp to look at pics of food before I order.  Waiter Erick was like \"don't ask you waiter, he won't know what's good\". I was like, huh? Are u the waiter or the water boy I wasn't sure.   So I said to him I am visual so like to see how the dishes come out first.  The i asked \"are you our waiter tonight and what do you recommend?\"  He walks off yelling I don't like anything on the menu, there is NOTHING I recommend!!\"  Wtf?? Is wrong w this guy.  Sarcasm or just rude?!?!  I ended getting the table side Caesar, it was delish.  The rib eye was perfect!!! Melted in your mouth, little fatty but guess the marble is what makes it.  The French onion soup was sooo good.  Food 4/5 since there was a lot of fat on the bone in rib eye.  Check came, gave Groupon $30 for $60 and the lady who was rude to me when we walked in she had this frown on her face and literally went to the grown with her frown.  Now u must be the owner I guess, why offer Groupon if you don't want to take it and why don't u show it a little more on your face!!!  Over it, tried it, yeah the food was good. But horrible service   Not coming back",

    "text": "Let me start first by saying you can definitely find a better steakhouse for the money.  I'm not snobby, but this experience was not what I expected for the price and the other positive reviews.  We should have known better when, in casual conversation with our very casual waiter, he mentioned he's part of the new blood replacing the old employees who had been at the restaurant for awhile.  (New blood didn't prove anything better for service or professionalism, as we would later find out.)  I asked about a wine, and was given an answer in a off-handed way that it is sweet and has bubbles.  Really?  Gee, thanks for the description.  French onion soup was average. Because only one Caesar salad was ordered, it wasn't prepared at the table - but they don't tell you that when you order.  The steaks were good but overpriced, and they didn't mention the sauces that you could add.  The garlic bread was horrible, and they put it on the table in the same looking basket as the rolls, without telling us it was the garlic bread.  My wine glass was empty for 10 minutes without anyone asking me if I want another or something else.  The water glasses were attentively filled.  Mushrooms were good, but twice baked potato was ok.  We were pretty much ignored during our meal, including at the end when our dishes sat for 10 minutes before being cleared.  When the bill came, they have a machine to run it at the table.  They had predesignated tips listed.  As soon as my husband chose a tip, the waiter grabbed it from his hands, finished the process, said a quick thank you and then left our table.  No 'thank you, hope you'll join us again' or anything like that.  Don't worry, we didn't need any encouragement to return - we had already decided this was a mistake.  Service was not attentive, and not to the level of other steakhouses.  We will go somewhere else to spend this kind of money, and get better food and better service - and know that we will want to return again.",

I ordered my ribeye as rare and though i understand every chefs' doneness is slightly different and given the fact that the steak was very thick;  it was a tiny bit undercook. I generally love undercook meat but even for me, it was a little too raw for me.   You cant go wrong with banana foster, in addition, they make it in front of your table.

But the coldness I felt from all the staff made our night not fun. They seemed busy , tired and too good for us. The food was good though. But not worth coming back to get treated like an interruption to their day . The worst and most awkward part was when we went to pay. We gave them 2 credit cards and split the bill and then they hover over you with this little credit card machine and ask you if you want to add gratuity. So as they stare at you and hold this machine you have to press a button for a percentage for the tip. For such a snobby place that was tacky.",

Transport yourself back in time to when going out to dinner was an event rather than a regularity.  We started with the Caesar salad prepared expertly at our table.  Service was on point and the filets that we ordered were cooked to perfection.  Sides of creamed corn and a twice baked potato completed  our meals.  As more and more \"old\" Vegas disappears the Golden Steer remains a constant.",

    "text": "Went in for the first time ever.  It was a Friday night and I had no idea what to expect. Girlfriend and I were thinking it would be some kind of gaming bar. Envisioning Cheers with slot machines and video poker. We were so wrong! When we walked in, we thought we would be dining with Frank, Dean, and Sammy. Seriously.  From the subdued lighting and dark, rich wood decor, the only thing missing was a piano in the corner. The service was on point. Great timing and never intrusive. The dinner was excellent.  My girlfriend had the Idaho trout and French onion soup.  I had the bone-in ribeye and sauteed mushrooms.  Terrific choices. The only reason I didn't give the 5th star, and I could be too critical, is the menu prices.  It is on the steeper side. Reasonable but a little too steep for me. With that said, I'd recommend the Golden Steer to anyone.  It really felt like it belongs only in Vegas.",

    "text": "Yesterday evening, we were heading home on W Sahara and we both decided that we wanted steak for dinner. I immediately pointed out how close we were to the Golden Steer and we pulled in. We were early, their first dinner guests, but we hadn't eaten all day and I didn't want to kill time just to avoid looking like senior citizens.   The location is in a small, raggedy-looking strip mall but don't let that deter you... the restaurant doesn't match the mall.  The Golden Steer is definitely old school, but classy old school. It's dark but our booth had more than enough light for reading our menus or eating our food, something a few other restaurants could learn from. Seriously, if you have to attach a flashlight to your menu, you've gone too far.  We got bread and butter first, good but nothing special. The butter was cold but not frozen and it was fresh enough that it didn't crumble, so no complaints. We were served our escargot first, and the snails were tender plus the sauce was exactly the right old-school garlic butter that hooked me the first time I had properly done escargot. They didn't serve any bread or toast with it, but we still had bread from our basket so used that. We both love soaking bread in the garlic butter and the lemon wedge added just enough extra zing.  Next, we had the Caesar salad, which was prepared table side. It was good, and the inclusion of anchovies made it authentic. It was a tad salty for my tastes but hubby loved every bite. I know, I'm weird but I'm just not a fan of highly salted food. Unless it's peanuts or potato chips, then go figure.  Our entrees arrived once hubby stopped eating his salad, showing the unobtrusive attentiveness of our waiter. We both ordered filet mignon, medium rare, and I added bearnaise sauce while hubby added peppercorn and bearnaise . While our filets were vastly different sizes, both were perfectly prepared and nicely seasoned and juicy. The sauces were also fantastic, with hubby wreaking devastation on the peppercorn.  We also ordered two sides, the mushrooms and creamed corn. Both were excellent, and the creamed corn was obviously handmade and vastly superior to anything canned. I had to limit myself on that one, because of my milk-product intolerance, because I could tell that real cream was used.  All in all, the meal was great. The service was impeccable, the food fantastic, and the ambiance made me feel underdressed. We definitely ordered more food than I could eat but hubby did his best to make up for the imbalance.  The tab was $190, with no wine or dessert, and was about what I expected. We will definitely return!",

The bone-in rib eye is 22 oz, so my boyfriend and I shared.  Delicious, but a bit on the bland side.  Service was 5 from our informative nice server--Bryant I think--and all the wait staff.

What a great time at an old fashioned / traditional / classic Steakhouse - if you were in Reno it would feel like the Harrah's Steakhouse when Debbie was at the front door doing seating. Trolley service , salads made at the table , four person teams to service your table so the service was great - it is ala carte so order your entree and sides as you look over the menu. The filet and crab legs were perfect melted butter , creamed spinach, French fires and a Au Gratin style potato that was yummy. The Camus was swirled in a decanter and was sweet at the start and full bodied at the end.  I truly enjoyed the Golden Steer and can't wait to get back!!",

I had a Perfect Manhattan and it was the best.  The steaks are well cooked and the Oysters Rockefeller were to die for!  Of course dinner was topped off with 24 year old Port and Creme Brulee and Cheesecake.

    "text": "Old School Cool , but Food Just Okay  I have lived in Las Vegas since 1991 and this was my first time dining here . It was my 51st Birthday back in September and my son wanted to take me . The decor is old school Vegas and we sat at the Joe DiMaggio table next to the John Wayne table . The booth was comfortable and nice set table . The service was as expected in a nice steak house , very good . Now I got the larger Filet Mignon with twice baked potato and my son got the petite Filet Mignon with Shrimp Scampi . If you like your steak to taste like steak and not over seasoned then this is good for you . It is kind of bland , but you can get like I did the Bearnaise sauce to add a little to it . It was good meat , but my son said he liked my steak I cook at home better , which I thought was funny . I cook mine low and slow in a iron skillet with olive oil and a few seasonings . Don't get me wrong , others may like a more meaty unseasoned steak , it is to each persons taste .   The best steak I ever had in my life was in San Antonio , Texas back in the 90's and it was cooked in a Burgundy Wine Sauce and the meat was so moist you took a fork to it and pulled the meat off without using a knife ! I went there 3 times in 2 years , not cheap , but wow . Anyway , they gave me a slice of cheesecake with chocolate drizzle and a big candle like a firework and sang happy birthday , which was cool . The cheesecake was really good . We also had 2 salads and a bottle water and one beer . It came to around $180 plus a generous tip . My son was very happy with the service and that they took care of us . I would recommend to some people , but I think we will try somewhere else next time . It is good to have variety .",

    "text": "One of my biggest embarrassments is that I just RECENTLY went here for the first time. Classy old bars and restaurants are my favorite, and being the oldest steakhouse in Vegas, this place is a must.   Before I entered, a fun little escapade occurred with an attempted dine-and-ditch guest. The staff were very professional about it (especially considering they were all practically wearing tuxedos).  The ambiance - 100% in my book. Old-timey, leather booths, dark and moody. Sign me up always.  The FOOD. Ok, so you are going to a pretty classy and classic steakhouse. Expect to spend a little cash. However, if you were at a spot in a hotel casino or at a steakhouse in L.A. or Seattle, the prices here are considerably rad and do-able by comparrison.   We split a bottle of wine for our party of two. (Don't ask me what kind, because how could I possibly remember). It was amazing. I split a Caesar Salad with my guest, and the dressing was prepared table side (that's how fancy people do it btw). It was great - I hate that powerful anchovy taste, but this dressing was very well balanced. We also split the Rib Eye Steak, some asparagus, and perfectly creamy mashed potatoes.   Since this was an \"anniversary\" (kinda), we were surprised with a flaming cheesecake situation at the end of the meal. Don't ask questions - just go experience it ;)  I want more money, so I can eat here constantly.",

He had a house salad iceberg lettuce and a few other things carrots tomato cucumbers. We shared broccoli which was way under cooked,  barely blanched.  We had to check it out since it was historical in Las Vegas, but will definitely find a better steak elsewhere.  The Las Vegas area could be such a rip off if you're not careful.",

    "text": "Est. 1958 Truly an 'oldie but goodie'.  Wow~ just wow! In a good way!  I'm from out of town and my bro-in-law wanted the family to experience something unique from the old Vegas when Elvis and the Rat Pack frequented town. Boy, am I glad that he read an article that led us to this place!  There is so much history here and we were that are that right time, that we were able to get a private tour!  Can you believe that a medium sized restaurant had history enough that could warrant a tour? Well, it did!  We learned of how the mob used to enter from he back way and present a chip in a sandwich as a way of making themselves known or something of that sort!  We even heard of a possibility of the haunting of the ghost of the dress shop owner who died in a fire next door - which space was quickly rennovated and added to the restaurant... coincidence or foul play?  Who is to say, but photos falling from the wall and choking guests in the same bar seat were stories that were shared with us...  WHAT'S FUN:  You can sit in the booths that old world celebs used to reserve.  We happened to have sat in Muhammed Ali's table, which was formerly Natalie Wood's table!  See an article about it here: <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.reviewjournal.com%2Fnews%2Fdiners-requesting-eaterys-ali-booth%2F&s=03f2f671d411637b292a8d14d51817fa770e445db9d53e267e2205190050c386\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">reviewjournal.com/news/d...</a>  WHAT'S TASTY: Touted as the best Steakhouse in Vegas, I was not disappointed. I had to share the Rib Eye with 2 of my sisters because it was so huge, but size was not it's only attribute.  Taste was so very delicious too!  I really wanted to pick up the bone and gnaw on it, but the restaurant is still nice (e.g.: waiters in tuxedos) so it didn't feel appropriate, although the atmosphere is relaxed and not stuffy, I still wanted to maintain some sort of decorum. :)  Really enjoyed the table side Ceasar salad and from afar I noticed a table side Bananas Foster! What a cool show!  I really enjoyed the crab cocktail too.  The meat was fresh and sweet. I couldn't ask for anything more.  So the food is classic and you might say it's hard to find a place like this anymore amidst all the new fusion places that abound in Vegas nowadays.  WHAT'S UNIQUE IN SERVICE:  When is the last time that a Maitre D' made you feel like you were the most special people in the room?  Kudos to Roland Paz who did just that.  Not only was he the one who shared all the wonderfully intriguing restaurant history, but he went one up and offered to call us a ride to our hotel. AND WHAT A RIDE!  It was the nicest, cleanest Limo shuttle I've ever been in.  I'm not sure if this is a regular thing they do, but it was sure nice that it was available and offered while we were there.  WHAT'S WEIRD: Don't expect your basic server and server assistant... I think we had like 4 or 5 different people serve our table in one form or another.  Maybe they were all helping each other out, but it wasn't a style of serving that I am familiar with.  Again, I love that the waiters wear tuxedos and most of my family was dressed nicely, but many of the diners were wearing super casual stuff. I think it would be fun to go there in black tie to dine on a special occasion.  WHAT'S MORE:  So, my mom loves Elvis and she and I took a side detour to sit in his booth... a nearby father and son were dining and overheard us.  He told us that that day was actually Elvis' death anniversary and his wedding anniversary. Me being totally oblivious, was happy and wished them a happy anniversary, thinking the mom was in the bathroom or sick at home... later my mom tells me that the wife was not there anymore... like she had passed on already.  I felt soon very badly that I did not express condolences and maybe gift them with a surprise dessert or something... So if they ever read this. I am sorry!  My condolences and thank you for being so kind to me and my mom during such a tough time for you.  God bless you. I said a prayer for you and your family.  OVERALL: If you are going to Vegas and tired of the glitz and glam and craziness of the strip, go off strip for an experience at one of the last spots in town that reflect old Vegas.",

We walked in, no reservations. Waited about 15 mins. The staff is all very polite and welcoming. We were seated and ordered a couple appetizers, steak and a couple sides. They brought the steak and even though we requested medium well it arrived super raw. It was so raw we kind of lost our appetite. We sent it back and they threw it back on the grill mean while we are eating our sides so they won't get cold and by the time the steak arrived again, it had already lost its flavor. We didn't eat it. We asked for the check and informed the waiter we were not paying for it. The lady in the front came over and was super apologetic for the experience. She said she said we would not be charged for the steak and offered us a choice of free dessert. - again mistakes happen and I feel that because they wanted to fix it I would try this place again just not any time soon.   We ordered the banana dessert and it was amazing!",

Pictures of famous Vegas Strip stars from years ago, traditional seating with giant leather booths, wallpaper, just a cool place to have dinner.  Service was excellent. We ordered a prime rib to share, which was very good.  The sides weren't as awesome, we had creamed spinach and asparagus, which was just not to my liking.   Pricing is pretty high, but you are paying for the atmosphere and good service. We ordered a couple of bottles of wine, pricing on those, depending on the bottle seemed to be about double what you would pay in a liquor store, so that really wasn't bad. Again, you're paying for the experience, and we had a good time and shut down the place, as we were the last ones out.  The table next to us was apparently not happy with their service, which we were surprised about because the waiter was definitely taking care of them. They walked out complaining that it was the worst experience they ever had in there.  My friend and I couldn't understand what the problem was at their table. We watched as they had table side caesar salad and all their entrees came out timely from what we could see.  Maybe they just didn't care for the waiter.   All in all, I would go back and try a steak next time and a couple of different sides.",

We got there a little early and started with some drinks while we waiting. The Old Fashioned was perfect. Next we were taking to the dinner table a few minutes later and the Duckhorn wine was flowing. Our server was awesome, helping us with any and all questions we had.   Everyone by the end of the meal was talking about how stuffed we were and how good everything was. Can't recommend this place highly enough. The rich history just adds to the ambiance and good times.

Bad service:  I finished my beverage and then counted the number of times wait staff passed by the table without offering to refill my glass.  I got up to 13 before finally asking a passing waiter for a refill and even that waiter passed me by without seeing or hearing me.  Sure soda gets less attention than wine or cocktails but 13, no 14 times getting passed by is a little too much.  Poor quality: I ordered the Ribeye and my friend ordered the New York.   There was gristle in the meat.  I've never seen such poor quality in USDA prime meat (which is what we were told it was).  Also my Ribeye was barley warm.  Incompetent wait staff: at the end our waiter didn't know how to use the credit card terminal and had to call another waiter over.  The asparagus was nice (crunchy, the way I like it).  I was looking forward to having a fun experience at this nostalgic place but what good is the nostalgia when the food and service are so poor!",

I am big fan of old school Vegas and this is the place for some good history and great ambience.   Service was fantastic the entire meal, we had 2 or 3 waiters and they were all nice as could be and very informed about the menu.   Can you get a better steak elsewhere? Yeah, you can. BUT, this is still very top notch. Unless you are steak snob (I can be) then you and your friends/family will love this place.   My only gripe would be the cocktail and wine prices. The wine list is ultra expensive for a decent wine. They need to get that in check. Other than that, all the sides, table side ceaser and steaks were all cooked very well and tasted great.  This is CLASSIC steakhouse food, not elevated, not modern, and that's A-OK in my book.   Worth a try for sure, just bring your wallet, our 3-person meal with one bottle of wine was $500+.",

My party and I were about 20 minutes early but the host was quick to accommodate us and we're we're seated immediately. Walking into the dimly lit restaurant was like walking into another era. It was fabulous! From the looks of the outside of the restaurant you would never know of the treasure it holds inside.   All of the staff in the entire restaurant are great... Attentive, kind, prompt and, entertaining! Our waiter Humberto was awesome, sharing history of the restaurant and the decor surrounding our table. He also mentioned to us it was a popular hangout for the mob and that they have a private dining room referred to as \"the mob room\". That would be great to see in a future visit.   Now the food! We started with the garlic bread it was slightly crunchy, flakey, cheesy and, not overpowered by garlic it had the perfect balance of flavors. Followed by the table side Caesar salad, the dressing was mixed and doctored up right before our eyes. Tossed and served with homemade croutons. The dressing was the best Caesar dressing I have ever had! It was creamy yet had a bit of tang that my entire party really enjoyed. Now on to the entree, the filet mignon with a twice baked potato to accompany. The filet was delicious! It was large enough to feed two adults comfortably. Simply seasoned and cooked to perfection. Again one of the best I have ever had! The twice baked potato was good. The potato was baked, then the tender potato was scooped out and whipped with delicious toppings, placed back in the skin and baked again with delicious seasoning on top.   Now from what I researched prior to my visit, The Golden Steer is popular for their prime rib. I had the pleasure of sampling (from a family members dinner). It was so tender and flavorful, definitely living up to its popularity.  I look forward to visiting The Golden Steer again, it was quite a treat for my family and I!",

When we arrived, the maitre d' welcomed us and promptly showed us to our booth.  I enjoyed watching the interaction between staff and my son.  When we sat down my son commented that he did not expect this restaurant to be so big or nice inside based on the appearance outside. The Golden Steer is a great restaurant to get a feel of historic, nostalgic Las Vegas! I thought the service was good but I was not overly impressed based on how high the prices were.  To begin, we ordered the table side Caesar salad which was delicious and pleasant to watch, the 22 ounce prime rib steak cooked medium rare - to share(it was good but my son preferred his father's seasonings- I agree), the creamed corn (too sweet) and for dessert my son ordered the bananas Foster prepared table side with a lovely fire show, I had one bite! And finally, I trying to be \"the good mom\" ordered a slice of strawberry cheesecake to bring my two children at home to split - that did not happen! The strawberry topping which was fresh strawberries in a sugary sauce (not a gooey glaze) was love at first bite.  I ate all but one forkful. All in all it was a pleasant experience that I would recommend to any local or tourist who wanted to get a feel for old, traditional Vegas style dining, and table side preparations which are not all that common anymore.",

    "text": "Well, let's just say it was... Disappointing.   I will start with the very tender meat that is quite good and juicy and that's the only positive point with the host that was really friendly.   Waiters are cocky and their sales pitch is poor. They don't even know what's in their meals (one of them was not making the difference between ganache and icing on their chocolate cake when asked) and would rather sell you the place and its history than their food.   And it's understandable. Meat is juicy and tender but it's basically broiled (to taste) without any char. But ok, why not.   Presentation is poor as the meat arrives by itself in a plate that is not meant to cut meat easily. Same with the expensive and quite scarce sides.  But it's ok because you won't see it anyway. I know that steakhouses have the (bad) habit of dimming the lights but here it's basically turned off completely. I couldn't make the difference in my ribeye between fat, meat, bone ad grissel. Meh.   In the end 4 people, 2 small glasses of wine, 1 vodka, 1 ice tea, 4 meat platters and 3 sides turned out to be 300 dollars before tip. It's way too much for what it's worth.",

    "text": "Golden Steer is a Vegas classic, steeped in Rat Pack lore. My friend, who steered us to the Steer, insisted on booking Sinatra's booth, and book it we did. Initially indifferent, I must admit there was a certain feeling of cool sitting in the booth where Ol' Blue Eyes used to sit. We debated whether there was enough room in the booth for the entire Pack. I argued there was only room enough for Frank and up to 2 broads. This was confirmed when we noticed similar booths tagged with the names of Dean Martin and the rest.  The dark, classy back-room ambiance is definitely a throwback to a gone-by era of guys and dolls, gangster and dames. Just ask one of the waiters for a story from the old days...Though most of the staff is younger, there is  a guy who looks like he time-traveled from 1960 to make  you a table-side Caesar salad--which, by the way, is just what he does when you order one.  Steak was uniformly excellent. Even though I'd already eaten dinner and didn't order food, my friends were nice enough to offer me cuts of their meat. The New York Strip, which was mistakenly delivered to my friend who ordered filet mignon but did not mind, was juicy even at medium.  They also make a mean Old Fashioned, about the only thing on the menu that I actually ordered for myself.  On the way out, my friend confused two Canadian businessmen in town for CES for waitstaff, thanking them for a wonderful night. Oops, but the verdict was right.  PS: You already know this, but make sure your wallet is stuffed with Grants and Benjamins and your credit card is loaded before venturing in.",

The table side caesar was great.  They mix up the dressing to order and then toss in shredded romaine and parmesan.  The portions are very generous, enough for a meal.  This was definitely one of the best caesars I've ever had.  We also tried the petite filet and the new york steak.  They switched the doneness on the steaks, but they were still very good.  I didn't mind at all.  The new york was definitely more flavorful.  The filet was honestly a bit bland, as far as steak goes, but it was very tender.    Everything is a la carte, so you have to order sides separately.  I tried the double baked potato and it was alright.  It reminded me of potato skins.    Oh, the bar is fantastic.  I tried their signature golden steer and manhattan and both were on point.    My only regret was not saving room for dessert.  They have a table side bananas foster and cherries jubilee that looked amazing (table next to us ordered the bananas foster).  Also, the table behind us was celebrating a birthday and they were raving about the cheesecake.  Definitely going to try next time.",

    "text": "Golden steer is an iconic Vegas steakhouse. We have been wanting to try it since we had moved here..so what better time than for my fiances 45th birthday! He is a huge fan of Frank Sinatra. So of course I requested the sinatra booth.  You would not think that the inside would be what it was from the outside. It is in a strip mall, next to a deli and a local bar. But if you can look past that and wait til you walk in the door of Golden Steer you will go back in time. The ambiance is old school vegas, a great bar, piano and sitting area are there when you 1st enter. They sat us almost immediately. Frank Sinatras plaque is on the wall! Which was so special for my fiance, thinking he was sitting right where Sinatra had sat for so many years.  We had another couple with us to enjoy this experience.  We both ordered the chateaubriand for 2 and the table side Cesar salad.  The presentation was the best I have ever seen. The chateaubriand came out whole on a platter, 2 huge heads of cooked broccoli and carrots. The waiter carved the meat and plated it along with the vegetables.  It was cooked to perfection. It was served with hollandaise and bearnaise sauce.  It was not only the best meal we have had in Vegas but the entire experience  was truly special.  We will be back!  Thank you for making his 45th one that can never be forgotten!",

Then he proceeded to give me times that were not the time I requested.  When our party arrived, I was surprised to see the place as empty as it was.  Based on the attitude of the person on the phone, it sounded like they are going to be busy.  Once we sat down, the service and food was what you would expect for the price.  I had the prime rib, Cesar salad, and baked potato.  Everything was good.  Nothing that would make me say this was the best steak house in vegas.    It is definitely a place one should visit at least once.  Would I go back, sure.  However, I would not go out of my way to eat there.  There are many other steak houses to give a try.",

    "text": "Congratulations golden steer on starting my yelp career! Never felt the need to write a review on any of my experiences good or bad. That is until I took my fiance here for his 30th birthday dinner on 8/14/2015.  Food was okay, had the NY Strip and the ginormous lobster tail and even bigger baked potato. Combo meal came with soup or salad and veggies. Selected asparagus and clam chowder... Blah... (I'm from New England so I'm hard to impress with chowder). Good ,but nothing to rave about for any of the items definitely will not dream of eating anything I ordered.   Now onto my terrible experience. We arrived around 8 pm without reservations, which wasn't an issue, and were seated right away. Great so far. Restaurant was quite empty for a Friday night. Ambiance was lovely, very old Vegas. Nice. Snuck to the \"bathroom\" to set up a birthday surprise for my love. Hostess told me it is complementary and she would hook us up. Still going Great. Now here's were the ship starts to sink. Quickly. Waiter took our order. TWO lobster and steak dinners. TWO steaks ordered differently. Waiter comes out with one soup. Sorry sir we ordered two. No problem, he grabbed another promptly. Ate our \"blazay\" chowder just in time to receive our main course. ONE meal arrived and was placed in front of my fiance. Surely mine was next. Nope I was handed an empty plate and utensils. \"I'm sorry sir I ordered one as well\". Blank stare. He left to figure out the problem. The man who placed our order came over and said he thought we were gonna share and he apologizes. (Mind you we ordered a well done steak and a med well steak, don't c how the chef would pull that off). Still no big deal things happen right? He told me it would take only 15 min or so to fire it up. Cool. Birthday boy offered to wait for my food as well. Cold lobster? No enjoy your food babe I'll wait. 20 minutes later no food! 30 minutes later my food arrived. Did I mention the restaurant was not packed? To bad my fiance was full and done with his plate. So we ate two separate meals. By this time im a tad bit annoyed. Oh yea when my food came out they forgot my veggies and my lobster was over freakin cooked and my steak was well done!!! Whatever just bring on the damn cake. While eating I seen others celebrate their birthday with cake being brought out with sparklers and a cheerful hostess singing. Sweet. I wrapped up my plate as I was over it (still hadn't received my veggies, just a plate of meat) . The hostess comes over with an UNLIT slice of cake (there was a candle in it just wasn't lit) wtf? She places the cake down and said let me check on your veggies I'll be right back!!! Are u freakin kidding me? F$&& the veggies lady! Yay surprise happy bday bae . We sat there awkwardly with an unlit cake for 5 min or so until a different waiter came and asked if we needed anything ... Umm yea a birthday celebration would be nice. I told him the hostess ran off and never came back. He giggled and said I can light it. I wasn't amused. He lit the candle and stood there.AKWARD. I sang to him alone. Never again. By this time I was livid. He said I'm sorry about the confusion but I'm sure the food was good? What? Are u kidding me. No manager no compensation no anything. He proceeded to bring me the check with a smack in the face when he charged me 10 bucks for two glasses of water!!! 300 bucks for two dinners ,two waters and a side of disappointment. Thanks for ruining his birthday dinner Golden Steer.   You get one star simply because my fiances meal was correct and tasted fine.",

Started with cocktails: perfectly made cosmo and Manhattan. Bread was delicious, followed by the escargot. Huge snails prepared perfectly! Next, we both had the prepared-fresh-at-the-table Caesar salads. Oh, my, these were the best. We both ordered filets (her 8 oz; mine 12 oz) cooked to medium-rare perfection. We split a twice-baked potato and simply had no room for dessert. With a glass of wine each, the total (before tip) was just a hair under two bills. Not Ruth's Chris, but not Outback, either. I'd say the value for the experience (old school room with dressed-up waitstaff and Sinatra on the sound system in an otherwise quiet room) is spot-on.",

    "text": "This is the first time I have ever written a review on any type of establishment or service, but I felt so strongly about the way our bill was presented I had to voice my displeasure to all that will see. Went to the Golden Steer steakhouse with a close friend, We are both born and raised in Las Vegas and remember coming to this restaurant many many years ago. It was one of the few fancy steakhouses back in the day. Wanted to enjoy a nice meal in a old school higher end not OUTBACK steakhouse since it had been forever and thought we may get much better quality and service then one of the chains we go to all the time Morton's, Del Frisco's  Flemings etc.....looking forward to their table side caesar salad since not too many places offer that these days. The captain or waiter not sure of his title was polite enough but not very engaging. A little too aloof for that job only my opinion The salad was decent not the best table side Caesar but okay. We both ordered the shrimp scampi which was good. Shrimp were decent size and the scampi sauce was delicious!  The service was not so great or the caliber you would expect from a restaurant that markets itself a certain way along with the prices it charges. We had to request additional water along with bread several times. They kept forgetting, and it wasn't busy at all. That in itself doesn't turn me off from coming back or recommending a restaurant, everyone has an off night, but what does and why I am writing this is the way the bill was presented. The Captain/waiter brought over a portable credit card reader swiped my card and then stood there and pointed out the tip choices. He got his 20% which would be the norm that I tip but it was out of the pressure of him standing over us. While he would have received a tip, the service wasn't very attentive it was mediocre at best my feeling 15% tip would have been fair.  I have never ever been presented a bill in this manner and would never expect this at a so called higher end steak house. For that I will never patronize nor recommend this establishment to anyone. Management really needs to revisit this practice. It screams very low class",

However, the hostess smiled and said she would see what she could do. I was led to a small booth that was perfect (Clint Eastwood's booth). Service was superb; fast, friendly, and correct. The Caesars Salad was excellent. The filet and baked potato were perfectly cooked and so good. I had a cocktail and glass of wine. Again, just right! All in all, I highly recommend this place. It's pricey but definitely worth it if you are looking for a special place.",

    "text": "The GREATEST old school Steak House in The Las Vegas. This local legend opened since 1953, The Golden Steer has welcomed clients and celebrities from around the World. Its first class atmosphere and settings make the restaurant a \"time capsule\" where you are sent back to the 1950's were customer care and service meant something. You will enjoy the stellar service brought to you by Fabian, Cliff, Henry and the 5 star team as they bring you your fare in style! Their is a problem.....making a decision on what to order. The food here is magnificent and offers only the best cuts of prime meat available in the USA. Each steak or Chateau is careful prepared to order with no mistakes, grilled to perfection with seasonings and herbs that delighted fussy eaters such as \"The Rat Pack\" crew and John Wayne. Only the best here. The \"Steer\" offers all beer and wine and has an excellent bar with virtually all drinks available. The Bar manager \"Joe\" is also a celebrity in his own right. If you are looking for a nice Surf and Turf, you can order your steak with a Lobster Tail or Crab. If you are not sure, order the Seafood Appetizer that has an array of fresh delicious from the Ocean. Always fresh and tasty. If you love  \"SHRIMP COCKTAIL\" you must order this here. The Shrimp are large and the same is exceptional. My recommendation is the Bone in Ribeye Steak (cooked med. rare to rare). The Ribeye is large and thick but is prepared so that the meat is tender and literally can be cut with your fork. It melts in your mouth for an experience you will never forget. All entrees are separate and the sides are large enough to share. The creamed spinach, baked potato, Caesar Salad tossed and made at your table, are among the many sides you can order with your meal.If you have room after dining, the restaurant offers great desserts that are made fresh daily and complete that special dinner. I cannot say enough about this restaurant. It is the jewel of steak houses that believe it or not, many locals do not know about. Please expect to have the greatest experience here. Having said this the restaurant is 5 stars and is reflective in their pricing (which is not too out of budget). If you are lucky enough to be here in Vegas and try The Golden Steer, you will have the dining experience of your life.",

I took my boyfriend for his b-day ... we went to vegas to celebrate for the whole weekend, and his one request was a great prime rib dinner. We Yelped and Googled, settled on Golder Steer or Lawry's, asked around and decide on the Golden Steer.  Food was *terrible*. Granted, we got there at the end of the night, but when you're dropping $200 at minimum on dinner and wine, the 9:00 seating should still get some pretty badass food. Seafood stuffed mushrooms were squishy, bland and sub-par to even crappy Red Lobster stuffed mushrooms. Tableside Caesar was a joke. Had a really nice bottle of pinot noir, so even with teh bad food, we pressed on to dinner.   My filet was overdone, underseasoned and grainy. His prime rib was repellant. You know that reason a lot of folks think prime rib is gross? His was it: raw, full of uncooked, glisteny fat and sitting in a pool of bloody 'au jus'. I couldn't even look at it.   So, so disappointed. Will never be back.",

The decor was nice old school Las Vegas Steak house with lot of memorabilia on the wall of famous patrons. The service was interesting, I've been to many restaurants where there is a team that serves you. The Golden Steer had this concept but it wasn't done well. Service was slow and spotty with multiple head waiters not being attentive.   The topper of tacky was at the end when you use a credit card to pay the bill, a credit card machine is brought to you and the waiter said \"you can enter a higher amount and you don't have to use the suggested tip amount\". The food was meah the prime rib was good not a lot of au juice. My wife had the petite filet and it was ok  not much flavor but tender. Dessert was super disappointing the so called in house made tiramisu was frozen solid and the cream brulee was not white but brown. The wine list was very nice and they had an excellent selection but the prices we're extremely marked up for Las Vegas.   I was surprised that an old school restaurant like this did not have a wine somiler.",

We ordered the escargot and Caesar salad for the table to start. Escargot was nice, but I can't say much for the Caesar salad. It was prepared table side, which is nice, but too much dressing and too garlicy for me. I am a big fan of Caesar salad and this didn't really do it for me.  Now this is where the experience took a turn. We told our server that we had a Groupon and it's like his entire attitude changed after that. He became short and never came by. We ordered an 18oz Prime Rib and a chicken dish. This took over an hour and I always order my prime rib RARE. The few times we were actually able to flag our server down during this hour, he said he had another table that he had to help prior to us, and he said this several times. We finally told him I had to go to work, which I did, and been there about an hour and a half at this point. Food came out, Prime Rib was ok. Not the best I've had. The angel chicken and mushroom dish was awesome. We also got creamed spinach and it was just way too rich. Overall the food was fine like I said.  So after we were done eating our server comes and gives us our check. He could of asked if we wanted desert or maybe bring one on the house since I waited over an hour for a rare Prime Rib? Naw, he doesn't roll like that. He said, said we told him we needed to leave is there anything else? I was thinking desert, but he just made me feel like I was wrong for saying anything in the first place. He then brought a little credit card machine, pointed to the gratuity part and made sure to point out the original total before the groupon discount..again like he wasn't getting a proper tip, which was his attitude towards the whole thing from the beginning. It was like beyond obvious.  So if people ever read my reviews I rarely go off on service like this or ever really. But this guy single handedly ruined our experience. So after all that I am still giving 3 stars, because of the food and the atmosphere. I just don't think will be back.",

    "text": "*****READER NOTE: I RATE BASED ON ENVIRONMENT/SETTING AND YUMMINESS OF FOOD. I NEVER CONSIDER SERVICE IN MY RATING (NO MATTER HOW BAD OR GOOD)****** Setting: 5/5 Food: 2/5  ***SPECIAL NOTE: Had a Migraine and Upcoming Fever coming into this steakhouse, but my taste buds were still there, my brother and sister confirmed my judgement on their food****  Like many other reviews, this place is riding mainly only its reputation of hosting Sinatra, that's the reason I came. I absolutely adore places like this, it was away from the strip, the mood was intimate and felt classy. The decor reflected its classic history. However, the food was just not up to par. My siblings and I ordered the seafood platter, Manhattan Clam Chower, a filet mignon, and 2 prime ribs (an 18 and 24 oz). Seafood platter was quite the disappointment, clam chowder was aight, prime ribs were cooked to the correct texture, BUUTTT it was under seasoned. Ordered the 3 steak sauces, all three were quite underwhelming. Food wasn't gross that's why I didn't give it a 1, but it was overpriced for the quality of the food.   So in short, if it weren't for Frank Sinatra and the lovely environment, this place wouldn't have people flocking to it. This place doesn't need to be the best steakhouse, but it does need major step up in the quality of their food if they wanna stick around.      If my migraine impaired any judgement, it was giving the restaurant the benefit of the doubt, cause I was in denial of how underwhelmed I was.",

HOWEVER, I have gone to other steak houses and gotten fish and it was wonderful.  The sea bass at Flemings for example.  Having said that, I will give this place another chance and have a steak.  What I didn't care for was our server.  He was not in a good mood and we felt it.  We ordered $130 bottle of champagne and he never brought a bucket of ice, we had to ask for it.  The place was crowded and it's a hard job, however when you pay good money for food, there are no excuses.  Suck it up and give Everyone your best.It wasn't just him either, while waiting in the lobby I spotted an old cappuccino machine, I asked an approaching waiter if it still worked and he just walked past me without a word.  I was the only person in the area, so he heard and saw me, he just ignored me.",

Con:  When I took my husband there the last time, I have to say that the food was  5 star experience. It was even better than usual. However, the server was rather pushy.  We ordered a bottle of wine, 2 appetizers, 2 filet dinners with 2 sides.  Even the server himself (as they always do) reminded us of how \"ridiculously large\" the portion sizes are. Yet the server became visibly angry and downright pushy when I said NO to desert. That's not how you treat a local for their wedding dinner.  Especially after the AMOUNT that I had ordered.   Pros: That lousy waiter aside, I love this place. The service is NORMALLY ok... a few bad apples here and there... The food, I feel, is delicious if you enjoy a good steak.   The price is a bit high, but it's not everywhere in Vegas where you can experience \"OLD Vegas.\"  The baked potatoes are delicious - and GIANT.   I also enjoy the french onion soup and the lobster bisque.   Overall, I've never had a bad meal here - ever. I also enjoy the bar from time to time. The bartender is always great and the drinks are not bad.",

We were a party of 5 and after 1 1/2 hours the woman hostess asked us to leave because she needed our table. She was very rude and had been rude when we walked in.  Instead of asking us nicely to have an after dinner drink or coffee in the bar area so we could continue our conversation, she rudely kept standing at our table and repeating that we should leave.  The service was excellent but she spoiled the evening which included an 86 year old man who lives in Vegas.  The calimari was not freshly prepared and the bloody mary drink I ordered was not good.  What a shame to have this experience after so many years of great steaks and great service.  This woman hostess must go.",

    "text": "Based on a Friday night 7:30 res- 3 adults: Hate to give this spot a poor review, given it's history, but it deserves it.  This review is entirely service based.  Except from the lovely hostess who greeted us with a smile and helped us to our table, the rest of the wait staff didn't have a clue.  I say wait staff, because we never really were clear on who was our server.  It didn't matter who helped us at a given time, they all messed up an order, forgot to get something we had to flag them down to request, or simply ignored the table.  We shouldn't have to call a server over for every phase of the dining experience.  Luckily, we are all patient individuals. The food was great, but it hurts the experience if the entree comes well before any of the sides, as well as no wine (which was specifically ordered to come with the entree) until after the meal is almost complete (trust me, we held out as long as we could to wait for the wine, but there simply wasn't a server that came near us for a solid 10 min). No check-in by anyone after the food came. The icing on the cake was that when the bill came, the server explained that he comped two drinks for having to wait.  That's nice and all, but the experience still suffered, and he also had an attitude as if he was doing us a favor, which frustrated me even more. As Vegas locals, we've been here several times.  The impression that I got is that they are relying on their reputation as an 'old school'  Vegas steakhouse to carry them.  That will work ok with the out-of-towners, but we probably don't have a reason to go any longer.",

Don't restaurants make a mint on alcohol sales?  /shrug  The waiter was non-existent throughout the meal, we had to chase him down to get the check.  Three of the steaks were dried out pieces of leather.  One person in our party said it was the worst stake she ever had.  At $40+ a steak, it damn well be the best.    We had a side of broccoli - it was practically raw.    Overall this was a very disappointing meal - certainly not worth the price.

We live in San Diego but come to Vegas multiple times a year- that being said, we will DEFINITELY be back. We've done the celebrity chef route time and time again, but in my opinion, you can't beat a place that probably hasn't changed since the day it opened its doors. If it aint broken, don't fix it. The service was also great. Our waiters were very friendly and knowledgeable about the establishment, telling us about the history of the restaurant, as well as the fact that it might be haunted!  Highlights- table side caesar salad, both our prime rib and steak were cooked to perfection. The only downside is, my stomach isn't big enough to eat everything. Next time, we will definitely save room for the bananas foster or cherries jubilee!",

On top of the \"okay\" food, the service was disgusting. I dined alone, and was not pinching pennies; I wanted to spoil myself. At the end of the meal my server asked me if I had a coupon! This was beyond outrageous and I can venture a guess at to why he targeted me as a possible \"coupon carrying\" person.
