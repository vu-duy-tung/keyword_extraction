    "text": "The fiancee and I love Greek food and wanted to make a stop to try out a new Greek place! After walking in we were greeted by friendly people. We ordered two gyros. One was a chicken meal with feta fries (yum) and a beef/lamb gyro with an added steak skewer. After waiting a few minutes our food came out. Instantly we were both surprised by how much tzatiki sauce was on both gyros. Seriously there was a ton! After scraping some of the sauce off we were ready to eat. I went first with my lamb/beef gyro and it was quite tasty. The biggest problem with both gyros was the tzatiki sauce wasn't implanted into every bite! The tzatiki sauce was misplaced and hopefully they can fix that. The chicken we both tried was very dry. The steak skewer was cooked to perfection. Seriously good, but it could have used some salt. Overall I'll be back but ask for lighter tzatiki sauce and hopefully they can put it on the pita bread as well as some on top.",

So basically she told us we couldn't stay and eat that we had to take it to go . It was so uncomfortable that the couple next to us was sitting down eating and they got up and left and the lady cleaning the table said oh you can stay and they still got up and left . About 5 min later a group of 8 people walked in and they told them the same thing I can take your order but you can't stay . I will never be back because of the horrible service .",

I've been to numerous greek/Mediterranean spots and since this place is fairly new and near where we live, we decided to finally give it a try. We ordered the traditional gyro and shrimp and steak kabob plate...it was alright. I tried asking if they have the special garlic sauce, my heart shattered when the gentleman mentioned, \"I know Stephano's has it but we don't have that here.\" I haven't been there (yet!) but I've been to places like Manna and Meraki that carries the super \"oh so yummy\" garlic sauce that makes the food that much more delicious. For two plates, it was close to $30 which is quite on the pricey side, in my opinion. The place was clean and the traffic was steady on a Sunday afternoon. The workers didn't seem as upbeat as other Greek/Mediterranean places that I've been to. My son enjoyed the pita bread and I guess that's why I gave this place three stars...it was fresh, warm...the way it should be.",

Went with the great Greek gyro combo (beef) which comes with a side Greek salad and a drink. The auto was huge portion and the salad was dressed properly (not too much dressing) I also tried the mezze platter for an appetizer that gave you a good variety of Greek finger food and everything was amazing!

Greek lamb gyro A+ says my husband  Feta fries C Athenian burger B Hummus A+  I gave the fries a low grade because it tastes like the fries were old & fried again.  The Athenian burger was good but not the best.  The hummus with pita bread was excellent. My husband loved the gyro.",

The fries were crispy and flavorful too. I highly recommend this business. You won't be disappointed!",

We had hummus as an appetizer, then both my husband and I order traditional gyro's where he had rice pilaf and I had feta fries.   This food was spot on and the pita was so fresh you could tell it was right out of the oven.   And the lamb was incredible! The staff was quick and friendly,  I loved everything about it.

It also gave us a chance to look at the menu as well as see entrees being brought out to the tables. We placed our order and about 10 minutes later one of the girls came to our table telling us that it was going to be a 30 minute wait for rice and asked if we wanted to wait or get a different side but we went ahead and decided to wait since we wanted to have rice with the meat. It really did take 30 minutes for the rice to cook. Then we noticed them starting to serve plates with rice and other tables that had been there way after us we're getting their food first. My husband had to go tot the counter and talk to someone and let them know we were there way before these other customers and the girl told him that they just start putting rice on all the plates but not in the order that they were placed. We finally got our food and fortunately it was very good. It was disappointing that they would run out of rice on a busy Saturday during lunch causing us to have to have a long wait for our food. After this experience we don't know if we will come back or even recommend the place to our family and friends.",

Half of my family is Greek so I compare and contrast to Aunts and Grandmothers recipes handed down for generations. I will be going back very soon to try the rest of the menu. I had the Greek Pastitsio and Avgolemeno soup and they gave me a greek salad on the side (may have actually been too much food, even for me). i give the Pastitsio an 8 out of 10 just because NOBODY makes it like my grandmother but this is pretty darn good. - the Avgolemeno soup however I will give a 9.5 - i will say this was one of the best tasting lemon soups with chicken i have ever had. I am extremely impressed. I was so into the food i completely forget to make some food porn images. I will take more when I go back.",

The gyro and steak souvalki was very good full of flavor. I love that they have a kids meals here not only with the traditional chicken nuggets but actually Greek food made smaller for kids. My children loved the kids chicken souvlaki and they offer it with soda or a juice box.    You have to have to order the feta frys.

Spanakopita was also good, nice and flaky. The feta fries... AMAZING! My kid almost stole them all. We got the four dip combo because although I have had tzatziki and hummus before, I had never had the other two dips (that I can neither spell nor pronounce) and wanted to try them. Although I wasn't fond of the two new (to me) dips, the tzatziki and hummus were fantastic. Probably the best I have ever had. I will most definitely be going back for the gyro, feta fries and hummus.  Store was very clean and the service was great.",

Comes with two chicken skewers, rice (or fries), pita and a side salad. It's a lot of food so I feel the price was worth it. The ONLY thing i was bummed and didn't realize till I got all the way back to work, is it didn't come with any hummus for the pita . Noted for next time though!  My order was ready QUICK. Which surprised me because the place was fairly busy. I was pleasantly surprised.  The food, oh my gosh, the food was SO good. The chicken had great flavor and wasn't all dried out like most kabob places. The portions were fairly big, I could have ate half and saved half for later, but it was so good a finished my whole plate    I'll definitely be going back! And remembering to get a side of hummus next time",

I enjoyed the falafel salad but each time the falafel was different. In flavor and texture. Not sure if different cooks do different things but it wasn't consistent. First two time were great, last time not so much. Then I ordered the hummus and had this great homemade hummus and then the last time I'm not sure what they put in those small containers. Didn't taste the same. The food can be very good and worth the money.   I can say that it was prepared fast and my food seemed fresh. My friends food wasn't as fresh. The last time the salmon had a smell to it. I'm vegan but when I did eat seafood I know that when it smells it's not fresh or going bad. So that wasn't cool.   Again the food was initially good which is why I kept ordering from them but it's becoming to be a gamble which isn't cool. I'm not the type to keep calling a place to get my order correct so I just move on to the next place.   Oh and this was delivery. Maybe my experience would've been better if I dined in. This place isn't off my list yet, just wanted to give an honest review.  I may have to dine in to give them one more try.",

The interior was clean and orderly, even though they were at the tail end of a busy lunch rush.  You order at the counter and they bring the food to your table. The staff are helpful and will help you figure out the menu.  I tried the beef/lamb Great Greek Gyro, with a salad on the side. They also offer the Gyro with chicken.The Gyro was a little heavy on sauce, but the flavors were good. The tomatoes and onions were fresh and popping with flavor.  The salad was crisp and refreshing. Watch out, the kalamata olives still have pits in them.  The staff collected our dishes as soon as we finished, they were definitely on top of their game. Impressive for such a new restaurant.  This was a quick and easy meal that tasted pretty darn good. I'll be back!",

Also, comes with soft pita bread. Everything delicious, well seasoned and chicken very moist!  Ordered a side of Hummus as the platter does not come with it....that would be my only suggestion in that a small side of Hummus to dip the pita in, would perfectly complete the platter!  Just an excellent meal....We will be back soon and will share our delicious dining experience with friends and family.... Mahalo!",

The Great Greek has a perfect location if you live in that part of town, since you literally turn right off of Blue Diamond to access the restaurant, perfect if you're craving greek on the way home from work. Give them a call, order up, and your food will be ready by the time you arrive.   The food is good, but nothing that will particularly blow you away. The tzatziki was noticeably creamier than other tzatziki sauces I've had in the past. It was an interesting change of textures, but was slightly ruined by the fact that they LAYERED that s*** on my gyro. Unless you're into that, be mindful when ordered and maybe ask for it on the side to control your own destiny.   Overall, it's nice to have another Greek restaurant, but Stephanos is still the undisputed Greek God when it comes to Greek food. The Great Greek is...good, but I'll have to visit a couple more times and have something magnificent before I would consider it 'Great'.",

We were recommended to try the feta fries (amazing) and we ordered a gyro plate and a grilled shrimp skewer plate. Both came with a really fresh Greek salad and rice pilaf, which was also quite good.  Portion sizes were huge (we had enough for dinner and lunch the next day). My husband really liked the gyro, he only wished that they had put it on the flatgrill for a couple of minutes to crispen it up just a bit. My shrimp was flavorful and not overcooked and the plate came with 2 large skewers of shrimp. We will definately be back!",

    "text": "I was THRILLED...that The Great Greek opened a restaurant in the Southwest area of the valley. I have previously eaten at their Henderson location - quite frequently and loved it. For a brand new restaurant, you would have no idea, because the team that is in place there knows what they are doing. They offer fast, friendly and accurate customer service. There is no different in the food from location to location - at least that I am able to tell anyway.   From this restaurant, I've had the Grilled Garlic Shrimp and the Grilled Steak Souvlaki with Feta Fries - Both were excellent and will satisfy any craving that you're having, especially the Feta Fries. In terms of desert the Baklava is the best that I've ever had. A few weeks ago, I took a friend from Oklahoma here while he was in town and he described the Baklava as \"being the best he's ever had outside of Greece.\"   There is good seating indoor and outdoor. With long lines it can get a little tight, but that's just part of living in a city like Las Vegas. The restaurant does to-go orders, but you have to place the order in the store. Once this location is able to handle online orders I will be more apt to grab dinner. This reason, and because they ran out of rice at 8:30pm on a Tuesday night (it was close to closing time) is the reason for a four star rating. Once the online thing is up and running, five stars!",

I come here fairly often, and am always satisfied.  During my last visit, I witnessed a grown man have a meltdown over a pepperoncini, and the staff responded professionally, and calmly despite the comments made towards them.  They work hard to provide a welcoming environment, and they are great at ensuring customers are satisfied.  Cleanliness is always spot on!  Even when busy, they make their way around to clean up the seating area, and pick up your plates when you're done.  I've come here every week since opening, and haven't seen the place a mess yet. The food is also always consistent, and is made perfectly every time.  If something doesn't come out to perfection, they quickly remake it without incident.    I will continue to frequent this location, and highly recommend this place to others!",

The feta cheese topping was so flavorful and melted to perfection.  It was a generous amount and was perfect to share with our gyros.    This restaurant is a must for great gyros!  We will definitely go back soon!  The reason I only gave four stars is because of the dining area.  The dining area was not that special.  If the dining area had nicer tables and chairs and a more pleasant atmosphere/ambiance with actual waiter service and wine and beer it would actually be pretty perfect.    I will say the employees were nice, especially the man that took the order at the counter.  He was very helpful!",

They go out of their way every single time when it comes to our order to make sure we're satisfied. I just can't say enough great things about the staff here.   The food is fresh and very flavorful, I don't know where they find such beautiful tomatoes for their salad but these are the real deal! These are not your grocery store variety tomatoes, they really do taste homegrown.  Their hummus and their pita bread are probably some of the best pita and hummus that I have ever had. As a family, we have ordered many dishes here and a lot of crazy to go orders, and they are perfect every single time.  I highly suggest this place for a date, a fun dinner with family, and especially if you're looking to impress coworkers or a boss!

    "text": "Yesterday around 6:30 we ordered dinner for 4 people through Eat24. While ordering we weren't to clear about some of the items on the menu. No big deal. We just decided to call to get clarification. We called three separate times: 1st time: we just wanted to know about their combos. When the call was answered we were asked if we cold be placed in hold. The wait time wasn't long at all but the woman at the other end of the phone was EXTREMELY rude and hung up on us before we could ask all of our questions. We only had two....   2nd time: same thing.  3rd time: our order arrived between 45-60 min after we pressed, which was expected but our order was incorrect. When we called back the same woman from the first two called answered and continued to be very rude. And again hung up.We just wanted to let them know that what we presented was not prepared how we ordered it.    All though our order was incorrect, it was very good. There's no question that they have good food. The reason for two stars is because of the customer service we received. I'm not usually one to leave reviews. But I think they may need to look at how they treat customers who call their establishment. That experience alone is enough to not make me want to order there again regardless of how good the food is. Customer service is key!!",

The place is clean with nice decorations and overall inviting atmosphere. Staff was very friendly and welcoming. I gave it a 3 stars based only on their gyros. To me it lack flavor and that certain \"umph\", it does not beat our favorite spot but it's not the worst either. Fries were nothing special but the feta fries was something worth getting. Wifey also enjoyed their Baklava dessert. Would come back but definitely nothing I would be dying to go for.",

We went in for lunch with friends and that was a perfect time or even take out. It's nothing fancy but very cute decor. We had a couple of (small) Greek salads. One with and one with chicken. Then the boys had a grilled chicken Souvlaki (which is skewered chicken) and it comes with a choice of a few sides. We did the side salad (which was a nice portion) and the FETA fries.  I highly recommend the feta fries! And eat them hot. Oh MY!!! And truthfully the hubby and I could have split the chicken souvlaki (which by the way the chicken was not over cooked or dry but could have used a little more seasoning) with all the sides it was plenty for two. Everything was super fresh and the salads were not over dressed. I will definitely be back and most likely grab some for dinner on the way home some night. Loved the freshness of all the food.",

    "text": "Amazing customer service!  Looking for a place to eat and chitchat with a dear friend, we happened upon the Great Greek.  She had her one-year-old with her so we wanted to find some place appropriate, accommodating, and with indoor seating.  It was quite packed when we got there, with no seats left inside (only tall counter area left, which is kind of difficult to manage with a one-year-old).  Before we walked out, one of the servers / food runners saw us and told us to hold on because a couple tables were getting ready to leave soon.  He told us that he'd clean it up right away and get us a highchair, too.  I thought it was amazing that he even spotted us in the midst of all the food running and the fact that it was quite busy.  It's not a waiter-type of restaurant; it's the order-at-the-counter-and-get-a-table-tent-number-type of restaurant, but still.    The food was just as good.  The hummus was absolutely delicious.  Not the overly fancy kind where they try to throw everything but the kitchen sink in it.  Just straight up good hummus.    The gyro was rather large, which was great because I was super hungry.  I enjoyed it.  The vegetables were fresh and the meat was tender and flavorful.    The baklava was good, but different.  Kind of tasted like cereal, granola, and really tasty honey.  Overall, I really liked this place.  It's a cute, casual spot that's great for catching up with friends or grabbing a bite with family.  Nice, friendly, and helpful staff.  Would recommend and would definitely go back.",

Two, the portion size is phenomenal for the price you pay; you definitely get your value/ money's worth. The ambience is cute, fresh and clean and the staff is very friendly. I liked seeing that they enjoyed their job and being there while we were having our meal, it was just a nice extra touch.

The soup was really thick and salty, which was a bummer because I love that soup. The chicken was like Campbell's chicken - those tiny little bits in an oily, thick broth. I won't get that again. However, their lamb was cooked really well to my liking. I ordered it medium rare, and it was just that. It soaked into the rice a bit, making both better. I think they could do with less salt overall, and maybe let the juices drip even more into the rice. I remember that from the Greek food festival - it made everything better. They could also make their tzaziki a bit more dynamic with more dill and cucumber. However, I'm excited to try their other items in the future.",

    "text": "I had been wanting to try this place for lunch after a coworker's recommendation. Since it's a little over 10 minutes from my office, I decided to try ordering from Grubhub for the first time. Before I placed my order it said \"total time will be 30-40 mins\". AFTER I placed the order it turned into 90 mins! Yikes! So.. I decided to cancel my Grubhub order and just go to the place directly.  I drive the 10+ minutes, park, and when I walk inside there is a huuuge line and only one person working the counter. I'm waiting for at least 10 minutes which seems silly - why not have at least one more person working the register so they can handle the crowd more? On top of that, the person at the counter was also taking ordering calls so we had to wait for her to finish making the line move even slower. I was almost ready to bail but since I had waited this long (and made the trek), I decided to stay.  When I finally got up to the front, ordering was thankfully fairly smooth. I got my food to go and when I asked, I was told it would be another 15 minutes for it to be ready. I wish the lady behind the counter would have volunteered that information instead of me having to ask after I placed the order. But once again, I'm already committed, so might as well ..   Ordering food to-go is kind of weird because they don't give you a number and there's really no where to sit and wait. I didn't want to take up a spot at the table for people dining in since it was already crowded, but I didn't want to stand because it was gonna be at least 15 minutes? So the whole thing just felt weird and clunky. I saw a lot of people get to-go orders so I would have thought they'd have a better process.  After a few minutes, I decided to check on my order, and I found that my original Grubhub order was actually made instead of being cancelled. I panicked because I had just placed an order for the same exact thing. The lady at the register assured me my order had been cancelled and so I wouldn't be charged (even though it was made). At the same time, the order I had placed a few minutes ago came out, so she packaged that. While I thought she would just give me the second cancelled order as a nice gesture since it was already there and ready, she instead put it to the side and had zero interest in offering it to me. This was a huge disappointment as other places happily offer me \"mistake orders\" all the time. I mean the food wasn't cheap to begin with. But, since I had to get back to work, I didn't want to fight it.  And as for the food? It was just okay, but definitely not worth the hassle. The steak was decent but the lamb was super tough. I got it medium - which the lady recommended - so I don't know if it should have been cooked less or what. I was also REALLY hyped about the feta fries, but when I got them they were way too cheesy. They also didn't taste very feta to me? If you love cheese then you'll be fine, but if you're looking for more crispy fries with feta accents (like other places I've been to), I think you'll be disappointed.  Overall I'm hesitant to recommend this place for lunch. If you do, order ahead or be prepared for a long wait.",

I love the grilled chicken/shrimp Greek salad from the restaurant I usually go to so of course I had to try it here. The chicken skewer here was extremely dry, no flavor to them at all, almost like they were over cooked. The salad was alright, lettuce was extremely huge so I had to cut them down with a knife to eat them comfortably. Overall I just wasn't too impressed with the salad that I love so dearly at the other restaurant. Perhaps maybe I'll try their other meat options next time if I ever decide to come back.   They were very busy during dinner time so maybe I might've just had a bad batch of chicken that night.",

    "text": "Well, this was a surprise!  The husband and I were craving Greek food and he remembered seeing this place \"coming soon\" not too far from the house. We swung by tonight and, in all honesty, I was expecting decent grub and a so-so atmosphere. It was far better than that.  The place itself is very nicely put together, especially considering it falls under the \"fast casual\" umbrella. Beautiful wood on the walls, lots of planters, nice lighting, lovely tables all with vases and fresh flowers. It was very inviting. Also, food is served on real plates with real silverware and the plates have a kind of pottery look and feel to them which adds to the overall effect.  But more importantly - the food!  We ordered two gyro combos; my husband's had feta mine didn't. Both were the lamb/beef combo with juicy fresh tomatoes, red onion, deliciously fluffy and thick tzatziki sauce, and a scrumptiously fluffy pita to hold it all together. Guys, it was phenomenal! Meat was tender and delicious, veggies were on point, and the sauce was addictive.  I had rice pilaf as a side (yummy!) and the hubs had the feta fries. The feta fries were a revelation. Perfect spuds with feta and tons of oregano mixed throughout (I hate it when there's only cheese on top!) and cooked together into a creamy, gooey, crispy, unctuous mass of magic. I stole many of his fries and husband is a good man because he let me.   We also got some eggplant dip as an appetizer and it was very good. All good was ordered at the counter but brought to your table. Service was wonderful, extremely friendly and genuine.  I short, I'd go back in a heartbeat. The only problem is deciding whether to eat that amazing gyro again or try something else because the whole menu looks awesome.",

Kids meals satisfy my picky eater and she loves the chicken lemon soup! Two gripes: olives inconsistently have pits and I can tell when I ask for no tomatoes they pick them off my salad because there's tomato seeds on my salad. Minor things and we still love this place.",

I always get the KIDS size because once I got the regular portion and I had enough for 2 meals (which is not a bad thing). I have gotten the Gyro sandwich and platter from the Kid's menu with the salad and fries as sides. I have also tried their lemon chicken soup, which I think would be wonderful when you are feeling sick. Don't forget to get the Greek cookie to finish your meal! They are yummy! I have only taken my meal to-go but the restaurant is clean with a very nice design. You order at the counter and they bring out your food. They also clear your plates when you are done. Overall, I highly recommend them. I look forward to trying something new on their menu the next time I visit!",

    "text": "We visited for the first time yesterday (7/13/17) around 4PM prior to the dinner rush.  The restaurant is clean, with a modern/minimalist interior.  We frequent Greek/Mediterranian establishments quite often due to our diets, and this has risen quickly to the upper ranks of our list.  You go to the counter to order, and the food is brought to the table by a runner.  Drinks are self serve.  The tea is fresh brewed, so that's a huge plus.  All of the staff members were super friendly and helpful.   The menu has a large variety including avgolemono soup, all types of skewers, and even baklava ice cream.  Prices are very reasonable.  An add-on skewer (shrimp, chicken, lamb, beef, salmon) is only $3.75. The kid's menu is fantastic.  They offer gyros and skewers, not just the usual chicken tenders kid's fare.  As someone who has a very restricted diet, I appreciate that I can get skewers separately or a decent kid's plate without a hassle or a weird upcharge.  I got the plated gyro from the kid menu and my husband got the regular gyro plate.  He substituted additional salad for rice at the suggestion of staff.  It has to have been one of the freshest salads I've seen in town.  I don't even like tomatoes, but they looked glorious.  My kid plate was larger than I expected.  I don't know that it would be a full meal for most adults, but it would definitely not fall too short.  The food was fresh, super tasty, and very filling.  The Tzatziki was wonderful. The gyro meat was nicely carved and wasn't overly seasoned.  The pita was not as soft as I would have liked, but not because it was old or stale. I believe it may have been baked just a little too long.  Overall it was a nice experience and very convenient for the SW end of town. I look forward to a return visit to try the skewers and soup.",

For 3.75 a bowl you can't beat it, even comes with complimentary pita bread. I also tried their great Greek gyro which had tender meat, a well flavored tzatziki, and a generous amount of feta. Lastly, my boyfriend tried their steak souvlaki plate that came with rice and a side salad. He said his steak was perfectly seasoned and cooked.  *** Bottom Line: The Great Greek provides well flavored food, good-sized portions, friendly service, and fair prices!",

My girlfriend and I usually get the souvlaki (chicken, steak and/or lamb) plate and it is so satisfying, and for the price, you really can't beat it. The staff are also very friendly and efficient. If you don't like to wait, I suggest you call in your order for takeout as it usually takes about 10-15 mins for them to have your food ready. Hey? At least you know it's fresh!

My main complain is the bowl itself. For almost $12, you get a SMALL skewer of DRY chicken, rice & the cucumber and veggies. So basically, the whole bowl is 80% rice 15% veggies and 5% meat. The chicken was very dry and was hard to eat. Although once the sauce has been added, it's good. Overall, wouldn't go back to this place. Too pricey for the quality of food",

I had the Great Greek Gyro and it was packed with flavorful beef/lamb meat.  It is clear that they make their own tzatziki sauce because it was just so fresh and tasty.  The cashier talked me into the feta fries and I will be indebted to her forever.  They are a must get every time.  My wife had a salad with a chicken skewer.  She hasn't stopped talking about it.  The veggies were so fresh and the chicken was tender and had great flavor.  Do yourself a favor and save some room for dessert.  The rice pudding and baklava ice cream are both outstanding.

    "text": "Its great to have a new cuisine in the area off Blue Diamond, if you are in the area you know the choices aren't vast. With that said The Great Greek Mediterranean Grill in my opinion is not the greatest Greek you can get in town. Meraki Greek Grill or Shish Kabob House is a much fresher choice for the same value. I found the Grilled Chicken Souvlaki plate ($14.02 w/tax) at the Great Greek to be dry and mildly flavorful. The rice pilaf was cooked properly and probably my favorite part of the dish. The feta on the salad was fresh as well as the other ingredients, olive garden should ask for their vinaigrette recipe its pretty dang good! So I would have to give their salad an A+. I would cover dessert but when I was in line ordering I asked if I could get a order of Baklava but I was informed they where out (this was at about 8:15 pm they close at 9 pm). A customer behind me, which ordered (5) orders of baklava ice cream told me that the baklava dessert was awesome, sad to say I didn't get to try it. That actually might get me to go back on another night when I want a quick and easy fix for some Greek food, that and the salad. Other than that I am traveling to Meraki off Trop and rainbow. The Great Greek does stay open a little later than others so that is another plus and actually the reason I tried them in the first place, as Meraki closes at 8:30 pm. the owner was there the night I came in, great operator, friendly staff, clean establishment. I want to give this establishment a higher rating but the food was just not there for me.",

    "text": "Was really excited to have a Greek place close to home but after trying was a little disappointed. Ordered the Rice Bowl. Not sure why they called it that considering there was barely any rice yet there was a lot of greens which was fresh but it drowned out the rice and you couldn't even tell if the rice had any good flavor. Had the steak with the rice bowl and asked for medium but instead got way well done not to mention it was so little meat it really wasn't even worth adding to all the greens and barely any rice. I also added the Mezze Plate so I could try a few of my favorite Greek items. The Spanakopita was the best I've ever had, the Dolmades were really tiny and had no flavor, the Falafels were really dark brown which I can assume was way over cooked, the Tzatziki sauce was watery, and the Hummus was extremely lemony. I love lemon but not as the main taste in my hummus. I guess I won't be having Greek food so close to home after all because I won't be going back anytime soon.",

If you're a vegetarian or a omnivore like myself this place has all the right choices.  I'm a foodie from NYC and trust me this is authentic Greek food.    * Boomsauce scale. BW = Dis $@% is BASURA!

My boyfriend and I used to go to their Henderson location whenever we were in the area; so I was extremely happy when I found out that they expanded and is now much closer to us. No matter when we come in, Great Greek has always been consistent with their delicious and flavorful food. The prices are reasonable and everything is made fresh to order. In addition, the staff are super friendly and the service is fast. My go-to order is the grilled chicken souvlaki (with rice) that comes with a small Greek salad and my boyfriend loves getting the Great Greek Gyro (with chicken) and feta fries. We also love to order the Tzatziki dip with extra pita bread.   My boyfriend and I came in on a Wednesday night to order take out. Although the restaurant was packed, we placed our usual order and didn't wait long at all. We brought our food back home and loved every bit of it. With the portions being huge and filling, I brought my leftovers to work the next day. I wasn't surprised at all that it still tasted as good as if you were to pick it up from the restaurant that day. I definitely recommend this place! We will be back again and again.",

    "text": "I love watching the show The Profit. He struggled with the owner of this restaurant, but made it look much better. I had very high expectations having read the reviews, BUT, the service was horrible, when I asked for lamb souvlaki, the cashier says 'You know that it's two dollars extra!' Of course, I said no!, because it doesn't say that anywhere on the board. Basically, the menu board is useless as it doesn't provide much information. And then, the kid brings out the food, slides it across the table and doesn't even ask if I might need anything. For the cost, I definitely expected better service and some flavor to the food. The lamb didn't taste roasted and the yogurt dressing didn't taste of garlic. Very bland food for $20. Anywhere else would have been better.  Thanks for your reply Nick D. (Owner), I actually struggle to believe that any other day that the service, or the food, would have been good. I'm willing to bet that it wouldn't be different even if I was to come back. I would be willing to return though to meet Marcus Limonis.   Tonight, I'm cooking my own lamb dinner. A big box store did all of the preparation and it comes out very tasty each and every time. As you can see,?I'm not a betting man. I like to go with the sure thing.   To be very clear, I resent finding out that something that I order is more expensive than on the menu when I arrive at the register. This makes me feel duped. I'm marking down my review of your restaurant for making me feel this way.   I left the Napa Valley town of Yountville where the meal prices ARE very high, but they but the cost on the menu anyway. And there, the food always surpasses expectations. I would have liked for The Great Greek restaurant's food to at least meet my expectations, with as high as it was promoted. Underline promoted.",

It was a moderate size, packed, and very clean. The menu seemed to be a standard Greek menu, but a few tasty standouts, such as Baklava Ice Cream and the Feta Fries.  We ordered the Great Greek Gyro with Lamb, the traditional gyro with beef, feta fries, and baklava ice cream. For our son we ordered the awesome grilled cheese pita. the grilled cheese pita is an awesome idea, easy to eat and not too messy. My only complaint is they use processed cheese. The food was delicious. In fact after this we returned several times which  prompted me to write this review. The staff are friendly. Service is quick. Very good atmosphere.",

I wish they have a larger variety week over week of their lunch specials but I guess the Lamb Chops is also a good option when you are in that special mood. Feta fries are a must and their spreads are amazing too. Don't be shy and always take something to go :)",

The steak skewer is $3.75 on top of the salad which is $5.95.   It's nice because if you eat there they will bring your food to you, but since it was my first time ordering the salad I didn't know they were supposed to give you the dressing on the side. If my friend didn't say anything I wouldn't have known, which is why they got a four start instead of a five star.   The steak was good and they even provide you with naan and tzatziki sauce. Not sure how you spell it. The salad had an abundance of onions and oversized tomatoes which I didn't enjoy.   Overall, the food was good and the service was average. I'd come back again to try their other items on the menu.",

As soon as we walked in...it was clean and refreshing! The Vegas summer has been kicking our bum...but it was comfortable the moment we walked in the door. The first thing I noticed, was how nice the decor is and how well kept the location is. I was excited to get to the counter.   Since I hadn't been here before, I stared at the menu in amazement...I feel the young lass at the counter is used to the shock on new faces...so she advised I grab a menu and make myself at home at a table...excellent idea! The wife and I sat down and looked over all of the delicious options.....thankfully she pulled me back...or I would have ordered two of everything!   Everything sounded beyond appetizing! We decided on a few appetizers, a salad, and some fries, but then I noticed they were offering a special that included a few of the items we were ordering. So we decided to get that and split it. I wanted the greek salad, hummus, and fires....but I was worried that us splitting the meal would leave us hungry.....boy was I wrong!!!!  The ladies behind the front counter continued to bring us parts of our order, as soon as they were ready...and I thought it would never end! I do wish the tomatoes for the salad were cut a tad smaller.....but that's just because I need to be able to shovel the yummy foods in faster!   Everything we tried was fresh and more than I expected for the prices. Our table was cleaned as soon as we finished each plate, and everyone was beyond kind and helpful. I look forward to making another trip here very soon and highly recommend you do as well!",

    "text": "Very nice Greek restaurant on Blue Diamond and Decatur. Near Fruits & Roots and Capriotti Sandwich. They have a nice size patio and parking lot. The restaurant itself is very spacious and clean! The menu offers many option \"sandwich for smaller portion\" or plates if you are very hungry! We ordered 1 Gyro plate and 1 Chicken plate. It comes with choice of rice or fries and a yummy side salad (baby romaine, red onions, feta cheese, tasty tomato & olives) It cost about $42 including 2 fountain drinks and 2 rice pudding Our order was brought to our table. The chicken was juicy and tender. The gyro meat was very good and nicely flavored. Very happy to have another great Greek in SW!! I like that they had some Franks Hot sauce, Sriracha & Tapatio available",

I ate there few times , the food was always fresh , the chicken was great ..  too bad that the employees made my last visit my last one . The Mexicans in the back kitchen thought because I'm white I can't understand Spanish ..while I'm waiting for my food I hear them laughing at the customers that coming in including myself , saying stuff like \"why this niggers come here ? They should go to McDonald's \" \"now this old couple gonna take forever to finish eating \" etc...  I don't know if they were mad because people came like 5 minutes before closing but they were just unbelievably disrespectful .. I'm not the one who will anything to them .. I just took my food , threw it to the trash outside and left the place .  Never coming back there again .  The owner should definitely fire the back stuff !",

Today is IT for me. I will never go back. Every time i go to Great Greek, they mess up my food somehow. Last time, i got home and had beef instead of chicken. Today, i got home and had no dressing for my salad and no sauce on my gyro. There is always something wrong with my order. They also have the worst customer service. They are always rude and act like you're bothering them by ordering. It really does make me sad since the food is so awesome. This business won't last at this rate.",

The cheese on the feta fries had gotten a little cold by the time we made it home but they were still pretty tasty! We also ordered a side of dolmades, which leads to the -1 star, they were out of dolmades so she offered hummus instead which was priced less than the dolmades. We didn't make a big deal about it because we paid with a card and it would have been more hassle to refund such a small amount so we just ate it. Plus the hummus ended up being good anyway!! Over all I will definitely be visiting again!",

It had cucumber, tomato, feta cheese, and red onion. The rice pilaf was tender as well. The pita that came with it was soft and fresh.

I could of shared this plate with my husband and it would of been more than enough. Husband had the chicken souvlaki plate, which was 2 large chicken kabobs with rice, salad n pita. I tasted the chicken and it was moist and tasty. We also ordered the hummus. Everything tasted fresh not like some other Greek chains we've eaten at where the food tasted frozen and just heated up.  For 2 meals, 2 drinks and hummus w pita =total was around $35... we went home with tons of leftovers.  Yes will be ordering food from here in the future.",

We enjoyed it so much went back to have hummus again and tried the little fried dough balls that have a Indian spicy taste to them. I can't remember what they are called. They tasted very authentic.  We are a fan now of this place especially when we are in the mood for a good Greek Salad. It was very good and one was enough to share. I think there is one other location in Vegas for this restaurant and the girl we spoke to thought they maybe opening more soon. Check it out you won't regret it!

A bit of suggestion to maintain the flow. If you know your kitchen is behind why not slow it down by just having one person ring in transactions on one register. The rest can do what they were doing which is one busing and the other running food. The guy at the register should not bounce back and forth between the two registers, you made the wait time horrendous. Especially since people who walked in 5 minutes behind me got their transaction and food before me. I truly hope you guys sort out a game plan on how to handle the business before the food becomes sub-par cause of lack of attention to quality and poor customer service.",

Prices are higher, but probably dictated by their lease.  Food was very mediocre. Americanized Gyro offering with average flavor tzatziki. Fries were grossly undercooked, pita was cold and gyro meat was not freshly sliced; it was not even warm.  Probably won't be going back.",

Alas, my friend was set on coming to this place, and worst case scenario, I could go next door to Capriotti's.   That being said, I ended up ordering fries with feta and tzatziki sauce on top, and they were DELICIOUS!! However, not something I can order regularly unless I want to gain a hundred pounds lol. The tzatziki sauce was so incredibly good, I took a few bucks back up to the cashier to order another side of it, and she just gave me another side, free of charge. Staff was super friendly, and restroom and dining area were clean. This is close to my house and would really like to dine here again and try something different!

We love how fresh the food is and the ample indoor and outdoor seating options. It is a very casual spot situated between Fruits and Roots and Capriottis. Their feta fries are to die for.

I think i could eat this everyday, great Greek salad that came with the dish so I felt a little healthy! but all day long I'd go just for the gyro! Out of all the Greek places I've been to here this one has by far been the best. The cashier im sure was Greek and suggested the plate that I was already leaning towards, I've definitely gotta get more suggestions from her. I need to expand my Greek beyond gyro plates and kebobs, and I'm sure it will be there. It was a little busy at 2pm on a Sunday but im sure it's because the food is so good. I wasnt supposed to eat all the bread because I'm just diagnosed with diabetes but be dammed the bread was so good with the lamb I couldn't help it.",

It was filled with stewed lamb meat. It was like a Sunday dinner at home in a pita! A real treat. Very freshly cooked. The lamb chops could easily be for two people. They too were super tender and cooked as ordered.  The appetizer we ordered had four types of dip and warm pits bread for dipping. The tzatziki was great, with just the right amount of dill and garlic. The other three were also tasty!  Can't wait to visit again!",

Instead of getting light and fluffy on the inside, crunchy on the outside falafels, I got mushy falafels that were falling apart. I didn't think too much of it and attributed it to probably a bad batch. Came again today thinking it might be different, but what I got were still the same mushy, soggy, broken down falafels. They didn't even hold their shape when I got them! It would have been okay if it still had that crispy exterior, but even that was non-existent. To top it all off, we waited for my hubby's Greek salad with chicken for more than 15 minutes, while other people, who ordered the same thing after us, got theirs first. He finally went up to the lady to ask why it was taking so long, and lo and behold, his order was just sitting there on the counter. By the time we got his order, the chicken was no longer hot-- heck it wasn't even warm to say the least. We gave them a second chance, and were still sadly let down. Guess were sticking to Meraki's!",

It was pretty packed and the only  reason for the 4 stars was the fact that we stuck to the table. I even wiped it down with a Lysol wipe but we just laid out napkins like a place mat. It may have been due to it being too busy to keep up with the table wipe downs ...",

I ordered the cheese pita kids entree for my son, and I got the gyro by itself with a water cup. First thing that disappointed me was my total was $16. I didn't get a combo or a drink and I only got my sons kids meal. Ok, looking passed that, I've spent more on food, my son and I sat down. They were super busy since it was lunch time and figured I was going to wait, which I never mind waiting. Less than five minutes since I ordered our food came out. That was super fast for chicken gyro and a kids entree with rice m, but ok. The food was amazing, best chicken I've had in a while. Just disappointing how expensive it was for what I got, and then it came out so fast. Disappointing, but the chicken tasted amazing.",

Parking was a little competitive with other food options for dinner.   They offered complimentary water cup while waited because I ordered to go. I got two salad wraps one with chicken and one with shrimp. Both were pretty good and exactly what I expected to taste. The shrimp was a little more subtle so I think the chicken or red meats may be a better choice for balance.   Honestly i think the best way to go is the entree plate. It's plenty of food you have to get it with rice and feels like a proper full dinner meal from a clean flavored Mediterranean place. Whatever they advertise on the ingredients of each item you can expect to taste everything.   Wrap or salad is good if you want the lighter side of things.",

Neither of them had ever tried grape leaves before so I made them taste them. Pretty good! Could use a bit more tartness and they were certainly too cold. That made the rice kinda crunchy and weird. They should be a little chilled but not cold.   I had the gyro meat and steak combo platter with hummus. Yum!! The steak was delicious!! Cooked to order and tender. The gyro meat was also very tasty. They came on a bed of rice. The rice was nothing to write home about. Certainly not \"Crack Rice\" as we call Stefano's rice.   Our friend had the garlic fries and he raved about them. He even took them back to his hotel for later. Melissa had the kids meal because she loves their chicken and doesn't eat much. This is a nice place and the staff is great. Family friendly. Check it out!",

This past week, we wound up visiting this location due to a coworker suggestion. We were looking for a 'healthy' spot where we could all grab a fresh salad. We settled on this spot and were on our way.   After a short drive, my group of three arrived at this location for lunch. We were pleased to see they had adequate seating for us.   Although our visit was during their noon rush, we quickly placed our orders at their counter and our food was brought to our table in timely fashion.   I ordered a 'large' Greek Salad with Falafels that was served with a side of pita bread. The others in my group ordered a mixture of other large salads with either chicken or steak skewers. The portions for all of our lunches were exceptionally generous. We all thoroughly enjoyed our selections and felt everything we were served was super fresh and delicious.  I have visited their Henderson location, and prefer this spot on Blue Diamond due to having a more spacious interior and an updated patio with more seating.    We all enjoyed our time and plan to be back soon!",

The salad is so fresh and flavorful that it doesn't need the tzatziki sauce, which is delicious. Having the rice under the salad makes it especially filling but hard to reheat later. It remains one of my favorite Greek dishes in town though. Their Feta Fries and gyros are good too, but I tend to order their lighter options.  This location is larger and more welcoming than the other, with some outdoor seating. Service has been friendly and takeout orders are ready quickly. While I'm happy they're doing so well that they expanded to another location, I wish it were closer to me- the drive from Summerlin is just as far to go to either.   TIP: Portions are large, so plan ahead or purposely order extra to take home. The spanakopita travels well!",

The price is a bit hefty for a casual place with no table service. Think about $15-$20 per person. However, the quantity and quality of the food are great enough to keep it in our rotation.   The atmosphere is fun and casual. They play all different styles of Greek music, which is cool to listen to. I just wish they had a location closer to us.",

I recommend the Gyro Plate with rice pilaf or Great Greek Gyro with feta fries if you're feeling indulgent! Haven't tried the baklava yet, but have heard amazing things about it.  Service has been top notch every time, with speedy serve times and plenty of staff to handle lines. It is an order at counter style eatery, so no table service. However, the effort that goes into the food and service deserves a gratuitous thank you. Treat them well and your tummies will thank you for a Great Greek time!",

The guy at the counter was super friendly too and even gave us a couple suggestions since it was our first time there.   Like I said, they were pretty busy when we came in so I can understand waiting a little longer than usual but when I got my food, which I took to go, it was cold and the pita bread was a little hard.  Regardless, the food was still delicious and very flavorful. I ordered the chicken skewer which I highly recommend along with the feta fries! Yum!  Another disappointment was that they forgot to include the side of hummus in my order :(  I was super disappointed since I was really looking forward to trying it. Oh well !   The food was delicious but I really wish it wasn't cold when I ate it and I wish I got to try the hummus. I gave this place 3 stars but I want to give it another shot and maybe dine in next time! Will definitely update this review!!",

The staff is very friendly and the restaurant itself os very clean and inviting. I love the old wood look and the exposed brick everywhere.

Absolutely terrific, delicious food.  When I ordered the gyros plate I was specific as to what I wanted and got exactly what I ordered and it was DELICIOUS.  Meat was well flavored and tender, the tzatziki was perfect and the pita was exactly the correct mix of soft/crispy that I like.  My friend discussed all her requirements while ordering at the counter and the gracious and helpful server made sure that absolutely everything was perfect before we were served at our table inside.  We were lucky enough to be against the window and watched a tiny boy and his father signing back and forth about his food demands...it would have gone viral if we'd filmed the 2-year old feeding himself the hummus.  So I think we were served immediately but can't be sure. lol.  I will not only go back but I've already been back.  And I ordered the hummus this time.  Great flavor.  Clean, great food, gracious and polite staff, efficient...it's my go to Greek forever.",

The staff is extremely friendly and patient to newbs like me, who have absolutely no idea what to order.   On the first visit I ordered the Gyro Plate with rice pilaf. It seemed a better option and a more bang for your buck kinda thing, but wasn't as yummy as the skewer. Second visit I went with that instead, and was definitely more satisfied.

If your in the mood for greek and just happen to be in the area its ok but i think there are much better options with better service.  Ive changed to 2 stars as im gettimg close to 30min wait for a f'in gyro!!  From now on I will take extra time to drive to rainbow where there is a much bettet greek spot!",

I usually get the skewers, like all the skewers they have and I'm always delightfully satisfied.   I couldn't think of any other place I'd rather try for catering my daughter's little 4th birthday staycation than The Great Greek. OMG it was AMAZING!  I ordered a half tray chicken 5 skewers of the chicken, steak, pork, and vegetable Appetizer combo  And it fed 10 people vegan and non!! Bonus, it was under $150 which was unbelievable!  If you have not tried this place please give it a shot. You will not be disappointed!!",

    "text": "Update-- 03/26/19:  Ordered here through the food delivery app Postmates. Postmates acts as a liaison for the restaurant, putting their menu up on the Postmates app, and then you order via Postmates to be connected to the restaurant who in turn makes the food how you put it into the Postmates app, and then Postmates delivers the food to your door.  So I used the app to order a traditional Gyro combo which I was prompted to select an optional drink & a complimentary included side or an upgraded side; both cost extra. I chose a Dr. Pepper for my drink, and I chose feta fries for my side. I also requested to have lettuce put on my Gyro. I also ordered grilled steak souvlaki plate cooked medium (because the Postmates app requires you choose a temp), with rice pilaf. And some soup and another A la cart feta fries. $37 for my meal after all of the up-selling Postmates does. Food is delivered to me after a long grueling day of packing & moving, I sit down with my family, open my meal, ask my partner where my Dr Pepper is, and I have regular fries, no Dr. Pepper, and no lettuce like requested. My partner began eating his meal and the steak he requested medium was about well done as a leather shoes. NOT EDIBLE! I am scratching my head wondering if I chose everything that I thought I did. I go back and look at my receipt from Postmates and it does show that I ordered a gyro combo but doesn't mention anything about the drink or feta fries. I know I was prompted to select these items, and so I go back and toy with the app and it confirmed what I already knew, it did prompt me to select all of the add-ons I wanted, but yet somehow Postmates delivered it to the restaurant with no modifications. I called the restaurant right away and explained my frustrations, and the woman who I assume was part of management says \"well this isn't our fault, call Postmates, I put in the bag what the computer tells me\", couldn't care less that there is obviously some glitch within the Postmates system, that isn't relaying the orders back to their business properly; and pretty much acknowledged there's a problem but she was sorry and contact Postmates for a refund if I was unhappy. Seriously how dense can you be? I'm trying to help you out, even though I got the short of the stick and had my night ruined with a bad meal. And yet I take the time to contact you to let you know there's a problem affecting the livelihood of your business and you shoo me off and tell me to go complain to the courier service instead for a refund? Gotcha, I guess no good deed goes unpunished and that was more than blatantly obvious by the arrogance of the employee on the phone. Also no accountability for the poor quality food we received as well, which really irks me. How hard is it to cook steak medium?! When this place is good they are really good, and when they are bad they are just absolutely awful. Whatever, lose more customers because Postmates can't apparently get it right.  Last few times I've been here I was not impressed. Nothing is more frustrating than when you go into a place that's fast casual and it takes them 20-30 minutes to make your food. That has been the case tonight and two weeks ago when I was in. No apologies from the staff either, which is even more irritating. But the thing that really gets me, they ask if you need togo utensils & yet they never put them in the bag. I'm on the go and how the hell am I suppose to eat my soup or pastichio with no spoon or fork? I know that sounds petty, but it's a huge problem when you're on the go. They need to figure out a way to expedite the food faster, sometimes it seems like disorganized chaos.",

NEVER EVER AGAIN. 2 gyros and 2 baklava were over 28.00 and i took 2 bites of the gyro and got sick. This clearly was not the lamb i ordered.

Much faster than a sit-down casual format.   I ordered the Great Greek Gyro and made it a combo, adding a drink and rice pilaf.

That's why they get four instead of five stars. I'd be here all the time if it were less expensive.   I've never had anything bad or disappointing here, and the kids like it. Even the picky one likes it because it's simple. We usually get chicken or steak souvlaki when we are there, and it's offered with fries or rice pilaf not also comes with a really good side Greek salad. The kids plates aren't quiet half price and come with one skewer instead of two. I order the full size and they split it.   Yesterday they were offering a special of mousakka (sp) and it was really good. It's egg plant, ground beef, potatoes and bechamel sauce  it also came with the side salad.   I recommend the feta fries, falafels, hummus with pita, cookies and baklava as well. We don't always get those but they never disappoint.   I like that they have healthy options that are just part of the regular menu, because you really can't go wrong with a protein and salad.",

When I asked one of the girls she just said let me check on it but was not apologetic. Finally got my food and she set it down again without an apology.   Today I ordered takeout and the girl who answered the phone placed me on hold before I could even speak. Then I asked what the rice bowl included and she said rice pilaf and salad. I had to ask again before she mentioned the rest of the ingredients. Once I placed my order she hung up quickly and didn't even say how long it would be. I was about to ask but was hung up on before I could.",

I ordered the 4 dip with pita bread that it comes with, the only thing that was decent was the hummus, and next comes the spicy crab, the eggplant was not good, tzatziki, which the meals come with (already) too much Tzatziki sauce. 4 dip should be 4 different flavors of hummus, if you ask me. The lemon/chicken soup was ok but watery. The chicken shrimp was decent, not great. I asked my girlfriend how her chicken skewer meal was with fries, and literally put her hand out, and slightly shook it, meaning ok, subpar, not great. They also didnt have Baklava was disappointing. Quality needs improvement & fixing. They receive the 3 stars because they seemed professional & friendly.",

Food is fresh and tasty and salad was really good & fresh with the dressing, but not happy with no ziki sauce, to me that's what I love most about gyro meat it's the combo of ziki and gyro. It's quite a ways from my house also so not traveling back, maybe I'll give it another shot in the future. All in all tasty food 3 stars for the lack of order completion, went to a Greek spot by my house for a side of zeek.",

Went there for the first time today for lunch.  I had the chicken souvlaki plate which came with either french fries or rice, Greek salad, Tzatziki sauce and pita bread.  I choose the french fries for my plate.  I love it that I have choices on what sides I want on my plate.    It came with 2 skewers of chicken with like 6 pieces on each. The chicken tasted great and was cooked prefect.  The side Greek salad was real fresh with plenty of veggies and tasted real good.  The french fries were cooked prefect crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside.  The Tzatziki sauce was fantastic almost as good as my mom's.  The pita bread came out nice and warm and tasted good too.  I asked for extra onions on my salad and on the side which they gladly gave me no extra charge.  The plate cost $12.95 so price was not too expensive for all the food you get.  There was plenty of condiments, napkins and etc on the counter and on the tables. It was enough food to keep me full all day.  The guy that took my order was real nice and answered all my questions.  The food came out pretty quickly and looked nice.  The place was real clean plenty of different seating areas.  I will be back for sure as a matter of fact thinking about going there for lunch tomorrow already.",

But True to most Greek places you'll be sure to find your salad on top of all of the hot things in your take out bag. That and the price is a little high is the reason for four out of five. You just have to ask them to bag your salad separate. Love that there is a good Greek place on the south west side of town now.",

I feel bad even leaving the three stars because the food is usually good but not the last few times I have ordered To go the chicken has tasted dry, almost like it's precooked and then warmed up once ordered, not fresh like it used to be. Then young lady who answered the phone was extremely unfriendly and was in such a hurry to get off the phone with me that she messed up my order. She didn't tell me \"ok that will be about 15 minutes\" like the nice gentleman usually does. In fact, she just said \"ok\" and hung up. I was shocked. My order was pretty simple, I asked for no olives and I get the food, and there's olives all over the salad... I know pick them off right? At this point you can taste the juice from the olives in the salad, (I know I'm weird) but that's why I asked for no olives, save them, don't waste them, I don't want them lol. She hands me my receipt and doesn't say a word. No thank you. No have a good night. No nothing. I get to my office and there's no utensils or napkins. DAMNNN IT! Pay attention lady!",

    "text": "Very rude and impatient employees, well some were good but most weren't good and not up to task. Me and my family went there near closing time and then the workers said they had no rice to make their work easier. And they stared at us because they wanted to leave so eagerly. But their food is good and if you get \"lucky\" you can get good rice. Lastly one of the ladies working at the register wasn't welcoming and we paid more than 40 dollars and got that rude service. Whoever is managing that restaurant needs to check their employees.",

We split a lemon soup which was fresh and hot, delicious and light. The food came out quick after that and had plenty of soft warm pita. The Greek cucumber yogurt sauce is the best to dip pita in!!  The half salad is a large portion, so if your a light eater it's perfect as salad doesn't keep well for leftovers. Grab a small baklava or butter cookie for after your meal. Dont wait, they sell out quickly.",

The usual is the great gyro and a steak plate and a small side of hummus....and the FETA FRIES!! Those are a must try. You can also do a mixed plate... I do steak and shrimp sometimes. Only reason they didn't get 5 stars is they messed up on my to-go order, nothing big just forgot my small side of hummus but was refunded for it.  Put it this way, I don't review anything but I just want people to know how great this place is!",

    "text": "I fell in love with this restaurant when going to their Henderson location. Then they opened the Blue Diamond location and I have to say it's not a good representation of this company at all. The food is still good but the service.. Jesus! The girls in the front are either overworked to the point where they don't remember to smile OR they really don't smile! There's one that I try to avoid at all cost when I go. I am a regular customer and by \"regular\", I mean I purchase food from here 3 times a week at least. However, I will NOT go when that girl is there. Which is hard because I think she's part of the owners family or something? She's unprofessional, rude AND unorganized. I heard her tell the kitchen staff \"If you have something to say, you can work somewhere else\" while I was eating today. I was shocked and that was the last straw. I will not eat at this location anymore. If I ever want their food I'll make the 15 mile trip to Henderson just to avoid this chick..",

(All we ordered was 2 salads and a skewer)  I ordered a chicken skewer to go with mine.  She said they ran out of chicken.  ???  I was adamant when placing the order NO OLIVES.  The cashier repeated no olives when ringing my order.  Guess what I got.  It was nasty and I did my best to sit and pick them out.  Today's visit was ridiculous.",

Only next time I will order tziki on the side, as it wasn't evenly distributed, but who cares cause the food was great.  Growing up in NYC and lots of gyros, I was very happy when hubby brought it home. Since first posting, we have been there over 12 times.  Three of those times we brought other guests, a few of them from out of town.  I just recommended them  Saturday night to a friend who lives in the neighborhood who didn't even know it existed.  They went yesterday (Sunday) for lunch and loved it.  I think they have a new customer who will be back. Reminds me of a greek fast food place back in my home town of Bayside, NY.",

When I approached the cashier/waiter/busser, the bald guy, he gave me an attitude. I asked what was taking long and his remark was (it's only been 18 minutes). The cooks heard him and looked at me from the window. The other lady worker apologized. I wanted to ask the bald guy how long his lunch break was and if he could scarf down the food in 12 minutes.   Update: I went back 8/3/17 and the service was amazing and dinner was awesome. Will be back :)",
