I missed having my protein style and and animal style burgers. double doubles, 3x3, and 4x4. One thing about fries or for you Belguim homies/French Homies Pomme Frites. First of all you gotta get all the moisture out when you're cooking fresh fries from Idaho potatoes. So you gotta cook it twice so it's crispy. No one likes a limp fry. Most women like it crispy and golden and soft and gushy in the middle when you take a bite steam rushes out in ooey goodness when dipped in ketchup. Yea...that was hot.... So this is what makes this place cool. Old Fashioned drive in 50's feel. Feels homey like california. Burgers with secret styles. Simple Menus. Yummy Thick shakes!  Bad things..FRIES...Eat em animal style to simulate a fully loaded baked potato. But be prepared to clog your arteries. Mmmm Mayo...",

This is the first burger I ever ate that made me want to say \"where's the beef?\" I wasn't hungry so it's my fault for ordering what I ordered: The hamburger combo: burger, fries & drink for around $5.60. Cheap eats. Maybe that's part of the appeal.  I made a rookie mistake. Since I have never been to an In-Out before here is my advice for future newbies like me: Get the Double, Double. You might as well get it animal style too (grilled onions, spread & mustard seared into your patty.)   While I appreciated the abundance of veggies in my burger it completely lacked any flavor. My fries was also cold by the time I received my order. Like it was sitting out two minutes too long on the counter. I know because I was watching the prep action. It seems each worker is assigned to a station responsible for only one or two things. It appears whomever was responsible for getting the finished product out to the customer was sleeping on the job. SO my cold fries was not good which only made for a more disappointing experience.  Don't know if I would go back since there are other burger joints I would like to check out next time. Shake Shack & Five Guys is going on my to-do list.  Minus 1/2 star for the cold fries so my overall rating is 2 1/2 stars, generously rating up.",

The claim is the burgers are never frozen, the fries are hand cut every day , the lettuce is washed fresh every day and the buns couldn't be fresher.  I believe all of this is True.  I will add that the buns are toasted perfectly.  There is a special sauce on the burger that gives it a nice tangy flavor.  The fries also have a perfect crunch and great flavor. The only drawback is the long wait for your meal but I know it was made with love and affection so I'm fine with it.",

    "text": "Love this place! First timer. Didn't go animal style because I wasn't even aware of it until after we left and I got a ton of messages about it.  We need this place on the west coast. I'm a huge Whataburger fan, and I have to admit, this places gives W a run for its money. But it's a slightly different style.   We grabbed their fries, a few double-doubles, and a couple of shakes (chocolate and vanilla). We could only slightly tell the difference between the chocolate and vanilla. Not sure if that's a bad thing, but if I have a craving for a chocolate shake, I'll likely go elsewhere.  The DD was great! Juicy without being over-greasy. Just enough for lunch without feeling guilty. They know what they're doing. The bun was soft but had a slight crisp that worked very well with the lettuce and tomatoes. We option for onion which I normally love but I'm not sure it added anything. The thousand island adds enough without the need of onion. (More experimentation needed).  Can't wait to go back... You know... When I'm in Vegas... Whenever that may be.",

    "text": "So many people rave about In-N-Out Burgers. I think they are just ok for a burger generally (matched against burger sit-down places, e.g., Islands) but are definitely good for a fast-food burger.  They use 100% pure beef burgers, hand-leafed (as opposed to shredded) lettuce, and sponge dough for the buns. You can taste the quality.   I like their lettuce wrapped burger (wrapped in lettuce instead of a bun). They call it  \"protein style.\"  Their french fries are actual slices of potatoes. I personally prefer the processed style fries at other restaurants (they mash the potatoes, reform them into sticks, bread them, and fry them). However, there is something homey and oddly nostalgic about natural fries cut from actual potato slices.  I will say that there is an unusually long wait (10-20 minutes?) for your food over other fast food establishment (5 minutes?), probably because items are made-to-order.",

    "text": "One of my all time favorite burger joints! They do one thing, and they do it well! A very simple menu of just burgers, fries, shakes, & soda......period!  I remember the very first time I ever walked into an In-N-Out............ordered me a hamburger, ate it............then thought..........\"is that it?\" I was wondering what's the big deal?  It wasn't until one of my friends, who is an In-N-Out fanatic told me - \"NO\"..........anytime you go to an In-N-Out, you must always order the Double Double!!!  Since that time...............whenever I'm on the mainland, and walk into a In-N-Out burger joint, I always order a Double Double!   What can I say about the In-N-Out burger joint............  1. I wished they would open one up in Hawaii.  2. Food is cheap, only $3.20 for a Double Double, & very tasty too! Burgers are made to order on the spot, hot & fresh..........not like some other joints where they are microwaved & put under the heat lamp.   3. A very simple menu. They just do burgers, fries, shakes, & soda..........keepin' it simple, & they do it well!  4. Restaurant is very clean, and the service is EXCELLENT!  5. Open fountain kept very clean...........McDonald's could learn a thing or to (hint: McCully McDonalds!).  Lots of free parking..........but the place is always crowded on matter what time you go there.........Ka CHING!  I also heard from a friend to order the Double Double \"Animal Style\"...........don't know what this is...........I'll have to try it one day.",

The line can be pretty long at this location, but it moved relatively quickly. Must have it again the next time I'm on the west coast. Looking forward to my next Animal Style!",

Their fries are crinkle cut.  During my stay in Vegas I had eaten here about 3 times. I was addicted.  There's no In-N-Out Burgers in New York or the east coast that I know of. The closet thing similar to it in my opinion would  would say is Shake Shack.  So to all my East Cost people if your on the West side- Do yourself a favor and try yourself some In-N-Out Burger and 4 get the Mickey D's and the Burger Kings.",

Evan the guy who took our order was rude and kept rushing us when we had 5 orders. He would shut off his headset after every order thinking we were done when we said we had a large order. Then we get up to the window and he try's to short us a fry that we paid for and showed our receipt. We work in retail and customer service and we were just very sad to see that they could just brush us off. He needs some serious customer service training. Very Disappointed.",

    "text": "This is a review for the In-N-Out Burger on W. Sahara Ave (just down the street of Palace Station). For those staying downtown this is the closest location (from Main Street head towards Las Vegas Blvd South and make a right on Sahara Ave).  This location may out of the way of the Las Vegas Strip, however, it is also not as crowded and frequented by visitors as much as the one off Tropicana Ave. One reason being this location does not have the souvenir shop. But if you're going just to satisfy your craving, be sure to check this location out the next time your in Vegas! Don't get me wrong, this location can still fill up too, however, the locations closest to the Las Vegas strip are frequented by a lot of tourists from all over too. :)  Being from Hawaii, I always look forward to In-N-Out Burger! Still crossing my fingers for a location to open up in Honolulu, Hawaii.  People who have never been here always tell me, \"small menu?\". Yeah, small menu, but big on taste! If you're doing it right, you don't need a big menu! The burgers are always juicy and mouthwatering!  The French fries are always  crisp and fried to perfection! I have since learned there are items you can order that ARE NOT on the menu board! Whaaaat? You gotta find out or ask someone who knows! Yummy!!! As always, I always order the Double-Double Meal A, with a side order Double-Double whenever I am here! (Haha). The milkshake is also to die for!   There's only so much I can describe a fast food chain burger, but you gotta try it to believe it! Juicy, delicious and mouthwatering!  Most In-N-Out Burgers in Las Vegas have ample parking, however, they can fill up pretty quickly especially during lunch and dinner/late night hours. The line inside to order may appear long as you walk in but I've noticed they tend to move fairly quickly.  The next time you are in Las Vegas, make a stop at In-N-Out for the experience! :p",

    "text": "Adapted from an earlier review of this place:  I teetered between giving this place 3 or 4 stars.  I like that they have a very limited menu. You have 4 options: burger, fries, soda and/or shakes. That limited menu allows for food to be made fresh and people too be served quickly.  I guess that is why they named the place in and out burger.    You can tell they are using quality meat, and not filler meats like other places.  You also can tell that they use fresh produce.  It was cool watching the guy peel potatoes for their fries.  I have to admit one thing though, the burger is too small for my liking. I ordered the 2 meat, 2 cheese burger, a.k.a. the double-double, and actually had room for another burger.  Fries are average. You will not see this restaurant's fries in your grocery freezer like some other places has it for themselves!  Shakes are decent but small as well.   Finally got around to trying the lemonade, and nothing special about it.  Two things make this a 4 star experience for me.  This first thing is them starting, to my knowledge, the secret menu!  I like ordering things animal style and doing the different variations that comes about from the secret menu.  The second thing is there is not an In-N-Out Burger franchise anywhere in Louisiana nor Houston.  Rarity gets them that extra star over a normal fast food chain.",

If you know In N Out, you likely know it is one of the most consistent chains out there. I have never been to one where the experience was any different. They are almost always busy, always polite, the food is fresh and consistent as it gets. It can take a little while, but not too long at all.   This location is just as consistent as the rest. Clearly they follow the strict In N Out standards. I usually visit at least once when in Vegas for business. As this is near the Strip, it can get even busier than most locations. I have seen many a folks on their way to and from the airport make the stop with their luggage. In N Out has that big of a following.   Of all the burger chains out there now, In N Out is still my favorite.   If you have not tried In N Out, you really should. You may not like, but you might absolutely fall in love.",

My favorite is their Double Double, Spread Only, and Extra Toast.  It really doesn't get any better than this and it's less than $4.00.  I'll make it a 3x3 if I'm a little hungry.  Obviously, I'm a huge fan of In-N-Out.  Recently, I've been sticking to just two Flying Dutchman's (2 patties & 2 slices of cheese only) to keep the starches low.  In my opinion, In-N-Out is one of the most consistent fast food joints out there. All that being said, I don't avoid too many In-N-Outs, but I do avoid this one.  The lines inside isn't too long, but it seems to take them a little longer to cook just two patties and cheese.  The drive thru lines always seem to be long and snakes through the parking lot.  Most locations will have a staff member taking your order before you get to the window to speed up the process when it gets busy.  This location doesn't do that, at least they didn't the last 3 times I've been here.  Then there's the cleanliness of the restaurant. I'm spoiled that I live very close to the cleanest and least busy In-N-Out in Las Vegas.  My In-N-Out is always spotless.  This location was a little behind on cleaning up a few tables the last 2 times I've been here.  Overall, I'm a huge fan of In-N-Out.  I'm just not a huge fan of this location. Regardless, I'm sure that I will be back to this location at some point. I just never know when I will have those In-N-Out cravings.   2017 In-N-Out Review #9",

I ordered a veggie burger, and upon getting home, found out that my \"veggie burger\" was a plain, untoasted bun, with two slices of wilted lettuce in between. No sauce, no onion, no tomato, no pickles, it didn't even have that signature in n out taste. To top it off, this \"burger\" was charged at the same price as their regular cheeseburgers, yet I got a fraction of what is normally offered. Can someone explain why the veggie burger wouldn't contain the veggies? And why you'd remove almost ALL ingredients and still dare charge the same price?  Tasted SO off, had to throw it away after a couple bites. Sad to see that Vegas in n outs don't offer the same quality of service that people are used to seeing elsewhere.",

If you wait in line for 30 minutes I would expect that someone would come outside and let you know their credit card machine isn't working. That way you're not stuck in line for another 30 minutes while you wait for everyone else to get food expect you.  Also, make sure you ask them to try your card at the window, it will work 10 times out of 10. The kid at the window will make sure to tell you, with attitude, that \"if your card doesn't go through it won't mean you get free food.\" My card had worked every time. They just don't want to make food past 1:00, even though they're open till 1:30 Friday and Saturday.  Seriously. If you're going to not accept credit/debit cards past 12:30 then maybe put a sign up, and you'll need to make a few more exits in your drive through so people don't have to wait for 1 hour.",

    "text": "For those few people not familiar with In-N-Out Burger, it is a chain that has a very small list of menu items.  They make hamburgers, cheeseburgers, double doubles (hamburgers with twice the meat) that all come with lettuce, tomato, onion, and a secret sauce.  They also have french fries, sodas, and milkshakes.  That's pretty much everything listed on the menu.    However, those in the know can personalize their burgers in a surprising variety of ways.  My favorite option is protein style where the bun is replaced with a large pieces of crisp lettuce large enough to hold it all together.  Others will order theirs animal style with grilled onions, though I find this messy if you don't have a bun to absorb the extra liquid.  You can also skip the patty altogether and order a grilled cheese sandwich if that is more your thing.  I took a trip through the drive through at this location on my way out of Las Vegas.  I ordered my usual favorite - a cheeseburger, protein style, with ketchup instead of the sauce, with onions.  They made it perfectly.  The lettuce, onion, and tomato were crisp, and there was just the right amount of ketchup so that the burger was not dry nor was it soggy.  The fries were crisp, golden, and steaming hot.  I don't know what it is about the fries at In-N-Out, maybe the oil they're fried in, that makes them so tasty.",

The secret menu is absolutely delicious (my favorite is the animal style fries-- it's a meal on its own) and for people on diets, INO offers protein style burgers that replaces the bun with lettuce. Do a quick Google search for \"In-N-Out secret menu\" and you'll get the full rundown.   Drive-through is normally faster than getting it in the store but if you want to preserve the taste you should definitely eat it immediately after purchase. It's still amazing slightly cold, but there is a big difference when you eat it fresh off the burner.   Although the location may have something to do with it (university campus), lines are almost always present at any INO in the Vegas area. Despite that, it's plenty worth the wait.   Give In-N-Out a shot and you'll never go back to any other fast food joint for a burger again.",

On this visit I ordered the double double mustard grilled burger, fries well done (double fried), and the Neapolitan Shake (chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry) - all of which were stellar. Fresh ingredients and extremely friendly staff make for a wonderful experience at these burger joints. All chains are within a certain distance from the ingredient manufacturer in order to ensure fresh same day delivery of products, and it is very apparent.  I can definitely see why In n Out is such a renowned burger joint on the west coast. While in the quick moving line I FaceTimed my brother back home in the south because I knew he had been a few months prior, he practically shed a tear from wanting an In n Out burger so badly. I didn't realize the effect that the FaceTime was going to have on him but it just goes to show how amazing these restaurants truly are!",

Wait, that is exactly what most California transplants do. I have to say I just don't get it. We happened to be doing In-N-out burger for lunch at work today and I was going to pass and just grab something from the bakery next door but I decided to see just how unlike in n out I could make the burger and well.... It worked. They made my burger exactly how I asked for it, a double double, mustard grilled, with chopped hot peppers.. Yes I said chopped hot peppers and animal style.   Now that you have swallowed that In-N-Out put hot peppers on my burger I will just put it out there. In-n-Out is Ov-er-rated. The burgers are not anything that stands out as being all to spectacular and the fries even when you request well done fries so they come out crispy instead of mushy they are still lack luster. My recommendation would be to take out a personal loan from your bank and hit up the nearest fat burger.    Basically it is safe to say that if you have never been to an in-n-out you may want to try it to build your own opinion but it is nothing that really makes me say wow. But if you happen to be a straight cheeseburger enthusiast and don't like any of the extras that you can get at most other places this might be for you.",

The other one near the strip isn't so great.  The taste has never changed since I remember the first time eating here many many years ago, which is a good thing!  I got me a 3x3 and animal style fries. Oh boy was I in calorie Heaven!  Everything was fresh as they can be. The fries was piping hot. The burger literally just came off the grill.  I have to try the milk shake since that's what everyone keeps on raving about and I'll go over the top and add grilled onions.  I will keep on coming back and visiting this location every time i'm in town!  oh btw, there was this hella cute white boy with a birth mark / mole on his face either operating the deep frier for the fries or putting the animal style condiments on the fries on Sunday, June 26, at about  4pm.

I was surprised how in expensive it was because a double cheeseburger, fries, and a drink at Five Guys would have been easily $12-$14!!

The double double with fries was excellent.  For me, what sets In'N'Out apart is the freshness of the accoutrements - the lettuce and tomato were crisp and delicious.  The beef and cheese were tasty as well, but as a Chicagoan, I've had the same flavors at Billy Goat and Wolfy's.  They, like In'N'Out, have excellent, fresh ground beef.  The fries at In'N'Out are superior in that they are thin and crispy - thin yellow fries a la McDonald's, but fresher, and (sadly) much shorter.  What is up with half inch fries?  But that is a minor quibble to their usability.  They were quite tasty.    What I loved most was the chocolate milk shake -- loaded with chocolate and very creamy.  A five dollar shake at half the price, and it did not even need the bourbon.  I won't go into In'N'Out withdrawal, but I was very pleased to experience it in the desert sun.",

This 50s diner-esque fast food joint offers a simple menu with an extra fun & not-so-secret menu that you can explore all over the internet. On days when my tongue is not so accommodating of sliced raw onions, I'd call for the animal style cheeseburger which includes the same basic ingredients - burger patty, lettuce, tomatoes, cheese - with pickles, sauteed onions and dressing. Add a shake to that and you'll have bundled up enough calories to earn yourself a good work out for the night.   But I digress.  I absolutely love the speed that comes with each order and the efficient staff. Place is always well-maintained and people keep coming back for more. You can now say goodbye to other burger joints. This is the place to be.",

We found the nearest location by google mapping... apparently, theres a bunch of locations in Las Vegas.  Headed to the drive thru on a late Sunday afternoon, and boy, the line was really long.    I girl was walking up to each vehicle to take orders.  The menu is very small... about 4 different item on the menu.  We decided to order the regular and a double double burger... you have a choice of with or without onions.  On their secret menu, you can get your burgers or fries Animal Style... its basically something like a thousand island sauce. I recommend that on the French fries because the fries were nothing special by itself.  I recommend also getting the double double burger.  Its basically just another hamburger patty... the patty is small anyways so another one isn't super huge... trust me, it's better.  The burger itself isn't anything special either but it still beats White Castle burgers (which were pretty bad).",

    "text": "In-N-Out is one of the best burger places you can find in Vegas. They offer many different types of burgers from cheeseburger, hamburger, Double Double, and so much more. Their well known French Fries are so fresh that you can see them making it from scratch of cutting the potatoes into slices and frying them. In-N-Out also have the \"Secret Menu\" where you can order tons of stuff. You can find the \"Secret Menu\" in their website. The \"Animal Style Fries\" from the secret menu is the one I usually order and trust me, IT'S THE BEST! It has fried onion and their \"spread\" sauce. If you want to be fit, they have the \"Protein Style\" burger where instead of buns, they replace it with lettuce.  If you want more spice in your burger, they offer the \"Yellow Chili Pepper\" as one of the condiments. The chili taste very good with the burger and would probably make you sweat a little. Add the \"spread\" sauce to your burger and experience the taste of it. It may taste something that is very familiar.  If you want some dessert, you should try their shakes! Their shakes are very delicious and will make your stomach satisfied and happy.  Their fast food restaurants are always busy in the drive thru and inside. The facility inside In-N-Out is alright. They always have someone to clean up the restroom and the dining room.  Overall, In-N-Out is the best burger fast food restaurants I have ate so far because of they make everything from scratch.",

There was a wait (as usual) but it moved swiftly which my hungry tummy truly appreciated!  It truly did not disappoint. My burger was so fresh and juicy! I do have to take off one star only because I just don't like the fries. I'm not quite sure. They just taste funny to me. I think it's because my body is programmed to like frozen fries! lol",

The service, even when no one is in the line with you, takes forever. My group went there twice.   The burger was decent. It was not great. It tasted just like a Wendy's burger, just slightly more fresh.  The fries, both times I got them, were bland. Basically tasteless, except for the taste of oil . I would never order those fries again. They are boring. The rest of the people with me got my fries after about the third one I tried. Maybe I should have had a few drinks at the hotel before I tried them, but sober, they are just horrible.   It gets more than one star because you can customize and they actually listen. The sauce is pretty tasty. Other than that, I didn't see anything remarkable about it. I just like a place that actually listens to your order.  It's fast food. It tastes like fast food. When it comes to fast food, it has some of the worst fries I have ever had. The bun is standard. The meat is standard. The sauce and vegetables being fresh and tasty was what makes it just slightly better.   If you go there, just think fresh tasting Wendy's and you will not be disappointed. Skip on the fries or get tons of ketchup and salt to make up for the lack of any flavor.",

The only thing Five Guys has going for it is the peanuts. This location is a little slow, but they do an excellent job and the people working there are really nice. I get the triple animal style with no bun and extra cooked fries. The shakes are great too. I got strawberry, but read another review where you can get it Neopolitan style which I will definitely get next time. I so wish we had this place back east because I would eat here at least once a week. I had the little peppers too, but they were a little too hot for me, but I ate them anyway because I like peppers. Will probably hit this place on the way to the airport on my way home. Yes, it's that damn good!!!!!!!!!!!!!",

    "text": "Ok, I apologize in advance to all of the fans of this franchise.  Everyone talks favorably about the food and every time I drive by, they are busy...someone please explain!  Maybe I'm just having bad luck. The first time I went, the fries were overcooked, and the burger was just ok. So, I thought I'd give them a second try. I mean, there has to be a reason so many love it.   So I went again a year later, and this time, the fries were not as overcooked, but still were just not that good. It's hard to explain, but they have a strange aftertaste or texture I can't place. I still ate them, but with catsup (which I NEVER use normally).  But the big disappointment was the burger this time. It was so dried out. I was wishing there was more of their sauce on it to make up for the meat, but it was just not there. Sigh.   Like I said, maybe this was just a fluke, 2 times, but I just don't get it.  There is almost a cult like following of fans for this place, and I'm sure I will be hated by many for my review.   But before y'all construct the noose, consider that I'm not a snooty foodie...I love almost every fast food spot and all the way up to 5 star spots. I have only given out 2 or 3 ratings less than 3 stars, so it's hard to not satisfy me.  Again, I'm sorry, but this place just does not do it for me.  Ok, I'm ready for my stoning now. :(",

Ah, heck with it, 5 star it is.  My only complaint about In-N-Out is the fries.  I don't know why I don't like them, I think that they're too fresh, as they taste too much like a raw potato to me.  Freeze them first or something!  The burgers themselves are just as good as Fatburger's, and are just plain amazing.  I typically go with Animal Style, but even the normal is great.

That must be why when I tell them NO PICKLES, I don't get any pickles on my burger.

This joint was absolutely busting to the seams with hungry folks looking for their fast food fix on a Wednesday at lunch time. The lines were long, the wait for our food was substantial and the seating is scarce. Ugh.   As for the food? Well, the burgers are pretty tasty, but Portillo's in Chicago stomps this competition for my favorite fast food burger. The toppings, like the tomatoes and lettuce are crisp and fresh, but the burger itself is thin, sad and unsubstantial. Good, but not great.  And if I'm being honest, my stomach wasn't quite right after lunch.  The fries? Kinda soggy. They require lots of ketchup.   And what's up with the menu? Hamburger, cheeseburger or double burger? That's it? No chicken? WTF?",

    "text": "2017 Review 37/100  Guys...it's In-N-Out. When can you ever go wrong with In-N-Out? If you're an East Coaster like me, you know that In-N-Out is the holy grail of West Coast dining and thus you must make a pilgrimage to the nearest In-N-Out location whenever you find yourself within close proximity.  This most recent trip to In-N-Out was a more special occasion because my friend who was traveling with me had never been before. It was exciting to me a part of her first experience and, of course, she loved it. Especially the Animal Style fries.  You can't beat a good Protein Style burger, fries and a drink for a few bucks. In-N-Out, you never let me down.",

    "text": "It's been almost a year since I've been in the West Coast, so when I came to Las Vegas in June, I had to hit up an In-N-Out.   Still as good as I had remembered it to be! I ordered the #3 combo but I swapped the regular fries for animal style (with extra spread on the side, as suggested by a fellow Yelper on my In-N-Out review of one of the LA locations). The onions were cooked for a quick few seconds and added a slight sweetness to each bite. The rest of the veggies were fresh, which I always appreciate in my burgers.   To the Yelper who suggested I get extra spread on the side for my animal fries -- THANK YOU! The extra packets really helped a lot with the fries at the bottom.",

Burger was good but the fries are not that great... kind of tastes like cardboard. But the service was quick and the employees found time to clean the tables between seatings even though it was so crowded. Definitely a place we visit during trips since we don't have an In-N-Out in Washington/Oregon. Super crowded at this location!   Don't forget to ask for a hat :)",

Thankfully, In-N-Out has it's not-so-secret menu and I don't feel too bad eating my Double-Double Protein (bun becomes hand leaf lettuce) and Animal (sauce, pickles, and grilled onions) Style, which clocks in at 520 calories. It's a filling and satisfying burger. I usually skip the fries here because of guilt.  When I'm sick, I crave shakes. Again from their not-so-secret menu I get the Neapolitan shake. The shakes are so thick that you can really taste all three flavors individually. I love it when it goes from vanilla, to strawberry, to chocolatey. It's more bang for your buck!   In-N-Out is a chain and I'm rarely a fan of those establishments, but In-N-Out truly is freshness you can taste. It's not everyone's cup of tea, but I am definitely a fan.",

I mean it's \"fast food\", how good can it be?\"  I'm here to tell you that it's that good. And then some.   I'll spare you the rundown on what INO is all about - the \"AxB\", the \"secret menu\", fries cooked to order, Animal Style -  you can use the Googles for that. I'm just going to tell you that a Double Double Animal Style is perhaps the most delicious burger in America, and the Animal Style Fries are gratuitous, glutenous goodness.   One thing to note is that while INO seems like \"fast food\", it is anything but. Food is cooked to order, and combine that with it's popularity and frequent long lines means a wait for your burgers. But that wait is SO worth it. In-N-Out was a must stop for me every time I went to California for my last job, but it had been about 5 years since I had an INO experience. For some reason, it just wasn't on my Vegas radar. I will no longer make that mistake on my future visits to Sin City.",

When I got to work, everything was really fresh and great. I either get a #1, but instead of regular fries I get animal style with both raw and grilled onions, and no tomato! One complaint about all locations of In-N-Out is that their smoothies are always too thick to drink. You have to wait a while for it to not be too thick or it literally won't go up the straw. I really dislike the fries at In-N-Out but it's tolerable animal style. The burgers make it worth coming here. You can get a 3x3 or even a 6x6 if you're hungry enough! They're only cooked well done and it's all real beef but they still make it really juicy. The flavors in it are amazing. I don't know what it is exactly but it has the perfect amount of everything in it. And the cheese is always melted as well unlike most fast food chains. I have not once gotten an order wrong here. They always have amazing service too!",

    "text": "I hate to leave one star for In-N-Out seeing as I'm a die hard fan but this was lame. Placed my order. Number 2 (cheeseburger) mustard fried with onions add chopped chilies AND ketchup in the burger along with their fabulous spread with an Arnold Palmer. Lady taking my order repeated my order and didn't mention ketchup. So I asked \"Did you get the ketchup on the burger too?\" She said (with extreme confidence) \"Yes!\" I pull up to the window to pay. The lady there (not sure if she was the same one taking the order thru the speaker) repeats my order back to me. Once again no mention of ketchup. I ask if they got the ketchup on the burger. She says no but she'll get it added on. I get my receipt at 4:40 and then wait for the 2 cars in front to go and it's not a long wait before they pull off. I pull up to the window and wait longer than the last two cars. I get my food at 4:52. Guess what? You got it! NO KETCHUP IN MY BURGER and the fries are overdone. So In-N-Out is known for their burgers, fries, and shakes. They got 2 out of 3 wrong. And that's just because I didn't get a shake so you can't screw that up I suppose. If you're gonna only have 3 things on your menu perhaps those three things should come out right. My Arnold Palmer however was made correctly hence the one star. Lady at the food window did also apologize for the wait so that was nice. I'm not in a rush so I don't have a problem waiting, but if I wait and they still get it wrong, that kinda sucks. I've posted a picture of the fries and the receipt.",

I ate my usual cheeseburger with no onions with a side of well-done fries. The burger was on point: the bun was toasted perfectly, meat was juicy and seasoned well, vegetables were fresh and crisp, the perfect dressing-to-burger ratio. OMG. Even the fries were perfect. Not too crispy, not too limp. Next time I'm in Vegas, you can be sure I'm going out of my way to eat at this In-N-Out location. Sure, the wait time for food is noticeably longer, but it's worth it!",

However, you usually aren't waiting long, and they move people rather fast. I love the fact that they offer all their burgers protein style (wrapped in lettuce/ without the bun). They grill the onions and they offer animal style fries!! ( Their special sauce which I think is like a thousand island dressing, grilled onions, and cheese).They cook your food to order, and it is always hot and fresh.  If you haven't tried it, definitely try them. But preferably off the Vegas strip and in maybe even in Socal. ;-)",

I am an East Coast transplant that did not grow up with In-N-Out.  Actually, never even heard of it before moving to Las Vegas! I also did not get what the fuss was about.  It's just a burger, isn't it?  I remember the first time I went with friends to In-N-Out, and I felt like I was caught in a time warp.  The place seemed like it was plopped down in a 1955 bubble.  Everything from the uniforms, to the decor (including the pictures), to the food itself, made it seem like we should be served by a car hop.  In a day when even McDonald's serves gourmet coffee, salads, and burritos, it was surprising (and refreshing) to have a place with basically a 1/2 page menu of just burgers, double burgers, cheese burgers, double cheese burgers, fries, and shakes.  This model is what made McDonald's what it was, by the way.  The burger tastes fresh, and is accompanied well by lettuce, tomatoes, and onions (raw or fried).  You can also order its infamous \"animal style,\" which is some concoction that appears to involve Thousand Island dressing.  (It is good, by the way).  I appreciate that they allow \"protein style,\" for those on Paleo, Keto, or Gluten-free diets, so it will come without the bun.  The burger is satisfying, and the service is usually friendly.    I like this location.  It stands proudly on Sahara, with a huge thunderbolt of its logo.  It used to be in a \"foodie desert\" in the area right near Palace Station.  But that has changed in recent years.  Now, there are a lot of cool places to eat around there.  But it is still good to go to Old Faithful from time to time.  It is also super easy to swing by, as they have a drive-thru that is easily accessible (not always the case these days), and easy to navigate to from the street. They have never gotten an order wrong for me, and they are still friendly.",

I was a little disappointed when I saw the beef patties were so thin. But I was hopeful what the burger lacked in beef would be made up in taste and flavor. No such luck.  I found the burger to be just okay, nothing spectacular or special in any way.  Honestly, in my opinion, I'd much rather have a Big Mac or Whopper. I know some people love their burgers, but I'm just not one of them. Can't say I'll ever go back again.",

This is a usual sighting at most In-N-Outs. Robots I tell you. ROBOTS!   Decided to drive through and we were in an out (pun intended) in less than five minutes. We had about ten cars ahead of us so I found this incredibly impressive. My classic order is the double-double, animal style. Those grilled onions are money. I'm not a fan of their fries but this visit I snuck a few from my buddy and they kinda hit the spot!   The burger was juicy and stayed together until the last bite. This was a full 5-star experience but I'm left with one question...  Why did I forget to order a milkshake?!",

The food does take some time to come out, but everything is made on the spot so quality takes time.

As we are in line, the worker puts up cones in front of our car (there is also a car behind us). No acknowledgement or nothing when he did it.  Maybe he was new but huh?  What the F?    There were a bunch of cars already in line, why wouldn't he put the cones behind the last car?  How would 2 to 4 extra hamburgers and fries make any difference?

Its food is never frozen, the potatoes are cut on site, and you'll see them making the burgers fresh. They have a \"secret\" menu that's not really secret, just not displayed. They are known for their animal style fries mostly, but they have different things you can do like add pickles, grilled onions, substituting the spread for ketchup and mustard. You can also order fries well done, which adds an extra crunch to your fries.   This location is one of the lesser busy locations, but can be decently busy depending on the time of day that you visit.  The service is fast and the store is kept clean.

Knowing this place is really hyped, I decided to come to In N Out again. This location was more crowded than the last one, so I had trouble finding seats. However, we found some at the end. It was a table for two, so I decided to let my parents sit while I stand. I ordered the same thing as last time- Animal style burger and fries. The wait time was a bit longer than the location in California, but that was probably because there were more people. When I recieved my order, I was surprised. I somehow received Animal style fries, as well! Of course, we were charged extra. I take the benefit of the doubt and say that I miscommuniated and said something wrong. My parents didn't look too happy. Feeling a bit guilty, I went ahead and tried to eat the too layer for them.  It was the best thing of my life. I found eating the fries Animal Style so much better than eating them plain. Well- not SO much better.... It was just a unique experience. I thought it was delicious. It went really well with my burger and I was more filled up than last time I went (in which I ordered regular fries).",

They always ask if I'd like ketchup and mustard and I decline. Anyways I pulled up to the window and she hands me my drink.. I wait a few minutes for my order she starts handing me a regular double double and I tell her it's wrong I asked for protein style and she says \"it doesn't say that here it says lettuce, tomato, onion only I looked at her with a blank look on my face and say well I asked for protein style.. At which she turns around with an attitude and comes back and says sorry about that we'll have that out in a bit. I wait for 5 minutes and she returns with the protein style.. I thought I checked it for sauce which I guess I didn't because now I'm home sitting with a half melted cheese burger with sauce on it. I'm debating on going back but I'm too tired  Next time I will speak to a manager if they mess up my order twice. Not happy at all. Maybe I'll try the In&Out on Tropicana",

    "text": "Everyone that knows me, knows I LOVE IN-N-OUT!  Yes there is none in Hawaii but if we had one, they would know my name as I would be going there often.  I travel to California and Las Vegas every year for the past 14 years and for the past 10 years I have been eating here at least once every single time.  Yes I truly love this burger, the place (nice and bright and clean), the people (they are always smiling and up-beat and is willing to please), and there is always one some where that I can pull up to and get my fix on.  With all that said, I will get into the nitty gritty about this place as most people know that they have a great burger, shake, and fries.  What I am about to write is what I know and have ordered at one time or another just to see which way I like best ( so far I liked them all ).  Yes, what I'm talking about is their secret menu.  Secret menu?  Yes, they have a menu off the menu you see.  It's so that the normal person won't hold up that already long line trying to figure out what you want.  Kind of like Starbucks and all the different ways to order your drinks.  Wait, you didn't know about that too?  Oh boy, that's for another review.  LOL  Ok the buns here come toasted and burgers are done medium-well.  But you can request that your bun come either no toast or extra toasted.  Make everyone that didn't know you could do it this way and say the two magic words... Medium rare and whoop there it is, a nice pink center that most don't see as they didn't know you could get it this way.  Besides the single and double, you can ask for a THREE BY THREE or FOUR BY FOUR.  Yup you guessed it.... You will get a triple or quadruple cheeseburger.  Before, one could order up to a 100 by 100.  Unfortunately, that is a thing of the past.   What, you like extra condiments on your burger... No problem as you can get extra for any burger (example for extra mustard) by asking mustard grilled. What the cook will do is put extra mustard on the top of the patty before flipping it so that the flavor soaks into the meat.  Oh yeah!  I'm sure some of you cooks out there is going to try this at home.    I'm sure here and there you will hear someone ask for ANIMAL STYLE (you can get this with almost any burger).  Animal Style is grilled onions cooked in the delicious meat juices which is combined with extra Thousand Island sauce, mustard grilled patties, and extra pickles. (btw this is my favorite at the moment but I also add raw onion, yes you can have both)  What, you're feeling that you want that delicious grilled onions and Thousand Island Sauce on your fries.  YES PLEASE, you can do it by ordering Animal Style fries.  YUMMY!  So, you are on a no carb diet!  No problem, you can ask for PROTEIN STYLE.  That's right no buns but you get your burger wrapped in lettuce.    Some Monkish people prefer to keep their rabbit food and carnivore-ish food separate.  If this is you, you can do this by ordering a SALAD ON THE SIDE.  If the employee is a newbie and doesnt know how to do this, then you can ask for extra lettuce, tomatoes, and if you want onions on the side.  To be really sneaky and get the most out of it, you can also ask for an extra packet of spread and BOOM you got yourself your own side salad at no extra cost.  Now we come to the FLYING DUTCHMAN. This is for all those who are looking for something Mr. Atkins would come out of his grave and give his stamp of approval.  Two slices of melted cheese between two burger patties.  No bunny food, no carb loading buns, just pure protein.  You could do animal style with this as well but they will but they will put the onions with the cheese but the Thousand Island Sauce and pickles on the side as it would be too messy and get all over you unless that's your thing.  Hey some of you are strange individuals.     You have a friend, (we all have that one friend who is vegan or vegetarian. Yes there is a difference) no problem.  Just ask for the GRILLED CHEESE.  You will get a toasted bun with two slices of American cheese melted perfectly between the two buns.  If you want you can even ask to get the standard lettuce, tomato, and raw onions inside.  I like In-N-Out fries but I LOVE McDonald's fries better.  If you are like me, you can order your fries differently as well.  If you want them extra crispy, just say, WELL DONE.  The fries will come out more dry and crunchy. If you like opposite 180 then ask for LIGHT and you will get that limp and oily and just add salt and there you go.  Some like the TWO MINUTE fries which is still crunchy and a little raw in the middle.  Last but not least is the shake and floats.  You have the standard choice of chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry shakes.  What you want all three?  You got it!  Ask for the NEAPOLITAN.  So you want to wolf down a nice cold one without struggling to suck out the goodness?!?!?!  Then try ask for the ROOT BEER FLOAT.  You will get a half cup of root beer topped with a swirl of vanilla soft-serve",

As soon as we checked into our hotel, my friends brought me here to try. & When i arrived, it was about 11pm, but there was such a long line up. It was around 15 minute wait, then i ordered, and got my food in 10 minutes.  Had my first one, and had to get another. It was so good and fresh! O went for the most simple burger, with cheese, lettuce, onion, patty, and sauce of course. It was so simple, yet so delicious. I also ordered a side of fries. The fries come unsalted and they provide you packets of salt so you can salt them yourself to your own liking. Loved my first experience. Would definitely go again and give other burgers/poutines a try!",

    "text": "Being from the east coast, I have heard and seen the obsession that is In-N-Out. I've had burger FOMO, extreme jealousy, and hanger that I have never been able to try fast food animal style.  Enter Kayla R and my visit to Vegas where I unlocked my best burger life when she took me to pop my In-N-Out cheery! *cries of joy*  As a first timer with no frequent access to In-N-Out I decided to go big. I ordered the double double and a side of animal style fries. I was not dissapointed.  OK let us talk about this for a second. This is not gourmet, this is not fancy, this is really well done fast food. In fact, this is the best fast food burger I have ever had. Not too greasy, good meat to bread ratio, and of course that spread tho. I'm a sauce girl, and the IN-N-Out spread is damn good.  Onto the fries. I got those animal style which means spread and onions. These need the attention of a fork and a few napkins. Were they difficult to eat in the car? Yes. Were they worth it. ABSOLUTELY!  So there's the whole east coast burger (shake shack) versus west coast burger (In-N-Out) debate. Don't get into that nonsense, I don't think it's fair to compare the two because they are different and special in their own ways. In-N-Out is in a league of its own, and I would gladly consume double doubles regularly if I was on the west coast!",

I honestly didn't have the highest expectations as I typically don't fall for the hype of restaurants, but My God. This place is amazing! The moment I bit into their Double Double burger, my life changed. I'm slightly depressed as I live on the east coast with no opportunity to have the greatness of an In-N-Out burger. While on my visit in Vegas, I literally had a burger every day of my visit. The freshness and consistency of this place are absolutely amazing! The flavors for a burger under $5 rivaled burgers that I've spent 3x as much on.   Le sigh, we'll meet again one day.",

The cashier asked \"animal style?\" and I agreed.   The sandwich was very tasty however the french fries were a disappointment. It was bland and could have used more salt. I normally ask for my fries to be cooked \"well done\" but wanted to see how their fries normally tasted. Now I know.  I definitely will be back for more of their burgers and maybe next I'll ask for the fries to be done animal style as well.",

You can't beat that anywhere!  Fries has always been a bad part for me cause it tasted like card board but i realized you can order it well done and it's crispy to the perfection that I like!   Animal style everything and well that solves all my taste buds!  I always order a double double with no tomato and animal style.... tomatoes makes my burgers mushy and that's one reason why I don't order it in burgers... It ruins the texture and the extra dripping sauces of the burger is just messy.",

The bun was toasted perfectly as usual, plenty of caramelized grilled onions, a generous amount of extra spread as I requested, cheese everywhere, and perfectly cooked hamburger patties.   There was a line in the drive thru' as usual, but it is always worth it when it is for freshly made food.   Some of the best places to eat are the ones that have limited and specialized  menus. In-N-Out is a prime example of this concept, and I have enjoyed their food at this location for years.",

    "text": "Best employees at a fast food place hands down, but why In-N-Out has such a following is a mystery. The thing about the burgers is that the meat is great and the buns are nicely toasted, but then things take a turn for the worse.  Upon the nicely toasted bun they spread some sort of mayonnaise based goo they refer to as \"spread\".  Unless you stop them, they will pile up onions that reek to high heaven on top of the great meat.  Your car will smell like In-N-Out for a week if you get take-out.  After such a promising start, the end product is hardly recognizable as a traditional hamburger.  Then there are the fries.  Once again, and this is very encouraging, they start with fresh cut potatoes.  Unfortunately, the put these poor potatoes through some sort of top secret process that turns them into cardboard within 15 minutes after they go into your take-out bag.  Here's an In-N-Out dining tip.  Mercifully, In-N-Out will let you have your burger your way.  Go through the take-out, and just get a hamburger, or even a double hamburger, and the bun. Do not allow them to put anything on the burger.  The bun and the meat are the best parts of the In-N-Out burger.  Take it home and add the things you like.  If you like a good burger, you'll be very pleased.  As for the fries, here's a money saving tip.  Ask them if you can have the little cardboard tray they put the fries in.  Then when you get home, just eat the little tray.  You'll hardly notice the difference.",

The line was ridiculously long but we already knew about the popularity of this place so we didn't mind. We were lucky to get a table right before we placed our orders. The wait was a bit long but boy was it worth it. BEST BURGER EVER! The West Coast won this one. It was my first time but since I saw everyone getting the famous spread, so did I and wow. It was so good, I slathered it on everything, the fries, the burger, my fingers... I wanted to get two burgers but my friends looked at me like I was bugging so I didn't, and I'm glad because I was really full after just one.  Stop being selfish and bring this to the East Coast already! Until then I'll impatiently wait until the next time I'm in Cali.",

So happy to be there, offered me a water cup when I said no soda, just emanating joy. The burger though, it was sad, I asked it if it had had a death in the family, it didn't even crack a smile.   Maybe because I always get the Double, but this poor thing could have been vegetarian! Paper thin meat, I always get extra onions, and even that wasn't a lot! It was just sad. The fries weren't hot! i have NEVER bumped into that before at an In-n-Out, however I didn't ask them to fix it, and I know they would have. They happiness of the server made up for the sadness of the burger.  It was clean, and twice someone came out to clean again, even though they were slammed!  Always try to go when it isn't Lunch or Dinner rush! They run out of tables very quickly. Not a rush time and it's golden.  I asked the family next to me and they said the shakes are really good, I have never tried one, but will next time.  Parking, again, not during a rush is plenty, during those times though it can be awful.   If you go through the drive through they will ask if you're eating in your car and wrap your burger so that you can control it one handed! Awesomeness!",

They had a separate  window for the merchandise which was awesome !!! The associate Austin was super helpful and patient with us. There were so many great things to choose from and we also got a complimentary cup for spending I think it was $50.",

When we arrived, ravenous from the images of double-doubles dancing in our heads, we started to pay the driver. He said \"no, no. I'll wait for you\". No joke, he turned off the meter and just chilled while we got our food. Because of his generous nature, we brought him back a #1.

Yes, they are much better then most of the food you can get in Vegas, but I just cant understand why people seem to like them..there is nothing particularly special about a large greasy burger with the gimmick of putting as many patties on it as you want.  My parents used to own a business right down the street off of tropicana I believe and coming from green valley wed drive by this place all the time..and every once in a while wed stop by. As a kid i didnt like it that much..but then coming back when i was in my 20's to party in Vegas i tried it again and realized just how bad it is.  If you're an out of towner from the east or midwest, dont bother eating here, you can get better food at any local beef/hot dog joint. If your from Vegas or the west..enjoy, because its better then most the food you can get out there.",

OK, back to our regularly scheduled program.  Coming from the East Coast, I wasn't familiar with In 'N' Out Burger, but it was hard to ignore the paeans promulgated by its passionate proponents. Like others, I enjoyed the old time feel of the place, and the secret menu is both fun and useful. Armed with such terms as \"animal style\" and \"well done\", I was ready to do battle. My order? A double double, and French fries animal style.  I gotta tell ya, I was a little disappointed. Yes, it's a good burger. For a fast food chain, it's a very good burger...but a fast food burger nonetheless. More disappointing were the fries. I thought the fries themselves were soft and bland (I would return at a later date, and get my fries well done, but they were no better). Animal style was a definite improvement, but still not a sublime experience.  Was I expecting too much? Did the five minute trip to my room cause the fries to lose their edge? Am I a hamburger cretin? Maybe, but I think it's mostly that there's only so much you can do with a mass produced patty of ground beef.  Two stars.",

It was fun to go with Kevin because he is a local California guy but he is the first California person to actually teach me something knew about  In-N-Out.

I also think I might have taught Kevin something too...but he would not admit it.  He got his fries animal style and I got my fries well done.  We decided that it would have been amazing if we got them well done and animal style for the same order...I can not wait to try that.  The burgers were amazing but that is always a given...they work magic with there food.  Kevin also talked me into getting shakes too...so we had a feast...we also wore our In-N-Out paper hats and emailed photos to all of our friends/co-workers who were stuck in those boring expensive dinner meetings on the strip.

For a place that's so busy and always wishing out fries w each order, i expected a fresh batch. It came out soggy. Other than that it was good.  I also got the milkshake. For $2, it was one of he best I've had. I was so glad to have tried it.

I will give it to you guys - it's a good burger, but people seem to go insane for these things!! LOL. Fries are good too. An average fast food chain. Quick and dirty - more emphasis on the 'dirty'.  A note to the guy at the Drive-Thru Window: when you ask someone if they want ketchup, and, they reply 'no thank-you' - DO NOT stare at them blankly for 10 seconds like they're from another planet.  I guess you really like ketchup - don't you buddy - LMAO!!  If you've never tried, go for it, but, don't go too far out of your way. A hamburger is a hamburger......",

They greet you with a sweet, \"Hello, how are you doing today?\" Not, \"WOULD YOU LIKE TO TRY OUR NEW...\" to which I always respond, \"You know, I was thinking about it, but since you asked, no. I will never try your new....\"  So, anyway, first of all, they are so friendly. They always anticipate my needs. For example, I was asked if I wanted onion on the double-double I just ordered, and I said I was unsure because it was for a friend. He replied, \"That's okay, I'll just put it on the side for you.\"  So, friendliness ... oh, and they have never, EVER messed up my order. I always order my burgers with ketchup, mustard, pickles, and grilled onions, and that is always how I receive them. Oh, and we haven't even talked about the fries yet. In n Out fries are the bizzomb.  I very seldom get a hankerin' for a burger and fries, but when I do, this is where I go. I feel bad for all my friends in Chicago and Cinci, who have never experienced In n Out.",

Must have been daydreaming or had a blonde moment but usually In N out is on point 100% of the time. I waited about 20 minutes for my food and the place was practically dead. Cali In N Outs get the job done but Vegas man they need to regroup and weed out the slackers and hire people that are worth 11 an hour.

    "text": "The menu at In-N-Out Burger is as simple as it gets: you can order a hamburger, a cheeseburger or a double-double (double meat and cheese), which are served with or without fresh or grilled onions. Fries and soft drinks are also available, as are three varieties of shakes, but that's about it.  So what makes a visit to In-N-Out something many visitors to Vegas have to do? Aside from the fact they use natural, fresh ingredients, keep their restaurants very clean, and treat their employees very well, they've also created a mystique about themselves by limiting their stores to California, Arizona, Utah, and Nevada, and developing a cult-like following of carnivores in the process. While their burgers are superior to what you might find at the fast food outlets run by a shifty clown or creepy king, some describe their burgers and shakes as fast food bliss, and it's not uncommon for some guests to make it their first stop in Vegas from the airport while en route to their hotel.  Price is also a factor, as you can easily feed two for under $15, and for as little as $10 if you don't want to gorge yourself.  And then there's the whole \"secret menu\" thing. Walk up to the counter and ask for your burger \"animal style\" and receive extra pickles, extra spread (their secret sauce), grilled onions and mustard fried onto the patty. Or ask for a grilled cheese sandwich, or a protein-style burger (served without the bun), or opt for their 3x3s or 4x4s (three burgers and three slices of cheese, or four burgers and four slices of cheese). While a 44 is the maximum, some stores will allow their zealots to go a little crazy with orders for a 2020, and an infamous 100100 was once ordered right at thilocation here in Vegas.  Unfortunately, there's no In-N-Out Burger located strip side, so you will need a car to get to one. If you've rented a car, your best best is taking a quick, two-minute drive behind New York-New York on South Dean Martin Drive just off West Tropicana Avenue (route 593). Walking there is not advised. Don't do it.  If you don't have a car, taking a cab is always an option, but I would recommend heading to the location at 2900 West Sahara Avenue to avoid traffic and for getting the most bang for your buck. It's a $15 cab ride (each way) from the middle of the strip, but you can make the most of your trip by stopping into Palace Station, which is just down the street.   You can also save the cab fare and get to this In-N-Out location using public transportation. Just hop on the Strip and Downtown Express Bus heading north from one of its many strip-side stops, and transfer onto the 204 at Sahara and Santa Paula heading west. This trip will cost $5 (which will let you use the city's buses for two hours), or spring for the 24-hour pass that is a bargain at $7 and will give you enough time to explore downtown Vegas and the Fremont Street Experience, the World Market Center, and the Las Vegas Premium Outlets the next day, and meet a bunch of interesting characters on your travels. Just stay away from the shifty clowns.",

Yes, it is True this is the spot for cheap eats, but expect to wait your turn because there will be a line depending what time you go. We went around 5PM or so and it was busy.  I do like the fact you can observe your food being prepared and that they use real ice cream for the milk shakes. What's even better is the off the menu items and ordering terminology this place has. If you don't know what I'm talking about...you better ask somebody or keep reading the previous reviews.  Although Las Vegas is known for their extreme buffets, try and slip away for a moment for a juicy...but messy cheeseburger. It's worth every bite!",

If you mention In N Out to a casual, you get the same reaction as a middle aged housewife listening to Dave Matthews Band - endless fawning and drooling. The service is decent, but the order takers have no clue as to what's going on. The problem itself lies to the use of a \"secret menu.\" I don't refer to the tiny menu the restaurant has, but rather a set of secret code words to order your food to make it sound like you're \"cool\" and \"one of them.\" And they can't even get THAT right, as my \"mustard fried\" burger came out tasting the same like one of their normal burgers!  Let's talk about the burger itself. They are two ounce patties, and although the menu tops out at double-double, you can have four of these patties on your sandwich. But no bacon. Almost every other fast food restaurant allows bacon for an extra charge. But not at In N Out. They're special.  The standard burger (Yes, I'm calling it a burger here, deal with it fanboys) comes pre-dressed with lettuce, tomato, onion and this crap called \"Spread.\" Spread? What the #$!%@ is spread? Well it's a combination of ketchup, mayo and relish. I like these, but how hard is it to just mix it separately? Why make matters more complicated? You can customize your burger, but why not just do what Five Guys does? That being order the burger and then they ask what you want, and not assuming a set selection of toppings. Simplify.  The fries suck. Not sorry. They are cheap, but what you pay for is what you get. You get this tiny school lunch size carton with the tiniest, driest fries this side of McDonalds. They're not fries. They're fry-ettes. You can supposedly put this \"animal style\" sauce on the fries for no extra charge, but why should I have to guzzie up my food with something that looks like emesis?  They also serve Coca-Cola products, but they can't even get THAT right! Do you want Sprite? Tough break, you get 7-Up, instead. These people had 7-Up in their lineup for years and don't feel the need to switch, I guess.  Don't let the huge line fool you, folks. In N Out is overrated, overhyped and simply not worth it for the miniscule, medicore meal you get.  Oh, you're looking for a compliment? It's inexpensive. There.

They were busting their butts as a steady stream of people came through the door and drive-thru and not a single one of them looked like they were in a crappy mood.

I gave it three stars because I love fries, but theirs wasn't good. It was very stale tasting and the cheese tasted like kraft american cheese melted on the top. The burger was good, but the bun itself was the best thing of the burger lol. I had a strawberry shake, which was super thick so I had to wait like 10 minutes to drink it. The shake was filling on it's own haha. It was good though.   We tried the drive-thru which gives you a pretty cool experience to eat in the car because the food is given in like a readily prepared box with condiments, the food, napkins, etc. It was like a genuine old school experience. I'd definitely be back.  PS. I wrote it's not good for groups because it was often super packed that there were no seats available for groups larger than 4.",

I have been visiting here more lately as it is close to my place of employment and my buddy Sergio loves it for lunch!  The Amazing and always Super happy staff is ALWAYS a nice encounter. The food speaks for itself, fresh burgers with ultra fresh toppings with a unique bun and sauce.  They have a nice selection of drinks as well, I really like their pink lemonade and iced tea. They also make great handmade milkshakes as well which are a nice treat with a burger and fries.  I love their special sauce, I always ask for extra packets of it to dip my fries in if I don't order them animal style. I am not that crazy about the fries, sometimes they are so thin they are just too dry. If they would change their fry style I think that would be one of my dreams come True!  Mmmmm yummy good stuff!

It was crowded inside but the line moved fairly quick. Customer service was great, like it is at all of the other In-N-Outs I've been to.   What I love about In-N-Out is the simplicity of everything. They have such an easy and simple menu but it works perfectly. I got my usual Double-Double with fries and it didn't let me down. I finally tried their chocolate milkshake which was a bit disappointing. It wasn't bad but it wasn't great either.  Although it was busy and crowded, I was still a happy camper.

I waited at least 12 minutes in line i was so confident about my meal because the lady said it back to me in one breath i thought she was dedicated and could be trusted...but i have never been so wrong before in my life!! I got my meal and my lemonade everything looked phenomenal but it turns out i was played out my money and time. The way the prepared my meal made me feel like i could never show my face in public again. My fries tasted like they been sitting out for a week first of all. The bread on my burger tasted like they made it out of left over burnt crumbs from behind the stove. After i tasted this disgusting humiliating meal i needed to wash it down with my lemonade that i thought would brighten up my experience just a little bit but once again i have never been so wrong before in my life!!!! The first sip i took made me black out. I felt like i was assaulted and my first instinct was to call the police. This in n out needs to replace the whole staff and all the equipment because nobody should have to start off their new year the way i did. I feel so worthless and ashamed. Im writing this review to speak about my traumatic experience so that nobody else has to go through what i did. Just awful. Extremely disappointed.",

My burger though?Super tasty and bursting forth with molten-lava-esque melted cheese. I love it when cheese does that on a burger, and I have to say I was very pleased with my lunch choice. My shake was good, but on the runny side. I preferred CW's neapolitan shake to mine.

    "text": "Food is my biggest weakness. Sometimes I won't even be hungry but will be drawn to eating something because 1. I've never tried it before or 2. because I wont have the chance elsewhere and well this was the case for In-n-out last week in Vegas.  We had eaten breakfast at Egg and I that morning and I had stuffed my face with pancakes, bacon, and eggs so I was planning on a light dinner. I spent the rest of the morning driving around and buying foodie goodies at random places I had bookmarked (Popped and Bouchon Bakery) So there had been close to NO exercise being done.   When I got back to the hotel one of the first things my sister suggested we  do is go to in-n-out....She had just woken up from a 4 hour nap and she wants fast food? I was close to saying Sorry, no. But wait it's your 2nd to last day and you already decided your bringing Earls on the plane you won't have another chance said a devil voice in my head. Okay I said, let's go.  As we walked into In-N-Out  I was instantly transported back in time. The decor, the uniforms, the basic menu were all so 50's. I was a little surprised to see how simple the menu was but better for me, less decisions to make. Although I probably would have just stuck to fries at any other fast food place else my inner devil foodie demanded I try a burger so I went with the combo 1, a cheeseburger and fries.   My sister ordered before and got the infamous animal fries which I thought were only lathered with their special sauce...WRONG. They had melted cheese, the special sauce and grilled onions. Heartattack on the spot. :-)   Honestly I wish I had gone a little hungrier because although I was able to eat half my burger and 1/4 of the fries I didn't get to enjoy it as much as I may have after a night of drinking or on an empty stomach....Regardless, it was fresh fresh fresh for fast food and I was happy to see a guy making the fries from potatoes in the back..  I think next time I'll stick to an animal burger and regular fries..  I also have never seen such hard workers at a fast food joint, which definitely earns a star in my book!   YELP 365: 162/365",

I was too lazy/disorganized to study up on the secret menu, and not overly hungry, so I ended up with a chocolate milkshake and a regular cheeseburger sans onions and tomato.  Through a communication error, I also ended up with a vanilla shake which I gave to my sister, though she never got around to drinking it.  Total cost - just over $6, which was pretty dang good!  The chocolate milkshake was nothing impressive, and I'd skip that next time.  The burger was surprisingly good for a fast food joint - much better than McDonalds and even preferable to my usual choice of Wendy's (not that I eat fast food burgers that often).  Service was efficient, if uninspired, plus there was the minor snafu mentioned above but that's pretty tame by fast food joint standards.  Plenty of available parking.  I wouldn't go out of my way to get an In-N-Out burger, but I certainly wouldn't turn one down either.",

I rolled into Vegas on a Saturday afternoon, just to visit my favorite cheesy reality TV locations (Pawn Stars and American Restoration, if you must know).  I planned to stay on the Strip for one night, and spend the wages of sin alone and unsupervised in a neon blur of whiskey and poker chips.  But souvenir shopping accomplished, I realized I was not in the mood to stay in Sin City as a solo, squandering my earnings and tarnishing my spirit in a land of debauchery.  Sin is more fun with company.  Instead I headed towards Death Valley, a better match for my mood.  And there, on the outskirts of town, where the concrerte meets desert, it was.  In-N-Out.  And I was hungry.  I had heard the legends.  Tales of mysterious lingo and off-menu items known only to the initated, the In-N-Out Illuminati.  I spoke into the speaker words I had been taught to remember, but did not fully understand: \"Double double. Animal Style. Chocolate Shake.\"  And life changed.  Forever.  Can we build one of these in north Jersey, puh-leeeeeze?",

The beef is freshly ground and juicy, the vegetables are plentiful and crunchy.   The sauce is pure love...and the fries are hot, crispy and with the right amount of salt.

The fries tasted like they had been cooked in a dehydrator as they were a bit dry and the burger patty was so thin that I ended up with quite a bit of bun left as the meat was not only skinny, it didn't cover the full width of the bun.

I am absolutely thrilled to have one after all!!  Tonights visit was like a little bit of home :)  Drive thru line went very quickly, order taker friendly and repeated our order several times. I ordered the double double ketchup mustard only, and boyfriend got the double double animal style without lettuce. French fries were hot and crisp.   Food was perfect, good presentation but the only thing negative was we were not offered any ketchup nor was any placed in the box never the less they get a full 5 stars from me!!",

I asked the guy behind the counter what is the normal as I have heard of IN-N-Out but never ordered it and he said double double and some fries and shake.   I got all that and really couldn't have asked for much more in life.   The burger was perfect, the fries amazing and the shake perfect.  I like burgers, but a lot of times get all mad at people saying 5 guys is good.   This place is by far the best I've EVER had.   Period.  I think you should all go here immediately and try it out.

    "text": "In-N-Out is my FAVORITE fast food in the whole world!  Your meal is prepared by an army of employees in this 1950/60s themed establishment.  The meal portions are appropriate, leaving you satisfied without the gluttonous guilt of McD's, Carl's Jr, or Fatburger.  This particular In-N-Out is very busy since it is right off the Vegas strip.  The drive-thru queue runs 10+ cars at peak hours.  Dine-in orders usually take ~10 minutes.  All of your food is cooked fresh, from non-frozen ingredients.   My order: #2, animal style Includes: Single patty cheeseburger, french fries, medium fountain drink Total Price: $4.70 Taste: Delicious!  An animal style burger adds extra mustard, pickles, onions and extra thousand island spread.  The animal style request is part of In-N-Out's extensive secret menu.  Here is what you can get:  Burgers (1) animal style - see above (2) protein style - no bun, burger wrapped in lettuce (3) veggie sandwich - no meat, no cheese (4) spread - extra packets of the thousand island dressing (5) extra toast - bun is cooked longer (6) flying Dutchman - two patties, two slices of cheese (7) extra everything - extra spread, tomato, lettuce, onions (8) m by c - M meat patties and C slides of cheese (i.e. 3 by 3, 2 by 4) (9) double meat - two patties, no cheese (10) triple meat - three patties, no cheese  Drinks & Shakes (11) lemon up - 1/2 lemonade, 1/2 7-up (12) Arnold Palmer - 1/2 lemonade, 1/2 tea (13) root beer float - vanilla shake with root beer (14) Neapolitan shake - strawberry/vanilla/chocolate shake (15) choco-vanilla swirl shake - chocolate/vanilla shake  Other Sandwiches (16) grilled cheese - self explanatory  Fries (17) fries with cheese - adds two slices of melted cheese on top (18) fries well - cooked longer to be extra crisp (19) fries light - cooked in less time (20) animal style fries - fries with cheese, spread and onions",

    "text": "My first In-n-Out experience.  Was around midnight this past Saturday.  Drive-thru was pretty busy so I was very excited anticipating my de-virginization (is that a word?)!!  Anyway, since I had done my Yelp research I knew what I wanted to order:  Cheeseburger, Animal-style Fries and Dr. Pepper.  When I arrived at order box, the male voice asked me if I wanted ketchup or extra \"spread\"....  Well, honestly, I cannot understand why its \"all that\"!  Perhaps if its something you grew up eating, you connect the food to a memory?  And since I didn't grow up eating In-N-Out...no connection for me.  (Kinda how I feel about certain 80's bands - they may not be the best musically but I connect them to a time or place and it makes them better - at least in my own mind.)  Anyway - sorry for diverting here to music from food.    I mean, it was edible and not greasy but, well, not spectacular food.  the pickles on burger were pretty good.  The animal fries were ok, not like anything I'd had...have never put thousand island dressing on french fries before.  However, adding that to cheese and pan-fried/browned onions wasn't too bad.  I can see stopping for the animal fries again, after a few drinks....",

But it's one I'm willing to be a part of.  Even the Mormons or David Koresh doesn't have that kind of pull over me.  Definitely go with a Double-Double combo animal style.  If you really like the sauce and onions, you can animal style your fries too.  But that's a little bit too much of saturated fat for one lifetime.  However, this location is certainly busier than hell and picks up a lot of customers.  Steer clear during peak times if you can offset your appetite due to jetlag.",

The lines and hubbub about this place are well-deserved, and a lot of people just don't get it because, as another reviewer put it, it's just burgers and fries.  But it is in this simplicity that In-And-Out wins me over. The menu consists of only three combos, ordering is straightforward, the army of white outfits don't fuck about. I don't consider this a \"fast-food joint,\" as you never get your order under 15 minutes. But then again, you know the greasy slop has been lovingly hand-crafted and carefully fitted into the little paper sleeves Just For You. You don't get that kind of commitment with Mickey Sleaze and the Creepy King. And I'm all about commitment.   Unless, of course, it's cheat day and I slam two double doubles with extra fries. Sigh. They're also open late....but if you're hella starving you're better off hitting the other aforementioned spots.   Proper atherosclerosis takes time.",

It was everything I had ever dreamed of since I heard 2Pac rap about it back in the '90s, not to mention my partner in crime has gone on and on about them too. This finally came to fruition after walking about two miles and then also almost getting hit by a car (apparently crosswalks mean nothing in Vegas).  I had the double double, animal style, with fries, animal style and a lemonade. Absolutely amazing. The burgers were so much better than anticipated. I was so glad I finally got to try it. It sucks so hard there are none back here in Chicago. The animal style really adds a lot of flavor to an already very tasty burger. The wait was a bit long, though there were a ton of people in there. It has a very '50s atmosphere that brings a little bit extra awesome to eating at boring old fast food places. The fries were really good too. This was confirmed by my vegetarian that accompanied us. He also had the naked burger which is just like a grilled cheese with all the toppings on it. He said that was alright, but really enjoyed the fries. Nice and crispy, and hot too.  All in all this was everything I wanted. And it really makes me regret not living out west as we could have it all the time. Ugh, I want some nowwwww.",

This was due to the absolutely clueless cashier that we had, she couldn't get anything right from our double-double protein, animal style to the accuracy of the shakes we ordered, she couldn't even get TAKE-OUT right.  What an unpleasant experience at this location.  As busy as this place is you'd think that the manager would have qualified/competent cashiers manning the front instead they had one girl (unfortunately we got her) that must have been very new and wasn't aware of how to key in items and one who just walked away from her register for a good ten minutes allowing the lines to wrap around the restaurant.  Our order was so screwed up!!!!!!  Management Pay Attention to your Front Registers!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",

Are you really in the mood for a run of the mill buffet?  The answer should be a resounding no....you need something greasy and delicious and you need it as fast as humanly possible. In said situation In and Out burger will call to you like a beacon of greasy joy! There menu is simple burger or double burger, cheese or no cheese, and simple is good when you have a touch of the shakes.  The food is fast even though the line is out to the street you still get a decent response time. All in all its one of the best burgers for the price I have ever had! I highly recommend In and Out!",
