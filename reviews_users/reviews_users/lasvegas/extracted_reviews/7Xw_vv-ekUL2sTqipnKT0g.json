    "text": "We sat at the bar, which is nearly impossible to eat at due to the video poker, and had a terrible experience. The bar staff was inattentive, lazy and overall horrible service. We tried waving at the bartenders but they ignored it - one bartender was leaning against the inside bar eating a meal (which should never be allowed) - and when they were ready they would go to one customer and handle it. They seems unable or unwilling to multitask and were working at snail speed when they wanted. We ordered the hottest wings they have, and we couldn't get water or beer refills. When I did finally get a water refill he only filled it halfway!! They never checked on us and ignored us when we tried to catch their attention. The manager happen to walk to the bar while we were waiting (forever) to close out, and we talked him about it but he wasn't interested in hearing it nor remedying the situation - I think he's more concerned with being friends with the staff than running a business. Overall, by far the worst Buffalo Wings I've ever been to in the country.",

Anyway, here's what my friend and I had:  Southwest Dippers - These li'l things had a mighty tasty filling of pepper jack cheese, tomato, onion, jalapeno, corn and black beans. The ranch dip balanced the heat level nicely.  Traditional Spicy Garlic Wings - For some strange reason, the spicy part overpowered the garlic. I was only able to manage two of these. Yes, I'll admit I can be a weakling at times when it comes to spicy things, aite?!  Traditional Honey BBQ Wings - Although I have yet to try all of the other flavors, I think this one is the best. I'm more than likely to order this again the next time I come around here. Best believe there will be a next time.   We also ordered some Traditional Mild Wings to go for our friends back at the hotel. They even tried our leftovers and said that everything was good. BWW has earned itself some new fans!",

This used to be my go-to hangout...but I will never go back!!!! :( Last Sunday I went in during the first quarter of the Bears game. I sat at the bar and it took nearly 15 minutes for a bartender to acknowledge me, even tho they were only about 1/2 full. I am a pretty big gamer, and needed my players card. Ten minutes after the girl bartender (never got either of the bartenders names, they barely acknowledged me let alone introduce themselves,) took my ID I asked what the hold up was, she told me she could not find my card and had to print a new one. This is now 25 minutes into sitting here, nothing in front of me and not gaming either. I finally got my card and started to play. Guy bartender brought me the bottle of water I asked him for and took my order. It was the end of the halftime, beginning of THIRD quarter before I got my food. By now I had gambled quite a bit, I had the empty bottle of water on the ledge and no one replaced it. I had to flag down a bartender to get another. When I was done, I went to front and asked for a manager. When AGM came up I explained how ignored I had been. She never even asked for my name, and didn't seem to care that I had lost a great deal of money (which was not her problem, but a gamer should be treated with the utmost respect) and had terrible service. She gave me the GM's card and walked away. I called the next day and left a message with whomever answered phone. I never got a call back.  I will never go back, and at one point in the last year or two, I was one of this establishments biggest gamers and better customers. *shakes my head in disgust.*",

    "text": "This is my favorite chain restaurant of all time.  This particular BWW just opened up in the area known as the South Strip.  It's on Las Vegas Boulevard, about 4 or 5 miles south of Mandalay Bay, in the same mega-shopping complex as a woefully outdated outlet mall.  The reason to come to BWW is (of course) the chicken wings.  I almost always get the boneless teriyaki, but you can get traditional wings too in more than a dozen different types of sauces, ranging from mild to dangerous.  BWW is more than just wings.  It has an unbelievable menu.  You can get a typical burger, pulled pork or grilled chicken sandwich.  There's also an awesome selection of appetizers.  Cheeseburger dippers, mini quesadillas, and my personal favorite mini corn dogs (with honey bbq sauce) are just some of the highlights.  Maybe my only gripe is that BWW does not serve traditional fries.  The only option are these things called Buffalo Chips, which are round fries about the size of nickels.  And of course, there's a good selection of beer.  BWW is the ultimate place to get together with friends, watch the game and gorge yourself on food.  This location in particular has tv's everywhere, ranging from massive to small, many of them high-def.  To top it off it has the trivia game to pass the time between games and waiting for your food.  The restaurant is split up, with the main dining area in front.  A huge wall separates it from the bar area in the back, where people can smoke.  I can't recommend BWW strong enough to have a good time.  The location near the Galleria Mall in Henderson is also very fun.",

As the time approached 5:00 there were at least 50 people in line and no one going in.  Several people kept going in to ask when we would be going in, and each one got a different answer. The event started @ 5:00 and at 5:15 many of us were still outside and very irritated. There were a few people who got tired of the wait and left. One person went in just before 5:30 to get an update and witnessed the Manager giving a \"pep talk\" which was more like a chewing out of employees. The mgr did in no way seem to be professional and seemed to not care that there was line of people outside all waiting to see an event that had already started. When people finally started going in at approximately 5:30 the Mgr at one point stopped and said \"in the last 10 minutes I have let in approximately 25 people, we have to stop or we're going to kill our kitchen\" She at no point explained to the people waiting what the hold up was, or even apologize for the delay. The food was ok, nothing to brag about. The chips & salsa were bland, definitely wouldn't order that again. We were seated at a corner table, and as the building became full and obviously no one else could fit, they let all the remaining people stand in the lobby. From our view a few of the standing people were blocking views of the tv's.  We even at some point asked them to move over so we could see, and after multiple requests we had to call our server to help us with this. Bottom line of this was they were more concerned with serving those standing people beverages then the customers sitting at tables. One of the worst showings of customer service and me and the group I was with will never go there again.",

It was august 6 and it was a friends 21st birthday and he just turned 21 so a couple other friends and I decided to stop by after clubbing to get a late night snack. We were the largest table there with 8 people but It took 20 mins to get someone to ask for our drinks. It was 3 in the morning and we understand that there's probably only one server and cook. But there was only 3 other tables other than us. I don't know if it was because we were the youngest group or if it was because we were the only ones not white but it took over an hour to get our food. No one came to let us know what was going on. When we finally got our food we were already sober from the drinks from the club and the cook kept insisting that it didn't take an hour for the food to come out. The people who came after us got their food first!!! Two whole tables! We didn't want the food anymore we were so angry. By the time we walked out the sun was coming out already.  The server obviously forgot to put our orders in but admit to it! Don't tell us after that another coworker called in and try to give us 10% off our bill. The entire time we were waiting he never came by to ask us how we were doing but he was talking to people at the bar and the other tables. Just standing there. I felt discriminated. I will never set foot in a Buffalo Wild Wings again ever. It just left a bitter taste in my mouth from this atrocious experience. I have not had a restaurant completely ignore me or my friends because we weren't white. Disgusted.",

Then as we sat down in the only clean area he goes to guests on the other side to chit chat not bothering to clean. Husband came back from restroom which was a mess as messy as bar area. As bartender came to help and start cleaning we decided on leaving from a messy area to a salty area. As much as I wanted BWW I was very disappointed to have to leave. Maybe it was a bad night.

    "text": "This was my first time at this Buffalo Wild Wings location and I am never going back. The service was the worst I have ever experienced at any restaurant. When I asked the server about an explanation about the happy hour menu, she told me to look at the menu myself and waited there impatiently until I ordered. I asked if I could get half and half flavors for my wings, and she said yes so I ordered two different flavors - the lemon pepper and mango habernero, and my husband ordered two flavors too for his medium sized order of wings. We ended up getting four full orders of chicken wings! My husband and I could not finish 60 chicken wings between the two of us, but we felt bad because it was prepared already. Another server noticed we did not want it and agreed to take the chicken wings and come back with what we originally had ordered. My husband and I snacked on the appetizer for half an hour until a different server finally served us the food again. Again, they messed up our order and gave us two entirely different flavors that we did not order. We didn't want to complain again because if we were to do so, we were scared they might do something to our food because of how much we complained thus far. At this point, I didn't even want to eat and I just wanted to pay and go home. Our original sever finally comes back after an hour and asks us what's wrong in a rude tone, and I was so close to walking out. This was my first time complaining about shit service because they first over charged me, then attempted to make up for it by giving me the wrong orders??? I still tipped and payed, but this place is not worth anyone's money.",

We were about to be seated in 10 mins for a party of 7 which wasn't bad considering they were pretty busy.  At the time only 4 out of 7 ppl from our party had arrived so we decided to go ahead and place our orders.  This is when it began going down hill...  It took them 45 minutes to bring out wings for the 4 of us, during the entire time we never saw our server.  What bothered me the most was the fact that when our wings did came out they were pretty dry and they didn't even bring us the right or enough condiments. My cousin and I asked for blue cheese and all we got were 3 ranches for the 4 of us.  Luckily as our wings were delivered our server came back and we were able to place the order for the remaining 3 people in our party, which thankfully were delivered in 15mins with no problem at all.  Overall, I've been to this specific location many times before and they're always pretty good about their wings and pretty timely too. However, they did not deliver at all today especially on Christmas Day... which really disappointed.  To put into perspective how long we waited... we arrived during the 1st half of the Lakers Game and finally got our check during the end of the 4th quarter...",

When speaking to the manager i said i dont KNOW if this is busy but this is horrible service & manager said no this isnt busy but we have 3 new cooks... My thought is the food tasted good still like bww always does but the service all around sucked!!! Sure the manager took it upon himself to get food out faster & served it himself... But he could have comp the cold appetizers... Basically saying HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE",

But sadly, walked in tonight about 8:45 with my brother. PLACE IS PACKED, we luckily got our food pretty quickly. My wings were almost cold, jusy slightly warm.. but it got to us quickly and we were hungry so we weren't upset.  BUT our server, couldn't have been more rude. Got our waters & never came back after she took our food order. A food runner delivered our food & we're waiting a good 5 mins but finally I MYSELF needed to stand back up to find someone cause we didn't get extra boats or napkins, (or anything in that matter because we never received a check in from our server to make sure everything was okay) soon after she has no problem dropping the check off, passing by repeatedly. Staring at us to see if we were ready to pay, finally snatches the check off the table while passing by. Returns it.. and let me tell you that we get it, it's busy but if you had NO TIME to even check on us throughout the entire meal, Jackie don't be so quick to take the signed copy from under my hand before I leave, anticipating your signed bill.  That was by far the RUDEST, and WORST guest service experience I have ever gotten.   Will not be returning to this location,  You can have the best food at even a FIVE star restaurant but if your guest service is horrible you won't have returning customers!",

Also the food is usually good, however I had tried their grilled chicken sandwich and did not really care for that. Fries are always good though. We did go on wing Thursday so my friends got 3 orders of 5 different flavored wings. Got to love that. I still have not found a sauce to my liking, but I will try again soon maybe.   The waitress was really nice at this one. She really got involved with us in a conversation about random things and it was pretty cool. She remembered the RANCH! Yes!   Also my Peach Tea (alcoholic) was amazing. I shall be back to this one in the future only because its the closet one. I mean usually all BWW's are the same, but this was my first trip to one in Vegas and it was really the same as always. They have good drinks, wings, and fries, everything else not so great.",

Yes, our very own My T (you should know him) conquered the Blazin' Wing challenge (12 insanely spicy wings in 6 minutes) and lived to tell about it. It was like being ringside with Pacquiao. At this location, they gave him a free shirt and he did not have to pay for the wings. (Rumors at other locations, you win the right to BUY the shirt, which would have been lame.)  We went on .45 wing Tuesdays. It's hard to complain about a .45 wing. They have a wide selection of flavors (Garlic Parmesean to Mango Habanero), and the variety somewhat makes up for the skimpy wings. They aren't quality wings, but when drenched with a creative sauce and served for .45, they do okay.   The fried garlic mushrooms are some great guilty bar food for $3 during happy hour. I could have finished off a couple of baskets.  It was crowded, and the service wasn't spectacular. I think our waitress might have been having a bad day. Overall, it's a BWW, and this location probably isn't one of the better ones. But, if you're close by and craving a wing and a big screen to watch some sports, you'll survive.",

No napkins or \"dishes\" brought with app. Management standing with hands in pockets WITH staff who seemed in no hurry. Server didn't even deliver food, and girl who did brought 1 table setting for 3 people. Luke warm chicken, and such little sauce, I may as well have gone to McDonald's and gotten McNuggets. Upon approaching management, seemed it was not an uncommon complaint. If they were swamped, I'd get it. Worst BW3 experience to date. The coworkers I begged to join me will not have a good taste in their mouth about this corporation.",

Went straight to the bar because it was empty and I wanted to watch ESPN. However I did more of watching tv than anything else. After sitting for about 8 minutes me and my girlfriend received zero attention from the bartender. We sat for the first few minutes and waited because I saw that he was counting cash, me being a bartender as well I thought he's counting his bank cool. However I usually look around HE DID NOT, not even give me a \" Hey I'll be right with you.\" So after he finished he then walked over to a lady who had literally just sat right in front on him. He asked her if she wanted anything she said no. He then walked over poured himself a soda and looked Directly At ME !!! Still nothing. I'm pretty patient, however when you continue to get ignored and don't even get a \" Hey I'm sorry, what can I get you.\" I've walked out before from this place but heard that they had redone the inside and tried to get more of the locals back. Yea it actually looked really cool inside now, but the bartender on this shift May 29 to be exact was horrible.",

The was a 40 minutes wait so we sat in the bar area for faster service. We just wanted something simple our first night so we ordered two salads, fish tacos and a chicken wrap with onion rings. Simple order right?  Wrong our waitress Amanda needs to be retrained because she service was horrible from the moment we sat down. It took us 50 minutes to get our food. The salads lacked dressing and the onion rings were lukewarm. We asked for extra dressing and that took her over 10 minutes. Really? It was the worst meal ever. Then we wanted the check and had to wait till she was done talking to friends of hers at a table near us for over 10 minutes then she started talking on the phone. When I finally was so annoyed I walked to bar to ask the bartender to print our bill she shows up with her normal I'm stuck on stupid look. This was the first time I have ever reduced a tip because I was so darn pissed off with the service received. She attempted to apologize as I was leaving her a horrible tip and I stop her in mid BS sentence by telling her I was not trying to hear her excuses for her horrible service.",

We we there over two hours and only got drinks refilled twice.   After 40 minutes when we got our food, one dish was missing, which they had to go back and make because there \"was a mixup\". The manager came over and apologized the last dish wasn't with the rest of the food, and said she would \"go yell at the kitchen\". She made no mention of our food taking 40 minutes after the waiter had said food would be out in 10-12mins.   I like BWW but will not return to this location anytime soon. Most of the food was cold by the time it came out, and the only positive is the dishes that were hot, tasted good.",

After waiting 10 minutes for a fork, I asked my wonderful waitress, Vicky, for a fork. Turns out it was right behind me. She got it for me with a smile on her face.

While waiting, we couldn't help but notice the 'Lighter Side' of the bar having full/persistent service.

    "text": "If there's one food that is insanely overpriced, it's chicken wings. Costco charges $9 for a huge, couple pound bag of raw, frozen wings that you can put any sauce, breading, seasoning, what have you on it. This place... $8.99 for 12 wings - not even big wings!  So I heard about the spicy wing challenge and wanted to give it a try. 12 wings, in their spiciest sauce, in 6 minutes. When my friend Gracie C. told me that Jerry J. and I were going to meet her and her husband there for dinner last night (7/27/11), I knew I was going to try the challenge.   I ordered a glass of milk so that my stomach wouldn't cramp after eating the wings. Everybody ordered chicken fingers, and we got a $3 basket of mozzarella sticks and a $3 basket of garlic mushrooms. I said I wanted to do the challenge and the waitress told me that they no longer do the picture taking thing if you win, but you have a chance to buy a shirt if you do... cheap!  The (assistant?) manager brought out the food and asked if I was ready. He set my food down... and walked away. What? Nobody to time me?  If that was how it was going to be, I want my dipping sauce and celery, dang it.   My friends seemed disappointed, so Jerry timed me. Unfortunately, I was about to bite into it when Jerry said, \"in 15 seconds, start.\" Dang! At first, I thought, \"oh, okay, this is going to be a cakewalk.\" That is, until the sauce on my tongue started to heat up fast before he said \"Go!\" I was able to eat 10/12 in 6 minutes. If it wasn't for that premature tasting, I could have easily finished on time. The wings are hot, but don't taste like much. Make sure to keep the sauce off of your lips and the roof of your mouth. I have a few baby blisters on the roof of my mouth and I'm not too happy about  it. The wings were hot for the sake of being hot, but there was no real spice flavor to them. :( Soyo's spicy chicken is hotter but less blistering because you can eat it while drinking.   I snuck off to go pay Jerry's + My tab...  -12 wings $8.99 - 6 chicken strips $9.29 - side of wedge fries with cheese $.99 - and bacon $.50 - side of fried mushrooms  $3.00 - 2 glasses of milk $4.38 (???!!!) - 2 Michelobs $6.00 - a glass of water, tax and a $5 tip  Came to... $40.86!   That's stupidly overpriced. I don't like that the waitress asked if I wanted more milk but didn't tell me there were no free refills, especially because milk wasn't on the menu where I could look it up myself. I also didn't like that she didn't give me any more water refills after I paid, even though I paid fairly early as the other people were all still eating.   I will stick to cooking wings at home for pennies on the dollar. The fact that it's not dark as a cave, like where we were seated, is also a plus. Did I have a good time? Yes, but that was because I was with my friends, not because we were at BWW. The restaurant experience was just \"meh.\"",

If you've been to Bdubs before it's pretty standard fair, lots of tvs and wings and other fried foods.  The only real difference is this one is open 24 hours, which is nice.    Not surprisingly if you are going here for a big sporting event it will be very busy, especially if it is a UFC fight.  You will probably have to get there an hour or more early and/or tip someone heavily to get a seat.  Best things are the mini corn dogs and wings.  If you order just those you will have a very pleasant meal.  Sauces depend on your taste and spice tolerance but I normally go with Spicy Garlic and Asian Zing.  My two British friends routinely spend 100 dollars between them, so I'm pretty sure if anyone ever decided to open one of these in London it would be like printing money.",

Her response \"umm we are like really busy right now..\" I wonder if this was her first night working because it was not busy and there were at least 2 booths available 1 was dirty and there was an empty one where an EMPLOYEE was using it to charge her phone. Just saying I know what busy looks like.. busy is usually a football game or some sport event happening. Anyways she said we'd have to wait which we told her we didnt mind in the first place. We get seated. Everything comes like 30 mins later. Cold fries. We ordered an appetizer which we received with the food? Usually that comes out first.

We waved him down to ask for more ranch and he told us it's .60 cents extra each one, fine whatever not a big deal, I've never been charged for extra ranch before, we usually get the large traditional and it usually comes with 4 ranch, this time only 2. After that he then again NEVER check on us! Not for refills or anything! He walked right past our table several times. We even had to ask someone else to bring us the bill because we were waiting for him for so long.

    "text": "Followup to my previous (not very detailed) review.  Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me. Fool me a 3rd time and...quit fooling me damn it!  I always enjoy my Spicy Garlic Wings. After my December visit I made the mistake of returning to this location in January. When my wings arrived they were clearly old (not fresh) and looked terrible sitting on the server's tray next to someone else's hot fresh wings. I pointed this out to the server and she replied the wings are \"always fresh\" which proved two things. 1st, she doesn't understand how the kitchen at BWW functions, and 2. She's blind. I asked her if it was her order would she accept it...her response was she doesn't like Chicken.  I then asked for a manager who proceeded to tell me the wings looked fine but she'll bring new ones...they look fine, really? I'll pass....and we left. Strike Two.  After two strikes I suppose I'm a glutton for punishment. I returned in Feb. for a third visit and I thought for sure the third time was a charm. The bartender was friendly and my wings arrived quickly. The wings themselves were a bit dry but I've lowered my standards and I was hungry! My second bite into the second wing I found a hair in my mouth. It wasn't my hair...DAMN! COMPLETELY DISGUSTING.  The bartender was very apologetic and took the food away quickly. She then informed the manager of the situation. This was a very heavy hispanic gentleman who came around the bar, leaned over next to me and said, \"so what happened?\"  You're kidding right...what happened? Didn't the bartender just tell you? Where's my apology? Where's your concern? What happened? REALLY?  On my way out I wrote down the name of the General Manager on the door and proceeded to call the listed number which of course was simply the direct line to the restaurant. The person who answered the phone didn't recognize the name I was asking for (HER BOSS) and after placing me on hold to check with someone else came back to advise me the GM is not there, comes and goes without warning and there is no way to contact her unless I leave a message. I chose to leave the message here instead. I still love BWW but will NEVER, EVER VISIT THIS LOCATION AGAIN.",

We were upset and called to let them know, the guy working said he would relay the message to a manager and have them call us for a comp'd meal. He said they would call me the next day, days went by with no call. So we decided one late night to go in (which was a mistake). We thought maybe if we explained what happened we would get a comp that we were promised. We waited in the front nobody told us to seat ourselves we literally waited like 5/10 min and finally sat at the bar where we waited another ten min and no one ever came out. So I decided to call the next day and speak to a manager. I explained both of the situations to him. He was very intrusive asking who was working what day etc etc which ok I guess I understand he has to get more info but he wasn't even apologetic at all. He was rude! And he did not want to give us a comp. He could've atleast given us a 30% off something if he couldn't a comp. Such a shame that they have horrible customer service when it's so close to my house.",

I was on hold the whole time while driving there and eventually just had to order when I got there because the lady still didn't pick up the phone when she left me on hold.  I can understand you're busy, but what really ticks me off is that there are other servers and other employees just moseying around while this poor girl up front is hustling and working her butt off without any help. Management needs to fix this.",

Then when ordering a kids meal they wanted to know ages and said they wouldn't give us the kids meal which was fine I was over it so I just said give me a snack size order, I guess then she went to her manager and they agreed to give me the kids meal but would charge me for the soda, whatever I'm hungry now and over this ordering issue. When the food came out it was wrong, of course it was why wouldn't it be any different? My husband decided just to eat what came out instead of arguing with them. I am just in disbelief that they were more worried about us ordering the kids meal than the girl throwing up all over the women's restroom making a mess, and Her boyfriend trying to get her out of the restroom. Thank God the food was great but I will never step foot into this Buffalo wild wings again.",

    "text": "I've gone here a couple times already. This is actually the only Buffalo Wild Wings I've ever been to so I don't have much to compare it to. Both times that I've gone, I ordered the Traditional Wing Combo with Honey BBQ sauce; Very savory, tangy, and sweet with a mild kick. The combo comes with your choice of sauce, coleslaw, and french fries. The fries are mediocre, kind of on the soggy side and the coleslaw is sub par. Now that I think of it, I should really just stick to the wings and not get the combo at all because the celery and dipping sauce is just enough. The service was pretty slow both times I've gone even though it was before noon, so I can't imagine how they deal with the later crowds of people (especially on Wing Tuesdays).   All in all, this is a decent place to eat if you're in the plaza and don't want to pay for expensive mall food. They have specials on different days and happy hour as well. They even have free wifi, which is always a plus.   Tips: -Wing Tuesdays = 45 cent wings -Boneless Thursdays = 60 cent boneless wings -Celery, carrots, ranch, and bleu cheese are not included on Wing Tuesdays and Boneless Thursdays -Free Wifi -Happy Hour 5-7pm (not completely sure)",

    "text": "First time here at Bdubs, thought it would be pleasant but turned out to be the opposite. The seat are that they placed us was too crowded for a party of 4 while the party of 2 got placed in a more opened area. The server kept trying to rush our order and looked confused each time he came around our table. We got the sampler appetizer, which was pretty decent but we didn't receive any silver ware or plate, so we only had napkins and the table got really messy.   My friend and I decided to get the same thing, the Honey Buffalo Chicken Ranch Salad. We were super excited for it. When it came out and we started eating it, the chicken was ice cold! Kind of like when you take a few frozen veg, stick it in the microwave for like 1 minute and it's still icy. Yeah, I know it's a salad but this was the first time I have ever had a chicken salad at a restaurant with icy cold chicken, besides getting a chicken salad (with mayo) on bread.   I was looking forward to some hot honey BBQ chicken on a bed of lettuce with cheese and tomatoes...I asked the server if this was how the chicken was supposed to be and  why (basically stating my displeasure). He told me that they cook the chicken fresh and chill it down every morning  and that most people complain having a hot fresh grill chicken on their salad. I don't know about you Mr. but the chicken looked like that resealable Tyson grilled chicken cubed and tasted like it was stuck behind the pantry freezer. Totally wouldn't come back here for a long time.  Sincerely,  Cintya P.",

We ordered 2 baskets of potato wedges with queso, he brought us the side that comes with the happy hour special. With little to no queso on them. We let him know that they are wrong. We wanted to big sizes to share? And he says he's trying to help us out?! What the heck ? How? That's not what we ordered . My mother in law ordered jalapenos and they never met came to her for her food. By now the pickle and the jalapenos are not here. He forgot about the pickle and he said the jalapenos would be out soon. Why would I even need them at this point when we already finished the food and my drink??? I'm furious at this point.

The waitress started out ok, but when half of our group asked her to come back for their order in 10 minutes, she just didn't.  We would flag her down to order something, she would take that order and run off without even checking if any of the rest of us needed anything.  (Before any of us could ask for anything either!). Two of the members in our party wanted to play the trivia game.  Unfortunately, there was a problem with the system where they could connect.  (Not a huge deal, not upset about it not working). We were able to get the manager to check, and he promptly reset it, but never came back to check if it was fixed!  (It wasn't.) The food we got was still yummy, but would give 0 stars for the service.",

What waiter doesn't take our order?! And they are out of a ton of things so it is a very limited menu. And then when we were ordering the waitress didn't know any of the items and the items they were out of they wouldn't substitute. They should've have been shut down because they are out of over ten sauces, and then they are out of bread and buns. So no sauces for wings and no buns for burgers or sandwiches.

My son was sick and kept telling her he didnt want anything to drink and she was like \"are you sure?\" then started naming all kinds of drinks. He of course said no and then finally agreed to try some cranberry juice. It arrived from the bar in a cocktail glass, which was dirty, and he tried it and said no. So she pressed on... he finally agreed to chocolate milk, which I didnt want him to have since he had strep but whatever he didnt have but 1 drink.  We ordered boneless wings, I ordered my fave mango habanero, honey bbq, and Caribbean jerk. My son ordered mac and cheese, but again he didnt eat it! My wings came out and I was not impressed at all! The wings tasted funny and the sauces were like thick and yucky. The breading on the wings was all wrong, idk what was up with them that day but I seriously couldnt eat them. My honey bbq was nasty as was the carribean jerk, so I asked for more mango habanero  and she brought me out bone in ones... ahh! I was like in my tiny voice \"I'm sorry, but I wanted boneless ones : (\" she looked at me and was like well do you just want these instead? No miss lady, I want boneless, pwease! It doesnt matter these tasted like shat as well!  Our waitress was super crummy, she kept talking to this one table and wouldnt come and get us water or anything. Not until the very end when we were all irritated and ready to go she asked if we needed any water or refills on wings. Ugh! Oh well, I'm nice and tipped her because thats how I roll!

The delivery service offered to refund me within 3-5 business days. I called Buffalo Wild Wings to see if they were able to make it right and provide me with the correct food and was told (after waiting to speak with a manager) that they would not help me because the other party had agreed to help - even though the issue occurred at the restaurant. Literally 9 dollars worth of chicken tenders and the customer service is so awful that they couldn't make their mistake right. I won't be dining at this restaurant again and I'll make sure the company I work for finds better places to order lunch from in the future.",

Bartender came back finally to ask if i wanted another beer. I wasnt in the mood at that point so i asked for water. He gave me the water and as i thanked him i had the opportunity to thank his back. That was awesome. The food wasnt bad but the service was horrendous enough to warrant negative stars if i was able to.  It is called the service industry for a reason.

    "text": "This is the BWW location that I visit the most often. It's pretty convenient for me and my coworkers to visit after work, considering we work on the strip.   This location stays fairly busy, especially during special sporting events. Currently, their traditional Tuesday's and boneless Thursday's have their wings priced at 70 cents each. My coworkers and I typically come during one of two days and it is busy then too. We usually go in big groups, so we have to at least wait for 15 minutes, but typically we wait for a good 30 minutes. One good thing is that they don't require your entire party to be there to be sat, so if you have one person that can go ahead in your party to reserve your seats, I would recommend that.   A downside for it being consistently busy is that the servers have a lot to handle, and can sometimes take a while to take your order, or to come back and check up on you. That's a problem I consistently came across, but once you see what it looks like, you can't really blame them, but the problem is still there. The food is just as delicious here as any other BWW location so if you are craving their wings or cheesecake bites, it's just as great of a restaurant!",

Also, THIS IS THE ONLY BAR I'VE VISITED IN LAS VEGAS THAT CHARGES YOU FOR DRINKS WHILE YOU ARE GAMBLING.  This information is not posted anywhere, nor do the bartenders make you aware of it when you are playing.  The manager is a sniveling little toad of a man who cares nothing for his customers, only for profit.  When we complained about not being informed of this policy and about the fact that our food order was once again wrong, he added insult to injury by only removing $2 from our tab.  I have been to BWWs in multiple states and this is by far the WORST one I have ever visited.  There are many other BWW locations in Las Vegas that will treat you well.  Try the Galleria or Horizon Ridge locations and AVOID THIS ONE if you don't want them to ruin your evening and your appetite.",

Especially the women handling the take out area. I didn't even order take out and only spoke to them for a few seconds. But they were very rude and impatient when we were confused on where to go for the hostess. You're standing right in front of the door, you could've let us know we were speaking to the wrong associates in a less than an annoyed way.   Based off other reviews, I highly recommend management at this location to retrain your employees. I wouldn't recommend this location to anyone because of their lack of customer service.",

And if u are like me that isn't a huge sports buff no sweat they got lots food, lots of beer, and lots atmosphere to be around. So the food is pretty awsome obviously their things g are wings, they have tons of wings sauces and dry rubs to pick from all categorized from non spicy to spit ur mouth out, and lots of sodas and non carbonated drinks along with beer mixed drinks and a couple things they can mix for u if u need them to. One thing I would say it be nice to see some X-game sports on there maybe on a couple of screens not everyone is into the main sports, a lot of people that skateboarded, biked, surfed, etc. Also the reason they are not a 5 star place for me is that the consistency of their service has not been as great as I would expect, a lot of times associates get caught up talking to themselves and then u see customers getting up to look for associates, no good. But like I said that doesn't apply to everyone I have had visits that are fantastic and can't judge the whole establishment on a couple of bad experiences. Check it out ull have a good time",

I had to get up 3 different times because she constantly kept walking by us like we were not there. We are locals and eat once a week at the Buffalo Wild wings in centennial and I can tell you the servers in centennial are by far better than this buffalo wild wings ON THE STRIP! that's what blows my mind she was very rude, unattentive, took her 25 mimutes to bring me my 3rd beer like wow. I understand being busy but that's inexcusable. I ordered a shot of Jamerson before we left and it took her 10 minutes to bring me a shot she told me she was waiting for the other guy to pour it? Why you work at the bar and we're at the bar so why could you pour the other 3 shots we ordered and not this one, that a right because you were too busy putting cups away. I understand they have other things to do but the customer should be first and things like that should be done on down time. I expressed to her my husband knocked my coke.ober so again I had to get up and find her on the side of the bar to tell her and she brought the shot and a new coke with a wet yellow sign. She picked up the check and our total was $98 she was awful service I told my husband do not leave her a tip after I saw another couple next <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fto.us&s=2d3e27dfa6f25c7293e1459e4305ef7a5e2a30b5098a92bddc3073a35d549375\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">to.us</a> arguing over THE SAME EXACT THING. He insisted he has to leave at least 3 dollars so she took the receipt and said oh wow yes ha thanks for the whole 3 dollars. I looked at my husband and we ended up talking to the other couple outside and they expressed to me and my husband how terrible she was to them as well. So they told us to yelp and I said most definitely. I get that bad days happen but this server was terrible and we will never return because of her.",

    "text": "4 of us came into buffalo wild wings for drinks and wings. We love BWW and thought we would try this location as we were in the area.I just want to make it known that we are all servers and probably the easiest guest to please.We wanted to sit in the bar area and the first impression we got of the staff was so awkward. The \"manager\" said we didn't even look 18 jokingly. We're 28? We're short? OK whatever. We ordered 4 beers and it took kind of a long time for how slow the place was. Like 10 min. Ok No biggie. We never got any waters refilled the whole time there but thats ok. When we ordered the 24 piece wing basket the wings came out and looked different than they usually do compared to the other locations we go to. We eat 1 and they're cold. They're kind of dry and the others are over seasoned and salty as well. We tried one wing from each flavor in the basket thinking maybe the other ones will be better even if they're cold. They aren't:( We all debated whether or not to say anything bc it would be so awkward and didn't want to make a big deal about it. We all had never taken anything back before. We finally just decided that if we didn't like it we should just be honest about it and maybe it was just one of those things that could be switched out. We'll the server didn't check back with us after the food was dropped for over 15 minutes so it took awhile for us to let them know about the food. So we awkwardly sat there patiently waiting for our server hoping it wouldn't be a big deal. We were wrong. This is why this location has 1 star from us. Not because the drinks took 10 min, not because the food was cold and salty, not because the staff was unattentive. The reason was instead of just saying,\"oh, I'm sorry. Let me take these right now and get you something else.\" We know these things happen! We do it everyday at work!This is what happened. She said, \"Oh, well why don't you like them?\" We tell her. \"Well ill get you a different 24 piece to go.\" To go? We say that's ok we just want to head out. She immediately leaves and talks to the manager and the manager says well.. ill see what I can do. Ok at any restaurant we have all worked at they apologize and get you something you do want. We were extremely polite? This should have been no big deal. The server comes back, doesn't say anything to us and just puts the receipt paper on the paper and walks off upset. We were as polite as we could be I'm not sure why she was upset? We were still going to tip you!!!! We get out the cash($40) for a $31 tab and she asks us,\"so you want change?\" Uh yes please? Are servers allowed to ask if that's their tip or if we need change, how awkward. She gives us the change minus the 70 cents which was missing for some reason and walks off. We decided that this was going to be the first time ever that, we were not going to leave a tip. We're servers! Why didn't u at least try and be nice about everything? We just didn't like it and we were polite about it. What is the big deal?! At least try and make our experience with YOU good?  It doesn't stop there. We were getting in the car and we're about to pull out and the server is walking towards the car. We immediately know she's pissed about us not leaving her \"well deserved tip\". So we roll down the window. One of us left our cell phone at the table... she was coming out to bring it to us. Thats really nice she did that! But...This is what she says,\"even though you didn't tip, I did the right thing to get u your phone\"... what is going on at this location? What does that mean? Right thing by not keeping it or throwing it away?! Are we in the Twilight zone? Girl, we do this job everyday and know when things go wrong it's no big deal. Just be nice about it and fix the problem. We knew it wasn't your fault about the food. You being extremely rude to us and avoiding us because we didn't like the food?that is crazy. Do you know how many times we've done everything right and food was great but people decided to jip us and we wanted to ask them why?! But u dont do that because its unprofessional.  You were horrible! How could you think that being rude because we didn't like the food was ever ok? How did you think that everything you did was just so impeccable tonight that you had no idea why we wouldn't tip? We always tip servers 20%, we get it you get behind sometimes and it's not your fault. But do what we do and do some quality control and just be nice! That's it. Ok rant over. Don't waste your time here. And if you do, don't complain or the servers will awkwardly follow u out in the parking lot. What an awkward experience.",

    "text": "Love Buffalo Wild Wings but the service can be better. I went in with my boyfriend to watch a NBA finals game, got there mid 2nd quarter and we wanted to catch the second half as well. So we started with our appetizer and told the waitress that we will order later on, she even asked if we were going to watch the game, which we responded yes. So she comes back during halftime and asks if we are ready to order, I say not yet, in a bit. So right before the game comes back on she brings the check... My boyfriend and I were a bit confused.. Like she knew we were going to order but she brought the check anyways. I was like \"wow they are kicking us out\" lol. So the check is sitting in the table and I kid you not, she came by to check if it was ready for her to take twice. Finally I was like ok let's just go, we paid for our appetizer and drinks and left. Good thing the game was a blow out, we were both upset that she knew we were staying but basically made us get out.",

We went to the bar and played for 15mins before I had to flag down a bartender for drinks. I cashed out and have now been waiting another 15 minutes just to be acknowledged in order to cash out. The absolute worst service we have ever received at any location. The bartender seems more concerned with impressing the ladies than servicing the other customers at the bar. Not one person has smiled at us or made any attempt at even mediocre customer service. I'm disappointed at the fact that it was necessary to rate only one star.",

    "text": "Summery: Avoid  The lady and I were hungry after doing some shopping at the nearby malls. We were trying to settle on something between food court and 200$ dinner. We normally avoid chains and this reminded us why.  Sit down at the bar, order a few drinks to get things going. They are slightly under poured... but what gets me were the garnishes. Her orange goose and soda came with the tiniest sliver of orange you have ever seen, you could see through it... my captain and coke had no limes. We didn't order from the well... at least gives us a proper pour and some proper garnishes... 1 star  First bar course is cheese sticks.. how can you mess this up? Fry it so long the cheese bursts out and inside is a hollow tube of burnt oil and crust. Yummy. The one 2oz portion cup filled half full with marinara sauce didn't really work for 6 cheese was-there-at-one-time sticks...  1 star  But before I had a chance to complain the main course arrived.   Mine looked like a kids meal.. it was a jerk chicken sandwich...inedible. The chicken was fine, but it was ruined with a combo of bad spice and terrible sauce. The bun was a plain white grocery store style... probably came from sams club.. it wasn't what I remember bw3 being like on the east coast. I estimate the chicken served was on the smaller side oft 4oz.. I ate less than half of it. The french fry chips on the side, which were actually good, numbered in the teens. A huge rip off though when paired with a disgusting sandwich and overall portion size. 1 star  She had boneless wings which were fine, by themselves around 3 star. They had obviously been \"quality checked\" because one of the them was missing. -1 star... But the worst offense was being served without celery. - 1star...  total= 1 star..  Service was terrible. I don't hold the bartender responsible for badly cooked food. But nobody asked us if we liked it. The runner auctioned food around the bar and the bartenders who took the order didn't step in to straighten things out. After our baskets sat pushed aside we felt like we were being ignored waiting for the bill.  Leaving was the best part of the meal. BWW is not the best place ever to begin with... but this location is the worst I have ever been to.",

    "text": "Where to start out with this review.  It has been a while since we visited, but still need to share this.  To start, the place was packed as it was the NBA playoffs.  The place was absolutely freezing and I do not get cold very easy.  We spoke with the manager about the issue and he stated he had contacted corporate, but they had not sent someone out to fix the AC.  After ordering the drinks, my mother received her wine in a glass which was hot, but at least clean.    We ordered our food and surprise, stuff came out wrong.  The fries we ordered for the table came out lukewarm at best.  When brought up to the manager, he stated he was surprised since they came out of a 170* fryer (or whatever temp he quoted us). Eventually the fries went back and came out piping hot the next time they were dropped off.  The salad was asked to have the dressing on the side, but it was on the salad.  When explained to the manager, he asked us to taste the \"dressing\" to see what it was.  Instead of fixing the issue, he decided to keep talking about it for way too long.  He finally took the salad back and when it came out, the salad had a complete different chicken on it, but at least the dressing was on the side.  The salad did take way too long to come back out as well.  When we ordered the wings, we had requested ranch on the side, which didn't come out until we asked another couple times for it.  We were surprised about this when the bill came and we were charged for the ranch.  Lastly, the manager was not very kind before he actually took it back.  He was trying to place the blame on us that the food was cold and the salad was made wrong.  He should've taken responsibility for it right then instead of taking forever to take back the food and get it corrected.  Needless to say, this was the worst BWW and we will certainly not be going back to this one.",

Was pleasantly surprised to find out they were open 24x7 and that it was happy-hour when I arrived just after midnight! I had the starter tacos, followed by some wild wings and a few beers.  Everything was really good, including the service.  Two thumbs up and really hit the spot!",

We were seated as soon as we got into the restaurant, the server came over less than 2 mins after we were seated took drink and appetizer orders, asked if we had any questions and then took our order. The waitress came back multiple times during the meal to make sure we didn't need anything and even at one point struck up a conversation. The food was hot and fresh and tasted great. The restaurant was a little busy since it was lunch time but the wait staff was able to keep up. This location is always consistent with food and svc and I wish this location was closer to my house. One of the things i love is they are so quick i have time to eat during my work week because i can get in and out in less than an hour without breaking a sweat!",

Even though he was one of the bartenders and was busy, he came over and checked on us frequently.  I had the boneless wings with teriyaki sauce.  My mom had the regular wings with teriyaki sauce.  We both liked our wings and we had leftovers to take home.  We also had a basket of fries which was just huge.  Fries were crisp on the outside, soft inside.  I love that the wings come with celery, carrots and either ranch or blue cheese dressing.  I would say I prefer the blue cheese dressing.    This place definitely has good food when you want something like bar food.  Good service, good location next to the outlets.  Lots of people there watching a soccer game so you can do that too.",

If you come here during prime hours,  you should be expecting a lengthy wait time if you do not plan to sit at the bar.    Besides the wings being the focal point of this joint, I suggest others to try out their burgers. Their nacho burger and angry orchard chicken burgers are to die for.  Also, try their seasonal beers!  The staff is also very friendly, we haven't had a bad experience with staff!  They try to get your food out as fast as they can but at most times, they do get backed up. I normally have to wait half an hour for my food to get out. I'm not in the restaurant business so I'm not sure how they can improve productivity but I'll leave that one up to them.!  4 stars for food and staff -1 star for lengthy wait times!  Will be back again!",

I was then asking if other locations had different rules regarding pitchers, because I've been to others on a Tues. with absolutely no problem getting a pitcher. The bartender in the green jersey then proceeded to interrupt me with, \"Ma'am, Ma'am, I SAID THUR-MON IS WHEN YOU CAN GET A PITCHER.\" I then called another location which told me there is no restriction at their location and we're more than welcome to head over there. Management I hope you consider changing that rule, considering I had to driver to a farther location to get a deal you are advertising, but you are not offering. The location on Eastern will get my business from here on out. Especially considering how incredibly rude your bartender was, my boyfriend and I walked out.",

Once I entered the facility I had to wait 15 minutes for someone to show up. Constantly being told someone will help me soon. Once someone finally showed up. I was handed less than fresh food. The lady checked the ordered and ensured me everything was there. I had people waiting for be so I took her word for it and headed home. Once I arrived home I noticed a large order of wings was missing. It too me a long while to get there and even longer to get back home. This entire experience was horrible so I rushed back and just ended up returning the entire order. They didn't care about the my experience and just wanted to rush me out the door. The lack of caring and empathy shows they are focused more on the money and less about the customer. I would avoid this place at all cost",

We were there for 3 hours and the staff was very friendly and the bartender didn't pressure us to get more stuff like some places will if you're there too long. The bar area had all the major games on and the draft. They had the volume on for the draft and there were a few others in there watching as well.   Amazing that I called a number of so called \"NFL Team bars\" around town and none were doing any specials or events for the draft. Sad. Two of the places I called the girl that answered didn't even know what I was talking about when I asked if they were showing the draft. At least BWW had something going on. They get bonus points for that.   Otherwise wings were delicious as always and service was good.",

Atmosphere: Sports bar type with a lot of TV's showing any and almost every sporting event that is going on.  Great for family or hanging out with friends to catch the game. The restaurant has 2 sections; full bar side (gotta be 21 and over to sit in there) and restaurant side (everyone) Compete against everyone in the restaurant with the trivia games on the tv screens with game controllers (upon request) while you wait for your food.  My food picks: Wings - Garlic Parmesan is my favorite, all the other flavors are pretty good, such as spicy garlic, buffalo, asian zing. The only flavor I would stay away from is the Caribbean Jerk.  I prefer the Seasoned wedges over fries, but onion rings are always a bonus  Southwest dippers are delish and the mini corndogs and mozzarella sticks are good munchers too!  Overall good experience for a wing place and/or to catch the game and/or grab a drink!",

I came to this place with my family and I ordered the hot BBQ traditional wing and honey BBQ boneless combo to split with my 5 yr old daughter. Quick 20 minutes later food comes out. Okay my daughter is munching on appetizers and celery with ranch trying everything. It looks great til I look at the food and stickers and realize the order is mixed up. It says hot on traditional and hot BBQ on boneless.i realize this  after I eat two wings and its hot AF so I quit eating. The server doesn't check on us the whole meal and when everyone else is done eating he says, \"oh looks like we're done eating, save room for dessert?\" I say, \"No, but..(cut off) let me get you a box and a check. And rushes away. Dude. Calm. Down.  So he comes back drops check and leaves quickly. I have to wait another 10min. He finally comes back and  I told him the sauces got mixed up I did not eat the boneless wings so he walks away saying I'll take 2$ off. We didn't even have silverware the whole time! Are we suppose to eat coleslaw with our hands now? Okay 3 min later he comes back. I say I do not want a 2$ discount I just want some boneless honey BBQ for my daughter cause that's the meal we were splitting can I just reject the discount and get a little portion of the boneless wings for my 5 yr old!? He hesitates but says sure. Comes back in 10 min with a discount on the check and wings the whole time he was in such a hurry my parents couldn't even order another beer. The restaurant has good food it really does compared to other BWW we've been to in Vegas but this is the 2nd time service has been bad. Regardless of the service we still tipped cause we aren't animals but it seriously crossed my mind to just leave him a penny.",

I sat there the first time and 3 people walked in after me and were seated while I wasn't. I finally went up to them and told them and all they did was say \"Okay\" and we had to wait to be seated. I usually brush this off but after we were seated, we didn't get drinks and had to ask to order and flag someone down after 10-15 minutes. After we got our food, which took a while but I didn't mind, we wait 30 minutes after we had asked for the check and To-go boxes over 5 times. The check came, and the to-go boxes never did. After 2 more times of asking, we gave up and left. I still left tip thinking they were just understaffed. As we were leaving, I saw 5 girl workers standing in the corner just talking while it was crazy busy. Then, their manager came out and they all split up pretending to work. I left very annoyed and this was just one experience. I have had 4 other bad experiences at this location which finally put me over the edge to write a review and never go there again. I normally do not give places one star reviews because I like to give people the benefit of the doubt, but after this many times, there is obviously a bigger problem. The service.",

    "text": "i stopped by here on my way into Vegas. I went a little shopping first at the outlet and it made me hungry. We saw this place on the way in so i decided to eat here. There's a BWW close to where i live, but i have not been to it yet. So this was my first time at Buffalo Wild Wings. I have seen the commercials about the customers not wanting to leaving and talking to the referee about extending the game. I did not think it was that great that i wanted to stay longer there. I know it's a commercial, but i would call it False advertising. lol.   So it was a Tuesday and apparently they have cheap wings on this day. You can go with one sauce or with multiple. The minimum per sauce was 3 so i got 5 Hot BBQ, 5 mild, and 5 Honey BBQ. I didn't want to fill myself up too much because there are so many places to eat in Vegas. My friend got the hot mango one and it was pretty spicy and left the lips burning a little bit. But it had good flavor so it was worth the burn the second time.   The service was alright...except she forgot 5 of my friend's wings. lol. I guess our order was too confusing or something. It took a while though to get my change from the bill.... but they were a little busy so it was understandable. I do not like to hate on restaurants. Usually there is a good excuse to why something is not going your way.   This is a good place to watch a sports game on TV though. Especially if there are multiple sports going on at the same time because there are so many TV's on every wall.",

    "text": "Have eaten here numerous times for takeout since I work nights and get off really late.  I appreciate that they are open 24 hours and the online ordering is really convenient.   The food is always good and fresh for the most part. I have had some order oddities like ice cold queso and an order of wings that was all drums and no flats, but nothing that is too problematic. The potato wedges are consistently crispy and delicious (my favorite treat offered by this chain).  My only issue is the customer service for takeout. Every time I order takeout, I end up having to wait at least 10-15 minutes after the scheduled pickup time. I'm not really sure why that is. I think they need to prioritize their takeout orders a little better is all.   They offer a military discount, which is nice, and one of the times I had to wait, the lady was apologetic and offered me a free drink in an effort to compensate.   I think this place would be better for dining in, but seeing as the takeout is all I have to go on, 3 stars.",

    "text": "I ordered they're medium wings which the lady at the front desk said is about 12 to 14 wings which it was.  However I like my wings plain and drenched and ranch. I mean if they made a wing that was like a ranch wing I would order it all the time that's how much I like ranch for my wings. So with that being said I didn't mind being charged for the extra ranch that I order... The ranch that I paid for... But never received. So just as dry as the wings look in the picture trust me it was way worse eating them. Even though I ordered different sauces because she said you can get two kinds of sauces if you order the medium size wings I received three yes three honey BBQ sauces... That's it looking at my receipt clearly I ordered two different flavor sauces and paid extra for my 3 ranch it would have been lovely to receive them. the service was quick at first I thought that was a good thing because she said 15 to 20 minutes but then when you think about it it's clear as to why the service was so quick they only completed half the order. So here I am sitting in my hotel room eating the driest of the driest wings having to dip it in the cheesy macaroni sauce that lacks flavor but is better than the honey barbecue that I have three of.",

There is another BWW right down the street from our home in the SW area, but we still make the 15 minute drive because of the friendly atmosphere. Secondly, we always call ahead of time to ask if they will be airing a specific soccer or basketball game and are always told to come on in and they will take care of us. Whether it be an MLS or La Liga soccer game during a busy NFL day, they always change one of the screens for us. The location near our home refuses to do this during other \"important\" games even though they have 15+ screens playing the same exact thing--big turn off.   Food is always good, any mishaps are taken care of without hesitation.   The last few visits our server has been Jordan. He's very friendly and always checking in on us and bringing refills at just the right time. We know we'll be getting great service when we are seated at one of his tables!   Last but not least, this location is conveniently located in the South Premium Outlets shopping center! It's always nice to have a good meal before heading over to the outlets to do some shopping.",

I ordered boneless wings because it was wing Thursday and they had hardly any sauce on them. One side had no sauce and the other side had little sauce. A friend got some traditional wings and his were soaked in sauce. I don't understand why mine didn't get fully sauced like his. I didn't even bother waiting to tell my waitress because it was already taking her 20-30 minutes to check on us if we needed a refill or anything. We were all getting really frustrated with the service so we just gave up ordering anything else and got ready to leave.",

She got an attitude with us anytime we'd say anything. She was taking our order and her face said every thing, she kept rolling her eyes at us, I guess we were taking to long to order.  We waited almost 30 minutes for our food and it wasn't even busy. We finally got our food and my wings were cold, fries were soggy and the waitress had messed up my friends order. She asked for the buffalo chicken salad but got a sandwich instead. She politely told her that wasn't what she ordered but Jennifer replied with \"Yeah actually you did\" While rolling her eyes and having an attitude... instead of just being okay with it and apologizing. We then told her no so she picked it off the table and threw it on the counter behind us and then stormed off. Less than five minutes later a different lady comes by to give my friend her salad, the lettuce was all wilted, brown and her garlic bread was really burnt and felt like a used sponge. How do you serve something that looks so gross?   We waited about twenty minutes for Jennifer to come back to ask if we were enjoying our food, my friend told her the bread was burnt and asked if she could get a new piece; our waitress just looked at her before walking away shaking her head. Few minutes later she came back and just dropped it on the table and walked away. We didn't see her again until she came to drop off the check.  We thought that maybe she was acting this way with the other customers as well but she was nice and smiling with all of her other tables.  $60 later.. She didn't get a tip from us. We were a paying customer and she wanted to be disrespectful and rude she didn't deserve a tip!",

What I am upset about is when we were leaving Joe was still telling people coming in that the wait was over an hour long so people would leave.

Had to stop on of them to get service and still took them for ever to send some to our table.   Too top it off took over 1 for our food to get to our table and the wings cold.   Lately the company has increased their price and offer less happy hour items. Honestly I am disappointed on where the company is heading and wouldn't be surprised if they start closing stores with the service they provide.   It was fun why it lasted, Cheers!",

I've always just ordered potato wedges with cheese...never knew there was an option. So after seeing the color, I think maybe they mix two kinds of cheese normally.

    "text": "BWW is definitely my go-to spot to go have a beer and watch the game especially now that NFL FOOTBALL has finally started!!! This place is great for big groups, usually always loud environment, so you can have a good time with friends or family and not worry about being too obnoxious if your group gets too loud.   They have your typical \"wing place\" menu, but I definitely enjoy their wing options here over any other big name wing places out west (WING HOUSE is my other FAV but it's only located east and down south). Their wings have great flavored options that are super tasty and the meat on the wings aren't skimpy, always full meat wings.   Place is clean and spacious, and service has always been good. Besides the wings, they also have really good appetizers and I've had their burgers more than once, and the Black and Bleu burger is really good if you're a bleu cheese fan.   Fav hot flavor is def the Mango Habenero, some people say it's too hot but I say if you like \"asian style spicy\" go for it!! I'm never disappointed when eating here.   I like how they have lots of wet napkins at the table already so you never have to ask the server for it.   Like I said, this is my go to place especially with FOOTBALL season and the super big screens just making watching more fun cheering for your teams with friends and family!",

I ordered through Postmates slightly disappointed about the fact that the order I put in should've been a 10 piece rather than a 5, which I received. Postmates is really annoying since you can't directly talk to anyone with problems you have so I decided to call BWW on this matter, the fact that David, the manager, was exceptionally nice enough to give me credit for my unhappy meal really made things a whole lot better. They don't have to fix your problems with a second party but he decided to anyway for the satisfaction of the customer. I'm a consistent BWW customer and will continue being one because of that great service itself ! I eat BWW at least once a week and I always tell my friends that the servers and service is always on point, the fact that they resolved an issue that wasn't really their fault makes me believe their service will continue to be exceptional !!",

The service was slow and they got most of our order wrong. The wings were okay nothing fabulous. I got the chips and salsa as a side...they were Tostitos and jar salsa, same with the ranch. Also the coleslaw was bland and really tasted like a head of cabbage cut up. Really...it's not hard to make salsa and fresh chips and coleslaw. If I wanted store bought items I would have eaten at home. You're a restaurant and you serve crap food. You're also located in middle of restaurant haven, why would I ever go back? I wouldn't! Oh and tend to your bathrooms, 3 towel dispensers and all empty. Also the atmosphere sucked. I felt like I was in a school cafeteria with tvs.",

I asked to sit at a booth, and the waiter told me to wait because she had a lot to do. Okay, understandable.   She comes by 10 minutes later to tell me that the tables were reserved for people waiting. But according to the 4 booths that opened the next 15 minutes, they were reserved for other 2 people parties; who obviously had no interest of staying longer than their meal to enjoy the game. My waiter nor the manager, who we requested a booth from, had checked up on us throughout meal.. And had no concern our request, which made us unhappy. To me, I believe good customer service doesn't mean fulfilling all requests but instead to fully explain and give reasonable explanations to the result. Instead, they found it appropriate to check up next to us, then turn out only giving off a glare.  Going to bdubs all the time at other locations, I have always received the same service. It was disappointing that this location did not own up to those expectations.",

It seemed like we didnt have a server or none of the servers wanted to take us, most likely because they saw kids at the table. After a solid 10 mins, We saw a busser walking by sweeping the floor and we asked him if he could get a server for us. A few mins later a server named Tom came to greet us, and informed us there was a mixup in the table rotation, but he was going to be taking care of us. By this time we were all ready to order so we gave him our app order, drinks, & food. He immediately got us a small side of fries for our toddler and brought waters out right away. Our server was very attentive and polite. I got up to wash my hands and on my way to the bathroom I heard one of the guys that brought our app out say, \"yeah, i dont give a f*k\". That was a little disturbing. I know people have regular lives and all, but maybe dont swear around guests. Anyway, our food came out on time, and hot. We got about 5 orders of Traditional Medium. We always ask for \"extra wet\" because it seems they dont wet them enough anymore and theyll be crispy and dry. Overall a good dinner, and despite the long wait time to be greeted, our server Tom made up for it. Thanks!",

I had this feeling that food was not going to be up to par and sure enough I was right.  I ordered a sampler to start the portions givin where small compared to other times I've gotten this. The onion rings made me sad soggy and small. Cold cheese sticks and wings along side a soggy side of nachos. Then the dipping sauces where barly half full not enough imo.

The floor was trashed and when walking by the kitchen area I looked in (open view when walking to table)  it was no better... I tried to find a health card to see this locations rating but sure enough it wasn't posted. When I told the manager she seems to brush it off... We didn't even order or sit down once we got to the table because food was all over our seats.... So can't say much on the food. Hope it's better then the hygiene of this place",

Plus they open for 24 hours. Though the dine area is closed during late night hours, you can still chill in the bar area.

The chicken is what you can expect from any large restaurant chain. It's a fun place to go with a group of friends order a bunch of beer and wings, what more do you want. The beer selection and service is typically not all that bad either, when in need of hot wings and I nothing else that is local or regional comes highly recommended I will typically default to the Buffalo Wild Wings!

The great thing about B-Dubs are the sauces!  They have about 20 different flavors!  We ordered 24 Boneless Wings in Spicy Garlic and Medium Hot, Buffalo Chips, Fried Garlic Shrooms and some Fat Tires to drink.  It was waaaay too much food for two drunk people!  My favorite thing that we ordered were the Buffalo Chips!  They are not crispy but more like fries cut into little pieces of chip-like heaven.  Our bartender was really nice and made some great suggestions.  She was also from the Yay Area!  Our meal was really cheap too!  Another reason to hit up B-Dubs on your next trip to Vegas!",

The wings their famous for were tiny, the queso and chips we sent back because I can get better queso in a jar at a grocery store. The nachos were so bad that I had to force myself to eat more each time because I was hungry, the cheese sticks and marinara weren't worth taking a second bite of (and I love cheesesticks anywhere else I've been). The boneless wings had too much tooth breaking crunchy batter with too little hot sauce that only covered parts of this awful crunch. The only good thing was the onion rings, ranch dressing, and many giant tvs to watch the game, but even the uncomfortable wooden stools made me never want to go back here!  If you have very low standards for what you consider is good food then eating here is just fine.",

There are 14 flavors to choose from and they have a challenge where if you can finish 6 wings with their blazing sauce (their spiciest) within 12min your wings are free. We didn't take the challenge, but we tried their spicy garlic and wild sauce. Their wild sauce is equivalent to hooters hot flavor. I would recommend the spicy garlic if you want some flavor with a little bit of spiciness in your wings. We also ordered the queso chili fries which were good also. In my opinion, the chili fries were better than most chain restaurants I've had. There are multiple large screen TVs for you to enjoy the sports games going on. If you're in Vegas and want some wings, come here.",

    "text": "I hate to bring B-Wild down a notch since I formerly owned shares of the company and I totally bought into the hype.  However, I have to say that I was really disappointed.  I place B-Wild in competition with places like TGI Fridays, Chili's and BJ's.  In particular, as a fan of Chili's, I felt like this place should wow me beyond any particular experience at Chili's.  Chili's is decent, but it is a heartless chain... B-Wild is supposed to be the happy, super cool bar and grill that is a chain but gives the Mom and Pop type experience.  First issue was the seating.  I felt as if there were not enough boothes and too many standalone tables.  Perhaps it was a layout issue or even a fire issue, but I think a bar and grill should just have a ton of boothes.  It is more comfortable for beer and wings.  Secondly, the food was just not really up to snuff.  The fries sort of soggie and a little bit cold.  It is a real problem when you are serving shoe-string fries.  The wing sauces were fine (spicy garlic and Asian... actually the Asian one was really good), but I thought the the wings were a little on the tiny side.  Plus, $12.49 for 18 would be okay if the wings were a little bit bigger.  It just did not look impressive sitting in a couple of fry trays either.  The burger meat was okay, but I didn't have the option to have the meat medium and it was a little burnt.  I know I ordered cajun style, but come on!  The buns were good, but were cold.  Finally, the service needed a little work.  The food took a long while to come out (might explain the cold fries).  Then some things were forgotten like the side of blue cheese for the wings and my salad.  Finally, I know that it was kind of slow, but servers were standing around talking to eachother rather than watching the tables.  Maybe it was just an off day... maybe it is better on a game day... maybe I should have had a pitcher of beer...!  I suppose that one should not be so picky about a bar and grill, but I really like the concept and appreciate the corporate management of the company.  So, I hope that they can make some improvements if the issue is systematic.  If it is just this one place, then I hope the manager regulates this location better.",

My boyfriend tried their hottest wings (not the challenge) but said it wasn't as hot or as good as Atomic from Wingstop.  I'm in love with Lemon Peppered Wings and Buffalo Wild Wings didn't have it =(  However, they have a wide selection of other flavors ranging from sweet to hot.  I'm not a fan of sweet wings so I ordered 12 wings, half Spicy Garlic and half Medium.  I also tried my friend's parmesan garlic and enjoyed it as well.  Besides wings, I also wanted to try their nachos, onion rings, and sandwiches.  I was told that their onion rings are nothing out of the ordinary so I refrained.  I decided I'd try the nachos and sandwiches next time I visit, which probably won't be anytime soon because there aren't any near Sacramento or San Diego =(  They have special deals for lunch and good happy hour deals as well, although I don't remember exact times.  I love, love that they have the trivia game where you can play against your friends or other people dining at the same time!  It's so entertaining!  I also love that they're able to split the check so that each person's order is separated and includes tax so that each person knows exactly how much to pay!  3 stars for the wings, another star for everything else!",

The price was reasonable and we ordered two flavors, medium and Honey BBQ.  Medium was not as hot as I expected.  Honey BBQ was not bad.  It actually tasted sweeter if I had a buffalo first and then a honey bbq.  Not sure why but it worked.  The fries were good and crispy.  The sauce was too much and the wings themselves were not a little bit crispy.  It doesn't taste like it was ever fried.  The skin was kind of soggy and greasy.    The server was very nice though and she was just attentive enough.    If you're at the Outlet Mall, there is a ton of food options inside the mall.  I think I would have been more satisfied with maybe panda express' orange chicken.",

Well me and 2 friends went here for lunch today and we waited nearly 50 minutes to get our food.  That's a crazy long time.  Turns out they had a problem with their system and because of the issues, our order probably got lost.  We assume that's what happened when the bartender serving us asked what sauces we wanted again about 30 minutes in to our wait.  Well the food was good once we got it and a manager came over and talked to us to explain the system issues.  She said she would discount the check for us.  Turns out she discounted the whole thing, so despite waiting for a long time the food and drinks ended up being free.  Can't beat free!!!  So I gave this 4 stars because I respect places that recognize when they screwed up and are willing to give us a free meal in order to maintain our business for the future.  So many places want to just shut you up and not really do much for you, but 3 guys eating meals for free because you messed up is a good example of what they should be doing to keep customers happy.  I may not come here on my 1 hour lunch break very often because of this, but I will go back again other times.",

    "text": "Can you say over rated? Buffalo Wild Wings is lucky that I love chicken wings other wise this place wouldn't even sniff a 3 star rating. Why you ask? Well for one thing their wings were tiny tiny tiny. For the price we paid just doesn't cut it for how far this place is from my sisters house, just doesn't cut it. I know we got a Buffalo Wild Wings place back in the Bay Area but it's about 20-30 minutes away, but after this experience with wings, I probably won't be coming to any Buffalo Wild Wings, unless I really had no choice.  The sauces here was bad! I'll be quite honest here, I am use to Wing Stop Wings a sauces but by no means am I comparing how they make their wings here to Wing Stops. I have enough wing experience to know that BWW didn't look to appealing. For one thing the garlic parmesan flavor just looked like throw up, but already having to buy it, I had to try it. It had a lot flavor, not that I don't like flavor, its just that it seemed like it had to much flavor, but my main question is who will like to eat something that looked like vomit sauce? Well, ya I did, but I can assure you that I wasn't pleased eating it. The other flavor that I got on my wings were the Caribbean Jerk and even that wasn't great, it had a little spice and kick but not the flavor I was hoping for. My son ordered the mini corn dogs and what it looked like he got was corn breaded vienna sausages, if my son wanted vienna sausages I could of just got a can of e'm and warmed e'm up with some rice (he probably would of enjoyed e'm better) I'm just a bit disappointed on how badly our food turned out and how not great it tasted.  I'd hate to put this place down because I LOVE chicken wings, and like I said this place would be anything lower than 3 stars without my love for chicken wings. If it wasn't for how cool how this place looked with all their sports TVs, cool little trivia games for the kids and huge obsession with chicken wings, believe me this place would get 2 stars.  P.S. Please Buffalo Wild Wings, upp your game up and stop serving those dinky little wings that don't fill me up unless I buy 20 wings to myself and then at the end of the day you guys charging me over priced little wings. Maybe think about changing the vomit sauce, it doesn't look very appealing.",

I came here today with my parents and I have to say if the food did not make up for the lack of service the restaurant would have a piece of our minds! The thing that got me the most was the guy that I managed to flag down had the nerve to point his finger at me to wait. So I did because I saw he had waters to deliver BUT get this! Instead of coming back and acknowledging us about what we needed nope, he just walks past us numerous times!! And don't get me started on our waitress...Overall, I can see that these people working today were very territorial over their tables instead of working as a team. This is a strong reflection on the manager who just walked around aimlessly and voiced no control whatsoever.   If there is even a next time I'll bring my pet turtle and see who serves us faster.",

    "text": "Somehow, my partner and I ended up at this location 45 minutes before the Women's World Cup game was about to start. That should have been a red flag to leave, but we were so hungry we decided to stick around.  That was a mistake.  We were seated after waiting about 15 minutes, and - although we weren't there for the game - we actually got a pretty decent seat to see the giant screens. Our waiter was quick to get our drinks ready, but after that instance it was like he disappeared. We were serviced by a Captain, whose name was Alex, and he was very friendly and helped us try sauces.   Our waiter, on the other hand, took 25 minutes to refill our sodas - which was odd, considering we sat at the table right next to the soda fountains. He also only came over once to ask us how our food was.   When we finally received our food, we realized my partner's fries had not shown up. We told three different employees, and it wasn't until the last employee we told that we finally got his fries - which was about 15 minutes after our food was served to us.   I get that Bdubs gets busy - especially during sporting events - but the fact that my partner and I watched our waiter service other tables and NOT ours was incredibly insulting. Not to mention we were halfway through our meals before we finally received our french fries. My experiences here are always mediocre, but this by far was the worst. I plan to avoid this location, and try another location or just avoid BWW altogether.",

The special does not include drinks or fries so you have to order that separately. I highly encourage the potato wedges with cheese, then dip them into mild sauce and ranch.   The prices on any other day are about average with the rest of the market. Plan on spending at least $15 per person incl taxes and tip. All their food is great.   Sit at the bar if you want fast service. They take approx 15 mins to bring your food which gives you time to check email return phone calls and catch up on your Hollywood gossip as you wait.",

You're better off buying frozen appetizers from the grocery store than spending $3 on their extremely small and unappealing starters. The parmesan garlic boneless wings I ordered looked like they were thrown into a pan of somebody else's leftover sauce, so I might as well have just been eating popcorn chicken. Again, I'd be better off buying my own frozen food. At least if I made my own appetizers and wings, they would be served hot.  The service here was just as terrible as the food. Four different servers came by my table, and I swear that not one of them smiled or even attempted to be friendly. They took forever to get anything done, and they were unapologetic about it. My table didn't have many requests, but the servers either forgot or ignored them. It wasn't busy at all, so I've just come to the conclusion that they suck.",

We always sit at the bar, with at least 2 projection screens on EACH wall. So much to look at, and a perfect circle bar in the middle.   We sit there for the comfort, easy football watching, quick drinks, and the bartenders. Sorry to the rest of them, but we always wait for BRIAN to serve us. He is quick (with the drinks/food and his wit) and very easy to talk with. He became our favorite pretty quickly. Its great when you have someone at your favorite place to grab wings that you can go to every time, and its GREAT 100% of your visits.  The video poker/black jack on the counter tops are pretty great too. As long as you put in at least $10 into the machine, you get a free drink. Thank you BWW!",

Wings are always pretty good but they're not cheap. Why not have .75 cent wing specials!  Bar is a decent place to hang out but I don't love the dining room. Try could try to break it up with partial walls or something. It doesn't feel clean. The lighting might be a little too bright. Check out Twin Peaks,  much better feel inside (and their wings are good and they have cute waitresses). Now that I'm writing this it's clear in my mind that Twin Peaks is better,  better menu and nicer, cleaner feeling atmosphere, better bar. I'm rating BWW at a 4 and that's very generous.",

They always short us on the wings, they always give us an incomplete order, and I think the worst part is they always give you attitude when you talk to them. The only passable person is the manager David (I believe is his name.) He was helpful but I still got back with missing pieces and he did not really help me look if the order was complete.

The food, ambiance, and service are average at best. Other than the wings, nothing else is really worth getting off the menu. The burgers and sandwiches are pretty meh and overpriced for what you get. Fortunately the wings are delicious and there is a good selection of sauces and dry rubs to go along with them.   I guess this is the place to watch sports but I always feel that the image from the  projectors is washed out and you can never quite hear whats going on. $6-7 for a beer is more than what I would want to pay for a place like Bdubs. This location in particular gets a lot of traffic especially from tourists as its just a mile south of the Strip. Service is decent if they aren't busy, but expect to wait a while for a table if its packed.",

It took our server 3 trys to get our drink order correct (an orange juice and lemonade, nothing too complicated). They brought the wrong appetizer to the table, took that away then took another 20-minutes to get the right one to us. Then brought the wrong entrees, and again took another 20-minutes after those were taken away before getting our food. Never got our drinks refilled during the whole time we were there.  Overall the whole staffed behaved like it was their first day. Running around like chickens with their heads cut off, going from table to table with an order of food until they hit the right one. It is obvious there is a lack of leadership and guidance from the management of this location. This is an example of not training the staff and letting their shifts just be a good time for them and requiring little to no discipline from a lazy manager. Either that or the management here has absolutely no idea how to run a restaurant.  I highly recommend avoiding this location. They are lucky to be on the main road into the strip, so they can survive with little to no repeat business, because i cannot imagine anyone coming here would come again.",

Change your distributor for goodness sake. Maybe you saved a couple bucks, but I'm tired of getting the deformed reject leftovers that Walmart doesn't want.  Seasoning is always the same; love it.

I try to come when they have their weekly specials, but I honestly don't come half as often as I'm tempted to.   This location is open 24 hours, which is pretty bad a$$!    Bring on the heat.",

On my way to the restroom two servers were blocking the walkway, said excuse me politely and one of the servers rudely told me to wait a second, I guess stepping to the side while playing on her phone was a difficult task.  When I ordered my food by a very polite and friendly bartender I adamantly told him to please make sure it was very crispy didn't care if they burned it. Well....it didn't come out raw.  All in all the food was good and thanks to the friendly bartender my experience was good and will definitely be back.",

I always forget when you go later in the evening during any sort of game you'll have about 30 beer bellied guys shouting at the top of their lunges at a flatscreen in a dark restaurant. The waits are usually longer than my appetite would like but it's not unbearable.   While I'm not a fan of the atmosphere, I always enjoy my wings. They have a variety of flavors that you can choose from and even taste the sauces before you officially make your decision. Whether you get boneless or bone-in, they're always nice and crispy and perfect to my liking. My favorites are always the parmesan garlic, spicy garlic, lemon pepper, and thai curry. Wings come with a side of carrots and/or celery sticks, yum!  Best part about BWW: Tuesdays are 60c bone-in wings, Thursdays are 60c boneless wings. You're welcome.",

The wings could definitely use some extra sauce and I have to ask for bleu cheese since they only give me one each time (one little cup for 6-8 wings is not enough.)  The alcoholic drinks are a joke, unless you are a beer person.  They hardly put any patron in the margaritas and they take longer than most to come refill your water glass.  The lunch portions/price are fair, otherwise I'd stop coming altogether.  This location does leave more to be desired though.",

And normally I would have done this through their <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbwwlistens.com&s=c6435c22125a9028ee60b3f778dd1596e775fa5e287dca69873db3f58ac3d279\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bwwlistens.com</a> survey however I realized I ddnt get a receipt in the bag, I guess because I ordered online but theres no customer survey code when you order online and receive the confirmation email of your order.   I come to this location quite often and most of the time I'm ordering for pick up either by calling in or ordering online. My order says it will be ready by 10:20pm...and the online order says pick up was ready at 10:20 on the dot.   I get there at 10:20 but I dont go in until 10:25 because rarely is it ever ready when it says your order is ready. I get inside and give them my name and they check on the order and say they're still waiting on a couple more items. (Nothing new here...) I normally wait an extra 10 minutes anyway.  Now its 10:45pm and the employee working the pick up orders comes out and apologizes and states they're still waiting on the chicken for the salad I ordered...no worries, thanks for the update.   11pm I finally get my order and I go to my car because at this time I'm hungry and aggravated that it took an hour for my food to be \"ready\"  but I just had to make sure the order was right...this time they ddnt review the order and show everything like they normally do. I guess they were just trying to get my order asap since I've waited so long already...  I find theres no chicken in my salad which was the last thing we were waiting on....dressing was not in the bag and another item in my order was incorrect.   I go back in and let them know..and once again another apology. It takes another 10-15 minutes before I get the order corrected.  My advice to the bww...fix your online ordering system...if it says your food is ready for pickup it should be \"ready\" for pick up. Second, how does $10 justify my wait for my online order that took over an hour to complete when I ordered $60 worth of food from you? Also the place wasnt even that busy when I got there...",

    "text": "Night server was an asshole!!! I went there last night with some co-workers in a party of 9 for a work lunch. We work nights so we got there at about 1am. The place was pretty much empty and only had 3 occupied tables. We've been there before and know some of the employees. We're usually treated fair but usually leave good tips because we go there all the time.   Last night this asshole came to our table and before taking our order, he demanded, \"Everyone here needs to show me their ID\". We're all between 35-45 years of age. We thought it was strange because this had never happened before and additionally his tone was very short and demanding with us. We were at a table top and not at the bar, we were not gambling, we did not even order a drink because we were on work hours. None the less, we all produced valid ID except a co-worker who had a driver license that was punched \"VOID\" because his new license was still being mailed. He told him, you've to go. We were shocked. We told the server that we were not drinking or gambling, we just want some food. He still refused to accommodate and say the co-worker had to leave the business, he can't even be in the business.   We tried to explain a driver license served 2 purposes, authorizing you to operate a motor vehicle and an identifying the carrier. The fact that its VOID means he might not be authorized to operate a vehicle but it can still be use as an identification. It's equivalent to a non-operator state ID. He refused to listen and kept talking over us. Even when I tried to explain that's WHY DMV NO LONGER TAKE IT from you, so you can identify yourself. The fact that it's punched VOID, doesn't mean our identity had changed or does it mean our photo been altered or our personal info is invalid. Otherwise, it should have been confiscated. He kept saying it's company policy and he doesn't want to lose his job. He finished with \"..so what's it going to be, are you going to order or are you gonna go?\"  Feeling unease about his attitude and quality of our service, we all decided to leave.   First, I asked that BWW re-evaluate their policy if this is truly their policy. Try to understand the spirit of the law to why ID check is required; - are you checking to verify age  - are checking vehicle operator status  - are screening us to board a plane.   Please explain common sense to your employees, the guy completely missed it.   Second, have this guy check his customer service skill. Horrible approach, horrible attitude. He became visibly upset after we took up on one of the options of his ultimatum. We did our best to remain calm and not try to disturb the business as it's one of our regular. He was very animated and expressive walking off screaming aloud, throwing his arms in the air in front of other patrons. We never even raise our voice at him, we tried to keep a low tone the entire time. Not only did he do a poor job explaining his point, he displayed a very unprofessional demeanor in front of others. As we were leaving, we can still hear him screaming from the kitchen. We didn't get his name but he was a heavy set guy with a dark beard.",

I figured I would be able to cut the wait time by ordering through their app while shopping with the family at the outlet mall next door. Gosh that was a big mistake. It's pretty much like waiting on an order that you just put in or maybe worse. First off, it didn't appear busy while standing at the pickup counter, I was actually the only one and NO acknowledgement whatsoever. The hostess clearly sees me that I need help and just ignores me until I approach her. I've noticed it getting even busier when Uber eats people start lining up behind me and waiting a long time for their food as well.  Really disappointed in this whole experience. I wish I could just cancel my order but it's already paid for and I haven't seen any staff come out yet. I'm a loyal customer but I'm going to have to switch with Wing Stop.

I ordered 14 traditional wings with the salt and vinegar rub on them. I think they forgot the rub?! The wings were fried to a crisp and one was completely inedible.   As we were sitting in the dining room with two other parties, this lady (who looked to maybe be a manager) walked in the room and turned off EVERY SINGLE TV with NO explanation of why. She didn't acknowledge us, let us know that they are trying to close that area of the restaurant. Absolutely rude, a simple \"hey, were closing the dinning room soon, would you like me to leave a TV on for you?\" Not a word though.  One of us went to the bar to order birthday shots for our friend and they were completely ignored at the bar. When the bar tender finally acknowledged her, they didn't believe that she was sitting in the dining room (we were left in the dark) and followed her to our table to verify that we were sitting there. Really? He verified that she wasn't lying and let her order the shots. They took forever to make them so we ended up just going over to the bar and waiting there. It was obvious that they didn't want us there. We ordered a couple more drinks and left soon after.  The food and customer service completely lacked and I am disappointed. Bdubs is a very popular place in Las Vegas and it seems no matter what location I go to, the food is at best a 3/5 and the service is usually worse than that.",

The service was average they sat another duo and crossed my name off the list but they were able to seats us once i said hey what's going on. We didn't get water when we asked for a refill. However if your looking for good ole chicken wings you can depend on their food. They let us get four different sauces to dip which was awesome. Our favorite was the Asian Zinger yum. The fried pickles were great I enjoyed the cornmeal breading. Not a bad place to taken some wings and sports.",

Luckily the line was not long at all we waited like 5 minutes to sit down, ordered within 10 and got our food pretty quick also. Very impressed giving the amount of people there. Best time to go is during games just because the specials are pretty awesome. I ordered 20 wings, burger special that came with fries for $5, and a pitcher of beer that was also for $5. I mean the deal was great for the amount of food we got and the burgers were actually really good! Waitress was very friendly and fast, I think her name is Jasmine. Overall great experience and will be coming back!",

We watched her work the 4 tables for another 12 minutes so we decided to leave since it was obvious that after about 20-25 minutes we didn't even have a glass of water and wouldn't be getting any type of decent service whatsoever.",

The straw that broke the camels back was when I attempted to order through door dash tonight.  I ordered at 11:45pm. The site said they stop taking orders at 12:30 so I still had 45 minutes. At 12:20 I got a text saying my order was canceled. When I contacted door dash they said Buffalo Wild Wings canceled my order and they never confirmed it. I contacted BWW and the very rude girl that answered said they stopped taking orders at 11pm. My order was canceled after waiting over 30 minutes and since the store processed for a refund I will not receive it because I paid with a gift card. Money cannot be returned to a gift card therefore I'm out this $20.  I will never return or order from this location again. The orders are never right, the bar service is absolutely terrible and we've received frozen wings twice. Absolutely obnoxious. Who is running this place!?",

    "text": "This review is mainly in regards to their Fantasy Football Draft promo.  Last year ('08 season) one of my fantasy football leagues saw an ad for hosting your draft party here, so we thought we would give it a try. It was pretty cool...we booked a date and time several weeks in advance and when we arrived they had a nice private table set up for us. We also got a great draft kit that included a board (we were able to hang it up on the wall) and color coded player stickers that were bright and visible for all at the table to see. We also got gift certificates for future visits and a discount on the bill. We had such a good experience that there was no question that we would be back for our draft in '09.  So, this year I called three weeks prior to make our reservation. The guy manager that I spoke to was pleasant and helpful on the phone. I even had to call a couple of days later to change to date (same guy, very accommodating). On the day of our draft, very different story. I showed up early and noticed that a table was not set up for us. I inquired at the bar and the bartender just pointed to a high-top for us to sit at. This would not do, especially since we need a quieter area for the 12 of us to hear each other and wall space to hang our board. I started to wander over to the table we had last year and as a server walked by I asked for the manager. I waited, and waited, and still no manager, so my friends and I pushed tables together ourselves and sat down. Finally the manager arrived..she was very unwelcoming and told us we had to sit in the bar because she only had one bartender on and no server that could serve us. I explained to her that we wanted to sit here, that we had been here last year (same time at night) and it was an ideal setup, and that one of our players wasn't even 21 and able to sit in the bar. She was very rude and gave in to us sitting there eventually, but not without threatening us with the police!! Oh, yeah, we are in the dining/restaurant part of the place because like I said one of our guys is 20, and she's telling us that there is a curfew on the strip (mind you, we are no where near the resort corridor) and if the police come in, its not her problem. Then she went on to say that all the servers were leaving...we said \"fine\" and that we would just walk to the bar to order food and drinks. In the end we spent a lot less money because it was difficult to keep getting up in the middle of all our action to get more beer and food. No discount either. One other thing, another fantasy football team was there that same night and didn't seem to like being told they had to sit in the loud bar area either...they eventually moved all of their stuff in the dining/restaurant part too.  So...I am also in another fantasy league. For the last four years, this league has always done its draft at Hard Rock Cafe. This year, based on my experience from '08 I convinced them to have the draft and BWW. After the experience with my first draft of '09 I called the day before to reconfirm the reservation and to make sure that the table we wanted would be available. Of course, the manage (the guy) didn't have our reservation. What!! We made it three weeks prior!! good thing I called. Again, I got there early (eager to make sure everything was going to go well especially after I got everyone to break from our HR Cafe tradition). We did get the table we wanted and we were even going to get service this time! woo hoo! Lots more drinking and food this time! Just as everyone shows up the manager (a manager, not the lady from the previous draft) informed us that they had no more draft kits! Really!! Are you kidding me!! We booked three weeks ago and I had even confirmed with the day manager who said nothing about not having any draft kits!!! I was so embarrassed and pissed off. I really thought my team was going to have a good experience and want to come back year after year. I guess we are just going to have to go back to HR Cafe or I hear Hooters has draft parties?? BOO WILD WINGS!!!  P.S. I spent the first 25 years of my life in Buffalo....your wings are NOT real buffalo wings!!!  P.P.S One star for the potato wedges with cheese and the really nice, attentive server we had the second draft of '09.",

    "text": "My friend and I visited this location on Friday. We hadn't eaten dinner the night prior so we were really looking forward to a great lunch here. We sat at the bar and ordered a drink. My friend (male) went to the restroom and saw an employee walk out of the stall and instead of him washing his hands he proceeded to walk out. We were keeping an eye out to see if he was serving anyone food in our section. THANKFULLY he wasn't on the bar side or else we would've walked out. Turns out we see him and continue to watch him to see what his role was. He didn't handle any food, thankfully, but did see him with a rag to wipe down tables. At this point we discussed speaking with the manager, but were scared our food would be messed with. So we waited until after our meal to discuss it with the manager who's name was Angie. We spoke with her after our meal to address the situation with her. We were again disgusted with the way she handled it. Her first reaction was eww, then proceeded to say ok I'll talk to him. I have been in the rest. industry for over ten years and was surprised we didn't get an apology or a, this is not how we conduct business here and our crew is told to be sanitary. I feel bad for the people who's tables he wiped down. I don't see Buffalo Wild Wings the same anymore. Disgusting",

Take my advice pick any place other then this WBW location to eat at even at the bar the young lady working would rather visit then take your order, Stay away!",

    "text": "This was the worst service I've ever gotten from a buffalo wild wings. When we first got there, there was no one upfront to seat us for a few minutes. When a hostess finally walked up she looked confused and did not acknowledge us at first. After we were seated, our waitress seemed like she was rushing us. Kept trying to upsell us when we were asking questions. We asked about how to redeem points and she was asking if we wanted to redeem them and we said we weren't sure how they were to be used. She kept talking to us like we knew what we were doing but we were trying to explain that we were not familiar with this process. After finally figuring it out we made our order, then she came back, said she dropped our paper on the floor, so we needed to tell her the order again, after receiving our food, the order was wrong. When we tried to explain she was confused. We finally figured it out and also asked for more ranch. When she came back a few minutes later we got the order fixed but now still waiting on Ranch. Then she came back with the check... so we asked for boxes. We barely ate any of the food. There were 3 of us there,  she brought 2 boxes. Finally the ranch came, then we had to ask for another box... afterwards it felt as though she was lingering around while we were trying to figure out how much we wanted to tip her. To he honest we didnt want to tip at all after the service we got. Oh and the other thing was when she brought our drinks she took the lid off of the margarita and started shaking it without the cover so obviously she spilt some. What was the point of buying the bigger one if she was just gonna pour it on the table? After we paid our bill, we stayed to finish our drinks, she never came back to check on us. We never seen her again after that. This was the worse service we've ever had at any one of your guyses location and I don't think we'll be coming back to that one either.",

He mumbled for some reason.  Next was how he gave us our food, he threw the bone trays in front of us like we were some kind of animals lol. Next we asked him for ranch, he told us about how it was 60 cents but we didn't mind and ordered it anyways. It took about 30mins to get five ranch dipping sauces. Are you serious ? Lol. And to end the service with a bang, two of my friends asked for a refill on their waters. He comes back with the check and their waters, HALF WAY FILLED AND WITH NO NEW ICE. This dude was out of his mind with that kinda service. Never going to this location again. On the receipt his name was Phoenix, so if you see him just ask for a new waiter. Have a good one and hope you guys take my advice.",

I always ask for extra wet wings, but it's almost impossible to receive this service. Also, the bone in wings are pretty inconsistent in size. Most don't have enough meat, so boneless in are better. The place itself is clean and the servers are nice but they seem busy. I can see myself coming back, but I would probably not order wings.  On the bright side, they do great catering requests. They always put enough sauce in large orders.",

When I came here a couple months ago, I explained to the server I was on lunch and needed to be out quickly.  They said no problem, but it ended up being a 1.5 hour ordeal to get the food, eat and gtfo!  Today, I asked for a booth for me and my wife to sit together and the host tried to sit us at a table.  I asked him for a booth when I saw three available and he told me he needed to clean them.  So I said okay, no problem...5 minutes goes by and nobody is doing anything.  Again, here I am on my lunch break.  I decided to just walk out and go to Burger King drive thru which gave me fantastic service.  This is about the 3rd time in 3 months this has happened at BWW and I'm done with this place.  This is sad too, because I really love the wings.  Don't come here if you value your time, because they sure as hell don't.",

Love the hours, but not the best as far as meals/drinks go.  They've got $3.00 appetizers (only on certain ones - mozzarella sticks, mini corn dogs, onion rings, chips and queso) but not on wings :( and $3.00 on certain beer and alcohol.. Again, not on what I ordered (I like my crown and 7)  Happy hour is only in the bar area. It was pretty crowded tonight but luckily we found a table.   Overall not a bad place if you're into sports and don't mind being in a loud restaurant.",

My girlfriend and I stopped in to get some wings and a beer. Had to flag down the bartender to get anything while another employee was eating behind the bar and what I assume was another bartender counted his money. We were completely ignored for about 10 minutes until I said something while the bartender walked by. It wasnt even busy. The place was literally at least half empty yet there were people waiting for a table even though there were many servers just standing around. We sat at the bar hoping to get faster service but to say it was slow would be a gross understatement. Nobody could be bothered to take our orders for food or drinks. We ordered a bunch of really spicy wings and sat there for an eternity with our mouths burning while we waited for someone to come by to get us even a water refill. We sat there trying to close out for a good 15-20 minutes when someone who later identified himself as a manager came by. I asked him to close out and expressed how terrible we had been served/not served and he couldnt care any less. He gave a meaningless apology and told us he would have the bartender close us out. I told him we had already waited long enough and wanted him to do it. He lazily sauntered over and closed us out. He gave some meaningless apology and said he had never heard anyone say that before. Based on the prior reviews he is clearly out of touch with reality. WHERE IS B DUBS CORORATE MANAGEMENT???",

It's probably the smallest bww I've been to.  When you walk into buffalo wild wings you expect to smell the aroma of  many different spiced wings, however here our nostrils was met with a strong foul odor known as the sewage pipe. It reeked throughout the restaurant, they used a fan to blow out the smell out the back door.   Anyhow after that stinky issue we order our wings. I must say the wings here they don't go cheap on the sauce! Usually the Mango Habanero is not as hot but the Sauce here gave my lips/tongue a burning sensation.   So for those wondering if there is a 24 hour buffalo wild wings out there in Vegas. Well here it is!",

    "text": "We were invited to a friend's surprise birthday dinner at BWW yesterday. The guest of honor and his girlfriend (the planner) were running late, and the wife and I ended up being the first people from our group. We were told to ask for our party's table, the hostess said they don't take names/reservations, and she didn't know anything about it. Turns out, the General Manager either doesn't know how to inform her employees of group reservations, or her employees just don't know how to do their jobs. After the rest of our experience, I am leaning toward incompetent employees.  Once the planner called and talked to the hostess and explained everything to her, suddenly a group table was set up. We were seated and had our drink order taken relatively quickly. That first round of drinks turned out to be the ONLY one I got. If you aren't drinking alcohol, the waitstaff does not care to check up on you. And, one of their families or close friends was a table over from us, you can guess where the service went.  I have been privy to many large group activities with menu based ordering. Intelligent staff will either section off the order or at least make notes as to where the food goes. Not sure if our order taker did that, as the staff that brought out the food would stand, literally, next to tables about 5 feet away from us and use a normal speaking voice asking us who's food was in her hands.   If you have never been to a BWW before, they are big rooms with maybe a dozen or more TV sets playing sports. Add to that, a couple large parties in the room (one of which was having a great time laughing constantly), the room gets a bit loud. It is OK in that situation to speak up, or get closer to the table to ask where the food goes. Enunciation and speaking up are important too. Many of us could only discern partial words coming out of the server's mouth when asking about the food in her hands.  The food was OK, nothing spectacular, for us at least. The couple across from us ordered some wings (were brought the wrong type boneless vs bone-in) and one batch had such a horrific flavor she could not stand the first bite. The servers never came by to ask if the food was ok, and this girl was too polite to yell at someone to get their attention.  Our food order included some sides to dip our food in, which were never received, but still on our check. We, of course, had those taken off. The $5.00 \"service charge\" for our large group is a bit of a crock. Had we gotten service, the staff would have been given nice tips. Being that we were forced to pay that much, that was about $4.95 more than they deserved.  If you want a sports fan friendly place to drink over priced alcohol and eat overpriced food, BWW is a decent enough place to get raucous with your friends.  However, if you would like to get what you order, have your drinks refilled AT ALL and enjoy your visit, you may want to go elsewhere.",

    "text": "Oh man I have a mixed review. We came here for game 6 of Lakers vs Suns.  It's cool that there's lots of big tv's showing all sports. The vibe is cool, loud n fun. We sat at the bar and the bartenders r cool and nice. But daym...I'm starving!!   We ordered our wings during the first quarter and now we are on the fourth quarter and nothing. The food didn't come and the bartender checked with the waitress three times. But every time the bartender asked the waitress, the waitress shook her head, I dont know if that meant no, she hasn't checked it or no, it's not ready. What?don't they have tons of wings back there? Like thousands and they can't find 25 pcs of wings for us? Ridiculoid!! We ended up cancelling our order during the last 5 minutes of the 4th quarter. What chaps my hide is there is no empathy and although we spent lots on beer, there was no \"hey sorry for the missing wings order, here's a glass of beer on us\". Nothing for our miserable wait...nada.  Everyone else gettin their wings except for us. Man, we also had slow slow service in the Torrance location, 1hour wait for 25 pcs. And here too? Im trying to give BWW a chance but it can't redeem itself. It would have been nice to be munching on some wings with the beers but whatever. Never again.  We are so hungry that we are going next door to Cane's...that actually is great which I will post in another review.",

Waitress took them back to the kitchen for maybe 3 minutes and they were unevenly warm and i assume because all that they did was put them in a microwave. Sauce was slathered unevenly and everything else on the table has gotten cold by this point. Refills are hard to come by but the worst disappointment was the food that should represent BWW. Frozen, out of my own fridge would at least be cooked to health code regulations and i wouldn't at least have to worry about that. Will not return!",

We always sit at that bar and they have an awesome Happy Hour menu, appetizers for $3 and certain alcohol like Absolut vodka for $3. We get our wings naked extra crispy with sauce on the side and the wings still come out juicy and not dry at all. We stick to mango habanero which is sweet and has heat to it (a little goes a long way!) last night we tried the spicy garlic sauce which has a good combination of sweet and spicy, it almost taste like garlic aioli.",

For some reason this bdubbs just seems slightly less personable and more commercial to me than the other ones.  Maybe because it's on the strip?  But, it usually takes a little longer to get my food and quite a bit longer just to place my order here.  Quality of the food however is about deliciously the same.  Yay wings.",

    "text": "I've very much in a wings & beer phase at the moment, so I was excited to try BWW on a recent Vegas trip. Compared to Wingstop, I like the wings here much better - they're tender and juicy yet still crispy and crunchy on the outside, and they have so many more flavors to choose from. Caribbean jerk was my favorite of the 5 or so we tried (tons of heat and flavor), with Azian zing coming in a close second. The garlic parmesan was a bit dry, but they did bring us a little cup of the sauce on the side.   Not sure if this is so with all their locations, but this one had many big screen TVs with different games on around the room. Great place for game day. Also, this is the only place I've been to that gives you more ranch than you could ask for! Being someone who must dip every bite (wings, fries, celery, you name it), I was very impressed. I'll definitely try and make it back (to another location, obviously) to try more flavors!",

But before the waiter could take our drink orders we watched them  combine two tables together for a party of 10 that had just walked in and said they waited longer than us  lies. And you can't make reservations and the place is small as heck.... I think its because we were black and the other party wasn't. I don't know. But we ended up leaving.

This most recent visit, I tried calling ahead to place my order (for about 10 minutes) and just received a busy/disconnect signal. I got to the restaurant, placed my order to go (20 wings, small fries), and promptly sat down. Approximately 35 minutes later, I get up and ask the employee behind the cashier to check on my order - low and behold my order magically appeared. Oh, and there were no fries with the order (which I discovered when I got home, my fault for not checking in the store). This location is also much stingier with the amount of sauce they put on their wings compared to the Eastern location. Food turns out decent, but compared to the other locations I've been to this store doesn't make the cut for customer service.",

    "text": "I love me some chicken wings, so thought I would suggest this place for a friend in town on business as a place to grab some wings. Had seen it a couple times when I lived in the Area and he was staying at Mandalay Bay.   Arrived on a Saturday afternoon, on a game day. Really packed in the bar and the main floor. I had been here once before and the bartenders were really slow-even for a beer, so decided to give this place another shot with my friend.   Took about 15 minutes to get seated, even with a few tables on the main floor obviously open. Some pretty cute sports attired girls working there, who I think might have taken longer than needed to seat us because all the staff is young and flirting back and forth and shooting the shit more than working. But that's cool, it's a relaxed  environment and they are easy on the eyes.   Waded through the sea of people and sat down. Waited about 15 mins between the water person and our actual server taking our order. Guess it's to be expected on game day-I'm not a big sports person, but I do enjoy watching people get riled up and yell and scream when sh*t hits the fan on the million flat screens they have on the walls.   I ordered the 48 or 50 piece wings for $34.95 with 4 different types of sauces and my friend had a standard burger.  Place was cracking and only took about 20. I chose the Teriyaki, Lemon Pepper, Thai Curry and my favorite Mango Habenero'.   All the chicken had the bones (I prefer it that way) and all probably cooked slightly longer than needed to be-but not a huge deal. The Lemon Pepper ones were under Seasoned, The Thai Curry hinted at that peanut type flavor, and the Teriyaki was just slathered in the sauce....The Mango Habenero were just right and I devoured them. It was a lot more food than I expected-I ate about 30 pieces before I had to undo a belt notch. lol   The beers were nice and ice cold and they have a decent selection, though I think our total time there was about 2 and a half hours, but the service in between items could've probably been sped up a little bit.  All in all, not the best, not the worst, but a great place to b.s. with a friend and catch up with the standard Sports Bar feel. I'll probably come back on one of the wing specialty nights with some friends. Like I said, some of the server girls were smokin hot with those black football lines under their eyes.   Hope you like my review! Cheers!  ~Mb",

After awhile all the sauce tasted too tangy. We couldn't even finish. I had an email coupon for a free snack size. The waitress forgot to put that on the ticket. We had to wait a really long time for the waitress to find her manager to add the coupon to the bill. Needless to say we were still hungry later.... Definitely should have gone somewhere else....",

My fiance wanted chicken strips so I pulled up BWW on my Yelp app. I'm a fan of hot wings and BWW in general. I like the atmosphere and sitting in the bar area is always a best bet for quick and friendly service typically.  We sat in the bar and we were quickly greeted by our waitress, who was talkative and nice. She asked me about my tattoo and we discussed local tattoo parlors as well. So for service I am going to say 5 stars for our waitress, but I can't remember her name.  Next is food. Normally I order either boneless wings or normal wings. It's kind of a no-brainer. I mean, you are coming to BWW. But their potato wedges are really good too. On this visit I had a cheeseburger and let me tell you why. You see, there are a lot of fancy-schmancy burger places around town that will make you a burger with different types of sauces and rubs. They'll charge you an arm and a leg for them too. At BWW you can add any wing sauce or wing rub to your burger. Maybe the burger isn't top-notch quality, BUT you are getting a very interesting burger combo for a much cheaper price than at a burger joint that will upcharge you for EVERYTHING.  I got my burger cooked with the chipotle rub and it was delicious. I also asked for a small container of the chipotle rub to sprinkle on my french fries - so good too. You also get a selection of cheeses at BWW and I tend to go with the pepperjack cheese for an extra kick.   So, it does pay to take a look at the menu at a place even if they are well known for a certain type of food. I'm sure I'll be back for the wings eventually.",

Way to go MICHELLE ! For showing us what True customer service is all about.  Our drinks were NEVER empty.  She checked on us often, and tended to us quickly.  And Always with a smile.  She even remembered the little things we asked for, like random marinara for my friend who eats weird combinations Lol!  She is a keeper for sure. The whole table gave her an AAA+++  We were absolutely impressed.   On a different note, Food here is always delicious,  Buffalo Wild Wings is always a great place to grab a bite to eat with friends or family etc.  The dining room is always pretty clean, staff is always friendly, and servers are decent. (MICHELLE IS THE BEST)   Favorites for me are Mango Habanero Wings, Fried Pickles, Mac N' Cheese and their Street Tacos, oh and their Seasonal /Temporary items are usually pretty delicious, so don't be afraid to try something new !  Hands down a great BDUBS location.",

    "text": "This Buffalo Wild Wings just has to get it together... I really try to give some businesses the benefit of doubt when I see how low the star ratings are, however I believe that if several people who don't know each other all have the same experience it's not them it's YOU! Whether it's management or not I just don't know where to start or who I should be giving some constructive coaching to. The most recent experience I had earlier this week with my co-workers was just meh. For starters we were quoted a wait time for a table that ended up in fact actually doubling. Once we were seated one of the team leads/shift managers came over to introduce himself and another server which whom he explained would also be helping him. That wasn't the case though because we never saw her again until after he left. When it came to getting drinks ordered we all browsed through the menu of cocktails and I decided on one of their \"top shelf\" long islands. Now I am a long island drinker and so is my co-worker who actually ordered the same thing. When our drinks arrived I could already tell that my drink was not made how it was suppose to be. The color of a long island shouldn't look like water with a hint of brown. Anyways we sipped our drinks and of course all you could taste was the sour mix. I brought this to the attention of the server and even asked is this a pre-made mix drink or an actual hand made pour from the bartender. He replied \"No it's made fresh\" I beg to differ.. I know the difference, I sent it back with no desire to order anything else from the bar because it was evident whoever was working that night didn't know what they were doing. When the drink situation was solved and we moved on to our food order now that's when I felt things would be better. After our tables wings were dropped off I again noticed that another request wasn't fulfilled which was to have my wings tossed in extra sauce, they brought out just extra sauce and pretty much said pour it on it's the same thing. Already annoyed I was like whatever about the whole meal and ready to just go. When the bill came again there was an issue there because the manager who at first was our server who now was off didn't properly promo our wings for the Tuesday wing special smh. Get me outta here I won't be back.. I'll stick to the Warm Springs/Durango location or Hualapai in my area.. You would think with this location being so close to the strip that the service would be tip top and not as spotty...",

    "text": "Was really contemplating on writing this review but a lot of people I've spoken to about it insist that I really do because the treatment and blatant disrespect as well as other feelings shouldn't be given out to any other potential customer. I came to this location on Friday around 6PM for the NBA finals game 4, I had my friend with me, who is visiting. We sat at the bar which had two bartenders, older male with gray hair, another male with a full beard, both occupied at the time we sat around a few empty seats. Felt we were seen but I dismissed it in my head and gave him a pass I'm sure it's been busy maybe he's getting a small break, let him finish his conversation with the other bartender. I don't demand service the minute I'm seen I know how work can be so I am a fair person. Then to the left of me two guys came, few shades lighter than me...yeah I am a darker individual as well as my female friend that was with me, but I'm doubting that has anything to do with anything and then the older bartender turns around and starts walking across the bar and picks up two menus. He has to walk by us to give them the menus, they are directly next to me, as he walks by I ask him \"Hey excuse me could I get a menu please?\" He acted like he didn't hear me then leaned over to the guys to assist them, their faces were in shock and I asked them if I can see their menu right in front of that bartender since he doesn't want to help us it seemed. He continued to take their order and act like he didn't see us come in first, like he didn't see/hear me ask him for a menu, and as if he didn't just stand there ignore me and watch me ask the customer whom he just gave the menu to for their menu. The customer said something to him regarding us and he ignored that too, then the bartender gets their beers and comes to my friend and I and asks \"what can he do for us?\"...Not even an apology or yet just a lie like at least to justify the total disrespect he gave, I told him I'm fine and if the other bartender can assist us, but no...now that bartender goes and does his own thing and just stays across the bar away from us, we still sit quietly and just maybe because we were in shock we're getting this type of treatment. The bartender with the beard still hasn't come around and it's been more than 20mins, a new customer comes in and I see the bartender with the beard walk over and gladly assist. Since my friend formerly was a restaurant manager before she decided to get the store manager. The manager, a female with a single ponytail, comes and pretty much makes excuses for her bartenders behavior, I understand you want to have your teammates back but what's wrong is wrong, and with soooo much hate going on right now in these times I felt like the last thing you would want to do is defend something that is seemingly close of that nature, especially in such an establishment like Buffalo Wild Wings. We are telling you as a manager how disrespectful and shocked we are feeling and as a manager you're going to say \"oh he didn't see you\", I didn't say much until that point because I let my friend talk calmly with the manager being that they should be able to relate coming from the same fields, however that was not the case. When the manager denied that he saw us then I asked well what about when I tried to get his attention as he walked in front of me? And i asked him? The manager is lying to us on his behalf like we're not some 30 year olds and are some 7 year old kids that just experienced this total disrespect. As my friend decided to just ask how can we fix this because the manager clearly was accepting this behavior and fine with it, the manager lets us know \"YOU CAN GO SOMEWHERE ELSE IF YOU DONT LIKE WHATS GOING ON HERE\" and my friend said really? As a manager and you as customer this is what you're going to say to me? And the manager repeated herself, for the record we did not get belligerent or make any noise so we left looking embarrassed as if we were in the wrong for visiting while everyone else seems to be getting taken care of equally, if my money is no good at this location and I can't receive equal service because then fine I'll definitely go elsewhere like the manager said but only elsewhere to escalate this situation to a higher manager so that nobody else experiences this in 2018 because it truly was not right for employees to give the Buffalo Wild Wings brand this outlook.",

    "text": "This was my first time eating at Buffalo Wild Wings. I was so excited to try them for the first time from what I have been told by other people and pictures/videos of other people who have had it before. The moment we got there, we weren't even greeted. When I enter a store or dine in restaurant, I expect to be greeted the moment I walk through the door. We ordered 20 boneless wings and waited longer than 30 minutes to be served. We ordered 4 different flavors of wings and they arrived all on the same tray not even separated so we couldn't tell which was what or what to give to our child. We looked around and everyone had their wings separated into different trays/paper bowls. We also asked for the wings to be extra wet and when we got our wings, they were dry and looked like they've been out for a while. Took the first bite of one of the wings and it was so hard that it hurt our teeth. Same as all the other wings. Way too dry and hard. Everyone else's wings looked fresh and soft and ours looked like it was taken from the trash or leftovers and just given to us. We also got celery and carrots and they gave us THREE CARROTS AND TWO CELERY STICKS. Really? How cheap can you get? Looking at the other pictures on here, people got way more than what we got. (a few complaining they got the same amount as, as well). I would never go back to this restaurant ever again with my kids or family and I would let everybody know to go eat at wing stop because I never had to complain about wingstop in my life.",

    "text": "When my friends said they wanted to meet up here I was already against it. It didn't stop me from hoping they'd gotten better as a plus they had 50% off wings. The bartender was quick and nice and after putting in the order of 10 wings it went downhill.  The wings took 20 minutes!!! They came out warmed over and they weren't even tossed in sauce, they were drizzled with hot sauce. The person who delivered them rudely reached between me and my friend instead of delivering them on the other side of me. The wings weren't anything special- 8 wing segments and 2 drumsticks for me it kept getting worse and worse. It made me wonder where the heck are the drumsticks and are they scooping from a bin of cooked wings. The check took another 10-15 minutes and we were looking right at the bartender during happy hour, first we had to flag him down to get us the check, then flag him down to run the credit card and cash, then flag him down to get change. It's a hassle all around even eating at this place. During our long wait the manager decided to come around and ask if we wanted to donate money for a charity and get a sticker on the wall. I was beyond passed at the insult!!!! We are already paying for the food why don't you use the profits from that expensive drinks and wings and stop badgering your patrons!   BWW has always been on the cusp of going under. They have no one to blame, but themselves.",

My server was Doris and she was nice but I honestly felt like our table wasn't taken care of as much as we should have been such as refills and when we we trying to taste test the sauces, we were given sauces we didn't want to taste. It's something small but I feel like it shouldn't have been something to slip up on.  The wings here are pretty good. I got the Asian zing and Parmesan garlic on my wings. The food took a really long time for it to come out tho so it kind of made me irritated. And we didn't even order that much nor was it that busy.   Anyways, I gave it 3 stars because I thought the service could have been way better but since the food was pretty satisfying, I don't want to rate it as if it's a place to not go to. I would go here again but I would definitely like a different server next time. No offense to Doris if that's how she does her customer service but it wasn't to my liking.",

I arrived at the restaurant 15 minutes later and paid for my order AFTER I paid I was told it would be a wait because the were backed up on bone less wings.  I was in a hurry (which is why I placed a take out order!) so I told the young lady who was helping me that if the order would take a lot longer I would need to get a refund because I was in a big rush I had an appointment with a wedding planner.   She went to check on the wings and didn't come back until my order was ready and she had it in her hand it took and additional 15 minutes but there was no one around to cancel the order with so I waited. When I revived the order the young lady just handed it to me. She didn't check it with me so I checked it in the car it was complete however the entire bag was sticky and gross with sauce every where all the boxes had sauce on them! Worst experience I have had at a Buffalo Wild Wings.   Besides my experience the restroom was gross. There were at least 20-30 people waiting to be seated which were all told 10-15 minutes to be seated(there was no way that was happening) along with other people frustratingly waiting for their own take out orders. It was just irritating to deal with the staff here they act like they don't see you sometimes and walk away or they hide in the kitchen.",

We ordered a basket of several types of wings and asked for the trivia games to play with. The wings and coleslaw were super delicious. The games were fun to play and the beer was good.   It was a surprise as to how much I enjoyed my two hours here. The space is large clean with many large TVs on the surrounding walls.",

My favorites are Mango Habenero (spicy), Wild (spicy) , Caribbean Jerk (medium) and Teriyaki (mild) Spicy Garlic (medium) is also pretty good.  The chips with cheese and cajun seasoning is delicious.  I almost always sit at the bar and the bartenders are great. Dani and Michelle are my favorites, but the guys on weekend swing and grave are always great too.",

We were greeted by a less than happy bartender almost as if we were inconveniencing him Because he couldn't stay on his phone and had to come greet us.    2. Food came out fast, a little to fast. Our boneless wings were older than me and had to be sent back.   3. The worst part of all the bathroom. One word FOUL. Smelled like a sewer ate a fart and then farted. Literally worse than a state fair Porta-potty. There was toilet paper all over the place and, feces covered baby wipes all over.   It was absolutely the worst experience I have ever had at a Buffalo Wild Wings and I can guarantee I will NEVER RETURN. Heed my warning and avoid this place. If the bathroom was that bad and they don't care enough to clean it, god only knows what the kitchen looks like. I would put money on the bet they don't even wear gloves.  Steer clear.",

However, this morning has been the worst experience I've ever had. Gordon in the bar served my boyfriend and I. He first began giving us attitude when I told him as he rang us up that our order was to go. He never asked us before hand he just assumed we would be eating there. I asked if I could have carrots while we waited for the food to get ready he said ok, but, upon arrival with the carrots I was told in a nasty tone that I would not receive carrots with my food. I was ok with that, I just didn't like the in which he approached the situation. I politely asked a server for ranch dressing and he just walked off and came back a few minutes later and slid the dressing in front of me. When the food was finally brought to us, my boyfriend attempted to hand Gordon his card but Gordon just walked off. I don't know what's up in the early am but don't go to the bar",

I called to order at 8pm, got there early (around 8:20) so me & my bf say \"we're early so we can eat here real quick\" we let the server who greeted us at the front know we had ordered ahead of time but wanted to see if we could eat here. He told us we can go to the bar for open seating and that he will get someone for us to help us out with our food. We sat by the bar for about 30min without anyone checking in on us but giving us weird looks so my boyfriend went to go ask the guy again and he was really rude and told him he doesn't know why we stayed seated when he had told us to pay for our food first. Which was not at all what he had told us when we arrived or else we would've done what he said. He passed us plenty of times & saw us sitting there he didn't even bother to ask if we have been helped yet. We got our food at 8:50, COLD with barely any time to eat since our movie was at 9pm. Our fries with Queso were cold and dry since they were sitting around the whole time we were waiting. Totally ruined our date night. Never been disappointed with servers at BWW until last Sunday night.",

If you're anything like me you are a spice head (as in the heat factor lol not the fake drugs)! I like my wings crispy and spicy. I ordered the mango habenro and hot bbq, all flat and extra crispy. Not chicken jerky tho. I find that if i don't get xtra crispy the wings come out undercooked! This place is ok for the location and always packed. If your looking to order over the phone.. Good luck. Overall ok food quality, not like the one on Craig and Commerce. Thats the best one.",

    "text": "I use to love this location but it seems to have gone down hill lately. I've been there 3 times within the last month and there's always been something wrong during each visit.  1st visit was during night time like past midnight type of thing. Sat at the bar order just a soda and was gambling. Finished my soda and I was never asked if I wanted a refill or something else to drink. After about $60 bucks in I finally paid for my one soda and left  2nd visit was late in the evening with my family. We were sat down right away which surprised me cause it was Sunday and the games were on. Everything was going good until it came time for our food. Ordered mini corn dogs to start the kids off and about 10mins later they inform us that they ran out. No big deal happens but then I ordered a bacon burger and another 10 minutes later we get informed that they are out of bacon. Alright not a happy guy but not upset. I switch to there chicken sandwich instead and I get my food and the chicken is chewy. We got a quesadilla and hardly any cheese on the inside. It was a waste of $50 honestly for our dinner.  3rd visit was me alone during lunch hour. I sit down, gamble $20, order a soda and then try to order a bacon burger but am told they don't have just a bacon burger. That all they have is a bacon cheese burger. I ask the bartender if it's possible to order and pay the price of the bacon cheese burger and just have no cheese on it. I'm told no that it has to be as it is in the menu. Ok so I go with that and order it. I finish my soda and literally see people sit around me order drinks and food and pay and my soda is still haven't been refilled or I haven't been asked if I want something else to drink. I put my empty cup towards the edge and still nothing. It is not until I am done with my food and ask for the bill that I am offered a refill!   Like really took you that long to ask me? I work as a bartender and a soda refill takes 10-20seconds! Now person behind the bar might be thinking since I'm not drinking that I will not tip good so maybe that's why I don't get service but I know how it is behind the bar so I always tip $10 even if all I getting is a simple soda.   So to end this review, bar service sucks as a refill is almost impossible to get. Don't go on Sundays cause apparently they run out of everything. This place was great but service is horrible now and I don't see why cause it's always busy so employees are making there money here.",

The chicken salad entree is pretty unimpressive with a few tiny cubes of chicken but it was expected with the price point. The buffalo chips as my side were decent except I asked for buffalo seasoning and didn't receive it. The meal at this point was 3 stars, they lost another star after a water cup was spilled onto my hair and back and all over my chair. The server was apologetic, as were management but that's all. I didn't make a huge deal of it although I did have to return to work with a wet back and wet hair... but I did expect some sort of discount off the check? No discount just an apology.",

    "text": "This was my first time at a Buffalo Wild Wings and I was taken aback by two things:  the quality of the food and the business model.  Food Quality:  Three of the four of us ordered wings.  The bone in wings tasted like they had been prepared several hours ago, then sauced for the order.  The boneless were a bit better, but had so much \"stuff\" surrounding the chicken it was hard to eat.  It tasted like a processed product.  The mild sauce tasted like Frank's Red-Hot, and the Asian Chile was fairly good.  The cole-slaw was awful.  The cabbage mix was actually good, but it was drowning in a very peculiar, non cole-slaw like sauce.  My 16 year old son who has been to several BWWs said this food is indicative of what he has previously experienced.  The Business Model:  Low quality food with endless sauce options with a mid-range dining price served picnic style (paper boats) in a sports themed atmosphere.  Aiming at the 18-40 year old middle class male crowd is my guess.  The success of this franchise amazes me.  Summary:  No reason to ever go back.....",

Normally at this location, my family and I sit in the dining area and usually have Jasmine or Amanda as our servers and have a WONDERFUL experience.   Food at BWW is for the most part always great. Understandably, if gets busy especially during game times little things can get missed.   Today I came with a couple of co-workers on our lunch break, arrived at 10:05AM dining room was not open yet so we proceeded to the bar where only 1 other table was taken. Elijah said hello from across the room, and he would be right with us.  He came over and asked for ID's and we tried to start ordering, since we're on a short schedule and we're regulars, we already know what we want. He took only our drink orders and said he would be back. 10:15ish he finally came back to take our order. During the wait for the food, we witnessed a lady try to make a takeout order with him and ended up walking out because she wasn't helped in a timely manner, listened to our server complain that he's getting stares from other customers because they have not been helped yet, and his words were, \"It's not my fault they decided to sit in the bar instead of the dining room where servers are available to help them out.\" WHAT?! I mean we all talk crap. Anyways 10:43 our food FINALLY arrives at this point we asked for checks and to-go boxes since we had no time left to even eat there.   I took a bite of one of my wings, and automatically knew that my order was wrong. I let him know and he took my order back to the kitchen and asked them to change it. Instead of changing it, I was told that my order is actually correct and labeled correctly. (I ordered the BBQ mashup with Mango Habanero and BBQ Sauce.) The wings were way too spicy, which is why I stopped ordering Mango Habanero in the first place. I was given the option to change my order, \"but it will take about as long as it took to get to you in the first place.\" ANOTHER fail, today I just couldn't win.   Unfortunately, I did not have time to speak to a manager right then and there - so I took the number as I walked out and dialed on the way out. The young lady that answered knew exactly who I was, (she witnessed the whole situation) and said she would pass along the info to the manager and encouraged me to call back at 2 pm. At the moment all of the managers were running around and did not have a second to talk.  UPDATE; I called at 2, still no one available. I called 2 days later still nothing. 18 days and still no response from anyone.",

Sat with a large party but I was the only one who didn't get a drink, didn't help the fact I hadn't eaten anything all day so I had to grab an extra water from someone else.  I ordered a chocolate cake to come after my meal, but for some reason like 20 minute's after everyone was done I didn't get my cake.  We had to leave to the airport so didn't even have time to get he cake in a to go box.  Really bad service from the girl in red hair, not a fun time. I'm usually pretty lenient when it comes to restaurants given I worked in some myself but at the point where customers are getting neglected and I was literally about to pass out from lack of food or water WHILE inside of a restaurant, you really fail to meet even the bare minimum standards for a restaurant.",

This last visit we just got up and left after sitting 10 minutes in a empty restaurant waiting to be seated then another 15 minutes at a table with no water and zero attention while 10 workers sat around talking to eachother..

It took so long to get our food we didn't get it till 2:20! She apologized for the wait but unfortunately the wings looked like they were sitting under the heat lamp for a while. We asked them to fix them and when they came back they were cold so sent them back again..   About 2 min later I saw 1 black male cook and 2 servers come out of the kitchen and stared us down! This is what sent me over the edge. You know they were talking about us and wanted to see who we were so I went to the manager and confronted her and told her how I saw that and how unprofessional it was especially since we are both in the service industry I told her I want her to make sure our food is not being messed with!  The manager gave us a fresh new order which was great my boyfriend worked at Buffalo Wild Wings knows the sauces and noticed when we left that he mouth was even more on fire then normal he order Wild with another sauce mixed in.. he strongly believes and knows that they added like a squirt of blazin in it because he mouth has a strong tingle for the longest time...   We are very upset that this happened and we won't be coming back...   As for the server she apologized but you noticed after it all she wasn't being sincere and was being fake towards us since that happened!",

I suspect someone accidently put the pepper shaker's lid on the salt shaker. Our waitress offered to replace it. Yay! The manager brought it out and wandered around the dining room, looking awfully confused. When I waved him over he apologized and told me the waitress had told him it was for a child, not a child sized adult.. Not quite so yay, but I'll take it as a compliment.... Btw, I'm 32.. At least the mac and cheese was good!   The menu doesn't indicate how many wings you get, so here it is.   You can get traditional or boneless fried wings. Snack is 5, small is 10, you get the idea. It's all in increments of 5. Your wings do not include a side, which I found a little annoying.",

The food here was okay, my wings were broken and having shards of bone stick out of your food is not appetizing to say the least.  The cheesecake bites were great!  The review is mostly for the service, which was for lack of a better word TERRIBLE.  The waitress sauntered over while chewing gum, as if she was doing us a favor, and took our orders but did not write anything down.  She had to ask a few times for us to repeat it, while still getting the drink wrong.  Mind you there are only two of us, so it should not have been such a feat.  Our orders came out wrong, wrong side dish but we did not mention anything at that point as to not have to deal with it anymore. Overall, she seemed more focused on serving groups of guys seated all around then any other customer.",

He talks to us and is always attentive with us. But last night we sat in a regular table by the bar. We got the WORST server, I don't know his name but he was black and bald. We sat down and and he popped up and didn't even say hi. He just said \"ID's PLEASE!\" Well hi to you too buddy. We were indecisive and told him to give us more time, but as every time he'd stop by to see if we were ready, we'd say no and he''d walk off frustrated. Then finally one of my coworkers wanted to order a burger. He says, \"Im just letting you know the meat is frozen and the burgers don't taste good.\" Uhhhh okay? So then we asked for more time, again, he got more frustrated. Then a friend showed up and she forgot her ID. So he got even more defensive saying she needs to go. BLAH BLAH. At that point I asked for the check since I had ordered an appetizer and left him a dollar. Sounds petty, but I work in the service industry too, I don't know how you make money with that stink ass attitude.",

I loved this...until they told us happy hour had ended.  No bueno.  We had drinks which were good, we ordered Mozzerella sticks which were also good, and then the traditional wings came.. they were SO dry and barely any sauce on them.  Our friend got boneless and they were perfectly sauce and had so much flavor!  We didn't complain as it was busy however I did ask for a side of sauce.  I love BWW however I think I will stick to my Eastern location which has GREAT service and GREAT food.",

Our waiter was very nice and he even suggested a good flavor for our wings. All the food was very very good. Warning though their hot wings are HOT lol very hot. I could not finish more then one.

    "text": "After a private party at Commonwealth, my best friend and I decided to come down to BWW for some grub to soak up the alcohol.  This location is open all night and centrally located in the same parking lot as the Las Vegas Outlet center.    Definitely your standard BWW.  The front part of the restaurant is a dinning room for families.  The back part is a huge bar, decorated with lots of big screen TVs for game watching.  Along side the bar are bar top tables, which we decided to sit at.  Our server was also the bartender and pleasant to work with.   I slipped him my card at the beginning so I could pay for the meal and he caught the hint, took the card from under the table and did a great job keeping it a secret from my bestie.    For our meal, we started with the Mozzarella sticks for $6.49 and mini corn dogs for $5.79.  The mozzarella sticks crispy and perfectly breaded on the outside, and gooey mozzarella goodness on the inside.  The marinara dipping sauce made the stick taste like a good cheese pizza!  The corn dogs were literally bite sized hush puppy goodness.  The corn bread batter wasn't overpowering the dog.  There was a dipping sauce for this as well, mustard I think.  It made the corn dogs delicious!  I also decided to get the small boneless wings containing 10 boneless wings.  Parmesan Garlic was my flavor choice.  I liked the wing.  It was battered and super crunchy.  The Parmesan Garlic, on the other hand, was not as good as the actual wing.  It was too tangy and super salty.  It seemed like the wing was drenched in that sauce and very overpowering.  I was not a fan, to be honest.    Football season is coming up, so you know I'll be at BWW at least couple more times during the season.  I love the service, I love the food, maybe just a different choice of sauce upon my return.  Love the central location and that means a bright future for me and BWW!",

Don't judge!  Anyway, my friend and I came in here the other night around 1am with a wing-craving so strong it ached in our bellies.  The bar area was open and it wasn't super busy.  Our server was great so we got beers right away.  We ordered 18 wings and did half spicy garlic, which is the only sauce I've ever had there, and also medium.  I couldn't really tell the difference between the two sauces, to be honest.    It's True that they are not the best wings as they are quite a bit on the scrawny side, but they hit the spot all the same, as they always do.  They are also SUPER salty and it can get to be way too much, but wash it down with some beer to cancel out the high salt content and you're golden.",

I've tried other flavors but I don't think any really compare to that. I'm not really a big spicy person either. Plenty of big screens to watch sports on but I don't really come here for sports. It can get really busy when a big game is on or any game for that matter.   The service is pretty much a hit or miss here. You either get good or bad service and I have gotten both here at this location. This place is near where I work and it is definitely a good place to grab lunch. They have good lunch specials going on. I do also like that if you do have a late night wing craving you can go to BWW.",

This specific location was one of the worst dining experiences I've ever had, especially the worst BWW experience.  Upon arriving shortly before 11pm, the dining room was empty with no servers around. Stepping to the bar area revealed some life, my lady and I took a seat at an empty table. It took only a few seconds to get some service, so that was a plus. The staff however looked sloppy. They in no way attempted to be friendly or make you feel comfortable. The two bartenders were moving around constantly, while a server or two would either be standing around or serving food. Our particular server was a mess, had no emotion and was in no rush to get anything done.   The only saving grace was that the food actually came out quite well. Not much of a saving grace to be honest. After finishing our meals, it took 10 minutes to get noticed so we could grab a check. We waited another 10 to actually receive it, and at least 5 more after giving my debit card to get it back. At this point only the two bartenders were working. I looked around for a server to ask for some lids for our sauce. This proved to be a tough process, considering there was no one around for minutes until a supervisor looking person stepped out from the back and FINALLY grabbed one for us.   There are many better BWWs around Vegas, I don't recommend this one at all.",

    "text": "I have never eaten in this place and decided to give it a try last night. The first thing I want to commend is the service. Well, at least the person who took our order and kept our ice water and soda flowing.   I ordered the Mango Habanero wings and a basket of Salt and Vinegar fries. Incredible! The wings were delicious, cooked perfect and though hot very, very enjoyable. The fries actually were mixed with some lemon spice too, so they were lemon, salt and vinegar. Even though we actually ordered the spice on the side the kitchens mistake in mixing the spices made a very delicious basket of fries. Yum!!!!  I'd definitely go here again.",

    "text": "DANGER DANGER WILL ROBINSON! Buffalo Wild Wings does $9.99 all you can eat traditional and $10.99 boneless wings on Mondays-Fridays from 11-2. Not only do you get wings, but you also get the choice of fries, wedges, or buffalo chips. For an additional dollar, you can upgrade to onion rings.  Waking up to a text from Kristina D. at 9:30am about this magnificent deal, I jumped at the chance. After doing the math and feeling the gastrointestinal ramifications; come here on Monday, Wednesday, or Friday for the deal. On Tuesday, you can eat 20 wings for about the same price. If you can't eat that many, just do the $0.49 special. I know that AYCE includes a side, but they are just filler to distract you.  Even though the place was packed, the service is still as efficient as it normally is. They are quick with the delivery of wings and the refills on drinks are consistent.",

    "text": "Came here to watch the spicey buffalo wing challenge! Only one yelper was brave enough to take on the challenge: My T and he completely owned it! Congratualtions!  As for the restaurant, \"ehhh,\" is about all I can say. I am not a huge fan of buffalo wings to begin with. We came during happy hour, so .45 cent wings, food and drink specials were great. Multiple wing sauces also kept things interesting. But, beyond that, there was nothing specal about this, or any other Buffalo Wild Wings (I asuume). A large bar area (equal in size to the dining area) with multiple prejection tvs airing ESPN 1 through infinity, trivia games running on smaller tvs. All the stereotypical sports bar accrutrements.  Our server I think was overwhelmed, it could have been quicker and friendlier. She was nice and efficient enough to split the check up for us, so that was a plus!",

    "text": "We came in around 11pm on a Tuesday. We wanted to eat in the bar area but all the tables were filthy so I asked the hostess to just seat us. When we got to our table, it took forever for our server to greet us. I had a gut feeling that we may not see her again for a long time so when she took our drinks, we placed our order for wings and fries. The hostess who seated us brought our wings out but with no napkins and forgot the fries. She kind of just set the food down and left so we decided we'd wait for our server to get the missed items. And my gut feeling was right; our server had completely disappeared. She wasn't even busy with other tables. She was just gone. We finally got our napkins and fries and our glasses refilled after waiting ten minutes. When we were ready for the check, she was nowhere to be found yet again. Needless to say when she presented the check I wasted no time paying so we could get out of there asap.   I've eaten here before and from what I can remember, the service wasn't this bad. So instead of just one star, I'll give two since I can't recall anything terrible from previous visits. After tonight though, I'll be avoiding this location.",

    "text": "Wing Tuesdays are the way to go! They have a promotion on Tuesdays where you can get traditional wings at a discount. The wings here blow everyone else out of the water. They have a variety of flavors that cater to everyone! I really like how they have their flavors on a spicy meter so you know what level of spice you're getting yourself into.  My favs: -Salt and Vinegar (dry rub that has a punch of flavor) -Mango Habanero (a must try if you like spicy) -Asian Zing (mildly spicy, but full of flavor) -Parmesan Garlic -Spicy Garlic  I've had a few others that were good, but these are the ones that have stood out to me.",

I say one round because that's all we were given the chance to order. Half of the food we ordered was wrong when we got that. And instead of offering to fix it our server started explaining how she can't get us something else because she \"already entered it into the computer and would have to charge us for the correct order\". Yes really! So we say whatever and eat what she brings. At the end of the meal my girlfriend asks for coffee and was told \" I don't feel like cleaning the machine to make a new pot\". Yep. So we wait for our check. And wait. Flag someone down so we can ask about paying and finally get our server to come out of the back. She comes out, makes a comment about \"didn't eat very much\" to my friend who didn't even get what she ordered and proceeds to grab one of her wings and eat it. Yep, eat it. They says \"these are good you should have had more\". Blown away. Amazed. Disgusted. This was horrible. Writing this is greater detail for the Vegas newspaper. Just, wow.",

    "text": "Is Blazin' really as hot as it gets here? I don't know if I've developed some iron palate or whether it's the suits at corporate telling them that anything spicier will scare off the middle America fanny packer crowd. But that's their hottest sauce, and while it's got a robust flavor, it just doesn't come anywhere near the kind of heat I crave as the kind of capsaicin addict who's not satisfied until... well, the less said about that the better.  My point is, if you're going to be a wing place, give people a chance to really challenge their taste buds. I think even Hooters' 3 Mile Island is hotter.  That being said, I also love the Caribbean Jerk sauce even though it's barely hot at all - it's not supposed to be. The Spicy Garlic is more vinegar-based, tangy in such a way that sometimes seems more aggressive than the Blazin'. As for the Asian Zing? I didn't think it had much zing at all, it just tasted sweet. I was hoping for more soy/sesame based but I think it's more sweet & sour. Pass. Mango Habanero: could taste lots of mango, barely any habanero. Alsop ass.  The \"buffalo chips\" suffer from the same starchy, wan fate as your average steak fry.  BWW gains points for being open 24/7/365, which is nothing notable in this town until you consider that it's a buffalo wing place, and for having a staff that's always friendly. They also offer free wi-fi.  I go here all the time because it's close and convenient moreso than because it's great. But it's good enough. Probably more like 3.5 stars, but of course Yelp doesn't give that option.",

I have to give three stars because of the service. The server asked us if we wanted to play trivia when she took the drink order. She only brought my drink which was regular instead of diet, forgot my daughters altogether and never brought the trivia devices. The food took forever to get to the table and never asked us if we needed refills on drinks. So in conclusion food was good but service was lacking. I probably will go to BWW again but not to this location",
