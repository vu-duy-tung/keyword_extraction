    "text": "We went here for my wife's birthday on Thursday November 3rd and had an unpleasant experience. That was the fourth time we have been to Ventano's and enjoyed the atmosphere until that night. We had a group 9 (family that surprised us from California) with two children to include an infant. As dinner was winding down and moving into getting desert, my father in law picked up my infant and walked him close to the kitchen to take a peek. We all know how baby's can be. Then as I'm returning from the restroom about to take my seat, one of the employees (not a waiter) wearing a white long sleeve bringing food out obnoxiously says \"somebody better tell that guy (my father in law holding my baby) to get away from the glass (that separates the kitchen from the dining area) because that's $15,000!\" The whole table heard him and immediately made a memorable night for my wife and family turn sour. There is a way to politely tell us to not have them close to the \"treasured\" Ventano glass and we would have gladly directed my father in law away from there. I do not care if that piece is worth 15k and just disgusted by your employee's demeanor. We immediately payed the bill and left. Not impressed at all.",

    "text": "Nice place for Italian.  We (party of 3) arrived on a Saturday night sans a reservation, which wasn't a problem but there was a 25 minute wait.  We waited in the bar area, which, sadly, was very smokey.  My friend and I had a glass of the inexpensive pinot noir.  I forgot how weird it is to sit at a bar with video poker.  Thankfully, we were seated not too long after.  We ordered the bruschetta as an appetizer; it was okay but nothing to write home about.  The tomatoes tasted a bit bland.  They also serve complimentary bread sticks, which were good, but somewhat reminiscent of the Olive Garden.  The food was better.  Feeling somewhat adventurous, I ordered the Ventano tortellini (hey, my go-to is gnocchi).  It was pretty good; hot, cheesy, and very rich.  The pink sauce was a nice compliment.  For dessert, I had the tiramisu.  It was also pretty good but, truthfully, at this point, I was so stuffed that I didn't have much of it.  The restaurant itself is agreeable; spacious and nice decor.  The food was good but I'm not sure that, if I wasn't already in the area, I'd go out of my way to go back again.",

    "text": "I've been attending trade shows in Las Vegas for about 40 years, and have tried on- and off-strip restaurants from one end to the other; some good, some quite bad.  On the occasion of the recent CES show, my wife and I took a side trip to Henderson, mostly to see the Ethel M. Chocolate Factory.  Her GPS found Ventano around dinnertime and we gave it a try.  The meals we had were, by far, among the best (if not THE best) we have had anywhere near Vegas.  Well worth the 20 minutes or so it takes to get there from the convention area.  The menu is well-rounded, the conceptualization of the dishes challenges perfection, and the food is... well, superb.  Service was 'young but pleasant,' and the view of the sun setting over the strip, and over the mountains beyond, was, itself, worth the visit.  The wine list was surprisingly good for a neighborhood restaurant; one of our favorite Zins was on it.  Well done Mr. Briand!",

Not to be picky, but they serve breadsticks rather than real bread, and that made me feel like I was at Fazoli's. I think it would serve them well to have \"real\" fresh Italian bread. I do like the fact that I always bring home leftovers when I eat here!   The service was mediocre at best. I typically just drink water, and I think they forgot that I needed refills, because I had to ask more than once.   This is a good place for a date as it has a nice, romantic ambience.",

Everything everyone eats around me makes my mouth water, but the bolognese keeps me happy. It really is that good.  I went to a beer dinner at Ventano recently. It was a blast. They offered a free ride home to anyone that tried all the beer.  Portions are large. Great wine list. Service is always great. They have a rewards card, so be sure to ask for that.

We were even able to get a table next to a large window with a great view of valley.  Our waitress was friendly and explained the menu and specials with much happiness.  We started off with the \"Arancine\" risotto bals stuffed with peas, beef and cheese..delicious.  I ate the \"Francese\" chicken which was lightly sauteed in egg batter and parmesan and covered in a lemon butter sauce. I gave up bread but because everything was so damn tasty, I even ate it.

    "text": "If romance is part of your agenda, you can't go wrong with adding Ventano to your list.   This restaurant is tucked away in a clean and quiet neighborhood in Henderson. There's a large parking lot next to the restaurant building but the entrance is on the other side of the parking lot next to the gas station. It's dimly lit with large windows surrounding the entire restaurant. You can request to sit out on the patio - I would recommend this if the weather permits.   The view from the patio is quite breathtaking. I've been here during the day and at night. Come during the night time to see an amazing view of the lights of Vegas.   The food is alright. Not the best, but satisfying. I thought it was neat how they served their bread in a paper bag and not on a plate or a basket. Their portions are large and filling. During my last visit, I had the Lobster Ravioli for $24.50. The ravioli is topped with three ginormous pieces of blackened shrimp and is paired with some grilled asparagus. It was good, although I didn't really get a punch of lobster flavor from the ravioli. The shrimp was juicy and well seasoned and was definitely my favorite part of the dish. My friend ordered the Gnocchi con pesto. This was a disappointment. Not enough sauce. Gnocchi was dry and real chewy. Seems like it was sitting out for awhile.   I was contemplating for a minute on whether I should rate Ventano a 3 or a 4. My final decision is that Ventano is a 3.5 but they get the 4 on Yelp because of the beautiful view. If I'm ever around in that area, I wouldn't mind going back. Just have to remember to not order the gnocchi.",

    "text": "We came here awhile back for lunch. We came here b/c at the time It said that we would get a % off If we mentioned we saw this on Yelp. This is the specific reason we went there and had even heard of it.   I ordered the Puttanesca and my bf ordered a baked cheese something or another. His tasted great, mine was very bland. I wouldnt reorder this again. The breadsticks in the bag were good and garlicky but I cant eat them so it was more torture to just get a small nibble . . to know its good and not be able to eat it.. :(  Well here's where the deduction for the add'l 2 starts comes from: We asked for the check and mentioned we saw this on Yelp. He said he didnt know anything about it. Normally I'd just let this go but it was the way he spoke to us very condescending and I felt a little disrespected. I asked him if he had a manager (which I NEVER EVER do) he left and came back and said oh he's out for a little bit, I said ok, well can you call him?  yes... that was little ole me asking for the manager to be phoned. I said I didnt think it was right to advertise buy one get one 1/2 off  if you mention you saw it on Yelp and then take it back once you get people in. that's False advertising...   He came back and said he called the manager, and that he agreed to take off the discount which was probably no more than $6 or $7 at most. All that for $6.00, really? you're willing to risk losing a customers over that? well they must not be hurting if they can risk being rude. .   Would I come back? maybe, ok, let's be honest probably not likely considering there are sooo many places in LV and Henderson where I can spend my $.   They do have a nice view in the afternoon/night if you sit by the window. HOwever, I've also heard you get that same great view if you goto Lindo Michoacan. . .",

The pasta fagiola was either overcooked or left in the steam table too long, as the pasta was totally disintegrated... not to mention totally tasteless.  The severs were kind and apologetic.",

    "text": "Ate here on New Years Eve and our table was so far from anything you can call a view, so we decided to try again. We were seated as what was called the the best seat in the house-window side and it was really great. Finally! Now, I know what all the fuss is about! The view is spectacular!  I ordered a small green salad-I believe a restaurant is only as good as it's house dressing. And it was outstanding.  My husband ordered Tortellini Ventano-cheese tortellini, mushrooms and chicken in pink sauce and he loved it. Definitely would order again. Served piping hot-like usual. When I say piping, I mean this food is served so hot it takes awhile to cool down, so order another glass of wine and relax!  I ordered a combination of linguine with shrimp in a creamy, lemon garlic butter sauce and Ventano Spiedini-chicken cutlets, lightly breaded, stuffed with mozzarella & Parmesan, rolled and skewered. topped with pomodoro sauce. OUT OF THIS WORLD!!!! The shrimp scampi sauce was a bit to lemony, but it was really delicious. Those chicken cutlets were extraordinary. I can't imagine ever having a more delicious chicken dish at any restaurant. They serve the Spiedini as an entree which I would not hesitate to order, but I couldn't decide between a seafood dish and the chicken, so I opted for the combo. Was not disappointed and will return again and again and again!   The restaurant is nice with an open seating area and a level of elevated seating that looks like a great place to enjoy the view if you are not lucky enough to get a window seat. There is an outdoor patio which I bet is fabulous when it's not freezing cold! Can't wait to enjoy a meal out there!   This place has won me over and the service was equally as great! I can not say enough great things about this place!   So, I was right; in my first review I stated that the food is probably better--and prices too--if you sit at a table with a view. The food & the view totally play off eachother--is the view so wonderful cuz the food is great? Or is the food great cuz the view is so amazing? Who knows? Who cares?! I'm in!",

    "text": "I went there with my wife and was really concerned about salty food, bad service, high prices and other things mentioned in Yelp reviews.  Boy were they off-base.  Our server, Danielle, was great and let us order at our pace - though there was no real wait after giving the order.  She helped us through the menu looking for lower salt foods and made really good suggestions.I ordered the Risotto Pescadore and my wife the House Fillipino Special (chicken, shrimp, risotto and vegetables with some brown sugar effect.)  This after splitting a Warm Spinach Salad (split in the kitchen at no charge.)  My dish was a surprise since it was so loaded with clams, mussels and calamari swimming in a light tomato base sauce/soup to make it comparable with a Boullliabase from the south of France.  My wife loved her dish.  If there could be a complaint it was that the size of the serving was larger than either one of us could handle.  Next time we go through the courses and split each one.  Then the bill came and it was completely reasonable.  Surpise, Surprise after all the Yelp reviews calling this place expensive.  If you really think that then you should stick to the buffets and their steam tables or to fast food restaurants.  I think that Ventano's is something special.",

Even my three-year-old daughter ate it and she is a picky eater.  They served my daughter meatballs the size of her head and my lobster ravioli was amazing!  Pricing was reasonable; we will definitely be visiting Ventano's again! #yum",

Funny thing is, we live very close to this restaurant, but have never tried it for some odd reason.  I decided I was hungry for Italian last night and decided to give it a whirl.  I am somewhat of a picky diner and I have to tell you that I was thoroughly impressed with everything!  From walking in the front door with the friendly hostess, to being seated and taken care of by a very knowledgeable and friendly waiter (turns out that he was the General Manager).  He recommended several dishes to us, took the time to discuss and explain a dish to my 12 year old inquisitive son, and was generally outgoing and super friendly.  Food was exceptional - every dish that we got was amazing.  We ended the night withe Creme brulee and Spumoni cake for all of us to share and the creme brulee was to die for.  My only complaint is that I didn't find this restaurant much sooner as I can say that I will definitely be back - and SOON!  My new favorite spot!",

    "text": "In a few words: Great food, terrible service. I have been to Ventano three times now.  They have a lovely wine list, and all the food I or anyone in my party has ordered was delicious.  I especially recommend the Spiedini, which is an impossibly amazing \"What if they mated?\" love child of mozzerella sticks and chicken tenders.  NOMNOMNOM. The problem, and the reason I will not be going back, is the service.  It is simply incompetent.  The first time I went, we were not seated for 20 minutes, and later found out that the hostess completely forgot about us, EVEN THOUGH WE WERE STANDING RIGHT IN FRONT OF HER.  During one visit, we had a waiter who would rather talk to other waiters than pay any attention to us, and during another, we had two waiters who were taking duplicate orders for the first half of our meal, and then could not attract the attention of either during the second half, short of actually waving our arms in the air. In addition to the incompetent staff, this restaurant employs the most annoying technology I have ever seen- they bring a portable credit card machine to your table and make you CHECK YOURSELF OUT.  I have never seen anything so tacky at a supposedly nice restaurant.  You have to swipe your own credit card like you were at Subway, then select your tip from the choices of \"18%,\" \"20%,\" or \"other.\"  Needless to say, I chose \"other.\"  I should have chosen ZERO. Get it together, Ventano.  Your food is too good to have such terrible waitstaff and a fast-food check-out.  Let me know when you fix it and I'll be back.",

I used the bread sticks to dip into it. That tasted a bit good. My girlfriend has the Rigatoni, that also tasted a bit bland. Even with the sauce and additions to it, tasted like plain pasta. The best part of the meal to me was the Bruschetta appetizer. I am sure I will be venturing back to this place eventually to try something else, but not anytime soon. Just my 2 cents opinion.",

Amazing food and Carlos, gave us great service with great suggestions and explanations. This is our second time here and this time around, we decided to come for lunch. Bad move. We first walk in and we are greeted but and we sat down, one guy asks us if ee want beverages and he brings my wife the wrong beverage. In addition, We had a groupon that we wanted to use and we asked them 3 different times if it was acceptable even though it said dinner. He finally tells us it is no good then walks away instead of asking us if we were ready to order even though we had been ready for ten minutes already. We asked for some bread and he says right away, 15 minutes later we still don't have any bread. I assumed it was cooking but he never told us it was in the oven and it would be a few more minutes or anything like that. Finally we order and it takes another 30 minutes or so. So roughly, 50 minutes into us being there we finally get our food. It was delicious. Sometime during the meal I asked for more bread and of course, we never get it nor does he ever tell us it was cooking. I asked for a refill on water and I get another Ginger Ale. It seemed like this duo couldn't grt a damn thing right. Did I mention we had an empty glass sitting on our table for half an hour while eating our food? The food is delicious but if this is the service we get, then surely it will be the last time we come here. If we are gracious enough to come back, we are definitely going for dinner, not lunch.",

    "text": "Talk about being foodie side swiped by a random suburban Italian restaurant.   I meet my mom here for dinner and to be honest, my mom's taste in restaurants mostly falls into the \"chain\" categories, nothing fancy and convenient. So I was surprised when I read the reviews on Ventano's and more even more taken back by the look of the place.  Normally I avoid places that have the words, \"Video Poker\" or \"24hr Lounge\" on the side of the building. This just says mediocre food and smoke filled rooms of sad degenerates. Not the case here at all here, first off the bar with the Video Poker is 100% separated from the dining area and is sealed off with heavy glass doors. The dining area is completely smoke-free, not a hint of smoky smell seeps into the dining room.   The view from the dining area is amazing; really no matter where you sit in the dining area you'll get a full view of the Vegas valley. I do recommend sitting in the raised portion of the dining room for a fully unobstructed view or if the weather is nice just enjoy the patio and glass of wine.    We ordered Grilled Shrimp on the Stone to split and two chicken Caesar salads. Not the normal hearty Italian meal, but I had just left the gym. The shrimp was amazing and seasoned simply with garlic and lemon, served literally on a searing hot stone. It also comes with two side dipping sauces, but these shrimp are so good on their own that you really don't need them.   I know what you're thinking, can a chicken Caesar salad really be that good? Yes, the mountain of greens, chicken and dressing was delicious. Not overly dressed, just a touch of Parmesan, but what really made this so good was the way the chicken was prepared. You could tell it had been flattened with a mallet, seasoned and seared on a super hot surface to create that crunch on the outside while still juicy on the inside. The salad game is strong with this place.   The service was immaculate from top to bottom. Plates cleared quickly and my water glass was never empty. I will definitely be back and my next trip will include a little vino and some ravioli or gnocchi.",

Our waiter Carlos was out of this world, if there were a Masters program for his craft, he would be the one teaching it. He checked on us often and was the most polite, professional and friendly waiter I have encountered in years! Great job Carlos!!!  The food: I ordered the Veal Parmesan, wife had the potato wrapped salmon, one kid had the Fettuccine Alfredo and the other kid had a bowl of clam chowder soup. We all tasted each other's food and it was all delicious! Tasted like home made, I can't wait to go back! Highly recommend, kids loved it, and they never hold back!

I asked for it to be pounded but evidently not as this would have been discovered. When brought to the kitchen's attention they acted ignorant. Overall a very poor experience.

A good friend of mine wanted to take me to dinner here about a month ago and I didn't want to say no to her since she picked the place and said it was one of her favorites so I decided I would go. Well I can tell you whatever was wrong the first time was corrected because I had the shrimp scampi and it was absolutely out of this world. My friend had the salmon and gave me a taste-it was delicious to say the least. Perfectly done.  The service here has always been excellent so no problem there. I'm glad I went this time and will definitely go back again.",

My steak was over cooked and tough. However the worse part was when the manager flat out lied about the price of the wine. He quoted the price for a split and served the full bottle. When the check arrived the wine was twice what he quoted. Then he lied and said he told us that. If you like crappy food and being taken advantage of, this place is for you. We'll never go back.",

    "text": "I went here expecting to pay an arm and a leg for some good food and wine, but I was wrong, Ventano's has AMAZING chefs who put some serious love and care into their food. The price was perfectly balanced. I believe my total came to 140 for 2 appetizers, 2 entree's and 2 $35 bottles of wine and a ton of their delicious free bread. Not to mention the BEAUTIFUL view of the strip at night  . It was an al around awesome experience and it all comes with top notch service, my gf cut her arm somehow and the waiter went out of his way to find the first aid kit so I could patch up her arm. Everything about this place just screams \" we care about your experience and night out\" if you're going out on a date for the first time or if you're taking your significant other out for just a night of fine wine, delicious food and a beautiful view, Ventano's  is right for you! Trust me when I say the pictures do not do it any justice! This place was absolutely delightful. Top notch Chefs, waiting staff, bartenders and bussers, they were all so polite and amazing. Thank you for making our night out so special!",

Sitting along the windows, you get a great view overlooking the city with the strip in the background.  Service here was good from our waiter Carlos.  Attentive and friendly!  Complimentary garlic breadsticks are brought to the table in a brown paper bag.  Definitely strange but they are delicious... especially dipped in the oil and vinegar. I chose the Tuscan Salad for dinner.  This is mixed greens, mushrooms, onions and walnuts.  It's then topped with a warm bacon dressing.  I then ordered the grilled shrimp on the hot stone. I thought the shrimp would compliment the salad nicely. I placed about half of the shrimp on the salad.  It was great!   It was definitely a pleasant dining experience and would love to try out their lunch menu.  Enjoy!",

My wife and I shared a Caesar salad and it was more than we could eat. They served just out of the oven bread sticks that were wonderful. My wife had the Tortellini Ventano and thought it was really good. I took our waiters recommendation and had the Chicken Marsala which is one of my go to dishes. Ventanos Chicken Marsala is the best I've ever had. I will not hesitate in ordering it again. We will not hesitate in returning to this restaurant.",

    "text": "Aesthetically, the restaurant itself is absolutely beautiful and boasts a romantic view of the strip.  It offers al fresco dining and has a private room that can host parties.  It has such a romantic ambiance that is perfect for date night.  The service was great and very attentive.  My glass of water was never empty and there never felt like a long gap between visits from our server Amy.  The bread in a bag they give you was delicious.  It was warm and soft and I had to stop myself from filling up on that to save room for dinner. I like that they pour olive oil and balsamic vinaigrette into a plate as a dipping sauce for you.  I ordered the mahi mahi special.  It came with giant sea scallops, mahi mahi topped with crab, jasmine rice (although our server had said risotto), and asparagus.  Everything was cooked perfectly.  There was a miso demi glaze on the scallops, but I couldn't find the miso flavor.  It tasted just a bit more like sweet and sour sauce to me.  The flavor profile was a tad on the bland side for my taste, but nothing a little salt and pepper couldn't fix.  Overall, my food was good.  Just a few notes.  The outside patio overlooks the parking lot as well as the gorgeous view of the strip.  It's unfortunate the parking lot is there, but that view over sunset and at night is beautiful.  The patio is also on a slight decline.  Our table and items placed on the table slanted just a bit.  It's nothing terrible, but it's noticeable.  And lastly, they don't give you prices for the specials.  If you're budget conscious, ensure to ask.  The mahi mahi special set me back $32 whereas most of their dinner items were $16-25ish.  Overall, the food was more like 3.5 stars (my date had the pesto gnocchi which was very one note in flavor and gummy because it was overcooked,  a disappointment, but my food was pretty good), service was 4 stars, and the restaurant itself and atmosphere are 5 stars. So it all evens out to a 4 star rating.",

Based on this more recent experience, we won't be spending any more birthdays here.  We made a reservation with a note asking for a booth for my mother's birthday with their nice view. It was a bit busy, but we watched multiple groups who had walked in get booths long after our reservation time had come and gone. Half an hour after our reservation time and after everyone else waiting had been seated, the hostess (who we had to repeatedly prompt for a table...) offered us a table without a view. That was fine -- we could see that they were busy. They put us at a table that still had to be wiped down with only two chairs for our party of four. We asked if we could be put at the next table over (which was ready), and she gladly placed us there... and then took away one of the table settings. After we told her there were four of us, she retrieved the silverware and unceremoniously dumped it in a pile for our fourth person. Well, we figured, at least we had a table now.  Our waiter was very kind and friendly, though we did have to ask for drink refills a few times. The food was mostly delicious, with a couple of just decent dishes. They were busy that night (a Saturday), but the 30-40 minutes between our appetizers and entrees was still a bit long and without any updates. They initially forgot one of the boxes with some leftovers, but we got that sorted out.  Overall just a disappointing meal for what was supposed to be a nice birthday dinner for my mom. I've heard that the staff usually doesn't care if you have a special event here, and I have to agree with that. Good food, but unremarkable service. Happy whatever birthday, Mom.",

The space is inviting for small and intimate parties or big groups. I've been here with large birthday parties and for romantic date nights. The large windows in the back that overlook the strip are the perfect spot for a romantic dinner, and we've even seen an engagement happen there! The employees are friendly and the service is decent enough. But the food isn't consistent and I often wonder if the ravioli are fresh or frozen. It's been cold multiple times that I've gotten it. For these prices, which would be reasonable for a much higher end locale and a much more palatable experience, the ravioli just doesn't live up to my standards. And bread in a paper bag? This would be charming at, let's say, Pizza Rock, but here, it just seems out of place. This is one of my favorite locations to celebrate because of the views, ambiance and proximity to my house. But it just isn't my favorite dining experience.",

A little more round and soft than most Sauvignon Blancs I've tried, it was refreshing and really easy to drink.  For starters, a tray of antipasti was passed with roasted red peppers, artichokes, salami, and mushrooms.  Next were two hot appetizers:  calamari and shrimp on a hot stone.  The calamari was fresh and had a nice fried crunch (hate soggy calamari), and the shrimp was sizzling.  There was a choice of main entrees, and I opted for the potato-crusted salmon and risotto.  The salmon was fresh and cooked perfectly, the risotto consistency was a bit too much like oatmeal.  I heard the wine menu is extensive, and I'd like to try Ventano again with the hubby - a few appetizers and some vino sound just right!",

I got the Cheese Ravioli and words cannot even describe how good this food is. The meat sauce is very good with the Ravioli. It's very calm and not like a football joint like Buffalo Wild Wings. If you hate bugs, bring a sweater because it's a little chilly. On a scale of 1 to 10, I'd give this restaurant a 100. Would totally come back here!",

A little pricey for kids meals and kids drinks so I assume they want to minimize kids in the restaurant. I guess their business is good enough without having too many families visit. We'll definitely go back but this won't be a weekly visit, maybe once a month.",

I don't remember exactly we ordered, but I do remember that it was so salty that my friend and I both could barely choke it down. Like spit-it-out ack-sound salty. The only reason we ate more than two bites of our meals was because we knew we were going out drinking after and wanted our tummies to be full. I will most definitely never be eating here again.  The view was beautiful and service was fine.",

I recently celebrated a birthday there, and Carlos went above and beyond to make my birthday experience one to remember.  I will definitely return to Ventano, and I will definitely recommend it to anyone looking for Italian food.",

We were first served warm bread, they were more like thick breadsticks. The waiter came and did the oil and vinegar. That was also very nice. Instead of the usual butter. We then got our calamari. It was a very large appetizer portion. The marinara sauce was very tasty and tasted like it was just made.  I'm not very big on pasta, but they had a nice special. It was orange roughy fish served over risotto with scallops and a crabcake. I liked everything very much except for the crabcake, it had too much filling and not enough crab.  We then finished everything off with a Tiramisu. The mascarpone cream was extra fluffy. It was very flavorful and tasted like it was house made. Overall, we had a great time!",

So we still had hope the food was good because this was a recommendation from a friend. Sad to say my lasagne was cold in the middle and it was just a mess of melted cheese. One out of the three of the manicotti my husband ordered was good. When I asked our bus boy if they microwaved the food he said no and apologized again. Again our server never acknowledges us and I have to ask the bus boy for the check.I hate to give one star but sorry to say its deserved on this one. Find another venue to eat at.",

Their pasta selection and specials are sure to include everything you'd want from seafood to pasta with amazing sauce choices. I love their shrimp on the rock for an appetizer which is sizzling shrimp on a stone rock. I love their Shrimo Ventano which is huge shrimp with their pink sauce served with spinach and linguini (I'm dairy free and it's worth the rule breaking.) my husband loves their ravioli.... and their fresh breadsticks!  Drinks: Ventano has a very nice wine selection. There's even the option to do half bottles if you want to do a smaller taste of select options. The price ranges are good so you can splurge or enjoy a reasonably priced bottle.   Service: the servers are always very friendly and the staff is quick to refresh beverages and bring dishes! We have had good convo with everyone we've met there!   We come here at least once a month and love the local view and dinner option!",

Needless to say the food was delicious all things considered.  If you even remotely like shrimp and scallops- get the Scallop and Shrimp pasta. It's in a cream sauce with spinach and sun dried tomatoes. Soooo good!!! The piccata was ordered with shrimp which paired perfectly with the lemony sauce. The special was good, but was not a fan of the breaded halibut. The lobster ravioli was good,  but the blackened shrimp that can with the dish were overwhelmingly spiced. We didn't expect to get the affogato in a bowl, and it's not on the menu btw, but it was still delicious. The tiramisu was tasty but nothing spectacular. The creme brulee was warm- which you don't normally get when you order that and it was amazing. If you want a good Italian meal- this is the place to get it!",

With reservations we had a short wait and were seated. We were greeted by our waiter, Mike, and our evening began. Mike was very friendly and He immediately established a fun environment for our evening. Mike was very helpful on describing the choices on the menu and helped the 2 ladies in our party to decide between several dishes that they were interested in.  Our dinner was Great and we totally enjoyed the dishes that we ordered. Through our evening Mike was available to check on us and make sure that we were enjoying our meals and we were well taken care of.  Bottom line, Thank You to Mike for adding so much fun to our evening and for the Great Service. Kuddos to Ventanos for helping us to make a new Thanksgiving memory.",

Calling to make the reservation and explaining it was a surprise, they went above and beyond to make sure it went off without a hitch. The extra details they thought of was superb. Richie, the bartender, was super helpful with the reservation. He went beyond to make sure my reservation was in place. Wonderful customer service for sure. Mike, the manager went beyond as well with his extra details. Excellent customer services as well! Fantastic manager. I see why his staff is so amazing. Our server was Marcos. Had him before and was so excited to see him as our server again. He handled our party of 25 alone with no issues. So polite, always smiling, extremely respectful and very friendly.

The place had a few other large parties but the team was very attentive, drinks were refilled, food was timely and delicious. Great selection of wine and price of the meals. For having such a large group I'm very happy with the pace of the evening. The view of the strip was beautiful (nice to see it from afar). I'll absolutely be back next time I'm in town. Super impressed!",

Can't wait to try other appetizers, they all sound so good I plan to return for a meal of just apps! I ordered the shrimp and scallop pasta, with penne instead of linguine (not the best fork spinner with pasta ). It was delicious! Also a large portion I have half for lunch tomorrow! My husband ordered the lobster ravioli with shrimp and it was great too! Will definitely be returning & recommending!",

    "text": "Dinner here was such a mixed bag I just closed my eyes and clicked a random star amount.  so I'll break it down by which things earned how ever many stars... (Stick around for the 1 star if you just want to read something hilarious)  5 Stars - Our server (I wish I heard his name more clearly... more on this later): He was cheery and hustled like freshman trying to make varsity his first time out.  Water glasses refilled as soon as they were half empty.  He buzzed about his section ensuring all of his guests were enjoying their meals and did everything with a smile.  The only other detail I could give you is that he mentioned he's worked at the restaurant for over 10 years.   4 Stars - Entrees: I Like my Vitello Francese zesty and it was but i wish it was dialed back just a little, it was also just a tad overdone, overall still quite delicious.  The pasta was cooked 'al dente' and the portions were quite ample, although to be fair I would not have complained about another slice of veal on my plate.  3 Stars - Soup, Salad and Bread: This may be splitting hairs but I thought the salad dressing was a little on the sweet side but the greens were fresh, the pasta fagioli was a little 'meh' (normally one of my favorite parts of going out for Italian food) and the bread sticks were just a little lacking in everything, taste, texture and the ability to sop up oil vinegar or extra pasta sauce... that being said I polished off a whole bag myself.   2 Stars - This may be 'reality check' time for management: bringing bread to the table in a paper bag is weird, off putting and ridiculous.  This of course, unless you want to be Olive Garden, Wait...! No...! Even Olive Garden brings their frozen and reheated bread sticks to the table in a basket!!!!  What the damn hell people?!?!  Maybe the owner thought he was going to run a taqueria and bought all the paper bags for chips for to-go orders, but ended up opening a nice Italian restaurant instead but didn't want to be wasteful so used the paper bags as a way to be a little greener.  Sorry I digress.  What were we talking about? right, 2 stars - I waited a few minutes after entering at the host counter before being greeted.  1 Star - Patrons... sorry, one, individual patron.  Look it's not even the restaurant's fault. I'll throw in an additional star for our waiter for having to deal with this scum bag. Let me describe him for you, mind you he was seated the whole time.  Approximately 6'0, maybe 250, shaved head and a white moustache and goatee.  He wore a bright red aloha shirt and thought the calamari was \"Really Good,\" possibly in his late fifty's early sixty's and very clearly impotent. You read correctly \"Clearly Impotent.\"  Now before you jump down my throat for being insensitive, lacking understanding or for bashing his medical condition, please understand that he was literally yelling the entire time I was at the restaurant about, and these are his words not mine, \"Boner Pills!\"  Perhaps it is clear why I couldn't hear our kind server tell us his name.  Throughout the meal he mentioned by name his need for, and by brand name, Cialis, all the while talking about his friends and their \"hookers.\" He proceeded to prattle on about this \"Chick\"  he wanted to (This will be the one time I paraphrase in an attempt to keep things PC) - get with- .  Next it he asked his dining companion advice on a medical procedure that involved a needle and would have resulted in a slightly more permanent solution to his condition. I tried to have a conversation about the nice view from our table of the Vegas strip, but my normal inside voice was drowned out by his bellowing about this woman who would come to town and drop by a friend of his for an adult visit and to purchase something that could easily be confused for baking soda from far enough away.  While I'm all for people having a good time and I am understanding of people and there medical condition's, seedy cravings and I try not to  judge, can we all agree there are some things that we should keep in the comfort of our own homes with people we know?",

    "text": "Read the reviews and there's mixed ratings here, even from some of my Yelp buds.   What it takes to get 4+ star review from me... -The Service -The Wait -The Ambiance -The Food -The Price  5 for 5 on my last visit here at Ventano Italian grill.  It's bee awhile since I got to indulge in some Italian food.  Actually, it was three weeks, but who's counting.  The gf booked Ventano for my birthday weekend with friends.  That alone is 5 stars!! Service was pretty good. We didn't wait since we had reservations, our orders were taken quick, our drinks kept full, and our food didn't take long.  The ambiance at Ventano was one of the highlights.  If you're seated by the windows, you get a good view of the strip. As for the food, it's tough for me to judge what everyone else thought.  But they must have liked their dishes because nothing was left on anyone's plate.  I wanted their Chicken Marsala and Lasagna.  The gf wanted the same. I got the lasagna, she got the Marsala, and we shared.  Just my preference, but I prefer my lasagna to have more pasta and meat over one that is buried in sauce.  Ventano's is buried in sauce, which wasn't bad. It's just not how I like it.  As for their Chicken Marsala, this was pretty good.  This too was covered in their sauce, but I prefer my Chicken Marsala this way.  Ventano hooks this one up with enough pieces of chicken to satisfy your protein needs.  Regarding price, I thought it was about average depending on what you're getting.  Some dishes seemed a little high, while some was just right.    Overall, the food was decent, the service was on par, and the views are fantastic.    PS:  Their breadsticks are addicting.  3 orders please!  YELP PERSONAL CHALLENGE - (025/366)",

We bring our newborn baby and she just relaxes while  mommy and daddy eat . We ended up spending around or more than a 100 ,but that's ok cause the food is amazing . I noticed that there is no women servers tho . Not that it matters but the serving staff is only men. The last time we ate there , they stuck us where all the food and servers walk in a out of . It was rather noisy and the glasses clattering was disturbing my baby's sleep . Next time I'd like to be offered a booth where the nice view is . Just cause I have a stroller shouldn't limit my seating and dining . But bittersweet the food is great!",

    "text": "My wife and I have been regulars at Ventano's for almost 10 years. It's truly a hidden gem among the seemingly endless dining options in Las Vegas. The great food, enjoyable ambiance, and friendly staff simply can't be topped. I don't think there has been a birthday, anniversary, or other special occasion that we haven't celebrated here in years.  Let's start with the food. In addition to the well-prepared standard Italian fare with some French and other influences, there are always great steak and seafood specials. My personal weakness is their fillet mignon with rosemary demi glace - whenever that's on the menu, I can't not order it. The various seafood specials are also equally excellent, usually served over a bed of tasty risotto. Dessert is also fantastic - we can never decide between the creme brulee and the tiramisu, because we love both. Be warned - the portions here are large - you won't go home hungry after a meal at Ventano's, unlike many \"fine dining\" restaurants. Oh, and shrimp on the stone. Just do it.  Ventano's also has a very well-stocked wine cellar. In addition to the well-known names you'd expect to find in the cellar of any decent restaurant are dozens of spectacular wines just waiting to be discovered. I can't count how many times Mike, the manager at Ventano's, has introduced us to wines that we'd never heard of that quickly became some of our favorites.  What really makes this place special, however, is the staff.  I've never walked in and not felt like family the moment I stepped through the door. Everyone is friendly and accommodating, which is the perfect accompaniment to the old-world charm of the ambiance and decor.  Oh, and did I mention that this place has the best view of the Las Vegas Strip you can possibly get?  Living in Las Vegas, there's certainly no shortage of options available for great food.  I think that speaks pretty highly of just how great this hidden gem is, to keep us coming back year after year.",

They even accommodated us when our family of 5 showed up on the second Saturday of December completely forgetting about all the Company Holiday parties that were going on. We were completely understanding & ready to go somewhere else but they told us to wait a minute & the manager (owner?) came out & said \"no worries! Just give us a minute\" They were able to get us a table with a 5-10 minute wait, max. & with smiles on their faces! That is going WAY above & beyond in my opinion.   The food gets an A+ & my half-Italian Husband (& I by the fact that I've eaten his Mom's cooking!) know good Italian food. Of course, no one will cook better than his Mom but their Cioppino & Veal Parmesan comes pretty darn close!",

I had the Spinach salad  topped with warm Bacon dressing.. a very unique touch and  the combination of mushrooms, bacon and bits of hard boiled eggs went well together.  The Shrimp Scampi was cooked to a perfect texture and the lemon butter cream sauce was to die for! I even dipped my asparagus in it!  I had the Spumoni Ice Cream cake with the cookie crumb crust and hubby had the Almond Caramel Pecan ice cream cake with Bananas Fosters. So make room for it! Dessert was insanely good!    Service and staff was top notch. Even the servers from the bar took time to acknowledge us as we were leaving. I also like the fact when you go to pay your server has a card machine and runs the card in front of you. Very convenient and saves time. Very nice atmosphere with an upscale feel to it and it's the perfect location with the view of the Las Vegas skyline. I see why now the place is always packed!

Additionally, I was concerned about my husband's attire. He wore shorts and a colored shirt. However, a couple came in with a tube top and shorts.

First thing I noticed was the clatter of talking and no background music.  Next was there was seating with good views but we were taken to a table in the upper section to the side with no view.  We are fine looking people of average size, and we were dressed nicely, so no reason to hide us.   Next, a bag was plopped in the center of the table.  It was a bag with dinner rolls.  We asked for a bread basket and the waiter declined our request:  \"we only provide bread baskets for larger parties.\"    So, we passed the bag around and when the waiter returned we asked for more bread.  He nodded and never brought us more.  We ordered wine and the antipasto plate (very good!) and the waiter poured the wine and gave each an appropriate amount except one of us was poured about 1/3 of what the others got.   We wanted to simply enjoy our wine and antipasto but the waiter came 3 times prompting us to order, even though the restaurant wasn't full and was actually getting a thinner crowd.  We ordered, I reminded about the bread, and the food came in a short time.  Very good except 2x we had to remind servers that one of us had not gotten the vegetable side dish that came with her entree.  We ordered eggplant, manicotti, and two of the house specialties.  We all liked our meals and they were very generous servings.  Never got more bread.  Just below our table on the main floor, a family was seated while before we ordered our entrees.  A screaming child, 2 other kids and parents (5 humans).  The kids all got macaroni dishes from a kids' menu.  I think their final bill must have been significantly less than our 4 adult meals, antipasto, and 2 bottles of wine.  They got a bread basket.",

I didn't send it back because I didn't want to create a distraction from the birthday boy who had selected the restaurant and was anxious that everyone enjoyed their meal.

Last time we were there we were both disappointed in the Shrimp-on-a-stone that is usually outstanding but this time it seemed there was NO seasoning...very bland.  My wife had chicken parmesan and I had Lasagna which was excellent, but we had to catch the waiter's eye or a bus boy to get refills of soda or water.  The bread sticks are good and always hot but I wish they'd serve them with butter, too and not just the olive oil.  We've been \"members\" of their dining club for years but they seem to be going downhill.  There was something to be disappointed about in both of our last two dining experiences there.",

My friend and I ordered Fettuccini Alfredo with chicken, calamari, clam chowder and their specialty dessert (forgot the name of the dessert) we told our server that we want our dessert the same time as our food because my friend won't really eat the dishes we ordered, she just want the dessert. We got our Calamari first and it was Amazing, probably THE BEST calamari I've ever tasted. Then took a while to get my fettuccini.. That was fine.. as I was eating it i noticed that my dish have HAIR! It was okay, i understand but i didnt want to eat anything else so we just asked for our dessert that hasnt came in yet! Our server said it will be right out in a minute.. It's been 1 1/2 hours and no dessert on our table !   Won't come here anytime soon..",

The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I've had better Italian food that does earn 5 stars.  However this place is a solid 4 -4 1/2 and will not disappoint.

My linguine was undercooked (to the point it stuck to your teeth).  The food others had did not get rave reviews either.  The food is heavy and a little sloppy on the plate.  The wine we had was great, Coppola Director's Cut Zinfandel.  Overall, it was a fun place but they need to focus on the food more and improve their plating.",

Nice guy, but he just blatantly walks up and asks you things by totally interrupting the conversation it drives me MAD! No manners, no courtesy, no \"excuse me\", NOTHING. I am so tired of this! A great waiter makes his/her presence known but doesn't just barge up HOW ARE YOU? My girlfriend was talking about her very ill husband and it happened at least 3 times by A and even more times by some dark haired kid that I think was a food runner IS EVERYTHING OKAY? DO YOU WANT MORE WATER? HOW IS THE FOOD? Please, servers and/or owners -- LEARN that interrupting RUINS the dining experience for your guests. If you MUST, be polite, say EXCUSE ME and WAIT until you are acknowledged, don't just barge in and say a paragraph while your guests are trying to talk about something ..... it ruined my entire time at Ventano's. And by the way the food WAS DELICIOUS!!! I am sorry for the chef who did such a great job on the food because these under skilled waiters are just horrible and made it all a terrible experience. If I ran/owned a restaurant I would DEMAND my servers LEARN how to be great servers, there is actually a handful of great rules/practices they should be following, and so far at Ventano's they aren't. Big fat bummer.",

    "text": "I started looking through yelp for a great italian place to take my wife for mothers day since she loves italian and we rarely eat it when we go out because I am not a fan but after checking out the reviews I decided that we would try Ventanos, I decided to hop on open table and make a reservation for 4 for mothers day. I was pretty excited to take her here because of all the hype that I had read, It is unfortunate that it did not live up to it. Let me explain.   We walked in and let the lady working the door know we had reservations and she says no problem let me see what we can do. After a minute or so she asked us to step to the side and sit in a oddly place booth by the front door while we wait. This may seem nit picky but it seems it would be a much nicer sitting/waiting area without the table.. Anyways, we then waited there for between 10 and 15 minutes while watching them seat other parties of 4 or more while we just sat there.. Another lady who I am assuming is a manager or owner was walking around checking on the place and helped clear a table that is on a raised area right when you walk in and then came and seated us. I can deal with waiting to be seated, yes it is irritating when you make a reservation just to find yourself waiting.   Once we were seated it took quite a while for the server to even come to the table to offer drinks or even say hello. All while I am overhearing the older couple sitting right behind us praise who I am assuming was the manager about how awesome his service was. Once we finally ordered our drinks the next thing that caught me off guard was when he walked by and set a brown bag with bread sticks in it on our table. Now, I don't know if that is the regular procedure and if it is, in our opinion which may not mean too much it is very tacky to come to a restaurant selling $25-$30 entree's and be handed a greasy brown bag with bread sticks in it..   So, now that my kids have breadsticks and are happy that they have some food we are now ready to order and again we waited for an extended amount of time to order and every drink on our table went completely empty. The waiter then came over and we ordered. My son ordered a pizza, my daughter got the alfredo  my wife got the veal marsala and I ordered Filipino chicken adobo... I know that sounds odd but I guess the chef is filipino and has this on the menu. Once the food came I thought it would be the saving grace. My daughters fetticini was grainy but everything else was good, but the part that was odd to me is that the Filipino Adobo dish was by far the best dish at our table... To the point that my wife, the italian food lover took my adobo sauce and put it on her noodles from the marsala because she said the sauce was just ok.   So now we fight the battle of paying the bill, the server came back with the check quite a while after we had finished and I tried to get my card to him quickly and unfortunately he walked away before I could hand it to him so I looked at the bill. $83 for 4 of us with 2 of them being kids.. Kids drinks at a $3 price point each was a little excessive and I although the food was ok it was definitely not worth the $25-$30 price range that is being charged. We sat again for another 25 minutes exactly (yes, we timed it) before the server came back to take our check. Once we paid we filled out the feedback card which I highly doubt made it to management, nobody is going to hand their boss something that says, well the food was just okay and your service was absolutely horrendous.   I personally cannot stiff anyone, and this was the first time in my life that I wanted to walk out without leaving any tip. No drink refills and an $83 lunch that took from 12:45 when we walked in the door until 2:50 when we walked out is crazy, I could only imagine if every server in that place was that slow and non attentive they would seat only 4-8 parties at that table all day with an average 2 hour meal time.  I wanted to like this place because the location is great but the bottom line is that even if the food was just ok and not great and they had stellar service I would come back over and over again but with the food being just ok and the service being horrible I know that I will not go out of my way to go back or recommend anyone to go there.",

We had to send back, shrimp was not cooked through. There was also an extremely long wait.    This time, last night, I made a reservation for 7:30 pm, we arrived at 7:15 pm.  Hostess said they were running a little behind.  We said ok.  We sat and waited.... And waited...Several people were seated who entered after us.  At 8:00 I asked the hostess, is our table ready yet?  She said no and proceeded to sit a party of four.  I asked about why they were seated first, she said \"their reservation was at 7:00.    At 8:15, we were finally seated.  Waiter was very pleasant.  They brought bread and drinks, we ordered.... Then the wait was on. We noticed nobody was receiving food.    At 8:40 we received our dinner.  We wasn't real hungry by then because we kept eating the bread because no food was coming out and we were hungry.  The food was hot and looked good.  I had chicken marsala, which was always my favorite here.  I started eating, it tasted good until I cut into a thicker piece of chicken... put it in my mouth and realized It was very much under cooked.  I spit it out and just ate some of the pasta that accompanied it.  When the waiter came over at 9:00, asked if I liked the dinner because I hardly eaten it.  I told him the chicken wasn't cooked all of the way, he said he could replace, I said no that we weren't hungry.  We paid the bill and then left.  It's very sad because we used to love this restaurant and would recommend to our friends.  Now, it wouldn't be one that we recommend to any of our friends.   And, we probably would not choose to come back.",

The only reason I am giving it 4 stars is because the kitchen took a really long time to make our food, which is no fault of Carlos's, because when it did come it was super hot and fresh. We had 3 bottles of wine, and wanted one more of the same kind, but they had run out. Due to this, Carlos gave us 2 desserts on the house.",

We came again tonight because I had a gift card and we were in the area.  My opinion of the food dropped tremendously since the prior visits. The restaurant was half empty but we had to wait about 15minutes for a table. We decided to get a drink at the bar, which is also a smoking area (yuck), the bartender was too worried about the TV's in the bar than to wait on us, well we finally ordered 2 Ginger and Bulleit, so either the ginger ale was flat or he added water to our drinks because they tasted watered down. We got seated, right behind the waiters station (annoying) even though there were many other tables open (whatever). We both decided to get the specials of the night. He got the New York Strip and I got the Crab stuffed Dover Sole (the waiter raved about it). They both tasted like bad diner meals, I was supposed to have Spinach risotto on the side, it was more like old cold rice with a sprinkle of parmesan cheese mashed into a lump (Gordon Ramsey would have a cow!) I found a shell, I think/I hope in my crab stuffing on top of my fish. Nothing tasted good, it was sad what they did to that food. Our wait staff and hostess were nice and friendly but that doesn't make my tummy happy.  I don't want to go back.",

He completely helped me with whole set up flow, and they even put up the party signs and worked closely with my balloon decorator. The food was great, the service was unbeatable, and I got so many compliments from guests on both! Ethical...I wanted to get more food, and Michael said what I had ordered was going to be plenty.

Just mentioned to waitress, she immediately stopped by the table and replaced them with perfect smaller ones. This is a serious chef based Italian place and our Veal Parmesan was perfect as usual.

Chef Arnauld has a fun and sarcastic humor which enlightened our experience there!   The food was great! Of course bread was served with olive oil and balsamic vinegar, I ordered the tortellini with pesto which was perfectly made! I am a sucker for pesto! And my friend got the veal de Angelo, and he totally loved it! Everything about our  visit was great, I will say that it was a tad bit warm in there but that's nothing to take away a star for and complain about when everything was delightful!",

    "text": "First time here.  Came for a birthday dinner and my friend asked me to choose where we were going as he didnt know where to pick so I looked up the menu and reviews and decided that this sounded like a good place.  I loved the way it looked and felt inside.   We were told to seat ourselves and chose a window booth which was quite comfortable, quiet and had a beautiful view of the strip in the distance, I can only imagine what that would be like at night!  I also felt like it had a romantic vibe and would be a great place to take a date, haha, if I had a date to bring!  The waiter, Adam, was super friendly, attentive and made eye contact which isnt as common as you might think!      We werent dicing!  We ordered the beef carrpaccio and bruchetta.   The Bruchetta was AMAZING.    I didnt care as much for the carrpaccio as I used to but that isnt a reflection on the restaurant or chef, Its just not something I am into as much as I once was.  For dinner we ordered, Veal Parmgiana, the potato wrapped salmon and the pesto Gnocchi.     Our friend loves the salmon and I tried a bite and agree, it was DELICATE...JUICY... and full of flavor though I wasnt a personal fan of the sauce it came with but it wasnt my dish and she loved it and that is all that matters.     The Birthday boy had the Veal and said it was good and I had the pesto but it was just OK, I didnt care for how dry it was..but that can be fixed, I brought the leftovers home   :)    Luckily I am a brilliant home cook  :D  Dessert time!  Friend ordered chocolate lava cake or molten cake maybe and it was SOOOO Good, Rich and warm in your mouth, we all like to order 3 different desserts and each of us will try each one to see which is best, I had the amazing succulent creme brulee but the B-day boy, while they did light a candle and Happy B-day was written on the plate in powdered chocolate which was so cool, None of us felt like it had much flavor....  So....  We will return to try dicing here......Its not like we didnt like it...we have just had a better experience....but sure, we'll be back.    :)    The die may leads us to different foods...which will change the experience completely....  Oh and I forgot the spumoni at the end, I asked if it was ice cream as it said Ice cream cake and the waiter said, no its just cold cake so we wanted ice cream and passed but later saw someone else order it and asked them how it was and it was ice cream!  Also...bread in a bag?   do you need me to add you to the wish list (My gift giveaways group) and buy you a basket?",

His portion was generous, and salmon cooked well, but there was very little flavor. No use of herbs, spices, seasoning..nothing.  My lobster ravioli was a fairly skimpy portion for $25 ... four decently sized ravioli and 3 small shrimp. Once again, I wouldn't mind this, had it not been so bland. The sauce was completely unimaginative and left a lot to be desired.  The service was adequate. We were seated immediately and our server was fine. The water was refilled in timely manner and we didn't have to wait too long to get the check. Overall, not worth the $50 for two entrees without drinks or an appetizer.",

First of all, the bread with balsamic vinegar and oil is so delicious.  I could have eaten that alone as my entire meal and been satisfied!  I ordered the Ventano Tortellini and my fiance ordered the Fettuccine con Funghi.  The portions are huge and have that special homemade taste about them!  We definitely needed to go boxes. Our server obliged us in showing us the banquet room and patio (where the ceremony would take place).  He answered all of our questions professionally and even had a packet put together with pricing etc.  He gave us the event coordinators information (we came in on a Saturday, so he was not there). We are not sure if this is the place for our wedding, but we will certainly be back for the food!",

They also have outdoor seating overlooking the strip as well if you are willing to sweat it out in the summer.  We were promptly greeted by our server.  Some of the male servers I saw looked like they stepped off a page of GQ. :)  Just an observation. ;) I ordered the shrimp on the stone which was sooooo delicious.  My mom ordered the lasagna, while I ordered the ventano tortellini.  Both were excellent.  Food came out in a timely manner and service was great.  You can check out their menu online, with prices, before you go.  I loved the vibe of this place, and I didn't get a feeling that it was dated at all like some reviews suggest.  But, I also don't judge a place by how it looks, some of the best food I have had came from dated hole in the walls! :) When we were leaving, we were thanked for coming by the hostesses, such a nice touch.  I will be back with my husband for a date night.",

I'm not going to write out the details, but Marcos figured out what happened, and then made it right, without us having to initiate anything. I really appreciated that from him. Too often service businesses make mistakes, and then put the onus on the customer to try to resolve the issue. But on this night, Marcos made it a very special evening by taking good care of us on his own initiative. We will be back for the great service and the excellent food.",

So, we decided to try Ventano's for lunch.   We had great service from Arturo and Austin.  We were off to a great start.  Then, the Bruschetta arrived which was not good.  The tomatoes and bread were tasteless.  I ordered the homemade Lasagna which sounded good but lacked taste.  Pam had the Speciality of the House, Tortellini.  Unfortunately, it tasted the same as my Lasagna.  Both meals arrived in a steaming hot bowl.  The presentation would not have survived in the Chopped Kitchen.  We will not return to Ventano's.  I do hope their evening meals and presentation of food is better.",

Seeing as a lot of our usual spots were already closed, we searched for a place that was still open online. We figured we'd try out Ventano. This place EXCEEDED EXPECTATIONS IN EVERY WAY. We sat at a booth and had a very nice view of the strip. The place was very simply and elegantly decorated with nice lighting (not too dark like most places). I didn't catch his name, but our server was efficient and friendly. And don't even get me started on the food. DELICIOUS. We shared a plate of muscles to start and a couple glasses of the house wine. I got the Lobster Ravioli, probably the best I've ever had and deceptively filling. My boyfriend got the Pennette Arrabiata and added sausage as recommended by the waiter. We did end up adding some salt to his but the flavor of the dish just got better the more we ate. Over all really good portion sizes. Filled us up but left us with a little room for some ice cream at the end. The check ended up being about $100 for everything, which was a steal considering the overall quality of our experience. We will absolutely be back!",

She always talks about the food she had in Italy. Well she wants to come back and that is the only endorsement I care for.  Happy dinning.",

The hostess was no where to be found. One waiter waiting several tables, all more important than ours. He only talked to us at the end when he brought us the check. The bus boy took our order and refilled beverages. Just super rude and not a luxurious experience at a place which used to be my favorite restaurant for the ambiance. Being cheap and not staffing well enough lost the business a loyal customer.",

The atmosphere is cozy but spacious with an amazing view of the Strip. Service is impeccable every time. The food is always delicious, well presented, and delivered in a timely way. My favorite dish is the potato-wrapped salmon, which I always recommend to my guests, and they, too, flip over it -- perfectly cooked but still moist and flaky. Ventano also has special menus for holidays such as Thanksgiving and Christmas Day in addition to their regular fare. Go there and you can't go wrong!",

    "text": "One of those restaurants that have been on my bookmarks for a long time, I was finally able to visit them for lunch this week. I made a reservation via OpenTable, but for a weekday morning, it proved unnecessary. My friend arrived first and the host stand was deserted until I arrived a couple minutes later. There seemed to have been no host as one of the servers simply told us to sit wherever we wanted.  We grabbed a table next to the window with a great view and fantastic light, but the table was dirty and it took some time before someone came by. The same server that greeted us finally brought some menus and cleaned our table before disappearing again. We waited again for settings and after we ordered appetizers, it was some time before we were able to order our entrees. This is essentially what happened for the rest of the meal (waiting for water refills, having to chase after a server to pay our bill, etc).  Their complimentary bread is warm breadsticks served in a bag; served with balsamic and olive oil. They're nice (especially fresh out of the oven as ours were), though not particularly special.  We started with a side of Meatballs ($6) and they are fantastic! Delicious and tender with a really good marinara. I would definitely go for the Meatball Hero.  I also ordered the Chopped Salad (Half; $8.50) with grilled zucchini, bell peppers, artichoke, eggplant, mushroom, salami, ham, mozzarella cheese, marinated tomato, balsamic vinaigrette. First, this was one of the worst chopped salads I've ever had. Second, I asked for the dressing on the side because I HATE drowning salads, but it arrived fully dressed. It was miserably wet and unappetizing. This was made even more apparent with the strange addition of bread (as if it were Panzanella), but the ingredient isn't listed on the menu and it was so, so SOGGY. Needless to say, I didn't finish the salad and I am very glad I opted for the half order (even though $8.50 is still too much for this sad execution).  The Linguine alla Vongole ($14) had Littleneck clams and I chose white sauce (I always do).  The clams were nice, though the pasta was overdone and the sauce was unexciting. Overall, it was just okay.  My friend ordered the Ventano Tortellini ($14): Cheese tortellini, chicken, mushroom, pink sauce; topped with cheese and oven-baked. This is where all the flavor is hiding! The tortellini still had a decent bite and the sauce was delicious. The baked cheese wasn't overwhelming either, so it was a really pleasant dish. I really enjoyed this dish as leftovers, too.  Though I enjoyed the meatballs and Ventano Tortellini, it's very concerning that there was such a polarizing experience with another dish. Plus, the substandard service made us feel un-welcomed. My friend, not nearly as picky as myself, also felt that the meal was shrug-worthy.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I went out to this restaurant Friday night for dinner and were disappointed.  The view is nice, but the decor inside the restaurant looks cheap and cheesy (presented as fancy and elegant).  We ordered the shrimp on a stone, calamari, carpaccio, rack of lamb, and creme brulee.  Shrimp on a stone-  The generous portion of shrimp was well seasoned, and I enjoyed the horseradish dipping sauce.  The presentation was gimmicky and the size of the shrimp leads me to think the shrimp are frozen and not fresh.  Nothing wrong with that except the appetizer is $12 and the restaurant puts on an air of fine dinning.  I would have preferred a smaller portion of large fresh shrimp with a unique element.  Like most of the other food we tried here, this was good but nothing special.  Calamari-  The calamari had a nice texture and was well cooked.  There were two dipping sauces, a homemade spicy marinara and a sweet sticky sauce (not sure what seasonings were in it).  The marinara was not spicy at all and its viscosity was way too thin for dipping.  The sweet sauce had a great consistency for dipping, but it was a little too sweet for my taste.  A thicker more seasoned marinara or a fun aioli would have been a better pairing.  Carpaccio-  I was skeptical ordering carpaccio here because I've had some amazing carpaccio in Las Vegas.  It's not fair of me to compare Ventano's carpaccio to, say, Carnevino's (which is amazing).  However, I love savoring good raw beef and it is always difficult to pass up carpaccio and steak tartar on a menu.  Unfortunately, I could not enjoy the subtleties in the meat and toppings because they overpowered it with mustard (not mustard oil like menu states).  The ratio of mustard and capers (and I like capers on carpaccio) to meat was off.  Rack of lamb-  We ordered the lamb rare, but it came out medium-rare to medium.  It had a nice lamb flavor, but the balsamic sauce poured over it was not the best complement to the lamb. It was served with an assortment of vegetables: miniature squashes, carrots, onioins, celery, and roasted garlic.  I love squash, and the whole miniature green and yellow squash were a nice surprise.  The celery was a bit out of place, and some of the garlic cloves were under roasted and too firm.  However, the garlic cloves that were roasted to sweet perfection complimented the sauce very well.  Again, the dish was okay but nothing special, and definitely not reflective of its $26.50 price tag.  Creme brulee-  The custard had a wonderful flavor and consistency.  They used real vanilla bean and it made a world of a difference.  It was a good temperature, and the custard just melted in your mouth.  My only complaints here are trivial and often done by even the best restaurants.  The crust on top was a little thin and the strawberry pieces on top were not ripe.  It is extremely difficult to get ripe berries especially in the middle of the desert.  If they put the berries on the custard before sprinkling the sugar and torching it, that would help give the berries more character.  All in all, I would not suggest this restaurant.  There are better restaurants in Las Vegas with the same pricing scale.  If you are looking for good fine dinning in Henderson, I'd suggest Todd's Unique Dinning.  Otherwise, the valley is full of great restaurants more worth your time and money.",

Costelette di mialae- honey balsamic ribs served with perfectly seasoned roasted potatoes. lol everyone who ordered this dish thought it tasted and smelled a lot like pork adobo. They used similar ingredients like vinegar, bay leaves, peppercorns, honey. 4 out of the 8 people who went got this dish and the ribs were falling off the bone amazing! 2. Linguine alla vongole- My mom got it with shrimp (6 huge pieces) and I got it with clams, both with a white wine sauce. The dish was good, but out of all the pasta dishes, we feel like they went a little skimpy on the pasta... $18.50 and they gave us literally 4 spoonfuls of pasta.... pasta costs $.50, we wanted to tell the waiter but we were all too hungry to send it back. 3. Ventano Tortellini- My brother ordered this dish and it was another success! Went it got to the table, the cheese & sauce was nice and bubbling because it was cooked in a ceramic pot. Tortellini was perfect 'al dente'. YUM 4. Ventano Chicken Spedini- Came with linguine pasta, the chicken was so tender! 5. Calimari- not greasy, crispy, and the marinara sauce it came with was so fresh.   Overall, everyone left with a satisfied belly. Our family and friends love coming here because the view is just amazing, staff is friendly, and the food is authentic!",

I decided to stop by the bar to play machine.. I ask the bar tender to break a hundred dollar bill so I could play he said no problem walked to the end of the bar and proceed to take other customers drink orders.. I waited and waited then he comes back with my change and never asked me if I wanted a drink.. Do your self a favor and pass on this spot..",

The interior of the restaurant was huge, with a wall full of windows facing the strip in the distance.  The view was nice and the place had a relaxing vibe to it.  My friends and I are, sadly, pretty jaded city folks, so they made fun of me for at least 30 minutes for bringing them to this place.  Especially when they drop bread off in a sack at your table.  Thankfully, Ventano has a pretty good wine list, the server knew what he was talking about, and the food looked fantastic, all for a reasonable price.  Ha ha ha, I laugh at them!  I enjoyed a couple of glasses of server recommended zinfandel and he was right, it was tasty.  My friend ordered the caprese salad.  It was huge so a few of us snuck a bite.  So delicious.  But the highlight of the evening was the Rigatoni Portofino.  OMG, so good!  It's been a few weeks since I had it and my mouth is still watering at the thought of it.  The pink sauce was surprisingly light and flavorful.  I was just wishing I had a fridge and microwave to take it home to!

I told the hostesses that I attempted to make a rez but they just shrugged.  Since I had to get my friend to the airport in an hr & 1/2,  I only had 2 choices.  I had the foresight to peek around the corner into the bar area & saw there were ok looking tables there as well as a regular bar.   We sat there.  Our food was fine, we had Veal Piccata & Veal Saltimbocca.   However, I was upset when we left our stuff at/on the table, went outside quickly to look at the view & my leftover was thrown in the garbage.  No apology or anything to save the day.",

I can only imagine how pretty it is at night with everything lit up. The service was good and the food was delicious. We're planning on going back here sometimes to enjoy a dinner with a view, so i'll update my review once that happens but for now, i'll say that its a great place for a date! :)",

We got there before sunset and were able to watch the sun settle over the mountains and the lights of Las Vegas light up the horizon.  The food was quite tasty and the wine list extensive.  If you want to escape the gaming and noise in Las Vegas. Take the short drive to Henderson to dine at Ventano's. Or if you have been out at Hoover Dam, just stop off on your way back. It is just off the highway.",

    "text": "Sorry to say I brought my elderly parents for dinner last night and I most certainly will never recommend or come back. There were 3 tables with customers, 8 servers 3 front door young girls. We had trouble getting in because my parents are wheelchair bound and I could not get them in because the front doors are big heavy. Finely the girl held the doors for us. We ordered soup and they were cold and not good. We ordered appetizers and when they came they left the used soup bowls on the table that we pushed aside. I had to ask them to remove them so we could have room for the appetizers. I never had silverware or a napkin, I had to get some from the table next to me. We had clams and they gave us a bowl to throw away the shells. it was full and they took it away and never brought another one so we had to put the shells on the table. Ending the night we never could find anyone to give us the bill because everyone was huddled around the young girls. Finely one of the guys with a white shirt on must of seen us waiting and he told the server we were ready for our check. Well 8 minutes later we received it. Now how to get out? No one around the doors to help us out. I had to ask a customer coming in to hold the door then finely the huddle broke and the young girl held the door. If the food was good maybe I could overlook some of these issues but all the way around this restaurant was not a good experience. Too bad it is close to where I live.",

My personal fav, which is not on the menu is the seafood pizza.  A friend tipped me onto this little heavenly secret and I've gotta tell ya, it's more addictive than crack.  I normally start the night with the Shrimp on the Stone, which is accompanied by a honey mustard dipping sauce to top off the sizzly shrimp goodness.  My partner in crime goes absolutely bananas for their Chicken Saltimbocca, which is cooked with sage and topped with prosciutto in a white wine sauce.  I'm also a sucker for Cioppino, which they don't disappoint.    I like to sit at the bar and play video poker while I dine because they have the very best bartenders who take outstanding care of me.  Rich & Patty - go find them and tell them that Stephanie sent you!  I always have such a blast on every visit, which turns into hours of fun.    If the weather is nice, they have a lovely patio with a gorgeous view of the strip.  I love bringing out of town guest here to dine on the patio.  Located in Henderson, it's truly an off the beaten path gem that tourists are unlikely to stumble upon.  Everyone I've ever brought here has fallen in love.  They often host special wine pairing dinners.  Events include 5 delicious courses, each paired with their own wines.  The pours are very generous.  These events turn into a big party where my friends and I often make new friends.",

Stick to the basic pasta dishes and you will be happy. Another great thing is that they will mix up a sauce to your liking or even do half and half. Really willing to go the extra mile to make you happy. A few things that keep it from being 5 star: a little pricey for what you get. If the entrees were $2 cheaper, it'd be about right. And  no tablecloths! For the price you'd expect that. It has a nice view though, and there is an outside area that is nice if you can get a spot out there.",

My perusal of the menu looked tempting but the prices seem a bit on the high side for pasta dishes. Even the side dishes seemed hi with the lower priced items starting at $6.50.  I settled on a pasta dish with a marinara with no meat or vegetables for $19+. The bread was like fat breadsticks and a bit tuff. The oil was severed with balsamic and no herbs. Bland.... Glad I didn't bring company and checked it out on my own.  It wasn't BAD but also wasn't worth the price.",

My daughter ordered a cheese pizza same problem my husband ordered the shrimp Diablo it was bland and the sauce was a weird consistency and lacking flavor. The bread sticks tasted like they were the frozen kind and heated up. I was thoroughly disappointed. None of us finished our food not even half was eaten it was so bad.

Food is over priced, the atmosphere is the only thing going for this place.  Staff needs to be upgraded and trained all around. In personality, service, and knowledge.   Went to the bar and asked for a mojito. Bartender said she \"couldn't\" make it. When the manager (I believe his name is Mike or something... blonde.... light complexion.) came around and asked how we were doing, I had brought up the bartender not having the supplies to make drinks... Like a full bar should. He challenged me, by letting me know that they have fresh mint and it is capable.  Well, I got my 'mojito'.  Makes me wonder if the bartender was telling me she couldn't make it because of the mint.... or that she COULDN'T make it...... because...... gag.  Last June, I set up a birthday of about 16 for my husband's birthday. I made a reservation at least a week in advance. Waiter / busser would throw the bag of bread on the table, and then hide. They could barely be found. Had to beg for refills.  We have had one great waiter in the 3 years we have been eating there, and that is only because I took my pregnant self and spoke to the manager and complained hardcore. He told me to make a reservation with him, he comp'd our meal, and I'm sure that is why we were treated so nice.",

However, I'm pretty sure the last time I went there I was rejected due to attire (jeans and sweater, same as my guest). We got a strange look when we walked in, asked how many people, and then (odd follow up question) if we had a reservation. I stated we did not, as I've never needed one dining at Ventanos. She said they were all booked up this night. It came as a surprise since no one seemed to be dining at the time, from what I could see. Also, if they had already been booked up I'd think the reservation question would have preceded the number of people in my party inquiry. So, we preceded to the bar and I mentioned to the bartender that the dining room was reportedly booked up for the evening. She looked perplexed and preceded to take a look at the dining room herself. She mentioned that was odd. Anyway, my guest and I went to spend our money at another fine dining establishment without an issue. Too bad, I really did enjoy this place.",

I ordered the lobster ravioli and she had cheese tortellini - a total bill nearing $50. We were each unimpressed with both dishes. The portions were considerably smaller than when I had eaten at the restaurant - the food already looked like someone's leftovers! The pomodoro was watery and salty. Probably won't order from here again.",

    "text": "Starting with the positive: wonderful views of Las Vegas at night. My wife and I went on Yelp reviews, but were disappointed. As others have mentioned, the bread sticks are pitiful. How can you have an Italian restaurant with \"bread-sticks\" that are a joke? They are served in a greasy paper bag, are soft, salty, and everything good bread is not. Dip these pizza hut sticks in good olive oil? I think not. Entrees are quite overpriced, and do not even include a salad. The pasta was definitely overcooked, I would say redolent of steam table. The copper-bottomed pans up front  look great, but like much of Vegas, this place seems to be all show with little substance. I had the veal Marsala, it was good, if somewhat tough, but four people , one bottle of Coppola wine and $169? Not for me. I will add that the waiter (can I still say that ?) apparently felt that he was there to entertain us, rather than just fill the orders.",

Each time I thought the food was good but the service was just mediocre.  This past time is the one I will focus on and base my review.  We arrived and the hostess was on the phone.  She continued to stay on the phone for about 4 minutes while we waited.  The she almost talked to us when the phone rang again and, she answered it.  Come on!  Finally, someone else seated us and we were greeted pretty quickly by the waiter.  I'm not going to go through every step of the mean but we had to ask for bread two or three times before they brought it.  They told us it was being made fresh and yet we saw bread going out to other tables.  Not very cool guys.  If I'm eating Italian, I want my bread!  If I'm eating Mexican, I want my chips!  Fast!  The food was good all around.  I had risotto, my wife had ravioli, my bro had pasta carbonara, and his fiance had a salad and the antipasto platter.  No complaints on the food, and when we finally got the bread, it was piping hot and delicious.  I just wish this place would get it together and have some consistent service.  We waited  for the waiter to pick up the check for 12 minutes.  I timed it because that's the kind of guy I am.",

When we got there, we were welcomed and seated in a booth (we had a view of Las Vegas, it's a plus). They put a brown bag  in the table and when I opened the bag, it was two pieces of bread. I tried it, it was warm and soft and then someone came to my table and brought some balsamic vinegar and olive oil. Bread + Balsamic vinegar and oil = delicious.      For appetizer, we order Calamari Fritti. It was good, it has a lot flavor but it was a little greasy. The calamari was crunchy and easy to eat. The serving for the calamari is pretty decent.   For our entree, I ordered Linguine alla Vongole (clams and linguine w/ your choice of red or white sauce) and my boyfriend ordered Lobster Ravioli. My linguine alla vongole was so good. It has a lot of flavor and there was a lot of clams in my dish. My boyfriend also like his food. I asked my bf if I could have a little taste of it. The lobster ravioli was good and it has a lot of flavor but I didn't really taste the lobster, I would rather stick with what I had ordered.     The server and the service at this place was excellent. I would come back again!",

From the first email and call to Michael I had no desire or need to check into any other places.  (Most of the family was from out of town so we did not have any local experience w/ventanos) Michael was responsive and provided our quote in less than a day and another one with adjustments just as quickly.   The day of pick- up the food was ready to go at the time promised and was delicious!!!! The meatballs were huge! The lasagna and a bruschetta style pasta were fabulous - I just wish I'd been there the next day for left-overs!  There was a lot of food and the price was so reasonable.

The service was great and our server was very attentive, as well as the remaining staff. The food was delicious, and very reasonably priced. I had the steam clams, and chicken Marsala, which was very tasty! My wife had the fettuccine (spicy) which she found out was a bit more spicy then she wanted, but delicious as well! The thing that hooked us was the warm bread they serve when you sit down. We like to add some salt and pepper to our oil and vinegar to dip the bread in, and it met up to one of our favorite restaurants in California, Sisley. If anything, we'll be coming back just for that! We gave it a 4/5 only because a little live music(jazz, piano, etc etc) would have made it a better experience. Maybe we just came on a wrong night. We'll definitely be back.",

After we were seated, we were served a very nice bag of Italian bread with olive oil and balsamic vinegar.   Nice touch!    Our food order was taken quickly and we received our food within a reasonable amount of time.     The soup was a little bland and the Salad Caprise was a little warm.   My husband ordered the Spagetti Bolanase which was good.  We had to wait a very long time for the check and frequently requested the check be brought to our table.   20 minutes is really too long for a check to be presented after the meal, IMHO.

So..the host seems nice.. and the waiter we got was very attentive. He was a great waiter and made sure to always check on us.   So the bread that comes out to the table was fresh and hot! yum! the oil and vinegar they use was okay dipping but i prefer more of an oil and herb type sauce instead like other restaurants I've been to... or maybe even a soft butter would be nice.   I ordered a lobster bisque soup which was tasty and has lobster chunks in it.. i dipped the bread in it as well.. delishh! The plate I ordered was a pasta dish with a pink sauce but I asked them to add blackened shrimp to the dish... instead they turned the whole plate a spicy blacked dish! mehhh... not what I wanted but whatever.. could have been better if it was made the way I asked. Anyways there wasn't enough shrimp for the dish... maybe 5 shrimps?   So for the end of the meal I ordered a cappuccino ...very delicious! But the tiramisu was the WORST Ive ever had in my life! Lol.. Im a big tiramisu person and had many in my lifetime.. SKIP THE TIRAMISU in my opinion... not good! Even the presentation of the tiramisu was pitiful and messy. smh.   Overall I might give this place another try if I'm in the area... but nothing I will go out of my way to go to...",

So I sent it back as even when I ordered I was told that instead of just zucchini mixed vegetables was an \"option.\"  After the plate was returned there were 2 small pieces of broccoli added to the zucchini.  Not exactly accommodating.  However, it got much worse.  I took one bite of my salmon and it was so dry that it was hard to swallow.  I finally poured a bit of olive oil on it just to get it down.  Since we were invited to a birthday dinner by our friend I did not send it back.  The birthday cake was brought out and we were very clear that only 5 out of 6 of us wanted a slice.  (I'm on a diet, remember).  So following instructions, they brought out 4 slices and the rest of the cake in a box.  After I mentioned they were were one slice short the waiter went back into the kitchen - without the cake!  After several minutes I just grabbed a plate from an empty table and the problem was solved.  Again, minutes later the manager came over but it was too late.  Terrible communication and followup.  First, my dry overcooked salmon came withe mixed veggies that the manager suggested.  Then they waited forever to even come back to cut another slice of cake.  On the way out I did tell the manager and hope he took the salmon off my friend's bill but I have no way to know.  We won't accept any other invitations to eat at this place.  How they have so many people giving high markets who apparently don't have any taste for quality is beyond me.",

    "text": "Ventano's one of my semi-regular haunts in Henderson for great Italian. However, I will not be doing a regular review! This review is special -- yesterday my family and I had made reservations to bring a large group if our family and friends, 15 people total, to celebrate my recent graduation from UNLV. So my review will focus specifically on the service and the menu we had for that occasion!  As my mother was setting up the decorations, we all went over early to set up everything for the event, well before our guests started to arrive. Michael, the manager, was extremely attentive and helpful, getting our drinks and helping make sure we were comfortable and ready for the big event.  During the entire event, the regular diners here would come streaming in until the restaurant was busy, and even then we still had spectacular service. Truly wonderful!  Anyway, on to the food -- we had something of a prix fixe menu for the occasion, starting with bruschetta, calamari and their famous shrimp on the stone, along with plenty of their breadsticks. Everyone ate to their satisfaction, and it was all so good -- the shrimp and calamari both got rave reviews in particular! The Caesar and classic salads that we had for everyone also went down treats, as well.  For the main courses, we had five choices -- spaghetti with meatballs, chicken fettuccine Alfredo, fettuccine con funghi, linguine alla vongole, and chicken parmigiana. Of the choices, I discovered that the fettuccine con funghi was the most popular, with over half of our table ordering it and some of the guests taking the leftovers home for later! This isn't to say that all of the pasta wasn't good -- I saw clean plates for some of our guests -- but the fettucini con funghi was the most popular by far.  For our dessert, Michael recommended that we get a dessert buffet setup where we had a little bit of everything come out -- tiramisu, cheesecake, spumoni, zeppoli, and chocolate cake -- and OMIGOD, was it the best decision we made. Everyone was applauding and cheering at the dessert -- we had three total trays of dessert come out -- and one of my guests perfectly described us all as having larger eyes than stomachs! Even though we were all full or almost full at that point, we all ate to our satisfaction. Needless to say, we were all stuffed and very happy with the service, the meal, everything!  There's a good reason why Ventano is such a mainstay here in Henderson since its establishment in 2003: solid food, a great atmosphere, and great service make it impossible for people to stay away for long! Throughout our meal, we were attended to often and we had such a great and relaxing time wining and dining with friends. Whether you want to dine by yourself or with a few or a lot of guests, Ventano is the place to be!",

    "text": "Well dinner last night was extremely disappointing.  The primary word I would use is BLAND.  It was not different than my middle schooler could cook for us at home but at an average of $25 per entree.  I say this with sadness because as a local we used to love this restaurant.  Calamari for appetizer.  No seasoning.  We salted it and then dipped it into the marinara sauce that tasted like it was out of a grocery store.  The 5 of us finished less than half of this appetizer.  Bread.  Boring.  Ventano bread used to be amazing!!  No longer.  It's OK but nothing special. Again, we left more than half and with high schoolers/middle schoolers who love bread... that's saying something.   Chicken Spedidini.  This used to be the dish that I craved from Ventano!!!  The reason I always wanted to come back.  These were over-cooked chicken blocks.  I ate about 3 bites and no one at the table wanted the rest.  We ordered 4 other pasta and veal dishes and all were.. meh.  Not bad, but nobody cleaned their plate.  I will say that portion sizes are huge so that may be attractive for some patrons??    Overall, it was probably the most boring dinner I have had in years.  Service was good but without good food what is the point??",

    "text": "I really wanted to like this place with all the reviews and rewards it's received but it fell very short of all the claims.  We went there on a Wednesday afternoon around 430 in the afternoon. There was only one table when we got there. The server who seemed to be the only one on duty greeted us and told us to take a chair anywhere. He presented us with menus and went and spoke with the other table for about 10 minutes before coming back and taking our drink order.  Another 10 minutes went by before we got our drinks and we were missing half for drinks to begin with. We only got glasses of water and not the ice tea that we asked for. Literally 25 minutes went by after we have placed our order before we got some breadsticks in a paper bag. We went with the recommendations and had a small half house salad, the beef carpaccio, the chicken marsala and the manicotti.  We were there for total of 35 minutes before any of our appetizers came out. The beef carpaccio I gave a 5/5. The aioli that comes on it, a mustard blend, and the fresh arugula with some shaved Parmesan was absolutely delicious. The salad wasn't all that impressive. Some mixed greens with some tomatoes and a vinaigrette. 3/5.  The restaurant started to become full around 445, 5 o'clock. Within about 20 minutes they had seven table sat. Only one server and two bussers for the entire restaurant. Between five and 530 we only saw our waiter one time. We finally got our main course almost an hour after being there. Mind you for about half an hour we were the only table in there.  Let's start with the chicken marsala. Horrible. Noodles were beyond under cooked. Secondly the chicken was very inconsistent. Some parts were rubbery and chewy and some pieces were overcooked and tough. We counted four pieces of mushroom total in the marsala sauce. This was horrible and we didn't touch it. We gave this a 1/5. The pastor noticed we didn't like it and asked if we would like anything else and we politely declined. We were fine paying for the entree but he told us he would take it off.  The manicotti was a 3/5. Nothing special. Bland red sauce with shells stuffed with a standard ricotta cheese blend. And honestly tasted like they had prepped it earlier on in the week and just kept frozen. Nothing special at all. Good portion size though, as it came with four pieces.  The poor server was definitely overrun with as many tables as he had. Overall service was lacking, food was mediocre at best and we probably won't be going back.",

By the time we were done with our early dinner it had gotten crowded but to my surprise it remained relatively low on noise. I had the pasta with shrimp and indeed it was prepared to perfection. The lobster bisque was amazing. It was served in a bread bowl. I recommend they serve that bread instead of the one they toss in a paper bag as a starter. Kids' pizza and pasta was superb as well. I wish our server had mentioned that they have specials. Omitting this important part of a dining experience was not pleasant and I will make sure to be on the lookout next time around.",

They were kind enough to seat us right in front of the huge window with a perfect view of the strip. I felt so bad we came in 30 mins before the dining room closed, the hours were off on Yelp. We offered to come back again another night and they absolutely insisted we stay.    We ordered a glass of sauv and Jameson both perfect. For food I ordered the mussels in a tomato basil sauce and the bf ordered the shrimp scallop linguini in a pink sauce. He switched the pasta out for angel hair. He fell absolutely in love with that dish, I admit it was pretty spectacular. I love mussels but the mussels here could use a little more flavor, maybe garlic. But best believe I ate it all lol.

The bartender and fellow patrons couldn't have been any nicer! They made me feel very welcome and comfortable to be there. One of the other diners at the bar likened it to the Cheers bar. I can completely agree with that as they all seem to know each other and enjoyed spending time together. It's always a good sign when the same people keep coming back to the same place! Something must be right!  I kept seeing and smelling appetizing dishes all around me. Even though I didn't intend to necessarily eat there, I couldn't resist.   I started with a half dozen oysters on the half shell. So good!  Very fresh and chilled just the way I like them. They were served with cocktail sauce and horseradish and they were both good.   Next I had the appetizer portion of the meatballs. Outstanding!  Loved the sauce they were in and they were accompanied by some warm bread served in a paper bag. Delicious!  I look forward to my next visit in the very near future. Thanks Archie and Richard!",

    "text": "My experience with Ventano's started the day before when I called to make a reservation.  A male by the name of Adam answered the phone and took my reservation.  He was very polite and helpful.  I explained it was my wife and I's anniversary and I heard they had an amazing view.  He promised the view and took down it was our anniversary.    I must say Ventano's is a different venue than I was used to.  It is a large stand-alone restaurant with a separate bar, situated by itself with an incredible view of the Las Vegas Strip and sunset.  We drove 40 minutes to try Ventano's and the view alone was worth it.  It was 6 pm on a Friday night, the dining area was busy and three hostesses greeted us cheerfully.  They said congratulations on your anniversary and gave us the option of a fabulous booth by the window with the view or patio dining with the view, my wife chose the booth inside.  I should also mention there is a full bar with video poker machines to the right as you enter.  You might miss it because it is closed off by a glass door and you can't see it from the restaurant.  Quite interesting.    The theme of the dining area is very Italian indeed.  It is well decorated and rather large.  Now, we did not know going in how fancy it actually was, I can say there isn't much of a dress code and it is kid friendly.  You can eat Ventano's dressed casually if you like.  This does not take away from the service though.  The service makes it feel like fine dining.    Our server's name was Danielle.  Danielle was very helpful and quite nice.  She was a pleasure to have as a server.  With her help we chose these wonderful \"rice balls\" for an appetizer, I don't remember their Italian name now.  I had a Sierra Nevada Beer Camp IPA which they had on draft, followed by a glass of red wine which Danielle recommended.  Very pleased with both.  They bring you out bread sticks in a paper bag with oil and vinegar, these are dangerously good.  The wife and I ordered the classics, a Chicken Parm and an Eggplant Parm.  Her Chicken Parm was perfect and my Eggplant Parm might have been the best I have had in Vegas.  It was plated very uniquely and the sauce, cheese, breading and thickness of the eggplant was perfect.  All the portion sizes were massive.  For dessert we had the Creme Brulee which came highly recommended and met the recommendation with ease.  We enjoyed the view throughout the sunset and as we sat for almost two hours we were never rushed or made to wait.  The staff played off our pace perfectly.  In summary, the quality of the food for the price is unequaled, it is not overly fancy, so if that is what you want this isn't the place.  I can tell you the long drive was well worth it and we will be back.  We have a new favorite Italian spot.",

Had the pleasure of being helped by a very well spoken young man named Austin who was extremely attentive and helpful. Started w the Caesar salad based on a previous Yelp review and it was amazing. Delicious. I had the fettuccine and my date had the cioppino (assorted seafood in a tomato wine broth) which she loved.   And for dessert... o em gee... house made tiramisu. Holy cow. So delicious. All of this with the beautiful view of Vegas just hit the spot. Make a reservation if your dining in for dinner. Great spot.",

We were greeted by server Adam, who was very friendly and pleasant to deal with. Started with some lamb chops on the hot rock which was fantastic. Wife got the shrimp scampi that came with risotto. The shrimp unfortunately were nothing special but at least they were a decent medium size and the risotto was absolutely perfect.  I got a cup size (doesn't show that they have a cup size on the menu but was told by the server it was available, as well as a bread bowl) clam chowder and it was absolutely amazing. The soup was delightfully chunky and full of flavor. The ingredients (clams, potatoes and prosciutto) were all diced into tiny pieces. I think this was the key to the amazing flavor. I also had the Caesar salad that had their own homemade dressing with anchovies blended into it. I had them add anchovies on top of the salad also and it was just the right balance of saltiness to compliment the salad. Our kid got Mac and cheese which was very creamy and buttery, not dry at all (kids menu) and we finished our meal with a beautiful tiramisu that was loaded with booze! Thank you for the end of a wonderful evening.",

We did just that.   My boyfriend and I arrived to find that we were the only ones in the restaurant. That's when I realized that normal Americans were at home watching the game.   We were given the choice to seat wherever we liked by our server, Carlos. This was very nice and romantic, which was what I was going for.    When we were given the wine menu Adam showed up with a delicious sample of a Red Zinfandel. I thought it was a very appropriate wine and I was leaning towards choosing it But my boy friend decided another wine would be a better idea. I don't know which wine that Adam helped him decide on, but whatever it was, it was perfect.   The bag of bread has been my favorite since I was a kid.  I've been coming here since the doors opened and I have always looked forward to their bag of bread with olive oil and balsamic dipping.   We ordered calamari and shrimp on stone(also a favorite since day one). Delicious!!! The calamari was perfection. Nice big pieces. The shrimp was perfectly cooked.  The stone is perfect for keeping it nice and hot while you enjoy it. The marinara for the calamari was so delicious. Great fresh flavor. The calamari had another sauce that was delicious. The shrimp had two amazing sauces that I wasn't sure what they were but they were amazing.   I was recommended the steak with potatoes, green beans, and jumbo shrimp. I say the steak because I forget what kind of steak. Either way, it was so delicious. I can't believe how amazing it was.  My boy friend had the chicken parmesan. Perfectly al dente pasta. Deliciousness.   Our entire meal was epic and both of our servers were amazingly friendly and knowledgable of the menu. I felt quite at home.   My boyfriend was impressed and I was shown that nothing has changed since this place opened.  It always been amazing. Great memories. Such a romantic atmosphere. Perfect for date nights, family dinners, and even large groups.   I was overly pleased with my visit and will be sure to be back soon.",

We then waited 35 minutes for our food. The waiter offered us free dessert for the wait- the restaurant was not busy. He asked if 1 of our party wanted more wine and they said yes but the wine did not arrive until after he finished eating so he turned the wine away. Our waiter also stood behind us when speaking to us which was very odd- 2 of our party could not see him as he spoke. The food was good but we will not return.",

We go here to eat at least once a month and every time we have a visitor from out of town we bring them here and they all LOVE it and request to go back the next time they visit! Great wine selection, great bruschetta, I always get the eggplant parm (comes with your choice of pasta) or the ravioli (I'm a vegetarian) and my husband gets the chicken parm (comes with your choice of pasta) or the salmon (comes with veggies and mashed potato), everything is ALWAYS fantastic. They give you hot bread right out of the oven when you sit down which is delicious with the olive oil and vinegar. You can sit outside at night for a great view of Vegas which is always romantic :) The staff are all great and the manager is always walking around making sure all of the customers are happy. I've tried many many italian restaurants in Vegas and Ventano's is by far the best of the best. If you are planning to go on a weekend for dinner be sure to make a reservation as it can get really busy. Hope you enjoy this place as much as I do!",

We all raved about the quality of our meals. They even served a last minute special meal (salmon) to one of the diners with dietary restrictions.

    "text": "Overall, nice local place to enjoy with A-1 View.  View - OK, the view is better than the food, but that is because it is a great view.  Reservationists - The staff taking reservations are generally very nice and pleasant.  Local restaurant, Doesn't seem to have a database to remember you by, or to promote their restaurant to you for more visits.  Ambiance - Very nice overall. From very casual and family in shorts to business / smart casual or more.  Parking - Great and easy.  Food - Stone crab appetizers are great. Mussels are wonderful. All the food here is good. Anything outstanding, naw, but overall, you will never go wrong.  The Baby Back Ribs were quite a pleasant surprise and I would recommend this to anyone that is not sure what they want.   The Cioppino is something not on all menus and this is a nice dish.  I tend to measure a great Italian Restaurant by it's Osso Bucco, but this is not on the menu. Plenty of other good t hings though.  Check it out you will be happy.",

Arnauld, Mike and the entire staff strive diligently to ensure each guest has a wonderful dining experience. And it shows!! Tonight, we were served by Adam and Adrian. We had barely been seated when Adrian appears at our table with our drinks. No, we did not have to tell him what we wanted ... they already knew. Where else can one find this kind of service? Amazing attention to detail! We dined on the special this evening, Filet Mignon with scalloped potatoes, green beans and grilled shrimp. The steak was so tender and juicy it just melted in your mouth. And, the scalloped potatoes? Simply divine! Please give Ventano's a try. You'll be glad you did!",

I have been in the service industry for 20 plus years now and this was the WORST EXPERIENCE I HAVE EVER HAD at a restaurant. Period. I wanted to put this part last, but it needs to be read first. They make you split your bill and figure out the tax yourself. They blame it on the POS system that's, \"new and doesn't allow us to split checks unless you want to wait for 45 minutes.\" Riiiiiiiiiiiiiiight..... The new technology doesn't allow for spilt checks.... Being a server myself, the only time that this happens is when the computer system is down/offline, or because I didn't check to see of the party was splitting their checks at the beginning. I even told the server that my girlfriend and I were together on one check, which was recognized by our server with a head shake and an, \"I've got you.\" Nothing. It took us more than 45 minutes to split the parties check up, figure out our tax that needed to be added and then pay. All without a manager ever coming to see how things were. I can't believe it. And it was birthday party. We were a semi-big party of 15 people for my friends birthday dinner. He's actually a regular, or was, before this pathetic experience happened. We get there and everything is fine at the beginning. The server does his job for the first round.  Drinks arrived and were NEVER offered to be refilled. How can a server NEVER OFFER TO REFILL YOUR BEVERAGE the entire evening??? Not even the soda/pop. Then the food comes. No seasoning on the shrimp, not even salt. Fine, we muscle through the mediocrity. It was the least offensive part of the overall experience. Next, the cake that my friend's wife purchased for him was treated with the utmost disrepect possible. The first piece came out, looked nice as an end piece. Then the food runner put the plate on top of the birthday cards that my friend was opening for his birthday, as he's opening them. Really, dude?? You're just going to drop his cake on top of all of his cards and gifts?? AMATEUR HOUR. The rest of the pieces looked to have been thrown on the plate, literally. She spent all of that money on a cake just to have it destroyed by the server(s)/Edward-Scissor-Hands that cut and plated it. Zero excuses for that. Incredibly disrespectful and completely unacceptable. The right thing would be to reimburse my friend for that cake. The ONLY SAVING GRACE, is that the owner was not there that evening to take responsibility for his decision in a new computer system or to help his server(s) out. This was the server simply not caring. I certainly hope that the owner will fix these major flaws in his restaurant and teach his servers respect for guests, especially on their birthday.",

I have been going to Ventano's since they opened in 2003 and I fell in love with their food from the first time I ate there.   Tucked away in a quiet, residental area you will find Ventano's. Perfectly perched on a small hill with breathtaking views of Las Vegas. Sit on the patio with your honey for a nice romantic dinner or dine inside the restaurant where the lights are dimmed and gaze out the window to see the dazzling strip lights at night. Try the \"shrimp on the stone\" for a yummy appetizer to start with, crack open a bottle of delightful Riesling, taste the delicious entrees (Rigatoni Portafino is my fav), and of course indulge in dessert.   The have a good sized kids menu. My munchkin enjoys their delicious cheese pizza (Mommy enjoys it too, sssssh!). I normally don't eat the crust on my pizzas but boy, I sure do here.  The staff is excellent on checking back on your table to make sure you are satisified and the owner comes table to table to ask how your experience is going. Sign up online to receive discounts and the occasional free appetizer or look for flyers in the mail. They also have a large back room for parties and events. Our company had our 2009 Christmas party at Ventano's and it was the best one yet! They have an extensive wine list, gaming in the bar, and a menu full of delicious food. You NEED to check them out!   Bon appetit :)",

I also favor their steamed mussels very much- their white wine, garlic and herb broth is absolutely mouth watering... Their lobster ravioli is also amazing. One complaint though, for the amount they charge for their food... quite high end, I am VERY disappointed in their presentation, their plates (were chipped and flowers were faded and had knife scrapes) and platters are the kind you find at outlets.. their silverware isn't very clean. And their presentation lacks creativity. If you are a high end restaurant serving expensive food, you'd think you could serve your food on high caliber, top of the line plates and platters. Charge me $40 for a steak (yes quite delicious) then give me garlic bread in a paper bag. Eh.",

She goes to seat the couple in front of us and then DOES NOT RETURN FOR 10 minutes. Wth? Did she seat the couple and then go on break? Anyways she finally comes back and asks if we have a reservation. We let her know that we do not and she says that's it's ok and she can seat us. We decided to sit outside and she took us to our table which was a little dirty and unkept but whatever she said she will send someone over to clean up. She gives us the menus and said someone will be right over. Looking at the menu, this place is WAY OVERPRICED.....$21 dollars for gnocchi?? This is just some bar/restaurant behind a gas station and there prices are like a fine Italian restaurant at the Wynn....Anyways, 10 more minutes pass and no one has come over to take our drink order or \"clean up\" the table yet. So we end our misery and just get up and leave. This place needs a strong manager and if they have someone in charge, they need to replace that person.",

We got a window seat to see the fireworks on the strip and the neighboring casinos.  There seemed like 3 waitress & waiters, with 10 bus-boys running around. Our waters and soda never went dry but we waited over 30minutes to get our desserts and another 15 to get the bill. Honestly I can't remember my meal because I was so annoyed with how poor the service was.  I gave one star because the Tiramisu was pretty good. Otherwise I will not be going there again....

Crazy, since I'm originally from Chicago in which the weather is good approximately 5 days a year (insert  sarcasm here) and yet there is a patio on every other eating establishment.  Anyway, I digress....  Let's start off with the view - fan-flipping-tastic!  If you find yourself in Henderson this is the place for a great view of the strip and also a nice sunset.  The patio has heaters and misters, too!  Now the food - the shrimp appetizer on the rock was okay, differnet and good sauce.  Just didn't blow me away.  BF had the lobster ravioli and loved it.  My first visit I had the dish with chicken/mushrooms/pasta that is baked - yummy!  The second visit I had the rigatoni portofino - super yummy!  The bf must have really liked the lobster rav a bunch since he had it on the second visit, too!  As for the food, what did blow me away was the grilled romaine salad.  It has gorgonzola cheese and proscuitto and OMG - it does rock my world!  I may have to try this at home, which I am sure won't be quite as good as this.  This is as good as it gets!  Its a large salad so we did share (2 of us).    GREAT wine list and VERY reasonable prices. Friendly staff, servers and GM.   Look forward to going to a wine dinner, which the GM indicated they have every now and again if we get on the mail list.  So we did!  He indicated they are usually on Fridays.  Go for the view and stay for the food....and can't forget some good decent priced wine, too!",

Started with the calamari which had too much breading so I could barely taste the good quality squid. For main course it was risotto Milanese which was amazing. So this is when the service got weird, I told them ahead of time is was a bday dinner so I was expecting a simple ice cream or whatever but instead we got tiramisu-but I had ordered that for myself not for my mom. So remember to order ALL your desserts not what you think your going to get just because it's someone's bday. And to top it off I didn't get my doggie bag of my unfinished risotto, I think they tossed it even though the waiter specifically said he was having it bagged up. I guess he was more interested in checking us out rather than making sure we were being taken care of. So I doubt I will come back here ever again.  Two stars because of the service, would have been four because the food was decent but these days service is 50% of the experience.",

    "text": "Ventano's has been our favorite southern Italian restaurant since it first opened.   Although this was a Friday night, the restaurant was not as busy as usual.  We took a pass on the bread and shared a delicious spinach salad with onions, hard boiled egg and mushrooms in a warm bacon dressing.  As is customary, we shared our an eggplant rollatini, but the portion size had been reduced by 50% and the ricotta filling was a memory compared to prior visits.  It was initially served in one dish, as opposed to 2 in the past, and the amount of marinara was barely covered the top of the eggplant.  I had ordered a side of sauteed spinach in order to approximate the value of our Groupon, but the waiter substituted it for the usual sides of ziti so we were forced to order a creme brulee.  LOL Unfortunately it was overcooked and very disappointing.  I don't know whether we caught the restaurant on a bad night or not, but I am not inclined to rush back.",

We've held our company Christmas party here the last couple of years (the last one being just this last Friday night) and we couldn't be happier with Michael and his staff.

Understand the glare but those last few minutes of the sunset, they should just pull the curtains aside. Glare was long gone. Family friendly. House photographer is a sure sign that this is a tourist trap - $15 for a photo, no thanks. I will point out that the porch is magnificent.

    "text": "We made reservations for Valentine's Day 3 weeks in advance and when we checked in with the hostess 10 minutes early we were told in a not so nice way that we would have to wait until our reservation time to be seated and to wait over by the Oyster Bar which we did not know where it was.  We saw a bar but no indication that it was a Oyster Bar as it had at least 50 dirty wine glasses stacked on it.  Once our name was called which we were identified by incorrectly we were seated by another hostess who too was not very nice.  When she showed us to our table, there was no place settings.  The hostess then slammed down the place settings which included a dirty bread plate.  When the busboy came by to bring us water, I showed him the plate and requested a new one.  No problem.  While looking at our menus a \"runner\" came to our table with another table's salads trying to give them to us, we informed him that we had not ordered yet.  The busboy then came by to check on us and realized that we had not ordered, he then called over the waiter.  The waiter came and took our drink order and brought it to us, then took our dinner order.  That was the only time we saw our waiter until I requested him at the end of our dinner to show him that I had foreign object in my wine glass that had came out of the carafe.  His comment to us was that it must had come out of the \"machine\".  Based on what we saw when we came in at the Oyster Bar, I am assuming he used a dirty carafe to pour my wine into.  He offered a new glass of wine at no charge, but by that time I was pretty grossed out.  When brought the new glass of wine he also brought our check, no offer of dessert.  It was like hurry up and get out of here.    While eating, we noticed a table behind us who had been seated before us that had not been served until after we were and they too complained stating that they would be leaving if their food did not arrive in 5 minutes.  We also noticed that none of the candles were lit on the tables throughout the restaurant.  This was Valentine's Day and we and others were treated as it was not a special day, which it should have been.  When walking out, we overheard a couple of patrons mentioning that they too were not happy with the food and service.    Overall, the food was mediocre, nothing special, over priced and the staff with the exception of the busboy were rude and not attentive.  We were highly disappointed in our experience as we expected a nicer restaurant with great service and food. I highly doubt that we would ever come back to this restaurant based on this experience.  There are far more Italian restaurants in town that are better to choose from.",

It was close to 9:00 pm when we arrived and our waiter asured us that it was not a problem to serve us.  I have unfortunately lost our receipt with his name on it otherwise I would mention him in this review.  Wonderful service from a server who knows what he's doing and seemingly enjoys his job.  There were five of us in the party, maybe he will be located in that fashion.  Anyway, we ordered beverages for dinner including a bottle of Ca'Nani cabernet that was very delicious.  I mentioned that two of us would be sharing a chicken parm dinner and a carbonara dinner.  The others ordered either veal or chicken parm.  When dinner arrived, the two shared plates had been plated with half of each entree on each plate.  Now that's what I call awesome service from someone that paid attention.  We all loved, loved, loved our meals. None of us felt pressure to hurry up and get the heck out, as it was past 10:00 when we were finished with our meals. The service remained terrific throughout the evening and the view was spectacular.  We will definately be returning to this gem and if I have my way, it will be very, very soon.",

Great lunch menu and we are never dissapointed. My wife loves the chicken sandwich, with pasta salad. I will usually have the same, but with coleslaw. Hot fresh bread is served in a bag as a starter and then everything is just fantastic from there on. Always good service although sometimes they may be slightly short handed at lunch time if they are caught off guard and the place fills up, but don't worry about it. The crew is very good! Nice views and modern/rustic decor. They have a private banquet room that was built a year or so ago and that is great for big gatherings. Just a excellent place that we can always count on and bring friends and family when we don't want to drive all over town for dinner. A hidden gem in Henderson!",

Then our *new* server came to finish our order for the entrees. When our food was delivered, my entree was completely wrong, he admitted to me that he pressed the wrong button, honest mistake. That was the last of him, I didn't receive my meal till after the rest of my party had finished theirs, and our *new new* server came to drop off our check.  The food was good, I had the lobster ravioli, and my one of my friends had the mahi mahi special. This place is priced moderately, and the view is pretty nice.

I don't understand how people can say the food is bland,  I'm Italian from an Italian family and I've been to a lot of Italian restaurants and have eaten Italian food my whole life, this place by far has the best tasting sauce, I wish I knew thier secret. The dining room has a lot of seating and the staff is always friendly and when they mention you by name shows class.

We were told they had immediate seating and ended up waiting 15 mins for a table. Finally we sat down and orders drinks. Waited a little for the server to come back to order our food. We ordered shrimp on the hot stone, chicken piccata and manicotti. The only good thing about this dinner was the shrimp. Very tasty and cooked perfectly. However the entrees were horrible!!!! I couldn't eat the manicotti right away bc it was still bubbling hot. I did ask for some more bread while I waited for it to cool. Never got the bread. Then when I did eat the manicotti it was so salty that I couldn't eat it! And the piccata was salty as well. We wanted to complain but our waiter was nowhere to be found. Fed up we just wanted  our food to go and leave. Oh I had veggies also. They were mush and the waiter forgot to box them. The only reason I boxed it to go is maybe my dogs could have a bite. I left feeling bloated and disappointed. Never again.",

The view of the strip in the distance is BY FAR the best attribute of the restaurant.  In fact, they have a patio that would have been nice to have dined on but it was still too cold and windy to do so.  We look forward to coming back and having a glass of wine out there.  However, I'm not sure we will be ordering much food on our next trip as it was just ok.  A bit pricy for what you get too.  Should a 4 inch by 4 inch piece of lasagna served a la carte worth $18.50? The food was good, but a bit bland.  But certainly not like Olive Garden as some have stated.  Much better than that!!!  Like other reviewers stated, the service was good.  And it was quite busy for a Tuesday night as well.  I look forward to coming back to the patio, but just to order wine, appetizers and to enjoy the fantastic view.",

    "text": "I tried to go at Sunset, had reservations at 6:30pm and we were immediately seated. Finally the sunset at the very end of dinner. Next time I'd go at 7pm. Seeing the strip lit up was nice. Ask for a window booth so you can see the sunset and lights on the strip, or else sit outside on the patio.  One of us had the shrimp pasta fra diavolo. Very hot! I eat jalapenos and such, this was much hotter. Make sure that you can take really hot food. Another had the lasagna. Wow! Very good! I would highly recommend this. I had the Ventano Tortellini. It is cheese tortellini with chicken and mushroom in pink sauce. It is very tasty. The three meals, no drinks, after taxes were $64.  From the menu online, it appears that the lunches are the same thing for about $5 cheaper. Not sure if the serving sizes are the same or not though. And no sunset view would come with that either. Good food. You need to try it.",

    "text": "Really, really disappointed. The view is great, the atmosphere nice. But it took a while to get the food, and it's a Wednesday night, probably not one of their peak days. I ordered angel hair pasta with pink sauce and meatballs. Most of my meatballs had a tough charred spot, not yummy. And the pink sauce had an odd flavor. My husband ordered a dish that had \"large\" shrimp (which still had the tails on, one of my husband's pet peeves), pasta in a lemon butter sauce, which had a vague burnt flavor, as if they cooked the butter too long. It also came with a side of these chicken rolls that had mozzarella and parmesan in them, and were crusted. Unfortunately, super dry and not tasty. My husband and I barely ate our dishes, and we're still hungry. All we ordered was our dishes and water, which cost us a whopping $48 and some change. I've never dined and dashed, but boy did I want to! It hurt to pay for this meal! We won't be back, and if I were you, I'd go elsewhere. :(",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I got a Groupon deal for this place after reading all the great reviews.  I would have to say this place is HIGHLY overrated.  In my opinion it's nothing more than an slightly upscaled Olive Garden.  I personally would have rather gone to Macaroni Grill.    The bread in bags wasn't exciting at all, nothing special about the bread and I don't really think it's a \"cute\" idea to have bread in paper bags in a \"fine dining\" restaurant.  Cheap presentation in my opinion.  The appetizer we got was the lamb chops which were extremely bland, no seasoning and no sauce.  We seasoned them ourselves with salt and pepper to make them edible.  Definitely not recommended.  I will say our entree's were good.  I got the Fettuccini con Funghi, the shrimp was huge, the sauce was great.  My boyfriend got the Lobster Ravioli.  They weren't cheap with the lobster stuffing, and the sauce was great as well.  The entree's are about $20 a plate, give or take.  I would recommend both of those plates if you do decide to eat here.  The decor was cheesy.  I don't like the look of the walls, they try to make them look like the old buildings in Italy, did a poor job.  It just make the restaurant look cheap. The lighting is very dim, which I did like, it made for a great date setting.  And there is a beautiful view of the strip.  It would be nice to sit outside during the springtime with the view this restaurant has.   The service was pretty good, I'd give the service 4 stars.  We made reservations and still had to wait a good 15 - 20 minutes for a table, so this place is very busy.    We got an appetizer, 2 entrees & a bottle of wine ($40, which is $20 in stores, typical I guess - It was a Cab called Decoy. I was a fan, boyfriend didn't like it) and the bill was $110.  I wouldn't consider this \"fine dining\" what-so-ever, we could have spent half the price at Macaroni Grill and probably had a better meal overall.  But with all the other great reviews I guess it would be worth giving this place a try and seeing for yourself.",

The only place that is better is the Foudation Room at Mandalay Bay or maybe the Stratosphere. The service is always great and the food is even better. I highly recommend the 'Shrimp on the Stone' appetizer, it is amazing with its side of wasabi cream sauce. My favorite entree is the 'Chicken Spiedini'. This is an awesome place to go with the fam, friends, or for a nice dinner and can be casual or fancy.",

The staff is friendly and helpful with guiding you through the menu. The shrimp cooked on the hot stone is decent but definitely has it downfalls. 1. The shrimp are small so cook quickly and can burn if you are not quick enough. 2. I can't tell of there are the frozen precooked shrimp 3. The sauces that come with them are a \"different \" despite its downfalls it is still good just not something I must order every time. The calamari is outstanding in my top 3 best calamari in Vegas, fresh, tender, and tasteful. As far as the entree my favorites must have are the las ha and shrimp and garlic pasta. The ambience is nice to with beautiful views in the outdoor seating area. They also ha e a bar area where you can smoke if you're in to that",

    "text": "Part A We went here for a (semi-formal) wedding reception- the room was huge. The guest tables were round tables with chairs. Elegant ambiance. The food was excellent. The dish I remember the most is the grilled shrimp (so delicious) on the stone- when we saw the stones getting taken back with some shrimp left, we thought, \"What a waste!\" The staff, although busy, was excellent in their table service (several courses/sit down dinner). I hate when they start taking away plates when you're not done- but that didn't happen here. The event was well-organized as far as wedding receptions go. So, the four stars are strictly for the wedding reception and food.   Part B The location of the restaurant overlooking a sweeping view of the Las Vegas Strip was pretty strategic/smart. Didn't really witness it at this particular time (as it got dark- Part A), but we did notice it when having dinner with the in-laws (live on that side of town). Of course this was foiled since the restaurant was closed for an event, which was funny, because there should be a sign of some sort. Instead of, \"We're sorry, we're closed for an event. We're not really taking any more customers\" So we went to Carrabba's instead.",

Pasta itself was good, chicken was underwhelming and tasted off. My dinner partner got shrimp scampi; according to her it was average but the pasta was dry and could've used more sauce.  Would ordinarily be a three-star review but we both experienced upset stomachs not long after eating the meal.   Probably won't be going back.

    "text": "I'll go as much as say 2 1/2 stars.  That is based on the good things I experienced.    The good: The staff was pretty friendly and attentive.  We arrived on a Saturday Night at around 5 with no reservation.  Got in right away and had a great view of the city out on the patio.  The place seemed clean, comfy, and had a great ambiance.  It had a large wine list that had reasonable pricing.  We were greeted, offered drinks and had our picture take right away.  The bread was pretty delicious.  The entire meal the staff was attentive and polite.    Now the bad:  The food!!!! Not horrible...but not great.  I equate it to an Olive Garden on the wrong side of town. Matter of fact..Olive Garden would have been better.  Ok...so you're saying, what do I know about \"Italian food\"?.  Enough.  I love food...I've eaten all over the world and spent plenty of time trying to eat my way across New Jersey and New York.  Italian food is about simplicity....simple dishes that are seasoned well with fresh ingredients which allow you to taste every little nuance of the dish.  This food was bland.  The appetizer was ok.  1/2 pound grilled shrimp on a hot stone.  All good except for served with a side of honey mustard.  Save the sauce for chicken tenders.    My girlfriend ordered Chicken Scalopini.  The chicken a little tough and it was not seasoned...fine..it has a sauce with it right, but if the sauce is bland then all of it is bland.  Not that it tasted horrible...it just didn't taste like much...couldn't taste butter, wine, salt, herbs, anything really.  The spaghetti that came with it was tasty.  Al dente with a simple marinara.    I ordered the special which was NY strip steak, \"creamy polenta\", french green beans, and 3 blackened shrimp served on a hot stone.  I guess it was my fault for not keying in on \"hot stone\".  Steak came out cooked (and pre-sliced) to proper temperature of medium.  Although by the time I got through half the steak the other half had been cooked more to med-well, well by the hot stone.  Not to mention that again.....steak was bland! Ok it's steak...taste like meat....but some salt please.  Peppercorn sauce that was served with it was ok...very very peppery....I like pepper so I didn't mind but it could be a bit much for some.  Polenta was more bready than creamy and I think they confused Cajun with Blackened because shrimp were seasons with cajun seasoning but not blackend.  Maybe they assumed the hot rock would blacken the shrimp.  Which it did not...just over cook them.  Green beans were good.  The quality of the special was not worth the $34 price tag....which I didn't see until the bill.  My fault for not asking.  Just guessed since nothing else was over $28 it wouldn't be either.    Finally....The most tacky thing I've ever seen...which has been mentioned by others.  I paid with a debit card..as most do now a days.  They bring me a machine and have me swipe my own card...the kid says, \"you'll do it and I'll stand right here and watch\".  So as I swipe it asks for tip - 20%, 18% or other.  Service was good so I don't mind tipping....but as he hovers over me, I thought how awkward this would be if service was crap and he's hovering over me as I choose other and commence to put a smaller amount.  Just strange to me.    All and all I've been to worse places...but I've definitely been to better.  Food is just to blah...maybe I'll try again...prob not.",

Requested to sit by the window and although the building's wall covered part of our view, the view of the strip at night was breathtaking. The restaurant itself was fairly big and had a sense of warmth to it, unlike typical restaurants, Ventano felt like I walked into a house, homey feeling.  The food was delicious, my favorite was the lasagna that we had ordered and shared, family style dishes! We also received complimentary breadsticks, but was a little taken back that it came in a paper bag, not sure if that actually is better for the bread than the usual baskets. Anyways, our server, Adam, was amazing and a super sweet guy.  We also ended the night with dessert, Zeppole, I think it was. Baby doughnuts with Spumoni gelato and whip cream to top it off. Omg! One of the best desserts I have ever eaten! In the end, my mom enjoyed her birthday dinner and we had a great experience in both service and in food. Would definitely come back!",

It came with either Caesar or wedge salad, corn on the cob, baked potato and shrimp. Prime rib covered in gravy (au jus maybe.. Not gravy please), corn was not sweet so sent it back but it was still old and flavorless, potato ok.  Now for $40 bucks you'd think at least jumbo shrimp. These may have been before they were cooked down to a shrunken over done, dry, swimming in gravy sz 40. The service was still on point. All servers were very pleasant and accommodating. My daughter liked her side of risotto. (They could have made it smaller since it was a side) and less pricey. And, the shrimp on the stone was as tasty as ever. We'll return but next time will ask more question..$..presentation.. Temp on the shrimp.",

We held it in their private room and everything went smoothly from drinks to dessert. I just want to say thanks Ventanos for helping make a very difficult time a little easier.",

    "text": "I feel like i have a brick in my stomach, and i ate less than half my entree.   With such rave reviews i was bound to find myself here eventually. Unfortunately, this was a case of me reading the wrong reviews obviously. From the photos you would think that the dining room is nice, which it's not really. Very dated, and in need of a bit of restyle for the price of the menu. The view is worthwhile, but you need to dim the lighting in the dining room so there isn't so much of a glare and you can actually see the view better. Service was in a word, sloppy. When I was seated the salt/pepper and other items on the table were a bit thrown around because i chose to sat facing the view. My waiters shirt was about 4 sizes too big for him and looked very untidy. And when the waiter mentioned he would return with bread sticks to the table, he never did. All small items but at the cost of the menu, i would expect more. I ordered the Carbonara $21, and it was incredibly heavy with way too much cheese and just felt a mess when eating. I could only stomach about a 1/3 of it and asked for a box for the rest which actually was tossed on my way out the door as i knew i wouldn't eat it later. Never again, and i hope i can save others who are looking for a quality Italian meal.   If you are looking for a HUGE portion, with very heavy food, with a very mediocre ambiance and service then this is your spot. A tip for anyone who likes a good Carbonara like myself, try Otto at the Venetian $22 and its quite delicious with top service and a great atmosphere.",

I'm Sicilian and, at least according to my family and friends, a really good Italian cook.  The food here all tasted home made - like I would make it myself.  I do not like over-sauced, red-checked tablecloth, Italian-style food.  This was fine cooking.  Plus, the place is quiet, pretty and anyplace that has a sign in the front advising people to keep their children seated is A-1 in my book.",

    "text": "We went to Ventano early for lunch on a Monday, around 11:30.  We were the only people in the dining room, but another table sat down after about 10 minutes.  The server approached us after a few minutes, which is understandable as they were getting ready for the day.  She brought us drinks immediately and we didn't have to wait thereafter for refills.  To start, we tried the grilled shrimp on a stone.  This was a LOT of the small rock shrimp on a hot stone.  I was worried when I saw it was the rock shrimp, as those can easily be overcooked and rubbery.  But, these were fantastic.  Loads of garlic and very tender.  It comes with 2 sauces, a wasabi sauce and a sweeter type sauce.  The wasabi was definitely the winner, had just enough kick without being overpowering.  This was a very good appetizer, lots of food and quality.  Recommended.  To eat, I had the chicken spiednini, which is thin chicken cutlets rolled with cheese then fried.  The lunch portion is 3 pieces and comes with your choice of pasta.  I liked the dish, but it was dry in spots.  The sauce was very simple, heavy on tomato flavor.  It was not as strong as the appetizer.  The wife had clam chowder with caprese salad.  The clam chowder was fantastic, thick and hearty with good clam flavor.  The caprese was average, the balsamic was solid.  The tomatoes were not very juicy, but the cheese was of good quality.    We will definitely return, it was a great lunch with excellent service.",

He did not ask how our food was. He did not ask if we wanted more to drink (we had to flag down a busboy for that). He did not ask if we wanted a check. In fact, after he took our orders he  never came back by our table. It was almost funny--he would pass within inches of our table without acknowledging us. I was out of soda for 10 minutes before my grandparents asked a busboy for help.   Given the cost of the meal and the quality of the food, this restaurant can't afford to have such terrible service.",

I was looking for seafood and was informed by Adam of the daily orange roughy special with scallops. It was probably the best roughy and scallops I've had since dining on the east coast near sea ports.  For an appetizer, I had the calamari. It was good, but I've had better. Next time I will pick a different appetizer as they offer many. I had the cannoli's for dessert. The filling is made in the restaurant, and it is very good.   They have an extensive wine menu too! I had a glass of Chardonnay for $9.00, and I thought it was a decent pour for that price.    Adam offered exceptional service, and I really appreciate when servers take the time to pack my left overs instead of placing a to-go box on the table. Thanks Adam!   The restaurant has a bar with televisions, a separate room for social functions, and outdoor seating. The entree items are between $25-$30.",

The first time we went we went during lunch hours. Their lunch menu is definitely significantly smaller than their full dinner menu. But, you will still be able to find something you will enjoy.   The second time we went was for dinner and I definitely enjoyed the wider variety of options. As for their dishes, I feel like they're hit or miss. The lasagna was amazing and I will probably get it time and time again when we go back. There were a few appetizers I didn't love, but that won't stop me from going back and trying out a few more options on the menu. Their tiramisu is AMAZING!   I've had great service when there. The wait staff is personable and friendly with their patrons and I really appreciated that.   The best part about this place? The view!! Definitely one of the best restaurants with the best view of the strip. I can't wait to go back when the heat calms down a little bit and sit on the back porch outdoor seating they offer. I can imagine a wonderful sunset dinner happening at Ventano. The vibes this venue offers are definitely adaptive. This place would be great for a romantic dinner for two, but it could also be wonderful for a family night out. I will definitely be classing it up with my girlfriends one evening for a special occasion. All are welcome and all will feel welcome when eating at Ventano.",

Accompanied by a bottle of house Cabernet. All were outstanding. Cabernet was reasonable, $35 for full bottle. Entrees were $30 & $35. Very reasonable for high quality food & drink. Top notch service & phenomenal view. I highly recommend you dine here, a great culinary delight, worthy of the price.

Good Eggplant Parmigiana.  Good salads.  Good calamari.  Traditional Italian and Italian-American food.  Like, very \"this was made in grandma's kitchen\" kind of place.   Good restaurant.  Oh and super nice owners and servers. I always go with my parents when I go to visit them.  We're sort of \"regulars\" there.  Well my parents are--me only a few times a year.   Fairly decent prices.  Everything is expensive these days so relatively I think they're way better than average.   Mmmm.  Now I want their Lobster Bisque.",

Service was excellent but it should be -- there were very few customers.  I do hope the lunch trade is normally busier than today.  Now that I've had lunch here, I'd like to do so more often.  My Chicken Picatta was VERY good; much better than Buon Gusto's.  It comes with Linguini Picatta; perfect combination.  My husband enjoyed his Sausage & Peppers Wrap and he was pleased that the French Fries were crispy.  He was only able to eat half of his wrap and not all of the Fries.  I wasn't able to finish my lunch, either.  My friends, who dine at Ventano more often, knew to split a sandwich.  They started with a mushroom appetizer which was very tasty.  They shared that with the table.  The restaurant provides soft breaksticks with oil and Balsamic vinegar.  Our friends then had Ventano's special slaw and a sandwich which, as I said, they split.  It was the perfect amount of food for two seniors.  I'll keep that in mind going forward.  Great view.  Excellent service.  Very good food.  Not horrible prices.  Easy parking.",

    "text": "Let me start by saying that the food was good. The negative review is due to the service. We had a table of 4 on a Saturday afternoon at 4:30. It was not busy at that time. Our waiter introduced another person as his \"helper.\" 3 of our 4 meals were delivered by the helper but he said nothing about the 4th meal so we assumed it was on its way. We waited a while to eat but still  nothing. The waiter never came by to see if everything looked okay. Finally, my husband walked over to our waiter (who had his face in the computer) and asked how long it takes for a bowl of spaghetti! The waiter seemed surprised that we were missing a dinner. He went into the kitchen and then came over to tell us that it would be out soon. He apologized as he should have but 3 separate times blamed the kitchen/cook. He kept saying it was on the ticket so it wasn't his fault! Guessing he was trying to protect his tip. It doesn't matter who was to blame. We were the customers and the restaurant staff is a team so the waiter needs to accept responsibility on behalf of the restaurant. He even went so far as to say, \"Even though it wasn't my fault, I will be happy to buy you another glass of wine or dessert.\" Seriously? Nobody wanted another glass of wine or dessert but my problem is with his continuing to say it wasn't his fault. That is not how to do service recovery. He should have told the manager who should have come over personally to apologize. When the food was delivered, the \"helper\" should have immediately told the waiter we were missing a dinner. The waiter should have checked to see if our meals looked okay. There were so many errors along the way and had any of them not occurred, the restaurant would have recognized their error right away and could have rectified it immediately. What's more is that after the waiter kept blaming the kitchen, the missing meal came right out. It was obviously ready and just sitting somewhere in the kitchen. Too bad this place has decent food, decent ambiance and a decent view. They seem to be stuck not knowing if they want to be a finer dining restaurant, a sports bar or a lower-end chain restaurant. They definitely need customer service and service recovery training.",

I recently had a meal at Ventana, the meal arrived 50 minutes after I ordered, it came prepared different than I ordered. I had to send it back 3 times to get it right. The bill came and I gave my credit card and when it came back to sign, it was not my card. I asked the server to get my card and he said the people just left. I asked him to follow them out and get my card back, he didn't. He then told me he would discount the bill by half, I asked how since my card was gone. He said he had the number, I asked for it and he said he didn't have it. I asked for the Manager who refused to come to my table and the server said he would comp the meal for loss of my card. When I got home I called the credit card company which showed the whole amount was billed.",

    "text": "This restaurant came highly recommended, so I came with an appetite and high expectations. The parking lot was full and the walk to the front door was all the way around on the opposite side of the parking.  An oddity, to set the evening off.   I entered and was met with a friendly greeting from the hostess.  She's seasoned and knows how to handle two guests with different needs at once.  I came alone and she invited the other party to wait for their entire party so she could seat me. I was shown a table with a \"view.\"  Across the restaurant and out the windows, yes, one can see The Strip.  My view was of other customers who were attended to while I waited. And waited. And waited...   Yes, bread and water came relatively quickly. My order was taken after a while. After a longer while my salad came. A long time after I had finished my salad, it was removed.  And then I waited further until my overdone and very bland chicken parmesan and side of pasta arrived.  I guess what I wanted was Italian food and what I got was a step sideways from Olive Garden.    I was ignored though out the entirety of my meal except for the question of whether everything was alright as I had taken my first bite.  Once I was done, I waited, and waited, and waited.    When the waiter came by with smiles to run his script about coffee or dessert, I pointed out that a side dish was missing and that he'd have to adjust the bill.  \"OK, thank you\" was his reply with a big smile on his face.  I wasn't doing him a favor to tell him to correct the bill.  I was telling him he missed bringing me a portion of the meal, but no one bothered to check on me.  I corrected him, \"You mean, OK, sorry,\" which he then echoed.    Where I was seated was at a main pass, against a serving station with a computer.  When they entered orders, I got pushed on.  When they rounded the corner, they'd slap the edge of my booth.  When they argued about who is bringing extra plates to the table with the birthday, they did so over me.  So - it's an annoying lay out with mediocre food and horrible service. I'm doing them a favor tonight by giving them two stars.  They get that because the food was hot when it came to the table.  There was no management visible and the friendly hostess didn't ask how everything was or I might have told her.  When I'm back in town, this place is off of my list.",

    "text": "Beautiful restaurant with a decent wine list. But only $$? I think more like $$$. $20 and up on entrees and pastas start at $19. Still well worth a great meal, but you have to deliver a great meal, and they do NOT! So it's $$ if you're splitting entres or ordering the cheapest items with no wine and up to $$$$ if you're eating an app, entree & dessert per person with one bottle of wine. The service is lacking. I hate walking into a place and getting stared at like I don't belong. As if 2 people walked into a restaurant at 6:30pm and had no idea what they were doing there. Then act like you're doing me a favor letting me eat there. Also, with the decor and prices, I do not expect the Chef/Owner to be prancing around in a filthy T-shirt that has to be years old. It's great that you want to be you, but I certainly don't want some desgraziato approaching my dinner table. Get a Chef's Coat or wear a button up with an apron over it for heaven's sake. Have some respect for people eating even if you have none for yourself. A great place is great because they make every guest feel like it's \"theirs\", like they're welcomed. Well here at Ventano's, you feel very much like you are in someone else's space and you are there by their grace. Cold, uninviting and borderline inhospitable.  Bruschetta, I wouldn't even call it that. It seemed more like something that would have been complimentary with a Pre Fixe. Simple diced tomato with olive oil, basil and toast points. Nothing was seasoned and the tomatos were cold and flavorless.  Baked Clams, Chunks of raw garlic in the sauce and underseasoned, but they were tender and they were littlenecks. The breadcrumbs were flavorless and it was the first time I ever sprinkled salt on clams. And this was the best dish of the meal. Thanks more to Long Island than the chef.  Fettuccine Alfredo, Bland, lumpy and seperating before our eyes. And I love when I see some noodles stuck together at one end. Nothing says the guy cooking your food cares quite like that. How hard is it to make sure noodles aren't stuck together?   Eggplant Parm,. Topped with Fresh mozz and a nice portion, but with just eggplant stacked up on top eggplant it was dry and also very Bland. For over $20, I expect some more mozz or even ricotta in the layers, but I would have been content with just sauce so it wasn't so dry.  Their Bread Service? The worst I have ever seen, inedible.",

    "text": "I am still on a quest to find a really great Italian restaurant in Las Vegas since I moved here 2 years ago. Sorry to say, but Ventano's isn't it! First of all, the main dining room has the ambiance of a mass eatery, noisy, and bare wooden tables. So if you'd like to have a dinner with at least some ambiance, make sure you get a table on the patio, which has a great view of the city. Staff was friendly and attentive. Now to the food: I want to start with the bread and olive oil and balsamic vinegar they bring you. The oil has absolutely no flavor and the Balsamic tasted like a red wine vinegar reduction. Basically the cheapest stuff money can buy. We started with the beef carpaccio which was actually ok. I then had the cioppino. Portion was huge, and the broth tasted ok. Good variety of sea food, calamari, clams, mussels, scallops, - but Popcorn Shrimp????? I don't mind paying $28 for a plate if the ingredients match, but I have the feeling that whoever is purchasing / cooking there has the attitude of \"Nothing is too cheap for our customers\"!  My wife had the veal parmigiana. Again, big portion but the veal was dry. Pasta was cooked al dente, but drenched with a bland tomato sauce that tasted like it came straight out of a can.  All in all, in my opinion, the place is just a bit above Olive Garden with twice the price. Not worth the trip.",

    "text": "This place is kind of eclectic IMO. I first went here for a rehearsal dinner in their private room 2 years ago, and have been back everytime I am in Vegas. I say it's eclectic because you will see people dressed to the nines (wedding/rehearsal private parties), others dressed nice but casual (khakis and button downs), and then people - usually families with kids- dressed like they just came from off roading (shorts and t-shirts). I find this odd but in a good way because it makes you feel welcomed and relaxed no matter how you look.   The star here are the pastas. I had the Ventano oven baked dish with cheese tortellini, grilled chicken, and pink sauce and it was out of this world good. The pasta was firm yet melted in your mouth. Oh, and the salads are great too.  Service and price are a-ok and so is the parking. The scenery is pretty too.  Great place to go when you want to leave the strip!",

I didn't read previous reviews but saw that it had a good rating. It was after 2 when we arrived and there were only a few other tables occupied. There was only one server and one busser working, since it was not a busy time of the day. They were both wonderful and helpful. We ordered a bottle of wine from their very extensive wine list. I ordered a white pizza with mushrooms and artichokes and my husband ordered his favorite, lasagna. They offered us bread while we waited. The atmosphere was lovely and there is a wonderful view of the strip that we look forward to enjoying when we come back at night. Our food was amazing! We thoroughly enjoyed our first time here and look forward to coming back again. The only thing I would change is to bring the bread out in something nicer than a brown paper bag.",

The chicken was tough, like it had been boiled or maybe 3 days old, it was stark white with no grill marks and tasted old.  The sauce was not creamy tasting or fresh either..  The noodles were very thick.  My husband had lasagna and it wasn't too bad.  Over priced in my opinion.  This is our 3rd time to go and I've never really enjoyed it, why do they put breadsticks in a paper bag, its a beautiful restaurant, seems like they'd wrap them in a napkin and put in a basket..

Ventano's is located in the heart of Henderson and overlooks beautiful Las Vegas. One of the prettiest views in the city. Great place for a romantic dinner for too or to enjoy the company of good friends.   Pros: The atmosphere is very relaxing with a beautiful Italian / Tuscan feel with amazing views of the strip.   The service is always great and everyone is extremely friendly.  The food is always good and they serve good size portions so you should not ever leave hungry.  Cons: They bring a credit card machine to your table after your meal and do the transaction right there. I HATE this! You feel pressure to tip in front of your server. I just think it makes for an uncomforatble feel and they should consider just taking your check, running your card and letting you fill it out like most places. In fact, we have not gone here because we do not like to end the meal with this weird machine and our server staring us down. Not that our service has not ever been less than great, it is just a weird feeling.  All in all though, its a nice place. If you want to avoid the awkward pay at the  end... just bring cash :)",

The hosts were okay but the gentleman working the night we went seemed aggressive which can come off as rude if he isn't careful with how he says things. When my family and I sat down the server was very friendly and immediately asked for our drink orders. We soon received our drinks and breadsticks. The breadsticks are delicious!! Or we were just hungry, either way we wanted more and it took 3 different servers to say \"okay I'll bring that right over\".. They were busy so maybe thats why it took so long which we can understand.   A server brought over my son's food and dropped a chicken finger thinking we didn't notice. Because it was my birthday I didn't want to worry to much about that and just let it slide. I don't know if he even picked it up or not.  I ordered the Manicotti which was as expected, a delicious cheesy mess that I haven't had in years with a side of steamed veggies. The steamed veggies tasted like they were boiled in seafood water and I couldn't finish them because the taste it left in my mouth was gross.   My boyfriend ordered the Linguini with Clams which he had to dig out the clams from the shells which sucked for him as it took him forever and I understand where they are going with that dish because it looked fancy. My daughter ordered a mac n cheese which was tiny and her being a kid assumed it would be large. If you have children over 9 years old the mac and cheese is not large enough for them. I shared my Manicotti with her.   Upon us waiting for the check it took forever so we just walked to the front where the hosts were and then our server noticed our table was empty and caught up to us. There was no have a goodnight or farwell so to us that was a common thing that sucks in restaurants today. Sadly we won't be returning, we'll stick to Brio at Town Square because it's very good and the customer service is on point.",

Apparently, the wait staff was more interested in setting up for a large party than waiting on us.  After 15 minutes waiting for any type of acknowledgement, we left.  Probably won't be back for a while.  Not a good way to treat customers, especially regulars who have been there at least 15 times this year.",

Rest of the meal he never stopped back to check on things, worry about refills or anything else. He never even stopped back for the bill had to track down some one else for that. If not for the food being exceptional I would not go back.",

I see how crowded this spot gets on Friday and Saturday nights and assumed it was worth visiting.  My husband and I ate here for lunch on a Saturday. The oil and vinegar for dipping bread was the first thing I didn't enjoy. In full disclosure I am an olive oil and balsamic vinegar snob. They are foods that I can't enjoy if it's low quality or obviously cheap. The vinegar was also not a high quality balsamic. You can tell if it has that overly vinegary smell and odd after taste.  My husband had pizza and I had pasta. There was nothing noteworthy or tasty about either dish. We each had about two bites of our lunch before we commented to each other that this spot wouldn't be worth visiting again. Maybe we caught them on an off afternoon, but our experience didn't help us understand why anyone eats here.",

We are original NY'ers and have lived in Henderson for 12 yrs now, and have been fallen in love with Ventano's before we had even moved here thanks to our realtor. Their food, hospitality, ambiance, loyal staff members, are a staple in our lives.  Arnauld , the owner, his family and amazing staff, have all made every occasion and every out of the blue dinner, a special occasion for all of us. The food is exactly what we had left behind in NY, and when \"experimenting\", usually due to hunger pains and impatience, we've \"joyfully\" been disappointed, and make a plan for Ventano's the following night for redemption.  Their family has become apart of our family, and we're blessed to have their paths connected to ours",

Pretty sure they know my order by heart. Shrimp on a stone blackened, risotto, or fish as an entree, and a glass of Chianti, or a bottle of Riesling. Depends on the mood, but I usually stick to those items. All of the risottos are great so don't bother asking me my favorite. The shrimp on a stone, gets the table next to us asking their server, \"what is that?!\" EVERY SINGLE TIME! You can hear it sizzling before it gets to your table, and there is quite the lingering aroma once its in your presence.  I have always have pretty good service. A longer wait one time when I went with a group, but the food was worth it.  A perfect date night, as it has an amazing city view. Also good for large groups, or beautiful outdoor dining.  They are family oriented so just because its perfect for date night, does not mean you cant bring the kiddos.",

    "text": "We came here on a Saturday night with 8 PM reservations and requested a table on the patio with the restaurant almost at full capacity. They did have a table available and we enjoyed a nice dinner with the well documented view of the Valley.  I was pleased that they carried Left Hand Brewing's Wake Up Dead Imperial Stout which was a great paring with the dozen oysters ($23) we had for appetizer. It's frustrating when other restaurants that serve oysters don't offer any kind of stout. It's a classic and obvious pairing to me.  For entrees, I had the pan seared mahi mahi ($38) special being offered that night which was accompanied with a vegetable risotto, seared scallops, and a crab cake. The Mahi Mahi was cooked slightly over, otherwise it was a flavorful seafood combination. My wife enjoyed her chicken saltimbocca ($28) with sauteed spinach and roasted potatoes. For dessert, we had the recommended caramel pecan ice cream cake bananas foster ($7) by our server Carlos. This was a nice, sweet finale contrasting our savory entrees. An absence of photos was due to the patio being lit dimly with a relaxed ambiance. I didn't want to be \"that guy\" disturbing everyone with a flash firing through the dining area.  Service was more than adequate with an extended delay waiting for entrees being the only snag. Although I did provide Carlos some income for the evening with our tip, I am certainly not his \"boss.\" In the setting we were in, for him to repeatedly refer to me using that term, didn't really rub me the right way. Overall though, a great meal and there is no reason why we won't be back.",

    "text": "If looking for a great italian restaurant outside the las vegas strip and hotels? Ventano Italian Grill & Seafood is one of the best options in Vegas. You will be surprise but at night the view of the Valley is pretty cool from anywhere in the dining room. If you really want make it romantic and embrace the view they have patio area outside that you can dine. I have been here few times for dinner and other times just hanging out at the bar drinking talking stories with my roommate. Another five star point I really like fact the restaurant has been there for years and has lot of old school Vegas nostalgia. Rat Pack. Italian mobsters/Italian restaurants. Lol! The dining room is in no way run down it very modern and even the bar area. The bar area with all the booths, the bar counter, and feels old school to me. The bartenders are awesome. Richard is one of the best bartenders in Vegas. Friendly and if your endurance junky the guy can talk stories with you all night. Also learn few training tips along the way. Just like the servers everyone is very attentive too your needs, never empty glass, and makes ones dining experience great one.   My last visit had the spaghetti bolognese. Awesome. It was nice hearty. The tomato sauce was delicious.What I like the most was the balance between both!!! Nothing worst then have overload of meat or sauce. It was tasty till the last noodle. I have tried the grilled shrimp and scallop on the hot plate. I love the presentation on both. Different. Thinking just shrimp or scallop on hot plate. Both well seasoned and once add fresh lemon juice very much refreshing light dish.   I feel most of the menu is reasonable price. Not doubt cheaper then going to Italian restaurant on the stip. Just wish not on the opposite side of town so could stop by more often. If am on that side of town. Ventano spot would hit up in heartbeat get my italian food on!",

I ordered linguine with clams in a clear broth. Very tasty.  My hubby ordered Veal Parmesan. He did not like it because it lacked flavor. We also shared a Caesar Salad. Mediocre, dressing was sour. I wonder why restaurants are ok serving average food. Where is the pride and passion?  Too bad. We won't be going back",

By far the best experience I've had at a restaurant.  100% recommend eating at this Italian restaurant.",

We then split the Gnocchi Con Pesto and the chicken vesuvio. So good. Ventanos is always good time. Fantastic view of the strip and a spacious dining room. See you sion  6/22/19  We are back. Early dinner. We had the entire dinning room to ourselves. Don't get me wrong. This place is usually paced but we came in after lunch and before dinner.   Sergio set us up with water, bread and the lovely oil and balsamic (which is really hard not to fill up on).   Adam told us that our favorite wine wasn't available and suggested a less expensive bottle. Looks like we have a new fav. So yummy. As always, we ordered too much but that means LEFTOVERS.  The chicken parm is my fav and never disappoints. Debbie had the special, haddock, crab, and scallops. Soooooo good.   We do come here a lot. Never had a bad experience. Thank you Adam and Sergio for making an ordinary Saturday feel special.",

    "text": "3.5 rounded up  Fine dining atmosphere at an affordable price is hard to come by in Vegas, but we found just that at Ventano's in Henderson. The panoramic view of Vegas at night was just beautiful!   We felt a bit out of place upon walking in at first because it looked so fancy and their servers were all in tuxes (this Hawaii girl was wearing slippahs, oh heyyyy!), but we immediately felt at ease when our friendly server Austin greeted us with a sweet smile and whisked us away to our table. After looking around, we noticed everyone is is dressed casually as well, phew!   Everyone was as professional and attentive as can be, but still very approachable and friendly.   CALAMARI FRITTI ($12.50): <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2yX57JE&s=65621ea008553873a0b09c1324bba13f4d3a5bb74635ddfe799fddba8b7cd956\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/2yX57JE</a> You know you got it made when your plate of calamari comes with more tentacles than rings.  - Tender squid fried in a thin crispy batter. However, it was unseasoned, salting it immediately out of the fryer would've helped immensely.  - The homemade spicy marinara wasn't spicy and could've used some salt as well.   SIDE OF MEATBALLS (3pc for $6):  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2qBYW9q&s=14e3abcf0920dd3d61c8a6ed8bc7d35db5047695a0a120dc2dc24587693eb92c\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/2qBYW9q</a> - Juicy tender meatballs the size of my fist, they sure don't skimp on portion sizes here. Very meaty and not a lot of fillers, I likey.  - The meat sauce was like crack. Delicious. We were using that flavorful meat sauce as our dipping sauce for the calamari.  VEAL PROSCIUTTO with linguini ($27): <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2SWy3JZ&s=eaccb8051e8c9d4aed6a4c368c20f54b8dba035dcf832847ec069d1f0ed8bb05\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/2SWy3JZ</a> - The veal was perfectly cooked and the pasta was al dente.  - There was just a single slice of prosciutto thrown on top of my veal. I'm used to seeing the prosciutto either wrapped or pressed onto the veal, but no biggie. - The vodka sauce consisting of roasted red peppers and black olives was really salty. I like olives, I eat them like candy but the olives here were unusually salty to me.  CHICKEN FRANCESE with linguini ($24): - Chicken breast coated in parmesan and egg and lightly pan-fried.  - The lemon butter sauce was intense. It was mouthpuckering, slap-your-face lemony. Tastes like chicken piccata without the capers and a ton of lemon juice. My friend really enjoyed it though.  I'd come back for the jumbo meatballs with crack sauce.  Hours:  Lunch 11 AM to 3 PM Daily Dinner 3 PM to 10 PM on Sun - Thurs, 3PM-11 PM Fri & Sat Lounge & Gaming Room: 24 Hours a daily  Parking: Lots of stalls in their private lot",

I tried the Grilled Lamb Chops on Stone which was very tender, the Calamari Fritti which was very well seasoned, the Scallops and Shrimp which came with large shrimp and scallops and the Prosciutto.  I think the only item which was delicious, but a bit on the small portion side was the Cheese Ravioli.  Love that they serve hot bread in brown paper bags with olive oil, balsamic and butter.  Wish they had a garlic butter option too but it's plenty good even without.  Definitely a solid place to go if you're craving Italian food.",

We ordered the shrimp on a hot stone for appetizer, very good and enough to share. Our party had the angel hair with pomodoro sauce,  the special which was haddock with crab meat and scallops with a lemon sauce. It was excellent and came with asparagus. The house salad and Caesar were also very good.  No room for dessert for us. Our waiter was excellent too.",

My friends are regulars here and so they asked if we could sit outside.  The hostess was able to seat us immediately.  It should have been a red flag that there were only 2 other tables taken outside...  The good: - The view.  Wow!  Took a few pictures of the sunset.  Gorgeous. - The menu.  Easy to navigate even though there are a lot of items on there. - The shrimp on stone.  Get this.  It's very good.  Doesn't even need the sauce (although the wasabi one is dynamite).  Sure the shrimp are the smaller kind but the ones I had were flavorful and very tender.  The bad: - The service time.  It took so long in between getting seated and having our order taken.  We weren't checked on that often and items we requested were not brought to us.  Then the check situation was a bit of a nightmare.  But maybe that was our fault for needing 3 separate checks.  - The classic salad was drenched in dressing.  Ask for it on the side.   Overall, a nice place in the neighborhood to get a good meal.  Just don't sit outside.",

I had been there previously, and never been disappointed. Upon entering, you'll see a nice looking open space, with a raised bar area that is partially separated by half walls. Clay colored walls and exposed beams and woodwork give it an upscale casual feel.  Most importantly, the food is good. This time we came for lunch. We started with an order of shrimp on a stone, which is served sizzling in garlic butter glory. A few orders of this would have been fine for me, but I ordered the veal picatta ((capers and white wine) which was very tender and good. It was served with penne and a red sauce, but the veal portion was a little small, even for lunch.  Service was spot on - not hanging over us, but never too far away to ask if everything was okay.  Pricing is reasonable. Lunch for three (1 appetizer, 3 entrees and non-alcoholic drinks) came to $75 including tip.  Recommended.",

They were all super friendly and kept my water glass full (my favorite) and made sure everything was up to par. As for the food, I felt it was mediocre. The bread served before the meal was not as I expected. They seemed like pre-made (wannabe) fresh bread sticks, but they give you oil and balsamic vinegar for dipping, I'm not sure if I should be feeling this confusion with bread and dipping... but I associate oil and vinegar with fresh bread.   For an entree I got a pesto dish, which.. Yes, was good.. but I still feel it was average. My friend got another pasta dish with spicy marinara which he enjoyed. We also indulged in dessert.. tiramisu. Enjoyed this as well.   Ventano's is good. Nothing more, nothing less. I enjoyed my experience here, and food was definitely a step above an Olive Garden. I will be back on the occasion.",

    "text": "All in all a very disappointing dinner with my mother visiting from San Francisco. We were never presented with the specials and assumed it was all on the menu. The waiter (manager?) took our drink order and upon returning to take our order, again never recited the specials. We started with fried calamari and ordered two entrees: Pasta Putanesca and the Pasta with Shrimp and Porcini Mushrooms.  And, so it started downhill from there. The calamari was tough and chewy and we sent it back.  They fried it some more and brought it back still chewy, just hotter and oilier.  Their suggestion was to order stuffed mushrooms, which were floating in a greasy liquid but edible.  On to the entrees. The Pasta Putanesca was so salty from the unsliced kalamata olives, capers and anchovies, that I couldn't eat it on the overcooked spaghetti.  In the meanwhile, the same waiter was listing the specials to the table behind us.  I sent the pasta back and he recommended the Dover Sole which was tasty but oily and covered with a Thanksgiving-type stuffing with bits of crab and a dry butternut squash risotto.  My mother was able to eat a bit of her pasta but was pretty sure that the porcini mushrooms were really button mushrooms and was challenged by the chewy shrimp.  The pink sauce was bland but edible.  I also was surprised that nobody checked on my cup of decaf coffee which remained empty or whether we might want to order more wine for my Mother.  To add insult to injury, the waiter was defensive about the specials and glossed over his error, implying that we ordered too fast. He comped us the mushrooms (he was sure that this would make us happy). However, when i saw that the sole was $27 ($12 more than the pasta), I felt that since I was no longer hungry after attempting the calamari, mushrooms and bread and ate only a few bites of the sole that this was steep.  He begrudgingly took off $5.  The place was empty save for 5 or 6 tables and I often gauge service by their attentiveness to my coffee cup. I felt that even with our complaints, or even as a result of them, that we would have been watched over carefully.  It was a first try for newcomers to the area. I guess I will keep on looking.",

This year made the same reservation. We got there and the restaurant was not full. We were seated in the banquet room on a small dance floor. I asked if we could move to the restaurant and was told no. Those tables were reserved. Yes, I had a reservation too. The floor was very slick and the table was very unsteady- as it was a folding table. The food was okay. The servers were very accommodating. There are so many choices for restaurants.

    "text": "Excellent food, service and view of the Las Vegas skyline at night!  The Grilled Shrimp on the Stone was a huge mound of little shrimps with a slightly spicy kick. It came with a creamy horseradishy dip that I wasn't too excited about partly because I'm not into horseradish but also because the shrimps were already a little spicy and perfectly marinated. I did however wish the shrimp were a little bigger; I wouldn't have minded getting fewer of them.   The Arancine consisted of three large fried balls with a gooey filling of risotto, mozarella cheese, ground beef and peas with a marinara dip. They were good but it was also very filling and a little too heavy to be a thoroughly enjoyable appetizer.  The highlight of the night was definitely the home made linguine with scallops and shrimp in your choice of sauce, which for us was an absolutely delish garlic cream sauce that our server recommended. The linguine had a great bouncy texture and was cooked just right with sweet fresh scallops and large shrimp. This was one of the specials for that night but we were told that they often vary this dish so you could try something a little different each time. This is sooo good but I love scallops so I might be a little biased here.  I thought it was a tad warm out on the patio that night and it would have been nice to have ceiling fans or some kind of misting to make it a little more comfortable. Although we were seated outside, the staff were attentive and kept our glasses filled and checked on us often.  UPDATED on 8/19/2010: I signed up on Ventano's website about 3 or 4 weeks ago and only just received a one-time-use coupon from them for $25 off $50 purchase that expires September 1, 2010. I don't live near Henderson so if you can use this, please send me a message and I'll email it to you.",

It was a great time but we ended up frequenting La Collina/Carmine's on the Hill when we wanted a nice Italian meal and a great view. Since La Collina/Carmine's on the Hill is now a Mexican restaurant, my husband and I decided to give Ventano's another shot.   First off, the view. It's fabulous. When the weather is nice they have a lovely patio where you can sit and eat as you look at the lights of the Strip. It's still summer, and a hot one as usual, so we decided to sit indoors near the windows. When the sun was setting, staff went outside and dropped the shades so myself and others would not be blinded. As soon as the sun fell below the horizon, they put it back up.   We decided on some wine, and some complimentary bread was brought out in a brown paper bag. I try not to fill up on bread when I am having Italian food but this bread was really yummy. We also decided to get the shrimp on a stone appetizer, having remembered how good it was when our friends ordered it on our first visit. My husband is not a fan of any form of sea/lake dwelling creature, but he enjoyed some of these.    For our entrees my husband had the manicotti, I had risotto with prosciutto and peas, I didn't try the manicotti, because my risotto was delicious. And the serving was huge. When I was done it looked like I had just gotten started. But I was too stuffed to get dessert.   Service was very much on point for the majority of the evening. Never had to ask for a refill and our waiter checked in on how we were doing on occasion without being overbearing. When it was time for the leftovers to be packaged up and the check to be brought over the restaurant was a little fuller so we had a itty bit wait but it was really nothing that would prevent me from returning.",

    "text": "Caprese is a quintessential Italian salad consisting simply of sliced fresh mozzarella (preferably buffalo) and tomato dressed with olive oil, garnished with fresh basil and finished with salt.  I ordered Ventano's Caprese which adds a balsamic reduction to the classic recipe. Unfortunately, the tomato was inedible - anemic pink with the consistency of Styrofoam and not a scintilla of flavor.  The mozzarella lacked the creamy texture and delicate flavor of fresh mozzarella.  The fresh basil and the balsamic reduction did not succeed in rescuing the inferior tomato and the dry mozzarella from embarrassment.  The service also was sub par.  A youngish server failed as a sommelier - did not allow tasting before pouring and having poured the initial portions, did not return to offer additional pours.  An attentive server would have noticed that I had barely touched the tomato and inquired whether the dish was acceptable - he did not.  Our party was seated in a booth with a view of the city lights and the young lady who managed the bread supply did her job.  Although my companions said their veal saltimbocca was \"good,\" the presentation lacked any artistry whatsoever.  Granted, I am a Caprese snob but, at a minimum, if the chef cannot serve a delicious tomato and creamy mozzarella, don't serve the dish.",

Ok, here is why I didn't give it 5 stars--We are an Italian family from Lake Como and I reserve 5 stars for Italian restaurants that serve food precisely the way Italians in Italy serve food.  This is more an American version but an extremely good American version.  Let's start from the beginning.  Freshly made breadsticks arrived which were phenomenal.  The olive oil and balsamic vinegar were of the highest quality.  I had the caprese which was delicious and tasty with firm tomatoes and good, but not the best, mozzarella.  Then we all ordered pasta and their pomodoro sauce was exquisite as was their puttanesca with high quality olives.  We finished it all off with a dark chocolate cake which was sinful and yummy.   A delectable limoncello after all the food was devoured and we were on the road full and happy.   What made this meal so special is that the night before we had the worst experience at the snooty and overpriced Las Vegas restaurant, Il Mulino.  It was no fun and spending $330 for 2 adults and 2 kids trying to be careful about what we selected because of the expense was not a pleasure.  Adam, our waiter, made this meal so much fun.  He was flexible, always attentive to our requests without hovering too much and extremely proud of the restaurant which makes for a fun time.  If I lived in the area, I would be a regular here.",

    "text": "I moved near this restaurant a few months ago and since then I have been in 4 times - 3 times for dinner and once in the bar area after the main dining room was closed.  Every time we have been in this place has exceeded my expectations. Service is prompt and formal which I appreciate being in the industry myself. The decor of the restaurant and demeanor of the employees gives off the feeling of gourmet dining but casual at the same time. Perfect for my husband and I.   Each of the 3 times I have had dinner I ordered one of the daily specials. The portions are generous, my beef has always been cooked to the perfect temperature ordered and specials are always unique and delicious. The wine list is extensive and fairly priced. The bread is served inside of a brown paper bag - I can appreciate the whimsical touch.    If you go in you must try the beef carpaccio - a classic dish which I have enjoyed at many different restaurants but there is something about this dish at Ventano's that keeps me craving more! I have literally begged my husband to go in  just to eat this appetizer!!  Another cool thing is they offer events regularly like wine or beer maker dinners. Not to mention they have the best view of the strip!! Definitely check this place out and you will not be disappointed!",

Service staff is incredibly attentive. They are very accommodating if you want to make substitutions. They have Linguine con Scampi Fra Diavolo, but I prefer it with Calamari instead of shrimp, which they are more than happy to do. This dish is to die for. Prices for dinner are on the expensive side, but lunch is reasonable. If you have an Entertainment card, it makes dinner a great value. The food and service is always incredible and worth it. Highly recommended for special occasions and romantic dinners.",

Instead of the traditional receipt where you fill it all out, they have this device that calculates either an 18% or 20% tip to your meal. That's all good and well, but it's like \"What if I feel the waiter/staff didn't deserve it?\"   Anyway, all in all, we love this place and keep coming back.

    "text": "My husband and I went to this restaurant on 6/8/13 for the first time. Saw some pretty good reviews and thought it was worth a try. We will not go back again.   Here are the reasons why  Service:  1) It was a nightmare. The water had a funny taste to it. We ordered unsweetened ice tea. The waitress never came back to refill our glasses. Finally refilled our glass when someone next to us asked her and then she filled our glass that was like 15 minutes my glass was empty.   2) The waitress was either forgetful or too lazy to get us the correct drink. We ordered \"Unsweetened\" ice tea, not sweeten ice tea. She gave us sweeten ice tea 2x when she refill our glass. We didn't bother to tell her that it was wrong and see how long it would take for her to realize it was the wrong tea. She refilled us when she was refilling another couple with the same ice tea. She didn't notice and didn't apologize for the wrong drink. It was terrible. I wanted unsweetened ice tea b/c sweetened ice tea gave me heartburns.   3) The tip options were set for you. You basically have no other choice except to give 18% tip for bad service or 20% tip for regular service. It was set on a handheld machine.  Overall service, it was terrible. The waitress came to check on us once during the entire meal. Keep giving us the wrong ice tea.   Food: 1) It is way over priced with the quality of the food they serve. We ordered an appetizer and 2 basic main course, Arancine $10, Chicken Piccata $20 and Chicken Scallopini $20.    2) Both main course dishes were cover with tones of sauce like swimming in a oval platter tub. The chicken piccata sauce was terrible, lemon juice and cream, way too much lemon juice gave my husband heartburn immediately.   3) Chicken Piccata only had the lemon cream sauce and a few capers with a couple of small chicken breast and an abundance of pasta on the side. The pasta had no taste to it, just basic crushed tomato sauce on top, no seasoning what so ever. My husband is Italian and grew up in a big Italian family. He hated the food.   4) Chicken Scallopini was also swimming in a oval tub platter with pasta on the side as well. A chicken breast was pounded to death. The other chicken breast thickness was uneven. Another small piece of chicken breast somehow crawled into my plate look like some leftover.   5) Arancine, rice ball with mozzarella and peas. It was not worth $10 for 3 rice ball. It was not good at all. I guess that was the reason why they gave us a big bowl of red tomato chili sauce on the side. One bite, I was done with the dish.   Overall food, it was terrible. Not worth coming back., not worth the price. The food on the menu is simple, and you will probably think it shouldn't be too bad. Well for some who likes tones of sauce on their food and throws anything in their mouth and think is good, yes, this place isn't bad at all then.   Total bill for 1 appetizer 2 main course plus 2 ice tea & 18 % tip is $70+  You could definitely spend the same amount of money elsewhere for better service and food.",

    "text": "We wanted to like this place considering a lot of positive reviews about the food and the view. We went on a Wednesday evening around 7pm and the place was about two thirds full. The decor was Tuscany ish but the restaurant is basically one big room, so the acoustics leave a lot to be desired. The tables all look like they are 40\" square tops so intimacy is not a strong suit here. This is not a romantic restaurant. The kitchen is situated behind glazed glass and the loud clanking of dishes just seems to carry throughout the room. I think there was some sort of music playing but it was all garbled with the rest of the noise. The \"view\" is nice but looking out the windows wasn't all it was cracked up to be because of the reflections of the lights, tv's , and exit signs. I guess if you eat outside you can appreciate the view better. We were a little taken aback by the high end prices. A drink I ordered was good but small, and for $8 you would think you'd get a decent size glass. Warm breadsticks in a bag reminded me of Olive Garden and weren't good. The complimentary oil and vinegar really was third rate.  Can butter be that more expensive? We split a Caesar salad $8.50 which I have to say was very good. Freshly made, cold, and just the right mix of dressing. We then ordered Veal Parm with Spaghetti $26 and Lobster Ravioli with Blackened Shrimp $28. Any Italian restaurant worth it's salt is known by their Veal Parm and their sauce. The veal was tender and plentiful and nicely plated but the sauce was really a 5 out of 10. Being an Italian from the east coast makes me a snob I guess but the sauce wasn't that good at all. How can you charge $19 for Spaghetti Bolognese and then if you want two meatballs add another $4? Manicotti $22? So I can get Veal Parm for the same amount as Spaghetti & Meatballs. Doesn't make sense. The Lobster Ravioli was very good but consisted of only four medium sized ravioli and four medium sized shrimp topped with two pieces of asparagus. We didn't stick around for dessert but we bagged the left overs. Two people with the above and tax was $75. I'm not sure what the owner thinks justifies the high entree prices. Yelp needs to add another $ sign to their price category for this place. As I write this their sauce is repeating on me. Time to find another place.",

    "text": "This is an expensive place and you should expect the best.  We had a caesar salad and the lettuce was perfect, it was well tossed, the garlic and anchovy were well balanced, the croutons were crisp and tasty.  I've only had better caesar salads when it was table prep in very high end restaurants.  The lobster ravioli was extremely good.  The pasta is homemade and near perfect, the lobster flavor was strong, the sauce was well balanced, and the shrimp (unusual in lobster ravioli) was very slightly overcooked.  We will definitely get that again.  However, I cannot recommend the veal saltimbocca.  The veal was a little tough, but acceptable.  The prosciutto tasted a bit tough and had too much basil flavor.  The creamed spinach could have used a bit more creaminess.  The roasted potatoes were fine, but nothing to write home about.  But the killer was the whole leaves of basic on the veal and slightly mixed into the spinach.  Have you ever tasted a whole basil leaf in your mouth?  It ruined the dish.  We will be back to this place to try other dishes, and especially more pastas, but no more saltimbocca....  If we had just had the lobster ravioli, it would have received 4 stars.  That said, when we passed the bar, the smoke was a bit much, but you couldn't smell it where we ate.  Parking is off to the side, but acceptable.  The wait staff had good personalities, but service was lacking when the restaurant was full.  We waited a good 15 minutes just for the bill.",

    "text": "After lots of great reviews we were looking forward as part of our \"new restaurant Tuesday\" adventures where we try a new place usually always based on Yelp. Nothing bad or glaring, but I feel this place has seen better days. The ambience is not as old school Italian romantic as more a little dated. The faux murals on the wall and a little tired interior could use an update. The waiter was very good, attentive and helped steer us toward a couple of favorites. The food here is solid. We enjoyed both our appetizer (calamari) and our entrees. I had the Tortellini house specialty and it was very good. Wife had the penne which was OK. No room for desert and we took about half of our portions home for leftovers due to size. The location is good near the highway and the view is interesting. Nothing glaringly bad but nothing that knocked our socks off. This is a solid neighborhood Italian place where you won't be disappointed but not be overwhelmed either.",

If you have not tried Ventanos I can not recommend it enough!!!!  I moved away from Vegas 6 years ago and it has been a while since I have been back but whenever I come to visit I always make sure I get to Ventanos.  The food is absolutely mouth watering.  Unfortunately when we visited Chef Arnauld was off the night I came in and I was so disappointed to miss him.  He has special dishes he makes for his customers once he finds out what you like.  But even though he wasn't there the dinner was still incredible.  There is not a dish on his menu that you won't love.  We had Shrimp Arnauld and the Rack of Lamb.  Each dish was cooked to perfection and my mouth is watering just remembering the experience.  If I could I would give Ventanos 10 stars, it truly is that good.  I will be back around Thanksgiving and I will see you then Chef.  I don't know if you remember me from my picture  but I am looking forward to finally having my favorite dish, Your Shrimp Roast.  I am already counting the days.",

It was date night and our FAVORITE Italian place (where they called us by name for the last 14 years) had closed and we were really craving REAL Italian, not Americanized, chain food.  We were not disappointed! We always try the Caesar Salad, love a good one, and will leave a so-so one to wilt.  Theirs was packed with flavor, intense but not over done- we enjoyed every last bite!  The bread sticks were soft, and would accompany a soup well, but not really dip-able for olive oil and balsamic.  We each ordered the Linguine with shrimp, roasted red peppers, and scallops in a cream sauce, something I hate to do because I love trying different flavors, especially from a new place, but it sounded good and was SO OTTIMO (FANTASTIC)!  The shrimp popped, the scallops so tender, but the cream sauce was really the star of the show!  So well developed, rich and smooth!  The portions were huge and even though we kept taking bite after bite, the bowls looked full even at the end.  On top of it all you have this amazing view of the Strip, so unexpected, but along with the soft lighting and the friendly waiters, was just great!  About $80 for the two of us.",

    "text": "Called at 4 pm and reserved the table for 6:45 Christmas night and when we arrived we checked in with the hostess about 45 minutes early just hoping that a table would be available earlier! After checking in with the hostess she told me that we were there too early and our appointment wasn't until 6:45 I told her that I realize we are early just hoping it table would open up sooner. There were four or five tables open for the entire 45 minutes we were waiting and we were never sat until our appointment time and the table we were sat at was open the entire 45 minutes. After we were sat it took 15 or 20 minutes to get a drink or for our waiter to even acknowledge we were there! Then after taking our order it took almost another hour to even get our food. Then after we were finished eating we were sitting there for another 15 or 20 minutes waiting on our check! Although the food was great the service was very crappy! When the manager came over to ask us how our food was it was very quick and uncaring and just seemed that he only asked because he had to not that he actually cared. We have eaten here many times but will not be back! I also asked the second Hostess who sat us why we could not have taken that seat 45 minutes prior and she said because the tables were dirty but that was complete BS and I explained to her that the tables were not dirty and they were ready to be sad and she began to argue with me that they were dirty and not clean. Attached is a photo of all cleaned tables while I was sitting and waiting",

All of the staff was exceedingly friendly and helpful. When asked for a menu recommendation, i went with her recommendation and had the crab-stuffed halibut, which excelled as an Italian and Seafood masterpiece without equal. Then there's the view. Sunset over the city of Las Vegas. Arnauld stopped by ours and many other patron's tables repeatedly to assure satisfaction. And then there was dessert. Great wine selection too. We will be frequent guests from this day forward. Don't miss this experience !",

I did not know this place had a bar with gaming machines that stays open all night.  First of all, the bartender is great. This guy Matt, he can truly make a drink. He spent a lot of time advising some of the regulars about wine, and he made me an original cocktail that was amazing. I ended up staying super late.  Second, they have a late night happy hour that starts at midnight where ALL FOOD IS HALF PRICE!!! So you get food that is very good, for half price in the bar. Love it.",

    "text": "This is by far my favorite Italian restaurant in Las Vegas. I gave a few gift certificates to my brother to use on date nights with his girlfriend and they both loved their experience every time. He told me the food is always phenomenal and the service couldn't be any better than perfect!!! I came here on a random moment and the hostess kindly sat me in a booth that had a spectacular view of the Strip. I took a photo, but it really doesn't justify how breathtaking it looked being there. I would definitely recommend anybody that is looking for a romantic spot for a date, anniversary, birthday, you name it.. any celebration.. this would definitely be a wonderful option to consider.   I was greeted by a busser? named Kevin and surprisingly he took care of me during my whole time dining there. The first that I ever experienced, but I didn't mind at all, since he was very attentive and gave me exceptional guest service from being my server, busser, and runner. Even boxed my leftovers and refilled my raspberry iced tea without having to ask not even once!!!  After placing my order, Kevin brought out a brown bag accompanied with extra virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar on the side. The idea of having two warm soft pillow bread sticks waiting for you in a brown bag was actually quite appealing and made it more appetizing to eat. It tasted light and delicious... warm bread sticks are hard to say no to... I indulged and enjoyed them.  For appetizer.. I ordered the Calamari Fritti. Love that it wasn't deeply fried to crisp, but just enough so you can enjoy the airy crunch and lightly breaded squid. I was given two sauces: a spicy marinara and a miso chili sauce that was in a black plastic sample cup to try out. Both sauces were delicious... the spicy marinara tasted so fresh like they just whipped that sauce together like it was made to order. The miso chili sauce was incredible in flavor... I wish they could make this in a jar to take home!!! It had this sweetness and then a tangy end note.. went very well with the calamari. I could have ate this like popcorn in a movie theater... stop only when there's nothing left :)   For the main entree... I ordered the Lobster Ravioli. The portion was beautiful... there were four plumply rounded raviolis with three enormously sized blackened shrimps, and three thick asparagus cooked to perfection. The pink sauce was oh so savory and the flavors were so balanced.. nothing was too rich to enjoy. The shrimp was tender and the spice gave it such an impact of delight. The ravioli was filled with a generous amount of lobster meat and the texture from the pasta itself was wonderful. Texture always gets me in pasta and this was definitely a winner.   I can't leave an Italian restaurant without trying my favorite dessert... Tiramisu!!! Great presentation and goodness gracious was it GOOD. One bite and I was dizzy from overdrive of joy. It comes with one lady finger cookie, topped with shaved dark chocolate flakes, and the filling also had bits of this flake, which was pleasing to break in your mouth and gave it... Character. The whipped cream was heavenly... so fresh and cooling to the tongue. I imagined bathing in this, it felt so silky and smooth in my mouth... AMAZING. The breading with the filling was luscious, soft, and moist. One of the best Tiramisu I ever had. Mind blowing magnificent in Tiramisu creations.   Overall, this place is striving with excellence.. in food and service. I came here right when they opened for dinner at 5p.m., not even 30 mins. and this whole place was packed. Must be a locals hangout or favorite. My favorite in Italian cuisine and definitely one that I rave about to many!!!",

Tonight was yet another wonderful night when we just wanted to go somewhere after a long week and it turned into a perfect evening out thanks to the service, atmosphere, view, and of course the food.  Mike always takes complete care of us, whether we just want an appetizer and glass of wine or we let him talk us into the amazing dinner specials.  Everything we have ever tried here is memorable and the only problem we have is not being able to finish, but we can always pack it up for later at home (even the unfinished bottle of wine).   Enjoying a lovely sunset from the patio and watching the city light up for the night is a bonus, as are the birds and flowers that make it so charming.  Everything starts with an oven-fresh bag of bread with a plate of EVOO and balsamic, then we usually start with a sizzling plate of oh so tasty shrimpies on a stone - even if we're going for the special it's hard to pass on this to start the night off.   The regular menu is fantastic, well portioned, and perfectly done, but we so often go for the irresistible specials - bone-in ribeye or sea bass or halibut or whatever it is that night, usually with outstanding crab cakes, scallops, or whatever they have that night.   This is one of those places that you're always sad to leave!  Although taking some home for a snack later or the next day helps a bit...",

We happened upon Ventano's through an internet search and could not have been more pleased.  From the moment we walked in the place was amazing.  Danielle took fantastic care of us and the entire staff worked together to make the experience phenomenal. When we arrived we noted the fantastic view of the strip and the potential sunset.  The staff worked as a team to make sure that the sun was never a bother and in a single synchronized effort made sure that pall of the blinds were open for the diners to enjoy the majesty of sunset.  Add to that the delicious food and completely reasonable prices and I am not sure why there was not a line out the door.   If I lived in Henderson I would be a regular for sure.  Again, thank you so much for the special attention and for a wonderful evening.",

    "text": "**Summary**        - Decor - I love the ambiance. It's not too dark like Carraba's and not too \"grandma's Italian backyard\" look like some Italian places like to try to go for. It's half way between comfortable and fancy. A very nice date place.        - View - A whole side of the restaurant is glass that overlooks a breathtaking view of the strip.        - Quality - The food is a definite step above Carraba's and probably the best Italian restaurant I've tasted in Vegas. Flavors are spot on and the food is very fresh.        - Price - Prices are on the higher end however. They range from 17 to 30. Most dishes are around $22ish.        - Bread - Their bread is freshly made and very fluffy on the inside. It's not too buttery or salty like other places. They give it to you with the usual olive oil/balsamic vinegar combo, but I asked for butter.        - Service - The staff were friendly with just the right amount of personality.  **Ordered**        - $10.50 Beef Carpaccio - This tastes the same to me everywhere (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5zDP3Y2hdh6GJL9DVbQ2KA?select=zDN6Mj_BxIL0fp9kSckz7A\">yelp.com/biz_photos/5zDP...</a>).        - $5.50 Insalata Classicche - Salad with balsamic vinaigrette. Dressing was slightly sweeter than average. Quite enjoyable.        - $25.00 Cioppino - Seafood soup with a light marinara sauce. Shrimp were small, clams were big, and mussels were normal size. There was also clams and fish in there. No carbs. Not a lot of food, but I ate it with the bread (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5zDP3Y2hdh6GJL9DVbQ2KA?select=E8MlJZVmtGXnb2pnXVS5QA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/5zDP...</a>).        - $7.00 Caramel Pecan Ice Cream Cake - If you like caramel, you'll love this (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5zDP3Y2hdh6GJL9DVbQ2KA?select=HcaYKMcD_s2qwvW9TX6L9g\">yelp.com/biz_photos/5zDP...</a>). **Recommendations**        - I'd recommend this place if you're looking for a nice date place or a quality meal.",

The bruschetta bread was just chopped, under-ripe tomatoes with what looked and tasted like Kraft parmesan cheese. The menu stated it would have basil, garlic, and parmesan cheese...there were like, two little shriveled up pieces of basil on one piece of the toast. From a restaurant with a dress code and recommended reservations, I expected A LOT more.   The steamed mussels did not smell fresh, and our order had no noticeable flavor. My husband kept picking broken shells out of his mouth, as there were several partially shattered mussels in the bowl. We were so dissatisfied with the food that we cancelled our entree order and left. They were kind enough to comp what we had eaten so far (which wasn't much of the order).   We had REALLY been looking forward to eating there, and actually drove 40 minutes to check it out.   Side Note: The website gives the impression that the restaurant is upscale and classy, but it has the typical dated \"Tuscan paintings on the wall\" that most stand alone italian restaurants have. I could have easily seen past that if the food was authentic and flavorful. Unfortunately, it was neither.",

    "text": "I made a reservation for 6:15 at this restaurant.  Arrived a few minutes early and was advised by the host that we would be seated closer to our reservation time.  We waited.  After about 15 minutes AFTER our reservation time (6:30) we asked how much longer it was going to be.  The host informed us they were just waiting for occupied tables to leave.  I asked if we could eat in the separate bar or the bar in the restaurant as we had a late flight out and were on somewhat of a timetable.  She said we could.  The bar in the restaurant was too full for the three of us so we went into the separate bar, where we then waited for menus.  We had to go retrieve them ourselves.  Then we were greeted by the bartender (after he had greeted another couple who came in AFTER us) and asked what we wanted to drink.  He then disappeared for a few minutes then returned only to ask a person in our party if they were 21 (he was 20).  We were then told we could not eat in the bar.  So after all of this we wasted 40 minutes only to be turned away.  POOREST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER!!!  I don't care if your food is excellent, if you can't be good to your customers you should not be in business.  It costs you NOTHING to be nice!  We left and will NEVER go back.",

If you are out for good Italian and don't care about management / service - this is your place! I am a regular diner at this restaurant - sadly the service has gone down quickly. And the \"sit you in your seat little girls\" were exceptionally rude. When I walked to the counter to pay my bill - of course because there was no waiter to take my payment so I had to pay at the take out door, the kids at the door upon explaining why I was paying here vs the table simply laughed and when I walked out the door mocked my party.

    "text": "The food here is close to 4 stars.  For the food you get, I feel the prices are reasonable.  So with that being said why 2 stars???  Clearly the SERVICE, it is one of the wrost in this town, unless you are out for at least a 2 hour ONE course meal.  Really????  This has been the case the last few times we went.  So why go back?  It is close to home and I thought they might have it figured out...NOPE...  Why would you have 2 people to handle the front door and ONLY ONE Waiter to take care of tables????  Why have 3 runners and only one waiter???  This place has been understaffed for a long time and I just don't understand the logic.  It is not that hard to have 2 full time waiters.  We went last night, we were seated and told our waiter was Mark.  Close to 10 minutes LITERALLY, before he came over and asked for a drink order.  Two drinks came and away he went, no ask of an appetizer, nothing.  Another person came and ordered an Iced Tea and a hot tea was ordered as well.  LITERALLY FIVE minutes to get the teas.  Finally an ask was made for appetizers and one ordered along with the food.  The appetizer came and was eaten very very slowly and aboiut the time we finished eating it, the food came.   NOW, in the defense of the restaurant, the food ordered did take some time to prepare and was prepared with quality, care and appreciation for what was being served.  A request was made for more hot tea which took the 5 minute waiting game again.  Once we were done, the plates were removed from the table in record speed...why can't accompish this with drinks and refills??  We did not want desert, we asked for the left overs to be placed in seperate bags as we were going in two directions.  So do you think the SAME guy who took the plates remembered who got what left overs???  NO, this morning it was discovered this task, which was only 3 plates was WAY ABOVE the level of competence of the guy who took the plates.  We asked for our bill and then watched the waiter run around, do several other things and pass our table several times before he finally came back and gave us our bill.  This whole process of getting the bill, 10 mintues...Needless to say we paid cash as we did not want to wait for him to take the card and never come back even though at this point we were one of ONLY 4 tables in the place.    He is a nice guy, but handling more then two 4 tops for him at a time, not a good idea...if you are going to keep the doors open to a certain time and have 2 people at the door, 3 runners including the manager, more then one server would be a good idea.  I believe we are done with this place unless we come across a day that we can spend 3 hours in a place to get a salad and a meal.  There are places in town with comparable prices if not better, with comparable food if not better and service that will BLOW THiS PLACE AWAY....",

They continued to check on us to make sure we were ok as we waited. I must say that for some reason when you sit at this restaurant its just so conducive to sitting and having long conversations. Eventually our table became free and we had a wonderful meal and reflected on the past year and made goals for the year ahead. I just want to thank the all the staff from the owner who spoke to us to the hostess and the waitstaff. This place has just a incredible staff that really cares about their guest and it makes us happy to come here every December.",

We reserved on Open Table and mentioned it was our anniversary, but they didn't acknowledge it. Looking at the menu, I thought prices were on the pricier side.  Bread was ok, but like others mentioned, why in a bag?",

    "text": "I am not sure how to feel about this place. I went here with a friend who raved about how awesome this place was. I have to say I was not impressed to start since we had a reservation and they still made us wait to be seated for 20 minutes. When we finally sat, no one apologized for us having to wait, and then we waited another 10 minutes just to be greeted. Bad form if you ask me. Once our waiter finally took our order, I got a German Riesling to drink and the lasagna. The wine was delicious except for the small fruit fly I found swimming in it....  The lasagna was pretty good, sauce was very thick and noodles were scarce.  If you like basic bolognase sauce and fresh cheese with about 2 noodle sheets then this is the lasagna for you.  The portion was pretty big even though it didn't look it. I did like it in the end but I didn't love it.   My friend had the baked clams and scallopini which both looked really good but I was too full to try it. The view here is awesome, and on a nice, clear night it is great for a romantic date night where you can overlook the strip with the sunset.   Overall I would say I am not sure if I want to give this place another chance since to me it was mediocre. Between the long wait, a bug in my wine and just okay service I can't say I am running back.",

We stopped in for a late lunch/early dinner.   Will definitely go back.  The restaurant has an \"old school\" feel to it, murals on the walls, red leatherette seating.  The service was impeccable, constant without being intrusive.  The food is excellent (we ordered several things off the menu, pasta,risotto, sandwich, pizza and fish) and each was flavorful and a good wine list.   The other reviews have gone into more detail so I would simply say -    Food - very good, hearty and plentiful Service - Excellent, engaged and impeccable Setting - Old school comfortable View - Worth seeing Bar - Full and embraceable Value - Good value - a little pricer than the million other Italian food joints around but oh so worth it.  We commend Ventano italian Grill & Seafood to you.   Lunch is very good but really, go have dinner and see how much the view adds to the experience!",

The worse part is I was so excited I bought 2, 1 for now and another for later and it definitely wasn't cheap. I won't be going again.",

    "text": "I had heard great things about this restaurant and really expected to love it. This is a really big restaurant and space that can feel overwhelming when you walk in. Our table had a gorgeous view of Vegas and the mountains, however the staff pulled the shade closed for most of the dinner (likely due to sun glare) so we were disappointed we did not have the view for most of our meal. I was with a big table of 8 people. We started with appetizers, rice balls, calamari, bruschetta and fresh bread for the table. All were tasty. Several of us ordered Caesar salads before dinner. I didn't think to ask for the dressing on the side though I wish I had. My salad was drenched in the dressing making it by so great to eat. For dinner entrees, the table ordered everything from steak and potatoes, lasagna, eggplant rollatini, bolognese and seafood/pasta combo. The entrees took more than 2 hours to be served to us. The chef proactively came out and apologized for the long wait and offered to give us a special dessert. We were all in good spirits, enjoying the company and understood this sometimes happens. Once the dinner entrees came out, it was mixed reviews. I was given manicotti instead of eggplant rollatini, my seafood companion thought the scallops were chewy. Others really liked their pasta meal. I did not bother telling the server my meal was wrong because at that point we had been at the restaurant for over 3 hours and just wanted to leave. The chef ended up sending a large plate of ice cream, donuts, etc. for the table to enjoy. I might give this place one more try next time I am in town, but likely will try another restaurant since there are so many places to eat near Vegas.",

The hostess was a bit on the slow side and really did not enjoy her job. She preferred to chit chat with other employees rather than paying attention to the guests.  The food was okay for the price. I did however really enjoy the oysters. If i were to come back that would be the only thing I would come back for.",

We sat on the terrace outside that has spectacular view of the strip  We ate a lot :) I had oysters,  salad caprese,  appetizer lamp chops sizzling ...than lasagna and cioppino.  Being spoiled by restaurants in Las vegas everything was exceptionally tasty and fresh ! I don't think they need raw onion on the mozzarella salad but I happen to be ok with onion , if you are not let them know .  The atmosphere is very cozy ... a family restaurant.  People were celebrating birthdays and stuff . I think I can even bring my 2 year old with me and it would be appropriate. Austin served us and he was very accommodating   l liked that he suggested a half portion to try a dish so I didn't risk being stuck with a dish I wouldn't enjoy. We all be back !",

    "text": "I want you to know it's challenging for me to give you three stars when your food is FIVE *****. We've eaten at your place a few times over as the food is simply magnificent. Salmon wrapped in potato is one of the best courses I've had.  I even see the Chef...don't know his name...come out and table touch. This is a lost art of service because EVERYONE loves a Chef!   Now, your SERVICE CHALLENGES. Firstly, I speak with experience.  All three of my dining experiences were the same in regards to service so it's important for you to know it wasn't a one time problem. I will not use any of your team member's names as I will never cause them embarrassment.  Overall, they're ALL incredibly friendly and try their best...but lack training.  My background is F&B Director at 5 Star Properties in CA and I ran F&B operations with Harrah's and Stratosphere. I will try to be brief.  1.  I made a reservation through OPENTABLE and requested a booth.  Host persons are nonchalant when telling me they don't honor booth reservations.  We arrived at 5:30p and did not get a booth. When menus were placed, you still had the KRUG tasting dinner on the left hand side of the menu. I became excited as I know Krug product well. But then continued reading  and the actual event took place weeks back. What? I hope your other guests didn't experience this.  2.  Each occasion of my dining experiences, your food runners deliver the food and do not know who gets what items...no matter what course it is. They call out the items. Also each time they served me FIRST instead of my wife and there's no excuse for this. I am old school. This is an easy fix.   3. We ordered a Caprese. They brought no side plates or cutlery. My wife and I ended up using our BB plates and silverware.  4. Entree's arrived. I had to ask for new silverware. Requested a refill of Butter Chard...arrived very late as our server may have forgotten or a bartender issue...things happen...I understand but it's the accumulation of service mishaps is why I mention it.  5. My wife requested a side of Parmesan Cheese....it never arrived. 6. When finished, service staff cleaned my plate first without even asking if my wife was done.  She still had items left on her plate.  They need to ask the table if we are finished. Please don't just clear plates! 7. Had to flag down Server for my check.  I left a 15% gratuity because they're friendly.  That's usually a standard with everyone who receives great service.  I on the other hand leave 25%-30% which is common for me if service is pristine.  These issues can be corrected in a days worth of training by your FOH Managers and BOH participation.  Bottom line is...we will return.  Your food is just too good to stay away. As I said earlier, your service staff is very friendly...they try hard....but they don't know the intricacies of fine-dining service.  And I do think of your restaurant as fine-dining. Is that a good assumption? Your food and ambiance represent that.  See you again soon and thank you for addressing these issues.",

The sign does advertise 24 hour gaming, however. I have the most experience with the bar area and it's a grand spot to enjoy some video poker and their very decent wine and beer selection. For example, they have 3 Dogfish Head brews in their \"beer lineup\", although only 2 were available last time I asked about them. One is gluten free (T'weasonale- w/ strawberries & honey) and I liked it a lot! Also, Crafthaus is on tap so right on! I gotta say, I don't think you'll get a glass of wine here that you won't be impressed by.   I don't eat here often but see others eating at the bar regularly. On their menu on their Web site, there's a disclaimer (disclosure?) \"no split checks\" but they will \"gladly accept multiple forms of payment.\" Not sure how to even process that information!  Also, the latest wine list shown on their Web site is 19 pages long!  There's usually a bunch of regulars at the bar and I may be inclined to become one  if only the bar was nonsmoking! Sigh. I used to get gaming offers mailed to me and haven't received any in a long time. Double sigh. Check out the view, it's one of the finest of the Strip from this tony part of Henderson.",

    "text": "Very disappointing experience here. We arrived around 5:00 on a Friday and the restaurant was practically empty. The furniture really needs to be updated but the rest of the decor is fine. The green cloth booths reminded me of a Marie Calendars or Dennys from the 80's or 90's.   A gentlemen in regular clothes (manager maybe?) who didn't introduce himself came by to take our drink and food order. We started with the arancine and ordered the potato wrapped salmon ($27) and cheese ravioli ($21) with pink sauce for our entree's. Warm bread took a while to arrive but was hot and fresh when it did.   The arincine were huge. Full of rice and melted cheese served on marinara sauce. The entree's arrived and were presented nicely. The ravioli were just okay, nothing great and sure not worth $21. The potato wrapped salmon was overcooked and very dry. It was also very fishy tasting. I found out they use farm raised salmon and not wild caught so that may be the reason. Our original server never returned to check on us or I would have brought it to his attention.   For dessert we ordered the caramel pecan ice cream cake. It sounded much better than it was. It was a slice of chocolate ice cream on a chocolate crust and caramel sauce which would have been fine served like that. However they decided to pour a bananas foster sauce over it which made no sense and did not taste good. It completely over powered the ice cream and caramel, just way too many flavors together. Almost like a burnt banana flavor. We didn't finish it.   Service was very strange. It was odd we had one person take our order, a different person deliver the food, another person clear the table, another person bring the dessert menu and a fifth different person take the desert order and bring our check. We never knew who was actually taking care of us.   Overall a really disappointing dinning experience. 2 stars for the bread and arancine. Can't see returning here with so many Italian options in Henderson.",

One thing so important to me...hot food. There is nothing worse then cold food. Not here. All our meals came to the table really HOT. So hot you had to wait to eat it, no problem here.  Hot food, because of the service. We had 3 different servers tonight. That tells you this place cares about your dinning experience.   Also, voted one of the best views of Vegas. Sunsets are spectacular. View of Vegas with the mountain range behind, and the sun setting behind that.   Great patio and great food   Dont miss this place.",

    "text": "Went here for dinner with some friends on Friday night around 5pm. When we walked in, there was no one in the dining area and only one at the bar. When the rest of our party showed up, a few tables were in use. By the time we finished eating, the place was packed! Highly recommend reservations for those dining after 7pm.  The parking is behind the building or on the north side, and the entrance is located on the south side near the gas station. I would recommend dropping off those who have disabilities or trouble walking at the entrance before parking.  When you enter you have the host station, to the right a small bar with gaming, and a large dining area. There is outdoor seating on the patio, which has a beautiful view of the city. We were lucky enough to watch the sunset which was spectacular.   Service was great, a main waiter and a helper. Menu is extensive with plenty of options. I went with the potato wrapped salmon in a lobster sauce. It was cooked  right, the potato wrapping unique and added a nice flavor to the salmon. The lobster sauce was a bit much but worked with the accompanying risotto. I enjoyed my food. The table got shrimp scampi, fettucine alfredo shrimp, and lasagna. All portions were plenty big enough. Prices are a little high, but you get a fine dining type of experience so its fair. My vodka cranberry was $9...ouch.  Overall, beautiful view, great service, and good food. I'll be back to try it again.",

    "text": "I absolutely love coming here. There are quite a few delicious Italian restaurants in the valley; this one has a warm, familial vibe. The open dining area would remind one of a family's house. The only obvious difference is, no family home would have booths for seating.  Also, good to note, they have a large deck area for dining. Perfect to watch the sun set over the valley. Also, a wonderful view of the strip.   On one particular night, my husband and I ordered the beef carpaccio - well, we always order it - the beef was sliced paper thin, the mustard swirled all over was just the right amount, and the insalata in the center was a beautiful contrast to the beef. The lettuce was slightly overdressed. Still amazing.  For main course, we had Rigatoni Portofino - instead of ham, I subbed with prosciutto  and added chicken - and the Saltimbocca with chicken. Mine was delicious! The prosciutto was a brilliant decision; added another texture to the dish, a crispy bite. The Saltimbocca, was on the opposite side of the scale - horrible. Sauce was too salty, the potatoes were done in the oven and then fried-finished in the pan, also too salty...   For those of you who've been to Italy or are Italian, Saltimbocca is traditionally prepared with veal. Why didn't the waiter suggest this to my husband, when he ordered the chicken!? Saltimbocca should only be offered as a veal dish. In my opinion.  We'll keep going back. One bad dish won't deter!",

As with almost anyplace in Vegas, the service excels.  I was very impressed with the hot breadsticks served with olive oil and balsamic vinegar as opposed to the salty garlic spread at a certain chain.  Our appetizer of lamb chops on a hot stone was amazing -- the lamb was cooked to perfection and without the grease that sometimes accompanies lamb. My veal Marsala was also excellent.  Unlike many other Italian places, Ventano serves the pasta to the side of the entree as opposed to beneath it.  However, they still provide plenty of the sauce to accompany the pasta.  In fact, the fettucine with Marsala sauce could be a meal itself.  I cannot recommend this place enough if you're willing to make a bit of a drive.",

In spite of the packed house we were seated at our reservation time and greeted promptly by the service staff. I LOVE the warm, fresh rolls right out of the oven; they were wonderful!!  We started with the stuffed mushroom appetizer and were not disappointed; scrumptious!!  My husband had a baked pasta dish with the spicy sauce and he loved it.  I had the Chicken Proscuitto and it was delicious!!  I couldn't wait to scarf down my leftovers for lunch the next day. The service was excellent.  We brought our own bottle of special wine and were not charged a corkage fee.  Las Vegas has several very good 'real' Italian restaurants and this one is my favorite!!

As I was digging out the brown pieces of basil while the waiter stood there holding the cheese, I told him that the basil should never be cut until the plate is ready to be served otherwise they turn brown.  He forgot to bring me more basil but it would not have changed the taste of this dish so I let it go.  My guest ordered the gnocchis which were satisfactory but not exceptional or especially good.  We were going to place an order to go plus a dessert but decided against it based on our meals.",

The gluten free pasta is so good you won't even know it's gluten free!  Like...hmmm...I think everything is a love here!!  Dislike absolutely nothing!  Favorite dishes 1) Chicken Francese with risotto \"OMG lick the plate delicious\" and 2) the shrimp scampi with risotto.  We love shrimp on stone as an appetizer!  The Staggs Leap wine is so good but it will set you back $89...worth it though!",

The best I have ever had.  Just great.  The presentation was first class and the flavors were spot on.  My entree was Ventano Tortellini.  Just as good or better than the appetizer.  This is not a dish that I would normally order, but I wanted to give it a try.  I am glad that I did because it was just perfection.  There is an extensive wine list that is reasonably priced.  I could not fit in dessert, but I certainly will next time.  Can't wait to get back.  Thanks Ventano!!",

The food itself is a three to four stars at most. Huge portions, so be prepared to bring some home ^^.  For the most part the service was just below mediocre. After we got our order we weren't checked up on anymore. I was left without water for the most part.   The ambiance of the place is very relaxing and romantic, and the parking was very easy.

For an appetizer, two of us shared the 1/2 pound of shrimp on a sizzling granite stone.  The shrimp were tiny things, but tasty.  The dipping sauce was quite good, but the shrimp could have used some more spicing.  One had a Caesar salad that was very good, perhaps the best dish of the evening.  For main courses, we had Ventano Spiedini (chicken cutlets stuffed with cheese), Risotto Alla Milanese with blackened shrimp(4), and Chicken Saltimbocca.  We all thought the dishes were OK.  The sauce of my saltimbocca was very good.  The person who had the risotto was disappointed with the dish. The chef does not use any salt.  My wife, who rarely salts anything, used more than I've ever seen.  We skipped dessert.  Service was very good.  Our server was top notch.  The bus person could have refilled the iced tea faster, but that was minor.  The view would be excellent on a cooler evening, enjoying the lighted Strip from the patio.  I don't think I'd return.",

    "text": "With Groupon in hand, my wife, visiting mother, and I coasted into Ventano for dinner on the way between Laughlin and North Las Vegas. We had reservations so were able to be seated in a comfortable booth, and the meal started off well enough, but too soon it became like riding a roller coaster that eventually fell off the tracks.   I thought warm bread brought to the table and left there in a brown bag was a nice rustic touch. Vinegar and oil were promptly poured, but I had to ask for butter THREE times before any was brought to the table. Calamari Fritti with a fruity flavored, miso-based Chili Sauce nicely complemented the large serving of tender, lightly breaded Calamari. And, a Lemon Aioli was also prepared and brought out on request. It was rather oily, but lemony as well, and it was a nice gesture of the kitchen to whip it up on short notice, and not charge for this extra condiment. The spicy Marinara Sauce also served with the Calamari was mild but not very flavorful.   A Caesar Salad featuring Romaine Lettuce as it should was enhanced by an excellent creamy Caesar dressing, but I had to ask for ground pepper to be sprinkled over the greens. Presentation was nice on a porcelain plate featuring a green leaf design.   At this point what ensued was a tremendous wait between remaining courses. For some reason, the waiter did not take our entree orders until 20 minutes after the Calamari appetizer was finished. Then we watched TWO tablefuls of diners who came in after we had already been seated get their entrees served before us, finish their meals, have their leftovers bagged, chat a bit while sipping wine, and then leave the premises before we were ever served any of our entrees.   The setting was romantic, with a very nice view of the Stratosphere in the distance. But by now my wife was understandably grumpy because she was starving! It was around an hour of dead time before the entrees were at last brought to us. When they did, Shrimp Angelo with Penne coated in Lemon Butter Sauce was good but not so for real thick Alfredo Sauce. And, I was surprised to see that, rather than being cooked within layers of veal and sage, just one length of Prosciutto that didn't even appear to have been fully cooked had been spread on top of my Veal Saltimbocca. And, only little pieces of sage were mixed in with the veal. Otherwise, the veal in a light amount of Lemon Butter Sauce was tasty next to Fettuccine Alfredo. But this was not classic Veal Saltimbocca. However, Roasted Potatoes were great.   We were never given a chance to order dessert. Instead, our contrite server, unbidden, brought out an excellent Tiramisu that was not too heavy on coffee flavoring, and said that this was compliments of the house to make up for our long wait between courses that he claimed occurred because the kitchen \"got behind.\" But he didn't explain how other later-arriving diners were able to leapfrog us in receiving their food orders.   At Ventano this night, I even ran into aggravation inside the men's restroom. First, the water from a faucet would not shut off. Then I learned that only one of two so-called motion sensor towel dispensers was working. What ensued next was a battle to attract the attention of this Sensor Cut paper towel machine to recognize my frantic movements and cajole it to finally disgorge two paper towels so I could dry my wet hands.   I haven't decided yet whether or not I will give Ventano another chance to redeem itself. The food was pretty tasty on the whole, and the ambiance very nice. But there are so many other Italian restaurants in the Las Vegas valley where the food is equally good or even better tasting, and where one doesn't have to be concerned about possible one- or two-star service to accompany what could very well be four-star food.",

I have heard about it for quite some time, but since it's nowhere near my neighborhood, I hadn't made my way down there until yesterday for Mother's Day.   My fella and I took our mom's here for a Mother's Day lunch. Both of them adore Italian food and we wanted to take them some place they hadn't tried before. My fella isn't as keen on Italian food as the rest of us, so he wasn't thrilled, but wanted to make the mommies happy.   We walked up and the smell was intoxicating and inviting. We asked for a window table, which is totally worth it by the way. There are great views of the strip, It would probably be much better during the evening to see the lights on the strip, but it's still worth it.   Our server was incredibly friendly and helpful. The food was delicious and even my fella was sold on this place.   I ordered the Cioppino, since I was trying to eat a little lighter than usual after a very filling meal the night before. The Cioppino was heavenly. Tasty and fragrant, just as I was hoping. My mom got the lasagna and she was in love with it. The portions were large and even after eating and sharing her meal with everyone, there was more than half left to take home for dinner. My fella got the filet with shrimp and he loved it. The shrimp were grilled and delicious. Great choice.   I was looking around from table to table and everyone's dishes looked great. I can't wait to try this place again in the evening when it's warm and clear enough for a nice view of the strip on the patio. I won't even mind the drive.",

    "text": "Had dinner on Valentine's night. Even thiugh we had reservations and on time, we waited about 15 minutes to get a table. The hostess was kind enough to apologize for the wait. As soon we were seated we were given warm bread at the table and drink orders taken. Haven't been to this restaurant in awhile, seemed very crowded with tables to maximize the space. This took away from the ambiance of a nice quiet restaurant. Despite this rocky start, the food was great! The portions were out of control. The portions could easily feed 3 people. My son commented that he really liked his chicken fettuccine alfredo- that is huge coming from a teenager. The service was also great- very attentive and friendly.  We will be back again when it's not so busy so we can get a booth to enjoy the views of the city from the big picture windows.",

    "text": "Well, last night's visit was horrible.  It was our wedding anniversary, and we had some of the worst service I can remember.  Our waiter (Austin) was out of his league, and pretty much ruined our evening.  We ordered a bottle of wine, and ten minutes later we were told they didn't have it, so we picked another.  We ordered the bruschetta, and sadly the bread was rock hard, and the topping was flavorless.  They also forgot to bring it to us before our entrees.    The main courses were good, thus the two stars.  After they were delivered, we were abandoned.  After finishing the meal, we go 20 minutes without a check in from our waiter.  He was over polishing wine classes.  We moved all our plates and glasses to the edge of the table hoping that would spark a visit.  Nothing.  We had to get the server's assistant to clear our table.  She was able to get him to at least bring our check.  There was no mention of desert, because at this point it was very clear he had failed us and wanted to end his shift.  When you are shelling out over $100 for dinner for two, I expect good service.    The Vegas valley has an abundance of great food, so there is little room for error.",

Had to ask constantly for our server, Michael, even when we were one of four parties left in the restaurant. Never saw Michaels face after he delivered our food......had to ask twice for our bill, a busboy took our payment. When asked if Michael was still there, he assured us he was. Again, we never saw him.  Food was fair. The special, Dover sole at $28, was so tough I could not cut it with my knife, but no one came by to check on our meals.  When asked to speak to the person in charge, the hostess replied to go to Yelp. Lovely way to do business.....? In reply..... Mr. Briand....we were in on 10/21. Our reservation was at 7:15",

    "text": "Ambiance is nice. Great service. Clean. Attentive staff.  Our waiter said that the restaurant is known for their 'dinner specials' so I chose the sole with crabmeat with risotto and scallops. This dish was good.  Nice size scallops (3) and the risotto was creamy and tasty.  I wish the chef added more sauce to the fish (sauce was delicious). The crabmeat was a bit much for me atop the sole, but it wasn't bad. The presentation of the dish was executed exceptionally. You can see the kitchen staff took time to plate their dishes. Overall it's was okay, but not worth $35.  My sister ordered the chicken scalopini -sauteed onion and mushroom with white wine tomatoes and butter. This dish was good but deceiving. At a glance it seems like it's a white sauce but the plate came out and it was a red (more like marinara sauce). It was still yummy, BUT not what we were expecting.  The Caesar salad was yummy (a bit on the tart side) and the portions are huge!!!! An order of the funghi ripieni (stuffed mushrooms) was brought to our table but we sent it back.  It wasn't terrible, but not what we expected.  Very basic -stuffed with seasoned breadcrumbs and baked. Not what we were expecting, but again not horrible.   For desert we ordered the creme brulee and caramel pecan ice cream cake.  The creme brulee was yummy (custard was good) but the sugar didn't caramelize right. The caramel pecan ice cream cake was meh.  Wasn't worth trying you could tell they order in bulk and keep in the freezer.   Overall a good experience and I will for sure come back. It's a nice gem in Henderson. I love the outside lanai and the panoramic views of the city of Las Vegas.  Pretty much any seat in that restaurant is a great seat. I would stay away from the specials and order off the menu next time tho! Hope this helps!!!",

We were seated almost  immediately at about 9 PM on a Saturday.  From the apps to dessert, service was great. Wine list is adequate, decent prices. We had the shrimp on a stone for an app and it was delicious.  We shared a spinach salad and the portion was huge.  We both had the steak special, cooked medium rare, tender and delish!  The garlic mash potatoes were warm and creamy, the green beans just al dente. Portions are very generous!  We have lunch tomorrow.   For dessert we shared creme brulee.  It was a little to soft for my taste, but not enough to knock off a star. Overall, an excellent experience. Highly recommend!!",

    "text": "My wife and I decided to range far afield to have dinner and a movie...all the way to the other side of the Valley. After reading the reviews here on Yelp, and seeing that this restaurant was close to the theater we were going to, we decided to give it a try. After eating there, we decided it was time they got a justly deserved 5-star review.  Since we were going to a movie at 7, we arrived early and there were only 3-4 couples in the entire place. By 6 p.m., they were jam packed including a large wine-tasting dinner and a large wedding party.  From the moment we arrived and were seated at a booth looking all the way out across the valley to the strip, until we polished off the last bite of tiramisu and last sip of cappuchino, the service was immaculate, attentive without hovering and helpful with suggestions. The server recommended an excellent bottle of wine and, when I couldn't make up my mind between eggplant parm and the capellini alla pomodoro, she said the eggplant comes with a pasta side and she would have the kitchen do the capellini. That sold me.  I had read that the portions were large. The wife and I usually split entrees but she wanted the penne arrabiata which I don't care for and she doesn't care for eggplant, a recent addition to my 'likes'. True to what we had read, the portions were huge. She ate about 1/3 of her penne and I ate about half of my eggplant and capellini...enough left for dinner the next night.  As to the qualify of the food, I can only rave. I read that someone complained that their food was served too hot. Well, one of my biggest peeves is when food comes to me lukewarm as if it had been merely reheated or had been left to sit under the heat lamps. Both of us received food that was steaming and piping hot, so much so that we actually had to give it a minute to cool down. It was clearly right out of the oven or skillet.  Once I took my first bite, I could hardly keep from burning my mouth because the eggplant was too good to wait and the capellini couldn't not have been more perfectly 'al dente'...not mushy or tough...perfect. The sauce was amazing. My wife also loved her penne arrabiata although she said it was just a little too spicy for her.  We finished off dinner with 'due cappuccini' and tiramisu. The cappuccino was perfectly hot, just the right foam and just the right espresso bitterness. Needless to say, the tiramisu brought tears to my eyes as it is my favorite desserts and this was really one of the best.  As to the price, we ended paying about $100.00 including a $32.00 bottle of wine. We have paid a lot more for a lot less elsewhere. Considering the atmosphere, quality of food and quality of service, we felt it was a great value.  We wish we had something like this on the NW side of town and can easily see us making the drive again to eat at this wonderful restaurant.",

I always order the Rigatoni Portofino for my entree.  It is one of Chef Arnold's creations and a great one.  Tip: It is even better the next day.

I've always recommened a wedding party of nearly 25 people from out of town to check this place out. At first they were hesitant as they were staying on the strip and it is about 15-20 minutes away but once they went they loved it and thanked me for the recommendation.

So I opted to be seated instead. The dining room is nice. Not romantic or anything. Like a step up from the Olive Garden. There were a lot of families with kids there. The view of the Strip is quite nice. (Tip: Ask to be seated by the window so you can enjoy the view.) The service was great. Very attentive and friendly. Perhaps I just ordered the wrong items? I started with the oysters. They were served on ice with a lemon (with no sleeve / catching thing) and just cocktail sauce with horseradish (no vinaigrette). They were ok, but didn't taste all that fresh. I then had the linguine with clams in red sauce. It was served with the clams in the shells (which I love), but they were all mixed in with the pasta, making getting the clams out a challenge (all the linguine was tangled in the shells). When I have had this dish before, the clams are usually on top around the sides and not mixed in. The sauce was not \"zesty\" as described and was quite watery. Not a particularly good food experience. But the by-the-glass and by-the-half-bottle wine list was decent. And the service and view were great. Perhaps I'll try it again and order something different. But my initial impression was it's something just a step or so up from a chain place. There are definitely far better Italian places around town.",

Got to outside table 108 out there and finally got water 10 minutes while other people seated after us got drinks and bread.  Dinner was ok my husband had seafood and some of the clams were not open sign of bad clam no pasta with dinner they should of not served the non-opened clams daughter's pasta was fine sauce was good, I had lemon chicken and chicken was fatty. Asked for bread sticks never got them.  Also outside there were steamers and they were so overpowering we couldn't see and my daughter got really wet.",

They have many grilled items that I enjoy as well as some of their pastas. My girl and I took our mothers for Mothers Day and they loved it. Great views of the strip, too. We'd come more often if we didn't live so far.",

    "text": "The atmosphere of this place is great! However, the food is average at best.  I would've have given the place four stars and the food two stars, hence the three star rating.  The view and out door patio are terrific! They had a nice wine selection and the Riesling was delish.  The staff is excellent in every aspect.  But, I found myself wishing the food was just a bit better.  They give you bread sticks in a paper bag before your meal with olive oil and balsamic for dipping.  Yes, this is cute and the bread stayed warm,  but it didn't taste fresh or house made.  I had a Caesar salad which was pretty good and definitely a large portion for a dinner salad.  For the main course, I had capellini pomodoro. It was okay.  Nothing to write home about. I think they used canned tomatoes.  It was a huge portion and I don't think I even ate half of it.  My husband ordered the ribeye steak and shrimp special, which I of course sampled.  The steak was covered in a peppercorn sauce.  The sauce itself was good but too heavy and not necessary on a good steak.  Plus the sauce looked like it sat on top of the steak for awhile and had slightly congealed.  He loved the shrimp.  It came with au gratin potatoes which looked more like mashed potatoes au gratin style.  They tasted okay but perhaps they were a day old.  This time we did not have dessert.  I was craving pasta primavera with fresh vegetables and they didn't have that option on the menu.  Before we completely write this place off, I am definitely going back to try a different dish and dessert.  It really is a lovely restaurant.  I want the food to live up to the staff's service and the perfect view of the city!",

I think I could go back every day. The caprese salad was my old standby, but after being a little adventurous and trying the GHOR salad, I was hooked. Also, the shrimp on a stone, or lamb chops on a stone starters were awesome. I didnt get an entree. because that was enough to fill me up, that and all the beers :) I recommend this place if only for its salads and app's. Plus there is a great patio, with an amazing view of the city.",

    "text": "This is the second venture, I believe of the Carmine restaurants in town. They offer the most ridiculously amazing Italian around, along with a hot Italian serving staff to bring it to your table. I do remember both my boyfriend and my father telling me to shut my mouth and stop drooling over the busboys...there really is something about a restaurant with a cute staff that will keep you coming back! But, back to the food...there is an oyster bar, or a gelato bar, they have switched it back and forth a few times, but regardless, both are great for sitting and sharing a coffee and gelato, or oysters and some vino. What is best about Ventano's however, if it's after hours atmosphere. After the restaurant has cleared out for the evening, the bar remains open. It is a pretty standard bar, but they leave the patio seating that overlooks the city open. When it is a clear night you can see the entire strip, and look down on parts of Green Valley as well. The bartender will come check up on you while you are back there, so you don't even have to get up for drinks. It is a casual spot for a night out, without huge crowds and loud music. Instead, the crowd is minimal (if any) and the music is soft instrumentals. Go for the food, but stick around for a relaxing evening on the patio...pretty fun!  Recommended entre: I always get the gnocchi, but with marinara on the side.  Recommended drink: Ask you server what red wines are available, I have yet to go wrong with any of their picks.",

We opened it to find small long rolls, heated but with no taste. Then we had the bruschetta. It too had no taste. Lacked garlic and good bread. Next we had baked little neck clams. These also were tasteless except for the chemical taste the clams had like they were kept in a icebox that was just cleaned with bleach. Two of us ordered the shrimp scampi. The shrimp wasn't bad but the asparagus tasted burnt. My daughter had the Thanksgiving dinner and it was all bad. The turkey was too thick. The stuffing was lumpy and tasteless along with the potatoes. My girlfriend ordered a dinner which had to be sent back because the breading on the shrimp was burnt. My daughter got a choice of pumpkin or apple pie. She chose apple to go. When we got home there was pumpkin in the bag. I would never recommend this restaurant to anyone. Awful!!  I am from the east coast. This is definitely not an Italian restaurant.",

Since my husband works 6 days a week and we have 2 small girls, date night is a rare occasion, we were looking to enjoy the neighborhood restaurant that we had never visited.  The girl at the door quickly greeted us and was pleasant showing us to our table.  We were shown to a table on the balcony.  We sat there 20 minutes before even a server or anyone came to our table to bring us water.  They said that our server would be right with us and he did come by and dropped off bread and said he would be back to take our order.  He seemed rushed as it appeared that there were only two waiters in the place with an almost full restaurant.  We could see our waiter through the large windows on the balcony.  We watched him greet people as they came into the restaurant with hugs and kisses and taking their order right away.  He did that to about two tables, which took another 30 minutes.  We sat there for about 50 minutes without putting in a food order, eating stale bread and water.  Enough was enough!!! We left and went to Settebello, which had much better service.",

The grilled romaine salad is excellent and something I've never had before but sure am glad I tried it! The shrimp on the stone is a must EVERY time we go there, the dipping sauce is addicting! I always seem to order the Ventano Tortellini, HIGHLY recommended! Chicken, mushrooms, tortellini in a pink sauce covered with cheese and baked in an oven. Its like \"adult mac and cheese\" and I can't get enough of it. My dad usually gets linguine with prawns and scallops and fresh basil, and raves about how fresh everything tastes and how perfect the pasta noodles are cooked. They also have a nice wine and beer selection for those interested. The staff are all super friendly and always remember us when we come in. This is a great neighborhood restaurant that is as good as anything on the strip or anywhere else. Prices seem fair because i'm ALWAYS happy with what I eat, I'll pay a few extra dollars for something I truly enjoy eating. And i havent had anything here that i didnt like. I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for really good Italian food. Also, the view of the strip out the huge windows (or out on the patio) is amazing! We'll be back soon! Keep up the great work guys!",

Then waited another 15 minutes for a waiter to come to our table, so a friend went to the bar himself to get our drinks. Eventually Manager Mike came over and apologized. We order an appetizer, and the manager offer to add a little extra to the plate. No complimentary appetizer or dessert for our excessive wait.  Finally the waiter came and it got better. Food was great but we did not get offered drink refills. We finished our meal and the waiting began again. The busser cleared our plates but the waiter still had not come over.  After 10 minutes we asked the busser for our check. Still no waiter or manager.  No offer for dessert, no drink refills, just waiting. The busser took the bill and we walked out without the waiter or manager saying have a good night.  A total disregard for customer service left a bitter taste. We will not be going back to Ventano.",

Service was extremely slow. The general manager wound up taking our order. The food came rather quickly which was good. The food was mediocre at best. I had shrimp on the stone which had little flavor. I think the most unique thing about it was the stone. Have no idea why so many people recommended it. Its a sizzling stone with a bunch of shrimp that were previously frozen. Nothing to write home about. I also had the grilled romaine hearts. That was the best thing we ordered. It would have been better with blue cheese cause the Gorgonzola had little flavor. My grandfather had the eggplant rotolini. The eggplant was ok but the sauce had no flavor...no spice, it was just sweet. The same with the side of pasta that came with it. He also had a side of grilled veggies. There were mostly potatoes in the side and they veggies were very oily. Thankfully we had a groupon. That made the disappointment more bearable. Wouldn't go back there again.",

    "text": "Hands down best Italian food place in Vegas plus the best service that I had at any restaurant. We sat in the booth so we had a nice view of the strip. The breadsticks were good and we ordered the half pound of grilled shrimp as the appetizer which was excellent. I had the shrimp scampi which was excellent. Everyone that I was with enjoyed their meal. Our drinks never went below the halfway point. I like how you can pay at the table when your done. The waiter will bring a small machine that you can swipe your card on and put the tip in the total. Great atmosphere to eat in and I highly recommend this place but if your overweight the only healthy thing they have is the half pound of grilled shrimp appetizer. If your obese stay out of this place because you will eat a 1,800 plus calorie meal along with the breadsticks and like the typical American that you are you probably going to eat desert which you clearly don't need. Just giving free advice so that you can live longer.",

As always he gets his favorite meal of Chicken Francaise which they do a very nice job here, juicy and lightly battered. I started with a regular Caesar salad which was good and was not ice cold but I did see a few pieces of lettuce that looked discolored. For my entree I ordered the Spaghetti with a Bolognese sauce with a side of the grilled sausage. Pasta was cooked perfectly and the Bolognese was fresh and meaty. The portions were good sized and were filling. Service was a little slow which bugged me since it took a while to get the waiters attention at various times for refills, getting/not offered the fresh ground black pepper for my Caesar Salad after it was dropped off and waiting a while to get the check after it was asked for, when it was not very busy. I also dislike when you are ready to pay they bring out a mobile credit card machine to your table to swipe your card, kinda tacky to me. Overall, priced a little higher than I expected but the quality shows for most part. Place is very far away from where I live, and would consider again if I was in the area.",
