The prices were pretty high and don't get me wrong, the entrance looked super grand with it's decorations and even floor to ceiling waterfall structure near the doorway.  I felt like I was in japan with it's pseudo geisha house feeling with the wooden bridges and koi ponds.  The food was just mediocre though.  The chef did the standard knife and food tricks and the food just was alright... disappointing since the prices were so high.  I had the filet mignon and chicken and I think I could have had the same at another teppanyaki place for a cheaper price.  You live and learn! Sadly, the other table across from us were very disgruntled and unhappy after their orders since their food took so long and the wrong orders were given :( yikes!!! It should have been a much better experience for the price and hype ... meh!",

Be aware they charge extra for \"sharing\" so be very clear even if you're just putting someone's order on your check. No help for a vegetarian (other reviews said there were options but the waiter said no substitutions and no help) so had to eat only the fried veg app & edamame.

The night got off to a somewhat rocky start because by 7:15 the chef was still not at our table. We were worried because we had a show to make at the Mirage in a couple of hours, so we advised a waitress of our show time. The manager came over to confirm our show time and they were very kind and accommodating, however, I don't think the chef actually showed up until 7:20 or so. So take note, it's probably best to let them know if you have somewhere to be when you call to make your reservation.  The food was really great, if inauthentic. I had the filet mignon, which was tender and flavorful. My husband had Rocky's Choice (chicken and steak), whichw as also good, but the chicken is nothing special so if we ever go again I think he'll probably stick with the steak.   Our chef was very friendly and I have no com;plaints about the service. The restaurant itself is beautiful, too.",

    "text": "This place has been solid for years, but I have an interesting observation about the cooking process. The chef never changes those steel spatulas, so during the chicken fried rice cooking process, he cuts the raw chicken up on the grill and then leaves it there and then immediately heads over to the rice and stirs it up with those same thongs. He goes back and forth between raw and rice and even gets those things into some veggies. So in theory, all of the chicken fried rice should be poisoned and yet somehow I have never gotten sick. For years, we are taught to keep the raw and everything else separate. We finally found the exception. OH yeah, this was a free birthday meal. Go to Benihana website and join free birthday club. You get a $30 certificate and if you order Fried Rice and Hibachi Chicke, you will pay $3.40 for full meal.",

Luckily, our chef had a personality and was chatting up a storm with us. But I can imagine how quiet dinner would have been if our chef was all show and no talk. He did a number of tricks throughout dinner. My favorite was the onion ring volcano.  The food itself was pretty good. First some a bowl of soup (simple but it had a good base), salad (too much dressing), then some shrimp for everyone. One side order of fried rice for two is a good amount to share if you're not trying to completely stuff your face. So the fried rice... Dang they put a lot of butter, but it's okay because it's \"Japanese butter\" so our chef said jokingly. I mean it was good but obviously that's the #1 thing everyone talks about from here and definitely overrated in my opinion. However, I don't like that different components of the meal came at different times. As in, a bunch of onions and zucchini in the beginning then a bunch of steak or chicken or scallops in my case at the end. Seemed weird to me that they just gave us a bunch of onion pieces...  Overall, 100% worth trying if you have never been. But it's pricey and it's not as cool as you imagined.",

They didn't wow me one way or another. The mango saketini was the best part of my meal. Other places I have been to include fried rice but it's extra here. It was the second best part of the meal. I got hibachi chicken it was plain and rubbery. Maybe I should have gone for the spicy. The sauces they give you...awful. They both were bitter. The waitress was on top of the drinks! The chefs always do tricks knives, banging, whistling, egg spinning, and catching a lemon in a fork. As luck would have it I got squirted right in eye with a flying drop of juice. This almost never happens. The chef was very concerned, it was an accident, they happen. Pass on the mandarin cheesecake.i was looking forward to it. Not great but I was so hungry because the food was sooo bland. I am not an adventurous eater I don't particularly like things that are overly spicy or flavorful so if I'm saying the food is bland you know it has virtually no taste. Also the location is very difficult to find it isn't clearly marked I walked right past it the first time and the Westgate really needs to have some better signage or directions. I also want to add our reservation was for 6pm, they didn't even start offering drinks until 6:30, it took nearly an hour for the chef to become available to cook our food. We were there for two and half hours!!",

It's 2 stories, and it's actually a VERY nice set up. Very Asian-esque, and..it was just really pretty. They have this \"firework\" show that they do as well.   Anyway, I went to meet up with my dad with my sister and her bf, and they had a little patio outside from where my dad was sat. It was set up like it was outside. With birds chirping and all. It also had a cigarette stand with about 20 buds. You would think that you could smoke out there then....right?  So, my dad smoked. The manager came stomping in and said, \"NO SMOKING!!\" -_- DAFCK. Lol. Why are you going to have that in there with used cigs and say no smoking! They didn't know it was there. -_-_-   Thursday night, since there's really nowhere else to eat, my dad took us out to eat here. The manager saw my dad and immediately say, \"Don't smoke in here again!\" Don't be rude about it brah. But, as the manager was seating us, he ended up being a super funny guy. He had jokes on him..I like dat.   We ended up getting the same cook my dad had the night before, and he was AWESOME. His name is James, so if you guys ever go there..I hope you get him! He's so funny. Our waitress was named Mokoto, and she was the sweetest gal ever. Always so happy!   The thing I liked most about this Benihana, is that everyone is mainly Japanese/Asian. It's way more authentic than the Torrance location, because everyone there..all the cooks are Hispanic. Not that there's anything wrong with that, but it just doesn't feel authentic. At this location, it did.   Since I've been here many times, I knew of the tricks he was going to do, but he changed it up on me! Made the whole grill light up with fiyahh!   Also, they randomly comped us a round of free drinks for no reason. Possibly because we were speaking Japanese to them? Who knows..   We also ate here on Friday night, because it was going to be a free dinner. I'm seriously Benihana-ed out for a while LOL. James happened to be at the table behind us, and we were bummed that he couldn't cook for our table again that night. We took a picture with him though! Hahah.",

The Carlsbad location is realllyyy nice though in case you're wondering.   To me, customer service is everything and they sure don't drop the ball here...   Our chef, Tuan, was THE BEST! He had allll of the skills and jokes that every other chef has had, and a bunch more. He seriously had me laughing the whole time and it made the overall experience absolutely amazing.   If you are celebrating your birthday, they will actually offer to take your picture... most other Benihana's offer regardless, but I guess this one is a little different. Make sure to call in and make a reservation beforehand to be safe and also sign up for the Chef's table to receive a $30 credit on your birthday month!",

When walking in you will feel like your in a different place not the casino anymore. It is decorated really nice. They even have a elevator for special events upstairs! Its a big place!! The food is always so good. If your staying in the hotel and there is a event in town it is a good Idea to make reservations ahead of time to be sure to get in.We have seen it get pretty busy, Have always enjoyed eating here. The food is really good and have never had any problems. Staff is friendly too. Check this place out it is really nice,  A little higher priced than other Japanese restaurants but its great for a special occasion!",

    "text": "We decided to give Benihana's another chance as a post birthday celebration for my girlfriend with our best friends. Our server was a nice gal but she spilled our sake and broke a glass on the grill before our food was served. Once again I have to give thanks to the Chef for the great entertainment and amazing food. The gentleman cooked our steaks to perfection and was very accommodating to one of our guests food allergy. We were again rushed to close our check which was very annoying and disrespectful as a consumer. Again the whole process of waiting and getting our food took forever, estimated about 2 hours. What's disappointing is that not only did this happen in our hometown San Diego but again in Las Vegas. The company really needs to adjust their opening hours, if they can't provide excellent and outstanding service for a 930pm reservation then don't provide that time for the customers. I hope this review and the previous review I've written is taken into consideration for future guest.",

Signup for their Chef's Table free program at <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FBenihana.com&s=a5f728e7276e6ab1d9fa79009da3035689a8fc7faf4fa24c269a552bf1d049e0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Benihana.com</a> and they'll email you a $30 certificate every bday. I highly recommend setting up a reservation ahead of time waiting could be a few hours.   Definitely love the decorations. There was a water feature but don't remember if it was a waterfall.  Also don't remember if there were koi fish but it really felt like there should be.  The dining experience was pretty cool, fun and entertaining. Went with the Teriyaki Steak Teppanyaki.  It comes with everything you need.  Started with a bowl of Benihana onion soup, it wasn't that bad but I was very hungry and savoring every bite of it. Next came the Benihana salad, it had a good taste but became watery towards the end of eating.    Once the chef came out I was happy because now the real food came out. He started with laying some zucchini and onions on the cooking area. When he starting building the onion volcano, it had my full attention.  When it was lit a small flame and smoke started, I thought \"boo. that was it\" but all of a sudden eruption \"kilauea!!!\" the table was engulfed with smoke.  Next he started making some shrimp apps showing off his lightning fast knife skills.  I almost cleared my plate as fast as he made them.  His flipping skill might need a little work.  He dropped the lime twice and missed his hat while tossing the shrimp ends away but still cool.   He then started making my Teriyaki Steak dish.  By that time I already forgot what I ordered.  There was steak and chicken cooking. Once he dropped the steak into my plate I started to eat.  Later he added mushrooms \"sweet it comes with mushrooms too\".  I then stopped and waited to see what else I was getting. Nothing else just the bowl of steam rice.   Overall a good experience and some good food.  I might have been short changed on some hot green tea that was also suppose to be served with my meal but its OK the free $30 covered it.",

    "text": "We had Benihana on a Wednesday night with some friends.  Even though it was in the middle of the week the main dining room was nearly full.  I had the benihana special, which is steak and lobster.  The wife had the surf side, which is shrimp, scallops, and calamari.  These meals come with the traditional teppanyaki accompaniments you've seen at other restaurants:  onion soup, salad, tea, dessert.  You got a couple of shrimp for an appetizer, which was a nice touch.  Also, Benihana serves ice cream, which was also welcome.  The meals come with steamed rice, fried rice is an upcharge.  Overall, I was sated, but certainly wasn't blown away.  The shrimp and lobster were probably cooked the best of all of the meats.  Of the surf side, I liked the scallops best.  They retained the buttery texture that makes scallops so great, but weren't overcooked.  My steak was average, maybe a little below average.  I've certainly had better at other teppanyaki joints in town.  The fried rice was decent, but I wouldn't call it \"classic\" as the menu does.  Service was hit and miss.  Our server forgot a drink order once and failed to fill my wife's soft drink for several minutes.  But, she was friendly and apologetic.  The cook was great, he really played the role well and gave us a twist on the classic onion volcano I hadn't seen before.  He was funny and engaging; I think we got a good chef.  Overall, Benihana delivers what it promises, it was a fun evening and we certainly enjoyed ourselves.  But, there are several places in town that you can get better food in a similar setting.",

My favorite is the filet and lobster.    I love the ginger dipping sauce...I usually end up with 3 or 4 of them...dump one over your steamed white rice, I promise, its orgasmic.   My only complaint is that the last few times I've been there, they haven't had the ginger ice cream anymore, and that was my favorite.  I recommend it, highly. :D",

When you first walk in, you walk in to an open area.  While you wait there's a sitting section. You can also get your picture taken.  If you're part of the birthday club, your picture is complimentary.   Of course, when you think of this place, you think of Hibachi grill.  I love it!  The chefs put on a little show while cooking.  Tell a few jokes as well.  Cooking up a storm, enjoy some of their drinks that come in a Buddha, geisha and other shapes.  Pretty neat.  Makes you want to keep going to see what figure is next. The chef takes your order and gets to cooking.  If you've never experienced this, I won't give anything away, but your eyebrows will be fine with all the heat.  Once the chef is done cooking, he disperses the food, for you to enjoy.  After all the \"oohs\" and \"ahhs\" from the mini show, there is silence.  Everyone is enjoying their food.  When your food placed on your plate, you can easily think it's not enough.  But your eyes may be bigger than your stomach.  At the end, the question comes up, \"Would you like dessert?\" My response, \"I have to where to fit it.\" haha!  Definitely an evening of good eats!",

Upon arrival we had to make reservations, so once we got there for our reservation we had to wait an additional 30 minutes to be seated which is absurd because of the simple fact that we made a reservation prior. So finally we are seated with a party of 2 and we started to look at the menu. The waitress had no type of etiquette and didn't bother to ask if we wanted water or even bring us water. She was very impatient and not knowledgeable about dining in. One of my girlfriends from our dinner party had a $30 coupon to use if an adult entree was purchased but apparently we read that wrong since the waitress and the manager came to the table saying we needed to order two adult entrees when the coupon said in fine bold print that only one entree is needed to use the coupon. The entire experience from the restaurant was ridiculous and wish I would've had a better experience.",

We arrived with a party of six being such a large space I wasn't too concerned about seating. We get to our table and are joined with a couple who are enjoying a nice dinner. I will admit I'm not the biggest fan of sitting at a table with others who aren't in the party. In this case the couple was on a date so it was awkward to say the least.   Anyway the service was okay being with friends in Vegas we are bound to be a little loud. Our waitress was sure to let us know to keep it down. I didn't find that appropriate. It definitely had an impact on my overall experience.   The food was okay we ordered a little bit of everything. The drinks were good. They weren't watered down which in my case is always a good thing.   Overall it was an okay experience.",

I hadn't had tepanyaki/hibachi in forever so when my birthday rolled around & I received a $30 birthday credit I knew where our next date night was going to be at haha I didn't think I had to make a reservation on a Monday night but I made one anyways and I'm glad I did because shortly after we were seated the place got packed! I really loved the ambience of the first floor, very zen... the second floor is where I think most of the hibachi takes place & it is hottttttttt!  If you're going to do tepanyaki be aware that you are going to be sitting next to strangers and basically be sharing a meal with them, it's part of the experience so be friendly and have fun :) We were fortunate enough to sit with a fun group of fellow birthday folks so shout-out to them! LOL  All of the servers here seemed to be older Japanese ladies so there is a little bit of a language barrier at times but be patient with them.. plus if you're nice she may show you a magic trick at the end of the meal! There is also a photographer who goes around taking professional pictures of guests~   The meals start out with the included onion soup & house salad which are both average at best, nothing special. Then the chef comes out and the real fun begins! Going into dinner I already knew that we would be paying more for the show than the actual food so I wasn't expecting much but I thought the food was still tasty! *Hibachi Vegetables include zucchinis, onions & mushrooms~ *Shrimp Appetizer- if you're allergic then you are assed out.. They will grill the shrimp & shellfish last but you don't get any substitute.. However, your dinner date will get an extra serving of your shrimp :) *Teriyaki steak ($29.95) - meat was actually very tender; if you don't like sweet things obviously don't get this.. *Hibachi Lemon Chicken ($25.95) - chicken breast with lemon lol I love lemon so I asked for extra lemon! yum! *Hibachi Chicken Fried Rice ($5.95/pp) - I thought it was just ok.. very buttery! not worth $6! LOL and your meal comes with steamed rice so just save your money and stick with that! *Dessert- Complimentary hot green tea to end the meal and we also got a complimentary ice cream treat for my birthday yay  *Alcohol - we spent almost $40 on 2 Kirins and 2 small hot sakes :X ($9 each) & they don't have large hot sakes :( Next time I think we will just share a Scorpion Bowl \"the 60oz crowd pleaser\" for $25      Our chef, Tuan, was really entertaining and we found him to be very funny but I could see how some people might not find his jokes funny.. But they should get the sticks out of their butts then ;ppp Don't forget to tip your chef when he is done~  When the bill came we had $30 taken off but an 18% auto grat in its place (I guess I didn't read the fine print? lol) so the total came up to $100 + the $10 we gave to Tuan... $110, so it wasn't a super cheap dinner.. Will I be back??? ehhhhhh I think it's more of a once every 3 years kind of thing but definitely something to experience if you haven't already!    HOT TIP: Join the Chef's Table to get $30 off on your birthday  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fprofile.benihana.com%2Fregistration%2F&s=abac7ee9fa54cf5dd756ff31cc1118d4c5741373b84c947e6a575ccd236b7591\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">profile.benihana.com/reg...</a>",

I love the scenic walk to the table with waterfalls, red bridges and flowers brought a serenity to my mind. The scents however, brought an aching in my stomach for seafood, fried rice and green tea ice cream. However, since I'm gluten-free, I knew that I would be limited to what food I could eat, just like every time I have been to Benihana in the past. This time, the magical waitress put a smile on my face that did not leave throughout the entire meal.  Benihana has finally gone gluten-free! Not only have they gone GF, but they have also trained their chefs how to avoid cross-contamination! JOY TO THE WORLD! For the first time in YEARS I finally had zucchini and onions with GF Tamari soy sauce, chicken fried rice with a steak and shrimp dinner. I had a salad without dressing (both of them have soy sauce) and no soup, but hey, I was OVERJOYED to FINALLY eat a traditional Benihana meal!  Not only was the food exactly how I remembered from before I was gluten-free, but the show the chef put on was great and the service was PERFECT. Our server was friendly, understood my allergy, was cautious, educative and such a good advocate for me.   The food was exactly the same as it is in other states. Even though it is nothing out of this world that will change your life forever, it is a good meal with a fun show, some laughter and plenty of hot sake keeping piping hot on the table griddle in front of you. All around it is always a good time.  P.S. If you are a local, get a player's card for the Hilton, show your NV ID and you will get 25% off your bill every time. Also, sign up for their emails and you will get a complimentary meal (up to $30, not including alcohol)the month of your birthday!",

The chef did a lot of tricks and kept us laughing. I'm giving it 3 stars because lack of taste on the meat, the waiter was ok a little slow. We waited about 30 minutes which wasn't that bad because we could gamble some more. I'd def come here again but my husband wouldn't!",

    "text": "I'm not a fan. Sorry to start off with that type of statement, but its more show then the quality of food.   Let me explain how I ended up giving them a 3 star rating. I gave them 2 stars for the level of customer service and the showmanship of the cook. The staff was extremely attentive and made sure that they made our group as happy as possible. The chief was fun and entertaining while cooking. Seemed like he was using old material for his jokes or maybe I've been to Benihana when I was a kid and I recall the same set of jokes.....kinda lame.   I gave them 1 more star for the fresh vegetables. I expected my surf and turf to be more enjoyable but at best it was average. So over all they get 3 stars.  Hope you enjoy it more then me.",

Had the steak and shrimp.  All was cooked fine, flavor was ok, but not as good as some I have had.   I like the places that also serve noodles with the main course, and this place did not.  I have nothing bad to report here, nothing outstanding.  It is a solid hibachi restaurant so if that is what you are in the mood for, it will work for you.",

    "text": "The restaurant is located in what is now the Westgate Hotel(formerly Las Vegas Hilton).  There have been some changes to Benihana's since the last time I was here.  Nothing appeared new, it just looked further tucked in the back.  Anyhow, it took nearly 30 minutes to self-park with my date on Valentine's day.  We then got to walk completely across the property to get to the restaurant.  Talk about setting the mood.  Our waitress comes to the table speaking a broken English and was very hard to understand.  The waitress had about zero personality and explained how everything you wanted to substitute on your meal was going to cost extra.(brown rice $3, fried rice $6, extra plate $10).  We were with a group of 8 others so she proceeded to tell each and every one of us the same exact thing(everyone but me wanted the fried rice).  I went for the brown rice so that's more as well.  Not quite sure why.   It seemed like we were waiting about 30 minutes at the table before the chef came over.   He was pleasant enough especially after being conditioned to the shortness from our waitress.  We asked for no onions which didn't seem to translate to the vegetable portion of our meals but they were big enough to pick out.  The food tasted good however they should trim the fat from the premium cuts a little better.  They use a lot of butter in their food preparation as well, so plan on a bit of a stomach ache if you aren't used to that much fat.  The bill was $120 for the two of us with each of us having one alcoholic drink.  For our convenience, the smug waitress added 20% tip to our bill as we were part of a 10 person party.  This policy is the obvious reason for our poor service by our waitress who was guaranteed 20% regardless of her performance.  It's a shame that Benihana corporation lets this sort of thing go on.  I won't be back.",

Was sort of weird as they cook the prawns.. throw em around.. cook up an onion.. set it on fire... then way later knock out my steak.. I ate.. onions.. shrimp.. them steak.. was like two meals.. kinda strange. I would rather they kept it in the kitchen under a heat light then served it all at once. Oh well..   So the service as in drinks was low.. not Silverton (the bench mark of crappy service read my review if u don't know that place) but not very good. I would have enjoyed getting a few drinks but instead.. i got .. 1.. lol.. oh well..   Food was pretty tasteless and super boring but there was flames.. so its worth something if your a pyromaniac like me!",

    "text": "This place is absolutely lovely. The decor is gorgeous and you really feel like you're stepping into another land when you go here, it is quite an experience.   Came here on a Saturday night past our reservation, with 3 people in our party. They told us it would be about a half hour wait, but in less than 15 minutes we were on our way upstairs to be seated with 5 other patrons.   It took a little while for us to get drink and food orders in, but about 10 minutes or so after we put in our food orders, side dishes started arriving while our chef was preparing to make our food.   I ordered the Garden Vegetable plate for $24.95 (I realize now that they forgot to give me asparagus, grr). If you're ordering a vegan item on the menu, the first thing you bring me should NOT be chicken-based soup. That was a major turn-off and I'm amazed that came with the meal, and they should have asked if I wanted it before doling it out.   The second part was a ginger salad that was really good, I loved the dressing. After this, our chef came and started making our meal. He was really funny, and did a lot of little tricks that made the dining experience almost like seeing a show too. Sometimes my veggies got a little too close to the meat on the grill for comfort, but they never mixed, although it would be nice if they could have 1/3 of the grill sectioned off for veggies. He made me zucchini, onion, and mushrooms on the grill, and he also had a LOT of veggies steaming in a separate area as well. My plate was HUGE and I didn't even finish everything, I was totally full! And the onion volcano that the chefs make is definitely must-see. It was a total blast.  I alerted the waiter that it was my friend's birthday, and they brought out a complimentary tangerine (?) topped cheesecake slice and sang to her. This cheesecake was AMAZING. It had angel food cake as the crust, and the back part was made up of nuts and some kind of frosting/fondant. The presentation was lovely and it totally made her day.  My only qualms were the pricing ($25 is a bit pricey for veggies, but I think overall it was worth it - my TWO friends got a chef's special together with steak for $34 which is ridiculous in comparison, since they got just as much food) and the fact that the grill should be sectioned off for vegetables and meat. Otherwise it was quite the enjoyable experience and I can see why this place is packed on a nightly basis. Very entertaining and I am sure I will be back again.  One last tip: Go to the Chef's Table section of the official Benihana website, and sign up. You will receive a $30 gift certificate for your birthday :) My friend used hers that night! Oh and don't lie, they ask for I.D. lol.",

Unfortunately our server, Maria, didn't know how to replenish drinks and took forever to bring the checks at the end of the night - it drops my review all the way down to only three stars.    The food was excellent but I feel it was somewhat overpriced (especially with the lackluster service).  Maria told the table that it was her first night back from a months long vacation and that she wished she didn't have to come back.  Nice!  That's what I want to hear when we are spending a couple of hundred dollars on dinner.    Shrimp, scallops and steaks were delicious  - but felt I was being fleeced enough without being charged an extra $5.50 a piece for fried rice.   I also loved the green tea icecream!  Benihana probably does 95% tourist business so they don't care about the 5% of us that would probably visit again and again - if we felt more welcome.",

I've been to Benihana a few dozen times throughout my life and it's consistently a great experience. - My favorite thing about Benihana is probably the fact that you get to taste so many different things! Soup, salad, rice/fried rice, grilled onions, grilled zucchini, grilled shrimp, and finally, your entree. - I also love watching them prepare the food. Sitting there drooling over the food for a while as it's being prepared makes it taste that much better when it's finally ready. Not to mention that it's entertaining! Every time I've eaten there the chefs are fun, personable, and impressive. - The food is always fantastic. Most dishes are pretty standard, nothing too creative, but they're well executed. - They give you $30 off for your birthday! How could anyone not take advantage of that?",

We waited even longer because they forgot the rice. Finally the manager came out and brought the rice four of the five missing rice bowls. At this point we were just over it and ready to leave a one star review but then the manager came over and sincerely apologize. Abby the manager was great she made everything better. We could tell she cared about her staff and the she understood customer service. It's amazing how just minutes ago we were ready to leave and never return but then one person comes and change your whole opinion. She quickly got her staff on point and we are leaving happy. she gave me green tea ice cream and sang the happy birthday song to my friend..so to the owners of Benihana you did a great job promoting her to manager to lead this team.",

I've been to numerous hibachi grills in my life and this was a first. How is fried rice not the standard?! 4) Rice was bland (even the fried rice), Meat was bland and vegetables were so so. 5) Even more overpriced than expected and portions were small.

It was as if seasoning is a foreign concept. They were actually so bland that they were barely palatable. I ended up not eating most of it. Sooooooo disappointing at $40  My fiance had the seared ahi tuna which okay. Also no seasoning. Again, disappointing for the $40 price tag.  Now, on to the rest as this was a 6 course meal:   Soup was DISGUSTING! I took one bite and pushed it away. It was like watered down beef broth with some green onion in it. Yuck!  Salad was a bowl of iceberg lettuce and some odd tasting ginger dressing. Really??  Plain white rice.  Veggies were good, but how do you mess up sauteed zucchini?   Dessert was a scoop of ice cream.   Decor and surroundings were lovely. The koi pond throughout a portion of the restaurant was very nice.  All in all this was a HUGE WASTE OF MONEY! We felt as though the soup, salad, dressing, veggies, rice and ice cream came from the .99cent store.   The meats are clearly good quality but we both wished we had opted for teriyaki style so we could have had flavor. We expected MUCH MORE in the flavor department. Who eats meats without seasoning? They did provide a mustard sauce but ewwww. That is not an appetizing thought: mustard on your steak and chicken.  No thanks.  We are truly VERY DISAPPOINTED. It was a birthday dinner which made it sting more",

The lady that took our orders fucked it up somehow things u ordered they tell u that u didn't order it mind u with over with u the extra charges I think I want it doesn't matter the extra price means I want what the fuck I ordered. Not many tricks as usual I'm pissed I choose this one for my kids first experience. We had the oldest person ever making our food who we had to tell over and over what to add to our food as he made it bout time it was time to eat after waiting forever we didn't wanna eat it we took it to go only the kids ate while we was there. Had to call the manager up who never said sorry or even explained what the hold up was never again will I ever come back to this one. I just knew we was going to have a good time it's so beautiful inside but the serious is fucking horrible for me to spend my hard earned funds there for me and my two small kids $100 to not be happy is fucking horrible",

There were other seats available but they were not offered. We waited for 30 mins for other parties to join our table and no one ever did. The waitress brought by 3 different people and none of them would sit. We, however we're never offered another table. When they finally did take our order, it wasn't exactly right. The only reason we stayed was because we promised our boys they could see the onion volcano. Steak wasn't cooked to our request, chicken was extremely dry. I could go on but it's not worth the characters. Our tab was close the $200, we could have gone to the grocery store and made our own meal.",

    "text": "Benihana's is a great place to go if you're a first timer for Teppanyaki/Hibachi style cooking as the decor is beautiful and the cooking style is very entertaining. But as an avid fan of Japanese food (and being Japanese myself) Benihana's just isn't very good.   We booked a reservation for 4 at 9:30pm Saturday night and waited near the koi pond for about 15 minutes to be seated. Due to the amount of Hibachi grills shoved into a single room it was impossible for the 4 of us to talk to each other because it was so loud. Once we ordered I was shocked fried rice was extra but ordered it anyways as white rice with Teppanyaki is boring.   Order and review of food appearance:   1. Soup - I really enjoy the onion soup so to start the meal with it was great! 2. Salad - This was ultimately iceburg lettuce with a bland ginger salad with an awkward texture -Chef began cooking- 3. Shrimp, veggies, fried rice, steak, mushrooms - they were all flavored with their \"garlic butter\" and it was BLAND. Although the meal was served with dipping sauces, it shouldn't rely on the sauces to make the meal, just enhance it. I was highly disappointed in the lack of flavors for the price of this joint.   If you're looking for good Teppanyaki/Hibachi, make your way to Gesha as they know what they're doing.",

    "text": "For as long as I can remember Benihanas has been the standard for the American teppanyaki experience. Sadly I think that the experience has been lost in translation and their sharp knife that was used to slice would-be competition is slowly dulling (pun intended). The teppan cooks we had tonight was \"ok\" . He did the standard flair tricks and jokes however quickly became flustered with the cooking and food management and that's where the entertainment portion ended. We were lucky, the group across from us were seated after us and their chef came and went before ours was done. We could hear them arguing with the manger about the quality of service, taste and a missed order. I don't know about the validity of their argument so I'll leave it at that. In my personal option, I think the level of expertise/standard of the teppan chef/entertainers have gone down.   Another area for concern on this outing was our kimono dressed waitress, she was not friendly nor very customer service oriented. She forgot 2 of the tables drinks on the initial order and had to be flagged down constantly for refills. Each engagement with her felt like we were inconveniencing her versus being felt like a welcome guest.  The last complaint about the staff was we were not thanked once after paying our bill or walking out of the dining area! Not the Japanese way!    Other observations: When the couple next to us asked for a take out box they were given Chinese take out boxes?!? I find this odd and at the same time insulting. This is supposed to be a Japanese dining experience not a Chinese one. I'm not racist (I am actually both Chinese and Japanese) but do not confuse the cultures! How do Chinese take out boxes play into an authentic Japanese dining experience? It doesn't! It may seem trivial but It tells you how they view leftovers and the food. You are paying $30-60 for a meal and by giving you a cheap Chinese take out box and LVH gift shop bag makes the restaurant look cheap and takes away from the experience.. Its the little things people...  Ending on a good note: Compliments on the completed renovation the place looks really good and makes you feel like you were transported to the motherland.",

Why'd I wait so long to try them (slap me please)?  I went in March (25th actually... and reviewing this has been on a long 'to do' list).  This location is inside the Westgate Hotel & Casino, with a great Japanese decor I'm assuming all locations provide yet it seemed especially grande.  I almost felt like I was in the tourist part of the country as I crossed over the bridge.  Almost!.   FOOD  I ordered the filet mignon (cooked medium with extra garlic butter and seasoning...try it and thank me later!), and lobster tail ( might I suggest you request it sauteed in fresh squeezed lemon juice, chili garlic sauce, and garlic butter... it is sinfully delicious.)  The meal was huge as Hibachis tend to be.  It came with perfectly grilled veggies, and as a mushroom lover I was in mushroom heaven.  The shrimp appetizer was cooked perfectly and your chef may even give you left over extras after serving your table. I loved the sauces for dipping, particularly the brown colored sauce- very strong flavor...if you go for strong flavors.  I enjoyed all of the additions that come with it like salad ( I stuck to ranch dressing),  fried rice, hot tea, and the most delicious sorbet I've ever had, I wonder if they make it? Hmmm.  I stayed at Westgate Hotel for the week and  that weekend too so I had several trips there just to order a to-go sorbet, I'm sure they thought this a bit weird, but I can not deny the desire of my taste buds! Happy eating!  P.S I don't remember what I drank but it wasn't sake, I wasn't sure which one to pick so...I have to get my sake expertise badge another time.",

    "text": "My family and I wanted to have a nice dinner to celebrate my sister's graduation. We decided on Benihana for their fame of having an amazing teppanyaki experience. When we initially arrived to the restaurant it looked completely empty but don't let that fool you. Once we got inside we were directed to the elevator that took us to the second floor where they have several tables with many chiefs cooking all at the same time. One of my main complaints would have to be how hot it was. There are many chiefs cooking at the same time and the entire second floor was significantly warmer than the first floor of the restaurant. With the scorching heat of Vegas the last thing I need is to be uncomfortably hot while I eat. Also, this was not my first time having a teppanyaki style dinner and I was surprised with the lack of privacy. All the tables are relatively close and it was hard to focus one our chef while he was cooking in front of us while there was 2 chefs in front and to the side of our table being just as loud.   Prior to your main course they serve you a salad and a mushroom soup. The salad had a really good tangy dressing but the soup tasted like salted water with a couple slices of mushrooms. As my main course I ordered chicken with fried rice. The chicken was really juicy and the fried rice was impressive as well. At the end of the meal they also give you hot tea. I only had a sip of the tea because I was so hot on the second floor. I didn't miss out on much because the tea was very diluted and the water tasted like it came from a faucet.   When our dinner was over and we were handed to bill our server made sure that we understood that our bill did not already include the tip. I don't know about you but it bothers me when people make me feel obligated to tip. I usually tip well when warranted so I hate it when people make me feel obligated to tip when I am already going to tip you pretty well.   Overall, I would probably never go back unless I had to.",

To me, this place is like the Olive Garden of Japanese restaurants. They have recently updated their menu and raised the prices as well as changed some of the pairings. I was disappointed to see that they no longer have the salmon on the children's menu, my youngest loved the salmon there. My problems this night were more with the service though. I had ordered a sashimi appetizer and it never came. I even reminded our obviously busy waiter and still no sashimi. Most of our party ordered the filet and lobster combo and were very happy with their meal. I ordered a seafood combo and my scallops were cooked to the brink of disintegration. My shrimp were hard and rubbery and my fried rice was so greasy I couldn't eat it.   Our chef was pleasant enough, in his broken English. The decor is very calming and peaceful, with water and fountains throughout. My kids always enjoy the \"cooking show.\"",

Everyone from cashiers to the cooks who entertained with much laughter and joy acted professional. The food that was prepared in front of us was delicious.  Two things  i didn't like was the seating arrangements.  Since we had a group of over 20 people there wasn't any room to move due to a tight space.  2nd is food prepared is a bit pricey over there but if you don't mind spending and be entertained and eat Japanese food, this is the place to be.  Overall I give this place 4 stars out of 5",

Our chef was slightly on the boring side, not bad but not good.  Pros: Food was good, it's always fun to watch your food made in front of you. Quality was higher than other teppanyaki places.  Cons: Very pricey and not really worth it except for a celebration or your first time. Our chef was a little boring.  I may eat here again if looking to celebrate or for someone's first time, but won't seek it out.",

I asked the server in the bar area if the area was bar seating and was rudely told by a server, woman approximately late 50s, \"this is dining room only.\" I had been to this Benihanas in the past but it had been at least a year.  Wasn't sure if they changed their policy.  We proceeded to leave.  I turned around because I wanted this rude lady to know there was only 1 other party in there and we had just wanted appetizers and drinks while waiting for dinner. She then changed her tune.  The rest of our experience and food was very good.  When discussing what happened with my husband, who witnessed the exchange, he felt her harshness may have been a cultural thing.  My feeling is that it has nothing to do with culture.  If you can't control your harsh tongue, get out of the hospitality business!  We will go back the next time we're in Vegas but won't take any guff off this lady.  Their food is a 4 but the experience with the server in the bar area dropped it to a 3.  Found out the bar area servers name is Meilong",

Then the food was dry and flavorless!! On top if it, the couple across from us was missing their order! Yeah, the chef cooked everyone's food, plated it, and then realized he missed one person!!! Ridiculous! Then the darn manager had the nerve to insult our table of 8 with excuses!!! There were 3 different parties seated at our table from 3 different states and we all agreed that we were treated like crap!! They comped us our drinks for the horrible service... Big deal. Then gave us excuses and made it seem like WE were all wrong for complaining! To add insult to injury, their plates are 10 bucks more than the one at home!!! Pitiful experience!!!!",

The food is ok,  nothing special a bit bland, the drinks had virtually no alcohol in them I had three Mai Tai's and not even the slightest little buzz my girlfriend had their house drink and again no alcohol.      The main reason people come to this place is to be entertained while they eat well the last couple chefs seemed like they couldn't stand being there they had bad attitudes and did nothing special at all their favorite thing to do is pour salt on everything and say high sodium low sodium, there was no flipping of food or tossing of utensils that you would expect from a place like this. They all had little train whistles our guy was so lazy he didn't even pull his out he just tapped his spatula on the grill and said Choo Choo. Hope you don't sit next to a loud drunk tourist spewing profanity and making a scene because the staff will do nothing about it.     The only reason this review is not a 1 is because it really is a nice place and was the best in vegas at what they do and if you're not stuck next to screaming throwing up people it's not so bad, the atmosphere is really cool and if they stepped the chefs game up a bit it could be a really great restaurant again.",

That's right, my odd request at a Japanese restaurant while having bland tuna steak was met with sarcasm and disbelief that made not only my date and I cringe and do a double take, but the rest of the table also noticed and talked about the attitude. It also took her about 3/4of the meal to bring the hot sauce i requested with my appetizer. It felt odd giving her any tip at all with her bad attitude and piss poor service  Oh and the tuna was near flavorless, drown in what tasted like straight up vinegar and covered with soggy onion crisps and a few edamame beans. Gross.   My date had tofu steak which was worse. It was undercooked, soggy, and flavorless as well. With as much butter they use you would think some flavor would even accidentally happen. No such luck. She requested noodles instead of rice which cost an additional $7 (ridiculous upcharge for butter noodles) and still that meal was borderline inedible. Leftovers were okay because I know how to cook tofu and add spices to food to enhance flavor.   If I could give 0 stars to this pathetic overpriced bland food a thon, I would.",

They started us with their famous Benihana onion soup, followed by salad with a ginger dressing and shrimp appetizer.  The chef created sauces for our shrimp and steak as well.  Grilled zucchini and onions followed the shrimp.  Then our chef cooked our filets and lobster perfectly for us.  Dinner was followed by ice cream and sherbet.  Very tasty meal.",

On this visit I started with a tempura sushi roll then ordered the half chicken and half streak teriyaki...AMAZING. I was disappointed with our chef, who didn't do many of the tricks but we were having a great time and i've seen them before. We all were drinking Sapporo beer and our waitress was excellent.

The waterfall, the two-story atmosphere, the feeling of being in a little Japanese village.  Superb.  I went here for my mom's birthday dinner last weekend.  My fiance and I were meeting up with them so I went to the podium and told them what the reservation should be under and the time.  It took 3 of them to search for several minutes before asking what the last name was.  I gave it, thinking it was odd to ask for that, and they said they didn't have a reservation but I could look around.  Uh, OK...  Mind you, my mother made a reservation several days ago.  Whatever.  They ended up being in the bar and then we checked in and waited to get sat, which was another several-minute process with several people.  Didn't know this was so intense.  Our chef, Tommy, was good.  Nice personality, chatty, funny.  The service was terrible, the food made my fiance and I sick for DAYS after (but at the time it was BARELY above-average tasting) and I probably would NOT go back for the outrageous prices alone.  Find another hibachi-type place, I'm sure they're out there.",

    "text": "Last night went to Benihana's for dinner at the Westgate Casino, the front desk hostesses are not too friendly but efficient. Our reservations were for 7pm but had to wait to have enough people to fill the table.  We were finally seated at 7:30pm.  The hostess was friendly, quick and very attentive.  She took our drink orders immediately and throughout our dinner, we never had to ask to have a refill, she just seemed to be there as soon as we needed another drink. The meal, as usual was delicious, but the highlight of the evening was our Japanese Chef, \"Antonio\". He was friendly, witty, funny, and very charming.  He did all the usual tricks, the volcano, the egg roll but the best was when he threw an egg in the air and it landed on his knife, split with no mess!!  The food was tasty, cooked well and plentiful.  The evening would have been a 5 star had it not been for the picture takers, there were 2, one very brassy and loud older woman, who is the Saleswoman, and the young brunette who actually takes the pictures.  We had barely been seated, when in they come, and they really hate to take no for answer!  When we explained we were locals and came often to the restaurant, the brassy one said to the young one,Well, we won't make money off of them.  The other 2 couples also felt that the older woman just didn't quit.  So ok, one couple decided to take their pictures, and right when the Chef is bringing in his cart,  brassy woman comes in again, giving her pitch for one picture $25, 2 pictures $40.  Of course, we all had to wait while the couple looked over the pictures in order to select the one they liked.  How about the picture taker stay outside the restaurant, since the pictures did not show the restaurant background anyway.  All in all, once that was over with, the evening progressed well, our table had fun and the meal was excellent.",

This one was located in the Westgate hotel and casino and was spectacular  It was truly an amazing experience.  I would definitely go visit Benihana again but not this specific location.   Upon arriving we politely asked to be seated for two and were informed that it would be a 25 minute wait which we were perfectly okay with, after all we did not have reservations,  but one of the ladies said we could wait at the bar just outside, which was nice of her until she said \"but only if you're old enough to drink\" which somewhat bothered me since I am in Vegas alone with my girlfriend inside a casino resort. That isn't the main reason I am giving them 3 stars though.  As we walked in I wad made to feel as if I were underdressed when the waitress mentioned something about what I was wearing(which was attire for 90 degree weather because Vegas is in the desert after all.   This restaurant is amazing but fairly overpriced.  The price is understandable though since it is just east of the strip and in a hotel. The one thing that it lacks is great service from the waitresses. I did forget to mention our cook which was amazing.  He went out of his way to attempt to tend to everyone's needs and was great at it.  He made jokes and made us all laugh. He is was the light of our night after the not so nice waitress. The photographer lady came to our table and completely ignored us and only spoke to a group of for that was sitting at the same table.  Now I'm not saying this was a terrible thing because we weren't willing to buy a very overpriced photo but I always thought it was common courtesy to greet everyone at a table.    If you can manage to go there and get a nice waitress you'll probably have a blast.  I loved the ambience and cook. If you go try not to dress too casual as I and a few other people were.   Overall:  Waitress & photographer customer service:  2/5 Cook customer service (Leo was his name): 5/5 Food:  4/5 Decor: 5/5 Price: 3/5",

I left my credit card by mistake and they turn it in to the lost and found department. I will recommend this restaurant to everyone!!! It's a great place to go celebrate a special occasion yes you will spend a lot of money but definitely worth it to go once a while",

Between the 115-degree temps in Las Vegas and sitting in front of the hibachi, it was a very hot experience.  The cook set an onion on fire once which was pretty cool.  I ordered the mango shrimp which turned out to be surprisingly bland.  The waitress at the end entertained us with a magic trick she knew and ended up pulling a scarf out of my sleeve -she was quite endearing.  Overall it wasn't a bad experience, but given the price, one experience here was enough for me.  Probably wouldn't go back to any Benihana (not just here at LVH).",

The rest is normal Benihana! Great food with great service!",

First of all the times are completely wrong they really close an hour and a half before what is listed as their closing times. I went there one night for a somewhat late dinner and they said that they were closing, which I have no problem with but what's the point of listing closing times if those are the incorrect closing times. And the staff who said that to me were completely rude and condescending. So I went there another night just to give it a second chance and once again the staff were rude again. The food was bland and nothing special and not to mention the smell of smoke everywhere made the whole dining experience that much more unpleasant. So many other food options to choose from in Vegas that are exponentially better than what is offered here.",

The ambiance was pleasant, and I certainly must highlight the amazing service and entertainment fron Yan. He was so funny while preparing our delectable cuisine.

For the price on the strip you can definitely do better food wise, but if you find yourself at Westgate and need some Asian food in your life, you might just meander into the good old Benihana.  If you're with a larger group it makes sense and the location definitely is spacious and leaves no stone unturned, but otherwise you know what to expect here. Check it out if you must, but really I would most likely avoid.",

It's almost like you're invited into a little Japanese kitchen. The downside to this place would be the overall food.  For the high price point I was expecting more spectacular food but it was just so so. The portion sizes were very large which was nice but I felt the meat and vegetables could have used a bit more seasoning.   The service was also somewhat sub par. We had to track down our server a few different times to request a drink menu and dessert menu and the hibachi chefs seemed to be very rushed and pulled from table to table. The pushy photographer also give it that typical cheesy tourist touch.   Overall I most likely will not be back but am glad I finally tried it.",

Customers should have a choice without charge for plain or fried rice. Paying extra  for fried rice is ridiculous, this should be part of the meal. Please add peas&carrots to your fried rice. By adding chicken is a waste & more expensive to add to the rice. The fried rice was horrible!! 3. Zucchini & onions for vegetables, are you serious!!! Zucchini, onions, broccoli, and carrots is a vegetable side. Take the ice cream off the meal plan and buy some vegetables.  4. You guys really need yum-yum sauce/shrimp sauce! 5. What happen to offering Sake!!! 6. Please visit your east coat location and take pointers! I felt like this was like high price Chinese take-out! My experience at Benihana on the East coast (Pittsburgh) was much more pleasant. If you make the changes I recommended the line would be out the door!",

The atmosphere is one of the coolest I've seen in Vegas.   I definitely recommend the chateaubriand!!!! It was amazing!! I didn't try any seafood aside from the shrimp appetizer. That being said, be careful as they do cook seafood on the same surface as your food. I'm not sure if/how they accommodate allergies.",

It's very normal to have yummy leftovers at most Japanese restaurants so you feel like you are getting 2 meals. Not here! Very small portions. The food was good... not great but you also feel cheated having to pay an extra $5 for fried rice which is normally the standard rice at other Japanese places... pay the extra charge or you get just plain steamed rice.  And let me say this... DO NOT BOTHER ORDERING A COCKTAIL! Rip off! Had the $12 exotic mojito... in my opinion, no alcohol, at all!  As far as service... we had to track down our server twice to order additional beverages.... which we switched to bottled beer since we knew we would get the actual alcohol. Atmosphere was fine... the typical decor. The Ft Lauderdale location is much nicer.",

When you enter into this restaurant, you'll leave the world behind you and enter into this amazing Japanese themed environment.  From the water falls, the wooden walk ways and bridges. Dragons in the skyline and red lanterns everywhere.  The waitstaff are dressed in modern kimonos and lead you and your guests to your table.  We asked for the teppanyaki table where the chefs cooks directly in front of you.  Note: you can request a reservation but they will not seat you until your whole party has arrived. Reason being is you may be seated with other people. Which is kewl because you can always use this opportunity to make new friends!  The chefs are trained well to cook amazing food with an entertaining showmanship performance that will keep you smiling. While enjoying your food!  I would definitely choose this place for groups or for couples!  It's the perfect venue and If you have never been here, I would definitely recommend you come here and try it out!  :)",

People, if you're a local or coming to visit Las Vegas and want to be fed and entertain please check out Benihana at Westgate formally The Las Vegas Hilton.",

    "text": "Where do I start? I walked up to the lady in the front to tell her that I had a reservation but my party (husband and son) were finding parking and were on their way. She rudely told me that we would wait for them and refused to sit me down. She asked if it was somebody's birthday and when I said it was mine she didn't even look up to acknowledge me.  I waited 12 minutes standing since there are no benches to sit down and the lady's just kept looking at me. By the time my party arrived the manager was up front and and she was actually the only good thing about this place. The first rude lady I dealt with automatically changed her attitude and was faking to be nice and greet me like if she actually cared about my business. They then took us to our table where we waited what seemed like 20 minutes for our cook to come out. I was expecting a great show as this place had great reviews but that did't happen. The cook didn't look like he wanted to be there and hardly talked or looked at any of us. The people sitting across from us also complained about there being no real show. We have been to MANY hibachi places since we like to go around finding the best spots and I can assure you that this is by far the worst one I have ever been to. The service was bad and the food was expensive ($144 for three people after birthday coupon). I wouldn't have mind paying that money as long as the service or food was good but they weren't. If you aren't a tourist I would recommend you stay away from this location and go look for other hibachi places away from the strip. Thank you Benihana for making my birthday one of the worst ones I've ever had.",

    "text": "Wonderful!  The is the LARGEST BENIHANA IN THE WORLD!   We made dinner reservations for 2 early same day. When we arrived at 6 p.m. and it was already hopping!  It was like a beautiful city inside. Dim lighting, the first part as you walk in is the sushi. So through this little city we went, past a small bridge over some water, with rain like water falling from above.   You want to impress the ladies, bring them here!  We ordered Shrimp Tempura for the appetizer and for dinner, the Chicken & Shrimp plate and Steak & Shrimp plate.  Before our chef came out, we were served a mushroom soup and salad. We also received our shrimp tempura plate.  For $12.95, you only get 3 pieces of shrimp and vegetables with it. :-/ Kind of a joke with only 3 pieces of shrimp. Not worth $12.95, that's for sure. It was plain and the sauce was bland. The veggies were good, but it just wasn't what we ordered. A little misleading.  When our chef came out, he introduced himself. His name was Sheyan. He joked as he cooked. It made everything a good & fun show. He was very fast with his cuts, made everything look beautiful. He did the amazing fire volcano, the children at the table loved that....I can be a kid at times, so I loved it too. I had ordered my steak cooked meduim rare and he did great with that. The cut of steak was tender. Delicious. I got to try my husband's chicken and it was nice & juicy. Mine was juicy too, but I think it's harder to cook chicken and he did a great job keeping it moist. Dinner also came with ice cream for dessert. We ordered chocolate, it was very sweet & delicious.   We had a blast, I would definitely come back!",

We started off with some sushi, which I did not order so I am not able to tell you what they are but they were good.  As for what I had, I ordered a drink called Cucumber Collins which consists of Hendrick's Gin  St-Germain Elderflower Liqueur  iichiko shochu  fresh cucumber slices.  It was light and delish.  It wasn't too overpowering with alcohol which I like my drinks that way.  As for my meal, I ordered the most poplular Teppanyaki-Rocky's Choice which includes Hibachi steak*, and chicken breast grilled to your specification.  While waiting for the chef to cook your main meal, it comes with soup and salad.  Along with grilled onions, squash and shrimp.  Include that with my main entree, Rocky's Choice I had plenty of leftovers!  The price point is a bit $$$ but if you are celebrating an occassion then I would definitely encourage a trip here.  The set-up of the restaurant is beautiful and large.  I got lost coming back from the restroom...lol!!!  But while finding my way back to our table, I notice the man-made waterfall and a small table of two which is perfect for a night should you wish to pop the question to your special lady!  =)  I encourage you to check it out!",

Although the downstairs areas have nice ambience, the upper level is a food factory, noisy and breezy. Service was friendly and efficient. Cook was OK, but his jokes seemed pretty old.

    "text": "I had been at a Benihanas in Pennsylvania many many years ago and remember it being fun and delicious. Well I was either young and dumb or just starving for food and entertainment. The only reason we decided to hit Benihana was that I had a birthday coupon for $30 off. Depending on what you get, its a free meal, so why not? We got there when it opened so we got a seat quickly. The room filled up fast though, apparently there was a Physicians Assistant convention in the building. The entrance is beautiful, very serene. Our waitress had a thick asian accent so it was difficult to understand her at times, but she was pleasant and efficient. Our chef was a little dry and boring, he seemed like he really didn't want to be there, it his first seating...he has a long night ahead of him! Drinks were large and fruity, just the way I like em. The soup and salad were standard faire, veggies and shrimp appetizers were good, my husband hates seafood and ate 2 of them! I got steak and chicken, my hubby got steak...the meat on both were a bit dry and bland, very under seasoned. At the end of our meal a man at the end of the table began to have chest pains, unsure if it was indigestion or a heart attack. The waitress was quick to call for help, they provided him with a wheelchair and got him out of the room with paramedics on the way. I was impressed they dealt with everything so well. He was lucky he had a nurse (me) and a P.A. at his table, we were standing by ready to lend a hand. After the commotion we were served our ice cream with a birthday candle, nice touch.  I probably won't go back, the food isn't good enough, Osaka has much better Teppan and you can get it at any time of day.",

    "text": "Sorry, but I have to ding this place 2 stars for lousy guest relations and service from the waiter on behalf of all at my table.  I arrived at the Benihana desk to inquire about dinner for 1. The lady behind the desk offered me the sushi bar (separate restaurant area) or the Asian restaurant. I knew that there was plenty of room at Benihana and replied that I came to eat at Benihana. I was given a pager and told it would be 15 minutes. Ok. Fine.  I was out front waiting for several minutes when the pager went off and I was seated at a table that already had 4 people at it. Ok. Fine. How long had they been there? Long enough to already have water.  Our waiter spoke broken English and was hard to understand. Worked through that and ordered a drink. Eventually ordered dinner.  We had a great chef who talked with us about his sharp knife, how long he had worked there and let it slip that management wasn't having the waiters tip the chefs as part of their payout anymore. If you know anything about tipping in a Japanese restaurant or sushi place, you know that it is customary to tip higher because the chef needs to be tipped. Not here. The wait staff keeps the tips, yet all they actually do is bring you drinks and the appetizers from the back. The chef does most of the work.  Easy to fix. Tip the chef in cash and reduce the tip to the wait staff accordingly. As I told the chef, two can play at this game. Now I am letting everyone know what they actually do. This is worse than pooling tips and dividing them up to everyone including lazy staff.  As I said, the chef was great and the food was excellent.  Now, about our waiter. Two people asked for more water. They got 7 up or some similar lemon lime soda instead. It had bubbles, the customer said it was sweet and it definitely wasn't water.  Yes I would go back, but it won't be because of the front desk or wait staff.",

Be prepared to wait for your food though. My entree was served first since it was salmon, and my dinner counterpart's dinner was served about 5-6 minutes later. It's not that big a deal but when you're hungry it feels like a lifetime.  I'd skip Benihana's in your in Vegas and just go to your local location. Vegas has so much more to offer than this chain.",

Nothing like a sense of desperation to really enhance a dining experience, eh? We had a group of 8 and this was really just fuel to keep us going (and boy, did we). Benihani is great for groups because of the fun, noisy atmosphere. Our chef was great, despite the fact I am sure he was slammed. The decor was tiki / polynesian and they served drinks with little umbrellas (which I am a total sucker for).  To sum the review up: chain restaurants are usually consistent - I would say the LV Hilton Benihana was better than average. Also, theme/novelty restaurants are usually not the pinnacle of fine dining. Lastly, tourist traps are usually expensive. Deal.",

    "text": "We had the best experience dining at this location inside the Westgate Casino. Every single person we encountered that night was very hospitable from the valet service to the employees standing in front of the lobby greeting and directing us the way to Benihana's. I was definitely very surprised at how big the restaurant was inside.   Our server was a sweet Japanese lady who promptly took care of our needs and even comped us a bottle of sake which kept the adults very happy. Our chef James didn't seem warm at first but it didn't take much time for him to start growing on us, crack some jokes and the interesting conversations about our family and kids. The portion size is always enough to make you leaving full and it was cooked perfectly. I really wanted to have filet mignon that night but since it was Good Friday, I opted for the Surf Side meal which consisted of calamari, shrimp and scallops. Our kids absolutely enjoyed the food and how it's specially served to each and every person. Overall, it was a great dinner and full evening of rides after at the Adventure Dome to entertain the teens.",

    "text": "2.75 stars. I recently found out that Benihana gives out $30 coupons for your birthday. So my friend and I, both with March b-days, decided to give it a go.  I've not had teppanyaki/hibachi grilled meals in a long time, so I was looking forward to it. Located in the LVH, Benihana is in this little Asian-themed restaurant area. Decor is lovely and fitting.  We had 7:30 reservations but were about 5 minutes late. We were seated just in time, as the rest of the people around the hibachi had just ordered. Unfortunately, the photographer had already made her rounds at the table and skipped us! Boo.  I got Rocky's Choice (steak & chicken) and my friend had the Imperial Steak. The meal came with soup, salad, shrimp and some veggies (onions, zucchini). When ordering your meal, the waitress will ask if you want fried rice -- my opinion is NO. Don't get it. Not worth the upgrade price for a little bowl. In fact, I just made my own fried rice by tossing the veggies and shrimp together with the steamed rice that comes with the meal. Ok, so it's not really fried. But the rice was getting cold (it came out right after the salad).  As for the showmanship of the hibachi chef, he was meh. The onion volcano was nice. Maybe it was just an off day for him. He wasn't very engaging, in my opinion.  Overall, I wouldn't go here again unless I had a coupon. So next year?",

You will get a $30 gift voucher you can use for the month of your birthday.  This makes coming here, a no brainer for the value and quality of the food you will get here.    For an appetizer we had a Specialty Sushi Las Vegas Roll - Deep fried. Salmon, avocado, cream cheese, jalapeno, spicy sauce on top.  2 of us shared this and it was tasty and a big portion to share, so don't get this for 1 person if you expect to have room for dinner.  For dinner we the Land 'N Sea which is a filet mignon and sea scallops.  It came with vegetables as well as a ship appetizer and ice cream for desert.  Way too much food for a great price.   Everything was real tasty and with great service. We will definitely return and highly recommend coming here.  This is the best and largest Benihana I have ever seen.  Highly suggest making reservations.",

We were seated immediately since we got there shortly after opening. We orders hibachi steak, seafood Diablo, mango shrimp and Philadelphia rolls. The waitress was very attentive, and the chef was your typical hibachi chef, with the same \"volcano, choo choo train, and egg flying tricks\".  It seems these tricks with the food are standard across the US.  I will add that the chef was very accommodating, when my boys dumped the whole bottle of soy sauce in their rice. He went to the back and brought out more fried rice for them, and get this...... it had chicken.   The reason why I left out a star was because while the food was excellent, the portion sizes were way smaller than your typical Japanese steak house and the prices were a lot higher.   Overall we had a great experience, but I was still a little hungry. I may have been the smallest one in our group, but I sure do eat like my husband.",

You need to like dining with strangers and meeting new people or go somewhere else.  There were four people from Eastern Washington State and two from Texas at our table besides this local.  We ordered different things, but the chef kept everything going well. A woman comes and takes your drink orders first.  After being served the drinks, she brings everyone a bowl of Benihana onion soup.  Then you get a Benihana salad.  Then the chef enters the picture by arriving at the table with his cart of food.  He starts by cooking some shrimp and flipping the tails onto his chef's hat.  He does some other tricks with his knives including the standard teppanyaki onion volcano tower which he then sets on fire.  I ordered the Teriyaki steak, extra rare.  He cooked it perfectly.  He was just as good with everyone else around the table for their preferences.  With the teppanyaki meal, everyone gets a shrimp appetizer, hibachi vegetables,  dipping sauces, steamed rice and hot green tea.  There is also dessert.  I got the green tea ice cream.  I also paid the premium to have chicken fried rice.  I was surprised by how much food there was and everyone but me passed on dessert,  Silly people!  I hadn't eaten teppanyaki in a long time, so I found the evening entertaining and the food delicious.  Also, the people with whom I dined were pleasant and we had some good conversation and some good laughs.  It was a fun evening and I'm glad I came here.  I'll have to do it again in a shorter period of time.",

I feel that when they complained, they should have asked the person causing a scene to leave. Instead, a hotel host went over to welcome him to the casino.

My tastes have changed over the years, and plenty of restaurants are better, but this is one of my mum's all-time favorites, so we went for her birthday.  Most of the staff are helpful but indifferent. (Is it cultural?) I love that they've turned teppanyaki into a fun show, but our cook wasn't really into it. No worries because the food is still good.  You start with some soup (that used to contain more mushrooms and onions). The broth is still good though. Next onto the same salad they've served forever: iceberg lettuce (meh) with a tasty ginger dressing.  Next, onto your \"appetizer\": zucchini, onions, shrimp -- all good, as are the dipping sauces. Then onto your main course. My favorite is the Chateaubriand. You also get some tasty mushrooms. Can't eat it all? Makes for damn good leftovers.  You end with some ice cream and are stuffed to the brim.  Good, fun choice for a group event!",

We came here for a post-SEMA dinner and I was with a bunch of friends from Los Angeles. I've never been to this location, which is inside the Westgate Hotel. The moment I walked in, I was amazed how fancy and huge this place was! A two-story Benihana? Crazy. And the decor was very nice. Little asian bridges, and everything. I was thinking, this must be the biggest Benihana ever, and sure enough, the hostess mentioned that this is, in fact, the largest one in the world. Not only did I think this location was visually impressive, I truly believe that the cooks here were a notch above other locations I've visited. These guys were on their game. They were moving faster, swinging their tools like ninjas, and I had a good time watching the preparation, even though I knew what to expect. And of course the food was excellent. My only complaint was that it took forever to get started with our meal for some reason. The soup and salad portion of our meal lasted so long before our chef came out and started with the main course. Oh, and another very minor complaint...  the crew didn't sing happy birthday to one of our group members when they brought out the birthday ice cream scoop. Otherwise, fantastic. If you can, you should try this place once.  Just one point... even though this is a Japanese-themed restaurant, that doesn't mean you should try to get cute and add -san to everyone's name unless you're speaking Japanese. For some reason, a lot of people were doing that when we went, and it was contagious. Drove me nuts. Anyways, it's hard to have a bad time at any Benihanas so enjoy!",

The waitress wouldn't allow us to make any replacements for these meat-based items and when the food came out there were some sloppy vegetables and Ramen like noodles. I could have done better in my own kitchen. The scorpion fruit drink wasn't bad but after we found out that the drink and our two incomplete orders came to 97 dollars with added gratuity we wish we had stayed home. Don't let the fancy decor fool you, next time a friends asks you to go there for a birthday (since b-day meals are free) DONT GO!",

Went here for dinner with some friends before we head out to go drinking and dancing until the wee hours of the morning.   -1 star for making us wait 30 mins before we can order! I dont understand why we had to wait. The Hibachi chef from the table infront of us finish their meal before ours came to cook for us. I mean, there were 2 tables! We were practically drooling over the aroma that wafted from the other table and we got hungrier and crankier by the minute.  When our turn finally came, we ordered the chicken, spicy chicken and beef entrees. The onion mushroom soup was very light, the shrimp and veggies were crisp and fresh but I did not enjoy the chicken because it came out dry and overcooked. The meal was very filling and we enjoyed the little show that our Hibachi chef put on for us.  -1 star for using too much oil and butter on everything!   I will probably try the Benihana's in CA but I will wait until I get their lunch deals in my email.",

Of course everything in Vegas is outrageous and over the top, and that goes for expensive entertaining Japanese food too!   The chef's were hilarious with cheesy jokes and tricks, but they made it fun. I even was pulled into believing that i was going to catch a bowl of hot fried rice!!!   The place was gorgeous tho! Right next to a Japanese inspired bar/nightclub, it was really entering a Vegas Toyko, complete with waterfalls, bridges, and light shows!  All in all : Vegas Hilton - Go - Eat at Beni's - Do it!",

I gave this one another try after eating there a year ago and Z got sick.  Just not impressed.  Positives: Fun show. Great ambience.  Negatives: We had a reservation for eleven and they put us into one of the smaller tables (bringing in extra seats).  We actually couldn't get in and out of seats without the people next to us moving.   Charging extra for dishes not being cooked on the grill. To expensive for the quality of the food (tasted frozen).  Benihana recognizes that their quality has slid and are putting an effort into improving but it just isn't worth the cost at this time (they actually had articles about it at the hostess desk funny enough).",

Then you sit down with your party and some strangers at a table and prepare for a show.  There was really a mixed bag this time and this definitely wasn't our first time to this or any other Benihana.   Our waitress was nice and friendly and her service was attentive.  Our Chef however was not the showman that the other tables got to experience or anything like the chefs that we remember.  He was a bit lackluster.   In Las Vegas especially the performance value should be stepped up a bit.  The food was Ok....not bad.  Nothing to rave about for the price of it.  We ordered shrimp, chicken and steak and we all agreed it was OK, but nothing to write home about.  For dessert we shared a cheesecake.  Ehhh, I can make it better myself.  Not sure I would go back next time we are visiting Vegas.  There are too many wonderful restaurant choices out there.  Decor is a 5 and everything else was a two or three.",

I hope the recent name change of the hotel doesn't scare people away as this is the only Benihana in Vegas. I would hate to see this place close. My only complaint is that sometimes they participate in the advertised \"chefs special\" and sometimes they don't. It really depends on the waiter or waitress... Too bad for the guy that said no...

I chose this restaurant to have a family dinner because it is loved by most of my family.  I went here thinking I knew already how the night was going to be played out.  I was caught off guard the second I walked in the door.  The inside takes you to a land far far away...filled with bamboo, little creeks with running water, and hostesses in full Kimono gear.  There are plenty of nice lounge chairs to sit and wait for your table...I was so used to getting crammed into the tiny waiting area or packed into the miniature bar were I can basically blow my wad right there...  I was soooo excited to see our little buzzer light up because now I get to go up their lil' hut inspired elevator to the second floor where all the tables are set up.  I was pleasantly surprised to see all the chefs were actually Japanese! Say wha!  Where are the Mexicans!!!  I am soo used to them talking in a language that I do not understand to my husband that is of the bean persuasion.  Now, for the first time, my husband and I will both not know what is being said.  They have different tricks while cooking too!  Not the same ole stuff like at all the other ones.  It is truly stunning here...a nice fun meal for a family.  Beautiful decor.  They had this bitchy old lady that got all pissy when I didn't want to buy the picture she took of me and the family though...boooooo",

You go by a walkway with twinkly lights and a tall waterfall and a zen garden.  After getting seated with people that we didn't know, we ordered and the chef came.  His jokes were really cheesy, but it was really fun because he was so interactive.  I got the Habachi steak and BF got the filet mignon.  I really should have gotten what he got.  His steak was cooked perfectly and was not chewy at all (unlike mine).  All in all, a great experience.",

    "text": "My first (and only) trip to Benihana's served as the reception to a friend's wedding.  We had about 25+ people in our party, but they were expecting us, so it wasn't much of a wait.  At first we all gathered in a very chill bar at the front entrance.  Plenty of chairs and low lighting make it comfortable.  We filled up three huge tables.  The service took a while, but it was a busy Saturday night and given our huge group, I give it a pass.  On to the food.  You might have heard from your friends, et al about the Benihana's gimmick.  After you place an order, a chef comes out to your table and makes it all right in front of you on tabletop grills.  Sure enough, that's what happens and the chef's also have a little standup act going to add to the showmanship.  It actually made it very fun.  Certainly beats sitting around for a half hour for your food.  I had the Chicken Hibachi.  The early courses include soup and salad (nothing special) and your choice of shrimp or veggies.  I went for the shrimp, because I'd never had shrimp before. (I know, I know)  To tell you the truth, it was kinda bland.  The chicken on the other hand was incredible.  Add a little bit of teriyaki and you'll be loving it.  The pricing is high, but not astronomical.  I paid about 30 bucks for my meal, which is among the cheaper items.  The specialty alcoholic drinks are overpriced for what you get, so maybe just stick with a coke or beer.  The motif of the restaurant is like some Japanese village, with fountains and such all around.  All in all, not a bad place to celebrate with friends, or to take a date.",

Because here they don't do Garlic rice. Wtf ! that's what Benihana is known for. It makes the rice   She told us IF we wanted garlic butter it would be $8 extra! Really $8 for garlic fried rice over steamed. No!! Not for some damn butter  No one in our table upgraded the rice, they thought the same thing... It's not that i don't have $8 but why in the hell would anyone pay $8 for garlic butter! Any Benihana or teppanyaki place i been to that is included, either you want the garlic fried or steamed. And you always go for the garlic! Besides that ordeal the food was ok nothing special--well at least not this location",

So we got the rice and they charged us $7 extra for it. So my bill was double what we wanted to spend because they said we had to get the shrimp and all the other extras. Then they come by and pretend that ice cream is included in your 6 courses.... and offer it to my child without letting us know it cost more money... luckily I was able to say no before she walked away. Then they didn't know how to split the bill in two and left us sitting there forever and blamed it on the cashier saying their cashier arrived late.... even tho everyone else at the table had paid and left. We did not get any fun at the table. While the other tables with lightin up with fire and cheering... our table was quiet and no special effects.  The lady that came to take pictures arrived as we were leaving because she said she had kids and it's summer time so she had a hard time getting to work. So we didn't get a picture either.

The portions were very small for the price compared to other hibachi places I have been which is the main reason for only 3 stars. Our steak, chicken and shrimp were cooked to perfection but the rice lacked flavor and the vegetable portion was very small. I also think that the fried rice should be part of the hibachi price and not an $8 upgrade from a bowl of steamed rice.",

They have their weird rule where you CANNOT place your food order unless your table is filled (yes, you have to share a big table with other people). After 40 minutes, my husband and my kid started to complain to me they were super hungry and if we should just leave without eating anything.   Food was not as expected neither. We should've picked a random hotel to get buffet at this price range.",

I will say the decor is nice but the quality of the food was horrible.  Oh and they are way overpriced. I've been to many other locations in other states and even the one on the Las Vegas strip, so I know what to expect. First off, they provided us with the holiday menu. No, it was not a holiday! (They usually serve the holiday menu on Christmas)This menu is limited to 2 pages and offers less options as the regular menu. Also the prices on the holiday menu are even more expensive. When asked about the menu, the waiter joked and said \"everyday is a holiday\".  NO.. you are just trying to take advantage of tourists and those that have never been here by jacking up the prices to make more money. So we asked if we could still order the salmon (which is on the regular menu but not on the holiday menu) and let me tell you, that was a mistake! The salmon was the worst part of the meal. It was a thin filet of fish with no flavor. Not the same type of salmon that I've had at all of the other locations. This was very disappointing especially for the price! Also the shrimp appetizer was way undercooked, I didn't even finish because it was so chewy and tasted like rubber. And the fried rice was an extra $7 , which usually the fried rice is $4 , again we had to order from holiday menu because they want to make more money which is a total scam.",

The staff & chef was very nice, professional and attentive. There were a few awkward silences he didn't have many jokes or entertainment (as I've experienced with other chefs @ different places) but he was a great cook. The food tasted great. But if I had to be honest I don't believe it was worth the $200 bill for the 2 of us. Most of the party had a $80-100 bill. Which would not have been bad if the food was worth it. I believe that we could have gone to Hikari for better food & less money.  I think you are paying for the popular name mostly.  It was a great experience,  glad we did it. Not sure I'd ever go back.",

We were running a bit late for our reservation time so I called to let them know. All she did was \"uh huh, and ok\" me... then I was still talking and she hung up on me! I'm sorry but for a restaurant of this stature, I expect to be spoken to with respect and this is something management should be listening to and training their people on proper customer service. Then we were talking g to another guy there and he said the same thing about her! And to make matters worse, I had the yellowtail sashimi and a steak and shrimp combo and I got an \"upset stomach\".

The service wasn't horrible, but not impressive at all. The drinks were really bad, watered down. The food was worse!!! The mushroom broth was nothing to get excited about. The dressing on the salad was watery, with very little flavor. Our chef on the hibachi table had very little personality or skill. The food was cut in huge pieces, not bite size at all.  I ordered the Hibachi Chateaubriand, the steak itself was a decent quality. Their so called garlic has no bit of garlic flavor what so ever. I asked for my steak medium rare and it was cooked medium maybe even medium well, and cut in such huge pieces it was difficult to enjoy. The fried rice which is always my favorite part of hibachi, was very disappointing! It had no flavor, and had tough pieces of chicken in it???? I really was extremely unhappy with every part of this restaurant.",

The manager had no reasonable explanation for the lack of disrespect to locals. We were told, \"You didn't disclose you were a local.\" Our response was, \"We reserved our table with a 702 phone number. How are we NOT local?\" Avoid the Westgate hotel.

The food was mediocre at best, one of the waiters was quite rude to my daughters and the other kids at their table (they were ALL very well behaved young ladies and there was no need for rudeness), the portions were TINY and the prices very large. The total bill for the 5 that we were paying for was almost $200 and we all went away feeling still hungry (thank goodness for the sides of white rice to help fill us up a little). In that $200, there were only 2 pretty inexpensive cocktails (maybe $15 of the total bill). My girls are not big eaters and the $30ish/plate dinners were not nearly enough food for them.

Now after hostess seats your group at the table, you end up watching chef's show for at least 30 minutes on the opposite side of the table! Finally after a while waitress brings you drinks! Now menu itself is confusing cause you have no clue what you getting for enlisted price. So let's say you have figured out how anything works you finally place an order! CAUTION: Do NOT go there hungry, you might get tempted to steal food from across the table, cause the waiting time is soooo long. I ordered steak and salad with steamed rice and so salad comes first, absolutely tasteless and then you get after another 15 minutes steamed rice, and then after half a century you get your steak and so overall besides little show that chef puts on you do not get what you paid for! All combined is what Panda Express would get you for $10! Not returning for sure! I'm giving 5 star for ambience and skilled chef! Food is half a star! All combined 3 star and I've been generous!",

It also looks dead from the outside because the sushi restaurant isn't very busy.  HOWEVER it was packed inside!  The food was very good, and our chef Rolly made the whole experience amazing.  If it wasn't for the fact that making a reservation seemed pointless this would be a 5 star rating.",

Decor is to die for... and the rubber like consistency of the over salted calamari will bounce ya right back to semi-consciousness only to yet be knocked back down by a chef trying to flip greasy shrimp tails into everyone's plates.  Oops... sorry it splashed down in your $20.00 watered down drink.  Waitress was clearly upset when I asked if onion soup had a meat base as she needed to go ask. *FWIW - It has pork, chicken and MSG.  Food was way overpriced and far from gourmet and very small portions.  Lesson learned is to stick with Makino's dependability on great food at a very fair price and you cant go wrong.",

When visiting here I had just started not eating meat and ordered the tofu dinner.  $22.50 for tofu!   I also ordered the novelty drink served in a ceramic maneki neko cat.  The drink of course was all sweetness and no alcohol.  Super novelty restaurant with mediocre food ... maybe it's because I ordered tofu and don't like seafood?  However, I was out with my friends so overall, I had a good time.  Loved the decor!  Upon entering the restaurant I felt like I was walking into a ride at Disneyland!",

    "text": "I have heard for years how great it was at Benihana's. How much better it was than other japanese steakhouses, etc. Also, I expected it to be on the high side, but BOY was I in for a surprise. 1. The menu showed $28.95 for the Hibachi steak for one. And I am sure somewhere it says the fried rice is extra, but I didn't see it. 2. I ordered the hot tea - it tasted like balsa wood. 2a. I ordered the diet coke because it was the only sugar free item on the menu. [Diabetes type II] 3. I ordered the Hibachi steak medium well, was asked if I wanted fried rice, of course! 4. The diet coke is a 14 oz glass with 10 oz of ice. 5. No choice of ginger or cream sauce [I don't like ginger on my salad.] 6. only positive so far, the soup was OK. 7. drank my 4 oz zof coke and asked for a refill 8. finally after waiting close to an hour, the chef arrives bringing his scowl with him. I didn't laugh once. He only did two 'tricks' and put no heart into it. 9. finally another good thing. grilled shrimp appetizer, about a half dozen. 10. No one is laughing however and it looks like the rice won't be that good. It isn't bad, but is lack luster. 11. Grilled vegies also nothing to write home about. 12. Where's my second 4 oz of diet coke? 13. What happened to those wonderful noodles I get at Shoguns? not here! 14. Steak is overdone and tough. not a happy camper tonight.  15. Chef leaves with the scowl he brought, but now the whole table is scowling with him. 16. Still no diet coke refill! ate all I wanted, which was not as good as Mikata, much less Shoguns. 17. Surprise. Bill is 28.95 for steak, 3.50 for the coke and a whopping 5.95 for the rice. with tax it's around 42.00. This is for ONE PERSON, no alcohol and only one softdrink.?!?!?   Guess what kind of tip I left!  Shoguns on the worst night was more fun, faster, more food and better food, and HALF the price!!! AND they don't charge extra for FRICKIN' RICE!  I will never darken the doors of Benihanas again as long as I live.",

    "text": "I'm typically not a big fan of chains, but I had a meal coupon to burn and my choices were limited to the Las Vegas Hilton restaurants so I dared to suffer through what I was expecting to be a mediocre meal.  This particular Benihana though was surpisingly nice.  The decor was extremely nice with all the nice Japanese touches.  I'd recommend going here just to take a look and hang out in the lounge areas.  Teppanyaki is done on a grill which you sit about 8 people around each grill.  The seats are a bit crowded together so use the restrooms before you sit down.  The waitress will take your order which is usually beef, chicken and/or seafood combos.  After your typical soup and salad (which were decent but nothing special), the show begins.  The chef twirls and clashes his cooking utensils like a crazed knife-fighter.  The most common and popular trick seems to be the flaming volcano.  The cook reverse-stacks some onion rings to make a volcano shape in which he pours in some oil and lights the oil.  The flames shoot pretty high and after the oil is burned off, it continues to smoke for a long time.  Neat trick.  Food is usually cooked in this order: Veggies, Seafood, Meats.  (So if you are in a rush, order seafood only combos).  The quality of the food was decent, but nothing spectacular as one might expect.  The sauces were nothing special and didn't seem to really enhance the flavor of the meats and seafood.  So if you are looking for an entertaining dinner show while you are in Vegas, this is as good as any.  If you are looking for some really tasty food, I'd look elsewhere.  4 stars for the nice decor, 3 stars for the food.  Recommended for groups of up to 8 people and people dining on the company dime.",

I was ready to order from the sushi chef, but he never acknowledged me or looked my way. The waitress took my full order and went from there. Received my sashimi combo and was quite pleased by the quantity, freshness and presentation. Now the confusion, I was ready to pay with some gift cards, but was told they couldn't be applied to the bill because they're not really part of Benihana per say. . . ? Huh? Just the trepan is. Huh? I've been to other Benihanas and the sushi bar is part of the restaurant. The sushi chef and the waitress both began to apologize and explain the situation, which I did understand, but still bummed I couldn't use $75 of gift cards. Good meal and service, wanted to spend that $75 on the tables . . .",

However, I had higher expectations of the food, the portions are very large..(I ate about half of my serving) but..idk..I just don't think the food is that great for the price...but it was definitely worth the overall experience.",

Got seated in a corner table, so it offered a little bit of privacy. Looked at the menu. Was a bit pricey. Oh well, I wasn't paying. Lol. Got 'Rocky's Choice' which is the steak and chicken combo. It first comes with the soup. Good. Then comes the salad with the ginger dressing. Good. Then comes the table cook. Eh. Ok I guess. Some guys have personality. This guy had none. Did the onion volcano, but that was about it. No fancy tricks other guys do. For the meal, they give u two types of dipping sauce. The brown sauce is for seafood and veggies. The white sauce is for the chicken and the steak. It usually is a really good sauce at other steakhouses, but here it was just plain nasty. It had a chemically taste to it which after some thinking about it was a resemblance to hot Chinese mustard, but without the kick. Overall, was a good dinner. Deserves a solid 4 stars.",

I have been to many benihanas in my life, and this is the first time I can say they food was delicious and the portions large. I had the shrimp, scallop, calamari plate. All was perfectly cooked and tender. My bf had the sushi and said it was good as well. The show is always the same and boring, but the smile it put on my daughters face was priceless.",

A stream, bridge and lots of cherry blossom trees. The actual dining area  is inside of a house which is inside of the inside/outside tea garden, overlooking the stream. A hostess dressed in full kimono attire escorts you to your table. Other than all that, it's just a regular old Benihana...",

Not a fan, go to P.F Changs down on paradise or at planet hollywood if you want a nice atmosphere and some \"americanized\" asian food to please a group for less dough.

If you've ever been to a hibachi place, you know the drill: chefs twirling knives, tossing shrimp to you, making volcanoes out of onions, the whole bit. There are two stories of hibachi stations which are seemingly always filled with people celebrating a birthday, wedding, or anniversary or business travelers staying in the hotel because it's adjoined to the convention center. It's a little on the pricey side with the cheapest entree being around $30 but I feel like that price point is to be expected for a celebration-type event.

    "text": "Today was my friends 20th birthday. Me and 3 other girls came and we all make decent money, however the bill at Benni Hanna is on average 50-60 per person. The waitress flat out ignored most of the people at the table. I said I didn't want a drink she brought me water. I set it on the corner of the table so they would take it away. They come back and ask if I ordered a drink, so I asked if they have dr pepper, no, so I said nothing. She brings a coke and I said I don't want this. I wasn't going to pay for things I didn't ask for. I asked for the tempura shrimp app, she argued about it with me and kept telling me it wasn't apart of the meal, I kept telling her I know. They bring it out and I paid $13 for 2 pieces of shrimp and then vegetable tempura which I didn't want. I said specifically I didn't want any of the appetizers but they still tried to give me the soup and salad and the vegetables. They gave me such a small portion of chicken. And the waitress blatantly ignored the dirty glasses Etc on our table. The waitress didn't even break my change and apparently expected me to tip her in 10's and 20's. I barely tipped her. I spend $60 on a mediocre meal with awful service. Even the other two couples at our table seemed upset. One of the men flat out didn't eat his food and pushed it away with the napkin on top. My friend had a really bad birthday and we will never go to any Benni Hanna again.",

After calling a few restaurants, we were surprised about how many eateries were fully booked on a Tuesday night and could not accommodate a reservation for party our size. But Benihana happily took our reservation and it ended being the best thing that could have happened because we truly enjoyed an incredible meal. Our grill chef Tommy was so funny and entertaining and we truly enjoyed every portion of our meal -- all 6 courses were delicious! We highly recommend the hibachi chicken, steak and shrimp. You simply can't go wrong with any of those choices. The grilled veggies and chicken fried rice are also excellent and cooked to perfection. While their prices are on the high end, it's totally worth it for all the courses you get including ice cream for dessert, plus you'll be entertained by one of their great grill chefs! They also sang happy birthday to my daughter and gave her a cute porcelain buddha for good luck. Although they automatically charged tip because of our party size, we added an extra $25 because we had such a great time. Our server said it wasn't necessary, but we insisted and she expressed such gratitude. Benihana is a memorable experience for the entire group and great spot for any special occasion!",

    "text": "The sooner you know the gimmick / premise that is Benihana, the more tolerable it will be. No one in their right mind would ever come here for \"authentic Japanese cuisine\" but like any cheesy reality show, it's all about the experience. It is alive and well for the now Las Vegas Hotel (formally HIlton) establishment, with full on displays of in your face cooking and awe-inspiring food play (#1).   For those not in the know, Benihana is a chain of faux Japanese stirfry, where folks sit around a giant grill, where a chef cooks the meal in front of the guests, serving it fresh off the grill. Due to a height in popularity and a lack of Japanese US people, it's usually a non-Japanese person doing the cooking. One thing different about this Benihana is LVH's ability to slot in actual Japanese people or Asian actors with an impossibly good Japanese accent. Either way, it keeps the facade going and the customers happy. (#2)  From the tacky Japanese decor that makes me feel like I'm on a boat to the wait staff dressed in what appears to be uncomfortable kimonos, it baffles me how this is considered a \"fine dining\" restaurant for casino standards. The prices certainly match it, most of the hibachi grilled meats will run anyone from $23-32. Throw in seafood and the price nearly doubles. You know you're an expensive place when the cheapest thing offered on the menu are sushi rolls ($8-12), along with dessert.  The food isn't a total fail but it's far from a total win. Sadly overpriced, it's the reality of most casino establishments any way. When in Vegas, try to let someone who had a good day in the casino take the bill, or get it comp'd off. I think Benihana works best as a general group dining restaurant, one where the experience will likely trump the food. ________ (#1) Not to mention smelly clothes and a potential food porn grease facial. (#2) I still feel bad for the guy behind the grill.",

This hotel is a super-saver for those traveling on a budget.  I went to Benihana inside this hotel for this past week's Thanksgiving dinner with a friend for our Thanksgiving Vegas vacation.  It was the best idea.....this idea even beat over the last buffet we had at Rio which sucked!!!    Anyways, because we were hotel guests, we had the coupon for $25 off on two lobster+steak specials.  We were also going green for the hotel, and the hotel gave us coupons for food and beverage purchases which helped a ton.  When I ordered the lobster+steak special, my plate came out to be $21-ish including tax and tip.....can't beat this price!!!!  All of the chefs in this restaurant, so called the World's Largest Benihana, were very talented.  I was watching one of the chefs cook at one of the other tables before ours arrived.....what a great show!!  If you're looking to save up on watching a show, you should try Las Vegas Hilton's Benihana....why not?  You get dinner+cooking show!!  So....the choice is yours....",

They upped the cost of many things, including the rice to $8! Wow. And then some lil things. Like the salad dressing didnt taste the same as it used to. The teriyaki steak didnt really taste much like teriyaki. And the scallops looked smaller. Just seems like the product has been downgraded a bit & the cost has gone up. Was generally disappointed. Aside from the architecture its no diff than the geisha house or any other teppanyaki place. Sad to say we wont be going back anytime soon.",

We said that was not what we ordered and the waiter said they don't make blended margaritas. It would have been helpful to know before hand.  Then my husband said he wanted chicken fried rice instead of regular fried rice and the waiter said its $8 and only ordered as a side. Wait what?! Ok. Then I ordered fried rice for my meal and he said it'll be $8, I told him I don't want chicken he said its $8 anyway. You get steamed rice that's only choice he said it used to be $1.50 up charge to upgrade. They increased it X7! That's outrageous. I cancelled and ordered Salmon roll instead because I felt taken advantage of. My husband ordered his 5 course chicken meal  It was ok, my salmon roll tasted like mayo and cream cheese roll. Little bit of salmon, $16 for this . I would expect more salmon. Won't be returning. Not worth the money.",

Happy wife will make sure I fall asleep happy, later, at the hotel.  I can usually make word association end in the way I want it. But starting with Benihana makes it almost too easy!!  Generally, I'm not a fan of chain restaurants. And Benihana is not an exception. Except for this Vegas location. And it's not because of the sushi and sake, which I find around average. But, the decor, the architecture, the ambiance- it's stunningly beautiful and aesthetically gratifying. Just an incredible place to have dinner. First came here in the mid 90's when it was the Hilton. Rather amazing Beni is still here almost 25 years later, considering most of the 75-100 restaurants I've eaten at in Vegas are long gone. Even one from last November!!  The teppanyaki show is great fun, of course. But, I prefer a more romantic seating here, because like my word association shows.... my mind's occupied with events to occur later.   Can't say I recommend any Benihana anywhere, but this is the one exception. Breathtaking restaurant, and a fun dinner show if you want that.",

I haven't been to this location in years so this was a treat for sure. First off, this is probably the most beautiful Benihana location in the entire US. There's a beautiful waterfall with wooden bridges, samurai armor, lotus trees; the works. The tables themselves were huge; there was eleven of us in our party and we were good to go.  Compared to other Benihana locations, this was definitely the most expensive. Of course, it's located in a high end hotel with a ridiculously gorgeous ambience so that was expected before we got here. Our chef was AMAZING! He was hilarious and everything he cooked tasted great. I was watching the other tables and their chefs were cardboard. We definitely got the most entertaining chef. The portions were huge and overall we had a great time. The ONLY bad part is that I didn't realize the gratuity charge. I knew with a group this large that gratuity was expected. However, when the bill came it had a space for a tip. They didn't list the gratuity charge. So I added a thirty dollar tip. When the final receipt came; they added the fifty dollar gratuity with the thirty dollar tip. Kinda shady. Not to mention, other members of the group tipped the chef as well since he was so damn good. Overall, Benihana got over one hundred-twenty dollars in tips. Lesson learned; if you have a group of seven or more; they WILL added the gratuity in your bill. Other than that, it was a great meal in a beautiful location and we were thoroughly entertained.",

Our chef was really good though and kept us entertained with his cooking skills.  Also the people at the table were fun and talkative. After the dinner was served we were still waiting for a check after sitting there for almost one hour and 30 minutes. No one came by to offer us our desserts which was in included with the dinner.

The atmosphere where you sit and eat is also very good at this location. They should've gotten 5/5 but the people serving this night (waitress) wasn't that good, a little bit grumpy. But everybody is allowed to have a bad day. But as I said in the beginning if you've never tried Benihana you need to!",

However I didn't enjoy the fact that while he's cooking your entire self is now smelling like a kitchen just as bad. The prices are very expensive, I think with that kinda money you can really enjoy something so much better.  For example our bill for 2, came out to be $170!!!  We could've gone to Fogo de Chao which is an amazing Brazilian steakhouse and it'd be cheaper.  Just think that the prices are a bit outrageous for what's offered.  The entertainment was great. Prolly won't be going back to this restaurant, it was my first time there ever.",

The customer service was on point.   Reservation highly recommended   Food was fresh tasting. Cooked to perfection. Scallops, shrimp and lobster were mouthwatering in lemon and butter. It was cool to see all the food cooked right in front of you.   Onion soup was simple and had delicious broth. The salad was also simple but the dressing was thick and tasty. A different variation on French onion.The chicken breast and filet mignon were great! I love my filet mignon medium rare and it couldn't have been anymore mouthwatering. Melt in your mouth. Perfect portions. You won't over eat. Pricy but where else can you have your chef doing spins and tricks. Flipping shrimp tails and cracking thrown eggs?! Telling amazingly cheesy jokes that you can't get enough of. The drinks just kept coming and the food never stopped  Everyone should come here for the experience of hibachi if you've never experience it before because there's nothing else as personal and awesome as it",

What made things worse was when I reached out to Benihana on Twitter about our experience, I had to fill out a separate form and then never received any kind of response. The customer support I received online was much worse than the poor service we got at the restaurant.",

In fact this goes for all of the restaurants in that location - the sushi place as well as the noodle place are slow as molasses too. If the service was better (much much better) I'd give it 4-5 stars, but it's just so slow and you'll wait forever just to order simple things. Don't come here if you have a show to catch or want to call it an early night. Again, the food is good, but the wait is forever.",

As soon as our waitress saw we had a birthday coupon she rolled her eyes and gave us a dirty look.   Our first drink order we asked 3x for limes with my boyfriends cocktail. Never received. I ordered a strawberry margarita. Received strawberry colada. Waited for My server who never even came back to see if everything was ok so we proceeded to drink our drinks as we already waited. And wanted our drinks before our meal. When she finally came back to the table I ordered another round. Asking please make sure it's a margarita this time. Received daiquiri.   So both my drinks were not even close what I ordered.  I also ordered shrimp tempura, I received vegetable tempura and was charged for a shrimp tempura.   Our teppan chef was amazing, and the only reason for a 2 star rating I wish I had cash to tip him separate from our waitress. I'm a server I never leave less than 30%, if she gave good service to the only person at the table wearing $10,000 in accessories she probably would've received a tip 10x the amount of what I left. Leaving $10 on a $150 check is not me. But I expect the service to match the bill.   She should go work fast food because service industry is not for her",

As you walk into this place you find yourself right smack dab in the middle of Japan.  Who knew walking through an old worn down hotel you would find yourself in a hidden jewel?!  We arrived for our 7pm reservation for 5 on Friday night for my friend's birthday.  Without hesitation we were lead to an elevator that takes you to the second level.  My friends being that they have been here several times never had been to the second level.  We were seated in kind of a quiet room with only two tables being used-out of six.  There were other rooms we walked by even bigger that were full and totally loud.  So I dont know what is worse being loud in a quiet room or screaming over people in a loud room?! LOL    The dinner was awsome.  I ordered the spicy chicken breast and the BF ordered the filet.  Both were amazing.  The chicken really wasnt all that spicy but it was still good.  Everyone else loved their food.  We asked for our fried rice extra crispy and the chef was fine with leaving it on there a little longer.  Because it was my friends bday they gave her a kids chefs hat (hehe) and let her man the food for a minute.  It was great for pics.  The chef was great and very entertaining.  The only complaint I had was the waitress wasnt picking up the empty glasses and dishes we were done with so they accumulated in the middle where there was an empty chair between us and the other party.  A little tacky I would say.  So with everyone ordering 2 drinks and a dinner each our bill was $320.00.  That didnt count the $20 we gave the chef beforehand and the total tip at the end.  Whew thats a hefty bill but the experience and food were worth it.  A great memory!  On our way out there were little secluded areas with couches where you can sit and over look the 1st level and just chill and have some drinks.  Totally cool.  Not sure if you can rent those but it would be cool to have a small party there.  So on our way out FIRE WORKS!  Yes fireworks shown on the upper walls just for us!  It was pretty cool I must say.  *Great Place for a Date, for a Group and definitely for an occasion for the price.",

That's the best I can say. Our server spoke very accented English, (good for him to learn our language), and he spoke very fast. It was hard to understand him. The chef was funny but not very entertaining. His skills at the table were very limited. Not really much of a show. The food was very bland. I had to add sauce to the fried rice ($8.00), mushrooms, and zucchini. I saw most everyone else do the same. I had the \"spicy chicken', It was the only thing that had flavor. Not spicy mind you but flavor.  All in all, a very expensive tasteless meal.  I have been to one other Benihana, in Florida, and I felt the same way about the food. My advice is to find a teppanyaki restaurant that is not named Benihana. I have always enjoyed those better.",

I ordered the Land & Sea (filet and scallops) which my husband went with the spicy hibachi chicken.   Our chef was open to special requests (extra garlic butter on everything for one of the ladies seated at our table, extra lemon on the scallops for me) and cooked my filet to a perfect medium rare. He also ensured his was adding enough 'heat' to my husband's chicken, and asked him if he wanted more sauce after his meat was cooked.   After our entree, we were offered hot tea and a green tea ice cream sundae was brought out to me, complete with whipped cream, a cherry, a piece of pocky and a candle.   Benihana isn't the best teppanyaki place I have been to, but it's a decent choice and I am sure I will be back, but probably not until next September.",

The drinking water arrived at the table and looked murky, I guess they expected us to buy bottle water in addition to the alcohol we ordered with our meal.  Seeing how it was triple digits hot outside, I think it was in extremly poor judgment to provide unpotable water.  It tasted funny too everyone acted like it was just fine, when in fact it was horrible.  I spend over 200 dollars for a meal here and was treated like a herd of cattle.",

They still do the whole birthday that you get free ice cream comes with candle, you get extra attention from the chef being star or sometimes have multi stars since fill each table (since in all have six people in our group had whole table too ourselves), and kids still give you the benihana hat. I always remember so nice knowing that certain things about Benihana always the same. They give you free birthday pic with your group.  Our teppanyaki chef was very funny and my nieces enjoyed the show. It always adds another element having dinner teppanyaki style. The food was good. I had the hibachi spicy chicken that was good. It not over spicy but had nice kick too it. I also had a spicy tuna roll start my meal. Good. Sushi Benihana mot one of those places would recommend but since there had sushi itch like why not. It was good. The menu is pretty diverse from steaks, chicken, and seafood. The drinks menu is pretty diverse too.   In all would say if want mix it up one night almost free entertainment with the teppanyaki chef and good food. Benihana great choice!",

Rice is on the menu so when you said yes you don't realize that they are charging you an extra $8.50 because it is really chicken fried rice. The meat and lobster was not season very bland. The meal included dessert (Deluxe Treat) and when we asked for it the lady said it didn't at this point we were so disgusted we just left. Overall this restaurant is overrated and overpriced.",

    "text": "As always, make a reservation!  We loved the interior design, it was all very clean and you really feel like youre in Japan!  This was our first time so I'll explain how it works, you sit at a table with the grill built in, theres 8 seats in total, so if you less than 8 in your party you will be sharing the table with strangers. That can be make or break for your experience right there, if the people at your table are rude that will totally suck. Our table group wasn't lively at all, so it was kinda a downer but no the fault of Benihana. You order your food and appetizers from your waiter, all entrees are cooked to order right in front of you. It takes a good amount of time from ordering to actually eating so be prepared for that. We had Mike as our chef and he was really awesome. They make jokes and do tons of tricks. The average plate is between $25-$50. So you can leave spending only around $70 if you want.   Our waiter was really good to until the end of the night,as you eat you food the other partys finish and pay, and if they don't get dessert you'll be the last ones there. Unfortunately I think the other parties didn't tip very well, cause our waiters attitude changed as soon as they had left. It kind of sucked that he has such an attitude while me and my girlfriend had our tea and ice cream. But I still feel the experience was worth 5 stars.",

    "text": "Alright.  For those who want the short and simple:  The quality of the food does not match the price.  Now for the longer review.   This place is overpriced for what you get.  I ordered the filet mignon.  It came with steamed rice, sauteed zucchini, sauteed mushrooms, sauteed onions, miso soup with mushrooms, and grilled shrimp.  There wasn't a lot of flavor in any of the above foods. I've been to Japan.  The Izikayas, arashi's ramen, yoshi hachi(sushi bar in Okinawa with amazing sushi and amazing hot dishes), mom and pop ramen spots, Sam's by the Sea, Sam's Cafe(a hibachi that will make this hibachi look like the local elementary school's cafeteria), etc.  The Japanese FLAVOR their food.  Tasting this overpriced food with a Japanese name on it is just an insult to Japan and the awesome dishes that are home to the country.  Please understand that when you eat this food that you aren't even CLOSE to authentic Japanese cuisine.  You're just eating some overpriced American food with a decent show.  Oh, the guy cooking your food will have plenty of Dad jokes to entertain you though.  To put it plain...if you want to eat amazing food, not pay a lot of money, and if you want to leave the restaurant full then go somewhere else.  Seriously, I was still hungry when I left this place.  This place is great if you don't want a great meal, have money to. blow, and if you want low quality entertainment.  Also, this place is large.  The coy fish in the little water under the bridge is nice.  The entire facility is nice and clean.  The staff were very professional.  The decor is really nice, but all that doesn't matter when the food isn't good.  Seriously? A 5 star facility with 2 star food? Like I said, if you don't care much about how your food tastes and/or how much it costs then this place is perfect for you.",

    "text": "Benihana is a classic choice for an entertaining dinner. If you're not familiar with the restaurant it's known for its sushi and hibachi style of cooking (where they cook all the food right at your table).  The first thing you definitely need to do is make a reservation! Benihana will often try to seat 8 people together, so if you don't have a reservation you may have to wait a little longer.  The menu has plenty of options, but when you're here I highly recommend the steak and seafood. I had the Benihana Trio which also came with chicken. While the chicken wasn't bad, it didn't even compare to how good the shrimp and filet mignon tasted.  They say at Benihana its all about the experience and that couldn't be more True. It is definitely not a cheap option, as two people getting drinks can easily spend $150. We were lucky to have an amazing chef in Tuan. He was entertaining and made the entire table feel included. There was another chef at a nearby table that wasn't nearly as talkative or friendly as Tuan was with our table.  The restaurant is very large and beautifully designed, it's the perfect place for a small family gathering or as part of a date night out on the town.",

Even though I had a reservation, it took quite a while to get seated, then another delay before the chef arrived, so it was over 30 minutes before things got cooking. The preparation and food was very good, as it usually is, but there was another 15 minute wait after the end of the meal due to some \"cashier issue\"...or at least that's what the server` said.  I don't know if this was a one time thing, or if service here is headed in the wrong direction. Either way, I don't think I'll be back again for a while.",

The restaurant itself is beautifully decorated and there are two floors for seating. Reservations are highly recommended (using the Open Table app) especially during busy weekends. If you're a guest at the hotel you can also call the reservation line for help. I'm not sure if this is free or subject to additional fees. This is Vegas after all and nothing is free.   TIP: Make sure all of your guests are with you when you're ready to be seated. As noted with previous reviews, the hostess (Ana) can be rude when it comes to this issue. And I also noticed that she became nicer when the female manager came over to assist with waiting customers.",

Walking towards the back there is a waterfall where you can walk on a little bridge that leads to a lounge waiting area.

    "text": "One of the nicer Japanese steakhouses I've been to.  We had a party of 7 so made a reservation and were seated with 3 others to complete our table of 10.   We were walked over a bridge through a lounge area and brought to an elevator the 2nd floor.  This Benihana was huge!  When seated we were warned that the grill was hot so to make sure not to touch.  We ordered sake for the group and proceeded with ordering entrees.  My friend is allergic to shellfish so we advised the server and they accommodated by making sure her food was cooked and served first.    I ordered the scallop and steak combo and opted out of the fried rice since it was an additional $8 upcharge. Apparently I was the only person at the table that stuck with the steam rice, I figured I'll still get to watch the show and not pay the upcharge right?    Just like most teppanyaki steak houses you get the soup, salad with ginger dressing and veggies first.  Then they make the fried rice and shrimp and whatever entrees the table ordered.  You're paying more for the show, the chef with the jokes and tricks and interaction with the rest of the table, although this wasn't the best Japanese food I've had, I know you're paying for the experience.  The scallops and steak were cooked nicely, the sauces were great accommodations but the food overall was nothing special and the jokes and tricks were nothing I've haven't heard before.    I don't mean to sound like a Japanese steakhouse snob but I've had some chefs really make me laugh and do some pretty cool things.    For a first timer I think it's great, the restaurant itself is gorgeous, I've been to some Teppanyaki restaurants where the jokes are a little more risque for an adult crowd, I will say that even though there were all adults at our table, al the jokes and tricks were family friendly.    I also usually remember portions being small at these types of restaurants but I actually had leftovers!",

Also ordered 2 sushi rolls that were just terrible.  We walked out and soups, salad and drinks were comp'd but I paid $38 for gas station level crap. The device has yet to be invented that can measure my disdain.  Booooo! Westgate needs to axe this place and put in a Wendy's.",

    "text": "Came here during a stay in Vegas. This place is nice on the outside but highly unorganized. We had a party of 6 and made a reservation (there was a 2 hour wait on a Friday night). When we were finally seated, we waited another 30+minutes for someone to come over and take drink orders. Ridiculous. We were seated with another party of 6 and all of us at this point were so hungry, annoyed and ready to walk out. Eventually, 3 ppl in my party were so frustrated with the poor service, they decided to leave and go elsewhere for dinner. At this point, the manager was finally flagged down and we told her the issue. She apologized and immediately took our orders. We were basically the last table for the evening (it was pretty late) so I'm assuming they forgot about our table but this is still no excuse).   This was my first Benihana experience and it was terrible overall. The amount of food offered for the prices at this establishment compared to other hibachi restaurants was comical. If it wasn't for someone in the other party literally telling the managers all of our meals needed to be comped due to the disastrous inconveniences and overall experience, we would have paid $80+ each individually (smh definitely nowhere near worth this amount of money). I appreciated her for that and the manager did oblige and we all ended up paying less than half of that. I would never go back here though but 2 stars for the manager at least trying to do something to salvage this poor experience. The chef was funny so one star for him as well.",

We come to Benihanna's at Westgate every year for my Birthday. Each time they use their little pocket camera and take a photo of me and my lady, put it in a cardboard frame and we add it to our collection. This has become a tradition for us.   However, this year their camera was not working and my Lady expressed her disappointment due to our tradition. The wonderful Michelle (Executive Director) offered to take our picture with one of our Phones and then offered to have their professional photographer come to our table and take our picture after we ate.   Moments after we sat Michelle asked us to come back up front and the photographer was waiting for us.   Last year we purchased a 2 picture package as well as our freebie so we thought we would take a look at these.   Before Dinner even began, the photographer brought us 4 beautifully framed pictures. As we began to ponder which we would like to purchase, the photographer informed us that Michelle had taken care of the cost and all 4 were a gift from her and Benihanna's.   What an amazing gesture. When I attempted to tip her she refused and just requested a hug and again wished me a Happy Birthday!  Our course dinner was great, the Chef funny and kind and I was given $30 off for it being my birthday.   The last thing Michelle did was to  give us her card and ask us to give her a call in advance next year and said  she would take care of us.   Michelle made us feel as if we were the most special guests to ever grace the Benihana Torii.   We will be forever grateful to her and Benihana's at Westgate.",

    "text": "\"If you are here for flavorful quality food, you are in the wrong place.\"  FULL REVIEW If you want a positive experience here, start with the fish tank outside and enjoy the last living fish they have in it. If you want the full experience; just enjoy the ambiance, take a few pictures and go to a streak house or the Wynn buffet a block away.  So let's dissect this beast of a rip off: First off, the hotel is absolute garbage. The one time I made the mistake of booking here, they had to change my room three times due to AC problems. You would think it was admirable that they comped me a Buffet, however this was the result of the worse food poisoning I have ever had in my life. So that said, the is the legacy of this resort. Freemont offers better accommodations, and damn that's saying something already.  PROS The servers were very nice and on point. The chef did his best to be funny but shouldn't take his focus off the cooking for a poorly articulated joke. When he asked how I wanted my steak, I said medium rare and the other two couples around us said well. Somehow he managed to serve mine last after setting them all down to cook at once... maybe he was trying to mask the flavor of the cheap meat (yes that's me being facetious).  CONS The salad and soup starters are an absolute disgrace to the heritage. Two leafs of greens and a slice of mushroom in a tasteless broth. You can get better at 7/11 and save yourself $25 already.  The twin lobster tail; I am originally from Maine. $55? This was an absolute rip off. The tails are small, frozen, and the chef actually had the audacity to serve one and half! I couldn't believe it. SERIOUSLY! GO TO THE 99 CENT MARKET DOWN THE STREET AND HAND PICK THE BIGGEST LIVE LOBSTER YOU CAN FIND AND THEY WILL STEAM IT ON THE SPOT IN 15 MINS YOU HAVE REAL FOOD (that will run you about $25 total). Your welcome.  All the sauteed vegetables completely lacked in flavor. If you are here for flavorful quality food, you are in the wrong place. The chef was so busy making lame jokes - the food matched his humor well. At least he paired that well as a chef. I know it was all scripted and the point here is entertainment, but if you really think that's the only thing food service is about, you should invite chef Ramsey over.  The rice was an up-sell for fried... I had white and my girlfriend tried the friend. Honestly, blind taste, I couldn't tell the difference. My rice cooker is much better chef than everyone in that kitchen combined.  The only thing that made any sense was the sake (if you don't look at the price).  I do regular reviews for things that are amazing around Vegas. Though the resort already put a bad taste in my mouth and I walked in with a sense of skepticism, I was optimistic and chose this location over the one in Fashion Show Mall - I deeply regret paying to eat here. Taste wise, this was the most amature food I have ever paid for. I felt like I was playing with my niece in her play kitchen as she tossed two leafs of greens and a bouillon soup with a tiny mushroom floating in it. This place is a waste of time and money. They should turn it into a laser tag arena. It would suit the hotel perfectly. It's the equivalent of the Boulevard Mall with their little kid parks. Except it's classier there and the prices make sense.  I appreciate your cookie cutter response but why would I blow another $200 on something that still gives me nightmare and turns my stomach? I HIGHLY doubt my review caused even a ripple in the way you run the place. Stop insulting people's intelligence and having them gamble on your pathetic excuse of a restaurant when the odds are stacked against them.. all your sowing is luring people in with shiny things and pretty decorations and lights lol, it's VEGAS who do you think your kidding?",

It's the largest in the world so that's pretty cool and it looks a little like the restaurant used in one of the fight sequences in Kill Bill. There are water features, bridges, tables everywhere it looked like a movie set.   The place was empty, there were maybe 5 people in the downstairs dining area and upstairs there were a few full Teppan tables. We were shoved in a back table in a small room, we got there a little late so we were seated with the most boring people on the planet - and you know fun people are part of the experience of restaurants like this.   It took a few minute to get our drink order and our food order then about 25 minutes go by - no salad, no soup but they sit another two people. Um ok, a little late to the game but whatever. Our soup comes out, the late people give their order, another 15 minutes go by and our salads come out. 30 more minutes go by and oh look our chef. Their timing was horrible, we were sat at 8:15 and our dinner wasn't completely served until 10:20. They were so slow that by the time my steak was served, everything was cold and I was no longer hungry. I've never had a Teppan dinner that was this slow and for the restaurant not being busy there really isn't an excuse for it.   The steak was not good, I ordered it medium rare - it was gray/brown on the outside close to burnt and completely raw and bleeding in the center. Not exactly appetizing and not something I want to eat after waiting that long for my food. The fried rice was marginal, the veggies were ok and so was the shrimp. My husband got the spicy chicken and he loved it, maybe that's the key just stick to the chicken here and skip the steak.   My advice is to stick your head in and walk around, then yelp Teppan and find a local spot to go.",

I will not only not recommend this place to anyone but I would say to just stay away in general. Never bringing them my money again... If I could press charges I would. Do not go here.",

This is definitely the nicest one I have ever been too with the ambiance of the restaurant and the incredible hospitality. Our chef, Kevin took great care of us and did an excellent job making sure everyone at the table was satisfied with everything put on their plates. Excellent food and great service, no complaints.",

While we waited 30 minutes to get a table, we decided to get a couple of Beers at the bar, but the bartender moved like molasses on a cold winter day.  Entire quarter of Denver-Oklahoma game went on before we got our drinks.  The atmosphere of this place is great.  It actually feels like a little Japanese village.  We had to wait another 1 hour before the chef came to actually cook our food.  The food and the show were great.  Their house blend sake was delicious.  A great way of spending $60 over 3 hours.",

Okay bad pun aside, he had a great humor and was very considerate to our needs. I didn't even mind that the manager rushed him to finished with my party faster so he could move on to the next table.  But the service, oh the service was not on par at all. From the moment we walked in the front desk was confusing and a bit condescending. Maybe we just had trouble understanding each other but after I made my reservation for later that evening I walked away confused. I didn't know if they wrote down my reservation, and thought I was merely asking what time dinner started. I returned an hour and a half later to re-verify my reservation. They indeed had it written down, but wrote me for a party of 5 instead of my requested 8.  Overall I don't think I'd really return unless my friend was dieing to try this place out. From the variety of food I got (Beef steak, salmon steak, seafood noodle) it all tasted average, just like my previous visit.",

Especially since my husband is a picky eater and this is one of the select places he will dine.   This was my first time going to the one in Las Vegas though. It's so beautiful. They stay very True to form with their employees. Problem is most of them hardly speak any English. I was used to one overrun with Hispanic chefs. At this location everyone appeared Asian but many didn't speak any English that I could understand. They were all friendly enough though and the decor is gorgeous.  Our chef this time did a decent amount of tricks but I saw some photos that my friends who went a week or so ago had and they got way cooler tricks. Maybe our chef was new? I had two kids at the table so I really would've preferred some cool stuff. He didn't even try to get the shrimp to be caught in anyones mouth.  My biggest pet peeve though and reason for not giving 5 stars is the fried rice was TERRIBLE . Its my favorite part of benihana and he made it dried out with like no flavor. I felt like I could've gotten better at Panda express. That's saying something FOR SURE :/ Plus we asked for our meat to be cooked Medium Well and Well done and both people that requested it had almost bleeding meat. Yet its Benihana and who wants to be the person at the table complaining about their food?  For $250.00 I feel like there are WAY better places to go to in Vegas. I am just sad since in my old home town this was our GO TO PLACE for awesome :/  My kids did have fun and I will probably be back but I definitely wasn't happy when I left.",

The only good thing that came about from my dinner this evening was the comedic chef who lightened the mood. For starters, our waitress was rude to exclusively my friend and me. The other party seated with us was treated far more nicely. My friend simply wanted to inquire about the wait time for our meal and the waitress rudely snapped back that it was coming. After waiting an hour for the food and chef to appear, we waited another 5 minutes because they screwed up my friends entree. The shrimp was undercooked, my tea had a rice grain from a prior customer's meal and the food lacked seasoning. While the meal lacked flavor, our waitress did not lack in bitterness. She not only screwed up our order but also blatantly ignored my friends request to get her drink without ice, three times. Towards the ending of the meal she was pleasant, probably with hopes that we'd tip her. I also mentioned the food in my tea to the bus boy, which we were charged for, and was never brought a replacement. I never drank the tea either.",

    "text": "I am a huge supporter of locally owned restaurants! However, this is something I have always wanted to try, and on Christmas night in Las Vegas I got my chance. Located inside the Hilton is likely the largest Benihana ever built. The atmosphere is like dining outdoors in Japan!  Everyone from the seating hostess, and table waitresses, to our hilarious personal chef were warm and welcoming. You also get the pleasure of dining with other people, which added to the excitement.  This was my first  teppanyaki experience and I loved it.   The food was fresh and savory. My steak and shrimp were amazing, and my friend's Swordfish was the best I've tasted! ...oh, and the starter soup is simply AWESOME!  The food and the \"show\" were something to remember. Highly recommend you give this a try! I am definitely going to give my local Scottsdale location a shot!",

Sometime you can get lucky and make them the same day, but I wouldn't chance it. We made reservations for a Sunday evening at 6:30. We were running late so I called ahead to push my reservation back 30 minutes, the hostess told me they were full and they could only hold our spot for 15 minutes. We make it there at 6:47; they honored our reservation and sat us promptly.  The waitress came around and took our drink orders, she brought me out the wrong wine, but she corrected it right away. It took about 15 to 20 minutes before the chef came out and started taking orders. We all ordered the Benihana Special, which comes paired with steak and a cold water lobster tail, along with soup, salad, veggies and rice. Usually the food is amazing, this time everything came out perfect except the steak which was a bit bland. However, I still enjoyed the experience and would definitely recommend this restaurant to others.",

That is all dependent upon the chef though.... and the one we got at the LV hilton Benihana was , in so many words, a dud.  The decor inside is really nice - muted greens, maroons, and blacks.  Fountains, faux bamboo bridges, fountains (I know, I wrote fountains twice... there were a lot of them.) etc...  It sets the scene well and is fun to wander around in, but it doesn't make up for the bad service, the bad chefs, and the flavorless, unenthusiastically served, overpriced food.  2 stars, and they are lucky to get that.",

We were out of water for longer than we wanted, and she was not the best with her communication skills in regards to understanding what we wanted. Her accent made it hard to understand her, but I'm not knocking her for this, simply the way it was.  Interior of the restaurant could have also been better - ate in many places in Vegas, many which were priced less than this, and were kept nicer on the inside.  Our chef was very good, however. If this review were only about him, he would get 5 stars. Skilled, personable, and delivered good food.  Anyways, overall \"OK\", but for the amount paid, I would have expected more. Would not return when there are so many alternatives on the strip that better this restaurant.",

    "text": "I have a friend who goes all the time to Benihana as it's her favorite place and I wanted to know what's so special. They do a $30 GC for your birthday if you sign up to their email so the BF and I decided to go.   When you enter, there is this dark \"garden\" they lead you through that is just beautiful. There is a lounge over looking it and there are seating areas and sushi bars around it but oddly none of it is being used..perhaps not on weekdays?. They lead us up an elevator to a teppan room that is pretty ordinary comparatively to the ambiance of downstairs so ambiance was a bit wasted.   They start you off with getting you out a soup, a salad with ginger miso dressing. They hand you 2 different sauces (hot sauce on request), cook zucchini and onions, shrimp appetizer and seafood items, then fried rice (extra. steam rice is what comes with your food), meat entrees and the guy did some mushrooms.I had the scallops, calamari, shrimps and BF got shrimp and chicken. Our food was cooked nicely, but it wasn't particularly special. The sauces were just okay, they needed more punch, it's just a bit bland and runny.   They have a efficient little planned out show and then the guy was gone. I was barely getting into our food and the guy just packed off and left. I was glancing at another table that just started their show and it was almost the same thing.  Service from the server helping the teppan guy was very personable and attentive though. Definitely top notch service and he even gave us some green tea ice cream and chatted with us a bit after dinner. I will give them that- excellent service. However, a bit sad that the server was more memorable than the teppan show!   I can't help compare them to Musashi, a local teppan place I've had great experiences at over and over. There is so much more they offer there and that really overshadowed my experience at Benihana. The show is lengthier, a bit more complex tricks, the jokes and stories are fantastic and each teppan person has their own unique style, a bit cheaper in price with a really awesome fried rice included, soup, salad, veggies and plenty of different flavorful sauces freshly made in front of you.   Glad I tried it, but will not be back. Even with the $30 birthday discount the bill was $70+ for two plus the tip. I went to Musashi a few months ago and spent $70 for two including a hefty tip! I had way more fun and better food.   Um yeah. This feels like a no brainer to where I'll be going to the next time I want a teppan experience to bring visiting friends and family to.",

The ambiance and atmosphere of this location is far more extraordinary compared to others. They have a huge bar, & dining area that makes you feel like you're seated outside underneath the stars.  Keep an eye out for their elevator inside, it'll come in handy after you stuff your face, & wash it down with some hot sake (stairs might be a little too risky). Awesome spot, wish the San Diego location was like this one.",

My only complaint is that there is no longer swordfish on the menu. After trying everything else on the menu ( short of the tofu ), this was my go to entree. I can't wait for my next chance to go enjoy some good filet mignon, shrimp, and a cool alcoholic beverage from the belly of a Buddha!!!!!!!!",

This was served with a basic soup broth, Benihana salad(which was very basic), hibachi vegetables (bell peppers and onion sauteed) and plain steamed rice. It somewhat reminded me of the Japanese version of Olive Garden? Not traditional Japanese food, and very underwhelming.   However a photographer employed by the restaurant took some very beautiful photos of us, and we will always treasure them! A great reminder of our trip!  Cocktails are a must!

The hotel where it is located is no longer the Las Vegas \"Hilton.\"  Today, the letters LVH now stand for the Las Vegas \"Hotel.\"  But, this elegant and happy eating place is still there, and the food is still terrific.  But, every great place sometimes has a \"negative,\" or two...  For example, one gets used to seeing a friendly, smiling Japanese male coming to your table, bowing deeply and speaking to you with a delightful, \"broken English\" Japanese accent (even if it is an \"act\").  Those days are gone, unfortunately, because Equal Employment Opportunity Laws in the USA mandate that ANYONE can cook your meal for you at your table, as I discovered when a non-Japanese person arrived with our food, a few years ago.  Personally, I don't really care about the gender and/or the race of the person cooking our food, but having a non-Japanese performing that task (and he did it FLAWLESSLY, by the way) is akin to having a non-Vulcan as a Science Officer aboard the USS Enterprise.  It's like meeting TARZAN in person, and discovering that he's not wearing a loincloth.  But, that aside, I urge you to patronize Benihana as often as you can, because the food really is meticulously prepared, and the staff are most cordial and professional.  I have no hesitation about recommending them, and I enjoy their cuisine, whenever possible.  All of the food preparers have a Black Belt in Cooking, regardless of ethnicity.",

This dish comes with shrimp, which is only half deveined= nothing on the top but a big ole vein of special shrimp surprise on the under.... ew. I gave this place a three for ambiance, theatrics and quality service. If it were rated on food alone, one and a half or a two at the most.They are very pricey for the quantity and quality of the food . My companion ordered the fried rice, for which they charge 5.99 . It was a small bowl and not at all worth the cost. Stingy there too.  I ordered a green tea, the ice tasted as if some one working a grill had handled it to put in my glass. It was gross. I didn't say anything, just ordered a sprite---- no ice...LOL. Waitress was nice. Gave me an extra set of chopsticks to take home. Keep in mind, they seat you family style so you sit with strangers. It was nice as we met some fun folks who didn't mind us either. This could be risky.... you know the crazy drunk best man or the unhappy bridesmaid in a Vegas trip gone bad situation...LOL",

I felt as though I had just stepped off a plane onto the island of Okinawa - just like Daniel LaRusso in Karate Kid 2! Being such a big fan of that movie franchise, I expected that if the restaurant looks a lot like a set from Mr. Miyagi's house in Okinawa in the front, that further into the building there may even be a fighting ring, not unlike the one Daniel-San has to fight in for the honor of his girlfriend Kumiko and house Miyagi. Yet around the corner, nobody was handing out those drums that you twist around in your hands. In fact, all that was back there is what I would normally expect from a teppenyaki restaurant. HIGHLY DISAPPOINTING.  The food and service were excellent and our chef was quite skilled at both presentation and preparation, but I couldn't help but wonder how much more amazing the night would've been if I had the opportunity to take a picture with a Pat Morita lookalike posing as Mr. Miyagi. Ultimately, I would still say go to this Benihana, but check your Karate Kid fantasy expectations at the feudal Japanese door.",

We had 8 people, and we have been changed 20% gratuity. Ok, I understand that. But our sever Lam, certainly don't deserve any penny of it. First of all, she is very rude when she talked to us. She offered to speak to us in another language, but she can hardly understand. And when my friend told her that our tea taste like soap, she said that is because we are not use to drinking \" American \" water, she said that's how their water taste like. Let's be honest, no matter where you from, water should never taste like soap. And I  ask if we can get another cup, she gave me a very dirty look and ignore me went straight to my friend. But we did have a great chef, chef Zhenxing was the best chef ever, he is very skillful and attentive, and also hilarious. I don't know how server and chef share tips, but I wish all the money that I left go to chef Zhenxing's pocket but not the rude lady Lam.",

They got one of our orders wrong and in the end, we had to remind them about our ice cream.  I love the Benihana's we have in Scottsdale, AZ.  This one.. not so much.",

I was disappointed because they charge a lot in the first place and it doesn't even include the noodles..that's an extra charge..also you can't just substitute the white rice for a fried rice for a few dollar charge like the other Benihana's I have been to. It's like an additional $8. So just ordering your spending like $45 a meal not $30 if you want the noodles which it should automatically come with for the price of the meal. And then a crazy amount for the fried rice which is the obviously the best. I have been to other Benihana's that included everything plus ice cream for way cheaper and tasted way better. The fried rice wasn't the greatest. The teriyaki chicken was very bland as well. I felt like I spent a lot and the quality wasn't the greatest. Will not return here.",

    "text": "I loved so many things about this restaurant but I have to give a 2 star rating because of some serious service issues. Quite simply, the employees rushed us to eat. It was TERRIBLE how badly they rushed us.   I had JUST gotten MY food (I had well done steak so I got my food last) and employees KEPT coming by asking if I \"needed a box.\" I was asked more than three times if I needed a box. It was obnoxious. Then one guy just brought a takeout box out and left it in front of me. I felt like crying. It made me so upset because I had literally gotten my food less than 2 minutes before. My food was still steaming hot and I had taken about 3 bites of food. I am not exaggerating!  Then, they came out with a birthday sundae for my husband WHEN WE BOTH STILL HAD MORE THAN HALF OUR FOOD ON OUR PLATES. His ice cream just sat on the table melting with no offer to replace it when we did finish eating nor any apologies. I was even MORE upset by that. His ice cream sundae turned into nothing but a bowl of melted \"soup\". We are NOT super slow eaters but since we were the last ones served at our table, we got screwed. It was unfair.   The trick is to order seafood only because they cook and serve that first so you can start eating while they cook the other stuff for everybody else. They at least give you the check when you are done so the other two parties sitting with us were able to leave, and we were the last ones at the table. Call me crazy, but when I'm dropping $100 on a dinner for two, I expect to savor my meal and not be rushed out the door.   The service made me NEVER want to go back there again.    The food was good though! We had chicken, shrimp and steak. We ordered a side of scallops (they were delicious) to share. The dinner came with a tiny bit of shrimp as an appetizer, some onion broth soup, a little salad, vegetables (onions and zucchini), a cup of hot green tea, and a scoop of ice cream. Well, forget the ice cream, we were served it so early that it was melted. The portion sizes are on the small side so if you are a big eater, I'd recommend ordering a few sides or an additional appetizer. The \"show\" was fun as well. It's so cool to watch your meal prepared right in front of your eyes. Your experience will differ based on your tablemates but we luckily had a fun and chatty table. Not a place to go if you are shy (or a slow eater).   My husband and I frequently entertain clients for work and based on this disastrous service, we will be crossing Benihana off both of our business and personal dining lists. It's a shame because it could've been such a fantastic experience.",

Although we are not a fan of Benihana we opted to go. Our server was a beautiful Asian lady that was very efficient. After I have my order, I informed her of the voucher. She took the voucher and later came back with the voucher cut out and informed me that they would give only 15% off! I said that wasn't what the voucher stated and she formula told me that was what I was getting!  I didn't want to make a scene but I felt that this establishment misappropriated the voucher to get the business! The meal was good bit long. The smell and the taste of the over powerful garlic butter was very lasting.  Plan to spend a lot of money remember it is Vegas and enjoy.",

It's just a process with the small show that they do so it takes a while for you to eat. I ordered the Benihana delight. That comes with shrimp and chicken. Everything seasoned really good.

Grill areas or the one we were in could use an upgrade. Steak and shrimp was good but chicken taste like it came out of a microwave but I know it wasn't because it was cooked in front of us.

The meal ($42) consisted of teriyaki steak with green onions and colossal shrimp. The appetizer consisted of shrimp, mushrooms, zucchini, onions, soup, salad and I upgraded my steamed rice to chicken fried rice (additional $8). When all was done, I was served delicious vanilla ice cream. The meal was rather pricey, but definitely worth the experience!",

They skimp on the vegetables and you get a much smaller portion of rice than you do at other restaurants of this type. I was really disappointed with my experience.  I reccomend you choose another hibachi style restaurant.  You will get better food for less money",

    "text": "It was my second time in Benihana at Westgate. One of our favorite menu for family night out is Teppanyaki. We usually go to Ohjah since it is near our house, and Geisha steakhouse as well. We had a late mother's day dinner here last Sunday, and left with no excitement at all.   Our server, Roger, was wonderful with a great smile and customer service. There was nothing that disappointed us from his point. However, when you come to a Teppanyaki restaurant at a hotel-even though we know its just Westgate- or even Benihana-which they call themselves the Originals- you expect more than local hibachi grills. Our chef, Paul, definitely had no sense of humor during the entire dinner. Unlike the server words where he said, enjoy your dinner and show, there was no showmanship at all for our hibachi. It seemed like none of the hibachi chefs around us were doing such a thing called show except for one. Honestly speaking, show is the main reason people go to Teppanyaki instead of just paying the same price for a steak.  In sense of quality, the meat was definitely better than other restaurants. We got the Hibachi Supreme, which comes with fresh lobster and chateaubriand, land and sea-filet and scallops, prime NY, and just chateaubriand. The chateaus were fabulous, they were tender, lean and they almost melted in your mouth. NY was great as well, the filet was a little tougher compared to the other ones but still great. We asked the chef to put less salt in our part of the meat, but he did not take that into consideration and put same amount of salt for all table's meats, which was a bit too salty for us.  The one thing that this place sucks, is that they charge 8 dollars extra for you to get fried rice. That kind of takes aways the whole fun of hibachi.   It was a good experience for us to compare different restaurants, but I hardly doubt I would bring anyone back here. You can get such a better show for hibachi at better prices, and get better steak at a nicer restaurant.",

    "text": "What a great evening at Benihana! My friend and I were attending a conference at the Westgate and chose to dine at Benihana one evening. The decor of this restaurant is absolutely gorgeous and inviting! As the conference was for photographers, we even heard several photographers comment, \"What a great place this would be for a photo shoot!\" The ambiance is exceptional!   We chose to enjoy the teppanyaki for dinner. We were seated at one of the upstairs teppan tables. As the hostess brought the other patrons to join us, There were two gals who had never experienced teppanyaki before. My friend and I convinced them that it's fun and that they would enjoy the whole experience.  There were a total of 8 people at the table. The waitress expertly took all of our orders and promptly brought the soup, followed by the salad. Before too long, our charming chef arrived and reviewed everybody's orders with them personally, assuring of their order and how they wished to have their items prepared.  The friendly banter among all of us seated at the table grew as we all became comfortable with the others. It was quite enjoyable and there was fun laughter and chatter as our chef prepared our meals.   Our chef was a genuine showman, as is to be expected at Benihana's and he did not disappoint. Not only were his \"moves\" expert, he also had just enough comedic character to enlist laughter from his diners.  The waitress continued to be expertly attentive, not leaving any single patron wanting for anything.  The food was better than good, everybody cleaned their plate without complaint and several exclamations of delight came from those at the table.  As the dinner time wound down, we all learned that one of our table-mates was celebrating his birthday. The waitress immediately jumped up to the plate, brought him ice cream with a candle and we all sang him a hearty Happy Birthday song!   After the checks had been distributed and paid, our waitress had a little time available to stand and chat with us. We all remained at the table and talked with her, learning that she was soon to be married! As she was approaching her senior years in life, we all were exceptionally happy that she had found this new joy in her life and all wished her the very best.  All in all it was an exceptional evening of enjoyment and sharing among people who's paths happened to cross unexpectedly and with hosts/hostesses that facilitated a perfect celebratory dinner.  Thank you, Benihana's!",

Each portion of our hibachi meal was extremely disappointing to us both. We had the hibachi steak. The onion soup was luke  warm at best and tasted old. The ginger dressing salad tasted wrong. Our fried rice was simply OK, the same with our steaks. All in all, a poor, overly priced dinner. We will not be returning. We've eaten at the Ohjah hibachi restaurants in town and found a much better quality hibachi style dinner at half the cost.",

It was my fiance's birthday (which I stated on the reservation)... one lady at my table had food allergies and no one told the waiter so they cooked her food and we had to sit and wait. By then our rice and veggies were cold. The waitress tried but she seemed very overwhelmed. We were there a total of three hours! Then all of a sudden it was as if they wanted to kick us out. Except they forgot that it was my fiance's birthday AND desert came with our meal. I asked for a bag for our food and they bought everyone back a bag EXCEPT US. I wasn't sure if we were being discriminated against or if it was just a mistake so.... I asked to speak to the manager (as did another party at our table). It took the \"manager\" 15 minutes to come to our table. She spoke w/the other party first telling them that all she could do was give a discount while waving her hands and seemingly very annoyed.   Once she got to me I told her that I did not want a discount I wanted to give feedback on the service because we spent quite a bit of money to be treated badly. She told me that she was not the manager and that I shouldn't give her the feedback because she wasn't going to do anything with it... color me SHOCKED. There's no manager? My feedback isn't valuable? By now our ice cream had melted and we still had no check. Finally we paid and I requested the managers card. Donna if you read this please note that Amy was truly rude and should not be in customer care.",

    "text": "I honestly have to redo my review on this business. My wife and I use to come here every year for our Anniversary, but on our 6th year of coming here, we noticed they stopped the free photo for special occasions, so to us it was no biggie, but the we also noticed the service went down hill.          When we arrived on October, 27th, 2016, we sat with a group who all agreed that during the meal the chef was polite, but the waitress failed in every area possible. She only came to fill up drinks once not twice or rechecking everyone's drinks, but once. She picked up a few empty first course meal plates and bowls once, the rest were left in one side of the table. Sitting with people whom we did not know, all looked at other tables just to see if they too had issues and sure enough they too were wanting refills and plates removed from the table to make more room          Now when stating more room, I mean imagine 8 to 9 people at a table, but your kind of squished together and you literally only have, so much room to move empty plates and cups. Before leaving I spoke with the manager telling her that the service was poor, but the meal was great and all she said was sorry no refunds lol. I never asked for a refund, never asked for a discount, and never once did I raise my voice or yell I just simply explained how our night went with this place and it use to be great.         Every waitress is different, but overall I I experienced way better service and respect from a manager in other high end restaurants than this place. We decided to bring our business elsewhere. Specially after being polite and trying to explain how the service could of been better. I even observed others from our table and other tables in the room trying to get the attention of the waitress and or a manager and despite all they just want your money.          Many may not agree or agree with my opinion and that's fine, but I am being straight up and honest about what took place with our service and noting how the manager can careless about service and expectations. I get that each table has 8 to 9 people or more sitting and needs service as well, but when someone is paying over 160 for two people for the last 6 years at the same place and now you out of nowhere drop the respect and services, yeah elsewhere is where we will go.",

I watched a family sit there watching us eat for well over an hour before the chef came out to start cooking for them. And it turns out the only reason the chef came out was because the customer got tired of waiting and went and complained that he's been waiting for over an hour to eat. Our experience wasn't much better. The chef seemed to be drunk or high he kept sending food flying at us left and right then spilled this little girls drink all over her plate of food. He even openly in front of us said butter makes you horny. For all of you who have been to Benihana it know they use a lot of butter in there cooking. Well the problem with this is that there was a little girl sitting there !! How awkward is that. Never again will I return to this location.",

    "text": "Behold the world's largest and fanciest Bennie's! This is the only Bennie's in Las Vegas so pay close attention -  Located inside of the old school Westgate Hotel, on the Casino floor, once you arrive you will be surprised by this unexpected restaurant oasis! If you choose to do self-parking, make sure to park closest to the \"Sports Book\" which will give you a straight forward, short walk to the restaurant.  This is the most luxurious location I have ever been to. They are boasted as the largest Bennie's in the world and designed to replicate a small indoor village! They have 2 stories, fitted with separate \"chef's table\" dining rooms and also lounges with access to gorgeous views of custom rooftops on faux buildings. Upon leaving the dining rooms, you're immersed in an indoor Japanese garden; the entire space is adorned with a variety of eye-catching props such as: dangling red lanterns, shutters, bridges and my favorite LED fireworks dancing on the backsplash of the town. They even go as far as incorporating a dramatic waterfall and a rock garden creek. It's truly a random casino getaway. So peaceful!  Alright, I'm going to go ahead and say it - I like Benihana's and I'm not embarrassed about it! I actually enjoy dining at the cliche \"chef's table\" and the food isn't as terrible as most people make it out to be! Granted, you have to know what to order and stick to it! Once you venture off to uncharted menu territory - you're on your own bland journey.  I'll give you tips based on trial and error: Stick to the steaks (New York or filet mignon) and the colossal shrimp is always winning! I always order the Splash & Meadow combo $39.50, it comes with a small grilled shrimp appetizer and also a small side of grilled sweet onion & zucchini. The combo also comes with a side salad with house miso dressing and an onion broth soup that is cooked for 6 hours - Intense! Make sure to get your steak medium, since it tends to come out well - but if you like your meat bloody like I do, ask for it rare and it will get to you medium (there's a small percentage of it actually getting to you rare.) *shrugs* - don't forget to add a chicken & egg fried rice for $6. The fried rice is super simple but the garlic butter they use could make a boot taste amazing - I love the fried rice! $6 is expensive for a small bowl, but it makes me happy! If you're ballsy, demand that the chef add more butter! I'm sure the rest of the table won't mind. More is more!  Don't bother with the hibachi chicken combos or sushi! I've had both and they are extremely disappointing. The spicy chicken hibachi combo for $25.95 looked pretty good, but the spicy sauce is bland and the chicken is somehow always overcooked to smithereens and dry as cardboard. The sushi is lacking thought; I recall the rolls having lots of rice and being horribly dry!  If you like it saucy like I do, make sure to get extra miso salad dressing on the side and use that as a dip for your steak and shrimp - delicious! It's so much better than their other 2 standard dipping sauces. Also for the spice advocates, ask for a side of the diablo sauce which is their house spicy mayo with a real kick! I love dabbing a little bit on my protein, it wakes up all of the flavors wonderfully!  They will forever do the same onion volcano, train, shrimp and heart fried rice trick; True, the hibachi show may be played out, but I always get a kick out of it and think about Chris Farley as a Hibachi Chef in Beverly Hills Ninja! Freaking hilarious! THE BEST MOVIE SCENE ever!  <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DraIdZiSZ970&s=df3e11fa797f788ca0471b7533217f19727dfed02ab211dd12fb52e92cb9add9\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">youtube.com/watch?v=raId...</a>  Sure, the chef's table is always crammed and it's totally awkward sitting with a table full of strangers - but it's Vegas! Why not spark conversation with people from all around the world - don't be shy! It's fun learning about where people are from, their Vegas itinerary, and also partaking in other bizarre topics of discussion. Don't be that guy whose face planted in his (delicious) fried rice and not a smile to be seen even when everyone is having fun and engaging him! Yeah. That guy? He's having a terrible time AND he sucks.  PRO TIP: sign up for their email club to get your $30 birthday credit! Not to sound like a cheapo or anything, but that's the only way to dine here! It also comes with a complimentary birthday ice-cream and if you're lucky, maybe even a cringing birthday song dedicated to you from your table companions!",

    "text": "Ok, it's Benihana, so you know what to expect. I'm not a huge fan of teppanyaki generally but my fella happens to love it and when I mentioned that Benihana offers a $30 birthday coupon, he told me to sign him up, and what my baby wants, my baby gets.   We came here the evening before his birthday and they took our picture and printed it out for us as a birthday present. We were seated quickly and luckily the place was pretty busy for a Tuesday, so we didn't have to wait long to get the show on the road. My fella got the steak and shrimp and I opted for the spicy chicken hibachi. The prices are much higher than most other teppanyaki places. You can't find anything for less than $25 and most are around $40 if you want anything including steak. Fried rice is also extra.   Our chef was friendly, but it's hard not to notice that pretty much everything he said was scripted. The chef behind him was about 15 minutes behind our table and I heard everything our chef said repeated by the other chef. It was still fun and entertaining, but I've seen better. The food was just ok as well. The steak was a little overcooked and underseasoned, but still tasty. My chicken was nice and spicy, which I enjoyed quite a bit.   They brought out ice cream to everyone at our table, well everyone but me, since they forgot mine, but since I didn't really like the ice cream I tasted from my fella's dish, I didn't bother asking for one for myself. They even included whipped cream, chocolate sauce and a candle for all the people celebrating birthdays.  Overall, it's worth a visit if you have your birthday coupon, but there are plenty of other teppanyaki places that are better and cheaper in town, if you don't.",

    "text": "My friend that I went to Vegas was craving teppan and I thought yummmm not a bad idea at all. So on our way to meeting our other friend we asked the cab driver if he could recommend a good teppan place. Why was I not surprised when he said Benihana... now we just had to talk our other friend into going... Agreed Benihana's it was. When we got there the ambiance was very nice seeing the waterfall then they walk you to the elevator and up you go and then the hostess is there to receive you.   Up until now still excited about dining here... Then here comes our server nice in a sarcastic way... I can't really explain the interaction but it wasn't that great. The bloody mary I ordered had all kinds of pulp in it so it wouldn't come through the straw and I had to keep picking the pieces out.... The soup and salad combo wasn't good the soup was very grimy and the salad didn't taste well with the usual dressing. Then we had to order I had the lobster and chicken combo and my friend ordered shrimp and gave some to me. The food was not that great and I forgot about that mustard sauce I used to like it this time it was like eating horse radish. I still did like the ginger sauce. I was full I just remember leaving disappointed.  On to the show the chef we had didn't really speak english but then again he didn't really speak at all. It was like he was just going through the motions because he does this 100x a day. No emotion or excitement to engage us and for it being in Vegas I guess I just expected a little more. I don't think I will be coming back to this location to eat again when visiting Vegas",

After bringing Sprite and trying to convince us it was the Lemonade I ordered, our server forgot to bring silverware after I requested twice. He also forgot my rice, and the cook cut up everyone else's meat except mine. The reason why I gave it more then 1 star was because the food quality was decent. I had the Benihana Special which was a combo of Lobster and Steak.  Finally on my way out after waiting 2 minutes for the elevator, which had stopped working sometime over dinner, I had to take the steps.",

My meat was on the salty side, but everything else lacked flavor. It seems that the cook was trained to cook a certain way, as I look around and they're all doing the same thing. I would probably not come here again for the food.    Service was decent. Our waitress came over a few times to check up on us.

    "text": "I have been to Benihana many times over the years. Beverly Hills, San Diego etc.... I read a bunch of negative online reviews about the location in Vegas. The fact that my wife and I share very close birthdays brought us to the Vegas Benihana. They gave us a $30 credit EACH. $60 bucks! I have enjoyed my experiences in the past so I figured, how bad could a Benihana be? Especially with a $60 credit!   This location is the nicest I have seen. Gorgeous. Trees, waterfalls, elevators....When we checked in at the front desk, they took a birthday photo of us. I thought, oh here it comes, they will want $20 for the picture. Nope! They handed us a free birthday photo! How cool is that! I also expected the food pricing to be higher than any other Benihana as stated in other reviews. It was not.   This is NOT an inexpensive place and some would say you are being over charged, but it is a Benihana. You are paying MORE for the experience of knives and food flying dangerously close to your face.   I had 2 drinks and the wife had one. We had the Teriyaki steak and the Filet Mignon. The cost was less than I have spent at most steakhouses. ESPECIALLY with the $60 credit! (THANK YOU BENIHANA for the birthday gift! More than I can say for my buddy Bob. Wait, did I just say that? Sorry Bob, I am kidding)  Look, this place is a Benihana. No more, no less. All the negative reviews seem strange to me. Not sure what they were expecting. Every single cook was actually Japanese! Felt very authentic. Super friendly staff and very attentive. If you are on the fence, don't be. Just go with friends and have a good time. They have $8.95 drinks! Go most places and you are lucky to pay less than $12!   The only real negative is the seating arrangement. Unless you go with a group of friends that fill up the seats, they seat you with strangers. Kinda like a Club Med Benihana experience. Cool for Club Med, not cool for dinner in Vegas unless you are in that type of \"wanna meet new people\" mood. I was not.",

Then it took an hour and a half for the chef to finally come and cook for us! We were there for 3 hours! There was a photographer who took our pictures and at then end of dinner when she came back around to show us the pics to see if we wanted to buy any she was able to sell us on one pic. She walked away with a salty attitude and told us in a very short way \"thanks, have a great day.\" Listen people are here to have dinner not to be bothered with some photographer trying to sell us on something else. Menu says $35 for an entree and $5 extra for a side of fried rice. Rice came in a small rice bowl. Then we quickly found that if you wanted to split an entree you had to pay an extra $10. This place is is ridiculously expensive. The food is good but my money has been better spent on better food and better service with better prices. I will never go back to any benihanas. It is such a rip off!! Money hungry restaurants who only care about making money off of you instead of providing quality service so that you will come back! Ridiculous!",

The only other place I've had benihana was in minnesota... which was nearly 5 years ago :)   Honestly, this place didn't measure up.  For the value, you certainly don't get your moneys worth of food. Though the chicken, steak, shrimp, etc were all excellent, it would've been 100x better with shrimp sauce lol, anyone who's had this sauce know what im talking abou!.

The onion soup- yech. The steamed rice- pretty awful (and there is an art to rice that Benihana should have learned) and finally, if I myself took some chicken, sauteed it with butter and poured sesame seeds over the top it would taste MUCH better and cost WAY lest than the 49.50 that my client had to pay.  PS If someone doesn't eat red meat- can you please not put their chicken next to a bloody piece of steak cooking on the grill?  Could you perhaps use a different knife?  The whole thing was gross.  Stay away. It's not that it's bad- it's just not good.",

    "text": "Not the biggest fan of Benihana normally but the cook at this particular location the night we went was awesome. He was clever, funny and had plenty of tricks up his sleeve. Sadly, we got stuck at a table with a bunch of rude, hungover and complaining college kids. It took everything in me not to reach over and smack them haha. I felt bad for our cook having to deal with them but he made the best of it and didn't let them faze him. I wish I could remember his name! The location itself is terrible. Inside the LVH (formerly the Hilton), a place that has absolutely no reason for anyone to visit other than possibly going to Benihana. I feel like they would do so much better if they moved to the strip. It's a pretty wild atmosphere when you walk in downstairs with a waterfall and everything. Got us excited until they bring you upstairs to this small boring room where you actually eat. The server was friendly and the food was typical Benihana quality. Only reason we go here is because of the $30 Birthday gift card they send out. It's very cool that they do that!!",

Silly knife show aside, all of the freshly cooked veggies, fish and meats were superior, if expensive.    It killed me to watch our tablemates have the chef cook amazing filets, NY strip steaks and chateaubriand to death - medium well on the grill.  To do this, the chef had to cut 4 inch slabs of prime meat into little pieces of overcooked morsels the size of dog food.    Our shrimp, scallops, and steak were in fact fabulous.  My only gripe is that even with LVH cards, we got no discount.  It is not right to charge extra just because we are visitorsvrather than locals.",

    "text": "I'm absolutely torn about this review. Benihana here has every last thing I want from a teppanyaki restaurant with one exception and that one exception was heart-rending.  My friend and I were seated on a Saturday evening with no reservations and no wait. The menu? Full of good choices. Then I see it. Singapore Sling, right on the drink menu. They made it the right way. Considering what is actually in a Singapore Sling, that is painfully uncommon. So even before the show and food, I'm already pleased.  I order the spicy chicken and much to my surprise, it is properly spicy. There's no overcompensating flavorless spice, nor is it a sauce that has a faint hint of heat. It was as spicy as it should be. It was a case of mass market appeal done right. If you're wondering about the soup and salad beforehand, I skipped the salad and the soup was pretty good but really just the standard for teppanyaki restaurants.  Like Jose G, I had the pleasure of Tuan as chef. He kept up a stream of wisecracks and terrible puns that had everyone chuckling through the performance. Definitely has the comedic chef routine down well and he read his audience just right.  So, the drink is five stars, the food is five stars, the chef is five stars, what could possibly be so tragic as to mar this otherwise amazing experience? Getting a drink refill was irritatingly difficult. Only halfway through the meal did I manage to catch the waitress. I say catch as she was clearly about to pass right on by. I wouldn't say she was unfriendly, just sadly inattentive.  Next time I'm in Vegas, I'll almost certainly drop by here again even if I don't stay at the LVH. I'll just have to be extra vigilant about getting that second drink before I'm halfway done. I wish I had the opportunity for a second try before giving this review, just in case it was one streak of bad luck. I hate to hold back a star for something that in the grand scheme of dinner is not a huge deal, but I just don't find nearly enough places that can serve a proper Singapore Sling and being deprived of such for so long instills me with a sense of saudade and woe.  Seriously though. Tuan rocked that grill. If you think I enjoy loquacious diatribes, you haven't seen my love for horrid puns. I don't know if Benihana actually earned the fifth star, but Tuan did and he works there so they can show it off too.",

Normally I am usually \"meh\" when it comes to Benihana, along with my wallet getting very noticeably skinnier because of it being so damn expensive... but it's Vegas baby!    And... because it's Vegas, if you don't have a reservation expect a looooooong wait.  Especially if you just show up on a Saturday night, like we did.  (Hey, we're spontaneous.)  Actually what happened, we were playing Blackjack at the New York-New York all day and befriended some fellow players who told us they were going to Benihana and just like the Guinness commercial, \"Brilliant!\" was the response that came in my head.    Anyway... so yeah, our wait was close to 2 hours without that reservation, which was ok because the casino is not too far and we played Blackjack, won some money, got some free drinks, all good stuff.  No need to get into any other details - it is Benihana, after all.  The food was all spot on, the meat cooked perfectly, great table entertainment, awesome service.
