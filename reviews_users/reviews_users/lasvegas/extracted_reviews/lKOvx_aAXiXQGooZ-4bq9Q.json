    "text": "We gave Pin Kaow another shot, mainly due to Lotus of Siam being closed for lunch on the weekends. Disappointing yet again, and this may very well have been the last time we went here. We had the Tom Yum Koong hotpot, which was fine except for the shrimp being terribly overcooked. We had two of the \"Chef's Specialities\", The Shrimp & Silver Noodles Claypot and the \"Gulf of Thailand\" seafood mix. The noodles were all caked together into a solid mess, the shrimp were just as overcooked as in the hotpot, and the bacon on the bottom consisted of globs of fat and bits of meat hard a shoe leather. The whole dish was very greasy.  The \"Gulf of Thailand\" must have recently suffered a massive oil spill, because the dish was greasy beyond belief. Shrimp, you guessed it, terrible overcooked. Are they using pre-cooked shrimp here and toss them into the dishes to reheat them ? The scallops were mushy and fishy.  Soup, two entrees, tea came out to over 50 bucks. Ridiculous, given the food \"quality\". I can't for the life of me understand why readers vote this place over Lotus of Siam for \"Best of Las Vegas\". At least our visit reminded us why we rather drive an hour round trip to Lotus of Siam than to visit this place three blocks from our house.",

Very Very Very good food!  The kids love the sweet and sour chicken as well as the chicken pad thai.  Update July 2012 My husband and I both feel that the quality seems to be going down lately.  Service isn't fabulous anymore, food portions are getting much smaller and the spiciness of food is very inconsistent.  Sometimes it's great though.  Seems to be very hit or miss lately.  We love this place and do hope it will return to it's earlier greatness.  Update January 2013 After trying several Thai restaurants in the Henderson area and disliking them very much we ended up going back to Pin Kaow.  I do believe the service has gotten better since my last review and the portions seem to have increased a bit.  I do love their Pad Thai and can't seem to find anything like it.  I'm going back to 4 stars!",

The hostess came right up and greeted us and sat us at a booth. Then we waited... And waited... And waited. My boyfriend could see servers walking by yet no one came over. After sitting there for at least 10 minutes, we saw another couple walk in. The hostess immediately greeted them. Extremely frustrated, we walked out.  It is a shame, the food is good but the service was ridiculous!",

As we started to reach the end of the meal, my boyfriend noticed a piece of chicken on his plate that looked completely raw.

Days earlier we found out that we were expecting our very first child!! Thai sounded good, and based on recommendations from some local friends, we were off to Pin Kaow.  The atmosphere and ambiance were spot on. It was very nicely decorated, and very clean (which is one of the most important things for me when I go out-- I want to feel comfortable and at ease). The presentation of the food was lovely.  We ordered curry, steamed rice, and some (delicious) Pad See Ew. I haven't had very much Thai food before, but this was by far the best we'd had. The service was friendly and attentive. My water glass was NEVER empty which is a HUGE plus.  It was a great experience, and once the wife gets over her morning sickness, we'll head back!  EDIT: I went back for the 2nd time just recently (my wife has finally gotten over her morning sickness) and was super impressed about how I never saw the bottom of my water glass. It was constantly being refilled. LOVE THIS!",

    "text": "Let me first disclose that I don't really eat Thai food, mostly because it is full of sugar and I just don't have an adventurous palate outside of Pad Thai.   I also absolutely hate the flavor of curries.  And yes, I won't eat Indian food or other related food either.  Sorry don't hate me yelpers!  But this low review is mainly because this restaurant seems to have problems with just cooking basics.  I don't know why but I was in the mood for good pad thai outside of Chinese delivery, and Pin Kaow 3 delivers to my area after 5pm.  So I got for myself and my husband the following:    -Shrimp and Tofu Pad Thai  -Stuffed Chicken Wings  -Beef Jerky (One sun beef) -Mee krob -Beef noodle soup  The pad thai and beef jerky were very good and cooked well.  My husband enjoyed the soup.  However, the stuffed chicken wings were overcooked so much they were practically petrified.  When I bit into one, I couldn't tell which was chicken and which was the stuffing, so I threw it away.  Really awful!  The Mee krob was all sweetness and no counterbalance of acid, and hardly any protein.  It was just too overwhelming so I also threw it away.  I don't think I'd order delivery again but I would do take-out just for the pad thai.",

They check-up just enough so you feel remembered, but not pestered.   Food here is just like Grandma's :)   Cucumber salad and papaya salad (youre not supposed to eat the crabs, just suck on them for their saltiness, not too much of a fan) are good appetizers. If you're looking for soup rather than salad for appetizers, the Tom ga kai soup is my faveee, and they make it well here.  For entrees I usually get Red or Green Curry. Yummm. I have found that the red curry is spicier than green when ordered on the same scale.  My last visit, I stepped away from getting my usual curries, and got the ground chicken larb salad. It was just as I had expected, almost as good as grandma's ;]. I recommend this dish, I think people stay away from food that they don't know... but larb is ground meet of your choice. Thai basil and cilantro really dominate the dish, along with this it has the standards of onions, and fish sauce. With the ground meat, you put it in cabbage wraps.. mmm. So, you can call it a variant of lettuce wraps.   My only complaint is the lack of rice they give for the curry... There is so much broth for this and i like to have my curry and rice well proportioned, but they dont provide you enough... I know how the asians hate wasting!! But I dont think it would go to waste if they just gave another scoop.   I have tried tmy friend's pad thais, pad see ews, and other noodle dishes. I am not too fond of getting these here because I feel that I can get these in chinese take out!  My recent discovery is on Sunday nights they have traditional Thai music, which is relaxing, and dancing performances that are nice to watch. Stop by this place, despite the negative reviews.. try it for yourself:]",

My wife is not into Asian or Thai but she loves this place. She loves the dumpling soups. You cannot not go wrong with all of the dishes at this restaurant.

    "text": "My sister recommended this restaurant saying it's as \"real\" as you can get. So we had dinner there. Parking outside is packed always took us about 15 mins to find a spot (it's in a new center). The outside of the restaurant is very cute, has string lights all outside and when you go inside it is so adorable. Dim lighting and private seating perfect for a date or any occasion. The hostess seated us right away and grab us or drinks. It was happy hour and the food on there was 3.99 so we had crispy green beans, crab rangoons, chicken wings. All amazing, crab rangoons we're very \"cream cheesy\" (that's how I like them) so just beware. Green beans were super yummy. One of the best I've ever had! And the chicken wings were really good too. For the main course we have the yellow curry and we shared it between 2 people and their portions are pretty big! It was so good and so creamy also probably the best curry I've had too! The best part? For 2 people our bill was 25.00 including drinks on the happy hour menu. I mean amazing food and awesome prices at happy hour (5-7)",

I got a pad Thai which is my favorite noodle dish for any Thai place. I got a level 7 for spice and it was not at all spicy... more sweet than spice. 12.95 for a bowl of rice size amount.  Service was good the waitress greeted us quickly and got us out of there quickly since we were kind of on a time crunch as well. Friends got a pumpkin curry special and another kind of curry which I forgot what kind. I just expect SPICY from a Thai restaurant but it seems adjusted here for the Americanized mouths ahahha less spice.",

They both came out immediately. For our entree we order the Yellow chicken curry and the pineapple fried rice. When they came out the fried rice was in an actual pineapple!!!

The top off was when I saw they charged me $2 extra for the brown rice! Somehow the waiter had failed to mention that, and when I complained, I got lip service. They did not take it off the bill.

    "text": "I had the pleasure of dining here for a fun ladies night with Lisa L. and future yelper Theresa. While the company got 5 stars in this review I'll stick to the food . I had had takeout from here prior to this dinner a couple times. I know people rave about Pin Kaow but I do prefer Archi's & Lotus. I think if this was the only Thai show in town mb It would be getting a 4 star, but in comparison I think Pin Kaow falls short.   Things I've had at Pin Kaow for takeout: *Duck fried rice - yummy, but probably only an ounce of edible duck meat. The rest was all grisel/fat. So that blew. *Mongolian beef - only my nutty husband would order this at a Thai place ! Yup, not good at ALL. I can't fault them for this, I fault my husband for ordering it ! *Pad see ew - my favorite thai dish of all time. Archi's and Lotus are way better. The issue I have with Pin Kaow is their noodles are hella bland. I want some of that dark sauce deliciousness in my noodles!  Dinner with Lisa L! *papaya salad with \"crab\". Ok the crab wasn't edible it was tiny weird slivers of crab shell. It was insanely spicy at a level 5. *Duck/mint - really tasty, however I thought the portion was kinda stingy for $15 or so. I could get WAY more duck at say Satay or Joyful House for that kinda price.  *Curry - So Lisa ordered the curry as a 7/10 and I decided to be brave and try it despite the fact I don't do spicy. UMM it wasn't spicy at all?!? I know spice is subjective but if this spice-fearing woman can down a 7/10 at a thai restaurant your scale is messed up, sorry! *Mango/sticky rice - So glad Lisa shares my love of this so we were able to get one to share! Beautiful presentation and flawless execution.  Atmosphere is decent, service is decent, but overall the only reason I frequent this place is the location. I wish we had better Thai on this side of town, but sadly we don't. Archi's and Lotus are worth the drive to me 9 times out of 10!",

We called out to the waitresses and waiters about 3-4 times yet none of them \"heard\" us.. Another table also didn't receive water until 30 min after being seated! There is a lot of patience I have as a person but over an hour an a half for some \"wonderful\" food. I cannot.. So! If you like Thai and don't mind waiting foreverrrrr then here is the place to go (: & if not? Make sure to have bunches and bunches of patience. (Btw. As a girl the only thing that frustrated me less? Was the hand scrubs in the BR. Lol.)",

Mediocre at best. Take out service = 1 star or ZERO if Yelp's rating had \"zero\"!    When the order was taken over the phone, we were told it would be ready in 15 min.  We even arrived nearly a half an hour after our order was placed.   AND when we got there we still waited another  ~25min.  Why tell people the food will be ready at a certain time... and then make them wait longer than ~10min??? The hostess smiled and blamed the soup for taking so long... well she should have told us it would be ready in ~45min and not in ~15.  My brother did say they apologized for the wait.  Well thankfully I don't live in Vegas, so I won't have to experience this again any time soon.",

We are then told by the manager that they had a new computer system and our order didn't go through. Understandable. However, If you are going to lie to your customer, then make sure your servers are in on it. The waitress then tells us that our order wasn't put in at all until we brought it to their attention that we were still waiting.  The manager proceeds to apologize and tell us all she can do is give us 10% off. So they took off the tax for food that I now have to eat cold either at work or home for dinner because we are on a lunch break. Obviously we were upset, so the manager brings pints of coconut ice cream for us which she tells us is \"normally $10\". If you can give us $20 of ice cream for free, why not just comp the $30 meal all together or even just the $10 appetizer which ended up being our lunch. $3 off for bad service and cold food.  I will not be returning. I also will no longer recommend Pin Kaow to ANYONE.  I hear there is an Archie's opening one strip mall over, you can find me there.",

The service is quick and friendly and the atmosphere is relaxed with half tone lighting and its dark wood tones with rich carved accents.  They have a compilation of booths and tables to accommodate any size party. They also have an outdoor patio when the weather allows which has plants, misters and a relaxing water feature. Nice place to hang out with a group of friends and take time to enjoy each others company and catch up. They have a happy hour each afternoon with drink and food specials. The bar is fully stocked and I have never ordered a drink they could not fulfill.   We order nearly the same meal each time we come and have it served family style. They have always been very helpful in customizing an order for spiciness level and personal likes / dislikes. We order:  War Wonton Soup Hotpot - $10.95 Combination Fried Rice - $14.95 Lemon Chicken - $10.95 Spicy Basil with Pork - $10.95 Green Curry w chicken - $11.95 Pad See Ew w chicken - $10.95  This comfortably feeds my family of four (2 HUNGRY teenage boys, one hardworking husband and me) ....

The aroma of pumpkin is more than obvious when it hit the table but upon the first forkful it enlivens the senses. It was all over the palate but not overwhelming, taunting the nose and blending well with the texture of rice and vegetables. I almost used a straw to get it all from the dish but restrained. A seasonal item so get it while you can",

I love the yellow curry here, the perfect blend of spice and sweet from the cocnut milk. The sauce is a little thicker almost to gravy status and not super runny like other places I have tried. The pineapple fried rice is another great dish. The combination of sweet from the pineapple along with the peanuts, shrimp and rice is amazing. Come check this place out and I promise you won't be disappointed.",

Yellow curry with chicken, Spice lvl 7: 10.95 for $37   - An amazing venue. Pin Kaow does an excellent job of creating an authentic theme. Although, the Michael Buble music in the background didn't help, it was fine.  - We were seated right away and serviced very quickly. Nutcha and Max were our servers. - Service was pleasant. We got our drinks and dishes relatively quickly on a busy Saturday night. - The flavoring of the Yellow curry was creamy. Chicken was tender. The only disappoint was that there seemed to be more potatoes than chicken. haha.  - We had an option to chose whether our tofu with the pad thai could be soft or fried. The pad thai was good. Definite recommendation. Better than in Krung Siam in chinatown.  - The spicy mint beef was a letdown. dry, not too flavored. I had to request a spice rack to give it a bit more zest. haha. Another thai restaurant that I have been too makes the same dish but also with tofu at a cheaper price and taste better, so this caught us off guard.  - For similar pricing and nearby, I'd rather dine a Gaati Thai simply bc it tasted a bit better. This place is nice for dates.",

It's definitely one of the fancier looking Thai restaurants I've been to in Henderson but it also is one of the more expensive ones.   The regular menu seemed kind of pricy but I got the pad thai lunch deal for $8 which came with either soup and salad/fried wonton. The soup of the day was chicken soup filled with some rice which might seem a bit weird - I didn't mind the rice myself but I know some friends who did. The lunch portions were on the smaller side and the Pad Thai itself was just mediocre. Nothing about it really stood out to me but it was passable enough.   I came with about 25 friends and the staff seemed a bit overwhelmed at first. What was nice was that they were willing to split the bill for each individual so that saved us lots of time in the end!  Overall, my experience here was alright but I don't think I'll be back since there's tastier, cheaper Thai lunch deals around the area!",

We were diligent in picking out the shreds of bird's eye chili. -Tom Yum Goong:  We ordered a 6 out of 10, but it was not as spicy as the Papaya Salad...it was perfect.  When it arrived at our table, I fished out 8 pcs of medium to large size shrimps out  and put them on a small plate.  I realized I do not like overcooked shrimps.  Fishing them out will stop the cooking process.  The soup by far is my favorite. -Crab Fried Rice: The most delicious crab fried rice, out of all other Thai places that I have tried.  There are lumps of crab meat in this mix.  So good!  At the end of the meal, they bring out a small plate of orange wedges.    The server wasn't very attentive.  She wasn't so friendly either...but the food is good!",

    "text": "This is my 2nd time coming here this week. The first time was for lunch. I got the chicken pad Thai with no peanuts. The first time the waitress brought it out to me, it had nuts, so she took it back. The second time, it came out with no nuts...and it was pretty good until the end, when I discovered a few nuts at the bottom of the dish :(  Today, I came for takeout. I got the duck fried rice, Tom-Ka-Kai, and the spicy basil with chicken. The duck fried rice was good, but didn't have much duck meat. It had mostly the fatty skin of the duck, with little meat. The Tom-Ka-Kai had really good flavor, but had WAY too much inedible stuff in it (like the galangal root, lemongrass, bay leaves, etc). Most of my bowl was full of stuff I couldn't eat, so I had to kind of slurp around it.  The spicy basil was decent. Nothing to write home about. Not sure if I will be back, I might try a couple of other Thai places around here to see if they are any better. **p.s. I walked in to place my take out order...the girl who took my order has great customer service skills!",

    "text": "I had a working lunch here.  I love the decor and it was very quiet and after the usual lunch crowd.  It was a nice place to go over my contracts.  I had Chicken Broccoli and a side salad as a Lunch Special. First they brought me out a really nice soup.  I was surprised the sauce on the Chicken Broccoli was not very thick.  I am not sure if that  is how it is supposed to be or not. The dish was very fresh and healthy.  I love the aroma of the tea, I should have asked what it was.  The tea tab was not in English.    I visited the restroom before I left and I love the fact it was so clean and finished with high quality tiles and counters.  There was even a free salt scrub for your hands and I love the smell of that.  It is the little things that mean so much.  This restaurant rocks it for me in terms of the food, the service, the decor, the cleanliness and friendliness of the servers.  I have been here a few times before before I became a YELPER and those experiences were also just as wonderful.  I like the Pineapple Fried Rice, the War Wonton Soup and you must try the Asian Pear Martini with an orchid in it.  What could be more decadent?",

With growling stomachs and anticipation for family style dishes, we were quite disappointed with the small portions attached to a beefy price tag.  3 adults ordering 3 entrees, couldn't you have been a bit more generous with the rice rather than giving us one tiny saucer that cant even feed a 5lb alley cat?? Its like ordering a big mac with half the top of a bun. It was a good thing I ordered brown rice (dry)  in which they forgot and charged $3 a cup.   Our somewhat irritating experience didn't help when the manager came over to our table and showed concerns we were bringing in boba drinks but she let it slide. I didn't see eye to eye with her concerns as we were there to dine in and spend a nice amount for dinner. We aren't there to order water and occupy your wifi connection lady.  The food is good, but it isn't anything different than the ASIAN BISTRO section at the buffets. Pin Kaow may have the fancy marble floors, but asians needs their rice!",

They do try to rush you out of the restaurant at the end of the meal though. Recently, my friends and I wanted some Thai food on St. Patrick's Day and it was surprisingly one of the only ones open later into the evening. We tried a couple others on the neighborhood but they all closed early. Who knew St. Patty's would affect a Thai restaurant!",

Their food has always tasted great and the wait staff was always attentive. However as years go by the portion sizes became smaller and the prices increase. I've visited this location twice this month. One early afternoon for happy hour and was seated immediately however the food arrived 45 mins after it was placed. On tonight's visit our table ordered four entrees and only two showed up. We thought it would arrive immediately after however twenty minutes passed and it took waving down two servers in order for us to get the rest of our meal. The manager took our order and never checked on us to see if we received our entire meal, it was later another wait staff would check on us after receiving the missing entrees. Sad to say a favored spot will no longer be my go to Thai restaurant.",

I knew there was only one place we could go that was close to both of us and offered a really great menu.  Yes, Pin Kaow!!  This place is located in a HUGE strip mall along with other great places like BJs.  The restaurant is dark with lots of wood: blinds, walls, counter space, you name it. The smell of incense fills the air and the bar is a dramatic focal point with a mock roof top. The place is filled with wooden sculptures of koi fish, lots of Thai tribal designs on the wall and between the booths, all of it is super cool. Servers are dressed in authentic Thai outfits with lots of light orange and green colors.  I thought they were super nice and always checked on our table frequently.  I also liked how everyone pitched in.  Our drink order was taken by one server.  Our food order was taken by another.  Other servers would come by the check on us and I thought that was cool.    On this visit, although it was during my lunch break, I got a glass of the Altanuta Pinot Grigio for $8.95. I thought it was light and crisp, the way Grigio should taste like.  For my lunch, I got the lunch special chicken Pad Thai with a Thai salad for $8.95. The Pad Thai was awesome.  I got a number 4 in the spicy range.  The rice noodles were accompanied with fresh bean sprouts and crushed peanut in Thai special recipe sauce. The salad components were romaine and shredded carrots, super typical.  What I really liked was the Thai vinaigrette dressing.  I made the salad refreshing and flavorful.    Such great company and great food.  Definitely want to check out Pin Kaow if you ever have a Thai craving.  There's three locations around the valley.  This location is the only location I've been too, but I love it!  Super convenient, great staff and food that's YUM-O!",

The food - Still overall very decent, just not totally great. The food is nice and tasty and I like there spices overall. However, after trying so many Thai restaurants in the valley, I want to be wowed and the food here did not wow me.  2.  The service - I felt kind of like I was bothering them or it was very special for me to be eating here.  Very odd.  3.  The Ambiance -  If you want to have a large party, a quality environment, this is the place.  The decor is excellent, they have plenty of large tables and for most, it will suit the needs of parties of a variety of sizes.  I still say check it out, and it is a decent place to try for sure.",

    "text": "I have seen Pin Kaow several times while in the shopping plaza and we decided to stop in for lunch. As soon as we walked in we smelled the insense and noticed the Thai style decor, a very Thai experience. We were greeted quickly and sat in a booth near the bar.   The server gave us the lunch specials menu which offered 10 different dishes including typical Thai dishes of pad thai, red curry, thai salad as well as some chinese dishes of sweet & sour, chow mien and fried rice. It was a nice variety and had several vegetarian dishes as well.   We chose the chicken pad thai and chicken red curry. The lunch specials come with soup of the day which was chicken egg drop. The soup and drinks came out quickly. The egg drop soup was excellent, some of the best I have had and adding chicken was a nice touch.   After my second spoonful, the lunch entrees arrived. If your on your lunch hour and in a hurry this would have been fine, but we were not. I hate to complain that food came out too fast, but it really did. I didn't get to enjoy my soup and felt rushed.   The pad Thai came with an egg roll and fried wonton and the red curry came with fried rice. The spiciness was perfect for both of our dishes and the flavors were great. We were both happy with the food. Pin Kaow has a great selection of desserts as well. They have sticky rice and mango as well as a selection of home made ice creams, of which I chose coconut. I thought it was okay, nothing special though.   Overall we enjoyed the food and Pin Kaow but we felt a little rushed with the food coming out so fast. If your in a hurry though you will appreciate it! Definitely a place I would return to when craving Thai.",

I prefer the fried rice (shrimp or pork) that allows you to pick a spiciness level from 1-10. I usually go pretty bold in the seven range. My favorite soup is the cucumber and chicken served on Thursdays. My wife loves the red curry usually at a medium five on the Pin Kaow kelvin scale! The thai tea is also exceptionally tasty. I highly recommend the Jasmine tea as well. Yum. Over the decade plus we have been coming to Pin Kaow the staff has always been very courteous and make sure your beverages are promptly filled.

Our service was actually great, but we had 4-5 people checking on us (with only two other tables occupied... it was not crowded AT ALL).  Why couldn't we be  seated on the patio as we requested?  There seemed to be plenty of help, not short staffed at all.    Although we missed out on a beautiful patio dining experience in great weather, the food was acceptable.",

This Pin Kaow is right near my house and very clean inside and you know what they say \"Cleanliness is next to Godliness\" Two things I appreciate here is that it is clean and decorated so cool. As you walk in you are greeted with a wooden sign that says \"Welcome to Thailand\" and the ambiance does feel like we have gone on a trip...  OK on to the food- Today we had:   - Green Curry with Chicken- Pretty good, white meat, and I love the thin bamboo shoots -Tom Yum Soup- I think this soup is stinky so I am honestly turned off by it and it was no different here however I must say I really do enjoy it at Ping Pong ( it does not stink there and they also put mushrooms in the soup) -Beef Pad See Ew- The beef was tough - the beef should be soft-but still this dish was acceptable -Veggie Spring Rolls- It's OK, but I think it could use more flavor and the dipping sauce they provide is too sweet like a melted lollipop -Wonton Soup - No flavor but wontons were plump and filled All in all I am not impressed by this place at all but the BF loves it!!! It is close to home and OK in my book so I guess we will be back but only if going to Ping Pong is not attainable.....",

    "text": "Went here for the first time to meet a friend.  It was Sunday (Super Bowl) afternoon so the place was understandably empty.  We were greeted by four (4) staff members and was seated right away.  We were the only customers.  Wasn't planning on pigging out because I wanted to catch the game.  We ordered our drinks, Thai Iced Coffee and diet Coke, as we sat down.   We ordered pretty much the same dish, my friend ordered Beef Pad See Ewe, and I ordered Beef Rad Na (basically, pad see ewe soup).   The drinks came quite quickly.  The drinks were in cocktail glasses and personally i thought they were a tad small for one serving.  The coffee was MEH!  Didnt feel the caffeine kick at all.    The food came and of course they looked identical because the only difference was that the other was dry, and the other, a soup-like dish.  The servings were MEH!.  Normally, a dish could be easily shared by two, but their servings weren't even enough for one adult.  I think they cooked both our orders the same time, in the same pot and just divided in half and poured sauce on the other.  My friend wasn't hungry but he finished and cleaned his plate (that tells you how small the serving was). Taste, flavoring, spice, heat and seasoning were a-OK.  I had much better, and a lot more, Thai food in other Thai restaurants.    Service was OK.  I was just wondering how come we were never served water, or was there a need to ask for it?    I don't think I'll be coming back here considering the many choices I have around the valley.",

Since then, I tried the South Rainbow location and I came away slightly disappointed. Fortunately, Pin Kaow 3 has reaffirmed my faith in their name.  My friends and I went here last week for a birthday lunch. We pretty much all ordered from the lunch special menu. They cost slightly more than lunch specials at other Thai restaurants, but the quality of the food helps you ignore that.  I usually go for the Panang Curry whenever it's available. However, it has been so long since I've had Pad Thai. I went with that instead. Maybe it's due to my long Pad Thai hiatus, but it was absolutely delicious. Authentic? Who knows. Yummy? Definitely.  I should also mention that the service was incredibly friendly. We had a large group and they seemed very grateful that we chose to dine at their restaurant. Great food and service. What more could you want.",

    "text": "I would absolutely give this place a better review because the food is amazing! However the service falls flat in that department. Took prob 6-7 minutes before our server came to table to which you would think a drink order would be taken. But not in this circumstance. She came over and asked what we wanted to eat. I proceeded to give her out drink order first along with appetizer choices. She then brought our drinks and we placed out entrees. Our appetizers came out separate and rather fast. Our entrees on the other hand took nearly 30 minutes. The entire time as we waited we never had a server come to table nor a manager. Thankfully our busser was good and able to refill our drinks and take out dirty plates away. Once our food came our server never even came to check to see if everything was ok and to our liking or if we needed anything else. Had she we would have order some veggies we had forgot to order. Once we finished and got Togo boxes we were super excited for dessert which was really why we went. But nope. After waiting almost 10 minutes to get anyone's attention she finally came to ask if we were ready for our check never even offering dessert. By this point we were so aggravated by the service we felt it better to go find dessert elsewhere and leave. I have always been given a hard time because being a GM and working in this industry for 10+years I always still tip at least 15% regardless of how bad service was. And tonight for the first time ever I didn't tip because the only person who deserved anything was the busser and he wasn't there when we went to leave. We couldn't even get a manager to ever make eye contact or approach us. Service overall and hospitality was a fail. Kitchen...great job! Food was spectacular!",

We ordered our food and it came just like i wanted it. HOT, they offer heat on a scale of 1 - 10 and since I like hot stuff, I ordered a 10 and it came just as I wanted it.

Pin Kaow is a stones throw away from my place so when I came down with the flu I called them up for my go to, feel better,  stand by of tom ka kai with side of sticky rice. Too bad the soup was a tiny little portion and it was so salty and thick  I ended up thinning it out with water. Definitely not the kind of hassle you want when you feel crumm-ola. I ended up paying $12 total for about one cup of soup and a small side of sticky rice. Bums. On the bright side, the sticky rice was warm and delish.",

We opted to sit on the patio and take advantage of the breezy, cooler summer night and, because of that choice, were seated right away. Bonus!  Water was brought out immediately and our table was dressed for three. The waitress and busser were friendly and helpful, asking if it was our first visit and making recommendations based on what we liked from other places/cuisines.  - Curry puffs - Edamame - Thom Ka Koong - Panang curry (shrimp) - Pad thai (chicken) - Garlic (pork)  The puffs were good and reminded me of an Indian samosa (unsurprising, as I believe it's a regional thing). The one part I would have liked to be different was that it have more of a thai flair to it... a twist on the spice, or a sauce? Really tasty, but I wanted something with more curry and more puff.  The edamame was, well, edamame. Needed salt. Still, it was fresh and hot (temperature) and good.  The Thom Ka Koong (galangal, shrimp) soup was tasty. The downside was that I asked for a 7 out of 10 on the spice request (never having been there, I didn't want to go too far without knowing how heavy handed they were)... and what I got was more like a 4-ish. Good soup, bummer on the spice factor. I really think it would have made it pop that much more for me.  The pad thai was about what I expected, plentiful, and the protein was super tender. Not very spicy, but it wasn't mine to order. For the 3 or 4 she requested, it was done right. Decent dish.  The panang was very good. I could have used more spice (again I asked for a 7, got a 4ish), and I would have liked more of the curry sauce for the amount of shrimp and veggies I was given. Don't take away anything, but definitely give more of what I am ordering. Flavors were spot on, texture was perfect, and it was well put together overall.  The garlic pork was beyond tender, heavy on the garlic (yay!) and about the 4-5 spice level he ordered. The veggies were crisp or tender as appropriate and the whole dish was executed well. Definitely some \"gotta try this\" moments as we passed around forks and shared.  We opted out of dessert and they brought us some really fresh (and creatively presented) cut oranges and other fruit as a refresher. Juicy, fresh, cooling. Perfect.  All that food, and a bottle of wine, and I think it was maybe $100 for the three of us? We were quite happy with what we ate, the service, and the price tag. Not the best in town, but for what it is? Totally A-OK and definitely worth repeating. (And, they deliver? Hmmmm...)",

I asked for a tofu substitute and coconut milk substitute on two items for dietary reasons and both requests could not be carried out. The only request I WAS able to get was black coffee. And I think I wasn't supposed to be permitted that either so thank you to my server for making it happen.  Vegan, vegetarian or if you have any other dietary restrictions then beware. You will probably be limited to whatever is printed on the menu. The Mango Salad  was decent and savory. The spice level was slightly mild, you may want to consider ordering up a number from usual. (Spice rating is 1 -10)   Service is ok, kid friendly as others have mentioned.  No water. If you want water you have to specifically order it.",

    "text": "So... this is a review for DINNER on a Tuesday evening.  Service: 4 stars We were greeted nicely and immediately upon entering... seated quickly. The waitress took our drink orders and had them brought out while we figured out what we wanted to eat. Food was delivered promptly and was served hot (but not burn your mouth hot). Water glasses were kept filled without us having to ask.  Menu: Good selection of curries, noodles, fried rice, salads and soups.  We started with the Tom Ka Kai (coconut chicken soup).... OMG!   This is freakin' good....5 stars.   The coconut milk makes this soup rich... so be prepared.  The lemongrass is a bit strong but it helps cut the coconut milk.  Big strips of chicken and the mushrooms were nice and succulent.  Then we had the Spicy Eggplant w/ chicken and Combo Fried Rice.    The Spicy Eggplant wasn't all that spicy since we asked for #2... which is really mild... but we weren't sure how \"spicy\" spicy was... so we erred on the side of caution and added our own chili garlic spice as necessary to heat things up.  Anyways.... the Eggplant... I'd give it a 4 star rating and would order it again.  It was very nicely prepared in a light, flavorful brown sauce. (It was served with Jasmine white rice which was 'ok'.)  The Combo  Fried... I'd give it a solid 3 stars.... better than plain fried rice but it didn't knock my socks off.  Will we be back again?  Yes.",

The inside is adorable--it's all carved wood and dark colors.  The Thai iced teas are average size--not giant like Thai House or Archi's, but also not tiny.  The best things I've had: Pad Thai, red curry, Pad Kee Mao, panang curry, and Thai beef salad.  All of it has been delicious!  I recommend this place if you're on this side of town and you want some consistently good food.  By the way, I was in here the other day for lunch and a woman was flipping out about something, and the poor servers handled it beautifully.  I have no idea if the woman's complaints were valid, but she was treating them horribly and they were very considerate and kind to her.  I was impressed by that, and I know that they've always been nice to me.",

    "text": "I first ate here several years ago when I was simply Thai-curious and not in a full blown relationship with Thai food as I am now.  The first time I went to Pin Kaow was all about discovery and I ordered the Pad Thai as it was the dish I'd heard most about.  I probably should have gone with something a little more adventurous or exciting but I wasn't that kind of guy back then!  The Pad Thai was okay, maybe a little boring.  I spent a little more than I thought it was worth but looking back on it now it was a cheap first date considering what this love has blossomed into.  On further visits when I was much more experienced having visited other Thai mistresses such as LOS, Prommares, Weera, and Archi (?!), I tried other dishes like the Salmon Chu-Chee (Salmon in Red Curry), Spicy Basil with Pork, Thai Beef Salad, Crying Tiger Beef, and the Tom Yum Koong hot pot (a VERY good version).   I always walk away satisfied leaving my money and tip on the table, but cant help but think of the more exotic offerings I've been exposed to at the equivalent in price Lotus  or the cheaper Weera.    I've found myself slowly weening off of Pin Kaow as the months pass, only visiting her on occasions where I find it convenient.   Don't worry though, I'll try to remember to write once in a while.",

    "text": "I went here with a work lunch, which took just over an hour.The atmosphere was wonderful, and the staff was very friendly. The menu seemed quite large, but they had a simple \"lunch special\" page that seemed to have a nice variety at good prices.  I ordered the Red Curry with chicken, at a low-to medium spice level, and everyone else at my table ordered Pad Thai and the same Red Curry. The special came with a choice of salad or spring roll, and I ordered a spring roll, but received a Salad. The food came in a fairly staggered manner. There were five of us, and three of us received our food, (mine with the wrong side), then after about 5 minutes, a fourth dish came out, and after another 10, the 5th. Which short of left us with the \"do I eat while this is hot, or wait and not be rude\" conundrum. It ended up that they had confused the sides on the two curries, so I swapped with one of my co-workers, and it was not a big deal.  The food overall was good but lackluster. My curry seemed to rely on the spiciness as the primary seasoning, and could have used a little bit of salt or...something. Curry doesn't have to be hot in order to be flavorful; it seemed sort of one-dimensional, though the \"heat\" level was just as advertised, which is something I appreciate as a Spice Wuss.   The low point of the meal, though, was when I noticed that one of my companions who had ordered the Pad Thai, had a nice collection of egg shell bits gathered on the corner of his plate. It had taken him a minute, he said, to figure out what the sharp crunchy bits were.  I probably won't be back for dinner or on my own, but the proximity to my office and reasonable lunch prices will probably bring me back at least once more to see if they were just having an off day. Hopefully I can update this review with another star then! :)",

For appetizer, we got calamari and for the entrees, we just ordered pineapple fried rice and BBQ spare ribs. Appetizer came out within 5 minutes. The entrees took about 20 minutes.  The pineapple fried rice came out on a half cut pineapple bowl, hot and tasty. Did not add any spice. The spare ribs were cold/room temp. Had to ask them to reheat them but now at this point I just wanted to leave. It took another 10 minutes for them to come back with heated ribs and at this point, I was ready to leave.   Once I saw our waitress, I asked for the check. Shortly after another lady, who I think is the manager/owner, asked if I needed a to-go box for the ribs. I said \"no thanks, just waiting for the check.\"   The second I told her, she saw right through me. She noticed that this 6'1ft 260 pound Filipino man was not happy. I told her I did not like them as they were cold when I first received them and their waitress confirmed as she was about to hand me the check. The older lady told her something in Thai to not charge me and she went back to adjust the check.  1 star for being seated quickly and another 1 for noticing that my fat hungry ass was not happy with the ribs.",

    "text": "This is probably the worse Thai place I've been to in Vegas. The only reason we finished our food was because we were both really hungry and I hate seeing food go to waste.   Let me start with the service. We were greeted and sat down pretty quickly. Our waiter took our food order and that's pretty much the end of seeing him. Someone else brought our food out and not once did he check if everything was ok. The bf needed chili for his food and it took us forever to flag down anyone to bring it to us. Every other table around us had the little chili condiment plate except for us, so the bf started to get irritated. The food was equally disappointing as well.   Mee krob: crunchy noodles covered in oyster sauce with shrimp and chicken. Way too sweet for any noodle dish. It only had 2 pieces of shrimp and 2 tiny pieces of chicken.   Tom yum with shrimp: traditional lemongrass soup served with shrimp, mushrooms and tomatoes. This was the highlight of the meal. Spicy, sour goodness. Only downside was that it was served as a hot pot and you could smell the gas burning underneath to keep the soup hot. The gas fumes were not very pleasant while eating.   Brown rice: hard and old tasting.   Chicken panang: Thai curry with coconut milk. Let's just say their version was very bland. I've had much better panang elsewhere.   Overall, this was a pretty crappy dinner the bf and I have had in a while. Would definitely not recommend this place.",

I like the beef but I'm pretty sure the chicken is also bomb with pad thai. Their decor on the inside is super cute and very authentic.

There are so many options in this area but Thai food sounded the best. We had never been there before but decided to give it a try.  We were immediately greeted and sat in a nice booth on the side. I loved the atmosphere and decor. On every table was a vase with a flower.   The menu had a lot to choose from, while there was also a specials menu for the day.  A male server approached us and got our drinks. He was polite but I didn't catch anybody's name. There were several people who took care of us, all very nice.   The food was the truly impressive part. To start we ordered the crab rangoons. Next we enjoyed a silver noodle salad. And shortly after our beef soup came. I loved all items.  The manager cleared out plates at the end and boxed up our food togo.   We will definitely be coming back to try more items as we were pleased by the whole experience.",

I just gotten out of Pilates class and wanted to eat something \"healthy.\" To which Thai food, is as healthy as can be these days.  He had gotten the pad-see-ew; and I got their Pin Kaow specialty catfish. Again, I wanted to stick to fish for the \"healthy\" part of my meal.  The workers were extremely friendly considering the dinner rush was in full tow.   While waiting on the entrees, I sipped on my thai ice tea to which I really REALLY liked. It wasn't as sweet as most places do it which is allllllllllllll good to me.  Our food came; and let me tell you that the pad-see-ew was the best I've ever had. Not greasy, lots of flavor (not fat), and lots of veggies.  The catfish came out and; to be quite honest, I didn't know what I expected but, it was the BEST THING EVER! I think it was WHOLE catfish oil fried (not to be mistaken with deep fried IN hot oil) and covered with lots of veggies and sauce. OHHHHHHHH, that sauce. It was the 1st time my friend had had it and he loved it, as well. The portions wer so large, I wound up taking the leftovers to my boyfriends where he and his roomies loved the fish, too!  Since discovering Pin Kaow, I, literally, came here every day for a whole week to eat the pad-see-ew. I would eat the catfish but, that's something I wouldn't be able to finish on my own.",

All three locations are beautifully designed on the inside, and really contribute to the culture of the food and puts you \"in the mood\" to enjoy some great hospitality. This is one of those restaurants where I feel like I really *am* a part of the culture in that sitting. The scenery makes you feel like you're in a formal setting of a thai restaurant, although the restaurant itself is far from formal.   I was here several days ago. I usually go to the one that's by Lake Mead/I-95 since it's closer to my side of town, but I decided to venture out to the other two to see if the quality was just as good as the original establishment. I always order the Red Curry with chicken and bamboo shoots with extra rice; am absolutely *obsessed* with this, since you have your choice on a lot of the menu items to pick from 1-10 on level of spiciness.  Their menu has full of unique variety and flavor to choose from, and the service here is by far one of the best in Vegas. I would honestly say the service is just as great as the food itself, maybe even better! I've noticed the managers will stop by asking how your meal has gone, and everyone is more than willing to cater to what you need, and are very friendly. This is my favorite spot to take my friends when they are feeling adventurous with eating and need a change of scenery from the typical, boring restaurant atmosphere.",

So our normal bill of about $20 has increased to $40, but WHO CARES, when the food this THAT good = consistently every time, might I add...  It's more than worth it!!

    "text": "Wifey and I met our friend gary there for dinner last night.  Once again to preface, we would fly to bangkok for food weekends.  Our friend Gary has been to thailand a load of times so we have high expectations.  Ambience : Very thai very nice interior, they have a patio area as well.  Didnt see people out there yet so I dont know if they have miss-ters or what the deal is with that.   Service: very attentive, quick to answer questions and check on us.  most staff are thai (a good sign).  Also asked for something \"off menu\" and were supplied with what we wanted.  Spice Level 1-10: however our thai server let us know she orders stuff into the 15 level.  Found a 5 was enough to make me sweat probably could've gone to an 8 for my wife and gary (yes I am a bit weak when it comes to chilis) however, they supply the tray of condiments of chili flakes fish sauce etc if you want to push it up a notch personally.  THE FOOD  Penang curry (gai-chicken): very creamy and tasty rich yellow curry and the chicken was done perfectly.  Morning glory/water spinach: this wasnt on the menu, however it is the go to vegetable dish anytime we are in thailand, we were very happy they could make it for us was very very tasty, spicy and fresh  Mongolian beef: not quite thai but tasty a little on the sweet side  Tom yum goong soup: quite nice and tasty not too sour, very nice in a hot pot to keep it nice and hot.  Fish cakes: very good taste, texture we would like for it to be a bit more crispy on the outside, but the taste was definitely like back in thailand and we were happy and they disappeared quickly (think i sucked mine down too fast)  Green tea ice cream: not overpowering green tea tasted fresh and well done and home made  Coconut ice cream : very cream and coconutty.  We will go again and i was a bit of a gawker at other people's food.  Want to try the mint chili noodles and fish fishes as well as the mango sticky rice dessert.  We will be going back and soon.  I think Gary is already going back the next day.  Great find and we were very happy with everything.  I rarely do a 5 star as something for 5 stars has to be the best of the best of something, and for thai food, my 5 star ratings are for food carts on the side of the road in bangkok while choking on exhaust fumes so go figure.",

    "text": "Hello, my name is Anhdao and I am a Thai food-addict.  The habit started nine years ago, when I lived in Los Angeles and a drive to Thai town was only 10 minutes.  I cannot go more than a couple of days without getting Thai.  Any longer than that and symptoms such as sleeplessness, lack in work diligence, and even unnecessary irritation will begin.  Luckily for this addict, there is a very reliable Thai establishment less than 2 miles from my house.  Pin Kaow 3 has very consistent food and beautiful decor, which is why I am not surprised to find that it is already a chain in Las Vegas, with three locations to boast, accessible to all directions of the valley and all Thai food-seekers of any Thai-food level of addiction.    The menu has a wide variety for a restaurant that aims to serve the undiscriminating masses rather than the select few.  This range of choices comes at a sacrifice in the quality of the food (don't attempt their Larb salad unless you have plenty of water on hand for the dryness).  However, it's a perfect place to take the rawest of Thai food neophytes who are not looking for tongues on fire and dishes whose names do not yet have English translations.  My Pin Kaow favorite is definitely the Crab Fried Rice, it is the exact middle ground of authenticity and popularity at the restaurant.  They give you a fair amount of real crab, the rice is moist, not overly greasy, and there is a good portion.  They also do curries very well.  I recommend the Salmon Green Curry or the Pork Panang Curry.  I find these curries at spicy level 2 will satisfy most my non-Thai friends who are looking for a kick without a stomach ache.    The food here really equates three stars for me.  But the extra star comes from the pleasant ambience (there is no unflattering flourescent light), the beautiful serveware (blue & white china even just for steamed rice), and the attentive service (yes, I would love my leftovers boxed, please).",

I am a huge red curry  and panang curry fan, but a friend recently got the chili mint noodles and they were outstanding, too.  It is a rule when dining here with others that no one orders the same thing as to ensure the most opportunity to taste lots of delicious things.  The Pin Kaotini is also quite yummy.  The portions always allow for a great late night snack or are also the best cold the next morning for breakfast.",

This time around was different because we came to introduce a friend to this restaurant. As we arrived, we were told to wait 5 mins while they get our table ready for our party of 3, so we waited politely to be seated. After waiting about 10 mins, ANOTHER party of 3 walks in the door and were seated within 30 secs of their arrival! When we brought it to their attention that we have arrived first and have been waiting longer, they said they \"DIDN'T KNOW\" and were giving MULTIPLE EXCUSES! We had to wait another few minutes until we were finally seated!  Already FRUSTRATED, we thought that the food will at least make up for the bad experience, but it got even worse. The Pad Thai (spicy level 4) was unbelievably salty and the Gulf of Thai seafood dish was bland as the sauce was watered down. The QUALITY was as POOR as their SERVICE and NOT what we remembered and expected. We used to love this place, but this experience has left a salty taste in our mouths (pun intended).",

Workers arent proud of what they do, not as friendly as they should be. Its like they are just waiting for their 8 hour shift.   Was leaving and said thank you, supervisor did not even say something. Tipped 20% and was regretful for it.   Food is basic Service is pale 2 stars for ambiance which is really nice for a first date Alot of thai places around which will be more affordable Not coming back.",

However, after a recent to-go purchase, we were extremely disappointed by the portion size.  We have gone to eat there as a family many times and never really take any food home as leftovers the way we do at a couple other Thai restaurants. The pretty presentation distracts you from realizing just how little food you are actually getting for your money.   Side note: the yellow curry in was very liquid-like and not thick and creamy the way we are accustomed to.  Time to say goodbye for a while I think. Overall: meh.",

Some of my co-workers said that the spice level is a little on the lower side so I guess adjust upwards if you like them spicy.   The decor in this place too was beautiful. They have wooden carved artwork hanging, and the booths make you feel toile you are in a Thai temple. There is also open seating outside with a fountain.   I will come back.",

Location is pretty good easy to spot it's in the same shopping center as Bjs restaurant.  As we entered we were greeted with a happy smile with the staff in their authentic native thai clothing. The entire restaurant gave that Thai feel and the ambiance was amazing too as well. Not to loud and you can easily hold a conversation at your table without screaming.  We ordered the Chinese broccoli with chicken which was delicious. Been loving the greens lately since i'm on a special diet.  Next we also ordered the pineapple fried rice mixed with cashews, raisins , and pineapple literally served on a pineapple. Really awesome!.  For another entree we ordered the Sea Bass which was to die for, it was incredible delicious, it better be it was pricey and from Bangkok  For noddles we decided to have the Silver Noodle Salad, a bit too spicy for me but still really good.  We were both kind of disappointed since the mango salad was not available. They only have it during mango season time,  For drinks we had a lycee martini which was really good it did not even taste like alcohol and also Thai coffee.. bomb digidy also!  For dessert we decided to have the fried banana with coconut ice cream! I really loved it! Specially the coconut ice cream, it tasted the same in Thailand.  As far as authenticity of the food it tastes exactly the same in Thailand.  I would love to go back to this place and suggest it to everyone. I also heard there is live entertainment on the weekends so I might go back and check it out.",

For a Thursday night, the restaurant was busy, but we were able to get a table right away. It's a medium sized restaurant and really nice inside. It's not your typical hole in the wall Thai place. You could dress up and come here for dinner and fit right in.  The service and food were better than I had anticipated. I was starving so I wanted order like 4 things and have a bunch of left overs for my boyfriend. My friend is vegetarian so she ordered the spring rolls, which are deep fried so to me, that's egg rolls, but whatevs. She also ordered tofu green curry.   I ordered papaya salad, beef larb with a side of sticky rice, and chicken red curry. The papaya salad is really good, but it could stand a little bit more flavor. I'm used to the lao potent version, but this version is very refreshing and delicious. I'm scared of spice so I ordered it at a 3, and it was barely spicy. I wish I had stuck to 5.   The larb was really delicious. I love sticking my sticky rice in the plate one bite at a time. It's how we'd eat it when I was younger. Yum!    The red curry was also very good, but a little sweet for my taste. I added salt and it balanced out the sweetness and was perfect.   Overall I was super happy and satisfied. I would say it's one of my top Thai places in Vegas behind Lotus and Le Thai. However, compared to Lotus and Le Thai, the prices are WAY more reasonable. My 3 dishes and a Lychee Martini came to about $50 with tip. That's a steal!",

The good thing is the option of fried or steamed tofu.  I went for steamed.  The dish had jalepenos, red bell pepper, basil, really delicious eggplant and steamed tofu with a side of white rice.  I also got suckered into the specials menu.  I ordered a soft shell crab-apple salad.  It sounds weird, but it was sooooo good.  A crisp soft shell crab cut in half atop julienned apples, thai chilis, green onions, red onion, cabbage, carrot, and garlic with a lime dressing.  It was spiiiicy!  I got a 5 on the salad and a 7 on the eggplant dish, but Blair B. would not be surprised when I say the salad was spicier than the hot dish :)  Topped off the meal with a Thai iced tea (those are $3 now holy moly!) and ended up with plenty for tomorrow's lunch.  So far, I am still interested in coming back for more.",

Service was horrid from start to finish. After being seated by the gracious hostess, we waited 20 minutes for a server to appear. Then another 15 for our drink order to arrive. Three of the four dinners arrived at the same time, but the fourth came when everyone else was finishing. After waiting interminably for the check, we got up and headed for the door. That got the hostess' attention and she tracked down our check so we could leave.  Thinking our experience might be exceptional, I scanned other reviews, many of which tell the same sad story - basic Thai dishes prepared well but with lousy to atrocious service. Too bad.",

It's a little pricey for dinner, in my opinion, with most meals being around $20 and not including anything but the meal and white rice.  Their decor is very authentic with lots of cabinetry work which is interesting to look at.  I was surprised at how many people where there on a Tuesday night around 7 pm.  Parking was a pain in the butt, I drove around for a bit before I found a spot.  We started with the curry puff fried dough awesome goodness!  It was very tasty!  My friend got the Basil Steak and Noodles spice level 8, it was so spicy I barely could eat it. He was sweating and didn't finish it all, I think he was unable to b/c of the heat, but he's a dude so he would never outwardly admit defeat!  I got the Shrimp and Scallops in Garlic Sauce on the advice of the waiter.  Presentation was very nice and it did have a garlic flavor but I felt the dish lacked some depth to it, every bite was essentially the same.  The scallops were mushy and undercooked, they definitely were frozen prior, I picked them out [see pix]. I've had curry there before and it was pretty good, so I think next time I'll stick w/ that.  Our waiter had too many tables. He was running around trying to service them all but it was next to impossible. And of course they were all spaced out.  We waited for drinks, we waited for food, we waited on him to wait on other tables, I even noticed other tables were waiting on him to wait on other tables.  Couple of drinks, 2 dishes, 1 app, bill was ~$75 with tip",

I was shocked. Im giving them 2 stars just because they were so good before now and they did give me a refund on the order and took the food back. So sad, this was the only great Thai(comparable with West coast Thai) in Henderson. To serve something like that is inexcusable, there is no way any decent cook would think that was passable seafood.

Bumping up a star since it is Vegas after all and not Thai Town LA. **  A Thai friend recommended this place, but seeing the NE Thai dishes on their online menu sealed the deal. I ordered nam kao tod and sticky rice to go. On the upside they did a careful job at packing the ingredients to avoid a soggy mess and everything was freshly prepared. On the downside it was mostly rice. I have been spoiled by Sri Siam in NoHo where their nam kao tod is chocked full of ginger, cilantro and Thai sausage, ground pork or chicken, and where the same order would run you $4 less. You may not get the polished wood paneling and waitstaff in fancy Thai dress at Sri Siam but I'd take better food over atmosphere any day.

My husband and I were the only ones on their patio, which was surprising because the atmosphere out there was surprisingly nice.  It's secluded from the shopping center and feels like you are eating your meal in a garden, very cool, very homey.  The people here are super friendly and you can expect to be \"checked up on,\" several times throughout your meal.  The only thing I do not reccomend is the Thai coffee, something is just not quite right with it, and I can't put my finger on it exactly.  I can't bear to dock a star for this little issue because  the Thai tea and their dishes are amazing.  Thai food is my new love and this place is phenomenal. :-)",

If it hadn't been windy, we might have elected to sit on the patio, but the restaurant itself was very nicely appointed.  The service was terrific!  We ordered the curry puff appetizer, the Pad Prik King with beef, the Chili Mint Noodles with chicken, and the Pad See Ew, also with chicken.  The curry puff appetizer was flavorful, although I probably wouldn't order it again just because it wasn't what we expected and there are other intriguing appetizers on the menu. All of the entrees were excellently prepared and at just the right spice level we requested.  The waiter was extremely attentive to our requests for condiments, etc. and the good service added to the wonderful experience.  I will definitely visit again!  Can't wait to try other items on their menu.",

The Stuffed Chicken wing was mediocre, as the filling was very bland and the outside wasn't very crispy. Still no one can beat the Wings of Angel at Thai BBQ. The Chicken Pad thai was good, and they gave us extra crushed peanuts like we requested. The Duck fried rice was decent, although the rice was too wet, leading it to be  a bit mushy. But big pieces of roast duck were in the fried rice. The Pin Kao tilapia was also rather bland. I prefer the fish (pompano) at Thai BBQ. This tilapia wasn't whole, but rather filets which made it more convenient to eat. Overall, I prefer the taste of Thai BBQ on Rainbow and Flamingo any day of the week.",

After 4 courses, cocktail wine and $160.00 later we asked for dessert which they quickly informed us that the kitchen was closed. Truly unfortunate being that we live directly around the corner. Fortunately for us they are not the only game in town. Galanga, Archies andLotus of Siam for instance blow their doors off. Good luck to you Pin Kaow!!!",

Dan T. and I usually go to the one on rainbow by our house, but this day we were doing a little shopping over at nordstroms rack and needed some energy. while both craving thai this place was near and since we have been to number 2 we knew it was safe. It was during lunch time, but we didn't order from the lunch menu. I was surprised to see that pad see ew didn't make the lunch menu cut. That is my favorite and usually my safe go-to dish. i almost always see it on the lunch menu. my boyfriend ordered his usual chicken pad thai spice set at 6. we waited for 10 maybe 15 minutes and it came out. now i will tell you why pin kaow has yet to win my heart. it never fails that when i order my safe go-to dish pin kaow is selfish with the broccoli and that is my favorite part. their beef is good and their sauce is alright. the noodles thick and melting in my mouth, but for some reason the broccoli is a let down. yes, maybe i should start picking a new dish, but why when everywhere else is not stingy? i had some thai iced tea and it was just way too sweet for my liking. it is not my favorite thai place in las vegas, but it is not the worst either. the chicken pad thai is alright and i do enjoy having thai leftovers for my late night cravings and pin kaow leftovers hold up pretty well in the fridge. i say don't make the crosstown drive, but if you are nearby and craving thai this place is okay. just don't expect to be wow'd.",

As soon as we opened the door, we were greeted by this lady who was nicely dressed in traditional thai clothing. Inside was clean and welcoming. I recall we were the only customers there that time, but oh well, it was sunday, this restaurant is located in Henderson and everyone in Vegas must have been busy partying @ the strip that night.    When I sat down, I wasn't so hungry, so I was going to only eat papaya salad, but I changed my mind when I look the menu because I found the whole fried red snapper, and I couldn't resist it. (Who can? especially when you're from Asia) Usually, whole fried fish would cost min $50 if you are to order it at those chinese restaurants on the strip, but here, it was reasonably priced and I paid only $20. Ha! The fish was perfectly cooked, inside was steamy and didn't stink at all (it happens sometimes when you don't prepare it well). The meat was firm, and outside was crispy, crunchy, and drenched in spicy tangy sauce. It was not oily though. I ate tails and small bones too... I asked her to prepare it pretty spicy, and they did it just the way I liked it.   I also ordered Papaya salad which was like $9.00 and it wasn't a disappointment, but I've had something better for this price before. As for duck curry, meat was very tender and surprisingly not too oily. It was kinda sweet because of the pineapples they put in. This one was $13 and it's worth the repeat.   Next time, I'd like to try couple different soup :)",

    "text": "Mm... so I remember taking a trip over here when they first opened up. It was just... OK. I will commend the decor, but the food was what I really wanted to see!  My boyfriend and I were hungry! We had been going on a Thai food rampage for that whole 2 weeks, it seemed. We bounced around from Thai restaurant to another and saw that this was open. I was familiar with seeing their other location near the LVAC on Rainbow/95 when I lived in the NW.   Well, their portions were small, for one... we got the spicy mint chicken. Instead they brought out spicy tofu. In the midst of our confusion and it being our first time to any Pin Kaow, my boyfriend and I figured that the chicken may be hidden somewhere underneath, and so we proceeded to mess up the cute presentation. We found no chicken between the swirling of both our forks and the plate, and later flagged down the waitress. (BTW, we were the only other guests in the room besides a couple in front of us that seemed to be enjoying an intimate conversation.) Asked her about the dish, and we found out we had gotten the wrong dish. She was a little disappointed about our messing up the plate, but did take it back and came back with what we did order. It was decent.  We also got the pad see ew. Also decent, but again... a small portion.   Oh and the Thai iced tea... I think I can drink that in 3 gulps. -sad face  Also, the rice they gave was not enough to go with the rest of our food. We had to pay for extra rice. How disappointing!  I may be spoiled by my usual Thai restaurant -- ahem* Thai House Restaurant on Silverado/Maryland-- so this may be why I'm not that impressed. But... I know I probably will not return here unless someone else is paying.",

I thought it was very dry. It only came with two of them and we discussed how many they normally come with at other Thai restaurants we've dined at. The cucumber salad that accompanied it was good. We ordered the salmon green curry and spicy mint tofu. WOW, we were very disappointed when it came out. No joke, the portions are tiny as hell!! Seriously.. these are entree portions?! I almost wanted to laugh when they brought it was but decided to refrain from that.  The salmon curry was yummy. I have never tried green curry with salmon and it was delicious although next time I'll stick with chicken or tofu. The spicy mint tofu was not as flavorful as I hoped but overall was fine. Just the portions really bugged the hell outta me!   The workers were very nice and always made sure to fill our waters and too see if we wanted more beer or wine.   Sorry, probably won't return. I'm sticking to Thai House on Maryland!! For the same prices, you can get waaay more food. Last night was seriously the first time I ever went home without any leftovers from eating at a Thai restaurant! Disappointing!!",

I slathered my tongue in the Greek yogurt to try and knock out the spice. I felt like my eyes were gonna explode out of my head!!  After about half an hour of sweating I was still hungry and strangly still wanted curry. So I meticulously picked out every suspicious looking green item and then enjoyed the rest of my dish. I tried to trick my boyfriend into eating the \"green veggies\" but he caught on to my gimmicks. I'm not good at keeping a straight face.  Next time, \"panang curry, but hold the peppers please!\"",

All of which I would recommend without hesitation. I've eaten the red, green and panang curries which are usually all good. On my last trip I ordered the panang curry and it was a bit disappointing as the chicken and green beans were over cooked and a bit short on the red pepper slices.  The walls are finished with wood paneling and carvings which are 1 part traditional and 1 part dated but its a nice break from the ultra hip granite steel and marble of vegas' upscale dining scene. Well known tunes from the last 3 decades seep out of the speakers at a level which doesn't interfere with conversations. Even at near capacity, the room is still quiet enough to feel relaxed but energized. I requested booth seating and the hostess guided me to the one remaining spot. Gracious considering that several parties came in after me and I was taking up a four top alone. Years ago when I first found Pin Kaow, service was slow and you likely had to ask when you were ready for your check. It seems that feedback from customers has shaped the restaurant into a more western service style, wait staff make frequent visits and your check comes as soon as  you are finished. The jury's still out on whether this is an improvement as there's something to be said about the Thai pace of dinner.  I thanked the waitress for bringing me a chang with one of four mangled Thai phrases I've memorized. She pressed her palms together in an elegant wai and said \"kaa\". The shift ended for my waitress and my desert was served by a waiter who was just as polite. The manager kept an eye on all tables and greeted customers as they were seated.  If you live in Henderson or South Vegas this restaurant is easy to reach and prices, food and service all rate well. Bookmark now and stop in for dinner some time. They also have a well placed outdoor seating area. Saa-waa-dee kaap.",

    "text": "This was my first stop upon landing in Vegas and I must say I think I hit the jackpot!  I enjoy Thai food and when at home I have my usual spots that I frequent when I need a Thai fix.  Visiting las Vegas always excites me not fprthe shows or the casinos or the nightlife mostly because of the diverse and unique dining experiences.  This was my first visit and It will not be my last.  Upon entry my eyes were treated to a visual feast of traditional Thai artwork and decor great attention was paid to detail and it showed throughout the dining room. The server was extremely friendly and gracious.  I ordered my go-to dish of yellow curry with chicken and rice. The flavors in this dish were all beautifully represented from the tender juicy white meat to the Milky spicy curry even the potatoes were perfectly prepared and melted in my mouth. I ordered a signature cocktail, the PP tea the cocktail was nothing special and frankly light on the liquor and heavy on the mixers. The bar took about 25min to prepare our drink, we were almost done with our meal when the drinks arrived. Overall I enjoyed the food and the ambiance I will return to try other dishes on the menu in the near future.",

We ordered the Hotpot of the shrimp soup to start and it was absolutely delicious. It had a very pronounced and delicious lemon grass and ginger flavor with a satisfying quantity of large-sized shrimp.   For our main course, we ordered Green Curry Chicken, Pad Thai and the Seafood Surprise. We elected to get 5/10 for spicyness. The next time I might go up to a 7, but adding a bit of hot sauce made it spicy enough.   The Seafood Surprise was surprising in the quantity of seafood included and it had a very nice sweet, tangy flavor that gave the dish a delicious taste. The green curry was not the very best I've had, but it came awfully close. We elected for the pork which was cut into fairly tiny pieces and didn't make any kind of impression, but the curry compensated The pad Thai was not particularly memorable, but more than adequate.   The portions were well sized. There were 3 in our party, and we had enough food for four. At $50 (no drinks), it felt reasonably priced.   Overall, not blown away but very satisfied. The location is very convenient and I expect I'll go back frequently.",

    "text": "I love that this place is in my neighborhood.  It is rare to find a Thai restaurant that serves masaman curry, much less good-tasting masaman curry!  This place is easily the best Thai place I've eaten at.  In my opinion, Lotus of Siam does not compare.  Also, the combination fried rice is delicious and extremely flavorful.  I usually order takeout; they are very prompt and accurate when quoting a pick-up time.  The few times I have dined at the restaurant, service was probably as good as it gets for being an Asian restaurant.  The servers and bussers were attentive and did not let your drink sit empty for long.   One negative thing about this place is that they only serve one small bowl of rice for two people.  Extra rice is like $2.50 per bowl, which I find ridiculous, especially when both guests order curry and a small bowl is obviously not enough for two people.  I love trying out new Thai restaurants, but when I'm in the mood to eat Thai food and I don't want to be disappointed, I choose Pin Kaow.",

The service is horrible. The server Beau is terribly rude and gave us attitude when we came in 20 minutes before closing. We wanted to go and he made us feel horrible after we kindly asked if it was still ok to get food on the run or if it would be an inconvenience. We've both been in the food and beverage industry and understand the etiquette when a restaurant is closing. But he made us feel unwelcomed and condescending. I usually love this company and their service is usually above par. I hope this changes because there are many competing Thai",

This time around we tried a few different things: Ground Pork Larb- was a little dry ( maybe I'll try the chicken larb next time) but it had great flavor and you could really taste the rice powder (which I love) but could be an acquired taste for some. Green curry with chicken- not too sweet, which is a good thing cause I always stay away from Thai curries cause most places make it way too sweet.  They did a good job of balancing the sweetness, spices and salt. Pad See Eew combination meat- noodles were not overcooked and again, not too sweet, flavor was good.  A few things I'll do differently next time- the meat seems like it was overcooked in both dishes, next time I'll stick with tofu and veggies or shrimp but the mister likes neither tofu or veggies :(  I do like Pin Kaow though- I'll just need to try a few other Thai places before I can say more or less whether it's that good...",

The inside is cute, wooden booths and the bar is set up nicely. We ordered the crab rangoon, beef jerky, tofu pad thai, spicy level 5, and the red curry salmon, spicy level 2. The crab rangoon was very good. I liked the accompanying dipping sauce quite a bit. It looked like chili oil but it wasn't spicy and it was a little thicker than chili oil. I didnt eat the beef jerky, but my friend said most thai places he's been to dont have it, and he enjoyed it! It seemed to be a decent sized portion as well. The pad thai was good. I thought the level 5 spice might be too much but it wasn't. It was just right! My red curry salmon was good. It could have been a touch more spicy, but sometimes, my idea of \"a little kicked up\" and the chef's idea, are vastly different. The coolest thing is they have sea salt in the bathroom for after washing your hands. It smells delightful and your hands are so smooth after. The service was great. I've read some reviews where people said the service wasn't good, but our waitress Venus was really nice and made some recommendations. The food was tasty and prices were good. I will definitely come back if I'm in the area!",

Upon entering the restaurant, I noticed the cleanliness and was immediately put at ease. Service was good. Food was good. I had the Kung Pao Chicken. The Crab Rangoons were delicious, more so because they were full, unlike other restaurants. They have an appetizer, beef jerky, and it is to DIE for. I swear it is meat \"crack\" and I was addicted after the first bite. I don't care about any of the other food. I will be going back for that beef jerky. I will probably have dreams about it. I would have given them 5 stars, but I was bothered slightly by all of the employees hovering around. I understand wanting to be attentive to guests' needs, but it was just a bit too much for me. Still, they are definitely worth trying. And I cannot emphasize it enough, TRY THE BEEF JERKY!",

I got 5's for the first 2 dishes, and I could have probably gotten a 7 and been ok.   1) Spicy basil beef- good flavor, but the meat was kind of dry 2) Spicy Eggplant with chicken - eggplant itself was awesome, definitely my favorite of all the dishes. however, the chicken was SUPER dry 3) Chicken Pad Thai - a bit greasy, and once again, dry chicken  Since I got all take out, I never tried the food fresh- I only had it after a zap in the microwave. For this reason I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt, and contributing some of the dryness of the meat to the microwave. However, if the meat is this dry when the meal is served fresh, I would bump them down to 2 stars.",

We especially like the Seafood Surprise (seafood with ginger, baby corn, and red bell pepper in a Thai spicy sauce), curries (we've tried the duck and catfish curries so far), \"Gulf of Thailand\" (stir-fried seafood and spices in a hot clay pot), and combination fried rice (with shrimp, chicken, beef, and pork). I didn't find the Pork Ginger dish as special as the other items.  The food can be really spicy so be careful how you order. They give you a 10-point choice scale and Level 2 is plenty spicy for us. Level 1 is my personal choice.  We always return the servers' friendliness and respect with a heartfelt \"khaap khun\" (thank you in Thai) which never fails to elicit a warm smile.",

Being very familiar with the area since she visits very regularly, and her friend lives nearby this strip mall, she highly recommended this Thai restaurant. I almost never leave the strip unless my friends are a little more adventurous so it's great that someone familiar knows where to eat around here.  I left it to her to drive me here, which was about 4-5 miles away from the strip. There were lots of familiar restaurants located in this strip mall too, which was expansive and has lots of parking available.  Upon entering, you are wow's at the authenticity of the Thai decor which was warm, cozy, and inviting. We were guided to a booth by a friendly hostess, and the server came over to help us out with the menu right away. Being familiar with Thai food, but not being extremely hungry, we decided not to order too much, but the many choices on the menu, we just had to try as much as we could.....off the happy hour menu as well as the regular menu. We ordered the Fish Cake, Crab Rangoon, and Chicken Satay, Shrimp Roll ....which are all appetizers, and the Pad Woon Sen clear noodles. The difficulty were the many absolutely yummy looking dishes to choose from, but we had to keep reminding ourselves that we weren't that hungry, and that we were only two people.  This Pad Woon Sen was my absolute favorite Thai noodle dish I've had outside of Thailand! It was cooked perfectly, ingredients, were fresh, and totally delicious.....very authentic and comparable to the best you can get in Thailand! I was really impressed....and I'm usually not easily impressed. My next favorite was the Chicken Satay. Big portions of tender chicken meat on the skewer, marinated and grilled to perfection! Again, easily one of the best satays I've had anywhere! The other appetizers were good, but were pretty typical happy hour appetizers.  We will definitely be back to try the other dishes here, which my friend has assured me are \"spectacular\"....!!!  Other than that, the service was good, friendly, and attentive. Great place, great food....ok, slightly pricey, but well worth it ....what else can you possibly want? :)",

But, although I ordered a bowl of Tom Kha Kai soup, I received instead Tom Yum Kai.  This was likely the result of a misheard communication by me, but I know what type of Thai soup I prefer and ordered.  Because I did not detect the missing Coconut Milk until after I had downed a few spoonfuls of the hot soup, and the soup I received was hot and tasty, I did not bring up the mixup.  And, afterward I received a huge portion of good Shrimp Pad Thai with medium spice.  Except for the soup discrepancy, service was good, and I was satisfied with my lunch, and inclined to return some day--but not that very afternoon.  Yet, after I realized that I had left a bottle of lactose enzyme on the table following consideration of various eyeglass frames, I returned to the restaurant in less than two hours, only to learn that a busboy recalled finding such a bottle but had already tossed it away, and the trash receptacle in which it had been placed had already gone out the door.  Although my own negligence clearly caused the pill bottle to be left behind, such a swift toss out by a restaurant employee seemed a little hasty to me.  The bottle could have been retained for at least a few hours just in case a patron came back for it.  But the Thai food was tasty and plentiful enough so that I will likely still dine here again, without any hard feelings.  XXX-1/2 stars overall.",

Located on Eastern in a very busy plaza, sometimes it's hard to get parking. However, I did notice today that there was a sign saying they have more parking towards the back.   Friendly servers, but their service can be either \"too good\" or bad. What do I mean by this? Last time, they did not come around too often and it took waving a couple people down just to get served. Slow service and sometimes it seemed like our table was out of the way and a nuisance (honestly, then sit us next to some closer tables!) Tonight they were very attentive. But moreso too attentive as if they wanted to rush us out. My brother was still eating when they asked if they could take our plates or box anything-in which we replied \"oh, are you closing soon?\" They didn't get the message. When they brought the boxed food back (which...I don't think they are allowed to do. I've heard you can only box something for customers if the food doesn't leave our sights. Can someone correct me?) they brought us oranges and our bill....while my brother was mid bite of his food, which is now the only plate on the table.   Don't be rude! lso, please communicate with each other. It seems as soon as one person asks us if we want something, they leave. And don't give it to us. Then someone else asks the exact same question and we repeat saying \"we just told that other lady-yes we do need that\". We asked for the manager and she heard us out. Very sweet lady, but her answer was that they were trying to be more attentive. (Which I get).  Honestly, they've been open long enough that these service issues should be fine already. Either way, I come for the food. Absolutely delicious! But the service? We'll see what we get next time.",

Lol I'd ask and get some run around excuse. I order the same thing every time, Nam Tak Salad. Today was the 3rd time and I'm very upset with how the so called manager handled it.

Sorry we didnt take photos But this is what we ordered  1.Trout lemon grass, very good crispy and flavorful.  2.pad thai with beef very good not enough peanuts 3.duck friend rice,excellent! 4.chinese crispy pork belly with brocoli..very tastey. 5.thai ice tea..good 6.hot jasmine tea 7.bottle is passion ice tea 8.bottle of pomegranate tea Total bill=103.16 Very pricey you would think for how much money we spent they would offer us some desert.even to go but they came out with lousy orange slices ,I was pissed to say the least even if they were gonna  Close they could of offered anything to go..they rushed us out.the other thing I didnt appreciate was their unfriendly attitude and that after all our dishes came to the table our waitress says last call..I think when I hear last call that this means for alcohol which we didnt order..apparently this means..last CHANCE TO ORDER ANYTHING INCLUDING DESSERT..REALLY?..SO THIS IS WHY WE COULD NOT GET DESSERT..GO FIGURE!..I WONT EAT HERE AGAIN due to the attitude.",

Half way through my friend eating her chicken, she noticed a bug in her food. We immediately told our waitress and she took it away from us. They offered to make us another plate for my friend. We ended up waiting a while due to the fact the waitress said my friend's meal was dropped off at the wrong table. I'd be willing to go back but maybe only if I can't find a better Thai place.",

Their service goes down. After we ordered, they did not check on us. I ordered a shrimp pad Thai -highly recommend! And my boyfriend ordered a papaya salad and a steak plate (also really good). But his came out first and after picking at his food for 5min. I asked about my food by waving 3 different people down. Our waitress did not check on us and when my pad Thai finally arrived, I had to ask for them to refill my boyfriend's water.   Service is 50% of the dining experience. Food is great, but I'll order to-go next time. Or go to Archie's if I feel like dining in.",

I have to always order the Pad Thai first to get a general idea of a Thai place.  The pad thai didn't disappoint.  Thank you!  I also ordered the Ka Pow, a spicy mint dish which I ordered with chicken.  Not bad at all.  I wish I could've ordered more food, but I wasn't too hungry at the time.  Service was hospitable, and people were friendly.  There isn't much of a need for me to go to Archi's as much anymore for good Thai food.",

The pineapple fried rice with raisin is a unique take on a well known dish , well worth trying if you're tired of the same old fried rice. The chowmein is good but typical westernized style Thai. I like the papaya salad here but I prefer the one at Satay Bistro. The green curry is pretty fantastic-- it comes with plenty of meat, bamboo shoots and of course, flavor. I've enjoyed their tom Khar kai (coconut milk soup) on several occasions. It's creamy, tangy, and delicious. I'm also familiar with their red curry-- an important staple at any Thai establishment. The staff is polite and respectful and  the interior and exterior are both beautiful. Good place for a date, good service and great food with generous serving sizes. If you haven't already,  you should really come down and dine here.",

The waiter brings out an additional sprite along with the three drinks we ordered. We informed him of the mishap and he becomes so confused and says that we already ordered it so he can't go back and change in the order...we tell him we only ordered ONE sprite and THEN he says he will take that out of the order with the manager. If he can change it, why would he say he couldn't? It's only three bucks more but his negative attitude was very irritating and ruined a nice family dinner. My sister and I caught him throwing us a couple of dirty looks when he thought we weren't paying attention. He also tried taking away the dishes while we were still eating, without even asking if we were finished. Not only is the service terrible, the quality of the food has gone down. We always get beef noodle soup and the taste of it today was very different from before. In conclusion, I still tipped the guy but my family and I are never going there again.",

I recently moved to the Henderson area and I have now tried the Eastern location twice.  I have to say out of pure dissapointment that the food was awful.  I don't understand it!!!.  I did a to-go order for $80 dollars, and EVERYTHING and I mean everything was tasteless and not even spicy which was really strange.  I had a tasteless Duck Curry, a tasteless Pad Thai with chicken, a tasteless seafood coconut, a tasteless house special fried rice and the only thing that had any taste was the Beef Satay (thank goodness).  It had to be the worse meal I have ever had to be called Thai Food.  Every one of these dishes were supposed to be a 7 on the spice scale and they were all bland and like I said .......Tasteless.    I am so sorry to write this, but if I could, I would drive to Lake Mead and Rainbow to get back my old feelings for this restaurant brand.  Please check your kitchen....make sure they can cook and add the taste back to your food or check your cash register to see if your 7's are being printed out in the kitchen as zeros for your orders!!",

    "text": "Definitely a great Thai place, and the location is great!    First, the decor.  The outside is somewhat unassuming, but once you enter the doors, you'll be surprised.  They have live Phalaenopsis orchids everywhere, and there are what appear to be hand-carved wood decorations everywhere.  Every inch of the interior is well-designed and gives the feeling of an exotic destination.  Beautiful touches everywhere.  If it's a nice enough day, go outside to eat.  The patio area is beautiful, and there's even a fountain just outside the doors.  It's completely shaded, the fresh air feels good, and again, no special touches were spared.    Service-wise, they're also good.  The servers (should I say this?) are all very attractive men and women, and they'll smile as you enter, greet you in Thai, and are wearing traditional Thai dress (I assume.  I know next to nothing about Thai culture aside from food).  I've been here twice, and the service has been consistent each time.  Lunch specials are a bargain, depending on what you get, but the main dishes aren't much more if you don't like the choices.    Preparation of the food was not particularly fast, but not slow, either.  The dishes are nice, the presentation is also good.  The food was all flavorful.  I recommend the currys.  All three that I've tried there so far are just what you'd expect, rich and delicious.  Their pad see ew was to die for, and they used real Chinese broccoli instead of the regular kind.  And they refill your hot tea like they were obsessed.  Finally, their Thai tea was really good, and the darkest Thai tea I've ever had.    Very good, over all.  Oh, and they had a bar and stuff, too, but I don't drink, so I can't rate that for you.  Highly recommended, especially eating outside on a warm, windless night.",

    "text": "I really wanted this place to be a knock out of the park for me. With such a huge space, nicely decorated, and tons of people inside I figured we hit the jackpot for Thai food. They had a huge menu with tons of food, but none of it really looked like anything special. Many of the dishes I've had in other Thai places I've eaten at.  The waitress was nice but rushed us as soon as we sat down. She handed us each a menu and asked what we wanted to drink. We were looking around for the bar menu and she looked very exasperated that we didn't shout our order out to her right then. After 20 minutes she brought us out drinks and asked if we wanted to order. We were in no rush so we asked to place an appetizer order and order out meals later. The waitress seemed confused at this request and after we told her our appetizer order she asked what we wanted for our main course. We told her, again, we were not in a rush and would order our dinners in a few minutes. 10 minutes later another women (the manager maybe) came and asked us if we had any problems. We told her no and that we were enjoying ourselves. She then asked if we were ready to order our dinners. We told her we'd look over the menu and order soon. She told us it was ok and she'd wait to take our order..... so needless to say this made us rush.   The food was nothing out of this world. It reminded me of Chinese take out we have back home. The drinks were pricy and the waitress brought us another round of saki even though we didn't ask for it. She said it was ok and left it at the table.... only to find out later they charged us for it (which was taken care of before we paid the bill). Next time we're in town we'll be looking for another spot to eat some decent Thai food",

I had the pleasure of trying the PUMPKIN CURRY- SO FRICKEN GOOD- HIGHLY RECOMMEND. Spiciness was #5 and it was  just perfect, spicy, but not overwhelming at all. Dish size just enough for two, but not if one person is especially hungry :b   I had the PORK PAD THAI, spicy#7, I like my food spicy and surprisingly #7 didn't cut it, I recommend #8 maybe even #9 for the pad Thai. The noodle texture was a bit off, I wished they were cooked a little longer and hardened. On a scale of 1 to 5, I'd say 3.   They had some drink specials and a decent drink menu. I had the TYKU TINI- it was dry with a hint of sweet sour lime- didn't enjoy it much- so I recommend a CHANG to compliment your meal as it's very refreshing.   Definitely coming back for great curry and great service.",

When I first moved to Vegas I was a bit hesitant to try this place because it wasn't off of Spring Mt. Where I was told all the good and legit Asian food was.   After hearing from several people that this is the best Thai food in Vegas, I decided to go.  The restaurant is really nice. And seemed to be pretty legit.  I ordered the Papaya Salad with dried shrimp (I'd rate it 8/10), Beef Jerky (my favorite dish from here- I'd rate it a 9/10), Thom Yum Goong (I had better, not too good here) and the Padt Thai (average- 6/10). The Papaya Salad and Beef Jerky were definitely my favorite. I will definitely be back and order these two dishes.",

Came upon this cute little place in a shopping plaza area and was hoping they had noodle soup of some type.  They sure did, and it met all expectations.   There's a sweetness to the broth but it's still salty at the same time, great taste.  I love seafood so I naturally got it with seafood. I do wish that the noodles was a different type but i love all noodles so can't complain too much. The surprising thing in the soup though was the vegetables.  I believe it was ong choy, which is my favorite vegetable ever and it's not something that is usually served unless you specifically order it so when I saw it, it was just heaven in a bowl.   Another great thing is that the prices are very reasonable.  I was full and didn't feel like I overpaid so I was really happy. Not to mention if you want a drink they have tons to choose from, they have a whole separate bar area! :)",

I asked for not too spicy and this place definitely follows the not too spicy level. Thank goodness! Overall, food was delicious as usual and even better with the jalapeno sauce.

    "text": "Overall: Pin Kaow Thai serves decent Thai food, and it has cute decor. However, they need to train the servers to better solve problems like food mix-ups.  Food: 4  Chicken Pad See Ew was pretty good. The noodles had a slight char and it wasn't too oily.  Yen Ta Fao is a noodle soup dish. It was slightly too sweet for my taste, but it is definitely bursting with flavors.  Garlic Sea Bass: This tasty fish dish comes with rice. The fish is cooked beautifully and the sauce goes well with it. However, it is slightly pricy at $25.  Panang Curry with Beef was pretty standard. I believe we got a 4 or 5 on the spice scale and it was tolerable to a spice wimp like me.  Service: 1  I've been here twice and service is pretty good if there are no problems. Servers are attentive and patient. However, I have to give a low rating because of how our server handled a food mix up during my second visit.  We ordered Panang Curry and Pad Thai with fish. When our food came out, we didn't immediately realize we had the wrong dishes as they brought out a curry dish and a fish dish. The waitress charged us the price of the fish dish given to us ($25) even though she had assured us that she would just charge the price of our original order ($15). To make matters worse, she actually had the gall to ask us if we wanted to pay for our original order ON TOP of the two dishes that we were already paying for since the kitchen had already made it and would just toss it.  Thankfully, the manager was able to solve the problem and charged us for our original order.  Ambiance: 5  The restaurant is large with nice wood decor, and it has both indoor and outdoor seating. It is more upscale than your usual Thai eatery, and it's a good place if you want Asian food in a nicer setting.",

The interior was way more ornate than I was expecting, but it is very nice. The furniture is mostly carved wood and there are several Thai ornamental decorative pieces too.  Service was also extremely attentive and friendly, with everyone in Thai attire.  Prices were neither inexpensive nor expensive, and portion sizes were decent. My Pad Woon Sen had quite a generous amount of pork.  Overall, I enjoyed my food, especially the fried soft shell crab, though the green papaya salad was very light (I would have preferred more peanuts, more spice, and more fish sauce). Additionally, they have a 1 to 10 spice scale and I ordered my noodles 5 out of 10 and it barely registered any heat, so maybe order higher numbers if you like spicy.",

As someone who needs to eat gluten-free, the menu is limited here. I was only able to order yellow curry. It was tasty, but I felt that I've had better elsewhere. My boyfriend enjoyed the Thai BBQ chicken very much. It came out sizzling on the plate and looked delicious. He told me later on that he was still thinking about it and felt it was the best he had eaten in a while. We will probably go back, but I might order the curry at a spicier level just to make up for the bland base.   Overall, while it's not my new favorite Thai restaurant, it's not bad either. The ambience of the restaurant is very Southeast Asia. They use dark wood throughout and incense to create the feeling that you are in Thailand. There is a nicer garden-like outdoor patio as well.",

I escape from the desert... feeling like I'm in another country, totally dismissing the fact that I'm only in a little shopping plaza in Henderson.  All of the food we ordered was great.   Some items such as the yellow chicken curry, I have had better elsewhere... but only based on preference.  The dish was still very good and satisfying. I wasn't used to how it was more coconut creamy than curry.  The Tom kha soup is served in a heated pot so you aren't in a rush to finish it.  I like that! This item was better than most i've had elsewhere.  The Thai tea was on point!  I wanted to order dessert, but I was so full trying to finish everything we ordered.  It definitely didn't go to waste... leftovers were just as good!  Service was very good! Thank you! Will be returning.",

I called in my order as soon as hey opened at noon and my order was ready within 15 minutes, as promised.   The interior of the restaurant is super cute. We went to Thailand for our honeymoon, so Thai food hold a special place in my heart, I mean belly. Lol. I like for just a moment as soon as you walk in- you feel for a second that you are in Thailand, great decor! I noticed that they have an outdoor patio with a few tables, but it's not dog friendly so no dogs allowed.   So let's rate the food:   Beef Pad Thai: 4 Stars, nice and saucy in all the right places. Peanut crumbles on the side with many thin slices of beef. Pretty tasty, at a level 8 spicy level.   Green Curry (beef)- 4 Stars. This dish is tasty and soupy with a spicy kick.   Mint Beef: 3 Stars. Meh. I didn't even want thisc I ordered basil beef fried rice. She must have not heard me over the phone.   I would definitely return in the future, for some Pad Thai and green curry. They rate their spicy level from 1-10. All of my items were level 8 today and yet I still put extra chili sauce on top- meaning level 8 is not that spicy. I shall do 10 fsure next time!",

The shrimp was overcooked so not too happy about that either. However,  unlike Thailicious, this place gives you plenty of shrimp!!! Their spice level is not that accurate either. I asked for an 8 out of level 10 of spiciness and to me compared to other thai food places, I would say that was a spicy level 3 which I didn't even taste it. The restaurant itself is nice and beautifully decorated for a thai restaurant.",

If you want a real taste from Thailand, this one is the closest you'll get. The place is small and very quaint compared to other Thai restaurant. But the style of the place reminded me of a vintage noodle shop in Thailand. If you are going to Thailand soon, test your taste buds here.",

    "text": "Pin Kaow reminds me of when Thai food used to be considered exotic and adventurous. Nowadays Thai food is on every corner- at least in Las Vegas.  I do love the decor of the restaurant. It has a lot of wooden architecture. The staff even have cute Thai outfits.  I've been here a couple of times and this is such a solid Thai establishment I'm glad to have in the valley. In terms of flavor and recipes they are the real deal. I like the elevated experience they give off. A lot of Thai places tone down the spice to appeal to a western palette but they go for it here and I dig it.  The food here is very good. Their salads are well balanced. The tofu salad with cashews is something I can eat everyday. They have really good curries also. Their menu is very large. Their prices are fair. Their service is consistently good.  I feel like there's so many Thai restaurants in town That they're kind of a dime a dozen and there's not much to say about them. I feel like Pin Kaow is definitely one of the better places for Thai food in Vegas.",

I have to say that they do all dishes justice.   i usually order their chili mint noodles (drunken noodles) with protein and extra eggs, extra spicy. i also like their take on the thai bbq chicken (comes on a sizzling hot plate) and their fish (steamed garlic sea bass) is not too shabby.   everything on their menu is quite good overall and has uniformity with subtle flavors and the quality you get for the price definitely matches. the staff is nice for the most part and they are accommodating from my experiences. definitely wanted to express that this is a good spot overall with nice ambiance, friendly service for the most part, & consistent food quality.",

I wanted a booth, but hey, it was Friday night and we did not have reservations.  We sat at a table in the corner but the table next to us was quite loud and the staff was kind enough to move us and they found a booth.  We started with the Edamame, a fried soft shell crab on cabbage and a Nam Kao Tod.  For the main course I had the Seafood combo Pad Thai and my guest had the Chicken with Mixed veggies and garlic sauce.   The food and service were great. Only a few of comments:  They had red snapper and sea bass on the menu but it was cooked only 2 ways; deep fried or steamed. I would have ordered it if the fish were available pan fried.  The seafood in my Pad Thai was great but they used imitation krab. I would have gladly paid extra for real crab.  I am on a medication where I can't eat spicy food like I usually do. They ask you what level I wanted the heat at in the food. I told them \"2\" but it came out more like a 5 or 6. If you don't want spicy, I would just tell them zero in the future.",

    "text": "I came around dinner time and it's so convenient how Pin Kaow is right next door to Crepes Expectations. The indoor lighting seems a bit dim, but I guess that's how it should be when creating an intimate atmosphere. The entrance is appealing; when you walk in the first thing you will see is a beautiful resemblance of a Thai temple structure with an embed sign that says \"Welcome To Thailand.\" To the left side is a standing menu board with their Special of the Day. There are plenty of seating. You can literally come as a big group or choose a table booth for two.   The Chicken Curry Puff ($7) is a popular item on that list that is a must try. It come as a set of four puff pastry filled with minced chicken, potatoes, curry powder and serve with a sweet cucumber relish. The pastry is so soft and buttery, the chicken curry filling is flavorful, and when you add different spice sauce, it just elevates how good it taste.   For entree I went for the Pineapple Fried Rice ($14.95). I let my server Attaya know that I have sensitivity to heat and didn't want my meal to be too spicy, so she suggest I opt for either 3 or 4 spice level. She even offered to set aside some spicy sauce just in case I need to add more. Also I notice the menu says it has shrimp but that's something I request to omit. Once the Pineapple Fried Rice was ready, it's delivered steaming hot inside a real pineapple. The rice is sauteed with fresh cut pineapple chunks mixed with chicken, curry powder, raisins, cashew nuts, scrambled egg, diced onion, tomato, and scallion. The fried rice tastes savory and delicious. I love how both appetizer and entree dish come with a string of fresh carrot, red beet, and garnish with cilantro. It's a nice presentation.   Usually I will go for the Mango Sticky Rice as it has always been a favorite treat. But for this dessert I choose Sweet Sticky Rice with Coconut Ice Cream ($7). The other server Zoey has done such a nice job making a heart shape. The sweet sticky rice is serve with a warm coconut cream and the coconut ice cream is a sweet complement. I can't help but smile every time I get sweet sticky rice, I'm not sure why but this dessert makes me happy.   As for the dining area, it feels romantic. The music sound is soft and you can carry a good conversation with the person next to you. Personally, I enjoy this kind of intimate ambience where the music flows calmly and it's just soothing to listen to. They were playing a slow tempo acoustic of \"Dancing In The Dark\" followed by a duet version of \"Despacito,\" and it is just lovely to hear. Overall the food presentation, earthy decor, and the nice personal touch in service is outstanding. The people are so courteous and the meal taste wonderful. I am definitely returning to try new things on the menu.",

Got medium spice and it was quite spicy! Boyfriend got chicken pad thai, also delicious.  Price is very reasonable. About 9 for each entree, enough for two to share but since it was soooo good, we didnt!",

    "text": "This is my little spot that I go to for lunch with my mom. Today we ordered papaya salad with fresh, grilled shrimp, the lunch fried tofu pad thai with soup, fried wonton & spring roll with sweet chili sauce, and the regular pad se ew with beef. It was soo good, the server told us that on the papaya salad a '7- on spiciness scale' is equivalent to a '9 or 10' for a regular entree dish. She said it was because papaya salad is one of the more spicier dishes they have. It was perfect for us because we are korean and we like our food with a kick. If you look at the dinner entree dish- pad se ew and compare the quantity with the lunch pad thai is the same. The only difference between the two dishes was the appetizers like the soup, wonton, and spring roll that comes with it for $2 cheaper! What a fab foody find!!!!!",

The service is always decent at the place, they are good about filling water and checking on you without being intrusive.  His mom and I both got Chicken Pad Thai- I got a 5 spicy, she got 0. He got something veggie, I can't remember.  Their pad thai is consistently good- it's really hard to screw up though. She really liked it and we'll keep coming back. It's a convenient location, good service, and never super busy.",

The ambiance was relaxing and very quiet, we had to keep telling our kids to whisper and use inside voices. We ordered the Tom Kha with chicken and it was amazing I could have gone with more spice in the soup but I never know how True to scale the 1-10 hotness scale is so I played it safe at a 5. We also had the Chicken Satay. It was pretty typical run of the mill Satay- it was very good and what we expected. For entrees I ordered the Duck Curry which was great! It had pineapple in the sauce which I surprisingly liked. At a spice level of 6 it was perfect. It had alot of meat too which is rare when ordering duck in a curry. My husband got the barbeque chicken and the presentation was fun. It came out sizzling on a platter served with white rice. One downside is there is no kids menu but we were able to share with them and make it work. Overall we had great service and food.",

They have the hot sauce rack and you can add your own.   I like is spicy and their food is indeed spicy.   Chicken with yellow curry, was probably one of the best I've had.    Shrimp covered with cream cheese, breaded and fried.   How can you go wrong?  Super good.  All the soups were good, our whole table enjoyed the won ton, lemon grass and coconut soup.

I enjoyed their crab ragoon which was pretty big in size. and this dish that is similar to pad thai, drunken noodles?, was really good, and of course, other entrees. The first time my boyfriend and i dined here we weren't too happy, but now that we know what to order, I would recommend this place. Food can get a bit pricey. Like the crab ragoon was 10 bucks and you only get four, but it's so good you would want more.",

The Best of LV award posted provided some initial comfort as to our decision. The ambiance is good but I would probably prefer takeout in the future. The service is okay but a number of different people worked the table including three to process our payment? The server seemed a little irritable or put out. I mean I only needed a new fork. As for the food, I thought the Crab Rangoon appetizer tasted like cream cheese only...wheres the crab? The Pad Thai with shrimp, medium and Yellow Curry with chicken medium were good. I will return to the Kaow for the curry...takeout.",

    "text": "I've been to this particular location many times over the past couple of years. I'm sad to say the quality of their food is deteriorating and their customer service is sub par. The last few times I've been there I've noticed the service was extra bad: our food wasn't cooked properly, staff didn't check on us, instead we had to flag them down to get our order taken. We kept going back because it was the only Thai food place around the area that we knew of.   Today I walked in to pick up an order. I've done this many times using my boyfriend's debit card without an issue. On this occasion the lady ringing me up, which I believe was a manager, asked to see my ID. I kindly told her that the debit card didn't belong to me, that it belonged to my boyfriend. She asked me for his ID, I repeated my self and added that I didn't have his ID. She stared at me blankly for a few seconds then told me she couldn't take the card. As I was telling her that I've been there many times to pick up orders using that card a waitress came over, interrupted me mid-sentence and told me, \"We just changed our policy, it's a new policy!\" and she walked away. I'm not sure why she felt the need to interrupt me mid-sentence and talk to me in a rude tone. It's not like I was being rude or making a scene. There's a fairly quiet ambiance in this restaurant so I know to keep my tone down. And I wasn't being rude at all. I was going to ask if they could save my order so I could go get cash and come back but after the way the waitress spoke to me, I just had it. I said thank you and left.   I vow never to go back. The service and quality keep going down but the prices stay the same, and they are pricey. I was starving when I got home. Then I remembered there's a place down the road from my house called Sakun Thai, we went there instead and it was GREAT! Food was delicious, the prices we're very inexpensive and all of the staff we interacted with was really friendly. So glad we decided to try out this other place, they totally turned my day around.",

Their outdoor patio is gorgeous.  Every plant and all the flowers are real.  Beautiful orchids even those in the bathroom.  They had a wonderful hand scrub in the women's bathroom that they sell.  It leaves your hands very moisturized and refreshed.  The food was delicious.  The best tom yum kai I've ever had.  I had my typical order of red curry and pad thai, which was pretty good as well.  That soup I have still been craving for days.  I wish I got the hotspot so I could'be taken it home.  I believe we were there when the lunch staff was either about to leave or take a break because the initial staff was very helpful and always checking on us, but when we were about to pay for our check we didn't see them at all and the rest of the staff ignored us.  Lastly, the price is great considering the quality of the food and the whole atmosphere of the restaurant",

My bf wanted to start with soup, they never brought it, and when they brought our entrees the server left so quick we didn't have time to ask them about it.   Of course no one came to check on us after (my drink was also empty the whole time).When finally they came when we were both done, they said that they accidently brought the soup to the wrong table.. ok.. why wouldn't they take a min to figure out who the right table was?!Another time they brought me the wrong entree, and then it took them over 20 min to find change for us when we paid. Don't even let me get into the time they totally forgot about us sitting on the patio...  I really wish the staff would get their act together, because the food is really good.

I had the red curry with chicken and rice...really delicious, nice and spicy, and the small carafe of sake. The service was great also...the staff was really attentive to our needs.  Since I was blown away by the service and the food, I took my family there the week after during lunchtime, thinking they would be impressed by the decor and service. BOY, was I wrong. My parents are already picky when they eat out, and the staff did not help their perception of the restaurant. Service was INCREDIBLY slow, even though the restaurant wasn't crowded. Our waitress had quite an attitude on her. At one point, my dad tried to signal her to our table and she barely looked at us and told the busboy to come over and help us out...WTF? Also, they charge 3 bucks for thai iced tea...which I think is kind of steep...plus no refills.   I'm going to have to say that my favorite Thai place is STILL King and I on Windmill and Pecos. This restaurant definitely got my hopes up, but then dashed them just as quickly.",

    "text": "Food mostly great, service not so wonderful.  I visited here one evening with a companion.  We had never been here before so we joked as we approached the door about how we'd probably be stared at as we walked in, dressed as we were in t-shirts and casual pants.  When we opened the door, BAM - everyone was indeed staring!  That's because the entertainment -a woman playing a stringed instrument and singing-  was seated on a bench in the lobby right in front of the doors, commanding everyone's attention.  This was a rather disconcerting \"welcome\" that had us laughing later at our table.   I feared that the place would be way too expensive, given the decor and the entertainment, which included a Thai dancer, but the meals were moderately priced, around $10 to $15.  The specials, however, were in the $20 range, and special bar drinks were $10.  I had the Tom Ka Khai for an appetizer, and it was delicious, with layers of interesting flavors. It wasn't as polished, nor as pretty, as the Lotus of Siam's version, but very, very good.  My companion raved over it, as well as over her chicken satay appetizer which was very, very tasty and succulent. MMMM!   She also enjoyed a martini, which was very prettily attired in a flower and a slice of citrus, and sprinkled with what appeared to be a little shaved ice.  My friend ordered the red curry with shrimp, and when it arrived she knew at once that the shrimp was overcooked by its appearance. It was indeed very white and a bit rubbery.  My masaman was quite tasty, though (my companion loved it as well), although a couple of the potato chunks were a tad undercooked. I enjoyed the meal quite a bit overall.    Being who she is, she set her plate aside in the hope that she would be able to get a different dish instead, otherwise she would ask for it to be boxed to take home.  When the waitress  caught her eye my friend told her that she felt her dish wasn't flavorful and that the shrimp was overcooked, but that she loved everything else she had tasted.  The waitress immediately offered to substitute another meal, which my friend accepted.  The waitress then brought over the manager.  Manager asks how meal was.  Friend repeats story. Manager offers substitute. Friend accepts.  So... some time goes by and no waitress.  The manager wanders by and my friend asks her if the waitress will be coming back. The manager says the waitress is busy with another customer.  She looks towards the back of the restaurant and then has a second thought, and offers to take the order herself. My friend orders the chicken fried rice.  The order arrived but the waitress was now quite subdued.  I didn't make much of it (I hate conflict- I usually don't even send meals back) but I did notice that she never came back to check on us, didn't have a smile for us when she walked by, and was showing that she wasn't happy with us.  Since my friend was quite polite about the whole thing and there had been no obvious rancor I was a little surprised about the waitress' change of demeanor and lack of good service.  Luckily other staff were very friendly and handled duties. I was able to get a Coke from the bartender when he came to ask if my companion wanted another martini.  The strangest thing was when I got the check. The waitress just plopped the check on the table and, chin up, whipped away from us so quickly it startled me.  I usually don't notice subtle displeasure, but this was over-the-top rude, and made my friend angry enough to refuse to leave a tip.  (Me being a wimp I would have left her maybe 10%).  Sigh.... So, the food was very flavorful except for the shrimp dish and a couple of undercooked potatoes, but I really enjoyed the flavors. The live Thai entertainment created an interesting cultural atmosphere. I found the restaurant to be clean, nicely designed and comfortable. I thought everyone was pleasant except for our waitress during the last half of the meal. I'd give the place a 3.5 to a 4, but my companion does not condone unprofessionalism when one pays for a service, so she would give it a 2, so I'm rounding my score to a 3.  Both of us might be willing to try this place again, just based on the fact that the food that we did like was awesome, and the staff, other than our waitress, were friendly and professional.  Personally, I think most people would have a good experience here despite my own adventure.",

    "text": "The problem with Pin Kaow 3 is mostly one of inconsistency--the hallmark of a mediocre restaurant. I've had one 2-star dinner, one 3-star dinner and one 1-star dinner at Pin Kaow 3, all having ordered the same exact meal, tofu panang. This time around, after an astoundingly bad 1-star dinner, I felt compelled to put in my two cents and warn the internet.  I've had very, very good panang curries via Archie's on the west side and Komol on E. Sahara Avenue. It's my favorite Thai dish and I've cultivated a pretty discerning taste for it done right. Pin Kaow 3 can't seem to do much right here. This time around, the green beans in the panang were severely undercooked; the curry sauce almost nonexistent on top of being watery, bland and flavorless (we requested a level \"5\" on the 1-10 heat scale and got nothing near medium heat); not to mention the fact that we had to pay an extra $2 to have broccoli, mushrooms and bamboo shoots added to the meal. For an extra $2 worth of vegetables (which places like Komol load your plate with happily, at $8.95 a plate for tofu & veggie panang), Pin Kaow delivers a mediocre, overpriced ($12.95 for about a cup and a 1/2 of curry) dish--not to mention the fact that your pricey $2 veggies consist of about two stalks of broccoli, four small mushrooms and a some shards of bamboo shoots. Very disappointing. I'm done giving chances to a restaurant that--no matter how convenient the location--can't deliver consistently good, reasonably priced Thai. There are too many other restaurants that can and do, easily.",

    "text": "We had dinner the other night and was pleasantly surprised in every aspect. The facade is nothing special on the outside, but once you step in the decor is very exotic. Rich dark wood everywhere and detailed in Thai culture. A little modern and traditional mixed together. My wife had the two servings of the Thai Ice tea, which was much better than we've ever experienced. I tried some Thai beer, first was Chang and it was really good. Then I tried Sing-ha and didn't like it as much. (Next time I'll just stay with \"Chang\" beer). We ordered the Satay appetizer and they were fantastic! What kind of sause is that? it's GREAT! Then came the Masaman curry and my wife had another curry dish. Both were very nice and no complaints at all. I'm not a vegetarian, but I ordered tofu in my curry and although I liked it, I'll go chicken next time.  A side note about the potatoes in Thai dishes, I've been to a few Thai places and they all seem to have undercooked potatoes. One place was nearly raw, BUT I have a feeling this is the way it's suppose to be served. I\"ll have to ask one day, but three Thai restaurants all serving undercooked potatoes?  They also have a fairly extensive wine list and with lots of variety. Certain wines go well with Thai foods and their selection is impressive and surprising in it's variety. Dom Perignon? Opus? yep, they got it!  Overall a nice experience and we'll be back for sure. Good food and up scale decor. Nice!",

Luckily, everyone I've introduced to Pin Kaow loves it and no one refuses my requests to return.   The decor and patio are well worth mentioning, but the food takes center stage here, baby.   I have not had a dish I wasn't blown away by. And they always manage to get the spice just right on the 1-10 scale.   I highly recommend the chicken and/or beef satay appetizer. I could eat this stuff all day long. The war wonton soup is spot on and comes with its own sterno on the table to keep it hot.  I've had the pad thai, the chili mint noodles (one of my faves) , and the pad see ew, which is stir fried rice noodles with Chinese broccoli and egg.   And they save the best for last...the sweet rice and mango is killer. I didn't think anyone could come close to Lotus of Siam on this one, but I think it's a tie!   There is no doubt as to why this restaurant is always busy.",

I could only eat half of the Pad Thai I ordered, so I had them box it up for me to go. I took it home & ate the rest of it the next evening for dinner. As I was eating, I bit something really hard. I spit it out & I noticed it was a small diamond! It chipped my tooth a little bit. I was shocked & disgusted. So I didn't go back. Well, a little over a year later I thought I would try it again & shrugged the first encounter off as a freak accident. I ate there a couple times with no problem, food was very good. Well I ordered take-out from them a couple weeks ago (Pad Thai again) And I was eating it & AGAIN bit in to something hard. So I spit it out. This time it was a broken piece of a plate!! I have no clue WHY I keep finding things in my food! It is disgusting & the cooks need to pay better attention when they are cooking. I will NOT be going back here again even though I like the food. The act of eating something & finding a foreign object in your mouth is beyond acceptable. Do not go here. If it has happened to me TWICE. I am sure it has happened to many other people. I chew my food really good before I swallow & some people who eat faster might have swallowed these items without knowing. Gross.",

We also order chicken pad Thai and beef fried rice.  Lunch portion can be a hit or miss....really depends on who's cooking that day. Our first time here...our lunch portions were satisfying.

We saw CafeZupas on the way and lamented not going later  The larb...too sad to even count on. Ended up taking it home, only because I dont like wasting food. Anyways, took it home and added the missing mint, extra cilantro, and roasted ground rice that every good Thai larb dish has.  I'm always weary of Thai places that are \"too-Thai \" the ambience, the servers in Thai silk dresses. In Thailand they don't even dress like that except on marriage or a special day. Definitely not at a restaurant. The tamarind/cashew shrimp was palatable.  Not sure how much tamarind was in at all, but sounded good.  I spoke Thai to the server, AFTER the food was served . I don't look Thai at all, so maybe it was my kind way of saying \" Did you really just try to serve me this?\" Usually speaking Thai to the server is a prerequisite before ordering. To let them write the order in \" Thai style for Thai person\".........   I guess it was my fault for being served sauteed hamburger meat with minor seasonings.   You lost your touch Pinkaow. I hope you get it back so we can make this place our top Friday night dinner spot like we did, before you became 3 locations........  Mai Pen Rai. This review is for original on Rainbow/LakeMead",

    "text": "I have had thai food from 3 or 4 places here in Vegas, and I think Pin Kaow is by far the best.  I'm confused by some of the reviewers who said that they have received rude or poor customer service, because every time I go here, the staff are all extremely polite, friendly, and courteous, even when it's really busy and stressful for them.   The chili fried rice with beef is probably my favorite fried rice of any Asian restaurant that I've been to in my life.  All of the other entrees are very good as well, love the garlic chicken and the spicy basil entree.  I always get a spicy level 3, and it is still very spicy for me, but in a good way, so if you can't handle too much heat then stick to a level 2 or 3 when they ask how spicy you want your meal to be.  I tried the deep fried cream cheese jumbo shrimp appetizer, and it was good but didn't wow me, so I probably won't order that again.  The service is fast, the food is fresh and flavorful, and the price is right for the quantity.  I'll be back probably once a week.",

    "text": "What a pleasant little Thai restaurant tucked into the Sansone Parkplace off the strip. My family and I stopped by for lunch and were immediately impressed by the beautiful decor and classy interior.   Since it was a holiday, the lunch specials were not available; however, they are usually available Monday - Friday from 11am - 3pm and only $7.95 for an entree, soup, egg roll & fried wonton. What a great deal!   Since we ordered from the regular menu, I tried the pad Thai w/ tofu for $9.95 and my parents tried the spicy mint beef w/ rice. Spice levels range from 1-10: order 4 for a mild spice. The food was pretty delicious! We were impressed with the flavors and portion sizes given the reasonable prices.   The service was excellent. Our waiter, Bon, was perfectly hospitable and polite and we had a constant stream of servers stopping by to refill our water and ask if we needed anything else.   I would definitely recommend this Thai restaurant if you're looking for authentic, reasonably-priced Thai food in a classy environment off the strip.",

And this is by far the cleanest Asian restaurant we have visited in several years - no dust, no food scraps left under the table, clean walls, everything spotless. The windows, sculptures, decor and everything else - gleaming. And the restrooms amazingly immaculate.   3. The only downside. While the hostess was good, our waitress was not attentive, opting to be playful with some of her co-workers on the far side of the cash register area, as opposed to waitressing customers. At one point, we asked another waitress for hot water for the hot tea. Noting a similar review on the service, I do not doubt their assessment in this regard.   4. Neither bad nor good, the portion amount is 'right-size', no more, and the cost, not inexpensive but not expensive ~ about $40 for us both.",

Our usual dishes are the drunken noodles, green curry, and the thai chili basil dish. The dishes are not too salty (which is a good thing!), but can use a little more spiciness. We also always get the thai iced tea, which does not taste extremely sweet nor does it taste overly diluted. You can really taste the authentic thai tea flavor here! We also love Archi's, but that is a bit of a drive away from us. But in Henderson, Pinkaow is definitely our number one pick!",

    "text": "Visiting family for Thanksgiving always means adventure in dining.  First and foremost, when someone gives you directions, do your own mapquest before going.  The way to the restaurant was not very clear from my sister in law and I got lost.  We had driven all day from SD to Las Vegas and was really hungry enough.    So we went and ate at Pin Kaow since my family in Vegas have eaten there before.  We arrived late and they have already ordered some appetizers and soup.  Tom Yum, crab rangoon, and fried tofu.  We had to make sure that Tom Yum was based with vegetable broth since my partner Brian was only vegetarian and seafood, no red or white meat (pork/chicken).  Tom Yum was spicy (5). crab rangoon and fried tofu was great but not enough sweet and sour sauce with the appetizers.    Then for the good stuff, my sister gets a little dominant during this dinner and said why don't we just order appetizers, which we didn't follow anyway (she got married 10+ years ago and she still talks about the wedding reception - at a tapas restaurant).   Other orders were crab fried rice, plain egg only fried rice, combo fried rice, bbq ribs, scallops and larb (beef).  All was great.  The crab fried rice was great.  The ribs was tasty and the larb was wonderful.  Service was great although they did refill your drinks but was too fast to ask what it was.  Recommended place for Thai food.  Happy hour has good priced drinks and half priced appetizers, check with the restaurant for times",

I have almost the exact same experience as Connie J did. I went here a few times and I loved it. The food was good and the setting was nice. Not until recently where I've seen a bit of change in the employees.   5 Customers came in after we sat down. 20 minutes later all 5 customers who came in after us got their food first, including the appetizers. We didn't even get our food yet. All 5 who came after us was of course, not Asian. They wanted to serve the non-asian customers better and give them great excellent customer service. But us asian don't deserve any, we don't write reviews. Okay..  Regarding my order, I ordered a Pumpkin Curry, it was on their special menu. I swear I almost walk out of there and left, it took so long to get our food while I'm looking around and they were more focused on serving all these other customers and not us. They didn't even come tell us if our food will take longer, they should have let us know. Well, when I got my food, the pumpkin was hard, raw as if it was just chopped and tossed into the curry. My cousin's pad thai was hard to bite into. I felt like they just forgot about us and whipped up our plate in 5 minutes, it was the most horrible thai food I've ever eaten at Pin Kaow. The WORST!   I paid them no tip, they didn't even bother coming to fill our water. One of the lady, supervisor or whatever pretends to be friendly with us after noticing how long we've waited for our food. I was in no mood to joke around, I was waiting so long and was angry that I was no longer hungry anymore. I was upset at how they service us.  I felt like I was in there for the longest ever in my life at a restaurant, horrible.  Food sucks, waiting time not worth it, customer service is horrible and if you're Asian, good luck!  I left without tipping them and drew a sad face on the receipt.",

The inside decor is very nice and the staff is dressed in cultural attire which adds a nice touch.  On the tables are multiple plates as entrees are to be \"family style.\"  I ordered the cashew chicken and was thankful we weren't the sharing type or else I might have only had a couple of bites!  The portions do seem small, especially for the price.  I guess you pay for the ambiance.  The taste overall was OK.  There were hardly any cashews (my fiance had the same problem with his kung pao chicken and peanuts) and the chicken's texture left a lot to be desired.  The vegetables were good at least.  They pile on the onions which I love but my fiance didn't since he's not obsessed with onions like I am, so be wary if you're anti-onion!  My water glass was always full, so one star for that alone.  -:P  I don't drink water because I'm cheap, I drink water because it's healthy and I love the taste more than any soda.  So having constant water is a HUGE plus for me.  I might go here every now and again, but this is definitely not in my list of regular restaurants...",

    "text": "Pin Kaow got the Beef Jerky Pow!!  This restaurant is definitely better than the average \"Thai BBQ\" that everyone is so fond of.  Came here on a Saturday night, enjoyed the open air in their dining patio and enjoyed 6 very different dishes that were Thai Tasty.  Their Beef Jerky was not to be reckoned with!  It was sweet and salty, crunchy and tender, and paired perfectly with their sticky rice.  We also enjoyed Tom Yum Kha which packed a delightful sour punch, the mango salad with fried tofu was fresh, the original Phad Thai classic, the Sea Bass at its finest and some kind of shrimp with fried garlic which passed the test.    The service here was exceptional.  All staff were costumed with Thai Garments, the decor had that Far East Flare, both which boosted the restaurants authenticity.  I recommend this place to anyone who needs a hunger fix.  I'll definitely be making my second rounds!",

    "text": "I have been here many times because their food is delicious. I love their Pad See Ew, their coconut soup, their curry, and I their beef salad. Their service has always been great, but for some reason today it was different. We came in and sat down at 2:50pm. Five minutes after we ordered, the lady came back and said it was last call. When our food came out, we asked what she meant and they told us that they closed from 3pm-5pm, but that it was only the kitchen and that we could still eat. Not even 15 minutes later, we were asked if we wanted boxes. We didn't sit for even an hour and were approached 5 different times, making us feel rushed to leave. The last straw was when a lady dressed in shorts with her purse across her chest (we didn't even know she worked here), came over and said, \"You know we close at 3!\" When the manager came over, we explained how we didn't know they closed and we didn't appreciate being rushed. All she responded was, \"I'm sorry.\" Had they informed us before we sat and ordered that they were closing and we had a time limit, we would have left and gone somewhere else. We were looking to enjoy a nice lunch with friends and conversation.",

    "text": "So my review is judging by the food as we came and picked up to-go to take over to a friends house in the area. I must say this is the nicest looking Thai restaurant though when we came for our food.  What we tried -   Panang Chicken - this was decent, its a thicker curry sauce than usual though and had peppers and green beans with it. Just my preference that I don't like it as peanutty and thick.   Pad Thai Tofu - they give you the option steamed or fried, but I went with fried. This was actually a rather good pad thai! Definitely liked this quite a bit.   Spicy Basil Chicken - this was good, but it's a easy/ standard dish. Solid for what it is.    Chili Fried Rice Pork - pretty good fried rice as far as fried rice goes. It was interesting in that it has bell peppers and broccoli in it which I normally don't see along with tomato, basil and meat which I expected.   We ordered everything with no spice since one of our friends can't tolerate any of it. They packed me up hot sauce, dried chili powder and jalapeno vinegar which was a nice touch when I asked for some hot sauce. I like my stuff spicy!  We also got two orders of mango sticky rice and theirs was solid. It had a half mango and two squares of sticky rice per order so it was a good size. While it's a basic recipe, sometimes the basics are easy to screw up and theirs didn't disappoint.   Portions were good. Everyone ( 4 adults, 2 kids) were all fed and happy with the food. I would say dine in or take out if you're in the area.",

Food took almost 30 mins to come out and no one came to refill our waters, had to flag someone down. The prawns were barely crispy and reminded me of those breaded things you can get in the frozen food section with some sauce on it. I ordered the crying tiger (grilled steak) medium rare and it came out well done... way to ruin a piece of meat. To be honest, the good reviews here look like they come from non Asians who are not used to Asian food. There are many choices for Thai food in this area so I will not be back here.",

Pin Kaow 3 quality of food is 2 stars compared to Pin Kaow 2.   Pin Kaow 3 quality of service is 1 star compared to Pin Kaow 2.  When we request for brown rice, the extra charge price has varied from $0.50 to $3.00; that makes no sense and is not good to advertise incorrect charges.  Not cool.

    "text": "I've been coming to Pin Kaow for a little over a year and I'll tell you it is more like PIN WOW. I don't think I can say it is the most authentic Thai restaurant in the game but I can definitely say it's my personal favorite. I've been here numerous times over the past year or so and I can't stop coming back. My girlfriend and I have always gone to this place and left completely and fully satisfied.  First of all, the services from the staff is great. They have always been more than accommodating and attentive to the point where I feel like I'm being pampered. You never have to ask for a water refill, it's done before you can think otherwise. I've been there at varying hours of the day and I have never not been seated within 5-10 minutes at the most. Brilliant service, by people who seem like they actually enjoy being there.   The food, ahh the food. The most important part of every restaurant, depending on whether or not you're that person that judges places off of the bathroom. I guess, in that case, this place is also pretty delightful. Anyway, my girlfriend and I usually get the same thing so this is my opinion on what we always get. To drink, it's either a a nice cold Chang Beer or the Thai Milk Tea. Both delicious and both delicious. I think I said delicious twice *smugface*  We always order the Chicken Pad Thai, which is probably a stereotypical order at a Thai restaurant but trust me it's delicious. The pad thai is always accompanied by Black Bean Shrimp and the Mongolian Beef. You can choose your spicy level, from 1-10 I believe. I'm extra adventurous and cap out at spice number 5 and it's always just the right amount of spicy. All the entree's come with a side of rice, for you rice fanatics.  The food is decently priced and I've never felt as if I'm stretching my wallet for dinner or lunch. All of that in mind, this is one of my favorite joints in the city. I'd recommend this place to anyone, unless you're a traditional Thai person. Because I have a Thai friend and the only place you can get \"real\" Thai food is \"at my house.\" I've never been invited though, so until that fantasy happens I will continue being a proud and faithful Pin Kaow-er.",

Lunch came with a small bowl of chicken and rice soup, an egg roll and i think a fried won ton with a sliver of pork and ginger in it (not sure if that's how it was supposed to be). All of that for only $8.95. Super reasonably priced and the food was really good.  I plan to head back sometime later this work week.",

I got an American 2 for heat and a salad.  Ok. So that's not so bad. But they are using pretty booked/microwaved/frozen chicken to add to their curry...  Well, most people don't have the tongue to know the difference, but after many years of cooking many dishes I learned around the world, I couldn't let this slide. The curry actually was good but not spicy, but the chicken ruined the meal.   If in Vegas check out Thai House in Henderson. Small family owned place with owners and family cooking for you. All fresh, all amazing.  This place.. is made for people that really don't know Thai food.",

The entire staff is always nice here, and their food isn't bad.  They have a 10-scale level of spice. LOL. I always get like a 5 or 6 'cause I can't handle more. My favorite has got to be their Pad Thai with chicken or beef. I liked their shrimp this past time, but they leave the tails on. It's no real gripe, just like the convenience of having chicken or beef. LOL. Had no choice last Friday 'cause I'm practicing Lent. Our favorite appetizer has got to be their Crab Rangoon. It can be more creamy than crabby, but it's still a good starter.",

The decor in here is very pretty and it is just an overall pleasant place to sit and have dinner. There are some very good dishes here. I love the Pad Thai and a lot of the appetizers are really good. I was disappointed with my sticky rice because it was harder than usual. I think it might have been reheated in the microwave. The service was okay. Our server wasn't particularly attentive or pleasant but he wasn't bad. The main reason I gave them 3 stars was because you can get Thai food that is just as good for less and with just as good service at other places. But if you are looking for a nice pretty place to have decent Thai food, Pin Kaow is a good place to go.",

She said, perhaps you should consider Ala cart or the dinner menu for larger portions.  Her suggestion didn't make sense, more chili or less chili...  \"the lunch portion is fine, can we have the chili tray so we can adjust the taste ourselves later\"?  When the food came, my red curry arrived with a pinch of beef. Where's the BEEF? The pad thai had one spoonful of chicken, my red curry had one beef the size of a teaspoon, on a red curry soup,  the Basil chicken bowl was FILLED with CHICKEN. WHAT THE ****.

I ordered maximum spice level as usual. When I tasted it, it tasted like spice level 2 or 3... I sent it back, the curry came back cold (not ice cold but warmer cold), and it had some sort of weird flavor. I can not explain but it kind of smelled... I couldn't eat it. The service was very good. The manger walks around and greet to every customer.",

First impression of the place was that it was cleaner than most Thai places I have been to and it looked so nice and fancy. Thank goodness they had a cheap lunch special going on because the regular prices were a little higher than normal.   I ended up ordering the red curry and I have to say it was not really that good. It was just watery and lacked the strong taste of spices and flavoring that I commonly experience with Thai food. I got the curry with level 5 spiciness and that pretty much all I experienced in terms of flavor. The beef was okay, but some pieces were pretty chewy which is kind of weird. Although I have to admit that the little salad portion they gave me was decent and probably the best part of my meal. I just stopped eating after a while because it was like eating watered down curry with rice. Our waiter was good since he was nice.  One thing is that there was this lady who came by our table and took away our spoons for some reason. Why would you place spoons as part of the table set to begin with if you were just going to take it back? It also got kinda weird when she had to partially lay on our table to reach across to grab the rest of the spoons. She could have just asked us to help her out... Anyways, the spoons came back when we got our dishes.   Overall, this place was just okay at best. I wouldn't really come back considering it is located in a plaza with other restaurants that are probably better.",

First, let me say we are Pinkaow lovers, and usually enjoy their restaurant very much.  I decided to order a martini from their specialty menu and that is where the problem started.  I am a modest drinker and occasionally have a drink to celebrate a landmark of epic proportions like cleaning the garage!!!   Hey, we all celebrate, right??!  My mango martini arrived and it was all Mango juice!    No vodka at all.   I used to be a bartender, so don't fool me!    I asked our server if it was possible that the bartender forgot the vodka......he then did something that really irritated me....he asked the bartender to tell me she added the vodka and challenged me!    What????    Believe me, this has only happened one other time in my life.   I'm 65 folks, and have one or two drinks a week so this was truly insulting to me!  I suggest, if you go to this restaurant, don't order mixed drinks!!!   You will truly be disappointed!  Next time, if there is a next time, I'll order wine with dinner!",

I also had the chili mint, pad thai and curry panag. I will say the servings aren't as big as i am use to, then again the quality is also better. QUALITY OVER QUANTITY MY FRIEND. Cant wait to go back and try new dishes and get that soup again im in love. This is my new favorite Thai place !",

    "text": "This really hurts my heart to be writing a review like this because Pin Kaow WAS my favorite restaurant but unfortunately I don't think that we will be returning anymore.  We have been going to Pin Kaow every week religiously for the past 9 years. We were going there when it was just the one restaurant on North Rainbow Blvd.The service was always great and the food was even better, the kicker though, was the prices, they couldn't be beat. This is what truly set them apart from all the other Thai places. Unfortunately, I feel like  they have become more \"corporate\" like these days.As time went on I watched the prices go up multiple times and watched the portions get smaller and smaller. They even got rid of their cute little uniforms that they had which was such a nice added touch to the experience. But we still stood by them as we were always a loyal customer.  For the past year my co workers and I have been going to the one on Eastern every week on our lunch hour.   Last week as always, we went in and ordered our chicken fried rice and shrimp fried rice lunch special. 30 minutes later we got our food, at this time we placed an order for another shrimp fried rice lunch special to go. It took 45 minutes for us to receive the food. Keep in mind they only had 3 other tables in the restaurant filled at this time.  We had to ask them TWICE about the to go order in which 30 minutes later the waitress comes up to the table to tell us that the order had been placed. EXCUSE ME?! 30 minutes and 2 times checking and the order was JUST placed? The only response that we get is a shrug of the shoulder with a smug sorry to go along with it, as if we did something wrong. Needless to say, we were over 30 minutes late getting back to the office as we only have 1 hour for our lunch break.  TODAY, we decided to give them another shot as mistakes and bad days do happen. Well it just about felt like groundhog day because here we go again.  We place our order of Crab Rangoon, and 3 lunch specials with another order of the Chicken fried rice lunch special to go. 15 minutes later we were eating our Crab Rangoon with our soup that went with the lunch special that followed. The only problem was......our lunch specials never came. 45 minutes later and with our lunch break being over we got up to ask them what was going on with our food, as we were watching the other tables that had arrived 25 minutes after us enjoy their lunch. The lady at the front said that she would check and then she never reported back to us.  10 minutes later we checked on it again and they simply just handed us the bill with no explanation and no food. We tell her to pack up our orders as there is no possible way for us to be able to sit and eat as we are already late.   We get back to the office, keep in mind that we are now trying to have a bite here and there in between our patients and our food was not even sub par...... NOT AT ALL. It tasted like it had been sitting there for hours, my shrimp in the fried rice was dried out the pad thai had no flavor and the chicken fried rice was floating in grease. It was pretty much inedible. Needless to say we all ended up throwing our food out.   My co worker then called the restaurant to complain and was basically given the cold shoulder. They again were acting as if WE did something wrong. We were told to bring the food back to the restaurant (because we all have time in the world to run around town bringing food back and fourth during our work day after already being late to work because they couldn't get their act together).  We told them that we couldn't do that,  after hearing all the  himing and hawing and being put on hold multiple times she told us that when we came back they would give us 15% off of our next bill. REALLY?!? We wasted our hour long lunch, gas money and our money on food that we ended up throwing out and you are giving us attitude as you offer us 15%.   REALLY? PLEASE!!! AIN'T NOBODY GOT TIME FOR THAT!!",

    "text": "The interior decor was lovely and the food was fine; however, the experience was hampered by an absent, dour waitress, and small portions that didn't justify the prices. The wor wonton soup was good with an unexpected flavor of garlic but the portion was hardly enough for 5 full-grown adults. I have to admit though the pot with the flame under was fanciful. The lukewarm pad thai, duck fried rice, and scallops were passable but why weren't they served hotter? Above all, the spicy basil with ground beef was the clear favorite; except for my mom, who passively said it was really spicy and drank all her water quickly. The dish was oily but I used the white rice to sop up the flavor, which yielded great results.   Our waitress didn't refill our drinks until she sent someone else (she was far more jovial) to do her job. While I admire the gorgeous ambiance, overall Pinkaow fell flat.",

    "text": "I didn't eat anything here. The challenge, then, is writing a fair review without actually eating the food...  Well, I'm always up for a challenge.  Came here around noon with a bunch of tired friends in a good mood (yeah, we just had a test in the morning). We asked to be seated in the patio area, and they obliged. The decor indoors, by the way, seemed pretty nice. Kinda understated wooden interior with \"Asian\" decorations, employees dressed in seemingly traditional Thai wear (I'm not Thai, so don't ask), and somewhat quiet atmosphere, actually... no music that I can remember.  Outside was pretty awesome though. It was like a garden combined with an outdoor cafe, with quite a decent amount of plants, tablecushioned metal seats, and a surprisingly quite atmosphere for being in what's essentially a strip mall off Eastern. I imagine those lights would've been nice at night, although those fans are probably of limited use in the desert summer...  Service was fast and efficient. We didn't have to wait more than a few minutes to place orders, which was a pleasant contrast to my recent experiences at some other restaurants. After maybe 5 minutes, they brought out the soups, and 10 or 15 minutes later they had the main orders ready. Not bad for a table of 8 (not counting the weirdo sitting around without food). It seemed like everybody was enjoying their food (or maybe they were just tired) from the limited conversation that took place after the food arrived, although nobody ventured that the food was spectacular. Then again, they didn't say that it sucked, so that's a good sign.  I glanced at someone's receipt and the bill was about $10 for one of the lunch menu items (before tip I think), which seems reasonable for a quality sit-down place. That lunch menu, by the way ,is pretty handy: pick one of the standard dishes such as pad thai or curry, customize with choice of meat and I think a side (I didn't pay attention since I wasn't ordering), and enjoy. I'd certainly like to try the food some time, and it might've been today if I hadn't made plans with a friend to get me somewhere else.",

Now, I do have to admit that the decor and ambiance are very similar to many of the other Thai restaurants that I have experienced across the country.  In fact, many of these places seem to be designed and outfitted by the same person or company.  The staff at Pin Kaow is friendly, polite and professional.  The will work with you on areas of concern regarding the menu; in particular levels of heat desired for each dish.  The food is just light years better than any Thai food I have ever had.  I used to live near NYC, I have lived in Miami and Washington DC and this is quite frankly, the best Thai food I have ever had.  Fried Catfish Curry was absolutely spot on.",

After reading some great reviews on yelp we thought Pin Kaow would be a good choice...NOT! This place is a complete JOKE!  1st of all food is totally overpriced. I ordered Thai beef salad and Chicken Satay, they came out first. My sister also ordered Garlic Beef, it came almost  45 mins later...really? 45 mins? The beef was totally chewy and the Chicken Satay was pink on the inside. I was already done eating by the time her food came to the table. We thought they had just forgotten. The restaurant was not busy at all...(well now I know why).  The server DID NOT check on us at all. They just dropped off the food and walked away. When the lady finally came over to ask us how we were doing she didn't even bother to clear any of the empty plates or refill the water. There is a serious miscommunication between the servers. One lady asked us if we wanted to order drinks when we first got seated, and 2 seconds later another came to ask the same question. Then when we asked for the check same thing one lady said do you want dessert then a guy came to ask the same question a minute later. It also took the guy an additional 15 mins to return with the change from the bill.   If you are around this area and want Thai food save yourself and GO TO THAI HOUSE DOWN THE STREET!",
