They offer a large array of breakfast items: pancakes, omelets, corn beef hash and Benedicts and my FAVORITE \"HAWAIIAN STYLE\" breakfast!. (Spam and Eggs baby!!) but if you really wanna try a great Hawaiian favorite, you have to try The LOCO MOCO. Some places try to have there own style of Loco Moco such as special kind of ground beef patty or special kind of rice. Although, the secret in having a great \"LOCO MOCO\" is the gravy! Thank you Egg Works for making the gravy wondeful. Such great flavor. not too salty, not to runny or thick but just rite. Lastly, order the egg over easy on top of your loco moco. you will not be dissappointed.  Other than having great breakfast food the atmosphere is great. Nice and clean which I like. Especially, the restrooms. If the restrooms are unsanitary, than I second guess about how clean the staff is. With 3 adults and 1 two yr. child the cost of eating was very affordable. Service was very nice and personable.",

Waffles are solid, not too dense, love the veggie Benedict and breakfast burrito is awesome. Oh and endless coffee, how can you complain???! I've never been disappointed. Must go.",

We were greeted as soon as we walked in with nothing but smiles. We only waited a few minutes to be seated and were given drinks right away. After we ordered food it came out very fast, and boy was it good. I got the biscuits and gravy with Diablo potatos and my boyfriend got the French toast! Suzzy was out waitress and came back several times to check on us throughout the meal. She was awesome! It was a wonderful experience and the food was delicious.

The food was hearty and delicious. Nothing at all went wrong!   The only reason I took off a star is because, personally, I wish the atmosphere felt a little less rushed (lots of people = lots of noise). I think I would have enjoyed my dining experience if my surroundings weren't so busy. I mean, I would understand it's always packed because everything is delicious, but a normal noise level would have been nice.  If you don't mind that bit, this is a 5-star place to go for breakfast or brunch!",

I came back here multiple times and tried out different things off of there menu.    Upon arrival I was seated in no time which I am always a fan off.  After taking a seat, not only was my drink order taken but so was my order.  I always research what I want to eat before actually going to a restaurant.  I was also pleased with their website, offering an online menu.  It just makes things super fast for me.  Within the last few weeks of being here, I've tried their canadian bacon eggs benedict, prime rib eggs benedict, and the crepe omelete.  All of the above were delicious and saucy, the potatoes were to a crisp and they were spiced up perfectly.    My orders came in a timely fashion and I always pay the right amount.  A well done deal for such a tasty place. If you're in the neighborhood check them out, because dammmnnn they are tasty!",

I get that you were busy and training but it's kinda common sense to give a toddler a closed container for their drink so they don't spill it all over themselves. Other than that, everything was great. The bacon and avocado omelette was yummy and I added mushrooms into it. Their potatoes were also delicious. Great place to grab some grub with friends",

What we ordered! All was Hearty, fresh and delicious!  The portions are VERY LARGE.  Denver Omelette Cheese, ham, green peppers and onion.  Chicken Enchilada Omelette Sliced seasoned chicken, green chilies, cheddar and jack cheese folded inside, then topped with a tasty enchilada sauce, more cheese, homemade tortilla chips and a scoop of sour cream  ***By using my buy one get one coupon they deducted $15.30 from our bill!

If we go after the craziness, they are sometimes less attentive for some reason.  I always get the same thing, the Eggs Benedict, and it is pretty much perfect every time. I say pretty much, because I had to learn to ask for them to poach the eggs medium, otherwise you get a runny white, which is gross. Runny yellow, yes, running white, ewww. Potatoes are delicious!  Hubby always gets the three pigs skillet, which I think they recently renamed but he loves it and there is never anything left on the plate.   Price wise, it is very reasonable for Vegas. We always get out of there for less that $30, (20% tip included) which I feel is a good value for that kind of breakfast. We have been many times over the years and bring out of towners here, so we would definitely recommend this place.",

    "text": "Food 2.5. Service 4.  I'm not an American breakfast lover so my review can be viewed as skewed.  I ordered the Chile Relleno Omelet with a side of potatoes. I didn't like my dish because the egg was overcooked and somewhat rubbery. Also, the omelet was really thick and it had way too much bland cheese on top of it and also inside of it. And the red salsa on top was so ambigous; it didn't taste like tomato, it wasn't spicy, what was it? It was convenient that the potatoes were cubed into small bite sizes but it was definitely overseasoned; my husband didn't like the ratio of surface area:seasoning and I completely agree with him. I tried the banana nut muffin but it wasn't worth the calories so I only ate the spillage of the muffin top and ignored the rest. The coffee was swallowable but it had the typical diner taste. On a positive note, it helped me \"go\" after breakfast so it was somewhat useful.   On the other hand, the service was good. The waitress was quick, attentive, and simply put \"did her job well.\"   Conclusion: Maybe I ordered the wrong dish? I really wanted to like it, sorry!",

Ever since we've moved to Vegas, we utilized the full power of the Yelp community to assist us with finding our new \"regular\" joints. So mucho props to you all.  Like I said, the wait time is sometimes longer during the peak breakfast/brunch hours - but damn the wait is worth it. There's limited space inside for those waiting, so I'd avoid the busy times during the extreme Summer/Winter days.  The serving sizes are huge, so there's a nice \"half\" option for those of you without the hyper-asian metabolisms. Prices are reasonable and the menu selections will keep you wanting to try something new every time.  The one bummer thing is the hours. This being Las Vegas - I would assume they stay open late. I suppose it makes sense them serving breakfast food and all (they stop seating at 3PM). Their Loco Moco at 2AM would be friggin' epic.  Count us in as the new local regulars here!",

The prices are very reasonable, the staff is personable, and pleasant on the eye, and the decor screams of the house you grew up in.  The potatoes which accompany most of the menu items are seasoned with Egg Work's special blend of dry spices.  Some may find them a bit on the salty side, but most leave salivating for more.  Everything can be customized to your preference, and even ordered in half-portions for those without monstrous appetites.    Bottom LIne:  Great Coffee, family friendly breakfast spot always a great way to start the day.",

I ordered the Blueberry pancakes and they were moist and fluffy.  They had that delicious made from scratch taste, my  sister had the Mexican Crepe, I loved the chorizo as it wasn't too powerful or salty.  My husband had an omelet that was a self creation and my brother in law had the boring standard egg, bacon and dry potatoes!.. oops did I say dry.  Yup that was the only thing I will not order for myself.   Everything was delicious the table service was on point and this is such a cute place with a great concept.  Now why the 4 estrella's! well.  They are a little pushy with bringing the check before you finish and cashier wasn't very pleasant is was like I was invisible and she didn't smile.

The portions are large and they have the Best muffins, fresh fruit and their own hot sauces.  My only complaint would be. They do not accept american express and the girl at the cashier counter really looked like she was going to a Halloween party.  The makeup was hideous to a point it was comical",

My friend ordered the classic breakfast, I ordered the California \"crepe\" It's a little bit firmer than a crepe. Loaded with lots of goodies, some more than others, but all tasty. Their breakfast potatoes are very good with all the seasoning.  The downfall was the service. One person took our drink order, a different person took our food order, and a third person served us. Unfortunately no one came back to check on us to see if we liked everything or needed anything. I tried a couple of times to get someone's attention to get a refill, but that failed. With the servers, you see a lot of backs, because their standing at the kitchen counter chatting and waiting for the food orders to come out. Oh, and I never got my banana muffin with my meal. I would say maybe because they were busy, but there were plenty of tables open.",

Being that a slice if bacon is the standard unit for the word \"bacon.\" Here, it means a teaspoon of bacon bits. For a $12 plate I expected better value, especially since I declined the potatoes and toast that comes built into the price. I guess you pay for the convince of not scrambling eggs, with chicken. Also, diners like this historically, offer low cost coffee. Total came to $15.64 for the food and coffee. I just wasn't feeling this experience at all.",

    "text": "I heard a lot of talk about Egg Works from some friends so we decided we would hit the place up before flying out. To be honest here, after spending all day yesterday around the strip our group may have been a little hungover upon waking up, so what's better than a greasy breakfast?   I was told the muffins are amazing so with my breakfast I had to get one, it was pretty good, very soft and moist. I ordered the chicken fried steak skillet which had their house potatoes, cut up chicken fried steak, gravy, and 2 eggs on top. And to drink I chose to get a mimosa and water. The mimosa was cute, they served it by providing a Mason jar glass with a mini champagne bottle and a cup of OJ on the side so you're to mix it yourself. Fine by me, it just means I could control how much of each to make mimosa just right for me. We came as a party of 4, coffee was ordered and we were without coffee cups for about 10 minutes or so. When our food was brought to the table all other 3 dishes were brought expect mine, it was about another 5 minutes. It really seemed like they were confused about the orders coming out and had to get it sorted. When I did get my food, it looked great and didn't taste too bad. The only thing on the food quality that I wasn't a fan of was how salty it was, the potatoes had a seasoning on them that was good but it was a little too much and really made the whole dish too salty since it was all basically mixed together in the skillet. The gravy was pretty tasty though, and the chicken fried steak was about average. My reason for a 3 star review was the delay in the food all coming together along with the coffee cups, there was a chip in my glass that was overlooked, and the table hadn't been bused all the way so the previous guests tip money was still on the table, and of course the salty food. I wouldn't be opposed to coming back, but I wouldn't really go out of my way to do so.",

Awesome recommendation from our server. My girlfriend had a veggie crepe that made me wish I had ordered but with meat. It was that good. There was some sauce that came with it. Not sure what it was, but it was good.  We will be back for sure",

The menu selection is focused on, what else, eggs, so there are numerous omelets to choose from and you can get any style of eggs and the portions are very large and can keep you satisfied for most of the day. They also serve lunch with sandwiches and burgers.   Today I tried the bacon avocado omelet with potatoes and toast . My husband came with me and he wanted to try the carrot cake french toast. this was very delightful and we enjoyed it. He also ordered the tuna melt and it's toasted inside out approach to this sandwich is what makes it unique.   I don't think anyone would be disappointed with the menu or the service. We have been to their Phoenix location as well, and it's this restaurants consistency that we count on to keep us coming back.",

Off the strip, Eggs Works is a casual restaurant where you can get any breakfast food item from country fried steak to regular eggs, pancakes, the list goes on. I ordered a skillet with no meat and fruit. My eggs were perfect, the cheese was melted with the eggs nicely on top of a buttery croissant, Heaven. My potatoes were not greasy but well-seasoned which I appreciated. Our food came out in good time and the service was great. They have a smiley face system, if you show the sad face, someone will come over promptly to correct an issue.  What prevented them from being a 5 star place is the fact my fruit wasn't pleasing. I had a slice of cantaloupe, a grapefruit slice, a pineapple slice, and something else. Eh. I was expecting diced fruit. Also, my friend ordered eggs with cheese. The first time they came out, no cheese. The waitress apologized and took them back. The second time they were brought out, the slice cheese was sitting on TOP of the eggs not melted. If it wasn't for her boyfriend, they would have heard a mouthful out me.   Despite those two issues, I would go back. Fast service, filling foods, and decent prices.",

This is basically a good old American food place for comfort food. As such, I got country fried steak. I have no idea why they call this a steak? But it was delicious. The chicken was fried crispy and drenched in tasty gravy. The way my mom would make, if she knows how to make it. There was a large heaping amount of eggs and potatoes. It's big enough to share but I didn't. I ate it all. I love gravy. It was just the right consistency, not lumpy or runny. If you don't know where to go to eat, just eat here. Plus I got a free muffin when I checked in. Score.",

    "text": "Always a solid breakfast choice. While there is usually a wait on weekends, turnover is pretty quick, and the wait is not long. It is busy, but they get people in and out!  The menu, printed on newspaper print, is about 10 pages long, with lots of omelette and egg concoctions.  They also have pancakes, waffles, french toast, and lunch/dinner options. It is set up like a diner with very simple decor.    I've tried a few of the omelettes, the pancakes, and the french toast and everything I've tried has been tasty- with large portions! I usually need a to-go box and can make another meal out of my leftovers.  The potatoes are yummy! Seasoned very well (a little overly salty for my taste), diced, crisp but not dry or crunchy, and lots of them.  The meal starts with a warm banana nut muffin, which is delicious!   Today, I tried the Stuffed French Toast, which is like a french toast sandwich- stuffed with cheesy eggs scrambled with your choice of meat. I am sure I didn't eat it correctly, because I \"unstuffed\" the french toast so I could eat it separately. The egg/cheese/meat (I got sausage) was great, but the French Toast was just okay. It was a bit dry and thin.  I think I might have fared better had I ordered things separately.  My dining companions loved their meals- a Bandito Scramble and the Strawberry Cream Cheese French Toast. Everything came out piping hot (which I LOVE).  Coffee was great (they will provide a carafe of it so you can fix your own refills), and they had a variety of creamers on the table as well as sugar, equal, and splenda.   Service was great! Our server was friendly, funny, personable, and quick.  They have a system where you can just flip an egg (a little plastic egg on a stand that's on your table) from black to yellow if you need anything additional.  They had everything you could think of on the table, though- from hot sauce to jelly to butter to ketchup.   I left full and happy- so EggWorks met my egg-spectations!",

I had wanted to order a hamburger because I'd been watching a ton of Gilmore Girls and they eat a burger in almost every single episode. So, I ordered the chicken cordon bleu skillet. It comes with potatoes on the bottom; chicken, ham, and cheese on top, with 2 eggs on the very top. I really wanted to break my egg yolk, but I was scared to what would happen to the taste of the food. I did get sourdough bread as my side which was not that sour. I prefer sourdough to be tangy.  We did order a banana nut muffin which is famous. It was pretty tasty, and I don't normally like bananas. It was delicious and warm! The potaotes tasted super yummy! They were flavorful and nice and crispy. I would definitely go back for the potatoes alone!",

They have different skillets, omelets, pancakes, and waffles. Mmmmm my friend got the enchilada omelet I think...it had this delicious red sauce that he ordered an extra side of. Its amazing how much food they give you too. He ordered a half order and still had half of it left over. It comes with these cubed seasoned potatoes. They were good but I wasn't as much of a fan of them as he was.....although I did eat every morsel on my plate. I got the sour dough toast but wish I would have got the banana nut muffin. Mmmmm they are homemade and just melt in your mouth. They aren't too sweet and and have just the right moisture. Luckily I stole some of my friends so I got to sample them. I ordered an omelet with spinach and some other veggies I don't remember in it. The eggs for the omlette were fluffy and light and just melted in your mouth. This place is great and one thing I learned is next visit I'm gonna be a little less safe and order something different for an amazing experience. The skillets really looked amazing as I watched the waitress bring them out. Ohh service was impeccable, very responsive and attentive without that constant hounding feeling. Thanks Egg Works!",

My other half, put his potatoes in the leftovers of his sausage gravy to calm down the seasoning.  I just didn't finish mine.  They were hot and crispy, just a little too much seasoning.",

One thing that we liked was that you can flip the egg sign (which is placed on the table), instead of trying to flag down a waiter.  They'll come once they see the unhappy egg sign.  Pretty cool!",

Oh yeah, don't skip over the fresh made banana nut muffins.  They were delicious.",

You can have it 3 Way (spaghetti, chili cheese), 4 Way (spaghetti, chili, cheese, onions) or 5 way (spaghetti, chili, cheese, onions and beans).  Any \"way\" you get it, it's to die for and just one of many reasons this place feels like home.",

Upon arrival, I could already tell this was the real deal Holyfield...it was packed with a good amount of people waiting.  I grabbed a seat at the counter, bypassing everybody (really dislike waiting in line for anything)    I ordered the Chicken Fried Steak, eggs over medium, seasoned potatoes, sourdough toast.  I would suggest the potatoes w/o seasoning ( a bit salty) the steak was good, texture, crispy, good gravy.  Add Lea n Perrins and we are ready to rock!  Service is good here overall, this is a busy place w/ a good system for order caller/plater and waitress/runners.    After all was conquered, the waitress tells me about the banana nut muffins.... she gave me one after the fact to try it.  I'm not a big sweets guy, but it waas good.  This place has something for everyone and stuff for other people....for the low star reviewers, I'd say they are the others... for the masses, this should be a 5-star place!    Til next time, good eating!",

Today I went in it was a crowd had to wait 20 minutes to get a table after I wait 20 minutes we we're seated  I noticed there was two girls came in after us I'm not sure if they work there or not but they knew the cook's by name and they were asking if this cook was going to be there and everybody seem to greet them and know them so I assume either they work there. Either way after we got seated to our table I noticed the two girls got seated probably about five minutes after we did I'm waiting for my food to be ordered two other couples are waiting for their food to be order after 30 minutes one couple got up and left in the meantime the two girls who was seated after us got their food right alway nice fresh and hot one of the waitress the black waitress. Is only  black waitress there saw  some food on the two girls table and said oh no this ain't good enough for you too took the food off of their table when and put it back on the  counter  and gave them some fresh food and serve the food that she took off  there table and serve it to somebody else I'm looking at her the whole time because I had a perfect view from my table to the kitchen I couldn't believe what I was seeing. In the meantime like I said we came in before them and sat at our table when are food finally came out 30 minutes later it was cold and didnt then even look like an omelet. I talk to the manager and ask u if you can take this off of mine ticket because I'm not going to eat this. I didn't wait 30 minutes to be serve cold food when the two girls next to us sit down and within 5 minutes they got fresh hot food my money is the same color as their green there no difference, between my money and there's this is horrible service like I said I'm not sure if I'm going to go back there or not. And by the way I am black so I'm not discriminating against nobody but I noticed that every time I come into this place with that only black waitress there I'd see how she cater towards white people and don't care less about the black people she's laughing and grinning in their face making sure their food get out perfectly but in the meantime I'm paying the same way those white people are paying I want the same service they get. From now on I take my business for breakfast to Mr Mama's or babystacks are norms where you get treated the same.",

    "text": "First let me say that the food is great! I normally go to the one on Sahara. But I went to this one, and I probably went at the wrong time; hence the review. There is a reason why I order a water and then ice tea,  I drink a lot because it's necessary for me being a disabled veteran. I received my food and received my check. And my waitress never checked on me again. As I left she asked if I wanted drinks to go and I said no but it would've been nice to get refills while I was here.   I am not dumb to the game of, it's the end of my shift and I want to get out of here. And so I will remember it is better to go to In N Out Burger for $7 then to come here for $15 and not get a refill. Or as I did.   Perhaps they just have to stick with the Sahara location. The food is so good I can't give it six stars seven stars. But the abysmal service ruined the morning, afternoo perhaps they just have to stick with the Sahara location. The food is so good I can't give it six stars seven stars. But the abysmal service ruined the morning, noontime.  As my waitress said after I mentioned refills during my stay, \"oh well, have a good day.\"",

    "text": "First time going to Egg Works and let me tell you: I'm not sure why I waited so long to go!! Arrived Sunday morning around 10:30, put our name in for a table and about 5 minutes later we were seated. This place was packed though, and I quickly learned why!!  I kept it simple and ordered the classic breakfast, mainly because my friend was telling me how good the potatoes and the muffins are, so I wanted to try them. So glad I did because the seasoning on the potatoes is AMAZING and that warm, freshly baked banana nut muffin was heaven in my mouth. One of my friends got the chocolate chip pancakes, which I had a bite of... yummy!!! My other friend got some sort of chili skillet thing, which I didn't try because I'm not a chili fan.   The service was great and they have these little things that you flip the face on and a server comes by ASAP to see what you need. It's a great system and I wish more places did it that way!   So, my reason for the 4 stars instead of 5? While the seasoning for the potatoes was amazing, the potatoes themselves were dry and not the best texture breakfast potatoes I've had. I know this is little, but dry potatoes are just blah to me.   I will go back, because it was delicious. But I may skip on the potatoes (and instead pick up some of the seasoning to make my own).",

We are a party of 5...wanted to bring my nephew here because he's never been. We were seated promptly. The restaurant wasn't crowded at all. But we waited. And waited...20 mins and no one has even come by to get our drink orders. It wasn't until one of the waitresses that was tending to a nearby table turned to Waitress #2 and very politely said, \"You know that's your table.\" Waitress #2 peered over to our table continued to pick up after an empty table and turned and walked away. Quite a surprise at the lack of customer service today...enough for us to just get up and leave right now. LITERALLY just walking out...  We will continue to go to EggWorks but we much prefer the service at the 215 & Rainbow location.",

    "text": "When I was an omnivore, I frequented here because there weren't many breakfast places off the strip (in the Flamingo/215 area) and it was good enough, plus they serve alcohol.  I had family in town this weekend for Thanksgiving, and brought a party of 10 to Eggworks at 9am on Sunday morning.  I called in ahead of time and they were gracious enough to take a reservation, even though that's outside the norm for them.  Two of us in the party are Vegan (my husband and I).  We knew the menu, and knew we would need to modify dishes to meet our dietary needs, but I was disappointed w/ the lack of accommodation the restaurant provided.  We each ordered the Veggie Skillet, no cheese, no eggs and asked if we could get avocado instead.  We were told we would need to pay extra for the avocado.  I reminded the waitress that per their menu, a side of avocado costs more than a side of eggs and cheese (arguably the most expensive parts of the dish) and she advised there was nothing she could do.  Had it just been the two of us, we probably would have walked out instead of paying $15.00 each for a dish of veggies and potatoes, but we had 8 other people with us so we bit our tongues, and paid for the extra avocado.  The meal was tasty, but that's besides the point.  In addition, they offer no non-dairy milk for their coffee, so we had to pass on that as well (non-dairy creamer still has milk products in it).  Come on, most breakfast and coffee houses around town at least have an almond or soy milk option.  The vegan community in Vegas is only getting stronger, if a restaurant isn't going to have vegan options on the menu, they should be accommodating of the vegans that do still frequent the restaurant.  I e-mailed the restaurant that morning, it is now two days later and I haven't heard a peep, hence why I decided to write this review.  The next time I have a large party like this, I will take them to many of the other restaurants in town, where we can all be accommodated.",

It is sometimes hard to strike a balance between interruptions/checkins and keeping distance, but Sara has it down. I never had to ask for refills and our order was served promptly and correctly. That is really saying something as I often make substitutions and changes to menu items when ordering. Any additional requests throughout the meal were fulfilled quickly too. She was attentive without hovering too much which made for an awesome experience!  We will definitely return because for her.",

    "text": "So I literally just left this Flamingo location in a bad mood. As my boyfriend & I walk in, were warmly welcomed with the nice hostesses. She seats us at a table that still has tip money from the last customers & no table set up.   I believe we had no particular server because the busser ends up taking our drink order after seeing us not being taken care of yet. Few moments later, a server asks us for our drinks orders again. Then after that, a separate server asks to take our food order.   Many minutes later, no banana muffin or food has been delivered. I ask for vanilla creamer which I never received. They must not have food runners either because my boyfriend can see his food sitting in the window.   In a rush, 45 minutes later, I ask for take out boxes when I finally get my waffles. They gave me runny eggs when I specifically said over-medium.   After my boyfriend boxes up our food he finds a hair on his plate. It couldn't have been his because his head is shaved.   Towards the end, I asked if we could have lids to take out syrup home for my waffles. I never received them.  When I asked if we get banana muffins with our meal, the server said \"only if it comes with the order or if its your first time.\" Now how would they know if it was our first time or not if no one asked us in the beginning? As a server myself for a different restaurant, I know asking the customer if it is their first time is one of the first things you ask when you greet them.   I gave Eggworks 2 stars this time and not 1 because I still do enjoy their food. They're always busy so they should be used to the fast paced environment. We were easy customers who knew what to order immediately, did not complain verbally, & STILL tipped them. As an Egg Works fan, I'm really disappointed and hope they can improve their service, cleanliness and communication.",

Not such a good experience with the pancakes though this past weekend.....They were extremely chewy and undercooked =T  They were so chewy that they were sticking to my teeth as I ate them.  Their omelets, crepes, skillet breakfasts are all fantastic though, so this is definitely the way to go when eating here.  Their pancakes did not scare me away and I will definitely return!",

Since all the prices are about the same it makes it easy to pick what you like but by the time you add $2.90 for coffee you start to wonder if breakfast is worth that much.  Add the fact that your choice of potatoes is frozen tiny pieces which seasoning or a nearly exact replica of Mikey D's hash brown patties - yes frozen also.  After not being asked which on of these wonderful potato choices I preferred last visit , I decided it would be my last.",

They had told him \"We just opened we would love for you to come by with your families and tell everybody you know about this place\" So my mom and dad decided to go two weeks later, my sister and I also came along. When we got there we were greeted by a very friendly waitress who sat us down immediately. She took our order for drinks and food. My ideal meal consisted of milk, scrambled eggs, sausage, the works potatoes, and a banana nut muffin. The muffins and potatoes are to die for. My family comes here every weekend but sometimes I try something different such as pancakes, or french toast. Come here for a great breakfast!",

We have been coming here for about 3 years now and just recently ordered lunch one day and LOVED it.  Now we hit it up for lunch and avoid the large crowds but someday soon, lunches will probably catch on and there will be crowds.   Consistant food always quick and hot.  LOVE IT!!

The service was fast, very fast, so fast indeed that I wondered at the quality of the food. Sure enough it looks good, but in the taste department they came up way short! The Eggs looked like they had been mass produced and were pulled from one of those buffet style servers. The gravy tasted like it was canned and way too salty with not much hint of meat in it. The biscuit was stale!  The Potatoes, way too SALTY!!!! Smothering reheated frozen potatoes in seasoned salt doesn't cut it in my book! Finally the Coffee was decidedly bitter to both our tastes. I would not go there again!",

The \"Three Pigs\" omelet is amazing too. This is saying alot given then I am not a breakfast person and would skip it on a daily basis. I have also had the California Crepe. It is alright. Nothing spectacular.   Now for the sides. Almost all the egg dishes comes with potatoes which really suck. Yes, I will eat a couple of pieces but I typically give it to someone else. Another side is the banana nut muffin. It looks very unappetizing, but it isn't bad. Imagine a flat top muffin that looks like someone was tilting the muffin tray as it was cooking.  The service is typical diner. Nothing fancy or special.",

I brought a book to read, but I was entertained by the staff's efficiency working a busy holiday monday.  If you want to open a diner and want to get an idea how to do things, come here at have a meal and observe.  Without boring you with the details, the pass through window was an symphony between the cooks and the servers.  Good communication and everyone knows what needs to be done (busy work) to keep things running smooth.  There is also a good quality control.  Several times, a manager asked to have items replated because the presentation wasn't to her standard.  In some cases, food was discarded and re-done.  The Quality of service was a big reason for 5 stars.  Now, to the food.  It was good.  My CFS was a deep fried variety.  The quest to find a pan fried CFS like Eat At Joe's in Redondo Beach, CA. is hard to find.  It was a good steak.  Seasoned well.  The home fries are also deep fried.  Crispy.  I personally prefer grilled home fries with some onion and bellpepper.  The biscuit was a bit dry.  So, my meal was just okay.  The other food I saw looked good.  I would come back and try the Corned Beef Hash.",

    "text": "Breakfast eaters, look to other reviews because someone's Best Burgers of Las Vegas list pointed the way here, specifying the cheeseburger with Cincy chili, and that's the find. The burger itself is fine, indifferent, no worse than a thousand others of its ilk. But the chili. These folks get the Cincinnati approach. Tweaked with unsweetened chocolate and a bit of cinnamon (but replete with more standard fare like cumin, paprika, garlic and tomato sauce) it's a regional style that if you suspend any constitutionally held ideas of what chili ought to be, is really quite delightful. In Ohio (and across the river in Kentucky) you can have it 3-Way, 4-Way or 5-Way with spaghetti and the chili being the one and two base and finely grated Cheddar, onions and beans being three through five, depending on how you like it. Works the same here at Egg Works. This stuff is hard to come by out west, (a few years ago some guy tried to open a Skyline imitation buried in a shopfront hole in the wall on Van Nuys Blvd and folded in flash) and if you're curious to open your mind and palate to chili adventures, this is way easier than flying into CVG. That said, here's a caution for all cases: don't go anywhere expecting the absolutely uncontested best thing you've ever eaten. Take it for what it is, simple, enjoyable and somewhat different from what you're probably used to and your experience (and life) will be just a tiny bit more pleasant. Enjoy.",

The service has surprisingly been good every single time. Employees walking around with smiles on their faces. Employees saying \"thank you for coming, have a nice day\".   I have gotten the same thing all three times. Why? Because it is simply too amazing to get anything else. I get the 'Original Breakfast Burrito' which is stuffed with 4 scrambled eggs, diced bacon, bell peppers, onions, cheddar and jack cheese and is served with a huge side of works potatoes and very delicious salsa. I can finish this whole plate in one sitting but if I do I feel disgustingly full and ready to explode afterwards. Finishing all the potatoes and half of the burrito leaves you very satisfied and then you can take the other half of the burrito home with you for a second meal.  My girlfriend gets the 'Stuffed French Toast' which is scrambled eggs and sausage or bacon with cheese stuffed on French toast and topped with powdered sugar and maple syrup. And served with a huge side of works potatoes.  Yummy yummy in my tummy and we will continue to go back here every time!",

    "text": "Sheesh! I'm kicking myself for not trying this place sooner. I came across Egg Works on Groupon looking for a good place nearby for bruch.  Right off the bat I knew it was going to be good by the long lines out the door (any foodie knows that's always a good sign). Walked in the hostess took down my name and despite the large volume of people in the restaurant she told me the wait was only 10-15 minutes. Not bad. It gave me time to check out the menu so I didn't mind.   As soon as we sat down the kids got crayons & an activity sheet so they were occupied which made me happy (it's the little things that make such a difference). Our waitress was very helpful. She even took the time to explain the different types of eggs, recommended a few of her favorite dishes when we couldn't make up our minds. We ended up getting the bacon & onion skillet, corned beef hash skillet, and bacon waffles for the kids which they split (oops, I forgot to take a pic). The corned beef was great. I'd recommend that for sure. And I don't even like corned beef so that's saying something!! The kids waffles were just okay. Nothing special. Probably should've went with the French toast. The bacon & onion skillet was very tasty. I'll probably order that again. And those potatoes that come with just about every dish...WOW! They were so good. I was actually pleasantly surprised how much I liked them.  All in all, the prices are fair, staff is very friendly and the food is great. Definitely coming back. I'm going to take my parents when they are in town next month. I have a feeling they will love this place too.   Side note: The noise level in this restaurant is pretty loud which makes it great for families with little ones. If you're a parent you know what I mean",

I finally wake up in the morning I'm tired and I just wanted some breakfast instead of sleeping in as usual. I'm tired so I didn't put any make up on or any effort to look nice so I look way younger than I actually am.   The reason I'm saying this is because I got treated like a child. I arrive the restaurant is slow and I put in my order. I show the waiter what I want and let him know I wanted the French toast with eggs and bacon. Something like that it was a combo. I ask for coffee and he looks at me strange like if I really want coffee. I get my coffee it was good and my plate arrives.   I get only french toast nothing else, I didn't get checked up on and the vibe I was getting was that I wasn't taken seriously. I used to be a waitress as well and it was very slow that day I could have got checked up on and I usually tip generously. I didn't mind I was happy to get french toast and the waiter gives me my check right away only 10 minutes into my meal rushing me to leave and walked away. After that I felt insecure and uncomfortable so I ask for a box and go to the cashier to pay.   I got to pay and I think he charged me for a combo or something because apparently my french toast only costed over $16.00. I'm not sure if because they thought I wouldn't tip or because it was put in. I didn't say anything I felt insecure from how I was treated I still tipped something and I wanted to go home.   The French toast was okay it tasted a little rushed and definitely not worth almost $20 alone. This place is near my home and I really wish it worked out.",

It took her a few minutes to get to us, but i think that was because the host sat us at a table that was not cleared off yet. There was still money and a coffee pot on the table. But chris took the coffee pot off right away and got our order.  My husband ordered the chicken fried steak, it was delicious. Of course, I had to take a bite to make sure that it was not poison. Haha I ordered a BLT with avocado. It was delicious as well. They definitely dont skimp on the bacon. Always a plus! I ordered a Bloody Mary and could not choke it down. It was AWFUL. DO NOT RECOMMEND!!!!!!! But, hubby said that the coffee was delicious. So that is always good in our book!  The shoe string fries that came with my sandwich were ah-may-zing! I always like to dip my fries in ranch. Chris forgot the ranch, but brought it a little later. Which was ok because I didn't end up using the ranch. They could most definitely improve on their ranch. It was too tangy with NO seasoning at all. Yuck. (I'm a ranch snob) ;) My only issue with the server was that at the end I had a yelp check in and we were supposed to get a banana nut muffin. She told us for waiting on her because she had other tables that she was going to give us two. When we got our muffin there was only one. Dont tell your customers that you are going to give them two and not deliver. Small things matter.  I would recommend this place, and we will be back. But steer clear of the bloody Mary's and ranch!!! :)",

I didn't get toast just because of that incident.   I'm glad the waiter and food was a fantastic experience because when paying the cashier she was short with us and rude.   This won't stop us from coming back, maybe she was having a bad day!! If not hope She can find a happier place within",

But since there's no manager (the cashier is the closest thing I guess), what can you do except be grossed out?  Why doesn't dirty dining go here?",

    "text": "One of my favorite breakfast places in Las Vegas. Took my boyfriend here for his first experience and he loved it. He ordered the Ensenada Burrito. The meat was juicy and tender and was very savory. I always order the Works Veggie Benny with a side of bacon. In all the years that I've come this was the first time I've ever had an 'issue' with my food.  One of my poached eggs was over cooked. Not that big of a deal but for a Benny you want that runny yolk. I asked for another egg and the girl took my plate and said she was on it. Our server Maria came over to let us know they were working on my order and it would be out shortly. I didn't expect them to remake my entire order. I would have been happy with just a replacement egg but they went above and beyond to make it fresh/right. The manager Cherie brought out my food and apologized for the inconvenience and they took it off my bill. Much appreciated and totally not necessary but thankful for the amazing customer service. We will definitely be back soon.",

They were relatively busy for a Sunday morning but we were seated rather quickly and our server acknowledges us within 3 minutes.  I ordered a skillet breakfast, delish! their Works potatoes are cooked to perfection with a hint of garlic on them. My husband got an omelet with three kinds of meat in it. (yes, he got yelled at for such a poor choice). If you don't like cheese, don't order anything with cheese on it.  Both our dishes had tons of melted cheese piled on, which was awesome.    Service was just ok. The server never asked how our meal was  after it was brought to the table and since the coffee was bitter i wanted water. Finally had to flag her down halfway through my food to get a glass of water.  I also waited and waited to get a box for my muffin.  I'm amazed at the lack of face time restaurant managers give. I saw a manager once during our 45 minutes to an hour there when a table's order was wrong outside of that, i never saw a manager again.   I would return again but maybe not on a Sunday morning when they're so busy.  I'll give our server the benefit of the doubt and say that's why the service wasn't stellar.",

Too much chorizo..it made the whole burrito taste too salty. I would've mixed in a little less meat and more fresh ingredients than it would have been banging. The side potatoes were not bad. Would give it another try..",

We jump back and forth between the two restaurants depending on what we feel like eating that day.   Fairly standard breakfast combinations of eggs breads and assorted meats, so it's hard to go wrong with the food, but the definite favorite for me is their Banana Nut bread which is fresh made at the restaurant and always served piping hot. The service is excellent, with a lot of the same faces being there for a while now.  Highly recommended for breakfast.",

The serving sizes are way too big, but I like having leftovers in the fridge.   The service is great, too. If you ever need anything, you just flip this cute little egg over and someone comes to your table right away. You can tell it's a popular place by the sheer number of customers and workers.

Our busser was hands down the best breakfast busser we have ever had. If you ever go in, go in when Caesar is working. We have a large family of 8 people and he worked amazing with us by being very helpful with the different specials and menu items even though he wasn't a server he still helped out our family twice as much as anyone else. I would definitely recommend Egg Works to anyone who is looking for an AMAZING breakfast restraunt and once you decide yes I'm going there I would definitely recommend trying the Spinach Benny!!!",

I believe the cheese was thicker than the omelet. It was topped off with some canned or or jarred taco sauce and a dollop of sour cream. Only potatoes they had were frozen tater tots or potato \"shredded\" hash browns, which looked exactly like a McDonald's hash browns. I ordered rye toast which was some type of rye/pumpernickel swirl that tasted like neither.   I had wanted pancakes instead of the toast and potatoes but this was not a option. It would have cost me an extra $6.25. No thanks. The only saving grace was the coffee tasted good but was $2.75 for a small mug, with the thermal pot left on the table; pour your own.  Total with tip was $16.06 with a 15% tip. To top it off, they have an improper ventilation/hood system in the kitchen for I walked around the rest of the day smelling like I worked there. Sorry, cannot recommend on any level, except maybe coffee to go.",

My mom and I decided to give this place a try since we always eat at the omelette house and it's close to where we live! Once we got there we were seated immediately and greeted by a very friendly hostess! Our waiter was very pleasant and even suggested some of the top items to try and that were often ordered due to popularity. I went with the country fried steak skillet with egg whites and my mom had the veggie omelette with egg whites as well.. Everything was cooked to perfection and the skillets are HUGE so beware if you order any of those! Come hungry that's for sure I didn't finish but half of my plate! I will definitely return!",

We were told that we would have to wait about 15 minutes, which actually came to only 10 minutes, which was great. Our waitress was friendly, but would forget a few things that we needed, such as utensils and coffee.  I had asked if the sausage I ordered was indeed turkey and she took it back and had it remade without telling me that that was going to happen.   So I had to wait for my breakfast to come back and then when I placed an additional order of turkey sausage for my husband, we waited 20 minutes for that to appear.  In all honesty this breakfast just took way to long to be served and the miscommunication was the problem.  I've never had any sort of issue with the other Egg Works I've been to so I guess I'll be returning to those other locations instead of this one.  Overall this place is just meh... not really my favorite.",

The decor is pretty run down, the layout isn't very pretty. But oh my gosh, I had the best waitress ever. She was wonderful.  I ordered a mimosa, I was given an individual size bottle of champagne, along with a glass of orange juice, so I could make my own cocktail as strong as I wanted to, without anyone raising an eyeball at me beginning my day of drinking at such an early hour.  The service was outstanding. The food comes in pretty large portions, and wasn't the best I've ever had, but it was hot and good. I had french toast, eggs, hash browns, and bacon. And of course, my beautiful mimosa. My companion had chicken fried steak with potatoes and gravy.  Both dishes were yummy. The menu is varied, so even if you are a picky eater, you will find something that makes you happy.   When you go, ask for Melinda. She's awesome.   I'd add more descriptive words. But someone stole my thesaurus, which is bad. Very bad. Yes, bad.  P.S. - Melinda, if you are reading this, and I know you told me you check Yelp every now and again - I hope you won the $100 prize for your Halloween costume!",

If you're a meat eater, they've got delicious sausage links. The works potatoes are very unique and yummy as well. One thing they do here that I've never seen any other restaurant do, is serve flavored coffee creamer. They bring you a ton too, which I like since I use a lot of creamer in my coffee. Normally I have to ask for more creamer at other restaurants, but not at Egg Works!   The service here is also always very good.",

I opted for the smoked chipotle eggs benny and my boyfriend got the works skillet. I topped it off with the morning haze which is frangelico and coffee. Delicious! My entree was delicious everything came out hot and melty the pulled pork was divine. My boyfriend loved the skillet he was barely talking or breathing because he was inhaling his food. The service was fast and friendly we had multiple people check on us. Will be coming back soon!",

The place itself it about average in size so it can fill up easily. But the service was great, all of the staff were very attentive and kind. They have these 2 egg symbols next to your table one with a happy face and the other with a sad face and you flip it to the sad face if you need something and since the staff work as a team the response time is very short which is good.  I ordered the country fried steak and I gotta say it's one of the best I have had. The gravy was very flavorful and the steak was cook very well, nice and crunch with a flavorful crust. It also comes with banana nut bread which is their specialty and taste great! The only thing I wasn't a huge fan of was the potatoes which were seasoned a little bit too much so it was a bit salty. But not a deal breaker.  My girlfriend got the chorizo skillet which was a mix of chorizo, potatoes, eggs and jalapenos and cheese and salsa. It was awesome every bite was flavorful but it was a large bite if you try to get everything on the fork!   My parents got the waffles which were soooo fluffy and cooked perfectly. Add some butter and syrup and you got a simply but delicious waffle.  Our servers name was Suzzy and she does such a great job about asking us how we are so if she's helping your table out you won't regret it.   Have fun everyone!",

Even more affordable because I had purchased a groupon the month before while planning for my Vegas trip! :)  Egg Works is not located on the strip, so it did take a good 15 minutes to drive there from Caesar's Palace.   We ordered the chicken fried steak, waffles, and chorizo skillet. I've never had such a delicious chicken fried steak before! The gravy was also very yummy. It came with Cajun potatoes that had a ton of seasoning, but I like that kind of thing. If you're not a fan of salt, ask them to go light on the cage.  The waffles and syrup was also great, and the skillet was hot and cheesy. I can't wait to go back!  Tip: I loved that they are so attentive, there's an egg with a smiley face and a frowning face. When you turn it to the sad side, any employee will stop and ask you what you need. It's so great when they all help each other.  I purposely ordered a dish that came with a banana nut muffin and boy, was I glad I did! It was so hot and the muffin top made me wanting more. Luckily, there was leftovers and I ate it as a snack on the drive home.  See you again soon, Eggy!",

As soon as we walked in we were greeted and seated right away. The service is impeccable they're always coming back to ask you if you need anything and check on you. The food is also amazing the eggs Benedict is very good and I highly recommend it if you like it. The pancakes and waffles also looked very good from what I could see people eating. Everything is fresh and gets to the table right away. They also have a great yelp coupon for a free banana nut muffin which is also very good. So if you're out and about looking for a place to have breakfast or lunch and you're hungry I highly recommend this place. But go hungry cause they definitely give you lots of food",

The service was super friendly, fast, and smiley.  We had three breakfasts and three coffees for $36.  Price is right.  Momma was thrilled with her eggs benny with spinach.  She opted for fruit on the side and was all but licking the perfectly cooked egg yolks out of the bottom of her dish.  She was also happy the fruit wasn't the usual melon cop out but fresh pineapple and orange slices.  I could not resist the temptation of the chicken enchilada omelette.  Theis creative breakfast omelette weighed approximately 4 lbs. and was served with at least 3 servings of crispy seasoned potatoes.  The portion was huge! I brought half home.  The omelette had chicken, green chiles, enchilada sauce, and cheese, and crispy tortillas baked on top for a crunchy surprise.  Very good.  Nothing needed salt or pepper.   Hot, yummy, and nicely seasoned.    The leave a carafe of coffee on the table for your convenience and provide french vanilla coffee creamer. BONUS POINTS!  The decor is super cute; not too kitchy.  Little egg details everywhere and an outhouse style bathroom door.     I'll go back for sure when I'm ready for another super sized breakfast.",

The ingredients are not extravagant, but consistently very good, very well flavored. Portions are large and we almost always have to take some to go.  The staff is always friendly, upbeat and engaging, the decorations are nice. If there are ever any concerns with an order, as can happen in a place occasionally, they are prompt to address. Sometimes there is a wait on weekends, but they keep it clean and get you in pretty quickly. Whether there is a crowd or fewer patrons, the service, quality of food, and experience is consistently great.  I also like other restuarants that have a bit more variety in terms of vegetables added and creative twists on breakfast items, so they are not my preferred 5 star, however solid 4 star for me and plus my husband loves them and I love going there with him.",

Having grown up in Vietnam, I do really prefer a French first meal (Vietnam was colonized by France and thus most of us are self-admitted Francophiles) and have subjected my loved ones to French breakfasts and brunches galore!  My fiance, however, had a good ol' American upbringing in the Midwest and ate morning carbohydrates like pancakes.  Enter Egg Works: adorable down-to-earth breakfast restaurant, all themed around ...Eggs!  Even the decor is completed with classic paintings with egg-ish slants, all the faces are replaced by eggs (including the Mona Lisa).    There is a plethora of egg dishes for you to order, my favorite is the egg-crepe, a tasty blend of crepe batter and egg (perfect compromise of French American traditions).  But the various egg benedicts (called Bennys at Egg Works) are also done well, including one that comes with prime rib on top of a buttered croissant - truly a diet sabotage worth your time.   But like most food love affairs: you come across that one delight so casually and unintentionally, this was how it began for me and the banana nut muffin.  I was not really even a muffin enthusiast, until then.  Adjectives like moist, soft, warm, perfectly sweet cannot deliver the experience of this muffin.  All I can say is, just try it and you'll know love, too!",

    "text": "This place has become one of my all-time favorite breakfast joints.  I have been here a few times now and never do they disappoint.   My two favorite dishes are the stuffed french toast (it's basically a french toast sandwich with eggs, cheese, and your choice of bacon, ham, or sausage.) I usually get this with bacon and it is by far amazing. I love sweet and savory dishes equally so this dish is the perfect balance for me.  Second favorite dish is the banana bread french toast (can you tell I love french toast?? lol). But this is by far THE BEST french toast I have EVER TASTED. It's so soft, melt-in-your-mouth delicious. If you're craving something on the sweeter side, this is definitely the dish for you. It will NOT disappoint.   Portions sizes are generous, I usually always have leftovers (which make a great snack for later). The service has always been quick, efficient and friendly, though, I I've seen this place get pretty busy (especially on weekend mornings) so expect to wait a little if you choose to go then.  Their menu is pretty impressive (lots to choose from so I need to start venturing out of my \"comfort zone\" and try other things).   So for all you breakfast lovers out there -- this place is without a doubt a must-try... I can pretty much guarantee there's something for everybody!",

That being said, on the rare occasions that I'm up before 11am, I get a little excited to eat breakfast foods, and usually, Eggworks is my to-go place.   As their name suggests, they serve typical breakfast faire; omelets, breakfast meats and egg plates, waffles, pancakes, etc., but most of their menu is centralized around the always versatile protein.   My personal favorites are the scrambles, specifically 'The Works' scramble, which is a medley of 3 scrambled eggs, ham, bacon, sausage, mushroom, onions and bell peppers. Simplicity wins here at Eggworks, and their consistency of the quality of food is what keeps me a returning customer. They also give you an option of toast or banana nut muffin with your meal, but I have to urge you to opt for the muffin, it is mighty tasty.   Service has been good up to date, and it can get very busy during primetime breakfast hours, especially Sunday.   So if you're in the area, ignore the national franchise pancake houses and diners and come here, it works.",

The bad news - The kitchen missed one of our orders and it took at least an additional 10 mins before the last plate came out. The good news - our server and the manager were super cool and hooked us up with a loaf of the banana nut bread (which is amazingly yum!!) And our son's plate was on the house. They were able to turn my frown upside down with their superb customer service. I had the spinach eggs Benny, and the hollandaise sauce was on point. Big fan of the potatoes for sure! Highly recommend and will be back again soon.",

The banana nut muffin has a BIG top on it...the BEST part!!  Moist & fluffy towards the middle and nice crispy around the edges.  it's really more of a bran muffin than banana nut.  I'd call it a banana-nut infused bran muffin....except that'd be too pretentious for this casual joint.   I usually eat the top & leave the muffin.  We've been several times and there is almost always a wait...deal with it.  The food's worth the wait.  They hustle people through tho so we've never waited as long as they've estimated.  And if you're a party of 2, the bar at the back is great... the service is best there and it's not quite as noisy/crowded as the dining room where people are on all sides of you and servers are bustling around non-stop.  The bloody mary is ok, a little weak IMO, but for $6 go for it.    And I think the portions are HUGE.  Bring an appetite.    If they have the breakfast nachos on special, it sounds odd, but sister ordered them & said they were very yummy.   The stuffed french toast looks out of this world (& huge!), but I always order the Hawaiian...maybe one day.",

Coffee is good and I like how the table gets their own carafe so we don't hafta wait around for topping off our cups (much appreciated in the morning). I don't think I've ever had a bad meal there and I try to get something new every time, this last time I had their special with potato skins filled with egg, cheese, bacon pieces and topped with sour cream! Sooo good & soooo guilty :-) but hey, breakfast is the most important meal of they day right?!? Banana nut muffins are very tasty but I DO miss the coffee cake sometimes from.. Ah hem Jk   Staff is always friendly and fast. We love it!",

I don't know that there's anything bad on the menu. You could order blindfolded and whatever you get will be good. If this existed in our area, we'd practically live here.   The only downside is it's not on the Strip, so if your reasons for being in Vegas put you on the Strip all the time, you have to go out of your way and maybe you don't have time for that. We happened to be visiting friends who live nearby and that's how we knew about it. If you're not renting a car, this is out of the way of anything you might be doing on the Strip that you could otherwise walk to.   That being said, it's delicious and inviting and groups hold their meetings here so everyone will be happy and satisfied.   So go!!",

    "text": "There are many places to have breakfast in Vegas and if you're one to venture off the strip and away from the usual breakfast buffets, drive 15 mins west of the strip and try this place out. Egg Works is definitely the place to go for great breakfast. There are plenty of egg dishes from your traditional eggs, bacon and potatoes to a host of different omelete styles.   I tried the Eggs Benny which is essentially a more hearty, country version of the bougie eggs benedict. You can have your eggs served any style, I chose over medium. Service is very quick and we didn't have to wait long for our meal to arrive. The Eggs Benny comes nicely plated with country potatoes and a seperate dish for the biscuits topped with sausage patties and eggs on top. The gravy basically covers the whole dish of biscuits. I should have asked for the gravy on the side, but I was hungry so it didn't matter. The biscuits are flaky and flavorful, the sausage patties are very tasty, and of course the eggs are awesome. The gravy is definitely authentic and tastes the part! The country potatoes are tasty but if not careful, the seasoning could be a little overpowering.   Overall this is a great breakfast spot with tons on the menu to satisfy your hunger. Next time i'm in town, i'm trying the omeletes!",

    "text": "Upon walking into Egg Works, it looks and feels like any other diner. Once you take your seat and they hand you their menu which is a newspaper, you know that it's not quite ordinary. Once you get a chance to look around it has a whimsical country  farm feel that centers around eggs. Stuffed chickens and roosters here and there. Egg Works themed coffee cups and even when you need help, there's a egg sign you flip that has a sad face meaning that you need your waitress to help you with something. We never actually had to use it since the service was really friendly and great. They treat you like you've been there before after ordering. A nice 'down home' feel. One of the quirkier things is that the door to the bathrooms is built to look like an outhouse.  I just ordered the Bacon and Eggs (what else?). It was a huge plate that additionally came with potatoes (the herby fried square kind). The eggs were fluffy and took up a large portion of the plate. The bacon was nice and crisp, but not overly so. Overall, it was so much that I couldn't finish it off. We also had the Vegetarian Greek Omelet.  I love feta cheese and never thought to mix it with eggs. It came out really tangy. Besides eggs, what is the next best thing? Four words: Homemade Banana Nut Muffins. I could just come here to eat these all by themselves. I'm not a muffin guy, but these dark pillowy muffins make my mouth water.   A couple last things: The prices are really good for the amount and quality of food you get. No complaints here at all. The parking lot is fairly large, but I could see this place being really busy. When we went it was more toward afternoon, so the crowds dispersed by then. It's a place that's high on our list of places to revisit on our next trip.",

This place is not only fantastic and magical but they're crazy fast to boot.  I've never been so happy to be wrong!  -:P  We walked in and most (if not all) of the tables were full.  It was quite bustling with the servers quickly moving about as well as hostesses seating people.  Placed our name on the list, was told it was about 10-15 minutes and sat outside.  I don't even think it was 5 minutes when we were called and sat.  Cool.  The menus are newspaper-style (cute!) and there was also a special laminated menu for, well, specials.  Derp.  Service was always efficient and super-polite by our awesome server (who wore a cute egg-themed shirt over her baby bump); we were never left without.  My fiance ordered sides and she made it a combo so we'd save money; I opted for the spam and eggs and rice meal!  Om nom nom.  We also were super excited to be in a non-bar/casino-type place and still order mimosas.  Super delish.  Everything tasted great and came out so quickly, but did not feel rushed in the least.  If you eat eggs, please go here - they know eggs better than eggs know eggs.  Seriously.  I rarely ever get scrambled eggs because most restaurants make them weird - this place made them to fluffy, delectable perfection.  Spam slices were thick and the sticky rice was better than at most Asian restaurants!  And the banana nut muffin is indescribably delicious.  Just... put it in your mouth and enjoy.  Prices are reasonable for a breakfast place - if you don't order alcohol (oops) - and sure as heck beats IHOP/Denny's.  Must come back to try all the other things on the menu that sounded amazing, like the breakfast burrito and spaghetti chili!",

At first we got sat at a small 2 person table with no width but our server was sweet and generous pulling one of her other 2 tops to combine so we had room.  Some servers may have been hesistant or may not have even offered since they'd essentially be giving up more tip.  We defintely kept that in mind when paying.  As for food, we had the Prime Rib Steak Benedict which was a unique addition to their massive menu.  Rather than a standard bene, it was over their croissant which provided for an intense and rich experience.  I loved the pairing with the hollandaise sauce and spinach.    We rounded the meal out with a waffles combo which was perfectly crisped but soft which was topped with whipped cream and bananas.  We had enough food to take home to have a second breakfast the next day.  You can't really go wrong at Egg Works and the Egg family.

The potatoes they make are super tasty! Egg Works is ten times better than IHOP or Denny's.   You gotta try the banana nut muffin very yummy as well. You pay up front which is kinda odd and old school. The service is what you expect.  The parking lot sucks in my opinion though, but not enough to keep me away. All in all If you want quality breakfast eat here.",

The food and service is great... what is not great is the new iPad on the table so we can pay for our meal at the table.  Here are my 3 reasons why I hate it: 1. Very impersonal... NO CUSTOMER SERVICE 2. Taking jobs away from kids who need them 3. Ever sit at the 2 top table.. barely enough room for your dish let alone an iPad! Whoever had this \"genius\" idea should rethink it!  The cost of the iPads was probably more than the salary of the cashier! Could have bought 1 roving credit card machine and had someone walk to the table and settle the check. Oh wait... that would have involved human interaction which is the opposite of what you just implemented!",

I went with my usual, the vegetarian crepe, (see previous review) and it was as good as ever. Very consistent food here. Parents ordered the board special breakfast of the day which was the Florentine omelette and they chose the Mexican omelette from the menu. They were both happy with their meals and they really enjoyed the banana nut muffins that came with the omelettes.   Heather checked back with us several times to make sure all was well. She even checked a few of the condiment caddies from the other tables to find my favorite hot sauce. Nice! She also caught a kitchen error on one of our orders before it reached the table. Three of our plates came out and she told us it would be just another minute on the fourth because it wasn't quite right. Fabulous. We left happy and I'm sure my parents will request a return visit on their next trip.",

On this occasion, I had a buy one breakfast get one breakfast free (up to an $8 value) coupon from my trusty Entertainment Book with me.   As always, I suggested to my fella that we share a savory and a sweet dish and once again, I was rebuffed. I ordered the pork chops with scrambled eggs, my fella got the sunshine skillet and my mom ordered the classic breakfast with hamsteak. All our food was solid breakfast fare. I have never been a fan of the home style potatoes they serve at Egg Works, so I went with the hash browns well-done. The hash browns were more like hash brown patties, which I was a little disappointed by, but they were actually pretty tasty. My meal was tasty. When we were finished eating, each of us had about half of our meals still left on our plates. The portions are enormous. At this point, my fella finally admits that my suggestion of sharing plates would have been a good idea - victory!   This restaurant is great for breakfast treats, just get there early on weekends or you'll be waiting a while for a table. Service is fast and efficient. I'll be back, and next time I'm getting sweet and savory!",

I went with something I usually don't get which was the chicken, spinach, and shrooms skillet.  When the food arrived, after watching the dish die in the window while the two servers talked and slowly assembled a to go order, I noticed a surprising lack of spinach, chicken and mushrooms.  Dish was 20% eggs over med, 70% potatoes and 10% was a smattering of half raw mushrooms, spinach and chicken.  The chicken was just diced up lunchmeat chicken so yeah. For $11 a very disappointing dish.  Maybe I chose the wrong skillet but the lack of advertised ingredients was very disappointing.",

My friend saw Corn Chowder on the sign board in the lobby and ordered it.  They brought her Cream of Mushroom without so much as a word of explanation!  The worst part?

The waitress seemed pleasant @ first but preoccupied & obviously didn't get my order correct, the 1st, nor the 2nd time. Upon receiving the sandwich, it was quite bland in taste & full of lettuce & tomato more so than I'd expected, lowering the quality of the sandwich.   My husbands breakfast tasted much better than mine & he was more than satisfied, along with one of my daughters. Which are in the photos on my profile.  However, only after we left did my other daughter reveal to me that in her Fruit Parfait that she ordered, she bit into something \"crunchy\" and when she pulled it out of her mouth (I recall her quietly getting up from the table & excusing herself, not saying a word & the rest of the day not eating anything) she said she saw an eye & part of a little head.. She was so disgusted & threw up in the restroom & was so mortified she didn't know what to say or do..? She didn't reveal this to me until later after we'd left so there was nothing I could do except write a review about it. I have \"no\" idea what it was or what it could've been.. But I do want others to know..",

Their restaurant was still listed on the Amex site and they made no effort to rectify this.",

They all have been thoroughly impressed and surprised that Vegas has more than gaming and the Strip to offer. The country fries are extremely tasty. The muffins are on par with Bouchon at the Venetian. The country gravy is just perfect as country gravy can get.   Room for improvement would be: 1. Have the servers take the bill and payment for processing instead of leaving it to the patron to go all the way to the front of the entrance there there is usually a line of people trying to pay. For those of us who are busy, having a morning breakfast may be the only time we spend with the family until dinner. Therefore, it takes away from the quality family time at the table for one of us to  have to do what most servers at other restaurants already do. For those who are busy schedules and are trying to squeeze every minute we can with the family, it feels like if we were asked to go pick up our order from the kitchen when our number is called.

I want to pull the pillow over my head to shield myself from the world, but the dog insists. As I roll over to try and fall to the floor gracefully, I realize that I'm still wearing my clothes from Saturday night. My shirt is drenched in sweat and twisted sideways and my right arm is asleep.  After shoving the dog out the door, my belly growls and my head pounds. I know there is but one hope to salvaging the day. After a full glass of water and a small handful of aspirin, I wander out to my car and find my way to Egg Works.  Parking is always a bit of a challenge on Sunday mornings, but fortunately not today. I park around the corner and stagger to the door. Just inside, I'm greeted by the glorious smell of breakfast goodness and a cheery hostess. She asks my name and surprises me with an estimated 5 minute wait. I take a seat on the bench by the window and try to look a bit less disheveled (unsuccessfully)  Moments later, the hostess calls my name and I groan a bit as I stand to follow her. My table is a two seater by the window, a little too bright for my sensitive eyes, but that's not their fault. The menu is a newspaper filled with lots of breakfast, and lunch options. I choose quickly from their list of Bennies (several variations on the classic Eggs Benedict) To help easy my pain, I also order coffee, which is left in the carafe on the table should I feel the need to chug four cups before my meal.  Now hang overs are just your body's way of slowing you down so it can catch up. The critical components are hydration, caffeination, and nutration (or nutrition if you like) Egg works can help with all of these. One special shout out to the potatoes, which should be illegal due to their addictive flavor.  One other note, y'all don't have to wait until your shakin off the effects of Jager bombs, or returning from Sunday services to come by - the service is fast enough that you can swing through here on your way to work, school, DMV, voting, airport, etc.  Oh, and if your wondering, I did survive that day, though it did make me pause for a few nights before I could look at anything served in a tiny glass or with a twist top. I've probably not learned my lesson, but then again, Egg Works is always ready to nurse me back to human.",

The portions are massive and for some of them they allow half orders, a life saver for someone like me, with eyes always bigger than my stomach. The skillets are great mainly because they include the breakfast potatoes, that are unlike any other I've had. So great! I have a love affair with eggs benedict and it does not disappoint here. The banana nut muffins are a work of art for your mouth and usually warm from the oven. YUM.   Maybe the best part about this joint is the cute little egg on the table. You turn it to a sad face if you need anything at all, and the servers practically break their necks running over to you when a sad egg is spotted. The place gets busy but it's pretty big so the wait goes fast. There are plenty of TV's too, usually on news or sports. So get out of bed and get over there!",

The food is pretty consistent, though I commonly order between 4 or 5 dishes. The cooks overdo it with the cheese and Works seasoning sometimes, but I've come to expect that so I plan for it. \"Easy on the cheese\" or \"no seasoning on the potatoes\". They seem cool with that.  The service? It can be hit or miss, though more hit than miss. In fairness, I almost always sit at the counter, and if Rochelle is working, I'm taken care of. I've never had awful service, but the dining room can get really busy and the service suffers for it.  When I first started coming here, I couldn't stand the \"decor\". Sadly, it's grown on me. I'm *this* close to buying a tie-dyed EggWorks t-shirt.   My favorite part? It's a local small business. I feel good supporting them, and that's what's most important... They make me feel good about myself. haha",

    "text": "Best breakfast ever. This place totally surpassed my expectations.  Just a quick google search and we were off the strip and a few (7) miles later we're at Eggworks.  This place is cute, it feels like you're in a log cabin.  The staff is super prompt. Whenever you needed your waitress, you flip this metal egg at your table from a smiley egg to a frowny egg and someone comes running!  But more importantly, the price, and the food. I think the costs were reasonable.  I believe I ordered an eggwhite veggie omelette (came with a side of fruit and banana nut muffin/hash or potatoes). I opted for the muffin (splendid!!!). I also ordered a side of the turkey sausage (pumped they even had turkey sausage), an apple danish, hot tea, cranberry juice....and i think that's it, lol.  I did take the pastries to go, so dont judge me too much.  all the food was great. the table came with a variety of hot sauce (which is a must for me). i recommend the good ole Cholula.  They had something they must make called Habla Diablo or something (see my pics) which was just plain heat. Didnt care for it.    The fruit was delicious. Every piece was excellent, and I'm pretty picky about fruit.  Eggs were great, just enough cheese on top.  My only complaint was that the tomato in the omelette made it wetter than i'd prefer.  I really dont need to write anymore since i loved every bite. My peeps got the potatoes which were also great.  I think for my entire order it was $25, tops.  Totally worth it considering I ordered so much!  DEFINITELY GO HERE. Especially if you love breakfast.",

    "text": "EGGS!!!  Excuse me for the exclamation, but I do love eggs with a passion.  For that reason alone, having the word \"Egg\" as part of an establishment's name is usually enough to lure me in.  I can't really comment on wait times for a table, as I usually come by my poor lonesome self and sit at the counter with a magazine or the paper, but there is usually no wait for the counter.  The staff is fast and attentive, almost immediately getting my drinks as I sit down.  They have a couple of televisions above the counter, one on sports and the other on news.  Each table and counter seat has a flip egg for when you need service.  The egg with the smiley face on it (it's actually a pretty creepy smiley face, the kind of face that says \"hey baby wanna leave with me tonight?\") means everything is well.  The egg with the frowny, constipated looking face means you need attention, and the one time I had to use this they were extremely quick to respond.    Most of them items on the menu have eggs (dur), and the portions are very large.  Omelets are made with four eggs instead of three.  I usually order the Three Pigs, which is an omelet with cheese (usually order without it though to decrease the fattiness), sausage, ham and bacon, served with either fried potatoes and toast or banana nut muffin.  The Omelet itself is amazingly delicious and the potatoes tasty with this seasoning they drizzle over it.  I usually order toast, as I really don't care for the banana nut muffin.  Random quirk: The door to the bathroom is built to look like an outhouse!  Cute looking, but still retaining the functionality of modern plumbing!  The food is a bit pricey, but you generally get what you pay for.  If you live in the southwest part of the valley, you owe it to yourself to check this gem out.  PROS: Eggs, eggs, and more eggs!  Big portions for you egg lovers Fast and attentive and friendly wait staff. Flip egg so you can call for service without looking awkward  CONS: A bit pricey.  THE VERDICT:  A great place to go on a semi-regular basis.",

There are television's mounted on the wall so the wait for food went by fast. Also, the bathrooms aren't too large so you might have to wait but they are clean.

Do yourself a favor & try this place if you're looking for a new spot for breakfast/lunch. I'm in love!",

Great atmosphere, food quality is awesome. Free wifi. I got the spinach Benny and the portion is amazing. Presentation is on point and it taste amazing. I recommend this to anyone. They now serve lunch so I will have to try that out soon. The food comes quick and fresh when you order. Received my order within 15 min. And had a party of 7. Great place. And a definite must try! Pruces are perfectly reasonable too. Always will be back for more.",

    "text": "This place has better food, service and prices than the much hyped and over-rated Hash House A Go Go.  Hash House is nothing more than a tourist destination that out-of-towners feel they must check off their bucket lists due to the TV time and praise it's received from clueless celebrities visiting Vegas.  However, I bet the celebrities actually GET the service and CORRECT orders without the LONG wait times for their food to arrive.  So yes...go there if you are a celebrity...they may actually take care of you.  Locals know the real deal for breakfast is at Eggworks (or their other locations Eggworks II & The Egg and I) where you avoid the annoying families on vacation happy to overpay for their mediocre meals in exchange for bragging rights of being able to say, \"Hash House A Go Go...Of course I've been there!\"  I've also noticed the weekend-wanna-be-bad-ass biker crowd likes to be \"seen\" at Hash House as well which makes it all that less cool if you ask me.  Eggworks makes my favorite Eggs Benedict of all...The Blacken Prime Rib Benny.  I've had Eggs Benedict with plain ham, exotic ham, salmon, chicken, crab...you name it.  None are as delicious as the one these guys put together with blackened prime rib!  I wish I could find a place in Seattle that would make me a Benny this good!  Be prepared to wait for a table in the mornings on the weekend but be assured that once you are seated, your food will come out fast and fantastic!  I really don't enjoy traditional breakfast foods, but this joint knows how to make EGGCITING breakfasts with a gourmet flare.",

I'm just a little upset that I have to travel 300+ miles to go to this place. I wish this came make this place or something similar to it here in the bay.  If I'm not mistaken I ordered \"This Little Piggy\" breakfast skillet. Which contained a combination of crisp bacon, diced ham, pork sausage, and bubbling cheeses. And yes it just as mouth watering as it sounds. What I did like most was their seasoned potatoes that came with my meal. Can't believe there are no other similar places like this around the bay. I simply fell in love with their breakfast there. You better believe this spot will be a must stop every time I come to Vegas. I can go on an on about this place buy I'll save some thoughts for an update review when I come back trying another meal.  Next update will be on a new meal, service and environment (this place has a shizzzz load of flat screens). Thanks for breakfast Egg Works, I'll be back for more.",

I ordered flavored coffee and they gave me regular coffee that tasted like burnt rubber, melted into a molasses like consistency.  They also forgot to give me the side dish that I ordered.  The poached eggs and toast were serviceable but nothing out of this world. Biting into the chicken fried steak was like chewing on beef jerky that has been smothered by plain Crisco.  The best thing about the meal were the little pre-packaged packets of jam.    The decor is a half hearted attempt at country kitsch.  The place is mostly decorated with a massive throng of humanity.  I find it perplexing why the place is so popular.  Go to the Coffee Cup in Boulder City to find what Eggworks strives to be.",

No problem, she brought me a metal pot instead with a smile and was very understanding.  On to the best part:  I ordered the Mexican Omelette and it might just be the best omelette I've ever had.  Chilies and jalapenos smothered with ranchero sauce and cheese, yum!  I had fruit with it, and was happy to see big slices of fresh pineapple, honeydew, cantaloupe, and watermelon.  None of that cubed fruit that's been sitting in plastic cups all morning.    Will definitely be back whenever I'm in Las Vegas, this is my new favorite spot for breakfast.

Mugs are already on the table. And the mugs aren't like your dainty little coffee cups that you have to keep asking refills for, they're cute mugs that have their logo on it.    The menu offered so many options and it took us almost 10 minutes to figure out what to eat.  I eventually decided to get a skillet and my boyfriend got the breakfast burrito. Goodness. The portions are HUGE!! Definitely one of those, save half for lunch kind of places.  The skillet was sooo good. Melted cheese on potatoes, avocado, ham...my oh my.  If you check in here, you also get a free banana nut muffin which is definitely worth a try! I love banana nut muffins and the ones they make here are pretty top notch.   I would definitely come here again, if I wanted to get away from the strip and have a relaxing breakfast.",

She answered our questions about the food, but more importantly she explained that some customers consider the breakfast potatoes to be very salty and too spicy.    The biscuits and gravy were delicious, just like Grandma would have made.  My husband loved his stuffed French toast, and our daughter commented on the generous quantity of blueberries on her waffle.    We will definitely return to the Egg Woks, and thank you Nely for a very pleasant experience.",

This is my favorite breakfast place in Vegas that I visit everytime I go back.   I'm a sucker for Eggs Benedict and while many people have written about them, they seriously are consistently good everytime. Poached eggs cooked just right served under a nice blanket of hollandaise. It's overall the classic taste you're looking for in a homecooked breakfast.   My friends are always pleased when I take them here.   *Note: They do get REALLY busy! But you know, they also do a great job of providing service that's friendly and quick. Our wait wasn't more than 10 minutes. I say, stick around and enjoy the ambiance!! Much better to hang out for a table than drive around in the desert sun looking for some place that will compare....and it's going to be a while before you find that place. :)",

Family-friendly casual style dining that post-Jager bomb college kids can also appreciate. Really enjoyed watching both demographics fill up the joint on a Monday morning before Christmas. Perhaps there were some vacationers in the mix, but for the most part, it seemed like a locals joint.  Probably the best thing about the menu is the wide variety of dishes, anything from healthy scrambles to cream cheese stuffed French toast. Which do you think I chose? Damn straight I had the French toast! Ho ho ho... gettin' that Santa belly ready! My parents leaned on the other side of the spectrum, taking their bran muffins to go for a snack. Since when is bran ever a snack, btw?  Waitresses are as sweet as the strawberry topping on my giant plate of goodness. Definitely the \"sweetie\" and \"hun\" crew. There's usually about 2-3 lovely ladies taking orders, cleaning plates and running food, so tip them for their hard work, folks.   Solid breakfast food served with a smile and some syrup... What's not to like?",

The food is very good, we enjoyed being there even though it was kind of busy. I wasn't sure if the seasoning on the potatoes would be spicy since it had the word Diablo in it so Austin was so kind to get me a sample from the kitchen. It's soo good. Since it was our first time visiting we both got a free banana nut muffin which was super delicious. They have different variations of coffee creme as well. Only reason why it would have been 4* is because the water didn't taste like it got filtered. Otherwise our skillets were really good. We will come back and maybe we're lucky enough to have Austin as our waiter again.",

It's off menu, so I am sharing this little nugget with you because I am a regular here and know the secret menu.  You can thank me later.    From the minute you walk in the door here, it's like stepping into a breakfast joint in Gatlinburg, Tennessee (aka the #1 vacation spot for rednecks east of the Mississippi).  I think this is the look they are going for considering all the hokey decor.  I love it!  The hostesses, servers and bussers work together to make sure you get excellent service.  Each table has a little sign on it that you can use to alert your server if you need something, but you won't need to use it because the service is just that good.  The only downside is I could sit for an hour just sipping coffee, but this place is too busy to do that.  When I see the line out the door, I feel too guilty.  So get in as many cups of coffee as you can before turning over your table.  I like to take half my breakfast to go for the next day, but if that isn't your thing, be sure to order the half portion offered for most menu items.  These breakfasts are built for lumberjacks.",

The difference is night and day.  Summerlin location is a robust reuben filled with delicious meat, thousand island dressing and kraut.   This sandwich I got today was something I wouldn't feed my dog.  Meat was burnt, and it looked like something threw together with scraps.  Forty dollars wasted.  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fi.imgur.com%2FqH2YxL5.jpg&s=7a7989f8e05315e2885f9e872d82049e2bd2c3375bbcc8584003d75123e2bc3e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">i.imgur.com/qH2YxL5.jpg</a>",

They have EVERYTHING you can dream of on the menu! All things breakfast! I typically get a cup of coffee, and then stare at the menu for 25 minutes trying to decide what to get!   I have a lot of food allergies, they have always been very accommodating! It would be a great idea to have a sampler platter for those of us who are just indecisive!  Over the years I've had many items on their menu, I love the stuffed French toast, the biscuits and gravy with sausage patties, the skillets, and the build your own omlet! Bacon, jack, tomatoes, avocado and spinach yum!!!  My only complaint, can ANYONE in this town do prime rib for breakfast????",

    "text": "What a charming breakfast place! We initially tried to go to The Egg & I (the sister restaurant to this one) but there were so many people waiting outside that we chose to drive a little further to this location. I'm very happy we did. There was still a wait when we arrived, but that's to be expected when you're trying to have breakfast on a Saturday morning. They added us to the waitlist and we were seated in less than 15 minutes (our projected wait time). They also have an automated wait list so you can keep track of your place in line.   Once seated, we were greeted right away and brought our drinks. She gave us time to order, and browse the HUGE menu. They have so many options, it was a little hard to choose. But I had a feeling that no matter what I ordered I'd be satisfied with it.. And I was right! I ordered the harvest candied walnut pancakes, they were so delicious. Perfect texture and a good amount of walnuts. I don't suggest putting syrup on them though, as they are pretty sweet on their own. My boyfriend had the chicken mushroom spinach skillet and it was every bit as delicious as my pancakes. Also, their serving sizes are huge and we ended up spending less than $30 on our combined breakfast. I would definitely eat here over and over again. I can see why they're a Yelp favorite in the community.",

    "text": "Country theme. Four tv's featuring sports. Wide open floor plan, in a square shape. There is a border (it's short- you can see everyone dining here) to separate some of the seating, all tables, no booths. Back is the kitchen (left back) and bathrooms (right back). Front is the seating/ waiting area, as well as the cashier and products for sale (the diablo & chipotle sauce are yummy, $4.95 ea. (bonus, the sodium content on both is low).  We got there today at a good time. There were some customers but by the time we left, it was pretty crowded in the waiting area (and the noise level increased). So, today, we were seated right away. Our server was at our table within minutes. She was nice. And lots of other people checked in on us too.  Our breakfast got there right away. Hubby got chicken fried steak w/ country scrambled eggs (softer) and it came with spiced potatoes and a banana nut muffin. I got the Grandma's Biscuits & Gravy to split with our son. The biscuits & gravy are the most flavorful here out of all the breakfast spots we frequent (all of the restaurants in the family, we've also been at The Cracked Egg too- same great flavor on the biscuits & gravy). I ate the eggs, great with pepper & both types of sauce, one smothered biscuit, & some potatoes (excellent). The serving of potatoes is quite generous. We took the rest home. I also sampled the chicken fried steak- it is really yummy, it is a recent discovery for me. I didn't know what it was, seriously. Also sampled the muffin, yummy too.  This restaurant is close to home so I am glad that we finally visited. It is a yummy breakfast and lunch spot. I can't comment on lunch though because we usually stop in for breakfast. Great service, great food.",

I have no complaints at all.   However, This past visit blew me away. This time I came with both my son and daughter. Can't remember the exact date. I order the same thing every time: original breakfast burrito with avocado and jalapenos with the works potato's. It was either a week or two ago. I have never had to wait for a seat but on this particular day, this place was jam packed. We had to wait 15-20 which I don't mind at all. Once the 15 minutes went by, one of the staff members had asked if we would be open to sitting at the bar, and of course I didn't mind so I said I'll take it.   Now I don't think I've ever sat at the bar before. But I loved it! What I witnessed was impressive and deserves to be acknowledged. I always knew that these people worked hard but while sitting at the bar, you really get to see it all. With all the chaos going on, and the influx of orders coming in, i was so impressed to see how great these employees handled themselves and the business. The level of teamwork I saw was incredible. Staff kept a smile on their face and their A Game in at all times. They tackled every single order with great professionalism, timing and a full on smile on their face and positive attitude. Not once did I see an attitude, an eye roll, anxiety, or bickering. Everyone worked very well with each other while still interacting with us customers and getting the orders in and out in a timely manner. If I were the owner of this establishment I would be so proud of this staff because it is very rare to find people who would treat your business like it were their own. Trust me when I say this, because I myself have a business and I know how difficult it is to build a great team.   I am extremely happy that I got to witness this activity while I was there in my last visit. I've always loved this place but now I love it and appreciate it even more than ever before. I hope that the staff continues to exceed expectations and gets recognized for their level of commitment. Until next time... I'll be back very soon.",

The Service is ALWAYS 5 Stars! With my busy schedule, I wish I had more chances to eat there. I take all my friends and family that visit, to Egg Works. It's one of my top 5 suggestions to visitors of Vegas.  I have nothing negative to say about this establishment. If you're here on Vacation, it's definitely worth the Uber/Lyft Ride there.

    "text": "It was our first time at this particular location and probably our last. This one is so much smaller than the Rainbow location so the wait for a party of 5 was significantly longer.   Service was so much slower but the food was consistent with the other Egg works so that part was good. Didn't appreciate having to flag down someone though every time we needed something.   Being that it's a new year hubby decided to try something new as opposed to sticking with faves, lol not the wisest idea as the Cincy Chili Loco Moco he opted on was probably the worst tasting item in the menu. Looked like dog food and most likely tasted just as bad. Lol definitely stick with tried and tested faves!",

They do have AMAZING banana but bread muffin and their potatoes are perfectly seasoned #yum but Pancakes & French Toast are nothing special. Bacon is thin and greasy (it's the thickness and quality that are lacking grease is to be expected); sausage always comes pink and undercooked. Syrup can make or break you and I think it may be the syrup that throws me. I'd recommend Original Pancake House over this place any day and they are right around the corner.",

The next time we had went in his order was messed up again, and we had to wait another few minutes for it to be corrected. We understand mistakes happen and that's totally understandable, however, twice in a row is not okay. We had consulted the manager, Sunshine about it. She was super sweet and had awesome customer service. She was super apologetic and compensated my boyfriends meal for both messups. Other than the mistakes, the servers have great customer service and the manager is awesome for making sure that her customers are taken care of. We will be coming back!",

Service: Mariyah (hope I am spelling this right) was one of the most entertaining servers I have ever had at any restaurant. ***on a side note if Mariyah sees this review, slide into my DMs as I would love to take you out ;)****. Anyways, I haven't laughed this hard at breakfast since, well ever.   Food: I have literally tried everything on the menu at this point and love 90% of the food. The omelettes are great, but the Mexican omelette and the chilli ones are my fav. The corn beef hash is my favorite breakfast though! For lunch, I'm a huge gumbolaya fan! It's legit!

A very homey and country feel with a lot of pictures of animals and farms on the wall. I loved the way they had the entrance to their bathrooms, it looked like an outhouse.   I ordered a spinach benny with their seasoned potatoes (I can't remember what they called the potatoes). It was massive and reasonably priced. The benny was okay. The hollandaise wasn't that great to me. For some reason, I thought texture and taste was closer to nacho cheese, but their potatoes were yummy.   4 stars for the cute restaurant and its speedy and friendly service.

It was alright, probably wouldn't get it again. I feel like the burrito was overpowered by the onions that were inside of it. I could only eat half. However, the potato's were AMAZING. The ice tea was very bland and watered down.   My only real complaint and the reason for 3 stars was our service at checkout. My positive experience flew out the door when I went to pay my bill. The poor older couple ahead of me had to deal with this woman's crappy attitude and a fellow server that asked for a credit card to be ran. She barked at the server and muttered something under her breath. (I could tell there was tension between them.) Once it was my turn a quick 5 min. Checkout turned into a 15 min ordeal all because of a coupon.   She was totally irritated about the coupon...like to the point she was really touching the touch screen computer aggressively and rolling her eyes and sighing. On top of that she couldn't figure out what she was doing and then gave me the wrong change back. When I went back into corrector she made it seem like it was my fault.   I will back to Egg Works but not this restaurant.",

After a heated debating, he got 10 minutes to play the game.  Upon checkout, we were told that there was a $2 charge for using the game console. Surprise.   So, the egg works gives child the power to play the game w/o needing parental agreement, and the parents are asked to pay at the end of the meal. This does not sound like the right setup, let alone we actually hate my son to play games, and the presence of the game console actually caused us trouble in the sense that we had to argue with our son.",

The restaurant is farm themed so it feels like you're getting your food right from the source. They have condiments on the side of the table and different hot sauce as well. They have an egg system where one is a happy egg and if you flip it over it has a sad egg. When you flip it over to the sad egg it will grab the waiters attention to come and ask if you need anything.   I got their eggtalian omelette with a side of fries and toast and I enjoyed every last bit of it. The marinara sauce with the Italian sausage reminded me of lasagna. I added one of their hot sauce which had chipotle in it and I loved the Smokey flavor it had.   I will always come here anytime I visit Vegas!",

Loved it! From the moment we walked in we felt like we were at home! We were seated and Cody our server came over! What a blast we had with him!   My girlfriend had their cinnamon raisin French toast, eggs and turkey sausage and was in heaven! I had the country fried steak and eggs with jalapeno flavored potatoes and a short stack of pancakes! Wow! Talk about flavor! Needless to say we were stuffed! And the coffee was great too! We will be back again whenever we're in Vegas!",

To be clear they comp'd the meal, yet this major mess up must be called out because it is inconsistent with the normal good job Egg Works has done every other time.  After waiting 45 minutes for food and seeing others seated after us being served, one of two meals showed up. It was wrong, having cheese on it. With a tight timeline the person ate it.  On the second me the waitress apologized that it was not started. To be clear the waitress, Rea, was awesome. She placed my special order correctly, yet the kitchen just FAILED to do their job. I said to cancel the meal because we had no time to wait.  The manager Koko was great as well apologizing numerous times. The food showed up while she was there and it was wrong. The kitchen could not read the freaking slip!!!! The manager stated the main chef was just arriving at 10:00 am on a Sunday morning abd would handle it.  It is obvious from the running around in the kitchen that this crew needs retraining or continous supervision. Better yet how about the main chef get in at a reasonable time for such a busy Sunday am crowd.  I will give them another try in the future, but they must fix this crew.",

The barn-like decor, with some farm animals, and egg people on the walls are real cute. The menu is presented different, it's printed on a newspaper type layout and there are little egg people all over that too. Cute.  My regular meal of choice: the waffles and sausage patties with an iced tea (fresh brewed). My husband usually gets an omelet (egg whites) and potatoes. I love the waffles, you get 1 large waffle, light and sweet. The Patties are good too. And there's always enough potatoes on my husband's plate, that I'm able to have some too. I like them because they've some kind of Cajun seasoning on them.   If you need anything from the server, there's an egg shaped sign on the table and if you need assistance, you flip the black egg over so that the yellow egg is showing and a majority of the time, a server instantly shows up to assist you, whether they're your server or not. It's interesting, and I hope I don't jinx myself by saying this, but we've been going there for about 3 years or so, maybe once every couple months, and there has not been a time when the service was bad for us. The only thing that I'm not a fan of, is the long wait that you have to deal with sometimes, especially on a Sun or Sat and the parking is poop when it's busy.   Yes, I'd go back and we do quite often.",

I typically hate muffins but this muffin is out of this universe. It has a strong aroma and taste of banana and you can also physically see the nuts in them.  The Works Omelette: Loaded with all different kinds of meat and vegetables. Comes with their works potato which is a must have.

If you make it a frowny face, your server will come almost immediately. I've really never needed to use this however because our server almost always has checked in on us at good times.  Now the food. Holy crap is this stuff good. If you're dieting, don't go here because it's too tempting. I would reccommend something, but really everything is good. Make sure to get a side of potatoes because they're fantastic and seasoned very well.   If you haven't been here yet and you live in Vegas, go!

    "text": "This was my second time at Egg Works. The wait on a Sunday  at noon wasn't too long...about 10-15 minutes. This time I wanted to try the Homemade Corned Beef and my food partner decided on the Country Fried Steak. With each entree, you can get toast or banana nut muffin. I was pleased with the banana nut muffin. When our entrees came, I was disappointed with the Corned Beef. It was dry and just not what I expected. It basically looked like the corned beef you get out of a can. The Country Fried Steak was good, but not blow your mind out of this world great. We ordered a large pancake on the side, but it was a bit rubbery too me and over buttery. However, the service was great.  Overall, it was worth it with our 2 for 1 coupon and for a close breakfast place to eat its convenient.",

Every place I have gone, so far has not been like this, normally when your done or seemed half way there they should notice and then place a bill not place a bill with the food we just ordered and are about to eat.   Yet I am not slamming them they have great customer service and take pride in there business I can see that. I recommend eating the stuffed french toast!!!!",

After hauling ass at 3am, taking a detour to Vegas thru Needles, we get there way too early for anything else, but hey, its Vegas. Some friends say I just HAD to try this place, if anything, the banant nut muffin.   Makeup not done, hair not done, and literlly 4 hours of sleep, we're there with our big appetites.  We get there and I ask for coffee, and immediately its served. Server was very nice and even took time to explain some of their specialties, their famous potatoes, and even their banana nut muffin. I was supposed to get a choice between a muffin or toast, but because I was a first timer, she gave me both.   Muffin - Was like a taste of sweet heaven! Talk about an orgasmic feeling, and get your head out of the gutters! Made fresh, served warm where the butter melted on direct impact. I was in another world and forgot where I was at. This was the best banana nut muffin I've ever had.  I ordered the country skillet which is basically their potatoes topped with country fried steak, 2 eggs and their country gravey- Potatoes were to die for. Not your usual potatoes, but these were crispy and served with season salt. I was in love with the potatoes itself! Only downfall was that the potatoes are better off on the side vs topped with all that other good stuff.   Friend ordered corn beaf and hash - defintely excellent, but I still favored my country skillet.   Service was excellent. Coffee was never empty, and defintely service with a smile. If you haven't been here yet, this is definitely worth the drive from the strip, even more so, if you're up early enough, this is definintely the place to go.",

    "text": "Alright, I must admit that I hate eggs. I know, I'm weird, and yes, I see all of your hateful stares! I have met 2 other people who hate eggs just as much as I do. I don't know what it is, I CAN eat eggs in fried rice,  and I LOVE egg rolls, but I just can't eat eggs by itself. Nonetheless, my husband loves Eggs Works, so you may find me here quite often.   I appreciate that they have items on their menu that doesn't have eggs. Although, I would stick to the breakfast dishes because the one time I ordered a burger, it was very dry and tasted horrible. I usually order Grandma's Biscuits and Gravy. Sometimes they drown the two biscuits in their sausage gravy, but it tastes good and is not too salty or watery. The works potatoes are also very addicting, although I feel that sometimes they give you too much of that as well. It makes me wonder how much  they end up throwing away everyday? My husband loves the Island Favorite because of the Portuguese Sausage, and Egg Works is a much closer drive than going to downtown.   Usually service is average and quick, but our visit today was just horrible. First of all, we waited about 20 minutes for a server to take our order. Second, they screwed up my order. I ordered my usual, and our server said \"it comes with works potatoes, is that ok?\" I replied yes. Then she asked \"would you like to add any eggs or meat with that?\" and I said no. Another server delivered our food, and when I saw my small plate with just one biscuit with gravy, I told her that it was missing the second biscuit and the potatoes. She informed our original server, and although she apologized, she just seemed very confused. Apparently she thought that I wanted the side order portion. Funny, the side order doesn't come with the works potatoes. Also, she should have known that because she asked me earlier if I was okay with them. Really? Then she told us that she wouldn't charge us for it, but she did anyway. Well, at least she only charged us for the price of the side order. We also had to wait 20 minutes for our bill. What a disaster! This was the first time we experienced something like this.  I'm sure I'll be back again whether I like it or not, lol. Hopefully we will get a better server next time!",

    "text": "A wide, modernized-American style space, nice air, nice people, good vibe. Egg Works definitely has a good feel to it, which I think is absolutely critical for a breakfast place. The morning has to feel good, especially for the unfortunate noon-waking types.   The staff is friendly, though not spectacular (which they have the potential of being), but they do work efficiently and cleanly. The food is nothing too special; a little too rich, even for American food, and there's the unnecessarily huge servings of thick, saucy food even if you're expected to have morning-dessert afterwards. You could easily split an entree with someone else, and be happier in the end for it for not feeling so mayo-greased. I did appreciate how fresh the vegetables were, and the solid arrangement of the layers in my eggs benedict (which is important), but then the excess food and servings is just such a huge turn-off, especially when the flavors are so monotone that it all eventually becomes one huge unnecessary mouthful.   What I'd like to see is some more use of those excellent veggies and construction to create a bit more interest to the breakfast dishes. I'm not saying that they should be doing culinary acrobatics here, breakfast place and all, but they could stand to reduce sizes so that guests are not one-flavor-drowned, or to add a bit more interest to these huge dishes to warrant them being so size expansive.",

    "text": "Do you love eggs for breakfast? Well Egg Works is a great place to start up your day, you get the protein that you need and why not have it a way that you can enjoy. If your not an egg eating person no worries, they have french toast, waffles, pancakes, crepes, burgers and sandwiches.  The location is great, good amount of parking, and the staff is very friendly. Sounds to me that this place would be a great place to eat and bring your family or friends. Not an early bird? It's okay they are open until 3PM, perfect for brunch.   Tried so far:  Chili Omelette (yummy in my tummy)  The Classic (plain ol' me)  Greek Scramble (gotta love the feta)  Cabo Breakfast Burrito (say OLE)  Banana Nut Muffin (to die for)  Banana Nut French Toast (a little sweet but good)",

As we waited for our food I watched our server Tamara workin it! She was on point. Cleaning her own tables and re seating them immediately. The food came super quick and she made sure we had everything we needed. The food was awesome...but the service made our day!!

    "text": "We've been wanting to try this place since moving up to The Lakes over a year ago.  In need of a run to Lee's (which is in the same shopping center) on a Tuesday seemed like the perfect time.  Especially since there was no line wrapping around the building.    We were seated immediately.  5*'s.   Drink orders taken within 5 minutes of sitting down.  5*'s.  Waitress in the uniform pony tail popped over to take our order off the extensive menu within 1 minute of our drink order being taken.  Upon being told we weren't ready, she left and returned 15 minutes later.  2*'s.   HUGE portions.  of Potatoes.    We had at our table.    Chicken enchilada omlet:  very tasty.  could have used a touch of spice.  but over all I'd get it again.   Western omlet:  filled with goodness and the person ordering it took the other 1/2 he couldn't consume at the table..home. and he never ever takes home left overs.    Bandito scramble:  nice combo but kind of bland.  not enough chorizo to make it --wait for it -- EGGciting enough.    Coffee was delicious.  Of course any coffee for me is delicious if they are not serving Star bucks or Seattle's best.    Banana muffin.. worth the entire meal.  Moist, delicious and the alternative to extremely dry toast.   Now we come to the waitress again.  Ok it was a Tuesday and there was never a line waiting and she had several open tables.  I think she might have either been new OR having a bad day but we had to turn our little eggy guy (see pics) to get our check & a to-go box.    Overall I'd say its a great find during the week.  Certainly not worth the wait for the massive lines we've seen on the weekend.   We got in and out in about an hour and 15 minutes and under 50.00.  I'd say it was a good meal.",

Blech!  I do appreciate the heads up though. My boyfriend and I split a prime rib country potato etc. skillet that they had on special.  The meat in it didn't even remotely resemble prime rib, and all I could taste was the  Worcestershire sauce that they doused the whole skillet with.  :( I would give this place another shot, but with so many awesome breakfast places in the neighborhood...it might be a while before I do.",

    "text": "Late brunch the past Sunday and we brought a friend whose never experienced the egg wonders of Las Vegas's breakfasts.  (He's usually fast asleep after the graveyard shift!)  He chose the Beef Eater \"Grilled Parmesan sourdough, Swiss cheese, caramelized onions, and grilled roast beef and a side of horseradish sauce.\"  I'm not sure if they are still using horseradish sauce, but my friend thought it was hollandaise sauce!  I tried a bit and found it 'interesting.'  The sandwich was decent as he finished it all, and the Works potatoes was a generous portion because he had a lot leftover.  The Husband was craving the Country Fried Steak \"A hand battered chicken fried steak, topped with Grandma's country gravy and served with two eggs, Works potatoes and a choice of toast or banana nut muffin.\"  He has his two eggs over easy with sourdough bread.  The country gravy was definitely creamy, but needed a bit more zip.  I wanted a side of corn beef hash, and the waitress said they could definitely do that.  She asked if I wanted the homemade version or the canned, which I had never been asked before.  Apparently they just started doing the homemade version, but most people prefer the canned one instead.  Feeling the need to experiment, I went with the homemade version, knowing ahead that it was going to be more stringy-like.  And she also asked if I wanted it more well-done, which I took as \"crispier.\"  They also serve it as a small or large side order.  The homemade version is definitely a bit more stringier and something I've had quite often since most Filipinos eat their corned beef like that.  However, it definitely needed a bit more flavor - some heat and pepper took care of that!  Overall, our breakfast experience this time was okay.  Our friend wasn't as impressed, and just found it to be average.  We weren't wowed the same way as the first time.  (Pics posted!)",

I had to scrape most of the cheese off. I could barely taste the meat flavors and was hoping for a crunchy bacon filling with the sausage and ham. The side potatoes were a bit overcooked and over seasoned and the English muffin was drenched in butter. Maybe my stomach wasn't in the mood for lots of oily fats, because I just wasn't impressed by the meal or flavors.  I would definitely return again and try another dish. It's difficult to find a great breakfast spot, so I won't rule this place out. I unfortunately can't give it a four or five star rating like most of the reviews on here because it just wasn't that spectacular.",

It looked a little grim at first with there being about 20 people waiting, but we had a table in 5 minutes. I think it's because we came a little but later at almost 11, but once we were sat the place was still pretty busy.   I have to hand it to them though, it was slammed and the customer service was still great and we really didn't have to wait very long to get our food. I ordered the chicken fried steak which was pretty awesome, but the main attraction here is the potatoes. I dunno what they use to season them, but it was nothing I'd had at breakfast time before. I'll go back, for sure.",

Maybe I'm just not ordering the right things but my boyfriend and I both get disappointed each time we come here. The banana nut muffin is always dried out and does not taste fresh. Service is always hit or miss. And the food in comparison to other places like the cracked egg, it just doesn't measure up. I got stuffed French toast which was decent but again, nothing compared to the one at the cracked egg. The chicken fried steak skillet was more gravy than anything else... I think I enjoyed Denny's more than the egg works version. And lastly I tried the pork benny. It wasn't bad but you definitely have to have a certain \"taste\" to order that. It was very unique and different from anything I've had.. but I had a hard time finishing it with the mountain of the smokey bbq sauce slathered every where. I love their potatoes because they are seasoned well and full of flavor. I usually can't order country potatoes but they're so good here it's the one thing I can compliment. After 4 visits here, I don't think I'll be returning. I guess it lives up to the hype for some people, but for someone who loves breakfast I'd rather get it in a place with better customer service and friendlier helpful staff.",

I had a half order of eggs Benedict, he had a 2 egg omelet with bacon, avocado and cheese. Great potatoes and a side of fruit. Service was fast, first time visitors get a free muffin.

When the burrito arrived it was drenched in sauce.  It was so bad that it broke apart constantly whenever I cut into it.  In my opinion, based on having many breakfast burritos at different places, a burrito should be held or at the very least shouldn't break apart so easily when cut into smaller pieces.  This was so bad that I was using my spoon and eating like a regular meal.  \"Maybe you should've asked for the sauce on the side\" could be a rebuttal to this review.  Perhaps, but keep in mind this was my first time here.  I had no idea it would be drenched.  To add insult to injury, the water we were served had a bad after taste which leads me to believe that they don't serve filtered water like the majority of places do.  I might be back, but for sure it will be for a regular breakfast next time.",

Tables are never wiped properly, crumbs and dust are always all over the condiments holders, dog hairs are on patio tables.  It makes customers doubt kitchen hygiene too.  And you need instruct your bussers to stop touching coffee mugs with their hands where people drink from.  Please have them use handles.  It's especially unappealing when you see them do it with wet hands during cleaning.  And lastly, it's extremely unpleasant to constantly smell cleaning sprays and see bussers spray it all over in the air when they wipe tables.  It needs to be sprayed on a cloth away from adjacent tables that are eating.  It just seems like management is not ever present and that the wait stuff is running restaurant operations on their own.  I will remove this review as soon as u guys start taking a better care of your restaurants.",

When we finally sat down we didn't wait long for drink orders to be taken but we had a VERY small table and an entire carafe of coffee was given to us. I don't mind a carafe but it made eating so uncomfortable. Not to mention that once we fixed our coffees the way we like, we had a small pile of trash (sugar wrappers, etc.) which added to the small space. Some of the creamer spilled onto the table so we used the two napkins we were given to clean it and requested more napkins. It took about 20 minutes for us to get napkins and we got them only because we asked someone other than our waitress. Meanwhile, our waitress was helping the table next to us and not paying much attention to us. I asked if she could take the trash pile and she said sure but walked away LOL. Good food but if I were to go back I would hope that someone else could service us.",

Their newest location is no exception.  Took a date their for brunch last Sunday, she ordered the Veggie Benny while I had the Country Benny. The country benny was one of the better renditions of biscuits and gravy that I've ever had, with the gravy having a really nice, balanced flavor. It seems like a lot of breakfast gravies that are served with biscuits are just thick and gloppy; more meant to stick to your bones then deliver flavor. Their gravy really shines.  My date loved her veggie benny, especially the grilled tomato and fresh avocado. Service was friendly and customer oriented. I'm definitely a fan!",

Today, when we were ordering omlettes the waitress asked us if we would like them with 2 or 4 eggs. We said 2 eggs and therefore got a reasonable size meal. (They also came with potatoes or fruit and a muffin or toast.) The smaller option wasn't on the menu--it was a couple of bucks cheaper--and, possibly, the waitress only offered it to us because she sized us up as seniors. However, getting a reasonably sized omlette makes this a much more attractive place for me. I found the veggie omlette quite good and with two eggs right sized. The selection of fresh fruits was also good.",

Screaming babies lots of people cluttering the aisles. When i first came in I went to use the restroom,there were a ton of un-bused tables not very attractive or sanitary. My waitress was  helpful but over the top fake customer service. Now to the food....why doesn't anyone know how to make a proper hollandaise sauce? Powder mix all the way,average bordering on not really good at all. And the potatoes they serve,omg.They had more salt then the dead sea...easy with the salt moses your killen me. I felt like i was getting hyper tension with each bite.Then I go to check out,lady behind the counter doing something counting receipts finally looks up at me and says how are you,im fine. she goes back to doing what she was doing...lol ..ok np ill just wait for you dear. Please give me five singles as my change ,she hands me a 5...here take this 5 and put it towards a new hearing aid.....this place might be ok to soak up a hangover but other then that mediocre at best...pass.",

Perfect for a nice  Sunday breakfast.  My personal favorites are:  1- bacon and avocado omelette.   2-bandito scramble (super good deal cause it includes a choice of toast or banana muffin)  3-Classic Benny (always cooked perfectly)  4-Works scarmble is algo good.   The waiters are always friendly. I go every weekends. The banana muffin is good. The cinnamon roll is great.   Eggworks is like sunday church for me. And I always leave happy.",

When I think of a crepe, I think of a very thin, pancake like batter rolled with filling.  When my \"crepe\" came it was like a pancake omelet.  It was huge, and very thick \"breading\"!  I thought the waitress brought the wrong item, but no.  It tasted \"heavy\" and was greasy and \"doughy\"!  I could only eat half.  The Bandito breakfast, (or whatever). Looked like dog food.  It did not look appetizing!  It was cooked too long and \"crispy\"!  It was not fully eaten either! The only redeeming part of breakfast was the smattering of fresh fruit and banana muffin.  I ordered fruit instead of \"The Works\" potatoes, as I remembered the potatoes were dry and salty.  (They still looked that way!)  Service was just okay!  We did not have silverware, we had to ask.  Waitress only came to table to bring the check.  No refills.  She wasn't very friendly, either!  Sourpus,  There are too many other good breakfast venues in the area, so will be hard pressed to return soon!",

Our server was Adriane and she's the reason I wanted to write a good review.  She was very warm and chatted us up a bit about our stay.  She's one of those servers that make you feel like you're home and you just know she's going to give you good service even though the place was very busy.  Adriane suggested the Loco Moco and my husband told her to pick anything off the menu for him.  He loved her choice.  I needed a few little sides and Adriane remembered and brought them out with a smile.  We never had to ask for anything, she was on her game.  Now, we will always choose a local breakfast place over a Vegas buffet and this location of Egg Works will be on our return visit.  Nice staff, good breakfasts, and great service.",

This is the fourth in a string of egg works in town and the first that is actually close to me.        - Seasoned Center Cut New York Steak - One of the two items I always get when I'm here. They use their own special seasoning that makes the steak simply delicious.        - Works Potatoes - Seasoned home fried potatoes. Their seasoning is so good they even sell it. Their fries are done the same way.        - Banana Nut Muffin - Comes with almost every dish. It's sinful how moist and addicting this muffin is. If it's your first time and your entree doesn't come with it, I believe they'll give you one anyway. They know it's like crack and it'll keep you coming back.        - Works Burger - The other item I always get. Sauteed onions, mushrooms, bacon, and cheese. Need I say more. It tastes just as good as it sounds.        - Bennies - If you like eggs benedict, they have 5 different kinds. One even is topped with blackend prime rib. **Recommendations**        - I'd recommend this place if you're looking for a nice breakfast or lunch place.",

    "text": "Nothing quite like strolling into a local breakfast place, plopping your butt on a stool a the bar, getting a cup of coffee that never gets past half empty, having fun people to talk to and solid food.   All of that, Egg Works.  I've been to Hash House (pretty much live there when I stay downtown) a lot, and while I do love that place, this local little breakfast nook has supplanted HH.  So, as I said, I hop on a bar stool, the manager Gia stops over to throw down on some coffee and ask if I have any questions. Nope. Menu is straight forward, well laid out and my prey is ripe for the picking: The Sundance Special Omelet. What's that you ask? Spinach, sliced mushrooms, artichoke hearts folded with Swiss cheese and a special Works artichoke cheese filling and then topped with feta cheese and fresh tomatoes. Right from the menu. But, am I satisfied with all that? Nope, throw in the chicken!!! Opted for the American fries and some sourdough as well.  The omelet... amazing. Perfectly done, ingredients all complimented each other and the chicken was seasoned perfectly with a bit of a spicy, southwest style seasoning. The kicker though, the special sauce, having some sort of lime flavor to it, which literally had me doing back flips off the stool. I swear I went into the hunch over the plate to ensure my neighbors didn't even look at it. Sourdough toast was toasted perfectly, not cold and was a perfect vessel to help wreck the omelet.   American fries (while I normally opt for hashbrowns, figure, it's a house special, go with it) were incredible. Each spud was crisp on the outside, fluffy inside and hit up with that same southwest kind of seasoning the chicken had.   Can't wait to head back and try more menu options. Actually, must head back and try more menu options.",

Standard breakfast flair. I had a salad but my friend had a parfait and it looked soo tasty. Presentation is a little awkward if you want to eat the granola with the yogurt (in a long skinny glass) so I'd recommend requests a different playing.   All in all, it was a solid experience.",

The meals came with either toast or a yummy homemade banana nut muffin, and they give you a carafe of coffee on your table for refills.

When I went in for take out, they sat me down and gave me a drink while I waited. Everyone was very friendly. The food came out in no time at all. I brought the food back to work and proceeded to devour my meal.   The second experience I had was even better. After we sat down, our waitress greeted us promptly and took our drink order. She was also very friendly. After this, two other people stopped by to be sure that we had placed our drink order. Then we ordered our food and I requested the last portion be a to-go order. The waitress remembered and at the end of the meal when she gave us the check she put the order in and it was ready right before we were ready to go.   Now for the specifics.... their eggs are really as fantastic as they say. My favorite so far is the Cincinnati Chili. If you have EVER had Cinci Chili before and loved it, this is a MUST try. I'm not sure how many places have this in Vegas...  I tried the Cinci burrito. The egg in it was extremely filling and the entire thing got eaten (in twi sittings).  If you're looking for a decent priced breakfast/lunch joint - try this place out. I think you will be very happy you did.",

My wife got the regular french toast breakfast and our son got a kid's chocolate chip pancake shaped like Mickey Mouse. Both orders of french toast were less than stellar -- thin slices of bread that were over-cooked. I was hoping they would use bread that would make their french toast more unique and flavorful, but no. Just some boring flat slices. Personally, I think I can make better french toast. My son did enjoy his pancake and the sausage that it came with was very good. Reading other Yelp reviews, it sounds like most people get some banana nut muffins with their entree. We didn't get any. Maybe I just ordered the wrong thing. Maybe I should have gotten one of the skillet dishes. I don't know. But, based on this one experience I'd rather eat breakfast at the Cracked Egg or Black Bear Diner.",

I finally decided on the crepe because I thought that might be healthier...but now that I think about it I don't think either can be described as healthy. The Key Largo had Smoked Turkey, diced bacon, guacamole, diced tomatoes, and cheddar and jack cheese. Topped with sour cream and a side of salsa. It was also served with some potatoes on the side. This is the first non dessert crepe I have eaten so it had a lot to live up to. It was yummy but I think I will just stick to crepes as a dessert . I think it's because I've programmed myself to think of them as sweet and when I don't get that I think it comes up as second rate in my mind. I do know what I want to try there when I go back ...this lady next to me had this yogurt looking parfait . It had what looked like blueberries and mandarin oranges on the top.That may  be a contender on my next visit!",

    "text": "Thanks to my hotel's guide book which advertised this place as \"featured in Rachael Ray's show\" as well as great reviews on Yelp, I decided to come for brunch.    This place deserves 5 stars for originality.  The menu is like an 8-page newspaper full of creative dishes.  We got there on a Saturday noon and waited about 15 minutes or so.  I decided to check out the menu while I waited, and by the time I sat on the table, I was still torn between the stuffed french toast, crepes or an \"egg-ceptional omelette\"....so decided to ask the waitress, who recommended the seasonal PUMPKIN BANANA PANCAKES...which were not a bad choice.  My bf's huge omelette was a little overcooked for me, but was stuffed with looots of different ingredients and home fries (with a little too much seasoning!).  Since it was my first time, they brought us complimentary BANANA NUT MUFFINS that were warm, soft and delicious!  All in all, food is good (not amaaazing, just good), service was great, decor is really cute, farm like, and the dishes are super creative.  Portions are huge and prices more than reasonable.  Would definitely go back!",

I have never seen it on a menu before and I was very curious how it was going to taste. It was absolutely delicious... If you love mashed potatoes as much as I do, you will not be sorry. The place doesnt look like much, it is a little small but almost completely full of hungry, hungry people. We were seated immediately, we went on a friday morning. The service was very friendly, GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE. My friend ordered the banana nut french toast and it came with a side of eggs. When they brought our food out, they came back with an extra side of eggs because they werent sure if hers got cold while they were preparing the rest. AWESOME! We felt like we were really taken care of. On top of the amazing food. a total win. I love this place and can't wait to go back! In total, spent a little over $20 for the mashed potato omelet, french toast combo and a glass of OJ.",

I got the Cincy Chili Dog and a salad with ranch.  I didn't like the Cincy dog at all, had a couple bites and gave up.  The ranch dressing for the salad wasn't made right so they offered me a new one with freshly made dressing but we had to go so they gave us four (enough for everyone I was with) of the banana nut breads, which were pretty good.  Even though the food wasn't that good, they got five stars for service and I would be willing to go back to try something else.  My mom liked her chicken salad sandwich, my sister loved her BLT but my son says he didn't really like the tuna melt, even though he took the rest of it to go.",

I went on a Sunday around 1 pm and it was a 20 min wait for the two of us, not too bad I guess considering its most likely their peak time.   The service was much better this time. The waitress was very attentive and made multiple checks on us throughout our meal. She also explained the payment process of bringing the bill up to the front when we were ready.   The food was also much better. The eggs were cooked perfectly and home style fries as well. I do wish however the eggs had a little less bolognese just for my own liking but still good.   Overall I was much happier with my visit this time and would come back again for more, maybe just not during peak hours.",

Through her advice, I was able to eat the best Huevos Rancheros in my life. I got it with carnitas, green sauce, side of rice, beans and egg was over easy. It's a pretty big portion so share with another if you can.  Ok good night! Food coma time.",

First, our server Maria G. was an angel. Once again, a lackluster meal is made better by a great employee - thank you Maria!   Back to food. I really, highly suggest NOT getting a crepe. The egg part was weird and spongy. Pancake-y might be a better description. Also not a fan of their house made chorizo, which was bland with strange texture. I almost choked on globs of cheese inside the crepe omelette- seriously. Coffee was too watered down for me, and I really dislike non-dairy creamer, would much prefer a tiny cup of cream. Back to the positive notes, I was a fan of their spiced potatoes (spice was similar to Lawry's) and their bottled Salsa Verde helped flavor up the bland Mexican Omelette. They do HALF orders, and it was A LOT of food, so glad our server mentioned that before ordering! We enjoyed a free banana muffin with our checkin (yay!!) I think the fella's basic breky looked far better than mine, so back to the basics it will be.",

If you have a large group I would suggest their S Rainbow/215 location, as this one is a bit smaller inside.   They have lots of menu options, and I've never had an issue getting something substituted. Whether you are wanting egg whites and tomato slices, or a mashed potato stuffed omelette loaded with cheese and bacon, you will find something here!

Not 1 of the 4 of us at our table enjoyed any of our meals.  All left with more than half the food on our plates. I drank the water to fill me up.  That was the best part of the entire meal.  THE WATER.  I dont recommend this place to anyone who likes any flavor to their food at all.

The food portions are huge, so if you aren't hungry enough to eat 4-6 eggs, be prepared for a Togo box. Or get the half portion.  I like their bloody Mary's and mimosas. Bloody Mary mix is hablo Diablo and it's delicious. So good I don't even know if they actually put vodka in the drink. The mimosas are probably check champagne but they also used fresh squeezed oj. All about the mixers baby!  Their muffins are so good. Sometimes they come out before your food. Sometimes with your food. Sometimes after your food... just depends on how good or busy your server is. Get the house potatoes with extra seasoning and extra crispy and thank me later.   My go to is usually an omelette. They're huge and delicious and packed with veggies and protein.   Also, if your service sucks or you need something, flip your egg girl.  And be prepared to stand in a line on the weekends.",

I ordered the classic with scrambled eggs, bacon and fruit instead of the potatoes.  Always get the soft and delicious muffin which seems to fill me up so I only eat half before the meal arrives.

A little issue with my husbands meal but it was quickly fixed by the waitress and handled great. My skillet was delicious. Would recommend this place to anyone.",

I ordered a bacon/avocado omelette with cheddar and jack cheese off of their menu, I also add green peppers/onions  but once I get my omelette it's only green peppers and onions. Side from that the omelette was cold, but at least they got my boyfriends skillet correct. I always come back because they have a great menu to choose from but if I'm going to pay almost $4 for plain orange juice and have them constantly mess up my order then I'll just go to another place instead.",

They had a cute Egg Flip card if you need something at your table.  We were brought warm banana nut muffins on a small plate.  It tasted more like bran than banana.  There was butter on the table.  My friend ordered the California Crepe.  It had diced bacon, sliced mushrooms, diced tomatoes, guacomole and Swiss cheese with a side of Hollandaise sauce.  The crepe was not thin like a French crepe.  It looked heavy like an omlette.  She asked for unseasoned potatoes.  I ordered the Works Skillet.  It had a layer of potatoes covered with ham, bacon, sliced sausage links, mushrooms, onions, peppers and tomatoes, melted cheese and over easy eggs.  We paid at the counter and presented the coupon.",

Looking at the menu made me hungry so my husband and I decided to check it out the next day.  It was quite busy when we got there around 9:30 am. Plenty of tables and flat screen tvs...We were immediately seated. I was fascinated with the newspaper-printed menu. Quite unusual. Definitely stood out.  I ordered the Waffle Works with bananas, eggs and bacon. My husband ordered the Biscuits and Gravy. When our orders arrived the first thing we noticed was that the portions were HUGE! To us, one plate was plenty for two.  I was a  bit disappointed with my order. Nothing really impressed me besides the portion. My waffles were overcooked. The eggs didn't have enough seasoning and tasted rubbery. The bacon was okay.  My husband said that his biscuits were a bit hard to fork through. But, he enjoyed the Works potatoes. Overall our first experience at Egg Works was (sorry to say): Eh.  The Standouts: Hearty portions, attentive service, unique menu.  Would we come back? Yes. Willing to give it another visit. Next time we'll share a plate and try out the banana nut muffin.",

Well, Egg Works (<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theeggworks.com%2F&s=bb79dbc08329dd0ea9e563e58a186430026cf3aa2430a215f2271008035d8359\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">theeggworks.com</a>) has a a little something special up its sleeve. Its not the only place that does this, but it definitely a nice change of pace. What is it you ask? Banana nut bread as a toast option! If you didnt get excited by the last sentence, you've got issues! =). On my daily trek to work, I always pass by a mom and pops breakfast place called The Egg and I. Egg Works is by the same people and its closer to my house. We head out on a Sunday morning around 10am and this place is packed. After a minimal wait, we sit down and open the extensive menu. Its one of those menus where you find something you want on every page. After about 15 minutes we finally agree on two dishes. We order the Bacon Avocado Omelette and the Country Fried Steak and eggs. Oh yeah... This is my favorite part. \"What kind of toast would you like with your meal? We've got wheat, white, sourdough, banana nut.\" OMG. Nothing makes a yummy breakfast more yummy than a banana nut muffin that doesnt cost extra! Haha.",

Their special was the \"Heart Stopper\" Skillet, with choice of egg, toast, and sausages and potatoes topped with country gravy.  Even on a Monday, the place is packed with locals.  This is a great place if you want to get away from the high prices on the Las Vegas Strip for breakfast.  Another treat that you will enjoy is the Banana Nut Muffin.  It was well worth the trip to the West Side.  I will be returning to this fine breakfast eatery.",

The menu was just enormous and I couldn't decide between the prime rib benny and the ultimate omelet but I picked the prime rib benny which was served with seasoned potatoes and it was served on a croissant with eggs, onions, peppers and hollidaise. I also got to taste the banana nut muffin with lived up to the yelp hype. Service here was top notch even though it was packed completely. I would say the only complaint was that the hostess was not a great communicator and I had to ask a few times to figure out when we were gonna be seated...that was minor, please come try it.",

The sauce was covered on everything and it was in a bowl which made the bread soaked in it. Plus the sauce was a dark yellow and as it got cold you could see the sauce clumping together. It was horrible! The fries were covered in seasoning that you couldn't even taste the potatoes. We also sat here for awhile before getting food and any refills. My son's got the corn beef hash and the plate was mainly potatoes. This place is great for your very basic breakfast. But, after this visit I am not going to be coming back.",

I had a waffle with bananas and scrambled eggs and bacon. I the waffle was like cardboard. I couldn't eat more than one bite. I ate most of my eggs, but I felt nauseous afterwards. I also ordered hot chocolate which was pretty good, but thats about it. My husband didn't like his food either - an omelet with sausage links.  The plate with the sausage was swimming in grease. He couldn't even look at it, never mind taste it. We won't be back b/c of the quality of the food.",

The place was already packed at 9 am, luckily we only had to wait for about 10 minutes.  The servers were nice enough to bring my friends a cup of coffee while we were waiting.    The menu has all the standard breakfast items: omelets, skillets, pancakes, waffles, french toast, etc.  Then there are also sandwiches, salads, crepes, and even a special \"Cincinnati Chili\".  The portions are hefty and the quality is excellent.  The breakfast potatoes, for example, are crispy outside, soft and moist inside.  They are not soggy with shortening.  Needless to say, everyone left with a full stomach and in a good mood.    If I am ever coming home from an all night bender and in the mood for a western style breakfast, EggWorks is tops on the list!",

    "text": "You'll rarely find me reviewing breakfast places, as my body has a tendency to not turn on my appetite until I've already been awake for two or three hours.  So coming from me, a four star review of a breakfast place is a great thing.  Egg Works helped me get my breakfast fix that I've been craving for the past week.  I have dined here before, but I saw Jen S. post his review of this place this past Friday, and that helped me decide where to get breakfast!  So on those rare occasions when I do breakfast, I love me some eggs benedict.  So I decided to love me some eggs benedict through Egg Works' \"Works Veggie Benny,\" which their menu describes as, \"English muffin grilled brown, topped with grilled tomatoes, fresh spinach, sliced avocado,two poached eggs and hollandaise sauce, sauce then we serve it with a side of Works potatoes.\"    First things first: the Works potatoes are amazing.  I will eat potatoes in any form, whether it be baked or mashed or anything in between, and the Works potatoes are at the top of my list.  They are crispy on the outside but maintain that starchy softness inside, and are served with a salt/spice seasoning that make these taters into little breakfast fries.  The Works Veggie Benny itself was good.  The avocado and tomato sounded delicious and refreshing, but was overpowered by the hollandaise sauce.  I think one of the poached eggs \"popped\" prematurely and got yolk mixed in with the hollandaise, leading to a soupy consistency that smothered my veggies.  Not a bad thing, but I wasn't used to my hollandaise being so runny.  Outside of that, the food was delicious, though I think next time I'll be going with a Benny that has some bacon or sausage to go with that sauce.  The meal also came with a slice of watermelon and honey dew; fruit is always a pleasant way to round out your breakfast.  My friend got the Spinach Benny, and we both got coffee, which led to a bill of $25 for the both of us.  Each entree was just under $10, with the coffee being about $2.50 or so.  I am definitely coming back here again, I just can't guarantee when!  Once I try some of their skillets, scrambles, omelets (they have quite the menu!) I have no doubt that my four stars will be bumped to five.",

We were seated promptly and there were a good amount of people in the restaurant which is always a good sign. I ordered the COUNTRY BENNY Buttermilk biscuits grilled, and topped with patty sausage, covered in their sausage gravy with a side of scrambled eggs. I WAS IN FATTY HEAVEN. I usually get scared ordering anything with gravy anywhere because it always either seems too bland or too runny or too something. BUT LET ME TELL YOU... this sausage gravy was on point. I ate everything off of my plate and my friends plate. That's how much I love egg works. Our server was great too! Sadly, forgot her name, but she had the cutest tattoos on her. She checked on us made sure we enjoyed out meal and gave us a FREE MUFFIN! Maybe she saw me licking my plate and thought I was still hungry ;) Definitely going back next visit!",

Flamingo.   5 minutes away and 15 minutes later we were sat with a party of 8 adults.   There was just as big a crowd in a much smaller restaurant.   We pass our food around to sample soo heres my story...   Main reason though this gets a 5 is...  Cottage Cheese is the BEST EVER period. Whatever was on top of it melted in my mouth.  Food portions HUGE cost LOW (109.00 total with 8 big appetites) really impressive presentation for what is normally basic stuff.. hard to be creative with breakfast but they pull it off.   Banana Bread French Toast... bit more of a dessert however it was SOOO GOOD!   Potato Omelet original to me at least and we all secretly love starch on starch on starch on starch.......   and the hostess had some Barbarella like hair do and was fun and took pics with us all... just great time this AM.....",

First time, I was very impressed with the variety of things on the menu, although it is a little pricey, I figured it would be worth it.  I was somewhat right.  Everything was delicious and the portions are HUGE.  I didnt like the seasoning on the homefries though, but it was alright. Second time around, we get this server who has one of those, overly fake, I secretly hate my job but act like im so happy personalities (Im a waitress as well, So I notice these things)  I loooove waffles so I figured theirs would be great, unfortunatly it was nasty.  Tasted like plastic, and I enjoyed the whipped cream more. The reason I am giving such a poor rating is because both times we went they brought out the wrong food.  Although both times it was corrected, It's just sad that it wasnt even busy and they just seem so unorganized.  For the price of the food, its really not worth it.  Dennys or Ihop would suffice.",

This place is also the same as the Egg & I and I have eaten at both spots and they are both excelent.   There menu is awesome with all the regular stuff plus with crepes, omelets, scrabbles, skillets, bennys, and hawaiian breakfasts.  They also have a cincy chili section that I like, I have never had cincy chili for real but I know what it's all about (over spaghetti) and this chili is real good.  You can also get toast or a banana nut muffin with your meal.      They do everything well and I have never been disappointed with anything but my favorites are the cincy chili omelet, enchilada omelet, and anything with their excellent country gravy all over it.  They have a chicken fries steak skillet that is potatoes topped with chopped up fried steak, topped with gravy, topped with eggs however u want, it is AWESOME.  They also won some awards for their cincy chili burger but I have never had it.     My good friend and fellow yelper used to think cracked egg was the best place in town and refused to eat here for some stupid reason.  Well we ate here and he was mad at himself for missing out on this place for all these years, don't make the same mistake.",

    "text": "Ill admit it, Im easy....on breakfast places.  In my opinion, producing good solid breakfasts isnt exactly rocket science so most places that specialize in it usually get a pretty good ranking from me.  Even with my modest expectations, my visit to Egg Works was a pleasant surprise. The menu was varied, the portions generous and the service crisp.    After just getting destroyed by some octogenarians at the 9am bingo session, I decided I need to assuage my wounds in some eggs and potatoes.  I had been meaning to try Egg Works so after inviting my mom to come with me (hey someones got to pay after the drubbing I took) we entered the surprisingly rustic and charming restaurant for a late breakfast,  My mom instantly loved the bucolic decorations and I loved the big plasma tv's playing the World Cup games.  Distractions aside, we both commented on the wonderfully large menu and were impressed to even see ethnic Hawaiian and Mexican options.     I opted for the Sunrise Special which was essentially a greek omelet with feta cheese, spinach, tomatoes and artichoke hearts.  Accompanying the omelet was breakfast potatoes and my choice of their famous banana nut muffins or toast.  Wanting to kick it a tad more old school (with the bingo I was certainly kicking it old, old, old school), I opted for the toast.  Mom had the eggs benedict which she found to be exactly what the doc ordered.  As for my omelet, it was perfectly fluffy with the right balance of filling.  The potatoes were seasoned and plentiful however, they looked to be frozen and not freshly made.  I love fresh homefries and this was a slight disappointment.  Otherwise, by the end of meal I was full and ready to wash the dauber stains off my hands.    Overall, Egg Works is a fun, neighborhood breakfast joint.  Its larger than meets the eye which Im sure helps move crowds on the weekends.  Service was consistent and friendly and the prices were very reasonable, especially given how much food each dish seems to contain.  Both our meals were in the 9 dollar range and there were few things that really exceeded that in price.  They also are open for lunch and have a selection of salads, sandwiches and burgers.    Diagnosis:  Delicious!",

    "text": "Celebrity sightings alert! Given the star power that regularly graces the Strip, my Egg Works sighting might not be too stirring, but when I saw members of the Wranglers hockey team, it thrilled me. They practice at the nearby ice facility, so I imagine they do coffee and eggs at the Works fairly often.  I do too, but I must admit that the 2 for 1 entree coupons in my edition of The View are a big big incentive, as is the banana nut muffin. That muffin is habit forming! Just so you know, the muffin is an option in addition to the usual toast you get offered at breakfast restaurants.  Muffin or toast: you would be crazy not to choose this muffin.  Egg Works is technically a chain; the sister restaurant close to us is The Egg & I, but I think Egg Works is a smidgen nicer. It is a newer location. There is also Egg Works II on Sunset. Completely unrelated to the food, but they have a great website, so if you have any questions, you should visit it.  As you may have guessed, eggs are their specialty, so there are plenty of omelets and scrambles and sunny-side ups. The menu is pretty extensive, and they do have non-egg items such as buckwheat pancakes! They also have lunch, including hamburgers. They offer egg whites and egg substitute in addition to your regular chicken eggs. Often, the tastiest thing is their special of the day. The best thing I have eaten there was a chicken and pesto scramble special! Generally, I will get a scramble with vegetables, which are always fresh, not canned. I will say that the eggs can taste pretty plain, but I think they want to leave it to you to add salt, pepper and hot sauce to satisfy your own personal taste level.   The serving sizes are very generous and include a mighty helping of their breakfast potatoes. The potatoes are diced and are not greasy at all. The secret to their tastiness is the magic dust--a little spicy, a little salty, a lot of yummy.   The service is always attentive, and the servers generally look like they are having fun. They work as a team, which always makes service snappier. If you need something, there is a little egg on your table that you can flip. Now that's using your egg. Bwahahaha!  Overall, I think that Egg Works is a solid option for breakfast. There is something for everyone, the ingredients are fresh and the execution is respeggtable. (I can't resist a good egg pun.)",

I was a little confused about an egg-crepe at first because I think of crepes as sweet and not usually egg-filled. But, to my delight, it was absolutely perfect! It reminded me more of an egg quesadilla, and it came with a heaping side of breakfast potatoes.  Of course I had a bloody mary, and I have to say this one made my top 5 list..... if anything because it is served in a mason jar!

It's right around the corner from his house but he'd never even heard of it.  We got there around 7:30am and there was a decent crowd there...  about a half hour later there was a line of people waiting.  Guess we had good timing!  I went with the chili skillet...  it was delicious...  It came with their potatoes on the bottom, with some slightly spicy chili, a good bit of melted cheese, and two eggs on top.  Definitely would recommend this one.  Perfect portion size and with a nice sweet slice of pineapple on the side of the plate.  My buddy went with the Denver Omelet...  Iooked great... nice and big (4 egg), well-filled.  He ate the whole thing so it must have been good!  He wasn't a big fan of the potatoes...  Their potatoes are the small rectangular/squarish ones....  kinda heavily seasoned.  He and I both prefer a more traditional hash brown.  Not sure if they're available though.  My skillet had the potatoes.... which were really good with chili and cheese on them... but as a side dish I wouldn't have been crazy about them.  Service was quick, friendly, and efficient.  They have to be to keep the crowd moving!  Would definitely go back... and would probably get the same thing.  Just don't try going much after 7:30am on a Sunday though, unless waiting in lines is your thing.",
