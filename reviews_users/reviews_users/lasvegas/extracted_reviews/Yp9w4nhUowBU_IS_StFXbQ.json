The food is great and the portions aren't as chihuahua size as other French restaurants.  People may complain that it may be too pricey for breakfast or lunch, but compare to the other restaurants at the Wynn it is quite reasonable and fair.  The inside decor is quite clean and simple. I like it during the day because it is not too flashy and has a wonderful view.  It is a great place to dine for brunch with the gals.",

The main dining room is also very nice...a little dimmer and more romantic.   The food selections included such things as a sublime lobster salad as well as a rather rich, but oh-so-divine Kobe short rib (topped with whole eggs and Bernaise sauce).   And the service was excellent. My GF and I shared the lobster wonton soup, house lox and bagel, and the lobster salad. They split everything and served it up in three courses. The lobster salad on its own has one fried egg (it's fried whole somehow with the yolk still runny), but when they split the dish, they fried up an extra one. Aww geez...that was so sweet :)  What a way to end my last two Vegas trips....*sigh*  :D",

I ordered the eggs benedict and coffee - more than enough food for myself and then some. My friends ordered omelets and a breakfast platter (split between 2 and still enough food)   The ambience is the main attraction - food was good - service was okay.",

    "text": "I went to Tableau on the recommendation of two friends who had eaten brunch there the previous day - and who wanted our whole group to go back for lunch before we left Vegas.  Vegas has a lot of restaurants (in case you didn't know) so the fact that these two felt strongly about eating at the same spot twice in a three day trip bode well for our meal.  And holy moly roly poly.  I'd eat here every day if I could.  First of all, the place is darling.  It feels intimate and the decor is vaguely dollhouse, a great spot for a fancy tea party.  Or brunch, I suppose.  The service - stellar.  The presentation is sweet, with bread in individual tins and hot chocolate served in a fancy pot.  But most important - the food is superb!    I started with a warm portobello mushroom soup that was poured out of a beautiful little teapot over some little lobster raviolis.  This is one of the best soups I've ever had the pleasure of planting my face in, with deep flavor and that perfect buttony mushroom texture.  After polishing that off like a starved orphan, I moved on to an outstanding steak salad with balsamic, blue cheese, bacon, and more mushrooms.  That was another clean plate.  I finished out the meal (hey, it was my last of the trip, don't judge) with a gorgeous parfait with plenty of berries and lemon custard that was out of this world.  My friends all seemed to enjoy their food as well, and the miscellaneous bites I stole were all fantastic.  I will also mention that the fries are great, and the homemade ketchup (in which you can actually see tiny seeds!) is really several cuts above the bottled stuff.  Definitely give this place a go.  I can't wait to go back.",

A friend and I had the Potato crushed Dover Sole which was pretty nondescript. Two others had the red snapper, and both came highly recommended by are jovial server. No skirts were blown that is for sure. Now the Trio of pie dessert was fabulous.  A couple other points: We had coat problems too. The hostess rested them on the back on our chairs but two of us were on a couch ah..guess I will use it as a Napkin.  Same issues with our bags--we were not offered a holder and other--much richer looking diners did. Who knows, maybe they only have 5 holders, but everyone who had one was in Haute Coutour for sure. I guess my Diesel jeans ans Burberry sweater was too causal.  I might go back to try the breakfast but hey--Bouchon rocks that pretty well.",

We went there for brunch and sat on the patio which overlooked a highly manicured garden and small pool (built in entertainment included 50 something fat mob type with very young and very large fake boobed girlfriend who was obviously practically having sex with him in the pool at 11:30 in the morning because they connect spiritually).  What do you expect?  Anyways, beside that- this place was pretty good.  The service was very professional and competent, albeit a tad snooty.  I started with a bib salad on a bed of prosciutto garnished with pistachio encrusted spears of asparagus.  Then, being hungover and ravenous, could not resist the Kobe burger.  YUM.  Cooked medium rare, juicy, tender and flavorful.  It came with fries but I subbed for the chick pea onion rings.  SUPER crispy!  The ultimate indulgence.  Since my main man has been on an eggs benedict quest of sorts for a couple of years now- when he saw braised Kobe short rib eggs benedict on the menu, he almost had an aneurysm.   Needless to say, he found these quite satisfactory.",

My first lunch I think it was our waiter's first day.  He refilled my CEO's Pelligrino with tap water haha.   The waiter also seemed quite awkward and nervous.   My second time there, our waiter was not very attentive.  I would expect a higher calibur of service from such an expensive restaurant like that.  Chicken and something- man, it was that unmemorable.  I do remember the chicken was dry and that the sauce was overpowering like a hoisin sauce.  Yeck. Seared ahi- this dish was good Lobster salad- great pieces of lobster, the rest of the salad was a little lacking in flavor Clam Chowder- they put like 6 pieces of clam in a bowl and take a pitcher and fill in the broth.  It was weird...and not good. Scallops and shredded beef- that was the weirdest combination I've ever had.  Gross. *No, I did NOT order all those dishes, but we all shared and ate off each other's plates.  haha.   I would not come here again.  Spend your money at the blackjack tables instead!  ;)",

I love staying at the Wynn property because of the usually excellent attention to detail and really great restaurants, casual to fine dining.  We decided to try Tableau for brunch. Very, very disappointed.  I ordered the arugula salad that was horrible.  Half of the arugula was slimy and dark green/black.  Maybe it's just me, but I think the greens should be vibrant, intact(no rotting bits), and taste like arugula should.The waitress didn't seem to think much was anything wrong with it.  I don't think she addressed it with the chef, as no further mention was made of it and she did not take it off the bill.  I did not pursue any further complaint because I did not want to make anyone in my party uncomfortable. Asked for bread...they didn't bring it. They were not busy at all...maybe with good reason because I sure won't be back. A few observations:    Heirloom Tomato Salad ($20)-  presentation bare bones - sliced with balsamic dressing drizzled on.  Please..... Wasabi Bloody Mary (~$14)was lacking presentation as well...the cucumber slice was wilted and dried, unappetizing.",

    "text": "In a nutshell:  go!  But take out a second mortgage first!  :-)  We had the chef's tasting menu.  If you think hoity toity restaurants don't give you enough food, you're gonna love Tableau.  Though I'm not a huge eater, I have earned enough remarks on how such a skinny guy can eat so much.  By the time we're done with all seven courses, I was completely ready to throw in the napkin, if not actually throw up in it.  Everything was very good and there were only one or two rough spots, though it won't be much of a stretch to forgive Tableau for those.  The amuse bouche was a mouthful of white bean and bacon soup.  Too bad it was an amuse bouche 'cause we've loved some more!  The first course was a \"club sandwich\" of smoked salmon w/ dill cream, paired with a tiny cup of white onion soup topped w/ a dollop of creme fraiche, both with a touch of caviar.  Mmmm... good!  Then it was grilled foie gras on a maple walnut beignet.  Here's one of the rough spot, if you can call it that:  they could have cut back a bit on the foie gras.  It was a pretty big piece.  Following that is another small rough spot:  seared scallops w/ frog leg risotto.  The scallop was *EVER* so slightly overdone.  Not enough to be chewy, but it definitely should have been more tender.  The frog leg risotto was the dish's saving grace, creamy, fluffy, beautifully seasoned.  Then it was the \"surf and turf\" portion of the menu:  black pepper crusted (yeah, I know, a bit cliche'ed) ahi tune steak on navy beans a broccoli rabe.  The tuna would seem a tad too salty, but was perfect when paired with the beans and the rabe.  The \"turf\" was a filet migon, again a tad on the \"healthy\" side size-wise, with sauteed pearl onions, atop two cute little oxtail stuffed canelloni.  Extremely clever!  By now, my wife was on the verge of passing out from all the food.  And she didn't even finish her tuna or her steak, leaving half of each.  And she's not a light eater, neither!  I was almost done as well, secretly hoping that the closing two courses would be either mercifully small or not so great, or both, so I wouldn't have to eat 'em all!  No such luck:  the \"fruit & cheese\" course was a pear walnut tart, with a piece of a fairly smelly but oh-so-delish cheese.  The dessert course:  my word!  It was: Frangelico creme brulet, Godiva peanut butter chocolate mousse, and maple syrup icecream.  I have *NO* sweet tooth at all, yet I finished everything, that's how good the dessert was.  The fun touches were:  Tableau is accessible only through the \"lobby\" entrance to Wynn's suites: we were greeted with supremely appropriate doses of deference, respect, and helpfulness;  tiny low stool/footrest that the wait staff would position next to each woman, so she has a place for her purse;  a \"foodie\" wait staff:  out waiter had eaten at the fabled \"The French Laundry\"!",

Best sausages I ever had in U.S. The scamble eggs were just normal but the portion was huge. I didn't finish my eggs. The hash brown was not your normal hash brown....but in a good way.....it shaped like small cakes and the texture of them were really special and very delicated. i think it's not easy to make a plain old hash brown taste delicated. But the best part came after I asked for Ketchup for my hash brown. I was expecting a bottle of Hein's ketchup....but no....they gave me a cup of fresh-made ketchup....that kinda blew me away......well... .at that point....I finially realized what is fine dining for breakfast.... The fresh-made ketchu tasted so good and so fresh....I finished my hash brown cakes just because I wanted to have the ketchup.  anyway.....the taste and quality of the food totally worth the price. In my opinion, the breakfast we could order to our room can't compare with breakfast I had in Tableau, althought they price about the same.   Besides, at Tableau, I can enjoy the good view, excellent serivce, silver tableware, and fresh-made ketchup... :P",

I appreciate their decision to serve Intelligentsia brews, but to offer only a dark roast and decaf option is baffling. I prefer a light roast, medium if I have to - dark roasted coffee mutes the flavor of the beans and adds a bitterness that some find bracing but I find off putting. I still appreciated the brew, but it seemed a shame that I had to add sugar to a ten dollar cup of coffee, even if it was complimentary. I ordered the breakfast sandwich on a whim, but it fell short of my expectations as well. The bacon and tomato jam were top notch, but the brioche roll and fried eggs seemed ill conceived. For one, I prefer the bread for a sandwich like that to be crispy. Then, the fried eggs, delicately and carefully cooked in butter leaving a pristine white with nary a fleck of brown, were completely wrong for this sandwich. The perfectly runny egg yolk dripped onto my fingers and all over the plate, and turned the roll to a soggy mess. There are many fine opportunities to break out showy culinary school techniques, but a breakfast sandwich is not one of them.",

As Tower Suite guests, we were told upon check-in that our complimentary breakfasts would be at Tableau. We were shown where it was and given the hours.  The first morning there, we had a lovely experience. We were seated immediately, and our server was wonderful. She even helped direct us on where to go to reserve a pool cabana for the day.   We were given the menus specifically for Tower Suite guests. We couldn't choose from the entire menu for our breakfast, but the menu they provided was still great. I went with the Garden Frittata and it was delicious. Husband went with a salmon bagel. Based on Day 1, our experience would have been 5 stars.  Morning 2, a Wednesday, we came down. The restaurant was a little busier than the day before, but there was still lots of seating. Maria at the hostess table told us it would be a 45 minute wait for a table without a reservation. Rewind to our check-in, no one told us to make reservations. They told us to just head on down between the specified hours. Marcelo told them that we are tower suite guests, and we were then offered a table outside. Fine! After the lecture on reservations, we made a reservation for the following morning at 9:15 am, just to avoid any issue.  We were seated outside were we had our choice between quite a few tables. I naturally grabbed one in the shade. Again, the food was great. I went with whole wheat pancakes with a side of veggie sausage. Marcelo had the acai, and as a Brasilian, he confirmed that it's a good one. No complaints on food.  At the end of the meal, their computers went down so we had to wait awhile for our receipt. They all had to be handwritten by the manager. It finally arrived, and we were on our way.  Day 3! We head on down at 9:10 for our 9:15 reservation! The young girl at the front desk can't find it. She says it was never put in. We stressed that we made it the day before with Maria after the whole ordeal. We sat outside and waited about 10-15 minutes for a table.  Once seated, we were handed the full menus. We asked for the menus that guests of the tower get, the ones we were given the previous 2 days. Our waitress told us she had to check on our reservation. She came back and said that the front desk told her that our complimentary breakfasts were at the buffet. News to us!!! We told her that the front desk told us it was HERE, and that it wasn't a problem the previous two days. She was a little uncomfortable and clearly didn't know what to say or do. We just ordered from the full menus.  It was a really frustrating experience. We came to the Wynn to spend money and be treated well. We did everything we were told to do, and things still went wrong. Plus, who we see and how we are treated at breakfast set the tone for the whole day! After going back and forth with our server this morning that we were in the correct place and have her not even try to do any problem solving, we sat in frustrated silence while waiting for our food to arrive. We concluded that we should have stayed at the Cosmo instead. We came to spend 4 days before this baby comes out of me, so we were looking to spend a lot of money (which we did) and have fun. It just sucks to be treated poorly, knowing how much money we pumped into the building the last 4 days. We definitely felt like if you're young with money, this isn't the place for you.",

We had a lunch there on our arrival to the Wynn and our waiter took a solid 30 minutes to acknowledge our existence.  We were hungry and ordered our appetizers simultaneously (truffle beef tartare) as the entrees (salmon) and both arrived at the same time with the salmon being overcooked to the point of cafeteria standards.  Adding insult to injury, as a French restaurant I would expect the bread service to be a point of pride but I was unaware they even had such until we were half done with our meals and I noticed it going out to other tables.  When I broached I would like some bread with the server he seemed put off.  I have enjoyed higher quality French fare at every French restaurant I have ever dined in.  Go to the Venetian for dinner at Thomas Keller's restaurant.",

The sauce, the salmon...the fact that they take off the center of the bread and fill it in with cream cheese...mouth watering and just perfect.  The banana bread french toast was really sweet and it's more like a banana bread with syrup then traditional french toast.  As a tip, get the round medallion hash as a side dish. You won't regret it. The salmon Benedict came with 1 but that wasn't nearly enough.   The ambiance is wonderful as a major plus.   I will be back, a top spot for me in vegas for sure.   A solid 5-stars.",

The tableau breakfast is your best bet, even though all the items are over priced, this is the best bang for your buck. The acaii bowl was kind of a joke, the eggs benedict was like supermarket ham on a english muffin with a small amount of hollandaise sauce. The breakfast sandwich was something you would make at home. The coffee tore my stomach apart every morning and the grapefruit and orange juice were tasty, but the same price as two cartons. Lol. I went back for convenience of staying in the tower suites and didn't want to make breakfast a big production. Wait times with reservations can get out of hand here.",

Food is really good.  I'm all about their homemade ketchup lol I've had almost everything on the menu starting with the Spanish omelette to french toast. Their avocado appetizer is great but you need to order a side of chips to go with it. Tableau hash is yummy and I enjoy it more than the main which was eggs benedict.   This time I ordered a chicken sandwich, poached shrimp salad, truffle fries and some avocado and chips. Right when I grabbed my sandwich, I found some lint on my fried chicken so I took it off. I was going to just eat it then I found more lint on the other side of chicken as it my chicken rolled on a towel or sweater. I had to ask the waitress to take it back. Lost my appetite so I did not order another dish.   Waitress told me it must have been from towels and that they always sanitize the kitchen all day. Well... Still, there shouldn't be lint on my chicken sandwich. If there's lint lying around the kitchen because you sanitize too much, it means it is not sanitary.   I'm pretty disappointed about ruining my brunch because I liked this place.  Would I return? Maybe. Maybe not.",

While the food was decent, the service was not up-to-par to that of other restaurants at Wynn.   With the exception of several carb-heavy dishes, the food at Tableau was overpriced for its quality. Although I liked the fact that my butternut squash soup was not too sweet, I was not a fan of the stale almonds in it. The Greek yogurt was light and went well with the berries. While the orange zest juice was refreshing, its portion was small compared to its competitors like MOzen. At the same time, my friend greatly enjoyed the Duck Croque Madame - the duck meat was very tender and juicy, while the croissant was warm and flaky.   In terms of service, the waitress was unfriendly and only stopped by our table once after she took the order. She also forgot about one of our dishes until I reminded her in the end of the meal.   Since the restaurant is always packed, I definitely recommend Yelpers to make reservations in advance. My friends and I plan to give Tableau another try and order its famous pancakes in our next visit.",

Chatting on his Vertu in a strange language (something arabic I believe) I couldn't help but notice my neighbor's Constantin Patrimony Series watch flashing in the sunlight of Tableau's patio...clearly there was money around. When the waiter arrived to refill his water and asked if he could get the check the man pulled out a money clip, peeled off two $100 bills and said \"that should cover it\" before getting up and walking away...the man had ordered a fruit plate. Tucked away in the gardens and pools of the Wynn Tableau is both rich and beautiful in appearance, much like its patrons. Sure I didn't expect low quality from Steve Wynn, but to say the clientele of Tableau was \"well to do\" would be a vast understatement.  Arriving at 7:45am I was greeted by the gorgeous lobby and the gracious hostess who asked whether I would prefer dining indoors or on the patio. As the patio was amply shaded and most of the patrons were outside I chose the patio and was subsequently offered a copy of the Wallstreet Journal, New York Times, or USA Today to browse. Seeing the headlines regarding the USC upset, I opted for the USA Today (clearly indicating my status compared to the rest of the diners who sat browsing the Times or Journal) and chose a wonderful table half sunny/half shaded with a great view of the pool and gardens. Water was filled and the menu was delivered while the waiter went to get my coffee.  Browsing the menu I was instantly captured by the pastry basket and the Peach pancakes, but not being hungry enough for both decided to ask the waiter what was available in the basket. Approximately 10 items were rattled off including an apricot tart, apple scone, and nectarine turnover. When I asked if pastries could be ordered individually it was explained that these were 'petite' pastries and if I wanted to try only one it would be free of charge. \"A nectarine turnover and the peach pancakes, please.\" \"Certainly, sir.\"  While I waited for my food I stood up and roamed the pools and gardens. Approximately 20 people were present at the time, all dressed either business casual or semi-formal and all dining on items ranging from the freshest appearing fruits to pastries to eggs and sausage that looked incredible. When I returned to my table (my tableau?) my coffee was waiting along with cream and sugar/spelda/equal. No nutrasweet was to be seen and when asked I was informed \"Mr Wynn does not fancy nutrasweet.\" Fair enough (for what it is worth, Alex also didn't have Nutrasweet but noted they could obtain it immediately if I desired.)  After approximately 10 minutes a fantastic yet dainty apricot turnover arrived fresh from the oven. Crispy, flaky, loaded with fresh nectarines it was the perfect opener to the meal and I'd have certainly enjoyed many more had I ordered the basket. Another 10 minutes and a laugh at the Trojans passed, my coffee was refilled once, and then my pancakes emerged from the kitchen.  Described in the menu as Ricotta Peach Pancakes with lime butter and organic maple syrup, nothing could've prepared me for these pancakes. Fluffy and light, airy yet moist, sweet yet savory and absolutely jammed with fresh skinned peaches, the dish was presented with a simple dusting of powdered sugar, a side-pitcher of warm syrup, and a dollop on the side that tasted like a fresh key lime dissolved in butter. Having tried Ricotta Pancakes only once before but any number of stellar pancakes in the past, this dish was a revolution and I truly sat and savored each bite. Sure, $14 for three pancakes is not a bargain, but $14 for breakfast bliss? That is a bargain.  When I finished my pancakes and resisted the urge to lick my plate clean my waiter arrived and asked if he could get me anything else. \"Perhaps a coffee to go?\" \"....don't twist my arm....how about another turnover too?\" \"Certainly, sir.\" While I didn't tip $185 like my neighbor, I certainly wish I could have.  On my way out everyone was very friendly, from the other waiters to the hostess, making each guest feel like their visit was truly valued. I was even invited to return for dinner, but when I told the hostess we had reservations for Alex that evening she noted \"oh, excellent choice, perhaps some other time.\" All told the meal was fantastic and on par with Bouchon in terms of quality, presentation, and service. Go early, sit on the patio, eat, smile, and enjoy the richness of the food and the clientele...even if you yourself aren't rich...sometimes it's fun to see how the upper crust lives.",

Ordered the Filet Oscar Benedict and my wife had a Duck, Hash & Egg.  My \"filet\" came well done instead of rare that I ordered, to the server's credit, she did quickly sent it back and got me a new order. Food tasted good, though, the \"filet\" as describe on menu as beef tenderloin was definitely not tenderloin, it was a tough cut. For that reason, it's tough to justify for five stars rating when the menu was mis-leading and the chef messed up a rare filet with a well done filet.",

    "text": "Lesson learned: it's not worth paying the extra few bucks for a 'kobe' beef burger.  When the meat is in its minced state, you can't tell which part of the cow the meat really came from.    In the spirit of finding a new brunch service that could exceed or at the very least match tried-and-tested Bouchon, I came across Tableau.  It looks fancy, it's in the fancier, poshier part of the Wynn (if that's even possible!), it's hard enough to find so nobody would just chance upon it, and the glass rotunda in the middle is definitely where the better tables are.  The four of us were lucky enough to get one of them.    The service was excellent, we never had to ask for the server to top up our coffee and there was never a time that we had to flag down our server.    The food though, was a bit of a let down.  Maybe I should've tried the orange-infused French toast with honey butter or the eggs benny that a few other yelpers were raving about, instead of the burger, because the burger was, well, ordinary in every way possible.  The hub had an omelet that was too overpowered by onion and the side of bacon was just so so.    So given the price, I would rather go back to Bouchon for their blueberry friands, sourdough bread, chocolate croissant and pommes frites. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/bouchon-las-vegas#hrid:PjzTZX9Il0c4LV-ezt13hA\">yelp.com/biz/bouchon-las...</a>",

I had their French toast infused with orange and topped with honey butter one morning, then their peach pancakes the next morning. Both are solid choices if your sweet tooth is in need of some caring for breakfast.   My side of eggs were cooked perfectly, over-easy, just how I like them. I had a sampling of the breakfast potatoes which were as delicious as breakfast potatoes should be. I was hoping the elk sausage would be savory...and only savory. If you're not into sweet and savory simultaneously on your taste buds, pass on the elk.   Drinks? I heard their coffee was great and their watermelon juice was amazing.   Dear vegan and vegetarian friends, don't worry, they (along with several other restaurants in the Wynn and Encore) have a vegan menu as well... Just a head's up: Those delicious peach pancakes are on it!  Worth the price? Heck yeah!",

When we sat down our waiter came around and my first impression was that he was overly cavalier. As the meal went on he kind of grew on me, especially because having recently injured my shoulder my right arm was in a sling and he had the food pre-chopped such that I could eat it one-handed with ease. Now on to the food.   I  ordered the mixed greens which tasted fresh and the dressing was light rather than overpowering as most dressings seem to be these days. It allowed the flavor of the various greens to shine through. Afterword for the main course I got the wild mushroom tamales. They were moist and fluffy. The seasonings were just perfect, and the jicama on the side really hit the spot. These were the best tamales I have ever had, though to be honest I am not a tamale connoisseur.  After lunch we sat back with some tea and enjoyed the myriad of birds flying around and even attracted quite a few by feeding them a bit of scraps. All in all it was a very pleasant way to spend our time.",

I had a glass of fresh queezed watermelon juice that was refreshing, but I wish it was a bit colder. I ordered the eggs benedict which were delicious. My only complaint about the dish is that the muffins were toasted so much that it was difficult to cut. I also ordered a half order of the white chocolate and peach pancakes for my friends and I to share. They were really good. Nice and light and sweet. Yum! My friends ordered the dungeoness crab club, elk sauage and eggs, and a fruit platter. We got to try each other's dishes and they were all delicious! I liked how fresh, light, and healthy the crab club tasted.   We also ordered the soufle for desert and it was good. I like my soufle a bit more bitter and warmer but it was still pretty good.  Overall this place is a great spot for brunch and definitely worth the little extra money compared to other alternatives.",

Tableau is a fancy cafe style restaurant in the corner of the Wynn in Las Vegas.  Seated on the edge of the pool and garden with a spectacular indoor rounded lanai seating area, this place is beautiful and worth waiting ten to fifteen minutes for a table for breakfast.    I had the chicken apple sausage with their pancakes topped with peach compote in honey preserve and some pastry with coffee and water.    I have to emphasize the beauty of this breakfast.  The pancakes were fluffy and had the right texture to them when cutting into them.  As the fruit compote soaked into each pancake, my breakfast experience would increase exponentially toward heaven.  But the sausage--oh! the sausage--was to die for.  I dreamt of that sausage for weeks and want to go back just for a side order of sausage with those delectable pancakes.  Their sausage, made in house, has a perfect texture and the right thickness of skin that has that bite to it when you chew it.  The flavors of the apple and chicken mixture are heaven on my palette and I could eat fifty more in one sitting.    You must eat breakfast here.  Their pancakes are worth the 18 dollar price tag, as is that heavenly sausage.  Please, I beg of you--try this place if you have the time. You won't regret it.  Tip: make reservations.  They start taking reservations at 6am.",

    "text": "Tableau takes the brunch experience to the ultimate level of dining sophistication. From the moment we sat down, we were greeted so warmly by the staff. We ordered vanilla lattes to start. I love the fact the latte was accompanied by a decorative rock sugar on a stick if we needed to enhance the flavor of our latte.   It was my first time actually trying eggs benedict and was delighted to have tried it at Tableau. I tried both the traditional version which consists of an english muffin, shaved country ham, poached eggs, and hollandaise sauce. I also tried the filet which also consists of an english muffin, beef tenderloin, blue crab, and chive hollandaise. I think I liked the filet eggs benedict better because of its delicious blue crab and beef tenderloin. It is a great place to bring a date/significant other or have some nice conversation and meal with friends.",

    "text": "My family and I had complimentary breakfasts at Tableau as part of suite guest's perks. We were allowed to choose from a selected menu - one entree plus drink (coffee, juice, or tea) per person.  Since we stayed in the suite for three nights, we were able to visit and sample Tableau's breakfast menu multiple times.  Most of the items were pretty generic (oatmeal, parfait, fruit platter, eggs Benedict, lox and bagel). But there were also a handful of items such as aged cheddar cheese, scallion waffles with pressed duck, pineapple coconut whole wheat pancakes, and strawberry shortcake buttermilk pancakes.   The aged cheddar cheese and scallion waffles were the best waffles I'd had to date! Smothered in their perfectly sweetened blackberry sauce - sweet and savoury all in one bite. Crunchy on the outside, soft and gooey on the inside. I polished all 4 in no time. The duck was beautifully cooked but the sauce just wasn't for me (too salty - tasted a bit like straight soy sauce).   Both pancakes were tasty but neither was something I would ever crave. Acai booster was a lighter choice I went with on my second day - reminded me of Jamba Juice (how do ppl feel full from this?). Smoothie like with a handful of berries and sprinkles of granola plus honey - refreshing and delicious.   Bread basket - part of Tableau signature breakfast - house made Danish, muffin, croissant, and donut holes. Paired with house made jam, marmalade, and butter - thankfully refills weren't complimentary or I would have devoured another basket myself... or maybe two more.   Service - depending on who you get - we felt totally pampered and catered to to completely ignored and annoyed.   Overall - if it wasn't for the complimentary offer, doubt we would had visited it especially for the price point. But if you are looking to treat yourself and have a relaxing meal - make sure to ask for Vanessa to serve you!",

    "text": "Let's start off by saying this place isn't the cheapest of places so be prepared to spend a little extra. However, the food and service are too good for me to pass up a 5 star (okay, if I could, I'd give a 4.5). My boyfriend and I came pretty hungry after our flight to Las Vegas and we're slightly disgruntled when we arrived to Tableau around 11 AM and heard we would have to wait about 30 minutes for a table. Luckily they said we could walk around and they could text our cell when a table became free. We walked around the hotel (which is very pretty!) and before we knew it, a table was ready. In fact, a lot of tables were open when we returned so we got to choose a nice table inside next to the window (it actually got pretty hot). Our server was very friendly and helped us choose what we wanted.   We ordered (and don't judge how much we got): -Tableau Burger ($24) - so-so, the meat was good but they caramelized the onions which my boyfriend wasn't a fan of. Any burger more than $15 makes me skeptical in general though.  -Acai booster ($15) - really good but for the price, not worth. It comes in like a wine glass filled to the brim to give you an idea of how big it is. I did really like it though. -Duck Hash and Eggs ($23) - quite good. I was stuffed by this point so saved it and ate it later and it was still very good. -Steak tartare ($21) - my boyfriend really liked this but since I'm just meh about steak tartare, I'm not sure. It was good I suppose and a hefty plate size. -Jumbo Lump Crab Cakes ($24) - pass. The crab cake itself is good and apples with it arent that bad but mixed with the caramel sauce, didn't think it worked.  Also, the complimentary bread they serve is to die for, my favorites were the honey corn bread and pumpkin spice muffin SO good! The blue cheese bread is also a good savory option. I'm telling you, you have to try them all!   Overall most of food, I would say, is worth the price and staff are extremely friendly and attentive. Great experience.",

I didn't even need to use the maple syrup.   The second morning I ordered the Eggs Benedict. Again, this was done very well. One minor disappointment I had was that I ordered for the eggs to be poached medium, but they cam out  more runnier that I would have liked. Overall, it still tasted great.  Both mornings, the service was great. They greet you by name, give you a compliments of the chef before your meal, and ensure your dining experience is comfortable.",

I also sometimes get a scramble. The portion size is small.   Sides: the best potato hash circles!! Also get a side of the chicken apple sausage. You will be happy!",

Tableau is pricey, but goes out of its way to justify it.  The assorted specialty juices are good.  The selection of breads and pastries are fine as well.    Disclaimer: I've only had the breakfast fare at Tableau.  The white chocolate and orange French toast is good.  An off menu pastrami and egg special was exceptional.  The only thing I was disappointed by was the Canadian bacon on the eggs Benedict which was a bit tough.  The portions are small.  No one is getting fat eating at Tableau.  While it is possible to walk in, Tableau is popular so make a reservation.  The yelp reservation app works well and we were seated immediately when we used it.  The hostesses have had things running smoothly every time I've gone.  If the weather is nice, ask to dine on the patio.  Unless an overweight Eastern European middle aged man is sunning himself in a Speedo by the pool, it only adds to the experience.  If the fat man is sunning, focus on your table mate or the smiling wait staff.",

Nice decor, bright, airy and not too cold.   The food was not at all like the reviews said regarding the smoked salmon eggs benedict.  I'm not sure, but I would guess people are impressed by how much smoked salmon there was.  The smoked salmon was good but the eggs and hollandaise were soooo bland. Completely tasteless.  I must have read 10 reviews about how good this dish was and could not believe how bland it was.  I dine constantly in big cities so yes, the prices are remarkably high but I'm fine paying $27 for a dish if it is delicious but this was not.  It was so bland (except for the smoked salmon) and I wasn't fooled into thinking it was good because they gave me a ton of smoked salmon (and it was good not great smoked salmon).   This was not even close to my best meal in Vegas and I would not recommend it. My friends said their omlettes were good.",

Expect, to spend more than you're use to. 2) It's in the Wynn Encore. Do I need to say more? 3) You're on vacation, splurge (if you don't have the money, then why are you here?)  Moving on to the food, by far the best breakfast I've ever had. I've been to Vegas twice in the past 3 years and each visit, I have breakfast here at least 3 times. I LOVE the pancakes, super moist and fluffy. The first time I ever had it, I had the Huckleberry Pancake (seasonal), it was just sooo delicious, I went back the next day just for this. The Norwegian Eggs Benedict, was simply divine, the best I ever had and trust me I've had this plenty of times from high end restaurants to your lower end. And to top it all off, the coffee was amazing. I don't know what kind of blend it is or even if it's anything special, but it was very aromatic, not too bitter, you can definitely tell it was brewed at the right temperature.  I cannot wait for my next visit to Vegas. Definitely coming back!  (And yes, my review is catered towards breakfast only. I have not been here for lunch or dinner.)",

We all ordered something different so that we can have a taste of each dish. I ordered the purity juice, this was the perfect way to start my day off. I personally like it cold when I drink juice, so I asked for a side of ice. Just makes the raw juice taste so much better when it's cold. I went for the soft shell crab sandwich, this is a must try! It is very tasty and the crab is nice and crunchy. The batter was well made because when I took a bite into the sandwich, you can hear that crunch as you bite into it. Totally recommend this dish if you ever stop by Tableu.   I also really like how the condiments are all made out of scratch, I mean,,,how many restaurant does this nowadays? Very few I've been to does this, and this is one of them.  Service was great throughout our brunch, would definitely come back next time I'm in vegas!",

Salmon was not overcooked, and the potato hash were the BEST!  Potato hash didn't taste anything like regular hash brown.  Potato was mixed with flour, but it wasn't heavy at all.  Thumbs up!

The ambiance is extremely impressive, with such a classy setup that I completely forgot I was in the middle of Sin City.   Besides the ambiance though, I was rather disappointed by almost everything else. The service was downright terrible, with our waiter practically ignoring our table and us having to ask multiple times to get our water refilled. One redeeming factor about the long wait for food is that they brought out a complimentary plate of fruit.   The food was alright, but definitely not the quality I would expect when paying so much. The Salmon Eggs Benedict was a bit bland, and the crab sandwich had way too much batter (seriously to the point I could not taste crab anymore). The Banana Sour Cream Pancakes were great, but not worth the $17 price tag.   Also, a lot of the photos on Yelp show the most delicious looking milk chocolate souffle cake. When I asked the waiter about it, he said the souffle was discontinued over 2 years ago :(  Tableau had the potential to be great, I just wish it was executed better.",

You cannot make a bad decision on this menu  You get what you pay for and you will pay a lot and you be Very pleased with whatever you have   The service was first class and they come through with A perfect bday request answered   If you want feel like a baller or feel like a queen  Impress a date go here for the ultimate breakfast experience  GO HERE  If you care about money do not enter you will get hurt",

    "text": "To find this place inside the Wynn, follow the signs to the Tower Suite elevators. It's the Wynn so of course it's nicely decorated, with a bright airy feel, nice artwork and both indoor and outdoor seating. A special touch are the little stools they provide for you to set your designer handbag. No joke, I posted a photo.  I made a reservation for brunch, but that didn't seem to do much good since we still waited 20 minutes for a table. Despite this annoyance, we enjoyed our food and our server was very pleasant, so Tableau still  warrants 4 stars.   Many Yelper's posted pictures of peach pancakes, but they didn't have this on the menu. Instead, we ordered the Orange and White Chocolate French Toast, delicious.   I read somewhere that Steve Wynn is now Vegan and for this reason all of the restaurants at Wynn and Encore have to have a Vegan/Vegetarian menu. I'm not Vegan/Vegetarian but I do enjoy that cuisine, so I asked to see this menu and I posted a picture of it.  I was torn on what else to order in addition to the French Toast. On the vegetarian menu there was an Eggs Benedict with a yellow tomato hollandaise sauce that really interested me. I'm not a fan of traditional hollandaise due to its heavy creaminess, but I also wanted real meat, not the fake sausage that came with the Veggie Benedict. So I asked our server if I could order the regular Eggs Benedict but substitute the yellow tomato hollandaise. She was happy to comply with my special request and my entree came out exactly how I wanted it.   Another special item was their house-made ketchup. It still had seeds from the tomatoes and it was lighter in texture and taste than bottled ketchup.  If you want a nice brunch in Vegas that avoids the gluttony of the buffets then give Tableau a try.",

Everything else we tried was solid but just a bit off the mark.  - Appetizer: The roasted beets were great but the balsamic drizzle was a little off-putting. - Entrees: Aside from the heavenly french toast, we also got their duck hash.  It was tasty but more like a pot pie.  Then again, duck hash is my favorite breakfast ever, so I'm especially picky about it. - Side: Their bacon's nothing special. - Drinks: The ShowStopper cocktails were refreshing but just a little too sweet.  All in all, Tableau's a great brunch spot with prompt, friendly service, and the portions don't make you feel like a glutton.  That seems to be hard to find in Vegas.",

The duck hash and eggs was SO good. I don't like runny eggs so I was thrilled to find a hash that was intended to be served with scrambled eggs. The duck was tender and well-seasoned and the puff pastry that the hash sat on was a pleasant surprise. We ordered the banana-sour cream pancakes for the table to share, which were also tasty but not as memorable as the duck hash. If you're in the mood for a boozy brunch, get the nirvana sour (vodka, elderflower liquer, strawberries and fresh squeezed grapefruit juice) - it wasn't overrun with sweetness or the taste of alcohol.",

The decor is like that of a high tea room with a little bit of edge, as can be seen by the artsy drawings of animals on the backs of the chairs which make the decor unique.   Service: very attentive staff. Great service.  Food: very mediocre overall. The first day I got the frittata which was ok but nothing amazing. A little bland. Second time there I got the vegetarian eggs Benedict which was DISGUSTING. A couple of soggy pieces of wheat bread topped off with watery scrambled tofu and veggie sausage that tasted like it was warmed up after frozen. I rarely send food back and i sent this back. I thought Wynn was known for his vegetarian/ vegan choices but this menu needs to be revamped. Boyfriend got the Tableau breakfast which was good. Pastry basket was excellent.  I would probably just come back for the pastries and maybe a juice, and avoid the breakfast choices until they are improved.",

This review was based on January 2015 and I read that there is a new chef taking over. I'm willing to give this restaurant another chance when I'm in Vegas.   I was so excited to try the ricotta lemon pancake which lead to disappointment because the pancake could be more fluffy and tasty. I felt like I was munching on endless stack of bread. My friend ordered the continental breakfast set which came with miniature pastries. It was really just okay for a $30 breakfast set.   Tableau is tucked in the 1st floor near the guest elevator and the lobby. It's quite hidden. I will return again for the fresh juices and hopefully the new chef will freshen up the menu and food.",

Arrived on time but still waited about 15 minutes to be seated despite the place not being full. We were seated and given menus but they didn't contain any berverages. We asked for a menu but it was just a standard beverage menu with no brunch options. We could see every table around us had mimosas and bloody mary's, and asked if they had a menu for that. The waiter said not really but we kind of pressed it and he asked if we wanted to menu for bottomless mimosas. Um, yes. But it was just a botomless mimosa menu and asked if they had bloody mary's as well (clearly...I could count 10 of them in my sight) and he said not on a menu but they couldn't probably make one. Such bizarre service. I ordered a latte (also not on any menus but I saw plenty of them). The bread options were actually the best part of the meal but again the waitress who brought them around had a hard time remembering what they were which was really strange. I had the eggs benedict which was decent but not anything special. Some of our group was unhappy with their meal, but my friend did enjoy the beef tenderloin benedict. They messed up our checks and we got items we didn't order as well as items within our table all mixed up. We even got checks for other tables. Even after we explained what we ordered and should be on each check, I still got an incorrect bill but paid it anyway because I didn't want to deal with the bad service anymore. We returned yet another check for some other table and left. 1* for ambiance, 1* for ok food.",

    "text": "So this was a great dining experience for some brunch and relaxation! The food was fine and quite fancy. So it's definitely a \"treat yo'self\" place!  Service: The service was great! They addressed us by our last names and were very welcoming. We had a great server, Armando, who made us laugh and really enhanced our dining experience. All the food came out in an adequate amount of time. Our server was attentive to our needs and checked in on us at the right time.   Food: The food was excellent! They had a separate vegetarian menu which was extremely inclusive and accommodating for my party. I ordered the Nautical Eggs Benedict, which was well prepared and refreshing. The hollandaise sauce was really great as well. I also ordered the crab cakes, and they would have to be the best crab cakes I've ever had. They also tasted fresh and not frozen. Furthermore, I order the juice flight. Although the juice flight was a small portion, I really enjoyed every taste. I felt super healthy and clean when I drank the juices. Another item I could not resist was the truffles fries. The truffle fries were okay, I've had better. Now, the thing that surprised me was the ketchup, hot sauce, and mayo. All those side condiments looked and tasted fresh and handmade/homemade. Lastly, I were served banana chocolate macaroons(?), and they were delicious!   Atmosphere: Great vibe! We were seated outside next to the pool and it was relaxing. We were under a nice umbrella. And there were misters but ours were broken. But overall, this place is \"bougee\".",

I wish they had vanilla yogurt but that's okay, it's still extremely good. The granola is homemade and we couldn't stop eating. The only reason I have 3 stars is because the avocado toast was so hard. You couldn't bite into the bread but you had to rip it apart. Besides that, it was good. I prefer terrace point cafe but it's worth a try.",

    "text": "A friend of ours recommended Tableau for a relaxing and delicious Memorial Day brunch during our long weekend in Las Vegas. The convenience of being downstairs from our room, along with the beautiful atmosphere and acclaimed food made it a no-brainer. We went down from our room and waited 10-15 minutes for a nice and shady table outside by the Wynn pool, which was a pleasant surprise on a holiday weekend when we expected long wait times.   Unfortunately, from the moment we were seated, the service was disappointing to say the least. After being seated for 10-15 minutes, we had still not been brought water, asked for our drink orders, or even been acknowledged by a member of the wait staff. A member of our group had to get up and find a waitress to come to our table and take our orders. We ordered various meals, juices, and smoothies. We requested that one burger have the bacon on the side, informing the waitress of religious restrictions that did not allow the member of our group to eat bacon.   From that point, it took another 10-15 minutes just to get our waters filled. Some simple juices and smoothies took over 30 minutes to come to the table. When the waiters brought our food to the table almost an hour after we had ordered, the burger had bacon inside of it despite our request. We told the waiter that we had ordered it with the bacon on the side, and he told us that the bacon was delicious and that it was the best part of the burger, and then left the table. We ended up eating around the bacon because we didn't want to wait another hour for another burger to be made.   The food itself is the only reason why, despite the disappointing service, Tableau still deserves a chance. The burger with its cheese sauce (at least as much as we could eat around the bacon) was absolutely delicious. The fork and knife sandwich (picture attached) with the addition of a fried egg was a delicious vegetarian option, with several different kinds of mushrooms and abalone. The white chocolate French toast and the waffles were also satisfying, but not extraordinary. Some brunch items were not listed on the menu, so be sure to ask what they have available when you go. Despite the extremely long wait, we were not dissatisfied with our meals. The chai smoothie was refreshing, but very banana heavy so I would only recommend ordering it if you can handle a strong banana taste.   After we finished eating, we were presented with another unpleasant surprise. When ordering, we had requested that the check be split into a couple different bills so that members of our group who were sharing items would be able to pay with ease. When the waitress took our order, she told us this would be no problem and she divided the orders into separate checks. However, when we received the bill (again, about 10-15 minutes after asking for it), everything was put onto one bill. When we asked the woman who brought our check, she informed us that our original waitress who took our orders was on break. We again had to wait a ridiculously long amount of time for them to split our bill, and once we provided our credit cards we again had to wait an inordinate amount of time to get our cards back. The entire process, from first getting seated at the table to getting our credit cards returned, took a total of 2 hours.   As someone who stays at the Wynn/Encore properties frequently, and who dines there and enjoys their nightlife and events with regularity, I have always been impressed by their commitment to quality and to service throughout the resort. I have never before experienced such disappointing service at the resort, and I would like to believe that this experience was an aberration. Maybe if you're seated inside, you can get better service, but in my opinion you shouldn't have to sacrifice service for atmosphere.",

I can't leave Vegas without  having Tableau breakfast at least once every trip!   It is so tastefully decorated, with perfect compliments of the curtains, furniture, servewear, floors, and tiny crystal vases of flowers on each table.    The food is always fresh and flavorful, and service is 5-star.  The only downside is the wait, so I highly recommend getting reservations beforehand. Another testament to how great this place is - there's a high demand!   The location of this restaurant is also great. It is located at the Wynn Tower Suites so it gives you the opportunity to see that side of the hotel if you have not seen it before. It also has a very beautiful Terrace seating area for a nice day out.   Already missing it!",

So when I was invited to my girlfriends Birthday Brunch today I took the opportunity !!   I tried the Duck Confit and Frisee Salad with Maui Onions that were reduced in red wine! I believe there was hazelnuts in it for added texture .   For some extra veggies I wanted to try to farro cooked with root vegetables which went very nicely with the salad.   Emily was our server and was very accommodating as was the bussers and runners.   The GM was kind enough to walk us out to the patio to take pictures of our group , which was a kind gesture with a group of our size.  The outside areas of Wynn are just as tasteful as the inside, and I was just in awe of how beautiful everything was.",

Hollandaise was tangy and thick and the breakfast ham was hearty but very soft. My friend went with the pancakes which were stacked high and loaded with fruit and flavor. Also serve a very spicy Moscow mule. Must go if you stay in Encore/Wynn!",

He said he would come again but get something else.   I also got an orange juice which was tiny and $7 but good juice.    I also think you need a reservation but I'm not sure (not because it's busy but because it's required).

THE BAD:  As soon as we walked in Larissa (the hostess) had an attitude. It wouldnt kill her to smile and greet guests! There were at least 10 empty tables but she made us sit and wait to get seated. She then escorted us to a table outside in the sun. When I asked if we can move to a shade she refused. We then asked if she can move the umbrella, she answered the umbrella can't be moved. Ok then at least move our table so we aren't getting roasted in 90 degree weather outside with the sun on our heads. Anyway she pulls out the chair and it's dirty, full of crumbs. I tell her umm the chair is dirty and she just stands there dumbfounded. I then had to take the napkin and clean the chair myself.   THE GOOD: Delicious breakfast food! I ordered the banana bread French toast, Spanish omelet, and the acai booster. Also got freah squeezed green juice which was very refreshing. Gabriel was an awesome server and did a great job!

    "text": "Road Trip Summer 2016  It's a gamble to take a toddler to an upscale restaurant. My daughter is usually well-behaved when we eat out, however, there's a 99.9999 % chance she'll be a maniac. One little thing could set her off and her ear-shattering screams will pierce the air. Then all this chaos will attract a great deal of unwanted attention. Most people will be thinking I'm the worst mother ever, and they'll hate me for bringing a child in a classy place. I'll try to keep cool to let my kid know she can't always get what she wants, but she'll show no signs of stopping. I have never let my kid use my iPad or phone to avoid negative behaviors, but it will be tempting to give in.   Ugh. The struggle is real.  I took a chance even though the whole experience was nerve-wracking. Our server took a while to get our order, she had a customer who was chatting up a storm. I know it's not her fault for the long wait, but I was nervous my daughter was going to break something or start getting fussy since I had to take some utensils away. Why do they have so many stuff on the freakin' table?!?! Fortunately, the little ramekins kept her busy. I was bummed I didn't get a stool for my purse/diaper bag like the others did, that would've probably kept her busy, too. Oh well, maybe purses from Target don't get a stool. Our friendly server was very apologetic about the wait, though, and we didn't wait long for the food.  At home, we often eat fruit for our first breakfast so I ordered a bowl of mixed berries. There was a variety of fresh blueberries, blackberries, raspberries, and strawberries. My daughter ate most of it, even the blackberries, which she never liked before. Since my little girl doesn't eat much, I just ordered the Pressed Duck and Waffles for us to share. That was the most interesting thing on their brunch menu, I've never had that before! I thought the duck was a little small but it was actually enough, my daughter didn't even want to try it. I love how the duck was perfectly tender and the sauce was tasty. The waffles were delicious, especially when I drowned it in the blackberry syrup. I also had the Orange Creamsicle Smoothie. I liked it but it had a little bitter taste, maybe that's why my toddler didn't want to have anymore after she tried it. More for me!   I also got a $9 bottle of Pellegrino, I had to do something crazy, I was in Vegas after all. I had to live it up! Then I remembered I don't even like sparkling water. My daughter does, but there was no way she was going to finish a whole liter! I wanted to take it back to our hotel, but they didn't have the cap. Our server offered to give me a bunch of plastic cups to pour the rest, but I didn't want to carry fifty cups without a fully closed cover. Oh well. It was really nice of our server to help me out, though. The long wait in the beginning was all forgiven.   And I was so relieved my daughter didn't have a hysterical meltdown!  Whew!   Total: $58.75",

If I'm ever committed to a crime, sentencing me to a carb-laden assault of waffles & pancakes would hopefully be consTrued as cruel an unusual punishment.   Of course, my girlfriend is the quintessential breakfast freak.  Spending a few days with her at the Wynn/Encore resulted in an obligatory breakfast trip.  I researched the Wynn's website in order to devise an escape route, and I found it.  It went through a frenchy-breakfasty place called Tableau.  The menu looked exotic but reasonably priced (especially by Vegas/Wynn standards).  Even better, it featured breakfast items that weren't some concoction of carbs and pig.  I immediately made a reservation for Sunday morning.  The place itself is beautiful.  It seriously feels like a setting for a tea party from a fairy tale (in a good way).  We split a tuna tartare appetizer, while I had the Duck Croque Madame and my girlfriend had the Pastrami and Eggs.    The tuna tartare was some of the best I've ever had, and the portions were more than generous.  The duck croque madame is certainly my new favorite breakfast food (and possibly favorite food of any kind).  The pastrami and eggs were good also, but overshadowed by my dish.  Throw in a couple coffees, and the bill still came to be less than a hundred bucks.  An absolutely astounding meal at a very reasonable price.  This was possibly the highlight of my entire time at the Wynn.",

The waiter gave us the lunch menu. We said that we were there for breakfast.  So he called the maitre d who came and apologized and said the breakfast was over at 11.30. So why did she make us stay another 20 minutes ? If the reservation is for 11 am then we are not there for lunch.  Right ?  There were four of of us sitting at a table during a 2 day trip to Vegas. They are not supposed to waste your time like that ! They should have made an exception given circumstances and ask the chef to make two more pancakes 10 minutes after the schedule ! Or they should have taken our orders at 11.18 when we arrived.   I guess I had too much expectations thinking that this was a french restaurant with some etiquette! No! It's just another low class touristy restaurant in Vegas with no class   Cher Guillaume!  Je suis bien decu. Il faut recycler Les maitres Sinon vous allez recevoir plus des messages comme ceci !

I had the Elk Sausage and Eggs, it was good, but I did not care for the elk sausage because it seemed a little dry for my liking.  I think this dish would have been awesome with regular sausage or bacon.  The potato hash and poached egg were very good.   My friend had the crab club sandwich, which he said was very good, although the fries which came with it were slightly salty and over seasoned.  The maine lobster was good, as was the kobe burger.   My favorite dish was the poached eggs and duck hash, it was presently beautifully on top of a pastry puff, and the flavors were delicious!      We ended with the signature souffle, which did not fail to disappoint!  Overall, the food was good, but I would have liked a little more variety for brunch.  I think Bouchon has a better brunch menu, prices at Tableau are slightly higher than Bouchon, and the portions are smaller here...but the signature souffle is excellent!  Non of the dishes which we tried were unsatisfying  or disappointing , but most of them did not stand out as great or exceptional... besides the Duck Hash and the Souffle.   I think I would come back only for a glass of fresh squeezed juice and a souffle, now that's the right way to start off your day in vegas!",

They brought us the most divine cake/bread to start which was such a treat. The juices was delicious, my favorite was the orange zest. Our omelettes were light, fluffy, and quite tasty. The potato they served was just ok, but didn't distract from the meal. All was yummy.   Now for the bad:  First of all, we had a reservation for 11am and we were not seated until 11:22. Once we were seated we were asked for our drink order and while our tea was brought, our water was never poured. When you want to be a 5* place, service counts.   Our waitress is really where the value was lost. She was insincere, rushed, and not accommodating. When we asked to have our eggs scrambles one minute after we ordered, she said it was too late, the order was in. Food didn't come for at least 10 minutes later. Then, I had subbed the potato  and toast for a salad. She neglected to mention the upcharge and when we asked her about it, she was rude and obstinate. The manager did handle it well, though.   Food was 5 star, service was not. Not sure if run back.",

I went most recently in the second week of May 2012 for breakfast. I remember coming here and getting awesome, elaborate breakfast items that were meticulously prepared and completely delicious. Now you get pedestrian choices that are pretty \"meh.\"   I told the server that I had had a crab benedict there that I really enjoyed, he asked the chef if he could accommodate and the chef agreed. I got my crab benedict. It was a very boring and normal-looking eggs benedict but it had some wet crab meat slopped on it. Blah.  Service is amazing as always, everyone knows your name right away, and fresh squeezed orange juice is delicious of course. But the food, repeatedly, has been very meh. Las Vegas is not a city to be a \"meh\" restaurant in. On top of that, Tableau is retardedly expensive - two orange juices, a crab benedict and a regular benedict, tax and tip - $80.  I notice that for guests of the Tower Suites at the Wynn, all the food at Tableau is free.  I don't know how long they have been doing that, maybe it has contributed to a decline in quality as hitting food costs may no longer be relevant. I also understand that a new chef recently took over, which makes me even more sad, because at the beginning of a new chef's tenure he should be producing outstanding food to build a reputation. This is not really happening. Guests around us slogged through their overpriced breakfasts with blank, apathetic expressions.   Tableau closed, then changed names, reopened, then changed names again, then got a new leader. Not surprising the food got left behind. Two stars for overpriced meh breakfast.",

Combining a sunny ambience, whitewashed gold-tone decor, a well-trained staff, and a breakfast that seems out of place in Las Vegas, Tableau manages to stun repeatedly. I could truly dine here for breakfast for a week, eating little other than the white-chocolate french toast with a peach smoothie and never tire of it. The juice flight, while powerful, stands on its own, and our request to be seated in the atrium every time was met with a \"yes sir\" with little to no wait. It is equally impressive that even at a breakfast spot they provide \"purse chairs,\" lest your mini flap be forced to sit upon the floor, which is equal in cleanliness to the dishware.   Attention is paid here to everything, whether it be the creases (lack thereof) of the tablecloths, the crumbs that accumulate during your meal (which are swept away as you eat), and the greeting and goodbye, which are genuine and representative of the Wynn philosophy \"people make people happy.\" They sure do!",

I have heard that Steve Wynn was vegan for a period, and makes sure there is vegan options available in his restaurants.  I saw on their website that Wynn and Encore have teamed with vegan chef Tal Ronnen to offer unique and healthy alternatives any time of the day.  This made it an easy choice to come here.  I thoroughly enjoyed my Orecchiette with wild mushrooms, asparagus and fresh tomatoes!  My friend had the salmon burger with French fries and house made ketchup.  He raved about the ketchup, and so I tried it out with a French f.ry.  The ketchup was so good, I almost wished I had something to put the ketchup on!  The service was impeccable, the atmosphere was charming with cozy comfortable chairs. They even had these cute little purse stools, for your purse!  I'm planning on another trip to Vegas in October, definitely planning on returning then!",

Unfortunately we were not able to sit outside since its 47 degrees outside and they are doing some work on the pool area which their patio is facing but nevertheless it a great place for brunch. Vegan pancakes were delicious and orange zest fresh squeezed juice was a nice addition. Good cappuccinos, purity juice was excellent too and acai booster was a True booster. I guess we are on the health track... for a few hours... until the next amazing restaurant in Las Vegas !",

Not oily or too heavy but still had lots of flavor. Their one time use tea diffusers are so cute and fancy looking. The waiters also give you little stool for your purse. Your purse! Lol they look like little sofas by your foot and you set your purse on top of it.

I made a quick reservation over the phone for a half hour later and arrived to be seated in their conservatory, which was the perfect place to sit because you're not outside but in a nice and sunny cozy area that has a view of the tables outside and pool area. A and I split the breakfast sandwich and strawberry blintz pancakes that our waiter recommended and they were so nice to plate half portions of each for us. The food wasn't amazing but both dishes were good and there wasn't anything to complain about. They even gave the cutest little chair for my purse since it slid off the back of my chair. :) We had a very nice and relaxing breakfast there and would recommended it for anyone looking for a nice breakfast in a very pretty setting.",

    "text": "\"Proper\" is the word that comes to mind when I think of Tableau. It doesn't hold a negative connotation, but the space definitely is reminiscent of an English tea party. Servers were prompt and attentive and very, very proper, and the setup of the sunlit room was classy and elegant.   Trio of fresh juices: Red Deliciousness, Purify, Orange Zest: (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=zdiMak6UuWRV5AlvsB8_7A&userid=1ug7EtH4blOzzbqqkmkenA\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>) I was unfortunately allergic to one or more of the fruit mixes in these juices, but the other members of my party verified that these juices were definitely freshly-pressed. They also mentioned that these are healthy and do taste it, so if that's not your cup of tea, maybe go for.. actual tea..   Cream of cauliflower soup: (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=FdKXwBSOKe2aBqpIBQvKKQ&userid=1ug7EtH4blOzzbqqkmkenA\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>) Per proper preparation, this soup was served via pouring at the table. It was thick, gloopy, and luke. warm. I had one sip and was so disappointed in the lukewarm temperature that it immediately became a miss in my book. I did appreciate the bits of toasted cauliflower and creaminess of the soup, but any soup that is lukewarm is a lost cause for me.  Chicken noodle soup: (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=nC5Jo6HDz4I6RpLxP2jkrw&userid=1ug7EtH4blOzzbqqkmkenA\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>) The temperature of this soup was slightly warmer than that of the cream of cauliflower, but it was still far from hot. The noodles were slightly overboiled, and the broth was too salty for my taste.   Duck hash and eggs: (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=StJ8amQAT9SBTS11CtBhMQ&userid=1ug7EtH4blOzzbqqkmkenA\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>) The puff pastry on the bottom was rolled beautifully; it was flaky and melt-in-your-mouth despite being a little oily (as puff pastries can be expected to be). The duck hash was seasoned well, although I didn't get too much of a duck taste, and the egg balanced out the slight saltiness of the hash. I also enjoyed the roasted fingerling potatoes, as they added a cozy mealiness to the dish.   White chocolate orange french toast: (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=mbPZyByuEpY0N7WRm4v9RA&userid=1ug7EtH4blOzzbqqkmkenA\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>) I love french toast, and I always itch to try it whenever I see it on any menu. After reading the rave reviews about the white chocolate orange french toast here, I was practically salivating even ordering it. When it was served, the presentation was beautiful and I was expecting it to taste as wonderful as it looked.. but it fell really short of expectation. The two pieces of bread were incredibly dry, and despite the beautiful browning of egg on each side, there was no egginess. I did get the orange flavor, but none of the white chocolate (and I prefer white chocolate to orange). Even plentiful syrup could not offset the dryness of the toast, and this dish was a crestfallen disappointment to me. It's possible it was just a fluke, but then it'd be a huge fluke.  Filet Oscar benedict with beef tenderloin, poached eggs, blue crab, and housemade sourdough muffin: (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=b4ZzfgTgNOQOMfyKJ9zabQ&userid=1ug7EtH4blOzzbqqkmkenA\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>) I thought the pairing of beef tenderloin and blue crab was interesting, and it worked to a degree. The blue crab meat was slightly cold, as if it had just come out of the refrigerator, but the beef tenderloin was cooked a nice medium rare. The poached eggs had model runny centers, although the hollandaise sauce was a bit too watery for me. There was a lot going on with this one dish, and it's definitely something to dig into when ravenous rather than as an ending entree.   I have mixed feelings about Tableau, but I'd be open to coming back for a second brunch visit.",

Having said that, while their food was tasty, it is definitely not worth the price! They offer a good variety of natural juices, so my mom and I tried the Orange Zest and Red Deliciousness - both of which were very tasty. We also ordered Nautica Benedict, Smoked Salmon and Brown Butter Apple Pancakes. Everything was yummy except for the pancakes - they weren't bad, but they were a little bit more on the dry side. Our total was about $100 - if that's not crazy, then there must be something wrong with me. I understand it's Vegas and like I said, the food was indeed good but it's way overpriced!  Gave 3 stars for the value!",

Elegant dining with excellent, unpretentious service - what else do you expect from a Wynn establishment?  Four choices of bread to start off, then I had the Duck Ravioli while the wife had the Blue Crab Sandwich.  Both were excellent.  She also had the Blue Crab Soup which was brought out with chunks of blue crab and separate container of the soup which was poured into the bowl at the table.  Soup was so good that you want to lick the bowl.  Of course you can't but use the bread to sop up the rest.  No room for dessert and they surprised us with a chocolate baked item before we left.  The waiter also brought me an iced tea to go.  What service!",

    "text": "To determine how long it has been since I have enjoyed Tableau, the meal I was here for was dinner. Regretting the length of time that has spanned since this last visit, I notice they now only serve breakfast/lunch/brunch.  The hosts had made reservations here and even though this was not my original choice, I was looking forward to Tableau, as this was my first dining experience at The Wynn. At the time, this was one of the most elegant properties on the strip (and to this day, still is). I certainly felt somewhat out of place, but the service and company was exceptional, and didn't make me feel like the serf* that I normally am.   A stunning dining room greets you as you walk in; the lighting was dim but not so much where you can't see the menu, the decor appeared to be in warm creams, with lively bursts of color on the seating throughout. We had a table inside, but the outside had a lovely view overlooking the pool.   This was my first time trying beef carpaccio; as this was one of those 'try anything' dining excursions I'll probably never have again, and I don't think I'll find a similar dish in quality anywhere else. Forgive me for forgetting the remainder of what I had that night, but this appetizer still stands out today.   I wondered what those adorable miniature 'chairs' were next to our own, and while the male host said it was a place where one could rest their legs after a long meal, the other host-a female-explained to me it's where a lady puts her purse. My clutch looked minute settled onto this, but it served its job well.  Based on the little I recall from dinner so long ago, I imagine Tableau really knows how to do an amazing brunch. Even with all the newer, high-caliber, celebrity-endorsed establishments that have popped up on the strip, I plan on making this a stop when I come back to town.  *I most likely returned to this state once I exited the doors of The Wynn.",

Here is what we ordered: Braised Short Rib Burger w/ an upgrade of truffle fries - damn this was good. I ordered it medium, and the patty was juicy and thick just how it should be. It was supposed to come with thick cut fries, but I gotta have my truffle so I upgraded it to a side of truffle fries. I'm glad i did! The fries were so good! So crispy on the outside + it came with some sort of lemony aoli lol   Braised Short Rib - we love our red meat  this was delicious! The Rib was SOOOO tender. It just melts in your mouth.   To top off the great entrees, they serve complimentary bread. We chose the honey cornbread and oh my god, I had to have seconds. The outside had a honey crisp and it was warm and soft in the middle. Put some butter on that b*%%! and BAM.  My only slight complaint would be that I wish our main waiter was more... smiley? Lol he sort of looked like he was over it. Other than that, everything was great. Can't wait to come back!  For the vegetarians, they offer a vegetarian menu! + they have cocktails",

AMBIANCE: This restaurant feels like it's designed for the upper class. I felt like I should have been wearing a summer dress and sipping on English tea. I liked the design of the restaurant, with the large windows for a view of the outside.  SERVICE: The service was great and they were so accommodating! They had a vegetarian/vegan menu for my boyfriend. After he ordered the vegetarian eggs Benedict, our waitress mentioned that the English muffin had eggs in it and asked if he'd like to substitute something else for it. I know it's typical for restaurants to ask that, but I think most would forget those little things. I was very impressed at how accommodating they were.  FOOD: The duck hash was amazing! The pastry layer on the bottom was so yummy and everything just complemented so well. The roasted tomato hollandaise made everything so delicious, and there was actually a lot of duck. It was also the perfect portion for me. I am definitely coming back for it.  I also tried my boyfriend's vegetarian eggs Benedict and was impressed as well! The veggie patty was really good, along with the scrambled tofu and hollandaise.  The portions are on the smaller side, so you might want to order sides. Regardless, the duck hash is a MUST TRY!",

Note that if you book the \"Tower Suite Experience\" for a stay at the Wynn, you will receive a complimentary breakfast here. The menu items include things like apple pancakes and yogurt parfaits, acai bowls, and chorizo omelettes.   My kids had a yogurt parfait and plain pancakes. Plain pancakes were not on the menu, but they made them for us. They looks fantastic. With them came fresh whipped butter and syrup - no butter out of a plastic container. My husband and I had a veggie frittata which was healthy and fresh, and included veggies and feta cheese, with Parmesan and greens. We had some toast with it, and the toast came with fresh whipped butter and jams that did not look like they came out of a jar or a plastic package either. Yummy!  They also have fresh juices and cappuccinos, lattes, etc.  The ambiance here is very nice, classy and elegant, but not so much that you feel like you have to be dressed up -- it is right next to the pool (I'm sure you have to wear clothes though!).   I would go here over some of the other options in Vegas, especially if you prefer good food with some class.",

Started off great with the breathtaking atmosphere, iced coffee, and the complimentary pastries which were delicious, and went downhill very quickly.   I ordered the eggs Benedict, with turkey bacon instead of real bacon. My order was brought out incorrectly the 1st time; they brought me some vegan dish with fake eggs and meat. Gross. They brought it back and then brought out the dish I actually ordered, and they forgot the sauce on the side. Waited for that to be brought out. Then I went to bite into my eggs, which were wayyyyy undercooked. It was literally jiggling all over-it looked like it was alive. Even more gross. I order eggs Benedict all of the time and have never seen eggs come out this undercooked. I advised the waitress and she was very apologetic and wanted to bring me something else. She said that's how the chef prepares the eggs, and that they could cook them through more for me. At this point, I was overly hungry and frustrated, so I chose to cancel my order and pick off of my husband's plate instead. His meal was also unenjoyable: he had the hash, which was basically like eating pure salt. He didn't like it either. Total bummer.  I would not visit here again for anything but a drink.",

    "text": "Tableau is located in the Wynn Hotel and Casino. Most people don't even realize it is there because it isn't visable from the casino floor. It is located in the Wynn tower suite section of the hotel.   The restaurant serves breakfast (7:00 am - 11:30 am) & lunch (11:30 am - 2:30 pm) only. You can dine indoors or poolside/outdoor terrace if you choose.   As for the food, top quality and well prepared. They also have a vegan menu. When I went, I had the blueberry pancakes, and a glass of orange juice. The pancakes were the best I ever had, and the OJ was the freshest and sweetest I have had in a long time.   The place does get crowded, so if you don't want to wait around, make a reservation. The cost, it is located at the Wynn so expect to pay $$$. Because it is usually packed, the time between placing your order and the time the food arrives, can take up to 20+ minutes. So if you are in a hurry or extremely hungry, you might want to look elsewhere.   But if you are looking for an upscale breakfast place look no further.",

Eggs, duck, pastry, sauce -everything about it was just right. A must have!  We also ordered the White Chocolate & Orange French Toast - wow again!! Probably the best French toast we've ever had. So yum. Perfectly sweetened. I like lighter tastes, hubby prefers a sweeter taste and both of us could not stop licking our forks. :)  Food was excellent and worth the splurge. French toast was about $20 for 2 large slices. Our total was about $70, including tax and tip. Both dishes were so good that we decided to come back the next morning. Our total on day 2 was about $100, including tax and tip. Make reservations for faster service and request atrium seating - such pretty views and decor!  The next morning, we ordered the same 2 dishes but also added the elk sausage since it was so different than what we've had. It was smokier, muskier. Hubby loved it but I prefer the duck.  The apple pomegranate juice was very good too - a bit sweet but very fresh and smooth. Coffee was so-so, a bit watered down but I compare all coffee to my favorite (rising sun at Alan Wong's).   We will definitely be back, again and again whether our pocketbook likes it or not!",

    "text": "My gf has been wanting to try Tableau since her last visit to Vegas and this time around she said she'll treat my parents and me to brunch there.  My entire experience was very good except for a couple of minor blimps.  When I called in to make the reservation the lady's tone of voice, personality, friendliness is what epitomizes Wynn.  I have never stayed at their hotel but that experience there tells me why they won the five diamond award.  The reservationist was polite, friendly, and just made sure to cover points that I would never have even thought of and best of all she got me excited about dining there.  Upon arriving (we arrived right on time) our table wasn't ready and we waited for 20 minutes.  Even though they apologized a few times when we were seated I would have appreciated if they told us at the ten minute mark why the table wasn't ready or at least update us.  The only things we were told were\"just a moment\" and \"we are working on it.\"    For brunch we ordered the scrambled eggs with duck and puff pastry, eggs with elk, a traditional breakfast with eggs, toasts, bacon, a pastry/muffin basket, and a tofu napoleon.  I can't comment on the tofu but my mom liked it a lot.  The traditional breakfast's muffin basket was delicious.  It came with strawberry jam, what seems to be orange zest, and something similar to devonshire cream.  The elk and the eggs were disappointing.  The elk was just a piece of meat patty that wasn't very good.  The scrambled eggs on both dishes (elk and duck) were a bit runny for my taste.  The duck and egg was decent but as I said it would have been better if the scrambled eggs weren't as runny.  Service is excellent.  They have notes ready for the waiters so they address you as Mr. or Ms. or Mrs. so and so.  The ambiance in the restaurant is terrific.  On a sunny day it's like sitting inside a open window conservatory with the garden and pool right outside.  While the views can be nice, it can also be negated by out of shape men wearing their swim trunks walking around and talking on the phone.  This is a place you should try and I'll most definitely come back again.",

We thought about heading across the street, to find something at the Fashion Show Mall, but didn't want to waste precious pool time.   We didn't have a reservation, but were seated within 20 minutes.  It was a beautiful day and we had a table right by one of the open windows looking out on the pool. The hostess placed a tiny stool next to my chair for my purse to sit on. This was neat and strange at the same time, but nonetheless a nice touch.   Our waiter was a bit of an odd character, just in a general sort of way. He wasn't too attentive either. I had an omelette with fontina, mushrooms and caramelized onions. There was too much cheese and onions for my liking. The potato cakes that came with it were delicious though. The toast, even though I requested it sans butter, was still enjoyable. My husband had the elk sausage and poached eggs and seemed to enjoy it.   We might go back if ever in the same situation, but there are too many other great places to try in LV for this place to make the rotation.",

We were seated outside, surrounded by the pool and gardens at Wynn, listening to the birds chirp and the smell of fresh air. Having spent a couple of days on The Strip by this point, it felt like we had been transported to a different place entirely! Welcome to classy Vegas.  The sour sream and banana pancakes were excellent - the best pancakes I have ever had! Each bite literally melted in my mouth. It is a large order so you might want to get it to share. The house made granola with greek yogurt and fruits was also fantastic. Some of the freshiest berries I have ever had. And to think that we were in the middle of the dessert! The Valencia Mimosas are top notch. I followed it with a regular Mimosa to compare and there was definitely a major difference! The Valencia Mimosa is so fresh - you can't get it in too many places!  I can't wait to return to Vegas just to eat here!!!",

While it has a dressier atmosphere, it didn't require you to dress up necessarily, just wear some non-raggedy half decent clothes.  It's located in the hotel area after you walk through the entire casino if you park in self parking.  The hostess and server were pleasant so it set up for a relaxed lunch.  I got the: - Pan seared fish (for the life of me I can't remember the name of the fish, but it was a smaller white fish)  while others got: - Napoleon of savory tofu, dressed with a mirepoix-like spicy ratatouille and fried eggplant - Kobe burger - Roasted chicken  The fish was well prepared with the outside a light crispness and the fish moist and soft.  Not overly sauced or seasoned.  The fish flavor was the main event just how I like it.  I was also able to taste the vegan Napolean which had a light but nice flavor with the combination of the tofu and more flavorful eggplant. Although I'm no vegetarian by any means, I love eggplant and better quality tofu so this may be an entree I choose next time if I'm feeling like something light and healthy.  The server told us this was what Steve Wynn gets every time he comes.  The Kobe burger was just another disappointing Kobe burger.  I have never liked any of the Kobe burgers I've ever had as they are more expensive and very average tasting.  American Kobe beef just isn't that good.  I've had a 100x better burger for $4 in Carbondale, CO at Fatbelly Burger where they serve natural grass fed beef burgers and of course in Japan where some places actually use real wagyu (Japanese beef).  That'll run you about the same price or more though as an American Kobe burger.  This is a place where you can kind of escape the lights and noises of Vegas to have a pleasant meal in a pleasant atmosphere.  I'll keep this one in my pocket as an option for lunch and maybe breakfast/brunch as that looks good too.  4 stars all around for ambience, service and food.",

If you have to use the pisser, you'll understand how serious they take that label.  Anyways, I was hesitant a bit. I don't like to splurge too much for breakfast, maybe Bottega Louie, meh. Menu was limited but I said hey let's do it. Pretty good decision.  Our table ordered the eggs benedict, which delivered. The complimentary bread was clutch. 1v1 cannot be defeated by any complimentary bread, it just can't.  I ordered the waffles with that foie gras. At a +10 charge, I was worried about the quality of it, and well it wasn't the best, but for early brunch it was decent. The waffles blew me away, the batter was Aaron Judge clutch. The applewood bacon was applewood bacon, no rip offs here.  Service was cool. The opener did great, the actual server was alright but still left that 20% because of the first homie. Promote him!   Tableau is really good, any bad review might have come off ordering the wrong thing, or taking the cold waffles personal.",

Coffee is very good and I decided to start with a smoothie to potentially cleanse my body from the night before, Orange zest, pears, nectar, carrots and ginger. It was healthy tasting without a doubt. The menu is a little more limited than some breakfast places in Vegas but still the basics are there. I had the Tableau breakfast, three eggs, potatoes, bacon and it came with a pastry basket (which was nice) plenty of food and coffee was included. Everyone could share the pastry basket since it is too much for one person. A friend at the table had the omelette which was presented very tastefully. My breakfast well I was a little taken back at first it looked like a basic breakfast you could get....well anywhere that I didn't have to pay $30 dollars for. At the end of the day it tasted fantastic, eggs were perfect, potato excellent and the bacon flavorful. I guess you shouldn't judge a breakfast by its cover.",

I honestly felt like I was being catered to, almost like a queen.   When I went I had the Western Frittata which is just a fried egg with pepper, spices and tomato. It was absolutely delicious and flavorful. I complimented it with the Orange Zest and a cute fruit platter -- which was delightful. Then the kitchen gave us some juice that was for free, that was tasty too. I went into this restaurant a little disappointed but came out high on life. This place is so good and I want to come back as soon as possible!",

From first glance sure it's presented nicely but our oatmeal came out cold, egg whites were the smallest portion I've ever seen & took forever so my guest ended up filling up on dry bread... the sausage was room temp, super dry & shriveled up lol. Better sausage @ the buffet & they are kept hot. Pancakes were room temp. The coffee was super strong & hot which was the best part of the meal. The fruit plate came out room temperature too... why? It was pre cut which is fine but fruit should be served cold lol... The various temperatures of the food had me baffled. Everything was room temp or cold. The restaurant is beautiful but our food just didn't meet even average expectations.",

Great, considering it was mildly busy and there was a conference with 40,000 attendees a lot of whom were staying at this property. We called morning of to secure the reservation as OpenTable showed no available times. They asked if we had a special request upfront and we wanted a nice table. They sat us by the French windows at a roundtable for 5 overlooking their outdoor patio dining space. Loved all the space for all of our food.   We both had the three eggs breakfast that included a basket of bread (blueberry muffins, croissant, and some other kinds of breads), grapefruit juice, and/or coffee or tea. They also gave us complimentary almond bites, which were good. We were asked at reservations and at the table if we had food restrictions. No. But appreciated being asked. If you're looking for a good breakfast in a charming space with great service that really tries to accommodate your little asks such as table by windows, gluten free, less salt, etc, call Tableau!!",

We didn't even ask for that or make a deal of it.  The server did it on his own.  Beautiful ambiance as well....they make you feel like royalty.   Well played Steve Wynn...well played....",

It was seared perfectly and the proportion was pretty generous. The texture was silky and buttery. Mmmm, that was the best I've had in years!  The only drawback was the food took forever to come out.",

Assorted pastries was average with the notable one being the banana Nutella one. Skip the drinks.. the smoothie w/ balsamic vinegar was odd, the cranberry smoothie (w/ purple potato, banana, & yogurt) tasted good but the consistency was really starchy - a very filling type of drink, the flight of fruit juices was so-so. Shrimp sandwich was decent. Soft shell crab sandwich was really good; crab is fried but not greasy, almost tasted like a \"healthy\" sandwich.",

    "text": "Finally got to check this place out during Sunday brunch and I have to say, we were rather underwhelmed in contrary to other people's experiences.  Came in after a long night of debauchery and was immediately accommodated even without a reservation.  I, however, highly recommend making one since there were already plenty of people waiting only an hour after opening.  Being situated inside the Wynn, this isn't your typical run of the mill breakfast joint.  The restaurant itself was nicely decorated with elaborate features throughout.  If available, request for the conservatory which boasts great lighting and awesome views of the outdoor pool.  They also have patio seats that's ideal for good weather conditions.  One aspect I particularly didn't like was how the crowd was too hoity-toity which somewhat ruined the ambiance.  Superb customer service though with remarkable attention to details such as offering small chairs for purses which we found quite hilarious.  Instead of ordering something off the menu that I can't easily get elsewhere, the inebriated part of me opted for the Tableau breakfast.  Indeed, that's as basic as anyone can get but it does come with complimentary beverage and pastry basket.  Overall, Tableau is one of the better choices for breakfast around the Strip.  Yet, nothing really stood out of this place that makes me want to rate this place anything higher than three stars.  Perhaps we'll give it another try and definitely will be laying off the booze before heading here next time!",

    "text": "OVERALL PROS: - Beautiful, gorgeous spot overlooking some of the pools at the Wynn. - Our server was prompt, friendly, and great. - Absolutely wonderful food. The free bread was incredible. - MUST-HAVES: French toast, Milk & cookies souffle.  OVERALL CONS: - A little overpriced. Actually let me rephrase. Very overpriced. But.. it was worth going one time to experience the great food.  Here's what we got:  * Free bread - OMG so delicious! Fresh out of the oven, and they come in these little baking pans. Incredibly soft & just breaks apart so easily so you can slather it with butter. A slight hint of sweetness to it too.. yum.  * Fresh squeezed apple & pomegranate juice - Tasted very good, very fresh, like a great cider. I couldn't taste much of the pomegranate (maybe that was the slight tartness) but that's probably a good thing as too much pomegranate could easily be overkill.  * Organic Pear Mixed Salad (pears, blue cheese, walnuts, mixed greens) - Good balance of ingredients, the blue cheese was nice and strong. The dressing was light and tart and there was exactly enough for the salad. But there were just a few pieces of pears (and they looked canned) and overall this just didn't wow me.  * Eggs Benedict (poached eggs, nueske canadian bacon, bearnaise sauce) - Perfectly cooked eggs w/ drippy yolk, great sauce. The english muffin was perfection, with that slight crunch, yet soft & warm. The bacon was a little tough to cut through though (and messed me up as I was trying to cut through the thing - I got egg yolk everywhere). Overall good, but unfortunately not worth $21.  * White Chocolate & Orange French Toast (organic orange blossom honey butter, pure maple syrup) - This was absolutely amazing! There was that slight orange flavor (though I didn't personally catch any of the white chocolate), perfect crisp on the outside, soft on the inside. Love the fruits you get on the side too - raspberries, blackberries, oranges, strawberries, blueberries. Just the perfect amount til the very last bite.  * Milk and Cookies Souffle (chocolate chip cookie souffle served with vanilla ice cream and chocolate sauce) - THIS MUST BE THE BEST DESSERT I'VE EVER HAD. Warning: it takes a while to come out, but that's because they bake it when you order and you get it FRESH out of the oven. Our waiter poked a hole in the souffle and poured in the melted dark chocolate (don't worry, there was some left over). I took a bite and was just in Heaven. It is was incredibly soft and moist and gooey. I can't believe I ate the whole thing but I did! The ice cream provided a good temperature contrast, but it was kind of low quality ice cream, not very rich or creamy.",

    "text": "Tableau had me at KOBE BURGER...  I'm not much of a breakfast/brunch person b/c I can't handle anything heavy in the morning. However, my friend was enticed by their signature \"Milk and Cookies Souffle\" and wanted to dine there.   After looking through the online menu myself, I was sold on the Kobe burger. What carnivore can ever turn down a good burger? Certainly NOT me...so we decided to come to Tableau for a late brunch during our Vegas trip.  Tableau is inconspicuously located in the Tower Suites of The Wynn where you have to walk through the casino and pass the High Roller area before you see a sign for it. If you're not familiar w/ the layout of the casino, it can be confusing, so make sure to ask one of the employees lingering in the area for directions.   My friend and I promptly arrived for our 1 PM reservations on Saturday, 7.31.10 and were seated at a table overlooking the pool area.   FOOD/DRINKS: *Fresh Watermelon Juice ($6): Refreshingly light and sweet.    *Kobe Burger w/ Old Bay Fries ($16): OMG--SO GOOD! The thick Kobe patty was perfectly grilled to a medium w/ a soft pink center topped w/ an ooey goeey melted aged cheddar, nestled against fresh ripen beef steak tomato slices, butter lettuce, pickles, crisp red onions and then sandwiched between a toasted homemade sesame bun.   As I bit into the burger, I got a slight crisp from the toasted bun and veggies before my teeth sunk into the tender patty, which was so moist, that juices started to dribble down the bread and onto my plate. Since the bread was toasted on both sides, it held everything together in place just fine. The burger had the perfect combo of crispiness from the bread and lettuce, tender savoryness from the kobe, saltiness from the cheddar, and a slight tang from the pickles.  The fries were perfectly crisp and the old bay seasoning added a kick from red and black peppers, cloves, and all spice. The homemade ketchup was the perfect accompaniment; you can really taste the fresh tangy sweetness from the vine ripen tomatoes which added a zing to the burger and fries.   *Milk & Cookies Souffle ($10): It was ok and was nothing to write home about. I prefer my souffle light and fluffy, and Tableu's souffle was on little on the heavy and dry side. The vanilla ice cream was rich and smooth, and the chocolate sauce was thick and decadent. It was a great contrast of temperatures and textures, but again, I wasn't keen on the souffle's dryness.   SERVICE: Our server was pretentious and not friendly. He never cracked a smile the entire a time and was pretty much gone after he took our order. He was only there to give us our dessert and our bill (after having to ask a busboy). I had to ask for my water to be refilled, which is pretty much a no-no at a more upscale dining establishment.  AMBIANCE/DECOR: Classy; crisp white linen tables, a gold chandelier, and tan curtains draped against large windows overseeing the pool area. Tables are well spaced out to allow for a more intimate dining w/ your party and for ease of conversation.   If you're looking for a nice, serene place for breakfast/brunch after a night of heavy drinking and debauchery, Tableau is the perfect place...",

I mentioned our engagement to the waitress and they ended off our brunch with a surprise chocolate covered strawberry dessert :)",

    "text": "As you all know, I rarely give any establishments a 1 or 2.  My experience at Tableau was so unacceptable especially for such a fine hotel.    Our first interaction with this particular staff \"Marie\" was one of the worse experiences I've ever had in a restaurant.  I walked in with my girlfriend on a beautiful Saturday cheery and happy ready to enjoy my vacation.  After we checked in with the sweet hostess, she told us we had a 25 min wait which we were ok with.  I asked her where we can grab quick coffee before we get seated and she directed us to the bar.  We walked over to the bar and attempted to sit down.  Before our butt was was on the chair Marie came by with a very awful attitude.  \"Are you just having coffee?\"  \"Yes, may we?\" I replied.  She rolled her eyes at my friend and I and say \"sure, I guess,\" with great hesitation.  So I stood up and said \"it's ok, if you don't want us here, we will leave.\"  We walked out.  Horrible right?  You don't like you job, quit!  You don't want to be nice, quit!  It's not my responsibility for your misery!!!  I waited for twenty mins until our table was up at which point I talked to the lady manager and explained the situation.  She seemed nice about it and assured me that she will talk to Marie.  We proceeded with our meal.  The saving grace for the restaurant was in fact the rest of our experience was positive.  The wait staff was attentive and the manager came by personally with a fruit platter.  I will not rate the individual dishes today but check out the pictures.  Overall good was more closer to a 4.    Wishing you all a great Saturday and not a poor experience like mine.  Bon appetit.  Until next time, ciao!",

The pastry basket was delicious and did not need any of the yummy jams or butters. Chicken sausage was also delicious.  Too bad we were so full from all the food or else we would have gotten the souffle.    Will definitely come back for brunch here the next time I'm in town.

My family enjoyed a delightful brunch here, and I really can't recommend it enough.  The menu was varied and wide ranging, truly a comprehensive list that everyone could enjoy.  The wine/champagne was not as reasonably priced as I would like, but given the price and quality of the food... there are absolutely no complaints here.  The blueberry ricotta pancakes, and smoke salmon dishes were quite good.  The NY steak sandwich was so so.    If you must entertain a large party, this really is the place to do it.  All your guests will feel like they just had a lavish brunch; however, your wallet will thank you (surprising given its location in the Wynn).  For all the praise, one might wonder, \"Why only four stars then?\"  Well, I dunno how to say this... purse stands.  There are friggin' stands for your purses!  A little stand the waiter brings over, so your purse can rest upon it.  The seating was divine (the round room looking at the pool area), the table setting was beautiful, the shades and decorations pleasant to all, but lo and behold to truly capture the \"elegance\", purse stands are provided.",

We have sampled most of the restaurants within the Wynn/Encore resort and this one is certainly near the top of the list. Much better than Alex ever was...  Onto the food:  Coffee: Not bad, but nothing special either. My cup was always full and there was plenty of cream & sugar for my wife's coffee. Basically, they didn't screw-the-pooch on this one like so many Vegas establishments do.  French toast:  perfect portion size, nice subtle orange flavor, crispy on the outside but soft on the inside. Excellent and highly recommended.  Poached eggs and elk sausage:  we have never had poached eggs actually shaped like eggs - very cool. The sausage is full of spices and isn't dominated by a 'gamey' elk flavor.   Bacon: I'm a snob when it comes to Vitamin P and Tableau didn't disappoint. Perfectly prepared and good flavor. Again, not the best I've ever had but definitely at a high level.",

It also encouraged me to return for dinner the following night, which was one of the best meals I have ever enjoyed. I had the dungeness crab ravioli with lemon emulsion - sense a theme here? It was a perfectly balanced dish - the creaminess was tempered by the citrus and was by far the best dish we had that night. My second was a duck breast wrapped in bacon. And anyone who knows me will tell you that if you wrap something in bacon I will eat it and be thrilled. So don't follow the Vegas hype to the trendier restaurants. At Tableau the decor is beautiful (my purse enjoyed its own private divan), and the service was spectacular and un-fussy. Tableau feels like an extension of someone's home, only with much better food.",

    "text": "Tableau offers American cuisine by chef Mark LoRusso. I've had dinner here once, lunch once, and breakfast four times.  The dinner menu offers a wide choice of New American cooking. I'd call it fancy but not flashy. Breakfast and lunch are much simpler, but with a few fancy touches.  The room is quiet and formal. Tables are widely spaced, with long white table cloths and a single orchid in a bud vase, and sprays of Phalaenopsis orchids decorate the room. Soft music plays in the background. Service is efficient and attentive. In general, service has been friendly and efficient. Sadly, my lunch at Tableau was an exception. When it was time for the check, my server disappeared. I waited and waited and waited, even looking for someone else to help, but with no success. I finally felt it necessary to go to the hostess, and ask what had happened. My server never returned; someone else brought the check.  ** DINNER - TASTING MENU The tasting menu is a good way to sample the best of what Tableau has to offer. I'm not much of a drinker, but decided to get the wine pairing as well. * Prior to ordering, the chef sent out as an amuse bouche a small sample of cream of potato and chorizo soup. It was full of potato flavor, with a hint of chorizo. * Osetra Caviar Trio. Each of the three items had a small amount of caviar on top: (1) a shot glass of potato soup, with creme fraiche on top, was thick and rich, served cold; good-very good; (2) traditional garnish of creme fraiche, chopped hard boiled egg and chopped onion, all in a china spoon; very good; (3) a scallop cooked on the medium side; very good. * Crab Minestrone. A clear soup with zucchini, beans, and lots of crab. The soup had a lot of flavor, the zucchini was crunchy, the beans were firm, the crab was sweet and firm. * Tasting of Foie Gras. A medium thick steak served on creamed corn. The foie gras was seared on the outside, and had a good flavor, but wasn't as good as at the top places in town.  This was this point at which I realized the generous wine pours were getting me drunk. I would drink only a fraction of each glass hereafter. However, it was too late. I would fall asleep several times. I think the server caught me once (\"Sir? SIR?\").  * Pan Roasted Halibut. The fish was firm, cooked through but still moist. Outstanding flavor. * Prime Filet. The steak was good, but nowhere near as good as at SW Steakhouse. * Camembert. Nutty, bitter. I'm not a Camembert fan, so I rate it Fair. * Selection of Desserts: (1) Roasted banana ice cream had a strong banana flavor; very good. (2) Vanilla pot de creme was like pudding, but so much better. (3) Chocolate souffl was not the best I've had, but was still very good.  Overall, a very good meal indeed. Beware the generous wine pours!  ** LUNCH My only lunch at Tableau was a Dungeness Crab Club Sandwich. In lots of little ways, it was executed very well. The sourdough bread - all three layers - was nicely toasted and had very good flavor. It was firm enough to hold up as a triple decker sandwich, but still soft enough to be easily bitten through. The crab meat was plentiful and tasty. In addition, there were avocado slices, sprouts, sun dried tomatoes, and bacon. Somehow or other, I was able to eat this sandwich without having the contents spill out all over the place. Spiced French fries were served on the side, and were pretty good. Well done!  ** BREAKFAST My breakfasts were: * Banana French Toast, made with raisin brioche and a layer of mashed bananas. The french toast was very good - crispy on the outside, soft inside. However, I thought the banana flavor was too strong, overpowering the rest. Chicken and apple sausage was surprisingly good. * Banana Ricotta Pancakes with Walnut Honey Butter. They were light to medium in texture, with a moderate banana flavor. They were pretty good, but not special. * Poached eggs and duck hash. This was actually part of the weekend brunch menu, but I ate early. The dish consisted of 2 poached eggs on top of a hash of shredded, slightly crisp duck meat, and fried finely diced potatoes. It was delicious. * Kobe short ribs and eggs. Two very attractive stacks, each consisting of: a round, thick, fried potato cake, greasy but good; shredded braised short ribs (very good flavor); gently cooked scrambled egg; a small amount of tangy barnaise sauce. It's very, very rich, but excellent. My favorite breakfast at Tableau.  When I first ate dinner at Tableau, I knew I had just had a very good meal. The food wasn't flashy, but it was very good. Lunch was also very good. Breakfast was a harder sell. I think that part of the problem is that I'm very pedestrian in my tastes with respect to pancakes, French toast, and the like: keep 'em plain, just butter and a little syrup. I had a similar reaction to the highly praised French toast at Bouchon. As long as I stay away from sweet starchy breakfasts, I've been very happy with Tableau.",

    "text": "First of all, 3-stars.  Might go back, might not.  1) FOOD In general, all the food was rather, 'meh'.  My best buddy was the bread roll which was fresh baked and highly necessary to absorb the salt I ingested later.  (See further below) ...The Dungeness Crab Club was reasonable but nothing to write home about.  The sweet tomatoes that they put in there does add some color into an otherwise mild sandwich but other than that, just okay. ...The French Fries are indeed soggy as another reviewer mentioned, but I think they're supposed to be that way?  Maybe?  I dunno.  One way or the other, I didn't think they were all that.  The homemade ketchup however was sweet and delicious and made the fries worth eating. ...The Lobster Bisque really bugged.  This thing was far too hot and extremely salty; it tasted like a sweaty armpit.  Anyone who might have bothered to have tasted it before it left the kitchen would have known how wretched it was.  When the waiter failed to notice my repugnance with the soup, I called him on it and told him to just take it away.  To their credit, the chef admitted that the base had been reduced too far, apologized and brought another bowl which was STILL salty but at least edible this time and at a temperature lower than that of lava.  But guys: You never tasted the soup even once before coming out of the kitchen?  EPIC FAIL. - Lobster Bisque: 1/5 (2/5*) - Dungeness Crab Club: 3/5 - Fries: 3/5 - Bread Roll:  4/5  2) SERVICE I originally told the maitre'd I was very hot from walking the strip and wanted something away from the windows.  So she promptly disregarded my request and put me next to the windows while saying she'd drop the shades.  So she did and it made no frickin' difference.  ...With the great bisque debacle, the service in my mind kinda hit a skid.  The chef failed to identify any issues with soup, nor did the waiter care about the fact that I wasn't eating it. ...To their credit, the busboys were huffin' it.  Grabbed plates quickly, filled my glass promptly. ...But when it came to picking up my credit card, no one was to be found.  I couldn't even find someone to ask, so I flipped out my money roll and paid cash instead and walked out.  3) LOCATION The location is great, like most restaurants at Wynn.  It's a private area behind High Limit Slots past the Tower Suites registration.  Clearly it's aimed at the Tower Suites clientele.  CONCLUSION I might go back with the wife. I suspect that I just had a one-time bad experience but what bugs me is that nothing really stood out in my meal at all to compel me to care about coming back to this restaurant.  I hope I'm wrong.  I think based on the people that were there when I went, this is more of a \"ladies who lunch\" sort of joint in the morning & mid-day.  Lots of wifes from the 'upper crust' Tower Suites co-mingling and lunching together.",

I had 2.5 of these before my lunch (yellowfin tuna tartare) came.  After having had the Wynn breakfast buffet, I wanted something light for lunch.

    "text": "Yet another disappointment from Wynn. Much like the hotel itself, we thought Tableau was completely over-rated. We came here for brunch after reading all the reviews and were expecting great things, but were disappointed. We were seated outside, overlooking the pool, so that was nice. However, it was 100+ outside and the misters at our table were the only ones on the entire patio that weren't working. We actually waited for a good 10 minutes before our server, Evan even asked us what we wanted to drink. When I asked about the misters, he gave me a smart remark. We brushed it off and placed our orders.  I had the eggs benedict and the hubby had the kobe dish. The food came out in a timely fashion, but the food was sub-par for such a fancy restaurant. My english muffin was burnt and I couldn't cut through it with my knife. I ended up eating the ham and egg part separate from the muffin, which were pretty good. The kobe dish was just ok. Nothing special and certainly not worth the price tag.  Now back to the service. We weren't even checked on during the time we were dining. Our server was standing behind us and didn't even ask us if we needed anything! When we were done eating, we had to ask a different server to flag down our server, Evan, for the check. Evan didn't even return with our check; the other server did. Definitely not a 5 star dining experience. Do yourself a favor and stay away from this over-priced mediocre place. If you want real brunch, head over to Bouchon at the Venetian. Oh, and weak mimosas and sour OJ! Thumbs down!",

    "text": "I made the decision to try out every restaurant at the Wynn.  How impressive was Tableau?  I don't even remember what I ate there, and it was just 3 months ago.  Is it one of the nicest restaurants at the Wynn?  Sure.  It has a nice, quiet ambiance, very sophisticated, very quiet.  Will you see any obnoxious frat boys or wannabe Gordon Geckos there?  Nope.  Is it a nice place to take your wife on your anniversary?  Yup.  It's an elegant restaurant that will impress that special someone in your life.  But is the food memorable?  Not even close.  OK, ok, I had the prime filet.  I've had better...SW @ the Wynn was obviously better too.  My buddy at the halibut....he enjoyed his meal, but again, nothing where he was talking about it the next work day.  My other friend had the 7-course chef's meal...but his opinion doesn't matter, since he's a fancy-schmancy dude who's been to Aqua, French Laundry, etc, etc.  Overall, we were pleased with the meal, but not impressed.  Look, I'm not one of those freaks on After Hours with Daniel (go mojo channel), comparing foreplay to appetizers and orgasms to banana ice cream....even though I'm a big fan of banana-flavored anything, so I did enjoy their roasted banana ice cream.  I'm just a regular joe-schmoe who occasionally attempts to be fancy, who attempts to step up the dining sophistication level a bit.  And I don't go to Vegas for the dining......that's #4 or #5 on my TO-DO list.....but I do want to have good food while I'm there.  The Wynn restaurants are really interesting......it's almost like you'll always spend $390 for 3 people there....the bill almost always comes out to that.  Whether it's the SW, Country Club, Tableau, Okada (good sake), Wing Lei (with serious alcohol), or Corsa Cuccina (with serious wine), the bill always comes out to $390.  Kinda scary.  Like most of the restaurants at the Wynn, it's over-rated and over-hyped.  3-star rating in my opinion, but some will add another 1 star because of the environment and the \"Wynn\" factor.",

The service is excellent, our waiter was so on top of it, i could have dropped my napkin and he would have caught it before it hit the ground.  They also have little chairs for your handbags so you dont put them on the ground, because its bad luck! Haha, they have fresh watermelon juice in the morning! That was fun, and if youre there for breakfast, order a side of the potatoes.  Not only was it visually amusing, but everything tasted great.  I would go here again in a heartbeat.",

We had a lovely table, and they automaticaly seated us side-by-side (I liked that), and the staff was great.  I give it three stars because I liked some of my courses (there were blossoms filled with goat cheese that were terrific) but I just was not impressed.  The only fancy meal I've ever enjoyed in Vegas is Picasso.  As I have said in other reviews, I generally am unimpressed with high-end restaurants.  I think it's because they are stuck with a menu and not changing it daily based on what's at the market.  Unspired.",

    "text": "As we were staying at the Wynn, we ended up eating breakfast here. The restaurant is located right off the lobby of the tower suites. The atmosphere is comparable to a casual yet elegant restaurnat found in a Ritz or Four Seasons. Service is definitely in the 5 star category.   At first glance the breakfast menu may seem over priced, but it is justifiable given the atmosphere, service and quality of food. The coffee is excellent. I had an omlette and my girlfriend had the french toast (white chocolate & Orange). No novel experiences here, but the food was flavourful and the eggs were perfectly cooked (IMHO, it is very hard to find perfectly cooked eggs) The Tableau potatoes are what will have me coming back. Croquette like hashbrown cakes with the perfect amount of sea salt sprinkled on each one. The home made ketchup was a nice touch (I missed it the next time I had some Heinz)  I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here if you were staying at a five star on the strip. Chances are your hotel has a very similar restaurant. However, if you are staying at Wynn or Encore I highly recommend Tableau.",

Decided to go here because I wanted to try the white chocolate orange french toast.  This was good but not awesome.  Maybe I had too high expectations after reading these reviews.  I guess I thought the white chocolate flavor was too subtle so it was more like orange french toast.  I also tried kind of a duck benedict.  Chopped duck braised with onions in a pastry.  Topped with scrambled eggs and tomato hollandaise on top.  So tasty!  Only slight complaint was that the hollandaise, although good, did not contain much tomato flavor.  Everything about this place is top notch which is what I would expect from a restaurant at the Wynn.",

    "text": "So mad we wasted 90 dollars at this place. Made a reservation over A WEEK in advance b/c we live in Vegas and my considerate bf wanted to take us out for a nice brunch. Told the hostess I wanted a WINDOW seat and was willing to wait even though we had a reservation if it meant a window.  Wait 15 minutes and get taken to a table even though Im staring at 2 empty window seats. Tell the hostess what I originally said. wait 10 more minutes for a window. 2 window seats available. One still has not been bussed but is a much better seat. One is in the corner meaning one persons view is of the wall. Ask for the former. Again, willing to wait. She comes back and tells me \"that table is already spoken for\". Guess they spoke for it more than a week ago since I had the reservation and noone waiting for a table was ahead of us but tired of waiting. And I'll go ahead and add now that that table sat empty for over 30 minutes so I guess the hostess decided we weren't good enough for that table?   Waiter comes and is very nice, offers suggestions and we order drinks and food. Food comes about 15 minutes later and is wrong. WE NEVER SAW THE WAITER AGAIN! My boyfriend went ahead and ate his food b/c it was getting cold. But that waiter never came back. Some waitress started helping us when we HAD ALREADY FINISHED EATING, pretty much 20 minutes and 2 empty drinks later. I am literally making eye contact with our waiter and he never came back.   SOOOO... waitstaff is great -if you can find them, and food was really good-not what we ordered but we liked it. Overall service was so bad it isn't worth it. There are too many good places to eat to deal with this kind of thing in Vegas. I only give the 2 stars bc the food was really good. The service is BEYOND TERRIBLE.",

I ordered the breakfast meal that included: coffee, juice, pastries, eggs, toast or English muffin, bacon, and YUMMY hashed potatoes balls. Loved it and would highly recommend this spot.

As far as the food, the bread they bought out in the little pans was adorable and very very tasty (and carbs were much needed at this point).  I had the scallops for my main course.

Great place to enjoy breakfast with inviting view and it's okay to indulge yourself on a vacation. Has 3 seating areas, once entered you pass the main dining room which is kinda dark and subdue to be sitting here in the morning, then comes the beautiful indoor enclosure with big french doors - you can sit here without sacrificing view, then comes the patio by the pool.  Breakfast is served different than your usual - nicely presented and all but taste wise I had better. I had the egg benedict and it was a little sour and no it's not rotten. I know they must have overused the vinegar when poaching the eggs. So I didn't enjoy it that much. The only thing that blew me away was the crossiant. It's like Renaud in Santa Barbara. Each bite into are layers of crisp. Best croissant.  Service was good, no grumpy but all could have been better with just a little smile .",

It used to be only reserved for guests of the Tower Suites (don't like that kind of thing), but has since been opened to everyone.    I ordered the roast chicken, something I never do in restaurants, because I'm afraid it will be dry.  I just needed something lighter that night.  This dish is far from what I expected.  It was wonderfully juicy and tender with an almost sweet sauce that just brought the dish together.    Our waiter was friendly and chatty.  I know nothing about wines, but  we were celebrating our anniversary, so I decided to have a glass.  I described to him what I like and he brought me a glass of liquid heaven.  WOW.  I enjoyed it so much, I asked him to write down the name for me.   He even brought me the bottle to show me what it looked like so I could find it in the store.  Very nice.  It's a beautiful restaurant with partial views of the elaborate pool area.  Looks almost like the living room of a chateau transformed into a restaurant.  The decor is very unique, but it's a bit stuffy - like you're afraid to laugh too loudly when you're there.  Or if you drop your fork, you almost want to apologize for the noise.  The food is good, and I do recommend it, but it's more of a private, special occasion type place.",

We were comped our meals and looking for a place to eat, and after one look at this place, we instantly chose it for lunch.  They have a very unique polygonal room at the end of the restaurant and that is where we chose to sit.  On a nice day, they do have service outside along the terrace which is wonderful, but that day was cold so we opted to stay inside.  Service was good enough in the beginning.  We ordered the seared sea scallops, caesar salad, yellowfin tuna tartare and the steak.  They came out with fresh bread and butter and the bread was individually baked and presented.  That in itself deserves the 5-star rating.  Next we were presented with our main courses, but they somehow forgot about the tuna tartare.  The steak was medium rare, cooked perfectly over polenta.  The sea scallops (5) were also perfectly cooked and with a nice tangy salad in the middle.  My Caesar salad had whole romaine leaves and the perfect amoutn of dressing was added.  The bread croutons and saved cheese was also tasty.  My tuna tartare came out very late, but definitely well worth the wait.  Large chunks of tuna with mango and avocado and hot sauce was absolutely amazing.  I really can't forget the tuna tartare, and I kept raving about it at Vegas.  I was told by our server that Steve Wynn himself orders double orders of the tuna whenever he stays in the hotel.  Tuna Tartare = $24 Steak = $22 Seared Sea Scallops = $27 Caesar Salad = $14",

Salmon was extremely high quality, all the fixings on the side (capers, tomatoes, onions) were very fresh, the cream cheese was ample, bagel was perfectly toasted. Just delicious and priced fairly at $17. The potatoes were very unique --- gooey and crispy at the same time, never had anything quite like these.   Lunch Tomato bisque was AMAZING. Wonderful portion size, served with the soft fluffy bread on the side in the mini tin pot. The bisque really surprised me. And the crab cake sandwich with fries --- most places cheap out on the crab, load up on the fries. The exact opposite here. Excellent high grade crab, well made sandwich, and the fries were just enough. The flavor of the fries was excellent (love the spice they put on top of the fries). Again, very fairly priced for what I got.  Service was fast and friendly. For this quality, at these prices, in this ambiance, with this consistency, I need to bump it up from my previous 4.5 stars to a 5 star. Welcome, Tableau, to my rare 5 star club (  Bread Very soft, fluffy, cute presentation.  Shrimp and scallop ceviche Served in a martini glass with a small spoon. Great presentation. The flavor was outstanding and the portion of fish was generous. It was just delish, well done.  Tuna tartare Now everyone had talked about this dish so I had high expectations. This lived up!!! Wow, I should have just done a double order of this for lunch! It was well balanced, very fresh, just spectacular. Not the most filling thing but it's all about quality not quantity, right?  Service Attentive. When I asked for the check, I had about 90% of my iced tea left. With the check, she brought a plastic to go cup in case I wanted to take my iced tea to go (I did). Nice touch.  All around, very impressive. The only reason this is not 5 stars is that for a 65 dollar lunch, I still got hungry a few hours later. So the \"value factor\" isn't really there. But 4.5 stars for sure.",

    "text": "Where's MY bread?  We actually had a great time over some great food in this hidden little restaurant, until the bread fiasco.  We were seated in the atrium overlooking the pool area for our lunch. The atrium was full with about 5 other couples, but the rest of the place was empty. Quiet & cozy. A good break from the bustle of Vegas. Some Merlot, a bottle of Pellegrino, a pina colado (not for me, surprisingly). We were hungry and the wait was average, so as we waited, we noticed the small plates for bread. Thought it was odd that there were no pre-meal dishes. But no one else had bread so maybe it was just for brunch.   I decided to indulge in a little red meat while I was out of town & had the filet of beef, which was a small filet mignon with mushrooms, spinach, crisped onions, stacked on a marinated bread. Wonderful and intricate. A perfect portion, unlike some Vegas meals which stuff you past walking capability. My guy had a lobster salad which he relayed was divine. Veggie stir-fry & quinoa as sides.  At this point, the table next to us asked for some bread for their party. The server came out with rolls in individual baking dishes... for the entire room... except our table. The table to my right was waiting for their dessert, and got bread. The table behind me was enjoying their entrees, and got bread. The table past the table to our left (which asked for the bread) had just been seated, and got bread. WTF!  We ordered and ate our Mini Pie Trio, paid our $150 lunch bill, and left feeling slighted.",

They brought us the wrong food first and we couldn't find our server to let him know about that. When we told another waiter that they brought us the wrong order it took him about 5 min to send some one to get the food and we had to wait additional 15 min to get our food. No one was there to refill our coffee and we wanted to order more juice but we couldnt find our waiter. We even asked other waiters for coffee but every time they were saying they need to find our waiter and they would forgot about that finally we decided to leave since we were really unsatisfied with the service and we asked for the check it took them 15min to bring us the check and then we waited for additional 10 minutes for some one to come get our credit card and when I noticed no one is going to come I walked to the front and handed them the check and my credit card and it took them 10 min to come back with my receipt. It was a really unpleasant experience.",

On our first visit, we got the normal eggs benedict and lemon ricotta pancakes.  The second time we got the crab cake benedict and the same pancake.  All of the above was fantastic.  It doesn't look like a ton of food, but we felt very full after both meals.  ALSO, I'm a pescatarian, so we requested the filet mingon from the crab cake benedict on the side for one of them.  They didn't act like this was weird, which was nice.  The service was fantastic both days.  We were obviously not the typical Wynn-clientele, but they still treated us very well.  I even got a little purse chair for my frumpy messenger bag!  The ambiance in the restaurant was extremely pleasant.  Both times we ate indoors, but in their window area.  There is some outdoor seating and indoor seating with no sunlight.    It is, as are most restaurants in Vegas, pricey.  I feel like if you plan your meals well in Vegas, you can splurge on something like this every once in a while.",

I thoroughly enjoyed my salmon Benedict. An egg white omelet was also a success. The lobster fritatta was thoroughly disappointing as was their homemade ketchup. The granola with greek yogurt was quite good. Food came out quickly, which everyone appreciates after a long night.   Overall, the food was decent enough to return but the service is what was a bit annoying. Especially considering how empty it was. Five hosts were standing around doing nothing.",

My family and I were a party of six for a Thanksgiving Day luncheon; we had chosen Tableau because there were vegetarians in the group and Wynn properties have a good reputation for vegetarian fare.  Despite having a reservation that I reconfirmed, they didn't even start setting up the six-top until we had arrived.  I had read reviews saying service is slowwwww, so I was prepared for that but it was still maddeningly slow.  There's something disjointed about their serving protocols - there are a ton of people in constant motion, but nobody is bringing anything to your table.  Very long intervals between items; example, bread service came...and then nothing. Most of us started with soup; we asked for more bread service to go WITH the soup...it wasn't brought until everyone had FINISHED their soup.  They never offered more alcoholic beverages after the one, long-awaited round.  No coffee offered after the meal.  The room is BEAUTIFUL; light, airy and floral.  The staff is personable...during the brief, long-awaiting appearances they make.  The food is amazing; their prix fixe Thanksgiving meal was very good.  But the disjointed, inattentive service makes you so angry that even the amazing food can't compensate.",

The hosts advised us to wait a couple of minutes (we waited about 10). We sat down and the host gives me this mini chair to put my bag. I thought that was uberly cute! The table setting was nice and the server too. The atmosphere and the vibe- I'll give it a 5/5.   Food: My friend ordered the Spanish omelette and I ordered an item that was off the menu. I tried my friend's omelette and the Spanish omelette was rly good! It had a very interesting taste to it. I had a French toast and that was rly good too! The only reason I give a star down is because of the portion. The portion is a little small (maybe bc it's fine dining?). Other than the portion part this place is a must come! Also it's perfect spot for a brunch date!",

First visit: I ordered grilled salmon and it was absolutely melt-in-your-mouth delicioso; it was tender and so moist, I felt compelled to reenact that epic orgasm scene from When Harry Met Sally.  Alas, I realized that I was dining at the Wynn and I couldn't bear acting any way other than classy in any one of his properties--except for XS and Tryst, if you know what I mean.  Hur hur hur. Aside from the food, service and demeanor from the wait staff were damn near impeccable.  I was given a mini chair for my purse. For. My. Purse.  Now, let me tell you that my mind was BLOWN away by the awesomeness factor and the meticulousness considered in favor of the customers' comfort.  My purse was safe from the dirt and E. coli on the floors!  Just wow.   Second visit:  I ordered the French toast.  C'mon.  I had to have it.  I had to try it.  I can't NOT try every single French toast I see on whatever menu I can get my grubby hands onto.  Anyway, it was mediocre.  The presentation was great, but the bread was soggy and couldn't stand up against the custard. The upside was that the bread was a multi-grain oat bread, so I got a good dose of fiber. Again, service was great and made up for the lackluster French toast.  The wait staff was cordial and helpful; you can't go wrong with that.",

And thats where I've stayed the past 4-5 Vegas trips!  I loooove Wynn tower suites, coming out of the elevator to Tableu, getting seated right away, cute striped cushions, fine dining service without the stiffness.. just the entire experience.    Then.. delish food:). Everything I had was immaculate, and simply so yumm.  Don't forget to get fries, they serve it with homemade ketchup.  Its a bit more tomatoey, some tartness, and absolutely divine.  I love my waffles there, French toast, the pancakes, crab cakes, the potatoes, homemade jam.. I can go on & on.  And freshly \"squeezed\" Watermelon juice!  Trust, splurge on it!  I usually sit indoors, but you'll find me outside when the weather is warm with a slight breeze.  Plus, its nice seeing the private pool area for those (me included!) with a tower suite key  Ps. I'm the 100th review for Tableu, yay!",

    "text": "\"Sublime Elegance\"  Deep in the recesses of the Wynn casino, amidst the bustling shoppes and casino activities, lies this hidden gem. Having a friend who prefers a vegan diet brought me to search for Tableau. They serve breakfast and lunch only. They have separate menus for different types of allergens and another for vegan/vegetarian, so ask for them if they are a concern.  We ended having lunch at the bright and airy conservatory with pristine surroundings that was akin to stepping back in time --there was a sense of understated formality from the wait staff to the china to the ambiance. And the food --simple, sublime, scrumptious.  With the bread tray, chose the corn bread which I ate with big dabs of butter. The Pan roasted salmon burger with seasonal fries was just magical with their homemade ketchup, where the seeds from the tomatoes peeked with eagerness.  Eating for the most part gluten-free but not bound by it, I had to eat half of the burger bun, which was soft and delicate yet truly held its form.  The service was more reserved (coffee & cream was at the beginning and refilled towards the end) but not necessarily unwelcome. My vegan friend completely enjoyed her Oriccehette pasta dish. Couple that wonderful conversation and it really seemed that time passed by slowly. That beautiful meal. That beautiful experience.",

It was our last day in vegas and we had resort credit to spend still. We ordered the seafood platter $72 which was AMAZINGGGGG!! We also got the duck ravioli, Prawns plate, Salmon salad and a few other plates. The service here was perfect and didn't come to the table too many times to disturb us. YOU HAVE TO GET THE DUCK RAVIOLI! So delicious!!! I will have to come back here to eat all the other good stuff on the menu but there wasn't one thing that we weren't disappointed about.",

    "text": "BEAUTIFUL & TASTY   Located inside the Wynn Hotel...   The positives...  - beautiful ambiance & decor. The sun shines in this bright little restaurant and lights it up in the most charming way - staff courteous & attentive - food was DELICIOUS but small portions. The crab cake, apple pancakes and French dip sandwich was packed with flavor.  - free bread was from a VARIETY basket with garlic cheese bread, corn bread (my fav it was like a dessert), foccacia and plain.   Negatives...  - pricey. Bagels lox $20?! Bowl of corn chowder $16?! Chowder was bland I had it sent back.  - portions were small- delicious but tiny.  .... Examples: The corned beef hash wasn't a hearty plate but 3 little patties that looked like cakes with eggs. My husband looked dumb trying to eat it lol ..... Example: The French dip sandwich came open faced in a small bowl. It tasted amazing but it didn't fill us up.   Beautiful restaurant though... great for dates or brunch with the girls... but not for 3 big dudes wanting a hangover recovery meal lol.",

The place is clean, classy, and beautiful. I've come here in the Fall, Summer, and Winter and have to say the spring is my favorite time! The outside portion of the restaurant is open so you can choose a table to sit out overlooking the pool and it's just a beautiful atmosphere.  I just recently came in here in January on a weekday and the outside was closed so that was a bummer but understood as it was freezing in Las Vegas at this time. We ordered French toast and eggs Benedict. The French toast was just as amazing as it has always been! The eggs Benedict were a little disappointing as we thought it would come with potatoes but it literally only came with one small potatoes piece. I remember when I had come here with a group of people in the summer there was a dress code policy; no shorts, no hats on backwards (I wouldn't wear one here at all), or swimwear. We also ordered nearly the entire brunch menu and it was all delicious but Ofcourse super expensive. As a fancy restaurant, I'd say the prices are probably what they're supposed to be, if not overpriced, about $22 for a couple eggs on bread. The portions are definitely small for the price you pay but this is definitely a place to visit at least once while in Vegas. It's a cute place to come to for brunch.",

They have a chair purse to hold your purse!   Service was exceptional. Our server Amina was great. She was very attentive and thorough going over ingredients in the entrees we were ordering. She made sure we met with chef Corey as we needed to make sure certain entrees we were ordering could be prepared safely for my daughter with food allergies. Thank you to both Amina & Chef Corey! We really enjoyed our relaxed breakfast. It was special!  Amina made a recommendation to dine at Lakeside which is also in the hotel. Great suggestion!   GOOD PLACE  IF YOU HAVE ALLERGIES . Chef Corey was so accommodating!   We enjoyed the acai booster, belgian waffles, apple pancakes, bacon, iced coffee and arnold palmer. We are definitely going back to try other entrees! Expect typical hotel prices. Atmosphere is so worth it!  SECOND VISIT- decided to come back over our 3 day stay in Vegas. We ordered breakfast  and dine in and also ordered a  lunch to go. We thought better to eat a allergy friendly meal at the airport.  Chef Corey was so friendly and thoughtful to make substitutions where needed to make the meal perfect! His smile is infectious. He makes you want to smile.  Chefs do not get enough recognition as they are behind the scenes doing their thing! Meet Chef Corey he will make your day!",

Valet is free with validation (as long as you spend $50+ at Tableau), then walking through the Wynn is beautiful. The only drawback was it took a while to get seated even though we had a reservation!

This restaurant is inside the Wynn so everyone was dressed well like they're going to a yacht party or something.  The downside was the wait, I didn't have a reservation & it was about 45min to an hour before we were seated. Service was great. Our server was very attentive.   For drinks, I ordered the orange zest juice. It was GOOD & very fresh. For my meal, I ordered the Belgian waffles with a side of eggs. Belgian waffles were AMAZING! Crisp & not overly sweet. I don't eat bacon though so I guess I can't really give a full review on the taste since I pushed them to the side.",

You won't be disappointed!  We had a mimosa of course.  I think it was made with Grapefruit Juice.  Very good as well.   While dining, You'll notice residents of the Wynn hanging out at the pool, which located next to the outdoor dining area.  Made us want to grab some more mimosas and hang out a while!

For brunch we dined inside at a round table near the doors that open up to the pool. Its charming decor, abundance of natural light, and delicious selection of food would make me keep coming back for years. The atmosphere is classy yet relaxed. There are plenty of tables with nice views of the tower suites pool area. Service is on point. Food is even better.   The complimentary pastries and house-made jam was a great start to our brunch. Seriously, the jams are a must-try. They have a pretty standard selection of breakfast dishes to choose from and a separate vegan menu. My favorite was the Spanish omelet. The avocado inside made every bite incredible, and the sauce on the side was so good.   A few hours later we did not experience the same level of service and expediency while sitting out by the pool. We had to wait an hour to get two drinks, and we heard plenty of other people complaining as well. Somebody in the cabana nearby had to wait an hour for a burger only to receive a burger with a rock-solid bun. I'm not sure how the service for the pool area differed so drastically from the service we had indoors for brunch, but they need to do something about that. Thankfully, they comped our drinks, but it still was an inconvenience on our time.",

Before the entree arrives, a server will bring a little sweet treat to nibble on, compliments of the chef.  There's something for most anyone...since I don't care for eggs, I was able to find pancakes, waffles, fruit plates, granola, etc. on the menu..    We never felt rushed during our meal, and the hostesses will remember you by name if you have reservations for 2 or more days in a row.  The restaurant is conveniently located near the elevators to the Tower Suites.",

Started with an assortment of breads that were all fantastic!! Then started with purify which is a green juice that was really tasty!! Got the egg Benedict which was reasonable, with well made poached egg over ham and muffin with hollandaise sauce!! But you would think at a place like Wynn that the waiters and bus boys are trained better...we had 4 people at the table and 1 was still eating but they picked up the other 3 plates and left the one person eating on their own...it's like restaurant 101 training...hoe awkward for the one person to eat on their own?? Guess it's too much to expect someone to take 5 minutes to do basic restaurant etiquette...",

    "text": "Tower Suites breakfast review: over the course of a week, we sampled nearly every item on the Tower Suites menu.  Ambience: Steeped in elegance and attention to detail, in keeping with the Wynn. Case in point: Italian cotton napkins. The masked portraits that adorn the backs of the Louis chairs are a sight to behold!   Service: Fantastic for the most part - the hostesses went above and beyond to seat us promptly, and the wait staff were amiable. However, on some occasions (especially when it appeared that shifts were changing), service was inattentive, notwithstanding the off-peak tourist season: amuse-bouches were altogether skipped, entrees were ordered but not delivered in their entirety.   Food: The amuse-bouche typically consisted of freshly squeezed mocktails e.g. lime & fennel. Entrees  that struck a chord included \"Eggs Benedict\" (excellent Hollandaise sauce!) , \"White Chocolate French Toast\" (exquisite flavour complimented by rum maple syrup), \"Buttermilk Apple Pancakes\" (stuffed to the rafters with apple and pecans), \"Spanish Omelette\" (zesty!), and their \"Fruit Plate\" (included sweet pitahayas and rambutans). The \"Tableau Breakfast\" and \"Continental Breakfast\" were excellent value, featuring a hearty pastry basket that was large enough to share around the table. Sadly, their lip-smacking \"Bananas Foster\" (available in 2017) did not feature on the menu this month.  Verdict: Barring the infrequently inconsistent service, the cuisine is phenomenal!   Tips:  - Probably best to make reservations to avoid a potentially long wait for a table (plus earn OpenTable points).  - Tables by the windows, or in the conservatory, command the best views of the Tower Suites pool area.",

Receiving the breakfast took 30 minutes.  The eggs Benedict was dry, with flavorless ham, eggs cooked to hard stage, and a minuscule dollop of hollandaise.  They never cleared the table of detritus, such as empty juice glasses, empty plates, or empty tea pots. The sweetener ran out, and was not restocked. I had to go to another table to get more. Similarly when I needed to break a bill,couldn't  get the waitstaff's attention - so I had to walk up front to ask for change. Delightful decor, but miserable food & service.  Not worth the high cost. Wynn buffet would be better at 20% of the price!",

I had made reservations at 10 AM and got there at 10 AM on the dot.  Despite having reservations, we were still not seated until 10:30-definitely a negative.  I was also super excited to try out the vegan menu, however was surprised by the lack of options.  I was expecting it to be a bit more extensive.  We split the apple pancakes, frittata, and peach smoothie amongst the three of us in my party.  We also got a flight of juices, which were 3 mini shots of the various kind of juices they make.  Tiny amount considering the hefty price tag.  They gave us these mini cinnamon donuts at the beginning, which was actually probably my favorite part of the meal.  The frittata was mediocre for sure, however the pancakes were delicious.    The main pro of this place is the beautiful ambience.  Would love to sit outside on a sunny day.  Unfortunately this place was a bit pricey for the quality in my opinion.  Also, a bit frustrating having to wait despite having reservations, however once we were seated the service was great.  I would definitely come here again.",

There was a short wait of around 30 minutes which was not a problem as we wisely utilized our time at the slot machines! ;) Located in the Wynn hotel, the restaurant is hidden deep behind the elevators - if you get lost, look up at the directory to guide your way through!  I ordered their eggs benedict topped with savory hollandaise sauce and two small hash browns. This entree was super delish! The eggs were cooked to perfection. The combination of english muffins, ham, poached egg and their sweet hollandaise sauce was very pleasant! I also had a side order of toast along with their very own house special jam that I instantly fell in love with. It was sweet and delectable served on a warm piece of toast! Their fresh squeezed orange juice was pretty darn good. (*Fyi, it's $6 for a small glass which does not include refills!)   Service here is great. We were well taken care of by our waitress who was very attentive with refills on my cup of coffee. This place is the first time I've seen the hosts provide women a small stool to set their purses on. Very unusual, but classy I suppose.  There were plenty of windows surrounding letting natural sunlight in creating a very soothing ambiance. I would definitely recommend this place for everyone to try out for breakfast!",

    "text": "We selected Tableau because we wanted to be able to make reservations for brunch for a special occasion. Surprisingly, there are not many places in town that fit that bill.  Many places (understandably) will not consider a wait list for breakfast or brunch unless you go to their establishment. And we just didn't want to wait in a long line.   SHORT VERSION: food = 5 stars; service = 3/4 stars; ambiance = 5 stars  FOOD: Come on, it's the Wynn, so quality is on the menu. And the options include simple American fare: steak sandwiches, seafood soup, basic breakfasts, and a few (but not a wealth of) respectful vegetarian and vegan options added balance to what seemed like a fairly basic breakfast menu.  And everything we ate (see above) was delicious. The bread basket was outstanding and the homemade jams and ketchup were stand outs.   Side note: I think they have the best fries in town. I haven't collected any data or done any local fry comparison, but those fries were perfect. I said it--perfect.   DECOR: I loved the indoor design and color scheme. I admit to finding other parts of the Wynn a little ornate for my taste, but the light colors and romantic shapes coupled with the with the mixed motifs on the upholstery leads to a modern/light/elegant feel to the space. Outside the landscaping and arrangement does all of the ambiance work. As it should. The pool area isn't \"pretty\", but the strategic use of foliage and color and shape make it feel special. I don't know that any casino in town has provided as much outdoor restaurant space as the Wynn has.   SERVICE: Surprisingly, the service left me wavering between 3 and 4 stars for the experience. Our glasses were left empty for so long that we finally had to flag down a different waiter to request service. While not our waiter, the man who helped us was incredibly accommodating and responsive.  But the lapse of service outside was not limited to our table. And that was a disappointment.  Does it even need to be said that part of the experience in a place like Tableau is the service?   IS IT \"DRIVE TO THE STRIP WORTHY\"? No.   OVERALL:  I enjoyed the meal (particularly the fries) and would return with guests. But I didn't love it because of the lapse in service and the simplicity of the dishes.  If I want brunch on the strip with a nice outdoor view and I don't need to make reservations, there are  options where service is always spot on and I enjoy a slightly more creative menu.  The spotty service was a surprise as a Wynn property, but more disappointing was the feeling that this level of service was not unusual for the outdoor seating area.  I thoroughly enjoyed my meal and am confident others would as well, but I am not in a rush to get back.",

    "text": "I wanted to like it but the breakfast entrees were really bland. Salt could not save it. We had 3 guests but they never cleared the fourth table setting. They neglected to bring the toast with the entree. They didn't remove the unused coffee cups.  Service was on the slow side to engage but that's ok. I don't go expecting fast service.  It was a business like engagement with the waiter. No pleasantries. If you are going to sell a $17 cup of coffee, let the guest press or brew the coffee at the table. Rethink the bulk sugar packets. Otherwise make the coffee $4 and get 5 stars. For $17 you invite high expectations.",

The bright light decor aims to wake you up after a night of winning/losing, dining/drinking, and whatever other behaviors Las Vegas inspires.  The staff at Tableau are attentive and knowledgeable.  For lunch, I had the baby kale and romaine caesar with grilled shrimp.  What a great lunch!  The greens were fresh and crisp.  The dressing was tangy and savory but not over-powering.  The shrimp were enormous and probably more aptly described a prawns (though tasted like shrimp!).  The lunch rolls were freshly baked and delicious.  Overall, Tableau is a phenomenal lunch spot.  I'd go again in a heartbeat!",

It has the feel of an airport lounge in the sense that the crowd inside is trying to relax and escape the crowd outside. Coffee is free at the cafe in the front of the restaurant while you wait  We enjoyed breakfast there. I ordered the ricotta which came on a rosemary pastry that was absolutely delicious as well as fruit and a balsamic drizzle. I also enjoyed a mimosa and a perfect latte.   Only downside here was service. Our server was nowhere to be found almost the entire time! I had to flag someone else to go find him when I wanted to order something.",

    "text": "I have no idea how this place can possibly be 4 stars on Yelp unless I'm just one of the few reviewers who appreciates salt and flavor. The only good thing that Tableau has going for it is the ambiance and decor but that's it.  First off, my group of 6 had reservations for brunch. When we arrived, they said that they were getting the table ready for us. Not a problem so we sat on the couch. Fast forward over 45 minutes and someone from our group having to ask 3 times why the table was still not ready, and they finally sat us down. During the time we were waiting, there was no one sitting at the table for us, and no one was prepping anything because it took them all of 5 minutes to set everything up after our third complaint.   Then we get to the food itself. Amongst the 6 of us, we got 2 orders of the traditional breakfast, corn beef hash, eggs benedict, omelette, and acai bowl. The traditional breakfast that is somehow $30 came with a side of pastries that were Sam's Club quality or honestly even worse. Bacon and eggs were reminiscent of what I can cook at home, and I could buy the sourdough bread from Kroger and basically recreate the same meal with the same quality for less than $5. Eggs benedict had 0 salt added to it and was so bland. The omelette had 0 salt added to it and was so bland. I didn't bother trying the corn beef hash or acai bowl but no one in the group was even remotely happy with the meal.  TLDR: do yourself a favor and go to McDonald's for breakfast instead because you'll be happier with the quality of the food, the price, and the service",

After a nice time mingling with the party, dinner was served.  First was a fresh tuna tartare.  Next a choice between Caesar salad and crab cake. I must have been in a fish mood - the crab cake was superb, filled with nice chunks of crab, cooked just right.  The next choice was beef or salmon - I continued with the fish.  The salmon was perfect, a huge portion.  Only question was the vegetables seemed to be same as the passed starter. Dessert was over the top - an ice cream parfait and a chocolate truffle lollipop and a so-called strawberry donut.  I think the latter was a panacotta, a dessert I usually do not like. It was delicious, the best I've ever had!",

And they give you a slide of cheese tell you to put in your burger yourself.   It's almost a joke but it happened. My husband and I have been there a couple of times and we had great experiences. Today we took two of our friends over to get brunch. My husband and his friend ordered Crab Benedict the eggs were overcooked. We called the manager over to explain the situation the manager was nice but not helpful. She said she gonna fix it but she didn't take the dish with her. While I was joking to my husband about you never want to leave the dish that customer not satisfied on the table. The manager came back with 2 eggs on the planet and told us to enjoy, and she took off the charge for this dish. We were shocked and at the same time, I can't stop laughing. We called her back again and tell her please put this dish back on our bill,  because we just want a Crab Benedict that's cooked right, we can pay for it. She apologized and came back very quickly with a new dish.  Also, our waiter didn't show up for 10 mins after we sat down. He was nice but we just can't find him. We need to call another waiter to get our check. I asked for hot sauce for my dish, but the hot sauce didn't come until I was halfway done with my dish.  Not to mention my dish is pretty plain and our friends dish was very salty. Overall, we were all very disappointed with this place. We won't go back..",

You get a \"fine dining\" experience in an elegant setting where you can people watch at the wynn pool.   Cocktails are unique and tasty. I had the ginger peach tea but the blueberry lemonade was definitely a favorite at our table. It was a bit sweeter.  I had the mushroom sandwich and it was pretty good and had an interesting taste. It had brie and walnuts in the sandwich and came with a salad. I'm not sure if it's a $21 sandwich but I ate it all. If you're craving something traditional and eggy, I'd say stick to your gut and order eggs. My sister had the spanish omelette and thought it was tasty.  We ordered sides of truffle fries, and tableau potato. They were both awesome. The potatoes looked like little pancakes and were well seasoned. A few of us also ordered the white chocolate french toast which was not on the menu and they all loved it.   The finishing touches were my latte. It came with a crystal sugar lollipop that I used to stir in my latte. It made me happy.  My ultimate favorite part was the assortment of fresh bread to choose from. I got the seasoned tomato bread and loved it. There was corn bread, ciabatta, and other varieties to choose from.",

Breakfast here is included with the Tower Suites and you get a special menu to choose from. That said, the menu still offers quite a bit of choices.   I ate here four out of my five mornings at the Wynn. I had the eggs benedict one morning and after that I just got the Tableau breakfast which includes eggs, bacon, toast, juice and a pastry basket (which is great for later on as a mid day snack).   Honestly, the best part of dining here is the service. It's just such a great way to start your day in this beautiful setting. I'm looking forward to our next family vacation and starting off my days at Tableau.",

We came for breakfast and were seated overlooking the pool area.   Ordered a bunch of different stuff - avocado toast, blueberry pancakes, tableau breakfast - all of which were delicious.  The latter was particularly good because it came with a little bit of everything- eggs, bacon, toast, a mini cheddar scone and potato and an awesome basket of assorted mini pastries and breads. Very satisfying!  I loved the little touch of watermelon cucumber mini shooter that they brought around to all the tables when the food came.   Overall it was a great meal and I will definitely go back on my next trip to Wynn.  P.S. the homemade ketchup was really good. (When is the last time you've ever said that?)",

Sit inside or outside, and enjoy a peaceful breakfast that is thoughtfully prepared and elegantly presented.  My husband and I dined here on three consecutive mornings.    On Monday, our server was Gabriel (Gabe).   He was fantastic!   Full of smiles and easy conversation, and very attentive and genuine.   Loved him.   We each had the Spanish Omelet and devoured it.    I will attach a pic.  Was the perfect amount of food, and since I have a phobia of eating undercooked foods (weirdo), I asked them to make sure the eggs were cooked hard, and they graciously complied without burning it.     For the next two days, Antonio was our server.    He was also spot-on, laughed with us, remembered us on the second day and even remembered the things we talked about.   We tried the Eggs Benedict and the breakfast sandwich.     While I love Eggs Benedict, mine tasted great but was a tad on the cold side, although I didn't say anything because I think it was because we were dining outside on a windy day.   The breakfast sandwich was excellent.   I loved the sweetness of the tomato-jalapeno jam, and it paired perfectly with the house made hot sauce that Antonio brought me on the side.  Even the ketchup at Tableau is housemade.   One would think that ketchup is just ketchup, right?   Not here.   Even the ketchup is gourmet and better than any ketchup you've ever had in your life.  All in all, Tableau is a fantastic choice while at the Wynn.    Impeccable service and top notch fare.",

A must try is their ricotta pancakes, they are dense yet light and have an amazing flavor - you won't want to eat any other type of pancakes after this.  Its the simple things that really excite me and I was practically knocked out of my chair when I ordered a sampling of toast and received homemade jams (and trust me you can tell it is fresh made).  The orange marmalade had the most perfect ring of orange rind that was never ending, someone had hand peeled that orange rind all the way from top to bottom without once breaking the peel, it was candied and caramelized to perfection.   I go to Tableau every time I come to Vegas, it is that good.  However, my recent concern is regarding the change in chefs, the original chef of Tableau has now opened Botero in Encore.  So I feel that Tableau has now changed a bit its food  finesse, it may not be as good as I remember it, but still one of the most luxurious breakfasts you can get in Vegas.  I have never tried it for lunch or dinner, breakfast is just too good.",

    "text": "We went to Tableau for brunch with our Bachelorette to treat her to what we thought would be a nice time.  Instead, we encountered the worst service of my entire life.    I'm not complaining about the food at all.  In fact, the food was delicious.  We ordered the tomato bisque, the eggs benedict, dungeness crab club sandwich, yellowfin tuna tartare, huckleberry buttermilk pancakes, and scrambled eggs w duck puff pastry. Their cocktails were super yummy, too.    But is a restaurant really great only for their food?  Are we paying only for the meal?  NO.  We're paying for great service, too.  I cannot believe how bad the service was, and how it progressively got worse throughout our meal.  The first thing that went wrong was our server didn't take our order until about 30 minutes after we were seated.  The second thing that went wrong was that the complimentary bread that came out (in super cute little pots) was COLD.  Then the waitress forgot about our cocktails and we had to remind her to bring them.  To make matters worse, she decided to tell us some ridiculous story about how the bartender had to go the cellar to get wine and that's why the drinks were late.    And here we get to the worst part of the meal.  Our check.  First of all, when the waitress handed us the check, she told us that a 18% gratuity had been added because our party was larger than 7.  Of course, this we expected, but when we looked at the bill, they had NOT added the gratuity.  We told her so, and she adjusted the bill to reflect that.  Then, the Bachelorette in our party told us that she had given her credit card to the hostess (on a fake restroom run), and that the bill should have been taken care of.  We asked our waitress for the credit card, and that we would be paying for the meal.  However, they could not locate the credit card.  It took them a good 30 minutes for them to track it down.  HOW RIDICULOUS WAS THAT?!  The entire time, we're just waiting and waiting, and it was FREEZING outdoors.  No offer for blankets, no one in upper management to come out and apologize to us.  I don't understand how an upscale restaurant in a nicer hotel on the Strip could be THIS BAD.  At this point, I'm just venting, so I'm just going to end this review here.  I WOULD NEVER EVER EVER go back to Tableau.  I would NEVER recommend it to ANYONE.  You can get good food elsewhere.  Seriously.  Don't go here.  It's not worth it.  I created a Yelp account JUST TO REVIEW THIS RESTAURANT because it was so horrible.",

The first morning we were really happy to see they served brunch till 2:30p on a Sunday morning and the second time we were late again for breakfast service but they said they had no problem serving it to us at noon. My husband loved the blueberry pancakes and I enjoyed their chicken with Quinoa. The second morning we enjoyed the pancakes again and their lox on a bagel was really tasty. The food is delicious and we would go back.",

Sure $16 for a burger is a bit much, but when you on vacation and you are in Vegas, who cares.  Life is short so spend it if you can.  I will be back in Vegas in a couple of weeks and will be trying the breakfast.",

Best yet, the flavor of duck meat remaind prominent in this well coordinated shuffle of flavors. The truffles fries were among the best fries I can recall. The vegan burger was wonderful. Overall, it all tasted home made and wholesome.  The vegan chocolate milk shake and mouse deserve their own paragraph. I am not usually fond of excessively phonetic writing, but: wow. It is incredible to think this is vegan: creamy, rich and well balanced.  Two opportunities for improvement: one patron slipped in with a profanity written across his shirt, despite dress code, and wait staff hard to understand when pronouncing some of the menu items.  Overall, a solid choice for an elegant brunch in Vegas.",

Yes, but have you been to Vegas lately? Everything is expensive. This one however was worth every penny.   We walked on a busy Saturday morning for brunch, a large group and our wait was about 30-40 min. We were seated indoors, due to the cold. Our server Georgina really took care of us, she answered all of our questions and really tended to us the whole two and a half our we were seated there. The food? AMAZeeeee!   What I tried? Their fresh juices, the Bloody Mary, the intelligentsia coffee, the steak Benedict and the duck hash. The duck hash was perfectly combined with a creamy cheese sauce inside of a puff pasty  topped with eggs any style you want. The steak Benedict had decadent crab meat hidden underneath which complimented the steak and bernaise sauce beautifully!  This was an amazing meal I will cherish forever and I cannot wait to go back to the Wynn to enjoy this amazing meal again.   Oh did I mention they have a little cushion for your purse! This place is a must try, please try it, you will not be disappointed!",

We shared a Chile-lime avocado salad that Amy our server recommended.  My cousin ordered the salmon burger, and I had a vegan Wynn cheeseburger, fries and vegan chocolate shake.

From the relaxing views of the well manicured gardens to the elegant dining atmosphere, no detail is overlooked at this posh \"English tea party\" inspired restaurant.   The brew here is eye opening and the OJ is freshly squeezed. Small details IMO that make the dining experience that much more enjoyable. In this day and age, we all know little things do mean a lot!  In regards to the brunch fare, I was pleasantly surprised with both the quality and flavor. You can tell the execution was performed with distinction & care.  Although the white chocolate French toast was the claim to fame here, I was hooked by the pictures of fluffy blueberry pancakes on my iPhone Yelp app. Suffice it to say, I was not disappointed at all. It was as fluffy and soft as I expected. I would have preferred more fresh blueberries, but with all things considered,  it was still quite a treat. Especially when I drizzled a generous amount of that warm maple syrup on top and watched it cascade down each thick layer of divine, doughy goodness!  However, the highlight of the meal had to be the Duck Croque Madame. I'd even venture out to say that it's the single best thing I've ever had for brunch thus far in Vegas! Topped with a fried egg (now how can that be wrong?!) this French sandwich was packed with mouthwatering deliciousness!  From the perfectly tender morsels of duck that tasted like it was slow roasted for hours, to the melted Gruyere and caramelized onions (reminiscent of a french onion soup), it was like a virtual foodgasm in my mouth!  So there ya have it, pleasant atmosphere, beautiful views, and incredibly good food.  What more could you ask for? That's right, seconds!  Happy Eats!",

FOOD: Benedict - Nautica ($27) . MUST TRY!!! Poached eggs, smoked salmon w chive hollendaise. I am a HUGE efan of benedict and have tried many variations. These poached eggs were cooked to perfection. Served hot with lots of goey yolk with the break of my fork. Adding the combination of the lox and chive hollendaise made it sheer benedict heaven. These came with a side of two delicious hash.

I find white chocolate in general to be way too sweet so I was a little worried but the orange bread they used gave it only a slight hint of orange and offset the white chocolate sweetness. Yum if you have a sweet tooth. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Yp9w4nhUowBU_IS_StFXbQ#NuYS7GqTFrbjD6nGmasrYg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/Yp9w...</a>  The wasabi bloody mary was delish!

Impeccable service, quality food, and presentation.  I shared the granola parfait as a starter. Their housemaid granola was very fresh and crunchy. I know know if they couldn't get the right balance since this was shared, but it felt like it needed little more yogurt. Even the half size parfait filled me up pretty well with all the healthy granola.  Nautica Benedict: Perfection. Their hollandaise was very flavorful and creamy. I'm a huge fan of lox, so this smoked salmon caper mix eggs benedict was a perfect choice.  Brown Butter Apple Pancakes: Fluffy pancakes with cadied pecans and roasted warm apples had the right amount of sweetness. Their portions are generous.  I didn't have reservations, but we were seated right away. I recommend that you make reservations though to be seated in the terrace/balcony area overlooking the gorgeous Wynn pool.  I would come back for a classy brunch here over Mon Ami Gabi at Paris. But just speaking brunch wise, this place is equally nice as Bouchon.",

The seating arrangements are done well, you're not close to your neighbors and can enjoy your meal freely.   Service was efficient and fast. We never had to ask for our drinks to be refilled and they made sure our coffee was filled which was real nice.  The first order was museli. It was made with cinnamon and small strips of apples. You are served with milk, brown sugar, etc. The museli was soft and tasty. The aroma of the cinnamon was enticing. We enjoyed the museli quite a bit.  We ordered the lemon ricotta pancake.....need I say more? It was gooood! If it was a short or full stack, we would have eaten it in a hot second. The hint of lemon was perfect and the ricotta added a very nice texture to the pancake. It was served warm and moist. We didn't even use the butter or the maple syrup.    Next order was their benie! They make their benies 3 ways and we chose the most basic one. It had cured ham, poached egg, and a nice sauce to which we requested be put on the side. I still enjoy Mon Ami Gabi's benie more but Tableau was good.  Overall, Tableau was a good surprise. We will be back for more in the near future!",

After I had it the first time, it's all I could think about for weeks, months, telling everyone they had to go try it for themselves - and with growing anticipation at our upcoming Vegas trip, I couldn't wait to have this ambrosia breakfast of the gods again.  But it was not in the stars for me, as they took it off the menu for some unimaginable reason - the other options were fine, but nothing compares when you've tasted a bit of Heaven.   I really hope they bring it back....Until then, tis better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all.",

When I asked if there were really 3 eggs there they said they were farm raised. I guess farm raised really means mini chickens. Oh and it says it includes juice and coffee; but if you order a latte and something other than orange juice, be prepared to pay and additional $17. Wow! I think all of the ingredients on this cost less than $4#ripoff",

It's too bad the service wasn't up to par, which is why I had to take away a star. When we arrived, we had to wait, so we decided to sit at the bar. The bartender didn't know anything about what drinks they offered or how much anything cost. He ended up saying he never works inside of the restaurant, but that doesn't excuse his lack of knowledge since he was clearly supposed to be the bartender.   Our waitress was no better. She had a very uninviting demeanor to her and a slight attitude. I asked her for a cup of the French Press, and she snapped at me stating that they were out. From that point, the service just went straight downhill.   Luckily, our food was delicious. I have a great appreciation for warm, fluffy pancakes, and the blueberry pancakes here were top notch! I devoured every crumb on my plate. I also had a side of scrambled eggs that were just as fluffy!   I would consider coming here again for the food; however, if I were to have another experience as I did this time, I wouldn't ever return.",

We sat in the back round room - I loved how bright it was with all the natural light coming in the windows. The decor is nice with a lot of cool details. My friend loved the purse stools ( because who wants to put their purse/bag on the ground). I had the Spanish omelette -very good. They're generous with the guacamole - which I liked. The other visit was the breakfast sandwich - this was good, but not great. They brought a large bread basket for another person's meal (and he shared) - so I got to taste their breads/pastries - those were super tasty! Prices are a little high, but worth it for ambiance and great service! I would come back.",

Tiny, tiny portions of mediocre food. We tried almost everything on the menu collectively. Although we didn't have to pay since it was included, the prices are exorbitant if you had to actually pay for it. $28 for 3 eggs, 2 pieces of bacon, and a stale piece of toast? No way. One of the days, they brought my husband's breakfast, he finished eating while I waited for mine, and then 10 min later they asked if we wanted our check! Um, could I get my breakfast first?! Also, we had reservations for every meal, but they never failed to make us wait for at least 10 min.",

    "text": "Be forewarned. Tableau is insanely expensive! I ate here only because I wanted to Yelp a great restaurant that served breakfast. I was full from eating Vegas buffets two days in a row so I wanted something lighter and cheaper. First off, nothing at Tableau is cheap. Secondly, I was also looking for quality, and every Wynn restaurant I've ever eaten at is first rate. (I've been to Red 8, Wing Lei, and Okada.) In terms of quality food and service, you can never go wrong with eating at a Wynn restaurant. That also explains why it's very expensive. If you want the best quality dishes and don't mind the price, then this is the place. Tableau reminds me of a European-style French cafe. They give you top-notch waiter service. When the hostess seats you, you should ask to be seated in the Conservatory because it's a beautiful venue.  Tableau serves breakfast and lunch. They also serve specialty dishes that you won't find at buffets or American chain restaurants. Instead of picking the traditional American breakfast, I decided to try something special. I ordered one fresh oyster. It was small but delicious. I also ordered the Ahi Tuna dish which was served medium rare. The dish looked like it came from a master chef cooking competition. The dish wasn't that filling but at least it was delicious. Tableau also serves you bread which is free of charge. It was a very nice way to complement a meal. All the breads and parmesan crackers were delicious too. This place is very fancy. Only go here if you have money to burn. Then you won't be disappointed.",

We made a reservation for Sunday brunch, and although they sat us a few minutes past our reservation time, they were very apologetic for it.  While we were sitting in the waiting room, the hostess came up at the exact time of our reservation and politely told us they were clearing a table and we should be seated within five minutes.  MENU MUST ORDERS:  Sour cream banana pancakes, duck hash, and greek yogurt with granola!  The sour cream banana pancakes are mouthwatering, the duck hash was incredibly savory, and the sweet honey in the yogurt was a perfect starting appetizer.  I used to compare this restaurant to Bouchon, but I think I have grown to like Tableau more.  You cannot beat the outdoor atmosphere.  Our waiter was attentive throughout the entire meal, checking on us frequently, but never too often.  Even the bus boy was friendly and pleasant.  It was my friend's birthday and they acknowledged the special occasion at the end of our meal with chocolate strawberries!  Great job, Tableau!  Keep up the good work!",

He booked us a lunch reservation at the Tableau having just eaten there for dinner the night before.  He was raving about it, but after we finished lunch there, he reluctantly admitted that it wasn't great and that dinner was much better.  We had clam chowder, which was OK; the bits of celery were unconventional, and quite frankly, not that good.  I had a pepper fennel crusted ahi tuna, where again, the cracked fennel seeds were an unconventional topping for tuna and overwhelmed the tuna's delicate taste.  The restaurant itself is beautiful and elegant, a great place to go for a romantic meal, or to impress a client.  It was also quiet with not much foot traffic - a rarity in LV.  So I'd be willing to go back there, but only to try their dinner menu.",

That being said, this place is excellent.  Tableu breakfast.. $25pp, comes with coffee, your choice of juice (they have exotic juices like watermelon and carrot if you're into that), toast, eggs, bacon, and a basket of mini pastries.  Basket of pastries was good, but cold.. I'm kind of into warm bread, so this was a disappointment. They had some cool things like white chocolate and orange muffin, but none were nearly as good as the pastries at Bouchon. This is where they lose the star.  Atmosphere is fab, and service was quick... almost too quick! We were in and out of there in  under 30 minutes. I guess that's a good thing if you have a conference to catch or something?",

    "text": "One of my all-time favorite breakfast & brunch spots anywhere. It's become a Vegas tradition to grab brunch at Tableau on Sunday morning before leaving town -- brunch here is perhaps what I look forward to most, and is one of the few mandatory stops on the Vegas itinerary.   What particularly stands out is the exemplary service -- the careful attention to detail throughout Wynn's properties finds no exception here. The staff addresses you by name and has a uncanny knack for making you feel as if you're their sole customer.  We order the Tableau Breakfast, which includes the pastry basket -- an assortment of freshly-baked pastries and jams that rival (or surpass) those found at any fine-dining establishment. The meal is filling and delicious and leaves nothing left to be desired. Coffee served is from Intelligentsia (perhaps the best coffee-roaster in LA).   The atmosphere is unique in that you feel just as comfortable in boat shoes and a polo than in swim-trunks and a t-shirt. The tables are white-linen clad, and the space is beautiful and airy, with large windows that face the VIP pool to the east. The walk to the bathroom, through the marble-clad, tower suites lobby, takes you past several, rotating pieces of art from Mr. Wynn's private collection. I spotted a Picasso (authentic) just outside the men's room door. In fact the dining room's decor always reminded me of Picacco's, post 30's, expressionist works  -- not a coincidence, I'm starting to believe.   Tableau (and The Wynn) is a respite from a town that can otherwise be tacky, over-priced and sub-par. I greatly enjoy spending time here and look forward to visiting for years to come.",

When requesting to speak with a manager to ask what happened to the previous recipe they never came to the table. The busser asked if the manager had come and we said no and again we watched the busser go to the manager and let them know we would like to speak with them and still they did my come to the table as they were both too busy setting tables in the restaurant.  Maybe 15 minutes later the server asked if everything was ok as she saw I was not eating my vegan eggs Benedict and asked if everything was alright. They removed the charges for the dish however this is not what I would expect from a 5 star hotel",

Having spent several holidays in Vegas with my girl and her mum, Tableau was always included as one of the restaurants we would have on the must do list while there. After many breakfasts and a couple of lunches, I have concluded that this establishment deserves the five stars I have rated it. Not once have we ever been disappointed. While playing at Wynn, it was always my job to find somewhere to get the girls a great meal. And with the help of Yelp, we were led here to be treated to exquisite service and truly awesome dining. From the fabulous breakfasts, to the creative weekend brunches, every meal left us wanting more. Our last time here had us enjoying the brunch. Girl had a great French toast with fresh fruit and succulent sausage.  The French toast were thick slices of custardy delight, golden brown and topped with fresh seasonal mixed fruit, house made juicy sausage made the dish savory and delish. I enjoyed an eggs Benedict special made with beef tenderloin and blue crab. Omg, mouth watering and presented with perfection. It was to much to behold until I took my first bite. Juicy and cooked perfectly, over poached eggs, and a decadent hollandaise sauce. Again awesome. We enjoyed a couple of the mixed drink specials suggested to us and again were wowed. They completed our meals greatly to our delight. After lunch we sat with hot delicious cups of coffee to settle us before we returned to game. I can't say more to conclude this review except to suggest you try Tableau if your in Vegas and at the fabulous Wynn. Their menu will leave you lost for choice. Bon appetite .",

My lovely significant other ordered the Duck something something.. (only on on the breakfast menu. It was original and totally different. Potatoes, duck, mushrooms and egg all made into one tasty dish. I liked that alot and was more suited to the price and establishment. Also tried a strawberry smoothie and it was very tasty.

    "text": "A beautiful restaurant overlooking the pool at the Wynn hotel. My cousins, and aunts who were visiting from Canada wanted to check it out as the menu looked amazing. We had a large party of 10 people and were seated promptly.   I ordered the Vegetarian Orecchiette which was just the right size and the taste was fabulous. The pasta was done perfectly as well. Definitely something I would order again.  Some of the other items we also ordered were the Lobster & Shrimp Frittata, Kabocha Squash Soup, Duck Hash & Eggs and the Smoked Salmon Benedict. The soup was a hit .. nice flavor and just the right amount of creaminess. The Benedict was the only thing that was not good. The slices of Salmon were too thick and the sauce was tasteless.   The reason for the three stars is the service, ,or shall I say the \"lack of service\" our waiter was very prompt in taking our drink order (which consisted of mostly coffees and teas) and it took about 20 minutes for the order to be delivered. Once we had the drinks, no one offered or came by with refills. Our water glasses were empty by the time we got our food and were never refilled either.  I was perplexed by this as the reviews I had read have raved about the service .. but when the check came it became very clear to me. Tableau automatically adds the Gratuity to large parties. So I am guessing that the server knew he'd get a certain amount regardless of what type of service he gave. This is not acceptable especially since the menu is a bit on the pricey side and the restaurant is categorized on the Wynn website as \"Fine Dining.\"",

Unfortunately, the dishes (acai booster, tableau breakfast and benedict) were only good overall, and mediocre for the price.  The restaurant has a very posh nyc feel, but doesn't actually have a particularly nice view.   The macaroons at the end were a positive touch and the service was great but not a place to crave for in the future.",

Both meats were flavorful, melt in your mouth, delicious. Additionally we had a few choice cocktails which were refreshing, though a little light on alcohol content. Their bread selection was very interesting with no plain bread but an assortment of cheese, gingerbread, and fig to choose from. We ended with a complimentary macaroon.   This was an exceptional lunch, but did run us about $100 total. I would highly recommend Tableau for a fantastic lunch (and an expected brunch just as good), but just realize you are at the Wynn and are paying for the service, quality, and ambiance.",

And if you like a waiter coming over to your table right after you sit down, telling him your not ready to order and then never seeing him again.  Then RUN, don't walk to Tableau. This is your place because it sure isn't mine.  PS we left, so I don't know if he ever came back to the table.  Second disappointing dining experience here at the Wynn and we arrived last night.",

It's just a fail and the chefs need to come up with a different approach to it because it's am embarrassment to such a prestigious hotel in Vegas.  As a local vegan, I know it can be done in a much more tasty way.  If you are vegan please head elsewhere for a vegan kick for breakfast such as Vegenation. They have an amazing French toast, as well as chickn and waffles.  The service at Tableau was great. The hosts were friendly. Our server, Vanessa, was hospitable and genuine. She was the only black server I saw. I like businesses that empower themselves by diversifying the staff.  Back to Vanessa, she was accommodating when I told her my distaste for the vegan eggs benedict. She also brought out a dessert for my Birthday. Thanks again!",

First of all, there are both indoor and outdoor options- if you sit outdoors on a nice day (like we did) you are underneath huge umbrellas behind the pool. The inside atmosphere seems nice too, just a little more quiet.  Second of all, the food is really good. We had the duck hash and the french toast. The duck hash was really interesting because I am used to a poached egg with hollandaise and this was a cooked egg with a roasted tomato sauce. There is a generous portion of duck too. Really delicious. The french toast is one of the best I've had-- there are bits of candied orange in there which is a nice touch, but didn't taste too much of the white chocolate. But most importantly, the texture is spot on: crunchy on outside and soft and spongy on the inside.  Don't forget their house bread-- don't get the cornbread (too dry); instead, get the bacon and the poppyseed. Yum.  Service was great. I'll be back.",

    "text": "Tableau provides a beautiful outdoor dining experience.   The orange juice is freshly squeezed and extremely fresh and delicious. Unfortunately it's $7 for a small juice glass which is outrageous but you're in Vegas so...  We both got bananas foster French toast. My Mom loved it. I didn't care for it. I didn't like the bread they used. It tasted like banana bread...almost cakey. I prefer just a regular bread if you are going to have such sweet toppings. I wouldn't order it again. In the past I've had the bananas foster French toast from Terrace Point Cafe which was much better than here. I noticed on this visit that Tableau had it and Terrace Point did not. Their version was better! My Mom also got a side of bacon which she requested be crispy. She really enjoyed it. We got a croissant which was amazing! If I could, I would eat one a day for the rest of my life!   Multiple people waited on us throughout our dining experience. At least 4, maybe 5. It doesn't matter so much as long as you are being well taken care of but it is difficult to build a bond with your person and it's confusing come tip time because to me it seems more like a buffet restaurant tip than normal table service.   The only thing that takes away from outdoor dining here is the fact that birds will visit the empty tables and poke around. I feel like since the staff know this happens, they should be clearing the tables much quicker than they do. If the tables were cleared quicker, the birds wouldn't have anything to dine on. We saw some birds take a pastry and fly away. It bothered my Mom much more than it bothered me but it definitely isn't something that people want to see happening at a fancy, expensive breakfast.",

Last weekend we've had brunch and everything was pretty awful. My dish was just not-all-that, the server didn't reach our table for 20 minutes after she served the food so I couldn't tell her I want to return my dish and get a different one, and I was so damn thirsty! And no one came with water. Even once we've asked, twice, she had a difficult time coming over at the same time and sent someone (even though she was already holding the water pitcher...)   Bottom line - eh. Expensive and last time I felt that not for a good reason.",

My husband and I both ordered the Benedict's, all aspects were tasty EXCEPT only 1 of our 4 combined poached eggs were actually cooked properly and not over cooked. As a place that prides themselves on Benedict's and egg quality this was unacceptable to me. I will not be coming back here or recommending to family and friends who are vacationing here.",

Absolutely perfect.  The vanilla mixed berries were the perfect accompaniment.   My partner in crime had the salmon eggs Benedict and I honestly can't say which one was better.  Their twist on Benedict is unique and delicious.  There was no run of the mill English muffin or biscuit.  I'm not even sure what it was, brioche maybe? No matter, it was excellent as was the smoke in the salmon and the Hollaindaise itself.   I will make a point to have breakfast here EVERY time I come to Vegas.",

    "text": "*** TABLEAU IS LOCATED AT THE WYNN IN THE MOST UNSPOTTABLE PLACE NEAR THE ELEVATORS ***   I came to Tableau for a brunch with my friend, knowing how beautiful the dining area was, with top service and amazing food.   THE STAFF -  Knowing the Wynn is one of the most popular Hotels in Las Vegas, with the extensive reputable five star service, I just had to come here thinking the restaurant would be no different.  I think the security guards that helped me and my friend actually find this restaurant were more accommodating than the staff that worked here.  Although we did make reservations, we still had to wait about 15 minutes for a table, even though half the dining room was empty.  THE FOOD -  I ordered Tableau's parfait for starters but I said no peanuts because I'm highly allergic to peanuts; what do you know? There's a cashew in my parfait! Last time I checked, a cashew was a peanut. I didn't send it back because my friend wanted to eat it, but there is a lack in communication that I do not tolerate.   My entree, I ordered the Tableau Breakfast, since nothing else was very appetizing to me on their menu. I asked for eggs over medium and my eggs were runnier than the Nile River, it was like soup and I just couldn't eat it. Big let down.  The Pastry basket that came with my meal was pretty cool, but it lacked anything I liked.  I think I only enjoyed the tea I had, which came in a cute little pyramid package! Very delicious tea!  A side note: You have to be dressed well to be seated; meaning, shirts are mandatory and you can't wear a swim suit without a cover-up.",

The terrace has a wonderful view and also opens up to the pool. Amazing atmosphere. The immediately offered vegan, vegetarian, and gluten free menus which I found very impressive. I had the Honey Mustard Grilled Chicken Sandwich--and it was to die for!! The chicken was grilled and super juicy, the brioche bun was extra soft and buttery, the honey mustard was perfect! It didn't hurt that it was also topped with avocado and bacon! It came with a side of homemade potato chips which didn't last long, I devoured every last one. Highly reccomend for lunch. Had the mini coconut raspberry cake for dessert and it was creamy, smooth, and perfectly portioned for one. Will definitely be coming back to try the breakfast!",

The food overall was not bad, definitely pretty standard brunch. That being said, the food tasted no more spectacular than that from my favorite local breakfast diner. I understand that breakfast food is difficult to make unique but I was definitely disappointed.  We got two dishes: the eggs benedict and the vegan benedict. The regular eggs benedict was not very good. They weirdly used sandwich ham - a big no no to me. The bread was too thin and could not hold up to the sauce and egg. The vegan benedict was better. I had wished the smoked tofu actually tasted smoky. The vegan benedict was far from what I'd call a benedict but was definitely tasty. Copy cat vegan benedict is not hard to find so if that's what you're looking for, go somewhere else. There also was no sort of garnish and decorations to make the dishes look nice.  The rest of the menu is standard with little creativity. Other dishes include oatmeal, acai bowls, omelets and Continental spreads. I was definitely looking for something standout.  I was also somewhat disappointed in service for a Wynn restaurant. We made a reservation for 10:30am and were not seated until 11. The waiter was not very attentive to us either: no check ins or water refills. We even had issues flagging him down for the check.  The other Wynn restaurants are spectacular and Tableau definitely was a let down.",

I found out About Tableau after some research and I hesitated several times because it just looked like the kind of place that would be so snooty. Here's where you say \"don't judge a book by its cover.\"  We had 2 small children with us and that's always a challenge when dining out especially when you like to eat good food in a nice atmosphere. Everyone starting with the maitre d was soo unbelievable kind to us. She was so courteous, polite and friendly. I wish I remembered her name. Just a beautiful girl and I did not detect any phoniness from her either. They even helped us take our big double stroller and store it.   Luckily our children are used to dining out so they are generally pretty well behaved. Some people will always give you the side eye but most of the other parties seated near us were cheerful and pretty interested in engaging our children.   The space is so stunning and elegant. Reminds me of a beautiful tea parlor you would take an English high tea from. The food was amazing. The little small pastries and homemade jams and jellies, my banana  sour cream pancakes were amongst some of the best I've ever had.   The cutest thing was the little chair they set beside you to seat your handbag. My little blue Chanel was happy to have her own chair.   I love love love this place and I hope they never change their customer service. I will definitely return again!",

We order a strawberry smoothie hoping to cool own down, but it came out creamy and room temperature. Not refreshing at all!  I ordered the soft shell crab sandwich and my gf ordered the tuna. It sandwich was pretty good, but the flavors did not blow me away. Her tuna was only a few pieces of nicely cooked tuna with some green sauce and caviar on top. Her did was also did not taste amazing for such a small portion.   Overall, the ambiance is nice, but their drink was warm and their lunch food was just average.",

I think it was a pear ginger or something i cant seem to remember.   The avacado salad was just ok.  It probably wont stay on the menu for long.  It gets crowded for breakfast so make reservations!",

However, we've been to Tableau several times over the past few months and it falls way short of what we expect from the Wynn.   Atmosphere - Nice, bright, comfortable  Service - Our last two experiences were terrible. Servers had odd personalities, messed up our orders, didn't come back to check on us, etc. Similar experience twice in a row with two different servers.   Food - Very hit or miss. There are a few items on the menu which are very good (Burger is one of them). However, other items are mediocre at best. I had the duck confit salad on my most recent visit and the duck tasted like it had been sitting out for 3 days, chewy and no flavor. The entire salad was bland and tasteless. Also, they have very few healthy items on the menu. We spend most of our time in Vegas over indulging so it's nice to have a healthy option when it comes time to detox.   Very disappointed and hope they bring this place up to Wynn standards in the near future. Won't be back anytime soon...",

    "text": "Stopped here for Sunday brunch with the group I was travelling with (all 7 of us) and was really pleased with the vegetarian selection--to the point where I was torn between more than two things that I wanted to order. (If you're not a vegan or vegetarian, or you don't have a food allergy, you probably don't understand how profound that is, so just take my word for it. It's amazing.) Thank you, Mr. Wynn, for making sure your establishments' restaurants have vegetarian options!  I eventually settled on the vegan \"eggs\" benedict--in truth a scrambled tofu served on a circle of probably white toast (an approximation of an English muffin without any dairy products) topped with a really tasty yellow tomato \"hollandaise\" sauce. I typically don't like tomato, but it was good sauce :) I had gone with the benedict because as someone with an egg allergy, it's something I've never really had and may never have the opportunity to have again. I also had the side of marble potatoes, which was good, but a little more mundane than vegan \"eggs.\" Mr. Piano had a real eggs benedict, which I mostly recall for the fact that I was inexplicably happy about the fact that the presentation for the real eggs benedict looked really, really similar to the presentation on the vegan version. I still don't know why it tickles me, but it does. Maybe because the parallel presentation is cute. I can't recall what the others had, but there wasn't much of anything left by the end, so it was probably pretty good. The only food item we might have had any problem with was actually a beverage--the coffee came out in a French press (we'd gotten a small pot to split between the three of us who wanted some) and had decidedly not been allowed to steep long enough. The first pour was kind of weak, and knowing that the grounds would still be partially in contact with the liquid while the pot sat, I suggested that we wait a bit and then try again, which worked a bit better than I thought. (I am more of a tea than coffee connoisseur, if I can be called either, but I had enough information to make a guess and got lucky.)  The setting is quite lovely--you can see into the courtyard and I believe the pool from the windows, and the chairs look hand-painted with their designs. It's kind of like what I imagine a little girl's tea party with dolls looks like in her head or would look like if she re-envisioned it in adulthood :) It's cute! The servers were also really friendly and accommodating--when they brought out the little treats at the end, the server suddenly remembered that I had mentioned my egg allergy and brought me out a chocolate covered strawberry since I couldn't have the little pastry treat :)  It is, again, a bit pricey (like all things in Vegas), but I'd probably brunch at Tableau again in a heartbeat if I even return to Vegas and have the opportunity!",

One being the mini table for my girl to put her purse down.  We ordered the oysters, pancakes and pastrami skillet.  All dishes were great and the smoothie of the day was amazing. Great experience overall, definitely recommended for brunch and I can't wait to go back during my next Vegas trip.  Thank you tableau for making this grumpy hungry man leave happy!",

The server didn't come until we asked for one to be called (after at least 15 minutes of sitting around), at which time an \"assistant\" came to take our drink orders. My bf asked for hot water and he came back with a kettle of hot water without a cup, perhaps expecting my bf to poor hot water down his throat.  We had to wait some more for our actual server to finally come to attend to our table.  We never saw him again after he took our orders.  We had to seek another server because our server was nowhere to be seen. Food was overpriced for what we got. I expected better service for the price we paid for the food.  I receive better service from a local Denny's.  Won't be going back.",

It was candy for breakfast! My friends who got the omelette, the peach pancakes, and that crazy looking edible duck pot pie in a pie shell thing all loved their food.  Service was also very attentive...one of the servers said that since they were in the Wynn Tower restaurant, some people even ordered  \"off-menu\" and they sometimes have to make \"it\" happen to deliver what they wanted.  Apparently, if you were a balla or high rolla or whatever the spelling, it's likely you may be at Tableau for a morning breakfast or early lunch.  This place was also very quiet as the dining room was small so a refreshing change from yelling across the table from other casino cafes where the noise level is still at 8/10.  They even have foot stools for the ladies at each table so they can rest their feet!  Damn that is pretty posh.  Would I ever come back?  Would it mean I'd have a chance of glancing and dining in the same room of a famous celeb or two?  Then hell yes, count me in!",

Oh and did I mention beautiful presentation?? (see picture)  They also did the most amazing thing and made sure that there were peaches between each layer of pancake! =)  That made my day. Side of bacon was also 3 slices.  Prepared to perfect crispiness.  Scrumptious breakfast and LOVED every bite.  But total came out to ~$75.

    "text": "It was about a week before and we hadn't made plans for Easter brunch. I yelped the top list of brunch spots in town and went down the list to see if I could get a reservation. All of the major spots were already booked. So, I changed my approach and went to the open table website and looked for restaurants that still had open seats. This is actually a great way of booking a restaurant during a busy weekend. It worked out well and I will do this again. Tableau had good reviews on yelp (which is my go to source) so I booked it. The restaurant is located near the tower suites in the Wynn. The decor in the tower suites area is very well done. It is airy and opulent with light marble and soft green tones. Definitely a ladies who lunch kind of vibe. The restaurant was actually less impressive in comparison. The design on the back of the chairs is horrible.   Food:  We started off by sharing a large chocolate croissant which was just okay. It had been coated with butter which gave the pastry a greasy look. The texture was flaky and served warmed. The temperature was good but I usually like my croissants a bit more doughy.  I had the Spanish 3 egg omelet. It was very flavorful. I would recommend it. The only thing I would say is that the chorizo is more like a spicy ham that chorizo. But still, good. My husband ordered the filet and eggs. His dish was basic. There was no sauce or dressing given with the steak. The meat was over-salted and cut did not seem like a True filet cut.  Highlight: All in all it was a good experience. I'm glad we checked it out. But, there are so many other places to check out at the Wynn that we'll try somewhere else next time. We are new to the area and the best part of the brunch was that we discovered the Wynn hotel. The garden was decorated with an all flower carrousel. It was dreamy.",

Well, I don't see an additional page at the end of the menu, and I'm not sure what else you'd consider a duck entree (not to mention that both plates were ordered from the entree section).  Before we left, he even came over and checked how much tip we'd left him!  I thought we were at Wynn, not some \"hole in the wall\" place?!  The duck entree and the white chocolate orange French toast were tasty, but definitely nothing out of the ordinary or worthy of their prices. The duck was a bit dry, but thankfully the egg was nice and moist, which masked some of the dryness underneath.  And, like one of the other reviewer mentioned, our taste buds didn't quite pick up the white chocolate part.  Maybe we were spoiled coming from NYC. Meh.  Not planning on coming back.",

The only thing I was disappointed with was that it was my daughter's birthday and the waitress said that they usually have a little dessert that they put a candle in - but since it was Valentines Day they had a special Valentine's dessert and asked if I'd like them to put the candle in that instead - so I agreed - under the assumption that this was a complimentary item...it wasn't...it was $12 for something we wouldn't have ordered.

There were maybe 1/4 of the tables full inside and out.   All my mom really wanted for her birthday was a nice steak.  What we ended up with was some tough stripp steak.   My mom and I both just wanted simply a steak, veggies and potatoes.  While it looked great - it did not meet our expetations.  The potato cakes were all right, seems that they come in frozen, seriously.   They serve a nice yeast roll here, but they put it in a popover pan which is totally unattractive.  I'd rather a roll on a plate in this case.  The orange frenchtoast with macadamia butter was acceptable.  All in all, there were some scallops on the menu I think I would rather have had and I dont even like scallops.  Regardless of what we did or didnt order, no matter what menu we used - EVERYONE in the kitchen should be able to pick a steak.  Our steaks differed by about 3oz between mine and my momma's.",

    "text": "Came here for a late breakfast/brunch because I heard they serve one heck of a French Toast!! Besides, once in a while I need to have a gourmet breakfast fix! Since this place sat in the Regal \"Wynn Casino\", I automatically had high expectations. I think its only fair..  Well, it wasn't your neighborhood Denny's, that's for sure.. Another Extravagant Restaurant clearly evident by the Fine furniture, detail in its structure and the Staffs pleasant and proper demeanor that ran it.   What I devoured Next to the window just a few feet away from the pool:  House-made Elk Sausage & Eggs: This caught my eye since \"Elk\" isn't the standard breakfast fare I'm used to.. I asked the server if it was \"gamey\" and she said not really and then sold me on it. Well, it came on a neat little plate and looked like a sausage patty.. It was gamey enough for me and kinda dry.. I didn't like it. The hollandaise was good and the potaotes as well (only thing, I could of counted how many nickel sized potato slices there were on the plate!). I told myself if i'm gonna go for something unusual like this, I might as well try it served at a place like this?! Still didn't like it..  White Chocolate & Orange French Toast: This totally 360'd my outlook of this place, I mean from pretty bad to Wow!! Besides that it looked like a half order dish, This was so sO SO Breathtaking!!! Although, much different from the typical comforting traditional french toast.. In the gourmet world, this thing was Brilliant! I had to desperately hold in my inner thoughts racing of joy cause I didn't want to look like a fool!! If you like sophisticated sweet and extra succulent french toast then you don't have to think twice on this one..   Signature Tableau Potatoes: looked like chicken nuggets.. The crust just lightly breaded, potato just the right softness and seasoning.. Worthy of its name! Dipped in their \"house-made ketchup\".. Potato lovers, enjoy!  House-made Chicken-Apple Sausages: Juicy, Tasty and just hints of flavors unleashed through every bite! This with their ketchup and Potatoes = little meal itself!  Expected Much and Got Most of what I expected especially from the french toast, just not the Elk.. Service was Top of its Class! Value: Most gourmet spots never seem to be worth the quadruple price tag but I think its understandable for the Occasional experience and those of you who have curious taste buds, that make it worth while (But you Might not want to dine at places like this, when you're super hungry.. Like how I was!). A Staggering $70 including 20+% tip (and just regular water to drink) for my solo breakfast getaway.. I have No Regrets! However, I think all thats needed is an order of French Toast (maybe 2 for me) and your Good to Go!",

For the main, my hubby had the flank steak and I had roasted chicken. He liked his, but I didn't have 1 bite of my dry, flavorless chicken. Ick.

Tableau doesn't often get talked about past breakfast which is why I was intrigued to dine here for dinner. Upon arrival I was seated in there main dining room which is a very small and intimate dining room. The windows were wide open and the nice nightly breeze was coming in. Once seated the bread came. This was much different from the ordinary bread basket. It featured a nice dinner roll in a small little pot. Its your ordinary dinner roll but reminded much of the ones we use to have at dinner growing up!  I went with the tasting menu but had to stop half way because just like Le Cirque the portions are way to big which would be the only downfall in this restaurant even though some may like the large portions I'm a little guy and can only hold so much before I have to throw in the flag. The amuse was fried Cod, much like Bouchon Bistros Beignets de Brandade de Morue, over a bed of balsamic seasoned spinach. I found it to be much better than Bouchons version. It was full of Cod which was the ingredient that stood out the most because had a nice light texture that I found to be a nice little starter and the balsamic added a nice rich dark complex of sweetness to it!  The first dish was the dish everyone was talking about. The Dungeness Crab Ravioli which featured a lemon emulsion flavor. WOW this dish was FULL of fresh and perfectly cooked Crab with a Delicious burst of lemon flavor. I loved the dish and I can see why everyone talks about it.   Next up was the Seared Hudson Valley Foie Gras with glazed black mission figs, upland cress salad and red currant gastric. Now the foie gras was on top of a piece of toast that at first I found to be unnecessary but I put a little foie gras and fig on top just to try it out and It was perfect! I love figs and these were sublime. It doesn't get any better than Hudson Valley foie gras either! The red currant added a nice sweet jelly type taste to the figs. Overall a great dish with flavors that paired very well with each other.  Next was the Grilled Free Range Duck Breast with sweet potato-pecan hash, stewed stone fruits, and wild flower honey just. This was my first time having duck. It was cooked medium and had a good texture without being to gamy. I LOVE sweet potato's and found the hash to be absolutely delish! The stone fruits and honey just added just amount of sweetness to the duck and the flavors all popped out and you could taste each and everyone of them in every bite! But as you can tell this is no tasting menu sized portion which left me to stop here. The portions are large for a tasting menu.  Of course I couldn't leave without desert. I was presented with a desert trio. A blueberry shortbread sandwich that was to die for. So light and creamy!! My mouth melts when I think about it. A strawberry milkshake. Tasted like one of my protein shakes I drink which I do not like. Last but not least peach cobbler that was slightly warm with the ice cream slowly melting on top and tasted FABULOUS!  Overall this was a great meal. I was seated next to a group of rich older foodies that I overheard talking how this is one of there favorite restaurants! I would agree. If they made there tasting menu portions much smaller I think this place could get a Michelin Star in the future because the Chef is very talented and the service was top class! They give the ladies a little stool for there purse which I'm sure all the ladies out there would appreciate. The tasting menu features some of the best ingredients and is a bargain compared to some other places at the Wynn. This is a place I would return to in a heartbeat!",

    "text": "We have been to Vegas several different times, and had never eaten breakfast anywhere until Tableau. It was my husband's bday and he really wanted to go somewhere for a nice breakfast. Since we were staying at Encore we made the short walk over to Tableau and were seated pretty much immediately in the atrium section.   I ordered the omelet and fresh berries and he had elk sausage and eggs. I can't say anything bad about my plate...it was delicious, however, after my hubby took a couple bites out of his he noticed his eggs were cold and the potatoes were not all done, yet the sausage was warm. He told the server right away and he took his dish back to the kitchen. Our server came back and apologized and informed us that the executive chef himself was going to remake the dish and it would be out shortly.   Well I continued on with my omelet and after a few minutes the server brought out a new elk sausage and eggs. After already consuming about half of this one my hubby realized that the potatoes were still not done. He was really upset b/c he was really excited about breakfast, and it just seemed as though they just couldn't get his dish right.   We also noticed they never brought out his orange juice that he ordered and brought that to the waiter's attention. He apologized again and brought us out not only an orange juice, but Apple juice and a grapefruit juice to try. He also brought us out a complimentary pastry basket to try and make up for everything. You could tell he was genuinely sorry about messing up lee's order and the dishes not coming out right!   For my breakfast I would give this place a 4 star, however, for the hubby's and especially since it was his bday I can only let them get away with 3 stars.  Sorry Tableau...I wish you could have made a better impression with us! . Also, if we would have had a better breakfast experience with you it may have motivated us to make it up for more breakfast's in the future, but I think we'll keep passing for now!",

    "text": "Not closed and impressive. From what I could tell Tableau is open for Breakfast and Lunch only. The balcony sits adjacent to one of several of Wynn's pools and on a warm late spring morning was a great place to enjoy breakfast. The service was outstanding and incredibly attentive. Expected but always nice when it is delivered. Classic breakfast menu with eggs, waffles, pancakes, hash, potatoes etc..... All however with a little love and a twist. I had the Blueberry, Ricotta pancakes with a chicken apple sausage and my dining partner the strawberry waffles with a side of the potato hash. All were cooked to perfection and to our enjoyment. I think the only annoyance was a slight attitude at my request for a pot of green tea with a glass of ice. I like fresh iced tea and they didn't offer green, which in today's day of healthy eating still surprises me that so many places do not.   Will gladly bring other clients and friends back on my next trip.",
