    "text": "Ugh. I could deal with these high priced sushi restaurants if the sushi actually was GOOD, but it NEVER is.  Not one!  This is your typical trendy sushi place with extremely high priced rolls that are the size of a quarter.  Not even exaggerating. There isn't even enough room inside the roll to fit anything so it just tasted like rice.    We wanted cocktails too but every single cocktail was $18.  Seriously? I've had plenty of cocktails in vegas and Ive never paid that much for one -- $13-$16 seems to be average, but $18 a glass is just too much. I opted for plum wine instead, which was yummy but still $13 for the glass.  My friend had a bento box, she wasn't too impressed.  Overall it came out to around $65 for one drink, two small entrees, for LUNCH.  It was basically a snack and none of it was any good.  Waste of money.  If you want sushi in Mandalay bay try Mizuya instead which is in the casino just about 20 feet away from this place.  You can order any cocktails you want for a reasonable price and the sushi rolls are larger and a lot more tasty.",

    "text": "A newly opened sushi restaurant inside the Mandalay Bay is a perfect option for dinner before heading over to Light Nightclub. You can grab a cocktail or a light meal.  There is plentiful seating inside with a few tables outside the restaurant to look at the on goers.  There is also seating at the bar where you can see the sushi chefs prepare the fresh hand rolls.  The rock shrimp is one of my favorites, as well as the yellowtail sashimi. Both are appetizers that can be shared with another person. The shrimp came out hot and is crunchy and flavorful. The sashimi is a bit spicy with the sauce but it is a nice cut and very soft.  The price is a bit on the high end for sushi, but it tastes fresh and made to order. I'd recommend this restaurant to a group of girls for a night out or a date night.",

We started off with the spicy miso soup and it has a nice kick. Very tasty from the start. The Yellowtail Serrano was delicious and we quickly received the eggplant dish. I normally don't try eggplant dishes but this one was recommended to us so we gave it a shot. I'm so glad we did. We tried the omakase sushi and sashimi platter. Definitely get this if you want to try all signature fish. Overall, I loved it and will be back very soon.",

We asked the waitress abt it and she was quick to blame others (well i put it in in order!) and never followed up, apologized, explained, or made any effort to show that she cared. Never asked how the food was or how the drinks tasted. Overpriced and underwhelming. Food was average- nothing to write home about.

The \"Crispy Rice\" appetizer is very good...just bite the bullet on the price at $21...I've not had anything like it.  We also ordered three sushi rolls (spicy tuna, yellowtail and spicy salmon), the green beans side and vegetable tempura.  I would pass on the tempura...not a lot of flavor and you don't get much given the cost.",

Perfect suggestions with eloquent descriptions and timely service all night. We enjoyed the AB Tuna Tartare, Whitefish Carpaccio, Kobe Tataki and Rock Shrimp Tempura as shared appetizers. No one favorite on the table, just delicious flavors! Enjoyed the Kumikaze and Kumi Mari rolls as well. Both had some very unique flavors that you won't find at a generic sushi house. The Sake-Tumi and Kumi Bomb were favorites of the drinks at the table while the Paloma and Root of Sin were the strongest on the table. Overall, it was a fantastic night out with some good friends! I highly recommend Kumi if you are looking for a good time and great food!",

The service did not match the food. They gave us one refill on our coke and we had to ask for that. It was early so they were not busy. The bill was over 300 dollars and we do not drink and that was for my wife and I. Like I said very pricey. I waited for over 20 minutes to get the check after dinner. I am glad the show we were going to was a late show. The spider roll was just okay, but the Blue Fin Belly Sasha mi was good. We had a fillet Mignon dish and it was awesome, small for 48 dollars though. 3 stars because of drink refills, price and slow check service.",

We had food come out before sake, kinda weird. We let our waiter know we had reservations for MJ and were on a time limit. Despite this, it was slow. They held onto our sake as it was chilled. I understand the concept of the restuarant and they bring the food out as it's ready, but we had to ask for the sake 4 times. We tried to order food from our waiter, but he was no where to be found. When we found him, we told him what we wanted. When that food never came, and we had to leave, he said we ordered it from someone else- lie.  It sucked because they automatically charged the tip.  The food itself was mediocre. My meat eater friends said the kobe tacos were meh. I had the ahi tuna starter as a main and it was pretty good, cute presentation. Overall, it wasn't that great.",

    "text": "On my most recent trip to Vegas to celebrate my cousin's 21st birthday my entire party and I had the pleasure of eating here. This upscale sushi restaurant is the latest addition to the Mandalay Bay fine dining scene, which opened July 2013.  CONCEPT: Kumi is a collaboration between the Light Group and executive chef Akira Back (Yellowtail Japanese Restaurant & Lounge @ Bellagio). The restaurant's focus is Japanese sushi with a Korean twist, reflecting the chef's Korean background.   VENUE: As stated earlier the restaurant is located on the Mandalay fine dining strip near STRIPSTEAK and Red Square. If you look at the floor you'll see the names of fish written in hiragana. The entrance seems very reminiscent of an entrance to a ryokan and is very inviting. Tables near the entrance allow you to people watch. The lights and back wall created an image of sakura blooming in the springtime.  SERVICE: The server was attentive and very knowledgeable about the menu. All his menu picks ended up being loved by all. Towards the end it took a little while to flag him down to get the last order of sushi.  FOOD/DRINK: With the exception of the Dragon Bowl, for a party of 7 two orders of each of the following menu items were needed as one order wouldn't be enough for each person to try. Usually a serving can feed 2-4 people depending on what else is ordered. This is ultimately the only real con of this place: one signature sushi entree isn't going to be enough to feed one person. Those $$$$ in the listing are there for a reason; this is one of the most extravagant places I've eaten in Vegas.   1. Dragon Bowl: their signature bowl drink normally meant for at least 2 people. Each person was able to have several sips. The bowl had one whole lemon garnish and two pineapple leaves as decor. Drink had at the very least pineapple and a good quality rum.   2. Rock Shrimp Tempura (Sriracha Ranch, Micro Celery) [$16]: When I tasted this I was immediately reminded of Spanish patatas bravas as the sriracha ranch tasted EXACTLY like brava sauce and the tempura was crunchy yet light. I could taste the shrimp though the sriracha ranch flavor was strong. This is a very addicting appetizer and I could have easily eaten a bowl to myself.   3. Hot Mess (Crab, Sashimi Poke, Screaming O Sauce) [$20]: The sauce was akin to a spicy teriyaki sauce but I could still taste the crab and the poke. The dish itself was spicy, but the sushi can still linger in the mouth and not burn your tongue.   4. Pop Rockin' (Spicy Tuna, Crab, Salmon, Avocado, Pop Rocks) [$19]: This sushi is an example of an unusual ingredient in a dish (the Pop Rocks) that works VERY well and makes the dish stand out. The sweet Pop Rocks definitely add to the avocado and the spicy tuna/salmon. Flavor combination was just perfect.  5. Fireball (Crab, Cucumber, XXX Hot Kimchee Sauce) [$19]: Least favorite of the sushi but still quite delicious. Crab was soft and the cucumber had a texture very similar to pasta (which is why any \"pasta\" dish under 500 calories usually is just cucumber), but like my cousin's friend said, was one-dimensional. It was also the spiciest of all the dishes.  6. Crispy Pork Belly (Brussels Coleslaw) [$17]: As everyone was still hungry for at least one more roll my cousin's friend and I wanted to try a non-seafood sushi option. The pork belly was crispy and the sweet sauces at the top and bottom balanced the meat. This is another example of a perfect flavor combination and along with the Pop Rockin', my other favorite sushi dish.  My cousin had a birthday dessert dish that had mochi ice cream pieces, one for each person. Mochi was soft and fresh and the ice cream was a nice sweet touch to end several sushi courses.   Considering I am a person that normally doesn't go out of the way to eat sushi and really doesn't like cheap sushi places, this was certainly one of the best meals I've had this year, one of the best meals I've ever had in Vegas and if I were to rank my top 10 dining experiences, this would certainly be in one of the spots. I look forward to the next opportunity dining here again.",

We were staying at the Four Seasons , connected to Mandalay Bay.. we were referred by the hotel the one of the best restaurants KUMI ..I have been an event planner and caterer in Beverly Hills for the last 25years , have traveled all over the world . This restaurant was by far the worst service I have ever received .  We were immediately told if we order all at once , it would be easier for the kitchen, or our food might come out late.. I did not know exactly what that meant, but we took his advise.  We ordered our cocktails and about 3 seconds later ALL our food came out . Our table then turned into a Buffett. We asked to please slow down so we could enjoy the food , talk ,have a few cocktails and enjoy our dining experience.. well , that was the last we saw of our waiter Michael. We asked to see him but was told he was busy.. we did not receive another cocktail , no water, we wanted additional items could not order , and we were missing two items from original order.  After waiting 20 minutes for a waiter we decided to ask anyone ,,for our check. We said this was the worst service I have ever experienced.  Our birthday celebration lasted I hour 20 minutes ,. With  1 cocktail and food thrown at us.  No dessert menu was offered and no apology..  I asked to speak to the manger , she was very nice . Offered us a free cocktail.. lol. What a joke. The damage was done.  Come back for a cocktail.  You have got to be kidding.  The bill came to around $300.00. I did something I have never done in 30 years .  I DID NOT leave a tip.   Being in the service industry, tips are the life line of a waiter , I generally over tip.  The food was very good , we would have love to try other dishes, had a few more cocktails and of course a birthday desert . Unfortunately Michael was nowhere to be found to order..if you are looking for a wham ,bam , thank you ma'am.. this is the place to go .  VERY FAST update... This afternoon the General Manger Yosi. Not sure of the spelling , track me down at the Four Seasons.  He was amazing as a General manger should be .. He offered an apology ,  invited me back and picked up my check from last night.  As a company owner we all make mistakes , it is how you handle it that counts.  the GM handled this like a True professional.. Thank you , we will be back .. as I did mention , the food was fabulous.  We just wanted more and could not get it.. GREAT GENERAL MANAGER .. very professional..",

    "text": "This is a beautiful restaurant with excellent service. We did the chefs menu and some items were good while others not so much. I felt the cooked meats and chicken were dry and lacked flavor, the rock shrimp were tiny like the ones you find in cat food so that was disappointing but the sushi was good. Skip dessert we tried them all and nothing really stood out. In fact the desserts were all a little weird and unappealing.  I wish I didn't get violently ill after eating here, I would have been able to give it a better review but it was a bummer being trapped in the bathroom the whole night while my friends went off to gamble. I was still sick in the morning.",

The calamari was slightly undercooked for my liking but still good. I loved the jalapeno dipping sauce it came with. Overall I would recommend this place and plan to visit here again. Pricing is typical for Vegas. Only recommendation is that I wish the staff at the bar was a little more friendly and wanting to suggest items to try.",

At the price they charge, it should be exceptional, but then again, it's on the strip and restaurants will be pricey.

I never thought of myself as anyone who knew too much about sake, I was just thought it was pretty good and paired well with sushi. I enjoy cold sake and hot sake. I never knew that there was more to Sake then just that. Unfiltered, filter, etc. etc. Luckily, I was with my fiance's uncle who travels back-and-forth between the US and Japan and who knows a thing or two about Sake. He bought a $100 bottle of cold, unfiltered sake and it was the most amazing thing I've tasted in my life. Not only was the buzz fun, but it tasted delicious. If you ever want to pregame with your ladies and a pretty cool environment I suggest you grab an expensive/amazing bottle of sake at Kumi.",

We hit this place up after seeing a show one night, looking for a way to stuff our faces with something different than the usual burger joint, Italian restaurant, etc. and this place made our night!  We ordered so many plates. Of course, you have to start with the salted Edamame and Miso Soup, then the Seaweed salad which isn't normally my style, but it was amazing. For main plates, we ordered the Toban Filet, Pop Rockin' roll (which actually has Pop Rocks in it! - wha???). The texture and pop really was quite tasty - I recommend it. Then we ordered the Kumikaze... and loved it so much we ordered another one (the lemon slices MAKE this roll!). Oh, the Kobe Tataki was absolutely amazing! When we go back, I'm ordering those two items again. We had a few other items, then went crazy on dessert.  I highly recommend this place for anyone that loves sushi and wants a great atmosphere to enjoy a meal with family and friends.  I can't wait to go back!",

I was very intrigued by the Pop Rockin signature roll, but honestly was a little skeptical of the actually pop rocks. Looking back, I should've just tried it! I went for the Good Times hand roll and the classic spicy tuna. Both were well made and tasted delicious.",

I was fortunate on both of my visits to have had pleasant service despite how busy it was + the ambience really added to the experience. I had:  Miso Black Cod: Very flavorful, although the second time I had it, the fish was much more on the saltier side. Nevertheless, this was exactly what I expected and craved--a tender, melt in your mouth bite with a burst of flavor.  Kobe Beef Tacos: these were okay, not necessarily something I would want more than a bite or two of. It was spicier with less flavor than I expected.  Shishito Peppers: Wasn't my favorite, but everyone else at the table were crazy for these guys.  Rock Shrimp Tempura: Crispy and delicious--definitely met my tempura expectations, but I wouldn't go out of my way to say that these were anything special.  Japanese Scallop Nigiri: this was suggested by our server. I was skeptical at first, but OMFG damn it was good. Super fresh with that butter in my mouth feel.  Uni Sashimi + Sakana Platter: The sashimi was pretty standard, but still satisfied my craving. I understood that I was having sashimi in the desert, so yea.  Early Bloom sake by the carafe: nice and smooth  Peachy Keen: AMAZING cocktail. wowowowow. If you like the fruity cocktails, peach anything, and drinks that don't taste overwhelmingly like alcohol -- order this.  Yes it is very expensive, but everything in Vegas is expensive so manage your expectations :)",

Their sushi is extremely fresh (and we know Vegas isn't known for having fresh fish), and not fishy at all! I usually don't like to have raw fish on its own, but their sushi and sashimi were to die for!  Service is excellent, they were on top of us and made sure we got everything we needed. We ordered a bottle of sake and my friend insisted on getting a bowl of cucumbers for it- and we did; no questions asked! My favorite roll of all time that they have there is their pop rock roll. Yes, pop rocks, those candies that pop in your mouth. Mixed with spicy tuna and avocado. It comes with crab (or shrimp, forgot which), but I asked for the roll without it.  Their dessert is really good as well. We ordered their mochi ice cream and their carrot cheese cake. Both are a must, but if I were to choose, the carrot cheese cake was to die for!!!  I will always come back, especially since I stay at Mandalay once a year for work, this is the most convenient and the best tasting restaurant in the entire hotel!",

We brought kids...which meant we would make a mess and they were smiles all the way around. We had a party of 14 and the servers were always available to keep our waters topped off and orders coming. You could tell they were organized by the way the staff entered and exited the kitchen.   We had  miso soup (the kids loved it),  Gyoza presentation was unique and tasted good Crispy rice with tuna (perfect crunch of crispy rice) white fish carpaccio (delicious! Loved the spicy kickfrom the Serrano pepper),  kimchi edamame (very tasty! Delicious combination of ingredients!)  Seared Albecore with toasted onions (yum!)  Filet minion (comes out steaming on a hot plate which made the presentation great leading to the perfect textured meat)  Jidori chicken dish (the cream and sauce were great. It also came with a side of green beans flavored with a kimchi-type marinade. My pallet was surprised with how well the flavors went together. ) Hot mess roll was good! My favorite was the pork belly roll! Crunchy pork belly and topped with a Cole slaw salad. Pop rock roll was a fun treat! You wouldn't believe it until you tried it but it was a hit at our table. We also had a crunchy spicey shrimp and it was yummy too...almost tasted like walnut shrimp but spicy.  Sake was nice and smooth",

    "text": "As soon as Kumi opened we were there for dinner. We had a party of eight and were told that they do family style serving by our waitress. We asked if we could instead just get our orders all at the same time to the person who ordered the item and not have family style and were told of course. This answer, however, was different than what we were served. Our orders came out in choppy random waves. We would get a couple of our orders here and there all served family style. We had been there for about two and a half hours and still did not get everything that we had ordered, which they apologized for stating that their sushi station was backed up, however our non sushi items were also backed up and they forgot about the vegetable tempura until we reminded them. We ended up canceling the orders that hadn't come by the two and a half hour mark. Our waitress was nice and apologetic and did know the menu very well.     Now onto the food. The spicy miso soup was good, not too salty and not too spicy with 2 small pieces of crab in it. The ribeye with yuzu mushrooms was cooked as ordered to a medium rare and served in a teriyaki sauce topped with yuzu mushrooms. The steak was good, but I came here for the sushi so after trying it once it wouldn't be something I would order again. The vegetable tempura contained pieces of eggplant and other vegetables, nothing out of the ordinary. While the things that we tried thus far were average and nothing to brag about, out came the sushi. All of the sushi that was ordered was fresh and delicious, definitely something I would come to Kumi back for. The spicy tuna roll was a delicious blend of tuna and spicy goodness. The unagi roll had plenty of eel flavor and the cucumber was a great contrast to the BBQ eel. The 007 was a giant roll full of seafood flavor. The spider roll had good sized pieces of soft shell crab that were battered and fried just right. The pop rockin roll was a menu item that we were told me had to try by multiple friends as they had been there the night before. The Pop Rockin Roll is spicy tuna, crab, salmon, avocado and watermelon pop rocks, yes you heard or rather read me correctly watermelon pop rocks. One would think this combination wouldn't work, but low and behold it does and is an item hat I have not seen on other menus. The slight hint of sweetness, the various types of seafood in this roll were a good contrast to the spicy tuna then bam pop rocks explode.     All in all the sushi was fresh and delicious and their combination of rolls were great. The service is what was lacking during this visit. Food gets a 4.5 and service a 3.",

    "text": "I HAVE NO CLUE WHY PEOPLE GAVE THIS PLACE A BAD REVIEW! Normally I'm the type that I won't eat at a place that has bad reviews but I really didn't feel like leaving the hotel since it was really windy and cold for this Hawaii girl, but I decided to give this place a chance. Unlike the casino at Mandalay Bay, Kumi is totally worth the gamble! Since I live in Hawaii, I'm pretty spoiled when it comes to sushi. I usually don't eat sushi in the mainland but this sushi was some of the best sushi I've ever had in the mainland period! My waiter James was excellent! He was very helpful with his recommendations and I couldn't ask for better customer service. The food is on the pricey end but the quality of the food makes it worth it. Why in the world would people eat here if they are not ok with the prices? They let you look at the menu before sitting at a table. The prices are also online too. We ordered two cucumber salad, crispy calamari, rainbow roll, hot mess roll, and a sashimi plate. All but the cucumber salad was excellent! My personal favorite is the hot mess roll that our waiter James recommended. I was happy that my mom was able to try some poke too since she still hasn't been to Hawaii yet. The DJ they had that night was awesome too. I know it's weird to see a DJ at a Japanese restaurant, but he was great! I enjoyed all the music he was playing. This is a great place to eat if you don't feel like leaving the hotel and you want to treat yourself to some sushi. It's on the pricey side but the quality of the fish is excellent.  Although i had an awesome experience here, I personally wouldn't come back again since they really didn't have a lot of options on their menu. It's a great place to try once.    Summary:   Although a bit on the pricey side, Kumi's sushi does anything but lack on quality. Their service is excellent and our food was outstanding! This is a great place to treat yourself to some sushi if you don't feel like leaving the hotel. Although I had a 5 star experience, I felt that the menu was lacking on options. There's a lot of sashimi options but the menu needs more sushi roll options. It would be nice to have more non sushi entrees as well if you have someone in your party that doesn't like sushi. Unless they change the menu and have more options available, it's a try once kind of place.    Pros:   Excellent food   Sushi quality was outstanding!    Top Notch Customer Service from James. Thank you James for an excellent night :)   Cons:   Lack of menu. It's a eat once kind of place. I feel like after I ate here once, I won't come back since there isn't that many options. If there was a particular sashimi  that I wanted, I would ask where rolls it's a little different. I had to ask if I could get a rainbow roll because it wasn't even listen on the menu. I feel like that is one of the easiest and most basic rolls that EVERY sushi place has on the menu",

Three other servers were having a discussion near their POS terminal, and then left without a glance our way. No idea on the food since there was no one available to take our order, we left to try another restaurant. I think it was Derek that left us wondering.",

The food was nothing more than you would get at a very average Japanese restaurant.  The worst part, however, was the service!  Our food came out in a really odd order at such different  times (1 dish did not show up at all)- my entree was about 20 minutes behind my daughters!?  With this experience you might expect the waiter to at least acknowledge that things were not right and try to explain or apologize - did not happen.  He actually seemed annoyed that we were getting annoyed!  We would not go back, nor would we recommend this to anyone - at rather high prices, it really should have been much, much better.",

The rolls go from traditional to some more \"amaericanized\" offerings which is fine with me. Love the firecracker and tempura shrimp rolls. Super fresh and light with great spice. Some TVs to watch some sports and hang. It's on the MB promenade so good people watching also. Atmosphere and attitude account for something and here you get it.",

The staff were overworked but nice when had time. We had a reservation but ended up waiting for an extra 10-15 min. Overall, way overpriced for what it is they are selling in my opinion. Much better places to drop $350 for 3 on a meal in Vegas. If it wasn't so expensive I'd have given 3 stars.",

Of course, though, we weren't able to limit ourselves to just ordering sushi. So, we tried the pork gyozas, which were good, not great, but good. The pork belly buns, which were very good. I had a shrimp tempura roll, which was also quite good, but not quite great. For dessert, the chocolate lava cake once again was very good, borderline great.  The biggest issue of the night was getting the check. The whole dinner moved fast which was perfect since I needed to get to the show. However, I had to ask multiple different servers three times before someone was finally able to bring us the check. While me made it to the theater on time, it was past the time they said we had to be there by, just adding minor aggravation to the experience. Nonetheless, food and ambiance good. Service okay.",

The food has a certain panache to their rolls... which is one of the reasons I give this place 3 stars. I love sushi. If you've read any of my sushi reviews (which there are many) I LOVE sushi. So it pains me when I venture to a place where people love, but I do not.   The prices are Las Vegas prices. Sushi I would normally pay $4 - $9 for the MP items are double, so prep yourself for that. They have a number of rolls that are unique with a small twist, and if you've eaten here you'll know - pop rocks. Yes they have a roll here that they add watermelon pop rocks to, and yes I have tried it, and yes it is fun, but it doesn't make me want to reach for another piece because it was delicious. I want to because I want to make popping in my mouth - I can get that for .35 at the store.   I get that sushi restaurants feel like they HAVE to have crazy rolls to bridge the gap for those who do not eat sushi, but they should just let their sushi speak for itself. Not hide it behind bells and whistles which is how I felt with their rolls here.   With that said there is some fun in rolls, but if the best you have is teriyaki drizzle and pop rocks, you need to take a step back and look again at what you're trying to offer.",

They compensated well with items on the house - much appreciated - but none of us would go back.",

Sliced paper thin and lightly seared, the salmon lays in a delicious bath of hot oil, Yuzu soy, garlic, sesame and micro cilantro. So, so good. The Kumikaze roll is wonderful, even though I don't like imitation crab. In this roll it's good!  Even the coffee is perfect, warm, dark and rich in flavor. The atmosphere is beautiful. It's is peaceful and fresh. The lighting is warm and dim but not like you're trying to hide something dim. Seriously get to Kumi the next time you're in Vegas. You will not be disappointed!",

It stinks...in short, the front of house---hostesses and waitstaff just don't care and are just punching a clock on a shift.  My wife and I were there about 9pm is in Mid September and after we were seated, we were ignored (and it was obvious) for about 20 minutes.  To add insult to injury, as we walked out (never having placed an order) and the hostesses thanked us for coming ....really???????  There are so many restaurants in Las Vegas....I wouldn't give you 5 cents for this one.",

I love Yellowtail and was delighted to try the new menu offered at Kumi in Mandalay Bay, in what used to be China Grill back in the day.   We started with the Tuna Pizza with truffle oil ( all ready my new favorite tuna dish on the Strip ) thinly sliced tuna over a crispy tortilla drizzled with truffle oil. The albacore with crispy garlic and salmon with yuzu was really nice as well. Black cod with shishito peppers !!!! The rolls were all really yummy too! Try the ones with pop rocks in it!! For dessert we had the assorted mochis of guava, lychee, and chocolate flavors!  Michael our server was extremely kind and had the bartender make a nice virgin mocktail from the bar since I am unable to enjoy the real stuff! The whole staff, from the hostesses to the management were very kind in checking in on us and saying good bye to us on the way out.",

They had some early dining availability, so we jumped on it. Their special New Year's \"Paint the Town Gold\" menu did not disappoint.  Located in the beautiful Mandalay Bay restaurant row, Kumi is a gorgeous display of style and food artistry. Every course was surprisingly delicious, and plated interestingly.  Service was very good, seriously on point. Right up until the dessert course...after 30 minutes of waiting for it, we finally requested the check as we had an event to get to. One of our attendants felt bad and offered to quickly grab it for us but we were in danger of being late so we opted not to take him up on it.   It's a beautiful, albeit very pricey experience for dinner. We would return for special occasions only.",

It was how the staff and manager handled the situation.   When our check came they still tried to charge for the peppers with hair. We asked for the manager. A young lady came over and said she would take the peppers off the bill. I told her that was the bare minimum and finding hair in your food is not acceptable and at least a free drink or dessert would've made it better with a little bit of sympathy. But instead she reassured us she was the only one with long hair in the restaurant and wasn't sure how it could've even gotten in the peppers.  I was there with another guy friend so it was clearly not our hair. She was extremely rude and made it sound like we had placed the hair in the food.   When we refused to pay the bill she threatened to call security to escort us off the property. To avoid further ruining our night we paid our bill but rest assured will never return to this restaurant and will certainly be disputing with my credit card.    These situations happen and could have easily been handled with a bit of care. But it is not her fault she seemed to be relatively new and a poorly trained manager.  Her attitude and lack of any professionalism made that clear.    A drink or a free dessert offer which costs them $3 on a $200 bill would've made everybody happy.",

I also had the unagi roll which had very little unagi in it, and was rather disappointing, but I have learned my lesson. I will make sure I ask the waitress which was very friendly and honest about how much actual sushi was in each roll. I will also make sure I order more of the Blue Fin! It is to die for!",

This was a business dinner and one of my guests was a bit late. We ordered drinks and two appetizers while we waited. The one waiter took the order and a different one brought the drinks. After about 20 minutes, I asked one of the wait staff, for our appetizers (not one of the wait staff we had already met since they were no where in site). One appetizer showed up and a few minutes later the second. My last guest arrived and we were ready to order. No waiter.... Finally, I got up and walked over to the service area and asked the original waiter to come over to take our order. He was standing with 5 or six other wait staff talking at the time. He came over and we ordered several rolls and a couple of entrees. The food started showing up one at a time over the next 40 or so minutes. Very random in service. One roll, then an entree, then another roll, etc. I had to go ask the wait staff to come over and refresh drinks. I had to go and ask a wait staff member to bring wasabi, soy and ginger.... this is a sushi place, do I really need to ask for that?   Bottom line is that the restaurant is beautifully decorated. The food is very tasty. The service will make me refuse to walk in this place again. My bill with 18% gratuity added in was over $500. Just not worth it for lousy service.",

What we ended up doing was what waiter called family style dining, which basically means we got to try a little of a lot of different things.  Personally I'm a fan of raw, but few raw items came to the table.  I can't honestly say I don't know what everything was that was served, however I know we got the crispy rice, which was different, good, but not crazy good.  The carpaccio, of which we had salmon and himachi were both excellent.  The thing is, the one item that really stood out as being the best of a particular food item that I've ever had was the grilled asparagus.  I'm not a huge asparagus eater, so this was outstanding in my opinion.   The service was attentive, waiter was knowledgable and helpful.    The only downside was they weren't real quick with the drinks, and the only Japanese restaurant I've ever been to that didn't serve beer with/in a glass.  Drinking Sapporo out of the bottle just seems wrong.",

Unfortunately the food and the service just doesn't cut it for me. Had reservations and waited a bit to be seated, no biggie. Ordered a couple pricey cocktails and they were pretty average then ordered a couple of appetizers and a bunch of sushi (rolls & sashimi). The appetizers were extremely small and not all that great, some sort of beef tacos. The sushi was an extreme disappointment, the rolls were tiny and somewhat flavorless and the sashimi was really nothing worth bragging about, for some reason the sushi reminded me a bit of something you'd get in a gas station or fast food joint. Overall, not impressed whatsoever with the cuisine here at Kumi nor would I recommend it however, if you're just looking for drinks, the bar here isn't a bad option as the people watching is pretty good.   Pros- Location  Ambiance  Decor  Bar  Drink menu  Reservation availability   Cons- Sushi isn't good  Service is average  Overpriced  Cocktails are average",

With that being said, the only dish(es) that made me stand up and take notice were the crispy pork belly roll and the kumikaze roll. The crispy pork belly had a delicious crunch that was flavorful bit not salty, and was paired with a coleslaw topping that I would have never thought would go together, but it was absolutely heavenly. The kumikaze roll was salmon sprinkled with cajun spices and topped with an ultra-thin shaved wedge of lemon. It was also a perfect pairing with the hint of bitter citrus that I can only assume gives the roll its name. The seaweed salad was tasty but not worth the price, and the unagi and spicy tuna rolls were not worth writing home about.  The service was also excellent, although the surprising speediness may have been due to the fact that they were closing in about 20 minutes. Water refills came frequently, and the waitstaff was friendly.",

Maybe if we were on an expense account,  it would be okay, but for Vegas locals who can find awesome AYCE sushi and happy hours elsewhere it wasn't the best deal.  Oh well, it's a high rent district.  There were good points--hostesses and servers were very nice and prompt.  Cocktails mixed right and generously sized.  Gyoza hot, tasty and a cool presentation all in one slab, nice thin wrapping, with a red ginger sauce.  Seoul Garden sushi roll with spinach, carrots, cukes and shiitake mushrooms topped with a spicy korean sauce was almost too gorgeous to eat, but we devoured it all.  The location was also tres bien for people watching!",

My boss and his fiance use to work at Mandalay Bay, and they raved about it. This place is good for large groups, and the servers are absolutely phenomenal!   Food - The fish was so fresh and tasted amazing! One of the things I love about sushi restaurants is the edamame. They have edamame with a Kimchi butter sauce, and they are to die for! They aren't spicy, but they definitely have a kick to them. We ordered the Yellowtail Sashimi, the Hot Mess, the Pop Rockin', the Protein roll, the Dragon Roll (not on the menu), and the Ribeye. My favorite was definitely the Protein Roll - all fish and no rice. Everything was delicious!   Service - Our waiter and the attendants were always there to offer suggestions, refill our drinks, and take away the used plates. I would definitely give them 5 stars for service!   The place is pricey, so if you go, get ready to spend some dough! It is most definitely worth it, and I will be back.",

I ordered the salmon sashimi as part of my lunch and when it came it was served on a giant pile of ice. It's an interesting choice because the fish was one of the tiniest portions of salmon I have ever been served. The fish was $12 on the menu, the big problem was that it came as $13 on the final bill. Normally I would just pay it and get on with my day, but given how sad the portion was, I decided to fight it. The restaurant manager said he would take care of it and within 10 minutes he had taken $1 off my bill. Thanks for 'taking care of it' buddy.... It cost your waiter part of the tip and it earned you a nice 1 star for you yelp page. Buyer beware.",

Nothing had flavor and all of us left hungry still and have to go eat somewhere else because we were so sick of this place. I am furious and woke up to a stomach full of food poisoning.

It says a lot when you stay at the Mandalay Bay, where there are so many choices for fine dining and savory meals, and you go to the same place because of the waiter.  During our dinner we had a conversation with Ken only to find out he is familiar with the Phila and  Atlantic city area.

I know it's Vegas, but the Jidori Chicken with Kimchee green beans was $30--that seemed high to me.  That being said, I actually considered it until the chef declined my request to substitute the Kimchee green beans for asparagus.  Keep in mind that both the asparagus and Kimchee green beans are $8 side dishes.  HMMMM.....was the chef even asked or did the waitress just want to \"up-sell\" us?  I'm thinking it was an \"up-sell\" tactic to get me to pay $30 for the entree and another $8 for the asparagus.  Sorry, going to go to a Japanese restaurant and paying $38 for chicken and asparagus doesn't sound appealing to me in any venue, let alone Vegas.

We decided to try the shrimp tempura and the gyoza, meh it's was okay. Then we order sushi rolls...5 rolls and 3 orders of Salmon.I have to say that my 12 year old said that the sushi at our Colorado Springs KING SOOPERS was better and it is just okay sushi. The salmon was super small and tasted terrible. The yellowfin with scallion rolls we actual sent back, fishy and terribly disgusting. Trying to find the good we awaited the Filet and Chicken that our waiter suggested for us all to share., Meh okay the filet was okay but NOT worth the 50$ for a small plate with 8 pieces on it? The chicken was about six pieces and it tasted terrible!!! We tried to eat it knowing we were heading to a show and needed to eat. I would never eat here again, what a terrible representation of the Mandalay Bay Resort. The cost just burns me 323$, we were just at Sushi Roku, eat there if your looking for excellent sushi!!

All of the rolls were absolutely delicious but the Pop Rockin and the Hot Mess were out of this world. As a side note, I am loving the comeback that pop rocks seem to be making- they were on some desserts we had at the Four Seasons that night as well!   We ordered mochi ice cream and some other dessert that is not on the online menu but was absolutely fantastic. Some form of Korean squash cake... just get it if they have it.

    "text": "My cousins came to town and stayed at Mandalay Bay.  Kumi was one of the restaurants they were really excited about trying, so we joined them for dinner here. In short, the food was wonderful, but the service was awful. We started off with shishito peppers just for fun. They were so delicious! Only one in our batch was very spicy. Four of us dined here and ordered a fair amount of sushi rolls. My favorite sushi roll was the Fireball Roll. It's sweet and spicy with kimchee flavors. Very different from anything I've ever tried. I did, however, order the salmon entree and wasn't in love with it. There's just something that tasted really weird about the glaze that they used.  Maybe it was too heavy of a sauce.   Their service didn't score high points because we were ignored.  Our waters were only filled when we could no longer wait and got up to call the server over.  We did the same thing for the second time we needed our waters refilled.  And of course, you can imagine what happened when we needed our bill.  I so regret that we paid with a credit card.  The worst part was, they weren't even busy that day.  The price and the level of service just didn't go hand-in-hand.  Sad.",

We left it up to the kitchen, and they produced three courses of beautifully presented shared plates, highlights being the blistered peppers, miso cod, the sashimi platter, and a smoking hot kobe steak. They also have some great cheeky rolls -- everyone loved the one with pop rocks.  The cocktails are elaborate and delicious, and service was perfect -- they were really accommodating and went above and beyond taking care of our large group.",

I still really like the Pop Rockin Roll!!  It is interesting and kind of fun to try Sushi with Pop Rocks!  The Crispy Rice is also still a must have every time I go there!!  It is so good!  I also think the best thing on the menu at Kumi is their desserts!  They are made in house and they are so good.  This time I had the Strawberry Souffle and it was great!!  This restaurant seems to fly under the radar.  But if you are anywhere near Mandalay Bay and in the mood for Sushi Kumi is a great option!!  Yellowtail at the Bellagio is also one of Akira Back's restaurants and it is great as well!",

Yes, it's  a little pricey... but show me a top notch sushi place that is $9.99 all you can eat and compares to Kumi.    The waitstaff was also 5 star... our server continuously checked in with us and water glasses and drinks were always filled.    We enjoyed both the miso and spicey miso soup ... though very basic, it was truly delicious and we wanted more.    Rock Shrimp Tempura ... You'll die for this.. it has a ranch/siracha sauce and the tempura melts in your mouth... we ended up getting two servings.    The Hot Mess and Pop Rockin' were also very unique and amazing.  Yes, Pop Rocks... but so slight and they just crackled in the back of your throat so slightly, it was fun and unique and just added to the overall meal.    All of us thought the meal was very special and we will be going back -- I cannot emphasize enough the freshness of the seafood and professional staff.... thank you for a truly wonderful meal.",

The flavors are from the sauce once you make the sauce for the day you're done if you're the chef at a restaurant like this.  There must be better prices to get Sushi this good in Vegas because I know I have had good raw fish with {whatever} sauce for much less and in a much more quiet place.

    "text": "Four stars for the food and atmosphere, minus three for the service, and I'm being kind. I don't flame restaurants on Yelp (check my profile) but this place was indifferent beyond belief.  Our server greeted us not by taking drink orders, but by pitching a \"special meal\" that would be customized to our tastes and needs. She said they would ask a series of questions about our likes and dislikes, then carefully choose dishes that best suited us for \"\"somewhere between $60-100 per person.\" (A plus/minus of $300 for our crowd of seven.) I firmly told her no and that each of us would order what we wanted, partly because we had a vegan and two people with food allergies, but the server continued to sell the idea to others at the table until we relented.  Immediately dishes began coming--with no drink order taken, without the promised interview, with no consideration to the allergies we mentioned, with virtually no explanation of the dishes being served, and with no vegan entrees until we complained an hour into the meal. Our server apparently left about two thirds of the way through the meal without explanation--a half hour went by before another checked in with us. And for this we paid a $100 tip.  The food was good, occasionally very good, but not enough to mitigate service this incompetent. Go elsewhere. (And you might also ask yourself why so many of the positive reviews here mention the names of the chef, the shift manger, the bartender, etc. --details a legitimate reviewer would seem very unlikely to know.)",

This was exquisitely prepared, artistically presented, extremely fresh and served with the most thorough, friendly, obsequious and yet not bothersome service.  Rarely do you see a restaurant where the training is evidently focused on teamwork with everyone attending their own tables but also taking responsibility for extreme service across the whole restaurant.  Griffin, the manager is definitely skyrocketing in his career for good reason and our server, Lotus (yes, that's as real as she is lovely) is on track to follow all the way up the ladder.  My wife (Mary) and I long to return and greatly appreciate being treated so specially. Thank you!

First of all, how nice was it for me that it was a short walk from my hotel room at Delano, followed by another short walk to the Michael Jackson One show after dinner?!    Had a nice start to our dinner as my reservation request was honored and we were seated at a very spacious booth with a great view of the whole restaurant.  We were immediately greeted by our server who was courteous, professional, and attentive, and our water glasses were automatically refilled by different workers throughout our meal.    We were provided with a tablet with pictures and descriptions of their cocktails, which was great for me because I'm someone who often picks drinks based on their looks and garnishes :p  I picked the Cherry Blossom because it had a pretty flower in the picture :p  Luckily it tasted really good!    The food was delicious!  We ordered their Crispy Rice (my favorite!!), Rock Shrimp Tempura, Yellowtail Serrano, Miso Black Cod, and dessert that I forgot the name of but was good :p  My taste buds enjoyed every single dish!    I must say that prices are high and portions small, so this is more of a \"once in awhile splurge\" kind of place.  However, we did not leave hungry and were more than satisfied with our meal and our whole experience in general at Kumi :)",

If you separate the two issues, quality food vs price, I would say this -- food was good (not exceptional), price was high, overall value low.  This is almost certainly because you are in the middle of Mandalay Bay, a cool place -- you are paying for that atmosphere.  I was with a party of 3, service was good, again food was good, but at some point you sort of stop because the bill is becoming outrageous just to eat.  We ate, left and ate somewhere else later... (We joking said, we'll eat here, then hit an In N Out for something more substantial.)  I often rate things based on this one question, would I return?  For Kumi, the answer is no.  But I won't say it's \"bad\" - the food was ok, just a poor value.",

    "text": "Kumi is a nice place with excellent decor, although some of the food leaves a little to be desired and depends entirely on what you order. I ordered three sushi rolls: Hot Mess, yellowtail and scallion, and spicy tuna. The Hot Mess roll was brought out first. The waiter poured a sauce over the top before walking off, and let me tell you- this was one of the best things I have ever had in my mouth. The Hot Mess roll at Kumi was hands down the best sushi roll I had the entire time I was in Vegas, which is saying quite a bit since I also ate sushi at Nobu and Sushi Roku. I wish I would've ordered a series of Hot Mess rolls and skipped the others, which were pretty forgettable. If you like spicy rolls, this one is a must try if you are in Mandalay Bay.   My non-sushi eating coworker ordered a steak with asparagus. It came out on a steaming skillet and was still cooking in some kind of broth, and was pre-cut for him. He said it was just ok and rated it as a 3 on a 1-5 scale. The asparagus \"side\" was about two stalks of asparagus cut up and placed under his steak.   For a drink, I ordered a paloma which was very tasty and something I would order again. Our waiter was nice and attentive and gave us excellent service.",

Hot Mess - Delicious!! Spicy Tuna - Delicious!  As much as I loved some of the foods, the ones that weren't good were pretty bad.  My drink was disappointing ( last time it was perfect!).

They have the main dining area along with the Cherry Blossom room which is exquisite. We went on Friday night with some friends from out of town and it wow'd them.  We did the $55 Bachelorette Menu- which starts off with a glass of Champagne & some shared starters.  I always have to have the Crispy Rock Shrimp & Shisto Peppers, they are my absolute favorite.  Both have impeccable flavors.  You move into a couple of shared rolls and entrees. Everything was amazing.   The best rolls are the Hot Mess, Pork Belly, Kumikaze, and of course Pop Rockin' If you are an experienced sushi connoisseur- you will soon to find out that these rolls will be remembered forever.  For there signature flavors and unique choice of ingredients.   The service at KUMI is always great- the servers are very personable, knowledgeable about the product, and constantly table touching. Great job.   Highly recommend everyone to try KUMI",

A very friendly and easygoing customer, I have never encountered such a negative attitude from someone in the service industry. I'd say they tarnished the experience from the greeting to the goodbye, but they never offered a goodbye or thanks for stopping by. We spent around 150 a person for a late lunch/early dinner (5pm) and I'll never go back. Shame, because the food was good. That said, I will also never stay in a hotel that doesn't have a great sushi restaurant.

Fake crab on a $21 roll. Really?  Shishito peppers were delicious. Skip this place. There are far better places to eat at Mandalay Bay and far better sushi in Vegas.",

A waiter immediately showed up to take our order, and the food was served quickly.   Being from Los Angeles, we do not lack for good sushi experience, but we were in a serious need of great service. Not only our meal was delicious, but the service was outstanding which impressed us the most. It seems that every person on the floor, from manager to busboy, was involved in customer service. Everyone who passed our table would stop to pour our water or beer. Our orders were brought out by multiple servers, busboys, manager, and even a chef at one time. Any time we wanted to add to our order, our server was around. The entire staff constantly bustle and hustle, and they pay attention. Everything they served tasted fresh and delicious - they definitely lived up to their slogan, \"fresh dead fish\".   The verdict: outstanding food ans service. I highly recommend Kumi for great taste and overall great experience!",

    "text": "HORRIBLE value for the amount of food that you get.  Skip this restaurant unless you're into be robbed and leaving hungry.  ROCK SHRIMP TEMPURA $19 Flash fried shrimp in a sriracha ranch sauce. *Pretty small portion and if you've ever been to Bonefish Grill, it's just like the bang bang shrimp except smaller and more expensive.  CRISPY RICE $21 Blackened tuna, seaweed, screaming O sauce on crispy rice. *So this is 5 pieces - horrible for splitting because of the uneven number.  Running theme at this restaurant.  Crispy rice (like a tater tot) was the best part of this appetizer, the blackened tuna was fine but nothing to rave about.  HOT MESS $24 + $10 for king crab = $34 for 5 pieces.   Crab, sashimi poke, avocado, screaming O sauce. *For $24 for 5 pieces I'm expecting real crab.  Nope it's imitation crab.  So we decided to substitute for king crab which is $10 extra.  Terrible value.  Again running theme for 5 pieces, terrible to split.  Can we make it 6 so it's even and like most sushi rolls? This was probably the most tasty dish in our entire dinner.  Too bad it was $34.  CRISPY PORK BELLY $25 pork belly, brussels sprout coleslaw. *So we picked this because we were still hungry (shocker) and the server Ben recommended it.  So it is 8 pieces cut (wow 8!) but the roll is super small and they weren't even cut evenly - like really?  The coleslaw was coated in mayo to the point I couldn't taste the rest of the roll.  I had to actually deconstruct the sushi to make sure there was even pork belly in there.  Yes - about the size of a pea.  Again horrible value.  DESSERT $14 *Server convinced us to get the strawberry souffle which comes with strawberry ice cream.  Great presentation, tasted like cotton candy, but OMG so small!  Literally between the two of us we got 4 bites total, $3.50 a bite eesh.  Not kidding.    **Pro tip: If you plan on getting sake don't be a sucker by getting a carafe.  It's the worst value here!  It's about 12oz (350ml) for $30-$70.  We got Little Lilly, unfiltered bottle of sake (750ml) for $55 and it lasted our whole dinner.",

Kumi popped up on my yelp search and was very pleased with our dinner experience.  Located in the Mandalay Bay Hotel, was easy getting to as we were staying at Delano.  The restaurant ambiance & Japanese decor is very unique and welcoming.   For beverages we ordered two cocktails, The green geisha Grey Goose and Cucumber ($18) & Old Fashioned ($17).  Both tasted good. Pricey $$$ but good.   For food we ordered the Crispy Calamari to start and it was delicious, highly recommend it.  Entrees:- We ordered the Hot Mess Signature Roll & it was amazing, Crab,  Sashimi poke, Avocado, soft rice..   We also ordered the Ribeye, came with mushrooms, plentiful for 2, soft & juicy, very tasty!  Service was superb, I give a solid 4 stars for Food + service. Only thing lacking would be a better location/ view.",

The ambiance was great and our server was pleasant and personable. But the real showstopper was the food. Our party of 8 purchased a little of everything to share. Everything we were brought was amazing. The crispy rice, and hot mess rolls were especially liked. I ordered the pop rockin roll because I was intrigued by the idea of a sushi roll made with pop rocks. It exceeded expectations, so much so, I ordered a second roll. The flavors went exquisitely well together and the popping sensation was unique and interesting.  I would most definitely return on any future trips to the Las Vegas strip. But, like everything else in Vegas, be prepared to pay for quality.",

Restaurant has a very lively bar area and a large dining room with multiple sections. The sushi menu is pretty extensive ranging from classic Americanized (California rolls and miso soup) to crazy, unique rolls and other more acquired tastes.  My colleague and I split the sashimi sampler and the calamari roll.  The 12 pieces of sashimi were all very fresh and flavorful.  The standout was the octopus - best I can recall having.  The calamari roll had a unique taste and texture.  It was a large roll and I enjoyed the juxtaposition of textures.  This was the right amount of food for 2 and the bill was only $100 with drinks.   This place is worth checking out for a relatively healthy meal in Vegas.",

If you come after 9pm they have a special menu at the lounge that includes spicy salmon tacos and soft shell crab sandwich with nori chips that are amazing.   On the subject of nori chips - these are so so good! They are crunchy, salty and just perfect, we always order extra side of them to snack on.   The yellowtail Serrano is so good- spicy!  The salmon aburi is amazing   The service was awesome and loved the couch seating",

We were at Mandalay Bay for the Michael Jackson 60th birthday celebration and decided to have a quick bite at Kumi first. Usually, they have late happy hour, but for some odd reason, they did not for this evening. I didn't think that was enough reason to take away a star since the food and the service we received was exceptional. I think our server's name was Jane? She did a great job and offered reccomendations. We orderd the rock shrimp, toro sushi, and the tuna pizza. The tuna pizza, although is pricey, it is to die for! So good, and a must try at least once! Overall, great experience! I hope they stay consistent with the happy hour, because it does say on their website that they have it nightly.",

    "text": "Well, I am not too sure where to start with Kumi.  I was recently invited through work to enjoy dinner there with some coworkers.  I invited Jade as my +1, since I knew that she would enjoy it and be easy company. :)  Kumi is the new little sister restaurant to Chef Akira Back's \"Yellowtail\" at Bellagio, and it occupies the former space that was once China Grill at Mandalay Bay.  The layout has not changed much.  The decor is OK.  It's very dimly lit, with dark woods and large booths, with smaller tables throughout.  There is a small bar/lounge to the right as well.  The service was pretty good.  The only reason this is not a five star review is because I had to go to their menu to figure out what each of the items we received were - because the servers delivering our food seemed to be in such a hurry that they didn't stop to tell us what they were (or mumbled them so low we didn't hear).  Shared Plates (in no particular order):  Yellowtail Serrano - pretty typical, but really tasty. Nice kick from the serrano.  Hot Oil Salmon Carpaccio - Again, tasty. We didn't know what it was, but everyone liked it.  Rock Shrimp Tempura - One of my favorites of the night. Awesome flavor and a bit of spice from the sriracha ranch.  Crispy Calamari - Another favorite.  I am not sure how they get the batter so light and crispy, but it was amazing! Loved the jalapeno \"jelly\" dipping sauce too.  Crispy Rice - Yummy! I expected the \"screamin O\" sauce to be spicy, but it wasn't. These were BIG for 1 bite, but I managed it. :)   Entrees:  Jidoori Chicken - Probably the least favorite item we had. Not because it wasn't good, but everything else was so amazing! The kimchee green beans were pretty good, and I don't like green beans!  Toban Filet - The presentation was awesome! It was served in a little hot pot, that was covered and steaming at the table.  They then topped it with nanbanzu soy to marinate and cook a little further.  Tender and delicious!  Rolls:  Hot Mess - a little of everything, topped with Screaming O sauce again.  Pretty good, although disappointing that it's imitation crab.  Crispy Pork Belly - Yes, you read that right: PORK BELLY in a roll. And topped with cole slaw.  This was honestly one of the most amazing and creative dishes I've ever tried.  Everyone else agreed as well.  SO GOOD.  007 Octopussy - Also good. Crab salad with spicy octopus and crispy potatoes.  Dessert:  Chocolate lava cake with vanilla ice cream - Pretty good. Very rich, and not enough ice cream.  Selection of Mochi - There was green tea, chocolate and vanilla.  I'm not a huge mochi fan, but this was good.  The mochi paper seemed super fresh (as commented by Foodie Extraordinaire, Jade).  They had a decent drink menu and sake selection. I had the Kumi Bomb-Mi, which was good, even though I didn't drink it as a \"bomb.\" The beer selection is pretty weak - not a lot of Japanese beers, and only a couple of True \"craft\" beers, but that's expected.  The prices are on the high side, but that is no surprise at a Strip resort.  Also, everything we tasted was super fresh and high quality, so I definitely think it's worth it.  If you get a chance, stop by Mandalay Bay, if not for anything other than the Crispy Pork Belly roll!",

I enjoyed seeing an actual Japanese chef making the sushi for us. Watching him make sushi engulfs you and makes you completely forget you're waiting.  Ordered: -Japanese Eggplant: it's small and sweet -Hot Mess: a lot going on in one roll, definitely something that will fill you up -Pop Rockin': has pop rock candy in it for a slightly sweet, slightly popping sensation in your mouth -Kumikaze: yummy, but the lemon is somewhat overpowering.  -Toro scallion: delicious blue fin tuna- but really small pieces of 8- could devour in less than a minute  Interior design is gorgeous- the Sakura tree on the wall really gives off a warm, relaxing ambience.",

    "text": "*Thumbs up* Beautiful, elegant, and contemporary decor. Especially the fake cherry blossoms as the backdrop for the sushi bar. It looks real from far away, though. Service was relaxed, quick, and efficient. The hostesses had... ahem, legs for days. Did I talk about the food yet? I guess not.  I thought the food was fine. I'm not particularly picky when it comes to sushi. I tried a couple of rolls -- the octopussy and the hot mess (sounds like a wacky sci-fi porn movie, if you ask me). About $20 each. Also ordered the sashimi platter for around $30, which comes with assorted fish like salmon, yellowtail, hamachi, etc. Fresh fish, just very small slices for the price.  *Thumbs down* Of course, it's the price. It's a sushi place on the Strip with a stunning decor, backed by a semi-celebrity sushi chef in Akira Back -- the chef behind Yellowtail at Bellagio (which I've yet to try).   If you want authentic sushi at a reasonable price, head over to Kabuto on Spring Mountain Road, located in the same strip mall plaza as Raku and Monta Ramen. It is worth the drive, gas money, cab fare, and the effort.",

Ambiance = okay (3 stars) - you are basically eating in an open air restaurant adjoining a major walkway - kind of like eating in a sophisticated mall food court.

    "text": "I love Kumi!  I was invited to dinner with a group of friends on opening night.  I knew that this was one of Chef Akira's new venues, so I will admit that I was already expecting greatness!    When we arrived we waited at the bar for about 10 minutes.  It was opening night, so I was impressed that the restaurant didn't seem chaotic, although the main dining area was completely sat (after they sat us) and the bar was very busy.    One thing that I observed is that the bartenders were spending a lot of time perfecting the look of the drinks.  I don't drink alcohol so I can't say whether or not they also perfected the taste, but the drinks they were serving over the bar were very elegant and beautiful!     When they were ready to seat us, they gave us the table in middle of the main dining area, near the DJ booth and in front of the sushi bar.  I was very impressed by the space, the decor, the atmosphere.  Everything felt classy, yet comfortable and chic....I LOVE restaurants that really pay attention to the detail of the energy in the room.    The DJ was great, although I will admit that I have no idea who was spinning.  I was with amazing company and they were extremely entertaining the entire night.  I remember enjoying the music though and noticing how it was setting the perfect tone for the members of the room.    Chef provided us a tasting of several of his pride dishes.  We had about 15 different dishes, and I was a fan of all except one.  I did not really care for the pork chops, but maybe it was because it was the least unique of the other dishes that were brought out.    Meal highlights: Lamb Chops, Octopussy, Sizzling Steak Plate (my absolute favorite item of the night), and the sashimi platter.    It was obvious that the staff was in training as I saw a few bussers fill our glasses with pitcher water when we had bottled water sitting right on the table.  However, little things like that don't bother me or ruin my experience, especially when everything else was so flawless!    One complaint from the table, as I don't drink alcohol, was that the large tropical looking fishbowls were super sweet which made it difficult to drink.  They ended up just eating the fruit out of the bowl and leaving the big bowl of alcohol.    I will definitely be back, hopefully very soon.  I am dying for another round of that sizzling steak!    Bravo Kumi, I am excited to recommend your restaurant to my clients, friends and family.",

If this place was a little cheaper it would have maybe gotten that third star.  We ordered the tuna pizza as an appetizer as it was described by our waiter as being tuna on top of a tortilla chip. We were disappointed as the fish is sliced very finely and the truffle oil overpowered the fish.   We also ordered the hot mess roll which was quiet tasty, but a small portion.   My sister ended up ordering a miso soup that she did enjoy. And she ordered a cucumber salad that was also pretty good.   Though the service was not up to par for a $$$ restaurant. The waiter disappeared at one point and took awhile to bring the check even after we told him that we weren't ordering anything else.   Overall we probably won't be back as there are other sushi places in Las Vegas.",

I really wish I knew exactly what is in that \"Screaming O\" sauce because it is incredible. I would recommend ordering anything that includes it. I also like the pop rocks roll--so creative! The shrimp tempura roll and rock shrimp appetizer (kinda like bang bang) are both good.. but not \"must orders\". I also enjoy the pork belly roll, but it is a little bit sweet for my liking. The signature cocktails all look amazing. I've tried the Peachy Keen and loved it.  It would be cool if Kumi opened for lunch.. I think during conventions it would be a popular spot! (but they do have a nighttime type of atmosphere going on) Can't wait for my next trip to Vegas and Kumi!",

Calamari (somewhere around $20) was wayyyyy overcooked.  Clear soup for $6 was maybe 5oz, and it sucked.  Yellowtail Serrano was $22, and I think it was better than anything but still too expensive.  Food overall is extremely overpriced for quality and quantity. Pricing may be extra high because the convention center is attached and it's on the Strip, but it's still absurd.  I almost wrote a review after my first time here but decided to give it another shot. Very disappointing.",

Everyone serves every table, every server looked at each table for anything they could take or full or help with, this restaurant is what I wanted and more. The Pork Belly Ban Mi (my friend had) was amazing, the Spicy Miso Soup, the Eel and the Rock Shrimp were all equally good but what I loved most was the 007 Octopus Roll....  Our server, who was from New York, who moved when his family moved and who loves it was also a diamond I. The rough. He was attentive, he was KNOWLEDGEABLE and he steered us in a AWESOME direction for Sunday Brunch..... Kumi will see me each time I'm in Vegas",

I will start with the appearance the Japanese blossom room is my favorite as The beautiful walls and lights set a romantic classy look to the atmosphere. The service there is amazing. There are multiple servers who are there to help and make sure your table is always clean and your needs are addressed quickly. The wait staff always has great recommendations and we have been happy with every suggestion. The food is amazing. I have been at Kumi three times and have never had anything that we did not enjoy. The screaming o sauce that is on several of the rolls is amazing. The beef is perfectly cooked and seasoned to perfection.  I highly recommend asking the waiter what he recommend off the menu! We have had the most amazing meals we would have not have normally picked and been blow away with the flavors. The fish is very fresh and is amazing quality. I absolutely recommend Kumi!!",

I had high hopes for dinner... turns out the sushi menu was uninspired - specialty rolls limited, i expected something exciting... we ordered a whole bunch of rolls and some apps.  The rolls were somewhat small and they came out one at a time ...this makes me mad!  I expected a presentation of our sushi meal... 6-7 rolls together that we could enjoy. Not \"here's one\"\" here comes another one\" that is just not thinking about the dining experience at all!  To top it off there was a bit of an attitude from the waitress, the servers and bus boys were awesome but the waitress not so much. I had a much better sushi experience in Vegas at Rice & Co over near the Luxor...I know,  who knew ?   The specialty rolls were huge and options plentiful.",

    "text": "My husband and I were excited to try Kumi we made reservations for 7:30 but arrived about 15 minutes early and were seated really quickly.  The service was absolutely horrible.  We waited nearly 15 minutes just to have our waters filled.  My husband ordered a beer and I ordered a Pepsi.  When that finally arrived the server only brought my husband his beer and rushed away.  I had to wait another 20 minutes for my drink after basically waving my hands in the air to get the attention of any server.  We ordered peppers and a roll and only the roll made it to our table.  Twice we got things we never ordered either.  We told the servers we did not order those things yet they were still added to our bill.  I opted to order the lamb chops and my husband the pork.  I asked for my lamb to be cooked med/well.  After about another 30 minute wait and us asking a server how long our food will be, we were told that my lamb is taking longer because it needs to be cooked more, understandable. 5 minutes later the food came out and my lamb was rare.  Not at all cooked near well so why did we have to wait.  Not once were we asked if we needed anything we had to go get the servers ourselves.  our water never got filled neither did I get a refill for my Pepsi.  We ended up leaving without eating dinner.  This is pathetic.  Servers has no set tables and we are told they work as a \"team\".  Well the servers don't communicate and don't tend to anyone they care more about large parties and completely forget the tables with less than 4 people.  I personally would give this place no stars at all.  I will never go there again or recommend it to any of my friends.  The food sure isn't worth it.",

    "text": "I went to Kumi (at the Mandalay Bay) on 03/21/14 in the evening. There were 3 people in our party (eventhough the receipt says 4). We sat down and ordered from the menu.  The waiter (male) after hearing our order, insisted that we would get a better deal, if we ordered the Chef's special (we would get more for our money).  The orders that we had previously selected were about $50 range each. The waiter did mention that with this special, we would just eat whatever the chef decide to fix. We agreed, and we started receiving different platters to share. The food was delicious. NO problem with that. At the end of the meal, I asked for the check. A different waiter brought us the check (female), but it only had the one page (with the credit card information) with the total that you sign, no duplicate form as is customary, and no itemized list of what we ordered.  I needed to make sure I had the right check, since this check was for a much higher amount (double) of what I expected $ 475.64 plus tip ($60 additional)- so the total paid $535.64 I asked for the itemized receipt. It took a while to get this, and I never got a copy of the credit card receipt, so by that time, we were already rushed out of our table to make room for more patrons. The only part that I found deceiving in this whole event, was what how initial waiter conned us into ordering a much more expensive meal, when had something else pre-selected, ensuring us it would be a better deal financially.  At the end, he could not be found and I don't think they wanted me to have the whole receipt. I emailed management with my concern but they never answered. The food is great, but not worth those high prices.",

It's rare to see servers that have this close of a grasp on a menu, too bad the food they serve is nearly inedible.  First, who makes sushi non-gluten free?  Sushi is universally one of the best foods for celiacs, this boneheaded chef adds a special vinegar to the rice that has gluten.  Second, tempura is LIGHTLY battered.  The house special \"rock shrimp tempura\" is nothing more than heavily battered popcorn shrimp, I bet popeyes chicken has better shrimp.  Lastly, I understand we are in the desert, so I am not naive enough to expect Tsukiji level sushi, but at 2-4x tsukiji prices, I expect it to be decent.  Unfortunately, it was THE WORST sushi I've ever had.  The toro and yellowtail smelled and tasted VERY fishy, and had to be sent back.  All in all our meal came to over $60 a person, even with all the sushi being returned.  I wish I could get that night out back...",

The food was really good, but was very shocked to see that I had been charged $35 for an individual side bowl of fried rice. We ordered 3 individual small orders of fried rice and although this item was not on the menu I would have NEVER guessed that it would have cost $35. Our bill for just fried rice ended up being $105 which is absolutely RIDICULOS! The sushi or sashimi didn't even cost that much. I was in shock and would never go back there again because I think they took advantage of the fact that the item wasn't on the menu and over charged us purposely. BEWARE EVERYONE!

I will say that even though the people on the reservation line said there was a business casual dress code, I still saw guests in shorts and tank tops. I had the green drink to start which was really good. We started with the yellowtail serrano sashimi starter. It was really tasty, and the Serrano added a nice gentle heat to the dish.   The servers really pushed the filet as their dish of choice as well as the hot mess. We ordered the sushi. My wife ordered the filet and I ordered the jidori chicken. The sushi was good but not orgasmic. The filet was really tender but I found it to be really in need of seasoning. The best thing i found was the jidori chicken. It had really great chicken flavor. By far one of the best chicken dishes I've had at a japanese restaurant.  Service was excellent. I just was disappointed with the recommendations from the staff.",

So we had planned to eat at this amazing sushi bar after we enjoyed the cirque show (Michael Jackson One), we even had reservations. Unlike a lot of the other yelpers I give the service the star and the food, well nothing.   We order sashmi only, since it being a high end restaurant that's what you order, well they literally pulled it out of the fridge behind the sushi bar, already sliced and wrapped in cellophane, added some sauce and handed it over. Really, already sliced, is this a deli? It was cold like the fridge and bland as cardboard. Two plates were like this, one albacore sashmi and one yellow tail sashmi, both sucked.  We asked for the check. The chefs noticed that we were unhappy and sent the head waitress to ask what was wrong. I can't remember her name, but she was kind and just wanted to know what the issue was. I told her about the plates and how pulling them out of the fridge in front of the customer was tacky. I also went on to tell her that, I live in San Diego and our sushi is quite amazing. She went on to defend the restaurant by saying they do that to save time cause they are busy. I pointed out that it was Monday night and their was only one other couple at the sushi bar with three chefs, busy really.  In the end, not even a comp on our drinks was offered, we were literally in there no more than 15 mins. I didn't see any care for their customers satisfaction, other than asking what they did wrong. Sad that we go to Vegas a lot, this could have been one of our regular spots, oh well, they lose.  1 glass of wine 1 Ichiban Beer 1 plate albacore 1 plate yellow tail 1 order mackerel  with tip  $90.00  That night, no dinner. :(",

Miso Cod - I've had miso cod before and this one was just as good as I've had before in Nobu. Nobus is a bit better, but this is amazing as well. You have to eat this now!!!  Yellowtail - amazing.   Kobe short ribs - holy monley... Some of the best meat that has ever entered my mouth.   Shishito Peppers- yummy; would order again.   Rock shrimp Tempura - was pretty good but nothing amazing.   Colorado lamp chops - were good but pale in comparison to the miso cod and Kobe beef.  Crispy Pork belly and the toro were my favorite off the sushi menu. Their sushi rolls was just ok. If I came back i'd skip their sushi rolls all together because they were a waste of time for the most part because you can get them anywhere and better and just go straight to the above items I listed. Other then that, it was amazing food.   Service was attentive and we had a nice server, but we had a huge party and half of the stuff we ordered didn't even get to our table. I blame the kitchen not our server. Which was disappointing. We had to re order so that's why I dropped a star.",

Not extremely priced, given that it's supposed to be a nicer sushi place.  However, I wasn't particularly impressed. The fish quality was good, but didn't blow my mind, and the portions were not extremely large.   I think this place thrives on the lack of alternatives in the area.  That said, I enjoyed my meal - I had the lunch combination with chef's selection of nigiri sushi. I think it came with a miso soup and salad, neither of which really stood out, a California roll (which was average at best) and the main course: maybe 6 pieces of nigiri - As I said before all of them were good, but none of them stood out as particularly delectable.   I was left unsatisfied, but couldn't find anything on the menu that I could bring myself to order in addition - the only thing that caught my eye was the O-toro, but at $30 for two pieces, I thought it would be excessive for a quick lunch.   We ended up ordering and sharing a dessert, which I forgot the name of, but which I found very refreshing.   Given my obsession with Sushi, I would probably come back here in a pinch, but I wouldn't go out of my way.",

Kumi  is open and airy, a nice space in an otherwise bustling Mandalay Bay. And while it doesn't have the outdoor water and light show of its cousin Yellowtail at the Bellagio, it is a nice atmospheric space.   A lot of noise in the reviews here about the sushi, but for us it's about the small dishes. Like Marimoto and Nobu, the tapa-style cold and hot dishes are extensive. Most are perfect for a couple.   We started with the rock shrimp, a little heat and delicious. Then the Kobe beef tacos, again some heat but so damn good, and unlike Morimoto you get four, not three. Then we ordered the bao buns, a tasty slap of pork belly tucked inside a fluffy pancake-like bun with a kimchee mix and pickled red onion. Amazing. And then the beef new style sashimi, much like the beef carpaccio at Marimoto. Wafer thin strips of beef in a hot oil with -- I think -- Panzu and hoisin sauce and basil and garlic. Good and gone in a flash.   Then, with still a bit of appetite, we turned to the sushi. Average? Nope, great. Had the Japanese sea eel and the shrimp tempura roll. The tempura roll was average, the sea eel was awesome.   The service was beyond attentive, friendly and helpful    A great meal, a great experience.",

Finally the bf planned a date night here and I couldn't have been more excited!  When we arrived we debated between sitting inside the restaurant because the decor looks so amazing, or sitting outside where we could watch the people from the casino passing by. Ultimately sitting outside won out. I enjoyed where they seated us because it was back in the corner by the wall, not right on the outside isle where people could actually walk up and touch our food. The only thing I didn't consider was that outside seating (which really is still inside the casino) has lower tables, the height of coffee tables, so you really have to lean over to eat or be proficient with your chopsticks!  The food was pricey, but I think most people who eat sushi expect that. It was very tasty, all of it! We ordered: Shishito Peppers ($11) and super hot, but I loved them!! Salmon Sashimi ($10 for 2 pc.) melted like butter on the tongue Tuna Sashimi ($11 for 2 pc.) soft and tender like you'd expect Protein Roll ($21) - Tuna, Salmon, Hamachi, Crab, Shiso, Asparagus - decent flavor but my least favorite of the rolls we ordered Spider Roll ($17) Crispy Softshell Crab, Cucumber, Avacado, Eel Sauce - very very good. My favorite! Unagi ($13) - BBQ Eel, Cucumber, Eel Sauce - a good roll for the price.  The food came out one item at a time, which I appreciated since we didn't have room for everything at the table all at once. The service was very good although we had a super long wait to get our check.  I'd like to come here again and try a few other items on the menu. I couldn't say it was my favorite sushi place in Vegas, but it is definately one that won't disappoint.",

They bill themselves as having an imaginative sushi menu. The most imaginative item on the menu was the crispy pork roll that was served with coleslaw. It was tasty and it is a bit unusual but very pricey at $25 for what you get. Other than that there was nothing on this menu that was what I would consider \"original\" or unusual.   That theme follows through with the rest of their sushi /sashimi which was from a portion perspective small, and from a price perspective very high.   Nothing wrong with the quality -- it was pretty much the same as most  sushi restaurants I've been to.   We were there at 9:30 or so on a Thursday night and it appears to me they were anxious to close, so  the service left a lot to be desired.  Frankly if you want to find sushi in Las Vegas, there are many better alternatives. The small place at the very back of Harrahs - which although I can't remember the name -- was an outstanding value and considerably more imaginative then Kumi.  If you don't mind having your wallet vacuumed of money and leaving hungry then Kumi is the place for you!",

The second item that came out was the albacore tuna that had a delicious coating on it and was smooth as butter. Up next we're the dumplings in pork.  We used coating and sauce from albacore tuna to spice up the dumplings.   Delicious.  After that we had the filet hot plate with mushrooms.  We finished off with the strawberry souffle which I only got one bite of because my daughter ate it all.  We should have gotten a 2nd one.  All in all it was delicious!",

Besides the chef bar area decorated with a huge sakura wall paper, there's not much to look at once you are seated down.   The service is ok.  We liked the Toban Filet dish the most.  The uni and shrimp pasta is disappointing as the type of pasta don't mix well with the sauce despite the good tiger shrimp.  The sashimi plate is just ok, the octopus is fresh but otherwise the rest of the fish is average with poor cuts.",

    "text": "This review is for the bar only.**  My friends and I were making a round of the bars at Mandalay and decided to pop in here.  The bar looked great, wasn't crowded, and had plenty of space for us all.    We all ordered our drinks, well aware of the steep prices, got our drinks and were having a great time, that is until the bill came.  Myself and two others order a plum sake which costs $10.  We distinctly ordered this one instead of the Wild Grape plum sake above it because it was half the price.  We even pointed it out to the bartender on the menu.  The bill comes and the three of us get charged $20 per drink.  We ask why this is the case and the bartender says because that's what we ordered.  I tell her no, get the menu and show her what we ordered and she responds with, \"well, I poured you the other one\".  So we argue this for a few minutes then I say, \"well, I didn't order this, so I'm not paying for it.\"  All of us had more than half of our drinks left at this point so she says she has to talk to someone.  About four minutes later, a busboy rudely grabs our drinks from us and disappears without a word.  Now, at this point the matter did get resolved as the bartender repoured our correct drinks and fixed our tab but you could tell she was not happy about it.  No staff looked at us for the rest of the evening.  Not the best customer service.",

We had the salmon sashimi, albacore sashimi, rock shrimp tempura, tuna nigiri, shrimp nigiri, spicy tuna roll, california roll, tuna crispy rice, short rib, jidori chicken, and coconut rice cakes for desert. Let me start with the salmon sashimi, it came with a light sauce and jalapeno and it was so fresh it melted in my mouth. The albacore was phenomenal and so fresh. It was served with crispy onion on top with some garlic ginger sauce. The rock shrimp was great as well and it had a slightly spicy sauce, it worked with the shrimp being tempura.  We then had shrimp and tuna nigiri and california roll and spicy tuna roll.  All of it was so fresh and delicious.  The crispy rice was so yummy! It is crispy rice and tuna on top with some screaming o sauce.   The pieces aren't to big, they came in bite sizes, but I believe you get a greater taste for the rice and tuna together when you can eat it in one bite. The short rib, man o man, it was so good. It literally melted within the first bite. The jidori chicken was good, I'm not the biggest chicken fan in general, but this chicken was delicious! Now it's time for desert! We had the coconut rice cakes, they were delicious and came with a little bit of ice cream.  Kumi is 100% recommended.",

As with most restaurants at the Mandalay Bay, this place is as beautifully designed as the rest! Along the restaurant row walkway seats a very visible bar and lounge with flatscreen TVs for you sports fanatics. For a more intimate setting, a spacious restaurant seating awaits you inside.  As with most hotels and resorts along The Strip, there are ample parking at the Mandalay Bay's hotel parking lot, by either valet or self-park. There is also parking at the Luxor, with a quick walk across the bridge through the Shops at Mandalay Bay which connects the two resorts, or also a quick tram ride with Luxor and Excalibur. If you don't already know, most Las Vegas resorts are now charging for parking! Mandalay Bay is one of several MGM resorts so if you are checked in and ask for a parking card, it helps parking and dining at other MGM resorts.  From the moment you walk down the long hallway of this beautiful hotel, all of the restaurants in restaurant row appear tempting! You can just pick one and would not be disappointed! After all, it is a 5-star hotel! This late night we decided on Kumi! Dress code can be described as beautiful, business, or casual attire.  I especially liked the late night Happy Hour which starts at 9:00pm. May favorite dishes on the late night Happy Hour menu includes the Kobe Slider, Softshell Crab Slider and the Spicy Salmon Poke Tacos (I had a few orders of this one LOL)!  Kumi has an extensive sake selection, as well as a full bar! My choice of poison for the evening was Cabernet Sauvignon hehe ;)  Service was exceptional! I would like to commend the four of them who worked the bar/lounge that night! They took care of their guests and made sure everyone was serviced! They were very friendly and conversational during the whole time! Thank you for a great experience! Because of them, as well as the ambiance, rate my experience a 5! I look forward to my next experience here! If you are ever at the Mandalay Bay, be sure to check out Kumi! :)",

We got 2 and ordered a few other dishes on the side for our party of 4.  Some of the appetizers were pretty good including the yellowtail Serrano which had a great Yuzu soy sauce, the tuna pizza which came on a enjoyable crispy wafer and a ponzu Aioli sauce.    I didn't like the rock shrimp tempura - too sweet for my taste.  Seaweed salad had 3 tasty kinds of seaweed but was pretty small for $11.  Uni Pasta had nice tasting shrimp and uni but they did get overpowered by the Parmesan cheese.    The crispy pork belly roll was really good except again the cole slaw was too sweet so I ended up scraping it off and then it was much better.    All of the sushi (non-rolls) were well prepared, solid portion sizes and fresh.    The best dish of the night was the Toban Fillet.  It was perfectly cooked in a delicious sauce on top of 3 kinds of mushrooms.  It was so good the first night that we got it again 2 nights later.  The late night menu was much more consistently good.  We came back later the first night to eat there again and found nearly every dish on the after 9PM menu really good.   The wings and cod lettuce cups were amazing.   The sliders were also very good.  It was also better value.  Overall, it was a solid place to get your sushi craving satisfied if you don't want to leave the hotel and you don't mind spending some $$.",

    "text": "Sure, there are more expensive and more exclusive sushi places in Las Vegas than this one, but it had one thing going for it on my most recent visit: location.  After a long week of working at the conference center, this was on my way out to the taxi stand at the Mandalay, and we'd had a good experience here one of the other nights during the week, so we stopped in again.   Backtrack a few nights prior. We had been to another high-end sushi place that required taxi rides and reservations, not to mention a credit check and possible loan. I hear it is one of those places to be seen at: the line waiting to get in was around the corner and the noise level was pretty high. Sure, it was \"all that,\" but, frankly, the service was a little lacking and they're REALLY impressed with their food and alcohol. For us, Kumi was different. Sure, you do need a reservation at peak times, or if there is a conference in town -- it is easy if you're working late on the last day and everyone else has already left town, though!  As a side note, you can get a nice jar of sake here for less than the price of the rest of your meal... unlike some other places.  I don't eat a lot of sushi, but my expectation has never been to get full eating sushi. It is more about the presentation, nuances of taste, and the overall experience. So, I do expect pay a fair bit more for a small amount of food. While this place is pricey, it is not way out of the ballpark, especially for Las Vegas and the Mandalay Bay.   Both times we came here, the fish was fresh, the service was good and the pacing was well done. We didn't come at peak time during either visit since our eating schedule was dictated by our work and travel schedules, so your mileage may vary.   As for the food, everything we tried was at least as good as the other places we've been to in Las Vegas The Miso Black Cod and crispy pork belly rolls are excellent, and the group liked the \"007 Octopussy,\" which is crab salad, spicy octopus and crispy potatoes in a roll format. That and the \"Hot Mess\" (crab, avocado, sashimi poke, and \"screaming O sauce\")...   From the late night menu, the Bao Bun also has a nice combination of flavors and is good for those who don't like the idea of eating raw fish: pork belly, daikon kimchee, pickled red onion.  They were kind enough to store our luggage so that we didn't clutter up the dining area.  Anyway, I would come back.",

There is also areas in the back for more privacy.  Went during restaurant week so they had a special menu.  The food included edamame, tuna & crispy rice, salmon, and tender beef.  All the food were excellent and tasty.  I was very impressed.  For dessert, I had souffle, which was so sweet and delicious!  I would highly recommend giving Kumi a try if you're a fan of asian food, or food all together  Overall: Great asian food!",

    "text": "I came here with my girlfriend and didn't really know what to expect. We were interested in the Japanese/Korean inspired dishes. We went with Chef Simon's recommendations and went with their Omakase menu.  We didn't realize what we got ourselves into...but we definitely did not go back to our hotel room hungry!  We ended up getting a total of 7 dishes and 2 desserts. My favorites were the whitefish carpaccio, the rock shrimp tempura, toban filet and I really enjoyed the flavor of the kimchee edamame. I've never had edamame like this before and it really worked well together...but be warned that it is a little spicy! The filet was delicious and was cooked perfectly and had a good balance of asian inspired flavor and meatiness to it.  I also was recommended a Japanese beer that I hadn't had before: Koshihikari Echigo. This was dang good beer and worked well with the food. I kind of wish we had some sashimi with the meal, but I was too stuffed by the end to intake any more than what came out.   All in all, we had great service, nice ambience, delicious food and although a bit on the pricey side...most folks are expensing this stuff to their work anyway right?! So go ahead, splurge a little with your (hopeful) Vegas winnings and indulge!",

    "text": "Kumi's service was a little strange and the meal was definitely pricey, but the food was DELICIOUS!!  I dined at Kumi for Restaurant Week and ordered the prix fixe menu of Miso Soup, Toban Filet, and Mochi Ice Cream.  I also ordered a \"Hot Mess\" roll.    The Hot Mess roll was SCRUMPTIOUS!  I would absolutely recommend it.  It was a bit pricey (about $25) and only came with 5 pieces.  The crab and sashimi poke were fresh, and I loved the crunchy pieces on top of it.  The \"Screaming O\" sauce is a bit on the spicy side, but not overwhelming.  I am not sure what kind of seaweed it was wrapped in, but it was delicious as well.    The Toban Filet was AMAZING!  They served it sizzling in a Japanese skillet and poured a ponzu sauce on it.  The filet was perfectly cooked (of course, a little rare - just how I like it), and was so soft and flavorful!  I also appreciated that it came with mushrooms.  The shoyu-based sauce was savory and complemented the filet perfectly.  The Miso Soup was mediocre and a very small serving -- definitely not worth the $6 they usually sell it for.  My friend had the edamame, which was also mediocre, but a very generous serving.  The mochi ice cream was delicious!  If this is your first time trying it, it is definitely a must have!  The service was a little strange.  They were very attentive, but kept making mistakes.  My friend had sparkling water and I had flat water, but they kept trying to fill my glass with sparkling water.  Additionally, twice during my meal, they tried to take my dish away when I was not yet finished.  It seems that they were trying very hard to be efficient and alert, but it ended up backfiring on them.  The ambiance was very high-energy, but also dimly lit.  It appeared that they were trying to create a more formal environment, but the loud music made it informal.  Two of us were seated in a booth that seemed like it was designed for four, so that was strange.  If you are trying to impress a date, be specific when you make your reservations to ensure you get the right table.  It looked like there was a well-decorated area on the opposite end of the restaurant, and I would love to be seated there next time.  All in all, the food was delicious, but was definitely overpriced - especially in consideration of the strange service and ambiance.  If you are someone who is not very price sensitive, then I would definitely recommend it because the food was scrumptious!  If you are price sensitive, then you could certainly find a better value elsewhere.",

    "text": "After reading a lot of reviews it seems like Kumi's success rate depends on what you order. I'd agree on that.  By my friend's suggestion we ordered:  -the rock shrimp tempura  -the crispy rice (blackened essentially seared tuna on top of crispy cubes of rice with \"screaming O sauce) on top -the Hot Mess roll (with screaming O sauce)  -the miso black cod -a gin tonic -a Green Geisha cocktail (Bombay Sapphire East, Cucumber, Melon, Thai Basil, Lime, Togarashi Syrup)   --- Would DIE to eat again:   1. The miso black cod will change your life. The fish is INSANELY tender and so tasty and the small sliver of skin was so incredibly NOM. My fried told me this cod is marinated for 2 weeks before serving and it definitely tasted that way. Every little fleck of fish meat tasted like a flavor bomb.   2. The Hot Mess roll. That \"screaming O sauce\" is super nom and the sashimi poke all along the top of the roll totally hit the spot for me. I had been craving sashimi for awhile so this was lovely.   3. The Green Geisha cocktail was delicious. I'm normally not a fan of cucumber but our waitress suggested it and it turned out to be a really great choice. To be honest, barely tasted the gin, which I would say is a small shame since Bombay is delicious.   --- Would eat again but wouldn't die for:   1. The rock shrimp tempura. This stuff is crack. It's incredibly tasty and I can see myself binge eating it by myself in a dark room while watching Netflix but wouldn't board a plane to have it again.   2. The crispy rice. I loved the seared tuna but something about the crispy rice square didn't blend well for me with the consistency of the seared tuna. I felt like my mouth was fighting to properly blend the two while trying to ignore all the hard crispy rice bits getting stuck between my teeth. My friend really loves this dish though so maybe it's just my personal preference.",

They didn't have Pernod, but did have Bulleit, and the right artisan cherries for a Woodford Reserve old-fashioned.  Ordered Bao Buns (excellent) and sushi (unagi, and Alaskan King Crab) to start.  Awesome, fresh.  Well-prepared.  Ordered hot saki; dry and hot, so my husband was happy.  Entree (split) was the Kobe short ribs. FALL OFF THE BONE.  They graciously brought a knife, but it wasn't required.  :)  Dessert was a chocolate lava cake and strawberry souffle with vanilla ice cream and a blackberry creme anglaise.   Both done to PERFECTION.  Bravo, Kumi!!",

    "text": "This place is good. Honestly my favorite meal that is under 1000 dollars in Vegas. With a Korean chef, and access to great marine product, this place is worth it.   The place is open, yet individual, it is far away enough from the casino floor that it doesn't smell of tobacco and prostitution, yet it is close enough to walk to the action in about 30 seconds. The atmosphere is great, with a bar level, and a dining area equipped with a sushi counter and wine closet.   The waiters are very knowledgeable and will suggest the best things on the menu regardless of the price ( it will be in your favor) the busboys were hovering and uncomfortably interrupting. That combined with loud music is hard to make conversation with others.   The food is exquisite. The only issue I have is the small portions. It will not fill you up, the sushi platter isn't even enough food for a child, and yet at 55 dollars, it is not worth the time.   If you are rich, then this place will be a better bet than the bacchanal, but foodies, be prepared to savor, and it will Be a great experience.",

When you ask the server what is the hold up? Why is everyone in my party all eating alone when we came together for a group dinner?  Her response we have 4 different kitchens that operate independently. How does an expensive sushi restaurant have 4 different kitchens that don't communicate with each other when they are in the same space.   Save your money! Avoid this garage place",

I had the shrimp gyoza - cooked to perfection with the lightest of pan sears with a delightful side sauce. Perfect amount provided.   Kobe beef tacos have a little spice kick to them but perfectly delightful.  Tuna tacos are a light alternative and  delicious as - is, add soy sauce, or add the gyoza sauce is my personal fav... that sauce can go on nearly everything.. I should've drank the bowl but too many witnesses lol   Matcha Mule is rerefshing light and a pick me up in a glass. For those long Vegas days/nights bound to happen.   I cannot wait to explore more of the menu and the bar seating is super comfy although can get loud if you're trying for some zen time or to have a conversation with people... not too bad and still totally manageable. Maybe get a table if you want more private conversation.",

The GOOD: Yellowtail Serrano, Sashimi Platter, Unagi Roll, Kobe Beef Tacos, House Salad, and Hot Mess Roll. These were the group favorites of the night. All the fish was very fresh and came out in a good time. The House Salad comes in a sizable portion as well if you're craving some greens.  The NOT WORTH IT: The Kimchee Brussel Sprouts and Yuzu Scallops. The Brussel sprouts came in one of the smallest portion sizes I have ever ordered while the Scallops were dry and not that flavorful for its $21 price tag and only comes in 2 large, cut into 4 pieces. Don't waste your money on these!  Overall, delicious sushi spot. Make sure to check-in on Yelp for a free desert shot!",

I asked chef Lane to make me a roll with yellowtail and a roll with salmon but to surprise me. It was so fantastic! The center was filled with mouthwatering fresh fish instead of the usual rolls with a tempura shrimp or veggie in the middle. This is what I was looking for. Because it was so good I returned the second night and experienced another great sushi meal. I live in San Diego and eat sushi 2 times a week at least. I'm spoiled now by Kumi and can't wait to go back!",

Kumi's late night happy hour for food is amazing.  Their was salmon poke tacos. Warning: very spicy, but full of flavor! It was almost too spicy to eat but to hold to put down.  They have these beef sliders and crab sliders, which are absolutely amazing. Both are a must order!  The bartenders were very friendly and took very good care of us.",

I love how they bring out whatever is ready first. Service is impeccable as and presentation is appealing. Short ribs were amazing, melted in your mouth and had great flavor.  O-Toro was also on spot and shishito peppers had a flavorful spice to them. Kobe beef tacos were dry although I really enjoyed the taco shell - light, crispy and fresh. Dumplings and protein roll were also good (too much crab versus salmon or yellowfin, imo). Lobster seemed a little undercooked and sauce didn't go well with it - creamy but odd flavor. I'd go again but likely for lunch not dinner (they close at 10).",

The Black Cod was also amazing. The one item we just didn't get was the Pop Rockin' roll. It was just a bit gimmicky and the roll would have tasted better without the pop rocks.

Like $10 for an order of plain edamame expensive, but hey, that's Vegas people!   While dining for dinner we got a ton of apps and sushi, my favorite app being the tuna pizza. It's very different than it sounds.... basically consists of a very very thin micro-crust with sashimi-grade tuna on top. So good!   The crispy rice is also worth noting--Perfectly crispy and just enough Korean spice in it.   For sushi, we had almost every specialty roll and they were all delicious. This isn't your standard rainbow roll! They have really innovative rolls like the pop' rockin, a delicious roll that has pop rocks on it, so adds an unexpected crunch sensation when eating.  Also worth mentioning, are the protein roll for those wanting to minimize on carbs and the hot mess. (The staff isn't kidding, the screaming O sauce is legit... like a kicked up version of spicy mayo.)   Overall, Kumi had amazing food, service, and vibe, and if you're staying in Mandalay Bay do not miss out!",

Many high end places were booked early and we had to take our chances with walking-in and sitting at the bar. We went to dinner at 5:50. Lucky for us, we got to KUMI and there were available seats at the bar area.  Upon seating, our server was very nice, she had brought menu for us to take a look and got our drink orders in.  We felt like splurging since it is the holiday and asked if they have an Omakase menu.  Our server went to get the New Years Eve Special for $95 pp.  We decided to go for it.   The first two dishes came out relatively quickly and then the third and the fourth... however, after that, it was a lot of waiting, downtime and unsure if the staff noticed us. We didn't get our water refilled, my ice tea was never refilled and we were pressed on time since we had a show to catch at 8:00.  More on this later. The food: not worth the $95. I get it, it's Vegas. But the value and quality of the food cannot be justified.  The Kumi Sashimi was good. Salmon Taradito was my favorite of all the dishes. Miso cod was sweet and a bit small if it was for 2 to share. Rock Shrimp tempura just taste like mayo fried shrimp.  I think our third course hot mess and protein was on one dish and that was underwhelming.  Imagine: sushi rice roll with the filling used as topping. I don't know if the crab meat filling inside the other roll was imitation crab? Thought that the menu was a bit misleading by saying crab and that's what we got. Our server was trying her best to get our food out faster. But the dessert came, we finished and then our 4th course came.  At that point, i wasn't hungry anymore and the sushi was suppose to be the reason why we ordered the pre fixe. I ate a couple pieces and they were not great and end up wasting a lot of it. We also got a free shot of bailey for checking in Yelp. Overall, was not happy with the whole ordeal.",

I have heard raves anyways about this restaurant and now I get to deliver the goods too! Let's just say anything that has pop rocks in it I am willing to try. To pair pop rocks with \"real\" food let's just say the chef I'm sure is a genius.   We opted to sit at these couch type chairs with a little table between us. It was such a great atmosphere to experience my first stab at sushi. Since we were drinking prior at Red Square and did not want saki, we opted for beer. We ordered Budweiser too in an authentic Japanese restaurant. Irony at its best! The decor is the absolute best here! The service is flawless and so professional that they are very confident too!  Did I mention pop rocks prior that's right I did so the delicious item we shared first off since so large was salmon tuna rolls. As one eats this it pops with delight in your mouth! Wow, what a masterpiece! Then we also shared an order of pop rocks sushi. It was cooked so well and while I came in a sushi virgin, I left a sushi winner! I am hooked and this dish had pop rocks in it too! What a great night to spend with my girlfriend before sending her off to EDC to dance herself away!",

I've been all over the world and have eaten everywhere and I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the food here.   In looking further at the one and two star reviews several things stand out.  One is the complaint about the quantity of food and the other is the price. First, this is not Outback or Applebee's, so if you want huge portions so that you can become the 60% of Americans who are fat and obese, this is not the place for you.  This is after all a Japanese restaurant and the value is placed on quality over quantity.   As for the price, you are paying for the quality of the ingredients and the quality of the service. The menu with pricing is available before you enter the restaurant and before you place your order, so don't act surprise at the price.  Too expensive?  Go to Chili's or McDonald's then.

The menu has a limited selection for sushi rolls and sashimi selection but the sushi that was on the menu all sounded amazing. After seeing the size of the rolls We settled on four rolls for three people plus two clear soups. It was the right amount. The food:  we had the clear soup first. It was nice to see a slice of half a shrimp in the bottom of the bowl and had a good taste of fish and clear broth. The BBQ eel was very tasty. The spicy tina is very spicy and the tempura shrimp was mediocre. We then chose the pork belly sushi roll and again mediocre. The staff;  our waiter seemed abrupt and on the side of ride than friendly except to our 8 year old which was nice to see. He became scare d when we needed refills in our drinks as well never was to be seen when our food arrived. We tried to get another staff members attention but that was a huge joke. Not only do they zip around the place with blinders on but didn't seem to want to help except only to remove the plates. When we finally did track down our waiter we had to ask where our pork belly roll was. He explained that junk has three kitchens so the food comes out whenever. Good to know, now!   One more tip I hope you know how to use chopsticks, which our party does, because they don't offer silverware. All four rolls fell apart when we picked them up with our sticks. Letting me know they weren't tightly wrapped.  The end result; as with all places in Vegas for what we ordered and zero beverages except waters was over $90 without tip. It wasn't worth it. I have had better sushi at home which is IN. All of us left in satisfied and disappointed.",

There is no rice in the roll which I just wish they would have told me but it was excellent.  Big downside is the price. It is pretty expensive even for the strip.",

    "text": "With all the rave reviews and our previous five-star experience at Akira Back's Yellowtail at the Bellagio, we had high hopes for our dinner at Kumi on Saturday night. We had reservations for 8:45 pm after the Michael Jackson One 7 pm show (see separate review), and we arrived promptly at 8:45 pm. We were told by a very sweet hostess that they were running behind and we would be seated within ten minutes.  That should have been a warning for what was to come.   As requested on Open Table, we were seated at a semi-circular booth in the back room (or upstairs as the hostess referred to it). It could be an incredible room except that the lighting is so dim, you can't read the menu. Thank heavens we had read the menu and already knew what we wanted to order. It was quite disconcerting that we were asked by two different waiters what we wanted to order for drinks, and then we were asked again by two waiters what we wanted to order to start. The waiters were initially friendly, but then they seemed to be rushing us . . . and that was strange because the room was not even remotely filled with diners at that point.  Maybe they were playing catch up as the hostess did say they were running behind when we arrived?!  For a new restaurant, they should have spent a little more time explaining the menu, making suggestions, etc.   We ordered in stages so that all the food didn't arrive at once. We started with the Japanese Eggplant . . . one Japanese eggplant cut in half . . . delicious, but not worth the $12 price tag.  We followed that with the Miso Black Cod. Now, this is one of our favorite dishes, and we have had this at some of the best restaurants in Las Vegas, most notably Nobu, and my husband and I both agreed that Nobu has the best around. I'd put Kumi's close to the middle of the pack, not just for its taste, but also its value at $29. Then I thought about the portion and taste of the Chilean Sea Bass I had the previous evening at Mastro's Ocean Club ($45 for a huge piece) with the price we paid  for the Black Cod (similarly priced fishes), and we felt rooked!  We took the advice of previous reviewers and had the Hot Mess roll and the 007 Octopussy. Both were tasty, but we have had much better rolls at Social House. And by the way, good luck seeing what you ordered in the dimly lit room.  I had to take a picture with my iPhone flash on to see how the plate was presented!  The straw that broke the camel's back was that we ultimately waiting over 30 minutes to get our check. We wanted to sign to our room at Bellagio and apparently, according to our waiter, their system was down. He came back to inform us that his manager would be taking care of it shortly. Fifteen minutes later, we received our check, and it was inaccurate, so back it went. Our server, looking ever so stressed out, came over to say they were still experiencing issues and that a manager would again be taking care of things.  Twenty minutes later, the manager came over with our check. He did not apologize for the wait, or that the check was wrong . . . he just walked off.  At that point, my husband gave me the bill and told me that he could not bare to fill it out and said \"you do it.\"  Neither of us were sure if it was the waiter or the manager who was at fault, but I called the manager over again and explained that we were quite shocked that the service was so poor. He said he didn't understand, and as I explained that we waited so long for the check, he said, \"I'll have a talk with my server. I wasn't aware of it.\"  The end.   Needless to say, I have nothing positive to say about our experience at Kumi. I guess if you are stuck at Mandalay Bay and have a hankering for Japanese, then you might choose Kumi, but if you aren't, there are so many better places . . . including Shef Akira Back's other noted restaurant, Yellowtail.",

    "text": "I really was excited about trying this place out, and I REALLY want to give it more stars, but the experience was just so bad for me.  We came in here about a week ago on a Sunday night for a friend's birthday dinner.  We had reservations for a party of 40+ people.  My friend had planned it, and the dinner guests was comprised of a bunch of his buddies from LA and other cities.    The food was okay, but the service is where it kinda lacked for me.  First off, our server gave everyone the option to either do a la carte or the prix fixed menu for $75.  Sounds good, right?  We ordered and the night kept going on...    Fortunately, we got our drinks, cuz I REALLY would have been disappointed if I wasn't liquored up lol...  My boyfriend and I got the prix fixed menu--it sounded like it was gonna be good.  Everyone around us pretty much ordered a la carte; their food came out first, and from then on I regretted ordering the prix fixed deal.  After about half an hour of waiting, after watching everyone finish their a la carte meal, small plates of sushi were being delivered to the middle of the tables.  I was so confused because I thought I was paying $75 for my own plate, not to share with a bunch of people that just had food.  This is something that the server forgot to mention--the prix fixed deal was served \"tapas style.\"  Had I known that, I would have spent $75 on an a la carte dinner just so I wouldn't have to share.  So lame.  I was so hungry, and they were only putting out like one plate per 4 or 5 people.  I think the server got the point, saw the hungry look on our faces half way through our meal and brought out more food.  Only this time it was too late; people were already filling up on the little scraps that were already out (I snacked on so much edamame).  It was terrible because there was so much food left over.  I felt so bad.  I really wish they would have just anticipated to bring out that much food to begin with.    Finally, the bill. OMG. IT. TOOK. FOREVER. Literally took an hour to get the bill.  I don't know why, but it did.  And it was terrible.  The server was so overwhelmed.  At one point she even said, \"That's it, I give up, I don't know what to do anymore.\"  Everyone had a separate check, some people had cards, some people had cash, some people ordered a la carte, others ordered the prix fixed, and everyone had different drinks.  So I can see how confusing it can easily get.  I don't know if it was her first time serving a big party like this, but she really didn't seem to know what she was doing--as pretty as she may have been.  Okay, I'm done ranting.  Let me share some of the things that I DID like.  The ambiance is really pretty.  Dim.  They've got this sexy Asian decor going on.  I dug it.  The cocktail/beer/wine menus were on iPads (I still don't get why iPads don't have full menus on them).  I tried the lychee sake martini drink.  That was tasty.  The prix fixed menu wasn't terrible.  The rolls were nothing to rave about, but the sashimi dishes were amazing!  I'd go back there for some of those!  The rock shrimp was also pretty good.    Overall, I probably would have given this place 3 or 4 stars.  The other staff members were actually pretty attentive (my water glass was always filled to the brim; I was never thirsty for water lol).  It's just that one main girl server that had to ruin it for me. *sigh* I'll probably try this place again some other time.  The wound is still too fresh for me to go back there anytime soon, however.  Some day, I'll give you another chance, Kumi, someday.  But until then, 2 stars for you, bro.",

This is one of their signatures dishes and I can see why. The flavor was outstanding and the portion size was perfect. I even had enough room to eat the rest of my girlfriends sushi! The service was excellent, very attentive and very friendly wait staff with knowledge of the menu.

The waitress got our order right away and was nice initially. We order some sushi and some late night wings. The spicy tuna roll was amazing, and the salmon was really tiny for the price (like really small). The sushi came out first and our wings came out 20 minutes later which is a little weird. I've worked in restaurants and you should try to have the food  come out at same time. Now the down side, our server was no where to be found and the water guy was asking if we were finished and we said we were wanting to get our tab. Waited 20 minutes to get the tab, I had to track down the manager who got the tab just as she was giving it to us. She took our payment right away and didn't come back for a while (15 minutes) had to ask the manager to close our tabs. The bar said they couldn't do it. It wasn't even busy at this time. They need to train their staff on the proper service and timeliness.",

The sushi is ok, not bad (I've eaten sushi at Kyoto and Osaka, Japan so I guess it's all relative?).  Spanish Mackerel sushi is solid though.  The first time, service was average to above average (not a busy time at the sushi bar).    I was recently there during CES and took some of my business clients.  Our server was terrrible!  Unprofessional and very slow.  Our orders were incorrect, forgot the miso soup, server never came by to see how we're doing, we had to flag him down, etc, etc.  Granted it was during CES week and perhaps he was new.  But you would expect consistent and excellent customer service every time you go to a quality Restaurant.  But not at Kumi.  Kumi disappoints.  I've spent $400 and $600 on customer dinners and was ashamed that I took my business clients there.",

The bonus- not only was the food remarkable, but the service was phenomenal as well.  When our server was busy with some larger groups - another guy checked in and thankfully he did because we ordered more sushi!  Take their suggestions! They know what they're talking about. Our server was Ken and he was right on with each roll and app he recommended. The 'Hot Mess' is amazing by the way.  We will be coming back for sure.  Thanks Kumi and thanks Ken for making my wife's birthday a total success!!",

I personally enjoyed  the rock shrimp tempura, yellowtail serrano and the miso sauce on the pork chop was amazing.  Kumi is well worth the price, you can spend a whole evening sampling the great food and drink menu or just pop in for a couple small dishes to kick start your night",

The server was nice and quick to bring us our check when we asked so we could catch our show but when we first got there it took them a while to bring us our menus and when I ordered a drink it didn't get to us until we were done with our meal.",

    "text": "I came for dinner with miss Teri W. (thank you for the invite!) and it was a pretty nice treat. If you like Yellowtail, Nobu and such you might really like this place. This is Yellowtail's sister restaurant, in fact, opened up by Chef Akira Back.   We had a tasting menu set for us, so we just let the \"omakase\" come forth and didn't question it.   *Yellowtail, serrano chilies w/ ponzu - nice freshness of fish, good, but standard.  *White Fish Carpaccio- it was a white fish I could not pin point but the menu says Hirame. I do like the crispy shallot bits in here to set off the fish.  *Rock Shrimp Tempura - this was lightly battered then tossed in a mayo based spicy sauce. It's a bit spicy, sweet, savory and had nice crunch. Quite nice.  *Crispy rice with tuna - This was nice texture play. Good fresh tuna, nice crunch from the rice, a bit of seaweed, a bit creamy and tangy sauce.  *Crispy Calamari - I really loved this as they achieved a lightness in the batter that is hard to achieve. It's damn beautiful in fact when this subtle thing happens . The jalapeno, fish sauce and mint jelly was different of a sauce, but I did enjoy it. I could eat a basket to myself, but you know can't be a heathen.   *Toban Filet - They do well with presenting it, coming steaming out a hole of the hot pot and then they unveil it at the table and pour a special soy. Very tender filet mignon and had shiitake and sea beans to accompany it.  *Jidori Chicken - good as far as Jidori goes, but it was alright in the scheme of the dinner. It had more of a salty/savory sauce and with the rich puree and kimchee green beans I feel a tiny bit of acid might elevate and cut it to make it better. The crisp of the chicken and the juiciness was good though.   *Hot Mess Roll - it was a crab roll topped with various fish like a poke and screaming O sauce. This was decent, but I feel it's weird a high end restaurant doesn't use real crab, but krab.  *007 Octopussy - crab salad wrapped with cucumber, topped with spicy tako and crispies. This was a refreshing roll. I really liked the combination of the tako with the cucumber and creamy crab.  *Crispy Pork Belly Roll - it's pork belly with skin and fat on topped with cole slaw and had a honey like sauce. This was different and the textures and flavors were lovely together. Great meld of crispy, soft, crunchy, creamy, salty, sweet. A favorite of the night.   *Chocolate lava cake - very rich and good, needed more ice cream  *Mochi (green tea, chocolate, vanilla) - definitely fresh made. Good, but standard.   Service from our main server was friendly enough and our drinks kept filled. The bussers that brought food were rather fast though. They announced and left and there were a few times I had to ask \"Did you hear what they said it was?\" I just tasted it and figured it out myself and compared that versus the menu to know what dishes were had. It wasn't busy, homie you can slow your roll a little. The pace of the dishes though was fairly good. We had most things coming as we were consuming the last bits of something. It's a plus as I've been to dinners where the pace drags on. I can talk peoples heads off, but few people can commit to sit there for half a day.  If you're on the strip and looking for a good Japanese, Japanese Fusion then consider this spot. I'm glad I got to try it. It wasn't really a restaurant on my radar, but that pork belly roll is different enough to order again.",

Flag someone down to correct the mistake and it takes another 15-20 for the correct rolls to arrive. Food was very good but the service was NOT acceptable for a high end restaurant.

    "text": "There are so many places to get sushi in the Mandalay complex, I picked this one because I wanted to try the hot mess and pop rock in. I did try those along with the crispy rice and black cod miso. To start my friend has a beer and I had a $20 glass of grape plum sake which tasted like pure grape juice, I wouldn't get that again. The crispy rice came out and it was so good. The crispy rice texture with the tuna was great and the sauce they poured over it was yummy. The miso black cod I have seen in many menus and always hear how great it is, this I thought was ok, I just don't think it was my thing. The hot mess, one of the best sushi rolls I have ever had. The poke in too was so fresh I found myself wishing for just a big bowl of poke. The pop rocking was interesting I was skeptical, but the flavors paired so well together and it made for a mouth pleasing fish it balanced out the spice perfectly. Then there was dessert.....always my favorite part of the meal. First off they have an amazing desert menu and I wanted to get one of everything but I settled on the island summer which was a pineapple guava upside down cake with vanilla bean ice cream and a caramel run sauce. I barely ever finish dessert but this is one of the times it was gone, it was a very small serving though. As soon as you take your first bite the essence of guava explodes in your mouth, I love guava and when it was gone I found myself wanting more. Overall a great meal with good service and nice atmosphere and I will be back here when I want sushi and I'm in Vegas.",

The sushi was okay, but it definitely didn't have a wow factor. Don't ask me how, but I inadvertently ordered a roll with Pop Rocks in it. Who puts Pop Rocks in a sushi roll? Totally dissin' the fish. The portions were small (and I'm not expecting a slab-o-fish). The fish was so-so. The price for four with Sake was 500 clams. It wasn't worth it. Save some money and Uber down to Bocho Sushi -- a much better experience.",

There was no reason for it to be the price that it was (I believe around $25). My man-friend had a California roll and the shrimp tempura roll, both of which were also quite good but not worth the price. We also had some sort of chocolate dessert that was fine, but it's hard to go wrong with a chocolate dessert.   This restaurant does not stand out in the sea of restaurants on the Strip, but satisfies an expensive sushi craving if you happen to be at Mandalay Bay.",

Edamame ($7) - hard to screw these things up  Kimikazi Roll ($20) - meh, nothing special. I've have way better at the local dive near home, wasn't impressed.  Drinks - Expensive: Merlot ($16) Moscow Mule ($16)  Total bill $84.36 + tax+ tip  Conclusion: take my word for it and spend your money elsewhere.",

We ordered four items: unagi roll and soft shell crab roll (from the main menu), and softshell crab slider and black cod lettuce cups (from the late night menu).  I don't think I'd order the soft shell crab roll and definitely not the unagi roll next time visiting this restaurant but thought the items from the late night menu were very unique and delicious.  Keep in mind that one order of the softshell crab slider is for one slider but it's a decently sized slider so no need to go overboard ordering multiple sliders.  I'd highly recommend ordering this if you like a touch of Korean twist in your Asian fusion dishes.  The black cod letter cups were good as well, albeit a little salty, but good nonetheless.  Late night menu is available ONLY at the bar and lounge after 9pm.  Let the hostess know that you're interested in the late night menu because otherwise, she'll seat you at the main dining area and ordering off the late night menu is off limits.  Also keep in mind that you can order off of any menu at the bar and lounge so if you're unsure of what you want, just ask to be seated at the bar and lounge.",

M - eticulous service.  Always made sure there was wine or plates taken away, or water that needed re-filling.  They've acquired this skill which you see at many of the Strip restaurants where they can reach over almost like a ninja, and pour the water while you're just chatting and not even seeing... then you glance over and go... hey!  magic water refill GO!  And then wet your lips.  A - stonishing displays.  The food is prepped so that it looks ... beyewtiful.  You don't even want to bust into it since it's an art piece in itself.  Z - ero cool.   Yeah, you didn't think I had a good phrase for \"Z\" did ya.  I believe this restaurant used to be another Asian place but they re-did it as this Japanese restaurant and it definitely has been done up better than the rest.  E - xcellence.  I can't describe the amount of fun I had that night.   At a business dinner.  A BIZNESS DINNAH.  That's what hospitality is all about, and Kumi definitely made a great showing of it.  D - electable.  Did I mention what I mentioned in my A's?   There's a chicken dish that you taste it and you swear up and down it's so juicy in the white meats that it's like duck.  You always have heard that it \"tastes like chicken\" but what?  Have you ever heard chicken... \"tasting like duck\"?  I haven't.  But I've experienced it.",

    "text": "This was an amazing experience.  Talk about WOW!  The food is amazing.  The executive chef, Akira Back...really did a fine job with the menu.  We were there with a birthday party including kids so we were high maintenance, but service too was top-notch.  (Whenever you got up from the table, the server was there to fold your napkin neatly...having it ready for you when you returned).  I believe our server was named Michael...if I recall correctly.  He was just such a nice server.    Ok onto food... WOW, Speechless!  I don't know where to start.  We had spicy miso soup, tuna pizza, tuna tacos, salmon tiradito, yellowtail serrano, a huge Sakana platter of assorted sushi & sashimi, quinoa with tiger shrimp with yuzu vinaigrette and lastly, it was a scallop dish (I don't remember the name)...it had barley and edamame in it.  Oh and one more...we had the pork bao buns...that was PERFECT!! Anyway...as you can see we had a nice assortment...EVERYTHING was very good.  Sushi was so fresh.  I loved how the sushi rice was so perfect and just the right size.  (Sometimes, sushi is so big...but traditionally I believe sushi should be one bite size).  I really could go into each dish and describe them...but then you'd read a novel.  I really can't say anything bad about Kumi.  The whole experience was truly epic.  Such a great meal.  I would like to go every day! LOL!",

Everything from the Hostess to the Appetizers & Entrees & Servers were all Top Notch! The Server that Waited on a Table of 12 was Very Efficient & Quick, Explained Everything to us because None of us had ever Eaten there Before...lol!   I Should Point Out and Say that What we had is NOT the Norm here, I do have a Relative that works there, So we got the \"Special Treatment\" hehehe! I am basing my Review on the Food, and the Experience Only!   Everything that we had from the Endless Appetizers, to the Entrees & Dessert were all On Point! What I Especially Loved about this Whole Experience was the way Each Dish was Explained as it Arrived on the Table. So you didn't have to guess what it was! Sorry guys I'm not used to eating in such a High End Restaurant, also not sure if the Waiters explain the Dishes like they did here, lol. Anyway, I Digress....  The Ambiance was Very Warm, and Cozy! There were some Booths along the Back wall of the Restaurant, and a Bar where you can see your Dishes being made while eating at the Bar. There is a Lounge area for you to sit while you are waiting for your Table, and Restrooms are available in the Restaurant as well, so you don't have to go out into the casino to Hunt for One!  The Restaurant is not Enclosed, so if you want to eat while people watching, you can...lol!   I could explain EVERY Dish that My Family & I Ate, but that would take me Forever and a Day to Try to, So I'm going to Say This...You Just Have to Try it For Yourself!!!  Until Next Review...Sayonara!",

We had a party of 7 and the staff was very attentive and seemed to work together well. We tried several appetizers.... peppers and tuna were standouts for me. The salmon nigiri literally melted in my mouth. All of the fish cuts were some of the best I have had. We shared several sushi rolls and they were all really outstanding. The pop rockin definitely stole the show for us. The sensation of the pop rocks was hilarious to watch everyone experience for the first time. But really the flavor of the roll was amazing. Great atmosphere and evening all around!",

The food here was soooo good. And the Kobe Tacos??? AMAZING. Seriously, I have never had tacos solo FLAVORFUL! WHOA!   Ok, so we started with the pot stickers. VERY good, unique crust on the pot stickers that was very good. Then we had the Kobe tacos...like I said, AMAZING. Omg. Then I had ordered the California rolls as I am not a huge sushi fan. Really good. Not bland at all. My husband is a foodie and loves sushi and he said he normally does not like Ca rolls, because they are so plan and basic, but he said the flavor was pretty good. Then we had a spicy tuna roll which was also really good. Presentation was nice and the flavor was impacting. Lastly, we had the \"hot mess.\" Waiter said that is the favorite dish here, and I can see why. Lots of flavor, really good, and the presentation was nice too.   So, long story short. Not too expensive. Not too crowded. And good food. Fast service. Friendly service. Good drinks. And great food. The only reason why I didn't give 5 stars is because the portions were a little small. I guess that's the American in me wanting more food. Lol. But seriously, will definitely be back here next time at Mandalay Bay",

    "text": "Wow where to start.. well let's start with the the sushi bar. First off the sushi bar is the highest I have ever sat at. And the chairs they have are horrible. Way to hard to get seated in and make a horrible sound when you need to back the chair up and get out. That was par for the course. The sushi here is extremely over priced for what you actually get. Not sure why the reviews are so good maybe they are not real reviews. But let me tell you mine is  percent . The rolls are nothing special. Lacking fish in all rolls. The fish was nothing to write home about . Yellow tail roll with green onions. It's not even whole pieces of yellow tail. It's Just minced up yellow tail and such a small amount at that . $12 roll and it was tiny as hell. They have really skimped on the fish and honestly the quality of the fish did not warrent the price they ask. I am a pro fisherman I go on long rang trips and catch giant bluefin tuna,yellow tail, opah and other pelegic fish. So I know quality fish when I see it and taste. The sushi inside the refrigerator at the bar looked very sad and also they did not have sliding door to keep the fish cold. The fish was sitting inside a chilled refrigerator but every place I have been to has a door that opens and closes so that the temperature stay consistent in between grabbing slabs of fish. That was a big red flag for me. I have eaten at some pretty good places from all you can eat all the way to semi fancy sushi places . And this place ranks on the bottom of the list . I have had all you can eat for $30 bucks and this place could not even come close to the quality and taste of the ayce places I have been too. The sushi chefs at the bar are not super friendly or fun . Basically just getting paid hourly and looked like they could not wait to get the hell out of there.  One guy was like 80 years old and didn't look like he was in any kind of shape to be standing and making sushi for long periods. This place is smoke and mirrors. Yes it's inside Mandalay Bay and it's got that yuppie feel. That doesn't mean shit once you see the food. Seriously how can they even justify the prices based on the portions and quality. Needless to say I would never spend money at this place ever again or recommend this place to a True sushi enthusiast or even a rookie. If you don't believe me just sit down and give it a whirl and trust me $100 bucks will get you a few rolls averaging $12-25 bucks and sushi @ $10-30 bucks and if you want something special look out ur looking at more money!! You will leave this place either very broke or still hungry. Don't believe the hype people!!",

The atmosphere is upscale but still very inviting. We had rock shrimp, calamari with their homemade sauce (TO DIE FOR), kobe beef tacos which were different but had a tang to them yet still good, pop rockin sushi roll (I won't spoil the surprise but a MUST HAVE), and tuna tataki. For drinks I \"sampled\" a green geisha it's good but you have to love cucumbers. If you are a foodie and love presentation definitely try Kumi!!",

    "text": "We had an excellent meal at Kumi. Super expensive, so I have a suggestion for you to spend less than we did and still have a great meal.  We had a large party of 11, so our main server, Greg, suggested the omakase menu, which means you leave it up to the server/kitchen to bring you what they think is best and then they charge you for what you eat. We had people in our group who don't eat sushi, shellfish, spicy food, etc., etc., so Greg said they could accommodate that. What ended up happening is that we had about 12 dishes come for the table, in multiples of 2 or 3 plates, and then an additional 5-6 dishes come for individuals with special preferences.  With drinks, this added up to a little more than $200/person (dinner/drinks/tip).  Wow! Thankfully, this was on the company dime, but still, that seems crazy.  If you don't want to spend $200/person, I would suggest you eat here and still do an omakase menu, but restrict the server to a number of dishes you think you would have gotten if you were ordering on your own. If I had to do it again, I would still order for the table, so everyone could sample different dishes, but for eleven people, I would ask the server to bring a combination of 5 cool/warm plates (2-3 orders each for the table) and 3 entrees (2-3 orders for the table and have them cut up the chicken/lamb chops/beef for sharing). After that, if people were still hungry, I would order more.  Better yet, if you have a large party and you have someone who can put together a menu, you can plan the menu in advance so you end up with the equivalent of 3 dishes per person in terms of cost and have the right spread of food that will accommodate your party's particular tastes. I do so below as an example of what I would do.  The service was attentive and excellent.  I've  noticed other reviewers complain about service.  I'm not sure if our service was good, partly because we let the kitchen/Greg pick what they brought to the table.  It may be another argument for doing the omakase menu.  Here's what Greg ended up sending to the table, and you will see it was an exercise in excess:  Crispy rice with seared tuna and screaming O sauce: this is EXCELLENT. I would recommend ordering this.  If people don't like sauce, tell them not to pour it over the tuna.  The sauce is great, creamy and a little spicy.  Yellowtail serrano in yuzu sauce. Another excellent dish.  I would order this again.  Seared abalone in onion ginger sauce. Not a favorite for the table.  I would not order this again.  Seaweed salad.  I love seaweed, but people didn't really eat this at all.  Rock shrimp tempura. Very good.  Miso black cod.  Very good.    Salmon. Good, but if I picked between the cod and salmon, I would get the cod.  Toban filet with mushrooms.  This was popular at the table. We love beef!   Sashimi tray.  This was very good, but by the time it came, we were sashimi-ed/seafood-ed out.  It was a waste on top of the seared tuna, yellowtail serrano, and seared abalone mentioned above.  Lobster with butter.  People loved this.  For the people who didn't like what was coming to the table ...  1got Colorado lamb chop -- Delicious and perfectly cooked.  People who were on her end of the table ate off her plate, as she shared.  1 got the chicken -- Delicious. The skin was particularly crispy.  1 got a cucumber salad -- crisp and light, mushroom roll -- perfectly executed, eggplant -- this is awesomely flavorful and worth ordering, veggie tempura -- looked good, but I didn't try it.  If I had to do it over again, I would plan out the menu myself in advance for this large a party and tell them what we wanted.  In our case, for a crowd that prefers meat to fish and based on what I now know from our expansive dinner, I would do the following for our party of 11:  COLD DISHES  Crispy rice with seared tuna and screaming O sauce (3 orders)  Yellowtail serrano in yuzu sauce (2 orders)  House salad or cucumber salad (2 orders) -- just to have some veggies  Pop rocks roll (2 orders) -- I've read this on other reviews and would like to try it.  Pork belly roll (2 orders) -- I've read this on other reviews and would like to try it.  WARM PLATES  Rock shrimp tempura  (2 orders)  Veggie tempura (1 order -- for the non-shellfish eater in the group)  Crispy calamari (3 orders)  Kimchi edamame (2 orders)  Gyooza (3 orders)  Japanese eggplant (3 orders)  Lobster with butter (3 orders)   ENTREES   Seared beef with mushrooms (2 orders)  Jidori Chicken (2 orders)  Colorado Lamb Chop (2 orders)  With this type of ordering, it adds up to about 3 dishes per person -- still pricey but manageable.  For drinks, I think beer and sake are best with Japanese food.  We got two bottles of the Dragon Slayer sake, which was excellent.",

The meal at Kumi was so amazing that I felt compelled to write a review, even though it's been a couple months!  Each and every dish we tried deserved 5 stars and everything was beautifully plated.  I have had Miso Eggplant at a number of restaurants, but none of them come close to the way it is prepared here.  I still dream about it so I keep trying it at various local restaurants, but am repeatedly sorely disappointed.  Kumi's version melts in your mouth and is a perfect balance of sweet and savory. The Yellowtail Serrano was fresh, vibrant, and absolutely perfect. But, the dish that blew me away was the Miso Black Cod.  Many restaurants attempt it, and none (that I've tried) nail it like these guys do.  Best I've ever had, hands down!  Seasoned perfectly and the fish is cooked to just the right degree (not too dry, which tends to be my complaint).  I would be willing to go back to Vegas for Kumi's Miso Black Cod alone!",

Being sushi fanatics, we ordered an borderline-obnoxious amount of spicy tuna rolls, various maki and sashimi and I have to say... BEST SUSHI I'VE EVER HAD!   The service we received was exceptional. The only critique I have is that our waiter was coming off a little \"salesy\" at first, trying to push certain drinks and dishes our way. This could very well have been due to the fact that he was new and was still trying to find his voice.  I was surprised by how fast the dishes arrived at our table. This allowed us to try more things off the menu and overall made the evening more enjoyable. Kumi is definitely a place I'd recommend to anyone staying at Mandalay Bay!",

If I go back again, I'd actually ask to do so because it was super interesting to watch them make the rolls, and the guys who work there are very nice. You're able to order off of the full menu when seated there, so you don't miss out on anything.  We ended up having edamame, fried calamari, and two rolls to share between two people. Everything was really, really good. I'm not a fried foods fan, but that calamari was incredible (especially whatever that sauce was - I wish I could buy it in a bottle)! We had the Kumikaze roll, which was a little spicy (which I enjoy), and the sushi chef made me a Rainbow Roll even though it's not on the menu just because I mentioned it's my favorite. Those two, with the appetizers, were perfect for two peoples' meal. Without an appetizer, I'd recommend three for sure.  If I'm back at MB around dinnertime in the future, I'd definitely go back again.",

This place is a high end japanese restaurant so don't expect to order the way you might at AYCE. For example, the miso soup alone is $6 and a small bottle of sake is about $50. But it's definitely quality over quantity. To start off, the fish is super fresh here (obviously or it wouldn't be so expensive). I give them points for creativity and as some dishes were delightfully surprising, some were plain out wrong (to me, of course).  For starter plates, definitely try the miso cod (don't be shocked by the size, I was told it's considerably large). It was cooked perfectly! Melts in your mouth like butter. The seared tuna on top of crispy rice is good too. I wasn't a fan of the crispy rice part but the tuna was yummy. Their rolls are really the stars there. Rolls you should order for sure: hot mess, fireball (hot!), pork belly and toro with scallions. Do not order the pop rock roll! It was recommended to us, and although I understand the concept is to have the watermelon pop rocks compliment the sushi, it did nothing but remind me that I was eating candy with sushi! I never liked pop rocks as a kid and I didn't like it in my dinner. Atmosphere was nice and elegant. Service was impeccable. The hostess was really sweet about helping us with a high chair for my nephew and putting us at a good table. The server was helpful and recommended as best as she could. Even the food runners are really polite in presenting your dish.  Tip: They said it's a kid friendly place when we called ahead but to be honest it's not. It's great for a girls night out or a date.",

We were seated and of course,  we had the unfortunate experience of a half naked,  stripper looking girl seated just besude us.  I complained to our waiter but he said,  this is vegas and there is not much we can do.   That's a bunch of b.s.  I've been to plenty of fine dining establishments in Vegas and never saw this before.  If she wasn't acting in an explicit manner it would've been ok.   But remember we had two young girls with us.    Moving on,  we ordered the hot mess, which our waiter ranted and raved about,  but never brought it out nor did he come and ask how our food was or if were missing something?  Yes idiot you forgot our hot mess.   Also ordered fillet mingon, salmon, chicken,  and rib eye.  All portions were ectremely tiny.  So if you're starved this won't cut it.   For the money we spent i wouldve expected much better food and service.   The worst part of all, we got our food in intervals.  So we didn't all get to enjoy our dinner together as a family.  Instead we watched one eat while the other waited for theirs.  Waste of money,  will never go to kumi and will NEVER recommend this place to any of my cali friends who frequent vegas a lot.

    "text": "Very good fish, for a price.   Service started out very well with Paul our waiter explaining the approach to the fish and the menu to us. He was extremely knowledgeable and articulate about the different types of fish, meats and preparation. Very sharp guy. Realizing his knowledge we told him what we liked and let him pick some dishes for us to try. His reccomendtions were quite varied: Hot mess, Yellowtail, Tuna, Kumu Mari, Kobe Beef and Yuzu Mushrooms.  All of them were fantastic! However if you go to Kumi you must have the hot mess! The roll is piled high with crab and diced fish and drizzled with a spicy sauce they call the O sauce. Oh my. We ended up ordering one for everyone at the table. The yellowtail is also excellent. Served with a ponzu sauce and peppers it has a nice balance of sweet and acidic.  Great food, not cheap by any measure but if you are looking for excellent sashimi and a very nice experience this is the place to visit.",

I came in for a drink and the bartender was awful.  He seemed like he hates working here.  I waited 20 mins for a drink.  I was disgusted and waited another 20 mins for my check.  Light group should make this establishment go dark.",

    "text": "So my 2 stars might seems a little sketchy, but I just can't give this place more. Although the food was extremely delicious, the prices are outrageous!!! I don't mind spending a lot on food, but $32 for about 5oz of salmon and nothing else on my plate it's ridiculous! Yes it tasted great, but for $32 I expected at least a side dish. It was just salmon smothered in teriyaki sauce. We had the pureed potatoes and those were heavenly. Overall very good tasting meal, but way to expensive. There's many other places I'd choose to eat over Kumi. Also, the service was terrible. Our entire table was of servers so we know how to give great service. Our server was extremely rude and short with us. Not the best way to ensure any guest will ever come back.... We definitely wouldn't head back.",

    "text": "Very disappointing. I was anticipating some fabulous food from Akira Back. The portions were small relative to the price, and there was nothing special or really unusual. $18 for all mixed cocktails, $35 for 2 sashimi slices of O Toro, $29 for a 5oz piece of Cod with miso appetizer, etc. And we even asked our waiter about the sizes of the portions of what we ordered beforehand, as the prices seemed so high. I wouldn't have minded the fact that it was incredibly expensive if the quality, taste and creativity matched. Unfortunately, we left feeling robbed and hungry!",

    "text": "The tuna options in the apps section could cause anyone's head to spin but we got the seared albacore at the waitress' recommendation and it was just amazing. The Kobe beef tacos were just the right size and flavored well. I really enjoyed the 007 roll that used cucumber as the wrapper and the octopus on top was delish! The calamari was a bit greasy for me but the accompanying dip was great. And you can't beat a cucumber salad to accompany your meal. We changed wait staff during our meal and service became spotty but the restaurant has a great atmosphere nonetheless.",

    "text": "Overall this was a great experience. We ordered the miso black cod, the toban filet, the eel roll and several other pretty standard rolls.  The toban filet with mushrooms just melts in your mouth and the cod was fantastic. Our server was Rachel and she was attentive friendly and helpful. It was fairly expensive but to be expected given its location in the Mandalay Bay Hotel.",
