    "text": "Very positive experience here. I ordered the burnt ends and ribs with potato salad. The ribs were juicy, meaty, and flavorful. The potato salad has bacon mixed in with it. It would be fine without the bacon, but who's saying no to a little bacon flavor. The first couple of bites of the ends were good. Then I started running into some fatty pieces, much too fatty to eat. I would guess 1/3 of the tips were too fatty. The rest of my meal was excellent. Before I left, I told the help it was all good but they might want to know too many of the tips were full of fat. I wanted no refund and it was not a complaint as much as I liked my dining experience and wanted them to know so they could avoid that experience for someone else. A gentleman working in the kitchen heard the conversation and said I had to let him make good on it. I told him I didn't want anything and I wasn't upset. He still wouldn't let me go unless I'd take another order of tips, promising they'd be great. He ended up giving me a 1/4 lb of burnt ends, peach cobbler, and ice cream to go. He went way above and beyond to do me right. And the new burnt ends were excellent. This place has some of the best BBQ in LV and they treat their customers right.",

Firstly, I didn't get that fresh off the grill taste, so that makes me doubt the meat is actually cooked there. Secondly, my mouth was watering for the corn nuggets and I was given some that seemed to have been sitting a little too long. So, I won't count Rollin' Smoke out entirely, just this location.",

The ribs were satisfying/decent as the meat fell right off the bone. The hot link did lack some flavor, while the brisket completely tasted off. The corn bread was moist but had a oddly strange taste to it. It also included one side which I got french fries which were pretty good. Overall paid like 19 dollars for mediocre plate with no drink included.",

First visit was mix plate of quarter chicken and 2 Ribs. Ribs were OK, not great. Chicken was dry but edible. Second visit was Ribs and pulled pork. Again, ribs were OK and the pulled pork was pretty good, but again nothing special. Last night got just a pork sandwich with a side of Mac-n-Cheese the lady recommended. Got home and opened container to see not a BBQ sandwich but a BBQ hoagie.  Absolutely atrocious. A hoagie changes the texture and flavor of the sandwich and is too much bread.  I paid $9.99 for a plate of bread with a few tablespoons of meat. In full disclosure I was raised in the deep South where exceptional BBQ is found on every street. If you're looking for a clean place that is better than most options available in Las Vegas, it's a good option.",

Anyways, we decided to give it another try but this time we ordered The Outlaw Burger and The Big Hawg, they were delicious! My boyfriend said the outlaw burger was the best burger he has ever had and I enjoyed my sandwich too. However, I wish their sauces were a little thicker.

Loved the chicken, delicious and moist.  No need of any sauce on the side for it. There was a huge portion of shredded pork. Lean, so a little dry for my palate, but sauce can go a long way to remedy that. Flavor of meat was okay, no where near as flavorful as the chicken. Sauces were unexpectedly thin in consistency. I don't eat sweet sauces, so the Arkansauce and spicy were what I tried. Vinegary with heat. Flavor not rich like a thicker sauce would be, but not bad. The coleslaw was tasty, different from standard as it had corn in it that I could do without. Husband had beef ribs. Very meaty and large. He liked the meat itself, but was unimpressed with the sauce. He tried out one of the sweet ones and the Carolina vinegar, both runny like what I tried. His side salad was fresh and the chipotle dressing was quite tasty. Will be happy to go back for the chicken.",

An old Vegas classic with new locations in the Valley I had no excuse not to stop in and feast on some of the finest smoked brisket around. My friend wanted to order everything on the menu and insisted I order the outlaw burger so I did. The first thing they asked me is if I was sure I wanted to order it (because it's huge) I proceeded. Be afraid not my burger eating friends. The fried onions makes the object appear closer than it is ! Give it a solid press down and go to work.  First things first I actually didn't even see or taste burger it was more of a meatloaf burger which was very easy to eat so don't be scared ! If the meatloaf was on top of an actual hamburger I wouldn't be mad.  This place had great service these dudes are on it. And if yer a dude you wouldn't be mad that they had the football game on (NFL Network) I give this place 4 1/2 stars the only thing I'd say is I wish they sold was beer but I can understand why because I would never leave.",

I ordered take out of:  a two meat meal with a side of dirty rice. Then a piece of catfish, and a half pound of rib tips.  Overall the food was good, but it is not my favorite for BBQ nor my favorite for fried catfish here in Las Vegas.  The service was very good, and the food was prepared in a timely manner.  The prices were what I consider on the high end for BBQ.  The meal includes lettuce, a piece of plain white bread, pickles and BBQ sauce of your choice; and the dirty rice was the one side I chose from a listing of several options.  The one piece of catfish (which I consider pricey) also came with one piece of plain white bread, lemon wedges pickles and tartar sauce.  I would have preferred just one piece of catfish at a cheaper price.  You can sit and eat in; it's similar to a diner atmosphere with a self serve beverage bar. Would I go back?  Yes, but only if it were more convenient than going to the other restaurants that I prefer [for BBQ and catfish].",

The ribs here are the True definition of finger lickin' good (;   To top off the ridiculously great food, customer service @ this location was over the top! I come in for lunch on a Sunday afternoon with a semi big party & we received exceptional service from the moment we walked in until we were ready to go. We had multiple employees check on us during our visit which I totally wasn't expecting from a small restaurant like this.   As far as the size of portions, huge!!!!! Sitting between my mom and fiance, we chose to order two things & share, family style. We opted for the Brisket 3 Ways Smokin' Plate & the Rib Platter Special. After we were completely satisfied and full, we had about 2 full containers of left overs. SoOo sharing with someone is definitely an option when coming here (:   OH! & there's a pretty decent variety of bbq sauces available & all pair very well with both the ribs and brisket. MY personal favorite was the sweet country girl but all were available to try near the beverage station (:",

So I decided to go to the one on Grand Canyon and Flamingo store, I ordered the following:  St Louis Style Ribs full rack: This was great, tender and smoked well  Beef Ribs half rack: This was so moist and tender by far the winner form everything we ordered. The last time I had this was at the Highland store and it was so dry and tasted like it was yesterdays smoked meats.   Pulled Pork 1/2 LB: Moist and flavorful, really tasty  Brisket 1 LB: It would be better but all they gave me was most of the fat cap, so thats really disappointing.   Rib Tips 1/2 lb: Dry Dry Dry - don't bother   BBq Beans Quart: Beans were still hard, had great flavor but a waste of money  Mac and Cheese Quart: This was the saddest mac and cheese, it clumped together and it felt like you were just eating dough  Corn Bread 12 slices: Id order this alone, this was so good!   So I ordered take out and this cost me over $150, I asked for a quart for the sides which was $12.00 but was charged for 2 pints at $7.00 each x 4 on the BBQ Beans and Mac and Cheese? WTF? The food is either good or not so now that I know which is good and which isnt I know what Ill be ordering next time I come here. Not that I would come back anytime soon. The prices are way way over priced for the quality and amount of food.   There are other really good and tasty BBQ joints out here that I would rather go to.",

    "text": "I usually get the 5 meat combo or ribs combo from this place. They seriously know their bbq. All the meat is melt-in-your-mouth tender. Highly recommend the corn nuggets. That is my all-time favorite side dish. This location delivers (I'm not sure if the other one does?) which is a plus in my book! The last time I had them i ordered delivery and everything tasted great except the banana pudding. I don't know if maybe it had been packaged earlier and been sitting in a fridge for a few hours but I wasn't a fan of the consistency. I had ordered the bread pudding before when I was at the restaurant and I remembered it tasted better there. So the lesson is: don't order the banana pudding for delivery.",

Worst \"BBQ\" I've ever had and not worth it at all. I had to glob on hot sauce and fish sauce just to stomach it.  I ordered the chicken sliders kids meal for my daughter and they put hot sauce on it so she didn't even want to touch it!  The Mac and cheese is possibly the worst I've ever had, Kraft looks gourmet in comparison.  Also, I ordered on DoorDash. It was 8 minutes from the store to my door and the food was cold. I hope health inspectors shut this place down.  I'm so disappointed. Total waste of time and money! Just don't.",

We decided to order the full order of the beef ribs,  Mac n cheese, loaded mashed potatoes, and the blueberry cobbler.  When I say their beef rib was soooo soft and fell off the bone (even for a to go order I was shocked) and it was just so juicy! The pieces themselves are thick with a good amount of meat on it. My husband and I were able to share it. He LOVES the charred parts of the ends of the ribs as well. We usually go to Lucille's, but I'm glad we tried out this place cause our mind was blown.  I loved the mac n cheese (I am not a fan of large pepper corn pieces) so that was my only struggle with it. The mashed potatoes was amazing as well.  The blueberry cobbler was different from other cobblers my husband has had, but he loved it!",

It comes with a choice of a side, so I chose the coleslaw. The coleslaw has a bit of a kick to it, which I enjoy. Last time, my friends really really really enjoyed their loaded mash. Service is awesome; location is awesome. What more could I ask for?  Also they have a lot of different sauces in bottles that you can just help yourself to. My personal favorite is the Arkansauce. The one with mustard is a close runner up!",

I can't believe they sent me 2 extremely small bones that were actually smaller than the spare ribs that came. Better yet couldn't even eat the beef ribs they were burned to a crisp . Very disappointed in the quality of meat they sent. I'd have to say the corn bread was very good , pulled pork was ok, spare ribs were extremely dried out . Beef ribs was the biggest disappointment.",

This new location is going fast food which is more important to them than quality. I ordered a large order and they told me it would be ready in 10 minutes. It was obviously pre cooked and tasted like any other fast food BBQ. you guys had a good thing going, but fooling your customers is more important to you. Shame on you.",

And I always look for the pink smoke ring in the meat. Glad to say I didn't have sauce it. And the brisket had a nice pink smoke ring in it.  Cornbread, hush puppies and corn nuggets are great sides.   Thank you Bryan ( that's Bryan with a Y ) and your crew for great food!   Don't forget o take your drink glass and get a buck off your next visit with it.",

The ribs were very tender and great flavor. The meatloaf was very tasty and the mashed potatoes yummy! Loved the fried onions on the meal and the sauce that was with it. The dirty rice was very flavorful and even with a bit of a zing.. the beans were great .. the one thing we were a bit disappointed in was the peach cobbler. It didn't have the wow factor as the rest of the meal, and only included 2 small peach slices in the container.  Will we eat here again? Absolutely!

The reason I only gave 4 stars was for 2 reasons ....1) They only have 1 bathroom that you must share w men....gross  & 2) be prepared for long wait times to get your food! 4 of the guys ordered the all you can eat for $34.99 which I think is a little stout for BBQ . That's $75 if you & your spouse go to dinner, $80 w 2 drinks....that's a lot for BBQ . $25 a head would be a little more reasonable . My husband ordered a slab of beef ribs (you only get 4 large ribs) a pint of potato salad & he got a drink. I had water & the total came to $48. I don't eat much so I didn't want to order a meal...I told him I would just pick off his plate, but I thought his ribs were too burnt & tough on top of rib & was too hard for me to chew, so he ordered me a catfish Poboy which took about 15-20 min to get. The bottom of the rib was very tender & flavorful ...I wouldn't order beef ribs there, I'll try the pork babybacks next time ! If you love BBQ ...you must try this place ! You'll never go anywhere else! The food is absolutely delicious & worth waiting for! Next time I'll try the store @ Grand Canyon...it's only about a mile from my house.",

I gotta say I was very disappointed in the ribs. I thought they were a bit dry and the bbq sauce was not good. Very thin and too mild. A good bbq sauce is the foundation of great bbq. Come on Rollin Smoke! Y'all need to go back to the kitchen and come up with a new recipe. The brisket was dry. The greens were subpar. The catfish and Mac n cheese was ok. The prices were really high for the amount of food you get. There's way better bbq spots out there. I won't be back.",

We arrived at 7:37 pm, walked in and realized that they closed at 8 but now understood why that girl looked at us with a mad dog face.  They were about to close and now they were upset because we were eating in.  The people before us got great service as they were being offered to try sauces etc (maybe because they got their food to go).  Someone came in at 7:57 pm and got food to go. They were nice - told them thank you so much, have a good night.  I left a $8 tip off a $50 bill and all they did was bring our food.  I'm not complaining about it because I always give tip at these kind of joints.  For them to throw the food in front of us and not tell us enjoy your meal etc, I will not return.  The food came out quick but it was not hot.  It probably would have been more enjoyable if our food was hot.  But we weren't going to tell them because they were not welcoming from the beginning.  There are a lot of BBQ places I can go to fulfill my BBQ cravings with better personality. A great personality goes a long way with my family.  We didn't even get a bye or good night.  We left 8 minutes after closing.  And lastly, I even cleaned my table for you!!!!",

    "text": "Back at the end of 2014 we visited the Rollin Smoke BBQ on Highland Dr and were blown away by its greatness. I wrote a glowing Yelp review about its fantastic smoked meat and great value and I spread the word to all who would listen saying they've got to get up there and experience this wonderful BBQ for themselves. Ever since we've been meaning to get back to Rollin Smoke on one of our very frequent trips to Vegas.   When we're back in town between October and April we always spend time hiking in Red Rock Canyon, so imagine our delight when we learned that Rollin Smoke had opened a new location just a few minutes south of Red Rock off Flamingo and 215. We were going to be able to spend all morning hiking then have a killer BBQ lunch at the new Rollin Smoke.   When we arrived around 1:30pm there were only a couple of people in the restaurant. I decided I wanted to try one of their \"world famous\" beef ribs and some burnt ends so I chose the 2-meat \"Duo\" that included one side for $13.99. The beef rib substitution added an additional $6.00 to the plate and the burnt ends added another $3.00, so the $13.99 Duo was now costing me $22.99. Not a problem for the kind of BBQ I remembered from 2014, plus BBQ beef ribs are typically very large. I chose green beans for my side. My GF ordered the Duo plate with two spare ribs and burnt ends. She chose coleslaw as her side and she ordered an extra side of potato salad.  Our food was brought out to us and a sense of disbelief and disappointment set in. The beef rib was only about as large as one of the spare ribs, and it was more than half fat. Not just any fat, but partially cooked, unrendered fat. As I pulled this fat out of the beef rib with my plastic fork it came out in globs with long strings attached.   I realized that if we break a $13.99 Duo plate down into its component costs and we use $1.99 for the side to make the math easy, then each of the two standard meats on the Duo plate cost $6.00. The $6.00 upcharge for the beef rib meant I was paying $12.00 for this little beef rib that was mostly partially cooked fat.  The burnt ends were even worse. The $3.00 upcharge for these meant I was paying $9.00 for a few cubes of what turned out to be 90% fat, and most of the cubes were ALL fat and zero meat. This was completely unacceptable and I had to lug my tray back up to the counter to show them what they had served me. The lady at the counter was very nice and immediately replaced the burnt ends with some that included some meat, but somebody at Rollin Smoke needs to go back to basic BBQ school and learn that burnt ends are NOT cubes of unrendered fat.  My GF's two spare ribs were just fair and tasted like they had been cooked yesterday. She ate only one and gave the other one to me. It too had a large amount of unrendered fat and I left it alone after a couple of bites.. The green beans had a seasoning on them that was so salty we just left it alone. The slaw and potato salad were nothing special and certainly nothing like the sides we had at their original location.  Our lunch cost about $50.00. For this we got 2 mediocre spare ribs and a super-fatty beef rib of the same size, two small piles of burnt ends that were mostly fat, and 3 forgettable sides.   So much for BBQ greatness and spectacular value. This was the biggest food ripoff we've ever experienced in Vegas, and we've pretty much seen it all.  The silver lining in all of this is when we were finding the new Rollin Smoke we discovered a Famous Daves BBQ only a block away. So we can still get a BBQ lunch after we hike. It just ain't gonna be at Rollin Fat (er, I mean Smoke.)  My 2014 review of the Highland Ave location will stay in place because at one time in the past Rollin Smoke really was great.",

As soon as I got off work I ran to the new location not even thinking of what time they closed. I arrived at the location all excited to get food and asked if they were still open, they replied they closed at 8 (it was 8:30ish) but would still take my order. They were so sweet, took my order no problem and the food was amazing and fresh when I got it home. I work in the service industry and I know how frustrating it can be to get people in after closing (or even close to closing) but they were so welcoming just seems like a really great team. I will definitely be back (during hours of operation) lol. I will also be sure to refer anyone I know. Thanks Rollin smoke!!",

Everything here is amazing from the perfectly smoked meats (brisket, chicken, pulled pork, homemade hot links, and more) to their sweet and spicy sides (mac and cheese is a must!) the corn nuggets are my favorite and the homemade chipotle coleslaw has just the right kick. Genuine brewed sweet tea and homemade sauces to throw on those ribs. If you're a Carolina BBQ fan you've gotta have their Carolina sauce. Mike the GM and his wife are such down to earth people who know southern hospitality.  This is our new go to BBQ spot!",

The staff are extremely personable and funny and very patient because with all of these options ( and the smell of smoked meat) I had no idea what I wanted. I ended up ordering a brisket sandwich with a side of collard greens. I was a little put off because the brisket was chopped but the flavor was AMAZING but to be honest my favorite part was the collard greens. Ummm I'm a black woman and I'm very discriminatory about green and let me tell you!!!!! These are probably the best greens I've had in a restaurant ever!! The greens have brisket in them (need I say more?) the 5 Stars are well earned and I'd recommend this spot to everyone who wants some delicious bbq.",

    "text": "First time eating at a Rollin Smoke per suggestion of my father in law. He was always a fan of the OG place on Highland Dr? The menu was pretty simple & they had good platter selections.  My only complaint was that our food wasn't hot? It was warm, as if it's been sitting out & they put it on a plate. I know I like my food to be steaming so I know that it's fresh, or that they took the time to cook it, or that it was in a proper warming container. Just some food for thought.  Drinks are $3, but it's because the cups are also souvenir cups. They have Coke products, iced tea & a Keurig machine which was super fancy btw.   Not a fan of all their sauces, but don't take that into account I'm not much of a BBQ person.  I ordered duo meat with sliced brisket & pork with a side of Mac n cheese & bacon potato salad (my favorite). Hubby had same duo meat combo w/ spare ribs & sliced brisket, sides were corn bread (tasted great, but dry) & waffle fries (had a sweet-ish taste). FIL got the whole beef ribs, which were huge but not fall-off-the-bone juicy & the baked potato with bacon, cheese, sour cream & green onions. And lastly, bro-in-law had a duo meat combo as well with corn bread & Mac n cheese.  All of the good tasted good, but I just wish it came out hot! Will try the OG place on Highland and compare.",

He then told me there was nothing he could do and referred me to Grubhub. In addition to being the wrong order, the food was cold. All around bad experience, and the food I received was terrible. It does narrow down the places I order from...that's positive.",

    "text": "My family and I love this place.  Not that we don't like other barbecue joints, but this is where we go when we're home and want to get full of some of the best.  We were excited when this location opened over here on the west side.  I've tried all the meats, many of the sides, and my wife is addicted to the Outlaw Burger.  Here are a few of our favorites from the menu:  The Outlaw Burger:  since I mentioned it, this bad boy is ground beef mixed with brisket, onions and bell peppers.  Then, because that's not enough deliciousness, they pile on some cheese, red cabbage slaw and a few other goodies, along with a crazy delicious sauce.  By the way, it's huge.  In fact, if you order it to go, they lay the toppings and bun down sideways in the to go box.  The Trio Plate:  your choice of three meats from the delicious five they have on the menu (brisket, pork, chicken, spare ribs and hot links).  My favorites are the brisket, pork, and spare ribs.  If you're not famished, you'll take about half of this home for later.  And since I mentioned brisket:  you can get this chopped, sliced.  Sliced is my favorite.  Finally, if you or your kiddo just wants a burger without all the \"outlaw\", their Lil Bitty Piggy Hamburger Meal is really a regular sized burger with fries.  (By regular I mean a normal human adult size.)  The burger is as amazing as everything else on the menu.  When you go, keep in mind the dine-in area at this location is really small.  If you're going with intent to eat there, be prepared to either wait for a table, or to fall back to telling them your order is to go.  It's definitely not a place for a larger group either.  There are tables for 2-4, and if you happen to be there when there aren't many other customers (a rarity!), you can push tables together.  But be mindful that you're taking very scarce seating away from the small groups, couples or singles who come in and want to sit and eat--this location really isn't best for larger groups.  You'll know what to do when you walk in and can make your decision about eating in or taking your order to go before you get to the counter to order.  The line to order at the counter forms on the left as you walk in, with a respectably large menu over the counter as you approach.  You can also grab a copy of the menu to read in line or to go with you if you prefer.  Regardless, whether you eat in or take out, the food is amazing.  Napkins and utensils are on the wall to the right of the counter.  Most of the dishes come with barbecue sauce, but there's more on the table.  By the way, they make their own sauces--six of them.  Don't miss out; be sure to try them all.  If you live on the west side and haven't tried Rollin' Smoke, be sure to go.  Your mouth will be happy, I promise!",

    "text": "First time trying Rollin Smoke BBQ and was absolutely amazed at the food as well as the staff! The smell alone takes me back to when I was down south, the notes of honey and brown sugar, the full scent of smoked meats not liquid smoke used by many other BBQ restaurants. Walking to the counter reminded me of the small Q spots in Mississippi I used to frequent with the large board menu and single file wood wall. Getting to the counter I was met with a smiling face as well as a welcoming Hiya! As a first timer we ordered a plethora of food for my wife and I as well as some other friends at home. While waiting they let us try all of their sauces and I gotta say they were all amazing. The extra hot though, that almost killed me haha. While we were waiting I got to make conversation with the three ladies at the front while they were getting at least four orders ready. Didn't break stride but still were having a great time. The food was delicious, real smoke flavor on the ribs and chicken, pulled pork so tender it fell apart. Special treat were the burnt ends and corn bread so moist and sweet it was almost like a dessert. They suggested the friend corn nuggets and boy did they go fast. They were crunchy and sweet. All around one of the best BBQ places on the west coast. Definitely be heading back soon, probably with a few other chefs that enjoy a down home meal! Thanks Rollin Smoke, did a Outstanding job.   P.S Love my hat!!",

I only wish it weren't a bit pricey, but I do know it's not cheap to buy and make quality meat.",

I was greeted at the counter with a friendly welcome and even invited to make myself at home. However I did not feel comfortable in my undies in public so I just found a table and behaved myself.  I ordered the \"Biggin\" because I do not recall this from the OG locs menu and it sounded awesome.  This sandwich stuffed with a hot link and topped with pulled pork and chopped brisket.  The trinity of BBQ! GREAT MEAL! Huge portion of meats cooked perfectly and I topped with all the sauces. Damn Spicy definitely had some burn to it.   I definitely recommend this new location, all the great food of the other location however it lacks that Rollin Smoke aroma where you want to lick the walls. I will be back.",

The only reason I'm giving them 2 stars was because the greens were good. Cooked with brisket not pork. I will go there just for the greens, but I will go some place else for brisket. No one wants that much fat. My dogs liked it thought. Lol  Also, when ordering food to be delivered, one does not want a slice of bread with greesy meat placed on top. It renders the bread inedible. It was just a grease socked mess.",

This past trip we brought a few different friends of ours and it's one of their new faves as well.  Everyone that works there is so friendly and their customer service is the best you will find.  Stacy was very friendly at the register and the whole crew is so helpful to bring your food to you and help you with anything else you need.  Thanks again..... Long time customer, Nick",

    "text": "It's hard to give five stars when there's no table service, and it would have been a three star but Mom insisted I bump them up.  We got one of the samplers that had chicken, brisket, pulled pork and I believe chopped brisket. Our sides were mac & cheese, waffle fries, and potato salad.  I really like that they have the reusable, dishwasher safe cups. We have a collection of these from SkinnyFats, and now we can add to it. When you bring it back, they'll give you a discount.  The food was great. I could have eaten the whole serving of mac & cheese myself, but I had to share with the fam. The waffles fries had some super tasty seasoning on them as well-there was some seasoned salt but something a little sweet as well? It was good! The meats were delicious as well, and my favorite sauce was Mama's Sweet sauce. The seating isn't ideal if you have a larger group (there were six of us), so I think if we do it as a family dinner again I would take it to go so we can have some more elbow room. The fourth star was earned due to the fact that the meal is served on little cookie sheets and they slid one into my Mom's oversized purse and told her she could have it after she mentioned that it would make an awesome cookie sheet. Too funny! It made her laugh and that was definitely some above-and-beyond service!  I would skip the rolls-not sure if you can sub them for an extra side with a little extra $$$, but we didn't eat any of them. Maybe a mix of rolls and corn bread?  We will definitely be back!",

This location of Rolling Smoke manages to be nicer than the original, without losing its charm. Still a cosy restaurant with just a few tables, it's nice and new (and the bathrooms are clean!). The menu is the same as the original. You order at the counter and someone will bring it to you when it's ready. You fix your own fountain drinks. Nothing fancy!  We chose the 5 meat platter, which came with BBQ chicken, ribs, brisket, hot links, and pulled pork, along with 2 sides. It's enough to share- if you like all of the meats and sides you've chosen. The brisket, chicken, and ribs were the standouts, and I enjoyed the Mac and cheese more than the green beans (although my boyfriend preferred the beans, so it all evened out).   There is a selection of sauces on the side by the drink machine, so you can experiment with them as well.  All in all, a good lunch/dinner spot that quells the BBQ craving. I hope they do well on this side of town!",

So, being confused, I tried the 2 meat plate with brisket and pork ribs. The pork ribs were excellent, even if they weren't what I wanted to order. The brisket had a peppercorn bark that I didn't like and had to scrape off. The brisket was dry and didn't have smoke rings, or much flavor. I also got fried okra as my one side; they coated it with some orange dust, and reinvented the wheel for okra, when it was better off left alone.  Still very good BBQ for the Las Vegas area. I'll just go back to the original location.",

My husband and I shared the 5 Meat Pit Special. This was perfect so that I could try all the meats! I asked for sliced brisket, rather than the chopped brisket. The brisket was so tender and flavorful! For our sides, we had corn bread, Mac and cheese, and waffle fries. The corn bread was to die for - so moist and delicious! I wanted to order a whole tray to take it home! I tried all of their sauces - all were good. The sauces cater to anyone's preferences - spicy, sweet, salty, traditional. We also ordered the peach cobbler a la mode for dessert, which was also very delicious! Next time, I plan to order their baked potato. The person next to me had it and it was a whole meal of its own! Can't wait to come back!",

The seasoned waffle fries were sad and HUGE.  The hot link was spiced just right but the hoagie was bordering on stale.  I think it was a day old.   The green beans were the saddest of all, I think they came out of a can.   The place was clean and the employees jumped on cleaning tables as folks finished.

Mike greeted us and gave recommendations on what were the best options for my fiance and I. We ended up getting the 3 meat platter with the BBQ chicken, BBQ pork and the chopped brisket. With a side of the corn nuggets (definitely a must try) and an added side of waffle fries. When we sat down at our table the food came fairly quick. Mike offered up to bring us a side of dipping sauce that I never tried at the other location. It was a chipotle ranch sauce that was recommended to try with the corn nuggets but that sauce went great with the nuggets, fries and the side of pickles. I like the arkansauce and the vinegar based sauce with the bbq. I will undoubtedly be coming back again. Oh and Don't forget to save your cup to reuse on your next visit!",

I had ordered half a pound of brisket, requesting to be more fatty brisket instead of lean, and 1 whole rack of beef ribs.   It was quickly delivered but I had waited a while to eat because I had some other things to do before. The two orders of meats were in its own large Styrofoam box w/ some BBQ sauce and pickles.   1/2 a pound of brisket resulted in 3 slices of brisket. A rack of beef ribs was 4 ribs. Lunch for me consisted of 1 rib and 1 slice.   Lets talk about the brisket first. The top half of the brisket was more fatty, bottom half were more lean. The crust of the brisket is really peppery and consisted of a lot of coarse black pepper. I'm ok with tons of black pepper but I know some people who would not like it. Wish the fat were more distributed   Next comes the beef ribs. Unfortunately, I didn't really like the beef ribs. Big sizes but they beef seems to be a bit more overcooked than I expected. In a way, I was expecting more of a steak like texture, but eating the rib, it became stringy like it was braised for a long time. Flavor wise, it seemed a bit lacking and definitely needed some of the BBQ sauce.   Their BBQ sauce is quite mild too.   Bit saddening but at least that takes care of my curiosity for this location",

I got the brisket and pulled pork with a side of mac and cheese. The brisket meat was small compared to other BBQ places I've been to - still tasted good though. Their pulled pork was my favorite, very flavorful and I loved dipping it in the carolina vinegar and spicy sauce combined. All their sauces are placed by the soda machine, utensils, etc. so you can try as many sauces as you want. Their mac and cheese was slightly mediocre. They just sprinkled shredded cheese on top and their side bowl was a little small for me. Shout out to their staff for being so nice and enthusiastic. They even gave me a free pen and sticker. Haha. I love little free stuff.",

We got the pit plate special $27, the best way to try ribs, brisket, hot links, and pulled pork, plus three sides: waffle fries, yams, & collard greens. The latter because we thought their side salad was not going to reign in the halls of fine artisian greens.   They have several sauces to choose from, but for me, Nevada chicken Cafe sauce is the best. All the meats were excellent. Moist, if not seasoned to my liking except for the chicken. Stellar chicken. Same with the greens. Next time we will try the hush puppies & the Mac and cheese on a carb day.   Yes, they have authentic sweet tea the way Nan would have liked it.",

What caught my eye was the $34.99 all you can eat anything on the menu. I didn't get that but what caught my eye was their beef ribs. Not the normal ribs but the type of cut with huge amounts of meat.   Shout out to \"melissa\" for her hospitality while we were there.   They do have like 6 different sauces for the bbq. I really enjoyed the mama sauce, just the amount of space and sweet. The spicy was really spicy.   I got half beef ribs which was only 2 ribs but full of meat which you'll see from the pics and I also got the corn nuggets which were really good. The ribs and corn nuggets and a drink cost me little over $27. There was no meal option for beef ribs unless I missed it since the menu is extensive.   Everything was good but I thought the price for the 2 beef ribs and one side was a bit pricey. I wish there was a meal deal for the beef ribs. They were fall off the bone tender. Definitely recommend them.",

We had forgotten about their obsession with over-peppering and ordered again tonight. This time it was practically inedible. Don't get me wrong, I like pepper. I like spice. I like peppered, spiced BBQ, but this was out of control. The green beans were doused in pepper, and so was the brisket. The sauce even has big hunks of pepper in it. Aside from the fact that it was way over-peppered, the brisket was floating on top of a 1/4-inch thick layer of grease. Six paper towels couldn't soak it all up so that we could eat it. I finally just gave up.   It is unfortunate that the meat really does taste good but the pepper and grease just make it inedible.",

My family has troublesome dietary needs and Rollin Smoke is careful to accommodate each and every time--this is appreciated more than can be stated because hangry, stomach-achy women are not pleasant to be around. It's a bit more expensive than what we might normally eat but:  1) you get what you pay for 2) food safety/reliability is a huge concern for us and they have never let us down 3) it's a nice splurge for our family at the end of a long work week.  Overall, this is our #1 favorite go-to restaurant for delicious take-out barbecue for when no one in the house knows what the heck they want to eat. The brisket and chicken wings with the vinegar sauce is to die for.",

When pick up time came I was given two bags.   In those bags were no napkins, forks, plates, and I had to pay extra for sauces. I don't mind paying extra, but I will say this Famous Daves gives plenty of food, napkins, paper plates, and plastic forks without charging.   When I got home I saw that the food was alright and honestly smaller portions compared to there competitor. The food was good I won't say anything negative there, but portion wise I don't find it and paying extra for any sauce was a joke.   Maybe in the future I might return, but I don't think I would due to the lack of service. Even when I arrived I was given one box lol and I was like that doesn't look like 70 bucks worth of food, so another girl had to show her the orders and locate mine lol. That to me was no biggie, but still service wise could've been better. This was my second time ordering from them, I believe in going twice just to make a review.   Overall I would say the food is alright, but again Famous Daves without a doubt has more food and better prices for the same things I bought.",

Upon arrival I gave the cashier my name and she replies in annoyance that \"we don't have an order for that name\" and then turns her back to me and walks away. I was confused as to her expectation at this point. I guess she just wanted me to go away. When she decides to pay attention to me again, I pull up the email to show her my order confirmation and she rolls her eyes and hands me a bag of food and walks away again. So I guess she did have an order with that name after all. No sauces included and I felt like she might have a complete meltdown if I asked her for BBQ sauce. I would also like to add that I was the only person in line at this point so it's not like she was overwhelmed with customers. I ordered and payed online (tipped - but clearly that was a mistake) so it's difficult to understand how this place delivers poor service when all they have to do is hand someone their food and maybe say \"thanks\"   The food was ok but without any sauce it was not what I wanted. Hoped to enjoy some BBQ and instead felt like I wasted $30.",

We ordered the duo with pork and brisket, pork sandwich with mac 'n' cheese, and brisket sliders with green beans.  The meat was phenomenal and the portion size for the duo was quite large. The sandwich and sliders on the other hand were very small portions. This was surprising, especially considering the price, which is why this place gets 4 stars instead of 5. Be warned, the brisket and mac 'n' cheese is very peppery, so avoid those if you're not a fan of black pepper (my wife hates it). I loved both, and the garlic green beans as well. I'll go back when I'm in the area.",

Really didn't want 4, but the charge was already done so I just decided to keep it as is.

They even have a Kureg! We ordered 2 duo combo and a piggy sandwich. Sissy had brisket & ribs with bacon potato salad. That ish is the bomb! Perfectly cooked potatoes, creamy, just enough mayo & the BACON!  I had the chicken & ribs with Mac n cheese. Chicken was cooked well. Super tender. Ribs were delicious. The Mac n cheese is shell pasta, so my kiddo went nuts for it! She had the piggy sandwich and she loved it. The pulled pork is so tender it literally melts in your mouth. I did find the sauce to be a little too spicy for me, but I am a wuss with spice, so if you like spicy you'll love it! A bit on the pricy side, but definitely worth a trip!",

We really had low expectations for the wings but those turned out to be some of the best wings I've had. The skin was crispy, a little dry but that's how I like them. Lemon pepper rub was flavorful and didn't leave the wings tasting like they were covered in a dry rub. Cannot comment on the sides as we did not have any. We will definitely be back.",

The chopped brisket is tender and flavorful. It doesn't require any sauce. Their sauce is on the peppery side. The greens are to die for and the corn nuggets are divine. The cornbread is delicious too but two small squares are $3.50. I think we've agreed that ordering the meat by the pound with the pint sides will feed a crowd for about $12 a person. Honestly, I've never even been inside.  I think it's a bit pricey but very tasty and I will certainly order again!",

Ordered the shrimp platter and that was $16.99 for 8 pieces of shrimp and 3 pieces on hush puppies that were the size of the gum from the gym all machine. Since they were known for their meatloaf - I ordered that. The mashed potatoes that came with the meatloaf tasted sour as if it was sitting out and went bad or if they used old milk/sour cream. We also got two kids meal for $9.99 each for some prepackaged burger patties. Mac N Cheese was not cheesy at all. It was just a bunch of over cooked smushed pasta with lots of black pepper and sprinkle cheese on top.   Don't waste your time and money, just go straight to Lucille's.",

The cornbread tasted like it came right out of my Grandma's butter coated cast iron skillet. We will be back!!",

Beans had just enough bite to offset The sweetness, corn nuggets were great and they have SIX kinds of housemade BBQ sauces.  Wonderful cornbread as well... at the end of my lunch they brought me some complimentary banana pudding!

    "text": "Let me first say that BBQ is a varied and wondrous thing.  There are as many different versions and variants as there are pit masters and pigs. Some folks like it spicy while others prefer it sweet.  Some like it soaked in sauce and others like it dry.  Some like it heavily smoked while other folks prefer just hints of wood. There really is no single requirement or standard.  This is why running a BBQ joint can be a tough gig. You know you're just not going to be able to make it great - for everybody.  At its core however, BBQ is ultimately a choreography of wood, fire, and meat that, when properly executed, is a thing of beauty.  To do this at home is one thing, but to do it in a restaurant-based production line is something completely different. It is a business and an art many fail at.   I had heard so much about RS over the years I was very excited to find their new facility in Summerlin.  As a Las Vegas local, I try to avoid the Strip unless all other dining options (including the neighbor's cat) have been exhausted.  Okay...that was a joke...I love cats... and I would have to catch it.  Anyway, when the new RS opened near me, I made it a point to drop by.  With almost 2000 four and five star reviews, I went with very high  expectations - maybe too high.   I ordered two of their five meat plates to go. Each plate came with three small sides, so I upgraded them to larges and figured I would have ample food to feed six. The service was courteous and fast, so when I headed out the door with two heavy bags in tow I was giddy about the impending feast.  That story changed somewhat when I got home and uncrated the grub.   The first thing that struck us was the size (or lack thereof) of the side portions.  We opened up the large side containers to find them only 3/4 (or less) full.  When we opened up the cornbread boxes (I purchased 3 orders) we were also disappointed to find 6 tiny (I mean tiny) squares. I remember my wife joking that they had clearly mixed up their cornbread with their croutons.  By the time the sides were distributed we each had about a tablespoon or two of each one.   RANT FOLLOWS: C'mon guys - you're not on The Strip feeding a bunch of hungover tourists who will never return.  You are in Summerlin  feeding your hard working fellow locals - and we want a manly piece of cornbread and grown up side servings!  I paid over 80 bucks for my order and, for that price, I should be granted a full container of beans!! We are your desert brothers and sisters...we come to you because we are hungry...feed us! Okay, I feel better... sorry.   Unlike the sides, the meat portions were ample. The chicken was outstanding.  It was juicy, perfectly cooked, and fall off the bone tender. Great bird guys!  The hot links were tasty as well, as were the ribs.  I wouldn't change a thing on either.   The brisket and pork, however, were disappointing to say the least. The brisket we received was so chewy it required a sharp knife (a brisket no no), and the pork was something else entirely.  I have had pulled pork, chopped pork, chunked pork, pork loin, pork butt, and pork chops but what we received was a pile of what can best be described as \"pork hash.\"  It was almost minced.  When I tasted it, it became clear why they had done this. It was full of fat.  That also explained the oozing pool of grease it floated on.  It had a great flavor though - I can't wait to go back and try the actual meat.   Finally, on a positive note, the sauces were a home run.  Our favorites were the mustard and vinegar selections. Just like back home, and even a bit better.  You could pour this stuff on a rock and make it edible.  Great sauces guys! Best I have had in town - by far.   Bottom line here is that RS makes some tasty stuff; tasty enough to bring us back for a second try in a month or two.  In the meantime, my hope is that they get their heads off \"The Strip\" and start feeding their fellow desert brethren like we deserve.  I will even give them a pass on the brisket and greasy fatty pork, because their sauce is so good it even made them edible.  And the collard greens....did I mention the collard greens? Pure Southern  perfection.",

The hush puppies and Mac and cheese were also very good. Overall, the restaurant was very clean, the service was friendly, and the food was better than most.",

    "text": "I will start with the positives.  The staff is friendly, the service is very good.  The restaurant is clean.  It hasn't changed much since it was Billy's BBQ before.  I got a 1/2 pound of brisket.  The brisket was tender and seasoned well.  But here are the negatives.  I grew up on Texas BBQ and one Cardinal Sin is that you DO NOT sauce the brisket.  Sauce is served on the side and optional for those who want it.  While the sauce was just drizzled on the meat, it still was wrong.  And the sauce they served on the side was not good at all.  I tossed it and used my own sauce at the house.  I also wanted potato salad, but they make it with onions, which I still have problems comprehending why people would do this?!  All you can taste is the onions, and not the potatoes!   I'm glad I asked though, because I was informed that they garnish the brisket with chives, too?!  What the... ?!   Most of my favorite places in Texas have plenty of onions, pickles and peppers for those who want to add that to your meal, there is no need to take anything away from the meat, if your meat is good... and theirs is!   Since the potato salad had onions, I opted for the mac & cheese.  It was ok.  Didn't have much flavor and it looked like it had big pepper flakes scattered in it.  It's nothing I would get again.  I would definitely get the brisket here again, but tell them no sauce or chives next time.  It, along with the staff, service and cleanliness is why I'm giving it three stars.",

You definitely should try the sauces available to you table side , I like how they don't drench the meat in sauce and give you various options to put on the side . Definitely no \"WOW\" factor in the flavoring but it is good with enough sauce of course . I would go back to try other things though !",

    "text": "I can seriously make this the shortest review ever and just put a drooling face emoji because that's how I felt after the first taste. We were a few doors down when the smell drew us in like Toucan Sam followed Fruit Loops. Ok, so first thing we notice when looking at the menu of course was the prices next to each item, they seemed a little high. (I'll justify the price in a minute, I promise!) Everything sounded so good though and the pictures of some of the items looked delicious. We placed our orders with who I believe was the owner, he was very nice, made us feel welcomed and described the menu in detail to help us make a decision. My 2 boys shared the 2 sliders kid's meal with mac n cheese, it was more than enough for 2 kids to share. Of course I had to try their Mac n' cheese which was delicious. My husband had \"The Biggin\" with the fried corn nuggets. I had the limited time fried chicken and hot link with a side of loaded mashed potatoes and gravy. Now for the taste! This is where the prices went completely insignificant at this point and I would've paid $100 for a sandwich! I took a scoop of mashed potatoes, dipped it in the gravy and I swear I blacked out for a quick second. They melted in my mouth before I even had a chance to get a second spoonful. I ended up eating the remaining gravy with a spoon just like soup, it was that good! The crispy fried chicken skin had a hint of dry rub in the buttermilk. The kids ate every last bit of their pulled pork and brisket sliders. My husband loved his sandwich and the corn nuggets were sweet and creamy on the inside while crispy on the outside. We are so coming back!!",

Sweet tea is great, not gag you sweet but reminds me of the little restaurant I used to love the tea at back in Goose Creek, SC. Anyways.   The food is tasty. I am a huge brisket fan and this place makes me happy just because of that. Spare ribs are cooked nicely, pulls right off the bone. Yams remind me of Thanksgiving with my family (and all the times I make them for myself while waiting for next year.)  I am about to try the baby back ribs.....they look awesome.

Friends recommended this location and said they had all you can eat last time and it was pretty good. I'm from the Carolinas and grew up on vinegar BBQ, Sweet red BBQ and down in Georgia with my dad mustard BBQ. I was anxious to try their collards and BBQ. We all opted for the AYCE BBQ. Unfortunately I could only eat one platter and one dessert. So $34.95 was a bit too expensive for me just to eat one platter. Next time I would prefer to try 1-2 meats with 3 sides. I love my BBQ but I LOVE my sides! I was pleasantly surprised that they have several sauces that you can try and put as much or as little as you want. The Carolina vinegar sauce was great! The Sweet Mama was my 2nd fave! The mustard one was very good, it was called sweet girl or something. It was a tiny bit sweet with a nice mustard taste. The Arkansas was just okay for me and I didn't go anywhere near the spicy after seeing our friends reaction!  So with the AYCE you order 3 meats and two sides. I tried the baby back ribs, beef ribs and the pulled pork with a side of collards and sweet corn bread. The baby backs were tender and very tasteful. I really liked them with the Sweet Mama sauce! The pulled pork was tender and was great within the Carolina Vinegar BBQ sauce. Now this was the very first time I've had great beef ribs! They were well charred outside and very tender and tasty on the inside. They're also HUGE!!! Like Flinstone RIBS! My friend had the collards the first time they went and she said they were too salty so I decided to try and see if they again. They weren't and even she tried them and said they were better this time around. They were good but still not my daddy's collards.  the sweet cornbread was very delish! The sweet tea was not my cup of tea. We only do Luzianne back home and here was Lipton. Now I tasted several sides from everyone else like the hush puppies which were great! I love hush puppies! Also the green beans, peppery but crisp and fresh. The creamy homemade macaroni and cheese is seasoned and topped. Very different but very good. The homemade banana pudding was on POINT! It was very very good!",

This location is really small and kind of hard to navigate with how close they stick the tables together, especially when you have the drinks, condiments, and cutlery shoved in the same little corner as the trash can and everyone is trying to get in there at once.   My brisket tasted good. My friend wasn't a fan of the meatloaf. I got horrifically ill for the rest of the night after I left. The only thing with allergen information on the menu said that the meatloaf was not gluten free, so that kind of makes you assume everything else is gluten free, right? I had never had any kind of reaction to barbeque before. Idk what was going on with my meal, but I was in agony for a good 5-6 hours after eating here.",

    "text": "After passing this place for months and with the fact that I just wanted some simple bbque and decided to give it a try... Ordered a triple meat meal with ribs, brisket and pulled pork, sides ordered were potato chip fries and Mac and cheese and loaded mashed potatoes ... We had it delivered and normally we don't expect perfection on delivery because it's never spot on . We asked for sides of all sauces so we could try all to find the ones we liked for future reference.  Ok so... Ribs were fall off the bone delicious and did not need any additional sauce (which was good because the sauces were runny and more of a dressing then a thick slather of deliciousness) We honestly could not tell the difference between the pulled pork and the brisket and so didn't know if we even got one or the other or both... it was blah.  The sides .... how do you describe something with no taste? I don't want to be mean... but the Mac n cheese was like mushy noodles and no taste, the loaded mashed potatoes were hard and almost as if they had been left out all day and quickly reheated.  We did LOVE their potato fries.  So what I learned from this meal was... Yes I will go back and get the ribs (they were a little fatty but very very tender) and the \"fries\"  We might try a couple other items but we will make sure we have our own bbque sauce on hand.  So. If your in a craving for good ribs then it's a quick spot for a fast meal.",

Walking into this place, I noticed it was rather small for a LV restaurant but packed.  It has an authentic genuine bbq joint look to it.  You walk up to the cash registers to place your order.  If your eating in they will bring the food to you.  If your taking food to go they will call your name.  To the right of the cashiers, there is all their bbq sauces available to taste.  They have a good variety too.  Anything from mustard based to vinegar.  I tried all of them and they were delicious.  All of them do have a little bite to them and the \"damn hot\" is not for the timid.  As busy as this place was, my order was out in less than 10 min.  I got The Biggin.  On the menu its a hot link with pulled pork ans brisket.  I got it with a hot dog instead of the link.  This thing was huge and its flavor matched it size.  I will definitely order this again and it will make it hard for me to try new things.  The meat was tender, moist, and flavorful.  Which for brisket is extremely hard to do, but I was impressed.  I also got a side of mac and cheese , which didn't have much flavor, but was delicious with some bbq sauce.  Honestly you could easily dive past this place on a daily basis and not know it was there, but its definitely worth the effort.  I know I'm going back to try out more dishes.",

We ordered a 2-meat combos (1/2 lb total of pulled pork and pulled chicken) for $22 that came with a side and drink, basically the drink was free with this combo.  Ala carte meat is 1/4 lb for $8, we added this to the combo and the kids split it.  Meat was tender. Moist and good portions.  Serve yourself bbq sauce choices at the register too.  For sides we had Mac and cheese, potato salad and a sweet potato, all good, around $5-$6 each, all can be shared by 2-people IMO.  The location is near downtown Las Vegas and part of a colorful complex with other businesses; bright orange, red, purple painted building with its own small lot.

The restaurant is clean, the staff is friendly, the decor is fitting and, as I said the food is great! (I had the St. Louis style ribs, waffle fry's and Cole slaw) Now..why 4 instead of 5 stars? This appears to have been a take-out place that grew into a restaurant. My only complaint (and the reason for 4 stars instead of 5) is the fact that you eat from Styrofoam containers with  flimsy plastic utensils and packets (instead of bottles) for the ketchup. C'mon guys...make your mind up. Are you a take-out joint or a sit down restaurant? If the latter, start acting like it.",

We got alot of food for only $35.00. 5 choice of meats and 3 sides was plenty. Also I love that their cups are reusable and if you bring it back you get $1.00 off.

Remember to try the original not the sequel. The management and the rest of the staff seemed none caring and dismissive. Extremely poor service. The ribs were overpriced. We were getting our food to go and I asked about the different sauces that rolling smoke barbecue had. The cashier wasn't friendly and just rolled her eyes at me said \"oh your sauces are in your bag.\" We just wanted to experience what different sauces they had and what made them so special. I love a good bbq spot the I ordered two meat combo brisket and chicken mac and cheese. Bottom of my list of BBQ places. I was very uncomfortable and the girl who took our order brought my whole mood down. . If you want average BBQ, and give your money to a owner that has a bad attitude, rude and really shouldn't own a restaurant. Come here. If you want good barbecue go to the original Rollin Smoke BBQ or Bell's BBQ in Seven Hills.",

Our sides were baked beans and Mac and cheese. By the way no military discount on the sampler. The Mac and cheese was ok, had green peppers in it, a little out of the ordinary for me. The beans were kidney beans mixed with meat sauce. The corn bread was great by me. The ribs were  nothing to write home about, they did fall off the  bone. Would I go back? I don't think so.",

We tried the \"brisket 3 ways,\" our nomination for the best thing on the menu.  Good choice of sauces and the brisket was tops.  I watched one gent go for the special: all you can eat for $36.  You don't have to stand back in line for refills, just stop any staff member.  All you want of anything.  And you have 1 hour.  It is a fun place with friendly staff, great people watching and most of all the best barbecue in town.",

The first time we went we got the five meat sampler which includes ribs, brisket, chicken, pulled pork and hot links! My favorites were the chicken and pulled pork, while my roommate preferred the brisket and ribs.   As for sides we got mashed potatoes, mac and cheese, yams and added cornbread! My roommate had nothing but good things to say about the yams and I loved their mac n cheese!  Best of all is their service. The employees are all awesome and make the experience a great one (it's just one of the reasons we decided to come back!)",

In fact, they were not stuffed, some toppings were poured over and the potatoes were pretty much closed.  Seriously disappointed.  We also ordered one pound of pulled pork, quart sides of mashed potatoes, Mac and cheese, baked beans and an 8oz mamas sweet sauce.  All in all we paid over $100 for what we got including tip and $3.99 delivery. It served 4 and we had left overs of the mashed potatoes, beans and Mac and cheese.

Unfortunately it was closed on Sundays. However this location is open on Sundays. You walk up to the counter to order. When your food is ready they bring it to the table. The women behind the counter were incredibly friendly and helpful. While it is not really table service per se, the service they provided was excellent. My wife and I decided to share the st. Louis ribs and a side of waffle fries. Wow was that good!! These had to be the meatiest ribs I have ever had. And waffle fries were perfectly prepared. We loved it all. Despite coming in pretty hungry, we had difficulty finishing the meal. My son-in-law and his son both have much bigger appetites than I have. They went with the all-you-can-eat special for $35. If you have a big appetite this is a great deal. They ordered three or four different Meats. Each one was excellent. This is not as upscale as Lucille's or Famous Dave's, but the ribs are much better. I will definitely be coming back.",

So, unknowingly at like 7:55pm, I called to see if I could place an order for pickup. After a brief hold I was asked what we wanted to order. With screaming kids in the background and having to relay my cc # multiple times, paying over the phone was unsuccessful, so it was agreed to pay upon my arrival. Well, when I got there the store was pretty much dark. All of the tables were stacked with chairs, the place was spotless and three quite pleasant ladies were behind the counter with my order ready to go. I felt SO guilty that this team stayed well over closing time to provide EXCELLENT customer service! They could've easily told me over the phone that they were already closed. Well, it was worth the drive across town to pick it up! And as always, the food was excellent. Thank you so much for everything that you provide; the service, quality, and consistency is always top notch! This is why we come back time and time again.",

Ill start with the obvious, the food is out of the world delicious. Food melts in your mouth and is probably some of the most tender meat i have ever had. They have a wide variety of flavors for the sauce you can put on the meat you order. The original is great but they also have some that will have some kick to it (spicy).   So I was a bit shocked when I first stopped by here. I ordered the next size up from the original portion they give you. HOLY SMOKES..... I can eat a TON and this was a portion size I couldn't handle.. Unreal!!! Whats crazy is.. they have another portion size bigger than the one I couldn't finish! I cant even imagine someone eating that, its gotta be for a family of 10 or something lol.   Both locations are great, the one near the strip is probably a bit more authentic and raw. I would definitely swing by all three locations if your in those areas and of course hungry.   Staff is always nice and make it a wonderful experience. If you're not familiar with the menu, they are more than willing to help pick out something amazing for you to enjoy!",

    "text": "BBQ places with brisket are hard to find, especially with actually GOOD brisket. After driving by this place picking up my SO from work, we decided to go check it out. (It doesn't help you can smell the BBQ driving by sometimes.)   The first time we came here, we got the meat sampler to give all their meats a try. It comes with ribs, brisket, BBQ chicken, pulled pork, and a hotlink. Even though I came here for brisket, my favorite meat they had were the ribs. They were fat and tender with a nice flavor. It almost melts in your mouth. This isn't a knock against the brisket! The brisket was good, it's just that the brisket that came with the meal was finely chopped rather than whole slices. It's not my preferred way to have brisket, but it was tasty on the brisket sandwich I got the next time I came. The other meats were great too, especially the chicken which was nice and moist.   The worst part of this BBQ joint is their sides, for the most part, they're just kind of... bland? Of their sides, I've had the potato salad, collard greens, mac and cheese, and loaded mash potatoes. With all the bacon and cheese they add to the sides, it's strange that they don't have much flavor to them. The best one was the mac and cheese, but even that one wasn't one to write home about.  There's a good amount of parking around the area and there's a good amount of seating, though it is likely to get crowded quickly around lunch and dinner.   I still want to check out other BBQ places, but this one will be my goto unless I find something better.",

    "text": "My mouth is watering thinking about this all over again.  My family & I ventured to Rollin' Smoke BBQ for a celebratory night out. It was definitely a treat. We opted for the BBQ Sampler. It certainly did not disappoint. With over 2 pounds of meat and 4 large sides - we were all left with more than we could chew.  The BBQ Sampler included:  1 whole chicken - better than I expected. I have to be honest & say I am not necessarily a fan of BBQ chicken. However, if I had to eat it, I'd want it from Rollin' Smoke.  1/2 lb Brisket - who doesn't love brisket? It is the king of BBQ, if you ask me. I wish it was sliced instead of chopped, but, it was delicious nonetheless.  1/2 lb Pulled Pork - very tasty. Having overcooked pulled pork is pretty common, but Rollin' Smoke has got it right with pulled pork cooked perfectly.  1/2 lb hot links - perhaps the most popular at our family dinner table. We loved the hot links!  The BBQ sampler also featured four large sides. We chose mac & cheese, loaded mashed potatoes, BBQ beans, and fried okra. The loaded mash was my hands down favorite. The other sides were just up to par for me.  $80 may sound like a lot...but guys, this was A LOT of food. We all had leftovers for the next day. I may or may not be planning my next visit at this exact moment...",

I ordered the ribs and chopped brisket with potato salad, the ribs where fall off the bone but parts of the Ribs where dry like beef jerky ,the brisket was real mushy and The potato salad just didn't have the same flavor. Maybe I came here on a bad day. Service was great no Complaints there it's just the bbq is not the same as what I've had at the other location. That to bad because this places is pretty close to my house. I'll give place a try again one of these days but  for now i'll explore other barbecue places in the area or I'll eat at their other location when I'm in area and Craving barbecue",

We both ordered the two meat combo I got green beans, chicken and a hot link, the green beans were so amazing and buttery!!  My roommate got ribs and brisket with a side of Mac and cheese, the food was absolutely amazing! Haven't had bbq this good since living in the south! The bbq sauces were amazing the Carolina mustard was fire so was the arkansauce! Being as I moved from Arkansas I'm quite impressed! Thank you for the amazing food and great customer service!!!",

I usually always get the burnt ends and the brisket, wow they're good! Everything is well seasoned with lots of sauce where as some barbecue places bring their meat out dry and you add the sauce yourself. The sauce they use is phenomenal and the seasoning is just as good! The meat comes on top of toasted bread that soaks up all those delicious juices. They're cornbread is next level, perfectly sweet and moist. I've also there's their \"Mama's Banana Puddin\" and it was soo good with big fresh chunks of banana. Overall, the food here is unbeatable and I would highly recommend if you're looking for some good barbecue!!",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I decided to stop into Rollin' Smoke BBQ on a Saturday morning, 11:00 A.M. This restaurant is off of the 215/Flamingo, in a large shopping plaza. There is plenty of parking nearby the restaurant for any-time of the day.  Inside the restaurant, all of the tables were clean and spotless. There menu consists of a variety of BBQ items, like pulled pork, chicken, spare ribs, sides [mac n cheese, corn bread, beans etc.].  We decided to do the 5 meat , 3 side special for $27.00 ~. The 5 meats we selected were the following  -Hot Links, -BBQ Spare Ribs -BBQ Chicken -BBQ Pulled Pork -BBQ Brisket. -Mac N Cheese -Corn Bread -BBQ Beans  The meal came out immediately. I had gone to the restroom and came out, the meal was at the table. Quite quick, but the quality of the food was quite lackluster.  The BBQ Spare Ribs were too fatty to eat. There was barely on meat on it. The Brisket, was shredded, with too much peppercorn added to the meat. All I could taste was the Peppercorn. The Pulled Pork had a little to much Peppercorn as well. I didn't eat the Hot Links, so I can't comment on that meat, but the only meat I truly enjoyed was the BBQ Chicken. I would get the BBQ chicken again.   I would select different sides to try if I came back to this BBQ restaurant again. The Corn Bread was a little too soggy for my taste profile. The Mac N Cheese was good. It used large elbow noodles and there was plenty of spices/cheese used in the dish. The BBQ beans were okay, mixed with a few different meats and heavily sauced with BBQ.  This BBQ is just okay. If I came back here, I would just get their BBQ Chicken and try out different sides.",

The food was what you would expect from Rollin Smoke. I have thought they were the best BBQ in Vegas. Now after two disappointing deliveries from door Dash on a two meat combo, they lost my business. A two meat combo at $13.99 with literally two slices of brisket, and one side with dried out ribs  is not worth it in my opinion!",

The BBQ wouldn't be complete without the Sauces so they have variety to spicy it up if you would like. Overall very good quality of meat and very well made to the perfection.",

I was in the mood for some BBQ recently so figure now good time.   Whenever talk about multiple locations first thing comes to my mind is consistency. Rollin Smoke BBQ this second location had exactly the same memories from the original. The portion size are awesome \"HUGE\". My first visit went with the \"Big Hawk\" pulled pork sandwich. Talk about overflow. OMG. The amount of pork is two or three times more then bread. I was good either way killing it with fork or straight sandwich. The pork was amazing. Moist, juicy, and divine. Mac and cheese was solid.  Second visit went with the chopped brisket sandwich. Again overflow of meat. Tasty. Not sure if can put one sandwich better then the other. Both hell of addicting!  I had cornbread for my side. Da bomb. It one of the best cornbread had in Vegas. Moist, not dense, fluffy, hot, golden crust, and perfect.   The only difference with second location. It is in much nicer neighborhood with lots of parking and more modern. The personality is still the same with the interior decor. The different sauces with the names....love it. Service five stars all around. If looking for some good BBQ need make stop at Rollin Smoke BBQ.",

    "text": "Rollin' Smoke BBQ was the first BBQ place I ate in Vegas. My first experience was very good, from what I remember. This time around.... to be brutally honest it, was weak af. (Scroll to the bottom for short review)  Long review: I ordered the pit special. Comes with: Brisket, chicken, hot link, ribs, and chicken (again?). It also comes with three sides. I chose fries, Mac & cheese, and loaded mash potatoes.   Alright let's get this review out of the way... The platter felt like it was just sitting out in the back, under a heat lamp. The meats were not even warm, felt more like room temperature. To provide a better example, the cheese on my loaded mash potatoes were not melting. They were perfectly fine, just chilling there not melted.   As for the cooking of the meats, the brisket was meh. It was finely shredded to teeny tiny bits, that my fork can't hold. Either they dice the brisket in a blender, or Edward Scissor Hands was in the back going hard. It was decently seasoned, but nothing crazy.  As for the chicken... dry. Seasoned in desert sand and cooked under the Nevada heat. Just kidding, but all jokes aside, the chicken was terrible. I definitely don't recommend ordering the chicken. If I wanted dry chicken, I could have easily made it myself.   Hotlinks were the best thing on the platter. Good spice, and flavor. The ribs were decent, but again nothing you can't make at home.   Short review:  Not worth the money. Felt like the food was left in the back and then served when ordered. Chicken was super duper trash. Brisket was ran through a paper shredder. Not sure how they won awards for their bbq. Jessie Rae's BBQ is a lot better!!",

I have tried their meatloaf more than once . The first time I gave it a try because it's what they are known for. The second time was because I did enjoy it even though I don't normally eat meatloaf.  It's a little different than your typical meatloaf because it's spicy. My husband usually gets their burger which is huge. You would need to cut it up in order to eat it. He really liked it ! I love the banana pudding here so much that that's the only dessert I like to order. To be honest I haven't tried the other desserts.  I think the space is a little small especially if it gets busy but I was always able to find a seat. I think it's because the service is fast and courteous.",

    "text": "Smoked Meatloaf Will Fill Your Belly  This is the first visit to this location . I went to the Original location on Highland Drive about 2 years ago . I'm usually not in this area so I decided to stop and get the Smoked Meatloaf that everyone raves about and was on the Travel Channel .   I have to say be hungry . I ate half and put the rest in refrigerator for tomorrow . It is thick cut on top of loaded mashed potatoes and topped with onion straws and Mama's Sweet Delicious Sauce . It was good , but I will probably get the 3 meat plate next time . They have 6 sauces which I got 2 others to try . Mama's is the right choice for the meatloaf .   There are lots of choices in Vegas for BBQ and I think Rollin Smoke is just average , that is why I never went back to the other location . I remember I got pulled pork and some other stuff with my son and he wasn't impressed either . So we go back to other favorites . I love BBQ and try different types and meats .   I do have to say it is better than the Billy's BBQ that was there before even though they gave you a good devil egg and good coleslaw .",

Today I was doing take out. Place your order at the counter and they will call you when it is ready. The meatloaf order is a complete dinner. A generous portion of meat sitting on top of a mound of mashed potatoes and all of that covered with crispy onion strings. On the side was 3 containers of Mamas Sweet Delicious sauce, 2 pickles and a roll. The meatloaf was tender inside with a nice crispy crust. Add some sauce and its juicy. The potatoes were creamy and the pickles crisp. The roll was nothing special just soft and fresh.  Now I have another decision as what to order, it's all delicious. My favorite BBQ in Las Vegas",

    "text": "To find this level of quality BBQ in Summerland of all places leaves me both dumbfounded and very thankful.  And any irrational or unwarranted fears I may have had about a possible drop off in BBQ goodness from the original Rollin' Smoke BBQ to this one has been quite dispelled - it's seriously just as tasty.  Spare ribs were tender and juicy with just the right amount of flavorful fat.  The brisket was equally tender and nicely seasoned.  And the only real question to date is which BBQ sauce and sides I prefer, and I think that answer may vary from one protein to another - to which I may have to dedicate a whole review to later.  But the best part for yours truly is their Summerland location is way closer to my neck of the woods and a lot more freeway accessible than the one near The Strip with a ton of parking.  There's plenty of seating if I can't wait to bring BBQ back home and need to start devouring it right then and there.  Overall, I'll be back to try the other kind of ribs, the chicken, the hot link, etc, etc, etc.",

We were watching the Daytona Monster Energy series race when we had a cravin' for Barbecue.  I went with the 2 brisket sliders and a Mac & cheese with a sweet tea (kids menu).   My brisket was salty and lacked flavor for a place that rubs their meats.  The Mac & cheese was also salty and watery.  Their beverage options were soda or tea.  I went with tea but was disappointed that it was Lipton tea and I'm not a fan of them but I won't fill up on soda.  Boyfriend said his ribs were not great, he said some were cold & dry and his meal was $25.  Not impressed with the food, but they have a locals discount for anyone who does like comin' here.",

I thoroughly enjoy their pulled pork, but their brisket is excellent as well, either in a sandwich or as an entree. I suggest the potato salad as a side, but their waffle fries are tasty too; always crispy with a little salty/sweet/spicy seasoning. The staff are always fantastic. Really personable guys and gals who are invested in giving you a nice, laid-back dining experience. The dining room is a bit small, as some previous reviewers have pointed out, but there are plenty of tables (without making you feel smashed in like sardines), and I've never had an issue finding seating. This is a favorite place. We always end up coming here at least once when my family is in town, and if I have friends from out of state I'll invite them out with a \"Do you like barbeque? Because I know a really good place...\" So I get good company and good food; It's a win/win situation for me :)",

First, when you walk in you are overwhelmed by the delicious scent of properly made BBQ. The staff greets you quickly and with a genuine smile on their face. They'll offer suggestions if you need it or space if you simply need to review their rather large menu. It should be noted that while the are not the cheapest joint I think their prices are well justified by the quality and quantity of food. I personally had the roasted chicken and the sliced brisket with a side of waffle fries. The chicken was moist and well seasoned while the brisket literally fell apart when trying to pick it up with a fork. All of their rubs were delicious. They even season the waffle fries, which were perfect. I highly recommend their \"Arkansauce\" as it was by far my favorite.   And you cannot I repeat cannot skip dessert. I had the berry cobbler with ice cream of course, and it did not disappoint! Tart and sweet with warm cake and cool vanilla ice cream. It was a pair made in heaven.",

This Christmas I decided to take a break from cooking like a mad woman so I went into Rolling Smoke to order the meat portion of dinner. From the moment I walked in the door, i was stunned. It smelled AMAZING and the service was impeccable. I was looking for suggestions on how much food I would need for 8-10 people and the chef came out and gave me a rundown on recommendations from the different meats to the sauces. The manager or possibly the owner then had them make me a big ol' plate to take with me to try the meats I ordered for a Christmas Eve pick up free of charge. The plate was huge and the food was off the hook, perfectly seasoned...not dry or too salty. I am so excited to pick up my food on Christmas Eve because I know I won't be disappointed. Thank you to the staff at Rolling Smoke, you guys really wowed me and I look forward to eating your delicious food in a couple of weeks! Two thumbs up!",

I've tried this place 2 times since it opened on the west side, and I won't be back.  So sad...",

I only wish my belly had more room .The portions are generous and their desserts look delicious. Great menu selection.excellent service. Something for everyone.This place is now in our restaurant rotation. Give it a try , you won't be disappointed!",

I got brisket and ribs while my girlfriend got brisket chopped and chicken. For our sides we got BBQ beans, Mac and cheese, and yams. While the brisket was tender as well as all the meat, the flavor wasn't anything special, we were pretty disappointed. Now the sides however were really good. We liked the Mac and cheese a lot as well as the yams. The beans were a little different but still pretty tasty. Lastly the sauce. I mean what is BBQ without the sauce. They gave us a few different sauces so that we can try them and honestly they weren't all that. We ended up pulling some sweet baby rays out of the fridge. May come back to try the desserts but that's it.",

The cheese was creamier than usual, i swear it was more cheesy and less creamy. It tasted like velveeta. Super gross. I got a lot of it, and now I'm stuck with gross Mac lol but whatever.

I'm going to say the original location puts out better Bbq IMO maybe I came on a bad day or the chefs here don't know what they're doing whatever the reason I would rather not come back. This is a way better location and it's brand new but if they don't start keeping the reputation of this place strong just like the last Bbq spot that was here it will get shut down. I spent almost $50 for something I could've got way better at a chain Bbq spot. I'm sorry for the harsh words but it's True.",

I have been grilling and smoking foods since I was a wee little man.  so when I enter this establishment let's just say my standards are pretty high.  the food was absolutely amazing! And the prices weren't bad either. It's rather small on the inside, but it has enough seating for small groups and a TV for watching sports of latest news. The vibe on the interior is very quaint and has a southern appeal with some humor tied in.  I would recommend the beef brisket chopped, the smoked ham, and more beef brisket; :-)  They have a wide array of sauces that cover all pallets everything from sweet to sour to tangy to spicy.  They also do chicken there but I haven't tried it yet. They cater which is good to know.  the staff and the chefs are extremely respectful and genuinely funny. Our food was out in no time at all.  I will definitely be frequenting this establishment on a regular basis as I have a propensity for all things barbecue. But this place... Make no mistake does barbecue right!",

I have tried the trio sammich, which is you like pulled pork I can confidently suggest to you. It's really dry at first but I am assuming its because they want you to add the level of sauce you prefer. Their sauce has a high vinegar content and taste which I am a fan of. On the side I got Mac& Cheese, Potato Salad, and Corn Nuggets. I have also tried the brisket trio with sliced, shredded and burnt ends. I can easily reccomend this too although the burnt ends are my favorite and I could go with just those!   All in all, good food but a really inconvenient place to eat. Like I said before, I never plan to eat here it only happens if I am nearby and happen to see an open table.",

    "text": "This was our first time here, and we were very disappointed.  First, we paid $18.00 each for a three meat plate, since we wanted to try the BBQ & figured we could take leftovers home.  Each one comes with ONE side.  So we ordered an extra side each: the cornbread, which should be free, is $3.50 for two small pieces (equal to one piece anywhere else).  We both ordered ribs, brisket and pork.  They give you TWO ribs.  After two plates, an extra side each and one drink, it cost almost $50.  The reason this is important is that you can go to Famous Dave's and get the same three meat plate and they give you FOUR ribs, TWO sides, and the cornbread is free, so it will cost you less and you'll get more.  At this place you're paying extra for another side, cornbread, and if you want two more ribs, it will cost you even more.  They also use a dry rub, so the meat is dry instead of moist.  Save yourself $12 and go to Dave's.",

You can tell when a restaurant has food sitting in reach-in fridges or lowboy drawers and they simply reheat when it is ordered.  Don't serve cold BBQ, especially when both \"cooks\" are simply leaning over on the counter and on their damn cell phones.   When we walked in, there was no one else in here.. they had ample time to reheat everything properly. The ONLY thing that came out freshly hot were the corn fritters.   The mac-n-cheese is filled with whole pepper corns. Although the flavor is good, it sucks biting into whole pepper corns with every chomp of the teeth.  \"Oh, well that's how southern bbq comes\"... I've spent 16 years in culinary. Grew up and trained in Texas as pitmaster.. that's not how it is.   Overall, sad disappointment. I'm surprised this place is still open. The one good thing they have going for them here is the fact that this is now the only bbq place in this area.  Famous Dave's sucked as much as a bbq place could suck... but, we were never once served cold bbq meats!!",

However, it took 30 minutes for our food to come out (3 basic entrees) and it wasn't that busy. Second, the meat was so greasy. My son's brisket was 90% fat and 10% meat. My pork, which was on a salad, was dripping in fat and really rough to chew. Third, it's pricey. Our bill was $44 for a sandwich combo, an entree salad, and a two meat plate. We had water to drink. Won't be back. Too many good BBQ places in town to eat at.",

I ordered hush puppies as my side. On the positive side, the sides were piping hot and very tasty. The meats unfortunately came out cold. They did get us replacement plates but they sadly didn't look as appetizing and seemed to have a smaller portion on the meats.

The portion sizes vary a lot between visits, seems to change based the mood of the person in the kitchen.  It's legit Arkansas BBQ and since I'm from the Ark-La-Tex, it gives me that down home feeling when I eat here.  But this place wouldn't be anything special if it was actually in Arkansas, it would be half the price and it's just special because it's located here.  There are a lot more good legit BBQ places here now than there was when I first moved here.  I do like their large and varied menu, and the meats are good quality and generally cooked just right.  Their sauces a little watered down and lacking in kick, but they're alright.  The food at this location seems to be just the same as the food at the original location.  Don't pre-tip if you order thru Eat24, they messed up my order today, leaving me to have to try to divvy up what food we did get.  I just got refunded for the missing items, nothing back on the delivery fee or way to change the tip.  Food was cold, too.",

I got the duo plate and it was plenty of food. The service was really fast. What a great BBQ find!",

All the sauces were good but the mama sauce was my favorite. I understand some find it expensive but the portions are huge. We fed our family of 5 for $30! Can't wait to go back soon.",

Order line on the left, registers in the back and the rest eat in sitting area. Small but I hear they will put an outdoor deck in which is great for 3/4 of the year here in Vegas. OK onto the food. The briskett ia the real deal and you can order, sliced, chopped, burnt ends or three ways. Do yourself a favor and order it three ways My son had the pulled pork and gave it a thumbs up and my niece loved the ribs. The menu is vast with lots of sides and some great sauces! Arkansauce and country girl were our favorites! There's new BBQ place on Summerlin and Reggie Hammond says come check it out. We will be back for more!",
