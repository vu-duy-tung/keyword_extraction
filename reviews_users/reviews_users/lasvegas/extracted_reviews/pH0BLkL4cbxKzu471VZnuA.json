Takes out decisions, and also gives you an ultimate dining experience.  Now I do say, bring your cash, but you do let them know the budget.  Between 50-90 per person you can have an absolute blast and a very unique memory.  I will always suggest this place to people visiting and I hopefully will be back soon.  Thanks for the great service!",

The ambiance is fun but a little busy.  It can be difficult to hold a conversation.  I started out with the red miso soup with mushrooms.  It was way to salty even for miso.  I ordered some sashimi and a sushi roll with foie gras.  It was good but not great.  My wife ordered a bunch of sides (she's pregnant and was craving rice, beans, and plantains all at the same time!).  She complained that the food was a bit too spicy.  We ordered mochi for dessert.  They were pretty good but standard without anything standing out.  Overall, there are better options for sushi.  The Latin infusion was kind of gimmicky and did not always pair well with the Japanese dishes.",

    "text": "I had the chance to go back this past weekend and got a completely  different experience the second time around at Sushi Samba.   After a fun filled weekend adventure in Vegas, we decided to give SS another shot. It was my cousin's birthday, and we figured we would stop by for a farewell Vegas-Birthday dinner. We stayed at the Venetian, which made SS a stone throw away. We couldn't have came at a better time, the environment was so much more personal than the time before. I highly recommend avoiding peak dining hours if possible. This will give you time to enjoy your meal while getting some extra attention from servers. Since we arrived at around 4pm on a Sunday, the timing was perfect.   Our party grabbed a couple dishes and shared them all. This was the perfect way to sample everything. We started our mission into Japanese/Peruvian/Brazilian adventure with...  Otsumami: A mix of three appetizers. Edamame, Fried Green Beans, and Grilled Shishito Peppers. My absolute favorite was the Shishito Peppers. They were doused in sea salt and lemon, and one out of every couple were spicy. Perfect mix to the subtle hues of the Edamame.   Yellowtail Seviche: Little tiny tacos filled with a mixture of yellowtail, onions, avocado and a side of chile sauce. These little babies packed a flavorful punch!  Next up was the Smoked Alaskan King Crab Leg: Wood fired, served in the half shell, perfectly cut and smothered in a signature sauce. These were so delicious and just melted in my mouth like butter!  Round four, Peruvian Bay Scallops: Served in the shell as well, perfectly cooked. You can tell that they know how to prepare their seafood because everything tasted so fresh. This was my cousin's favorite dish and her first time ever trying scallops.   Then came out the Rock Shrimp Tempura. We could hardly eat anymore, however we asked for the most flavorful, scrumptious items, and intended on finishing them! After that, the Yellowtail Sashimi. It had spicy blended orange sauce on it, that was the perfectly paired with the fish. My personal fave of the night.   Make sure to order a signature cocktail while you are there. We had a couple (after all, what kind of birthday is complete without drinks?), and the one that really stood out was the Chu-Cumber. It was like you were drinking the most exquisite cup of tea mixed with the cool tones of cucumber, all while getting a little buzz on.   My taste buds are so happy that I gave Sushi Samba another shot. The best part was, management remembered that it was my cousin's birthday, and brought out a little slice of carrot cake with ice cream and sparklers crowning the top. It was definitely a birthday dinner that we will all remember.",

The cod is dipped in unique sauces that even the most seasoned palates can't distinguish.  The sushi rolls have some sort of flair that make me want to watch Dragon Ball Z while doing the samba during Carnival.  The Chilean sea bass is basically an orgasm in your mouth. Lord almighty!

    "text": "Planned a 12-person dinner celebration here for a bachelorette party over labor day weekend and couldn't have been happier with the choice!   Sushi Samba was great from the get-go. We emailed them to see about their pre-fix ordering menu for bigger parties, and their events coordinator got back to us immediately with all the important details.  The night of our reservation, my friend and I arrived at the restaurant early with some requests for our dinner. The hostess brought out the manager AND our waiter to speak with us directly. Both accommodated us perfectly in our requests for pre-ordering drinks, finding an ideal price-point for our group, and making sure the menu suited our needs.   We were seated in their backroom at a great big table. Our waiter was extremely friendly without being overbearing. We ordered the family-style meal and asked for options on the lighter/fresher/fishier side of things. All items we got were awesome-- they hit the nail on the head with our requests:   green bean tempura, tuna tataki, ceviche tacos, terriyaki fish skewers, a wide variety of sushi, edamame... and even more! They also made special plates for one of the girls who didn't eat raw fish. Bonus points right there!  At our price point (about $40/per person before tax and tip) we had plenty of food and even extra left over. Splitting everything family style made for a really fun evening and made splitting the check extremely easy.   I would definitely recommend this place to anyone planning a party. Now I just have to check out Sushi Samba in Chicago!",

They chat with their guests, offer great suggestions, listen, and make them feel important, basically what a bar staff should do.  Rico and Buen were the reason I came back on night #2 and Erica was the cherry on top.  Also kudos to the fantastic GM for understanding what guest service is all about.

The sushi here is different that the sushi you will get at a normal sushi place. It's a Peruvian fusion so it has a different feel to it, but still delicious! We also ordered some of their wagyu beef which is expensive but SO worth it! You get to cook it yourself on a hot rock at the table and they bring a selection of sauces and seasonings to make it an adventure. All of the entrees were amazing, we had the sea bass skewers, which came with Peruvian corn that was absolutely delicious!  For appetizers we had the yellowtail tacos as well as the beef ones, and an appetizer with a scallop that I can't remember the name of. I had a pisco sour to drink which tasted just like the ones I had in Peru. The service was stellar and our drinks, including our hot tea, were always kept full. All in all, I will be back, and soon!",

Tried the Tonkatsu Ramen ( enough for 2) and the Sao Paulo which is a delicious scallop massago, red opinion, tuna, salmon, shrimp, whitefish, avocado, TRUFFLE, chimichuri all in one.  The Ramen was mediocre and the roll was nothing to spectacular. Nothing I would crave but if it was one of the few places open I would consider eating here again!",

The second we arrived we were treated like Queens! Everyone was so friendly and the atmosphere was perfect. I felt like I was inside a wonderland. We will definitely be going back the next time we are in Vegas ! Good food, drinks, service and company. Winning. Thank you Colin and Yasbert for making it a dinner to remember.",

    "text": "Sushisamba was the perfect place for our outing in Vegas.  It had fresh sushi and delicious! Not to mention, it was within our hotel, Palazzo for an easy drop by for dinner.  Was in Vegas for my bachelorette party and needed a quick bite before our last outing. Reservation was a breeze by using OpenTables.   Ambiance was hip and had lot of round booth tables for big parties and many alike us were celebrating bachelorette parties.   We ordered to following, while the server did mention that the server caters to your likes and dislikes and order your small plates to share, we opted to just order as we were in a hurry.  Also had mentioned it was a Japanese, Peruvian, and Brazilian fusion.  Overall I would describe it as an upscale sushi joint.  Uni sashimi - super fresh and delicious uni from Catalina, CA at a decent price! Was one of our favorites. Rock shrimp - every restaurant has different twists to it, but it was a bit too crispy for my liking and the sauce didn't really have much zest to it Yellowtail tacos - while the concept was great, it was slightly missing something.  Maybe they should make the taco shells a bit more crispy and highlight the dish with stronger sauce.   15 piece sashimi plate - while fresh, nothing too special or out of the ordinary.  Would recommend in ordering your favorite fishes individually Sao Paolo roll - I was eyeing it the whole time to order it, but didn't because we were watching our carbs that night.  Luckily one of our friends ordered it and it was the best dish for me!  The truffle oil was seriously the most delicious sauce that tied it down and there's barely any rice, so it was perfect!  Would get this again and again.  Based on our meal, would stick to the rolls and individual sushi/sashimi to your liking for their freshness.   At the end, we got a complimentary celebratory cake/ice cream pops!  I apologize to the manager that brought it out to us... I guess I was too absorbed in wanting to take the picture I must have muted him out as he was speaking to me/congratulating me... as my friend pointed it out.  I totally didn't mean to do that.",

However, my tablemates raved about the sushi and even ordered second plates to satiate both their stomachs and their taste buds.   Came here for a friends birthday lunch and was pleasantly surprised by the variety! I didn't have to force feed myself sushi--that's a win in my book.   There were Japanese, Peruvian, and Brazilian dishes. You can see the chefs cooking, too.  I ordered a plate of chorizo. It was meant to be a shared appetizer. However, it was small, so it was a perfect serving size for one person. Pretty standard taste. I also ordered a side of Peruvian corn. It was incredibly filling because it was denser and chewier than the sweet corn I'm used to consuming--I wish the corn was a smaller serving size, though.  Paid $13 for the chorizo and corn.  On the weekends, you can order off the brunch menu from 11:30 a.m. - 4 p.m. The menu had french toast, quinoa waffles, yogurt dishes, churros, and more.  The setting was intimate. It was extremely dark, but beautiful. Subtle bursts of oranges and reds accented black marble walls and floors.   The bathroom was HUGE. Lots of stalls and very clean.  3 stars because two people at our table hated their fish skewers and thought they were undercooked.   Having so much variety might hurt the restaurant...when some dishes are much better than others, that's a red flag.",

The establishment is a bit packed due to the arrangement of tables and chairs, and it is loud. It's a fun place in Vegas, but I wouldn't recommend for someone seeking a quiet, intimate atmosphere.  The Miso Chilean Sea Bass was perfection. It was cooked just right, and the sauce it was covered in was delicious. I only wish there had been more of it! We opted for the ones on skewers this time around. 5/5  Everyone raves about their Peruvian corn. The kernels are much larger than your standard corn, and when cooked are starchy and chewy. I didn't dislike them, but I don't think I would go out of my way to order them again. I thought they were actually a little bland. 3/5  The Neo Tokyo Roll was good, but nothing to write home about. The tuna was very fresh! Nothing wrong with this, but considering the price, I feel like I've had this before at every typical sushi joint. 3/5  I would honestly come here just for that Miso Chilean Sea Bass. That alone would be worth the visit. Next time I'm going to get the larger portion all for myself!!",

Ryan H., our server, was wonderful. He gave us some recommendations on his favorite dishes and we tried a few. We especially love the Wagyu Beef Gyoza which was so tender and melt in your mouth. We had the Samba Strip with Maine lobster and the Neo Tokyo with bigeye tuna. All were so delicious. At the end of the meal, they brought out ice cream pops for my daughter to celebrate her birthday. What a wonderful gesture and we really appreciate that.   Now we have one more restaurant to add to our favorite sushi places to go when in Vegas.

All of the food that i have tried is so tasty but the Asevechado roll is OUTSTANDING and got it every time. The bar is nice and quaint, the bar staff very friendly and the sake and other cocktails are a good selection. I highly recommend it, and will be hitting it one last time before I head back home.",

    "text": "*bites fist*   I don't know where to begin... Let me just say I had the worst service by the rudest and most dismissive people at Sushi Samba - ever!   - The edamame was cold - Sushi rolls were tasteless  - Appetizers - tasteless   I made the waiter aware that I have a shellfish allergy and then I asked questions and ordered my food. When one of my rolls came out the waiter said,\"The tempura is fried in the same oil as shellfish, but if you don't care we don't care either!\"   Did you read what I just said he said to me?  Okay, so very confused I handed the cups of tempura back and ate my food very disgusted in how he talked to me. The main waiter pretty much avoided our table. When I told him what was said to me he said,\"I don't know why he would say that to you.\" Wait a minute does basic customer service ever occur to you people? How about you apologize! So he says I'm going to get the manager I said no don't.  He tells the manager anyway and the manager walks over in a drive by motion and drops the updated bill on the table and says we removed the roll and kept walking.  Again NO apology or acknowledgment! I didn't need the roll taking off, I just needed a sincere apology and they made it clear they weren't going to give me one.   I asked myself why did they behave the way they did? I realized it was because we weren't dressed up like the other patrons. They assumed we were poor, so they treated us in a dismissive manner. They assumed that I was only complaining about the roll, because we couldn't pay our bill - False!   Sometimes all customers want is to know that you appreciate their business and whatever mistake took place won't happen again and just maybe an apology to go with.   Terrible service...",

It's tough to rate restaurants on the strip merely because of the price tag but ignoring the inflation, I thought Samba had a good vibe, fairly good/quick service, and a decent amount of tasty tapas/appetizers. Ironically, I hated all their sushi (mushy, bland sushi rice is no bueno).  I love the concept of Samba, and stick with the appetizers and small plates.   Things I liked - Mushroom Tobanyaki: half mushrooms, half butter. Delicious. - Seared Wagyu Beef: Small but good.  Pretty good: - Crispy egg: mostly crispy stuff, not enough eggy goodness - Broiled scallop:   Do not get: - Any of the sushi",

    "text": "This place is a hidden gem within the Palazzo if you feel like treating yourself and lightening your wallet just a bit. They serve a variety of dishes inspired by Peruvian, Brazilian, and Japanese cuisine. We didn't really know where to begin, so the waiter suggested doing an \"omakase\" (chef's choice) style of offerings depending on how much you'd like to spend. He suggested creative sets with various price ranges, so we opted for one that ended up costing about $155 a person (without drinks and including tip). The wagyu beef steak strips were prepared raw where they provide you a hot rock (forgot what they call it) that cooks your meat for you and a platter of sauces and various types of salts. To be honest, I didn't need those seasonings because the meat alone was mesmerizing. Also, you have to eat it with the sliced pears because it's a slightly sweet and crunchy compliment to the savory melting flavor the beef provides. The other dish that blew me away was the chilean sea bass. They serve it on a stick which made it look like a lollipop and I sure devoured it like one on a fiery hot summer day.   Other things we tried that were enjoyable were the wagyu gyozas, sushi rolls (nothing special), various sashimis, and this tasty egg roll looking appetizer that had crispy vermicelli and scallops inside.",

But the only thing that continuously has us coming back is Sushi Samba. The service, ambiance, and food really is that good. Of course, you can't come to Samba and not get seabass. I love this dish so much, it's truly the only thing that keeps me coming back. The fish literally melts in your mouth and the Peruvian corn with it is the perfect compliment. If you go there and don't get it, consider it a mistake.  Of course the sushi is some of the freshest around. I love how innovative their rolls are and you can taste how fresh things are and not imitation like the rest of the Vegas. Keep up the good work samba!!",

The restaurant was dead yet we were packed into one area, on top of the other dozen couples in the restaurant. I HATE when places do that. We were literally elbow to elbow with strangers in an empty restaurant - UGH.  Second, since we were so close to everyone else we observed first hand what awesome service they were getting. It was too bad our waiter was different (his name was Kiley I believe) and he SUCKED. Disappeared for long periods of time, took forever to take our order and bring drinks, didn't ever say when he'd be back around, didn't check on us, didn't apologize, took forever with the check. Really bad service made worse by the excellent service everyone else around us seemed to be getting.  Third, the only redeeming thing about this place was the food. It was excellent. However, it was overpriced and the portions were really small. Normally I could overlook bad service and a weird atmosphere if the food is great but not with this place. I can say for certain that I will not be back here - especially in Vegas where good food and good service are the gold standard. Sushisamba isn't worth a second chance.",

You can definitely taste the tequila in that one so if you like girly drinks, then stay away. For apps, definitely get the wagyu gyoza.. it just melts in your mouth! Gyoza will never be the same again. Mini taquitos are also a must! Love the wagyu mini taco. For my sushi roll lovers, get the samba strip and the sao paulo roll. Expensice, yes, but total game changers. Main entrees, go for the sea bass and the bone in rib eye... medium rare! The sauces in those two entrees compete the meal. I'm not a fan of ordering chicken when I'm out at restaurants, but I also had the chicken teriyaki and even that was cooked well. Not dry, very moist. Next time I come back, I'm getting the wagyu cooked at the table on a grill!",

However, SushiSamba DOES NOT KNOW HOW TO RUN A RESTAURANT.  People should receive their food in a timely manner and have the entire table party served at reasonable times so that they may enjoy their dinner as a group.    SushiSamba should just be a bar where you can get drinks and perhaps some french fries.  I am very surpised that that this restaurant is still in business.  I have also informed my friends to make sure they never come here and waste their money.",

We tried the yellowtail sashimi ceviche, the lima samba roll, the sea bass anticuchos, the pork belly robata, and the mango tres leite. SOOOOOO Happy my favorites were the yellowtail ceviche it had a perfect little bite to it, just the right amount of heat and the lima roll was almost like butter in your mouth.",

    "text": "My boyfriend took me here for my 24th birthday.   To start off, the cons of this place was that it was super cramped and nothing was done even though they asked us what we were celebrating.. Kind of lame in my opinion. But onto the food..  My boyfriend ordered an assortment of things and everything I tried was relatively good, some amazing while others were just good.   We had the crispy taquitos: 1 yellowtail and 1 japanese wagyu. Both were so good and flavorful!! I can't even explain it.. But they were so small.. Like a 2 bite and that's all kind of thing.. And for the price of it, I can't justify it.. Lucky enough for me, it was my birthday and my boyfriend took care of the tab.   We also had the kanpachi tiradito. This was hands down the best thing all night! I kept thinking about it even after the meal and even to this day. It comes in 4 thin slices  for $19. So expensive, but the truffle oil and the sauce that accompanied it pulled through together so well.   The sea bass anticuchos was pretty good too.  It was like 4 pieces of fish on each skewer with 2 skewers. The glaze on the fish was good and the fish was cooked perfectly while still having the flakiness.  I also had the uni sashimi, hirami nigiri and yellowtail jalapeno rolls. Those tasted like how they should be.  Because my boyfriend didn't think we would get full, he ordered the rio grande churrasco. The meats were good and flavorful. A bit on the salty side but the greens and rice helped to balance it out. This dish felt somewhat out of place because everything felt so light, but this was definitely too filling and we had to pack the rest to go.   I would definitely love to come back, but I'm sure it won't be for a long while.",

The sashimi was buttery; the Wagyu beef was tasty with an exceptional presentation.  Oh, did I mention the drinks?  We had three different ones and they were all worth reordering.

I don't know what is all the hype about Sushisamba. There is one in Chicago and New York I believe, but I don't know why it's supposed to be so good or cool.   One of the roll my fiance and I got had charboiled steak on it, which made the whole roll taste like charcoal. I also wasn't impressed with their special sauces like key lime mayo on their other rolls, but I guess you need some kind of gimmick to make your products special. The overall look of the rolls were the best I've seen either. Come on, Sushisamba. You have to step it up.   The rolls were fine. I would be happy with them at another sushi place for a decent price, but since it was overpriced and small in size, I will never been happy with this place.",

That was seriously the best tasting seabass I've ever eaten.  We also had the Seaweed Salad, california rolls, and salmon/avocado rolls, along with some edamame. I love seaweed salad, but this one pretty much had ZERO taste. The rolls were good, although my husband complained that the rice was too sticky.   One point I don't want to forget to make is about the service. I thought our server Phil was excellent. He was very knowledgable about my husband's need to eat gluten free and if he didn't know something, he did not guess like so many people do...he went to the chef and confirmed. Great job Phil!  While I'm not sure I'd return for another meal here, I would return for a pre-dinner app to eat that Seabass Miso. So worth it!",

It really just tasted like a delicious smoothie. I wanted something more substantial than sushi so I ordered the quinoa chaufa side. The portion was decent for a side and the flavor was even better than I was expecting. There were some veggies mixed in with the quinoa. I also ordered roasted seasonal vegetables, which was also good, although just a tad oily. The salt was not fully incorporated (a couple bites were super salty) but the veggies were cooked perfectly and the variety was nice. The dish included zucchini, Brussels sprouts, asparagus, onion and some sort of bean, I think. The restaurant is decorated well and is not as sterile feeling as some of the other restaurants inside the hotel. Our waiter was also very nice and helpful.",

    "text": "If you want to try some sushi that's prepared with a delightful spin then this place is perfect for you. The atmosphere resembles a club more than a high class restaurant.  It's filled with fast-paced dance music and most of the guests are dressed like they are ready for the club after dinner.   The defining feature of the restaurant comes from its mixture of Japanese and Brazilian cuisine. Our server recommended the seviches and tiraditos; since we couldn't decide which one to get we ordered both! Seviches are sashimi served in a fruit/salsa. We had tiger shrimp in a mango salsa and tuna with grapefruit and jalapenos. The sashimi was super fresh and I loved the fruit/salsa combo.  It was sweet and refreshing. Tiraditos are sashimi immersed in a tangy sauce, probability the only dish I wasn't too fond of though.  The sauce was too sour and it overwhelmed the fish.   If eating an endangered animal does not affect your conscience I would highly recommend the Chilean sea bass skewers. The fish was amazing, the meat practically flakes off on its own and the unagi sauce was so Umami!   I saved the best for last. imagine eating all of the finest food: foie gras, caviar and gold?!?! all in one bite. Hurry to Sushisamba and order the Yamato roll.  At first the combination of those above ingredient wrapped in a tuna roll may seem excessive, but it absolutely worked.  It is the best roll I ever had.  The caviar and gold were subtle, but the foie gras, infused its smoky buttery flavor to an otherwise ordinary but fresh tuna roll, made it special. I would like to add, the foie gras was one of the finest I have ever eaten and it came from a SUSHI restaurant.  Try Sushisamba if you are in Vegas to get a delectable and unique sushi experience.",

I was skeptical but I love everything else in the roll and figured it was worth trying since it's a highly recommend fusion place.   Turns out, mozzarella goes about as well on a sushi roll as you would think - meaning, it's terrible. It might've been the worst sushi I've had in my life.   However, the tiny yellowfish taquitos were amazing, and my friend tried a new Japanese whiskey the server recommended it, and it was delicious.   Still, probably wouldn't go back.",

It's conveniently located in the Grand Canal Shoppes in The Venetian and, with as packed-in as those shops are, this restaurant is very roomy and spacious - a great place for larger parties.  There was a large variety of dishes that were ordered among these two nights I was there and among the rest of the attendees, but the consistent small plate favorites were the Wagyu Beef Gyoza and Rock Shrimp Tempura. Roll favorites was the Samba Strip, El Topo and the Lima. Otherwise, we ordered a ton of shishimi and nigiri, all of which was generously portioned out and had fantastic flavor.  SushiSamba has quite an interesting concept in that it's a Peruvian-Brazilian-Japanese infusion, but the combination of flavors and cultures are very uniquely highlighted in the best ways possible with each dish. You'll love it!",

The yellowtail and kanpachi sashimi are super fresh and delicious. I also love their heavier dishes. The new teriyaki chicken is bomb, the skin is crispy on the outside and the purple mash potato is sweet, they go perfectly together! The sea bass is amazing too! It's super soft and tasty with the miso sauce over it! The ramen is legit and yummy, broth isn't too heavy and salty. The fried calamari is nice and light, not too oily and greasy!",

I had a huge grilled squid, a filet mignon, ebi nigiri, a special roll, and dumplings. Everything was delicious! The steak was melt in your mouth, and the sushi roll was so good I wanted to order 2 more but the price tag told me other wise ($27-yikes!).

The favorites for appetizers: green bean tempura, shishito peppers, rock shrimp tempura and edamame.   For the mains: the miso Chilean red bass was amazing. It comes with some organic vegetables. It was seasoned and cooked perfectly. We also got the hot stone which was a hit with the group.   For the sashimi: yellowtail and salmon were both good options.   All the sushi rolls were delicious.   The brisa caliente was my favorite cocktail. I also enjoyed the cold sake which I normally don't like. The Japanese rice beer was also good.",

Seriously.   The squid and tomato apps were ok, but I'm not sure what was up with the oysters.   Texture was definitely off.   And I'm not sure I've ever had kumamotos taste like that.    If you all don't hear from me then you know what happened  he said the sea bass was good but the Brussels sprouts in the mixed vegetables were too underdone.   And when you serve food with chopped sticks it's kind of hard when things aren't cut....the sushi was underwhelming.   The corn and the plaintains however were quite nice.    If you do decide to numb your ear drums ala rock concert, I'd stick with the cooked stuff...edited to add...had Kumamotos again tonight at a place we've been going to for years for oysters and seafood, and tonight's oysters did not have the odd texture and flavor we got last night.   More fool us for not sending them back.  Especially at five bucks an oyster!",

The soy sauce tasted really weird, I am not sure if it was low sodium or not because they put it in their own container. I would like to try something else there other than sushi. The rolls were expensive $17 and $10), which is overpriced for what I got but seemed pretty standard for vegas.",

The uni nigiri was so good, we had to place another order! The service was two thumbs up. Everyone was very attentive as to refilling our waters and making sure we were okay. This is my second time at this place and both experiences were beyond great. I'm craving and drooling as I write this review. Haha. Would definitely come back when I'm back in Vegas!",

Coughing on us while we read our menus and then handling my plates and glasses (we were hoping someone else would, but he still came over to the table and moved stuff around) grossed us out.

We had small plates; the rock shrimp, purple mashed potatoes, broiled scallops, smoked salmon nigiri (so fresh), and BEST of all wagyu gyoza.

The bar is long, but because of the great specials, as well being a good place to meet up with friends, this spot fills up quickly.  There is sushi on the happy hour menu.

    "text": "Wow! I'll start off with that. This place was very good and the dining experience here was great.  A buddy and I sat at the sushi bar, the lady brought us over the menu, we browse it, deciding what to get and really couldn't decide.  The server stops by and explains some items and then also mentions we have the chef's choice (omakase) and we hesitate for a minute and sure, we'll take two.  The first course was string beans tempura, boring right?  No, the truffle aioli sauce that came with this was amazing.  I can't even explain the taste, it was really good.  You can drink it with a straw.    The second course pork gyoza, sitting on a squash puree of some sort, I want to say butternut squash or something similar.  These were OK, nothing special.  The rock shrimp tempura was delicious, nice spicy mayo sauce on top.  And the last component was a yellowtail taquito.  I liked these and it was served with a spicy sriracha sauce of some sort.  Third course was meat heaven.  Grilled pork tenderloin, hanger steak, and ribeye.  Woo-wee!  I have to say though, some of the ribeye was a little charred, particularly the end pieces, but the middle was done right, medium-rare.  The hanger steak was good, tender and chunks of fat, good stuff.  The pork loin was awesome.  This dish is served with three sauces, two types of chimichurri and some peruvian pepper puree sauce that was unreal!  The pork fit so perfectly with this sauce, so recommended for anyone.  The chimichurri was so-so, not so great, but still good.  The last course consisted of rolls.  They have a special spicy yellowtail tuna roll with tempura flakes, but I thought this was OK, I've had better.  Then a simple salmon and avocado and eel and avocado.  I've had the eel/avocado mixture many times, but I must say this is the best I've had.  The typical black sauce that's topped on was really good.  It had a sweet taste to it and all the flavors meshed oh so well.  Good stuff.  My companion was done as we had so much food.  I decided to take a dive and get some dessert.  It was a chocolate, white chocolate pudding/custard type consistency and some crushed chocolate granola on the bottom.  It was OK, not that good.  Overall, great spot and recommended.  The chef's choice isn't as steep as all vs Nobu and Morimoto's (where I've had both).  You get the \"fusion-ness\" from the Peruvian and Brazilian influence.  Luckily there's a few on the east coast in NYC, so I don't have to travel as far.",

    "text": "I agree with the reviews below, they did a great job of explaining the menu in more detail than I could.  Gave this place 4 stars for originality of food and drinks, and the atmosphere.  It was not too dark, not too bright, with artsy decor on the walls and different pictures rotating on projection screens (NOT PG rated, BTW, I saw a breast or two flash by, though there were nice scenic pics in there too.)  They have a club/lounge in the back of the restaurant, which was recommended to us by a Dior employee at Caesars mall, he said it was a mix of hip hop music and some other music, he went on a Saturday.  However, we weren't able to go since it's not open on Sundays.  Me and two other girlfriends of mine went here late on a Sunday nite (sat 10 pm?) and there was no wait.  Not that this matters, but an added bonus was that our waiter was HOT!  hehe.  Anyways, the menu had a lot of things that I had never heard of before, so if you're not used to Brazilian / Peruvian / Japanese food then the staff should be able to explain it all to you before you order.  We ordered the tuna ceviche and shrimp ceviche for appetizers (see reviews below for details of the dishes I talk about here).  Both excellent, and fresh, and a decent-sized portion (about a cereal bowl full), but pricey at around $15-17 each.  We also ordered spicy tuna rolls, which were excellent (the tuna practically melted in our mouths) as well as the BoBoBrazil roll, which Mr. Hottie Waiter recommended - slices of Kobe Beef atop a roll with a bunch of good stuff in it that I didn't know (sorry to all you food buffs!).  I think it was a mix of onions?  Both very good.  As far as cocktails, I would definitely recommend the Chu-Cucumber cocktail.  I think that's the name of it.  Again, Mr. Hottie Waiter recommended this, which I decided to try even though it didn't sound good at first.  It was surprisingly refreshing!  It has some sort of Japanese liquor in it, which supposedly had a lite Vodka flavor, as well as Roseflower and cucumber.  I ended up having two of these (they were in a martini glass), and the third having substituted the original liquor for Gin, as a recommendation by the bartender, which had a stronger alcohol taste to it.  One of my friends tried the Samba Juice cocktail, which she said was good and tasted a little like sangria.  Overall, great atmosphere, a bit pricey, but original food that you wouldn't find at your regular sushi restaurant.  I would definitely try this place at least once on a trip to Vegas!  Hopefully I'll get to check out the lounge next time!",

    "text": "Once you get past the crowds in the Canal Shops, Samba Sushi is a real find.  Varied menu combining Asian and South American cultures.  We had a shrimp teriyaki roll, an eel roll and a dragon rainbow roll.  Also got the teriyaki chicken skewers with their speciality corn.  Everything was delicious.  No wait time, service was fast, efficient without feeling rushed.  Clean, not terribly loud and Drago was a great waiter.  Prices were OK for Vegas considering that I come from the era of free drinks, shrimp bars along the casino walls and all you can eat buffets.",

The waiters are there to explain everything for you and how there menus work. Its a bit different then your average restaurant. We had so many different platters i dont know where to start. The sushi was just super tasty along with the way they prepare there steaks, pork, etc etc etc....The sauces they give with each dish also has so much flavor! If your looking to spend the $$$ on some really good food with alot of flavor this is 1 of the places to do it! The restaurant itself is fairly loud so when having a conversation your going to have to speak up a bit in order to hear each other, that was the only thing but its vegas its like that. Service was super fast and i really have no complaints about this place. Good job sushi samba!",

This time my boyfriend and I decided to try some different things, best decision ever. Everything we had was scrumptious. His personal favorite was the Carnival Roll, the yellow seaweed wrap made the presentation even better. We also got the Neo Tokyo, which is like a spicy tuna roll but WAY better. The BoBo Brazil was one I had read about on here by another reviewer, which I am glad I did. The sauce on top really did the trick. We also go the Avocado Salmon Roll because it's my two favorite things put together!  I would recommend this place to any sushi lover who wants to try a little twist, and there are many other options on the menu.",

We started out with a house complimentary appetizer  of scallops with pesto and the feast continue on. Top dishes for me were sauteed Hamachi and Sea Bass skewers that we washed down with an excellent bottle of a cold pressed sake.The restaurant decor is  a bit dark but very pleasing on the eye with video of Brazil and Peru projected on walls. The only downside to the dining experience was service that started out a bit rough but then picked up and ended up better. So I cannot give this place 5 Stars although the food really deserves it. I will definitely be back  there when I am in Vegas",

She kept our drinks filled, answered any questions we had (and we had a bunch) and took great care of us throughout our meal. The ambiance was outstanding. It was dark and somewhat romantic.

The food here was delicious, moderately priced for a place in the Palazzo. For the life of me, I can't remember one of the pieces of sushi I ate. It came on a tasting plate with 4 other selections, and it was one of the most incredible things I had tasted in recent memory.  That said, a couple of the other pieces of sushi weren't as good as I hoped. This place definitely isn't Sen of Japan quality, but it's got that awesome Peruvian flair too, so that's cool. The meats were out-of-this-world-bonerific, and I can't wait to go back to focus more on the chorizo.  High five to Sushi Samba for putting Godzilla clips on the TV. Made my meal. Also, there was an abnormal amount of gorgeous women in there on a Thursday night.  Overall, great meal... got a great taste of the menu. Cliff notes are: Better sushi options in the city, chorizo and other meats were top notch, overall solid four stars, would dine again, would recommend to friends.",

I brought my girl and she was like this is the place you keep raving about?! Boy did I feel dumb.  On my first visit I had the Chef Omakase. I was the only one at the bar because I was gambling for so long. I made a killing at the tables and was feeling rather giddy - so I went all out. The sushi chef asked me if I had any allergies/no likes... which is easy for me - no octopus and no squid.   Wow did he come out guns blazing - A toro over warm rice with some special sauce. It nearly blew off my mouth. Then he went with a three lineup selection - Hamachi, Red Snapper and More Maguro.. but these had some sauces and jalapenos and ginger. Nice follow up. I said. How are you going to beat that....  He surprised me with a Peruvian slice of Filet mignon covered with Foie Gras. WOW dang that I guess I will stop doubting this chef. He lined up a couple more slices of sushi and I thought it was over. Pretty good, but I am thinking he is ending on the wrong note when he busts out a fried rice cake with Foie Gras and yellowtail Belly.... I nearly jumped out of my seat of how good that was. After that experience I adamantly recommended this to friends who wanted to try something different.  On subsequent visits with a couple friends we did Omakase again, but this time it was mostly rolls. I mean the sushi was great but the rolls left me wanting. Gone was the foie gras...and with that my 5th star.  On my last visit my girlfriend ate pretty standard stuff nothing spectacular and since we didnt do Omakase I was left on my own to decide which usually means pretty boring. I love the surprises chefs give me  when I order Omakase. Hopefully I will be back and the chef can surprise me and make me change my rating...until that my 4 *'s will stand.   This place does get busy since it turns into a club some nights. Sit at the bar if you want the more crazy experience. I still love this place but with all the places on the strip, other places may get my business...",

Probably the best I've ever had.  The waiter happened to recommend the sea-bass over the scallops for taste & portion size. Good call on his part, showing me that the staff is educated and willing to make suggestions.  The Hamachi and lemon grass was great.  Tuna Tataki- was OK, not great, not bad, The Hamachi Ceviche was tasty as well.       Friends suggested the Peruvian Plate- enough for two, but i was too interested in the menu selection to choose otherwise. He DID goto SushiSamba a bit after me, and ordered it again, so it must be worthwhile.      Overall it was a GREAT dining experience. I will DEFINITELY be back for more. I will probably make this a staple for dining everytime i head back to Las Vegas.",

We only saw our waitress twice during the whole night. Its not like they were very busy either. Only about 1/5 of all the tables were occupied. I've been to Sushi Samba 3 times. I thought I would give them another chance. Maybe I missed something. However, I still don't understand why its so popular. Is just the atmosphere and fancy graffiti on the walls? Prices are WAY higher than they should be. Try Soho Sushi. Its not on the strip. Its about 5 miles away. That place might not be as fancy. However, you will get MUCH better food at 1/2 the price.",

    "text": "What a fabulous meal!  First some background.  We were a group of six New Yorkers in Vegas for a guys weekend of college basketball and good food.  All of us are regularly eating out in relatively expensive restaurants and love a good meal, consisting of both food and service.   Having had an absolutely miserable experience the night before at Gordon Ramsey's Steakhouse in the Paris hotel, we were really looking forward to a nice evening and these guys really delivered.  We were seated promptly and when the waiter came over and suggested that we could order from the menu or if we preferred we could give him a budget and he would serve us a meal.  We asked for a suggestion and he said that we'd really enjoy our meal at $65-70/person unless we wanted to also have a Kobe Beef course in which case we should figure closer to $100.  Having had steaks the night before we gave him a free hand at $65-70.  Course after course of creative imaginative wonderful foods arrived, each one better than the one before. The final course was more traditional sushi with several creative rolls and as a few of us eat a top NY sushi restaurants regularly, we were more than pleased.  By the way, The amount of food server was just right, enough to be satisfied but not stuffed. . Service was terrific all night and for about $125/man including a approximately a 25% tip and tax (we only had one round of drinks) we left planning to reunite in their NY location in a few weeks.",

I was completely unfamiliar with this kind of cuisine, and my friend I was dining with eats very strictly gluten-free, yet our waiter, Homer, could not have been more friendly and accommodating about both things!   I went with two small plates he recommended - the Salt & Pepper Squid and the Berkshire Pork Gyoza - and enjoyed both so much! I had only ever had squid in calamari form, so it was nice to have such fleshy dipping pieces, and the dipping sauces were tasty, one had a little heat to it - yum!  And the Gyoza - should be called Pork Wowza!! Because it is hands-down, one of the most delicious things I've ever had the pleasure of eating! It was pork filled seared dumplings sitting on pumpkin puree, drizzled and served with a side of sweet soy sauce - ohmygoshdelicious - Highly Recommend this dish for newbies like myself or to anyone who likes yummy stuff! My friend had the Mushroom Toban-Yaki and added a filet mignon on top for an additional charge, and the waiter communicated thoroughly with the chef to make sure it was all gluten-free (she also could have the squid, just not the sauces.) I didn't try hers, but she said it was delicious, as well! I absolutely will make a point of eating here next time I am in Vegas and recommend anyone else do the same! And get the Gyoza! So good!",

    "text": "This was hands down the worst dining experience I have EVER had. I chose this restaurant to celebrate a dear friend's 30th birthday because I had read numerous positive reviews online.  The hostess who answered the phone was courteous and professional and we were able to get a prime reservation on a Saturday night. The good stopped there.   Our server was unbelievably rude and unhelpful with the menu. His only obvious desire was to up-sell us on all of the choices we made. I understand the desire to up-sell, but there is a way to do this in a genuine less greedy manner. I would have ordered more drinks if he had even bothered to check on our table, but that seemed to be above him.  The seaweed salad arrived and it was both mushy and very under seasoned.  Then, the real culinary horror arrived: a plate of sushi samba's signature sushi rolls. One roll was topped with burnt foie gras that also tasted a rancid. I mentioned it to the waiter the one and only time he came to check on our table and he told me that, \"Everyone else really likes that roll. I'll have to talk to my manager.\" ummmm???  Why wouldn't you offer me something else from the menu? Why would you let a patron leave dissatisfied?  And that was the last time we ever saw him. It was as though we had offended him and for the rest of the evening he completely ignored us. We waited over 20 minutes for our check to come after the table had been cleared.  I almost got up and left. What an insult to have chosen a restaurant for such a special occasion and then to be treated so poorly.  I would like to note that the bussing staff was excellent. They provided seamless clearing of our plates and refilling of our water.  All in all, Sushi Samba I hate you for ruining such a special night.",

It didn't at all feel like a nice restaurant but the prices sure were! The food was not great either, sushi very basic though they tried to make it sound like it was something special. They tried to charge us a $60 cover charge without telling us prior to our reservations. We stayed at the Venetian which enabled us to get a for 2 for 1 Caipirinha. The waiter took the order then when he brought the bill at the end he said that because it was NYE they weren't honouring it, I asked to speak to the manager where we discussed both issues. In the end she removed it from our bill. I do not recommend this place for sushi, go to the Cosmo Hotel, it's much better and so is the ambiance. Extremely disappointed given that the London and NY ones are amazing!",

This place is really good, only if you order the right things, because ordering something bad can cost you a pretty penny. I have been here twice and the 2nd time was much better because we all knew what we liked.   The Chilean Seabass on the Robata Grill section was probably my favorite rendition of Chilean Seabass. Our waiter said the Robata grill costs $1000 a day to operate? something like that. But wow it was good. You have to order off of this part of the menu if you are a fan of grilled food. Probably the only time I felt like a winner in Vegas all weekend, just playing, kinda, lol.  The Yellowfin taquitos were so unique, and the foam chili sauce that came with it was the perfect compliment.  El Topo - good but not great. Table loved it though.  Rock shrimp tempura with black truffle aoili - if I ever make my dream of opening up a restaurant come True - this will be the first item on the menu. WOWWWW. It made a shrimp convert out of 1 the people at our table. But really how can u not like shrimp?  -P",

I had a yuzu St Germain lychee vodkas concoction that was delicious. The sea bass was well liked by the table although I personally thought it good but not great.

Later, I heard him ask the folks on a nearby table if they would like bottled water, sparkling water or still etc. Then, it took him about 7-8 minutes to come and take my order. And then the food came only 15 minutes later. While I was eating, he never once came to ask me how it was going or whether I wanted anything else.   I had to ask another waiter to get me some hot tea. The edamame was suspect, some pieces were downright mushy. The sushi was only so-so. I have had far better sushi, even at far cheaper restaurants. The sushi rice was not fully cooked and certainly poor in taste. The cloth napkin had a stale oily smell. And the miso soup was too salty. What a waste of money!!",

We ordered 2 orders of the 3 kinds of seaweed 'cos we love seaweed!  I love the crunchy pink seaweed, the light green is the common one and the black seaweed was a little coarser.  All were good!  The Salt and Pepper Squid arrived - succulent and tender.   Next came the Huancaina Fries - Peru potatoes with queso fresco - delicious!  Oh yes!  Our favorites were up next:  Hamachi Kama - Yellowtail fish collar - 2 beautiful pieces charred with a squeeze of key lime and a side of su shohyu sauce - fresh and so tasty!  Each one got one Hamachi Kama - and that's a lot of fish!    Suddenly there was break and no food arrived.  We were wondering what happened... then appeared the manager with 2 plates - one dish of Peruvian Bay Scallops (there were 4 in total)  with on one dish and the other a taco with waygu beef for my mum 'cos she's lactose-intolerant.  I was wondering why the waiter had asked us if we had any seashell allergies or any allergies at about 1/3 of the way into our lunch.  Now, I know why!!  :o).  The manager explained that he wanted to give us these free appetizers 'cos we were repeat customers!  How generous!    We also ordered 2 more rolls - Samba Strip - Maine Lobster - need I say more!  And the Lima roll - shrimp and crab.  Yummy rolls and the best I've ever had!!   Service was fantastic and we will come back again!",

It also came with a serving of rice, beans, and various sauces to dip the aforementioned proteins.  The wagyu picante and rib eye were both melt in your mouth delicious :).  I wish we had a little more rice to go with the meats though.  The highlight of the night is definitely the sushi here.  (Hey, maybe that's why they named the restaurant SUSHIsamba.)

I recommend the Chilean Seabass with the Peruvian corn and the lobster roll. They have an extensive sake menu and depending on your likes/budget there's something for everyone.  The waiter will review the different saki's and give you a taste if you'd like.  Always ask what type of sushi they have that's not listed on the menu. Sometimes they have some pretty tasty things.",

Mimi was a very fun, sharp and attentive bartender and the male bartender was extremely informed on the menu and very quick with taking care of us as well.  We ordered the lemon samurai and Nina fresh as cocktails and wagyu gyoza as an appetizer. The Gyoza was so good we ordered a second set. I got a teriyaki chicken and my girlfriend  had the Chilean sea bass.   The nina fresa was sweet, mellow and complex with a guava juice base and a tang of strawberry. The samurai was sharp, with a nice kick.  The gyoza, like I said, was so good we ordered two. It was tender and done medium. It came with a squash puree and a dipping sauce, which added the sweetness to it.  The sea bass was ridiculously juicy, the vegetables fresh and well grilled, and the sauce very savory. My girlfriend said it was the best fish dish she ever had.  My chicken was remarkable. The meat was juicy and tender, the skin crisp. The teriyaki sauce was made in house and had a spicy aftertaste. It came with crispy onions which accentuated the crispy skin. Everything was on top of purple mash potatoes, not greatly different from traditional mash, but with an aji Amarillo sauce, which was like a mix between squash puree and salty broth.  The service was fast and friendly and flawless. They gave great recommendations and were very patient. They reprint your bill with every order so you know exactly what you've added up.",

Here's what we didn't like: The service: Our waiter would walk away mid sentence to attend to another table. Um hello? Finish your sentence!   The food and drinks: We unfortunately didn't like anything we tried and we tried MANY of the sushi and sashimi options on the menu. For a place that has sushi in its name, the sushi was a huge letdown.  The bathrooms: Weird creepy stalls with sliding doors that reminded me of an airplane toilet and not very clean!   Why 2 stars instead of one? -Our water was refilled constantly! (That's big in my book!) -Possibly the happy hour menu is better? Or the meat instead of sushi? Trying to give them the benefit of the doubt. -They are open late!  With so many better places to eat on the strip, I'd suggest skipping SushiSamba.",

In no way am I putting Sushisamba up there with my favorite Japanese restaurant, Sushi Ran in San Francisco.  But it was definitely worth trying out.  I didn't try the omakase, but I wanted to.  I was with my wife, who doesn't like anything but meat and vegetable tempura, so I didn't want to be limited.  So we just ordered off the menu, which was fine.  The rolls here are definitely different then I'm used to.  What with all of the foie gras and wagyu beef.  The Neo Tokyo Roll was tasty.  I liked the tuna and tempura flakes together.  I also had the hamachi nigiri and the uni nigiri, both of which were very good.  I love uni, and this was good.  We had the seasonal vegetable tempura, which was good.  To be honest, I've had better tempura but by no means am I saying that this wasn't a good dish.  I like vegetable tempura, so I would order this again.  We also had the the three meat Rio Grande Churrasco.  We chose the pork tenderloin, the hanger steak and the ribeye.  The hanger steak was by far the best of the three, with the ribeye coming in second.  It was so tasty.  The pork tenderloin was a bit disappointing.  It was dry and uneventful.  Next time, I'm getting three orders of the hanger steak.  And the sauces were a nice complement to the dish.  Sushisamba is fun.  The food is good.  And the staff is very helpful and knowledgeable.  I had fun here, and I think that adds a lot to your experience at any restaurant.  I can say that I am a fan.",

Are we suppose to share, do you have any suggestions? He takes our drink order and then comes back with a few drinks and takes the order. Some people got all of their food before some even got their drinks. How long to make a cocktail at the bar? Then on to the food I ordered 1/2 fox oysters. They weren't even shucked properly. I had to use my fork to scrape it out of the shell! The Samba Strip roll was gross and super mayo covered. Nobody raved about their food. We just paid our $1500 check, left a 20% tip and left unhappy. Bummed. Worst Vegas meal ever.",

I've eaten at their NY location and it was great, but this was literally one of the best meals I've ever had.     First, make sure you get Isabella as your waitress.  She is fantastic, and took great care of us.    Second, let her do the ordering for you.   Just set her loose and let her take over.  This is absolutely key!    She brought out the best mix of foods and everything just paired so well together.     She started us with a plate of sushi, and then some BBQ, and then back to fish, and on and on.   Each plate complemented the next dish so perfectly, plus she kept the drinks filled.  We had to be rolled out of there, and I felt like I could have kept eating it was so good.  There are a lot of places to eat at in Vegas, but it was so good that we had to come back the next night for another round.",

She asked how much we wanted to spend.  I decided to go all out since it was my fiance's birthday weekend and said we wanted to spend a $100 per person.  I forgot what they brought out to us, but everything was so delicious.  Whenever I think of going to Vegas again, I definitely want to come back.  The service was great.  And we had about 6 people with us, so they just ordered off the menu.  If you don't like what they have on the menu, just have them make one for you.

Albacore Tuna Sashimi - Really fresh. 4. Sea Bass Anticuchos - Loved the Peruvian corn!  The seabass was cooked perfectly and not masked in seasoning. 5. Ishi Yaki Wagyu - A must.  Great presentation with the hot stone and multiple dipping sauces.   6. Rainbow Dragon, Neo Tokyo, Spicy Tuna, Shrimp Tempura Roll - All great and mouth sized bites without a lot of rice. 7. Lychee Bubbletails -  Could not taste the elderflower or lychee. 8. Strawberry Bubbletails -  Really good. Strong strawberry presence.  9. Mojito Supremo - Very good.

I recalled having had a tasty sushi meal in the Venitian canal shops a few years back, so my wife and I headed over there looking for the place.  We ended up at Sushi Samba in the Palazzo shops, which was not the place I remembered but certainly a pleasant experience.  I had always known that South America had a decent population of Japanese people, but had never been anywhere that attempted a fusion of Japanese and South American cuisine.  It totally works, and the restaurant was beautiful inside.  The sushi was excellent.  We tried the chef's selection which came with a nice assortment of tuna, salmon, yellowtail, and shrimp.  We also tried one of the South American dishes - miso sea bass skewers with Peruvian corn.  I had never had anything like it and it was amazing.  In the end the bill for those items plus a few more and a couple of beers came to just over $100, but well worth it.    I would highly recommend this place, and would also recommend you try it for lunch instead of dinner.  At midday there were only a handful of people there and the service was excellent.",

He made some excuse about the system, but one order was wrong after I reminded him of my hamachi order after getting the yamato roll.  We told this to the manager, not sure if he will do anything.  I think we was just going to calm the customer, I told him it was one of the worst services in Vegas, and we have been to many places (including cafes and Joel Robuchon's place) of wide range.  I strongly recommend you complain quickly if you see a skinny waiter with glasses and goatee comes over.  A True disappointment.",

The service is impeccable: when we were walking to the restaurant, we were wondering whether we'd get the same waitress as the previous  time and ... bingo: hello gentlemen, my name is Isabella and I will be taking care of you tonight, shall I make a suggestion?   As last time we let her compose us a menu and dish after dish we were wow-ing and oh-my-gosh-this-is-good-ing. She combined a more than delicious menu with the best Sake, had time for a joke and made sure we had a great dinner.  The sushi was the best we'd had this time in Vegas and the meat was the tenderest. Try the beef with the seven Japanese mushroom sauce! Or better, just let the waitress pick your menu!",

While waiting for my food I browsed the yelp reviews and noticed they have happy hour, but the server didn't mention that or give me the happy hour menu. I asked for it and noticed they had a wine for $6 (instead of $15) and $6 spicy tuna roll (instead if spicy tuna hand roll for $7.75) and some other interesting items. Not a biggie, but I pointed out to the server's colleague that she should have given me that menu right away. The server apologized and cried a few crocodile years. They adjusted my tab to reflect the happy hour prices and I got the Spicy tuna handroll as a free bonus.   The quality and taste of the food was excellent, 5 stars, the environment was chic and nice. The menu is definitely fusion so don't expect to see all your favorites.",

We ordered a number of small plates, being a pescetarian, our meal was restricted to fish and vegetarian items. The shishito peppers were delicious. The Peruvian corn was authentic. We ordered a couple of pieces of nigiri sushi - they were well cut and the rice was warn to the right degree. We had also ordered a salmon roll, it was so so, you could hardly taste the fish, there was too much tempura wrapped around. I had ordered the caipirinha was it was excellent. The service was somewhat sloppy, we placed the drink and dinner ordered, but the drink took forever and the shishito peppers were actually served before the drinks. 3.5 stars.",

We sat at the sushi bar, of course. The ambience was pleasant and our server, Vanessa, was very gracious giving us wonderful recommendations. We ordered: Sashimi Tiradito: Kanpachi (our favorite!!) and Tuna Yamato roll - tuna, foie gras,oysters caviar & gold leaf Lamb chop in red miso & lime Sea bass miso & Peruvian corn Japanese A5 wagyu beef gyoza We loved the flavors of each dish and enjoyed them thoroughly.

There was a group of us that decided to do the tasting menu - and unlike most restaurants that require the whole party to do the tasting menu, they allowed only 6 of us to do the tasting menu, plus they allowed for any dietary restrictions/preferences.    My husband and I both did the tasting menu, which we though was excellent, and the price was amazing - about $60/person, which included about 6-8 courses, which is a great deal.  They had a nice variety of different types of dishes, including raw fish.  The food was creative in taste and in presentation.  They verify a price point with you prior to creating your tasting menu which is very considerate and pretty unusual overall.    In general the service was very good, great at allowing us to get multiple drink orders, serving the other guests that didn't get the tasting menu, and just overall experience was great.    Although the experience was great and the food was good as well, the reason I didn't give it 5 stars was that, overall, I did not feel that the food was amazing enough, to warrant as one of my top restaurants.  No real complaints, just didn't blow me away.  For large parties, I would highly recommend it though, as the service was excellent and everything went super smoothly.",

(not for everyone obviously) If you stay at the Venetian or palazzo and love sushi go here! The Neo-Tokyo roll and Miso soup (with cilantro! WHAT??! Amazing!) was everyone's favorite, simple but delicious and the best price on menu. On the flip side We also had the oyster platter for the table (expensive but beyond worth it) was literally the best oysters any of us had tried. I will literally be back next time I'm in Vegas!",

After getting rebuffed by Delmonico and CUT, we were easily able to secure a table for two spontaneously at Sushi Samba.   In the end, we racked up a bill of $215 for two people. If I could do things over, I would stick to the basics rather than venturing off into the more exotic offerings. The salmon avocado roll, at a cost of $6.50, was by far better than the vastly more expensive offerings served at Sushi Samba.  In fact, I grew so tired of the rock shrimp tempura and the yellowtail jalapeno that I threw in the towel and started ordering basic rolls - the latter of which I loved. For sushi at the high end, I would recommend Nobu or Japonais.",

And the most exciting thing is that they sell a giant yellowfin collar for super cheap.  My mother believes this happens because non-Asians tend not to eat it, but Asians love it. This is probably why my father who once detested it's clubby and loud environment is now willing to venture there all the time.  For the yellowfin collar.  Squeeze some lemon or lime on that and it's good.  Otherwise the ramen doesn't taste like ramen, but like good noodle soup, and the gyoza is tempting but not actually better than the O'Tasty frozen variety.  On the whole though, it's quite good, and a very fun place for dinner.  The drinks are good and strong, very strong, so be prepared.",

Anyways, last month, walking around the palazzo, I checked the menu out as I had seen every single cab here with a Sushisamba ad on top. I was very surprised to see that they had many Peruvian dishes. I guess I just imagined it was brazilian with japanese because of the name. I did not expect to see peruvian corn (i miss you so much).  After much convincing, my bf and I decided to come check it out. We ordered a whole bunch of things. We did not make a reservation but they had enough space to accommodate us. I ordered a plum wine cup which was better than Nobu's. I was very interested in the peruvian part of the menu so bear with me with my choices.  BROILED PERUVIAN BAY SCALLOP shiso lime butter crust 15.00  This was really good. The scallops basically melted in your mouth and it kind of reminded me of the scargots at Bouchon. Very buttery.  HUANCAINA FRIES 7.00  I loved them. My boyfriend felt they did not have much flavor but he is not a big potato eater except when it comes to real french fries. Now, these are not really fries, they are boiled tiny potatoes with huancaina sauce and cheese.  ANTICUCHO RIBEYE aji panca and peruvian corn 13.00  Delicious. I don't know why they don't offer the heart option but I guess people here in the US are not big on trying beef heart anyways.  WILD MUSHROOM RED MISO hand picked organic mushrooms, wakame, white truffle oil 9.00  I didn't like it. My bf liked it a lot he said it tasted \"fresh\"  MOQUECA MISTA shrimp, squid, sea bass, mussels, clams with coconut milk, dende oil and chimichurri rice 33.00  This was the first brazilian dish I've ever eaten and it was just ok. I didn't feel it was great. I think it was undersalted because it was very flavorless.",

Then the food is just savory goodness. Whoever actually came up with the concept to mix Brazilian Peruvian and Japanese cuisine and out together a menu like this deserves a reward for the betterment of mankind. As you can tell I'm a little high in this place. Also have to admit a wonderful cocktail menu. There ceviche is just heavenly.",

    "text": "IT WOULD'VE BEEN 5 STARS BUT THE WAITRESS WAS BITCHY AT FIRST!  Being a HUGE Sex and The City fan, I had to go to this place.  The decor is captivating and the lighting is perfect.  Red is the dominant hue of the restaurant and it is so pretty.   The location in Ceasars is kind of hidden so we stumbled upon it.  We went at the perfect time, right around 3 or 4 and it was not busy.  However, the place got PACKED!  THEY DECIDED TO PUT A ROW OF 6 OR 7 TABLES EXTREMELY CLOSE TOGETHER SO YOU FEEL LIKE YOU ARE HAVING DINNER WITH COMPLETE STRANGERS ON EITHER SIDE OF YOU.  YOU CAN HEAR THEIR ENTIRE CONVERSATION, BY THE WAY.  Just entirely too intimate for me.    Our visit started out kinda rocky.  Our waitress lacked time management skills and/or waited on the other tables hand and foot because she thought they would give them a bigger tip, maybe? Dont know!  All I do know is that we sat there for 25 minutes with nothing more than a hello.  So after compaining to another waitress she finally came around.  While we were ordering, our server was more than eager to answer all of my hyper active, anxious and indecisive friend.    The menu is a combination of Pervian, Brazillian and Asian fusion.  OOOOOH SO DIVINE!  IT WAS SO HARD TO DECIDE ON WHAT TO CHOOSE.  We finally decided on Sushi and Seabass, miso soup and seaweed salad.  The miso is delicious but I've had better.  My friend ordered the Red Wild mushroom and truffle Miso.  IT WAS SOOOOO DELICIOUS!  But, THE SEAWEED SALAD IS A MUST HAVE TO VEGGIE LOVERS.  Seaweed has a distinct taste of it's own but it is sooo friggin good!  I was so pleasantly surprised.  When to food arrived, I was like a kid in a candy store.  I CANNOT REMEMBER WHAT SUSHI I ORDERED BUT ONE OF THEM THE BEST EVER!  As expected, the food is expensive.   Between the 2 of us, it was well over $100. So don't go here if you are trying to save money.  If you do just order the tapas on the left side of the menu.  But, you will still be hungry.  I loved this place.  With the exception of the servers lack of time management skills at first, this was one of my favorite visits on this trip.  I WILL BE GOING BACK!  I LOVE SUSHI SAMBA!!!!!!!",

    "text": "I received a gracious and professional response to my review from SushiSamba. I wanted to take a moment to clarify my review lest the masses get the wrong impression given the critical aspects of my opinions.  First and foremost, the quality of ingredients, the preparation and the service of the staff was impeccable. I'd like to repeat once more that the staff was excellent -- quick, anticipatory, professional and went out of their way to make our experience welcome and enjoyable.  They have an amazing list of sake and wine; one I'd like to investigate and sample from more deeply. And the bartender(s) know how to mix drinks -- great tasting, proper ratios and not too strong or weak, just great flavor.  That the sushi/sashimi was not to my preference should not be misunderstood as not enjoyable to others. The restaurant was still trying to seat a long waiting list well beyond generally accepted dinner hours (perhaps the late night supper club after seeing one of the many shows in Vegas?). The success of SushiSamba is obvious given the strong following and customer base. And I'd like to try their Brazilian offerings. But my preferences for sushi/sashimi, no matter the quality of ingredients, lie with a different style of preparation.",

Fortunately, the quality of food lived up to the expectation and made you think that every bite into the sushi worth every $$$$.  Even thought the restaurant features three international flavors (Japanese, Peruvian, and Brazilian,) we were there straightly for sushi.  Upon opening up the menu, the $$$$ you see under the \"Sushi Bar\" section represents a \"unit\" price, what it means is that for $4.5 - MP, you get \"a\" piece of sushi and not \"an order\" of two pieces which you normally would get in a normal kind of Japanese restaurant.  So if you have a party of 4 and each want \"a\" piece of Hamachi sushi, it will be a total of $18.00...*cha-ching*!   So these were what we ordered: Edame  Uni Sashimi  Capoeira Roll  Pacific Roll  Kampachi sushi  Hamachi sushi  Rainbow roll Tiger Shrimp & Japanese Vegetable tempura Unagi sushi Saba sushi Tako sushi Avacado rolls Hamachi kama x 2 Seaweed salad Desserts (Greentea ice-cream, tres leite, and roasted pot pear)  Great dish presentation and food was exceptional, love the desserts!

The waiter left halfway through the meal and the staff totally forgot about us . I swore I would never go back . Returned to Vegas back in May . The clients wanted sushi. I figured the service was ok before that experience give it one more try. Then I met Vanessa Gonzalez . Im a designer and bring clients all over the country for dinners . This dinner was one of the best I've had . She was phenomenal !! Her recommendations were top notch . The service was unreal ! We loved the whole experience so much we returned a month later and was even happier. I asked for her of course and she outdid herself .  She is the reason i will be a frequent customer at this restaurant .",

We had the perfect lunch to get us through a busy day in Vegas. We had the seared wagyu small plate (always my favorite-I always order this), coconut rice, the samba strip roll and the yuzu tart cheesecake. Everything was delicious and had great presentation. I loved that is was not loud and overcrowded at lunch. We had just the perfect lunch. The specialty drinks are a must. I can't remember the names, but one that had Japanese whiskey in it with pineapple was absolutely delicious. I highly recommend it. The general manager, Jeremy made our lunch extra special with a tasting of a new dish of cooked scallops with a pesto sauce that was dynamite and the miso marinated sea bass dish. Everything was amazing and not heavy. The sea bass to our surprise was our favorite dish, but there wasn't anything we tried that wasn't delicious. It was so moist and had so much flavor. I love this menu because it is diverse and there is something for everyone's specific taste buds and you can easily share if you'd like. My husband really enjoyed the experience here. Thank you to Jeremy for a great experience along with the wonderful wait staff. If you want a meal that is diverse in flavor and presentation and will leave you full, but not heavy and uncomfortable-this is the perfect place. You get the full package here with great service and delicious food. Well worth it.",

I weirdly prefer a distant waiter, so it was a little off-putting to have my drink refilled every time it looked half-empty, but they have a top-notch staff, really.  THE FOOD. Some interesting fusion-y stuff, for sure. I'm a bit of a purist when it comes to Japanese food, so I hesitated at ordering many items, but luckily the group I was with didn't have that issue. The craziest item was the foie gras & gold leaf topped sushi - 100% unnecessary, but it did live up to the Vegas-excess hype that's going on.

    "text": "We checked out this place over the weekend for a girlfriend's bachelorette celebration, and had a fantastic time.  I don't remember our server's name, but he was very attentive, patient and focused on providing the best possible experience. We had a vegetarian in our group, and he was kind enough to tell us about the vegetarian options and even provide a vegan menu for us to explore. My only quip would be the restaurant's \"set your own price & we'll customize the menu \" option - when we heard about it, we were immediately enthusiastic and decided to set a $25 per head price. Unfortunately the server told us that the restaurant wanted a $50 per head minimum for that option... seems a little strange to me.   We ended up ordering off the a la carte menu, which was fantastic. We opted for:  Seared Ahi Tuna Tataki: YUM! Each slice of seared ahi tuna was served atop a spinach leave and with a delightful sauce. Absolutely delicious. I could have made a meal out of this dish alone (if I didn't have to share...hehe).  Otsumami - Blistered Shishito Peppers, Edamame and Green Bean Tempura: We originally planned to order a standard edamame bowl, but we followed our server's recommendation to order this instead. SO glad we did! The dish was a perfect portion for 5 hungry people. A few in our group hadn't tried shishito peppers before, so they were absolutely wowed. The tempura was decent - not mindblowing by any standards, but definitely not oily or soggy like some other tempura variations.  Lima Roll: This roll was fantastic. I like tempura shrimp when it's not in sushi, and this roll definitely changed my mind on that - it was absolutely delicious.  Amazonia Roll: Our vegetarian friend LOVED this roll. It's wonderful that SUSHISAMBA has this option, since the traditional avocado, sweet potato and cucumber rolls can get a little boring for our herbivore friends.  Sao Paolo Roll: My personal favorite! Extremely delicious. Such an amazing combination of flavors and textures.   Somehow, we all had room for dessert and opted for the Mango Tres Leites cake. It was served with a dollop of mango ice cream and a matcha green tea dipping sauce. Overall, a truly delicious end to a fantastic meal. I can't wait to visit the SUSHISAMBA in New York!",

Tell your server your likes/dislikes/allergies and allow them to put together a menu of mini courses that will surely exceed your expectations. I love the yellowtail tacos, all of their sashimi, sea bass skewers, wagyu on hot rock, and every dessert they've ever served me. Additionally, their cocktails are tasty and refreshingly different than anything you've likely tried before. I love the blend of Peruvian and Japanese cuisines. Their staff is always so friendly and eager to provide you with a wonderful experience. This is a must in Vegas and has turned into my favorite place to dine while in town!",

I didn't get to order everything I wanted to, but I will DEFINITELY be back.  Ordered: x TUNA TATAKI asparagus, fresh heart of palm, avocado, tatsoi, crispy garlic citrus soy - I pretty much order tuna tatami everywhere I go and this was good, but not AMAZING. I think I was too distracted by the other amazing dishes. x SALT AND PEPPER SQUID dry miso, shichimi, sea salt, crispy garlic, smoked soy - Probably the best \"calamari\" I've ever had in my life. The squid was so tender and soft and the batter was perfectly fried. x CRISPY YELLOWTAIL TAQUITOS served with spicy aji panca sauce and fresh lime - Ummmm, literally one of the best things EVER. They are more like tacos... but BOMB @$$ tacos to say the least. At $6/ea, they were worth every penny. x ASSORTED TIRADITO - all were good, but the best one was definitely the kanpachi. I could be biased since it's one of my favorite fishes, but OMFG this thing is SOOO good. Next time I'll just order a whole order of just that :)   - YELLOWTAIL* jalapeno and lemongrass - KANPACHI* yuzu, sea salt, black truffle oil, chive, garlic - TUNA* granny smith apple, serrano, lime - SALMON* kinkan honey, garlic ponzu, garlic chip x SEA BASS miso and peruvian corn - Ok, the sea bass was soo good, but the effing CORN was where it was at. They were the biggest, most gigantic corn kernels I've ever seen in my life!! The boyfie enjoyed this one so much he said he wanted to order 2 order for himself next time. x Yellowtail and scallion handroll - Decent handroll, but nothing to rave about. x King Crab handroll - I wasn't going to order this, but crab handrolls are the boo's fave so ordered myself one too. AMAZING. CRAPTON of crab in this handroll and it doesn't come with the disgusting mayo-y sauce like most crab handrolls :)  x A few different rolls which were forgetful.  Service was a little slow, but they were friendly. Crappy job at refilling our drinks, but the food made up for it. Pretty decor and upscale, trendy vibes.  I seriously can't wait to come back. They have Happy Hour Sunday - Friday - 4pm - 7pm and 11pm - close at the bar only. They also have omakase nigiri which I'm DYING to try!",

    "text": "Do you like overpriced Americanized Japanese food? The sushi rolls are huge, so I recommend just ordering one.  Well, one roll will cost you as much as an entire steak dinner at a normal restaurant so to overdo it.  However, if you just won at the tables and would really like to splurge, then go ahead and take the hit.  Typical of all the overpriced restaurants in Vegas, the service is exceptional.  Many people also come here for the decor.  It feels like you are walking into the inside of an anatomical oversized sculpture.  Just sit down, hand them your wallet, and remain calm.  To be honest, the best thing here was the house iced tea; green tea with citrus and mint.  It was free refill and over $4.00.  I definitely made sure to drink my money's worth.",

We also had lots of sushi, the Kobe beef dish with mushrooms and root veggies was super excellent also.  To be honest, I don't know all the dishes we had as we let the chef decide, omikase style.  But all of it was good, or interesting and it was very satisfying.  The chefs here are excellent.  This was my best meal in Vegas in a while.

The green bean and the Shishito were perfectly fried - enough to keep that \"snap\" to the vegetables that I enjoy - and the mayonnaise based dips were delicious.  A little heat and enough flavor to add a bit to the vegetables.  My two sisters and I ordered the Rio Grande 3 Meats.  They were cooked to perfection and even the pork melted in your mouth.  The various dips were great, I liked the vinegar based one, but my sister enjoyed the parsley one (Sorry didn't get the name of it).  My sister also orderd the grilled fish collar.  That was a meal onto itself!  So well cooked.  My niece had the 3 hand roll combo and she loved it. It was wrapped in soy wrap instead of seaweed, so very healthy.  Overall a great experience.",

    "text": "You will earn bonus stars if you: A. Offer Brown Rice Sushi B. Serve Me Peruvian Corn  I didn't know that B was True until I had the pleasure of nibbling kernels of this P-country delight with chopsticks at SushiSamba, so another bonus for educating me about a delicious snack. Snacking is what brought us here. We were wandering around following a mini beer fest and decided we should eat again. When the hostess told us they could do brown rice sushi rolls, we were sold. I really applaud this option, and I hope it will become more popular.  We sat at the sushi bar, and even there, I could appreciate this was an all-eyes-on-fun atmosphere. Attention big parties looking to par-tay this should be on your short list.   Our server was super sweet and helpful. I ordered some miso soup and asparagus and chicken robata. The miso soup did feature cilantro, but I can't say it went to anyplace that miso hasn't been already. The robata were as well prepared and flavorful as any I have had in town. And, oh that Peruvian corn: giant kernels of sweet maize. It came with the robata, and I thought it was divine. I also had several bites of the passion fruit shrimp ceviche, and it was a fruit sensation for sure. My husband ate the brown rice sushi, and I was happy for him to have the option. Overall, the menu and execution are fusion done right.   The server confused my chicken for a beef, really no big deal, but management was quick to intervene and remove the chicken from the bill. This flat out amazed me.   Yes, prices are Strip prices (but they aren't outrageous), and I only sampled some light bites, but based on my overall experience from atmosphere to service, if you are looking for a fun spot to enjoy some creative eats or just some fabulous light bites on the Strip, this is a pretty complete package.",

He let us choose an option where we set a limit per person and he brought out what we fit within that budget. Starting from delicious oysters, to these amazing fish tacos for appetizers we were amazed at the quality and how delicious everything was. We really wanted to try the wagyu and we got the a5 wagyu which melted in our mouths with each bite. We also got an assortment of delicious sushi. On top of that drinks were fantastic. It was an experience in the books! Can't wait to go back!",

    "text": "At the risk of tiptoeing into overly used Yelp cliche territory, SUSHISAMBA serves food with a twist. I've been to SUSHISAMBA restaurants in several cities including Miami Beach, Chicago (now defunct), and Vegas. The Vegas outpost is the most drab-looking one of them, but I'll get to that in a moment. First, the food.  I like that the flavors here are inspired by South American and Asian cooking. It's a mix of Peruvian, Brazilian, and Japanese cuisines. I've never been to these countries, so whether the food hits any authenticity notes is not for me to judge. However traditional or not I enjoy the flavors. Sushi complemented by fruity zesty tangs is appealing to me.   To get a feel for the range of flavors we ordered two appetizers: the jumbo shrimp ceviche and the tiradito sampler.  The jumbo shrimp ceviche was mixed with passion fruit, cucumber, and cilantro and served with plantain chips. The amount of fish was generous and the combination of plantain-based chips, plus the fruity flavors, gave the dish a hint of sweetness that's normally missing from ceviche. I enjoyed this quite a bit.  The tiradito assortment was excellent. As I understand it and as explained by our server Nick, tiradito is similar to sashimi in cut and style, only it is marinated right before serving by any number of juices or sauces. The tiradito here was super fresh and the various marinades enhanced the flavor of the fish without overpowering it, which is a delicate balance to strike. We enjoyed:    Salmon with kinkan honey, garlic ponzu, and garlic chip   Tuna with granny smith apple, serrano, and lime  Kanpachi with yuzu, sea salt, black truffle oil, chive, and garlic  Yellowtail with jalapeno and lemon grass  They were all delightful but I have to highlight the yellowtail which was so subtle and worked perfectly in the lemon grass marinade. It was super spicy with lots of heat but not enough to burn your face off. Honestly that sauce is a gift from god and I would have drunk the remainder from the plate if there hadn't been other people around us. I enjoyed it thoroughly.   For the sushi rolls we got two maki rolls: California and avocado. At the risk of being un-adventurous, I don't like a lot of stuff in or on my sushi rolls. If there's something baked on it or glazed sauce everywhere I'm not a fan. At SUSHISAMBA you have the simple rolls or the featured Samba rolls to choose from, which have the aforementioned unappealing concoctions in and on them.   The dessert was called Sata Andagi which are Peruvian chocolate Japanese donuts with red fruit coulis and sweet cream ice cream. These were served in a deconstructed package meant to give you a small bite of each ingredient as you pieced them together yourself.   Drinks conveyed the mixed flavors of the food in liquid form. We stuck to non-alcoholic and while the standard iced green tea was good, the citrus mint tea was even better. Both were beautiful colors and were refilled multiple times during our visit.    Now the environment: You'll feel like you're eating in a cave. If like me you have poor vision in low light be prepared with the phone flashlight. I could barely read the menu. The restaurant is supposed to be hip and trendy but to me it's a dark box. Right outside is a rather large vacant and unimaginative part of the Shoppes at the Palazzo. Next door is a new Peruvian eatery from Ricardo Zarate called Once, which for the record is pronounced 'On-seh' as in eleven in Spanish, although that didn't seem to register with several tourists around us. But I digress.  Speaking of numbers, I find it odd that everything at SUSHISAMBA is served in three's when most diners are going to be in even-numbered groups. Is there some meaning or significance behind this or is it just to get people to order more food? There were two of us and I kept having to ration one piece of everything on our plates like we were getting ready for the great flood. \"I'll see half your chocolate-filled mini-donut and raise you a spoonful of berry puree with ice cream.\" That's precisely the sort of bargaining you should be doing when your lunch is over a $100.  Despite this and the cave-dwelling atmosphere, the food is a little different than what you'd find in your standard higher-end sushi establishment. It's fresh and flavorful, whether from the fish itself or the zesty and spicy sauces it comes served with, usually a little of both in my recent dining experience here. That's a very good thing if you want to get away from SUSHISAME.",

I've walked past SushiSamba on several occasions, but never thought to stop in for bite. I've been missing out. This restaurant is located upstairs in the Palazzo attached to the Venetian. The staff is so knowledgable. The drinks were spot on. The sushi was to die for. We were fighting over the dumplings...like seriously arguing over the dumplings, and the oysters were huge. I ordered the Teriyaki chicken and purple mash because I'm a big fan of teriyaki and the waitress told me that the mash potatoes were yucca instead of regular potatoes. I absolutely LOVE yucca so I went for it. DELICIOUS! I only wish that I had been able to make another trip over prior to going home. This is my 1st stop on the next trip.",

    "text": "I'm sorry Nobu. I love your Malibu location but the splurge is definitely painful. I mean the food and view is good but the prices can hurt your wallet (unless you're Kris Jenner or Kim Kardashian). Sushi Samba is a similar restaurant in that they pride themselves with their take on Peruvian and Japanese Fusion. Honestly, it has become one of my all time favorite restaurants when visiting Las Vegas.  A huge plus for me is that they are open really late...2AM to be exact. it's a perfect place to grab a bite if you have a late midnight craving. They have a huge arrangement of dishes from sushi rolls to ceviche and grilled options from the Japanese Robata. Prices are very reasonable compared to a lot of other Japanese restaurants on the strip (i.e. Nobu lol).  To be honest, I feel like you get a lot of the same quality of food here with lower prices. One thing I suggest is to bring a few friends so that you can share and try different selections from the menu. Trust me, you will want to try everything :)  What I Ordered:  1. Samba Iced Tea: I LOVE THIS DRINK!!!!!! It's a sweetened iced tea made in house. They infuse black tea with mint, citrus, and the perfect amount of sweetness. I feel like it's an arnold palmer with a hint of a virgin mojito. YOU HAVE TO TRY THIS...ESPECIALLY DURING THE SUMMER.  2. Hamachi Kama aka Grilled Yellowtail Collar: If you're into fish, this is the perfect appetizer for you. I usually get it \"well-done\" so that the skin comes out crispy while the flesh is still moist and melts in your mouth. It also has this addicting smokiness that I love from grilWe've been known to order one collar for each member of our party. IT'S THAT GOOD! Don't forget to drizzle the lime on time before indulging into your first bite.  3.  Wagyu Beef Gyozas: If you had to try ONLY ONE item on the menu, I think this is the one. The wagyu literally melts in your mouth as you first take a bite into the gyoza. No other flavors but pure beefy wagyu bliss. I love how it is served on top of a kabocha squash puree that provides just the perfect accent to the richness of the gyozas. It'll make you cry...  4. Seaweed Salad: It's not your usual wakame salad. They serve you a trio of green, red, and black seaweed that works great together when mixed. Each type has a textural and flavor profile that as a whole is a great palate cleanser. It's nutty, briny, and citrusy. Give it a try!  5. Fried Calamari: Standard. Nothing to special.  6. Alaskan Crab Robata: I usually love crab. But I felt that the rich hollandaise-like sauce took away from the integrity of the crab. The crab itself also had a \"fishy\" taste that I wasn't a fan of.  7. Grilled Yaki-Ika aka Grilled Whole Squid: I LOVE THIS!!!! If you love squid, this is for you. I find that grilled seafood that is simply seasoned with salt is a winner. The charred flavor really brings out the natural sweetness from the squid. It's truly a guilty pleasure.  8. CHURASCO RIO GRANDE [Marinated Sirloin, Ribeye, and Linguica]: Not a huge fan. I don't know if it was because we were so full or if it wasn't over the top. Wasn't memorable.  9. Grilled Asparagus Robata Skewers: Can you imagine how something as simple as asparagus can be so delicious?! Perfectly grilled. It's the perfect accompaniment to all the dishes. So addiciting!  Verdict:  Ok so it's not the cheapest place to eat in Vegas BUT you really get quality food for lower prices than other competitors. It's a fun place to go for a late meal and service is always great. Food is great...I hope it becomes one of your favorites as well :)",

    "text": "Came here with a group of friends.. the place seems to be a japanese, brazilian, and peruvian mix of food.  It had its ups and downs..  What we loved:  service was good, our waiter was nice, and the servers kept our drinks (yay water) topped off throughout the meal.  The El Topo and Samba Strip rolls were good.. as was the Tuna Tataki and Japanese A5 Wagyu Gyoza (we actually joked we could have our entire next meal of Tuna Tataki and Japanese Gyoza.. but we were kind of serious).  The gyoza are like eating delicious perfect burgers, but in gyoza form.  The Otsumami was a good appetizer, and the corn, filet mignon and shrimp in the Robot were good.  What was not so great: - The Rio Grande -- omg.. run for the hills.  They make a WAGYU picanha taste like rubbery meat.  The picanha was cooked what I would consider.. rare.  Which is fine, it is wagyu, right?  It is picanha, right?  Probably my favorite cut of all time from a brazilian restaurant.  This was the chewiest.. piece of meat.  We tried to bite our cut piece in half.. it was impossible.  We literally had to stuff the entire piece of meat into our mouth and chew and chew and chew.. and maybe five minutes later get to swallow it down.  The ribeye, although cooked similarly (maybe a medium rare at MOST) was not all that great either, it tasted like a regular ribeye, not even a great tasting ribeye and the chorizo is chorizo--some people in our group did not even bother finishing it.  Avoid this platter!!  It is NOT worth it, it is like they pretend to use fancy meat but you'd get a better outcome of chuck roast on a frying pan.  - The Moqueca Mista was good, the only thing is that the coconut milk flavor kind of overtakes everything--I didn't taste anything else, except coconut milk.. not even the seafood mixed into it--I only felt a taste of texture, nothing else flavor wise.  And the coconut milk is so fatty and thick it sort of just becomes a thick gravy as it cools--make sure you eat this fast while it is hot!! - Miso-marinated Chilean Sea Bass - I love chilean sea bass.. it is a mild, firm, moist flakey fish.. how they cooked this, I have no idea--I am guessing an oil poach?  It was so soft and moist it tasted like it was a soft boiled egg (whites).  This might be liked by some people.. but it was very hard to swallow.  Since I ordered it, I ended up finishing it.. this fish is already perfectly cooked even in a light steam, why try to drum it up and make it moister or softer.. it doesn't need it.. this was just overkill and hard to finish.. and this is coming from someone that loves fish.  Overall, it was a good visit, nice to try something new.  There are some items on the menu that we loved (gyoza and tataki) that I'd definitely come back for.. and definitely ones I will avoid like the plague (no Rio Grande!!).",

However, when I actually got there, they didn't really implement that so we didn't end up spending that much. We got the japanese wagyu A5 ishiyaki (super bomb), japanese a5 wagyu beef gyoza, salt and pepper squid, crispy whole red snapper. The cocktails were really good as well. The waiter was very friendly and explained the menu really well to us. The vibe very lively and they play good music, but if you don't like loud places, then this is definitely not for you. They had samba dancers dancing around the restaurant when I went here, but I'm not sure if it was a new year thing or a regular thing.  Overall, I really like this place. The price matches the portion and quality of the dishes. Even though they're on the pricier side, I don't think we are overpaying, because the quality is really good.",

I don't think 4 appetizers and 2 rolls is worth $250. I could have went to Lawyers for less and got full and good food. It was to loud and tables to close. The waiters butt was on the guys next to us shoulder. He made a commitment, is this the side show. I was happy to see Vanilla Ice looking at me.",

    "text": "Brazilian, Peruvian, and Japanese? Interesting combination, but it was great to try all these different flavors in one meal! SUSHISAMBA is located in the Venetian and is a very trendy looking slightly upscale restaurant. It's on the more casual side so you don't have to dress up. One of my favorites to go to when visiting LV. Walking in, you kinda feel like you're eating in a cave since everything is so dark and it's somewhat shaped in a half dome.   The service is very attentive...a little too attentive even. Our waitress was great and would recommend certain dishes for us. When each dish came out, the ingredients and how to eat it were explained to us, which is a nice touch. Waters were constantly filled every 3 minutes or so which was a bit extra but I appreciate the attention. They were also very fast at taking away our plates.   Tuna tataki ($17): This is one of my favorite dishes here. They're delicate little bites of ahi tuna combined with asparagus, fresh heart of palm, avocado, and a little garlic chip on top. The citrus soy sauce was really delicious combined with the other fresh ingredients.  Seared wagyu beef ($17): I opted to get this appetizer instead of the wagyu cooked on the hot stone and I'm glad I did! The wagyu beef is very thin and chewy. I was told to put a little but of the ponzu gelee and mushrooms on the wagyu slices, then roll up the beef to eat in a bite. AMAZING! So many different flavors going on. The ponzu gelee is quite strong, but really tasty and worked well with the crema and the mushrooms. Recommend!  El topo roll ($15): This was a miss for me. I wasn't really sure what I was eating. It's supposed to be a roll with salmon, and mozzarella, but honestly, it seemed like it was just rice with crispy onions on top. There was a TON of rice, and it's shaped in blocks and kinda mushy. I looked closer at the roll and couldn't really see any salmon either. If I didn't know there was mozzarella, I wouldn't know.  Toro ($17/piece): we were told that there was toro so of course we had to order some! I was really excited because I had toro only one other time and it was so melty and fatty. The toro here came with tiny gold flakes on top, which was interesting. It didn't really affect the taste. I was disappointed by the toro though. It was definitely more fatty than normal tuna, but it didn't melt in my mouth at all. There was honestly nothing special about it so it was very underwhelming, especially for $17 (!!!).   Unagi ($5.5/piece), Madai ($7/piece), yellowtail ($6/piece): These pieces were really fresh and delicious. The yellowtail was my favorite because it was so light and fresh!   Moqueca Mista ($33): Ahhh so satisfying! I love getting this when I come here because it's so full of seafood and is creamy and delicious! It's similar to a curry, but without so many spices and it's not spicy. You can definitely taste the seafood in the coconut milk liquid. There is a fair amount of seafood, including sea bass, clams, mussels and shrimp. There is green chimichurri rice in the middle and it's SO GOOD! Super filling and I couldn't get enough!  Sata andagi ($12): We ended our meal with this dessert. It's Peruvian chocolate filled Japanese donuts with raspberry coulis and a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top of some graham crackers. It was really good but I didn't think it was anything too special. Basically cinnamon sugar round donuts stuffed with melty chocolate. It was really delicious with the coulis and the ice cream which balanced out the chocolate in the donut.   Really random, but check out their bathroom! The stalls are these interesting circles and they have someone hand you a paper towel after you wash your hands. Super fancy!",

They have a bar you can sit at in addition to a full dining room. The sashimi is my absolute favorite. The yellowtail sashimi is to die for and we order it every single time. The Neo Tokyo roll is also fantastic. We haven't had anything bad on the menu! The cocktails are delicious (a little on the sweet side) and they have a huge list of sake to choose from. The servers are very knowledgeable on the menu and will provide tons of recommendations. The service has always been great. Another nice thing is that they have samba hour which is like a happy hour where you can get discounted food and drinks. All in all, this is a great option in Vegas for sushi, sashimi and anything Asian Fusion!",

We had a reservation, but we got there a bit early and they were able to seat us right away.   Our waiter recommended we order an assortment of plates and share them all, so we decided to do that. Wee pretty much took the recommendations of our waiter on what to order and it worked out very well.   On the small plates section, we got the yellowtail crispy taquitos and the mushroom tobanyaki. Both were amazing. I might had liked the taquitos slightly more, but it's hard to say.   On the sushi section, we got the El Topo Roll and the Asevichado Roll. Honestly, the sushi was not the highlight of this restaurant. The El Topo Roll was not good at all. The Asevichado Roll was pretty good, but I've had much better sushi and the rest of the food we got was much better.   In the robata section, we got duck breast, pork belly, and sea bass. They were all delicious, but the sea bass was the star of the show with the pork belly being a close second.   I will say that this place is quite pricy, but definitely very good if you're willing to pay for it.   If you're looking for a nice fancy meal while in Vegas, I would definitely check this place out!",

We had the Yellowtail Crispy Taquitos, Crispy Hokkaido Scallops, and the Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza for appetizers. They were so amazing! SO TASTY and FULL of flavor. For the main courses, my family shared the Tonkotsu Ramen, Samba Sashimi, and the Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass, the Ishiyaki Japanese Wagyu. I cannot describe how tasty everything was. The fish melted in your mouth and the meat was so tender. I absolutely loved this place!",

I went to the Sushi Samba in London a few weeks ago and was very satisfied, so I decided to try this location again, when I came back for a quick weekend get away. I am so glad I did because I was very happy with most of their dishes. My boyfriend and I came here for lunch and ordered:  Yellowtail Taquitos  Jumbo Shrimp Ceviche Green Bean Tempura Grilled Octopus Coconut & Mango Pudding (Dessert Special during World Cup Weekend)   The Yellowtail Taquitos is a must have! This is probably my favorite thing on the menu. Such a unique concept with tons of bold flavors. I could probably eat five of these! The Shrimp Ceviche also had a very unique taste. The mangos made it kind of sweet, but it also had the right amount of acidity. The shrimp and mangoes complimented each other. The Grilled Octopus and Green Bean Tempura were OK. The Octopus was missing some flavor and salt. There was something off with the Truffle Sauce that came with the Green Bean Tempura. I like the one in London better. The batter wasn't crunchy and it kept coming off the green beans. I was really impressed with the Coconut & Mango Pudding. It was beautifully presented, and very light and refreshing. It also wasn't too sweet and the texture of the pudding reminded me of a Flan.  Our server was amazing. She was sweet and took good care of us. It is a little dark and dim inside. I'm not a fan of the set up and decorations, but I will definitely come back for their dishes and excellent service! So glad I came back and gave it another try! They definitely know how to combine Japanese, Brazilian, and Peruvian dishes!",

We told our waiter how much we wanted to spend, and he picked a selection of menu items that lead to the ball park range.  On one side we felt we were at the will of our waiter, but the thing that you gotta understand is when you go out to eat, your waiter is in charge of your meal, so they're gonna make sure everything they choose is exactly to your satisfaction.  I couldn't tell you the names of what he brought for us, but everything was great. When I ordered a drink that I didn't enjoy, my waiter noticed, asked me how the drink was, and when he heard I wasn't satisfied he promptly offered me a replacement.  So great service. Great food.  Don't be afraid to approach your waiter if something isn't just great.",

Haha I loved the vibrant decorations, dimmed lighting and the extremely helpful staff but the food was comparable to any other Peruvian/Japanese restaurant.   We tried to make reservations since they're known to get packed, but thankfully they had room at the bar.  I love how our server walked us through the menu and shared some of her personal favorites.  Our party ordered the Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza, Yellowtail Ceviche, Kanpachi Sashimi, Miso-Marinated Sea Bass and Japanese Wagyu Sushi ($12 per piece).  Everything wagyu was soooo tasty and tender.  The ceviche and sashimi was drenched in their seasonings but it was still pretty good!  My least favorite dish was the sea bass, moreso because it tasted like any other sea bass dish.   This place is pretty good, although you'll probably be spending the same amount that you would at a buffet.  I'd recommend coming with a group to try a little bit of everything on their extensive menu!",

She went over all menu items and gave her recommendations.   We had yellowtail tacos, the sea bass skewers, few rolls and the tuna tataki. Each dish came out perfect and tasted great. They were very attentive with drinks and made sure plates were taken when we were done.   Overall a very pleasant experience. Will come again.",

The rolls were presented worse than some AYCE plating.. The rolls were barely put together and fell apart once we grabbed a piece. It wasn't even busy so I don't quite understand the poor presentation and the effort given...  The service was twice as more frustrating. Our server, Christine, was very polite in the beginning but disappeared once our dishes started to arrive. She checked up us on once and very briefly but only when we were close to finishing up. We were not able to order another drink because she wasn't quite around the hall. So we had to ask for napkins or a refill from bussers/runners. Then once we were finished, the busser comes and cleans up our table. That is perfectly acceptable because he obviously needs to pre-bus. However, he takes out a rag from his apron and wipes down our table while we are sitting down and finishing up our beer.. now our table is wet and then he puts his rag back in his apron...?? Completely unsanitary and inefficient way of bussing in front of a guest. Can't believe this is so called fine dining... I most likely won't return and would probably prefer to pay the same amount I spent here at an omakase off the strip.",

The complaint that I have is when we checked in, the hostess said \"I can seat you now but I will need the table back in 90 minutes \" I have never eaten anywhere where they gave a time limit on your dinner. Granted 90 minutes is a sufficient time but to be told that was unprofessional. So they would've kick us out when the timer went off? Just not the SUSHISAMBA we are used to.",

On average, people would do $50 - $60 each.   One by one, we had several dishes come out. All of us enjoyed every dish and the notable ones are wagyu beef gyoza (so flavorful!), seared wagyu beef (perfect for large groups),  crispy yellowtail taquitos (fresh and full of flavor!), and the grilled fish/chicken kabobs (not dry at all).  Service was fantastic, they were very attentive and giving us new plates, cleaning up our table, and providing new silverware when necessary.

Hands-down one of the best sushi south American fusion restaurants. The only thing I didn't like about the place was getting seated in the back. If you make reservations ask to be seated in the main area and not the back which is like a overflow type area. The environment and vibe is not as exciting back there. The drinks are tasty the food is amazing. I went there with my teenage daughters and they also enjoyed it very much. Walking through the Canal shoppes is a nice plus.",

I wasn't too hungry when our party of 6 came for an early dinner so I just went with the seared wagyu beef and tried everyone else's rolls. Most of them went with the El Topo and we ordered a special roll recommended by the waiter but unfortunately, there was nothing special enough about it for me to actually remember the name. Everything was mediocre and not worth their price tags. With the amount that we paid, we might as well ball out for a steakhouse instead. At least then I'll know we'd all leave with a full tummy.",

U wld be surprised how many trendy restaurants in Las Vegas stop serving off the menu before 12am. Getting seated was a breeze no waiting and the host was very friendly and asked if we had a preference where we liked to sit. I love that! It definitely sets the tone and I instantly want to come bck. It's very dim lighting but the architecture was gorgeous inside. Music wasn't to loud which makes everyone start yelling just to hear each other. We get acknowledged fairly quickly for drinks and water. But just looking at the menu I love the different cultures. If u can't decide they have so many choices! We started with ur basic miso but the edamame was so tasty spicy flavorful wagyu beef tacos so bomb! Had 3! Server helped with recommendations the roll steaks and dessert but I was already eyeing it from afar! Will be back!!",

Though the circular table was a bit in a weird location, right in the corner by the stairs, lots of cross traffic, it didn't distract as much as I thought it would.  Nick, our waiter, didn't rush us, but when we later told him we had show tickets, he made sure we got outta there on time.  We started with edemame and shishito peppers. These were good peppers but not my fav. We ordered a few different things and shared the dishes. Shrimp & veggie tempure- great spicy dipping sauce. Miso sea bass (large plate) it was the best thing we had there. El Topo roll- I was worried how the cheese would be, but the roll was really good. The Sasa handroll left much to be desired IMO. Agedashi tofu had lots of flavor in the sauce that is used. Other dishes were ordered which I didn't try, but everyone liked the food. One eh thing was that the table would get full and we would have to flag down a waiter to take away the empty plates, as oppose to them coming by often to check.  There was an extensive sake list, but we opted for a bottle of wine. Nick made sure our glasses stayed full. If you are looking for some non-traditional sushi, this is your place.",

This place does wonders for the partygoers in Vegas: a very lively ambiance, great for big groups and the food is kick ass too.   And sometimes, you get luckier with an awesome server like Max. He deserves a raise (and the 25% tip we gave him!) From start to finish, we were completely taken cared of.  At first, we couldn't decide if we want to order sushi, ramen, sashimi, ceviche, churrasco, how many appetizers, are we gonna order sake?! Or just cocktails? Maybe both? (why is this even a question?!)   He suggested the omakase menu, asked what price point we were comfortable with ($50/person, not including alcohol) and what we want to have: definitely foie gras, definitely meat and some sushi.   He went to town! OMG. All these years I've come to Vegas, this is one of the few times when we put our total trust on our server and we were so happy we did!   We sipped on pisco sours, Hendrick's cucumber martini and ordered a bottle of sake. Soon after our food came and the kitchen paced our dishes well.   The Appetizers: steamed organic edamame, green bean tempura with truffle aioli and grilled shishito peppers.   From the small plates menu: the freshest tuna tataki topped with white asparagus and avocado,  crispy-chewy salt and pepper squid and pork gyoza with kabocha pumpkin puree and su-shoyu dipping sauce.   The miso marinated chilean sea bass was the softest fish ever! simply served with roasted asparagus, it was incredible to have seafood this fresh in Vegas.  Undeniably, the star of the show was the Rio Grande plate which came with grilled hangar steak, ribeye and pork tenderloin. It's a good thing there weren't any vegeatarians in our group, we dove into that plate with so much gusto! the malaguito pepper oil and chimichurri sauce paired perfectly with our succulent meats.  Then came more food! three different sushi rolls and a couple of nigiri sushi. California sucks for banning foie gras, so I'm glad that Max included the Yamato roll in our omakase menu:  tuna, foie gras, osetra caviar made prettier with gold leaf. Holy mother of [fill in the blank here]!!!!  JUST GET IT.  You'd think we'd end the fantastic meal right here, but no, our birthday girl wasn't forgotten: a complimentary chocolate mousse with malted balls inluding a sparkler for the celebrant! sister was all smiles, of course.  Thank you sushisamba! Ask for Max if you want to turn your night from ordinary to a great one!",

We were greeted with a few small dishes at a time that each topped the previous dishes we had! One of my faves was the sea bass- it was exquisite. We had a few different desserts, all of which were incredible and the presentation was impressive. The ambiance was perfect for the evening being lively, colorful, chic and sexy.

It is located in a very good area of the shops closer to Palazzo than Venetian and the architecture of the restaurant is very cool. We ordered a lot because we had not eaten yet: we ordered the yellowtail scallion rolls, which have a little bit of rice with a lot of yellowtail with scallions and literally melt in your mouth. We ordered the Chilean sea bass which was incredible and the Peruvian corn side dish and seaweed salad appetizer. The vegetable tempura was also outstanding. We received two complimentary samples of a scallop on a shell with a fabulous array of ingredients to top it that was delicious. The house ice tea is one of the best ice teas that I have ever had. We share a form of banana split with really cool features. The ice cream and whisky whipped cream were a total wow, surrounded by fresh berries  Will not hesitate to go back today! It is that good. Highly recommended whether you like sushi or not: plenty of variety, and all selections are at the top of their game!",

Everything was fabulous from appetizers, drinks and entrees! Pluses: Sushi rolls and sashimi, bottles of Prosecco for $41, the 18 oz bone in rib eye and the chicken teriyaki. Our waitstaff was super attentive, funny and on top of our every need! Minuses: The bathrooms were super tiny and dark, the noise level was loud (but then again, so were we) and at the end of the meal, something caught on fire in the kitchen and the smell was outrageously bad.",

    "text": "We had our joint birthday dinner here with some friends in Vegas and we all thoroughly enjoyed our visit. SUSHISAMBA offers a cool blend of Japanese, Brazilian and Peruvian cuisine. The sushi rolls/pieces were good, but I have to say, the cooked dishes were what really stole the show. The pork belly, miso glazed sea bass, wagyu beef gyoza, rock shrimp tempura, duck breast, Peruvian corn, etc., were fantastic. Our server was great about offering solid recommendations and he ensured that the portions were large enough for each of us to have a taste (we ordered a lot of tapas-style small plates and some large plates).  At the end of our meal, our server brought the birthday boy and me a cake lollipop on a \"Happy Birthday\" decorated plate, which was a nice surprise and quite delish. He's not big on chocolate but he ate it anyway. Bummer for me because I could have easily eaten his also. We left feeling satisfied and we really enjoyed our selections.   This is a great place to kick back and enjoy a nice dinner with a date or with some friends. We will revisit when we return to Sin City!",

It was a little hectic at first getting everyone situated then explaining they would be offering us a tasting menu that would run about $50/pp. Eventually the group agreed and settled in for a delicious meal.  They started us off with an appetizer trio of Edaname, green bean tempura, and Shishito (grilled peppers). Very well done. Next came out some small plate items of Tuna tataki, rock shrimp tempura (yummy), calimari, and poke tacos which were delicious. Next came chicken teriyaki, ribeye tobanyaki, and a mushroom tobanyaki. The flavors in those 3 items were so good. Very impressive.   Last was some sushi rolls, a spicy tuna, tempura shrimp, and a whitefish of some sort. These were not impressive and thus the reason for the -1 star. I was expecting some out of this world sushi and it didn't happen.   Overall, a good night with some good friends and a bunch of laughs, drama, and drunken tomfoolery. I will return here sometime, although there are so many places in the Venetian/Palazzio that I haven't tried so will do those first.",

In Lost Wages, everything is bigger and splashier so it is no surprise that this SS has a huge bar and restaurant with really good food.  We went last Saturday night and met the front desk staff Jason and Jeremy who took very good carte of us and even sent over a scallop wrapped in some sort of dough deal that was fantastic. We also had a crunchy roll and a yellowtail with jalapeno that rocked.   Wine list was good, not great. Drinks might be a better way to go in the booze department.   Staff was friendly and quick. maybe a touch too quick, but all was good in the end.   Its a beautiful space in the Palazzo/Venetian shopping center so lots of other cool stuff to help you spend your money if there is a wait. Or, you can always go downstairs and gamble (I hear they have that in vegas now!)  I'd go back next time. Solid pace as Frank might say.",

From the SMALL PLATES Menu we ordered 4 Crispy Taquitos (Yellowtail) to start. Soooo delicious. I thought the shell looked generic but one bite, and my taste buds were exploding. So many yummy flavors packed into one small dish!  A coworker suggested we ordered the Seaweed Salad. The middle variety was the type I am familiar with but I was delighted to discover that the complimenting two were flavorful as well.  From the SAMBA ROLLS Menu we all shared the Samba Strip, Sao Paolo, and the California Snow Crab (Cucumber wrapped). All were delicious and I would highly recommend them.  Although I was partial to the Sao Paolo.  From the ROBATA Menu we ordered the Sea Bass. Perfectly cooked and seasoned, tender and the homeny style corn was a great balance of sweet and savory.  When we tried to order the Filet Mignon from the ROBATA menu and the Mushroom Tobanyaki from the SMALL PLATES menu the server suggested we combine these two dishes. This was an excellent suggestion. The Steak was perfectly cooked, the sauce from the mushrooms deliciously complimented the beef, and the poached egg was the icing on the cake!",

I know it's Vegas, but this was the only restaurant that I felt was overpriced. While the decor/vibe is cool, it's just like any other upscale Asian fusion restaurant these days. Both of our dishes were average, and my duck had too much of a saturated lime taste.  The waygu gyoza, however, lived up to its reputation and was so lively in flavor. I should have just ordered three sets of these and I would have been happy with my meal.  On a side note, this restaurant was so hard to find! Oh my gaaaaawwww... I've been to Venetian and Palazzo hundreds of times and didn't have a clue where this was tucked away at. We had to stop and ask for directions a few times, and half of those people who were EMPLOYEES had no idea how to get here.",

    "text": "In early May I was in Las Vegas on business and wanted to entertain some colleagues for dinner. We were a party of eleven and with that many pallets to please, we needed something different, we needed SUSHISAMBA.   A couple people in the group had been here before and spoke highly of the fusion restaurant, but for many of us this would be our first time so we made a reservation for 7pm. Typically when we travel for business there is always one or two people who join your group at the last minute, so we held a table for thirteen just in case.   Most of us arrived to the restaurant on time however two people were running a few minutes late but on their way. Unfortunately because we were not a party of ten, the server refused to seat us, even though it would only be a few minutes for them to arrive. She also said they could only hold our reservation for 10 minutes.  Needless to say, they arrived in time, but I thought that it was not only a poor business decision to seat us early (most people will enjoy a cocktail or two while waiting) but just rude.   We were seated in the far back of the restaurant and the servers were very attentive. They quickly explained the Brazilian-Peruvian-Japanese fusion concept of the restaurant and then without missing a beat he began to pitch us on the \"Chef's Choice\" option to the menu. I will admit, it was a good pitch, but obviously too good to be True. With this option the chef would listen to our likes and dislikes and create dishes that appeal to our tastes based on our budget, much like when dining at a Chef's Table.  The catch to this.... The restaurant was packed, there is no way the kitchen is creating anything special for us.... They're just serving menu items that will maximize your budget and increase your check.   Sadly five of us fell for it and ordered the \"Chef's Choice\" menu, the rest of us ordered ala carte and decided we would share plates amongst each other and asked for separate checks.  Funny enough most of the plates that were being served off the \"Chef's Choice\" menu were the same plates we ordered, but with a few exceptions.  The food was good.  It by no means blew me away, but nothing I ate was bad and I really cant find anything negative to say about it. We had a number of small dishes that included edamame, seaweed salad, rock shrimp and wagyu gyoza, plus an assortment of sushi rolls.   The checks came and as expected the \"Chef's Choice\" total was nearly $100 more than the ala carte (and we had an extra person).  I signed the bill, put the receipt in my wallet and didn't look at it again until I got back to the office and had to submit my expenses.   As I reviewed the bill I took notice to the quantities of the plates ordered. We specifically ordered different items knowing that we were sharing, so I was surprised to see that I had duplicates on five items. I know we all liked the rock shrimp and ordered another plate, so that wasn't a concern. However there was only one other questionable roll that no one recalls ordering and the other three were definitely not ordered, delivered or consumed.... But we paid for it.   We aren't talking about a lot of money here - $36 - $55, but it's the fact we were obviously taken advantage of.  Maybe the waiter wanted a bigger tip, perhaps the restaurant wanted to recoup some funds because we didn't take the \"Chef's Choice\"? Either way I wrote the management group letting them know of my disappointment.  In the end I got an email from the general manager offering to return my $36 with an apology.   As a chef, when I am dining out I expect my experience to meet an acceptable level of expectations that may differ from others, however lets face it, with so many choices available these days a restaurant has to be spot on to keep you coming back.  Apparently in this case SUSHISAMBA needs the money more than I do as I will not be going back.",

The little won ton style tacos were excellent as we chose yellowtail over the beef. The Peruvian corn and thin slices of waygu beef and mushrooms with sauce were superb. We wanted to find one dish that really knocked us out last trip and the manager and our waiter took the time to help us out when we weren't quite sure what it was called. They even replaced a dish we ordered mistaking for our favorite. We shared the sake flight and loved it especially the Fukucho Forgotten Fortune which our waiter explained the special rice it was named for. Will be back our next trip for another culinary journey.",

We chose to sit at the sushi bar and since we did not read reviews we were clueless of the offerings.  We thought we were just going to get some sushi.    The waitress handed us menus and walked away for like 20 minutes.  Hello? We're thirsty!  Take our drink order!  We sat there puzzled looking at the menu and wondering why she wouldn't say, \"Welcome, thank you for coming in, is this your first time with us?  Let me tell you a bit about the menu?  \"It's a mixture of sushi and some South American country\"...or whatever!    The menu had rolls with weird combinations.  I really wish she would have spent some time getting us excited about what to order or make some recommendations.   So we didn't see the space cadet waitress in like forever-so waisted an hour and a half in this place.  Needless to say we had a couple of crappy rolls and some drinks all forgettable but I haven't been back and I'm really disappointed since my yelp friends rated it so high. Maybe this was an off day?    I will have to say props to the marketing manager who got back to me and apologized for my experience. so I did add another star for effort.  I really do appreciate when an establishment makes an effort to get things right.  The location is somewhere lost in the Palazzo on a top floor. Not the best location.",

Although the sushi was well presented, they didn't taste like anything spectacular.  Surprisingly not too many rolls to choose from even though they try to create some original specialty rolls.    Neo Tokyo Roll - Spicy tuna inside, tuna outside.  This roll was just ok.  It just tastes like spicy tuna.  Sea Bass Skewers - Probably our only favorite dish.  Comes with corn.  El Topo Roll - Good, sorta like a crunchy roll, crispy onions and mayo on top.  Pork belly ramen - Highly recommended by server, but a huge disappointment.  It was a failed attempt.  The broth was clear and bland.  It tasted like instant ramen with a hint of tom yum soup flavoring.  Nothing like ramen at all.    Sushisamba has good food, it just didn't show me anything new or exciting except that you're in a really nice restaurant, but you're paying for it.",

    "text": "One of my all-time favorites in Las Vegas!  SUSHISAMBA is a must every time we pay a visit to Sin City whether it's for lunch, dinner or a midnight snack.  Easily accessible through the Grand Canal Shoppes entrance closest to the Wynn.  I do agree with some of the other reviewers in that this place can be pricey... but you're in Las Vegas... what did you expect, $13 sushi buffet?  No thanks.  My favorites here: -Purple Potato Mash:  so delicious and buttery-good.  great side to even share with others at the table -Green Bean Tempura:  comes with a really tasty aioli that trumps all other tempura associated sauces -El Topo:  my favorite of the sushi rolls hands down.  So unique with crispy onion and mozzarella and incredibly melt-in-your-mouth good salmon.  Drinks are always good here. Personal favorite is the Nina Fresa - a light, refreshing and tasty strawberry martini.  Can't go wrong with any of the cocktails though.  Do yourself a favor - come, eat and enjoy.",

It's a circular bar that is half inside and half outside the restaurant so it's great when you're waiting for your party to arrive.  We were seated inside and the ambiance is really lively. It was pretty dark inside but they were really busy for a Wednesday night ( but that could be because our entire company pretty much took over the hotel that week). Our waiter took out drink, We got the lemon samurai which was really good. I think it had vodka and some citrus notes in it, also a little strong but that's a good thing right? :)   Our waiter returned and gave us a thorough breakdown of all the options we had. Basically you can order what you want or you can have the chef whip up a meal for you based on your likes and dislikes. We decided to order a bunch of different dishes (they're tapas style btw).   We started with the Otsumami (edamame, tempura green beans, and grilled shishito peppers) which was really good. I liked the tempura green beans (could be cause it's fried lol). We also got the crispy taquitos, salmon ceviche, yellow sashimi tiradito, the ribeye tobanyaki, and the Sao Paolo roll. Most of this was recommended by our waiter and other recommendations we received.  Everything came out really quickly actually. And everything was DELICIOUS. The taquitos were super good the only thing about them was the shell was really flimsy and practically broke apart when you picked them up. The salmon ceviche was really good and had a nice kick from the jalapenos. We had some colleagues that said we HAD to get the yellow tail tiradito and it was really good! It actually tasted like a Dorito lol but I would definitely say to order one of the tiradito dishes. The only hot plate was the ribeye tobanyaki which the table next to us got so we decided to try it and the beef was super tender.   The service was really great, our waiter was very tentative and knowledgable. My colleague had to ask us what he said after he was done talking because she thought he was so cute lol.  All in all I would definitely come back. I had a great time from the food to the service and right down to the ambiance - my entire experience was memorable. I recommend coming here if you like Japanese food with a twist!",

This restaurant should be embarrassed to offer this type of seating. In fact, I think our hostess was embarrassed when I balked and questioned if we should stay??? I will never accept seating like that for a bill like that again. It could have been 5 star if I we weren't on a separate island.   I've heard back from management.

With that being said I will begin with Sushi Samba...Hostess was great, no reservation so she asked if we would like to sit at the bar until a table opens up which was fine by us..  We sat down at the bar and crickets....No one came over to greet us, wink something to at least acknowledge our presence..15 minutes later the bartender comes over and realizes we are sitting there, doesn't say they are sorry just, have you\"guys\" ordered yet? \"guys?\" I hate that..I am a woman!

    "text": "A pretty good sushi spot in Vegas. It is really pricy for the kind of rolls, but you can tell everything is very fresh and has a lot of flavor. We got a Yellow-Tail Roll, A custom Crab and Lobster Roll, the SushiSamba roll, and a spicy tuna roll, also a plate of Chicken Teriyaki. The sushi for the most part was really good! The Chicken Teriyaki was decent, but nothing all that amazing considering it cost $26 for that plate. The servers are very informative on the dishes and are super friendly. They offer good advice and are pretty quick to serve. If you ask for the chef to make a custom roll with Crab and Lobster, the creations are usually really good! Highly suggest doing that!   TLDR: Good sushi spot, but a bit pricy.",

    "text": "*******Stay away from this place******  Confused staff and very Rude snobby manager sum up my experience.  It is not all about the Money, it is about how the team and a establishment makes you feel and overall dining experience,  I called ahead for happy hour / Samba Hour and they said it will be for that night. Upon arrival I told hostess we like to take advantage of  their Samba hour for drink special and get sushi off their regular menu  the hottest took us to the back room , which it was Empty and said the special drink menu is only served here!   Even thou the restaurant was half full ( mostly clueless tourists) We were the only ones in that back room the waitress came and said there is no special menu there in the back room that night and took us back to the front, to be seated in the main restaurant!!  So now we are in the front and the hottest claim that the So called Samba Hour is only at the bar and sit us there, only for the bartender minutes later to acknowledged that the Restaurant manager  Called off the Samba Hour all together for that night, and there was nothing special to begin with as they advertised and told us over the phone.  Does anyone knows what they are doing!? The team has lack of communication with the manager and each other!!  Why the waiters, bartender and hostess are not synched!?  It was our Anniversary the next day so we got the table and stayed. After all we were just gonna use the samba hour for some drink and get the food off the regular menu anyway.  The snobby hostess treat us like some hilly billy as if it was our fault getting moved around 3 times, and said the manager will come over to make it up.    $200 in bill later for some very average sushi, no sign of manager to at least apologize for moving us from room to room and seat to seat and literally being humiliated due to their confusion .  ******Never Again  I travel to vegas regularly and just wanted to give this place a chance.  For great sushi and service I would Go back to Nobu or Social House both on the strip, will never even consider this place ever again.   I have no problem spending more for great food and service, and I have travelled all over the world to appreciate quality service but this place was definitely the worst dinning experience of my life.  There are many other great dinning  options at Palazzo and Venation, sushi samba is not one of them.",

    "text": "One of the many reasons I love the Palazzo is the creepy-when-you-think-about-it facts that you can have a week long vacay and never really go outside. One of the other reasons I like the joint is... Sushisamba.   All fusion isn't created equal and most of what's deemed fusion in the multi-billion dollar tourist traps still doesn't cut it as top notch cuisine... but in three rotations over the years, the one thing I can say is that they've consistently delivered a good experience.  And that's more than I can say for a few others that are no longer at the Palazzo.   It's also consistently noisy... do with that what you will.   Favorites from the menu... Moqueca mista (kinda hard to mess up fish stew with good ingredients ) and the sea bass are my favorites of the full entries, which I wouldn't recommend on a first visit.  Save big plates for your second or third go round.  Almost anything with the wagyu is a hit; I think sushisamba drives the South American flavors home using fine Japanese beef.  But if it works...   The Yamato roll... Epic as it is... to me, is **almost** overkill.  Super indulgent foie gras and wagyu are almost a taste bud assault.   But at the same time, you have to try it-share it. The Sao Paulo and the Neo Tokyo are my favorites here.   The Samba Strip is also pretty awesome.  Again, pile enough good things together and see what happens.   The so so and not so on the menu... If anything ... Rock shrimp (discontinued) and Tiger shrimp tempura.   Mojitos are so so...( to me) as well.   The robata squid was literally hit and miss; had it once and it was great... and the next time... just rubber.   All in all, come here with good company, a serious appetite and charge it to the room...i prefer early lunch or just after midnight.",

    "text": "Well I have eaten at all 3 Sushi Sambas (New York , Miami and now Vegas) unless I'm missing one.  The Vegas version continues my string of 5 star ratings and it's all about the food.   Food is what my ratings are all about, but good (or bad) atmosphere can certainly sway a star out of me as well. We went for the Omakase, which simply means the chef picks your entire menu.  I highly recommend it at any Japanese restaurant that offers, accepting that you're going to have a bit of a higher tab. That said you will also get the best of the best on the menu, without even thinking and that is exactly what we got.    In our case I think our waiter did most of the menu selections but he absolutely nailed it on every front. The 4 guys that were with me for dinner had never been to a Sushi Samba and they've been raving about it since we left.  Seabass, Ceviche, Lamb Chops, and classic sushi rolls. Everything was AAA quality.  Atmosphere-wise I found this Sushi Samba the weakest of the 3, with Miami being my absolute favorite. It may be because this one is in a hotel, almost feeling like it's in a Mall.   Regardless, if you like Japanese fusion don't miss out on Sushi Samba.  Again go for the Omakase (pronounced Oh-Ma-Cas-See).",

Also, our waitress could not have been more rude or off-putting right from the start. She was simply cold and not friendly during the entire meal.

I tried a couple of diff sushi and although I don't think it's authentic sushi (marinated so no need to dip in soy sauce) I'll rate it like an Americanized sushi joint (soy sauce and wasabi)... I sound like a sushi snob, which I am. lol I just love fresh authentic sushi!  - kanpachi - yuzu, sea salt, black truffle oil.  I liked it.  it was kind of sour though - sashimi platter - all the sushi was good.  need soy sauce to dip - seaweed salad - it has 3 diff types of seaweed.  I only liked the normal green one.  the other 2 were weird - yellowtail ceviche - did not like it.  it tasted fruity",

    "text": "I'm always a little skeptical of Asian fusion cuisine, but this place does it right! Our waitress was very helpful in guiding us through the menu, pointing out the more popular items. It is a \"tapas\" style menu, the plates are small and meant to be shared! We ordered:   -Wagyu beef gyoza: I think this was the best thing we ordered! The beef was soooo good and I loved the sauces on the side.   -Pork belly ramen: Everything in the ramen was very traditional, but the broth was very different from your typical bowl. It had a hint of lemongrass and some heat, which my boyfriend and I really liked (it kind of reminded us of tom yum soup).   -Sea bass and shrimp skewers: Both came with a side of Peruvian corn! So yummy! These are supposedly the two most popular of the anticuchos.   -Lima roll: A pretty standard shrimp tempura roll. I would have rather tried another one of their small plates or tempura instead.   Between two people this was more than enough food. Overall, a really great and satisfying meal with unique flavors!",

I enjoyed a great Mojito, LOVED their HH rolls, and can't even put into words how unique and tasty both the corn and shishito peppers are. The purple potato mash is good, if you can get passed the heavy cream flavor (tell yourself you're eating your veggies...)  Service was ok, despite one grumpy bartender, who still gave us quick and efficient service.   Can't wait to go back.   (Bill for two= $110, but we ate a lot. and by a lot I mean A LOT).   Skip the El topo roll. Cheese on rice is just wrong.",

    "text": "My friend recommended this place to me.  She started off by saying it was a Peruvian-Japanese fusion cuisine, and I had to stop her there because I didn't need any more convincing!  As the foodie in my family, I did all the ordering.  I got the edamame, rock shrimp tempura, yellowtail ceviche, seaweed salad, chicken antichuchos with Peruvian corn, Neo Tokyo roll, Veggie Kun roll, and Yasai quinoa temaki roll.  All of this was enough to feed five people.   The portion for the rock shrimp tempura was huge!  It came with this spicy sauce that really gave it all of its flavor.  The ceviche had balanced flavors between the tangy and sweet.  I thought the chicken was okay, but the corn it came with was yummy!  I was also amazed by the seaweed salad, in that it was an assortment of different seaweed.  The sushi rolls were also delicious.  And I really liked the fact that the temaki rolls were made from quinoa.  My sister, being vegetarian, was happy with the food she got.  I also got their house ice tea which tasted like a virgin mojito.  And as for dessert, I got the coco duo and the samba split for two.  The coco duo is good for two people (it was hard sharing it with 5..).  I loved the praline and the bit of gold flakes.  I really loved the samba split for two, which was actually good for my entire party.  It was an assortment of caramel popcorn, yamazaki cream, caramelized bananas, assorted berries, dulce de leche ice cream and flan..  One word: wow!  If you're going to order dessert, the samba split will not disappoint!   We were going to get the fondue, but the waitress told us that it was the least popular and said we should order something else.  If anyone did order the fondue, please let me know what you thought of it!  Hopefully they'll open a restaurant in San Francisco soon!",

A lot of people I know recommend this place as well.. I wasn't impressed. The place is nice, vibe is very Vegas like. I've never been to fond of Asian fusion, just keep is one or the other.   My friend ordered a bunch of different side dishes, raw fish etc. I wasn't about it, but they looked pretty good. I ordered the 12 oz steak. I was super excited to actually have a steak, but what came out wasn't what I expected. The steak was super tender, and it came in a bed of onions, mushrooms etc. It was medium rare, tender and it literally melts in your mouth. However, it came with a very sweet teriyaki like sauce. The sauce does get overwhelming after a while. My girlfriend had the kabobs, she had the fish, steak, and shrimp. They were okay. Nothing here blew me away..  If you're planning on drinking, be prepared to pay Vegas prices for a drink. I had a Moscow mule, and it was $16. I barely taste the alcohol. I guess that's expected in Vegas.  Service was good, our waitress was very helpful. She checked up on us here and there, so no complaints there.   Probably won't come back?",

It was an impromptu visit as we were looking for someplace with Sushi at the hotel we were visiting and this place got really good ratings so why not? Well, they lived up to any expectations we could have and then some.   We were seated and greeted pretty quickly. Our server was amazing!! He was thoughtful on his menu choices listening very intently to our questions and comments and adjusting accordingly. He checked on us in a timely fashion but didn't hover at all and they entire team made sure that empty plates were taken away quickly and that water was always filled.  The food was fantastic and I didn't have a thing I didn't enjoy.  Icing on the cake? At some point we must've mentioned we were in town because of my wife's birthday because at the end of the night they brought out a nice birthday treat.  It was a pleasant surprise and much appreciated.  This is a must stop place if you like sushi.... and if you have people who don't they have a huge menu of other items to choose from including steak.",

The seared wagyu beef is an ideal appetizer for two - the meat was so tender, and I felt like all the components of dish really complemented each other. Make sure you mix each piece of meat with the ponzu gelee and honshimeji mushrooms!  The chilean sea bass in its own right is amazing - hard to mess this up when the fish naturally has so much oil and fat to add to its flavor! The miso marinade was perfect. I think that perhaps the vegetables had too much char on them though  Service was great - took a long time to get our orders, but once they were in, food came out expeditiously :)",

I thought it was in for a LOT of complaining when I walked in with my parents to a darkened atmosphere and loud music, but the food was so tasty that it made up for my parent's initial discomfort.  **There is back room area with plenty of seating that looks much quieter, so if you're looking to enjoy a more peaceful evening, definitely request to be seated in the back room!   [NO RESERVATIONS NEEDED] We were seated immediately despite having no reservations and coming during one of the busiest weeks (with 5 trade shows going on).   [FOOD] THIS IS NOT A DRILL. YOU HAVE TO HAVE TO HAVE TO!! GET THE MISO SEA BASS (in the Robata section) WITH PERUVIAN CORN. It was, hands down, the best thing we ordered all night. The Sea Bass was lightly glazed with miso, and then literally LITERALLY perfectly cooked to provide just the right amount of tender smoothness. It is truly magical how they have perfected cooking fish on a stick in a fire - but they've done it, and my emphatic description of the Sea Bass will hopefully convince you to try it as well! The accompanying Peruvian Corn was a fun side snack, providing lots of (good) chewiness and consistency - putting regular ol' American corn to shame.   Seared Wagyu Beef was good and quite flavorful; if you like the taste of truffles, you'll be happy with the truffle cream that complements the dish!   Broiled Peruvian Bay Scallops were just alright in my opinion. LOTS of bold flavor, but I think the shiso buttery flavor of the dish overpowered the natural sweetness that scallops are blessed with. I normally loveeeee scallops to an insane degree, but these were not my favorite (mainly because I could barely taste the scallop-y ness of it).   Crispy Yellowtail Taquitos - tacos for the munching! You really can't go wrong when you put fresh yellowtail + fresh avocados into a crunchy home + add in some housemade hot sauce! Easily a safe and tasty dish!   Salmon Ceviche was GOOOD! Super fresh and a fun ponzu party in your mouth!   Kanpachi was a miss for it - it was OVERWHELMINGLY sour and had us wincing in its yuzu strength. PASS!   Sao Paulo roll was a nice addition to get carbs on the table. Everything tasted fresh - the only downside is that there are only 2 pieces of scallop, 2 pieces of shrimp, 2 pieces of salmon, 2 pieces of whitefish - so the description is a bit misleading. You don't get everything in each roll - all the delicious seafoody friends are distributed across the roll.   El Topo was a surprise hit! Being a somewhat sushi snob, I try not to mix CHEESE with my sushi, but it was actually really good - especially when the ooey gooey cheese was luxuriously melted onto the salmon. Alright fine - I guess this is one fusion dish I am totally fine getting behind!   [Overall] Service was great. Food was delicious and offered a lot of variety! And the atmosphere is a bit more of a party one!",

I ordered a sample of pinot that never arrived. There was a lot of \"auctioning off\" food since he didn't know who ordered what. The sushi was ok, nothing extravagant or new.  I wouldn't recommend eating here. There are plenty of other places to eat in Vegas with superb service.",

This is all glitter no gold place with below average American style food pretending to be Japanese/Brazilian fusion food. The server whose name I don't remember was in so much hurry that he cared little about recommendations or answer our queries about spice level as we were with 2 kids. Now service is as bad as it gets given these guys are selling no craft but just average assembly line quality food. Will never enter this place again. NOT RECOMMENDED. Guys, please get your act together and stop pretending as though you know Japan.",

    "text": "* Price: definitely not cheap... But what you expect... It's sushi, it's in LV, 5 star resort, swanky decor with fusion food... Yup, it just flashing high-end... Most dishes are between $15 to $40 but not outrageous. Drinks are about $16 and up...  4 star. * Atmosphere: trendy, casual. The decor is a mixed between Japanese and Brazilian/Peruvian... Goes with its name. 4+ star. * Location: 2nd floor of the Venetian Shopping above the casino. Directly from Palazzo resort elevator. It is very easy to find and get to. 4+ star. * Meals: delicious! Every dish is perfectly fresh and well balanced between savory and spicy! 5 star. * Service: excellent. Friendly, pleasant and attentive! 5 star.  This is averaged to 5 star!  I love sushi and found this place through yelp! I am so glad that we came here! We did make reservation for a Saturday dinner... But I saw many people just walked in. The place is packed for Saturday night... So I would definitely recommend to make reservation.  We always have hesitation about fusion sushi... Especially Peruvian/Brazilian Japanese... What in the world...! But we got converted...!  - from small plates, we got tuna tataki, $16: seared tuna, served with asparagus, heart of palm, avocado, tasoi, cripy garlic and citrus soy on top. It is a perfect bite, fresh, crunchy, sweet, sour and salty!    - from Raw section, we had yellow tail and tuna sashimi ceviche for $15 each. Yellow tail is served with ginger, garlic and soy. Tuna is served with grapefruit, jalapeno and almond. The fish is very fresh, sliced like sashimi style, melted in your mouth. I like the ginger sauce better because it is not too tangy or sour.... just perfect!  - from Robata (grilled on skewer), we ordered hamachi kama, ribeye, lamp chops and Asparagus. Hamachi ($13)  is perfectly grilled and seasonned with lime and sushoyu on the side. The fish is just melted in your mouth. Ribeye ($13(  is tender and served with aji panca (Peruvian pepper) and corns. The corns are so tasty and juicy! Lamp chops ($16 each)is perfectly grilled served with red miso and lime. It is tasty but quite expensive since each lamp chop is $16... And you definitely want more than one.  - from Samba rolls, we had Neotokyo ($16). It is their fun version of spicy tuna with the big eye sauce on top of the roll will make you smile.  - from soup section, we ordered Tomkatsu ramen ($20). It is huge portion definitely for sharing. Ramen noodles are served  with pork belly, salted eggs, bamboo, scallion, bean sprouts. The broth is savory!  - Desert: samba split ($16): doce de leite ice cream, with caramelized banana, coconut flan, dried pineapple, popcorn and whisky whipped cream... Can you say too much of good things!  - Drinks: lychee cooler ($16)... Very tasty vodka with coconut and lychee!   Our dinner bill was over $200 but we did order a lot of food... I literally could not breath after our dinner!  We definitely will come back!",

    "text": "One of the best meals I've ever had! Chef's tasting menu with 2 other colleagues, cost around $100 each. Individual dishes are pricey but I now would say worth it. Only downside is it's loud in the restaurant. We got there at 9 pm on a Thursday and it had died down with no wait and was ok.   Was in Vegas for work for 1 night with colleagues. A friend of a colleague suggested this restaurant. I like sushi but haven't tried much and wasn't sure what I would find on the menu. Our server, Nick, was great! He was very knowledgeable and excited about the menu. Nick explained the menu is a mix of food/tastes from Japan, Brazil, and Peru. So you'll find some things you know and recognize and a lot of new/unique things. Many things were catching my eye and when 2 of my colleagues wanted to try the tasting menu I jumped in. It was the menu that also included the Waygu beef, which does up the cost some to around $100 each with that size group. Each of us got things that we had been eyeing and no one left disappointed. It was worth every penny and the experience was fantastic!   Menu included the following courses:  1.Green Bean Tempura 2.Yellowtail Taquitos 3.Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza 4.Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass & Chicken Teriyaki- Samba Style (nothing special) served w/, Peruvian Corn 5.Wagyu Beef cooked at table w/ 700 degree hot stone and dipping sauces 6.Samba Rolls: Lima, Neo Tokyo (guessing), and Asevichado (best of the 3)It's a must try 7.Honey Toast  All of it was good. Hard to pick a favorite thing. I would come and have the tasting menu again! It's a must try!",

    "text": "ABSOLUTELY EXQUISITE. This place blew me away -- from the savory food, the personable service, the modern ambiance, just everything!   A big fan of asian fusion, this place was a True celebration of Japanese Brazilian Peruvian cuisine! More on the expensive side, but totally worth the amazing presentation and rich flavors -- every dish was explained to us upon arriving to our table, which made the anticipation even more intense! The assistant manager Jason was very knowledgeable about the menu and extremely charming, making our dining experience all the more enjoyable! :)  WE ORDERED:  - Shot tree (nina fresa, nashi, samba juice) - Wagyu gyoza (kabocha puree and su-shoyu dipping sauce) - Yellowtail taquitos (avocado and roasted corn miso, with spicy aji panca sauce) - Sea bass anticuchos w/ peruvian corn - Alaskan king crab raw bar - Jumbo shrimp raw bar - Chef's inspiration Sashimi 15 - Sawagani (flash fried japanese river crabs) - Tiradito 4 (tuna with granny smith apple, lime & serrano; Yellow tail with lemongrass and red fresno chili; Kanpachi with Yusuf truffle; Salmon with garlic ponzu and Japanese honey)  - Minter sweet oysters - Tuna tataki (asparagus, fresh heart of palm, avocado, tatsoi, crispy garlic citrus soy) - Otsumami (green bean tempura with black truffle aioli, edamame & shishito peppers)  Everything was simply beyond satisfactory. Whether it's a date night, a birthday celebration, a girls night out -- this place is the perfect pick (and officially one of my favorite restaurants in Las Vegas, hands down!). Thank you to everyone on the Sushi Samba team for an incredible dining experience from beginning to end! WE WILL DEFINITELY BE BACK! :)",

I believe it is one of the hotels but the parking structure is s mess. You don't have to pay for parking. But be prepared to be so confused. All I can say is go left when u park your cars.   Upon arrival- We ordered the 2 miso soups Which came with cilantro, I have never had it but the cilantro was way over powering and super super salty. I wouldn't order it again. But they tofu inside the soup was so fresh and buttery you can taste it that all of it was fresh and piping hot which I love.   The service was good . They had the food out pretty quick for the most part. And seated us immediately when we arrived but if would totally recommend make reservations for parties of 4 or more. That place was jam packed and for all the right reasons.   Next we ordered 3 rolls right off that bat. One crunch roll, a salmon jalapeno, and yellow tail with Avocado. All of them were really good. Pretty much inhaled them since we were on the road for 5 hours and would eat anything. (At that point) then for the finally. We ordered the best roll of my life.   The El TOPO roll. Not so much a roll but it was cooked salmon with like eel sauce spect mayo crunchy delish fried onions more avo and it was a hit.   Try this place out. Everything on the menu is a decent price point your in Vegas so spend the money order the rolls and live life happily with the most delicious food tour will ever try.",

    "text": "This place was the bomb! Hand-down the greatest place we ate at during my trip to Vegas!  Booking was done easily through Open Table. FYI if you make a reservation, give yourself some time as the location is a bit hard to find in the maze of it all the other shops.  Food was amazing. I was really blown away by some of the dishes we had.  JAPANESE A5 WAGYU BEEF GYOZA 10/10 Get this!!! To this day, I still crave this wagyu dish. All of the elements of this the dumplings worked extremely well together with the sweet puree cutting through the juiciness of the beef. My friend loved this so much so ordered her own dish so she didn't have to share with me (lol)! When she finished, she ordered another one! Highly recommend!  ASEVICHADO 9/10 This roll was delicious, there were little bits of truffle on top of the roll which was unique and gave it a really good flavour. It has different pieces of fish on top so there was variety in between each bite.   UNI NIGIRI 10/10 Fresh uni with the perfect ratio of uni to rice. I loved this!  HAMACHI NIGIRI 10/10 Extremely fresh and very sweet fish on top of the rice.   SASA HANDROLL 4/10 I felt like I ordered this because a lot of yelp-ers recommended it. It was OK to me. I couldn't finish it, the price doesn't justify what you get which is mostly quinoa. I would not order this again.   CRISPY TAQUITOS - A5 WAGYU 6/10 (FREE!) This was complimentary. Because we raved about the waygu gyozas, the host or manager went out of his way so that we could also try these mini tacos. We were pleasantly surprised and impressed with the service. They were good, but nothing to write home about. Get the gyozas!  SCALLOP DISH 7/10 (FREE!) This was complimentary. I enjoyed this. Again, extremely fresh seafood and very unique seasoning. My preference though is that simple is best, and I do prefer my scallops more plain.   Service was top-notch. The manager came by several times to ask us how we liked the food. He knew we came from Canada and made good conversation. I loved the food. I would return for the gyozas and the nigiri. I'd love to try more nigiri and the grilled fish skewers!",

    "text": "Had a great trip to Sushi Samba, Las Vegas over my Christmas break trip. My brother, my boyfriend and I were walking around the Vegas casinos and I was getting hungry. I saw the signs for Sushi Samba and thought - perfect! I used to go to the two NYC locations all the time (apparently, they're both closed now! Booo) when I lived there and I had been to the Vegas location once years ago. I figured I would have something small to eat and a cocktail.  I had to start with a Nina Fresa cocktail as that is what I would get in New York every time. It seems like they changed the recipe a bit. There were more flavors than the strawberry that I remember, but it was still good.  I talked my boyfriend into sharing a spicy tuna roll and the chicken teriyaki with me. Both were delicious. I've always loved Sushi Samba's chicken teriyaki as it comes with these cool purple mashed potatoes and plenty of teriyaki sauce to swirl your perfectly cooked chicken in. Bravo!  My brother, who was just going to have a beer and call it a day - ended up ordering some nigiri. He started with the salmon and yellowtail and loved it. He then kept ordering more because he said the salmon was amazing: perfectly fatty and fresh. He also ordered tuna on his next round. He was so high off his nigiri that my boyfriend and I ended up ordering some as well. So good!   All in all, we had good cocktails/beer, rolled sushi, nigiri and chicken teriyaki. The service was good and we were generally left to enjoy each other's company and the good food. I wish we had one in Boston!",

Sushi is very unique and bursting with flavor (would highly recommend the yellowtail tacos and the Kanpachi sashimi - we ordered both twice). Service is good based on the amount of guests and the restaurant was pretty busy. Looking forward to come back for sure and trying a few new items in addition to our favorites.",

Then asked for items that were so basic any sushi spot should have to be told no. Then started asking questions about some of the happy hour items that turned into him trying to persuade us into getting literally the most expensive items on the menu. He finally suggested  the sea bass which I will say was very good, but everything else... not what it's hyped up to be. Had to even correct the food runner on what each sushi was after being told they were things we did not even order.",

    "text": "Went to this place for lunch when I was attending a conference at the Venetian and had some time to grab something to eat. I was getting tired of the super unhealthy \"typical\" Vegas food, and was specifically looking for sushi to have something a little bit lighter.    I was almost dissuaded from sitting down as I looked at the menu. The main drawback of this place is that it's pretty pricey, even for Vegas. Their sushi roll offering was pretty limited, and the rolls averaged around $20. But I was really set on sushi and decided to go for it anyway. I opted to sit at the bar because I was by myself, and actually didn't even realize I could sit at the sushi bar because it was kind of in the back and I didn't notice it when I walked in. The bartenders were friendly and pretty prompt with the service, so I think it's a good option if you don't have a ton of time.  I tried two rolls, one was the Samba Strip, which literally had lobster and was wrapped with rice paper.  It cost a whopping $26 dollars, which is normally the cost of two normal sushi rolls. But of course there was an upcharge for the lobster.  Moving past the price, the roll itself was delicious. The flavors worked well together and it was exactly what I was looking for. After I finished it, I was still hungry (because it was not a heavy roll) so I decided to get a Lima roll, which had shrimp tempura, king crab and avocado.  This roll was $18 (probably due to King Crab) but also was delicious.  Both rolls came out pretty quickly, and I was pleased at the speed of service. The price is definitely the disadvantage of eating here, but you'll not be disappointed with the food!",

    "text": "Sushisamba is located at The Venetian. What can I say? This place is trendy, fun, has personable hostesses and bartenders! Will definitely be back here. For starters, it's in The Venetian, one of the most beautiful hotels on the Las Vegas Strip. Sushisamba is located on the second floor in the Canal Shoppes, along a restaurant row of other highly recommended restaurants. :)  As you walk down the hallway, you can't help but notice they have ample bar seating situated in a roundabout fashion, and a beautifully designed restaurant on the inside  For starters, they have a very extensive sake selection as well as a full bar of other wine and cocktails. Personally, if I'm having sushi, then I'm having sake! ;)  They are open from 11:30am daily til 1:00am!  If you are out on the town and want to dine fancy casual, then I highly recommend this place! They have a late night happy hour from 11:00pm til 1:00am! Be sure to check out their happy hour menu. :)  They have a nice selection of appetizers, small plates, taquitios, nigiri, sashimi, hand rolls, oysters, meat, fish, seafood, anticuchos, large plates, churrascos, samba rolls and Japanese wagyu. They also have a \"chef's inspiration\" menu!  There are no TVs at the bar seating in case you're looking for sports, however, there are other bars at The Venetian that can accommodate you sports fanatics.  As with most hotels and resorts in Las Vegas, most resorts are now charging for parking. We Lyft so you may want to call ahead to inquire.  Service was exceptional! I had the honor of conversing with other \"out of towners\" who come here every time they're in Las Vegas! I would highly recommend Sushisamba to anyone who has not yet dined here! :)",

Our family of six were out walking around the Strip in above-100 degrees weather, and had walked a far distance to get to Sushisamba. There was nothing specific about the dress code, and turning a young boy down because he did not meet their \"standards\" is just blatant DISCRIMINATORY, especially considering how girls with strapless tops are freely admitted here (as I have witnessed several times while dining here in the past).

I was in Vegas celebrating my birthday with my mom and cousin and we came to SushiSamba on our first night. I had checked out the menu online and before we arrived I was curious how we would ever decide what we wanted to get (everything looks and sounds amazing!! but the menu is extensive). They have everything from sushi, to oysters, to small plates to meat on the robata grill. All of this ranging from traditional Japanese to Brazilian and Peruvian. Overwhelming to say the least but in the best way :)   We asked our waiter what he recommends for three people and he said they could essentially craft a tasting menu for us on the spot! He asked us what we liked and didn't like and how much we wanted to spend per person and off he went. For the next hour or so, the most amazing food was brought to our table consecutively until we couldn't bare to eat anymore!   The wagyu beef gyoza was so unbelievably rich and delicious and the yellowtail taquitos were so fresh. And i must say - I do not think I can ever eat Chilean Sea Bass again in my life because it will NEVER compare to the one I had this night. I am drooling at the thought. And of course the sushi was phenomenal.  i know there are a lot of restaurants to choose from in Vegas but do yourself a favor and make a reservation here!!",

I asked him where the restaurant was located and he gave me general directions. Told me I couldn't miss is because the place looks modern and has a lot of orange. Sure enough, I found it in one try.   We sat at the bar and had a few drinks. The drinks were good! Our bartender was very friendly and quick. Turns out the bartender and my friend had mutual friends. Small world! I ordered some Hamachi Sashimi and Samba Rolls to munch on since I needed food. It came out fast!

Service was FAST and excellent. Our waiter offered great selections, but we did up picking our own meal: two small plates and a roll.  Of the dishes, I liked the gyoza that sat on a bed of squash puree --- melted in my mouth.   They also noticed we were celebrating, and gave us cake pops --- DELICIOUS.   I am a bit bummed that the sashimi/nigiri was a little too pricy... and we ended up not ordering it.  Overall, nice place, but it is $$$$. Thus, I prob won't go there too often.",

We had a dinner tasting selected by chef Outlaw based on our likes/dislikes and we were not let down! He came by our table to introduce himself and tell us about the restaurants history, flavor and chat for a bit. My personal fav was the sea bass.. omg, my bf loved the wagu. The fish in every dish was so fresh! We had a pretty big variety come to our table and it was so cool seeing his parents eyes widen with each beautifully tasting and looking dish. Benjamin was our server and was great! Didn't miss a chance to check on us and keep our glasses full. And to top off the night we received a huge birthday platter or different desserts, ice cream, fruit, honey toast, donuts, chocolate, meringue.. a truly great experience! Thanks to the entire staff!",

The Restaurant: Located inside the Palazzo, this restaurant is super trendy and chic! I love the colors and the graffiti on the walls. The architecture is contemporary and stimulating. The restaurant is big, it has areas for big groups and special events. Bar and lounge are good for happy hour. There is a sushi bar for the people interested in only consuming sushi. There is a big opening and you can actually see what's happening inside the kitchen. A lot of smoke comes out and fits perfect with a smoke monster graffiti they have on that wall.   The Food: Prepare to enjoy the most delicious and tasteful food you ever tried. Sushisamba goes above and beyond a regular menu. Anything on the menu would taste amazing. Like I mentioned on my last review, you are going to experience an explosion of flavors and savor a taste of Brazil, Japan and Peru.  The menu has different options: lots of delicious appetizers, robata, tapas, sushi, but they also have regular main courses. Their menu has some vegan options.  My favorite thing to do is to order a bunch of little items and share them with the whole table, that way I think I get the most of the experience.  We like to come here with friends and hang out. The menu is so different and unique that all our brings who come here for the first time continue to visit!   My top favorites are:  -Chilean Sea Bass: Amazing robata-style sea bass with delicious miso glaze! The most mouth watering fish I ever had.   -Lamb chops: they have two options the pre- sliced lamb cooked to perfection with a delicious sauce on top or smaller chops that you just bite ride off the bond! Yummy!! The 2nd option comes with delicious potatoes.  -Coconut Rice: delicious rice cooked with coconut milk and shredded coconut on top. Perfect to accompany the fish or the lamb. It gives a sweet taste after something salty...mmmm love it!  -Fried sweet plantains: cooked perfectly these plantain slices have onion on top and taste really good!  -Peruvian Corn: This corn is heaven! I love it! is bigger than regular corn and its flavor its in between salt and sweet. It comes with the Chilean Sea Bass. They pair perfect.  - Filet skewers: Yummy and juicy with a flavorful sauce.  -Yellow Tail Taquitos: These Taquitos are just amazing! I feel I could eat them all day long. They come with a delicious spicy sauce that gives them a perfect kick.  -Scallops: These fried scallops appetizer are delicious, wrapped in a lettuce and topped with sauce. Yum!    -Samba Strip: My favorite roll on the menu, delicious sushi with lobster on top, the sauces in the side are amazing!  -For special occasions we've had \"Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza\" is delicious steak that you get to cook on a volcanic rock in your table! Its fun and delicious. But a little expensive, that's why I save it for special occasions.  I could seriously keep going on for hours and hours, but I have to make it to the Caipirinhas and dessert!!!  The Caipirinhas are amazing! They use premium cachaca, delicious lime juice, and you get a sugar cane stick on your drink! Be aware, caipirinhas are strong! Cheers!  The dessert is awesome! I love the \"Samba Split\" it's a combination of flamed bananas, red fruits, caramel pop corn and the most delicious homemade \"Dulce de Leche\" ice cream. Delicious and perfect to share! Sometimes I only get the ice cream because I ate too much.   Every dish you get here is like a canvas, they decorate and treat the food like art! I love food with great presentation!   The Service: Wonderful service! Get ready to receive royal treatment! The staff here is well trained and ready to take care of you. Somebody is always topping the waters, other guy making sure there are no dirty plates in the table and getting you new clean plates, if the main server is busy and the food is ready somebody else will bring it. My family and I always request to seat on ISSAC'S SECTION. We met him like 4 years ago and he has always given us the best service. He is a friendly, fun, and cordial guy.  Issac always make sure we have a great experience and always tells us what's new with the restaurant.  The manager always comes to our table to say hi, and if he knows we already visited the place he brings us an appetizer on the house to thank us to be back. I see them do this with everybody! I think is awesome!",

I knew as soon as I read the description for SushiSamba that the fusion thing would provide the party atmosphere I wanted for my birthday dinner and I was right!  We started with the cocktail tower at the suggestion of our server (whose name I can't remember because I suck and she was AWESOME) who also provided an additional taste on the house. AMAZING.   So I'm sure you've heard of fish tacos. But have you heard of yellowtail taquitos?! These were freaking amazing. Mini tacos filled with insanely flavorful yellowtail sashimi and a bunch of other yummy stuff. GET THEM. Besides, baby tacos? Cute. We ordered a bunch of other small plates and a ton of sushi, the names of which I cannot remember. The shrimp ceviche and crab gyoza were also amaaaaazzzzinnnnggg!   Because it was my birthday, I was surprised with a sparkling (literally, there was a sparkler sticking out of it) dessert that I was nice enough to share.  Everything about SushiSamba was on-point, from the food to the service to the atmosphere. It was so much fun and the best way to celebrate a birthday.  P.S. Did I say AMAZING enough?",

    "text": "I was surprised at the more casual and young vibe of the restaurant. I love that it stays open later than most restaurants.  To start we had miso soup and edamame. The miso was good and they put cilantro in it, which definitely gave it an interesting and new flavor without totally changing the miso. The edamame was pretty standard, although my boyfriend said he felt the salt had a different flavor which made it taste better.  My boyfriend and I opted for the tasting menu. We told our waitress our likes and dislikes and the price range we wanted to stay within per person. She bought out courses for us based on our preferences. The ahi taco was good. Of everything we tried three dishes really stood out as amazing, the scallop with some kind of green sauce on top, the miso sea bass, and the king crab leg (also with a sauce on top). The sea bass was amazing. If I were to return, I would probably just have an entire plate of that. All three of those were very good. There was also a side of corn that tasted quite yummy. The sashimi was good. I particularly liked the yellowtail. The tuna was good and the white fish was very bland. We also had two rolls. One was the Lima roll, which was good, but I was disappointed they gave us a roll with tempura. I can't  remember the name of the other roll, but it had tuna and asparagus. It was good.  Over all, the meal was awesome. I loved trying the different combinations of foods and getting to try a wide variety from the menu. If you're up for splurging, I definitely recommend giving it a try.  *** WARNING*** We attended the dinner with another couple. Our friend asked for a spicy hand roll and to make it very, very spicy. He said when he goes places he always asks for extra spicy and is disappointed. Our waitress put \"super spicy\" on the ticket. Well after one big bite of the roll, he had to rush to the bathroom and proceeded to throw up 25 times! It turns out the sauce put in the roll was SIX MILLION SCOVILLE heat units.  Way too much. The manager was good about checking on our friend in the bathroom, but all they did was take the hand roll off the bill. I know our friend asked for extra spicy, but I feel a good chef should know where the line is and to not do that to a customer. The restaurant should have comped the meal, since they didn't even get to eat the dinner (they had it boxed to go, but it just went to waste in their room).  They weren't even offered a free dessert, which I'm pretty sure even a silly chain restaurant would have done. It was their last night in Vegas and he had to spend it sick in his room. So, a word of caution to all you spicy heat lovers, be careful they will not hold back and potentially ruin your night!!",

    "text": "We celebrated my birthday this year at SushiSamba and it was exceptional. The best way to enjoy the menu here is to ask the waiter order the food for you.   If you give them a set $$ amount that you want to spend they really stay within that figure and help you enjoy a variety of their dishes. More than you probably would if you tried to attempt on your own.   Starting off the meal was a trio of veggie dishes including Green Bean Tempura with Black Truffle Oil. Happiness. We all loved that and ended up dipping everything we could into the Truffle Oil.  For the main course we had a selection of 5 different meats with a variety of dipping sauces including two types of chimichurri, one red and one green. The red had more of a vinegar flavor to it. Different than traditional but still delicious.  Sides included collard greens and peruvian corn.   As a last course we were given 3 large cut rolls of sushi including the El Topo. A must if you want to experience salmon and crispy onions together. Very different and quite delicious.   Obviously we had cocktails as it was my birthday, so my sister and I both ordered the Chu Cumber \"chu-tini\" and it was beyond. Anything with elderflower in it is refreshing and light and makes me want to jump on a plane to the most lazy, tropical destination possible.  The waiter also threw in a sparkling (literally) Coco Duo dessert for my birthday.   Service was great and we were all a very happy group by the time we headed out to see Jabbawokeez!!",

My dates cocktail was pretty impressive as well, the cocktail glass lined in sugar.  I'm pretty partial to Asian Fusion, in general, and with the addition of the Brazilian flair, this place is one of the rare few that get my five stars.  In Vegas style, a pretty swank interior with hanging sculptures, a viewing window of one table, into the mens bathroom, and open and expansive seating area in the back, all come together nicely for a great meal out.  They're open late night (2AM on weekends) - so a bonus if you're strolling out of Tao a bit early.",

However, it was New Year's weekend and everyone was desperate to even get in, so we got over this minor negative in a hurry. Our server, Justin, more than made up for the bad seating. He was knowledgable and gave great suggestions as to what to try. We diced on letting the chef bring us a sampling of his creations. Boy, what a gift!",

I must preface we came for a lunch which went swimmingly, the complimentary Peruvian scallops were the caliber of the best French restaurants of Paris.  Great service great experience.  Hence our decision to come for dinner.  Making a dinner reservation is useless, you wait an hour any way.  Only to be greeted by a snotty receptionist making arrogant comments about having to wait.  To add insult to injury, the waiters are over worked and under trained.  Placing an empty water glass and not filling it for 15 minutes and not brining sake that was ordered  upon seating another fail.  Always bring the alcohol.  People will overlook almost anything if they are drinking.  I spoke to the manager and I recommended giving the receptionist the \"how to win friends and influence people\" training since she lacks any skill in that area.  The waiter needs training as well.  I will not hold it against New York or Miami.  They rock.",

In my opinion every good meal needs a good beverage to go with it. I personally like to have a local beer, or one that matches the entree. This day, I selected the Hitachino Red Rice Ale.   It was an outstanding pairing with my sushi rolls and quinoa dish.   The Sasa Handroll came with shrimp tempura, quinoa, shishito, spicy mayonnaise and red onion. It was an experience to eat, and should not be missed.   It was upstaged only by the Quinoa Chaufa side, which was fried and topped with delicate plantains. These were the stars of the meal, and the two pedestrian rolls I ordered, were expertly prepared, and delicious.   Well done!",

I liked the fact that you can have great sushi and drink alcohol (Mojito's etc.) for a decent price (happy hour). If it's your first time you can always try their happy hour and decide for yourself.

    "text": "Well this is a new fusion- Brazilian- Sushi. Can't say I've tried a newer combo, but from the little Brazilian treats I had here, I'd have to say it works. Located in the Palazzo,  this place has an upscale, trendy vibe. Service, seating and decor were all impressive. On to the food...  WHEN YOU GO- reservations are recommended if you plan on stopping by after 6. The place gets uber crowded in the evenings, especially on weekends. Like I said, I didn't get to try as much of the Brazillian side of the menu as I'd like- I'll def concentrate more on that next time. I can speak for the Waygu Taquitos. Could be the best single bite of anything I had in Sushi Samba. Delightfully crisp and light, they were the best taquitos I've ever had. The sushi held it's own but they have a lot of competition in Vegas (see my Yellowtail review). I was impressed with the Lima (shrimp, crab and avo) and the El Topo (salmon, jalapeno and mozerella!). Excellent oyster menu as well. The Kumamto's were delicious, but at $5 ea, not the best deal in town.  All in all, I like Sushi Samba and will definitely be a return guest!",

Yellowtail taquitos - not really taquitos, more like tacos, but still yummy!  Tempura Green Beans - the dipping sauce was great!  Salt and Pepper Squid - always love squid! They're big pieces so it's hard to eat in one bite, but also really chewy so hard to take bites.  Miso seabass skewers w/ Peruvian corn - my favorite dish! The fish was so flavorful and cooked perfectly! The corn was ok, but everyone else loved it!  Lima roll, bobo Brazil, San Paulo - all great rolls, we wanted to order more of them but got too full.   Ramen - was just okay. Wouldn't order it again.  Cucumber Soju - so good and refreshing!   Chocolate dipped green tea ice cream - nice and light. Sprinkles with pop rocks to give it some fun texture!  Overall food was amazing and I definitely had some of the best sushi that night! The manager came around to all the tables and he was super generous with us! He recommended a bunch of great dishes and cocktails and made our night way more fun! Be careful though because it's pretty pricey, but well worth it when you're willing to splurge!",

All the rolls (tuna, yellowtail, salmon) were fresh and I give them extra love for serving spicy tuna that wasn't ground up tuna bits mushed together with spicy mayo, but actually a tuna roll with spicy mayo on top. Love that. The servers were on top of everything and were on point with the cocktails.   Speaking of, we sipped on a Chu-Cumber (shochu, Hendricks Gin, elderflower liqueur, freshly muddled cucumber) and although called a 'wuss' by my lady friend for ordering it, it happened to be a well made cocktail. Her Samba Juice (Cruzan raspberry and Watermelon Rums, acai, passion fruit, creme de banana, guava) was good as well. Both run $12. If you're 'stuck' in the Palazzo, def try and hit up the HH specials which look like a fun time!  I'll be back asap for more of the menu and to bump this baby up a star.",

    "text": "Being that this restaurant is a fusion of Peruvian, Japanese and Brazilian cuisine I was definitely interested in going there.  We ordered a bunch of dishes tapas style - Seabass with peruvian corn, Quinotto, Chicken Anticuchos, Yellowtail ceviche and El topo roll.  Food was pretty flavorful and creative,  being a True fan of peruvian cuisine it was a little off especially the ceviche but seabass with peruvian corn was the favorite all around.  Mixed drinks were great especially the Pisco sours and Caiprinhas.  Overall great place for tapas, most portions are small.",

    "text": "I really want a Bay Area restaurant to steal Sushi Samba's Wagyu Gyoza with pumpkin puree. WOW. I was excited to try this restaurant because the ambiance looked edgy and I was curious to try Japanese/Peruvian/Brazilian-fusion food. We were greeted with an amazing scallop dish, compliments of the chef, which assured me that I was going to be in for a great meal. The sake/wine/cocktail list was impressive and our waiter helped us choose a really nice, unfiltered, cold, sake. Our table of 4 opted to state a price per head and allowed our waiter to choose our menu for us. We had 2 must-haves - the wagyu gyoza and the pork belly. I was afraid we would leave a bit hungry but the waiter insisted $60-70/person would fill us up. Boy, was he right! We were graced with plate after plate of delectable food items. We pretty much ate every dish that most Yelpers commented on. Our drink bill w/ a bottle of wine, bottle of sake, and a round of cocktails made our bill hefty but this was such a memorable meal that no one complained! Service was fantastic, the ambiance colorful and lively, and the food is amazing! Will make our way here again next time we take a trip to Vegas.",

Most of all, the rolls and sashimi (Otoro... drooolllll) were spot on, very fresh and very flavorful.",

    "text": "I've been to SUSHISAMBA twice, and although the food is amazing, I absolutely do not recommend coming here with a large group of people.  The first time I came with a group of 4 and it was so great, I demanded to go again the next time I went to Vegas.  However, this time, with 14 people, the staff was incredibly rude to us and made it extremely apparent that they did not care about us, because we would need to pay the 20% gratuity anyway.  Dining with a group of people with extremely varied tastes, we wanted to order ala carte from the menu...a simple request.    However, the waiter/maitre d refused to let us do so, and kept pushing for us to go with the \"tasting sampler\" which would be customized to our tastes.  He kept trying to haggle down the price, which wasn't the issue.  The issue was that some of us wanted only high quality sashimi and rolls and others did not eat raw fish.  Eventually we gave in because we had been arguing with him for nearly 45 minutes.  He promised that there would be \"lots of sushi,\" and food started to come, without ever asking us what types of food we liked.  Eventually sushi did come...4 very, very small rolls, with the cheapest types of fish possible.  Although the food they brought out was good and I tried things that I would probably not have ordered, I wanted to eat the things I did like in large quantities, as did the rest of the people in my group.  If I'm going to pay as much as food at SUSHISAMBA costs, it better damn well be things I actually want to eat.  We probably would have spent more money ordering what we actually wanted anyway.  I have never dealt with service being so pushy and so unresponsive to our requests.  This trip definitely made me rethink my previous love of the restaurant, I'm not sure if I'll be back.",

Highly recommend.   We also had the cucumber cocktail, lychee bubbletail, and lychee martini. All amazing. We ordered the special roll for the night which was phenomenal.

On the reservations site I was told that happy hour was served throughout the restaurant which sounded perfect because we had a big party and we all know how crowded the bar area can get. However, once we arrived, we were told it was at the bar area only. Whomp. The bar area is super small but we managed to snag a little table and squeeze all of our bodies around it. Not the most comfortable seating, but it'll have to do.  We ordered everything on their happy hour menu. All the dishes were about $5 and we wanted to try everything. Unfortunately our waitress came back 3 times just to tell us that they \"no longer had this item on their happy hour menu\". BOGUS! I asked why and she told me that their menu is ever changing and since we came on the last day of the month, \"they ran out of ingredients\". REALLY?!  So instead of eating, we decided to just drink and ate whatever few things they did have on happy hour. We ordered some rolls off their regular menu and they were all lacking. A $16 roll with only 4 pieces? Kind of ridiculous, wouldn't you agree? And it wasn't even all that. We left hungry and disappointed. Luckily we were buzzed so we got over it rather quickly.",

The price is kind of pricey, but again...it what you might expect in a restaurant at The Palazzo, but nothing ridiculously crazy or overpriced.

If you are a True sushi enthusiast, you must go to Sushi Samba to experience the most PHENOMENAL SUSHI ever!  My boyfriend and I got to Sushi Samba at around 12am on Saturday. It was packed with pretty people and the DJ was bumpin' the beats! We didn't need a reservation and were seated quickly. If you're like us and willing to splurge on a palate party sensation, then continue on with reading my review.  We were greeted by our fabulously bubbly (*not in an annoying way*) and knowledgeable server Isabella Monstrous (she gave me her business card *how cute is that*). She recommended the Crispy Yellowtail Taquitos (they look more like mini tacos really)...man was she SPOT ON! These little tasty tacos were filled with fresh yellowtail pieces that were swimming in spicy aji panca sauce and fresh lime! They were so delish we decided to get a second order. Then we continued on our tasting tour with the following dishes that were the highlights of our night (we ordered more than this, but I don't want to write a colossal review):  * Assortment of four - *My Favorites!!! o Yellowtail (Jalapeno and lemon grass)* o Kanpachi (Yuzu, sea salt, black truffle oil*) o Tuna (granny smith apple, serrano, lime)* o Salmon (orange and mustard miso)  * Seared Wagyu Beef* (ponzu gelee, warm japanese mushroom, truffled tofu crema) o This was my absolute favorite thing of the night!!!! This sauce was amazing over the Coconut Rice (flavors were savory, not sweet, coconut flavor was not over powering). The Wagyu beef was so buttery and melted in my mouth.  * Rock Shrimp (creamy and crispy deliciousness) * Dessert - Samba Split o I cannot even begin to describe how exceptional this dessert was! I was pretty tipsy by the end of our dinner thanks to a 720 bottle of Komotsuru sake ($115, but so worth it, fruity, light flavor and gold flakes don't come cheap). All I remember is decadent coconutty and dulce de leche creamy goodness! Seriously, when I took my first bite it was like...\"COME ON, REALLY?\" I wanted to get another. Thank goodness for my boyfriend's fatty prevention intervention! Good lookin' out my man!  Overall we loved this place because the tapas style servings were perfect for a couple who wanted to try a little of everything. Their Brazilian play on sushi fusion is quite genius and it works!   The restaurant is bright and beautiful and most importantly the attentive and knowledgeable servers and wait staff make your meal so much more enjoyable! Our bill including tip was over $400, but I truly feel like it was worth every penny! My boyfriend and I will definitely be going back to Sushi Samba the next time we're in Vegas!",

If I had a choice I'd probably order 3 orders of those and eat em all night.  The pretty good: Also had some sushi which was really good, server recommended some rolls not mentioned in the menu which were spot on, but cant top the yellow tail taquitos!  BTW, place is a bit pricey (if you order alot), so be prepared if your trying to fill up b/c your wallet is gonna throw up benjamin's all over the place and there will be nothing left to gamble with!   Am I coming back?   Can't wait to try the rest of the food on the menu : )",

    "text": "When my friends said we were going to meet up at Lavo after dinner I figured we can grab a bite to eat here.  It just sounds like an interesting mix of everything I love...Japanese and Latin food. Yums...  My friend and I wanted food but didn't want to be over fed either.  We asked the server what we should have and he suggested the 3 item meat plate (part of the Latin/Brazilian side) and maybe start with a seabass appetizer.  We went with his suggestions and were so incredibly satisfied.  The seabass was amazing.  It was flavorful but light just perfect before our meat combo.  For two girls it was more than enough food.  There was an option for a 5 meat option but I think that would've been over board.  Everything was pretty yummy and satisfying.   Service was also nice.  Although this place is extremely busy at night and it's pretty hard to see (the dark atmosphere is great for romantic night but hard to see the menu).  Also, the decor was interesting.  I found myself having slight ADD trying to look around at everything from video montage in the background to the fun anime like murals.  Music was a tad loud too but you can still carry on a conversation.  Reservations are recommended but my friend and I just kinda came here on a whim and got in right away.  Given we're only a party of two.  Drink menu was crazy long with an extensive list of sake.  We didn't get any but I sure would think they'd have what you're looking for if you're in the mood to drink. Also, prices can be \"steep\" on some items but the items we got came to a grand total around $55 or so.  Not bad by Vegas standards and split between two of us that was nothing...we were full and happy.",

The Miami locale lacked alot of the zest and pow you get in Vegas.  Out of all the ones I been to, I like vegas the best.   The Churrasco plate is wicked. I usually go with 3-5 friends and share this plate.  The chorizo is off the hook.  All kinds of flavor happening.  The new tokyo and topo rolls are insane good.

The service is excellent, but the I think the concept of this restaurant doesn't really attract me. There was nothing really special, it just seemed like a Brazilian BBQ restaurant with sushi.  The meats are really good, we had the 5 meat Churrasco ($46) and some Kobe beef sashmi ($12 per piece!). The Kobe beef sashmi is grilled on a cooking rock.  The selection of oysters was not that many, but the ones that did carry : Malpeque and Blue Point ($3-$4) were decent.  Overall Sushi Samba is an very okay restaurant. It is quite expensive, although very exquisite. I can now say I have been here, but there are other places to try.",

We stuck to sushi because our time was limited before our show.  3 of 4 rolls were excellent.  One was fine, but had a really odd flavor profile (Kobe beef roll - was really bitter).  They take their sake way to seriously, all served cold unless you make them warm it up.  Honestly, sake is just not that good to begin with, cheap and warm is just fine.  Tried a $60 bottle that was highly recommended and found it mediocre at best.  Meal is very pricey, even by strip standards.  Tao has a much more interesting feel and environment, is just as good, and is more reasonably priced.",

He brought us food according to what we preferred, but food was on par with chain restaurants like the Cheesecake Factory. Don't hoard the menu dudebro! Bill came and it ended up being 150 a person. Triple what he had told us it would be. 6 people and 1100 dollars for an average meal is not what I want to experience in Las Vegas. I'm fine with spending money, but it needs to be worth it and I need to know in advance so I can budget accordingly.  Ambiance was nice, service was attentive... But hey, we were the cash cow of the night, if he had ignored us, our complaint to the manager would have been legitimate enough to get a discount. This restaurant will live on forever in my memory as a regret of wasted money that keep me up at night. Like that time I thought it would be a good idea to sign up for marathons I never ran, or that time I bought my ex boyfriend a gold necklace the year I found out he cheated on me.   Never again!! Stay away, unless someone else is footing the bill!",

    "text": "The service was amazing - our server (Jason H) helped us navigate the Japanese/Peruvian/Brazilian fusion menu with finesse!  Started with the sashimi tiradito - yellowtail was the bomb, served with a stunning jalapeno and lemongrass sauce...brilliant!  Also enjoyed the kanpachi - served with yuzu, sea salt, and black truffle oil.  Yamato roll was very unique and yummy - tuna, foie gras, osetra caviar,  and gold leaf...Anticuchos were wonderful, recommend the sea bass.  Drinks...go with the mojitos and the cucumber martinis",

I had a Mojito which was really good and then I had Chu Cucumber. Nice, very refreshing.   All in all its a good place to come if your staying at the Palazzo/Venetian.

The regular roll we got was tasty too. Can't speak for their steaks...but prepare to be disappointed with the taquitos. They're so small you could feed four of them to your Shiba-Inu/Fox-Paulistinha mix puppy and have it look up at you in hungered disappointment. (A Shiba Inu is a small Japanese dog and a Fox Paulistinha is a small Brazilian dog. If you mixed them I think you would get a pretty small dog.)

    "text": "This restaurant was really crackin when we came on a Sat night for a friend's bday dinner.  You'll definitely need reservations for peak times (ie dinner on a weekend).  It's japanese, Brazilian and Peruvian cuisine all in one.  If you like Japanese w/ a twist, this is the spot to go to.  But beware, for some reason, it was really smokey (prob cause of the brazilian meats they were cooking) and overwhelmed the place (I don't think their blower was working that night).  Nonetheless, the restaurant has a hip vibe to it and along with that came much pricier menu options.  We had a large party of 10 and ordered quite a few things from the menu, but I'll just mention the ones that made our group go gaga over:  1) Chicken Teriyaki ~ Samba Style organic chicken, purple potato mash, aji amarillo, crispy onion - the chicken was to die for esp with the teriyaki sauce along with the PURPLE mash (yummm) 2) coconut rice - a nice twist to rice and vegetarians 3) Rio Grande w/ a choice of three meats (grilled hanger steak, ribeye, pork tenderloin, chorizo, linguica with malagueta pepper oil and chimichurri) - friends had the hanger steak, ribeye, and i think the pork and came w/ a variety of dipping sauces.  Let's just say they were very satisfied.  Overall, it's a fun place, but gets a bit crazy and hectic.  Large parties are better suited for a booth table vs. something in the middle of the restaurant where we were seated (seemed like we were in the way).  They are also well known for having a large saki menu, although we didn't get to try it out that time.  Just more of a reason to come back.",

I came here with a group of 14 girls for a bachelorette celebration dinner a couple of weekends ago and we all loved the food, the customer service, and special treatment!  The waiter offered a 3 course menu for $50/ person.  When the first 4 dishes came out, we were already full, but didn't realize that it was only the first course that came out.  It was amazing the amount of food we got and how good everything was for the price we paid for it.    We got the edamame, green been tempura with truffle sauce, some kind of a fried shrimp appetizer, hamachi tacos, squid, a platter of meats, a platter of sushi and sashimi, and we were even given complimentary shots presented aesthetically to the bride to be!    Great experience.  I have yet to try this place when dining for smaller groups of 2-4 people, but after this experience, I will definitely be back!  I'm hoping they offer the same $50/person type deal with a smaller group.",

We needed an additional place setting, more water, a cocktail, even wanted to order more food. The manager finally got our cocktails, the bus boy got our place setting and water, and we gave up on ordering any other dishes. The waitress came by about once every half hour. For a tapas-style menu and a later reservation (a more \"thirsty\" hour), diners need a lot more attention than that. I feel bad for servers that get overwhelmed by a busy dining room, but that wasn't the case here. I sat listening to our waitress tell the adjacent table about her school, her plans later on, her visiting sibling, and I unfortunately wasn't forward enough to interrupt and remind her that she was neglecting us. We were really looking forward to that dinner too, and we ordered (or tried to order) all the best items on that menu, and left pretty disappointed (we got a sub sandwich on the way home and felt better). I wasn't disappointed with the food (save for the oysters), though it definitely wasn't the best of this visit for me by any stretch. It seems like there are enough great restaurants in Vegas that you shouldn't need to risk spending 80% of your visit wishing you could actually experience the place.",

I wouldn't say I had a terrible experience because I didn't, but it was just OK to me.  The menu is so extensive that it was kind of overwhelming. Luckily, our waitress helped us out. The sea bass and miso robata was excellent with the corn. Highly recommended. I also liked the yellowtail sashimi tiradito, but be forewarned it is VERY SOUR, at least the aftertaste. It's kind of a weird thing because once you taste it, the spice hits you first, then it turns into this super sour flavor and you get that hint of lemongrass. It's not everyday you'll get to taste something this interesting, that's for sure. The waitress suggested something else (which I can't remember right now) and supposedly everyone likes it, but my friend and I did not really like it that much, had way too much of everything my tastebuds were confused. The cocktails were decent, though.  The atmosphere and service here are great. Food is a bit average and it's somewhat on the pricey side, so take advantage of their Happy Hour.",

One thing that is always a priority on vacation is food. It has to be, this is a break from the mundane life I leave behind, so why do I want to eat my standard weekly fare of life in the working world? I love sushi and because of it's nutritious nature figured this would be a great way to replenish all things lost to bottomless cocktails and greasy late night foods. I didn't partake in the consumption of any libations at lunch, but did hear that the mojito was pretty stellar.  I ordered the trio seaweed salad that came beautifully presented on a three trayed dish of hijiki, wakame, and my favorite aka-tosaka. Each were lightly dressed with lemon and sidelined with some tomato caviar. Not terrible for a $11, but not overly substantial either. For lunch I ordered yellowtail jalapeno which was ok if not a little heavy on the jalapeno, and a spicy tuna that was all sorts of bland. I think I would have been happier enjoying these as a happy hour because it seems that the prices are a little easier to swallow for the quality of the food. I didn't order anything complex, and maybe they just let the \"easy\" stuff slide, but I wasn't terribly enthused enough to want to go back and give it a second shot to see just how good the rest of the menu is according to the higher ratings given.",

Sushi Samba was a good restaurant. I visited the other location before. But, I will never come back to this location again since the hostess is so RUDE!!!

It is expensive but that is to be expected. We did not over eat which is good. The real test of good food is how you feel after you have eaten. The food sat well with me. Our table shared all of the dishes which is always interesting because there is a wider exposure to the cuisine. I would recommend this restaurant. Eat well!",

Everything is great and the vibe is chill vegas style     Suggested drink is Hendricks and tonic with cucumber. Delicious. Different.  Try it.   The sea bass melts in your mouth. Unbelievable!  Go in there ready to get the party started. It will exceed your expectations.   Our waiter name is Justin. He wasn't bad but busy.  Only reason I didn't give a 5 is because there was some slack in service. At one point we received dessert menus and then didn't see a waiter for 10 min and we had to ask for him. Just a little disappointing since the meal was so expensive. I expect personalized service.   I did let the manager know and Jeremy took care of us. He let us know what the reason was as to why Justin was extra busy which was a valid point. I appreciated the transparency.",

Easily one of the best entrees I have ever had.   This has been a Vegas tradition for the last 3 years now - having dinner here on the first night of the trip. It has yet to let me down.   Great service, excellent drinks, well-informed staff. A dinner for 4 can easily hit $500+ and it's worth every penny. Definitely recommend letting the server choose your meal for you. You'll try some things you were always scared to order, and you will love them.   Can't wait to go back again!",

They really know how to make you feel welcome and special. Everyone from the manager, bar tenders, greeters, servers, and bussing staff conduct themselves in a highly professional manner.  If you are in vegas you have to stop here, try and do small plates and try all different things on this wonderful menu.

They seems to specialize more in these off the wall rolls that will get your taste buds going crazy. Service isn't bad, but our waiter seemed to be spread thin between the tables he had. Overall prices are a bit expensive. Average roll is $20 and that's for 3-4 pieces. Each nigiri sushi piece was $4-$6 and the Toro was $16 per piece. Yes I understand that sushi at this great quality can be found cheaper near your home, but let's face it, the rent on Las Vegas Blvd. isn't cheap!!",

    "text": "We came to Sushisamba for my birthday dinner a few days ago and I was blown away by the food! It definitely exceeded expectations.  The menu was so overwhelming we didn't know where to even begin and while our waiter didn't really help us narrow things down, he did make some good suggestions and helped us pace out the meal so we can order as we go. He came with the manager, who was very nice and gave us birthday shots, and also asked that we let him know if he could do anything.   Here's what we started with: shishito peppers combo (grilled shishito peppers, tempura string beans with a truffle aioli, and edamame), rock shrimp tempura in a spicy mayo sauce, beef gyoza, and crispy scallop lettuce wraps. The peppers were a good surprise of the night because I didn't expect it to come with the string beans and edamame, but I definitely appreciated the greens in Vegas! The rock shrimp tempura was really tasty, but I wish it was a little crunchier when it came out. They tasted a bit soggy as if they were sitting in sauce for too long, but no complaints because the flavor was still there. The beef gyoza was good, but nothing really mind-blowing in my opinion. The crispy scallop lettuce wrap was phenomenal. Our waiter said it was a new item on the menu and suggested we try it and it really blew us all out of the water.   We followed up the first round with the robata - we got the pork belly, rib eye, sea bass, and duck. All of them were so good, so make sure you pay a visit to the robata section when you visit! The duck and the rib eye to me stood out more than the others - they were cooked very well and had a good mix of unique flavors.  We finished off dessert with their 4th of July special (red velvet cheesecake, frozen blueberries, and white chocolate ice cream) and sadly we were underwhelmed with what came out. I think we were so blown away by the entire meal, we felt like dessert was going to continue the streak, but were left wanting a bit more. Either way, we were so stuffed it didn't matter and the dessert didn't take away from how much we liked the meal itself.  What really set this over the edge is that the chef came out to shake our hands and chat with us really quickly, which I really appreciated! The service was great, the recommendations were on par, and the food was delicious. I would definitely recommend this spot for a special occasion - go ahead and gorge!!",

Ok, that is not a lounge. It's a waiting area with a few small tables and I felt awkward sitting there to eat, but whatever we came for the food, I let it go. Mojito is awesome. Recommend it. We ordered a small order of oysters (just two $5 each) to me that seems a bit extreme as I have gone places where I can get a half or a dozen for a better price. But they were really good and presented nicely. Food was good, our first order came out pretty fast. Our waitress was working the bar as well, so after out first order finished, we waited about 10-15 minutes for her to come back, she was busy, I was trying to be patient. Only thing that saved it is she was very very sweet and remembered our large orders with no second guessing it. Food was good, just seemed pricy for such a small quantity. I love my yellowtail and jalapeno, get it everytime I go for sushi, there plate only had two pieces, when usually I'm served a lot more pieces. Again, very good. But it left me wanting more cause there was so little.",

The sauces provided on the side hurt the flavor a little for those who just crave the taste of marbled soft juicy beef.  I guess anyone that serves this kind of food would get raving reviews because it's just that good.  The sushi was okay, but the gold flakes on one of the rolls added a great effect.

My party and I had reservations for 4 and we automatically was taken aback by the prices of their food. But hell, why not! I was immediately disappointed when it arrived. Our sushi portions were small and our MEATs definitely didn't hit the spot. Although it lacked in quantity, the quality was still there. Our bill was over $200 without tip. Overall, I probably wouldn't choose to go back unless I had serious cash to spend on fusion food I'm not used to. Still, can't help that their servers were pretty damn good looking and the service was impeccable =]",

Food was REALLY SLOW to hit the table, when it did, I realized that one order of sushi was on tiny piece...and, the Toro turned out to be $96 for 6 pieces!! My friend's wife had to wait even longer for her food. Pretty sad. Beer was cold, that part was good, but not much beer selection either...still, Saporo is better than nothing. We switched to udon with pork belly, that was ok, but no where near as good as Noodle Theory back in Oakland. Our waiter was nice, but the kitchen must have been sleeping.

I came here on a Sunday afternoon and ordered the speciality cocktail - samba juice - and the El Topo roll as a snack!  The el tapo roll is the perfect mix between brazilian and Japanese cuisine, and it tasted great with my fruity drink!  It was a bit crunchy with cheese sprinkled on top, definitely something you will not find at a traditional pure Japanese resturant.    I would come here again for a full meal - but of course, like any other Las Vegas restaurant, the price is a bit over the top.  But what else can you expect from an Asian Fusion restaurant?",

This hip little eatery offers a fusion of Brazilian/ Peruvian/ Japanese cuisine. The food was interesting, but in my opinion, not quite worth their price tags (except for the kobe slivers). Our party ordered a variety of dishes, most of which became a challenge to split amongst five. One dish had three large scallops, another dish- six smaller mushrooms, and of course the aforementioned kobe beef slivers. I believe we spent more time dividing up morsels than actually chewing and swallowing our meal. Up until the rolls at the end, I felt like I hadn't really eaten anything.  I wouldn't really recommend this place for groups- although the dishes are tapas and meant to be shared. Sushi Samba would probably be more suitable as a romantic date place. The lighting is dim, the ambiance sexy, and the dishes more ideal to feed TWO adults.",

    "text": "Tucked away in an upper corner of Palazzo is this location of Sushi Samba - to be honest, all lovations have a type of vibe that is Vegas-like - the whole \"is it s resto? is it a loungey nightclub\" - so I would expect that the Vegas location would turn that dial up to 11  sadly, our group of 9 found they turned their kitchen down to zero.  not in quality - the menu and results from it are identical from the other locales.  but the joint wasn't full, so 2 hours to get some asparagus and sushi rolls delivered to our table....unacceptable.  I am always sketchy about the whole 'gratuity included for large parties' - I find that results in the net average work going down (not up) for a server - but this situation couldn't really be pinpointed on a server phoning it in.  based on my experience here vs Tao, Tao wins out - granted, the cuisine isn't identical, but the experience is largely better at Tao.  sorry Samba baby!",

Careful when ordering the Kobe, it's $27 an ounce usually a 5oz minimum. My smart friend ordered 10oz's off the bat thinking it was only $27 total. I am not sure of the name, but the Kobe cooked on a hot rock is delicious. Worth $150 per order? Just for the experience.   If you could gamble $50 a hand on blackjack or pai gow, why not eat it as well?    Pros: unique rolls and flavors  Cons: very pricey ($2 for wasabi haha), mediocre service both times I went",

Which is always a plus~  They had a good selection of food on their menu.  Like I said, it's fusion so you will see various Brazilian, Peruvian, and Japanese food on their menu.  I was really craving some sushi and so I ordered two rolls - the Green Envy roll and their spicy yellowtail roll.  I really liked how they crushed the spicy wasabi peas and put it in the Green Envy roll - it gave it a nice crunch w/ that wasabi kick!  I also REALLY liked their spicy yellowtail roll.  It was simple but I thought was a perfect b/c it really let the taste of their fresh yellowtail shine through~!!",

Had a couple of rolls which were tasty.  We also tried the Robata grilled caribbean lobster which was also nice.  Had a couple of nice sakes here.  Lots to choose from on the sake menu.  We dined on a Tuesday afternoon for a late lunch and a late Wednesday for dinner so the place was never very crowded.  We received good service both times.  I liked it and both times were good but I have tried it now and probably will try other places.  It is worth a try.",

Friendly staff, no card needed and seriously no hassles at all. they had at least three servers who looked like they were catering to our table alone, especially one lady who was like our private waitress. Lots of Sake, great sushi, appetizers, stew dishes ect, So much was ordered for the table and I didnt do the ordering, so im sorry I cant remember each individual thing but MAN WAS ALL OF IT GOOD!.   One star is for the rest of the restaurant as it has no atmosphere really.   I would definately go here with a group. Good food and it didnt make me sick as one review says.

If you've never been, splurge on the \"okasame\" (I hope I spelled that right).  Chef chooses what to serve, 7 course at $100 per person.  You'll get to experience the 3 countries in one night.  Lots of pretty people to see.  :)  Been to both Sushi Samba in New York, this one is over the top as most things are in Vegas.  Liked in NY, liked it here too. This restaurant is in the new Palazzo, connected to Venetian --- this place is incredible.  I was here 6 months ago and there were only 1 or 2 restaurants and shops, now there are more than 40+.  It's crazy what can happen in Vegas in less than 6 months.  This place is a \"Must See\".",

The fish was fresh, but not cut well, and the rice was less than stellar.  The space is broken down into cool loops, so you can feel like you're in an intimate place, but take a look at the walls before you end up at a business meeting under the kabuki \"adult toy\" mural.    I was there with a pretty large group, and I can understand that food may come out a bit slowly.  However, they lost drink orders, which is a cardinal sin for a place with a bar menu that is as big as it is.  The little bites were tasty, and the few bits of Brazillian food that we had were solid. Not amazing, as there are much better ways to do a Brazillian steakhouse kind of menu, but no complaints on that.    What was good?  The environment and the drinks.  If that's what you want, it's more of a 4 star review.",

We arrived promptly at our reservation time and were seated immediately. However, after 15-20 minutes, no waiter came by to introduce themselves or get our drink order. Long story short, several managers came over to apologize, brought over a round of drinks and dessert, and made sure our every need was looked after. Our waiter, Mike D, was extremely friendly and helpful too. Some of the girls in the group had special dietary needs. He made this a priority and ensured all the food came out properly. Also, some of the girls in the group did the tasting menu and Mike D picked out some amazing dishes! I would definitely recommend doing the tasting menu since you get a sampling of so many different items. Overall, Sushisamba had amazing food and service and really made it a memorable experience for our whole party. We would definitely go back again! Thanks Mike D!!",

    "text": "Mediocre is an understatement.   Service was very poor... This was quite possibly the worst experience I've had all year. We sat at table 109; our server's name was not on the receipt so I do not know his name. We had a party of eleven girls.  A lot of us flew in from across the country to have a reunion and celebrate a birthday, but no one left with a smile on our face. In fact, our birthday girl even left EARLY because she just was not having it.   The food in general was unimpressive. A lot of items were very heavily salted (like the miso soup and seabass).A miso soup for $6 is rather comical, considering a box of sea salt costs half the price and our soup probably contained a third of that much. We had to send back the seabass because it was way too salty. You are better off getting sushi elsewhere. I follow one of their sushi chefs on Instagram, and had felt lied to when we got our rolls. Our rolls looked and tasted so average; I've had better from our supermarkets in Little Tokyo. Maybe he only works at the sushi bar? Unsure, you'd have to confirm if you dare to dine here.   For everything we wanted/needed, we had to ask for it at least three times. Why did it feel like I was begging for extra bowls, to-go boxes, or updated bills (at the end of the meal)?  I told our server to cancel one of my orders (one of the specialty rolls). I was in no mood to eat and wanted to get out of the restaurant as soon as possible. But it was brought out later anyway. I did confront him about it and he said he would take it off for me.   Our server had brought out an outdated receipt thinking it was okay. We said we wanted to see the updated check so he excused himself to go get it. So we waited for a bit and eventually got tired of waiting and asked a nearby server to get us our check. Which of course he did not. This was another solid twenty minutes of waiting like sitting ducks. By this point, we did not want to stay in the restaurant for a minute longer, so we walked up to a host stand, asked a server who was standing there not doing anything, to get us an updated bill so we could check out.   After our server noticed us, he walked over to us and told us to go to the host stand up in the front to wait for the manager. He said our transaction would be quicker if we went to the host stand.. So we got our updated bill, which deducted the roll and extra seabass, and paid our bill. Our server thanked us and told us to have a great rest of our evening. I asked our server if the manager was coming out right now and his response was: \"oh no, he's not coming out. But I can grab him if you want.\"   Wait what?!?! So you LIED about bringing your manager out? Okay... You shouldn't have brought it up in the first place!! Now at last, I am livid, because my patience has finally run out and one can only handle so much.  Our friend left a bag of hers at the restaurant so we reluctantly had to head back and grab it. As she walked out, a server noticed she looked quite upset and asked what the matter was. My friend told the server that we felt quite mistreated and very disappointed at our experience.The server offered to deduct 15% from our total bill, but we refused. We were not there to snag a comped meal or there. We were there because we follow one of your sushi chefs on social media, and was really excited to immerse ourselves in a SUSHISAMBA experience.  My friend and I studied hospitality administration in college, are/were in the hospitality industry for many years, and I myself have been in the restaurant industry. We really did try to keep our cool and be understanding. We defended the server many, many times, saying that even though he might not be on his A game, he was very nice overall. There was only so much we could do to defend his actions, but our last twenty minutes spent that this establishment was unforgivable. Please take your money somewhere else, diners, and spare yourself the headache.",

The interior decor is modern contemporary and pleasant to the sight.   We ordered a bunch of dishes on the HH menu to share. The portions are relatively small, but the prices are reasonable compared to the other sushi restaurants on the strip. The flavors are creative, presentation was nice, service was fast and efficient. We probably ordered one of each item on the pretty extensive HH menu, and enjoyed every dish. Drinks were pretty tasty also.  Definitely recommend!",

My bridesmaid made a reservation for 19 people (yes, 3 brides and 15 friends) and was told that we had to do a prefix menu since there were so many of us. No problem; whatever makes the food come out quick and delicious.   Sushisamba was able to accommodate us in a back room which was a little more quiet and our hostess did a wonderful job of making sure all the food came out in a timely manner and made our night even more special with a complimentary shot and customized menus with the brides' names.    Prefix menu Family Style: * Appetizers:     - edamame - nothing fancy    - green bean tempura with dipping sauce (the sauce was really good!) and shishito peppers (had a lemon and salty flavor to it, not spicy at all and so good!) * Course 1:     - Wagyu gyoza - the sauce was sweet     - Crispy yellowtail taquitos - mini tacos with yellowtail, very good! * Course 2:   - Miso sea bass anticuchos - grilled sea bass skewers with Peruvian corn (bigger and mire chewy than American corn kernels)   - Aji Amarillo chicken anticuchos - grilled chicken skewers with Peruvian corn  * Course 3:   - Wagyu beef ishi yaki - raw wagyu beef comes with seasoning and sauces on the side, to be self-cooked on a Japanese hot stone. This was definitely the highlight of the dinner for me. So good! * Course 4:   - Neo Tokyo roll - bigeye tuna; ok   - Lima roll - shrimp tempura, spicy king crab and avocado; this was everybody's favorite out of the rolls   - Strip roll - Maine lobster, avocado and mango; also good   - Salmon avocado roll - eehhh, unwrap it and just eat the salmon and avocado * Course 5:   - Mochi ice-cream: came with vanilla, strawberry, chocolate and green-tea cut in half; there is always room for ice-cream!  Thank you Sushisamba for a wonderful dinner!",

The have a lot of exciting sushi options, but we opted for the traditional salmon avocado and spicy tuna. Both rolls were quite good, although kind of small. The miso soup was good. The place itself has an interesting vibe and is a mix of asian, Brazilian, and Peruvian. There is good (somewhat loud) background music and videos of dancers doing some weird moves! It is a bit expensive (~$35 for two traditional sushis and a miso soup with no drinks), but it was overall a good experience, I'd go back!",

I alerted my waitress immediately that I am vegan and gluten-free. She brought me out a special vegan menu and told me the items that are available gluten-free. I got the edamame appetizer and for my entree, the Amazonian roll and individual veggie rolls special. Brown rice was not available as a substitute for the sushi rice, which I prefer. However, I was able to get over it once my sushi came out. Both my colleague and I agreed it was the best sushi we had ever eaten. I ordered another Amazonian roll and devoured that, too.  Although it is pricey, this restaurant is a must 5/5. 1. For a non-veg restaurant, there are tons of veg options available.  2. I also loved how so many things could be made gluten-free. 3. Service was attentive I wish I could go every week.  4. Fanciest, most delicious vegan sushi ever.",

It was warm and we liked the onion flavored crunch.  Amazonia was also very good. The others at our table commented they were overall ok but mostly bland and too close to grocery store sushi. Seaweed salad was amazing.  The 3 different seaweeds were unique and all great.  The black was my favorite in texture and mild flavor.  The purple was chewy with a balanced vinegar flavor that we all agreed was a hit.  Wage goyza was the biggest overall reason to come back.  It was warm and a good beef flavor balanced by a combo of sweet salty and savory with the squash puree.  We also really liked the crispy jidory egg.  It was not enough to be a meal on its own but a fun dish of crispy meat mixed with an egg and veggies all combine into a well flavored sauce with amazing texture.  Overall a good meal minus the sushi which was what brought us in.",

A little on the pricier side, treat yourself Lad Vegas style to some fresh rolls, a lively atmosphere, and flavorful Brazilian meats.   We ordered a variety of things off the menu (hey, we had to try it all), and not one failed to amaze my tastebuds. The service was impeccable, with the manager insisting we try additional dishes that we didn't order because he was convinced we would leave in a food coma. So far, that's SushiSamba-2: Jennifer-0.   Ladies, just be forewarned. The stalls in the restroom are itty bitty, awkwardly shaped and oddly adorned with a mirror and dimmed lighting. If you can hold it...hold it. Just please, trust me.

We ended up on at Sushi Samba because we were looking for a nice sit down dinner that didnt have its kitchen close by 1030.  There was nothing memorable able the meal. Its supposed to be Asian, Peruvian, Brazilian fusion and I guess it kind of was, meaning that the menu was split into 3 sections where a lot of the same dishes were split under each 'type.'  Portions were unnecessairly small and over priced. One of my favourite dishes is sea bass. I'm always thrilled whenever I see it on the menu. This is the first time I ordered the dish and thought a simple 'meh' by the time it was done. It was fatty, overly sweet and just not the sea bass I know and love anywhere else I go.  Overall we left with a lot less money then we should have and without a typical Vegas memorable food experience.  I say pass, especially considering all the other amazing restaurants on the strip.",

I ordered 2 Rio Grandes to go since I had to catch a flight and the folks back home love the Rio Grande. Unfortunately, part of my order was missing, even after I questioned it.  On the bill, the Rio Grande was listed as Gaucho, so I asked about this and they assured me that it was the same. Since I usually have a great meal and the service is usually good, I didn't question it. The Rio Grande is 45 dollars on the menu, so I expected to be charged 90 for both. However, for those two items, it was listed as $114. I also ordered 2 sides.   I didn't bring it up because I usually love SushiSamba and wouldn't mind paying more to support the restaurant. I also ordered a cocktail and the Wagyu appetizer while waiting, so my bill was a bit hefty. On top of this, I included roughly a 20 percent so my total bill was about 190 - after I was reassured that my order was correct. I didn't have time to look through the bag because I needed to catch a flight, but once I got to the airport, I found out that the Chorizo and the ribeye steak was not included (usually the Rio Grande comes with those two proteins and the picanha, but my order only had the Picanha, the two sides I ordered.  You can imagine my frustration. When I takeout from a restaurant, especially one that I frequent, I expect my order to be correct. I honestly regret tipping so much and even ordering takeout from there today.  I would give 1 star for this experience. The extra star is because I usually do have a positive experience (with Philip, who is the best server in the world and has great service).  I don't think I will come back here ever again. Something amazing would have to happen for me to give this place a second chance.",

When I heard that Sushi Samba fuses Japanese, Brazilian and Peruvian, I dropped everything and made a reservation.  Inside, Sushi Samba will have you in awe before you even taste the food. The interior decor is modern but definitely has a South American flare.  We need more places like this in Vegas!  Service is unfortunately hit or miss. This place often gets very busy and servers sometimes struggle to handle the crowd.  The food selection is very impressive. Don't bother with generic food that you can get anywhere.

They served the duck cooked \"medium\", it was pretty good in my opinion but my husband couldn't stomach the partially uncooked meat...and the little strip of tough fat on top. We were given chop sticks to eat with, and a spoon for the rice. We had to ask for soy sauce, no salt on the table. The waiter was nice. I did feel like the staff were putting on airs.  We had made a reservation and were 10minutes early, but we weren't seated for 40minutes. They definitely forgot about us and gave us a small  \"complimentary\" desert at the end of our meal.

Located in the middle of the shopping center I was surrounded by a bunch of stores that were closed for the night but this big beautiful restaurant was still going.   Sitting up at the bar we were greeted by two friendly and helpful bartenders. They gave us the full menu and the late Happy Hour menu with some recommendations. This is a Japanese and Brazilian fusion style place with a Robata grill so lot of choices. Everything I ordered was fantastic and came in little pupu sizes so we got to try a bunch. I would highly recommend the Eggplant robata, the lamb chop, waygu gyoza, salt and pepper shrimp, and the shishito peppers.   As for the drinks OMG their Wagyu infused Old Fashioned was strong yet smooth and had a very unique flavor because well duh they infuse the Wagyu Japanese Whiskey in house themselves! So you wont find it elsewhere. After one of these I was quickly lured away to the Caipirinha that they had on HH and it was delicious as I learned more about good Cachaca from Erica's professional mixing behind the bar.   This place is definitely worth a visit during HH at night since they are open late and serve great drinks and delicious food all into the night. Check them out!",

Great service, seated right away with our reservation, super cute business cards, and beautifully decorated meals but the quality of the fish and food in general was pretty okay. Nothing mind-blowing. However, I appreciate their attention to detail with unique ingredients and fusion of flavors.   STARTERS  SEARED WAGYU BEEF (4/5): ponzu gelee, warm honshimeji mushroom, truffled tofu crema. The beef was not fully cooked, but it was still tender enough that it melted in our mouths. I would have preferred a warmer version of it. The mushrooms were pretty yummy.  JUMBO SHRIMP SEVICHE (4/5): passion fruit, cucumber, and cilantro. Yes, their menu spells \"ceviche\" that way and I don't know which one is correct nor do I want to look it up. The ingredients were exactly that...and as much as I absolutely love passion fruit...it was way too overpowering for a ceviche dish that is supposed to taste more like shrimp, spicy sauce, and lime. They were also very stingy with the plaintains however they kindly provided us with more to munch on and use as chips. Made very fresh though, I'll give them that. It was very creative.  HAND ROLLS (5/5): I couldn't complain about the quality of the fish. Pretty delicious. I got myself the usual spicy salmon hand roll and they slathered it with spicy mayo but the portion was too small for $10-12.   SAMBA STRIP ROLL (5/5): Maine lobster, mango, avocado, soy paper, lotus root chips, aji honey truffle. Unique ingredients, once again. Those lotus root chips added such a cool twist to the roll and made it aesthetically pleasing. The lobster was delicious and the mango/avocado combination made it a very exotic roll to bite into.  Too bad it ended quickly. Relatively small roll for $26...but it was a nice experience.",

NOW, after many amazing dinning experiences locally, nationally and internationally- it's nice to revisit this place in Vegas and see that it still makes the cut! Kuddos to keeping your quality up to standards AND to switching your CACHACA to 51! Way better!  Sat at the bar and got exceptional service and hospitality from Tiffany (who is new) and Louie who was training her. Believe me... lots of places on the strip is lacking friendly and fun bartenders! I requested a modification of one of their signature drinks and it was NO problem. I didn't get the eye roll or the flat no. Being that I was a bartender once upon a time...to me that's what separates the great bartender from just the adequate one. Come check them out next time you are in Vegas....you won't regret it! So...the food...O. M. G..you WILL enjoy it! Try the Chilean seabass and Peruvian corn, YUM!!!!",

    "text": "After a disappointing dinner at Nobu, I was looking for redemption at Sushi Samba and was very happy to find it both in much better service and great food. The waitress was very attentive and helpful in particular in her recommendations. Yellowtail taquitos were flavorful however the yellowtail flavor was a bit drowned out. Tatake was truly awesome and the Unagi special roll was very good.  Miso marinated sea bass was awesome and on par with some of the best miso black cod (I prefer black cod over sea bass).  Peruvian corn was my least favorite (on chewy side) although worth a try. The deserts where awesome - pineapple tapioca pudding  and peruvian chocolate mousse - and worth a try. Sushi Samba will definitely be on my short list for future visits.",

I like your style haha *snaps|props*   Anyway, I know everything on the strip is pretty expensive and I definitely should have Yelped this place before going in... My mistake, I know. However, I had just arrived in LV, checked into the Venetian and my hotel room key had SUSHISAMBA on it. I figured, 'I've been craving sushi the whole drive over here and this must be a sign! Let's go get sushi!' I went against my better judgment and immediately walked over to have dinner with my family. Ahhhh, I definitely have regrets about that now.... Mannnnn, marketing and convenience just gets ya. -_-  Don't get me wrong; the food wasn't terrible and the ambiance had cool vibes.. I just can't justify spending that much money on 2 oz. of food. I didn't realize it was tapas style but once I found out, I just went with it and though we could order a bunch of stuff and simply share..   We ordered a couple of sushi rolls, one order of sea bass, a scallop appetizer, and steak. Our favorite was the sea bass-super fresh and amazzzzzing taste (but we all had one piece each because there were maybe 5 pieces?-in all honesty, that wouldn't fill me up if that was for one person). Everything else was okay but I think we would have been a lot happier, richer and fuller if we had just gotten burgers.   I would recommend this place as a romantic date for an anniversary or birthday-for intimate occasions, not anything dealing with a group(3 or more lol).",

At first glance, you may think it's not going to be good for vegetarians, but actually there are quite a few options.  The clear winner for me was the Crispy Jidori Egg - it came out perfectly cooked (love that runny orange yolk!) and the kabocha gnocchi was delightful. The generous helping of black truffle shavings didn't hurt either.  I wasn't sure it was going to be enough food (and it is a little on the small side for a full meal), so I ordered the Amazonia roll, which looked interesting and definitely veg. It was pretty good, but I'm not sure it was $12 good. I might go with something else next time.  The selection of beer and sake is great - they have anything you could possibly want, including dark Asahi (soooo good).  All in all a great experience. Will return the next time I'm in Vegas.",

I am subtracting 1 star for the salmon sushi being $5  A PIECE! We ordered it because we thought, this must be some great pieces of sushi. It was no different than a piece you order at RA.

Anyways this place not only impressed my boyfriend and I with their wonderful,tasty food but with also the excellent customer service! My boyfriend was ordering away and the server was kind enough to let my boyfriend know that the portions were on the bigger side and that it would be a lot of food. We thanked him for informing us because it really would have been too much food! The server also checked in on us making sure we were good and that out drinks were filled.  So well I ordered the chicken teriyaki which was so moist and the sides it was paired with really went well together. I don't know how they cooked the chicken breast without drying it out. I would have to say it was one of the best chicken teriyaki I have eaten in my life! The endamame was also delicious with the lime and sea salt. The churassco beef was excellent too! Can't wait to visit Vegas again and we will definitely be heading to Sushi Samba!",

Sushisamba just so happened to have ample availability on a Saturday night, so I was a bit hesitant, but since it was in the Palazzo where we were staying we decided to give it a try.   There were a few highs and lows regarding some of the menu items:  Rock tempura shrimp was not that great. It was too salty and saucy and I couldn't taste any of black truffle dressing. Just lots of ginger and soy sauce. I would probably skip out on the yellow tail crispy taquitos as well...something just tasted off with this. Didn't particularly enjoy the sauce it came with.  The Uni was bomb. Didn't have any type of fishy aftertaste. It was smooth and buttery, so definitely recommend getting the Uni if you come here.  The Sao Paulo roll was probably my favorite, the truffle on top elevated this dish and paired perfectly with the sashimi and other toppings.   We also got an assortment of Nigiri and Sashimi and had no complaints from the table.   Presentation of the dishes, ambiance (if you like dark setting), and service were all on point.",

It's located in the Pallazo connected to the Venetian which could be a bit tricky to locate. I brought my date here for the first time today, hoping that she too would have the same experience. Unfortunately not, we got there about 2:00pm and was seated quickly as it wasn't very busy. Our waiter seemed a bit nonchalant when it came to the menu itself. I explained to him that I had dined many times at other locations and that this was her first time. He replied \"well they're just like all the others\". First I know that not to be True as they tend have a few items that are unique to the location, perhaps he wasn't aware. Apparently he warmed up to the other guests after us as I heard him say \"hey is this your first time here\".  Anyway we ordered a few cocktails which were ok. My date had the Sambatini which is supposed to be a monthly specialty drink concocted by the bar team. It was a little sweet but good. I had gotten the Samba Juice which was ok.  For an appetizer we got the Tuna Tataki. It was delicious, however True to Sushi Samba style they give you just enough to have you wanting for more! We resisted :) Next up we had gotten the Lima roll. Very good, it's your basic shrimp tempura roll with avocado but they kick it up a notch with spicy king crab on top. Not over spiced and very delicious! We then ordered our entree which was the Churrasco Rio Grande. It comes with Wagyu picanha, ribeye and chorizo-prepared to your liking and sliced for you. It is served with a small portion of black beans and rice, a little too small amount of beans for the amount of rice. It also comes with collards and dipping sauces for the meat. The meat was very delicious although our ribeye was cooked more like medium well instead of medium.  They wagyu however was perfect.  Of course we can't just stop there, no no no. Overall I can't give this experience a 5 based on my waiter and aspects of my meal. But believe you me if you have an opportunity to eat here and MONEY to spend-no it's not cheap, then do it! The food is amazing!",

We went with Omakase since my bf and I were clueless about the menu. I ended up liking everything, as the flavors derived from Latin America, so nothing was strange to me. I cannot say the same for my partner, he was looking for traditional Japanese sushi and left dissatisfied.  Customer service was great, the waiter was very attentive and friendly. He informed us of all the different options they offered and was patient.  In conclusion, I would recommend this place if you are looking for something different. Just come with an open mind and a hefty wallet.",

Our waiter was great and he was very attentive (I feel bad for not catching his name in order to give him credit).  We were in a bit of a time crunch and I let him know that right away, he was on board and made sure we got everything as fast as we possibly could. I love Ramen so I decided to give it a try and I'm so glad that I did. The broth had a wonderful flavor with noodles cooked to perfection and the barbecue pork belly gave it an absolute perfect touch. My fiance and our friends ordered a few different sushi rolls and ate every single bite! The presentation of the restaurant environment is both relaxing but also romantic for those that are there for a nice night out for two. There is a stage type of setting for the sushi station which is really cool. If we ever come back to the Venetian this is definitely another dinner option that we would love to revisit again!",

    "text": "My girlfriends and I had the best dining experience at SUSHISAMBA when we were in town for the Backstreet Boys concert. I made a reservation for a group of 6 and they were able to accommodate us even though I called the night before. The restaurant is located in the mall between Palazzo and Venetian and was easy to find. The decor was beautiful and the ambience was fun and lively. The menu was pretty unique with Japanese and South American fusion items. We didn't even order from the menu though because our server offered to customize a tasting menu for the group to share. We explained to him our preferences (sashimi and beef please!) and then left it all up to him. Our first course was a small appetizer of edamame and tempura green beans paired with the tastiest aioli. Then next course included corn and sea bass skewers that were so damn good! My favorite part of the meal was the wagyu beef served raw for us to cook on a hot stone at our table. Our server took a huge chunk of fat and \"oiled\" the stone for us and we just started throwing down thin slices of wagyu on that thing. There were a few different dipping sauces to choose from but I truly enjoyed the flavor of the meat with just a hint of salt. Amazing. Then a sashimi sampler came out with 4 different types of sashimi with various sauces. Last but not least, a huge plate of sushi rolls including otoro (tuna belly) nigiri with gold flakes sprinkled on top. Bougee! Though it seemed like a lot of food, it was the perfect amount to split with a group. We weren't overly stuffed at all. The courses were also timed perfectly so we always had a dish on the table. With drinks, we ended up paying around $120 per person. A little steep but totally worth it!",

The appetizers / small plates we had were all very good (my personal favorite was the chicken skewers but we also tried the wagyu gyozas and a couple of the rolls/sashimi) but exactly as the name describes: small. Imagine a couple of pieces for most dishes and maybe 5 or so for a roll. Happy hour prices were reasonable but probably on the pricier end for the amount of food you end up getting. Definitely a good place to grab a drink (great cocktail prices) and light snacks before heading out to a more substantial dinner!   Pro tip for happy hour: make sure you sit at the lounge (the bar area near the front of the restaurant) or they'll assume you're there for dinner. Service was great-all of the bartenders/waiters were cheery and helpful!   The actual meal looks really good too. I really want to try the locations in New York. If I go back to Vegas this will definitely be at the top of my happy hour/lunch list!",

We went for a late lunch and things were slow, we could hear each other speak, the waitress took her time with us and made several solid recommendations.  The second time, the food was still excellent, but it was loud and not very 'zen'. Waitress was frazzled and not as focused on us.  The food was fantastic both times. Very unique fusion of Japan and Brazilian food that I highly recommend.",

I came here two days ago after my wonderful massage, all excited, hungry, and ready to throw down on some food, so I was glad I made it just in time for the happy hour. To my surprise, service was kind of amiss: my order initially came out wrong, my caipirinha was off and had to be adjusted, the salmon in my salmon avocado roll was a little dark, and the mosquitoes flying around me and my food drove me nuts! The only saving grace was the pork belly and the plantains, which were excellent (the mosquitoes thought so too).  I really hope SUSHISAMBA isn't slacking off on what made them my fave in the first place :/ Sushi don't fail me now...",

We like to skip the main dishes and order many small plates - Sharing and sampling and enjoying our cocktails or saki.  We do love the rolls - they are unique and tasty.  We love the Chilean Sea Bass, but we get it on the skewers, not as the main dish.  It melts in your mouth and on the skewers they have more of the glazed taste.  YUM!   We love the sample of horsd'oevres with the charred peppers, tempura green beens and edamame.  The truffle sauce for dipping is delicious.    The restaurant is very loud, and feels a bit like a nightclub because of it.    I always have a great time and fantastic meal...never been disappointed.",

We literally loved everything we ordered. Be sure to make a reservation because it gets very busy, and if you're celebrating anything let the hostess know. We were celebrating our wedding anniversary and they gave us a free small dessert.  Small plates: Wagyu Beef Goyza - do not miss this! It was incredible - every table around us had also ordered it and we were in unanimous agreement.  Yellowtail Crispy Taquitos - light & delicious with an Asian dressing on the greens.  Robata: Ribeye - it's described as spicy but it's not, just has subtle spic flavoring and was very tender.  Sea Bass - Phenomenal. There's a reason it's the most popular thing on the menu. Melts in your mouth with an amazing miso glaze.  Samba Rolls: Neo Tokyo: Similar to a spicy tuna roll flavor but with tuna both inside and on top of the roll. Fresh and great flavor.  Dessert:  Fried doughnuts with cream dipping sauce - oh my goodness, sooo good. Not a light dessert (fried dough) but ah-ma-zing.  Since we were celebrating our wedding anniversary, they gave us a free small dessert of green tea ice cream pops dipped in chocolate with pop candy crust, which was cool and refreshing.  We will definitely be back on our next trip!",

We arrived and looked at the menu, but ended up not needing it as we settled on the option our server gave to us... tell her our likes and dislikes, and they'd make a custom menu for us to try a bunch of everything.  What followed was a lot of food that we would have never ordered... and we were delighted at the items they brought us.  Our favorite was the chilean sea bass, which was so tasty.  It came with peruvian corn, which is like huge overgrown corn.  We also really enjoyed the yellowtail seviche taquitos and the rock shrimp tempura, as well as a few of the numerous sushi rolls they had brought at the end.  And our meal also included giant crab legs, some peruvian sashimi, and at least one or two dishes I'm failing to remember.  The music was a little loud and not to my dad's taste, but that's typical in Vegas.  The meal was definitely a unique experience, and we wouldn't have stumbled upon half the dishes without letting the chef do his thing.  I highly recommend you dine in this fashion if you visit Sushi Samba.",

    "text": "Intrigued by the Japanese/South American fusion going on here and the rather good Yelp reviews, I ended up here with a group for a late dinner one Sunday night during a recent trip to Vegas. We were seated promptly at our reserved time.  The service was immediately kind of odd. Our waiter did not give us menus (other than for drinks), but instead started talking about how if we had a particular budget in mind, they could send us enough food to fill that budget. Butbutbut...I saw the menu online! I knew there was a menu. I wanted to be in CONTROL! Would the waiter let us be in control?  After awhile yes, yes he did. We were able to secure some menus, and he then proceeded to go through the different sections of the menu with us as if we were eight years old and/or eating dinner by ourselves at a restaurant for the first time. Is fusion really that scary for people?  So we ordered a couple of rounds, tapas style, like we do. There were hits and misses along the way. The best stuff was in the robata area of the menu. The pork belly with the butterscotch miso about slayed me with its awesomeness. The duck breast dish we got was also killer, with a fantastic sauce and lots of meaty, meaty mushrooms. The Shishito peppers were solid, as was the sea eel we got nigiri style. It's hard to mess those two up. The yamato rolls, in all their decadence, were worth every penny.  The seared wagyu beef was probably the biggest miss of the evening. The menu does not list truffle oil in the dish's ingredients, but that's about all I could taste. And for me, truffle oil makes everything taste and smell rancid. Not appealing. The El Topo, while quite good, was also a bit of a disappointment. I love fried onions, but they seemed to overpower here. The yellowtail sashimi also seemed a bit off, as the lemongrass sauce wasn't particularly complimentary.   The service was alright but stayed a little odd during our visit. Sometimes our waiter would be absent for long periods of time, and then suddenly would be around almost too often. The place was loud, almost too loud. Prices are about what you'd expect for a sushi spot on the Strip. Overall, I enjoyed this place, but it is easily overshadowed by the plethora of better options nearby.",

The only meal I ate in Vegas for 3 days ( I kid you not) was Friday not at this place.  It came highly recommended by numerous friends, so I thought this should be some great sushi.    Boy was I mistaken.   Firstly, we had a 10PM reservation.  We arrived at 9:45 thinking we'll grab a seat at the bar and sip on a cocktail and people watch at all the bachelorette parties, etc.  Well, 45 mins later and we still didn't have a table.  My stomach was growling, and my face was scowling at this point.    The hostess was rude when we would ask how much longer for a table, she would just say, You're next.  Really? I'm next you said that 10 people ago??!!  When we finally got our seats, we ordered the following:  --Rock shrimp:  It was tempura battered.  The first few bites were good, but as everything began to cool, it just became mushy.    --Fusion sushi roll was boring, bland and well, you get the point  --The only thing that was excellent was the sea bass. It was moist, delicate and absolutely delicious.  But, $25 for 2 skewers left me wanting.    The peruvian corn was awful..  The restaurant itself is everything that you would expect from Vegas. Upscale, trendy and expensive.  $200 for three items and 4 cocktails.  Not worth my only eating experience in Vegas that weekend.",

Customer service was everything you could ask for in an upscale restaurant such as Sushisamba; they were attentive with all of our requests and the wine list they offered was rather impressive. The atmosphere was the best part of the experience - from the contemporary jazz playing in the background to the modern paintings and portraits decorating the room I would have to highly recommend this restaurant for any sushi lover for tourist for that matter.",

I suggest those who wants to try this place to look @ their menu and think twice about spending $$$ on a small portion of food.",

Our waitress Tanice was absolutely wonderful and she put together a 10 course meal for my table based on our preferances. Every single thing she brought out was pure delight in your mouth...the scallops with pesto sauce were excellent, these small tuna \"tacos\" were amazing, and the chilean sea bass skewers were the best fish I have ever had, hands down. All entrees were served family style and the brazilian/sushi flare to the food was exciting for my taste buds. We got a shot tower (12 shots) for our table and the cucumber martini and sangria shots that came on it were super delicious. The manager Liza came over, pleasantly introduced herself, and checked our table frequently to make sure our meal was perfect. This place is a must for some fun, fine dining in Las Vegas. The ambience is dark, red and trendy in a classy way. It also was kinda cool to see Shawn Marion sitting at the table next to us. Come eat here and ask for Tanice and Liza: you won't be disappointed.",

My friend and I started with Miso soup. Then, when looking at the menu, my friend raved about sea bass. I said I wasn't sure if I've had it... this time was memorable. Before we ordered, we asked the waitress what she recommended. She mentioned the Sea Bass and Miso robato to share and a few rolls. We picked one roll not on the menu and the BoBo Brazil. Nom Nom Nom We loved it all. The skewers of sea bass were delicate with nicely flavored sauce. It came with giant corn pieces that were sort of fun and different. The BoBo Brazil roll was very nice - I think I had this particular roll at the Chicago location, the Kobe beef gets me. The sauce on this one was a bit tangy and citrus-y. I think there were The roll that was not on the menu had tempura shirmp inside with crab on top with thinly sliced avocado. The flavors and textures were incredible. Highly recommend this place for a nice meal. My only issue was with the seating. The hostess had to literally shift over the table each tiem she sat a new couple - we were in a tight area full of tables for two. We came on a busy Saturday night, so I also recommend reservations.",

    "text": "Many of us have probably been to Vegas more times than we'd like to admit.  Heck, one period in my life, I made 4 trips there in a 6 week period!  Still paying for that even today.  Vegas is about the latest clubs, the crazy pool parties, and always the massive selection of fine restaurants.  Coming from the SF Bay Area, I've been lucky enough to be blessed with great cuisine, so, going to Vegas to dine is more about trying out new places and checking out the amazing decor of the restuarants.  Despite this fact, oddly, enough, I have been to Sushi Samba 5 times now and counting!!!  This is the only restaurant that I have been to more than once there minus the late nights at the Grand Lux Cafe...LOL.  But, I think that definitely says something.  This place has the top quality sushi and a very rare pairing of Japanese, Brazilian and Peruvian flavors.  I absolutely love the variety of dishes and the friendly and hip feel of the environment.  Just check out the menu and you will know what I mean.  You can do ribeye steak, sushi, oysters on the half shell, porkbelly ramen, Samba cobb salad and sashimi cerviche all in the same place.  Plus, throw in the hip Vegas feel, cool music and presentation and you're in business.  Also, the restaurant is kinda cool to in a way, that it is tucked away from the busy part of the hotel.  Kinda gives you that hidden gem feel.  Anyways, you won't be dissapointed by this place.",

Lara S was our main waitress plus another girl and she was very friendly and helpful in selecting our drinks and menu items.  My wife and I are big St. Germaine liquor fans and we loved the \"Chu-Cumber\" drink.  Also thought the Tempura green bean appetizer with truffle aioli sauce was yummie.  We had a sampling of sushi and Pacific, El topo, and spicy tuna rolls and all was very good.",

The refrigerator-like cold temperature and over-stickiness led us to the disspointment they had clearly been pre-made and sitting in a fridge.  The five sushi chefs literally were not working for the majority of the time we were there....just looking around and chatting.  Food was mediocre, including non-sushi items.  Waiter was not attentive and too busy making really poor recommendations and bouncing around, tending to other tables without checking on us.  Cherry on top was sitting by the bussing station listening to \"#47 needs to be cleared\" and \"#35  is done.\"  Highly suggest another option in a city filled with anything better than this.",

LUNCH  The whole Japanese/Brazilian/Peruvian fusion idea had me curious. That, and if I am honest with myself, I was craving sushi because it's been awhile. Enter SushiSamba for lunch. We were seated promptly at a booth and perused the menu. After some deliberation, I decided on the Samba Strip roll (Maine lobster tempura, mango, tomato, chive, crispy rice, soy paper, peanut curry) and a side of Peruvian corn. The presentation of the Samba Strip roll was lovely, and the lobster claw was filled with succulent meat - as it turns out, chopsticks are the perfect implement for digging out every single morsel of claw meat. The peanut sauce was delicious with a tang at the end that had me coming back for more. And interestingly enough, the Peruvian corn, when dipped in the peanut sauce, was quite delicious. The Peruvian corn itself was wonderful - it has a slightly sweet, tangy sauce on it which complemented the roasted goodness of the corn very well. About the size and similar to hominy, it had a memorable (in a good way) stick-to-your-teeth texture.  DRINKS  The atmosphere becomes more clubbish in the evening and the music gets turned up a notch. We gathered at the front in the waiting/bar area and pretty much took over the couch and chairs there. Our server was great about allowing us to hang out there for an hour or so over drinks. Speaking of drinks, I had an amazing concoction called the Nashi martini (Grey Goose La Poire, shochu, St. Germain elderflower liquor, fresh lychee, passion fruit ). I could have bathed in it, given the chance.",

    "text": "I was in Vegas at the beginning of June for a bachelorette party, and we came here on Friday night before going out. I LOVED this place!! First of all, it's gorgeous. It reminded me of a jungle, lots of dark colors. Very pretty.  Our server was totally sweet. She explained the menu really well and helped me order something I would actually like since I'm not normally a sushi lover. I think the roll I got was the Neo Tokyo. And it was sooo good! Very satisfying flavor, savory and sweet at the same time. A little expensive I thought, but alas.  Considering there were like 15 of us on a busy night, the service was pretty fast. We got our food and drinks in a really timely manner and I didn't feel like we were sitting around waiting that much.  A downside was that I felt as though we were surrounded by creepy men, but that's so often par for the course that I can't fault Samba.    Very fun place. And really interesting bathrooms.",

    "text": "Awful...that's the only word I have to describe our experience at SushiSamba. We had a reservation at 8:30, and we arrived around 8:15. We knew we were a tad early, so they told us it would be a few minutes. We did not sit down until around 9 p.m., meanwhile they sat parties of walk-ups ahead of us. I was willing to overlook this little snafu when we finally sat down, but then we were completely ignored by our waiter. By the time 9:30 p.m. rolled around, we had not ordered, we did not have water, and we did not have a waiter. He finally made his way over to our table, at this point we were starving.  We all got cocktails and ordered, but it really felt like they were off their game since everything took forever to reach our table. I have to think it was a bad night, because this place would be out of business with service like this every night.   The food was okay, we got the appetizer sampler, a few specialty rolls, and skewers. Typical sushi fare, I didn't quite see the fusion aspect. My friend got pretty sick after the meal, so something he ordered did not agree with him.   Overall, horrible experience, I'll never go back and I'd never recommend it to anyone coming in to town. Save yourself the headache and pick almost any other restaurant for a better time.",

    "text": "I had an AMAZING dinner here for my Bachelorette Party! I've been to Sushi Samba in Miami & was happy to be back. The vibe is very upbeat with a club feel & the food is a unique fusion of South American & Japanese...who would of thought?? Our server was Matt & not only was he attractive but he was kind enough to serve us a penis cake with sparkler candles...AWESOME! We heard about their \"secret\" prix fix menu here, so we decided to go with it. Our server asked us a bunch of questions about our preferences & food allergies to gage what type of menu we would receive. It didn't matter because EVERTHING they served us was absolutely great.  Here is a run down of what we had:   -Green Bean Tempura (light & crunchy)  -Shishita Peppers (could eat a pound of these everyday)  -Pork Gyoza (savory with a wonderful sweet potato puree underneath)  -Yellowtail Sashimi (So fresh with a lovely sauce underneath)  -Lobster taco (good but doesn't knock my socks off like the others)  -Rock Shrimp Tempura (ummm...so good cant even begin to describe)  -Chilean Sea Bass & Chicken Teriyaki Skewers served with Peruvian Corn (Sea Bass was like BUTTER, Chicken was OK, couldn't stop eating the corn...think corn on steriods)  -Rolls (We got a variety, don't remember exactly but they were all very fresh)  That basically sums up our heavenly experience at Sushi Samba. Our bill was pretty hefty after all was said & done. But it was totally worth it....I will be back! This time sans penis cake ;) Thanks Matt!!!",

I took my husband here to celebrate his 31st birthday, because he absolutely loves sushi. On top of that, he hasn't celebrated a birthday in while since he spent the last 2 of them deployed in Afghanistan. I mentioned that on our opentable reservation, and they treated us with extra care. The manager gave my husband a complimentary drink and dessert. My husband and I ordered off menu, and decided to do a tasting for $55 a person. Prices can go up depending on how much you want to spend. It was about 5 courses. My favorite was the wagyu beef empanadas, they were so delicious it practically melted in your mouth. The sashimi was delicious and soaked in some sort of yuzu sauce.  The service is top notch, and if you are looking for a unique sushi experience, you have to try sushisamba. It's an absolute must. Trust the chef, and go with a tasting, they know what they are doing there.",

I love how it's served with fresh greens and peas. There are also a ton of shrimp and it's battered to perfection in a spicy mayo sauce. The hand roll was also fresh and delicious but pricey for 1 hand roll. Service was good and it had a trendy vibe. The only thing I didn't like was how dark the bathroom was. I could barely see. Overall, a great place to grab sushi/asian food.  Update: I went here again for lunch and got the miso sea bass skewers with peruvian corn ($17) and el topo roll ($15). The sea bass was a hit. I loved how soft it was but it was pretty sweet. The el topo roll was not good. It had mozzarella on it which was so strange with rice. It was like glue. Everything else here should be good but don't mix cheese with sushi rice.",

I have been to the Sushisamba location in South Beach Miami and this one at the Palazzo was equally as good.  I really love the mix of ceviche and sushi that is on the menu at Sushisamba.  My girlfriend and I thoroughly enjoyed our meal here and it was the start of a perfect evening.  We ordered the tuna ceviche, some spicy tuna sushi, salmon with avocado sushi and a few other items.  The service at Sushisamba was exceptional and the wait staff was very present at an appropriate level.  The headline for Sushisamba if I was publishing a review would be pretty simple and would read \"Great sushi and ceviche!\".  Other things of note include that the interior is little loud and the seating a little tight.  If you are going here for a quiet meal you likely wont be happy unless you come in off peak.  The decor and design of the interior is cool, trendy and hip. My only dig on my visit would be I ordered a caipirinha and it tasted like it was made with sour mix (not great).  Other than that, it was a near perfect experience and I would go back anytime.  Thanks Sushisamba!",

    "text": "upon dining, I was a bit skeptical to see how this would turn out. I've never had Brazilian/Japanese/Peruvian fusion food before.   when I arrived the hostesses Jade and Heather gave me an option to do either a table or happy hour at the bar. happy hour at 12am? why not.   I seated myself at the bar and was helped by Mimi and eric. I was pleased to see how fast they accommodated me and my girlfriend even though the bar was full. I ordered with my eyes (maybe the whole entire happy hour menu) and to my surprise each dish I ordered, with ingredients I've never tried before, were beyond what I expected.   The manager Yaz sent out complimentary dishes because I was a local. love an establishment that recognizes their locals! the bartenders, runners, hostesses, and the manager treated me exceptionally even though I was a first timer here. anyway, long review short. sushi samba exceeded my expectations, blew me away, and impressed.   items ordered: chili mint rock shrimp pork belly sliders  yellowtail tiradito salt & pepper squid samba fries yellowtail taquitos Kobe beef taquitos and as for liquor, the \"caipirinha\"  complimentary dish from Yas, the \"crispy Hokkaido scallop\"   thank you sushi samba for opening for my taste buds to Brazilian & Japanese fusion! sushi samba will not disappoint.",

    "text": "I went here with a Bachelorette party of about 7 of us.  None of us had been here before and didn't know what to expect.  We made dinner reservations, but still had to wait a bit to get our table.  Once we got in... the server was definitely hospitable, gracious, and informative - I only wished I remembered his name to give a shout out. He informed us of the type of restaurant Sushi Samba was, which is a fusion of Japanese, Brazilian and Peruvian.  We all weren't sure of what to get so he suggested we do a \"tasty menu\" which I think was the Omakase (on the website menu).  This allowed us to try the different types of food the menu had to offer.  We let him know what we liked and what we didn't like and he informed the chefs and they brought out a plethora of tasty treats that was enough for 7 of us.  It started off with some appetizers, such as the Otsumani ( an assortment of edamame, tempura green beans and shishito  - spicy peppers.... absolutely delicious!) and an assortment of other appetizers that I can't remember.  We then had a n array of seviche.  After that we had different types of meats on skewers and then topped off the evening with sashimi and sushi rolls.  One thing, we were all in awe of the food , we could hardly remember what everything was.  A huge highlight of the dinner was the yellowtail seviche! An absolute delicious delight.  Another overwhelming mouth watering treat was the Chilean Sea Bass on skewers with peruvian corn.  I believe we also had the Samba Strip roll at the end of the meal which was thoroughly mouth quenching!  We all sat back after the meal and were all very happy and pleased with this establishment and all said how we were going to have to come back there every Vegas excursion we go on.  It is a bit pricey.. but I think the food is worth the $$$$.  On top of all that, the atmosphere was definitely pleasing as well as the music which kept me moving in my seat all night.  This place is well worth the 5 star rating and worth the $$$$!",

There was no coffee of any kind, hard to understand in a place like this: in my case, I don't drink alcohol, so I am really looking forward for my coffee with my dessert. Server was doing OK, trying to compensate this and that; about the coffee he brough the \"manager\", a very unpolite bad manners guy, whose only response was: they didn't bring coffee I have to deal with that company, not even \"I am sorry\"... The only things that have not changed are the prices... Not very good to mantain those HIGH prices, and obligated tips in large parties (we were 6, so 20% tip was added regardless of the bad service), I was saying, not very good, especially in this city, were food and service have such high standards.... Even with the great taste of the food there, very unlikely to return there...",

I was expecting loud, but Vegas was a bit more subtle, yet maintained all the vibe.  The seating is interesting as nothing is square and the colors are warm Peruvian and the food is pretty Japanese with a dose of flavors atypical of traditional Japanese foods - like limes and jalapenos.  But my wife and I loved it.  Cerviche with yellow tail was the opener along with roasted duck over a bed a mushrooms (a combo of two menu items recommended by our server), then salt and pepper squid (calamari- esq) and a tuna skewer served with huge corn - unique combo, rice would have been fine with me.  We rounded the meal with two sushi rolls - one with jalapenos, fried onions and a bit of cheese and another fancy hamachi roll.  Delicious, fun, great multi server service.  A great prelude to catching Jersey Boys at Palazzo!",

If you want to have sushi and want to have something different, Sushi Samba is your place.  Ordered the tenderloin.  The waitress said it was about 3 oz.  I didn't know how much was 3 oz but imaging the size of your two thumbs put together and sliced.  Anytime you go have sushi in Vegas expect to pay a lot.  There was two of us, we picked about 5 tapas plates and the bill was $100.  Hot green tea was $10.  So, if you're looking to not get full but have some different tastes, go to Sushi Samba in the Pallazo.",

After seeing a show in the Venetian, we were looking for something light to eat - nothing heavy.  Sushi Samba filled the bill perfectly.   The items that our very knowledgeable and extremely attentive server selected for us were amazing - some cooked, some raw, some were rolls, some were not.  I have to say, honestly, that we loved absolutely everything we ate.  The idea of everything being brought out and shared between us was unique and really fun.  We got to try so many delicious dishes by sharing small plates.  The drinks were spectacular as well.  And to top it off, one of the managers came by our table and asked us if we were having a good time, how the meal was, and told us to let him know if we needed anything because it was his job to make sure our visit to Sushi Samba was an incredible experience.  All I can say is that it was more than an incredible experience - it was the best.  We can't wait to go back when we return to Las Vegas.",

Robata chicken skewer with Peruvian corn was tasty, the tempura green beans with black truffle aioli were bomb, and the spicy tuna rolls and Pacific rolls were very good. I would have liked to see a little more prevalent South American influence, but it's still more unique than your average trendy sushi joint and with good food at reasonable prices.",

OK starting with the Tempura for 14.00 there was nothing here.  Very unimpressed as this was not even enough to share with 2 people.  Seaweed Salad was not good at all.  We just had Khotan two nights before and they had the best Seaweed Salad I've had yet.  Anyways, hijiki, aka-tosaka, goma wakame, wakame, tomato caviar, lemon is what came in the Seaweed Salad it was very weak and lacked taste.   As, for the Yellowtail it was very good and the sauce it came with was great.  Most of my rating comes from this and this alone.  As for lunch itself I got the Samba Sushi chef's inspiration sushi assortments and it was good but, nothing great and for 26.00 it should be great.  Anyways we split up everything and I paid for the Tempura and Sushi and it came to 51.02 for lunch with tip.  The place is nice and food was OK but, would skip for other Sushi options on and off the strip.",

We had a group of twelve people.   Let  me just say the food was fabulous and the service was even better.  The manager was great from beginning to end.  The servers were great.  We asked one to take a picture and he made sure we got a great picture and took several shots at different angles.  The manager set us up with a omakase type of meal.  It was like everyone at the table was saying......THE BEST MEAL THEY HAVE EVER HAD.   Let me tell you we have all  had Nobu , social house   etc.   What we particularly  liked wasoo the variety.   We had all the flavors of the world at our table.   The portions were tremendous....   we had so much left over.   We even had a custom made cake - let me tell you it was the bomb......       (and I don't even like cake). They also made sure all the food came out in a timely manner so we could make it to our show on time.............     I am not easily impressed but these peple really impressed me with the food and the GREAT SERVICE.     YOU SHOULD TRY IT......",

    "text": "This was our go to late night place while staying at the Venetian. We opted to sit at the bar and try their happy hour specials along with a few things off their menu.  I woud HIGHLY recommend the Miso Chilean sea bass, as it was once of the BEST I have ever had. The vegetables that came with it were so tender and delicious, even though I hate Brussels sprouts, the rest were quite good.  The Spicy tuna rolls were really good also, though small compared to other places I've had them.  The BEST vegetable dish I've had in a long time were the Collard Greens in an asian dressing. They were crunchy and filling enough for two. Though, next time I'm not sharing!   Another stand out to me were the Fried plantains. Normally, restaurants cut them thick and serve them with sides of beans and sour cream. I loved that these were cut thin and lightly breaded, deep fried and sprinkled only with some shavings of cheese.   Besides the sea bass, the items we got were only $5-6 bucks a dish and easily can be split by two. This was probably my favorite place to dine while there and probably one of the better late night dining options you have if you don't feel like burgers or sandwiches.  I would have loved to give them a full 5 stars but the bar people were much to slow in not only forgetting to ask our order but forgetting to bring us our drinks after having to ask  three times, while serving those who just sat down right away. Otherwise, the food was fantastic!",

A must order on the HH menu would be the waygu potstickers and the cocktails on the HH menu. Definitely a fun and great place to come for a nice meal. They offer a variety of food from sushi to steak. Definitely a fushion of Japanese and Peruvian. Drinks, food and service are great. Prices are little pricey but again your in vegas so go ahead splurge and enjoy the rest of your night. A great place to start off your night or make time to hit their Happy Hour. Definitely a place to hit up especially if your around that side of the strip or staying in the hotel.",

I will start with our hostess, she greeted us, our party was ready and hungry, so we were seated in a private room hidden in the back if the Resturant..  I ordered the trio appetizer, miso soup, and blue point oysters for starters.. The trio was good.. The truffle sauce made the dish.. Miso soup had cilantro in it, which have it a almost Thai influence.. The oyster sauce was yum stuff with a kick.. I like a kick! For sushi I had the sashimi with the usuals.. Was great quality of fish- did not have rolls since they had tacos, I did the lobster and hamachi.. Wouldn't suggest the lobster again but the hamachi was SOOOO yummy! For dinner we did the Kobe on hot stone experience- while the meat lacked flavor it made up for it in texture- OMG..  Hamachi Kama was Huge! And Sake was so Super Smooth.. Love me some Daiginjo!

The food just kept on coming and it was all amazing.  There was this one dish that I still dream about.  It was a king crab leg opened up with some kind of butter sauce within the shell.  IT WAS ONE OF THE BEST THINGS I'VE EVER TASTED.  I've been to a lot of high end japanese restaurants and this was the first omikase where I was actually happy and satisfied after.    Not only was the food great but the service was amazing.  Isaac our server was always on top of trying to keep us happy (and always made sure we had hitachino or sake topped off).  Also, Rannah the manager was amazing as well.  She took to the time throughout our meal to check up on us and make sure we were having an amazing time.  She even offered us recommendations on how to make the most of our time in Vegas.    We will definitely now be making Sushi Samba a regular occurence at our annual conferences/trips out to vegas",

    "text": "I. Love. This. Place.  I got in late on a Saturday nightbefore a convention, and I was craving sushi. I stumbled upon SushiSAMBA was quickly seated a table. The ambiance is dark, sort of like a night club but with sushi chefs inside. Because it's Vegas, the staff is distinctly beautiful. To their credit, they are all super nice and attentive. A live DJ spun an eclectic mix of songs ranging from hip hop classics, to top 40 and some 80s soft rock ballads. Every track had a great, catchy beat, and I found myself bobbing my head along with it more often than not.  I started with a Red Rice Ale which was absolutely fantastic. It is a pricey 11 oz. bottle at $14 but I loved the flavor. I stuck to a simple chef's choice sashimi and sushi combo which ran for $30. I've seen worse prices and i was definitely pleased with the value once the meal came out.  The display that came out was fantastic and consisted of 6 pieces of sashimi (tuna, yellowtail, and salmon), 6 pieces of sushi (tuna, shrimp, and mackerel), and a cut roll which came with a key lime and hoisin dipping sauce which I thought was really weird until I tried it and marveled and how the flavors complimented each other.  After the meal I had a Yamazaki Japanese whiskey, aged 18 years. Something about Japanese whiskey just does it for me. I had a 12 year Yamazaki a month or two ago but this 18 year whiskey was outstanding. It was sweet and spicy and went down smooth. I am glad I had it neat as I'm sure I would have lost some of the complexity if I had gotten it on the rocks like I usually do.  All in all, SushiSAMBA was an amazing experience. While I can't lie and say it was not bit expensive, I definitely felt like I got my money's worth. I'd love to come back here before or after a night out with friends to share the experience with a group",

    "text": "LOVE LOVE LOVE Sushi Samba!!! Everytime we are in Las Vegas we visit this spot and the food is always so good!!! I would give my review 5 stars but I am giving it 4 stars because everytime we go our servers are constantly up selling to the point it is out of control. We always order a ton of food and drinks and I do understand a few suggestions, but when we tell the server we know what we want and everytime he comes back to the table and suggests something else it gets tiresome. The kicker was when we were in a last week and our server suggested an appatizer, when my husband asked how much that was (he knew the cut of meat was pricey) the server said it was $35 an ounce with a 5 ounce minimum, LOL!!! He would have brought us the over $150 \"starter\" without ever letting us know the price.  Again, I LOVE this place, just wish the servers would lay off the up sell so we could relax and enjoy our great meal.",

    "text": "I want to like this place SO MUCH.  The food that we got was delicious (the sea bass skewers are amazingly soft and flaky, and the black truffle sauce that comes with the fried green beans is TDF), BUT the service we got was horrible.  Our server was fine--she was upbeat and tried to work with our wants, but whomever it was that also talked to us was horrible.    To be fair, we were a large group (about 14 or 15), and understandably it is hard to accommodate such a large group, let alone trying to get our food out at the same time.  Honestly, I could care less if my food came out at the same time as the people I had been sitting with.  Before we could even look at the menus to see what was available a la carte, the restaurant pushed us into this 'tasting menu' that would \"incorporate our tastes as well as some of their classic dishes\"--sounds fine, but in a group of 14 or 15 people who have VERY varied tastes, that is almost impossible to do.  To begin with, some of our group members didn't eat any raw fish, and others were basically only interested in raw fish.  We eventually agreed to this tasting menu just out of an unwillingness to continue \"fighting\".  They tried to appease by sending us some shooters and edamame, grilled shishito peppers, and fried green beans to start.  Great, and thanks, but still not the best service you could ask for at a restaurant like here.   If this rating were about the food only, I would give it 5 stars.  The food really is delicious, and the decor (while strange) goes well with the feel that the restaurant seems to be going for.  The pork in our meat sampler platter was overdone and dry, but two types of beefs that were perfectly cooked made up for it.  The appetizer of some sort of spicy tempura rock shrimp salad was moist with the perfect amount of chewiness and spring; it's spicy, but not in the give-me-milk-to-guzzle-now way.  The sushi that we were served, however, was pretty sub-standard.  I'm sure this was because it had to fall in line with our tasting menu price point (which somehow got haggled down); honestly, I did not come to SushiSamba just to get spicy tuna rolls.. I could get that anywhere.   In short, come here if you're in a small group.  The food really is worth it, many times over.  I'm sure it will be a far more amazing trip than the one I had in a large group.",

I think we've visited this place more times than any other Strip restaurant. Some people may hate fusion spots, but I love them. The food here is consistently good and affordable -- at least compared to other places on the Strip.  If you're just looking for sushi, there are better places to hit up, but with all the other small plate options this spot is a winner in my book.   I'm only giving them 4 stars this time around because there's better sushi out there and my favorite red-headed bartender wasn't there.",

Here's the breakdown of the food that I tried.  Tuna Tataki: Very good. Super fresh. I can't say it was the best that I have had but very close to it.  Rock Shrimp Tempura: This was an absolute favorite at the table. You have to try this! It's like tempura popcorn shrimp covered in a spicy alioli.   Rio Grande three meats: All the meats were good. The dipping sauces made them fantastic. I wouldn't get this again though. Not really great for how much it is.  BoBo Brazil roll: Really good! Kobe beef on top....yum!  Pacific: This was ok. Nothing special about it.   Service was fantastic! There was always someone out refilling glasses of water, beer, and sake and clearing out plates. Very friendly too.",

The tempura was amazing with this black truffle alioli that I wanted to drizzle on everything!  Then came chicken gyoza, which was so tender on top of pumpkin puree. Before we knew it they were bringing out rolls, one tuna and one with fresh crab. I was starting to feel full, when all of a sudden came the miso sea bass and beef tenderloin skewers. They were served with this peruvian corn that I haven't been able to stop thinking about since.The kernels are the size of quarters!  And I didn't even get to mention the nice cocktail list until now, so you know the food was good.  All in all it was one of the best meals I've had in a really long time. They also had a similar sized spread for my friend who is a vegetarian and graciously agreed to go with us.",

There's never been a reason for me not to write a review but since I've been actively writing format of my other jaunts I figured its about time to do it here!    Anyway, I usually spend my time at the bar.   Personally I think it's the best place to sit back, enjoy great sake and have a fine meal while engaging with others.  Plus, I have absolutely NEVER experienced a moment of bad service in the two years and 15-20 times a year I've been to Samba.  Everyone behind the bar is always incredibly friendly, and though the faces change occasionally, it's always a pleasure to see the usual staff.  They always have a friendly smile and engaging conversation, obviously not for long as they have their work to do and other customers, but I see they treat everyone around the bar like family.  No wonder why I keep coming back!    My last visit was Saturday March 2nd and I had a guest with me.  As always the service was outstanding and the ladies behind the bar went above and beyond to make our night special.  The food as always was fantastic!  We ordered the Kobe hot rock at the bar with thinly sliced Japanese A5 beef and cooking sauces, fun and entertaining tools your own special little treats.  We also hade surf and turf tacos as well as some amazing King Crab legs.  My date had a great time and we enjoyed a wonderful sake pairing with our meal and I enjoyed a great night of which I hold everyone working that night partially responsible. :)  Needless to say, I recommend Samba to anyone who wants to have a good time, good food, and great service!  Do what I do, sit at the bar, enjoy the people watching, and get to know your bartenders.  They are awesome!",

    "text": "My first impression of a Japanese-Brazilian-Peruvian combo restaurant was skeptical at best. When I eat sushi, I want it to be from a traditional sushi restaurant, or so I thought. Came here with a group of 6 other people and we decided to go with the tasting menu, where the chef brings you out his favorite selections based on a pre committed price per head. For $120/person, we got about 7-8 courses of food ranging from ceviche tacos to a ginormous platter of sushi. As part of the course, you also get their signature hot rock with wagyu beef which was absolutely amazing. Super fatty and soft with 3 different types of salt/seasoning and 3 different types of dipping sauces. They claim to have the largest selection of sake in Vegas to choose from so of course we ended up getting several bottles of to pair with our meal. They're also known for their caipirinha cocktails here but if you don't want a whole cocktail, you can also get little shots of the drinks to start off your tasting course. Very sweet and limey, it's like drinking margarita mix without tasting any of the liquor. Delicious!  Overall, loved my visit to SushiSamba and can't wait to come back!",

SUSHISAMBA is located tucked in the restaurant area of the Palazzo/Venetian...I'm surprised it wasn't busier for a Wednesday night but lucky is! My mom and I got a seat at the bar. The happy hour menu is great and gave us a chance to sample a few items. The yellowtail taquito was yummy, as was the pork belly slider. Based on all the reviews I had to try the Chilean sea bass skewers and they did not disappoint! Melt in your mouth goodness, and the Peruvian corn as an accompaniment was a'plenty (and equally mouthwatering). While I'm not quite convinced the two skewers were worth $29, it was definitely a nice vacation treat!   Service was great as well..the manager came by to ask how our meal was, and the bartenders gave us a couple complimentary tasty beverages.   I would def come back again with a group before a night on the strip!",

We were told we could order items we usually like elsewhere and they would make it or from the limited fusion sushi items on menu (think this may have been a menu for the holiday season as I had seen a sushi menu online prior to arrival). We ordered a lima sushi roll, 10 piece omakase and yellowtail tiradito.   The tiradito came out pretty quickly and was delicious, great start for the food. 20 minutes later and still no more food was out, our drinks were finished and waiter had not even come past to ask if we wanted a refill.

It's fun to try a few dishes here and experiment a little. Lettuce wrapped scallop, oysters, anticuchos... Amazing...",

Made to order steak over bed of sprouts, carrots and mushroom and topped with truffle. Veggies disappointed me a bit but flavor was good and the way it was served kept the meat hot/warm for a long time.  Good service.

    "text": "Stopped into Sushi Samba during CES for a bite to eat. I figured that since I'm on the road I might as well take advantage of a nearby sushi joint to see if it was any good! Overall I was pretty satisfied with the rolls I got and the options they have on the menu - albeit it is way overpriced for the quality you receive. I did a few maki rolls, and a few items of nigiri. The eel, and uni nigiri were excellent - great flavor, very fresh - no complaints there - they were excellent. The maguro or tuna nigiri was just okay - the fish having that consistency of being fresh... but not all that fresh if that makes any sense. The two rolls I got were fine, nothing to write home about (one was tempura shrimp), the other was yellowtail and scallion. The rice was a bit clumpy and sticky, and the temperatures of the rolls didn't match what you'd want from excellent sushi.   Overall a great place and I'd happily return... if half price given the quality of the sushi. I spent about $45 as a solo eating here so expected to empty out for some 4/5 grade sushi :)",

So after many hours walking we decided to stop by for a late lunch  Something I live about Sushi Samba are their creative dishes which extend to mock tails that the kids can enjoy so they enjoyed creative concoctions with muddled berries, mango and topped with flowers. I generally hate cocktails but do like their martini especially as they use lychees, one of my favorite fruits.  Their food is exceptional - we enjoyed an amazing rock shrimp tempura dish, the tuna tataki which was outstanding, edamame and several different roles including a signature Asevichado - all were fresh and delicious. Every bite was eaten.  The only reason we did not give it five stars is service fell a bit towards the end - a ceviche dish never arrived though we realized we had enough food so in all fairness did not request it again - and the kids wanted drink top ups but the offer came so late we decided just to skip another round. Gifted the waiter was very nice and food was expedited.  It is a great restaurant with so many different choices but each one delicious. On previous visits we have also enjoyed their full dishes such as ramen which are also superb.",

My eggplant dish lacked flavors. But the quality of fish was pretty good. Also, the service is top notch.

Our waiter explained to us that we could order a la carte or he could create a dining experience specifically tailored to our taste. We chose the latter and I'm so glad we did.   We started with the yellowtail tacos which were amazing! Then with the sea bass skewers which again were amazing but what really stood out was the A5 wagyu. OH MY GOODNESS. It was outstanding! The beef slices were paired with different sauces and seasonings so each bite could be a different one. It really was incredible. That was followed by multiple rolls and it was a nice light finish to our dinner. We then decided on the donuts for dessert and it was sooo worth it. It was rolled in cinnamon and sugar and filled with yummy chocolate. The donuts were topped with this incredible ice cream made in house. I can't wait to come back here. I love love love this spot!   I highly recommend letting your waiter take over and do the ordering and instead, you just sit down and enjoy the culinary experience while sipping on a fabulously made Caipirinha.",

    "text": "Located in the top floor of the Palazzo Hotel, Sushi Samba is a contemporary Japanese-Brazilian fusion restaurant. Because it's located in the hotel, expect higher quality and prices.   First impression: love the modern decor-Brazilian graffiti Japanese inspired art, with large structures lining the entire restaurant. I appreciated that the table settings were on-point. Very nice ambiance.   Menu: One page-easy to read and stays within the $$$ range depending on what you get, for a full meal. Everything is pretty much a la carte.   What I got: I wanted to try something new, so I got Raw Oysters. Instead of offering a plate set, Sushi Samba offers 4 different types of oysters by the piece. So I get one of each ($19). I also got one piece of Uni Nigiri ($9/each). Everything I got was super fresh and mouth-watering. I wanted to savor every bite.   What my friends got:  1) Small plate of Pork Belly in Sweet Miso sauce ($11) and Japanese rice ($7) 2) Large plate of Steak with Japanese rice, assorted roasted potatoes and 3 sauces ($45) 3) Rolls: Yellowtail/scallions ($10), Eel/cucumber ($10), Specialty ($12), Shrimp tempura ($10), Salmon/Avocado ($10) 4) Robata Ribeye Steak with assorted roasted potatoes ($35) 5) Shrimp tempura hand roll ($10) (Not-pictured) (simply only includes shrimp tempura?!)  Everyone enjoyed their steaks, perfectly cooked medium-rare. Potatoes were seasoned well. The small plate of pork belly was super small, like bite-size. Sushi rolls looked filling due to a lot of rice. Fish was super fresh.   Overall, unless you can spend $$$-$$$$, you're left super hungry. My friends ordered a lot, which was double what they'd normally spend on sushi or food in general per person. I tried to stay within $30 trying something new and rare. So I think mine was worth the experience. But I'm still left super hungry. At least you know everything is of high-quality, but for a price.",

Once you go up the escalator turn around and walk through the shops there to the back area.  One of the places I always go to when I stay at the Venetian. They have a separate gluten free menu (and other dietary restriction menus) and it is great to see all the options available in one place, and there are a lot! They even have gluten free soy sauce. We've only eaten at the bar, we like that it is half in the restaurant and kinda half out of it, so you can enjoy the food and drinks but with a little more calm. I really love the gluten free snow crab roll. The bartenders have always been fantastic, really nice and friendly.",

    "text": "I'm going to have a hard time writing this review, I really am.  I originally tried a piece of sushi from here at the Epicurean Affair a few years ago and it has since been the best piece of food I have had at that event.  Knowing this place is expensive, I had put off going here but after a few years could not wait any longer.  It was my friend's birthday and I had to do it.    We went during happy hour so we could at least have some cheaper options although we saved our main meal for the restaurant.  We sat at the bar (the only place you can get HH) and ordered two Samba Juices, A5 Wagyu gyoza, Yellowtail tiradito (what I had at the Epicurean Affair), and Yellowtail taquitos.  Everything was ridiculously good.  The gyoza was the best I've had by miles and miles.  You could actually taste the meat and it just melted.  The tiradito was amazing and the sauce that accompanied it was beyond perfect.  The taquitos, although not technically taquitos, were superb but really messy as they were too big for one bite and fell apart really easily upon eating them.  After this exceptional experience we were seated at out table where we learned that the menu consisted of small plates that were meant to be shared.  Of course it was lol.  We ordered shishito peppers, more gyoza (they were kind enough to add an extra piece so we both got an even share), miso-glazed Chilean sea bass, a new Tokyo roll, tuna sashimi, and two ice cream balls (that were served for free for my friends birthday).    The peppers were good when they had a lot of salt on them otherwise they were just ok.  The sea bass was incredibly tender and juicy and was served with delicious vegetables and an amazing sauce but I feel like it needed a bit of salt.  The Tokyo roll seemed like a standard roll with really good fish.  It had very simple but good flavors.  The tuna sashimi was marinated in honey and that really came through.    None of the food was bad.  Some of the food (the yellowtail tiradito and the gyoza) were some of the best bites of food I have ever had and some were just ok but mainly for the price, I can't justify giving this place 5 stars.  I would love to come back and try everything on the menu but I don't really see that being a possibility.  I will be back for HH because even though it was still expensive for what you got, the price was severely reduced from menu price and I could occasionally swing that, especially for the tiradito and gyoza.",

    "text": "Sushi Samba is in the Grand Canal Shoppes at The Ventian Hotel on the Strip. The food is great, but absurdly priced. Nonetheless, I do think this is a eatery deserving of 5 stars because of the food and service.   If you want some good sushi at a fair price, keep walking. If you want a fine dinning experience, keep waking. If you are willing to pay, really more than you should, for great food and service in a convenient location, have a seat, your server will be with you soon.  Everything on the menu is fantastic, from the tuna to the shrimp tempura. Their steak is cooked to perfection. The service is fast and friendly. They know the menu well and can guide you if you like.   Sushi Samba, as part of the Canal Shoppes, is very pretty, but it is not even close to a fine dinning restaurant, yet that is what you will pay. Be prepared to spend $100 for 2 for lunch. Despite the lack of the whole fine dinning show put on in other eateries, this place is just really great. I assume their rent is outrageous and one of the reasons for the pricing. Because of this, I give them a pass on the cost of lunch in a \"mall\". The sushi at Sushi Samba is as good as any fine dinning place you will find in Las Vegas and you don't have to dress for dinner, so have fun.",

The Yellowtail Cerviche one of the best dishes I had eaten, and fair priced compared to Nigiri, which was a first for me, served only one piece per order.  The nigiri was good, but not worth the total of $100 for lunch, for half the sushi I get otherwise.    And if the prices weren't so high, the Construction noise next door made it miserable.  How they could not give food away to sit in that tumult is beyond me.  It should close, or construction hours should be limited ... it's just outrageous to offer this type of experience at the high dollar this place.  The service staff was excellent, and clearly this is a management issue, or landlord issue that is going to impact this restaurant for months.  Can't recommend it, with so many other places on par with it in LV.",

We had the following:  - Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza - kabocha puree and su-shoyu dipping sauce - beefy goodness, sauce was delicious l  - Salt and Pepper Squid - dry miso, shichimi, sea salt, crispy garlic, smoked soy - fried perfectly, love the seasoning on top  - Yellowtail Crispy Tacquitos - served with spicy aji panca sauce and fresh lime - fresh, textures were well played, it was well balanced with the lime  - Sea Bass Miso Skewer served with Peruvian Corn - sea bass was nicely flavored, and the corn was highly addicting  - Mushroom Tobanyaki -  poached organic egg, wild japanese mushrooms, garlic chip - flavorful and delicious, I can drink gallons of this!  - Japanese Wagyu Ishiyaki - hot stone, dipping sauces, vegetables - beef was good, lots of sauces to play with, but for me, all you need is the beefy goodness, no sauce  - Yellowtail Sashimi - jalapeno and lemongrass - fresh and delicious, they didn't give us jalapeno, but pepper instead  - El Topo Roll - salmon, jalapeno, shiso leaf, red onion, fresh melted mozzerella, crispy onion - something different, delicious though   - Lima Roll - shrimp tempura, spicy king crab, avocado - basic roll, nothing special  - Neo Tokyo Roll- bigeye tuna, tempura flake, aji panca - did not care for this roll  - Sao Paulo Roll - scallop, masago, red onion, tuna, salmon, shrimp, whitefish, avocado, truffle, hacho miso soy, chimichurri - this roll was okay, nothing special   Overall, the dishes were good, the rolls were just mediocre.  Would definitely come back for their small plates.",

We loved everything we got so I'd highly suggest getting these: -wagyu beef gyoza  -yellowtail taquitos -rock shrimp -Sea bass skewers !!! -Samba strip roll  -salmon tiradito  -samba split dessert   Pretty good amount to split among 3 and not be super overstuffed. Bill came to $147 ! I've been dining everywhere in Las Vegas the last few days and this is def one of my faves and I'd def come back!!!",

    "text": "Probably my favorite restaurant of all time.  You can come here and have an unforgettable dining experience.  Sushi Samba has an eclectic menu with choices you never would expect. And it is all perfect.  From start to finish, everything is amazing.  From the spicy edamame and crispy green beans to the yellowtail tacos and wagyu gyoza, your palate will thank you!  I had the best salmon sashimi in my life as well here.  Oh! The Chilean Sea Bass was absolutely incredible as well.  And to top it off the wagyu beef on the hot rock was like butter.  Just incredible.  You are not going to come here and get off cheap but you will have one of the most incredible dining experiences of your life!  Our bill was about 700 dollars but it was worth every penny.  So if you have nice run at the black jack table, put a few chips in your pocket and head to Sushi Samba for dinner.  You won't regret it!",

We walked up to the desk and got seated at the bar right away. Orders were taken and I did not have to wait long for my ramen.

None of us had ever been and as we're looking over the menu the waiter comes up and suggests collect the menus and just have the chef send us wonderful food. Seriously? Yeah, just a few questions, how much do you want to spend per person? What do you like or not like? Are you okay eating raw? Do you like spicy? He asked each person and viola! He started bringing the most incredible and wondrous array of foods! It was an endless array of sushi, much of it non-traditional styles and flavors representing a fusion with Brazilian and Peruvian cuisine. I don't know what I ate because I didn't order it, but I can tell you every single things was wonderful and a few of the items are among the best things I've ever eaten. The service was fantastic, with this unusual style of service the food came at a steady pace, there was a great variety, and everyone was pleased with the meal.",

    "text": "Though both my friends Philip and Clint gave this place 4 Stars, Clint said, \"there are better places to hit up\", and I can add to that, \"at a far better price\".  I give it 1 Star, for the trendy and fancy atmosphere, and members of the staff, that did their best to be accomodating. That's it.   Like my friend, Philip, I've eaten  Sushi in many cities and many places, including Japan, In my opinion, wheather you are a visitor or a local, you can do a lot better (See my review of Jjanga).  I am used to sitting at a Sushi Bar, and interacting with the Sushi Chef, who is usually from either Japan or Korea. One that observes the traditions and honor of the art. This place is not the case. When you \"yell out\" your order to the Sushi Chef, you are virtually ignored, and told, you must give your order to a Server. So, what is the point of a Sushi Bar, if you can't enjoy the traditions of inter acting with a Sushi Chef?  My host, my previous employer and business partner, was buying. For that I am glad, because otherwise, I would probably have not gone to this place.   The quality and presentation were similar to other \"trendy\" places you would find in the Las Vegas tourist zone, and the trendier parts of Los Angeles and New York. Honestly, it was not nearly as tasteful, or satisfying as several \"local\" places, situated \"off the Strip\" in this town.   I walked out hungry enough to eat a full dinner less than two hours later, and my gracious host walked out with a charge to his credit card close to $300, for three people,  for a \"piss poor\" experience, a bottle of Voss Water, and a cocktail for his significant other.    So here's my take. If you're a guy on a date with a very \"hot\" looking girl, or \"dime piece\", and you're setting the mood for a \"table at the club\" later, and plan on a \" night to remember\" and tell your buddies, this is a good bet. Looking around the place, I observed many a flashy couple that would fit this scenario.  If you want to enjoy a really good Sushi or Sashimi Dinner, that will leave your taste pallet satisfied, and leave you money left over to enjoy a \"night to remember\", than I suggest you drive outside the Las Vegas Strip, and dine in a spot frequented by \"locals in the know\".",

And hey, you're in Vegas, and you can't be cheap in Vegas.  When ordering, you have two options: order off the preset menu or let the chefs create a sampling for you at the price you want.  Because this restaurant is a fusion of mainly Japanese and Brazilian, they have many different chefs creating many different things.  Although I tried both, I prefer choosing from the preset menu. This way I don't get something I don't particularly enjoy.    Out of what I've tried so far, my favorites are the Sao Paulo roll, the sea bass antichucho, and the garlic butter scallops.  The Sao Paulo roll is a wonderful combination of scallops, tuna, salmon, yellowtail, shrimp, red onion, masago, avocado, truffle (!!!), and chive oil.  The sea bass has a miso glaze and comes with Peruvian corn.  The scallops are a bit more special because they aren't on the menu.  But they're basically their Peruvian bay scallop on a half shell, smothered in this delicious garlicky butter reduction.  Can't wait to come back and try some other things on the menu!",

The Chilean sea bass is one of the greatest entrees I have ever had.  The service was impeccable and extremely knowledgable about the nuances of the menu offerings. Great ambiance for small tables and large groups alike.",

Our waiter was friendly and knowledgeable and when we sat down gave us drink recommendations and said that they are known for building a menu for the table to share. I opened the menu briefly and we decided we would trust him to choose our meal. He said he would keep it around $50 per person, which he did and the food was delicious!! All of it!! We had green beans, hot peppers, and edamame to start followed by salt and pepper squid and some tacos (don't remember what was in them). Next was a giant plate of sushi and finally a dry rubbed New York strip steak, scallops and Chilean sea bass (probably the best I've ever had), and a bunch of sides. We loved all of it!! The only thing that was a little slow were the drinks, but overall a really great experience! I look forward to trying the one in NYC!",

Our server Carmine came over to the table, dropped off waters with his manager and then disappeared for 30 minutes. There were three tables in the restaurant and he was no where to be seen. Where the heck did he go?! He eventually came back and took our order, we got our meal and he dropped off the check. There were five of us and we wanted to pay separately. He walked back to the table, stopped and looked at us then tried to hurry away. As he was hurrying away he looked back at us and immediately huffed and puffed 'ughhhh'. Then he said '''Who's going to help me split this?'. We thought he was joking until he told us that if we wanted it split someone had to do it. My friend got up and went to the micros POS and he asked her to split it. She ended up splitting the check for him. Can you imagine if she didn't know how to use the pos system? Never throughout my time bartending would I tell someone they had to split their own check on the pos. After she split the check, he said he had to get a manager to print them which is ridiculous. Anyway, he drops the split checks, we pay with our cards and then he comes back and drops them in a pile. He then proceeds to tell us we have to leave the signed copies in a pile separate from the check books. On top of it all the table next to us wanted split checks and he had no issue doing that, probably bc my friend taught him how to.",

Ordered their steak and it was cooked just right and very tasty.  Their sushi rolls were very good as well.  If you have young kids, I wouldn't recommend this place because it can get quite loud from other people sitting next to you who may use profanity and your kids may hear it.  Seems more suitable for the younger crowds, but I\"m still giving them five stars for everything else.",

The scene and ambiance are remarkable and lively.This restaurant has a very fun and unique menu. They put a fun spin on Japanese cuisine by mixing it with Brazilian flare.The friendly staffs was amazing, even the manager JASON PIETRANTONI who was very knowledgeable, professional and attentive to our needs.The food was delicious.I recommend the green bean tempura with truffle aioli, the beef and yellow tail taquitos are AMAZING!! The Sea Bass melts like butter in your mouth.It is just fantastic.Great flavour  combinations and presentation on all the courses we ordered. It certainly lived up to our expectations.   I highly recommend this place for anything from a ladies night, to a family dinner, to a romantic evening out, to a birthday dinner with a large group of friends.",

    "text": "Food is good. Prices are NOT.  - Seabass: $29 miso glazed and pretty freakin delicious. Cooked perfectly also. But the portion was probably 3 maybe 4 bites at most.  - Handrolls: We had salmon skin, salmon and avocado, spicy tuna, and yellowtail. The ingredients were fresh, but the rolls were very small and about ~$8-$10/each.  - Various rolls: We tried the Yamato ($19 for 3 pieces). There wasn't even enough for me to get a chance to try it since there were only 3 pieces LOL, but my friends said it was probably the best roll there. Pure decadence being topped with foie gras, caviar, and gold flakes. We also tried a few other rolls for which I can't remember the names (SORRY!) but they had wagyu beef and another had maine lobster. Both were interesting, but I wasn't blown away.  - Nigiri: Fresh but again, extremely pricey! $5-$10 a PIECE! Yup, not an order of 2 pieces...that price is PER PIECE! O_o  - Sides: We ordered the corn and plantains at $7 each. The corn was delicious but a very small portion in a cup. Same thing with plantains. Grilled deliciously but only a few slices for a whopping $7.  If you haven't gotten the undertone of my review yet, it's that this place is EXPENSIVE! LOL We each paid roughly $50/person and no one left feeling full. It wouldn't have been so bad had the service been better though. We were missing a few things at the table and had to ask several times for it (place setting, water, and soy sauce dishes).",

We got the mushroom tobanyaki, sashimi ceviche, samba strip rolls, salmon sashimi, otsumami assortment, sea bass robata, pork belly robata, duck breast robata, and the rio grande. The Otsumami, rio grande, mushrooms, and rio grande are definitely worth ordering again. I would not get any of the sushi. Samba strip wasn't anything special, and for 4 bucks per piece of salmon sashi, it's not worth it. I've had better, and these pieces were smaller. Duck breast was probably the only thing I wouldn't order again. There was a certain taste to it that I just don't hate. I haven't figured it out yet, but I know I don't like it in any of my foods. So that could just be a personal preference. The seabass was okay, wasn't really good, nor was it really bad. There didn't seem to be anything else on the menu that we really wanted to try, so we just reordered the rio grande, lol. The picanha was my favorite on there.   The waitress came to check up on us fairly regularly, and was helpful helping us decide on what to order.",

Good selection of fusion foods (Japanese/Brazilian?/Peruvian). Service was top-notch, the server walked through the menu with us and also told us about the set tasting menu. Really detailed and made sure we had everything we needed. Water and plate removal was efficient. Atmosphere was good, food was also quite good, but perhaps because it was fusion it wasn't all that memorable to me. Had the sea bass skewer, which was alright - the peruvian corn was harder than I would have liked. The yellowtail taquitos were good and the flavour/seasoning was nice. The waygu gyoza had a nice meaty flavour, but was not as crispy as I expected it to be. The staff was also really helpful with setting up a surprise for our party. The churros were delicious, but a little softer than I would've liked.",

We did the \"tasting\" where the waitress asked what we liked, what we didn't, and just brought tasting portions of dishes for each of us to try based on our answers. It was phenomenal. Everything we had...I loved. I dreamed about it! Ok...maybe not dreamed about it, but I promised myself that next time I was in Vegas, I would be back (especially since first food & bar closed in the Palazzo, that was my favorite).  So, a few months later, I made my way back, this time for my sisters birthday. Since there weren't as many of us, we decided to go for lunch. I got my 3 favorite things from before - the wagyu potstickers (AMAZING - the pumpkin puree is fantastic, I want a jar of it. It's creamy and sweet but not out of place), the mushroom \"stew\" like appetizer (sorry can't remember the name!) with the \"kobe\" beef skewers, and the sea bass skewers (definitely a highlight). Aside from that, we got a couple sushi rolls and edamame. The rolls we got were recommended, and I must say, none of them wowed me. They were all just OK. The fish was fresh, but the flavors just didn't mesh as well as anything else (hence the deduction).  All in all, I do like this place a lot, but I would stick to the robata/brazilian/peruvian side of things, not so much the sushi!",

But, the great news is, they DO have delicious vegetarian options! I quit drinking and even their mocktails were mouthwatering! I had the Watermelon Mojo and really felt like having no alcohol was a-ok! It was so sweet and so watermelon-y. They could have just kept filling my glass up, but thinking about the sugar content gave me pause. So, I had one. It was all I needed to know that their mocktails are FAB!  For appetizers we ordered the otsumami. It was good a combination of edamame, green bean tempura and shishito and I couldn't stop eating it! Really perfect size for a group (unless you have someone like me who hoards it for themselves, then, problems). The green beans were like never ending. I put one in my mouth and then another and another, breaking every now and again for the shishito, which is sweet (but spicy) peppers. Man, I could have eaten that for days.   This time we just ordered two rolls. Because one wasn't vegetarian I didn't partake, but as with all things SUSHISAMBA, it looked delicious! The other was the veggie kun and it was really great. The flavors blended nicely (there are a lot of ingredients in this roll) and sort of melted in my mouth. I would highly recommend. I also wish they had more vegetarian options, though this was plenty at the time.  This is my second time here, the first time I had the Yamato roll. HOLY. I was a huge fan of foie gras at the time and to have that on a roll was so decadently delicious that it, right then and there, became my favorite sushi roll ever. I won't ever forget that, ever.   I know Vegas is known for a lot of really great AYCE sushi places, but if you want something that transcends those and gives you a more cultured, elegant, tasteful experience, you can do no better than SUSHISAMBA.",

We asked a lot of questions, regarding the menu, and he'd always gave us his honest opinion - even when recommending the cheaper option.   We had the Kobe beef, oysters, uni shoots, oyster shooters, albacore tacos, and some sushi. I usually eat more but sake really filled my stomach.

Go.  Tease:   SushiSamba is a Japanese Sushi and Peruvian fusion place in the Palazzo.  Why I went:   My wife and I wanted a late afternoon snack, and sushi sounded good.  We were staying at the Palazzo, so we figured we'd give the place a try.  When:  11/17/12  Food:   Between us, we got the shrimp tempura roll (generic, but pretty much as good as you could get), ume shiso roll (very flavorful), urchin, Spanish mackerel, and king crab.  Everything was fresh and tasty.  The overall menu looked super interesting and something worthwhile to check out in full for a dinner or lunch.  We just ordered small things as nibbles.      Service:  Very good.    Hints/Final thoughts:  SushiSamba has enough interesting items on their menu to make it stand out.  Additionally, they do just enough traditional things to please some more hardcore sushi fans.  This is a fusion, so expect it in almost everything.  But the tastes are interesting and the food is fresh.",

The  rolls were excellent, fish was fresh, and the presentation of the food was great.   We loved it and can't wait to go back.",

On this particular visit, I joined her for lunch and we grubbed.  She ordered 4 orders of Unagi (Eel), $4 ea. I ordered some Edamame, $6 and the Seared Wagyu Beef, $18.  The Beef was awesome and while it's a small plate, it's very rich and fulfilling.  TBH enjoyed her Unagi....it's her fav.  We ate lunch at around 3 pm, which is a great time to do that because it's between the busy lunch and dinner hours, so there's not too many people around.  When it gets busy, it can get crowded.  We'll definitely be back.  Return Factor - 90%",

The iced green tea was very good and I was glad to see the lime slice that was perched on the glass. The tea was very nice and defiantly a matcha.  The roll of course was yummy, ordered The Green Envy roll and it was amazing. A beautiful combination of tuna, salmon, asparagus, wasabi pea crust, aji amarillo-key lime mayo. Amazing and sculpted like fine art.  Again...this place produced wonderful perfect sushi.   This time the service (at a table) was attentive, but she was not super friendly. Not there for chit-chat, so that's fine :)  All and all if you want top notch sushi rolls go here. Fabulous quality fish with a fusion twist.",

We were a party of ten for a bachelorette weekend and they were able to accomodate us with no problem. We each ordered a roll and it was served on a huge platter for us to share amongst each other. I ordered the dragon eel, and it was a good size, well wrapped, and so very delicious! I also tried the tuna hand roll which was on point as well. The dress attire is casual but like anything in Vegas the decor was fancy! Good for a large party, prices aren't too outrageous, and I will definitely return. They even brought my sister a cute chocolate dessert with \"Congratulations\" written on the plate!",

We got in late Friday night so our nice dinner options were slim since we had limited time and getting anywhere outside your hotel takes 20 minutes - that is once you're in a cab.  We were staying at the Venetian so decided to trek around in our Vegas attire and find a spot to eat. Low and behold Sushi Samba, serving dinner at 11:30pm.   I've been to Sushi Samba multiple times in NYC but this was a different experience. We opted to do a suggested tasting menu. It was delicious. Everything we had was incredible. The chef understood what we liked and wanted and did an excellent job.   My only issue was that we gave the waiter a budget on how much we wanted to tasting menu to be (they are supposed to make it around that) and she went over by $15-20.  All in all, if you're gonna go to Sushi Samba (wherever) do the tasting menu, it's quite the delight.",

One out of the 9 items brought to the table was memorable - the sea bass on a stick. Oh, and the $8 double shot of espresso that woke me up ;).   Cost our group of 7 over $1K. Not that much food. Outrageously priced and you can get WAY better (more interesting and flavorful) sushi for a fraction of the cost. Nice service and wait staff though. Unless you're rich don't waste your money.

Firstly, our server seemed either stoned or passive aggressive, with a general lack of enthusiasm, so his energy kind of brought us down a little! Second, the food is good but not amazing. The papas a la huancaina were mini fingerling potatoes, which were kinda random and would have been better if served as french fries, in my opinion. Our sushi roll was delicious (La lima, I believe), however, and I should have known better to order more sushi than other choices. Instead, I ordered a seafood dish with dende oil and rice that was literally inedible - super oily and cloying, and had a very starchy, almost bitter taste. Gross - I'm cringing as I write this. My husband ate his butterscotch miso pork belly dish up - since I'm not a fan of pork belly, I passed on it, but he said it was great. All in all, I would go back and go omakase, and just let the chef do their sushi thing, since clearly it is their specialty! I would also want to try the sashimi taquitos, so we will have to try Sushisamba again. Otherwise, they have a cool vibe and it feels kind of like a tropical club inside, and who doesn't appreciate a theme?",

Now that I know about the robata grill I feel we must have missed out on a lot of good options, but each time we went our meal was fabulous. expensive but great. We've tried many of their rolls, of cours ethe different types of ceviche and tiradito, of course! I oculd order ten plates of tiradito. Make that twenty. One year we even celebrated new year's here, and as many other people have noted, people are here to party! They had samba dancers and crazy music and it was wild!  If you areon a tight (but not too tight) budget, I recommend you check the place out for happy hour. They have a selection of house-made cocktails and spirits plus a light snacking menu.",

We started with their appetizer, believe it was tempura string beans with truffle sauce. It was amazing! I highly recommend it! We also ordered their avocado sushi and for dinner I had fillet minion and he had duck with mushroom sauce. Get the mushroom sauce! Our waiter recommended it and it was so delicious.   The staff was absolutely amazing and the service was excellent. Everyone is very knowledgeable about the food there.  This place is fancy so the amount of food you get is small for the price you pay, but it's all about quality here. I didn't mind because I'm not a big water so this place was perfect for me.",

However, the food is that good that I'm still giving it 5 stars.  My most recent visit was with a bachelorette group and it was a big hit. The bride to be thoroughly enjoyed everything we had. We had about 4-5 rounds of shots, I think, and they were amazing. They even accommodated our friend who wasn't able to drink with fun virgin shots! I introduced my Vegas virgin sister to this place and she immediately fell in love with EVERYTHING. The server messed up a lot of things for our special dinner but I wasn't gonna let it ruin the girls' last night.  I spent a lot of $ here but it's worth it, the food is THAT good.",

Just do me a favor and take that guy and hit him on the head.  This place works and they do a fantastic job on tying the cuisines together and finding commonality between them. They do a killer Miso Ramen that my daughter inhaled. Their sushi rolls are great too, they are smaller than what I've experienced at other places but that had them much lighter and easier to digest too. Also I'd recommend to give their Tuna Tataki a shot too.  Staff were beyond friendly and were eager to make sure we are return customers. We will be for sure the next time we are there.  Menu is pricey, but what place isn't in Vegas?",

    "text": "I was here around 8:30, and we were told there would be a two hour wait. Or we could just sit at the bar area with some nice, round wooden sofa chairs (I have no idea how to describe them but they were super comfy) which were first come, first serve. These seats were so comfortable that we wondered why anyone would even prefer a table.  Service was quick, and even though we weren't seated at a table, our server was very, very attentive.  We got the nashi cocktails which were amazing but not too fruity or sweet. We figured that since this seemed like a \"weird\" place, we would try to get \"weird\" things we wouldn't find elsewhere.  We ended up getting a bunch of things:   - crispy jidori egg: which literally looked like a bird's nest and was very savory. the gnocci can come off as a bit too stuffy, but it held the crumbly meal together. the truffle and onion puree was subtle but definitely present.  - seared wagyu: OH MY GOD. there was just so much flavor in each bite, it was ridiculous. the truffle taste was very strong, but just below the line of becoming too overwhelming. I didn't really get the ponzu side... but the mushrooms on the side were almost as good as the wagyu beef. they should probably come up with a vegetarian dish around those mushrooms.  - the sao paulo roll: seemed like a regular roll really, I think there might have been too many flavors at work there that I never really noticed the scallop taste which was a pity.  - the sushi samba roll: definitely comes off as heavy nothing special but it was good. I felt bad that the lobster didn't really shine through on this one...  - edamame: the standard. my coworker who I was with said, \"the salt is really important in edamame.\" and they had salted it well though I'm still not sure what he meant by that.  We also got two desserts: the soy cloud and the donuts. The soy cloud was a cheesecake made from soy milk and cream cheese, but it had the texture of light fluff. It was just so interesting, and we really wonderd how it was done. The donuts were served warm (and generously covered in sugar) with a side of ice cream. It reminded me of the popular korean dessert, ah-chu, which is warm churros covered with vanilla ice cream. The contrast in temperature and texture between the two really made it a joy to eat.  All in all, the rolls weren't that fantastic, but the main courses(?) were both interesting and delicious. And the cocktails and desserts really topped it all off.  At ~$200 with tax/tip, it's on the pricey side, but given the ingredients they use, the price isn't for nothing. Might be back again if staying near the Venetian.",

Sushi is pretty standard medium roll, while the kitchen items are basically half portions of standard dinner fare.  To satisfy late night food needs I got three things, shishito peppers, wagyu gyoza, and their ezo roll.   The shishito peppers were super lemony and spicy, seeds intact. Tasty but I have an okay spice tolerance so I could only eat so much.  The ezo roll is a salmon based roll with tempura and asparagus. It comes with a streak of wasabi mayo which is great with the fish. Good for its price.  My favorite by far was the wagyu gyoza. They were nice with a slight crisp and served on a pile of kabocha puree which was amazing. The happy hour portion is three gyoza, I just wished it was more!",

However, the hamachi tacos use to be better quality fish. You can tell that it's not the freshest. The rock shrimp didn't have enough sauce and it seemed like it was sitting in the kitchen 10 minutes too long.  Overall I'd come back but I think the quality use to be better.

HOWEVER, the experience at this high end restaurant was tarnished by their lack of enforcing dress code and controlling small children. People were allowed to dine in pool attire and the restaurant allowed unsanitary seating at the bar (thong bikini in a fishnet wrap straddling the bar stool). Small children were allowed to freely run around the restaurant playing drums on seats and climbing on railings. Hopefully management will take this to heart so future patrons can enjoy a nice dining experience.",

It's a great place to go with a lot of people so you can try all the different dishes.  Disclaimer. To be honest, our party host  didn't order anything off the menu  but allowed the chef to serve anything he pleased. So, I don't actually know the menu name of anything we ate.",

    "text": "I tell you what, I was a bit skeptical of the 4-star rating here because at first glance it didn't seem like a 4-star type place due to the fusion-y menu and location in what is basically a shopping mall. I was wrong, the rating is well deserved.  My wife and I were tired, hungry, and found ourselves in the Palazzo. We wanted cooked Japanese type food so decided to just check this place out. My wife ordered ramen, I got the chicken teriyaki. We shared a miso soup. All of it was excellent. The chicken teriyaki was maybe the best chicken dish I've ever eaten in a restaurant. The chicken was cooked perfectly, and the slightly less sweet than usual teriyaki sauce they used was so good. My wife's ramen was also surprisingly good for a place that is far from a traditional ramen restaurant.  The service was what prevented this from being a 5 star review. Don't get me wrong, our servers were quite friendly. But they went a bit too far with the attempted upselling of certain menu items and recommendations. I know this is par for the course for any restaurant, but our servers were a bit too aggressive for my comfort. But they were friendly and regularly checked in on us, so it wasn't a huge deal. Otherwise this would be a 5-star review for me.",

    "text": "I chose to eat at SushiSamba because I needed an extra kick in my sushi fix.  I was actually surprised by the Asian Fusion menu, I was not expecting it to work so well!  The decor of SushiSamba, like other restaurants at the Palazzo, are really well decorated and ornate.  The interior had a curvaceous geometric style to it with muted colors which gave a modern approach to the Brazilian vibe they mixed with their Japanese-styled menu.  THE STAFF -  We made reservations a few days before, which is very crucial.  The front desk ladies were very charming and were very polite.  Our waitress, Isabela, was phenomenal in service; and, let us take our time when enjoying our meal.  She did not rush us, she got our orders in quickly and managed the meal quick and neatly.  THE FOOD -   I started appetizers off with their Kumamoto oysters, Salt and pepper squid, and Coco Leite.  The Kumamoto oysters were catched from the west coast of the hemisphere, and were $5.00 each, so I just had to order six of them.  The oysters itself were quite miniature, which I did not mind at first, but I think it's quite expensive for how little we got.  The salt and pepper squid had bold flavors of shichimi pepper and sea salt which was a bit acerbic to the appetizer itself.  The Coco Leite was nothing special, it was literally 90% ice and the rest was juice.  Our entrees came out at the exact same time which looked scrumptious.  My friend had their Samba strip (which is their Maine Lobster), and I ordered their Neo Tokyo (which had bigeye tuna).  I really enjoyed their succulent Lobster, which also came with delectable sushi rolls.  Their menu has a bunch of Vegetarian and Pescatarian friendly foods to choose from.  For dessert, I ordered their Mochi, and my friend and I shared their Yuzu Tart Cheesecake which looked absolutely magnificent.  My Mochi had four very contrasting flavors, and two very homey flavors like cookies & creme, and chocolate.  I really enjoyed the green tea flavor which is my favorite.  My friend's Cheesecake came with a huge sugar sphere with cracker crumbs all around that gave a majestic vibe to the plate.    To recap, we ordered the following :  Kumamoto Oysters($5.00 ea)  Salt and pepper squid ($15.00)  Samba strip ($19.00)  Neo tokyo ($16.00)  Mochi ($10.00)  Yuzu Tart Cheesecake ($13.00) -------------------------------------------------  I would truly recommend coming to this restaurant to dine! It was a great experience!",

Cocktails - Delicious - 4 Stars Food - Delicious - 4.5 Stars Service - 3.5 Stars  We had shrimp & veggie tempura, best anywhere. Lobster roll, just ok, pretty bland. Crab tempura, absolutely divine, only thing is they serve it in a pool of broth and it gets soggy immediately. Waygu dumplings, really good. Churrasca platter, really delicious, especially the spicy chorizo and ribeye.  Some kind of caramel popcorn banana split that I would never think to order turned out to be freakin AWESOME, we ate every bite. Also had some donut things that had a crazy hot filling that burned out mouths quite a lot when we bit into them.   I'd order almost everything again. Would be 5 Stars if service were better....not bad at all, just a bit spotty.  Going back for sure!!!",

I ordered a glass of wine, the Canyon Road Cabernet, a smooth wine.   Hubby ordered a different cocktail called a Caipirinha and it is the national drink of Brazil. He did not like it at all - said it was very bitter. Good choice of sushi...would return. Do watch the bartenders though - we were charged for a drink we did not order.",

We decided to come here, and it was an excellent choice.   For starters, the service was attentive and friendly, all around.   The waiter was happy to provide details on any menu item we asked. We decided to start with 3 rolls. The rolls were elegantly constructed with just the right amount of sauce drizzled on them. The Lima was my favorite, but the Neo Tokyo and Salmon/Avocado rolls were also amazing. There was no reason to dip any of the rolls in soy sauce since they each had just the right amount of flavor on them. We also ordered possibly the best tempura shrimp I've ever tasted, which were the Rock Shrimp.   For curiosity purposes, we ordered the Organic Chicken skewer. The mustard flavored sauce on top of the chicken brought out so many different wonderful tastes. It was definitely a hit.   This place is beautiful! I can't wait to revisit.",

Excuse me, let me order my drink the way I like it. After that she never came back.

It took us at least a half hour to order anything drinks or starters. When she was taking our order she was talking to the other servers at the same time. She was never anywhere to be found except by the kitchen window, which we had a perfect view of, talking and laughing with other servers who were all actually leaving to help their tables during the conversations with her. We started asking questions to other waiters cause she just wasn't there. We left early from our dinner because it was taking far longer than anyone should be sitting there for.  The good, the food was good not the most amazing sushi I've had for the price but good. Fish was fresh and the small plates were tasty. The other staff working were very helpful and always around to help us. Even when the other person at my table spilled something on themselves they went to go get club soda and extra napkins for cleaning up. Hostess was also very helpful and informative about the way ordering worked and the styling of the menu.   I would come back only because it is located in the hotel I stay at otherwise I would never.",

We got their version of an old fashioned and it was amazing. You must try it.   Service was extremely friendly and informative. They will help you wish the menu! No matter what you get you'll be happy. Explore and try new/weird things on their menu because you'll love it all!   Our friend got their squid/calamari and our server warned us it's not traditional but it was the best I've ever had.   Needless to say ask your server what they recommend and try to get 6-8 things from all over the menu. It's amazing and a must visit restaurant when in Vegas!",

It was fresh, beautiful, and so very GOOD. The miso sauce on the sea bass was heaven. I haven't had lunch that good in awhile.  Loved the ambiance as well with the funky but hip decor.

The food here is excellent and there are many dishes that I have never seen at a sushi restaurant before.  The atmosphere is great inside, but is in a more sleepy party of the complex (Palazzo is one of the quieter \"big\" resorts on the strip).  The cocktails could use some improvement. Given the price and the clientele, I think they need to bring in a mixologist to redo this section of the menu.  Last but certainly not least is the service. Vanessa G was extremely accommodating as our server. We came in towards the end of the night and she had a great attitude. Also, the manager Jason P. was awesome. He checked in on us a few times and went out of his way to make my GF's b-day special. Big fan of these two.",

The food never disappoints at either venue and if you are new to the brand I would recommend having the server either order for you or working closely with them to craft your own \"tasting menu\".  The concept of Japanese, Peruvian and Brazilian can be intimidating and unfamiliar to most but you have to just go with it!   We let the manager, Jason P, order for us and we couldn't have been happier! He was super friendly and asked about any allergies and dietary restrictions and got everything on point. We had an assortment of small plates: green bean tempura, edamame, pardon peppers, a spicy tuna roll, some crispy scallop lettuce wrap, assorted taquitos of yellow tail / lobster / crab and mushroom tobanyaki with duck breast. Everything was cooked and seasoned perfectly and the staff even made a point to let us know which items to eat first to enjoy at the best possible temperature. Everyone we encountered was friendly, engaging, knowledgeable on the menus and so hospitable!   To sum it up, Jason P and the whole SS team know what they're freaking doing and I can't wait to go back!",

    "text": "I'm from Los Angeles, so I know sushi, and I grew up in New England, so I know lobster.  It's 1:30 in the morning and we're in Vegas.  We're hungry, and tired and just wanted a good meal.  We found this place on Yelp with good reviews and decided to check it out.  I ordered the lobster robata, which the waiter described as lobster cut in half, grilled, and finished with a sauce.  This sounded a lot like the way lobster is prepared in Mexico and I'm starting to see in other restaurants particularly in San Diego.  So I was excited to have it this way again.  What a disappointment - what came to me was only half a lobster, the size of which could not have been anywhere near a pound.  It was grilled well and the sauce was very tasty.    But seriously, for $25?  If I spent that much back home on lobster, I'd have enough to feed my entire family and still have some left over.  My wife had the Lima, which was very good.  For sushi, it was not like what we get in LA, but it's worth noting that if I ever find myself here again, this may be what I order.  The ambiance looks like Dr. Seuss on acid, but it was dark and cozy at the same time - it is an unusual setting.  The meal ended quickly as they were closing and, after several attempts by the waiter to get us to order more food and drinks, we were given our bill.  As I'm signing my credit card slip, I hear our waiter burst out in a confrontation with three foreign women seated several tables from us who apparently did not know or feel obligated to leave the waiter a gratuity.  The debate got louder, but mostly from the indignance from our waiter.  I'm not saying he was right or wrong - I just think there was a better way to handle that situation.",

The only downside to the experience was that - we all told our waiter what our overall budget was for the meal and to work within those parameters. It seems it was our fault for trusting him when he said he's done this many times before.  Our tabs came out $30 higher per person than what we allotted. Major bummer on our wallets but I never heard our stomachs complain.  You could dine here on a budget and be happy as can be. Or you could rack up a big bill. Your call. Either way you'll have left trying some new flavor profiles and enjoyed some delicious food.",

As we were being cashed out said all was well but didn't but didn't like the rock shrimp and paid. As the waitress took away the food she managed to waste soy sauce on my purse, with no apology. And the. The manager I assume told me if I don't like I should not order the food. I was super take. Back as I had never been there before. He went on to say I do this all the time.

The food is decadent, the service is impeccable, and the decor is sophisticated but unique.  Loved the Brazilian?/Russian? parade they were playing on the TVs.  I liked it. But I'm cheap as hell, so I won't be back unless I'm living on a secure salary.",

    "text": "Modern chic fusion restaurant in the new Palazzo Hotel, featuring Brazilian and Japanese food. The interior much reminded me of Social House in Treasure Island, dark and swanky. The small plates are meant for sharing, but the tab adds up quick. The server proclaimed their sake menu as the largest in the country, but unfortunately we didn't get to try any.  We had the assortment of four sashimi which were nice and fresh with delicate flavors. My favorite was the tuna with granny smith apple, serrano, and lime.  The hamachi kama (yellowtail cheek) was as good as I've had, but missing the grated daikon that it traditionally comes with.  Chicken liver anticuchos (two skewers served over peruvian corn) were very livery. I expected them to be only lightly livery, like my favorite Pho Ga place serves up, not sure if it's due to the prep or the grade of liver or what.  We also tried a couple rolls, the Neo Tokyo with yellowfin tuna, tempura flake, aji panca. I liked this one more than the BoBo Brazil with seared kobe beef, avocado, kaiware, shiso, red onion, chimichurri. The kobe beef looked raw rather than seared, maybe seared would have brought out the flavors a bit. Both rolls were pretty good though.  The standout of the meal was the Berkshire Pork Belly butterscotch miso, which was meltingly tender, with a subtle sweetness contrasting the richness of the luscious pork.  We also tried the little tiny crabs we saw in an ad, Sawagani, which are flash fried japanese river crabs. These were literally tiny, and the small bite had a texture like an egg shell, with a flavor best described as a subtle fish sauce.  Come here if you have an appetite for a variety of small bites with delicate but well thought out flavors.",

They're extremely good. They also have more Sake than Japan it seems. About a 6 page menu to select from. They also have amazing muddled fruit cocktails.   Now, the negatives. As sushi goes, and tapas for that matter, it's slightly pricey. I know it's Vegas, but some things such as sushi just can't go higher than a certain price. The second thing is the fact they have an amazing modern space, but then have a giant screen tv playing football. Why dumb down a hip place. Oh well.",

We pretty much ordered everything, the spicy rock shrip appetizer was tasty and the beef tartar was good too.  Sushi rolls were so/so, nothing special for the price tag. The best part of the meal was cooking or Wagu/Kobi beef on a heated rock. That meat melted in your mouth.  Overall it was nice to try once, but I dont think I'll ever be back, Sushi Roku in Caesars and Okada in Wynn are by far much better dining locales.",

If a restaurants main ingredient is salt, its going out of business, quick. 3.  Its too dark and the ceiling is too high (which makes it too loud). 4.  Too ambiguous.  Let me clarify this.. the name of the restaurant is \"Sushi Samba\"  Alright cool, probably tapas style Japanese food?  Who the hell knows?  EXACTLY!  No one knows!  What kind of crowd do you expect to be in here?  Well, there were families, young couples, old couples, alcoholics, birthday dinners. wtf is this place? pick your target and hit that sh*t.    The only upside from this was that the food came out quick.  Almost too quick.  Now that I think about it, it was probably pre-made and microwaved.. oh and topped off with some sea salt.  BADABING! This place sucks.  Don't even bother reading my review because it probably sucks just like this restaurant.",

The only cons were that they really packed the place with tables so if you want a place where you can speak with your dinner companion without having to speak over fellow diners then skip this place.  Only other con was that the menu has so many options that you really should ask the wait staff to give you a few pointers in how much to order.  Our waitress was dead on in guiding us as to how much to order since many of the plates are small tapa style plates while others are larger.  The sushi rolls we ordered were great as well!

Once there, the overpriced menu and sake list reminded me I was in Vegas, a place that should not have to be this expensive, I mean come on, people are handing money hand over fist at the tables, don't gouge us at the restaurants.  Nigiri was priced per piece at a rate higher than I'm used to paying for 2 pieces.  The rolls were decent, I liked the spicy tuna version they served, a little unique, the eel avocado was good.  My main complaint is that they are a decent sushi spot, nothing extraordinary, and their prices are simply too high.  However, the samba roll, with Maine Lobster, mango and some other delightful flavors that created a party on my palate, bumped them to 3 stars.  Great roll, $19, but that one was special.",

You don't get to mingle with a crowd of people like in their Dromo (Miami) location but you still get to have a hell of a dining experience. The dining room is pretty dark almost like a nightclub, the music is loud and the drinks are strong. So all in all, this is a supper club.  Otsumami is a must to have as a starter. The trio of shishito peppers, green bean tempura and edamame is the perfect way to start over a round of caipirinhas.  After this you can do a round of robata. Filet mignon, lamb chop, chicken, eggplant and seabass, they're all great and some of them come with the huge Peruvian corns which are so tasty.  As for the main course, I have tried their sea bass entree which I loved until I had the Moqueca. The Moqueca is simply the best seafood stew I have ever had in my whole life. It is a medley of shrimp, squid, sea bass and crayfish cooked in a pot with coconut milk and cashews.  Top this with more caipirinhas and maybe a couple of their desserts from their expansive dessert menu and you'll have yourself a great dinner right before you head into an endless Vegas night... You'll have a great dinner in a great ambiance with great music and on top of it you'll have a little bit of a buzz...",

Our waiter was very helpful and made many great suggestions. The food came quick as well even when the restaurant was full.  Food - Great presentation and absolutely flavorful! Nom nom nom! I didn't want to get full so I could eat some more!  Ordered: Sea bass yakitori - This was our first dish to arrive and it definitely set the bar. The fish just melted off. It was cooked well and seasoned perfectly. The Peruvian corn that came with it was good as well. Very robust and large kernels.   Yellowtail ceviche - AMAZING! The lime juice and other flavors blended so well together. This was my favorite dish along with the Sea bass yakitori.   Tuna ceviche - The tuna was fresh tasting but wasn't as great as the yellowtail ceviche. Maybe I got spoiled but I thought the cherry tomatoes and almonds over powered the fish, which too me isn't a good thing because I love raw fish.   Kanpachi sashimi - Nice sliced of fresh kanpachi and jalepeno. Wonderful dish.   Neo Tokyo Roll - It was good but not great. Nothing much more to say about it.   Shrimp Tempura - Very crisp and fresh. Lightly powdered shrimp. Didn't have too much tempura and was not soggy like other places.   Signature Fruit cocktails - Strong but also fruity (meaning I could tast the FRESH fruit flavors). A good strong drink doesn't need to taste bad.   I wold DEFINITELY go again and I am recommending Sushi Samba to all my friends and whoever else is planning on going to Vegas. =D",

My husband and I just moved back from the East Coast and we were really looking forward to some AWESOME West Coast sushi! We arrived around 9pm and were promptly greeted and seated by the  hostess. We didn't like the original seat she tried to give us so I asked her to sit one table in and also because it was a four top instead of a two top (you need room when you order sushi.....you either get tons of little plates or a huge plate that doesn't fit on a two top table). Well that must have frustrated her because she threw the menus down on the table I wanted and basically ran back to the hostess stand. ( yes she threw the menus!) we then proceeded to wait a good 15 minutes before anyone would come over and talk to us....not even give us water. Finally our waitress came over and apologized and we were ready to order drinks and edamame. Our drinks came quickly and we ordered the rest of our dinner with some suggestions from our waitress. Our first to appetizers came pretty fast as well but the waitress for got we wanted edamame so that came later in the meal. The oysters were awesome...the yellowtail with jalapeno was AMAZING.....sushi rolls were good but the rock shrimp tempura was off....taste just wasn't there ( taste not spice.....it was basically no flavor but spicy). Our waitress talked up the mini doughnuts for dessert so we ordered them...only to find out they were out. Our bill was over 200$ and I left disappointed at that price. On a side note the hostess tried to seat 3 other couples at the original table she wanted to give us and all 3 couple asked for different tables.....it wasn't a busy night.....she may want to take a step back and remember she is the first person people see....she needs to represent this restaurant better.",

During my first few visits, I'd dine here for their unique sushi rolls with aji panca sauce (made with Peruvian chili peppers), and especially their tiradito (Peruvian-style sashimi). I would often order the kanpachi tiradito with yuzu, sea salt, black truffle oil, and the yellowtail tiradito with jalapeno and lemongrass -- both absolutely amazing, and unlike anything I've ever had before! I remember the first time I dined here with a friend and we ordered the tiradito. We enjoyed the sauce so much that we each ordered a second bowl of rice just so we could finish the sauce that was left over in the plate and put it on top of the rice so it wouldn't go to waste!   But that was THEN!  I no longer order the tiradito that made such an impression on me. Now, since 2014, it's an absolute must that I visit my favorite sushi chef at SUSHISAMBA, the AMAZING Chef John Um, who creates the most unbelievable, OFF-THE-MENU, omakase-style plates of edible sushi art that I (and most likely you, too) have ever seen! Chef John not only takes pride in selecting the freshest, quality fish for his sushi bar and staff to serve, but the man's work is inspired by art and his incredible plates of sushi reflect this perfectly. He also chooses fish that I have never tried or seen on the menu at any other sushi bar that I've been to. His sushi seems to be influenced by Peruvian tiradito, and often creates unique sauces that he adds onto his canvas-like plates to be dabbed onto each piece of sashimi or sushi which enhances the flavor of the fish. These sauces are preferred to be used in place of soy sauce or shoyu because the fish is so fresh and amazing alone that IMO, the overpowering soy sauce only kills the flavor of the fish!   I \"discovered\" Chef John's amazing edible art while browsing Instagram (@chefjohn -- you should definitely check it out!), and I've posted a couple of photos of the incredible sushi that I've had the privilege to order from Chef John during a few previous visits! During my most recent visit in September 2015, Chef John wasn't there, but one of the other amazing sushi chefs created a sashimi sampler plate for me! I posted that one too. Needless to say the presentation was absolutely stunning as well, and I can't wait to see what they create for me next time I'm there!   *Also, much props to the Bar Manager, Allen, who always creates me the most unique and amazing cocktails that I've ever had ANYWHERE (I've posted photos of these too), and much thanks to his excellent staff of bartenders as well!",

    "text": "The perfect date night spot!  Had a really cool modern ambiance. They had these videos from Asia playing on their TVs and we thought that was pretty interesting. The bathrooms were clean and very modern. 5/5  The hosts that greeted us at the door were all really clean, pretty and professional. Particularly the short Asian girl with the long red hair. 5/5  Our waitress was nice, but she didn't explain the menu to us very well. She could have been a little more helpful because it was our first time there and the menu was a little complicated at first glance. 3/5  The food was seriously incredible!!  Started off with a mushroom appetizer, mushroom tobanyaki w/ kobe, which ended up being a lot larger than I had expected, but I wasn't complaining at all. I had an egg added to it, which was recommended by the host with the red hair. We also got an order of a5 wagyu gyozas and kobe beef taquitos with sea foam sauce. The sauce was a really nice twist to a classic. All really amazing.  5/5  The drink menu was really great. For date nights I like to try specialty cocktails instead of my usual whiskey. I ordered a mango mojito and my boyfriend had an old fashioned. The mojito was a little bit too sweet for my liking but wasn't bad. 4/5  The sushi was well made but I wasn't exactly blown out of the water and neither was my boyfriend. He and I are avid sushi eaters and we love complex rolls with a lot of flavors and textures to them. So the Lima roll and San Paulo roll were both just decent. We could have gone without them. 3/5  Our entrees were really what impressed us. My boyfriend had a Charrasco: Rio Grande  and he absolutely loved it. It was excellently paired with a variety of sauces. I'm not much of a red meat kind of eater but I had a small slice and was fairly impressed. 5/5  I had the large plate of chicken teriyaki. Wasn't crazy about it but I definitely finished the whole dish. It was a little small compared to my boyfriends main dish but it was okay with me since we ordered so many dishes. 4/5  Overall we had a really great date night here and would definitely come back for another one. Loved it",

The sushi is so fresh I felt like I just opened my mouth and it swam right in (is that gross? I don't even know if I care, it's just that good!). Service was great; very thorough walk through the menu. I had the SAO PAULO* roll (scallop, masago, red onion, tuna, salmon, shrimp, white sh, avocado, truffle, hacho miso soy, chimichurri) - the truffle and red onion makes this top-notch, Spicy Tuna (incredibly fresh), and LIMA roll (shrimp tempura, spicy king crab, avocado).  Drinks were tasty (regrettably I don't remember the names, but of the three I tried they were all fantastic). Saw RuPaul dining here my second time. I'm far away from Vegas now and I'm missing it big time and super missing (and craving) SUSHISAMBA. When I go back to Vegas, I will be going back here.",

    "text": "My friend K suggested SUSHISAMBA for dinner... I was trying to look at the menu online and what I could find did not represent the full menu. If you are using an iOS device (iPad/iPhone), you can't see the menu. I was almost dissuaded, but was so glad she talked me into coming here for a drink and checking out the menu!  So, needless to say, great menu, so we put our name in and settled into the bar. The hostesses take your phone number and text you when your table is ready, which is a great option so you're not tied to staying right by the entry waiting for a table.  The bartender was super sweet and made us great cocktails. I enjoyed the Lychee Bubbletail, which was delectable. K had a drink with berries and elderflower liqueur, which was also fab.  K had insisted that the sea bass skewers were amaze balls, so we went with that. We started with two orders (2 skewers each) and sides of the coconut rice and black beans. The beans were tasty, but hard to eat with chopsticks. Coconut rice was fantastic and I could have eaten a whole bowl by myself (but I'm glad I didn't).  Karen's suggestion on the skewers totally delivered. We even ended up getting a third order because they were sooooo good! Melty and flavorful. We even convinced the guys next to us to get an order and they liked it, too!  We finished with a desert that was a chocolate upside-down cake with bananas. It was small, but perfect. Super flavorful, great texture and perfect to share with a friend.  Service was good, but not a standout.   I could basically eat those sea bass skewers every day.   It's a little spendy, but let's face it, everything on the strip is. I'd definitely come back.",

The last few times I've been here there has been a vegan menu which is always a huge plus! Our server on this visit was very knowledgeable and suggested a modification to the mushroom tobanyaki that made it vegan. This was hugely exciting, because this was my other favorite dish as a vegetarian and it was just as good as I remembered! I've had the veggie sushi and edamame on other visits and these have always been consistently great. I also love that there is a soy sauce on every table because it makes the already stellar coconut rice taste even better. They also have a vegan dessert which I have never been able to try since I'm too full after dinner, but another plus for not forgetting that vegans like dessert, too.   I heart you Sushi Samba! Please come to Seattle and make all of my coconut rice dreams come True.",

I'm extremely picky when it comes to sushi and this place definitely deserves 5 stars. The service is always impeccable and it is super clean in here. It doesn't have the fishy smell that most bad sushi restaurants have. The pricing is very reasonable for the location (inside the Palazzo and on the strip). The decor of the restaurant is pretty in-tune with the rest of the hotel and other restaurants - hip, modern, and a little funky. They have great cocktail selection and a full bar, as well as a happy hour menu.   SERVICE: 5 Stars. I've never had a single complaint about the service here. Every time we come here, the service is always consistent and excellent. We celebrated my friend's 21st birthday here with a group of about 20. After ordering countless rolls, plates of sashimi, cocktails and shots, our server graciously brought the birthday princess the 3 Wise Men shots. Doing stuff like this makes you come back because a year later, my friends and I still recant this story and bring up Sushi Samba.  FOOD/DRINK: 5 Stars. Everything is so fresh and good. I usually order Omakase and my favorites seem to be the Yellowtail, Uni, Fresh Ono, and Tuna. The  Tuna Tutaki appetizer is excellent and something I order whenever I come here. For non-sushi eaters, they have plenty of choices. They have a lot of unique cocktails custom to this restaurant that pair well with almost anything on the menu.   You will not be disappointed eating here!",

    "text": "I went here because the hotel complex had few other restaurant options open at 11 PM on a weeknight - and it was remarkably bad - at those prices, and since it's advertised on the room cards, I expected pretty solid food.  The fish on my sushi was simply not fresh enough, nor handled correctly - I felt that their special rolls were just mediocre cuts and quality fish, doused in overly sweet sauce to hide the inadequacy.    The miso soup was bad enough to send back, if I didn't feel too tired to deal with the hassle; it had an off putting smell to it, was oversalted, and was almost exclusively broth - no seaweed, almost no tofu, and a few sliced raw scallions.    Also, expensive, even by Las Vegas Strip standards.  Service was adequate, but barely; they didn't refill my water glass without prompting, and acted a bit surprised / almost rude when I declined to order alcohol, but nothing major.  Potentially, part of my problem was in ordering exclusively from the \"Japanese\" part of the menu, but it does have the word Sushi in the name - why would I expect the sushi to be terrible?",

I wish I could remember all the dishes we tasted, everything was spectacular. We even got a fancy chocolate dessert with white chocolate, dark chocolate and GOLD! It was heavenly. I like that they'll recommend food for you based on your budget and taste. That being said, the prices are pretty high for the amount of food you get, which is why I gave 4 stars. 3 of us ate for $130. But hey, its Vegas. Go big or go home.",

I ordered the yellow tail seviche.  it had a great flavor.  garlic ginger and soy.  :0)  it had a nice spicy kick to it.    also tried the tuna seviche.  this had grapefruit juice, jalapeno, and almond.  this was yum as well.  but yellow tail was way better on my taste buds.  the grapefruit gave it a  too tart after flavor for me.   off the happy hr menu, i had a Kumamoto oyster shooter.  along with a blue point oyster raw. i wanted more, but they are like $3 per oyster.  a bit too pricey for 1 oyster if you ask me.  But its vegas so i had to try 1.  i could have had a few dozen more of those bad boys though.    to drink i had a mojito.  and boy it was yum.  how ever i prefer the mojito from table10 rt next door.",

He gave us multiple recommendations.  we started wtih the Sawagani or River crabs which were okay, but i would skip.  Eating these tiny crabs was like eating a few crunchy crackers with some lemon base coating.  I then had some yellowtail crispy taquitos which were very unusual with some very spicy, lemony sauce.  I would definitely recommend these.  I had the Samba sushi & sashimi assortment, which was very good.  In summary, the sushi and sashimi are very good here.  The restaurant is a little pricey, but not for Las Vegas.  The atmosphere is really fun, and the service is great.  I definitely look forward to my next visit.",

    "text": "If you are NOT interested in being open-minded to an array of fusion tapas featuring Japanese, Brazilian, and Peruvian inspired palettes...then this is place not for you. If however you are interested in being more cultured in regards to your typical sushi restaurant, then you may continue reading.  Sushi Samba is a great restaurant to taste a blend of very unique flavors...the menu is not your typical one but rest assured, your server is happy to answer any of your questions. The server started off by asking us if we've been there before...I have so I said yes. If I would have said now, he would have prefaced our meal with a story of the restaurants background i.e. stylings of food, etc. I know this because I overheard another server doing it.   With any tapas joint it is always easy to over order...and me, my bro, and his fiance did just that. Here is what we got.  -Shishito (grilled peppers): the sea salt adds a great flavor, the peppers themselves are literally grilled - Filet Mignon robata: a small portion of robata grilled filet mignon cooked exactly how I wanted - Sea Bass and Miso swewers: recommended by our server, these skewers were OFF THE HOOK!!!! Melted like butter in my mouth...the miso flavor was out of this world. -Miso soup: the only difference between this soup and the others...they add cilantro -Coconut Rice: the side order of rice could actually feed 2 people. We ordered 2 not knowing this. The coconut flavor is not at all overpowering...I've gotta learn how to make this rice! -Green envy roll: YUM!!! salmon and tuna rolled with some crunchies to make this fine number -Spicy Tuna Roll: not as spicy as I thought it would be but still yummy -Rio Grande (5 meats): this meal on its own came with black beans, collard greens, rice, 5 different meats, and 3 sauce pairings. WOW! You need to order this...there was 3 of us and we couldnt finish but the options were great. The sauces were extremely complementary.  Sure our meal came out to $172.69 pre gratuity for 3 people but for the service, quality and presentation of the food, and the ambiance...the price seems quite fitting.",

    "text": "I came here on a saturday night for dinner to celebrate my 25th birthday with the best of company, fun entertainment, and delicious food!!! I'd been here before but always sat in the front of the restaurant... had NO clue how HUGE this place was!!! We sat in the very back (where it seems many of the large birthday parties were seated) The ambiance of the restaurant is very dark and jungle esque (if i remember correctly o.o) lol very ruckusy and vegas appropriate! There were drummers and scandalous (but h0t) dancers going up and down the aisles which provided for the fun entertainment.  But enough of that, on to the main event.   We had a party of 6 and decided it best to do as our super nice server suggested, omakase style :)  - Cucumber cocktail on the house!!! They brought each of us a mini cocktail to start the meal off! Very nice and considerate of them! nice and refreshing and definitely got my appetite going :)  - A trio appetizer platter consisting of well salted edamame, roasted shito peppers, and deep fried string beans served in the most delicious chipotle aoli sauce (all 3 were delicious but I think my favorite would have to be the roasted shito peppers with a drizzle of lime juice for a nice kick) - Yellowtail Sashimi MINI TACOS!!! These were sooo fun and delicious! Great fushion idea! The restaurant is VERY accommodating, we mentioned to them 1 of the girls is allergic to cilantro so they brought out a special lobster taco for just for her! The flavors were bold and the taco shell was nice and crispy.  But I think I still enjoy DOS CAMINO'S mini tacos better...those are to.die.for.   - Ahi tuna over a piece of bamboo and basil leaf.  This was an interesting combination.  Probably my least favorite dish of the night.  The basil leaf was a bit overwhelming and covered the taste of the ahi too much.  - Filet Mignon with oversized asparagus.  The meat was tender and very well cooked, very pink in the middle.  I'm not a big beef eater so I only ate the edges of the piece but my friends seemed to enjoy it.  Definitely not one of the top dishes of the night but was still yummy.  The ASPARAGUS however, was QUITE delicious!! they probably cooked it in butter... hahaha i'll take it :) A good bite on the outside and nice and tender on the inside!  - Sea Bass with oversized Peruvian corn!!! YUMMMY!!!! The sea bass was nice and flaky.  Flavoring was a bit salty but I feel like at these restaurants they tend to do that a bit...i mean, everyones a bit intoxicated so salty foods are what people want LOL The peruvian corn was just really fun to eat!! My friends really enjoyed it but I definitely like summer sweet white corn on the cob better :)  - MUSHROOM POT ON CRACK. THIS WAS DEFINITELY THE SHOW STOPPER OF THE NIGHT!!! the flavoring of the sauce, the textures of the 3? 4? different mushrooms. happiness. The sauce was like a cream of mushroom, milky, full flavored, salty, a hint of sweetness... too good. needless to say we all took a bite and just smiled in satisfaction. We all stared at each other and knew rice was needed to soak up all that bomb sauce!!  - 4 different Sushi Rolls were brought out last (3.5 stars).  All 4 were decent, nothing really to rave much about unfortunately. :(  I'm a big big sushi lover and have had some off the chart rolls so I can't pretend these were anything to die for.    ***The first time I came my friend ordered for the table and I definitely think that made a difference.  They have some REALLY scrumptious dishes that I wish I could've ordered for my friends to try!! Perhaps next time!! I'll be more prepared lol   OVERALL RATINGS: Food - 3.75 stars (except for the mushroom pot on crack... 4.5 stars for that) Food (for the first time I came) - 4.25 stars!  Drink - 4 stars for the cucumber cocktail & bottle of Santa Margaritta Pino Grigio Presentation - 4 stars Service & Ambiance - 4 stars  I gave this place 4 stars mainly because I had a great time that night, and the company I kept definitely played a big part in that.  The food IS goood, just a bit $$$$.  Its definitely a GREAT place to go with a group thats just looking for some good eats, good drinks, and a great time :O) BOTTOM LINE: I'd DEFINITELY GO BACK AGAIN!!",

Located on the second floor of the Palazzo Hotel, this place takes sushi to a whole new level. It was my last day in Vegas and decided to try it out with some company for lunch. The atmosphere was quite enjoyable! Loved the ambiance. The only bad thing I would have to mention is the lack of service, though it could have been due to the World Cup Finals contributing to the poor service. Nevertheless, this place has DELICIOUS sushi.  Combined total including tip: $100 (4 people) Originality & Taste: 5/5 Service: 2/5 Price: $$  Suggested Samba Rolls: - El Topo ($14): My favorite. Absolutely delicious! Never had anything like it. Fresh salmon, rectangular-shaped sushi (as opposed to your typical round-cuts), melted Mozzarella cheese & crispy onions toppers - Rainbow Dragon Roll ($15): Freshwater eel, mango, red bell pepper, avocado. Need I say more? - Spicy Yellowtail Roll ($6): Fresh yellowtail topped with just the right amount of spicy sauce",

And now my stars were cut in half- Food was phenomenal the first time I was there  (July 2009)  We did the omokase style dining and my hubs and I were simply enchanted with the whole visit.  We were raving about the food, the service, the ambience- it was great!  But my 2nd time there was horrible.  Here's a summary (on a scale of 5)  Wait staff- 3 Food quality- 5 Wait time- 0 Management- 0  We had a party of 12 and were there for a total of 4 hours.  The wait staf was nice (Issaac) but I guess too overwhelmed to be attentive. (Even though they did charge the 20% gratuity)  Food was delicious but SUPER slow.  I have no idea what was going on with the cooks, but management should've taken some responsibility and put us at ease somewhere between the 4 hours of our visit.  Our waiter brought us a round of shots to make up for the wait I suppose.  Nice, but NOT nice to have it thrown in your face as if a favor was made. The manager did this???  We were brought a total of 3 different checks because they kept screwing up.  This made us doubt that they were being fair in the way they were charging us- and we were right.  There were items on the bill that were not brought to our table. SHAME ON U!  We tried to relay our disatisfaction to \"Brian\" one of the managers, but he came at us with a complete bad attitude.  He ASSUMED that we were trying to get a free meal, when all we really wanted was for him to take some responsibility and admit that they SUCKED!  I might return- but probably not with a large party.",

    "text": "We arrived at the restaurant at about 12:40 on a Saturday night. The hours stated that they close at 2am however you would think it was 1 because we were rushed. The waiter was kind enough but he told us that the kitchen was closing and from that point he spewed suggestions out faster than we could look at the descriptions of them on the menu and it seemed as if they were just trying to feed us and get us out. The ambiance and seating were pleasant. We started with the samba strip and the green envy rolls. They were just ok. I have paid $15-20 for sushi rolls before and was less than impressed with the taste of these selections which tasted like run of the mill, $5 rolls. However, we ordered the raved about sea bass skewers that were recommended here on yelp and wow were we blown away. Succulent, juicy and jam packed with flavor. The waiter even gave us an extra one, perhaps because of the rush. If we weren't full from the rolls and didn't observe our server motion to the kitchen that they were done several minutes before we received the skewers, then we would have asked for another order... Maybe two lol.  We give 3 stars because of the overpriced sushi rolls and the feeling of being hurried but if you get a chance, try the sea bass skewers and maybe some of the other dishes... I'll definitely give them a second chance...perhaps a little earlier in the day next time.",

It is Vegas after all: people dont necessarily keep regular hours, our circadian rhythms were thrown off to say the least. Anyway, the place was really cool, i loved the ambiance, the art on the walls and the designs. The place was a bit dim, but I wouldn't classify it as romantic or dark. There were families, younger(us) and and middle aged people so its not a party place where you would do saki bombs(there are enough of those in Las Vegas), nor do you have to wear a suit & tie to come in.  The appetizers were delicious! the side sauces accompanying them were equally great. Each roll comes with 6 pieces, which was perfectly sized, the one roll that stuck with me was El topo, that one was really tasty. Friends of mine tried the wild mushroom soup--they were really happy with their choice. The price was very reasonable too. I'd definitely give this place a try if you are in the mood for some Sushi.",

Let me state that the food is awesome in every respect and I do go there for my sea bass and yellowtail, but the server (Javier Mendez) is my foremost reason for returning! He was the most knowledgeable person (regarding the entire menu... from sushi 2 sake) I've ever met...mix that with a gracious, hospitable attitude and you have a winning combination.  After coming here for three years to the Vegas SushiSamba, a group (12) of friends (from Louisiana which meet bi-monthly) decided go to Miami's South Beach SushiSamba for our dinner party.  I flew Javier from LAS to MIA to be our server.  I'll admit, his buddy Tommy that assisted is no slouch, but I knew I needed top notch service for this picky group.......and I got it!  Food was fabulous and the service was impeccable! I had non-sushi eating \"guests\" that were literally amazed at the food selection!  It's by no means the least expensive restaurant in town, but as they say...\"you get what you pay for\".  I'm heading back to Vegas in a few weeks and will get on \"Open Table\" and make my reservation for another culinary adventure.  I must go one step further and state that Matt is a fabulous server in Vegas as well, I just happened to get Javier first.",

I just wanted to start off by saying that the service I experienced from Dayn and his colleagues was by far some of the best service i've received in a restaurant. This comes from someone who's experienced some of the best establishments throughout the world.   Besides the fact that everything from the point where I placed my order, to the minute I got my bill was virtually flawless. I think where the service stood out is when i asked my server for his opinion on the menu items, he didn't just read off a script as most. He actually sat down with me and we had a discussion. He told me what was popular, what he liked, and gave me a detail description of the menu items. It was very friendly and refreshing considering I was eating alone, and had just spent most of the week in a conference where all conversation is straight business.  The following day I went back and was greeted by a manager named Hayes Swope, who in the end of my second visit, lifted the bar of restaurant service yet again.  I would like to comment everyone at the establishment for a job well done, and will probably make special trips to vegas just to eat at this place again. No more conference food for me thank you very much...",

We all felt that we had a great meal and plenty of food and our waiter Kylie made sure to point out which foods my sister could and couldn't have so she didn't get sick.",

The blame it on rip drink is spicy and yummy.  However the waitstaff was not so good. They were slow and rude. Sushi rolls took ages to get, and pretty much ignore clients. Lets just say the bussing staff does better at filling your water then the waitress does of making money for the estabishment.  They don't update their wine list very often so don't be surprised if they are out of stock.  Would I go back? Debatable...",

But as a gift from the chef was this incredible oysters on the half.... Never did I eat something so amazing..... It seamed to have some kind of pesto on it that was to die for!!! We also were recommended the special scallops of the night.... It had coconut cream on it and they were soooo good.... We then ordered the rib steak... Although we ordered it medium rare it came out medium well, I still wouldn't complain.... It was sliced in a clay pot with the an amazing sweet sauce with mushrooms and truffles.... Wow... Usually dessert sounds better then it is, but this time was different... This was better by miles then what it sounded like!!! Everyone must order the samba dulce banana dessert.... Better then sex!!! I cannot wait to come back and try the tasting menu!!! Our waiter was adorable and the service was immaculate!!! I cannot wait to come back....",

I was with a group of 8 and we were in party mode.  The ambiance added to it... I would say that it has sort of a loungey/clubby atmosphere, but dress is casual.  Our waiter was awesome.  I wish I could remember his name.  We basically told him what we liked and didn't like and he created our menu for us.  We had so many different plates that I can't remember them all.  We had a lot of sashimi, a lot of rolls, and some in-betweens.  The ones that stick out in my mind are the Yellowtail Seviche Taquitos and the Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass... DELISH.  They also served us these raw, semi-thin slices of Kobe beef with a bunch of different sauces and spices that we could dip it in before searing it on a hot rock!  We also had a few bottles of expensive sake and were taking shots all throughout dinner...  KUNG PAO!  With all that said, there are two reasons I didn't give Sushi Samba 5 stars.  The quality of most of the fishes was good, but not great.  This was more evident in the sashimi-style dishes.  Also, the pricing is a bit steep.  Our meal ended up being about $200 per person.  While it was really good and the service was great, I didn't feel like I had a dinner that equated to that much money.",

We had the sashimi tiradtio, which has tons of flavor, sweet, tart, sour, its all there. We tried the bass, which Mike our waiter, suggested we had to try, and it was cooked to perfection and full of flavor. We also ordered the kumamoto oysters, which tasted fresh and delicious! The cooked scallops were the best part of the meal!  The place was packed, and although it was a Saturday night, Vegas gets a little dead around Christmas. Great atmosphere. Awesome service! There was always someone giving us a new clean plate and coming to refill our drinks.  Hayes used to be the GM there but I was informed is the director of operations and is genuinely the nicest restaurant manager I've ever met. He hooked us up with free club entry to a very nice club! Now, that's full service!",

    "text": "Yum!  Came here for dinner whilst on vacation. Cute place with a bar area and then more extensive seating for the restaurant area. Our party of 3 ordered an appetizer of kobe beef (super super pricey! our waitress had to inform us that the actual price was even more expensive than what was listed on the menu) and I wanted yellowtail so we got the hamachi sashimi tiradito. The kobe was really tender and delicious; we got to cook it on a hot rock ourselves. It came with an assortment of sauces and oils and salts, but my preference was just to dip it in the sesame oil before cooking it and then getting a few grains of the black rock salt to stick to the edge of the meat before eating it. The tiradito was yummy too. It came with a tangy spicy, ginger-y sauce (that was also given to us with the kobe) and was topped with little red jalepeno slices (and since I love spicy foods, that was awesome to me).  For main entrees, we ordered the chef special sushi platter and asked to make sure they gave us the 'yamato' as one of the rolls (which is really fancy with foie gras and tuna and caviar and gold leaf). We also ordered the 'bobo brazil' which contains kobe beef and chimichurri (one of my favorite sauces) amongst other things, and the 'rainbow dragon' which had a wasabi pea crust on it, which made the texture really interesting (in a good way).  To go with our meal, we also ordered several different kinds of sake. We ended up having the manager (who is an avid sake enthusiast and has been to Japan many times to find delicious sake for the restaurant) help us out with choosing the right sake to go with our dishes. We started off with an unfiltered, super fruity, sweet sake which I fell in love with. I'm not a big fan of sake usually, but this one was really good. The other ones we tried were all pretty good too (light and I could barely taste the alcohol) but they were all overshadowed by the first one we had.  Since we had already racked up a pretty extensive bill with all the food that we ordered, we decided to splurge on a little dessert too. I ordered the 'carmen miranda' which is just seasonal fruits with a little cake and yuzu sorbet. The sorbet was tart and refreshing and a nice way to end the meal (like a palette cleanser and breath saver! haha). Someone else ordered the warm chocolate banana cake. Our server told us it was the most popular dessert but warned us that it was super rich and heavy. It came out in a huge flying saucer shaped dish with a tiny dip in the middle to hold the dessert. I didn't taste it but it definitely smelled and looked amazing and the guy who ordered it seemed to enjoy it.  Oh! And the highlight of the night was when the DJ started playing some Fedde le Grand tracks!! GAWD. A meal encompasses not only the food, but the ambiance, and that was perfect for me. (The DJ was set up in a really accessible location, so I'm sure you could go and request stuff if the music you're hearing isn't adding to your meal).",

My favorites were the Avacado roll and Chilean Sea Bass skewers. Single mixed drinks are strong which is great because I hate water-downed drinks. If going with a group as I did, and plan on drinking, DO NOT opt for the 3-4 mixed drink carousel/tower! It's a major rip off for the price they charge for it - $70. You're definitely better off buying individual drinks which are nice and strong. Great atmosphere/ seating/ music.",

I went last weekend with my boyfriend to watch the World Cup Final. They let us in half an hour before the game started and gave us great seats right in front of the projection screen. Our waiter was very attentive without being overbearing (we were obviously watching the game and did not want to be interrupted too much) and also made some great suggestions for us without being pushy. The manager also came by and gave us some souvenir soccer balls (although we had a bit of trouble fitting them in the suitcase).   The food was amazing as well. I highly suggest getting the ceviche sampler and picking four of your favorite fish. Make sure you pay attention to what else is on it though because some have spicy peppers. Also, the Samba Juice was a great drink if you are looking for a cocktail.  My only issue was that it was a little pricier than I would have liked. However, it is Vegas so I knew it was going to be a little more expensive. I suggest not ordering anything easily found in your normal sushi restaurant (miso, tempura, sashimi, etc) unless you really need to have it. Try some new fusion foods instead!",

They brought out 5 rounds of food I believe and there was a ton of it!The food over all wasn't anything amazing, but the DRINKS were fantastic and there were a few food gems as well.   If you eat here and are not allergic to fish you HAVE to try the Sea bass it is served on a skewer in this teriyaki type sauce and it is hurt me so good AMAZING! As I said the food here in general was pretty good, but nothing that I was impressed with but one bite of the sea bass and I was so so so happy we came lol! Other food gems were the string bean fries (the sauce was the clencher for this) and these firecracker shrimp situations yum!

The sea bass was pretty tasty, the corn was unique, and the pacific roll provided a burst of flavor.  Overall, however, the food, along with the experience, especially when factoring in the overpriced nature of meals on the strip, was slightly above average.

I like the concept of the restaurant  so that drew me in. Sat at the bar last Thursday and we had great service from the bartenders, a blonde gal and dark haired gentleman. The bar seats are these really comfy large round stools, which I liked! I had a really good spicy something drink with tequila, enjoyed it! We weren't super hungry so we did edamame, sashimi tiradito and two rolls.  Had the yellowtail sashimi tiradito. Ok, taste wise it was good, but it didn't have that super awesome super fresh melt in your mouth taste AND portion size was way off for the price. I'm not upset about the 4 pieces,  I'm upset that they were so small and paper thin! I would have rather gotten another one of their awesome looking rolls for the same price. We had two of their Samba rolls which I enjoyed. The Carnaval and El Topo. It was hard to decide on the rolls because they all sounded awesome. These were both pretty good, enjoyed the Carnaval the best. The fish tasted pretty fresh as well and was not overpowered by all the other flavors going on.  I would most likely come back and try more things on the menu.  Maybe the small plates and definitely more rolls.  I also understand they have Happy Hour, so that would be cool to check out.",

Great place for groups, ambiance is great. I would go back.",

    "text": "I tried to celebrate my 33rd Birthday here just this last Saturday (2/18), but  had a horrible experience (didn't even get to taste the food). The one star represents the one good server we encountered.  So here is what happened. My twin brother's girlfriend made a reservation for 15 a few days before our group arrived in Las Vegas.  By the time we arrived to eat our group had dwindled to 8, we all know things happen in Vegas & plans change. Anyway, we explain the situation to the hostess and were seated promptly. My first impression of the place was 'dark place but nice'. The restaurant wasn't that busy, empty tables all around us. Our server arrives to our table with one menu and pretty much says the rest of us cannot have a menu. He tells us that due to the size of our group we cannot order individually and are required to agree to a $60 a person menu. He seemed a little nervous, said something along the lines that if we have a problem with this, then you can speak with the manager and disappeared. We're all like, WHAT?  At the time of the reservation, this should have been explained and it was not. So we ask to speak with the manager and had to wait for another 45 minutes to have this accomplished.   Anyway, we order a $70 dollar bottle of sake to make a toast before ordering dinner. By the time it arrives to the table our group had grown to 12. We had a second server approach our table and we explained to her that we were not aware of the requirement that we could not order individually.  I forget her name but I think it starts w/ an M (she is the reason for the 1 star). She explains that we can order al a carte, however due to there being 3 different kitchens, they cannot guarantee that everyone's food can arrive at the table at the same time. Everyone at the table agreed that this is okay and we are ALL given our own menus, finally. Dang! Our 2nd server was very apologetic and seemed to understand our situation and said it would be fine for our LARGE group of 12 to order what we want. So we're all like cool, we can do this.  20 minutes later, the manager comes to our table and tells us that we CANNOT order individually because he will not put his kitchen staff & chef's through that. We are all sitting at the table in shock. Really! Professional chefs can't handle 12 different orders. He proceed to push the $60 dollar per person menu & how his kitchen will customize our order regarding any food allergies, like, or dislikes but they can't handle one person ordering a sushi roll and  another whatever else is on the menu (I didn't even get a good look at the menu due to all this crap going on).  By this time, we get the money together to pay for our sake & one beer and are packing up to leave. My twin brother who is a server and has been in the restaurant business for years and knows how to make the customer happy, went to talk with the manager to let him know that we were not happy with the situation and that we were leaving.  My group was not rude, loud, or disrespectful at all, we just wanted to have dinner & a good time. We ended up leaving without dinner, the manager comped the drink bill, and we gave our \"good server\" a $30 tip for at least being kind and hearing us out without trying to bamboozled us each out of  $60+.  So, would I recommend this place to a friend or anyone else, HELL NO!",

My only complaint is that we had too much food and I ate too much before the sushi came. Next time I will decrease the amount we spend per person and ask for the sushi to come sooner in the meal. We really enjoyed the Yellowtail Taquitos, Sea Bass and the Wagyu beef that we cooked on hot rocks!!! This was awesome!! Service was excellent!! I will go back!!",

Some of the low points:  - $6 tea. TEA! You know, the stuff you drop leaves in water to make?  - $6 Edamame. Were they able to pontificate about the glories of Socrates vs. Plato? No? Well for that price they should have been.  The rolls were reasonable but after BC nothing compared to Tentatsu. Look it up.   Avoid this restaurant unless you want to drop your cash.",

    "text": "Date/Time:  Monday - 10pm Occasion:  Vegasaversary dinner after Phantom  Party of:  Two Location:  Amongst the shoppes in Palazzo.  Interesting decor.  Dark ambiance. Ordered:  Roasted Shishito Peppers, Hamachi Tiradito, Miso-glazed Seabass Skewers, Spicy Tuna Roll, Moqueca Mista, and Trio of Sorbet/Ice Cream (green tea, lychee, and vanilla) Total incl gratuity: ~$110  I am so stunned that Sushi Samba (SS) has an overall rating of 3.5!  It definitely deserved a 5 in my book.  Was pretty blown away by all of their food.  I'm not usually that impressed with Asian fusion but they deserve two thumbs up.  We arrived at 10pm and I was expecting it to be rather dead but it was still busy and happening.  All tables occupied, loud music bumping, and servers running around.  The BF and I decided on a few dishes to share.  Everything on the menu ranged between $10 - $30.  Granted we ordered a number of different items - for variety and sufficiency - we figured our dinner bill would be a little pricey.  Seeing shisito peppers on the menu, I had to go for it.  I don't know what it is about these little things but I love them.  SS serves them grilled with a splash of lemon and seasalt.  A very good and light starter.  It actually went really well with the lemongrass sauce that was served with the hamachi tiradito.  Don't even get me started on that lemongrass sauce. O.M.Gee. I'm pretty sure there was a hint of crack in that thing because I was drinking that stuff.  It was so incredibly delicious.  When the waitress tried to take my plate away, she noticed how much I was savoring each drip of it so she brought me out a ramekin of it.  Naturally I was dipping everything in that sauce.  The seabass skewers were just as delectable - melted in my mouth with the perfect flavor of miso.  Highly recommend!  We noticed our neighbor ordered the moqueca mista. It looked delicious and we opted for it as well.  It was the perfect entree.  I couldn't have been more pleased.  The seafood was fresh and generous in portion.  The coconut lime flavor was delicious.  Seriously, SS is fantastic  I can't emphasize it enough.  Since I've been back home, I've been telling everyone about this place. No joke!  One can only hope that they'll open one in SF.  I'm headed back to Vegas in a week - making my way back there for SURE!",

There was a moderate amount of ambient noise with the music, but I liked the fun atmosphere of the place.  I ordered the Yamato and Sao Paulo rolls since they looked like the most interesting rolls on the menu.  The food arrived rather quickly.  The yamato roll really looked spectacular with the gold leaf, but there were only three pieces and there was a sweet sauce that completely overpowered the roll so I could not taste the foie gras.  The sauce was tasty, but it would have been nice if the right balance were achieved.  The sao paolo roll had a variety of fish topping the rolls, and it was quite tasty, but not worth $24.  My server was attentive and polite.  While the food was good, it was way overpriced given the multitude of dining options on the strip.",

If we had known we would have just ordered $120 worth of food and chosen what we wanted to eat. On top of that I told the server I do not eat raw fish and my husband does, so we both expected to see some raw for my hubby and cooked for me, but they brought out everything cooked. It was okay for me, but my husband did not think it was okay. Overall, everything was very tasty, but I felt like it wasn't worth it. The last two rolls they served us was also two different variations of a California roll with a little bit of lobster on top and tempura in the other. My advice would be not to get the tasting menu and opt to order your own dishes. I'm not complaining though. We will be back and maybe after I get to choose my own items I may increase my star rating. I have to say we left feeling fairly full from the meal.",

    "text": "Sushi Samba is my favorite place to eat in Las Vegas.  I have been there seven times now, and everything (nearly) is perfect each time.  I would probably recommend staying away from the 'Tasting Menu.'  This is when you tell the server what you like and they bring things out for you.  Almost always they bring too much food and you spend way more than you intend too.  Absolutely try the mini sea bass tacos, sea bass skewers, and any sushi!  The Saki menu is impressive, extensive, but very expensive.  I don't know really know fine Saki, so it is hard to justify $100+ for something I don't appreciate and typically stay away from that too.  Overall, Sushi Samba is one of my favorites in the country.",

The sushi is some of the best in town, always fresh, flavorful, and the way it's served is nothing but first class.  I can personally recommend any of the lobster dishes, gyoza, wagyu, and uni. The atmosphere is light, it's convenient, and just an overall fun place to eat",

We decided to start with edamame which is boring I know but for some reason that's just what I always do at sushi places. Then we tried the tuna tataki and yellowtail taquitos appetizers. Both were really good. The yellowtail taquitos were so cute little tacos with avocado, yellowtail, and yummy garnish on top. Then we got the samba strip, Lima, and el topo rolls. The samba strip was our favorite with big chunks of lobster and a perfectly sweet sauce on top. The Lima had tempura shrimp and crab which the crab was kind of fishy so not our fav. Then El Topo was different - it came out hot and had melted mozzarella cheese on top. Not a lot of flavor. For dessert, we got the Chocolate Sata Andagi. This was AMAZING. I would come back here just to order this dessert. It's sugar coated donut holes that have cream and chocolate ganash inside, with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and rasperry puree to dip in. To die for. Be sure to get your own because you'll want to eat the whole thing. Overall, the meal was average. Good service but long wait. We waited 55 min for a table for 2 on a Monday night.",

I will tell you though, sake aside, the meal was phenomenal, the setting was very trend/cool.

The tuna small plate was great and the tuna ceviche was great.  Both were packed with flavor and fresh! The presentation was beautiful, the taste was delicious every bite and I enjoyed myself.  would definitely go back! The only reason I can't give 5 stars is the prices! They are extremely high, especially for the small plates, for the amount of fish you get.  I guess thats what you get in a strip hotel but with other options there it isn't a must if you compare.  There are some gerat off the strip sushi places I can wait and go to in order to satisfy the craving!",

If you are looking for traditional sushi/sashimi, this is definitely not the place to go, however if you are willing to try some new and innovative cuisine, this is great! The ambiance is dark, in a romantic way. However, I was disappointed when I asked to sit by the bar. My favorite reason to sit by the bar in sushi joints is to watch the sushi chefs at work. However, the way it is set up, there is a barrier, and there's not much to see. That was the only disappointing part of it.",

They have a large selection of specialty cocktails, and a really awesome/unique food menu.   I was out for a quick client lunch, and didn't have nearly as much time as i'd hoped to explore the menu. We all enjoyed our sushi and the service was pretty good too.   This place is open for lunch which is awesome because, the other sushi spots are only open for dinner.   This place would be great first date spot in my opinion because it's not overly romantic and would come across as fun, hip and trendy. Also would be great for birthday parties with more than a few people.   Can't wait to bring my husband here on our next Vegas weekend.",

FYI: one order is 3 pieces for $19, if you're there with a date, make sure you tell the server 2 orders because you definitely don't want to be fighting over the last piece.   The restaurant itself is beautifully designed and decorated, love the art. The food, believe it or not, we ordered a lot, is great.

It may be too loud for an intimate date unless you're going for lunch.  Our server was great but the hostesses were bitches. We arrived a little early to the podium with no greeting. Hey, smile and greet. That's pretty much your only job besides answering the phone and seating! We were not able to be seated until the scheduled reservation time so we sat at the bar to start off with some drinks while we waited. The food was good. We ordered the Wagyu beef gyoza, assorted sashimi and hamachi tacos. The sashimi is the new age fusion kind with the Yuzu sauces and  jalapeno topping so don't expect it to be in its pure naked form like traditional Japanese restaurants. Maybe they do also offer it in its pure form but we didn't order or expect it that way and the quality of the fish is mediocre so you may not want it that way anyway.   I'll definitely be back!",

The little boy dining near us was given one of those training chopsticks that are screwed together and all you have to do is pinch...or maybe it was his own...unsure. Haha.   The ambiance was just lovely. While my fellow diner and I waited for our order, we gazed the room and talked about it for a good 10 minutes.   The server was very friendly-all smiles- and she described all the dishes we had questions about and gave us great recommendations. We ordered:  seviches and tiraditos (4 assortments for $35, good deal)       -jumbo shrimp =very fruity, didnt mix with the salty items, but good       -kanpachi = a very anomalous taste, you'd either hate or love it       - yellowtail tiradito = yellowtail is alwayys yumm       - yellowtail seviche = recommended along with ^  we ordered three samba rolls 1) samba strip roll (maine lobster) = good amount of lobster and was yummy. 2) Bobo Brazil (seared kobe beef) = was pretty good 3) Pacific (crab) = mediocre  This place is a little pricey, but you can't get these rolls elsewhere can you? Idk, you try and tell me.",

    "text": "It looks like E.Honda from Street Fighter decorated the place. It's dark, it's loud, and there are colorful flashing images of Japanese stuff on the walls. Since it's fusion food, there might have been other images spliced in between. I don't know, it's probably all subliminal.  Japanese-Brazilian-Peruvian fusion is an interesting concept. I've eaten all 3 types of cuisine separately, and I know the distinct flavors. But fusion? Usually I take that word to the extreme -- either really bad, or really good. Here, based on the dishes we had, it's teetering somewhere in the middle.  Right off the bat, our waitress was energetic and helpful, especially when I asked her for recommendations. Since the menu can be daunting, she recommended the chef omakase, which can range from $60-100 per person. The higher range includes cooking thin slices of kobe beef on a hot rock. We eventually decided to go with the items on the menu.  I started off with the Samba Juice cocktail, which practically has every exotic fruit flavor imaginable like watermelon, acai, raspberry, guava, passion fruit, etc. While refreshing, it was just basically overpriced fruit juice. It desperately needed more alcohol. Oh there was rum in there? I think there was a tickle of rum on my tongue.   The food arrived fast, which was good and bad at the same time. The tables for 2 are ridiculously small and cramped. It was like playing Tetris, trying to fit in all the plates on our table without having anything fall over. We ordered a good variety of dishes, some hits and some misses.  Thumbs up: - Rock shrimp tempura - Crispy taquitos (tacos) w/ yellowtail seviche - Yellowtail sashimi seviche  Thumbs sideways: - \"Whole\" squid w/ lemon aioli - Grilled hamachi kama - Banana honey crisp taquito (taco)  Thumbs down: - Samba strip roll w/ maine lobster - Miso sea bass skewer w/ peruvian corn  This may sound extreme, but just telling it like it is -- the $19 sushi roll tasted like Costco sushi. The texture of the rice was mushy and slithery, like it was pre-made and left in the fridge for a while. I didn't even really taste any lobster. They did leave out the shells for presentation, just to remind you that it does, in fact, contain lobster.  The miso sea bass skewer was horribly oversalted, either from plain salt or from the miso marinate. While buttery in texture, it was barely edible without having to take a big gulp of water. The peruvian corn kernels look like regular corn on steroids. While intriguing to look at, they were bland and had an uneasy and chewy texture about them.  The other dishes were okay, nothing extremely imaginative or creative on the palate. Although we ordered our own dessert, our waitress was nice enough to give us an additional complimentary chocolate mousse with these little crunchy malt balls on top, to celebrate our anniversary. It even had a sparkler on it, attracting dozens of eyes. I felt like a baller at a club, albeit for 10 seconds before the sparkler died off.   Overall, we had an enjoyable dinner with good service. But the whole fusion thing didn't work out for me. If I want Japanese food, I know where to get it -- the same goes for Brazilian and Peruvian, respectively. It was cool trying the place out, just another restaurant checked off on our long list of Vegas bookmarks.",

    "text": "On the Saturday of my bachelorette party, my girlfriends treated me to dinner at Sushi Samba.  It was a fabulous, memorable meal, where we ate well and celebrated in style.  We were staying at The Palazzo, and Sushi Samba was the perfect venue for the occasion.  It was convenient to get to in heels, and the atmosphere was festive, edging on clubby without being obnoxious.  We had a big comfortable table, and service was excellent.  I wish we'd gotten the name of our waiter - he did a great job attending to our every need, and he guided us through the whole dining experience with expertise.  (For management - he was a tall guy who served a party of nine on 6/29.  You know, your only bachelorette party of the month?)  We ordered cocktails, which were pretty good.  I had a Blame it on Rio, a caipirinha variation with cachaca, agave syrup, fresh lime juice, cucumber, and jalapeno.  It was both cool and spicy, and it went down really easy.  The classic caipirinha was also great, with just the cachaca, lime, and sugar.  I also tried some of the Chu-Cumber, a shochu drink with Hendricks gin, elderflower liqueur, and muddled cucumber - very refreshing.  At some point, we got a complimentary cocktail tree, a beautiful iron tree bearing shot-sized wine glasses on every branch.  They held some frothy, sweet version of a screwdriver that was great for the occasion.  Dinner was delicious.  We had the option of ordering a la carte or omakase, and we decided to keep things simple.  We specified a price point and listed dietary restrictions, and the food just started coming.  It was all served family style, and everything was well portioned for our big group.  We left full but not overstuffed - a plus, since it had taken a team to stuff me into my white dress for the night.  The cuisine was fun, a creative, unforced fusion of Japanese and Peruvian styles.  First, we had a trio of vegetable otsumami, all served together in a lovely green array.  There was the staple edamame with sea salt and lime, and green bean tempura served with a rich black truffle aioli.  My favorite of the three, though, was the handful of shishito peppers.  These were grilled blistering black, polished with sea salt and lemon.  They were pretty irresistible.  Next we got a tray of Japanese A5 wagyu beef gyoza.  These were great, thin-skinned and stuffed with luscious hunks of beef rather than the usual mince.  They came with kabocha pumpkin puree, a sweet soy drizzle, and a su-shoyu dipping sauce.  The best thing I ate all night, though, was a crispy taquito overflowing with yelllowtail, avocado, and roasted corn miso.  The shell was thin and crunchy, and the fresh, tender fish was just right with that avocado, miso, and some thinly sliced vegetables.  The taquitos were served with spicy aji panca sauce and fresh lime - that piquant, frothy sauce was just the icing on a beautiful fusion taco cake.  After the smaller plates were done, we moved on to big platters of sushi and sashimi.  I do not remember everything we got, as there were at least six or seven rolls and even more kinds of sashimi.  The rolls were great, a nice mix of California standards - you know, the mix and match of eel, yellowtail, tuna, etc. with avocado, cucumber, and dots of mayo - and more Samba-specific stuff, with the stray crab leg and lobster claw.  I particularly liked the Samba Strip, with Maine lobster tempura, mango, tomato, chive, soy paper, and a coating of crispy rice.  It was unusual and flavorful, served with a peanut curry.  The rest of the platter came with a sweet thick soy sauce and a bit of mayo.  The sashimi was more traditional, served on a bed of ice.  It was hard to share, as there was only one of each kind, but the slivers I had were great.  The most filling part of the meal was the churrasco course.  We got two hefty platters of the Rio Grande with three meats, grilled hanger steak, ribeye, and chorizo.  These were great, juicy and tender and full of that hearty grilled meat flavor.  They came with a trio of dipping sauces - malagueta pepper oil, chimichurri, and a third that is infuriatingly absent from the menu.  We also had some sides of rice, beans, collard greens, and a medley of roasted vegetables - giant corn kernels, toothsome brussels sprouts, carrots, celery, pearl onions, and more.  We also got miso-marinated Chilean sea bass a la carte, with roasted organic vegetables and oshinko.  This was a winner - the fish was moist, flakey, and shot through with miso flavor.  We were full by dessert, but loved the complimentary chocolate mousse, served with a sparkler and a congratulatory message.  The lush mousse came topped with crunchy chocolate pearls, whipped cream, and a little bit of candle-stuck banana.  We each got a sweet bite to end our wonderful dinner.  In conclusion, my friends are the best - thank you girls for this weekend, and for this fun, delicious meal.  Sushi Samba was an A+ choice, worthy of a night I won't soon forget.",

So much so that we could hardly hear ourselves speak. We couldn't wait to get out. The sea bass tried to save the day, but it wasn't quite enough to keep us there. As a result we will not be back when we next visit La Vegas. It's sad when a good concept does not succeed because of poor service and an atmosphere akin to a bus station.",

We also ordered another roll, the beef wagyu and rock shrimp and shared with the table, but I didn't leave completely satisfied. This place is probably great for drinks and apps, but I would recommend somewhere else for dinner unless you're not that hungry.",

We wanted only a quick bite, so we got an appetizer and an entree to share. Food is super pricey, quality of the food was alright, but at least it came out quick. Sashimi was fresh, the gyoza's the server recommended was good. We also got the Moqueca which comes with mussels, clams, squid, and shrimp and rice. It was like a soup based dish, and it was pretty good. Somewhat filling, but the green soy rice is too much.. My boyfriend didn't even like the rice at all.   All and all, I'd dine here again, maybe... But it would be an last option. It wasn't all that. Honestly, I was expecting too much.",

If this was an average priced sushi place I would give it a 3 star, instead of a 2 star. The prices are far above the typical though, because of its location on the Strip.   If you're a tourist looking for sushi, I recommend paying for a taxi & taking a trip up Spring Mountain Road to go to the many sushi & Asian restaurants not far from Las Vegas Blvd. If you're a local, there are far too many amazing spots & AYCE sushi joints off the strip for me to ever recommend even trying this place.   Fish is bland. Rice was on the dry side. Fish & rice are the main ingredients in sushi, so this place definitely failed me. If you're looking for drinks though...this place does not disappoint, in that aspect.",

I mentioned in the reservation comments that it was my friend's birthday. When we arrived no one mentioned it, during dinner no one mentioned it but the restaurant knew and figured out who the birthday girl was and at the end of our meal we were pleasantly surprised when dessert came out on this beautiful platter with Happy Birthday and my friends name on it.

    "text": "SUSHISAMBA fuses Japanese, Peruvian, and Brazilian flavors- peculiar, until you realize that Brazil is home to the largest Japanese population outside of Japan itself.  From edamame to plantains, wasabi to chiles, SUSHISAMBA is a True testament to the unique tastes created by immigration and integration and the balanced evolution of these flavors over the last 100 years.   Having visited the Las Vegas location several times as well as the Miami one, SUSHISAMBA is high on my list of culinary experiences that delights time after time.  Among my favorites is Yamato roll, comprised of tuna, foie gras, osetra caviar, topped with gold leaf. At $19 for 3 pieces, you may have to take a sledgehammer to that piggy bank, but you probably won't regret it.    Another outstanding roll is the Bobo Brazil, filled with avocado, kaiware, shiso, red onion, and chimichurri inside, layered with tender seared wagyu beef on the outside. Every bite melds into the tongue and disappears in a flurry of flavor.  I tried the Kanpanchi Tiradito on this last visit and didn't find it worth the $19. Drizzled in yuzu, sea salt, black truffle oil, the 4 small slices of amberjack were acceptable but not exceptional.  On a final note, our waitress looked like a gorgeous supermodel, which worked out great in curbing my own appetite, thus making the meal more affordable. I already started a new piggy bank for next time.",

The temptation is to hit the whole menu because each dish is not particularly large, but I recommend hitting the high points - a few skewers, some ceviche tacos, and a few rolls and supplementing with plaintains and coconut rice.  This was entirely satisfying for 4 of us and did not punch us in the nads with the bill.  Our second time here and I can't say it was quite as good the second time around but was fun, unique, and tasty.  Only problem is the per-plate price seems high.  C'est Vegas though.",

We arrived at the Palazzo on a busy Thursday night (Super Bowl weekend in Vegas) and were able to wait for 30 mins at the bar waiting for our table. Cool decor and fun atmosphere. Bartender named Rico was friendly and helpful and came up with a special concoction for us to drink. Hostess staff was warm, not snobby. Once seated, our waitress was also amazing and recommended some really incredible dishes to us, even explaining what took longer timesq to cook, what would come out faster, etc. The food itself is simply incredible. My taste buds were exploding. Some of my favorites were the sea bass skewers, the filet mingnon robata w asparagus and the amazing Sao Paulo sushi roll! Paired with some Nigori sake, it was one of the best meals I've ever had.  Looking around, the place was filled with fun groups and beautiful people. It had a fun vibe and was a great place to people watch, have a date, or have a group gathering. It didn't have that snobby elitist feeling some nice and trendy places do. Btw - don't come here in your t shirt and ratty sweats. Grab a dress or throw on nice nice slacks :)  Well done Sushi Samba. We will be back again.",

The menu itself had a wide selection of Japanese and Brazilian dishes.  Our server was helpful at explaining the menu and the dishes they were known for.  We weren't too hungry so we decided to share a few plates.   We had the yellowtail ceviche, the Sao Paulo roll, and the Wagyu gyoza.  The service here is super fast- all our dishes came in less than 10 minutes.   The dishes we selected were all really good- I would recommend all of them!   If I had to choose I favorite- I suppose I would pick the Sao Paulo roll- it had great flavor and I didn't even use soy sauce.    The service was fast- my friend and I were in and out of that restaurant in less than 45 minutes.  We had a pleasant experience and would definitely dine again our next visit.",

He said \"great, we will do something special\".  Then we proceeded to order drinks and appetizers and then dinner. Things got weird when waiter was first hovering around to get each of our orders, and then again to push round 2 of drinks.   Don't you normally say \"I will give you a few minutes after getting a menu?\"  He wasn't leaving. We were conversing and he was just standing there. We still had 3/4 of our drinks when round 2 was being offered.  Dinner came out while appetizer was still on the table.  I asked for extra ginger for a roll but it never came.  While I was still eating, waiter brought out dessert menus to others in my party.  He asked if we wanted coffee while we still had full cocktails to enjoy.  The rush was so pervasive that we thought management had to be pushing this mentality.  The bus boy was cleaning around me while I was still enjoying my dinner.  Clearly, in the end \"Kiley\" our waiter forgot it was my birthday.   He didn't do anything special as promised.  He picked up dessert menus and brought us the check.  How embarrassing.  Great food but super rushed.  He didn't let us enjoy the experience.  He was more concerned about the benjamins and turning table to next group.  \"Always be selling\" is just not appropriate for a nice birthday dinner.  He should also work on his professionalism..  when we said food tasted great, he said  \"awesome\".  Lose the awesome and add Excellent in its place.  More appropriate.  In the end, food was delicious but pricey and way too much staff.  It was also pretty loud.  I think our waiter was hovering so much cause he only had 2  - maybe 3 tables.  So uncomfortable.  Won't go there for a special dinner again.",

    "text": "My rating would be closer to a 3.5 but in having to choose between a 3 or 4, I went with a 3.  The ambiance is dark yet lively. A couple friends of mine were in town and didn't want to have to walk far so they made reservations here. Taking an elevator down to the restaurant is as close as it gets.  Never having been here, we were a little overwhelmed with what to order. The server came by and suggested the omakase which I think was about $60 per person and you can customize it with your likes, dislikes etc. having experienced the omakase- it was a great way to try many different things at a cost more economical than if we chose to share a few things from the menu.  Most of the food was pretty tasty but there were a handful of things that missed the mark and were not memorable. Also, the oysters smelled rotten. It was really disgusting. We sent that back.  Drinks took a long time, tables are cramped for space compared to the large, clunky dishes. They also forgot to bring things we ordered but charged us for it. When we brought it to the servers attention she offered to bring it out or remove it. She was nice and informative. But it concerns me that there's no attention to what's coming out or not coming out.  Overall, it was a decent experience. We had fun.",

I like the peruvian corn nuggets because they were kind of different and exotic and I like the sea bass but after that I really couldn't stomach anything else, and the worse part about, the worse part of all is the prices were astronomically high!!!   for 2 people we paid paid over $175 with no drinks for bad sushi and worse service...   never, ever going back there again and I will definitely do the uber/lyft to nobu, referenced above, anytime for sushi when I am back in the V. and if you know nobu its not cheap but the service, sake, quality and taste of the sushi just sets it so far apart from places like this  ugh...",

Service was great and every plate we ordered was simply great. The rock shrimp however is simply special. It was a highlight of our last Vegas trip for sure. Check out their happy hour menu.

That being said, this restaurant exceeded my expectations. The decor was really interesting and cool. The place settings are very classic and traditional, however the decor was very edgy-modern. Definitely artsy.  The service was excellent. Our server gave us suggestions and told us a little about the restaurant.   The food was amazing. There are definitely vegetarian and vegan options. We did however order some seafood. We got the veggie tempura, salt and pepper squid, Amazonian roll, sea bass robata and the asparagus robata. Everything was good. There wasn't a single bite where we were disappointed.  Drinks were amazing. We got the nashi which is a lychee cocktail and the watermelon mojo which has watermelon, lime and guava. Drinks are on point here.   Sushisamba is the BEST restaurant we ate at during our stay in Vegas.   People should be aware that it is expensive but well worth every penny.",

We saw one on the menu for $4000!!!   We ordered the oysters (I wasn't a fan), shishito peppers & edamame for appetizer. I loved the shishito peppers personally. Then we ordered the yellowtail jalapeno, some specialty tuna roll that was crunchy & another specialty roll that had mozzarella cheese in it (sorry can't recall the names) & they were all very very tasty.  You should expect to spend about $50-60/person at this Restuarant. Overall, it was good & I recommend it to everyone especially if you are staying at the Palazzo hotel.  The waiter & the hostess were very friendly & nice. Our waiter was originally from Baltimore & he was very nice.",

And a zillion other things that I don't even remember.   The sea bass with corn is my favorite. It was the most tender and juicy piece of fish skewered onto wooden sticks.

We got two bottles of cold unfiltered sake which I recommend to all the yelpers out there. My Fiance had this bowl of soup dish that had pork, noodles, lot of spices, etc. I had some kind of roll which was very good.  A couple people in our party ordered Churrasco Rio Grande which was this huge grill your own steak dish with tons of dipping sauces, sides, and meats. It was beyond delicious, and fun. You get to grill the meat on a hot stone.  Basically, this is the only Fusion restaurant I have even been to that worked. The menu had a lot of vegan and vegetarian items as well, and the servers handled our party which was a little rambunctious to say the least.  Prices are very reasonable.",

We went with the option of having the waitress/chef plan our dinner and it was perfect. We got a sampling of all three inspirations (Japanese, Brazilian, Peruvian) based on our preferences. Everything was delicious and perfect for our varying palates. The only reason for one less star is because the waitress claimed to budget us for \"$35-$40\" and then said we were under budget... When the bill came we were definitely over, before drinks.",

I would Definatly recommend eating at Sushisamba!",

Anything fish -- ceviche or sushi rolls are yummy.   Oh and drinks!! Get the special mojito.   I've eaten here 4x in one week!! That's pretty nutso given that I always like to try new places.",

The vibe is a little loud, but this is Vegas, so in context, it's not a serious issue. Our waiter seems like a really nice guy but a little slow. It was pretty full.  The wagyu beef was served with mushrooms and a ponzu sauce that was a tad strong. We had the more traditional of the ceviches on the menu and it was truly extraordinary. Sashimi was awesome and the dragon roll was good too. Dessert was the banana chocolate cake which is one step removed from heaven.   Overall commendable, even at the steep LV strip price.",

    "text": "Oh. My. God. I want to eat here every day of my life, if only for the ishi yaki. My wallet is already throwing a fit about the thought of how quickly I would go broke, but akdsjhfakjldhf. Words cannot describe how much I want to go back and eat ALL THE THINGS. Well more specifically, all the ishi yaki.  In reality though, Sushisamba is unfortunately a sometimes food (unless you're a bajillionaire, in which case, dine on! I will live vicariously through you). It's just too expensive for me, as a student to afford. Thank goodness someone else was picking up the check when I went.  My family and I had our Christmas dinner here at like... 9pm (yea, we did Christmas in Vegas). It was by far, the fanciest Christmas dinner I have ever had.   We were seated in the back room area since we had a relatively large party, but since it was so late, it was mostly empty there, which was simultaneously nice and eery. Our waiter suggested we do the tasting menu, where he and the chef craft our meal for us, but since my mom had just been here with some colleagues the week before, we decided to just let her order for us, since she knew what was good.   - Salt and Pepper Squid: the seasoning made this extra delicious-- a really good starter - Crispy Yellowtail Taquitos: also yummy, though I may be biased because yellowtail is one of my favorite fish; very lime-y - Rock shrimp tempura: a twist on regular tempura, but absolutely delicious; if you don't like spicy mayo, maybe not your thing - Ishi Yaki: Words cannot describe. Grade A5 Japanese Waygu that you cook yourself on a hot Japanese river stone? Yes, please! You take a slice of meat, dip it in oil, and then put it on the hot stone to let it cook. There's a few different dipping sauces and three different types of salt that you can add to your meat. All of them are delicious, though I am partial to the black salt. There were some pears on the plate, so I was like what the heck, why not cook those on the stone too. Still delicious. Even thinking about this is making me crave it. The ishi yaki is really expensive, but if you're going to go for any of the Japanese Waygu options, go for this one because it is definitely the most unique. - We ordered a bunch of sushi rolls, which were good, but not the most amazing ones I've ever had. - Also, the lychee bubbletail is really good. The alcohol is not overpowering, it's not too sweet, and they put a real lychee (probably from a can) in it.  Random: I really like the music on their website... That probably sounds really weird, but it's True. Love it.  tl;dr: I know for a fact that the main reason why I love Sushisamba as much as I do is because I was not paying. It was a crazy expensive meal, but it was delicious because we ordered some rather expensive (but good! oh so very good!) things. If you're not willing to splurge, you'll probably think I'm crazy for giving them a 5-star review, but if you are, be prepared to be amazed. Just don't think about the check. And get the ishi taki. 5-stars for that alone.",

Wagyu beef was just melting in the mouth and was interesting to cook on the hot stone. Wagyu beef was so buttery to eat as sashimi as well. It was just so good. And Yamato roll was very tasty. Combination of tuna, foie gras, osetra caviar makes great combination in the mouth and gold leaf on top makes pretty decoration. Their cucumber martini is excellent also.

    "text": "I definitely recommend this place in Vegas, especially if you are staying at the Palazzo/Venetian. It is a japanese/brazilian/peruvian fusion tapas restaurant that is a master of molecular gastronomy. However, this is NOT the place for a large group. It is best for a group of FOUR people, at most.  First off, this place is expensive with small portions, but how many tapas restaurants are not? That's the whole point of tapas: to have the ability to try many different dishes of bursting flavor without being too full or overwhelmed at the end. That being said, I got to try six different dishes and was very satisfied at the end.  This is what I ordered: -Seared Wagyu Beef (highly recommended, ponzu gelee, warm japanese mushroom, truffled tofu crema, so delicious) $18 -Salmon Sashimi Tiradito (recommended, orange and mustard miso sauce over buttery salmon) $13 -Seabass Anticuchos (recommended, skewered sea bass, miso sauce, and peruvian corn) $17 -Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza (highly recommended!!! kabocha pumpkin puree and su-shoyu dipping sauce; this was my favorite dish, a party in mouth!!) $18 -Pacific sushi roll (skip, it was good but nothing too amazing. there were other rolls that looked more interesting!) $18 -Yellowtail taquitos (toss up, it was good but not as special as the rest of the dishes I had) $12  Oh.. and I ordered one cup of tea.. and it cost $4... My total came out to $108 with tax.... for two people..... for our first meal of the day... Hmm.....  My verdict? This place has GREAT food but don't expect to enjoy it unless you have $$$ to blow. Otherwise, you're going to kick yourself in the face because you could have had an unlimitted buffet for $50/person at Caesar's Palace...",

That was not indicated in the description, so it was a surprise to me when it arrived at the table.  It was tasty though, as was the miso soup.  My children shared the quinoa waffles.  What I did not enjoy was the mushroom tobanyaki.  The flavor was just not good to me and I felt like the dish was missing something.  Perhaps serving it over rice to absorb some of the liquid would have been helpful.  Service was good and we had several people check on us, not just our waiter.  The reason I docked a star was the price.  I felt like everything was so overpriced.  I don't mind paying more for good quality, and our food was of good quality, but even with that in mind I still left feeling like it was just too overpriced... and I left still a bit hungry.  Lunch for 2 adults and 2 kids (no dessert, no drinks) was $130.",

I would recommend getting your drink order in ASAP because I felt like it took awhile for our waiter to come at all. That's really my only complaint with this place--I feel like try didn't have enough waitstaff. Oh, and the place is loud as hell (but great club music) so be prepared to shout your order.  I highly recommend doing the chef's tasting menu (not on the menu I think)-- you pick a price point you want to spend (we spent $70 pp) and then let the server know what types of food you don't like or have allergies to. It's a great way to sample all they have to offer. Some of out dishes included ceviche tacos, a platter with edamame, roasted chilies, and tempura green beans with white white truffle aioli (to die for btw), Kobe beef gyoza, wagyu and sea bass skewers with Peruvian corn, and two different kinda of sushi rolls with tuna and tempura shrimp.

I loved almost everything about this place. My only concern was the rowdy crowd of drunk fools having a great time at the table directly in front of us. That was just apart of my luck though, nothing to do with the restaurant. I wish I could afford to eat here once a week for the rest of my life. It is a meal that can improve the quality of life one lives. First we had some drinks from south of the border which helped wet our appetite. Then we had an appetizer of what seemed to be beef dumplings and ceviche tacos. Next was a beef coarse of filet minion, which changed my life. Last was the sushi. I couldn't even describe the delicate flavors inscribed in each piece of sushi. I trusted the server with my meal and he did not disappoint. We ended dinner with a beautiful and sweet dessert plate of ice cream and chocolates. Trust your server. The tasting menu between 150-200 dollars is the Key.",

We didn't notice until we arrived back home in Seattle the next day. Of course, we were panicked and tried to retrace our moves the night before. We realized we left the credit card at SushiSamba and called to see if the restaurant could help us get the card back. Not only did Yaz help us by taking our multiple phone calls, he saw through that the card was sent back to us. He was very patient throughout the process, and we are very appreciative of his follow-through. Definitely saved us a lot of inconvenience by going above and beyond to provide exceptional customer service! We will definitely come back during our next trip to Vegas in June. Thanks, Yaz!",

She was staying on the strip at Treasure Island so we decided to grab some sushi at the Palazzo.   The Otsunami appetizer of edamame, crispy green beans and green peppers is really good! It was the first time I had sea bass skewers based on other yelp reviews and they did not disappoint! For sushi we had Bobo Brazil roll with is kobe beef, the sushi samba roll with the lobster claw and the Lima roll with Spicy King Crab mix. Also if you want a good cocktail the Samba juice is really good!  They have a busy bar area to have some drinks, a nice sushi bar and a very lively atmosphere inside the restaurant.   The only downside if i had to give one is the rolls are relatively small for the price. However the quality is high! I would recommend checking it out if you are in the area.",

    "text": "Fusion Confusion. Is this Samba or is this Sushi? Turned out it was neither.  When one hear of the word Samba, vision of energy, music, fun naturally appear. Other than the rather different color scheme, this place conjured up none of what the word Samba represent.  We were so convinced by the hype of Samba Sushi that we rushed from the airport to each at this place immediately after checking in at the hotel.  This place was rather quiet when we arrived, but that is fine, we can do quiet just as fine, after all we are here for good food  -- it never arrived, more on that later.  Service, we are not happy with this know it all, shabbily attired waiter. Shabby in the sense that the black shirt did not fit him, might have at one point in the past. And the shirt was not pressed, the food runner were dressed better than him and much more cordially. He seemed to think he was an expert in Japanese food which is questionable, I would rather he take more time to help his customer than showing off. He did the same to those from our next table too.   Wanting to try the best Sushi or Fish this place has to offer, I asked for the \"house special\" of Sashimi. He replied Sushi Samba does not have a set house special, but just tell him what I want and he will put it together for me. (Meaning he don;t understand why discerning Sashimi foodies order Sashimi and not sushi.) So I start namine my favorite which were all shell fish, Giant Clam, razor Clam, Abalone, Live Sea Urchin, --- answer was no, no, no and no we don't carry them. I end up with the run of the mill Tuna, Salmon, Halibut etc etc, fish that you can find in any sushi place in town. So much for, \" tell me what you like and I will put them together for you\".  Sashimi came in one big bowl with fish on top of crushed ice, fish looks good. Knife skill of the sushi chef or whoever cut the fish was average, some unevenness to the edge of the fish from the cut, but by now, this is about what I would expected from this place. But where is the wasabi?  They forgot to bring it! I ask for it again, and when it arrived, it was the powdered form of wasabi, not the fresh root form that most first class sushi restaurant served with their sashimi. Disappointing.  Maybe this place is specialized in other cuisine. After all this is Samba Sushi, so I ventured to other part of the menu searching for \"Samba\".   First the cooked food, the Tempura Shrimp was again ok, I was bracing for impact fearing that lumpy Tempura will appear on my table, it did not. It was not tempura house grade tempura with it melt it your mouth batter, and sweet fresh shrimp, but it was not bad. Shrimp has no taste, but ok.  Then I try the Salt and Pepper squid, an Asian staple. I had to lower my standard one more time to eat this. It had the proper criss cross diagonal cut, but the edge from the cut was burnt, and have hardly any taste to it. I could not eat any more of it.  Then the sea bass. Salty.  My millenial son loved the roll. So at least he got some food in his stomach. I did not.  So I felt this place hungry, still looking for good sushi, and certainly still looking for Samba. Restaurant has great color scheme, interesting laying out, but no energy, no good food. no good service but the price is upper 10%.   Maybe I just visited on a bad night.",

What put it above all the rest was the personal treatment from the manager, Jason. Great guy who goes out of his way to make sure you have an unforgettable evening.  He recommended the Chucumber cocktail, and sure enough it was full of crisp cucumber and sweet elderflower flavor.   If I could give any advice, it'd be to follow the staff and manager recommendations. Tell them your likes/dislikes and any allergies, and leave it to them to bring out a personalized selection of their best dishes.  Whether you have just one night or a week in the area, make sure to book an evening here. Highly, highly recommend!!",

The waitress will ask you if you have any food allergies and what you can/can't eat and then will bring out 5 or so appetizers and 2 types of sushi (if you get the $50-$60 pp) and then will let you know how much money you have left  and you can either use it to get another dish or use it for dessert which is what we did.  Everything we got was good but the best one was the sea bass...so delicious!  We also got the yellow tail tacos,  wagyu beef goyza, tempura green beans, tuna app, some sushi and the green tea chocolate dessert.

    "text": "I came for a bachelorette party last week on Friday night around 11pm. My review is probably (ok definitely) biased because I was in such a bad mood at having to wait until 11pm to eat dinner. However, as you might imagine, 5 girls using one bathroom getting ready to go out in Vegas is a production equal to Cirque de Solei that takes upward of 3 hours. But whatever we finally made it after a 15 minute, mile long cab ride down the strip from the Cosmo to the Palazzo hotel.  The restaurant was super dark (why don't they turn some lights on?) with huge TVs which were super loud. Per the usual at many \"sceney\" type restaurants you could barely here the people across the table from you.   We got seated no problem as the restaurant was dead except for two or three big groups getting wasted in booths and a few lonely looking stragglers at the bar. Our server was friendly but seemed to constantly be in a rush, although to go where I do not know. There seemed to be a ton of bus boys but very few wait staff. He could probably sense our frustration so he promptly brought out a wrought iron tree full of pink drinks. Whether or not they had liquor was the only question (Answer: not enough.) So we got a range of drinks, the best of which was a cucumber lime martini with vodka. After the night's beginning, I opted with straight vodka and diet coke.  For food we got a lot. Some  memorable dishes were the Neo Tokyo roll with tuna which was solid, heirloom tomato salad with sweet cilantro dressing, rock shrimp tempura, mushroom tobanyaki, and sweet coconut rice side. My fave dish of all was the heirloom tomato salad which was pricey but enough to share between 3 people. The rock shrimp was good but cliched, same as you would get anywhere else. The mushroom tobanyaki was interesting but not to my taste.  Sadly we did not get dessert.  In conclusion, I can definitely say i hope I will never be back with another bachelorette party, although I would not mind returning otherwise.",

Every aspect of this dinner missed the mark: from refusing to seat us and ridiculous wait times to forgetting to put dish orders in and bad tasting food. This experience was particularly terrible because the restaurant was almost completely empty. How could you be so bad with so few customers?  The portions at this place are pretty small. The \"Large Dish\" section of the menu means just that, large dish. I was served a tiny portion in a hilariously large bowl.   Needless to say that we'll never come back to this place. Eat somewhere else.",

I had the spicy lemongrass ramen, tuna tataki, lamb robata, organic chicken robata, yellowtail tacos, coconut rice, anago nigiri, unagi nigiri, and sao paulo sushi roll.  All of the food were delicious! This place is a fusion of japanese, peruvian, and brazilian. Most of the portion sizes were tapa style,so you gota order several dishes.  The ramen was well flavored with the spices. The noodle itself were ok, but all of the veggies and porkbelly were soaked in the broth, which made them all taste delicious.  I don't have much complaint, maybe I can go without the tacos and chicken robata. You have to try the lamb because it's super tender and well flavored. The portion is slightly bigger, but order more if needed.  Rolls were small, but it's cute and has plenty of fish to rice ratio.  I would come back again!",

The flavors were just off and coming from LA where you can find fantastic rolls at many places, I wouldn't order rolls at Sushi Samba again.

Host walked us to the bar (didn't just point and direct). When we sat down, immediately visited by our server to take our drink order and tell us about some specials. The food came fast, surprising us because it was peak hours!  Even more was when I tried to wave down our server to order an additional plate, she didn't see us, and the manager (young guy in a suit) came to us within seconds and asked what he could do, he took the order without hesitating (instead of just saying he will call the server over).  We had the spicy edamame, beef dumplings, Chilean sea bass, and samba split. ALL came out within minutes, presented beautifully (can check out the photos) and tasted even better than they looked!  Service was incredible. We asked for hot water with lemon, and even though I didn't touch mine, they replaced it with a fresh one when it became cold! WOW!  The atmosphere is fun, fits sushi perfectly.",

We made a reservation with Michael D, one of the servers, who was apparently awesome. When we showed up, he was a no show. (!) We ended up with Tanice who was awesome. I noticed she was always making sure we were taken care of, working in concert with the servers and bussers. Yes, this place is PRICEY. This is the most expensive meal I've had in my life, I believe. But we left full and very happy. Excellent food, service, atmosphere. We ate at the overhyped Nobu 3 months ago. SushiSAMBA is more reasonably priced and totally blows Nobu out of the water. For about the same amount of $$$$, Nobu gave us much less and not good food. Who needs a celebrity chef?   The assortment of 4 tiradito. Holy cow. That Salmon, mild and yummy. Most salmon is smokey in flavor. This was different...so fresh and tasty on its own, didn't need smoke flavor. Awesome. Also had mushroom tobanyaki, yamato with foie gras, wagyu ishiyaki, tomato salad with lobster (---be prepared to pay a lot for this one)...lots of fresh, sweet lobster. Seabass (like buttah) and scallop (like buttah) anticucho skewers with peruvian corn, and a comp dessert pop for each of us - green tea ice cream ball dipped in chocolate and pop rocks. Washed it all down with a nashi martini, delicious with a lychee garnish.   Will be back for sure; this will be a new go to spot! Thanks for an awesome meal!",

Our server was knowledgeable but was gone for extended amounts of time which caused us to change what we were originally intending to order, but he did make good recommendations.  We would have ordered more if he wasn't gone so long.  The sea-bass skewers were unbelievable --one of the best food items I've ever tried -- & we all really enjoyed the Peruvian style sashimi.  The decor of this place is very cool, the food is super fast, but this is not really a place to go if you want to have a table conversation as it is ridiculously loud and hard to hear people at your own table because of it. There was a large crowd waiting to be sat so I would highly recommend reservations.",

    "text": "This is a review of their happy hour (4-7pm and 11pm until close).  The Skinny: spent $50+ on sub par Peruvian influenced Japanese food (2.5), service: was slow when we wanted to leave (3) value: seeing as there was only 1 dish out of 8 that we would get again, we won't likely be back (3).  We were excited to see that they had a happy hour menu while meandering through the Venetian properties. We thought great! If the food is good during happy hour, we'll come back another time and try their other regularly priced dishes.   So we ordered 8 out of 10 ($6)items on their happy hour menu. Of the 8, we'd probably get only 1 item again. The rest was pretty mediocre considering how much they charge for each dish and the level of cuisine.  We should have known. I mean when the first dish - Yellowtail tiradito - came out, I knew it wasn't going to be good. The thinly sliced 2 pieces of yellowtail were drowning in a pepper sauce. I really couldn't taste the flavor of the fish at all. Definitely not well balanced.   Wagyu gyoza (3 pieces) with kabocha puree was okay. Although the beef had a wonderful smokiness to it, the gyoza were disappointingly undersalted even after dunking in a good amount of soy sauce. The kabocha squash was relatively flavorless which surprised me after reading reviews about this dish.  Chicken anticuchos (2 skewers)were not bad although they weren't particularly memorable either. The meat, slightly grilled/charred, was not crispy enough texturally although it was adequately seasoned.  Eggplant anticuchos with a side of Peruvian corn was okay. I dug the slightly herbaceous kick of the chiffonated mint or basil, cutting the sweetness of the soy based sauce. However the eggplant was a tinge on the tougher side and needed to be roasted with more oil to give it a better texture.  The Peruvian corn is definitely not one of my favorite foods. Potato-like in taste and texture, the chef was able to infuse some acidity to make it more flavorful. It was more palatable with the hit of citrus but still, nothing I needed to try again.  The sushi (Veggie kun - kind of like futomaki, Ezo roll - meager amounts of salmon/asparagus with a ton of panko breadcrumbs mixed in = bad mouth feel, and spicy tuna - acceptable but nothing exciting) was the most lackluster portion of our meal. Considering rice composes about 50% of sushi, it was highly disappointing to find it overly mushy and over seasoned. It kind of ruined it for me. Factor in the high rice to filling ratio, I cannot recommend any sushi dish made here. This is rather unfortunate because sushi comprises at least a significant portion of the menu.  The only highlight of the meal was the salt and pepper squid. Melt-in-your-mouth tender pieces of squid with a delicate batter, this was the one dish that the hubs and I truly enjoyed.  Food service was surprisingly and perhaps questionably prompt. There was a small gap in service with our last dish but it wasn't too bad. It was unfortunate that the bar service was slower than expected and easily overwhelmed. After our meal, we just wanted to get the check processed and go. However, a loud obnoxious group of women (aka the skanky looking anti-MILFs who obviously collected club wristbands) completely commandeered her attention with to go orders. The two other bartenders were milling around but did not help her. So the hubs had to endure some random, potentially contagious woman's behind rubbing against his left leg while she took orders from other groups of people. He was highly grumpy after being mauled and ignored.  In reality, this joint rates about a 2.5 however I rounded up to a three based on the fact that there was 1 dish which was truly outstanding. However, given our experience, we are not likely to return. 3 starred review.",

We ate a good bunch of toro, which was great but be aware that it's about 18 bucks per piece of toro...not per order, but per piece. Ouch. Make sure you're prepared to drop some coin if you plan on having some good sashimi and even rolls, as we didn't see anything that was a particularly good deal (it's obviously the strip). If you're looking for a quality sushi meal and don't mind a 5-10 minute Uber/can ride there are several much cheaper options that cost about 1/2 the price for only a small decrease in quality. The ambiance is fine, albeit a little loud at times. I would go back.",

Located in the restaurant row connected to the Palazzo, this place is a delicious fusion of Japanese, Brazilian, Perivian and all things heavenly.  It's hard to believe I have not yet written a review, although technical I am an\"regular\" here!  This is my most frequently visited restaurant  when staying at the palazzo.  There are so many reasons why we Iove coming here, and here are just a few of the reasons why:  I. FOOD A. hamachi Kama!  Love this dish, it's my go-to dish for dinner.  Nicely grilled dish collar bone (Asians have a belief that the more movement in the muscle, the tastier the meat.  Fish collar bones are delicious because they are constantly blowing bubbles ;)  B. Robata (Japanese style charcoal BBQ)--anything cooked on that is good, from the mushrooms to the squid and the steaks...you can't go wrong!   C. The drinks! Everything from the caipirinhas (classic & Acai) to the Prosecco flavored with elderflower liqueur and lychee puree--the bartenders here set a high standard unmatched by many. If you have a choice get your drink made by Yaz.  His drinks are golden--I will happily drink anything he makes.  SERVICE The manager (Jeremy) recognizes us whenever we are there and we love that!    One waitress in particular, Tanice, makes us feel extra special because after meeting our family once she remembers us!  Even if she is not waiting on our table she comes by to say hello.  How superb is that? The service is one of the many reasons why we tell everyone about this restaurant and also keep on coming back!  We shall be back! :)",

One was for 75 dollars and one was for 85 dollars, we we went with the 85 dollars one.   You do have to sign an agreement which is kinda weird. And there is an 85 dollars coordinator charge. Super lame and expensive since it's just making a normal reservation and it's not like they coordinated anything for us. They only put our name down. But apparently it's for the personalized menus they made. If we knew they charged for that, we would've skip it . And there was also a typo on our menus that I only noticed after wards, it said course 4 twice on there. If I noticed that at the time of dinner and realized they charged us 85 dollars for it  I would've said something.  The food was really good though and 5 courses definitely filled us up.  My favorites: -yellowtail taqitos   -sea bass skewer  (best sea bass ever) -wagyu beef (cooked on a hot stone, suc h a fun experience and makes me want a hot stone) -samba lobster roll -lima roll (with shrimp and king crab) -salmon rolls   They did a good job at accommodating to a few individual's dietary restrictions. We had a vegetarian, pescatarian and non seafood eater in our group. And they made great accommodations for them all.   Note: bathroom is so freaken dark...the pods were not lit at all and I couldn't see anything in there.   Overall, great place for a huge dinner.",

We started off with the seaweed salad, which was honestly one of the best item we had during our visit. Three types of seaweed salad and very tasty! We then ordered the samba roll ( I believe that was the name) which had lobster. I must say I was disappointed by its size, the roll was very small. Robatayaki squid and mushrooms were good, however I was expecting a \"whole squid\" not \"cut out\" pieces of squid. We also had the seafood coconut stew which was flavorful, but too greasy overall.  The staff is awesome here and they brought us a complimentary dessert as my husband and I were having a celebration. They will absolutely take good care of you if you are looking for service. If you are looking for tasty, refreshing food, this may not be the place for you.",

Exceptional service, super fresh and delicious food, and a fun, high-energy environment.   Everything we ordered was GREAT, and our waiter was helpful in navigating the menu and offering recommendations. The menu offers Japanese, Brazilian, and Peruvian cuisine. Amazing mix.  Tuna Tataki - this was a unique twist on tuna tataki, with the tuna served wrapped in tatsoi (type of Asian greens) with asparagus, heart of palm, avocado and a crispy garlic citrus soy sauce. So good and so fresh, with a ton of different textures and flavors that worked really well together.  Yellowtail Tiradito - wish the portion was larger because this was so bomb. The yellowtail was extremely fresh, and the unique combination of jalapeno and lemongrass was unbelievably good and refreshing.  A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza - very decadent and hearty. It's served with a kabocha puree that's slightly sweet and mushy, but goes well with the crispy gyoza skin and beef. Make sure to dip in the shoyu sauce. Not a traditional gyoza, but still, very good. More sweet than savory.  Miso-marinated Sea Bass - we got this in the large plate, rather than the skewers. Served with roasted veggies. Fish was SO buttery and delicious. Not fishy at all. Even the veggies that were served with the fish were spectacular, roasted to perfection and great dipped in the miso sauce.  Ordered a few other items, but the above were most noteworthy. All of the sashimi cuts were SO fresh. Super impressed.   Opted for basic vodka sodas instead of any of the specialty drinks. Drinks could definitely have been stronger...much stronger.",

    "text": "Came in for dinner on a slow night, on the later side of the evening.  Lots of open tables and booths.  The hostess asked if we had reservations, we did not.  She tried to seat us at a little table.  Not a very nice table.  I asked for a booth.  She seemed hesitant to do so, then did.  Okay fine.  Once seated our waiter Joseph came over said he would return with water, Edamame and to look over the menu.  After he came back I asked for a large Kirin beer and large hot sake.  Come to find out, you can't just order a large hot sake like every other Japanese restaurant in America.  He explains to me I need to buy a bottle (Various sizes, all big bucks).  I can see where this is going, and just tell him we will stick with the beer.  I'm not paying $37.00 for a small bottle of sake.  At this point I can tell he's not loving us, and we are not loving him.  I asked if they have Albacore.   No, we don't.  We have blue fin tuna. The menu says $6.00?  How much do you get? $6.00 per piece.   I ordered (4) pieces, $24.00.  Fresh, yes.  Worth it, no!  I ordered one Spicy Tuna roll, $12.00.  It was small, and well chilled.  Even the rice.  Sushi rice should be warm.  My guess is that it was pre-made and refrigerated.  I decide to go with (2) large plates. MISO-MARINATED CHILEAN SEA BASS roasted organic vegetables and oshinko $29 CHICKEN TERIYAKI-SAMBA STYLE organic chicken, aji amarillo, purple potato mash, crispy onion $26.  The Miso Cod was good.  The Chicken was okay at best.  Purple potato mash was weird.  Neither dish came with rice.  Disappointing.  The hostess tries seating another couple at the same small table she tried to seat us at and they tell her they want a booth too.    Across from us is a booth with a older Asian business man with two women, a blond and a brunette.  High end escorts I presume.  I guess the booths are reserved for that clientele.  He drops the bill, and I see there's a $7.00 charge for the Edamame.  I point out to him we didn't order it, he brought it out with the water.  Confused, he said \"Well, you ate it\".  Yes, that's True.  Since you brought it out with the water, we just figured it was like bringing out some bread.  Neither of us requested this.  Just a guess, but I think they must do this to people all the time.    He had enough of us, and us of him.  He took off the Edamame, we paid the bill, left exactly 15%, and left.  We would never return to this restaurant nor would I recommend to friend or foe.  In the course of our three day stay, this was the only negative experience we encountered at the Palazzo.  What a shame, it was our last night.",

That is the one thing that is hard to come by when on the Las Vegas strip.  If I can take an Uber and Lyft and find something in the Asian off the strip joins, I'd prefer to do that.  However, at that point, the price is probably about the same unless going with a group of 4.    Service The customer service was up to par and definitely have no complaints about it.",

And OMG, the ribeye large plate was literally to die for, I wanted to drink the sauce. We ordered several sushi rolls too, which were all delightful pops of flavor and didn't need any soy sauce. Seaweed salad was also tasty. Finally for dessert, the green tea crunch bar was so different, sweet, crunchy and wonderful (my stomach is growling just thinking about it) and the Peruvian/Japanese donuts were very good. Also-we got the drink tree which allowed us to sample several signature cocktails in small glasses. Such a great restaurant, I will come back for sure on my next Vegas trip.",

The menu just blows your mind with Peruvian-Sushi fusion dishes.  There are so many excellent dishes I don't even know where to start.   The shrimp tempura appetizer left a memorable impression as did the pork belly.    The star dish had to be the miso-glazed sea bass skewers.  They were amazing and I could have made a meal out of just the skewers.   The nigiri was super fresh, well presented and a large variety.  I am not a big sushi roll fan but this place delivers some of the most inventive rolls I have experienced. Absolutely delicious.     We even indulged in desserts.  The chocolate ganache was so rich and flavorful.   I ordered the banana split which was weirdly wonderful.    Carmel soaked bananas with popcorn and the smoothest ice cream you have ever had.    The place was busy so the service was a bit slow but honestly we didn't mind as the atmosphere is so relaxed. Do bring your wallet, the meal is not going to be cheap but it will be memorable.

Here's what I got:  The Sasa Handroll - not the best thing to try to split with a friend as it's one roll with one open end, but we made it work.  It was full of shrimp tempura, quinoa, shishito, cilantro, red onion and spicy mayo - and absolutely delicious!  Wagyu Gyoza - similar to a potsticker, this is the most familiar type of food I chose, and very yummy.  What can go wrong with a tasty piece of Wagyu?  NOT MUCH!  Rock Shrimp Tempura - also something familiar, these were tossed in a spicy mayonnaise and utterly addicting!  Tonkotsu Ramen Bowl - OKAY, here's the deal.  If you want something comforting and delicious that will fill you up and make you feel fat and miserable but in the absolute BEST way possible - get this ramen!  Plenty here to split, which is what we did as we had all the other food to eat as well; however, it works perfectly as a stand-alone meal and is quite cozy, warm and verrrry indulgent.  An excellent start to our Vegas work trip!  Glad we went here; it's definitely a place I will recommend to others.",

    "text": "Here's some easy math:   Awesomeness = SUSHISAMBA = Japanese/Brazilian/Peruvian Fusion.  Yup.  I recently traveled to the Sin City for work and of course, had to try as many good restaurants as I could. While most offered decent food, they were definitely overpriced.  But SUSHISAMBA was simply awesome. My friend and I ordered four plates and they were the perfect amount of food for two ladies to share. More importantly, everything was fresh and delicious.  Here is what we gobbled down.  Sea bass and miso: OMG. The fish blew me away with its tenderness and deep flavor. The decorative Peruvian corn also added a nice touch to the dish. A must try.  Yellow tail jalapeno and lemongrass: Includes 4 pieces of sashimi. Pleasantly spicy with jalapeno, the fish was nicely chilled and tasted very refreshing.  Samba sushi assortment: Has 12 pieces, including 8 kinds of sashimi and one type of roll. Everything was very, again, FRESH. I loved how the rice, fish and all the ingredients melted in my mouth.  Yellowtail seviche: Wrapped in crispy tortillas and sprinkled with lime juice, the seviche tacos were a nice little summery treat in this boiling city.  What's better is that good food is not the only reason that I like this fusion restaurant.  Our waitress was nice and gave us good suggestions on what to order. My other colleague who came here with a big group also raved about the great service they received.  The ambiance was modern and romantic. I felt like I walked into a trendy, reddish dome, with interesting circular decor.  The bill? Certainly a splurge. But for the experience I had, it was well worth it.  Some final math: VISIT VEGAS = TRY SUSHISAMBA.",

    "text": "Wandered in here without a plan for a first time meet up.  Though my eyes were not necessarily on the food, I noted a few things, sitting at a table vs. sitting at the sushi bar: the emphasis was on the fusion foods (sushi menu was backpage) and the drink menu was bigger than the food menu. I agree with Bunny G. that no one bothered to explain anything about the menus.  Ordered their house ice tea which is a mint tea Arnold Palmer, served with lemon & lime wedges.  Very tasty & refreshing since I don't think I've ever had an Arnie with mint tea.  The edamame was standard fare, served cool with crushed rock salt sprinkled on top.  I ordered 2 rolls, shrimp tempura (6 pcs), and a spicy tuna (8 pcs).  The shrimp tempura was exactly that, no fuss, frills, standouts.  The spicy tuna, I think was just a tuna roll served with a squirt of sriracha.  Good thing I wasn't there for the food!  The decor & service were exceptional and it looked like there was a special/private dining area in the back.  Interesting decor that isn't particular of any single culture, or at least any that I know of.  There were these wooden chairs that looked to be carved out of giant coconuts but could really only seat an Ommpa Loompa.  Another strange touch, that doesn't quite work to me: The food menus were not on the small side, but the cover was like leather, as in, not self supporting.  The only way to read the menu, that didn't feel awkward, was to lay it on the table.  For some reason, I didn't want a leather menu touching my little appetizer plate.  It seems unsanitary.  Because the prices were so high, I rate the food a 2-2.5 stars, but the decor & service a solid 4 stars.  So, 3.33 stars, it is!",

We went with a group of 6 and the table was very comfy, we dined in a tapas style which is one of my favorite ways to go.  Here are some of the highlighted dishes.  Squid - this was the most tender piece of squid I have ever encountered it was seasoned perfectly with S&P and just melted in your mouth.  Pork belly Ramon soup - Oh my so tasty, large portion of pork belly, multiple mushroom varieties, bok choy, noodles and a spicy cilantro broth.  Yummy  Tuna Roll - with foie gras and caviar, small portion but so worth it, the fresh tuna mixed perfect with the warm foie and salty caviar.  Sea bass Kabobs - Just get them!!!  So buttery and fresh, they had a perfect taste and texture.  I would definitly suggest this place for groups getting ready for a big night out, they had a dj playing good music but not to loud, the lights were perfectly dimmed and the food and service was on point.

This is a miracle and a True relief and pleasure to anyone who has special dietary needs.  Not only was the service caring and impeccable-the food was fantastic and delicious for everyone in our party - those with special diets and those free of restrictions.

    "text": "A nice sushi restaurant with good ambiance, decent food, and quick service.  My friends wanted sushi and this was the closest sushi restaurant, so we indulged. When we opened the menu, we knew this was going to be an expensive place. I ordered the wagyu gyoza and a roll. The service was quick even with the business, so that was impressive.   I bit into the gyoza and it was mediocre -- I don't think the combination of flavor was good. The wagyu beef should've stood out in terms of flavor and texture, but the gyoza skin and the taste of the honey sauce and sweet potato masked all the goodness of the beef. For about $17, I don't think it was worth it. The sushi roll was pretty good, but it didn't stand out to me. Overall, for $30-40, I expected more. You might as well go to a buffet or a local sushi restaurant in your city/state.",

The best dining experience is giving your server a per person budget and selecting some of the things you really want. Family style. We went with 60 a person (x5) and had 4 courses which included rock shrimp, wagu gyoza and yellowtail taco appetizers, 5 sushi/ cooked rolls, sea bass and ribeye steak dinner with a mochi dessert.  I've eaten here multiple times and will say that this place is a GEM and an epic experience everytime. If you're into food, try the Peruvian Scallops appetizer and chocolate banana dessert (my favorite dessert). This place is tradition~~~  Last thing, sweet potato beer.",

Half the table decided to do a chef recommended tasting, and my half ordered off the menu due to diet restrictions.  Everyone loved everything they tried!  Must orders include: (1) the shrimp ceviche with plantains and passion fruit- amazing fruit flavor, generous sharable portion, and yummy plantains for scooping. (2) seabass skewers was the most tender fish I've ever had (the whole table's favorite). (3) salmon sushi was so delicious I ordered a second order (5) spicy tuna was melt in ur mouth deliciousness.  I really liked the mushroom tobanyaki (I LOVE mushrooms, esp different types), just wish it wasn't drowning in the sauce.   Despite all the food we had, we didnt have sticker shock when it came time for the bill.  Again the service here was outstanding and I can't recommend this place enough.  Be adventurous and order some stuff you've never tried before - this menu is not your typical american sushi.",

Those tables never filled up while we were sitting at the sushi bar. We had to actually walk to sushi bar ourselves and see if it was ok for us to sit . Then it wasn't self sitting , so we had to go back and tell the host that it's ok to sit at the bar. Then we had to wait over 10 min for anyone to even care that we were there . No server approached until I asked to order . Then the guy said I'm not your server . He went and called someone else who was the apparently \"the server\" but did nothing to really show he cares. He only took the order, and then he brought the check ... I liked their food too bad the service was bad and I paid $120 for 2 rolls, 2 appetizers and 2 drinks . I guess it's Vegas so I'll take that but I expect better service for a place with this   Update 7-2-19: the manager asked me to email so they can \"further discuss\" the issue . I am not sure what they want to discuss but it has been since 6-25-19 I have messaged them the same day , and a few days later again another message but nope ! No response what so ever. This shows they can care less for your satisfaction and all they do is reply on bad reviews to boost their rating on yelp . People beware of the horrible service !!!",

They boast an exotic sushi experience that combine Japanese, Brazilian and Peruvian food.  Located in Palazzo hotel, this place has modern decor that feels like a club. The staff were professional and attentive to serve you. I came for lunch on my special day and Rudy ( server) made sure my first experience in Sushi Samba in Vegas was phenomenal.  I visited their restaurant in NYC so many times years ago before they closed down.  I always love their food , drinks and their professional service.  Well Rudy, you had outdone yourself and made me your new loyal customer. Thank you.  The food were great and I really enjoyed my lunch. I definitely recommend to reserve your table for lunch or dinner through open table.  Hopefully they have new chef special menu that I could try next time.  Samba away , folks!!!",

    "text": "I love SUSHISAMBA! This restaurant is a must try, in my opinion, at least once when you are in Las Vegas. The atmosphere is electric to say the least.   I will start off by addressing my 4 stars. The 4 stars is for the wait that you MAY experience even with a reservation at night. I have been here on a couple of occasions where the wait is very long and it takes away from the experience and the deliciousness of the food. However, if I could only take .1 stars away thats what I would do.   A quick tip before I get into the food: come for Samba Hour its well worth it. The rolls on the Samba Hour menu I believe drop down to $6 each!!   If you are a first timer I recommend: the Samba Sashimi and Sea Bass. For the Samba Sashimi the experience is a 10/10. What you get is worth the price! It's 15 or 18 (I can't remember) pieces of sashimi and its amazing. The quality and taste alone is worth the flavor experience you get with it.   As for the Sea Bass just order it. No review needed just do it.   If you are worried about price, I would not recommend coming here. The prices can go up very quickly especially if you are really hungry. That being said I personally think the price to food/experience/location is very preferable and is definitely a go to restaurant in Vegas of mine.   The service has always been high quality and very friendly. The servers are quick and attentive. If you have a chance go try SUSHISAMBA!",

    "text": "I came with a large dinner group here last night for my first time, and I wasn't too impressed with some of the dishes, however I did really enjoy a couple of them- it was hit or miss.   The atmosphere has a party-club type vibe, and the interior is dark and spacious. Displayed on screens and on the walls in the restaurant, they were playing a very strange island tribal video that was somewhat off- putting. They served us waters and took our drink orders. I got a Berry Mash, which is a virgin cocktail consisting of muddled berries and sparkling water. I requested for light to no sweetness (since it didn't mention any sweetener in the ingredients, but it came out way too sweet). For $10, I definitely don't think this drink is worth the price since there is no alcohol. My co-workers ordered a couple of old fashioned cocktails, and they said it was watered down and came with too much ice- mediocre at best. However, my other co-worker really liked his Samba Juice.   For appetizers, we got two types of edamame, one seasoned with sea salt and the other one with a spicy/sweet sauce, which I both enjoyed. I also had the Japanese A5 Magyu Beef Gyoza, which was surprisingly really good and unique- as if a good burger meets a dumpling. It came with a yummy puree and dipping sauce.   For the main dish, we got the Chilean Sea Bass cooked in Miso. The fish came out on grilled skewers. The fish was well seasoned, smokey flavored, and very moist, cooked well. I loved the Peruvian corn, it was a large serving of al-dente chewy corn that was seasoned well with a sweet light sauce and a smokiness like the fish.   The actual sushi rolls itself were the most disappointing, granted I didn't order the Nigiri or Shashimi that I usually like. The Samba Strip Roll had too much mayo sauce which ruined the lobster, and the whole roll just didn't work well together. I also feel like the fancy little lotus root with it just was for decoration. The Lima Roll was not very appetizing, and the topping was overly salty and spicy. We also got another unknown shrimp tempura roll, that was just bland. It's interesting how this place is called sushi samba, but my least favorite thing was the sushi.   Highlights- the Miso Chilean Sea Bass, Peruvian Corn, and the Japanese A5 Magyu Beef Gyoza",

Management should take note this girl is an awesome representative of Sushi Samba. This was on a Saturday night, so I missed the happy hour which is a must on other nights, ( both late and afternoon happy hours). Nevertheless, the food and drinks were excellent and I can't wait to revisit.  Thank Tiffany for being such a great help even even though it was so late. She did an excellent job, along with the entire staff.",

When you're in Vegas and have a show booked in an hour and a half, sometime fast is good! The fish was fresh and so tasty. The vibe was casual and friendly with lively music in the background.   The star of the meal was the sashimi. The yellowtail with jalapeno and lemongrass was one of the best I've had. The combination of the flavors was addictive; we had to have more. The rolls were excellent. Perfect size and great amount of fish. San Paou and Lima rolls are a must try. I love a simple roll that bursts with flavor when you bite in.   The Japanese and Peruvian influences in the food are so unique. I can't wait to try more of their menu and other locations....",

This was one of the most delicious dinners I have had here in Vegas by far. I ordered a few things off the menu as well, some rolls, appetizers and drinks. Everything was more than amazing. You can tell all the food and drinks had a lot of attention to detail.   The service was also another part to make this dinner. Server was amazing and we also had someone give us a little demo since it was our first time trying the waygu beef entree. He explained everything very well, told us the best ways to eat it. So much fun! They even did something special for my friends birthday with a dessert.   If you're in the mood to splurge a little please give this place a try! You won't be disappointed",

So here you have Sushi+Samba... what in heavens can go wrong? Culinary orgasm for sure. I booked a table for 4, but my buddies stood me up, so I went alone.A super friendly and beautiful Asian-American young lady took me to the sushi bar, and in a matter of seconds an even more beautiful mixed-Asian waitress showed up. If the food is any good this place is paradise! Anyway, I had to go exotic, so I ordered two appetizers (Carnaval= shrimp, avocado, yellowtail tartar, crispy rice paper and the Samba Strip = Maine lobster, mango, tomato, chive, crispy rice, soy paper, peanut curry) and a \"half\" main dish (Moqueca Mista = shrimp, squid, sea bass and crayfish with coconut milk, roasted cashew, dende oil, chimichurri rice ... this is a very typical Brazilian dish)  The moment I started savoring the spices, the seafood, the dende oil... I was taken back to Bahia, incredible beaches, sea-breeze, mulatas in tiny bikinis... I had to snap back in order to continue my sensory trip to food nirvana.  Before they rate my review XXX and ban it from Yelp, I will summarize: just go, order without fear, enjoy the smells and tastes (and the view), go exotic, try \"positions\" you never dared before.  Look, once you go \"sushi+Brazil\" you never go back.  Cheers!",

The kanpachi and octopus (not on the menu) tiraditos were both pleasant surprises! Very fresh tasting and the flavors were vibrant. It goes without saying that the seabass robata was excellent...the fish was juicy and succulent. The pork belly was also great! The Pacific and BoBo Brazil rolls were out of this world....interesting mixes of ingredients and flavors that all somehow worked together.",

The server came and gave us a grand introduction and said the chef will put together a fantastic menu for us. Didn't tell us what was going to be on the menu at all.  But we figured, we'd let the experts order for us.  WRONG thing to do.  They were suppose to blow my mind or at least convince me I need to return but instead, they made sure I will never come back!!!  Best thing served was the kobe beef.  Potstickers were decent.  The sushi sample they gave us were garbage and we didn't even finish it.  (Hate soy paper.  If you don't like seaweed then you shouldn't order sushi).  Duck and mushroom clay pot was good but duck was still on the fatty side.  The grilled/yakatori platter came with chicken, beef, seabass, asparagus.  Non grilled items included the corn, pork belly and sea scallops.  The beef and chicken was worse than some take out a teriyaki express.  The sauce was overly sweet and meat was over cooked!!  Everything was cold when they brought it out.  Scallops was the best in the platter.  I loved the dining atmosphere and the awesome electronica music.  Food just wasn't worth the money.  BOOOOO",

Overall, the food was delicious and because they have a sushi, peruvian, and brazilian theme it was all new and interesting. We had two roles which were excellent, tempura which tasted like standard yummy tempura, and something else that I remember being good as well. Had some cocktails throughout dinner which were all strong and very tasty. We were very pleased with our splurge evening.  The only reason that I gave 4 instead of 5 stars is that the servings are very small for the price. I'm not a big eater but that night we ended up ordering more food because we simply weren't full with our two roles and tempura. For the price, I think we should have gotten a bit more.",

    "text": "Long overdue review.  I really was disappointed because my Mom's side of the family are Asian immigrants to Brazil who had lived in South America for decades. I really thought this was going to be Brazilian style Sushi, but it wasn't. A lot of people don't know this, but Brazil has the 3rd largest population of Asians outside of Asia.  1st being the USA, 2nd being Canada, and 3rd being Brazil.  Did you also know that Brazil has more Japanese residents than the United States? So, I was very excited that a place like this opened up.   I am a big fan of \"fusion sushi\".  I love new and creative twists on the oldschool style maki, but Sushisamba just doesn't do it as well as other sushi restaurants. Sushi is really really popular in Brazil.  And unlike Americans, the Brazilian sushi houses tend to be very traditional. That means that they don't really like California rolls or other types of fusion sushi that is popular in America.  But, the menu here is more similar to Ichiro Mashita's American style sushi.   Sushisamba prides themselves on having \"fresh fish\", that is of higher quality than smaller sushi restaurants and that is their justification for charging higher prices. But, even places like Sushi Bomb(North West), Sushi on Rainbow(Koreatown), Sushi Twister(Boulder Highway) and even the overrated Goyemon(Southwest) have fresh fish flown in everyday, and some of these places even keep the fish alive in tanks until the day of serving. And they only charge a fraction of what this place does. You know, even the Edomaezushi style Kabuto restaurant's prices are lower than this place.    I guess I'm just really upset over the fact that they hyped this place up as a Brazilian-Japanese style restaurant and it wasn't any of that. It wasn't Brazilian cuisine and it really wasn't authentic Japanese cuisine. And, I just recently found out that the owner of this place is a guy named Matthew Johnson. That doesn't sound Brazilian or Japanese to me.   You know how a lot of full-blooded Japanese yelpers always complain about how they hate Sushi bars that are owned and operated by non-Japanese Asians and have Latino cooks? Yet, this place is owned by a White man from New York City and we don't find those same Japanese Yelpers complaining? Why is that? Someone explain that to me? Where is Alex S and Hootie B??",

We went straight for the $16 Chilean seabass bento box, which was the best deal on the lunch menu. It came with miso soup, field green salad, tuna roll and oshinko pickles.   The three skewers of miso glazed seabass, along with all the sides, was a nice amount of food (though could've been a little small for a big appetite), but I seriously could have eaten three more skewers. The seabass was amazing! That miso marinade was to die for. I suppose I could've gotten the entree portion, but for lunch, it was perfect. Plus, $29 is a bit much to spend on a lunch entree. There were six tuna rolls, so that also made the bento filling.  The funky decor was really cool, and reminded me a little of Blowfish in the bay area -- but much bigger and with Latin influences intertwined. The staff was awesome, and the food came out quick. We were in and out in a flash, and back to the pool before our guys even missed us.",

Ironically I think the rolls and some of the sushi are the weakest things on their menu but the sashimi we got was super fresh. Also, get the seaweed sampler. I dont know why but I thought it was cool how you can get a plate with all kinds of different seaweed.  The bartenders at the little bar at the entrance also know whats up and the Dominican dude can pretty much mix up whatever drink you want.  The only reason i'm not giving this place 5 stars is b/c their rolls were pretty bland and not super imaginative.   Sushi samba is a pretty safe bet for dinner, regardless of who is in your party. They'll be satisfied. Unless they suck.",

    "text": "It's interesting that back home, I partake in sushi once or twice a week without fail  ... and yet in Vegas, while staying in a hotel where it seems every celebrity chef has at least one restaurant (and in many cases two)... I'm drawn to a \"sushi\" place once again.    Nonetheless, the Brazilian beats and atmosphere from the outside looking in made SUSHISAMBA seem different, and well worth trying.   So we did.  SUSHISAMBA is a Japanese/Brazilian/Peruvian fusion restaurant.  Hence the aforementioned \"beats.\"   The visuals of this place are more \"club\" than restaurant, both from a lighting/decor perspective, as well as the patrons drinking around the bar.    That being said, as we were seated at our table, the fusion influences did highlight how somewhat boring and \"polite\" the sushi places I normally frequent actually are.  SUSHISAMBA has a much more vibrant atmosphere.  Regardless, I was in the mood for sushi, so I stayed within that zone on the menu.   My dinner companion fears the stuff... which made this place perfect.  I could indulge, while she self-cooked meat on a ultra hot stone in front of her (yes, that is an option).    Thus, my sashimi/sushi/roll selection was served before me with zero guilt .  Everything either of us ordered was very good.  No complaints on the quality whatsoever.  The only negatives are repeated from what other reviewers have mentioned:  --  if you order outside of the Japanese realm, the price seems to go way up.  If you treat it as a sushi restaurant, the price is in line, even for Vegas.    -- Again, outside of the \"sushi\" realm, portion size could very well disappoint.   --  The tables can feel a little too close for comfort with your neighbors.  But this varies depending on where you are seated.    Overall, I am a fan of the traditional sushi-restaurant  fare served here, because it trumps the overall experience I have elsewhere -- the quality is fine, the atmosphere is more fun.    Venturing beyond that will no doubt deliver quality, but you may end up needing to order more than expected to be satisfied, and end up with a much lighter wallet.

We were on the fence on doing the omakase..the waiter was nice enough to offer his own kinda of omakase which would've taken less time.  He said if we went the chef's route that dinner would be over 2 hours.  But alas we went w/ a bunch of different rolls instead.  I can't remember the names off the top of my head but I favs were definitely the toro roll ($25) and the raw thinly sliced kobe beef roll.   I'd like to go back here w/ a group of people.",

    "text": "Sushi Samba has been a hit or miss with yelpers, and here's my chance to check them out!  Featuring a special \"Election Day Menu\" with specialty cocktails and cheap appetizers, it was a perfect opportunity!  Drinks on the menu: * Obamarama (blue) for $11 \"Svedka Citron, blue curacao apple liqueur, guava, blueberry\" - Really good the first time around. Pleasant to look at and just tasty-good.  The guys and gals enjoyed this drink.  The second time I ordered it, there was way too much alcohol though, and not in a good way.  A good cocktail should be enjoyable to drink; I passed the second one off.  * Maverick (red) for $11 \"Pearl Vodka, freshly muddled strawberries, orange liqueur, lime, guava\" - Served in a martini glass, so a bit more delicate to drink.  Pretty tasty as well. I enjoyed it.  Bites to eat: * Shishito Peppers ($2) \"grilled spicy peppers, sea salt and lemon\" - They give you a bunch of these peppers on a plate, and it was okay for me.  I tried one and found that to be good enough.  Didn't really care for more.  * Organic Chicken Aji Amarillo Anticucho ($2) - I found the chicken to be okay, but really enjoyed the Peruvian corn that came with the dish.  That was the best part of it.  Our order had one skewer of chicken, but the party next to us had two? Hmm...   * Spicy Crunchy Tuna Roll ($3) - Really good roll!  I liked this a lot and ordered myself another.  I like how they do their spicy sauce here; it's more mayonnaise-based.  And the slight crunch is nice too.  * Salmon Avocado Roll ($3) - Pretty simple roll with just salmon and avocado.  But it was fresh fish and good.  I'm sad I didn't order more.  * Mini Chicharron de Calamar ($3) \"cornmeal crusted calamari with tamarind sauce, tomato salsa & plantain\" - Our friend's order came out soggy, so they thought it was gross.  Ours had a better crunch on it, so it tasted better.  It wasn't particularly exceptional, it was okay.  I don't remember any plantain in my dish though.    * Japanese Chicken Wings ($4) \"teriyaki and sesame\" - It's hard to go wrong with teriyaki chicken wings, right?  Good, but messy.  * Chilled Oyster Sampler ($4) \"ponzu jelly & tobiko with three oysters\" - Really fresh oysters with an interesting ponzu jelly.  We were supposed to get another order before we left, so I missed out on more!  Next time!  * Mini Yellowtail Seviche ($4) \"ginger garlic and soy\" - Reminded me of Hawaiian poke with the dressing.  It was good with the red onions mixed in there, more poke-like than ceviche-like though.  * Crispy Yellowtail Taquitos ($4) \"shiso, avocado, roasted corn miso and spicy aji panca sauce\" a\" Two different sauces to put over the taquitos, and it was good.  Very messy though as it broke apart after the first bite and was dripping all over my hands.  Our order came with two taquitos, but when our friend ordered it, he only got one!  * Rosca ($9) \"homemade doughnuts with hazelnut chocolate dipping sauce\" a\" Recommended by our bartender/waitress as her favorite dessert.  Four doughnut holes arrived and they were just okay.  Disappointing for us, and we wished we had chosen another dessert instead.  We spent the whole time at the bar because there was standing room only at this event.  So, the girl making our drinks also served us.  She was busy but tried her best to make our drinks were full and our orders were in.  (Our drinks were good for the most part except for that second Obamarama we ordered.  But hey, some people like more alcohol in their cocktails!)  I had a bigger problem with the kitchen output and their consistency.  With certain orders coming out, sometimes you got two of something and other times you got one.  Our friend mentioned that we got more sushi in our order than when he ordered it.  (Makes you wonder what happened to the other pieces.)  Overall, we had a decent experience at Sushi Samba.  You definitely can't beat the price and the atmosphere is casual, which is nice alternative at a strip hotel.  3.5 stars.  They also offer a happy hour (Sunday through Thursday from 4 to 7 pm, and then a reverse happy hour from 10 pm to close), available in the bar area only.  (Pics posted, of course!)",

    "text": "My girlfriend and I stayed at the Venetian and came here after watching Cirque du Soliel: Zarkana at Aria on 05-11-14. I found this restaurant on Yelp before we came. I absolutely love sushi and she hates it. We both love Texas de Brazil so I figured a good compromise would be a churrascaria crossed with a sushi bar so we picked Sushi Samba. I always like to find the most expensive roll at sushi bars and try it so I picked the SAO PAULO for $24. It had scallops, masago, red onion, tuna, salmon, shrimp, yellowtail, avocado, truffle, hacho miso soy, chive oil inside. To be honest the red onion over powered the flavor of every other ingredient and kind of ruined it for me. This is coming from someone that loves onions too. If I come back I'll probably ask them to cut that out when I order. I also ordered a generic spicy tuna roll. For our two sharable sides we ordered Purple Potato Mash and Peruvian Corn. The two sides were the best thing at this restaurant. The Purple Potato Mash had a rich buttery taste and creamy texture that melted in my mouth. The Peruvian Corn had a perfect amount of sweetness and the texture was lightly firm just the way I like. The real downside of the meal though is that my girlfriend decided to order the Berkshire Pork Belly rather than the lamb chops she was thinking about. I asked if she was sure she wanted that and she said yes. I neglected to mention to her that Pork Belly is literally a seared section of fat. She was not pleased, but didn't want to order anything else when her food arrived. My girlfriend was actually quite content with the Purple Potato Mash and Peruvian Corn. Overall the experience was pretty good except for the group of 3 drunk Russian speaking call girls (assuming) seated next to us that were intent on yelling over the music the entire time they were there instead of leaning in to hear one another. But, hey if you aren't hearing a drunk person screaming in another language next to you at most of the places you're at then you aren't experiencing Vegas the right way. Ha!",

Our reservation was for 11:30PM and due to us trying to find their location, we unfortunately was late. We arrived at about 11:52PM and went straight to the hostess, where she was very nice and stylish if I might add. She relayed to us that it was ok that we were late because they're open till 1AM anyway. Her reassurance helped us to calm down, because we both like to be punctual. For that, I am grateful!  Our experience on the dining side of it all was beyond words exceptional. Our server was Tee, she definitely was enthusiastic about being our server. Others came to drop our plates off but she mainly catered to us from beginning to end. She started us off with drinks and we never once had to ask for a refill she always was alert. We didn't know what to get so she offered her favorites and personal suggestions. We indulged in Crispy Hokkaido Scallops and Agedashi Tofu which is Tempura style Tofu. Being from Hawai'i, we both love RICE! So this fit us perfectly! We had a roll each of Rainbow Dragon and a Lima roll! Simple yet tasty, perfect for any occasion. We had dessert and we had a Samba Split which was AMAZINGGGG!!! I had on the side some Mochi Ice Cream and I couldn't stop eating on both dishes! My Boyfriend definitely loved the Samba Split because of the caramelized banana's and the doce de leite Ice cream together and caramel popcorn; my favorite part of it was the coconut flan and the Japanese whisky whipped cream together and altogether was phenomenal experience.  Ambiance was very quaint but vivid; artistry was displayed very nicely. Lights were dimmed so it made the experience very more intimate which I enjoyed. I would recommend everyone to go here for any reason very good prices for good portions!",

Matt was super knowledgeable, efficient, and friendly. he even offered to get us into some clubs that night b/c he was heading out to some places after work! haha   on to the food and drink...5 girls + 1 cocktail tree = trouble haha. the cocktail tree comes with a total of 15 oversized shots of specialty drinks. we chose 3 different flavors - a mango/rum, cucumber/vodka, and soju mix. all 3 were def really good and even though it doesnt taste like much alcohol, it totally sneaks up on you haha. for my dinner, i ordered 2 rolls - the maya (their version of a CA roll) and the capoiera (their version of a soft shell crab roll) - both were yummy and it was just enough food to leave me satisfied but not overly full.   yes this place is more on the expensive side, but it's vegas...what else do you expect. my portion alone was $50 but i didnt mind paying so much since the food was delicious, service was impeccable, and the atmosphere was super fun! oh and not to mention that we were able to get our desserts comped (coconut soup and chocolate banana cake were both yummy) :)",

    "text": "I recently had one of the best meals of my life at SushiSamba. I was visiting Vegas on my own and decided to treat myself to a dinner at this restaurant that I used to love in Chicago, before it shut down (sadly). It had been so long that I really got to try a lot of new things on the menu and I was in love with all of them.  I started out with a glass of sparkling rose because I'm classy like that. Managers Michael and Jeremy gave me a primo spot to sip my bubbles and watch the fabulous crowd pour in for the dinner service. They also handed me a beautiful taster of their cucumber cocktail, which was fantastic.   Next Jeremy brought me over one of the yellow tail taquitos, which had a crisp shell and a flavorful foam to spoon on top. It was a great amuse bouche. Along with that, I ordered the Wagyu beef gyoza. The beef just melted in your mouth. It was so good. I tried to slow myself down to savor every bite of the tender meat in the dumplings. The sauce that came with them was also an integral part of their savory goodness. I think I could eat those dumplings every day until the day I die and still ask for them in heaven (or hell, depending on where I end up).   The next dish I ordered was the Yamato sushi, which sounded like the absolute most decadent sushi roll I could ever possibly order. And it was. And I loved it. Starting with white sushi rice, topped with flavorful fresh tuna, the smallest most perfect piece of foie gras, a dot of caviar, and topped with gold flake. I mean come on. I felt like the Queen of Sheba! Each bite was a beautiful rich, even slightly sweet (from the sauce) morsel. It felt light and sinful at the same time.  Then, Michael stopped by to check on me and suggested I order the Sea Bass Robata. Two skewers of meaty sea bass grilled with a delicious miso sauce. They were the perfect bite to pair with the giant Peruvian corn kernels served on the side. And I ordered mashed purple potatoes to top off the meal. Everything was cooked to perfection. I just felt so grateful and happy to be there.  When it came time for dessert, I was so full that all I wanted was coffee. So I ordered an espresso with a single scoop of chocolate ice cream, which was a great finish to an amazing meal. Then Michael and Jeremy brought me one more surprise: an ice cream pop. Mango ice cream covered with a white chocolate shell and graham cracker.  Everything was just awesome. Michael and Jeremy did a great job, as did my server, also named Michael. Amazing dinner in a really fun city. Beautiful decor. They really made me feel right at home!",

Not one thing we ordered was good. We had better Asian food and sushi far off the strip at much more reasonable prices with much better customer service. The sushi we received here was VERY dried out, tough, and fishy. So disappointing for a 4.5 star, pricey Las Vegas strip restaurant. Also, we waited over 30 minutes to be seated when more than half the dining room was empty. Then, we were seated along the rail behind the actual sushi bar. These seats were uncomfortable and I had to put my purse on the nasty floor because the stools we sat on had no place in which to hang it. We HIGHLY recommend you look elsewhere for good food in Las Vegas!",

Was told the duck breast took time but the meat was almost raw and chewy. So was the medium rare filet. Flavor wad on the light side and I would have expected sauces with full flavors such as cherry vinaigrette reduction to go with the duck or the filet mignon. Maybe grilling is not their specialty.",

We ordered lemonades, a mushroom appetizer and a 15 piece sashimi chef's choice platter. The sushi was of okay quality, but nothing particularly special. I found the menu somewhat limited and we settled on what we ordered. The presentation was lovely and the ambiance very cool. Our server was very attentive and very sweet. We can throw down sushi, and we were still hungry and wanting more, but really didn't see anything else on the menu that caught our attention. Ee had hoped to find a go to sushi place but will keep looking. We are very spoiled living in the east coast. The drink menu looked interesting. It seemed to be a really cool bar that also served sushi.",

We were offered the menu but also the waiter recommended we do a tasting, assuring the price would stay very reasonable. We went with the tasting. The server checked on any dietary restrictions (!!!) which was my first experience of this in Las Vegas! I typically eat a diet free of most meat (minus fish) and no dairy. But, being in Vegas I let the dairy slide. The server recognized my meat preference and brought something completely different and still amazing when he offered other meats to the group. Another member didn't eat rice/noodles and he accommodated that as well! For that alone... I give this place five stars (I wish I could give more!) The servers and staff at the restaurant seem to work well together. A group came in loud and rowdy after our group. Among many things, the people banged the table, chanted Trump, and cursed a storm in an otherwise chill restaurant. The team came together and asked them to bring it down, took steps to minimize the potential damage (broken glassware, etc) and finally removed a member of the group. Had we not sat next to them, I'm not sure we'd know how much the team quietly took care of the problem... all while taking care of our group and others around us. The food is incredible! The staff were incredible! I highly recommend and will be coming back when I visit Vegas again!",

    "text": "On a hungry sunday night we stumbled toward this oasis of fish, beats, and peeps.   Started off with a yellow tail taco that was the perfect mix of savory, spicy, and scrumptious. Next was a wagyu beef gyoza that was super juicy on a bed of pumpkin puree that offset the fatty gyoza incredibly well.   For the rolls we got the neo tokyo which had a decent amount of fish and was quite tasty. The el topo (or something like that) had an interesting concept with fried onions, melted mozzarella, and salmon, but was probably the most \"meh\" dish of the night since the fried onion took over the taste of the roll and the salmon was cooked--it was more like a baked salmon dish with lotsa cheese than a fresh sushi roll.   The winner of the night, however, was certainly the yamato. Decadent in its description and decadent in execution the buttery beef created a wonderful texture as the foie gras melted on the tongue. My friend liked it so much that he ordered a whole second roll for himself. If I wasn't so full I would have been tempted to do the same.   All in all great service and for 40ish bucks a great great meal in vegas.",

I tried a little bit of everything (and racked up a great bill for it) with hot and cold items, but out of it all I would stray from some of the cheaper rolls and stick with their signature items. I didn't have much that I didn't like and I didn't feel rushed, I sat at the bar and people watched, there were a large number of post Cirque show watchers that came by.   An interesting mix of people, but nothing out of the usual for Las Vegas. I would suggest to sit at the bar because it's quicker for many things - and the bartenders are excellent here. Multitaskers to the max here.   The fusion is here, but I tasted less of the Brazilian side of here and more of a French european flavor. Still - worth checking out.   So when next walking through the shops of the Venetian, make a stop at Sushisamba - and maybe the Hawaiian Cookie Company cause they're a great post dinner snack.  Enjoy!",

It's similar to the one served at Din Tai Fung (made with pear vodka and st. Germaine) - DELISH!  Their food, on the other hand, wasn't as phenomenal. Everything was mediocre. Nothing stood out. The fries were diff, I liked the addition of honey but for $6...I'm not sure I'd order it again. The pork belly slider was yummy but again, not sure it's worth $5 a pop.

The staff was flat and at times clueless but it was more than that. The vibe of MiamiDromo or NYC7 just did not exist here. It was more of a restaurant that served average sushi, steaks and fish with a Japanese, Brazilian and Peruvian influence. The flavors that I have come to know and expect were just missing. The Yellowtail Tiradito with jalapeno and lemon grass had no pop, no heat, as were the rest of the rolls. I am not saying I am giving up on this place and I will definitely visit NYC and Miami again, I just hope they find their groove here.",

I wasn't very hungry so I only ordered the yellowtail one, although I reeeally wanted to order the sampler to try all of them. We sat at the sushi bar to check out the variety and quality of fish, which was alright. The variety was the typical sushi staples and not much more. This didn't really seem like a place to get sashimi or plain sushi so we ordered rolls instead. I thought the Brazilian and Japanese fusion was very interesting. I had the halibut skewer which had a miso sauce and brazilian corn on the side. Pretty tasty but maybe a little overpriced. The Ishiyaki smelled really good but I didn't want to smell so we didn't get it. I don't know why we ordered a kobe roll when it's not real kobe beef and the portion is so thin and small that you can't even taste it. The service was fast and friendly. We received our food quickly, the place was clean, nice atmosphere, and overall enjoyable. I wouldn't rave about this place, but I wouldn't mind coming here again to try more things on the menu. I don't think I would recommend this as a sushi place, but more for their other items like robata (small selection) and Ishiyaki.",

Service is really good here. Now the food, just great. We got the appetizer with salted bean, tempera bean, and grilled jalapeno. The beans taste good. The jalapeno wasn't spicy, but had a very sourish/\"pickle\" taste. It's different. We ordered a samba roll. That was really good. Crunchy, tasteful, and delicious. We ordered the tiger shrimp and sea bass. Both came with peruvian corn. It was my first time having peruvian corn. It is good. It's chewy and reminds me of \"sticky\" corn but larger size. The sea bass was very good. The meat was soft and sweet and melts in your mouth. It had a teriyaki flavor I thought. The shrimps was very good too. Both tasted very fresh, especially the shrimp. It smells like the ocean. We also ordered fried calamari. The calamari has a tangy sauce poured on top with mixture vegetable including good tomatoes and sweet plantains. They brought out warm banana chocolate cake for me. The dessert is delicious. Ice cream and a crunchy chocolate piece on top of warm chocolate cake in syrup with couple strip of fried banana. Just delicious. All the food were brought out in a very good presentation. The dishes are pricey. But if you want to eat fresh and good quality food, you should come to this place.",

I ordered the pork gyozas (and the kabocha pumpkin puree underneath was a really nice touch). The gyozas were realllly really good, I still think about them. I also ordered the green envy rolls (tuna, salmon, asparagus, wasabi pea crust with a lime mayo) and although it was good, it wasn't as outstanding as the gyozas. Unfortunately I did not yelp before going, so did not get to try out the fruity drinks that everybody's raving about (sad face). I did share the chocolate fondue with a friend, and it came with the chocolate already melted with no heat element under it, so we took it as a sign that we had to eat it quickly. The dipping mediums were: coconut marshmallows, Japanese rice crispies, passion fruit cake, chocolate brownie, fruits, and green tea ice cream. Overall, I really liked the surroundings, I did feel like it matched up to the Vegas environment. It was definitely a fun place for dinner before a night out!",

I had a quick low key meal here at the bar so I cannot really speak to the actual decor of this restaurant. I ordered some sashimi (toro & unagi)...both were good but the unagi was so delicious I ordered another piece. I had the Neo Tokyo Roll as well and while it may not have been anything \"super fancy\" I thought it was tasty and would have gladly eaten another piece or two. I also had a cocktail (a strawberry martini type thing) which I also thought was very tasty - very fresh! I would gladly go back to SS.",

I think they even turned the music down when they realized how good we were at shouting.  Its dark and trendy, but not uncomfortable.  The food was good but nothing blew me out of the water.  The waitstaff is very helpful and will even order for you if you let them know your budget and what type of things you'd like.",

    "text": "We stayed at the Venetian and Palazzo over the weekend. It took us about an hour to decide on which restaurant in the Palazzo to dine at....because man are the restaurants SUPER PRICEY. Since we had friends that had to catch a flight we had to eat in the Palazzo so we decided on this place for a group of 9.  This place blends Japanese, Brazilian, and Peruvian cuisine....while it sounds like a great idea (never heard of such an Asian Fusion Combo)....I think this place tries way to hard to be different. The only thing that I really liked was the grilled sea bass....super yummy but it still was $16 for two mini skewers. It came with Peruvian corn which sounded interesting....but turned out to be huge corn kettles that tasted like buttered lima beans....yucko!!! As far as the sushi I tried about 5 of the 10 rolls they had. Wasn't too impressed with any of them. They looked pretty and all....but weren't so yummy. I tried a few other dishes too....it just seemed like they were blending unique flavors that just didn't blend well together. The few things preventing me from giving this place 2 stars was the great service (note: they do get 20% tip for groups.....so I do expect top quality service), cool ambiance, and hot guys. Check out the break down below:  2 STARS - FOOD (Overall disappointing)....EXCEPT FOR THESEABASS  2 STARS - PRICE (Expect to pay $40 - $100 per person if you want to get full) 2 STARS - PORTIONS (I left still a bit hungry) 4 STARS - ATMOSPHERE 5 STARS - SERVICE (Really friendly waitress) 5 STARS - HOT WORKERS!!! (seriously...do you have to be a model to work here....there was lots of eye candy dressed in all black) __________________________________  JUST 3 STARS ALL IN ALL....OVERALL DON'T REALLY RECOMMEND IT HERE IF YOU ARE STRAPPED ON CASH....UR PROBABLY BETTER OFF AT A BUFFET ON THE STRIP IF YOU WANNA GET YOUR MONEY'S WORTH. BUT IF YOU HAVE MONEY TO BLOW....THIS IS A HAPPENING PLACE.",

    "text": "I have to say that I was really interested to dine here. I'd heard about the outpost in NYC and since I was in Vegas and heard that there was a location there now, I wanted to try. And the experience...it kinda lived up to the hype. The food - it was very tasty. The sushi that I had...and I had quite a bit...was fresh and good. And they offered a couple of different sushi options that I hadnt seen at other sushi restaurants. The menu was quite interesting. If you dont know about the concept, its japanese and south american & latin american fusion. And I think it pairs together very well. For the quality...I thought the prices were set accordingly. The ambiance - very hip...very cool. The vibe of the place is incredible and you just get that feel that youre in a chic and sexy place. The music, the decor, the servers...its all there. The bar area in the front is very accommodating and there are large tables and booths set up for large groups as well. So why only three stars...? The service. Now I know you cant always judge a place completely on one visit, but the service was very suspect here. Now, I should have known better than to expect great service from a bar seat for dinner...however, it was a slow night there, so I thought it would be decent at least...and it was just barely that. Slow...slow...slow. And my bartender/server just seemed not aware of everything that was going on. Bringing me incorrect sushi order at first, then a incorrect drink order, then completely mischarging the order of the gentleman next to me. And when all this was happening, the managers just seemed to be too concerned about a large birthday party of ladies than what was going on with the gentleman order and bill or my incorrect orders. I think this place probably still does very well cause its a cool spot with a great location inside the Palazzo...but service is very important. I will go back again and hope that my service experience will be different next time.",

    "text": "I'm not a sushi purist, I love the fusion crap :)  I would give them 4 stars but they ran out of King crab.  How do you run out of something that makes up the base for many different items/rolls u serve.  We ordered something called the Yamato roll which was pretty good except for the fact that it was $19 for 3 pieces.  It was the only roll that didn't have the standard 5-6 pieces.  For that much money I was expecting much more pop.  I love anything with Foie Gras so I may have liked the Yamato roll more than I should've.  However, if you don't like Foie Gras skip it and get something else.  The Miso Seabass was fantastic just like the waiter described.  What bothers me is that they keep telling you how little the portions are AFTER u order the dish which makes u order it twice or more  if you're with two plus people.  The Miso Seabass was like $16 for ONE skewer.  The food is good but be warned if you want to leave full you will spend a lot of money.  Good thing it was comped thanks to my buddy.  PS  The Chef's Sushi/Sashime does not come with straight Sashime.  It was one sushi roll with some Nigiri.",

I loved the grilled sea bass and the peruvian corn.  This item is a must have!  I would recommend that they move their smaller tables a little further away from each other to accommodate people who need to leave the table.  They were pretty close to one another.  I could see how other customers might get annoyed by having someone seated so close to you.  Other than that I loved the whole Asian Fusion vibe at the the Sushi Samba!",

So now that said, we decided to have dinner at Sushi Samba and made a reservation and upon arriving were promptly seated.   Waiter suggested we do the chef style ordering where you tell them how much you want to spend per person and the chef creates the courses.   We started with some appetizers including the tuna tacos, edemame, and other stuff and we honestly received maybe 7-8 small items total. I must agree with others on Yelp, that you do not get a lot of food for what you pay and I would grade the sushi at  7.5/10.   Dinner for 4 including 7 cocktails came out to $390 and for the amount of food you get, it is honestly not worth it.   Sorry, based on the quality and taste of the food as well as the amount we ended up paying, I cannot give this place more than three stars.",

Hamachi sashimi - although the fish was fresh the pureed sauce and red jalapeno   kill off any flavor of the fish.   Salt and pepper squid - good concept but over cooked. The squid was stringy.   Shisho peppers  - not cooked well as the size of the peppers varied from very small to very large. No consistency in the bake so the small peppers were overcooked and the large peppers were still a bit undercooked.   Sasa Handroll - a shrimp tempura with quinoa in a soy wrapper. The quinoa was aldente so the texture of the quinoa overpowered the entire roll. Also the shrimp was smothered in saracha mayo so you could not taste the shrimp.   Sushi -   Saba - a bit fishy   Hamachi - nice thick cut   Kampachi - stringy and a bit slimy   Ikura - fresh and clean    Uni - fresh and clean",

The two best dishes were the Yamato roll with foie gras and the uni (very fresh). Everything else was so-so with the biggest disappointment was the Samba Strip roll.   Overall nothing was memorable.

But then again, people who are not open to fusion should avoid such a daring tasting adventure.   The group I came with were starving, so we wondered if there were any tables opened for 10 people. The hostess up front said that she had a private room available and that we could be seated quickly. Yay for private room! But there was a catch that she didn't tell us: $75 order minimum per person.   Well that didn't stop the group so they went straight to ordering sashimi, sushi, oysters, skewers, satay, and LIVE lobster!? But wait, there's no toro? Yep, our waiter told us they will no longer have toro because the fish is too endangered or something to that extent.   I forgot the exact orders because there were so much that night that I can hardly differentiate them since I was so hungry. (See pics instead!)  The service was fantastic, the music selection was also great (Kaskade playing all night long), and the food was most definitely unique and GOOD. This is no Cheesecake factory, so don't expect monstrous portions! Taste and savor the freshness of those little morsels you put into your mouth because it will do some damage to that wallet of yours by the end of the meal.",

    "text": "Just like any fancy Vegas joint, if you want to have a pretty good experience at the restaurant, expect to pay upwards of ~$45 per person.  I would recommend making reservations as the place can get packed.  I came with a group of about 8. The menu is extensive. You probably won't know what to get especially if it's your first time at this joint. Our waiter, who was really nice and helpful, asked us how much we were willing to spend and he would take care of us.  Take care of us he did. We were set up with a 6 course meal which included Peruvian and Japanese style cuisine. I can't remember everything (because there was a lot of variety), but there was lots of good stuff like sushi and steak. Peruvian corn is TASTY!  Presentation of food was perfect. They are quick with filling water and the plates and utensils are elegant and unique. A few times during our meal, they replaced our plates with fresh ones.  We paid $45 each and we were all very satisfied because the meal was filling and not too much.  The service and the environment and professionalism they give you at the restaurant was well worth the money and I would definitely come back here.  The background music they would play was very samba. I was really diggin' it.  The bar area looked interesting. I would have sat down to have a few drinks if I wasn't too messed up for before.  The bathrooms were incredibly nice. However, I can only really speak for the men's room. It's like the urinals have their own big stall. You just have to see it. They have someone there asking if you would like some soap and after you're done washing your hands, they give you a REALLY soft towel to wipe your hands on. NICE!  It's located in a nice place in some shopping area near a Victoria's Secret and a other stores. So if you're bored waiting for a table, you can shop around.",

We got seated at the bar, which I find odd that you can't order straight from the sushi chefs that are standing right in front of you.  So it's like seating at the tables anyway, but your closer to the TVs and can stare at the fresh fishes available.    We started with Seared Kobe Beef- ponzu gelee, warm Japanese mushrooms, truffled tofu crema, I thought it was a little too salty, but overall, the dish was very good.    sashimi tiradito- Yellowtail jalapeno and lemongrass- the yellowtail was fresh and the sauce was good. It was more lemongrass tasting, didn't really taste the jalapeno.   anticuchos which are two skewers served with peruvian corn (double the size of normal corn and a bit harder) Sea Bass and Miso- the fish was perfectly cooked and very tasty.  This was the most recommended dish and it was worth the try.  There was no fishy taste.   Samba Rolls- El Topo- salmon, jalapeno, shiso leaf, fresh melted mozzarella, crispy onion- warm rolls, very tasty, melted right in my mouth.    For sushi, their ika was good and their sake (salmon) was pretty darn fresh tasting.   Their green tea was also very good. I believe it's $5.    Overall, the service was great and quick.  They came and refilled everything without asking.  Food was good and I can't wait to come back to try everything else.",

    "text": "To start off I was not expecting to be blown away with this place but I WAS!! Everything from this restaurant was beyond my expectations. Went there for a special treat and oh my... we had one.  First off I would not say the sushi is extraordinary, in fact its standard but I did love the yellow tail scallion there more than I do at most places, but the items on the menu other than sushi is what got me!  First and for most  the drink tower is amazing and unique from the appearance to all the different varieties like the cucumber one, strawberry, grapefruit, and so on...we tried total of 6!!. My favorite was the one with the cucumber and the one with the mint cant recall the actual names due to all the drinks ; )   Now on to the MEALSSSSS the ones I loved would have to be the steak tacos, best I had in a really long time and the sauce that they come with has a little kick that makes it all so complete. Another one would have to be the Alaskan king crab leg cut in perfect portions to be grabbed with the chop sticks and topped off with a cream sauce was sooooooooo good!! There was also the miso sea bass if you like the taste of the miso flavor and appreciate sea bass like I do its a must, even though my last bite on the skewer was not as great as the first 3 ; ( and my favorite dish of the whole night would have to be the in shell scallops!!!! I had never seem my scallops served in a shell till I went to this place, they were cooked with perfection and had some sort of pesto butter topping them off. I can literally eat so many and never have enough!!  One more dish worth mentioning would have to be the tempura shrimp even though I am not a fan of most fried foods this one was good!! And the portion was giant!  As far as the dessert I am usually one to clear out all the plates but this was not the case for me, we got the mochi variety dish but it was too frozen it didn't do the mochi justice, and our other dessert consisted of friend bananas (Which i am not a fan of) and coconut cream and the best coffee ice cream I have ever had! This meal was a fun teat and experience and the staff was amazing!   Another tip on the side is make reservations, it was PACKED when we got there...",

We ordered the scallops, the duck, the oysters, the teriyaki chicken, coconut rice and the beef dumplings. The dumplings was my favorite. Others in the party liked the scallops and the oysters too. Maybe we should have tried the wagyu beef, but were too tired and hungry to try cook it on the table.",

Waiter was SUPER Nice and made sure we enjoyed the food, were comfortable, and never made us feel rushed. We had a choice of ordering separate or rolls or Chef Choice Family Style which is around $50 per person. We chose family style...but first the waiter checked for food allergies and if we did not like anything he would take it away no questions asked.  First they came out with appetizers..squid, edamame, and a crab dish very vague desciption but it's Vegas so who can remember..  Then came out the rolls..it was a mix or rainbow roll and a lobster roll and something with unagi. The lobster roll was delicious and so creative!!!  Then came out beef and fish kebobs sauteed in sweet and tangy sauce..it melted in my mouth!!!  There were five of us girls and we received a free shot from the general manager and we looked around to see if any other table received the treatment and no they did not!  All in all make reservations and GO! Great place for dinner but plan to spend some money and get family style.",

I thought we just got lucky the first time we came, but as it turns out, everything we've tried on the menu thus far is DELICIOUS.  Ambiance is classy and cool.  It's a nice location within the Palazzo hotel with lots of seats.  Service was also good, as my water glass was always full despite being very busy on a Friday night at midnight.  We got:  MOQUECA MISTA - shrimp, squid, sea bass, coconut milk, roasted cashew, dende oil, chimichurri rice - $29 - <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sushisamba-las-vegas?select=T4JWaoBHrbkBP4vR92x4uA#T4JWaoBHrbkBP4vR92x4uA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/sush...</a>  This thing is the BEST EVER.  Creamy Thai-style curry taste (hence coconut milk) with the delicate seafood mixed in with bits of crushed cashews, giving the dish great texture.  Rice was served within the sauce mixture as shown; the rice soaked up all the sauce, making every morsel DIVINE.  I thought after a while the dish would get too rich-tasting, but somehow I kept gobbling and gobbling until the plate was empty!  EL TOPO SUSHI ROLL - salmon, jalapeno, shiso leaf, fresh melted mozzerella, crispy onion - $15 (forgot to take a pic; too excited about the moqueca mista)  Very unique roll with interesting flavors and textures = Delicious!  CHICKEN TERIYAKI - Samba Style organic chicken, aji amarillo, purple potato mash, crispy onion - $26 (again forgot to take a pic...)  When I saw the huge price tag I thought \"WTF?!\", especially for a seemingly simple plate as chicken teriyaki (my friend ordered this one so I had no control).  BUTTT I'll have to say that it was probably the best teriyaki chicken I've ever had in my life!  Super juicy fillets of teriyaki chicken, pan fried (I think) to a crisp.  The sauce was perfect; not too saucy, not too dry, and definitely not overpowering to the dish.  As with all finer dining restaurants, especially on the Las Vegas Strip, I did think the prices were a little inflated.  Hence the lack of that final star.  However, probably one of my favorite places to eat while in Vegas.  I'll definitely hit it up again on future trips.  They have a good happy hour too (both early evening and late night), so I'll have to take advantage of that next time! :)",

All mini glasses of their specialty cocktails. So awesome! There were four of us and they brought us a total of 3 towers, so we each got to try 6 different flavors. Loved it so much. The variety was just amazing. I'd have to say my top 3 favorites were the Chu-cumber (cucumber flavored one), the lemon samurai, and pisco sour (I have visited Peru before so I've had the opportunity to try an authentic version of this before). So so great!  All the meals brought out for us to share were fantastic! The Peruvian corn was different a cool blend of flavors to add to our palette. The Alaskan king crab legs were perfection! And my other favorite dishes were the mini tacos and the shelled scallops. So amazing! Other fantastic dishes I got to try were the salt and pepper squid, rock shrimp tempura (amazing), miso marinated sea bass, chicken teriyaki-samba style... Like I said. One. Amazing. Experience!!! I can't wait to come back again.",

There are a NUMBER of vegan and or vegetarian options on the menu and the chefs deserve 5 stars for the presentation and freshness they imparted to each of the dishes my girlfriend and I ordered.  In addition, SushiSamba truly is high end. Now many restaurants and or hotels etc say they are high end  (and oftentimes charge high end prices for mediocre service) but SushiSamba was a high end dining experience. We did not spot any folks with shorts or baseball caps while we were dining...just other patrons who understand that every once in a while in life one should ditch the casual wear and dress to the level of restaurant you are dining in.  Finally; and this is for the guys reading this review, Sushi Samba is a REALLY good date location. It has just the right ambiance and the lighting and noise level are perfect for a high end dinner with your date...",

    "text": "We had high hopes for this place due to the overwhelmingly positive reviews on Yelp, but sadly it didn't live up to our expectations. The ambience was great and service was decent (though our waiter forgot to bring us bowls for one of our bigger plates, not a big deal). The food was just simply mediocre. I don't know if it was because we didn't order the right things but we left bloated yet unfulfilled.   Between the two of us, we had Hokkaido Scallops, Wagyu Taquitos, Seaweed Salad, Moqueca Mista, Neo Tokyo Roll, Salmon Handrolls, and several different nigiri (including their Alaskan Salmon nigiri, which they claimed to be equivalent to the salmon version of fatty tuna). The scallops and taquitos were pretty good, but all of the sushi was just... meh. We have been to many sushi restaurants, both high-end and low-end ones, and for the price we were paying here, we expected good quality sushi. Instead we got something similar to what we can get at a $25 sushi buffet, just served in a better environment.  I guess in conclusion, if you came here only for traditional sushi, you might very well be disappointed just like us. After all, this is a Japanese, Brazilian and Peruvian mixed restaurant. If you are more open to trying a variety of items (with a deep enough pocket), you might find it enjoyable. There are so many 5-star reviews, so they must be doing something right...",

The drinks hit the spot and were subtle and fresh. Great selection of regional/international liquors too.  Food was day boat fresh (or seemed so)...as Vegas is not on the water. Everything came out quickly as well. Adore the medium rare lamb and the selections of dipping sauces. Must try their rare yellowtail. Can't go wrong here if someone else is buying. FYI: super trendy images on the giant wall-to-wall tvs - everything from images of sand burials to waterfall frolicking near naked. Maybe pass on SushiSamba for a family dinner with the kiddos.",

The wagyu beef dish here, which we ordered separately, was out of this world. It's not quite on par with the overall quality of Nobu; but I would definitely get that again.",

We had the best server, Vanessa, who advised we try their tasting menu. We were not disappointed. SushiSamba is a mix of Japanese, Brazilian, and Peruvian cuisine and I'm so glad we didn't just get sushi. The tasting menu was exactly what we were looking for and didn't even know it. Thanks to our amazing server we went on a culinary adventure. Vanessa selected all of our drinks as well as each course and she was spot on with her selections. We will definitely be back to SushiSamba and are already looking forward to a repeat performance. Don't be meek ordering here, go for it and get the tasting menu - you will not be disappointed!   Also, after reading some of the negative reviews I would assume they tried to order straight off the menu... I would not recommend this as what our waitress picked for us wouldn't have entered our minds to order.  I think if we had tried to order off the menus we'd have had a fail meal too. Stick to your waitress/ers recommendations and you will not be disappointed!",

    "text": "Alright, now were getting to the good stuff.   And by \"good\" I mean un-fucking-believable. Yea, I said it. Unreal. Never have I wanted to pick up and move to Vegas so much in all of my life, but I'm thinking about it after the dinner I had at Sushisamba's new ultra lounge, Sugarcane. This is an incredible statement for me because for one, I can only take Vegas in small doses, and two, I despise the heat. So having said that you can believe me when I say that I love absolutely everything about Sushisamba, the Brazilian/Peruvian/Japanese fusion restaurant at the Palazzo.   Where do I begin?  Oh yes, Holy Mary Mother of God, I've died and gone to heaven...  A friend of mine is the Publicist for this new restaurant, as well as the brand spanking new, Sugarcane. She hooked up a dinner reservation for me and some friends so that we could celebrate my good friend's birthday in style. Upon our (late) arrival we were greeted warmly by the wait staff, as they explained to us that our party would be the very first members of the public to sit down to dinner in their brand new ultra lounge. As we walked through the dimly lit hallway, past the DJ booth and dance floor, and into the dining area portion of Sugarcane we were immediately taken back by the overall design concept of the space. I\"m gonna do my best to do it justice but I would highly recommend a trip here to experience for yourself because it is just too complex for words...  The walls are covered with graffiti-style murals of Samurais and Japanese script, the dance floor has a canvas like screen that wraps around the circular pods that make up the women's bathrooms (see pics) where they project abstract imagery to coincide with the music playing. The DJ that night was Claudio who I wanted to put in my pocket and take home because the music was just that dope. There are multi-colored glass cylinders that hang from the ceiling and beams of light (see pics) that separate the dance floor from the dining area that change from red to orange to white that create a truly magnificent effect.   The food and service is on a level that is even harder to explain - it was incredible. Our waiter Anthony took such good care of us we felt as though we were old friends by the time we left. Of course, we were the first to be seated and the last to leave, so I guess if you spend enough time with your waiter (four hours) you begin to feel like family. Our sake sommelier was a hilariously funny girl (I forgot her name) and very helpful and knowledgeable when describing our sake selections. We ended up choosing a bottle with gold leaf cherry blossoms there were supposedly good luck if you found them floating in your drink.   Our table decided to order the signature Sushisamba 7-course Omakase ($70 per person) as our dinner selection. Anthony asked us if we had any food allergies or other special requests before going back to the kitchen to get our party started. Our first course was a selection of appetizers (see pics) which included the Kobe beef carpaccio with wild mushrooms, seared ahi tuna on a tiny bed of spinach, and (my favorite) tiny ceviche fish tacos with a chili foam sauce that was AMAZING! Next up was the best snow crab I have ever tasted, filet mignon, duck, Chilan Sea Bass (unreal), grilled tomatoes, fish jowel (I forget what kind) and the most beautiful sashimi plate I've ever seen/tasted. Just when we thought we couldn't eat any more came the sushi course. A stand out roll was the Kobe beef wrapped roll with (from what I can remember) a spicy tuna, cucumber and avocado center. As we sat back in our booth contemplating exactly how we were planning on walking out of there, Anthony presented the birthday girl with an incredible chocolate fondue plate (see pics) complete with Japanese-style sesame rice krispies, Japanese cake, homemade marshmallows, and a selection of fruit. There were also mini fruit tacos with both mango and banana, with a chocolate mousse and caramel topping.   Do you see what I'm talking about?????  Here's the rundown....  Party of four: First round of cocktails (on the house) Several cocktails to follow Bottle of premium sake 7- course Omakase dinner for four ($70 each) After dinner cocktails Divine dessert platter  Total bill: Approx $600  Not bad I'd say. Not bad at all.   All in all, I plan to go back to visit several times over. Anyone who stumbles upon this place should consider themselves lucky to be in the presence of such foodie excellence. This dinner made our entire trip, and made for a very, very happy birthday girl.   Sushisamba: the wait staff, the owner, the managers, the DJ. You rock my rock-n-roll world.",

I can hang with the foodies, understand the lingo and know mostly what they talk about, but I just like to eat. I like to enjoy my food in the more primal sense - eat it, love it, and try to eat more of it.  So it was here that my lovely and I came to have our first meal of our trip in Vegas. I like Peruvian and Brazilian, she likes Fish and Asian, so hey... bada bing.  We did a sort of taster/small plates menu, from some sushi, a lambchop which I will call THE WORLDS BEST. Peruvian maize which were the size of freaking lima beans, but oh so good, and... well.. truth be told I can't remember all what else. There was some sort of ceviche deal, but after a few DonQ Mojitos, and a lot of drinking that night, I can barely recall all that was had.  But from what I do remember, it was really really good. Sure, it's a fusion restaurant and they either go really really great or you leave less than impressed, but this place really left a good impression on me. The service was wonderful, the exotic drinks weren't too sickly in my opinion, and the decor, ambiance, service, and wait were rather agreeable (especially after having driven for 5 hours that day)  Prices weren't shockingly \"brb, need to hit the craps table for a few rolls\" high either.  Really good if you're looking for some sort of Asian/South American style cuisine.",

    "text": "It is very difficult for me to express how amazing my dining experience was at Samba Sushi. The waitress was super fun and helpful. We went there with the hopes of experiencing a \"one of a kind\" dining experience and we had just that. Our waitress (can't remember her name because it is Japanese) was really wonderful we told her to bring us some exciting options. She guided us through the menu and helped us choose some great options. We had a fifteen piece Chef's choice that included mini crabs, foie gras, caviar, oysters, and some other types of fish. Absolutely delightful. It was the perfect blend of tasty and adventurous. After the first plate we began to get very intrigued about the food and decided to order a selection of sashimi dishes which was also phenomenal. I have never tasted such amazing fish in my life. Having spent nearly $180 dollars on a meal for two, I was more than satisfied. We'll worth the wait and the price. I can't wait to eat here again in the future!",

    "text": "In reality, the food and atmosphere of Sushi Samba warrants a 4 star review, however, our server Mike was so fantastic he earned that 5th star.   I'm a big fan of Latin/Asian fusion which, at first mention, confuses most people. Trust me folks, it works. Here the specific Latin influence is South American. Our group ordered a mix of the two types of cuisine and not one dish disappointed. (The menu is large and diverse enough that even the pickiest eaters in your group will find something) The robata dishes were fantastic, as were the tiraditos. The sushi rolls were not that impressive as far as sushi goes. It was my least favorite part of the meal.   Dessert was amazing. We sampled three desserts, the mochi, some sort of chocolate hazelnut dish, and a banana dish. Since we were celebrating 3 birthdays the 3 desserts were complimentary. For 5 people, including a bottle of sake, the total bill came to about $200 which is more than reasonable.   The atmosphere is fantastic. It is a great place for large groups, the large circular tables provide everyone with the ability to have a conversation. There is nothing I hate more than dining at a long rectangular table with a group; you almost always end up just talking to the people sitting in your immediate area. The ceiling follows the Asian theme with cherry blossoms and the like, while the walls are filled with South American graffiti art. The one thing I could do without was the party video footage from one of their other restaurants, it cheapened the experience a bit. However, halfway through our meal it switched over to a Godzilla movie which I enjoyed much, much more.   I would not hesitate to return to Sushi Samba, its a twist on places like Fix and Stack. So if you are looking for a similar atmosphere but with a little something more, this is your place.",

The prices couldn't be better - $14 for lunch. The decor is cool - I know this sounds odd - but if you visit you have to check out the bathrooms - they are super cool.  The only thing I didn't like was that they didn't have that many signature/special rolls. They probably had about 5/6 different options when it came to special rolls and they seemed a little to far out there. Not what I would want included in my sushi. But then again, I am just a beginner, so maybe I am not open minded enough when it comes to sushi. Guess you will have to go visit and decide for yourself. Don't worry, it's worth the visit.",

    "text": "I was really excited about coming here after reading some of these reviews. This is gonna be a long one, please hang in there.   Reading about the Omakase experiences was what got me interested. I'll spare you the details on the interior. (Aunny D. explained it perfectly) The place is just fricken nice, beautifully decorated and the perfect hang out spot. They hired very attractive hostesses that were extremely friendly. The service we received from our waiter and the staff was simply awesome.   Now for the food.....  We had a party of 5 and our original plan was to order both Traditional Omakase($100) and the Sushi Samba Omakase ($80). After going through the menu, we decided to order up a variety of items rather than go with the Omakase. This way, you end up getting food that would be in the Omakase anyway, more food (Omakase 7 -course), and for less.   \"Small Plates\" and \"seviches & tiraditos\"  (Graded A to F)  Tuna Tataki  - (C+) Chef overuses tatsoi that practically kills the dish  Seared Kobe Beef -(F) Just not worth it. Mushrooms overwhelms it  Chicharron de Calamar - (A) Excellent and generous amount!  Sashimi Seviches - (B) grapefruit juice, jalapeno, almond +  passionfruit,  cucumber, cilantro   Sashimi Tiraditos - (D) Yellowtail jalapeno and lemongrass + Salmon orange and mustard miso  Sushi is obviously the trendy thing to have on a restaurants menu. Sushi Samba serves up some of the most below average sashimi and sushi. For $33, we had the Samba Sushi and Sashimi combo. The sashimi was nice and thick.  Both Salmon and Yellowtail were quite good, but the tuna was poorly prepared and lacked any freshness. The sushi was a complete joke. You get a small wafer thin slice of sashimi on a rabbit dropping sized glob of rice. Most Japanese restaurants, for any combo sushi plate, give you two pieces each - tuna, salmon, and yellowtail. Sushi Samba gives you ONE. My whole table thought this was a complete joke and ripoff. It doesnt end here....we ordered 4 different rolls. Guess what? They're all puny and only have 4 pieces averaging $10-$20 each. We also ordered the 5 hand roll special ($28) which was okay, but the soy wrap just doesnt work.   Now here's how we felt that the chefs were completely LAZY or inexperienced. The sushi rice had no vinegar flavor and that is a must for sushi rice. Plus, they used old rice because we had some hard dried pieces in our rolls. Overall, I would not waste any money on sushi here. It's a complete insult to customers.   Our final dish was the 5 Meat churrasco: grilled hanger steak, ribeye, pork tenderloin, chorizo, linguica with malagueta pepper oil and chimichurri.  - This dish was fantastic. The meat, cooked medium, was tender and juicy. (A+)  Now, we had a total of about 16-17 items of various things off the menu. More than double than what you'll get in a Omakase.  We had about 5 bottles of Japanese beers. Our cost  per person was $92 with tax and tip included. (5 people)   I would love to come back just for the atmosphere and the churrasco. Its simply a cool place to hang out and drink. DONT come here for the Japanese food. Go to a real Japanese restaurant for the Omakase. Just seeing how the sushi, sashimi, and rolls are prepared makes me question the chef's experience in preparing a True Omakase.    If you actually read this whole thing. Thanks!",

We dined here since we were staying at the Palazzo but that was a costly mistake. Our sashimi platter had traces of fish bone in it!! We sipped on cocktails for TWO HOURS before our entrees came out!! Perhaps that was our servers strategy to entice us to order more alcohol but I'm a food addict not an alcoholic. I don't mind waiting for good food but 2 hours (im not even counting from when we were seated i'm counting from when we finished our appetizers) for entrees is just ridiculous. The 5 courses of churrasco was extremely DRY and don't bother trying the dipping sauces it's accompanied by unless you can control your gagging reflexes.  The only good part of our meal was the kobe but then again it was kobe! How can you mess up on kobe??? For a better dining experience I suggest you try Yellowtail at the Bellagio instead or many of the other countless fine dining restaurants on the strip. Why would you want to pay to get food poisoning?? You don't DUH that's why you don't eat here.",

I ordered chicken teriyaki., which was incredibly tender and served on top of these delicious purple mashed potatoes in a tasty sauce.   My companion ordered a variety of sushi and rolls. He was born in Japan and is very picky about his sushi, but he was very happy with everything that he ordered.   We defintely will go again.  Next time I want to try the plantains!",

Anyway, the service. Our waiter was inexplicably absent for twenty to thirty minutes at a time, which is not the way a waiter at a place that thrives on small plates ought to do his job. Glasses sat empty. Plates sat bare. He didn't check on us, even when we were waiting anxiously to pay him and leave.  Las Vegas weeds out places like Sushisamba over time. There are always young, dynamic restaurateurs that want to come in, hire an enthusiastic staff, and serve creative food. This place had the food down.

The sushi was exceptionally fresh with unique presentation.   Fusion dishes to try:  El Topo (roll), which had salmon, jalapeno, shiso leaf, fresh melted mozzerella, crispy onion. It sounds absurd and it was just that... absurdly delicious.   Carnaval (roll)- shrimp, avocado, yellowtail, soy paper. This one wasn't as good as El Topo, but still offered a cool twist on a typical Japanese favorite.  Miso soup - it was a great miso but with added cilantro to lend to the Brazilian side of the restaurant. Amazing twist!  Wagyu gyoza - kabocha puree and su-shoyu dipping sauce made this sweet, tangy, and a little spicy. We ended up ordered another batch after downing the first order in 30 seconds. So good!  We also ordered some Robata items, which were great, but paled in comparison to the fusion dishes and the sushi items. This place is absolutely worth a stop! Also, the price is right. We ordered a ton of food for 5 people and the bill was reasonable!",

Came-in with a large group (14) and had a reservation and special menu set-up for us, in 3-course fashion.  Ordered a ton of food and had plenty of service staff waiting on our table. They threw-in a bottle (or two, can't remember). Which was nice of them.",

The drinks were tasty, and the food was impeccable - probably some of the best sushi I've ever had.  The one thing that this place is lacking is customer service. I felt like the entire staff had this \"Entitled - I'm better than you attitude\" -- which I'm sorry, doesn't really fly when you work in the service industry.   We were a large party, with a very large bill - it was a special occasion, and there were several rounds of drinks, plus we ordered (at least) one of everything off the happy hour menu prior to be seated for a full dinner. Our male bartender was incredibly rude, and seemed very inconvenienced with our parties orders. If one person ordered a drink, he made it a point to interrupt every conversation between others to see if anyone else needed another drink, even if their glass was full. At one point my brother in law ordered a drink, and about 5-10 minutes later my husband ordered a different drink and the bartender very obviously rolled his eyes, kind of flailed his arms and huffed that he had just asked if he needed anything. Not what I would expect at this caliber of a restaurant, and I hope that next time we return the service is much better.",

The menu has a good mix of traditional sushi, hot dishes, and fancy special rolls. Prices are as expected ($$$) for the location and cuisine. Can't go wrong with sashimi or Chilean sea bass.   Service can be slow if the restaurants is busy, which it always seems to be. I recommend making reservations if you plan on eating at during peak hours. But the staff is always really friendly and if there is a delay between courses, they sometimes bring out an appetizer on the house to make up for it (win!)",

The kids waygu sliders and noodles were amazing. I of course had to eat some of their food. It was followed my the best mochi. The tastiest drink for kids, pineapple juice (not too sweet). For adults to drink, caipirinha. Yum!!! The manager and waiter (Ryan G.) were so friendly. He even put in the kids order right away.",

They anticipated our needs and made sure our table was cleared before the next dish came. Our water glasses were always full.   The large plate moqueca mista came loaded with seafood and was a nice filling entree amongst our lighter dishes.  We wished we could try even more items from the menu.  We finished off with the chocolate sata andagi. The donuts were fluffy and the flavours of the ice cream, chocolate ganache and red fruit coulis was perfect.  The $12 kids menu is amazing. The tempura came with a full size bowl of miso soup and rice. And it comes with ice cream mochi as a dessert option!",

Samba strip: (4.5/5) amazing but a bit of spice would take it to the next level  Handrolls: (3.5/5) it was good but missing flavor  Beef wagyu: (2/5) didn't think it was great.

I didn't get to take pictures because my phone died but this restaurant is definitely worthy of an awesome review! Best sushi place in Vegas even for people who don't eat fish like me. :)",

They were very flavorful and I think people with different tastes would be happy with it.  We also tried their Lima sushi roll, it was good, not surprising though. The signature Wagyu Beef Gyoza. It was made with butter on the bottom, and even for me who doesn't really like butter, I like that one.  In terms of dessert, we had the chocolate sata andagi, a vanilla ice bream scoop with sugar-ry and chocolate rice ball.",

Couple tips:  -this place is kind of a tapas style menu, definitely order a few things to share amount your group -make a reservation. Whether it's for lunch or dinner -they have happy hour!! 4-7, 11-close everyday except for Saturday -if you have a big group, definitely do an \"omakase style\" dining, basically, you tell your server your likes and dislikes, and you tell him the price you want to stay at per person.   We had a group of ten girls, they so kindly brought out a cocktail tree for our bride, which contained different cocktails, and we got sooo much food. I am a girl who never leaves food uneaten and we had so much left over, we stayed $40 per person. Special shout out to Carmine for being a great server, and jade and Rannah for taking care of the girls.   Atmosphere- fun, lively, good for date nights or group dinners.",

We ordered another tuna roll that was the favorite of our waiter and it was delicious - several types of tuna, but I can't put my finger on the name.

I was really craving Sushi on the day we arrived in Vegas, the weather was amazing as usual, and I just needed something good. We hadn't tried Sushi Samba yet, so we made a reservation and added in that we were celebrating our Wedding anniversary.  I got the spicy Tempura Rock Shrimp, which was good but portion size should have been nearly double what we received, since it cost almost $20 (for an appetizer) I mean it was a lot of lettuce and greens, not much shrimp.  Next we got 2 yellowtail Taquitos and my husband ordered Robata - chicken and Berkshire Pork Belly - and the waiter tried convincing us we needed the filet mignon and duck breast instead - which were \"better\" - (he actually meant they were more expensive) and we did not want them. Not a fan of duck breast, my husband once again specified Chicken and Pork. The Peruvian Corn that comes with the Robata was outstanding - delicious! That corn may have been the first highlight of our meal.  We ordered a couple of sushi rolls and they were good - just not memorable. I just wanted a \"WOW\" experience and it never happened.  I am a fan of Japanese Whisky, but I never got any - I ordered some cucumber and gin cocktail instead which did not taste good at all - I regretted it at $15 per drink. They brought out 2 glasses of complimentary champagne for our anniversary, which was more palatable than my cocktail. That was the 2nd highlight of our meal. Overall, we spent $150 on food that was fun and cute, but did not satisfy. But...when in Vegas, I guess. I've eaten better for a quarter of that price. I was full for about an hour, and then started getting hungry again.   Those Butterfly-shaped gummy candies in the treat box in our room at Encore started to look appetizing...",

But not only was the fish SUB PAR the service was below average, and again I've worked in a sushi restaurant as host, food runner, and server. My friend and I went for happy hour and not only did they NOT give us the happy hour menu we had to ask for it then the server was tryna to \"upsell\" us the regular menu, great for the restaurant but you know we're here for happy hour didn't make sense - know your crowd have common sense.   The ROCK shrimp is not \"rock\" it's soggy and they explained it was because of the \"sauce\" so than make it a dipping sauce instead of defeating the purpose of the rock shrimp.   Sea bass was cool but they served it with some type of corn that was super irrelevant.    The yellowtail tiradito was so worthless it's just yellowtail sashimi inside a pool of spicy mayo.....   We also ordered the hot sake and it only comes by the bottle and then they heat it up after you order it so it took 10 min and only served less than 2 pours each so 4 sake cups full at 36$ for a bottle:   Overall. I think it's very overpriced even at happy hour for any type of food tour given,   If anything order the yellowtail taquitos and that's it. Nothing I mean NOTHINg else:   In fact with the amount you'll spend here eve On happy hour just go to a more expensive place with a server spend maybe an extra 20 worh better service better quality and less of a headache",

Even after the long lapse between visits we were not disappointed. Most of their classic Miami dishes remain on the menu and are very well done. Service is awesome and delivered by a great waiter who has been at the Las Vegas store since opening in 2008 and in the Mother-ship Miami location before that.  Highly recommend the rock shrimp tempura, miso Bass, robata pork belly and any of their special rolls  If you're into the Brazilian classic cocktail the Caipirinha, Sushisamba does one that very authentic a that tastes great.   Sushisamba you've still got it going on!!",

We got the ribeye medium rare and it was tender and juicy. We were full by the time it came to our table (last) but we ate every bit of it because it was delicious! I didn't care for the greens or beans that came with the dish. The white rice was fine (I mean it's hard to mess up plain white rice).  The Chilean sea bass had FLAVOR MAJOR! It also had a buttery melt-in-your mouth texture that will humble even the most experienced palette!  We also got the green bean tempura with truffle aioli. Yum!!!  We had the Asevichado roll, which was heavy on the citrus and not my favorite thing on the menu.  Finally, we had the seaweed salad trio, which was mostly to add some more greens to our meal. The Black seaweed salad was sweet and tasty. The texture was a bit dry but it all works together. The traditional green wakame was good but nothing different from what you'd get at any sushi place. The red seaweed salad was totally flavorless without the fresh lemon juice squeezed on. That one is more for texture!  I'd go back to Sushi Samba!",

Our server was super nice (forgot his name) but he would explain what every dish was and how it was made.  I came with a group of friends and we opted in for the omakase option.  The dishes started off really good and then went downhill from there.  The dishes that I'd recommend getting are (in no specific order):   1. Yellowyail Taquitos 2. Wagyu Gyoza  3. Crispy Scallop  4. Seabass   The sushi on the other hand.... Were no good. The basic rolls - Salmon Avocada Roll and Spicy Tuna Roll - was awful. The quality was not fresh and very disappointing.  I came for their sushi, and ended up liking their cooked food more than their sushi dishes.   FYI when you opt into their omakase option they ask you what you don't like to eat so they don't bring out the food... But the thing is, how do you know what's included to say you don't like it? For example they brought us out a $10 roasted vegetables dish.... How would we have known that would be a dish they would serve us???  Overall, expect to spend at least $60 per person with the omakase option.",

They offer something for everyone it is a misleading name because you instantly think that they only have sushi this is not the case I promise you. Their Ramen it's a tonkotsu Ramen is so darn delicious!!! You'd think you're eating at a ramen restaurant.   Their sushi selection is pretty delicious it's expensive but it's Las Vegas are you surprised? Overall everything is actually pretty reasonably price considering that it is Vegas. For the quality and quantity of food and the quality of service and the beautiful decor and ambience I think it's fairly priced. Waiters and busboys they are running the floor and there's never a need to ask for anything they will come to you and help out immediately. I loved their miso Seabass. I also really enjoyed all of their nigiri and sashimi. Can't wait to try some other roles and other items on their menu. Their drink menu is absolutely incredible they offer such a vast array of libations and fine spirits they also offer a very large menu for sake.   The entire restaurant was completely packed on a Wednesday night I think they are doing something right. We were able to snag a reservation through open table within the hour I highly recommend you do so otherwise showing up with no reservation could be up to a two hour wait.   Everything was designed to share but of course you can totally order things per person as well.",

Thus, Vegas has been forced to up its game in other areas in order to attract visitors.  Well, this restaurant succeeded.    Wow, this place is fantastic.  Everything from the ambiance of the restaurant, to the quality and selection of the menu items,  and to the service, this place gets is right.  Other restaurants take note.  This is how to run an excellent restaurant.    I recently had dinner here with some friends, and we were very pleased.  Our server was very attentive, recommending drinks at first.  He then told us about the tasting, so we went with it.   Well, the food was delicious.  There was the Akami Tuna, the salt and pepper calamari (highly recommend that dish!), the Peruvian bay scallops, and the taquitos.  There were also others, too many to remember, but I do remember not finding anything that didn't taste good.  It's rare to find have such a great meal.  Highly recommend!",

Tried the following menu:  Appetiser:  Crispy fresh yellow tail taquitos $12 for 2  Miso seabass with Mexican corn $22 Wagyu beef gyoza paired well with sweet potato pureed $18  The sweet ending was andagi - presented well with 3 lightly fired Japanese chocolate filled donut holes with sweet cream ice cream $12  Love the deco and colorful interior,  loud music may be the only issue if u take your date to this restauarant.",

I do have some suggestions though. first of all, make a reservation or show up very early. second, instead of getting lost in the menu -- it's a fusion restaurant so think myriad choice and complexity multiplied by something other than binary -- have the wait staff put together a tapas selection based on their favorites. tell them how adventurous you are else up may end up with little fried crabs you're supposed to eat whole. just sayin. last thing, don't leave without trying the purple mashed potatoes.  it's expensive here especially with drinks - so bring your bankroll, your loan repayment program, your mommy's credit card, or your dish washing skillz.",

The sushi was very good, but not \"las vegas\" good.  There are far better places if you just want sushi.  But this place is different, offering a spin of Brazillian flare on the Japanese standard.  I liked the playfulness....   but back to the important stuff... the Kobe!  Grade A5 from Japan (I'm guessing Vegas had a shipment of this because every place said they had A5 Japanese Kobe!)  Sushi Samba brought out a plate of raw sliced kobe next to a line of dry and wet spices/marinades.  Then came the huge hot rock.  We were then instructed to dip the beef in the marinade of choice, set on rock for 30 seconds a side, then sprinkle with preferred dry spice.  I watched the ladies at our table go first and I saw them immediately go to their \"happy place\" with the first bite.  After the rest of the table ate, I could see everyone counting the remaining pieces to see how many more bites they had.  Hahahaha!!! So much fun!  Great Sake list if you like that (which I do).  Hundreds of junmai daiginjo bottles going into the $1,000's.  I found a decent one for $50 (300ml).  So recap, get the kobe, enjoy the sushi... don't go if sushi is all that you want, there's better.",

There is no interaction (you have to wait for the server to come around to order your sushi, then wait for them to deliver it), so you spend your meal time with bored guys in front of your and your back to the restaurant. ... Oh. .and fricken flies! ! I spent the mealtime swatting away flies. .not exactly what one wants to see when dealing with raw fish :-/  Acoustics are horrible,  everyone is yelling trying to be heard. .  I probably won't eat here again.. I prefer a more. .. traditional sushi bar. ..",

Our waiter, Max, gave us a $50-60 prix fix menu, and brought us a sampling of the best: edamame, tempura, meats, sushi, cod, squid, etc. all in all, it was amazing.  The scene is very cool. We didn't want to get hosed by going to a club, so this was the next best thing. Good people watching, good music, and amazing food.  Our waiter gave us a free round of cucumber shots, and was vey personable.  The hostesses were young, and dictate a while for us to be seated, but well worth the wait.",

Very juicy and great sauce. They were pretty small though.  Then we had the sashimi that came with 9 pieces: yellowtail, tuna, and salmon. The fish was not as fresh as i would like, but my brother and sister liked it.  The last thing was the grilled scallops with peruvian corn. The corn was the best part. The scallops were coated with a very sweet sauce.  Our waiter Nick was a very handsome man with a beautiful smile! The servers were all professional and good looking! The service was great and very welcoming! I would definitely come back!!",

    "text": "I was meeting a former coworker for lunch who actually works in the back of house for the Venetian, and she suggested catching up at sushisamba.  I was a little skeptical about getting sushi in Vegas--after all where in the heck is the closest ocean?!  Nevertheless, our sushi and sashimi tasted very fresh and of good quality.   We split a combination platter and two rolls. I can't remember exactly which rolls we got, but one roll had pear in it. I would never have imagined utilizing pear in a sushi roll, but it was a perfect compliment to the raw fish.  That experience pretty much sums up sushisamba: a contemporary take on sushi rolls. Innovated flavor combinations and fresh fish!  In typical Vegas fashion, the interior is beautifully done and sets it apart from your ordinary sushi joint.  A tad pricy for sushi, but you get what you pay for, and at sushisamba you get quality and innovation.   Folks this ain't your run o' the mill sushi joint!",

Yes, I know I have said this a billion times before, but I realized something... I always seem to end up a sushi joint at some point in my Vegas trip. So next time, I will give it a try.  On this trip, I was only here for some drinks at the bar. The waitresses were friendly and service was fast. It was also nice that the place was in the hotel I was staying at. Ordered a number of drinks (liquor of course) and the pours were pretty good. Definitely worth the cash. Overall, I can't complain.  I just thought I would update my review to bump up to 4 stars. I definitely enjoyed my time there and think the place was deserving of more stars. Shout out to the cute bartenders there!",

    "text": "My friends and I were strolling through the Palazzo last evening looking for some good eats.  We were pulled in by stunning smells illuminating from Sushi Samba's cozy corner restaurant.  Service from the start was top notch.  We decided to sit bar-side.  The sous chef, Robert, came out and gave us a personal welcome for our first visit; followed by a generous on-the-house appetizer.  Sea Scallop with pesto magic.  One bite was packed full of a fresh, balanced flavor that took my taste buds to a place they haven't been in many years.  After one bite, I knew we had come to the right place.  On recommendation from the chef - we ordered Sea Bass with veggies and a sweet miso drizzle.  Now to me, Sea Bass if very rarely billed as a \"main course\" but wow - this dish was spectacular.  A must try for any fan of the sea.  The cocktails are inventive, unique and balanced.  Try one of their special Sake Martini's - tastes like you've never had before.    Sushi Samba is the real deal.  They made it perfectly clear that the restaurant intends to better serve their customers and grow it's gourmet creations .  All of their products are the pinnacle of fresh.  No doubt restocked daily.  The presentation of everything from drinks to dinner was carefully crafted with intention and purpose.  Quick service and an aim-to-please attitude top to bottom made us feel more like we were clients than customers.  We ended the night with a round of delicious fruit sake cocktails and a heart-felt thank you to Allen, the manager on duty.  In my opinion, the pricing is quite appropriate given the freshness, quality, service and atmosphere.  They nailed it, BRAVO!  So if you're a fan of fine dinning, service, sushi or delicious cocktails - I highly recommend you make plans to visit Sushi Samba.   Thanks for the incredible evening Sushi Samba, I'll be back soon!",

The difficulty I found was that the meal wasn't very memorable.  Although the roll selection was very unique, nothing stood out as a 'Wow, I'll remember this roll forever' type of experience.    For the price, it wasn't as good as it should have been.  Additionally, the service was lackluster.  The sushi came out super fast after we ordered, which is troubling considering it took 10 minutes just for the waiter to take our drink orders and then another 15 before the manager realized our order hadn't been taken yet.  Overall a decent meal that was expensive and not very memorable.",

We had already eating diner a couple of hours before hand.  So we figured we would go for a late night snack.  We went to Sushi Samba, and could not have made a better decision.  We were pretty indecisive about what to order.  So our waitress suggested that we answer a few of her questions, and she would suggest a meal for us.  That was perfect.  We had the Yellow Tail tacos which was delicious.  Very light, and refreshing.  Then we had the Sea Bass skewers.  Amazing sauce, and was great.  Then we ended up with the Spicy Tuna.  Great meal.  Great suggestions.  But the topper was the owner Liz.  She came over to our table.  She was very welcoming, and actually talked to us.  I didn't feel as if she was doing it, as part of some shtick.  She was very genuine.  Which was cool.   We ended the night with a vanilla chocolate cake for my wife's birthday.  Overall great experience.  When we go back to Vegas.

After being accused of lying and receiving some attitude, the hostess found us and then made up some lame excuse. Eventually we were seated, but after placing our drink order time began slowing down. After waiting a little while, us guys finally received our beers. Not until after I finished my large Kirin did the girls get their drinks. It wouldn't have been so bad if the place was packed. Then it came to our meals. We placed our order for sushi and to my surprise one order, which usually means two pieces, means one. What the hell. I could have gone to a better sushi bar and paid less. I spent $65 for 10 pieces of sushi. I could understand if I got some blowfish but I didn't. Squid and Uni nothing fancy. The rolls were nothing to brag about and then my wife ordered a steak. It was over cooked and had quite a bit of fat on it for a New York cut. It was also lightly seasoned and the sauces were bland. The presentation was way better than the taste.  We also had to continually remind the server that we were there Cuz of a birthday girl. Overall, none of us were impressed. Overpriced for nothing out of the ordinary food. If it wasn't for my wife killing it at the craps table. I would have been pissed paying for the dinner. Especially because the birthday girl wasn't happy and left hungry.",

We ordered a roll that was to have no rice and as a substitute for the seaweed they use cucumber that is sliced thin to wrap around the sashimi inside. Unfortunately after waiting for about 20 min for this roll the waitress came to tell us they made a mistake in the back and no longer have the cucumber.

    "text": "If your large party is looking for a restaurant where you walk in hungry and leave just as hungry and unsatisfied while you were just taken for a crazy price...BY ALL MEANS - this Sushi/ Brazilian restaurant is for you!   So their \"concept\" for a group of 8 guests....a waitress brings ONE menu for EVERYONE at the table. (Apparently there is a ration on menus at this restaurant). She happily tells you that you give her an \"idea\" of what you like and then SHE will decide what to bring to your table based off of what you tell her - the prices for this \"family\" style of ordering started at $50 per person and went up from there - NOT INCLUDING ALCOHOL OR DESSERT. WTH??? Oh, but you don't have to pay for something if you don't like it......supposably.   As she brings these TINY portions out to our table for us to fight over, we soon realize that no one is really getting what they wanted and no one is satisfied with what she is serving us. Some liked certain items, but honestly, the bowls of white rice was the most filling thing we ate. Even the black beans were terribly under seasoned - how can anyone screw up black beans??   Remember the \"if you don't like what she brings out, you don't need to pay for it\" rule? Well, the minute you complain about not liking something, the waitress gives attitude and acts frustrated at your lack of ability to communicate what you want her to bring you.... when most of the table did not get a chance to even see the menu in the first place.   After a meal that felt like we just ate at an Ethiopian Restaurant and still hungry, we chanced ordering a \"large plate\" dessert and some other people at our table ordered a \"small plate\" dessert. When the desserts come, our dessert was a VERY SMALL piece of cake on a VERY LARGE SAUCER PLATE.....and the our friends who ordered the small dessert was larger than our dessert, but on a SMALL PLATE....SO they didn't technically lie about the size of the plates, but lets just say they really need to rethink their menu and overall concept.   Ultimately, we left the restaurant $75 each lighter in our wallets -( as the tip was already added for the crappy service we did get.)  and feeling like we should have all gotten a jar or lube on our way in as we all felt assaulted at the end of our meal.  If I could have given a lower score, I would have! SUSHI SAMBA is a huge ripoff with crappy service and an even crappier concept. The one positive is the interior design of the restaurant was creative, which is the only thing positive I can say about ti, sadly.",

Scallops were amazing. Had some salmon and yellowtail sashimi that was fresh and perfect. And, a special take on a spicy tuna roll that was unbelievable. The service was fine. Not thrilling, but perfectly serviceable.",

    "text": "Our experience at Sushi Samba  at the Venetian Palazzo was FANTASTIC. Our waiter Ryan G and the manager Jason made our NIGHT! Ryan was super attentive to our table and even went back into the kitchen to look up the ingredients of an amazing sauce (our group of girls were all arguing about what it must be made out) and didn't mind that we continued to order several plates throughout the night. Jason also was extremely attentive to our table and stopped several times to make sure everything was to our liking. On top of that he also brought us a free drink tree (which is regularly $70 on the bar menu) when he learned we were celebrating my bachelorette weekend. The food was AMAZING, some of the best sushi we've eaten and we can't wait to come back. Jason and Ryan G. thank you for making our last meal in Vegas so spectacular!!",

The service was good and, if anything, overaccommodating. We found that the price fell in line with most other options at the strip, probably around $25 per person before drinks. I can't speak for the omnivores, but on the vegetarian side of the table we were very happy with the Amazonia roll, quinoa chaufa, and coconut rice. The avocado roll was cheap and great as a filler. Vegetarian/vegan food isn't always easy to find in Vegas, and this place had some great options that didn't seem like an afterthought on the menu. Recommended.",

My all time fav menu items are:  Sashimi tiradito - yellowtail, salmon: everything is so delicate Samba rolls - neo tokyo, bobo brazil, el topo, and rainbow dragon.  The rolls are not huge, actually prefer smaller rolls, difficult to fit everything into your mouth in one bite if the roll is 2 inches thick. Hot dish wise, try the Moqueca Mista, its to die for!  I always finish off my meals with this dish, never mind desserts!  Also, try this with a cocktail, I recommend the Caipirinha, my mouth is watering writing this review!",

We probably had to wait 20-30 minutes or so to get seated even though we had a reservation (it was a Saturday, not quite sure how it would be on any other days).  Anyway our waitor was nice.. Very knowledgable and friendly. The food was SO yum. The boyfriend and I ordered a whole bunch of things- Rainbow dragon roll, tiger shrimp tempura, sea bass, uni sushi, and after reading the previous reviews here on yelp, we ordered the yellowtail taquitos... So glad we did because they were DELICIOUS! Pretty pricey for a small taco but totally worth it. The minimum you could order is 2 and they're $6 each. Definitely would come back here for the taquitos and the sake!",

I loved the vibe of the place.... bu the most important part, the food, was just okay and truly nothing to write home about. It lacked depth, flavor, and overall \"WOW THIS IS AWESOME.\" Not one single dish stood out to me. I didn't like the melting pot of Japanese, Peruvian, and Brazilian. Stick with one and make it amazing. Don't dabble in all three. Perhaps that's me being a traditionalist, but so be it.  The waitress seemed put off by the large quantity of us at the table. She huffed and puffed constantly. She highly suggested that we pick a dollar amount and stick with it. When we asked if we could order something from the menu separately, it was frowned upon. We'd tell her what we liked/didn't like and they'd customize the menu for us - sticking to our chosen $$ range. If we didn't like something, they'd take it back and replace it with another item from the menu. In a way, kinda cool and makes sense but then again, it was frustrating. We couldn't pick things we eyed on the menu. We had to cross our fingers it showed up.   I won't go back. Okada blows this place out of the water. So does Sushi Roku. Go there instead if you're craving sushi while in Vegas.",

The whole experience comes off as just an expensive place to take a break and have a snack when you need a break from playing blackjack.   And, judging by her lack of interest and canned conversation, my server might as well have been a wind up toy needing rewinding.   The Latin fusion thing doesn't work as well here as it does in NYC. There is definitely better sushi on the strip.",

    "text": "Went for my first time with a group of 7 and was blown away at the service, ambiance and not to mention the food was AH-MAZING. I've been to a lot of top notch sushi restaurants, and this was probably the most unique concept with Japanese/Brazilian/Peruvian inspired dishes.   With a group of 7 with a variety of tastes, likes and dislikes, one of the best things Sushi Samba does is offer a chef's selection of 3 or 4 courses based on (A) how much each person wants to spend (we chose $40/person) and (B) what each person likes, dislikes, is allergic to, etc. and (C) how many courses (we did 3).  We didn't know what to expect, but the first course/starters came out and there was a piece of each starter for each person (don't you hate when there is an odd number?!) and the girl who likes chicken over fish got a steak skewer instead of raw tuna. The second course included this fabulous Peruvian grilled and butter sauteed corn that I am seriously in love with. Each kernel is the size of your index fingernail, sweet and lightly grilled for a slight chewy texture. Where can I find this at my local grocer or farmers market?! The third course included a variety of sushi including non-fish, non-raw rolls for the non-fish eaters in our group.   We were a hungry bunch and left very happy. Bring your appetite because the portions are nice. Service was 5 stars with attentive staff start to finish. Our server came by regularly to check-in, the staff orchestrated plate and settings changes after each course, and we even got a complimentary strawberry vodka drink on the house.",

I always get the same staple items: Peruvian Corn, Shishito peppers, yellow tail taquitos, Neo Tokyo Roll, and random other things I am in the mood for.  On top of their amazing food, I love their drinks.  I'm a huge mojito lover and they have one of the best mojitos I have ever had.  The service is always great and the atmosphere is always fun!  Great place to go when in Vegas.  Music was also amazing.",

Cocktails ~ Bushido ~ really great The rolls were okay but didn't feel that they were memorable  I would have given this place 4 stars but only getting 3 due to its service.  Our waiter was great initially but somewhere in the middle he kind of ditched us to go attend to a bigger table.  We were about to order more food but we gave up when we realized that our waiter had disappeared on us.  After 15 minutes of waiting for our waiter, we called another waiter to see what happened to ours when the manager finally came to tell us that our waiter was busy.

    "text": "We stopped here for a little lunch during happy hour on our trip.  The atmosphere of this place was awesome, I really liked the decor as well.  A very modern looking establishment.    The happy hour menu is limited, but not bad at all.  For happy hour my wife and I got the Spicy Tuna Roll, A philly roll, shrimp tempura roll, and chicken anticuchos.  I LOVED the chicken anticuchos.  Super tasty, tender pieces of chicken with a nice teriyaki sauce.  The spicy tuna roll WAS spicy.  Spicier than what I'm used to.  I wasn't big on the shrimp tempura mainly because if i'm eating sashimi or rolls, I like it cold. I just dont jive to well on warm sushi haha.  When it comes to warm fish, BBQ salmon or halibut is my game.  We both ordered drinks, I ordered a Mojito and the wife had a Caiprianha.  The Mojito I had wasn't working for me.  It was awesome they put fresh mint in it, but i hated getting foliage in my mouth.  Also, it was rather strong.....I like a strong drink trust me, but something was different about the strength of this drink.  Same on the Caiprianha.  Texas De Brazil made an AWESOME caiprianha, so I dont know what was so different between the 2.  We did end up spending around 50 bucks at happy hour which was a shock.  We did enjoy it, and it is totally worth a stop.",

The boys lured us with promise of 20-pc McNuggets (yeah.... we're that type of girls :P).... luckily, we ended up at Sushi Samba instead. The restaurant calls itself a fusion of Japanese-Brazilian-Peruvian. It definitely is fusion - but done very well. They recommend to order dishes to share and our waitress was really nice in making sure the servings matched the number of people in our group.   What stands out in memory? The salt and pepper squid. Berkshire Pork Belly ramen (the bf had to be reminded to play nice and share ;) Crispy taquitos!!!!! Chilean sea bass (how did they get that on a skewer and yet still tastes so tender?!). BoBo Brazil samba roll.   The only reason I'm giving a 3 star review instead of 4 is that the servings are rather small for the price. We did all leave super full though. And I rather wish someone had ordered the ceviche - I bet it's delicious!",

    "text": "Last night my fiancee and I had tickets to a show at the Palazzo and decided to grab a bite to eat at SushiSamba. We have never eaten there, but we love sushi and Brazilian food so we figured we'd give it a try.  Wow - am i glad we did. We live in Las Vegas and eat out quite often. I have always believed that while the food in a restaurant is important, a review on food may not be that helpful.  We all have different tastes - for example, we are not big \"spicy food\" eaters. So someone with different tastes might not find our food review that helpful.  However, one aspect of dining i believe is extremely important, and also very helpful in a review, is the service. And, while the food was excellent (I'll get to it) the service is what really made this restaurant stand out.   Service: Our server was Mike D and the manager that evening was Allen Holmes. The first thing i noticed was Mike's product knowledge.  He introduced himself and asked if we had been there before. Once he found out we were new to the joint, he began asking us what we liked and explaining both the food and extensive sake menus. We found out through Allen that the servers go through extensive training and try all of the food as well as most of the Sake at tastings they have each week. That way they can learn how to pair the food with different drinks. Mike suggested a number of dishes and we ended up ordering most of them. The appetizers arrived pretty quickly and as I'll describe below, some were nothing short of amazing. Upon the suggestion of Mike, my fiancee ordered the Sea Bass and I the Rib-Eye special. Both were so insanely good we just could not believe it.  Mike was attentive and very engaging. He didn't bother us, but at the same time he made sure we were enjoying our dinner and seemed to enjoy taking a moment to get to know us. It seemed to make him happy we were having such a good time at dinner.  This is NOT something you see with most servers in Las Vegas. To add to the service, the bar manager Allen stopped by our table and and chatted with us, making sure we were having a good time. We spent some time talking with him about the restaurant - He seems to really know his business and it was impressive to hear how much he enjoys working there.   We didn't have time for dessert since the show was about to start, but we looked at the menu and told Mike we would be back after the show.  We went back for dessert and Mike made a point to say how nice is was to be able to serve us twice in one night. Allen also came back and said hello - and brought over some Farofa (Brazilian dish that has the consistency of sand - not my favorite, but she loves it) because my Fiancee had commented that next time she wanted to try it - He remembered. What I also found was pretty amazing was that Mike had saved the bottle of water we had ordered at dinner on ice - in case we returned. Since it hadn't been finished - we didn't have to order a new bottle. WHO DOES THAT!!   Food: As for the food, the appetizers ranged from OK to amazing.  The Tuna Tataki and sushi roll we ordered were OK. The tempura shrimp and vegetables were very good - light and crispy, not oily. The best appetizer for me was the GYOZA. I eat steamed dumplings everywhere i go if possible and these were the best i have EVER had. I wanted to order 3 more, but decided to wait for my meal. Glad I did!. My Fiancee ordered the Sea Bass. Mike said it was the most popular item on the menu.  We understand why.  The best she has ever eaten. I agreed after tasting it. The sweet sauce that comes with it was insane.  The Rib-eye special I ordered came in a covered dish - sizzling like a fajita. It was tender, juicy and cooked to perfection (medium rare). Rib-eye is my favorite dish and this was just different enough (yet the same) to make it one of my all time favorites. Unfortunately, its a special, so I'm sure it wont be around forever.  Lastly, when we returned for dessert we ordered the cheesecake and sundae - both were deconstructed versions of the two dishes. Very tasty - especially the caramelized popcorn they use in the sundae. I finished my meal with a nice port wine and cup of cappuccino.  All in all it was such an unexpected treat it made a night out in Vegas spectacular.  Which is rare for 2 people who have lived here for over 14 years.",

    "text": "I flipping LOVE SushiSamba. I've been here 3 times and it's just been incredible. This most recent trip, we were a group of 9 girls for a bachelorette party. We had lucked out by getting reservations the day of and they didn't make us wait. I thought they seated us in a weird spot...but no, our reservations were just so early, the place wasn't that full, but the table ended up being fine.  We decided to do the omakase style for around $50/person. They brought out the cocktail tree with 9 glasses of the Samba Juice which was incredible and such a great way for them to start wooing us, haha.  - First course: fried green beans with truffle aioli (my fave!), grilled jalepenos (big hit!), and edamame. - Second course: Fish tacquitos (loved the shell, very crispy), a mushroom tacquito & large salad for the vegetarian, and pork pot stickers (good not great).  - Third course: the famed Chilean Sea Bass skewers (<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fmelt.in&s=727ac5fa71833539fa0be1d6f25d7c989ff2e93aa5b6f204321f49ddf00dbcbd\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">melt.in</a>.your.mouth), scallops with like a chimichurri sauce (delicious), and the Peruvian corn (so unique).  - Fourth course: Meat/mushroom coconut milk \"curry\" (I hate coconut milk, and this was the one dish that we didn't make a considerable dent in...and they don't serve rice with this! Weird). - Fifth course: Sushi. There were 3 different fish sushi rolls (salmon, tuna, and something else) and then 3 vegetarian (avocado, cucumber, and sweet potato--sweet potato was my fave!). They then brought out the dessert for my friend, which was comp'd which was nice.  In my opinion, I felt like the chef prepared way too many fish dishes for this particular group because we had a vegetarian, we had someone who was allergic to shellfish, and we had 3 people who didn't like fish...and yet, we got A LOT of fish. I think a lot of people go to SushiSamba and expect sushi...but it's fushion, it's not traditional sushi. I would definitely recommend doing the omakase style to start out--you can do it for $30-$75 per person and it's really fun. I rate it 4 stars because I think they should be more creative for vegetarians--vegetarians eat more than mushrooms :) But the service is GREAT and the food is amazing. Definitely one of my most consistent favorite places in Vegas.",

    "text": "Even though it is on the pricier side, it was worth it. My soul was happy with me after I ate here. In fact, my soul asked me to eat twice here. I happily obliged. The first time we were only there for a quick snack and a drink, but the second time we actually ate a meal there, so I'll review the second time.   I should give one caveat: I'm not particularly familiar with authentic Brazilian or Japanese food. That said, I found this fusion restaurant both intriguing and completely intoxicating.   The waitress we had the first time was good, but I really remember our second waiter, Max. He was very attentive and gave fantastic recommendations, but wasn't pushy about it. Most importantly, you can tell he's actually EXCITED about the food. It made a huge difference, because seeing someone so excited to tell you about the ingredients, how the food is prepared, and what flavors are going on together really adds to a wonderful food experience, in my opinion. The waiter ended up recommending a $60 per person meal, a tasting menu of sorts. It sounds like a lot, but given the prices, it was really very fair considering the amount of food we got. As such, I'm not going to talk about every little thing, but more the highlights.   The Peruvian Corn was addicting. It was a little closer to the hominy side of the corn spectrum, but it was buttery and had just a bit of texture. If it doesn't come as a side, I absolutely recommend trying it as a separate side dish. It DOES come as a side to the sea bass skewers, which I think were my single most favorite thing I tried there. It was buttery and delicious, and so flavorful in little bites. I wish I could describe it better than just \"flavorful,\" but I'm not even sure how to describe how delicious it was. I'll just say that while I was eating it, I hoped it would never stop (so inappropriate but I can't help it: that's what she said).   Hamachi tacos and a plate of various sashimi were incredible. I liked the sashimi just a little more because the bold flavors of the sauces surprisingly married well with the fish flavor, without overpowering it.   The most surprising part of the night: there was a sushi roll that included melted mozzerella. Yes. Mozzerella and salmon. I was SO skeptical of this one, and it took me a few tries to get used to it, but once I did, it was like a warm blanket. If you can push aside the weirdness, it's a good roll.   Another piece of fabulosity we had was a yellowtail seviche (they do spell it with an \"s\"). It was tangy but still let the other flavors show, and that is one of the items (along with the sea bass) I will absolutely order again next time I am in Vegas.   Last, but certainly not least, the waiter concocted a duck hot-pot for us. I've not had much exposure to duck, and was weary of this one, but it was in a buttery sauce with lots of mushrooms, and it was incredibly silky and rich. Needless to say, after all this food, we were STUFFED!!! And of course, very happy. The manager came out to talk to us about the food as well, and I thought that was nice.   I also tried the cucumber martini and the blackberry mojito. The mojito was good, but not particularly special. The cucumber martini, on the other hand, was light and refreshing and absolutely amazing.   Sushi Samba is definitely first on my list next time I come to Vegas!",

Tanice sold us on their tasting menu. We were able to pick our price and she took care of the rest. She tailor made the selections to suit our taste. The food was delicious. We had dishes we never would have ordered on our own. The taquitos and sea bass are a MUST have. THANK YOU Tanice for a wonderful night! They are lucky to have you!!",

    "text": "Bachelorette party of 12 girls. I called to make reservations and they informed me on the phone that with a large party of our size, we would need to do a set menu. They said that the waiter would work with us on the day of to put together a menu to work around any restrictions we had.   We were running a little late (you can imagine how that can happen with1 2 girls) so I called to let them know and they were very nice and accommodating. They said not to worry and that they would hold our table for us. We arrived at the restaurant and were seated at a big table in the back of the restaurant (the restaurant is pretty big). The table itself was huge and we had plenty of space between the 12 of us.  So, between the group of 12, we had the following restrictions: one pregnancy, allergies to peanuts, shrimp, and shellfish. The waiter asked us what amount we wanted to keep it to and we told him to keep it around $50/person. We ended up with the following:  +Otsumami assortment of edamame, green bean tempura, shishito - all delicious. The dipping sauce had truffle in it... who doesn't love truffles?? +Berkshire Pork Gyoza - pretty good gyoza. Wasn't a big fan of the pumpkin dipping sauce.. +Yellowtail Taquitos - delicious!  +Sea Bass Anticucho and Chicken Anticucho - the sea bass was amazing (as everyone else has already mentioned). It is so buttery and melts in your mouth. +A ton of sushi rolls and some sashimi - pretty good... I would say their strength is in more of their cooked food than their sushi and sashimi. I always prefer sashimi over rolls because the rolls are usually too fusiony for me but the other girls loved them +Rio Grande Churrasco - 5 diff meats with 3 diff dipping sauces. Very good but so full that we couldn't eat much  Service was great. We informed our waiter that we needed to be out the door by 9:30 PM and he made sure that the food just kept coming. By the end of dinner, we were so stuffed that we couldn't even eat all of the churrasco and had no space for dessert. We even came under budget by a little bit and were all way overly stuffed.   Food was pretty good... but more than anything, it's a fun atmosphere that's good for groups. Would definitely go back with a large party.",

Thank goodness the server stepped in and said, just tell me what you like, what you're allergic to, and how much you want to spend, and i can put together a great dinner for you. So we let him take the reigns and it was AMAZING. he brought several courses of Japanese, Brazilian, and Peruvian dishes and everything was delicious. I was so glad to be able to try foods ive never had before. I dont even remember everything that we ate, but i do remember the donut holes for dessert. they were soo good! at the end of the night we probably spent about $50 per person and it was all worth it for such an awesome dining experience.",

The drinks were good, I had mojitos, my group also had a strawberry martini type drink, which I was told was too sweet, and the lemon samurai, which was pretty tasty.  The food was excellent, we had:  Yellowtail Seviche - everyone's favorite, excellent dish, great fish, great seasoning/sauce to it.  I'd have more right now if I could. Kobe Beef - very good as well, served with mushrooms and sliced super thin. Beef Tenderloin - which was cooked on the Japanese grill and came out very smoky, it was good, not great. Rock Shrimp Tempura - also quite tasty, for such a small dish, there was a lot of shrimp packed in.  Nice spicy sauce to it as well. Sushi Roll - can't remember the name of it, but it was salmon topped with melted mozzarella and little fried onion things.  That was the one dish that was a miss in my book.  The onion overpowered the rest of the dish.  Wasn't bad, but I didn't think all the flavors worked that well together.  The setting is very cool, relaxed, and our waiter was very attentive and helpful.",

    "text": "Talk about a hidden gem. This place is nestled deep within the Palazzo shops, but don't let that stop you from going as it is definitely worth the trek. On our recent visit here, we had a variety of sushi and grilled items and everything was excellent. Some highlights:   shishito - nicely charred, spicy, drizzled with oil and sea salt. Very good. Best shishito I've had. Organic chicken - a little heavy with the sauce but still a good eat. Sea Bass - yum! Both the chicken and the sea bass were served on a bed of Peruvian corn, which was very tasty.  Rainbow Dragon roll - nicely crafted roll of fresh eel and avocado with just the right amount of sauce. Kanpachi - delicious with lots of wasabi.  For drinks I had the Caipirinha--a Brazilian concoction--which was not only excellent but also a steal at only $10.  I would deduct a star as our staff failed to mentioned certain items were out of stock after we had ordered them, but I realize this place is very new and they're still getting their act together. I'll definitely come back again.  (My rating scale: 5-Outstanding, sets the standard for others. 4-Very good, would bring friends/family here. 3-Decent but wouldn't recommend to others. 2-Disappointing. 1-A waste of everyones' time.)",

    "text": "Having been to their Sister Establishments; China Grill Co, I had high expectation for this place.  I am a huge fan of Asian Fusion anything.  I would give this place 5 except for the small tables we were sat at.  This place was extremely busy with your traditional lounge down tempo music playing.  It has a huge projector screen displaying various images of sport or anime.  We made RSVP and got seated within 10 minutes.    Here we go, the host sat us right by the server isle between the entrance and the kitchen, not impress and not off to a good start.  After getting bumped several times I asked to be moved.  Then they moved us to a table that was so close to another couple that we might as well been sharing the bill.  There was no room to move.  I told my girl to wash her hands first before sitting down because we have to pull the table out and asked the people on both side to excuse us.  So far, even worse start.    Now the food, we were told that the portions are small, so be prepared to order a lot and to damage the AMEX.  We asked for some recommendation from our server whom by the way was absolutely excellent and was there for everything we need.  He even apologized for the tomato can seating we were in.  We ordered the Tuna Taquitos which was unique with taste and textured - 5.00 per pc.  We had the Yellow Tail Carpaccio with yellow sauce - 18.00 for 5 pcs and worth every penny. I had the Filet Mignon,small and pricey but again worth it.  Jennifer had the Sea Bass, again soft and unique flavors, we also had the lamb chop from the Robata and it is the best lamb chop I had recently.  We also had a few rolls as well, small but delicious.  For desserts we had the Donut Holes dipped in melting chocolate.  Again,the great taste!!!    The service is impeccable, even with small tables, the drinks were unique a bit soft, but the flavors were remarkable.  The portions are extremely small, but again, the taste are unique - Japanese with Brazilian.  The table next to us were from Europe (whom thought this place was as of value, I guest that what happens when you get a Euro into a dollar; instant discount) recommend we try the sampler menu - 80.00 per person but 7 courses. The server did too.  The next time we will since we did spend over 200.00 there.    Sushi Samba is now my top 5 places to eat at, we can't wait to go back there in a few months.",

The tasting menu allowed us to try a variety of dishes but a lot of them too!  So much that in the end, I was too full to finish my portion!  I thought the service here was more than awesome! Before they started to bring out the food, they went around to ask about people's allergies and who doesn't like sushi and things like that.  After getting it all down, they proceeded to bring out food.  If they were to bring out something that had something that someone was allergic to, then that person would get a substituted dish!  I thought that was pretty awesome!  We got so many that I can't remember them all but I'll list out the ones I do remember!  Tuna tartar -delish! scallops - double delish! sashimi - delish delish! sea bass - the best of the night! delish delish delisssh! tacos - spicy!! steak filet - it was ook, a bit on the dry side for my taste peruvian corn - this was pretty interesting! gyoza - very big and delish pieces! vegetable rolls - the sesame dipping sauce was pretty good!  i'm sure there were more but i wasn't disappointed with any! everything was good!    the dessert i could have passed on, it was fondue. i think i'm not such a big fan of fondue!   but i would definitely come here again!",

Not as ridiculously embarrassing as other vegas sushi restaurant's I've been to- Palms Hotel and Casino- I'm looking at you- but there still was a moderately high laugh factor.  I would never come here if I wasn't staying at the Palazzo, but since I was- it wasn't THAT bad.  The sake sommelier was good, as was the sake itself.  The waiter was pushy- recommending a fried appetizer combo platter? Um- dude- no.  Something I noticed at the Palazzo is that all the waiters at the all the restaurants assume that you're a bumpkin who knows nothing about fine dining.  Which, I suppose, is a pretty good bet.  So-so, maybe check it out if you're there. Prices were fine for vegas.  Pacing was good.",

    "text": "My friends and I were staying at the Palazzo and I thought to try Sushisamba for my sister's bachelorette dinner.  We made reservations at 10:15pm and upon arrival the bar area and the dining area looked pretty full.    The decor was dark and interesting, with black and white classic Japanese films airing on a large big screen and some classy art/anime con another wall.  My friend and I had a discussion about how we appreciated the scene.      Their menu features a wide array of items: small platters, appertizers, large platters, sushi.   I checked out their menu from the Palazzo website prior so I knew what prices to expect.  We started off with a bottle of sake - they have a pretty extensive sake list - and the price was reasonable for a bottle of sake.    I had ordered the rock fish ($29) and it was prepared very elegantly and was also very very delicious -sweet and moist.  I let my friends sample my dish and everyone really enjoyed it. 2 of my friends ordered the teriyaki chicken ($25) and it wasn't your typical chicken teriyaki - the chicken was served with the bone in and was accompanied with purple mashed potatoes.  I think this was probably my favorite chicken teriyaki dish I have sampled before and the others agreed.  Others at the table ordered sushi, ramen, fries, etc.  There were 9 of us and out of the group, it impressed 3 of us (1 person was myself).  I appreciate good quality food and I thought the prices were reasonable - it is Las Vegas and it is a trendy restaurant in the Palazzo so it's expectable for the prices of cuisine.  Most restaurants on the Las Vegas Strip are usually typically pricey for the amount of food you receive anyway.  I typically like upscale restaurants.  On the other hand, the other girls at the table complained of hunger and that it was expensive.  They didn't agree that ramen for $18 was worth it - they are used to $5 ramen at a no-thrills restautant.  Yes it is only ramen, but it had a delicate lemon grass flavor, it was a decent size, and it is generally a good price for an upscale restaurant.  So this review offers insight for 2 different perspectives.  It was light fare, but perfect for going out to clubs after.    Service was superb.  Our waiter served us well; had friendly casual discussions periodically, and offered to take us into Sugarcane - the club.lounge attached to the restaurant.  Granted, the club/lounge was empty and only had 2 people dancing, it was a nice gesture and this review is solely based on the restaurant.    If you appreciate upscale quality food that emerges to be different and unique in a chic environment try Sushisamba :)",

Letting the server bring you out random dishes, is a cool concept. The drawback is they say if you don't like them they will take it off your bill however they bring out usually 1 for the table and chances are everyone will try something meaning there will be nothing left to take back so its kind of a con because there is only one serving per person.",

I would have to saw the overall food quality was everything I expected from the Palazzo.  The plates are more tapas styled with the Lobster tacos and Apps being very tiny in size but gargantuan in flavor.    I would recommend that if you go with a large appetite to look on the menu for the \"large plates\" section lol.... the 3-meat and 5-meat for $40 and $60 respectfully will be filling enough for 2 people and not break the bank if your on a budget... don't sleep on the sushi rolls and bring your own Sake and have them cork it.... Sake prices in the restaurant are silly.",

    "text": "Went here twice on a recent foray in Vegas - once for dinner at the bar and a second time just drinking at the bar.  Sushi-wise, the restaurant does a good job. Their rolls are creative and beautifully presented. Check out the Rainbow Dragon, as the use of red peppers offers a pretty un-traditional take on Japanese sushi rolls. It's definitely expensive to grab a meal here once you tack on drinks, but I would say it's worth it. Don't come expecting traditional/formal sushi, although you can definitely get that if you come here. I would recommend being adventurous and getting something that is unique to the restaurant. The portions aren't huge and while it's easy to complain about that, well, this ain't the Wynn buffet people! Consider it your opportunity to splurge and try a plethora of dishes to widen your palate. Or, since their kitchen is open well past midnight, stroll in later in the night for a post-gambling/show/club-hopping snack.  Samba-wise, the ambiance fits the decor they're trying to promote - some sort of trendy and dark restaurant. If you want a quiet meal, don't come here (actually - why are you even in Vegas??).  Drink-wise, this place excels. The Tequilana Caliente is a tasty cocktail that packs a punch. The Caipirinha uses high quality Leblon cachaca. And if those two aren't good enough (or you're like me and you drink both cocktails and want a third), try the Chu-Cumber sochu - our bartender made this into a shot, which went down so smoothly even though it was basically all alcohol. The one downside that evening was that they were out of their plums for their Bushido drink, a cocktail that has daikon in it too. I guess that means there's always something to come back to.",

The restaurant was packed and the decor is absolutely gorgeous.   For 2 we had:  - Edamame organic soybeans, sea salt, lime - Rock Shrimp Tempura golden pea shoot, snap pea jullienne, spicy mayo, black truffle vinaigrette - Beef Tenderloin and Aji Panca anticuchos - Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass roasted organic vegetables and oshinko - BoBo Brazil roll* seared wagyu beef, avocado, kaiware, shiso, red onion, chimichurri - Green Envy* tuna, salmon, asparagus, wasabi pea crust, aji amarillo-key lime mayo  Everything was delicious! The rock shrimp tempura and sea bass were amazing. I wasn't a huge fan of the beef anticuchos, they were seasoned almost too much. The rolls were pretty small and didn't stand out as much as the other food. Service was on point, and I would definitely come back!",

As a restaurant with three kitchens (Japanese, Brazillian & Peruvian, don't quote me on that last one), the diversity of dishes you can consume is great.   Every time a dish was brought out for us, Max would sit down for a couple seconds and explain each dish. It was really fun not knowing what came out next! For about $70/person (with tip) we got:  dumplings and ceviche four types of sashimi Peruvian corn & grilled miso seabass albacore tuna roll & el topo roll braised duck breast with Japanese mushrooms  All of which were AMAZING. Do the \"custom menu.\" It's what makes this place unique and fun!",

Not to say that there isn't just sushi here, the ideas filling the pages of this Japanese/Brazilian/Peruvian fusion menu are pretty extensive.  It's more like three styles you can mix and match from rather than True fusion concocted dishes.  My crew was hungry for fish, so we stuck to primarily the pescatarian options.  Based on what I was able to try, it shook down like this:  The 3's Spicy tuna & spicy yellowtail were just so so. Edamame - could have done without the lime Salmon sashimi -nothing mind blowing, but edible    The 4's Snapper sashimi - a larger cut than the other sashimi, only the fish skin was rough on the tongue. Eel/Avocado roll - tasty with decent cuts of unagi Pork belly skewers - good marinated taste, though small in size    The 5's Yellowtail Belly sashimi - Ask for it, it's off the menu, but the chef had some available the day I was there.  Very fresh and the best sashimi at the table by far. Yellowtail Jalapeno - super hot and spicy, it hurt so good.  Overall, the portions are small and the price can get up there if you order a lot of food, but overall I was pleased with the food and quality of the fish.  I would make my way back again if I am looking for fish in the desert.",

He recommended a custom \"dining experience\" for about $50-60 per person, based on our likes and dislikes. Food just kept coming out and we had no idea what to expect, but Michael really hit the nail on the head with everything he picked for us.  Some of the highlights:  - yellowtail tacos - yellowtail in lemongrass sauce - sea bass (I don't eat sea bass, but my friends were raving about it!). The Peruvian corn that came with it was excellent  - some kind of steak, cooked medium rare served with rice and beans - a sushi platter with spicy tuna, California, and shrimp tempura rolls  Sushisamba is really great for groups, and since you can customize a meal based on your budget, it can be relatively affordable, too. And every dish was amazing! I definitely recommend it, and hope to try brunch at one of their NYC locations.",

They try really hard to dress up their sushi and rolls with interesting sauces and for the most part pull it off but I prefer traditional sushi joints that wow you with the freshness of the fish and not the add ons.   One thing I highly recommend is the Kobe beef. We chose the Ishiyaki which roughly translates to \"hot rock\" in Japanese. They bring out a black rock that is heated to 600 degrees along with a large array of oils, sauces, and salts. The waiter gave us a short lesson on how to prepare the meat and we went to town. Preparing the meat ourselves added a nice social aspect to the business dinner but be aware that seven slices of thin Kobe beef costs $150. Cheers",

If you go in a group and they ask to \"put together some courses for the table\" you will pay and you will pay very very dearly. This seems to be their normal mode with big groups (6-10) as we have had them ask the last 3 times we have gone. The previous times we ended up with great food and probably spent a little more than we intended.   This last trip was over the top. They kept the courses coming including the Hot Rock Kobe Beef. This was a super cool food experience and great tasting- but $160 PER PLATE? Frankly I'd refer to the wait staff as salespeople who did a darn good job giving my Platinum card a major workout.   I have no idea how Yelp can rate this $$$ as it should be $$$$ with maybe an extra $ tossed on for good measure.   Overall- awesome food, deceptive \"meal suggestions\" and crazy prices.

I stay away from the stuff like the plague and was so pleased to see a large well stocked menu of items I could enjoy apart from the typical \"chicken teriyaki\".   Naturally I love Brazilian food so Sushi Samba was a great choice for me. Over my some odd 7 trips to Vegas last year, we ate here 3 times.   One time we opted for a \"omakase\" menu, which means trust the chef, where you let you waiter know a price point, food restrictions, or requests and they form a menu for you. It turned out to be wonderful! Everyone was please with the selections, and left full and satisfied.   Some of my favorite items are the caramelized plantains which are sweet and tender with a delightful crisp. I also love the seared Kobe beef served sashimi style, with ponzu sauce. This is my favorite dish, the tender beef coated in a zippy ponzu gelee is such a balanced and flavorful dish, I highly recommend it. I also have had a few of the duck dishes, which neither knocked my socks off.   A few things I don't like about the joint is the slow service. It takes about 2.5 hours for dinner and when you are dying to hit those craps tables, that seems like forever. Second is the loud thumping club music. I understand they are trying to invoke the feeling of rhythm and sex into their food, but it ends up just being annoying. When I have to shout at my group to have a conversation and I'm not bumping and grinding on a dance floor, that's a problem.  In the sea of celebrity chef owned restaurants its nice to see a place that isn't boasting a famous name still be tasty and successful. I suggest paying a visit, perhaps with some ear plugs in your pocket.",

    "text": "SUSHISAMBA is a restaurant you come eat at more for the surroundings and chic ambiance, unless you really enjoy overpriced Japanese food (er, I should say Japanese-Brazilian). Their fish is fresh, but I still don't think that justifies the jack-up in prices. We came here for lunch on a Friday and it was pretty empty, so we got seated right away. We ordered:  -Berkshire Porkbelly Ramen (Spicy Lemongrass Broth, Bok Choy, Bean Sprout, Cilantro, Cancha $18): Not a bad size for the price I guess, and our server was nice enough to split it into two bowls for us since he knew we were sharing. The soup broth is SPICY though- it's that spice with a huge initial kick but then peters out. They also don't skimp on the porkbelly, so that was nice. But I probably wouldn't re-order. -Yellowtail Jalapeno $7: 6 pieces for $7- not a bad deal. It was a standard yellowtail jalapeno roll, nothing bad or good to say. -Salmon Avocado $6: 6 pieces- probably the best deal at the restaurant. The size of the rolls were a little bigger, and salmon and avocado together are delicious! -Spicy Tuna $7.75: 6 pieces I believe, and this was your standard spicy tuna, but less spicy than a lot of places.  I probably should have ordered their fusion sushi with foie gras and other crazy toppings if I wanted to be impressed, but I really couldn't justify spending $20 on one sushi roll for lunch.. In any case, come here to eat if you enjoy posh surroundings, and don't mind high prices.",

If you aren't into the raw sushi experience, there is plenty to try.  If you are into the raw, go, go, go.  Either way, you will create a memory.",

The seating area is very noisy and you are sitting too close to strangers so it's awkward and not worth the high cost to be sitting so close like they pack people in at buffets. The nigiri sushi had so much wasabi it made me wonder what the chef was trying to hide in the quality of the fish. I think the quality was good, but again for the price point I would have expected amazing and it was just not awful.",

Our waitress was honest about everything and was not trying to get me to order a bunch of extra stuff.  We got the scallop small plate- AMAZING, rock shrimp tempura- AMAZING, chilean sea bass w/ peruvian corn- AMAZING fish and the corn was something new (not for me,) and the LIMA roll- VERY GOOD!!!!  For drinks we has the Pisco Punch - YES PLEASE and 2 shots of some pink vodka goodness our waitress recommended.  Everything was top notch.  The place is hip, trendy, what you want from a Vegas dinner/pre-drink spot.  Gals, including ourselves were decked out and fab!!  We made friends with the chicks next to us, was just so much fun.  The tables are close to one another, but we didn't mind at all.    To top the evening off, and these are the things that I remember, my eyelash was falling off (hahahaha!)  I couldn't get it back on and asked the hostess if she had any glue since I could see her huge gorgeous eyelashes were False as well.  She hooked me up!!  I was good to go!!!    Thanks Sushi Samba!!  Great evening!  BTW- this place is $$$$ but we knew that going in.    LOVED IT!!!!!!",

The only drawback is it can get quite noisy during their peak hours so if your looking to have a nice quiet dinner this is not the place.  Also the food will take a bit long so don't come when your starving or you will be annoyed.    The rolls were excellent and tasted very fresh.  Their steak with the chimichurri sauce was also another one of my favorites.  The portions are not huge so it's good to order more than just a few dishes when you are sharing.  It adds up pretty quickly so be prepared.    Overall a great experience and definitely will return to try some other dishes.",

Our waitress on Friday night wasn't that great, but the service was awesome Saturday night.  The only complaint I have is the birthday dessert...it sucked.",

Our waiter suggested he choose a tasting menu according to our party size (keeping in mind the 1 girl who couldn't eat raw fish) and our budget ($50 per girl). Smartest thing we did entire trip!! Upon hearing we were there for a bachelorette party, a free round of shots!  The standouts were the green bean tempura with truffle aioli, wagyu beef gyoza and sea bass skewers. But the yellowtail seviche tacos with chili foam sauce stole the whole damn show. YUM.   Not so yummy turned out to be the rolls, but we just packed it up and brought it for the girls in the hotel room that were recuperating from the night before. They thought it was delicious. I think we were just full by then.",

I changed my reservation twice and they made it work. Mind you it was memorial day weekend and the restaurant was very busy. We ended up being seated after five minutes of waiting.   We were greeted by the waiter and he was really friendly. He managed to tell us about the different kind of sakis. Unfortunately, we did not end up ordering it. We ended up ordering beers instead.   To start off my palette, I order the miso soup which was made with cilantro instead of seaweed. It was a nice surprise and different from the generic miso soup. I would definitely order it again. I stumbled upon the yellowtail taquitos on the menu and made sure to order that. It was fantastic. Although they do need to change the name to tacos because it could be misleading. The fish melted in your mouth. The combination of flavors was exquisite. After I order a tuna cut roll and it was mouthwatering. The quality of the fish was fresh and tasty. I was very full after that and did not end up ordering dessert. They seemed to have great options.   Overall, I was very satisfied. I would definitely come here again and recommend this sushi place to anybody.",

I took my boyfriend and he absolutely LOVED it! The miso sea bass melts in your mouth. It comes with a large enough portion of Peruvian corn that I shouldn't have ordered it as an appetizer, through. We sampled a couple ceviche and sashimi and loved them. My 4 year old had their sushi bites with miso soup. She fell after eating half and we finished hers off. Then she woke back up and got upset we ate her food...so I ordered it again. She ate half and fell asleep (wow! It feels like deja vu) again! So we finished it again . But it was delicious!! I'd definitely go back. Whatever you do, get the miso sea bass. It's soooo worth it!",

We were crazy late for our reservation, but the hostess was accommodating and still got us squared away without too much of a wait. The energy level is high, so this is definitely a good places for large groups / celebrations.   As far as the food goes, we literally ordered everything off the menu. The Sashimi, Duck breast and Tonkotsu Ramen (w/Pork Belly) were all stand out dishes. Drinks were also bomb! We ordered some type of drink assortment tower - can't recall the name, they were delish. Can't wait to get back here!",

    "text": "This was one of my favorite meals during our week-long Vegas trip.  We stayed in the Jockey Club, which is connected to the Cosmopolitan, so the majority of our meals took place in there because they have a lot of decent restaurants.  I had this place bookmarked in the weeks leading up to the trip, but I didn't really pay attention to where exactly it was on the strip. I also hadn't planned well for the weather, and brought mostly black dresses.  Well, this place is located in the Venetian. If you don't know how far the Venetian is from the Cosmopolitan, just imagine how long the strip is, then imagine walking about half of the strip, just for lunch, with one person in your party wearing a black dress and the other wearing a dress suit and pants. This is during summer, when the high reaches nearly 110 degrees during the day. Yes, my boyfriend loves me very much to be dealing with this sort of thing. We finally arrived and noticed the interesting decor, which was not traditional at all. We knew this was a fusion restaurant, but we were starting to worry that the food wouldn't be as good as advertised. Luckily, our worries were put to rest after receiving the appetizer we ordered, which were gyoza with kombucha paste filling. They were tangy, and if dipped into the sauce, salty. Very delightful...I would recommend to every customer. Next the manager came over and talked with us for a bit before recommending the sea bass skewers with Peruvian corn. We hesitated a bit, because we wanted sushi for lunch on account of our plans for a buffet at dinner, but he insisted that it was a plate that shouldn't be overlooked, so we got it. Soon after, he returned with complimentary ceviche tacos, as a gift for buying so much food (we also got a special roll each and a roll to share)! Quite a lot of food for a meal we wanted to be light. The tacos were decent, I'd say 3/5 stars. Interesting to try, but I wouldn't say I'd order them if I return. The skewers, however, were 5/5. The corn was huge and chewy, while the skewers were well-flavored and -cooked, and unbelievably tender. I am immensely grateful that the manager suggested these, as it was one of the most unique dishes I've ever had. I would recommend these to any customer, as well. I didn't try my boyfriend's roll, because I don't like shrimp in my sushi, but my roll was pretty good. I wanted their Samba roll, but settled for the Maine lobster roll. It may be difficult to believe, but I thought there was a little too much lobster on the roll (don't hurt me)! We split a basic salmon avocado roll, which was average.  It ended up being a lot of food in general, but a lot more than we expected to get.  If you love food, especially sushi, and you love trying new things, do not come here expecting a light meal. You will eat a lot and leave pleasantly full, but be unable to eat your next meal!",

Lol the host at the front wore big smiles and were very accommodating and asked if I was able to walk to the table or if I need to use the chair. I gladly hopped up with my crutches after we parked the chair behind the host stand! There was also no wait a table of 5.   Not sure if it was co side ted busy when we arrived but it felt like a busy night. Our server seemed to be a little over stretched in his section. He greeted us right after his wing man ask what kind of water we would like. It took a long while for our drinks (alcoholic, of course). When I say a long while, I thought maybe they were going to Peru to get the Pisco for my Pisco Sour (which I ended up sending back anyway because it was too tart and unexpected). This pretty much went on throughout the night. Our food however, came out in a timely fashion due to the cooks and food runners being fabulous. What's not so fabulous, is that for every question I asked three different runners, their answer was always, \"excellent question, let me get your server\". Although it was polite and I appreciate them not giving me a wrong answer, I wish the entire staff was also well informed about the bar.   Hm... The bar! I'm in the industry and I have a vast knowledge of spirits. I am baffled of their selection, or lack there of. I realize bit all bars will have some of what I request, but they should all keep up with the joneses and have in demand and popular spirits. I asked for three spirits that they did not have. Server also told me that they just recently put Titos Vodka on their shelf!!!! Huge list of sake but no Bulliet Burbon, or Rum Chatta.   Moving on...   Green Bean Tempura and Rock Shrimp- both delightful, we ordered a second helping  Miso Seabsss- served on a skewer (delicious, but wanted a bigger serving) with Peruvian corn  Shishito  pepper- sauteed yet bland, needs garlic or flavor  Yellowtail lemongrass sashimi- tasty with red pepper on top   We also had the belly of the yellowtail (sashimi) which is an absolute must try!!!!",

We went with a large group and they offer tasting menus - which would have been a good idea but we had a lot of different sushi favorites so we all ordered separately.   I started with a tuna tataki appetizer that may have been the best I've ever had. The tuna was perfectly seasoned and seared. My mouth started drooling thinking about it. I wanted 10 more pieces.   I then had a roll but I cannot for the life of me remember the name. It was slightly tempura but delicious. Great size as well.   I went for a bachelorette weekend and they gave us two free cocktail towers which was extremely nice.   Overall very great experience here. We stayed at the Venetian so the location also helped!",

The general culture is to let your server know of any dietary restrictions, favorite dishes, and price point per person, and let them decide your menu for you. They will then take the laboring Oar in ordering you different items on the menu that fit your budget and restrictions. Overall, having had probably almost everything on the menu, I would have to say that that Chilean sea bass skewers and Sushi are the best things they have.  Don't expect fresh, 5 star  fish though. They also have a big selection of cocktails or you can have sake if that's your thing. The restaurant itself is pretty big and can accommodate big groups easily. Perfect place for a Bachelor or Bachelorette party group that wants to get loud and Rowdy and not worry about ordering throughout the night by letting someone else do the thinking for them. They have also brought us free shots of some sort of alcohol to top off the night.",

The atmosphere is modern and elegant with blended influences from both Brazil and Japan which made the restaurant so original. The quality of the decorations and ambiance feels like high end Vegas, and the True delight of dining on the strip. I loved the rich colors, the textured art, including a projected video montage of Japanese and Brazilian history onto the wall behind me.   The food and drinks were delicious. And while the price ranges fairly high for a sushi place, it's Vegas and it's good Vegas. Exploding with flavor Vegas. The Seared Wagyu Beef was very delicious - loved the strong beef taste contrasted with the sweet jam and mushrooms! The seaweed appetizer was also fantastic and the perfect started size.   Great experience overall. Our waiter was very friendly, though he was a little slow to get back to us a couple times regarding drinks. But on a busy Saturday night, I could understand.

We got the rock shrimp (ive had better) miso soup (has cilantro instead of seaweed, not to my liking) the el topo roll: salmon with baked mozzarella (sounds weird and also tastes weird), sea bass skewers (so yummy, but came out cold and had too much sauce on it) tempura green beans (best thing we got) and steamed rice (for 7$ lol) I mentioned it was my friends birthday earlier, they decided not to bring anything out for her. Oh well.  Overall, ive had muchhhh better sushi at a way more affordable price.  Ambiance was cool, a bit dark and crowded.  I probably wont ever go back.",

I went early afternoon with my two youngish daughters to beat the dinner rush and let them enjoy a real high end dinning experience. It took 5 minutes after being seated to place our drink orders then I had questions about the menu and the drinks were dropped off and server did not come back for over 15 minuets. Once we ordered the food came out fairly quickly and it was very good but once again the server disappeared. I wanted to order more sushi but I was so angry that I just wanted the bill and get out of there. I give the food 10 stars but I give the service 0 stars.",

    "text": "This review is for the Samba Hour (aka Happy Hour, available only at the bar: Sunday-Friday: 4-7 pm & 11 pm til close).   Located inside the Palazzo Hotel, my husband and I came by here last Friday for the happy hour around 5:20 pm for a light meal before heading out for a night on the town. There were plenty of seats available at the bar and so we just sat ourselves. We were immediately greeted by a friendly bartender (unfortunately I do not remember his name) who took good care of us during our dining experience. We ended up ordering:  Classic Mojito, $6 prior to tax- I like mojitos because of that mint flavor. Unfortunately this mojito was missing sugar and had a bitter taste. I probably wouldn't order this again, but I finished this drink anyway (why would I waste perfectly good alcohol?).  Kirin, $5 prior to tax- I am not a beer lover, but my husband liked his drink.   Salt & Pepper Squid, $6 prior to tax- This salt and pepper squid had a nice salted flavor and the squid had a nice easy chew.   Wagyu Gyoza, (with kabocha puree & su- shoyo dipping sauce) $6 prior to tax- Our bartender recommended we try this because these dumplings are made of wagyu beef. The beef was tender and flavorful but unfortunately this little dish came with only 3. Loved the kabocha puree and wished I had more of it. It was really nice of a bit of savory sweetness to these small dumplings.   Spicy Tuna Roll, $6 prior to tax- Fresh tasting, really liked the sauce on top of each piece of spicy tuna.   Yellowtail Scallion roll, $11 prior to tax- So simple, yet very fresh tasting and absolutely delicious.   Amazonia, $6 prior to tax- This roll is very vegetarian (and vegan) friendly and rather unique. When I read the description (Swiss chard, portobello mushroom, takuwam, cucumber, avocado, wasabi- onion soy) I thought I would order it just to see how it would taste. And I am glad I did because it ended up being one of my favorites of what we ordered. Each roll is covered in Swiss chard, filled with all of the ingredients listed on the menu.  -------------------------- (Total=$46 prior to tax)  The bartender that was the main person who took care of our orders and such was quite friendly. He is from Hawaii and so we were talking with him the whole time about that. It has been a while since my husband and I have been to both Oahu and the Big Island and so it was nice to talk about the surf and the amazing restaurants there.   Somewhere in our conversation, he had asked what brought us here to Las Vegas and I told him that we were celebrating my birthday early. And so towards the end of meal, he made both of us a special complementary drink for my birthday. This drink was pretty strong and rather enjoyable. It had a nice light flavor of cucumber, ginger and lemon. This bartender did not have to go that extra mile to really start our evening just that extra special, but he did. And because of this bartender, I will make sure to come back to Sushi Samba again on our next visit to Las Vegas.",

    "text": "My friend and I really wanted to grab some decent food (aka not fast food) on our visit to Vegas. We decided on this place and my friend made the dinner reservation. When we arrived, it didn't look like reservations were really needed as there were a good amount of empty tables during Saturday dinner time.  My friend and I sat at the sushi bar. It was odd because whenever I've sat at the bar, the sushi chefs would make conversation or at least greet us. None of them did. My friend ordered a 15 piece omakase (about $52 if I remember correctly). She thought it was just okay, but definitely not worth the price tag. I ordered a miso soup and the Sao Paulo roll. Okay $6 for a miso soup? Really? I mean I understand it's Vegas, but it literally tasted like a normal miso soup. The Sao Paulo roll was recommended as one of their most popular rolls. The first thing I noticed when it came out was how minuscule the fish portion was. Some pieces didn't even have a full layer of fish across the top. I wish I would've taken a picture to display what it looked like. For $24, I just expected a bit more.   The service was so odd here. The hostess that was at the front when we checked in was not friendly. There were a few servers crowding around the end of the sushi bar where we sat. They were chatting it up amongst each other, which I thought made for a little unpleasant dining experience. Overall, I was pretty underwhelmed by this restaurant.",

Normally, I spend about $100 at Mizumi per person including tax and tip to get full which at the Wynn is about the standard price of a nice dinner meal.   I got more food that was still incredible quality for half the price. I left SushiSamba spending $55 with tax and tip per person to get more full on a larger variety of fish and amount. Another awesome thing about SushiSamba is the fusion they offer with their other dishes. Be sure to try the Wagyu Beef potstickers; they were very interesting and definitely worth trying. Additionally, make sure you order Toro!!!",

Seabass was more like butterfish misoyaki, so you're not gonna fail here, but please don't mislead me and call it \"anticucho\"! duck rice - $5    O_O seviche tuna  yellowtail - $30 for 5 pcs.... and not the greatest cut dessert was very gratifying, with the chocolate banana thing (sorry, it was a while ago) and pressed coffee and hot tea - quite excellent.  Whichever items didn't have any remarks meant that they were pretty good too. With exception to an extremely lackluster miso soup and the hamachi, the food wasn't terribly overpriced.   They do a montage of Japanese, Hispanic, Brazilian mix. Service was decent, nothing worth noting and far from elegant, personable, or excellent but whatever I guess? I was there to eat, not have my butt kissed. Will I come back to eat when I get into town? Perhaps. They have an extensive menu so worth trying some different things. Is it a must? No.",

The first two came out really early and we finished them with ease, the Seabass is world class (but only two pieces each). The Sushi and Sashimi platter was very good as well.   The best in my opinion since I'm a huge meat eater was the 5 meat combo platter, they came with sausage, pork, steak. My favorite was definitely the steak!   The price all together came out to $100 not including tip. Well worth it I'd say as the 5 meat combo really filled us up (3 guys).   I'll probably be back in the future.   PS there was so weird video of like 1970's footage playing in the background and thought I'd mention that.",

I was so bummed because we were on a really good streak of eating amazing food in Vegas too!   Straight to the point. The entire experience was not at all what we were expecting.  The ambiance is really nice however, it is pretty dim -and seemed more like a club/bar lounge than a restaurant. Honestly, I would go to a whole in the wall looking restaurant with delicious food than something that just \"looks\" nice.  As an avid sushi consumer, please believe me when I say the food here is a complete disappointment! Save your winnings and go elsewhere-- McDonald's is not too far away you know.   What we ordered:  I'm so mad right now I don't even remember the names of the food we ordered! But we had a group 10 people. And NO ONE liked their food. The portions seemed to have been aimed for people that are about the size of a 3 yr old with the price of a pasta entree at an Italian restaurant. I mean, really- almost $20 for two less than 4 inch skewers of meat? What the hell is that? No sides- nothing. Just that.  My sushi rolls were more bland than an infant's pureed cereal!  We were all in disbelief. So much that traded of our sushi rolls with one another to see if it might have been what we ordered that wasn't tasty.   Customer service: The waiter was set on how we should order when she came to our table.  She heavily \"suggested\" that we order food as a \"family style\" in which every rolls, tempura, skewers and all are placed in the middle of the table and you grab what you eat kinda thing. Considering not everyone eats the same portion or even like the same things -how the hell are you going to split the bill fairly? We decided not to order that way and asked if she could place everyone's items on separate plates. Which didn't end up happening. They squeeze 4 rolls onto one plate which  (1.) Looked messy  (2.) We couldn't distinguish which roll belonged to who  (3.) The flavors and sauce of each roll started to mix together.    We didn't even finish our food... we left hungry and went to Chipotle instead.  Save yourself money & time and go elsewhere!",

You must try the amberjack tiradito and I urge to to get the sea bass anticucho.. Literally melted in out mouth, simply outstanding. We also had the shishito peppers and the Lima roll, both excellent. Dessert was chocolate banana cake... Just when we thought things could not get better, they did.

    "text": "Tried Sushi Samba based on a Yelp review.  Tried a few of their specialty cocktails and found them very original and tasty.  Prices were approx $12-$15/ea which is typical for Vegas.  They offered over 150 different Sake's.  They had everything from small plates to full larger meals.  The Miso sea bass melts in your mouth and was one of my favorite dishes.  You could try it two different ways.  As a small plate (6 pieces skewed on bamboo served over Peruvian rice(really good!) )$18  or or as a full meal $39.  Had a few other things like a few specialty sushi rolls, Wagu gyoza (2nd favorite) , and the Rock Shrimp.(least favorite) they we're still very good but we're pretty basic.  The Peruvian ganache desert was also very good.  The Decour of the restaurant was very nice, the only thing that kind of bothered me was the view of the mall it was located in.  Overall I was happy with this restaurant and would eat there again.",

    "text": "AMAZING! Came here at 8:30 on a Wednesday night for my birthday dinner in Vegas. I wish I remembered our serves name but he was excellent. Super informative on the menu. I ordered a dirty martini and my friend their cucumber cocktail. My martini was perfect but my friends cucumber cocktail was delicious!! Due to going out after dinner that night I didn't want to stuff myself so I ordered only the Yamato roll and an order of salmon sashimi. I was between the El Topo roll and the Yamato, my server suggested the Yamato even though their El Topo is a trademarked roll that has a great following. The Yamato roll consists of tuna, foie gras, caviar and gold leaf...it was DELICIOUS. Best sushi roll I've ever had and further more one of the best things I've had to eat. My friend had another roll I can't recall the name of (consisted of crab and shrimp) but she loved hers as well..and that is coming from someone who's only had a veggie sushi roll one other time and was very skeptical ordering it. For dessert they brought me out a mango ice cream cake pop looking dessert with a candle lit up, on the house!!! So nice of them to do that for my birthday. The manager came over to us and every table to check to see how everything was. Without a doubt I will be back here for the great service, AMAZING food and perfect atmosphere of trendy but not stuffy. Thanks for making my birthday dinner great Sushisamba!!!",

Anyways... our server was quite knowledgeable with the food menu and the drink menu (which was quite extensive) . He was trying to get us to spend $60/person but we were not that hungry to eat a four course meal. The sushi rolls were good but not spectacular, but the mushroom dish was to die for. I don't know what the sauce was but THAT was pretty damn awesome. Overall, it's fun for a group of ppl who can afford the $200 bill at the end of a small meal.",

    "text": "more of a 3.5...  although i love trendy, high ceiling restaurants that give you a modern feel..sushi samba's decor is a little too cluttered for me. maybe its because of the fact that its a twist between brazilian, japanese, and peruvian cuisine...where they feel like they need to include all three of the cultures art.. but whatever the case may be, theres just.. too much orange swirls, too many funky paintings, and too many weird faces on their walls. i like more of the simple trends. they play trendy music..which is a plus...but they crank it up as if you're in a club which in turn makes everyone talk louder than usual. it's almost as if you're in a convention.   some of the items that i've tried and have a vivid memory of:  -yellowtail sashimi tiradito. tasted like...yellowtail in salsa. it was good..but it was different. i usually like my sashimis in ponzu sauce.  -mushroom toban-yaki is reallllly good. it comes out in a hot sizzling clay pot with like four of five different kinds of mushrooms.   -spicy tuna taquito  -robata:  filet mignon lamb chop cherry tomatoes shiitake mushrooms  oysters, uni sashimi.   overall, its not too bad. i like the convenience. the two times i've been here was because i stayed at the palazzo.

    "text": "Sushi Samba was a fun but hectic experience, and the food was good.  It was very crowded on a Friday night, to be expected.  We called ahead but when we got there they said it would still be a very long wait so we decided to sit at the sushi bar.  The waiter was very nice and helpful with recommendations when we asked, but he was just swamped.  We ordered several small plates and they all came right in a row so that we didn't have much space and felt rushed to eat.  Our drinks (which we ordered first) didn't arrive until we were almost finished with our meal.  The mint julep was one of the worst I've ever had, but the other drink we got was fine so maybe that was just a one time thing on the mint julep.  Also our order got a little mixed up, we ordered two sushi items and when they brought it out one was correct and one was wrong.  But it looked good and the place was kind of hectic as I said, so we decided to keep it.  Now to the food: some dishes are really delicious.  I would recommend the Kobe beef carpaccio with mushrooms, it was a really nice combination of flavors.  And the duck skewers were cooked perfectly and came with a sauce underneath that was yummy but didn't overwhelm the duck.  The sushi items were fine but not special.  The edamame was really good, but that's hard to screw up so I can't really give them points for that.    The decor was exciting and fun, plus points for that.",

We were waiting for a few friends to arrive and decided to wait at the bar and I must say the strawberry mojito's are to die for!  It was so light and refreshing. Best mojito I have ever had!  Because we were visiting from out of town we just wanted to dive in and experience what Sushi Samba had to offer.  We told our waiter we would eat whatever the chef wanted to prepare.  We had the beef and sea bass anticuchos.  The beef was tender and succulent.  The sea bass was moist and flaky.  It was served on small wooden sticks and the right portion size so it made it very easy to eat.  We also had seared scallops on cold somen noodles along with seared scallop tobanyaki cooked in a clay pot with with crispy spinach.  The scallops were very big in size and cooked to perfection!  The clay pot dish was savory and hearty all in one, definitely a must order!  To top off the experience Chef Rob Juan came out and greeted us and told us a little bit about each dish that we had.  Overall great service and amazing food!  I will be visiting this restaurant again the next time I'm back in Las Vegas.",

I am totally hooked on the black truffle aioli that comes with the green bean tempura. The calamari is interesting but good! The sushi rolls are of course, good.

We came around 6pm on a Saturday and were seated right away.  For 4 people we got the seared kobe beef (demolished immediately...entire plate was cleared within like 10 seconds) and seaweed salad small plates, filet mignon with green pea puree and wasabi froth, and the BoBo Brazil, Neo Tokyo, and Capoeira(?) rolls.  Everything was delicious, the Neo Tokyo (yellowfin tuna, tempura flake, aji panca) was probably my favorite of everything we had, and my Lemon Samurai cocktail went down like juice.",

My family had the three meats (grilled hanger steak, ribeye and pork tenderloin) and the miso-marinated Chilean sea bass. The meats were flavorful. We enjoyed the ribeye and pork tenderloin the best of the three meats. The sea bass was good, but it was not worth $29 for a tiny piece of fillet fish. We thought it was going to be a whole fish, enough to serve more than one person. The service was good when our waiter took our order, but he never came back to check up on our table to see how we were doing. We had to order extra rice and miso soup from other waiters and staff. Our waiter finally came to our table just to drop off the check. The manager came around and asked about our food, and we told him about the issue with our waiter. He apologized and offered us bite-sized cookies. The food was good, but the service was okay.",

I HIGHLT recommend the Toro Roll and make sure you ask for extra green salsa to dip it in!",

Unbelieveable.  That was the most delicious thing I had ever had!  Mostly, my beef with this place is the location, in a mall, and the ambience of the place.  The ironic part is that when you are dining at the Chicago or Miami locations, it feels like you are in Vegas: swanky, cool, fun.  But dining in the Vegas one feels like you are at a Legal Seafoods in suburbia.  Just misses something.  If you're in Vegas, go someplace else.",

It comes with a Peruvian corn which is interesting. The rolls are not typical japanese rolls because of the blend of Brazilian and Peruvian cuisine. The last time we were here, we had the seafood paella which was surprisingly pretty good. The civiche's were ok also. Good food but a little pricey, and trendy ambiance.",

I coulda eaten 5 ears' worth.... dessert was the banana chocolate amazingness (not the real name :-P).  the sea bass and the dessert were recommended by our server. and he was spot-on. so good.  we left feeling amazingly sated yet not overly stuffed.  the drinks were pretty good too.  will go again, for sure.",

Water is always full  Cons: - the ramen is good, but you could get better for cheaper  - el topo roll is weird. There is melted mozzarella, so if you're okay with that, it might be good. The tastes didn't mix well for me - can get pricey because it is tapas style",

I asked him if he'd be down to go back for dinner, \"No Doubt!\". We went and the girls at the front of the restaurant were beautiful, bubbly and sincerely sweet. They helped get us seated right away at the bar. The head Chef named Herb came out personally to greet us since it was my buddies second time there in a day. Chef Herb talked with us for a few minutes and then sent us some complimentary dishes to show his appreciation for our appreciation of our food. That is how to build loyalty in a business. Make sure to make your customers feel welcomed and appreciated for the business they bring you.   The food was amazing and I have been to top restaurants such as Nobu, Naoe, and Zuma and for the price difference between the two I would pick sushisamba hands down. The ambiance and decor was awesome. Our server was a Japanese girl who was on her game taking care of many tables at once and still took time to chat with us. Highly recommend this spot!",

I would most definitely recommend the samba part of Sushisamba. We started off the night tapas style with some yellowtail taquitos, tuna seviche, and sea bass. Each one was amazing, but the taquitos were off the charts amazing. Flavorful and spicy!   For rolls, we ordered the specials, one with strips of kobe beef on top which was awesome.   Definitely recommend!",

We originally went on Friday evening at 6 and it was extremely noisy and there were no open tables other than the bar so we decided to make a reservation for Saturday at 5 instead which was a much better choice. We told our server Nick it was our first time for sushi so he explained to us that we had 2 options, we could order off the menu with his assistance or we could give him our price range (we did $60 pp) and the chef could create our menu for the evening so we decided to venture out and let chef create for us. He did not disappoint!!! We had a 3 course meal (each course with 2 or 3 different items) The first course was beef wellington wrapped in won tons with cheese and some kind of tuna on a bed of spinach leaf with white asparagus root and sauce on top.. The second course  was 3 meats on skewers grilled chicken, grilled salmon and rib eye. The 3 rd course was a Philadelphia roll and salmon sushi.. Everything we had was delicious!!! I am so happy I finally came around and tried sushi I am now hooked!! It was our 25th anniversary so at the end of our meal they brought over a special dessert dipped in chocolate with the words Happy anniversary written out in chocolate. I also ordered a drink called Samba Juice with raspberry rum it was amazing!!! The atmosphere is very relaxing and elegant. Our server Nick was extremely friendly and very attentive to our table . We very much enjoyed our evening there. By the time we left around 6:30 it had started to get full in the restaurant and noise level increased so we went at perfect time :)  We will definitely be returning on our next visit to Vegas!!",

Asked for recommendation, and she was clueless. plus she pronounced \"saki,\" which drove me nuts. if u work in a sushi place, at least learn something about the culture. check the price before you order anything. miso soup was $6 with only a few chunks of tofu. that's it! no seaweed, shiitake. rip off. all in all, if u r paying for vegas atmosphere, not food, then this would be an option.",

We actually went there first for a low-key place to get a couple of drinks...our bartender, Lisa, was awesome.  A friendly smile to accompany our shots and she was always ready to take care of us when we needed her.  Even the manager, Brian, came over and greeted us and made us feel welcome.  Considering the great time we had that night, we were excited to come back the next day for some sushi...we were not disappointed.  I see other people yelping about price, but you know what I thought it was worth it.  Their standard rolls were pretty good, but I would highly recommend their speciality rolls.  My friends and I couldn't stop trading pieces...everything we tried was amazing.  NeoTokyo was personally my favorite, but the BoBo Brazil roll ranks up there as well...the fusion is very creative, flavorful, and was a very welcome surprise.  I'm from the East coast and am excited to go to the ones in New York City, and the next time I'm out in Vegas it will definitely be one of my first stops.",

    "text": "The stars are for food quality and lush atmosphere, but that's generous.  The portions are small and, like everything else in Vegas, at least three times the price you'd pay back home.   The waitress was a nightmare.  I've met used car salesmen who are less pushy.  She raved about the chef's special menu, which was $50 per person.  When we blanched at the price, she hinted that *maybe* she could \"work with us\" on a \"tasting\" menu at $30 per person.  For $30 I want more than a frickin \"taste\", I was an awesome meal that will fill me up.  We had to ask her three times, point-blank, if we could see a menu and order just from the menu.  She grudgingly brought ONE menu for the two vegetarians (of a bachelorette party of 12).  I had to ask the busboy for menus for the rest of us.   When we ordered from the menu, she gave us a dire warning that the food came from 3 different kitchens and wouldn't arrive all at the same time.  She gave one last push for the tasting menu.  I would have walked out and complained to the manager if I hadn't been in a large party.   I ended up paying $15 for edamame and rice.  It tasted good, and all the other dishes looked great - but definitely not worth the hassle and abuse.  SushiSamba seriously needs to retrain their staff.  Focus on improving the customer's experience, not on cramming your own agenda down their throats. UPDATE:  The General Manager contacted me to apologize, and has promised to discipline/retrain the servers who have been the cause of the numerous bad reviews on Yelp.  Even with improved service, I still wouldn't recommend this restaurant to anyone seeking to fill their bellies or get good value for their money.  If you're all about atmosphere and haute cuisine, then samba on down.",

    "text": "Came here on the reccomendation with Chef Micheal Cressoti and I was impressed. It's located at the top floor of the palazzo with a hip and dark ambiance. Okay people it's dark crowded and loud. Do you forget where you are?!? It's las vegas people!! This is what you should expect. This is the new era where sushi is supposed to be hip. I took my girfriend and a third wheel there for a dinner and pretty much ordered the omakase. As a person who worked around in sushi restaraunts, lived in Peru, and surrounded by Brazileros, I still was taught I had alot more to learn about the cuisine and the complex flavors on the palate when mixed together. Honestly unless you're ordering the kobe beef roll or the fuie gras sushi... skip the whole sushi list. The rolls are great but for the price, I would opt out for the kitchen orders. Spicy tuna was a little different but nothing to make you stand up and dance. The red miso sea bass (I believe that was the fish) skewers are to die for. The grill is special grill where they use woodchips brought in from Japan. This is the kind of special treatment the chefs use to creats such dishes, so the price is reasonable. All their fish is line caught so for the environmentally conscience, expect to pay more for sushi as opposed to other sushi restaraunts. Their ceviche was very light and refreshing, so was the yellowtail sashimi and the ceviche. The kobe beef tacos. Sorry Kogi was okay for me. Asian tacos are as good as it gets, but kobe beef tacos who can possibly resist. It was spectacular with the spicy emulsion that was served on the side. The duck confit with wil mushroom is a must order. Succulent morsels of variety of mushrooms and the perfectly cooked medium rare breast of duck just melted in your mouth. The sake sommelier was very friendly and knew her alcohol, so if you are interested in ordering sake ask for the pro. From here and there, after 5 other dishes, we ended up with dessert. The chocolate cake, which they said was great, was rather just good, BUT the carrot cake. I HATE carrot cake, but the pastry chef, she whippped up something so magical and delicious. Not too sweet, not too heavy, not too bready... if you can understand what I mean, you will love this cake. In a cake, I look for the perfect balance of sweetness and richness, that will just top off your great meal. Not to overwhelm your palate and your stomach but make a nice closure to the expensive meal you just enjoyed. It was the best carrot cake I've had. Overall the staff was friendly and the general manager was kind enough to explain to me about the food and the kitchen, since I work in the kitchen as well. I left there extremely happy and with an impressed gf and third wheel. Thank you sushi samba.",

They must train or only select top quality people to work here.  The genuine smile of the hostess while seating us put us at ease.  The response to our cries of hunger were quickly met with concern and efficiency by our wonderful waitress.  Most of our orders came within like two minutes of ordering them.  I am talking whole sushi rolls that were perfectly made... amazing!!   You do pay for it but I found the quality of everything from the service to the food to be of very high quality.

I generally sit at the bar when I am here and have gotten amazing service from Luna, but the other bartenders have given me terrible service.  My last experience was about three weeks ago and the bartender rang in the wrong sushi, then rang in the wrong dessert later.  I had to wait a looooong time for the dessert item to be rectified and I was actually in a hurry to leave at this point.  On top of that she messed my bill up THREE TIMES.  I tipped twenty-percent since I'm in that industry but if I had been a tourist I'd probably have given her less.  I work close to Sushi Samba so it is convenient to go there but I doubt I will ever go back unless Luna is working the bar.  One other note is I saw one bartender really working hard while the other bartenders played around and did nothing.  If I was working there I'd be annoyed.  Actually as a guest I was annoyed since I got such awful service.  *after writing this review someone from Sushi Samba reached out to ask me more about my experience which was nice.*",

We came here because I had a taste for sushi and it was the highest ranked by Yelpers.  When we arrived, the bar atmosphere caused us to question the Yelp reviews but after eating we agree.  The sushi rolls aren't that great (we tried the Samba Strip and El Topt) but they weren't horrible.  The servers are familiar with the entire menu so if you don't have a specific taste for something, feel free to ask them for their suggestion. They'll have a ton.  Also, their drinks are good but lean away from being sweet.  I had to have them muddle more sugar and mint to flavor up my drink a little more because it just tasted like rum with a little mint when they first brought it out.  This is a tapas place so you can easily order 4 plates per person which can get pricey.  But highly recommend for their Chilean sea bass skewers.  I haven't had sea bass this good since G.

It was somewhat crowded when we got there on Valentine's Day weekend although I should say I have never seen Vegas this empty compared to previous years during such holidays.  My first impression of the restaurant wasnt as expected, the tables were somewhat worn out and chipped at on the surface, and due to the place being crowded the tables and chairs were very close to the neighboring tables, it felt like the people who were setted next to us were actually sitting with us.  So that was kinda annoying.  Ok enough of negative :) now the positives.  Our waiter was excellent.  I wanted to eat sushi but i was thinking of trying different things on the menu, therefore our serves suggested that we order this special that they have.  He asked us how much we wanted to spend and according to our budget he would bring different dishes so we could basically taste their whole menu and have variety of foods.  Our waiter stated that if we dont like any of the food that is being served he would be happy to replace it with something else.  I was ready to spend around 70 a person so he started off according to my budget.  We had different variety of sashimi, cut rolls peruvian dishes with mushrooms and duck, crab legs etc.  He served us with 7 different dishes and we basically told him to skip the desert since we were very full at that point.  The verdict----good food, excellent service.",

I like sushi, sashimi, sushi rolls, etc. I didnt really vibe with the brazilian twist the menu had. I did not research the menu enough before going in there. (Which was good in retrospect, because then I probably wouldnt have gone there, and missed a great meal.) I assumed- sushi samba= sushi. Lol. We ordered regular sushi rolls, sashimi pieces and miso soups. The miso was great. The grade of the sushi was out of this world. Def some of the best I have had, and I am a sushi addict. I have eaten it all over at home, and I try to get it whenever I am on vacation. Def recommend. There are high prices for the specialty fusion foods (which made me nervous and therefore I stuck with what I knew), but the place is gorgeous, service was fantastic, and if you are willing to take a chance on the specialty foods, Im sure you wont be disappointed.",

Half way through the wagyu we were pretty full. Seabass is by far the best ever had, also perfectly seared on the skin to give crispy yet chewy texture and extremely tender inside. Sushi orders and oysters were extremely fresh! We also added wagyu gyoza which was perfectly balanced with the squash puree dressing. Soooo good.   We ordered a couple cocktails and a bottle of sake.

Seaweed Appetizer:  To my surprise when this appetizer was delivered to our table there were three different types. I still think that green jelly looking one taste the best.   2. Huancaina Fries:  This side dish was super tasty. The fries were actually baby potatoes dressed with a cream sauce and cheese. It was Mmm Mmm GOOD!.  3. Samba Strip roll:  My friends and I initially chose this roll because we saw that there was lobster in it. With the roll also came a curry dipping sauce. Personally, I liked the roll by itself because the curry  sauce tasted kind of tart/ sour.   4. Rainbow Dragon roll:  The usual dragon roll, nothing special.  5. Carnaval:  This was my favorite of all the rolls. The contents of the rolls included: shrimp, avocado, yellowtail. A simple but tasty roll overall.   Service:  The waiter came by pretty frequently to refill our waters and ask if we needed anything.   Final Verdict:  The fish/ lobster was extremely fresh, but I don't know if I can get over the $$$ prices. Definitely a great Las Vegas dining experience though.",

The nigiris and rolls were really great so I suggest you try atleast one of the rolls(all of them are unique and good) and order lots of the nigiris if you're not doing omikase! It is a fusion with Brazilian Japanese and Peruvian so they do have some dishes such as Peruvian corn, etc different stuff that they make for presentation and taste! The only reason why I gave this 4 instead of 5 stars was because some of their \"best\" wasn't to die for or anything. And the truffle oil is an acquired taste and I absolutely disliked it (it leaves such a smelly after taste in your mouth) so you can always tell them not to put that!  A great thing though is that if you don't like something you can let them know and they'll make you something else in replacement of the course that you didn't like.  Overall, I think this place was pretty good but not like WOAH. I've tasted some rolls at all you can eat sushi here in Vegas that blew me away versus the stuff here. They were DIFFERENT, but somewhat overrated. Worth the try though and I would come back!",

Great presentation, great service and frankly for the price vs other over priced strip dining you can't beat this one.   The ambience is loud, colorful and very close Seating.

    "text": "Sushi Samba, located on the 2nd floor of the Palazzo, was one of the best meals I had in Vegas. I wasn't sure what to expect, but it definitely exceeded my expectations. We got reservations on a Friday night for 6 of us and were seated promptly.  Service was great - they answered all our questions and were very understanding when 2 of us had to get out of there faster to catch a show.   We started with sake and also got a few cocktails. I got the cucumber cocktail which was delicious and not too sweet. My friend and I opted to order some small plates to split, while the rest of our group participated in a tasting menu where they gave the server the price they each wanted to spend and they had the chef make them a surprise menu-- so cool!   We ended up with: - rock shrimp tempura: amazing and huge portion - seared wagyu beef: thin tender pieces of meat with a delicious sauce and TRUFFLE - broiled peruvian bay scallops: the sauce on these were incredible- disappointed that there were only 3, because I could have eaten like 5 myself - crispy jidori egg: kind of strange but good flavor. almost like a bird's nest appearance. I wasn't sure what I was eating but it tasted pretty good. - coconut rice side: nice flavor, nothing special  They forgot our purple mashed potatoes but we were pretty full so we didn't really care. Our group, as part of the tasting menu, got the wagyu on a hot stone that looked and smelled incredible!  It was a little pricey for just small plates, but hey, it's vegas and the food was excellent overall. Definitely would come back next time I'm there!",

    "text": "This place is amazing, and what a pleasure to dine here! The food really gets your tastebuds going and everything comes out so fresh and beautifully plated. And best of all, you will come out actually feeling full and that your money was well spent. The service is also superb (more on that later).  I came here for my friend's bachelorette party over Labor Day weekend. She's Japanese, loves sushi, and has had plenty of it, and she thoroughly enjoyed this meal. We were staying at the Venetian so this place fit the bill, but it's worth coming over to check it out even if you're not at the Venetian.   After we browsed the extensive menu, the waiter recommended that we do a tasting menu, an easy option considering it was all of our first time here and we would get to try all of their most popular dishes, in a very balanced way -- so, appetizers, raw dishes, meats, etc. He said that he'd calculate it so that it would end up being about $50 per person. He also asked if anyone has dietary restrictions, which two ppl in our party of 7 did. Very considerate, accommodating and reasonable.  We started off with tempura string beans with truffle dip...wow that dip is a standout amongst all the dips I've had over the course of my life so far...haha. Not too heavy and very satisfying. I could smell the lovely whiffs of it before even dipping the tempura. The bachelorette who doesn't even normally like truffle really enjoyed this. It went so well with the tempura, which could not have been fried to more perfection. It wasn't oily or mushy or overly flaky. Light and crispy.  From there, we had dish after dish (tapas/sharing style) that were just sometimes mindblowlingly good. The sea bass skewers is their most popular dish and yes, they're even better than I imagined. Perfectly seasoned and melt in your mouth texture. Just make sure you have space in your tummy for them because they were toward the latter end of our tasting menu, and by then, a couple of people were already really full!!  Even the two people who had modifications had dishes that looked and tasted just as great. One of them had a large dish of seafood coconut curry. Wow, filled with large mussels and clams and jumbo shrimp and squid. Superb.   The end of the tasting menu was an entire large plate of sushi rolls. Some of them might look like your usual rolls, but try them and you'll immediately get that these are not your usual rolls when it comes to the taste and quality. So, so fresh. I really didn't think it would so immediately hit me how fresh the fish were, but wow it sure did! It makes such a difference, and this is beyond your usual fresh sushi at a nice Japanese restaurant. Sometimes I feel a bit squeamish after -- or even while -- eating raw fish, but not here. Even a simple salmon avocado roll, which I really did not expect much from (and was my last choice on the plate) was surprisingly so good -- that salmon really comes through. It's also notable that they don't put too much rice on the rolls, it makes such a difference. Again though, try to pace yourself through the meal or leave plenty of space beforehand, because we ended up having like, five pieces of rolls left on the table...which was really sad!!  Each of us also got a small complimentary lychee cocktail because of the special occasion. They came out on a gorgeous tree rack of sorts. Really lovely. I saw on Yelp that another bachelorette party had gotten complimentary ice cream mochi, but I'm thinking we got the drinks because the majority of us didn't order alcohol. Either way, a thoughtful gesture that was appreciated amongst the table.  I'll note that there were just a couple of moments of confusion about what our table was getting for the tasting menu, particularly when other servers (not our waiter) came over with dishes, but this was thankfully sorted out when he reappeared in time. We did end up with a bowl of edamame which was not part of the menu, but which he let us keep haha  The crowd is a mix of people, from large groups of friends to family gathering to bachelorette parties. The large party behind us was very rowdy, like heavy pounding on the table and shouting, and security had to eventually come over. The service staff handled the situation well, and it was impressive to see.  This meal was one of the highlights of my trip, and one of the best meals I've ever had. The fact that it averaged out to just under $50/person (not counting drinks) was pretty unbelievable!",

So much so that it spilled to our seats. Mind you, it was early and the place was 20% filled at the time. I hate that I even had to ask to be moved somewhere more comfortable.

Our waiter suggested the full course, similar to Nobu or other similar restaurants, however we opted for single menu items.  I ordered the Sea Bass and the Peruvian Corn.  Words and photos cannot describe how awesome the sea bass was-definitely top 5 contender.    Critiques: Service was good, not great and felt a bit rushed  through each course.   Also, seating is extremely cramped, which makes for a smokey facial when they bring out your neighbors Wagyu on the rocks  and the place is loud- difficult place for a romantic conversation.  Tips: You need a reservation or you will probably sit in the overflow area outside the restaurant.   -Go for the full course offering if you are hungry and have the coin.  -Try the Sea Bass I'm telling you!",

We ordered the crispy taquitos and two orders of the 9 piece sashimi. The crispy taquitos were suggested by the couple at the table next to us and it was a great choice because it had so many different textures and depths of flavor. It reminded me of the hamachi shot appetizer from Alexander's Steakhouse but in a crispy taco shell. The sashimi was just ordinary, having only selections of tuna, salmon, and hamachi. The salmon was my favorite since it was very sweet, but overall for the price, the sashimi wasn't very amazing.",

She asked us simple questions and ordered items based off of that keeping in mind a budget we provided to her. Overall, I would give her an 8 out of 10 for her effort.  It's been weeks since I've been so sometimes, that really helps me remember what was memorable if I mention it in my review. The uni was super fresh here! There was also a mushroom dish that came with a poached egg on top, that was also to die for. I also really enjoyed the sea bass yakitori, this dissolved in your mouth like cotton candy! The sushi rolls that came out wasn't anything special, but knowing that, I'll probably stick to some of their more inventive dishes. The dessert was some kind of banana flavored one- can't remember how to describe it, but it was a winner in my book.  Overall- it isn't too bad of a spot to check out at least once if you want to try something new. The likelihood of me returning is not that high but based on that one experience alone (along with the service), it was a solid 4 stars!",

Even had some laughs with neighboring guests that lost an oyster.   We ordered two sushi rolls, two appetizers but a double order of the squid because of that incredible smoked soy sauce. If they would bottle that, I would order it online like I do some hot sauce from Nashville.   They had Japanese whiskey that I was craving. Bottle service for clubs and outings is cheapest with vodka. I missed my whiskey! I believe I had a $25 shot while my friend had a $39 shot. Oops. Should've asked. It was a unique, almost coffee-like whiskey, something similar to SF's Seven Stills.  Service was incredibly friendly and you could tell they work well as a team. If I had time to go there again before I took off, I would. Open one in the Bay Area!",

Found this on Yelp and were really hesitant cause of a Japanese, Brazilian and Peruvian cuisine all mixed into one.  This place had very loud music playing in the background and couldn't hear each other talk. Service wasn't that great as we mostly sat around waiting for someone to take our order, fill our drinks, and check up on us, and bring the check.  Food was just so-so, I like my Japanese food to be delicate and have a perfect balance and only using the most minimal and basic ingredients. When I started tasting weird flavors that didn't go well together in my assortment of food, it ruined what I come to love about Japanese food.  Not sure I would like to come back, as I didn't like the combination of flavors, the loud music, and the bad service.",

Japanese, Brazilian, and Peruvian dishes? And they all work together? The answer is yes, indeed they do.  If you're lucky enough to get Jimmy as your server, do follow his recommendations. His were spot on, plus he took excellent care of our table all evening. Jimmy suggested we give him a price point per diner, and then he delivered a sumptuous multi-course meal, taking us on a culinary trip to all three countries in under two hours. Oh, and did I mention I have a food allergy? Sushisamba didn't even blink. After my Celiac diagnosis three years ago, I thought I had to give up \"chef's choice\" or prix fixe meals. Not here. While most of our courses were GF, when they weren't the kitchen prepared GF versions especially for me, and I didn't have to agonize over my choices or worry about my safety. Sushisamba took care of everything.  And what dishes they were! Start off with a caipirinha, the signature drink of Brazil, and then let your server delight your senses. A few of the highlights: the tuna tataki; yellowtail taquitos; miso-marinated sea bass; and the moqueca mista. The moqueca mista was the crowd-pleaser of the evening, a beautiful seafood dish with the tastiest chimichurri rice I've ever had. But the star of the evening was the sushi. Served as the final courses, we had two huge platters - one GF, one not - and wow, did they deliver. Hope to make it back here for another fine meal. Viva Las Vegas!",

We walked into Palazzo and look on thedirectory if they had a sushi restaurant. We found Sushi Samba.  We walked over and our waiting time for a table was about 45 minutes long. We didn't feel like waiting since we were hungry, so we sat at the bar. Our waiter was very nice and outgoing. He made our drinks very good and strong! (you get your money's worth)  The restaurant/bar is very clean,dimmed lighting, DJ played good music.  We had miso soup to start off with and ordered 5 different rolls. (with a side of rice bowls)  I must say the food was amazing! Very  fresh and delicious..I would definitely come back again.",

This time we had a vegetarian friend with us but left ourselves in Tanice's capable hands and she put together a super delicious meal we could share that had plenty of veggie and meat options.  We left completely stuffed but happy.  The seabass is still my favorite dish but I've never had anything there that I didn't love!  We will be back, thank you!",

    "text": "Im sorry sushi samba but for a vegas restaurant you suck. The place was just a bit too dark for my tastes. Sushi is so bright and beautiful I cant understand why you would want to make it hide.  The food was good but for the price? Bleh. Seriously I have had better sushi for less than half its price many times. The presentation was pretty good and the fish quality was top notch. The recipes where fantastic...in theory.  I think what really got me down was the sauces. Their sauces where so weak and useless. I mean lump a bunch of fish into a roll and its just a lump of fish. Throw Mikuni's triple dream sauces on it and its a masterpiece!   I kind of want to go back to try something other than their maki.",

    "text": "This restaurant caught my eye because it was something out of the ordinary from your typical sushi restaurant. The menu offered an intriguing variety but when I began reading the reviews I knew I had to try it. I would suggest anyone going there for the first time to try the dining experience because you may think you know what you want but the chef knows better! The server asks if there is anything you do not like or if you have any food allergies and then how much money per person you're looking to spend. There are options anywhere from $50 per person to $130 per person if Kobe Beef if something that interests you. As it was for a special occasion we opted for $80 per person and even though thats more than I have probably ever spent on a single meal there were no regrets.  Course #1 consisted of Berkshire Pork Gyoza which is basically pork dumplings in a pumpkin puree and Yellowtail Ceviche Taquitos, both of which were absolutely delicious and not necessarily something I would have ordered on my own.  Course #2 was Yellowtail Sashimi in a spicy Peruvian sauce with a slice of red jalapeno on top and Octopus Sashimi in a Japanese citrus sauce which again were both to DIE for!  Course #3 had an array of filet mignon, sea bass, king crab and Peruvian corn. All were moist and tender but the sea bass absolutely melted in your mouth! Peruvian corn was a yummy alternative to traditional corn as well.  Finally, Course #4 was the main sushi dinner. Shrimp tempura rolls were delicious, but the spicy tuna with i believe tuna on top was absolutely amazing! There was also Maine lobster and another roll which I believe had lobster in it as well and was probably the only thing of the entire dinner that I was not absolutely amazed with, but it was still good!  Another great thing about this place is they tell you if there is anything throughout this meal you do not like they will take it back and bring you something else! As our server said, \"Its like a money back guarantee!\"  Anyways this is definitely a place I would tell everyone who loves trying new things to try or even just the sushi lover. DO IT! It will not disappoint!  Only part I would complain about is the fact that there is NOT one in California!!!",

    "text": "Every year I go to Miami for Winter Music Conference I have been lured to go eat at Sushi Samba over on Lincoln but I have never had the chance to eat there. Not sure why. Maybe it always seemed to packed and I didn't want to wait. I know now that I missed out on some damn good meals.  Right before Thanksgiving my wife and my father in law traveled over to Las Vegas for a few nights. As we walked into the Venetian Hotel I saw a billboard for Sushi Samba at the adjoining hotel, The Palazzo and I knew then where we were going for dinner. We went up to our room, freshened up and headed out.  We were quickly seated (it was a Sunday Night and the place was half full) and placed some drink orders. My wife had one of the specialty drinks which was quite good and I had some Nigiri Sake. We started off with the Otsumami appetizer which came with Edamame, Shishito Peppers and Green Bean Tempura with Black Truffle Aioli. All 3 were excellent but we found ourselves fighting over the Green Beans and that yummy Aioli.   Next up was a mixture of Ceviches and Tiraditos. We tried 4 all together with both Salmon and Yellowtail. Amazing flavor. The Yellowtail Ceviche Taquitos were also amazing. I could eat those all day. We also had a couple of things from the Robata grill. The stand out was the Miso Glazed Sea Bass. It was incredible. So tasty. It was the best Sea Bass I have ever had. Period! The Peruvian corn that came with it also was quite tasty.  The waitress recommended the Mushroom Toban-Yaki with some grilled duck from the Robata grill. It was so intense and earthy. I definitely got use of those umami tastebuds with this dish. Loved every bit. After all that, we saved room for 2 speciality sushi rolls, The Samba Strip Roll and the Neo Tokyo Roll. Both were amazing and filled with different flavors.   All in all one of the best meais I have had in a while and I have had some amazing meals recently. If in Vegas, you owe yourself. DO IT.",

    "text": "The food was of pretty decent quality and I liked the marrying of different kinds of styles; I really think that their fusion dishes are better than their traditional dishes. We also really liked the drinks.    The service was pretty awkward; we apparently came in during a shift change and it wasn't handled very well.    My biggest gripe is the sashimi served in incredibly tiny cuts at one piece per oder. It was the least impressive thing that we ate. I actually wondered if it was a mistake and the waiter was of little help, so I'm still not certain. I wouldn't mind the prices they charge for it if the portions were better or the quality was better.   I'll eat here again, but I won't order the sushi or sashimi next time and I'll make sure that there isn't a shift change happening.",

    "text": "Sushi Samba is such a young and hip restaurant with urban Japanese art all over the restaurant which is accompanied by loud upbeat music. The crowd here is pretty young and pretty drunk. haha. The table sitting next to me was cackling the entire time, but I didn't mind. Anyways, enough about the ambiance and decor, let's talk about the food and mannnnn did me and my sister order kind of A LOT. The plates are kind of tapas style so you kinda have to order a lot.  My sister and I were overly excited about Sushi Samba being a Japanese, Peruvian, and Brazilian restaurant. We ordered a little bit of everything. So here it is:  - Chicken skewers with Peruvian corn and scallops: Very very tasty. Chicken was tender and grilled to perfection! Peruvian corn, who knew such a thing existed, but nonetheless like ordinary corn. I especially liked the scallops because they were lemony and the presentation was so pretty! - Jumbo shrimp ceviche: way too sweet - Tuna ceviche: tuna was fresh and soft, not too sweet, but not too bland.  2 sushi rolls, but I forgot the name, but one of them included kobe beef, I think the Bobo Brazil... and that one was AMAZING! - Tuna tataki: MUST ORDER. Good presentation, perfect balance of crisp and soft. Tuna was tasty - Seared wagyu beef: the sauce accompanying this dish is so perfect. The beef and mushroom was so good.    Also try the dessert!  We ordered more stuff, but don't wanna drag this review on. Just know that you should come here before a night of dancing and drinking because Sushi Samba is the perfect place to fill your belly and pre-game!",

    "text": "*While reading this review, please imagine some angels singing. It will help you to fully understand the awesomeness that is SushiSamba.   On our last night in Vegas my husband requested either steak or sushi. Now, I don't care for sushi. I know it's an acquired taste and I'm working very diligently on acquiring it. So I said, \"let's do sushi.\" We hopped on over to SushiSamba and were greeted warmly and sat right away. Our waitress was amazing. One of the best waitresses I think I've ever been waited on. She shared her favorites and offered to make suggestions/ answer questions all without being snooty like you know they sometimes are. (maybe that's just me, maybe I'm projecting).   We ordered:  Mojitos - you can get muddled fruit added and we got pineapple. Seriously tasty.  Tuna Ceviche - tuna, tomatoes, jalapenos, and more. This was my first time eating ceviche and I think I'm in love.  Chef's Plate sushi and sashimi - I'm not big on sushi, I mentioned that right? This won me over, well, this won me over on raw fish. I've decided I don't care for the taste of seaweed so it's really just the rolls I don't like. Sashimi? Yes, please. Trio of meats platter - you get to choose 3 or 5 meats. We did 3 - hanger steak, rib eye and linguica (which is a sausage, I didn't know what it was, had to ask). Oh my, just divine. Everything was cooked to perfection, the two chimichurri sauces that accompanied were amazing and it came with collard greens which I happen to love but my husband does not. He ate the collards. :)   My only complaint is that I was too full for desert. I guess that is not the fault of SushiSamba but still, I was pretty disappointed. I also wished we hadn't eaten there on our last night because I would have liked to eat there again. Oh well, there's always next time.",

I kept mum about being Peruvian but after ordering a Pisco sour and a cusquena for my colleague, the waiter quickly caught on. We did something unusual, and we let the waiter decide our feast for the evening.. and boy was it a feast fit for this pricness right here.   I can't tell you how many rounds of food came.. but they were ALL heavenly. From the ceviches to the makis to the dumplings to the sashimi to the moon and back. It was absolutely wonderful.   We have several Sushi Samba where I live in Miami.. but it's never the same eating there as it is in the Venetian in Las Vegas.. but then again, nothing is quite like Vegas.",

We were told the items are mostly served family style but after looking through the menu we had no idea what to order. The server suggested doing their a la carte menu where we tell them a per person price point, our likes and dislikes and the chef will customize a meal for us.   Best idea ever!!!  We said $60 per person would be good.  What we received: 3 course meal, complimentary dessert for the bride to be and a free round of small strawberry drinks for the table.  The appetizer course had 4 plates: fried green beans, edamame, and peppers; dumplings; buffalo shrimp; taco with tuna I believe...but I told the waiter at the beginning that I dont eat anything raw and they bought me a lobster taco instead  The entree course: steak and mushroom;  fish skewers (I normally don't eat fish but this was my favorite!); crab  Sushi course: so much sushi I can't even name them all!  Dessert: (for the bride) white and black chocolate mousse with small rice crispy chocolate balls  The best part was that they customized the entire meal for us including the number of items for everyone to share. The $60 pp was more than enough food! With tip, tax and not including the bride's share, it came out to $80 pp. I think we could have done $50 and been satisfied bc we were super stuffed afterwards! Yum!   I loved how we got to try a bit of everything!",

The rock shrimp tempura appetizer is absolutely amazing, and I love they cover it in a black truffle vinaigrette.  For dinner we had sushi, and it was delicious!  The only downfall of the restaurant is that the tables are SUPER close together, so it is really loud in there and you have no privacy.  Hey, that's typical Las Vegas though!",

I would normally give 5 stars but this new atmosphere they've created with the ties and girls having their hair up creates an uptight environment that is neither inviting nor fun. I had my food and left. I had zero interest in hanging out and having fun. I hope this changes because I would hate to go over to the Mirage for sushi...I know it sounds trivial but to me the atmosphere makes a huge difference given the choices here in Vegas...",

They had all the guests lumped together in a section where we were packed into a cluster of tables like we were eating at a hot dog eatery in a Tokyo subway. To my left was Captain Bitchy Bitch, a wormy white collar jackass that ripped on the food and the fact that the water was flat, and called out the poor busboy for not giving him all his sparkling water. To my right was mommy neurotic, who announced grandly at the beginning of dinner that \"this is a 'no phone night!'\" then proceeded to interrupt hubby's ramen orgy with tales from the nanny.  It was not an enjoyable dining experience. I could smell the tic tacs that Mommy neurotic was chomping nervously when she sat down. Love those strawberry ones - don't tell me they are \"for the kids\", mommy.   As for the food? Ok. Not worth the price, timing of our order was laughable (and our neighbors were not pleased either with how the kitchen's timing played out for their meal(s)). Cocktails were good...but I left feeling somewhat ripped off (not a good value) and exhausted after our triple-date-by-proximity.  Go to grand luxe instead. If you are looking for funky fusion, go to the spa and get a Brazilian wax and drink French wine.",

The staff are professional and friendly, making this an enjoyable experience.  The dress code is casual, but not sloppy attire. Reservations are recommended, however, should you choose to walk in and find yourself having to wait, there is a bar conveniently located next to the host booth.  If you are looking for the ultimate dish, then I suggest the Hot Rock.  It is a rock heated to 700 degrees to cook thinly sliced Kobe beef on with a myriad of sauces and toppings.  I had a favorite sushi place in Vegas, and this has now taken the top spot!!",

We stopped in for a late lunch and I ordered the grilled eggplant, and the pacific roll.  The grilled eggplant was grilled to perfection and drenched in this sweet teriyaki type glaze.  It was amazingly good.  In fact I think they should make that by itself  main dish. The pacific roll was also very very good, the sushi was high quality and a good size.    Not only was the food fantastic but the customer service was GREAT.  The server accidentally spilled sauce on me (just on my leg and thankfully it didn't get on my clothes).  He profusely apologized and I told them not to worry about it.  Next thing I know, the girls and are were bought out an extra dish of scallops with a creamy pesto sauce on the house.  Apparently it was a chef special and not even offered on the menu, and it was fantastic.  The scallop was cooked to perfection...succulent and juicy and the pesto sauce on it was equally as amazing.  It was SO good in fact we went back the next day, and when we asked about that dish again since it was off menu, they were soo happy we came back and liked it, they gave it again to us free!    Excellent customer service, high quality food, and free perks!  That's my kinda establishment.  Very happy and pleased with our experience, we will definitely be back.",

Don't get me wrong, we clearly did not go here for the drinks, but they were a definite added bonus. Try the one with the Guava it will blow your mind. Right when you enter there is a bar that you can sit and drink at or you can get seated and the tables are classy and comfortable. There's a little private party section and a massive alcohol selection. The wait staff were on top of their game and not at all pretentious.  I loved that this place is open incredibly late, getting fresh sushi at midnight on a Tuesday was not a problem. Everything we ate was really simple and tasty. The shi-take mushroom skewers were pleasantly surprising and the salmon fell apart in my mouth before I had the chance to chew.  They had a few basic rolls that were normal priced, but overall it was a little pricey. However, it's expected in Vegas and worth every penny.",

    "text": "When we were in Vegas in November, we decided to dine at Sushi Samba one night since we were staying at the Palazzo. The restaurant is tucked away in the corner and has a dark sexy vibe to it. We had 6:30 pm reservations on a Friday night and since it was a little early, the restaurant was not overly busy which allowed us to receive a lot of attention from Mike, our waiter. He was one of the best waiters I have had in a restaurant in a long time...he was very helpful in helping us select a bottle of sake and made recommendations on the food and how many plates to order for our group of 5. Plus he checked on us often enough so we didn't sit with empty glasses, but not too much where it was annoying.  The food was amazing for the most part. The scallops and chicken robota were my two favorite things that we ordered that evening. The scallops were cooked perfectly and were not gritty at all. They didn't quite have that melt in my mouth feeling, but were some of the best I have had since moving to the Southwest. My husband sampled some of the sushi that our group ordered, and even as a sushi newcomer, he was not blown away by it. It was probably the most disappointing of the dishes that our group ordered. Our group received three complimentary desserts (we were celebrating 3 birthdays that evening) of which the chocolate hazelnut dish was my favorite. It was absolutely heavenly.  Our group's bill came to approximately $200, which I thought was reasonable given the number of dishes we ordered, plus we also had a bottle of sake ($62 itself), and several other alcoholic beverages. Sushi Samba is definitely a great restaurant for those dining in a group because the circular booths are large and perfectly designed for chatting with the person next to you or across the table. I will definitely dine again at Sushi Samba on a future trip to Vegas.",

    "text": "I think the reason why I put off this review for 2 months is that I've been afraid of not praising this place enough with what I'm about to say in a couple of lines. First of all, thanks to my procrastination, I've forgotten the incredibly friendly manager's name who treated us newly legals to 3 Chu-cumber shots, which, btw, go down ridiculously well. (Maybe his name was Anthony...?) Anyway, he also hooked us up with a bouncer at Tryst and we got in without having to wait! So the staff and their service is really really amazing. I'm pretty positive if you go there (soon), there will still be this omg-drool-with-my-eyes-like-it's-possible waiter there ready and waiting to fill up your glass of water... or take your order... or ravage - no, that's it.   Enough about the awesome service, the food was also REALLY REALLY amazing. It's a Brazilian/Japanese fusion type restaurant, but I'm not really big on Brazilian unless it's like a churascaria, so we went with mainly Japanese type dishes. (I mean \"Japanese\" in the most non-traditional way though)   The condensed version looks like this and in this order (But ALL should be had at least once - write it down guys, seriously. Prepare yourselves): BoBo Brazil Roll Green Envy Roll El Topo Roll Miso Marinated Chilean Sea Bass (way too small for it's own good.)  Neo Tokyo Roll  This place is pretty pricey, but I've been here 3 times already and I don't intend to stop. I've pretty much made an agreement with myself that I will eat here at least once any time I'm in Vegas.   5 Stars!!   Okay, and I know I mentioned \"condensed version\" earlier which implies a more in-depth explanation to those, but too bad? You're just going to have to trust me.   HAPPY GAMBLING, HAPPY CLUBBING, HAPPY EATING, and HAPPY SAMBA-ING. :)",

We told him what we were looking for and he quickly suggested Samba Sushi, adding that \"it's the best sushi on the Strip!\"...   After walking nearly a mile, we found Sushi Samba. The decor looked interesting and it had a great vibe.   We each ordered a special roll and split another spicy tuna roll. After waiting 20 minutes, three small, thin, very weird looking rolls arrived to our table.   I will spare you the details of how Apryl and I managed to get these things down, but it was not easy. Hands down, the worst sushi I've ever had the trouble of putting in my mouth. The idea and creativity of the roll sounds better on the menu than it looks, and far better than it actually tastes. Flavorless and lacking any kind of texture.   Save yourself $50... Buy a can of tuna and leave it in your hotel room for a day or two... It'll taste the same.",

Yamato was tasty and very pretty but only had three pieces for $19.  California rolls could have been better for being $14.  They were very plain tasting.  Shrimp and veggie tempura were good, but small for $14 (I think there were three pieces of small shrimp and three veggies) and came with two sauces, a spicy sauce and the tempura sauce.  Can't recall what everyone else had, but I think everyone agreed it was okay.  Drank: Lemon Samurai, $12.  Tasted like Lipton Brisk Ice Tea, which could be good or bad depending on if you like Lipton Brisk Ice Tea.  I don't.  Bottom Line: This place is pricier than some of the trendy sushi joints in LA that have a better vibe and tastier sushi, but it makes a great first stop for a night out in Vegas.

I sat at the sushi bar and was comfortable.  However, the way the bar is constructed, you are unable to view the chefs making the meal, which is a big part of the fun.  Anyway, after dinner a gentleman walked out of the kitchen with a tray of warm cookies and offered them up.  Very cool touch!",

From the minute we were seated by the hostess to the end of our dinner, the experience was wonderful. The ambiance of the restaurant is very modern and fun. Our waiter was very knowledgable about all the food and beverages. Throughout our dinner he took the time to explain all the dishes to us as they came out. My husband had a Sake, and I tried their signature Samba juice, both drinks were very good. We tried a little bit of everything from appetizers to entrees. The food was delicious! The sushi would rate among the best that we ever had. Their menu is a fusion of Brazilian and Japanese, so they had some very different items to choose from that you don't see at other Japanese restaurants. We also had a chance to meet Chef Joel as he walked around the restaurant. He was very personable, and took the time to talk with my husband and I. He explained to us about some of the dishes that were on the menu, and you could see the passion he had for the food. It makes us really excited to go back and try more! The excellent serve we received, the exciting environment, and the delicious food makes for a wonderful experience. This is one restaurant I think should be tried by all that come to Las Vegas!",

    "text": "These 5 stars goes to the lady who was so damn good at her job by fulfilling every aspect of our dining experience that the food was more like a plus. I wish I got her name to credit her but we were a party of 8 girls staggering in late in high heels for our dear friend's bachelorette reserved dinner on a Saturday night a week ago. We got the run down quickly on doing their style of \"omakase\" after mentioning we had a show and had to finish by 9pm. We gave her free rein with a price per person between $30 to $40. Now, I was the only one who had been here before for the same concept so I was expecting the same good service and food. So I discreetly asked the lady server to make sure to add the Miso Sea Bass skewers. She happily replied, \"I gotchu girl!\"  We were then offered the extensive sake and wine menu, which we had to forgo. And one of the girls almost ordered the cucumber martini but didn't.   After the time it took for a buzzed dude to walk over, show us his awesome swim trunks, (clearly forgetting to dress his bottoms to match his sharp shirt), wink and share a charming smile, and then leave...our appetizers were presented by a team of 3 servers. - Otsumami: trio of edamame, tempura green beans with amazing truffle dip, grilled shishito pepper :) - Pork Gyozas (ok) - Rock Shrimp Tempura (wasn't as succulent or saucy but still good)  Our waters were always filled. Thank you water guy!  Then after enjoying our appz for about 20 mins, came out the yummiful skewers, 3 specialty rolls of sushi (could have asked for the El Topo roll but decided try the others) and an entree split by 2 plates to share. It was the teriyaki chicken with fried onions atop mashed purple potatoes. This is so yum because the chicken was juicy and flavorful!  We were having our fill and we were on schedule. Then the lady server got us a surprise sake tree of their cucumber martini! Also very refreshing and yum to end our meal.  We had to pack a bit of to-go and we were happy with the service. She lined our meal down the middle of our price range to about $36/person (plus tax+tip $45). So exceeded my last experience here!  I recommend the omakase style because the servers really do know the menu. Trust!",

We went with a group and had no idea what we were getting ourselves into. with around 8 people we basically just gave the waiter a set price and told him to pick stuff himself and let us try as much of a variety as we could. The lowest he could go was $40 a person which sounded fair to us.   For the next hour and a half he brought out around 10 plates all with delicious things for us to taste. I was worried that no one would leave full but we all filled up pretty quickly and everything was beautifully made and tasted great!  It's pricey but I think it's worth it. Next time I go, I will be prepared to drop more cash to get more food.  I will never forget the sea bass. Ever.   The waiter was great by the way. I don't remember his name but he's great with people, knows the food inside and out, and really made it a great experience for us. He's blond with curly hair, not too tall, and lean, not a big dude. try to get him if you can.",

This place just supplied us with what the chef thought was good. I'm a vegetarian, so they altered a lot of food for me. I first tried some vegetarian taco. It was a small taco, filled with mushrooms. It was okay. I then had a seaweed salad, which looked beautiful. It had 4 different types of seaweed salad, all in one plate. It was then topped with red, fish eggs. I then had some grilled eggplant on a skewer, which was good. I also tried their vegetable, sushi rolls, which were okay. The BF had some steak and fish. He said the quality of the meat was really good.   PRICE: 3 out 5. Again, I didn't pay for my meal, but my BF's boss said the price was about $50-$75 a person. So it's a little pricey.   AMBIANCE: 5 out of 5. What a fun place! They had a basketball game playing, and the crowd was cheering the game on. They also had dim lighting, with a fun architecture to it.   SERVICE: 5 out 5. Waiter was good, and they were constantly checking up on us.   Overall, this place is worth it if you can afford it!",

I don't think they are on the menu but ask for the waygu mini tacos, they are awesome. The absolute favorite and a must have is the waygu beef hot stone. They bring out thin slices of waygu with different oils and spices. You get to cook yourself and the beef is so juicy and tender! It's a must have on the menu. I have brought work groups here and they all rave about the sushi. My largest issue is the service, sometimes is great and sometimes not. We once had a reservation for a large group and Ty somehow lost and took an hour to fix, my issue was they really didn't seem to care about the large inconvenience even though we had a table of 15 and spent thousands of dollars. In anycase I plan to return again and double check reservations!",

    "text": "Sushi Samba puts an excellent spin on traditional sushi.  The fusion of Japanese and South American flavors are a perfect combination.  Since I like my food on the spicy side, I found that Sushi Samba adds that flare to usually very neutral sushi.    The one dish I found to be my favorite of the visit was the Hamachi (Yellowtail) Sashimi Tiradito.  Hamachi is always a great choice for its oil content, but along with the spicy/tangy sauce it is served on is a more than suitable replacement for shoyu.  I also tried the Yamato Roll, which is sushi with maguro and  foie gras, a great and unique flavor.  One disappointment I found was the Kobe Beef Sushi.  I would rather have had otoro.  One last recommendation, don't order collard greens at a sushi place.  It was decent although it was no southern style collard greens that I prefer.    I will definitely go back to Sushi Samba the next time I am in Vegas.  There are so many things on the menu that I still want to try!",

I was pretty blown away by everything from the taste to the originality.  I'm not sure why this place doesn't have a higher rating, but reading some of the lower reviews it all seems to be service related, which I can't really judge accurately cause I came in the middle of service, and in between meals we were hitting on girls in the casino, bar, and restaurant.  But anyway back to the food, we had various things that were a blur in my memory, but the impression still remains.  Tasting each dish and each one of its elements I was thoroughly impressed by everything.  I haven't been that impressed by food in a while and I'd definitely recommend this place to anyone asking for a Vegas suggestion.",

    "text": "I really like this place! We were tired from walking around and shopping, and craved a light snack. A lot of things were really heavy, so we decided that sushi was a safe bet. Not knowing anything about that place, we went there sort of on a limb.  I went there on a quiet day at an unconventional time (prob around 3PM), so it wasn't bustling with people and loud chattering. There were probably at most about 5 other tables that were occupied with diners. It's dim-lit and all the interior designing seemed to fit a sort of cool, mellow, and dark color scheme. Very relaxing..  Our waitress was a very nice girl. She was knowledgeable, very attentive, and very sweet. She was working during the holidays, and if she hated every second of it...well, we really couldn't tell. I asked her for suggestions on rolls, and her suggestions were great.  Although their sushi rolls aren't exactly traditional, they were really unique. Flavorful, but light. Just what we were looking for! I got a nontraditional roll that was wrapped in a sort of pink-ish rice paper rather than seaweed, and I just felt so healthy and nice eating it. What a relief from eating something something so refreshing! One pleasant little perk was that when I asked for green tea, we had the option to have it iced or hot. Maybe I'm biased because I was tired from walking around all day, but man. That iced unsweetened green tea was so perfect.  As for the price, I reviewed the menu and realized that yes, it's a little expensive, but what else could you expect for Vegas? I guess it's motivation for you to go back out there and win your Avocado Rolls worth back!",

The setup was pretty cozy but since the space was so small, half the table had to get up if one person in the middle needed to go to the bathroom.  I think it was some sort of package that the maid of honor ordered so I don't know the pricing, but it was ALOT of food. They brought out all these meat dishes before the sushi and most of us ladies were very full by the time the sushi came out. I remember liking the sushi here more than the meat, so I had to have some!   Service was very good, our waiter was a nice young man.  I'd definitely come back to Sushi Samba for sushi and drinks.",

This is a 50+yr old man acting like a 5yr old.  In our 30's & 40's...We were way too mature to say anything back.  A really nice Asian lady-host (very attractive) approached me & offered to do her best to slide us in if any of the tables became available.  Five-minutes later I get a call to come-back quickly because she found a way to squeeze all six of us in.  Ironically it was next to the 5yr old mentality man...LOL!!!  Another 5-Stars for the menu!!!  I love Asian-Fusion cuisine & this place has a pretty large menu.  We were a moderate size group, so we tried almost everything on the menu.  Our consensus on likes are as follows: Sawagani Green Bean Tempura Seaweed Salad Tiger Shrimp Tempura Yellowtail Seviche Jumbo Shrimp Seviche Peruvian Bay Scallops (Robata) Anticuchos Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass Samba Rolls (Pacific) Samba Rolls (Rainbow Dragon) Samba Split for Two (Dessert) Mochi (Dessert) Housemade Ice Cream & Sorvete (Dessert) Pisco Sour (Cocktails) Chicha Sour (Cocktails) Samba Juice (Cocktails)  The general manager (partner) came out to greet us, which was quite interesting.

So we definitely got good service!  Well visiting Las Vegas 3 weeks later I decided to look for a local SushiSamba. Using yelp I found there to be a SushiSamba in Venetian on the strip. I checked their website to verify they were open and found out they had a reverse (late) happy hour starting at 11pm till close. So my friend and I took a cab from Hardrock hotel (probably last time there, thats a whole different story) to Venetian hotel. On arrival I saw the bar was placed in front where there were a few seats available. So we sat down towards the end of the bar and asked if we could eat dinner at the bar. The bartender Mari (Maria)  gave us some menus and we asked for the happyhour menu which had just started. I asked about some of the items on the menu and she was very friendly and informational. My friend was actually not feeling good and she gave him some tonic water and small amount of bitters to help ease his stomach. (which actually helped later on) She ended up getting real busy at the bar but no matter how busy she got she always made sure we got what we needed in a timely manner. She balanced about 10-15 bar patrons orders drink and food wise along with still making drinking for all the waiters ordering drinks for their patrons. I felt she was really efficient and still friendly in demeanor always smiling! I find good freindly custommer service is hard to come by now a days. Kristina the floor manager checked in with us and made sure we were doing ok and that all our needs were meet. Another great show of good customer service. When the managers come up and check in with their patrons I feel they are actually taking interest and want to make sure all your needs are being meet! We had a really good night there so much we decided to go back the following night to see if we could have another good successful night again. Well our expectations were exceeded again. Mari was working again and thanked us for returning and even went out her way to have us try a few things on the menu we didn't even order to ask our opinion. She even made drinks to our specific needs (my friend didn't want that much sugar in his drink) She made it to meet his needs and turned out to still be a decent drink. Mari's good customer service was the best during my stay in Vegas and I was there july 4-9. She far exceeded my expectations and went above and beyond! The floor manager Kristina also sat down with us to talk about customer service and again making sure everything meet our expectations.  I have to recommend SushiSamba, the bartender Mari (Maria) and the floor manager Kristina. 5 stars and i would tell anyone heading to visit to make it a stop for sushi or tapas.",

People are filing in from the casino so yeah... Anyway, they serve Brazilian, Peruvian and Japanese styled food. The waiters are all on point, super nice, and they do care about your overall dining experience. This is a cute place to go on a date (If you don't mind not talking due to the noise), or a place to hang with your peeps. Go!",

The service was amazing, we had Vanessa who was one of the best waitresses we have ever had.  The food came in under 5 minutes, tasted great, Vanessa's recommendations were great, and we just had an overall great time.  When we are in town next, we will make sure to visit sushi samba again.",

I'm sure that everyone comments on the sea bass, and so I'll add my two cents- phenomenal. Fresh sea bass is tough to find and they prepared it the best way possible (IMHO), skewered with a miso glaze. We depended on our sharp, confident waitress to guide us through the menu and she did wonders. Along with the sea bass, our rolls were expectantly first class as was the fresh tuna seviche with almonds and jalapenos rich with flavor. Aside from the crazy movie looping on the wall in the background wandering aimlessly from a south China fishing village to a hot Brazilian beach; the atmosphere was relaxing and comfortable also- a bit trendy, but what did you expect?",

    "text": "Came here to grab dinner on a random day.  No special occasion.  My friend and I found the service average, the decor strange/ugly, and the food interesting/questionable.  It's supposed to be a Japanese/Brazilian fusion place.  I can see this place being a real pleaser for people who are not familiar with authentic Japanese or Brazilian food.  Being Japanese with a sister-in-law from Brazil, I found myself qualified to test the food out.  I think the only dish I got that I found myself satisfied with was the edamame....but it's pretty much impossible to mess edamame up.  My 7 year old niece can make it blindfolded.    I recognized that things might be bad from the start with the seaweed salad.  Wow was it awful.  Nice presentation but no flavor!!  It was so watered down that I couldn't even taste the seaweed itself.  I might as well have eaten gelatin with no flavoring.  It was THAT bad.   I also got the red miso.  It was mixed with truffle oil and mushrooms.  I did not find the truffle oil mixed with the miso soup appetizing at all....the flavors just did not mesh for me.    The sushi was a bit too fusion for me....I found the flavors to not really complement each other.  I did order regular tuna sashimi just to get something with no fusion and more Japanese authenticity....the tuna quality was excellent but WOAH overpriced!  $4.50 for ONE piece of sashimi.  It was good but not THAT good.  The ramen was ok...nothing to talk about later.    As you can tell, we were not impressed.  We ordered an array of things expecting for something to blow us away, but we were disappointed.  $80 later, we headed home and looked for something on the way to satisfy our appetites.",

As you would expect for a location in a 5-star Vegas strip hotel (The Palazzo), this is NOT your father's typical sushi restaurant . As our server informed us immediately, the food is a mix of cultures that is served from from one of three kitchens - as soon as it's ready.  That was just fine with us as we were quite hungry!  We found only two problem with this place (both of which could be fixed quite easily): 1) When one of us ordered a glass of cranberry juice, it came watered down. Our server was extremely apologetic and mentioned they called their supplier after they discovered our drink.  Apparently their mix delivery system was on the blink. 2) A bus person was very enthusiastic about picking up dishes... sometimes before we were finished.  We mentioned his need to refrain from this and he complied.  If you're looking for sushi in Vegas that's different than run-of-the-mill sushi (but still quite excellent, of course) this would be a great place to check out!",

Wicked refreshing.  Tried the lobster robata, cooked perfectly, but not sure if I enjoyed the flavors as much as previous items.  They do so much in the kitchen, that when you try so much, it's tough to enjoy everything because there are a vast variety of flavors.  Lobster robata had a spicy ikura vinagrette, with some heat to it.  Freshest sushi and sashimi i've ever had.  Signature dish for me is the sea bass robata anticucho.",

Everyone is really nice, especially the ladies at the bar. The happy hour menu is such a great deal too, $6 for everything (I think there's at least 8 different items to choose from, including 2 different drinks. I recommend the mojito). I loved the salt and pepper squid (a BETTER version of fried calamari), spicy tuna roll, and the yellowtail seviche (it had a really nice ginger flavor to it). The kobe beef tacos were also amazing. As I mentioned in my previous review, the portions are not the biggest, but when you factor in that this is vegas, you are actually getting pretty good bang for your buck.   They should use maybe brighter lights inside though, it's kind of tucked away and easy to miss, in my opinion. People need to see this place!! :)   Great prices, great service. I will definitely be back! Thanks sushi samba!",

It took half the remainder of my dinner to get the taste out of my mouth from one of them. 2 - No Brazilian beer.   I ordered a Brazilian lager and 10 minutes later was told they were out of it.  I then ordered a South American Pilsner and they were out of that.  I then decided not to drink.  After mentioning the oyster quality to our server, the manager asked what they could do.  Well, they found that Pilsner they were out of.  The sushi was decent, but not exceptional. The Brazilian fish stew was rather boring, the coconut rice, beans and quinoa about average and the grilled eggplant not so good.  I was hoping for the eggplant that Sensei can deliver.  Tables are very small for the larger number of dishes and it's extremely loud.  I guess I shouldn't have expected much from a Brazilian-Peruvian-Japanese fusion.  I haven't been to Peru, but feel that Brazilian cuisine is about as good as  English food.  Perhaps I would have liked their Wagyu beef, but at $32/oz. and the seeming lack of kitchen talent, I decided not to try it.",

I feel like I should preface my review by saying that I'm from Hawaii and seeing Larger than Life Vegas decor is rare to see back home. This is not to say there aren't trendy, cool looking restaurants, it's just to say they aren't found on every block in Hawaii.  First of all, I dug the atmosphere. Really mellow, a restaurant that looks part modern art gallery, part restaurant, and part trendy graffiti hangout.   The food was really delicious and I wish I could remember the names of everything I ate. I'm not a big fish person, but I had this miso sea bass and it was sooo good. Just the right amount of flavoring and no fishy taste (which I don't like when eating fish). I also had a butter garlic scallop that just melted in my mouth.   The service was superb, the manager introduced himself and made sure we had a great time, and the food was delicious.  We definitely need something like this back in Hawaii. Would definitely go back again.",

Group of six...all sushi enthusiasts from California...ready to throw down a great meal after a great show (BTW Blue Man Group Rocks!)   The worst service EVAH! Why have three different kitchens if your servers cannot keep up with ONE!?  Ordered Sparkling saki Moon Rabbit...got Star Rabbit instead...mmmm...ok...BUT to have the nerve to treat me as if I didn't know which saki I ordered?! SHAME.    Then we look at the menu... Seriously? $6 for ONE piece of sushi? WOW!  I know I can get grade A sushi without the price elsewhere so I opted for a quasi-meal and ordered the Lobster for $25...knowing it was gonna be small, I figured I would try and get somewhat of a meal since my sushi bill alone would've been OFF the charts.  I was told it was the shell with three small pieces of lobster on top.  WRONG! I about fell over and died when I realized, after digging through the smelt eggs with my chopsticks, that there was NO meat!  NO LOBSTER MEAT whatsoever!!!  I went in again and picked up what I thought was meat and it was a piece of shell.  HOLY SHIT...they just served me lobster tail without meat...NO LIE.  I sent it back and refused to order anything else since the rest of my party was almost done with their meal.  I was annoyed, hungry, and our check took a fucking century because our server knew she was getting her 20% no matter how shitty our experience.    BEWARE! This place is a sham and a sorry excuse for servicing people that are willing and ready to spend good money for a good meal.  I HATE the strip for that very reason.",

The wait staff was ON POINT with delivering drinks and clearing our table as well. We did the $50 per person tasting menu and got exactly what we paid for! I will recommend this sushi restaurant to anyone who is traveling to Vegas who is looking for fabulous food, fun atmosphere and a well trained staff! Thanks guys!!!",

    "text": "My boss and I had an iffy business trip in Las Vegas but we were so glad we stopped by sushisamba for brunch. Brunch you say? yes, I was thinking the same thing. I work at a magazine and if I wasn't a food snob already, eating with my boss is gradually making me one. Their brunch was a wonderful surprise! We started with freshly squeezed juice. I ordered a blueberry/strawberry/banana combo. You can mix three juices in one. My boss also ordered her own combination. The brunch is family style and up to 4 dishes for $23 each person. If you have a bigger party, the servings will be larger. We ordered Eggs Any Style, Smoked Salmon Platter, Assorted Pastries and Bread and either the el topo tamago roll or the sunday samba roll.  We ate them all up. My boss even ordered a cappucino before our drive back to LA. They have locations in Chicago and NYC as well. The menu looks the same out there too. Yum, what a great finale! The waiters and manager were wonderful. They all stopped by to see how we were doing. It was a beautiful fusion of Peruvian and Japanese food. I was expecting to just eat sushi and a bento meal for brunch! So good!",

This \"ambience\" is like a night club, it was loud (noise and visually) cramped and stuffy.  Even if you like that stuff, being in the Palazzo it was so out of place.  It was so cramped that I saw a group of women eating their tapas plate on off the couch, how unsatisfying.  Some people say that this is some kind of fine dining place; the problem is the food was nasty and the menu didn't even make sense (Do you want some fried plantains with that Sashimi?  Uhh, No.) Did I say that it was also way overpriced?  They charged me $40 for just one sushi roll.  I guess somebody has to pay for the vintage looking ripped fish net stockings the waitresses were wearing.   If you are a mega bro, going to do some people watching, totally come here bra.   If you are looking for sushi, leave Las Vegas immediately.",

I mean it is called sushi samba so I expected some south american food with the sushi but not even a philly roll? Aside from the crazy menu which actually was decent I just wasn't feeling that adventurous that night, the service was great. The samurai staring at me while I peed was a little unnerving and also a little erotic.The one thing that kept throwing me off was that I thought I went to a restaurant not a nightclub. I couldn't hear my server ask me if I wanted a refill on my delicious drink. Dark and loud. Which is perfect if all you need to order is a whiskey/ginger or rum/coke or something along those lines but what you need to order is the Capoeira Roll and a Green Envy Roll hold the wasabi pea crust and WTF is yamagobo? That's gotta be hard to explain when you aren't screaming over the DJ....",

I am friends with the Managers at the SouthBeach Location so when i went to go hang out with a friend in Sin City i decided to pull rank and get some First Class service knowing full well i was gonna lose money on the tables.  Yeah i lost money but wasnt disappointed one bit at the Sushisamba location at the Palazzo Hotel. I will avoid mentioning having to drop a former friend from ruining my dinner right b4 it started but as soon as i got to the location which i must say is unbelievable and by far is the best designed Sushisamba, A close second will be the now defunct location in Dallas at the Galleria mall. I felt like a kid when i entered the restrooms. I had a nice corner to myself and the Hostess was kind enuff to keep me company since i got jilted by a former friend (which i refuse to talk about).   I got Ala carte type service and even the Chef, Jose came out to greet me and making me feel special cos he remembered me from the Southbeach spot. The taquitos were incredible i had the yellow tail and the lobster one. I decided i was only going to do small plates so i ventured to the Anticuchos and ordered the Chicken liver which just melted in my mouth and made Vegas worthwhile and followed by the Chilean Sea bass that the hostess recommended. For my drink i always get their Caiprinha which is like a Brazilian mojito and was on point.  Now i was getting full but the Chef surprised me with a Kobe Beef plate which was Sushi grade and once again splendid and lest i forget i also ordered the Peruvian corn for my side which is ridiculously tasty.   There were several groups in town for Bachelors parties and partying in General and the decor just made the groups blend in and make it very private.   Will definitely be back",

    "text": "Waiting for my friends at the bar located near their entrance, I had a good feeling about this place.  It had all the bells and whistles of a nice upscale restaurant with a friendly bartender to start.  Unfortunately my good feeling about this place was short lived as our party was seated.  Our reservation was for 9:15 PM Sunday night.  We didn't get seated until 9:45 PM despite having our whole party there by 9:00 PM.  I didn't care too much for this considering the place was moderately busy on a holiday weekend, and we weren't on a strict schedule.  So I let this roll easily off my back.  As we were seated, we were greeted by our waiter who was terribly unenthusiastic about his job.  He was considerate about asking  for food allergies.  Beyond that, all levels of consideration or customer service for that matter stopped there.  Granted, he warned us that our food would come out infrequently, but little did we know it would delay our dinner by over an hour.  A little honesty would have been greatly appreciated.  It took forever for most of our food to come out.  We didn't have utensils or place settings even after our food was delivered.  My friend even asked for the manager, to complain about our horrible service, or lack thereof.  The manager's response was something like: \"Things are are a bit backed-up, we'll give you free dessert.\"  Now, I don't care how backed-up your kitchen is... that's still no excuse for horrible and incompetent service!  Dessert only puts a band-aid on a broken arm... why the hell do restaurant managers  do this?  We are not looking to get something free, we just want to make sure they get their act together... and fast!  Our original waiter rarely came to our table after we ordered our food.  Another waitress came to our aid who was very helpful and attentive to our needs.  She was very friendly and courteous, it's unfortunate she wasn't our original waiter because this review would've been completely different.  Our unpleasant waiter did the weirdest thing.  As my friend was talking to the manager, being very open about our waiters horrible service, our waiter stood by our table as he refolded all our used napkins, tossing them onto our table.  Yes, our used clothe napkins.  Who does that?  In front of a party that is pretty disgusted by you no less.  It seemed as if he knew he was already in hot water and didn't give a rats-ass about making up for it.  In addition, he circled the portion of our bill they decided to discount for the unsatisfied service in a stuck-up negative manner.  In hind site, my friend said we should have taken that same pen, in front of our waiter, and scratched out his tip!  Of course, we're better than that.  The food is the only reason why this place is not getting a single star. The food was actually quite good with a variety of unique asian-fusion plates.  I ordered the Chicken Teriyaki (exotic right?) which was much more than I bargained for.  For such a simple dish, it had a variety of unique flavors with a side of extras that complimented each bite.  My friends ordered an array of food that looked just as good, and was commented on just the same.  For me, customer service will make or break any experience, no matter how good the food is.  In this case, their service failed horribly.  Our party ended up with a waiter that was a few cans short of a six pack regarding personality, who would probably fare better as a Chippendale's greeter than a restaurant waiter.  I hope management recognizes this and hires waiters that are actually qualified to interact with human beings.",

    "text": "On a hot Vegas weekend stay, my bf and I limited our dining choices to the Venetian and Palazzo (conveniently connected).  We stopped in for lunch without reservations or doing any prior research, except for the two minutes at the entrance perusing the menu.  They had only been open three weeks, so the staff seemed very eager to bring in any and all people.  Our server was extremely friendly, trying her best to make us comfortable and answer any questions.  I think she was Asian, but she said she grew up in somewhere in South America, and had an indiscernible accent.  She made everything on the menu sound tasty, but we were only looking for a light lunch.  I had the samba blt which was had yummy chunks of lobster, a bit of mayo heat and applewood smoked bacon.  It came with a side of fingerling potatoes with a sprinkling of some kind of cheese on top, which is called \"fries\" on the menu.  The pickles, I did not like - too tart.  I tried everything on my bf's anticuchos combination bento.  The box usually comes with chicken, beef and shrimp, but he requested the shrimp be switched out for the miso sea bass.  Its sweetness is best taken in small quantities, such as one skewer.  I liked it, but it is probably too sweet for some.  The tuna roll was acceptable.  It's incredibly dark inside, which makes the bright mall atmosphere outside all the more apparent.  I'd like to return for lunch, because I could envision this place being a too much like a noisy nightclub for dinner.",

The first night we ate there it was a quiet Monday night.  It felt like we had 4 servers and two managers attending our every need.  The lobster tempura and chef's special scallops are dishes worth returning to Vegas for.  Allen Holmes, our Holmes boy, was on top of his game.  Our only problem was that the food was so delicious that we probably over-ordered and could not even finish a couple of the dishes.  On our return several days later, Holmes and company treated us like we had been patrons for years, when it was only days before that we first dined there.  The second time around, we did not have a reservation, but Allen sat us down at the long counter style seating, which gave us a big picture view of the whole joint.  The food was equally outstanding.  I am returning with my guys group of ten next weekend.",

I've been a few times now and the food has been consistently good, the menu is nicely varied, and the service is decent too. Even on a busy night I've never felt rushed. The servers are pretty helpful figuring out how much to order and don't try to oversell to make more $$$ which I've found to be common in other tapas style places.  The reason for only 3 stars is that the sushi is just average. Really, I'd like to give a 3.5, if that could be done as there are a lot of other things to choose from. If you give this place a try, stick with the fusion dishes or small plates. Save your sushi cravings for somewhere else. Definitely try the miso glazed sea bass skewers though; it's like crack.",

I received a text when our table was ready, which was very helpful as you could walk around while you wait. We were given a free appetizer to compensate for the wait which was very nice. We informed our waiter about our show tickets and they were very accommodating in getting us out on time. The food and drinks were, as usual, amazing. I am very pleased with this improvement in service and look forward to returning.",

    "text": "My friend wanted to celebrate her tax return and take me to lunch (hooray for me!!) She wanted to have sushi on the Strip, well mostly all the sushi restaurants on the Strip don't open until dinner, except SUSHISAMBA, so that's where we landed.  While we waited for them to open, I was scoping yelp reviews to see what we should order. The Peruvian Corn seemed to be the #1 suggestion, so that's what we started out with.  Neither  one of us were impressed, sorry to say, but I felt like I was eating just a giant piece of corn kernal. But it was all uphill from there.   Our server, Drago, was very attentive and full of suggestions, he had asked if we dined here before and I told him I had been to the one in Miami, then he said he would bring us something on the house for coming back. When I tell you, you MUST order these, I'm not exaggerating, they were excellent, not on the menu, Peruvian Bay Scallops, prepared differently than the one on the menu. They were so good we had to order another round. I am a huge fan of yellowtail, so we ordered the Yellowtail taquitos, so tasty, I loved the crunch that the mini taco shell added to the yellowtail flavor. Next up was a table favorite as well, Sea Bass Miso, it melted in your mouth.  I was skeptical at first, they are served on a skewer, so I wasn't expecting the amazing flavor I tasted when I took my first bite. Drago suggested the El Topo roll, both of us like hot,, super spicy food, this roll had a nice kick at the end, I normaily don't like any kind of dairy on my sushi rolls, i.e. cream cheese, etc....but this had melted mozzarella, it was excellent. Then came the grand finale, my friend is a HUGE Kobe beef fan so she wanted to try the Wagyu beef, excellent grade A5, Ishi Yaki hot stone, dipping sauces, vegetables. presentation was so nice, lots of different sauces to try.  DESSERT, yes we still had room for dessert, we tried the Peruvian Hot Chocolate con Creme served with traditional churros and the Coco Duo dark and white chocolate custard with praline. The second one was by far the best. A must. Also try the house made iced tea, they mix fresh orange juice, lime juice and lemon with black tea.....think I drank a pitcher of it.  Good food, service, ambiance!",

We are regulars here, and as regulars, the chef likes to treat you with special meals! This time we had kobe beef tacos (i am pescetrian, so it was nice to look at, haha) as our meal. I also love their rolls, such as the Carnival roll. The red miso is also great, I LOVE truffle, but it was a little too salty (truffle oil). The desserts are to die for, such as the mini doughnuts in the hazelnut sauce and the funky banana dish. AND, best of all... it's a stones throw from BARNEY'S!!! You can shop while you wait for your food! But, its not like the food takes very long anyway :)",

I was extremely excited to try this place because of all of the positive reviews/rants I've heard. I am always looking to try new Sushi places and I must admit that I am quite the Sushi expert!  The first thing I must say is that this place is pricey! For $85 I only able to order:  - 2 glasses of Cabernet Sauvignons - 2 Miso Soups ($6.00 each and only had 1 Tofu in each bowl of soup) - Rainbow Dragon Roll - 2 Avocado Salmon Rolls - 1 Piece of Salmon Sashimi (embedded in an unknown vegetable) - 3 Hand Rolls  May I remind you that all of this was shared between two people. The portion size was fairly small. However,the freshness and the quality of the fish was amazing. That is probably the only thing positive about this restaurant. Oh yes, can't forget the fancy lighting and ambiance.  I was not impressed by the originality of the menu nor the taste of the food. I have tasted better sushi rolls for more than half the price of a Sushi Samba roll. I would have rather spent $85 at my local sushi restaurants in San Jose. At least there will be many tofu pieces in my miso soup not only 1. =P  -",

The pacific roll was decent but not worth the price you pay for. The salt and pepper squid was a let down since they use squid strips, which were thick and chewy.   Service: Friendly and down to earth. However our server failed to mention a tasting menu to us when other servers had mentioned it to nearby customers. Perhaps a bit of stereotyping?  Ambience: SushiSamba kills it on ambience. Japanese street art and whimsy decor fill the dining area. Its hip and urban and I love it. Their seating arrangements left something to be desired though. I sat centimeters away from guests on opposite sides of me. A bit claustrophobic.   Verdict: With some standout as well as some strikeout dishes, SushiSamba is that kind of place that's great to share a few Japanese inspired tapas before a drunken night out on the strip.",

The writing on the menu is so tiny it is ridiculous. I ordered the edamame and it was awful. How do you f'up edamame? My guess, didn't leave it in the microwave long enough. My b/f said the sushi was \"ok\" but nothing spectacular.   The last straw for me is from the sushi bar you look right into the dishwasher area. Great appetizing view that was.   Take a pass on this place!  Update: The manager called me to sort out the problems we had there on the 4th of July. They seemed genuinely interested in fixing the problems. He invited us back the next time we are in Vegas, which will be soon most likely. I will advise on how it goes.",

The Tomato Heirloom Salad ($13), is not even heirloom tomatoes :( You get a rainbow of cherry tomatoes, which haven't even been properly prepped and dressed for restaurant quality (think backyard bbq style).  The nigiri is sold as individual pieces, not in sets of two.  This is ok if it's above average nigiri but it was just average. Similar quality as an AYCE. So $12 for two pieces of tuna is disappointing.  (And yes I get that it's on The Strip, which is why I also expect better than your neighborhood sushi spot)  The Kumamoto oysters ($5) were good (thank you Mother Nature). Only one wasn't detached.  The ponzu jelly is a total umami bomb in your mouth, I highly recommend these!  Overall I give this a 2 rating because of the price; and I'm not cheap. I love food, menus, ordering; everything about the dining experience. But I also like to get the value of what I'm spending and for these prices I suggest Yellowtail (Bellagio), Nobu (Ceasars), or Morimoto's (MGM).  You'll be so much happier with your experience and the food.",

Made reservation for lunch at 12 yesterday, arrived as soon as they opened though, when I reserved I requested for a nice booth if possible. Hostess literally sat us with regular walk in customers (elbow to elbow with them) of which I had no problem with, but seeing that all the taller booths are empty, I was really dismayed.   Food saved the day!   Chilean sea bass and Rio Grande (churrasco plate) satisfied me and the hubby (plus our 14 year old daughter). Give the food 5 stars. And the Samba Iced Tea, superb!!!   We come to Vegas for all of our special occasion. I am a bit disappointed that for a place as cool as Sushi Samba, they didn't even bring out a complimentary scoop of ice cream or a slice of cake to help sweeten the occasion.   I am very generous with my Yelp scores especially when I am happy with how the food taste. But to get a perfect 5 Star, it should have been wow from Start to Finish.  We will come back, but I am going to pass on reserving for special occasion. This is a casual place where I will probably just start eating the cheaper items on the menu. They didn't go above and beyond when I needed it, therefore, this is going on choice B, going forward.",

We pretty much ordered almost everything on the vegan menu - Edamame, Shishito Peppers, Mushroom Tobanyaki, Heirloom Tomato Salad, Amazonia roll, Vegetable sushi, Robata - tomatoes, eggplant, mushrooms and asparagus and Tapioca Con Leche, the fruit plate and sorbet! NOMNOMNOM! SERIOUSLY FREAKIN' NOM!  And the vegetable sushi actually looked like little nigiri's they were so cute and delicious. Excellent presentation. It was also really nice they have this unique Amazonia roll. They really pulled off an amazing vegan menu and non vegans could of course enjoy this too and I highly recommend trying it!!

We had the jumbo shrimp seviche, seared wagu beef, samba strip, green tea, and a few hand rolls. The seviche needed something like more citrus or heat. It should also be served with enough plantain chips, two are definitely not enough. I liked the beef - the ponzu gelee was a nice touch. I wasn't a fan of the hand roll I tried (yellowtail jalapeno) it needed more flavor. The green tea was fine, served hot. I did like the samba strip - it has mellow flavor and the lotus root chip was a good addition. They would benefit by adding more of the chips so there would be enough - like 1 per piece of sushi.",

    "text": "Overall rating: 4.25/5 Parking: It's on the Vegas strip so I recommend parking off strip if you need to park Best time to go: Either when they open or late at night around 10pm  I remember coming here a long time ago for one of my girlfriends birthdays when we visited Vegas. Somehow we stumbled upon this place on Yelp and we were SO glad that we did! They have an Omakase option (chefs choice) where they work with your budget $ and what you like and don't like which is a great feature to have in a restaurant.   I came back again last week after remembering how much I enjoyed it here and I enjoyed the food just as much as I can remember. However, the prices are not nearly as good as I remember!  Last week, I came here for my birthday (3 days belated, but can't a girl embrace her birthday for more than just a day? )  Made a reservation for 9pm on a Sunday night via OpenTable and in the notes it said it was for my birthday dinner. Upon arrival, to our surprise there were still a lot of people so when we checked in wih the hostess she said we needed to wait an extra 10 minutes - that's fine! We sat in the waiting area behind the bar but as we were sitting there with full view of the hostess area, we can hear and realize that after 5 minutes she began seating others that didn't have a reservation, same party size as us (just 2 people) and came after us! Rude, right? So I asked went up to her and asked her again and she smiled and said yes, I have a table for you. Then proceeded to seat us at the worst possible table. They have a lot of art and it's designed in a modern way, but above me I had this object literally a couple inches from my head so I felt like I had to crouch down the entire time.   Now onto the more important things:  FOOD! :)  We were going to opt for the Omakase but realized it would be better to just order a few things we actually wanted to eat since we knew the specifics that we wanted.   Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza - $18 (Rating: 4.25/5) For 5 pieces of tiny gyoza, they were good but I couldn't tell the difference between regular beef and the A5 Wagyu so it was a bit disappointing. However, still good and I would recommend to order it during their happy hour!  Crispy Hokkaido Scallop - $7 each (3.5/5) It's kinda like a lettuce wrap and the waiter recommended it but this was just ok and not memorable  Uni Nigiri - $9 each (4.75/5) So good! There was no fishy taste but I wish there was a bit more uni because it seemed a little skimped but we were really surprised at how good this was.   Japanese Wagyu Nigiri - $12 each (3.5/5) It was ok, but we've definitely had better. It was not seared but was actually kinda cold. The texture wasn't melt-in-your-mouth good either  I probably wouldn't get this again.   Salmon Nigiri - $5 each (4.25/5) It was good and the texture was good too! I would order again.   Sao Paulo Roll - $24 each (3.5/5) This roll has a lot of items in it so we picked this one. It consists of scallop, masago, red onion, tuna, salmon, shrimp, whitefish, avocado, truffle, hacho miso soy, chimichurri. It's like their version of the rainbow roll.   Overall, I really like this place and I'll definitely be back. Be sure to make reservations!   It's located in the Palazzo hotel right next to Victorias Secret Pink :)",

What's really cool is that they let us set an approximate budget, and then we let them know what we'd like to try, food restrictions, etc. and then they take it from there. The dishes came out soo quickly that we could barely eat fast enough to keep up. Each dish was pretty amazing.. full of flavor!   Our server also provided great service, was super attentive and friendly.   Highly recommend this place.",

I had to call back twice and adjust the amount of guest and time  but they didn't give me a hard time which was nice. I thought it'd be a little more \"upscale\" so I definitely felt we were a tad overdressed. No biggie though!  With it being our first time there, we were a little overwhelmed when our server told us about everything. So we opted for the option that Issac,the server, would choose everything for us. It was a three course meal and it allowed us to try a little bit of everything they had on special for the night. I don't remember the names of anything we had lol but EVERYTHING WAS AMAZING. Though it sounded like we wouldn't get full, we both agreed the portions were perfect. Not too filling but definitely enough. There was space for dessert so that was perfect. The staff was very helpful and speedy with their service! Issac was so great to us and very informative. Everything he suggested we had, starting from the drinks all the way to the dessert. $160 for two to eat= Great pricing!",

That's it.   Our server, Alice gave us pretty bad services.  We visited there before 6PM and they weren't busy at all. We placed some orders but she didn't bring my child's dish at all.  After 30 minutes my child almost cried and we called Alice.  Then we found out that she hadn't ordered it.  10 minutes later we got kids beef skewers. but they were so bloody.  I had to return it to recook.  My child started crying finally.  We ordered Mochi Ice ream for my child's dessert and she repeated \"Mochi-icecream without any candy flakes, all right.\"  Worse, we got tons of candy flakes on them at the end. It was unacceptable.  I used to work as a waitress, so I understand sometimes it happens.  But not too many mistakes for one table.  It's clear she should have paid more attention to us after making mistakes.  At least, we wanted to finish our dinner better because the restaurant is kids friendly.  Did I expect too much? I don't think so. I mean if they care.    I contacted managements later, and they emailed me to give us $200 credit we spent at that time on our next visit after mailing that I live in LA :(   We just wasted our money and they ruined our day.  It was the only one day I saw my child crying at dinner.",

    "text": "Great quality seafood and wagyu beef, but everything generally ran sweet, or very salty. We ordered the whole squid with Peruvian corn, yamato roll, sea bass skewer, and seared wagyu beef.  To start with my favorite, the wagyu was amazing. The jelly that it comes with on the side however was very salty, so use it sparingly. The yamato roll and sea bass skewer were both too sweet - I guess this could be part of the fusion thing, but it was really too sweet for my palate. The whole squid was very, very good, but also too salty.  I let the manager know that it was my boyfriend's birthday, and he came by at the end with mango ice cream pops and a candle! It was a yummy dessert to end with.",

I got the EL TOPO roll consisting of salmon, jalapeno, shiso leaf, red onion, fresh melted mozzerella, crispy onion. Also the BERKSHIRE PORK BELLY butterscotch miso which was sweet and melt in your mouth texture but cooked thoroughly. Little pricey and kind of dark in there but totally worth it!

To take the guess work out of trying to figure out what everyone wants, we went ahead with the $50 Omakase dinner.  Our waiter went around the table & asked all 8 of us our likes & dislikes so the chef can come up with our own custom menu. My favorite dishes of the night were the Grilled sea bass skewer & the A5 Kobe gyoza. To show the attentiveness of the restaurant: 1 of our friends cannot eat spicy food so she got her very own portion of filet mignon instead of the spicy beef skewers.  In additional to the delicious food & great service, we also got a round of pina colada & our bride-to-be got a beautiful chocolate dessert.  We had a wonderful dinner followed by a fun night of show watching, dancing, & boozing. Whether you are with a big group or only with a few good friends, this is a great place for a delicious & creative meal.",

All were excellent, and the Moqueca tasted authentic. Our waiter, Joe B, was friendly, helpful, knowledgable and attentive.  The only shortfall is the cramped seating. We were positioned in tight quarters between a couple obviously on their first date, and four very drunk people who had lost all sense of decorum. They spread out to the point they were intruding into our space, and we're very loud. If there had been some distance between tables, that would have equated to a much nicer dining experience.",

The type that makes you say \"I don't care how many calories this is, I would gladly get fat for you.\" Or, is that just me? Okay then.  My boyfriend and I visited Sushisamba on the suggestion of the concierge at the Wynn. We wanted something that was moderately priced for a nice dinner, but not too expensive, and something \"exotic\" - not American, Italian, or Mexican. We were looking for a unique dining experience without being too fancy. Sushisamba hit the nail on the head.  Our appetizer rainbow sushi was one of the most wonderful things I have ever eaten. We had potsticker-type pork deliciousness that I don't even know what it was called, and then we had a pork belly entree which we split. I realize that I am not being very specific about what we ate, because all I remember was how freaking good it is and my mouth is watering at the thought.  Our dessert.. oh my goodness, our dessert. Pumpkin donuts with a cream cheese glaze sauce. And it's not even Fall - this white girl was in heaven.  Sushisamba is a new favorite, and I hope it is a favorite for a very long time to come.",

We decided upon three of his recommendations.. the ribeye (seared to perfection) came out as a first course with a side of mushrooms on a steaming hot skillet. The juices in each were delicious and I could tell my family was blown away. The next course was the neo toyko roll, the lima roll, and a side of Peruvian corn. We were getting full but Michael surprised my aunt Mary with a Happy Birthday pop-rocks cake pop and a samba split to share. THANK YOU MICHAEL from the bottom of my heart.

There is a lot to choose from and it's nice to get a few different things to try.  Everyone at the table ordered different things including shrimp, chicken, duck, beef, soup, sushi etc etc etc.  There was not a complaint from anyone, not even the super foodies!   I had the yellowtail tiradito and it was an incredibly flavorful appetizer.   The Pacific roll with king crab, asian pear and a wasabi-avocado crema was excellent.  It was a generous size and it was different than your typical sushi offering.    I highly, highly, highly recommend the sea bass & miso skewers.  The texture is perfect and the flavor is spectacular!  Three of us ordered it and left not a crumb on our plates.  Takeaways?  Fast all day.  Go to Sushi Samba in the Venetian/Palazzo.  Drink fun drinks.  Order a la carte and enjoy the options.  Eat the sea bass or you are missing out.",

    "text": "Our first night in Vegas we decided to dine in the hotel we're staying in.  After reading up on the food literature left for us in our room and yelping every single one of the restaurants, I settled on Sushi Samba.. well.. because the pictures looked pretty.  This place is a trip.  The decor is out there and colourful.  It was interesting to just sit there and look around.    I can't remember exactly what we had but I'm still thinking about it.  There was peruvian corn which was something new to try.  Tough little things but still good.  We had some lamp that I actually didn't really care for because it had so much fat on it but the flavours were very nice because it was both sweet and salty.  We also had some kanapche tiradito and seared kobe beef and those two were the best I've ever had.    It was freakin expensive but I love the tapas style and they had the BEST COCKTAILS EVER.  Just when you feel that alcohol burn about to hit you, it doesn't.  It had enough alcohol that you wouldn't need 10 drinks to get a good buzz but it didn't have the burn and scrunchy face effect.  My hero.",

    "text": "The Sushi Samba in Miami is much better than the LV location all because of the quality of the fish.  Sushi Samba Las Vegas had the WORST fish for their taradito. We had the combination platter and the fish was FISHY and TOUGH. We also paid $12 a piece for their Toro (fatty tuna) and it was so tough we needed a knife to cut it. The strings of fat in the tuna were like steak gristle - gross! Our Kampachi was also extremely tough. When we asked our waiter about it, he said it was supposed to be like that? NO WAY!  Their miso sea bass was really really good but after eating tough fishy fish, my appetite was gone.  I know Vegas is far from the ocean, but come on!!! Don't charge $12 a piece for Toro and then insist that you aren't supposed to be able to cut it with a butter knife.  Will stick to the Miami location! Much more lively, bright and yummy.",

    "text": "When my boyfriend proposed dinner at SUSHISAMBA I wasn't 100% sure what to expect. Naturally, I immediately assumed it was sushi with a bit of a twist, but I didn't really expect the menu they had in store! They offered a very cool Japanese, Peruvian and Brazilian fusion (not your everyday mash-up!) and everything was executed brilliantly. I was a touch put off at the outset when the waiter told us that he could create a dinner experience FOR US without much of our input. After finding out about food allergies, dietary restrictions, etc. he gave us a ballpark of about $50 - $60 per person and took it from there. We, quite literally, ordered NOTHING off of the menu - everything that we ate was something that our waiter thought would be a hit for us. While I was skeptical, it actually worked out well! He brought us some amazing dishes (the corn that accompanies the sea bass is insanely good and the ahi tacos were stellar) though we could have probably done with a couple fewer dishes. We left absolutely stuffed and very impressed.   I'm sure we could have kept it under $100 (not including drinks) if we were to order on our own (we got a LOT of food, including a few orders that probably wouldn't have been on our agenda), but if you're okay with the price range laid out, they do know their stuff! All around good experience. I would go again, but now that we've tried quite a few things, I would prefer to place my own order. :)",

    "text": "Eh, this place was ok.  We made a reservation for 7:15 and got seated after a few minutes. The tables were kind of close together which wasn't so cool. It was really loud and dark and kind of hard to hear my friend talking from 2 feet away. The people next to us were only about 3-4 feet next to us.  The waitress was ok. I ordered a beer, which I had to ask for twice because I didn't get it after about 10 minutes. She messed up our sushi order, then told us we were wrong and that it wasn't what we asked for, and then went back and saw that we were actually right the entire time. It was really busy, but still not an excuse. The guys sitting next to us had tickets to a show at 9 and walked in around 7:45 and they were raving about how good the food was and how quickly it was getting served. Good for them I guess, but our service was still slow. We left at around 8:45 and they still hadn't gotten their bill.  The sushi was just kind of meh. I think it was overpriced and didn't reach our expectations for a place like the Palazzo. We could have gone to a place like RA Sushi and gotten better sushi for a much cheaper price. We probably won't go back.",

    "text": "The food: If you're going here, you might as well splurge like you already are. Order the Ishi Yaki - it's at least $150 worth of Wagyu beef that you'll season and toss on your own hot-stone, leaving it to cook to your liking. You may also offend your neighbors: they'll envy your plate, but they may also not like how the smoke is incidentally wafted in their direction by the vents.   The wild Mushroom Toban-Yaki is on the salty side. The Tiger Shrimp Tempura is more than enough for 2 people despite being labeled as a small plate - loved it. I didn't like the Lobster Taquitos because of the lemongrass and ginger. The Watermelon Mojo beverage had too much mint for my liking. I'll be back to try out other dishes!  The service: I'm also not typically a fan of Asian cuisine, but I definitely enjoyed most of everything else that was ordered. I appreciate the waiter serving my table for making recommendations (and yes, up-selling). They definitely came by to check on us very often.  Lucky side note:  I think I've decided on going to SushiSamba during their slow times: right after the holidays and before New Years Eve. It sounds like this place is less hectic during this time frame. Even so, I managed to have a piece of plastic flung my direction during dinner. I thought I had been drinking too much, or a part of the restaurant's decor had started to deteriorate but nope - it was a patron's credit card that somehow flew out of one's hand and landed behind my seat cushion and the wall lighting/backrest. They nearly had the whole place turned upside down trying to find the thing. My date and I should have taken this luck to go gambling afterwards.",

    "text": "Pain in the Tanis!  We ate here a few nights ago and absolutely hated it, mostly thanks to our terrible server, Tanis.  She refused to bring us any menus and assured us she would customize a meal for us that we would love... I left hungry.  There were 6 of us total, 2 of us don't eat any fish.  We told her that in the beginning when she was refusing to bring out menus.  For our second course, she brought out raw fish for the fish eaters and cooked fish for the non fish eaters... wtf?  I waited around 15 minutes for her to come by again so I could get something different to eat.  When I was finally able to flag her down, I asked if the two non fish eaters could get something non fish, to which she replied, \"I brought out two extra fish dishes for everyone else.  There's nothing you can eat for this round.\"  That's obviously terrible customer service.  She could've brought us out another two mediocre kobe mini tacos like she brought for us the first round, but she obviously doesn't care about her customers experience in her restaurant.  I had also ordered a drink from her which I suspect she intentionally forgot since she knew I was upset with her, it was her way of getting back at me.  When I complained about it to my friend she conveniently was able to hear me that time and asked, \"Was there something about another drink?\"  I told her I didn't want anymore drinks from her because I was not going to play her little immature, power games.  So instead I left the restaurant and walked to a nearby bar, came back to the restaurant and finished my drink there so that she wouldn't get anymore of my money.  Tanis is the worst waitress I have every come across in my entire life, and that's just after a trip to London, the city of zero customer service.  If Tanis doesn't like serving people, maybe she should look for a new job?  Thanks for the memories Tanis, I can't wait for you to see this!  :)",

    "text": "We got there around 6:30pm just in time for happy hour and the bar was still pretty packed. We waited a couple of minutes till there were 2 seats available. We really shouldn't have bothered to wait... We asked the bartender for happy hour menus and then we ordered a mojito and a caipirinha. My friend loves mojitos, I don't care for them. He said these were the worse he's ever had. The mojito was slightly better than the caipirinha, but not by much. It practically tasted the same. We also ordered the Berry Smash and the Samba Juice which actually looked and tasted quite similar except that the Berry Smash has no alcohol! None of these drinks were very strong, nor tasted good. For around $12-$15 a drink, it really should've be made by a professional. We went to Craftsteak the night before and the drinks there were fantastic. The bartenders @ Sushi Samba are pretty, but they don't know how to make a decent cocktail. However, it's not all their fault since they were using mostly mixers and not premium alcohol/fresh ingredients unlike other upscale bars/restaurants.   We also had some apps with our drinks.  Apps: Spicy Tuna Roll, Yellowtail Seviche and Crispy Yellowtail Taquitos.   For a Friday night, their sushi was clearly not very fresh. The spicy tuna was okay, the spicy sauce that was placed on top instead of mixed with the tuna hid whatever flavor the tuna had. I didn't like the yellowtail seviche, but my friend thought it was okay. I thought it was too bitter from the lime. The worse thing out of this whole experience were the yellowtail taquitos. The fish tasted spoiled. My friend was sick all night. It could've been the ridiculous amount of alcohol we consumed that night since we went to Dos Caminos later that night, but my friend says it was definitely the yellowtail taquitos... The drinks at Dos Caminos are so much better than Sushi Samba's... the mojitos are strong and freshly made and the glasses are 2x the size :P",

    "text": "The prices at Sushi Samba are jaw-dropping. Our family had 3 kids and 5 adults and we spent about $1,000 after all was said and done. All I can say is thank goodness somebody else was treating!  The food was pretty darn good and the drinks were well prepared. The decor inside the restaurant is distinctive and a real pleasure to enjoy. The only drawback is that it was really dark, so it was more difficult to really take it all in. They also have a video playing on a projector that is good at setting the mood for the cuisine - Brazilian steakhouse meets Japanese sushi meets other stuff - but is sort of odd without sound and just like 1-2 second flashes of stuff. It reminded me too much of Clockwork Orange only without the taped open eyes.  The service is excellent at Sushi Samba as they go out of their way to make sure that you have everything and that all messes, etc. are cleaned up. I'd say that they had about 7 staff members doting on our table and it was a nearly full house.  Sushi Samba is one of those places that I would recommend visiting if somebody else was paying. No way that my cheap sensibilities would allow me to break out $1,000 for meal!",

    "text": "Thursday Night. 9pm.  Our reservations were honored to the minute and the man who runs the show, Mike Durovsik, at once made us feel not just like welcomed guests but old friends.  My Fiance and I were indulged with a 9 course specialized server's Omakase. The food was superb, and the service exceeds even the best definitions of accommodating.   Our charming and attentive server asked immediately how adventurous we were willing to get, and since we had no objections to anything particular, our meal immediately commenced.  First was the Otsumami, three small dishes: Green Bean Tempura with a creamy truffle aoli dipping sauce (Incredible), shishito peppers charcoal grilled and just the right amount of spicy, as well as edamame sprinkled with sea salt.  Next came Hamachi (Yellowtail) Tacos paired with a fizzing sort of vinegarette (Spicy Aji Panca) on the side to top it off- This was filled with so much flavour It literally forced my eyes to roll back. A real Treat that I'd highly  reccommend.  At this point it was quite apparent that service and timing was top notch. The bottle of sake we brought was being chilled tableside and water never fell below the 2/3rds mark. As the bottle chilled we tasted two different cocktails-  Kumori, a cucumber cocktail with shochu and nigori which was refreshing, easy, and delicious.  Alongside was the ever popular Nina Fresa, a strawberry cocktail with vodka. Both made for easy, yet yummy drinking.  Their Mushroom Toban Yaki was divinely creamy- we got ours with Bincho Tan grilled Lamb on top which paired quite nicely with those garlic chips. Their were five different kinds of perfectly cooked mushrooms in the mix, and all around it made for a unique filling appetizer. My fiances words: That fu**ing amazing lamb dish ;)  The Sashimi Tiradito I'm always raving about came next. Still on a midblowing level, I noticed that their are different flavour notes (though served with the same ingredients) for the NYC location and the Las Vegas one. So if you think you've had it before, you haven't. Though different, the fish is always immensely fresh and the taste accents are truly wonderful. My favorite is the Kanpachi since I'm a sucker for Yuzu (Japanese citrus) and My fiance was a big fan of the Hamachi- If you're torn, go with the assortment of all four and you won't have any regrets.  Off the Robata Grill (Bincho Tan Charcoal) came the most decadant Crab Leg imaginable- our taste buds were literally in shock from the Mastermind Talents of Chef Oscar Toro. Bedded atop rock salt, the crab was creamy, fell apart smoothly, and the flavours enhanced the entire piece of already fresh seafood. A seasonal dish that may not always be available... So wonderful. If they don't have it on menu, go for the Spiny Lobster.  Also from from the Robata Grill we enjoyed The Miso Glazed Sea Bass with baby corn. Again, this dish can be done so many different ways at different high end Japanese restaurants- but Sushi Samba's brazillian take really heightens the tastes.  Ask for the freshest oysters of the day- you can go with traditional serving, paired with Yuzu Jelly and lemon, or a more contemporary take which Chef Oscar Toro will create specially for that oyster.- Both ways are unforgettable.  My absolute favorite dish is the KOBE ISHIYAKI. You grill fresh pieces of perfectly marbleized Kobe tableside 3-5 seconds on each side on an extremely hot River Stone. You get 4-5 sauces and and array of salts to mix up the taste buds for you- Absolutely the most decadently delicious dish. Whenever I see this I must have it, and Sushi Samba's is THE BEST I've had. Not enough people indulge in this and you Must must must!!!   Our Sushi/Sashimi platter was fresh and wonderful- exquisite. We got the Neo Tokyo and the El Topo rolls- Neo Tokyo has tuna and a bit of spicy to it, and the El Topo is served warm- a surprising aspect, but the melted mozzarella is such a unique addition. It's like the movie \"El Topo\" you must try/ see both!   For dessert we went with Mochi; a soft and chewy Japanese dessert that is traditionally not overly sweet. Sushi Samba adds ice cream to the center and offers all the best flavours.   By the end of our meal and a finished bottle of Sake, we were both more than pleasantly buzzed and satiated with an incredible meal.   ************** Bottom line, if you are trying to decide between Nobu and Sushi Samba, Pass on Nobu and put some Samba in your Seafood!!  Thank you again Mike and Oscar for such a wonderful Night!!",

    "text": "I've been to Sushi Samba twice now and it is now, one of my favorite sushi/brazilian fusion joints in Las Vegas.   The first time, we splurged on a 9-course omakase that included kobe beef cooked on a rock and various delicious & well-crafted dishes. As a sushi lover, I only eat fresh, perfectly cut fish and Sushi samba has this side down.  I also LOVE their children's menu which includes the cutest bento boxes. Both salmon & chicken are good and its arrangement of fruit skewers and ice cream sundae topped with krackle pop candy (?) is amazing. My family love to dine out with kids and this place by far, has the best children's menu for reasonable price.  The second time we got the sushi/sashimi boat and three-meat dish. Meat was good and sauces were once again, excellent. I really enjoy sushi/brazilian fusion because it nicely satisfies my entire palette.   Mango mojito was good and reasonably priced but I made a mistake of letting the waiter choose our bottle of sake which turned out to be nearly $125 per bottle. Sake was very smooth but our entire meal came out to over $500 which I believe, is too high for fusion/sushi. But again, the Kobe beef and excellent sake made up for the price but next time, I'll be more careful when letting them choose my drink.   Overall, Sushi samba is a great joint if you want to enjoy a night out with friends and family with good sushi & unique fusion dishes. However, be prepared to spend some $$ or you might be unpleasantly surprised. :)",

She hunted down off-menu Nigori Mura (aka The Sake Milkshake), and eclectic-sized our Samba Strip and Neo Tokyo rolls because we like a drop kick in our aguacate culture. Gochisosama.  BIG Japanese bows & Brazilian butt jiggles also for:  -Yellow Tail Taquitos -Peru's corn kernels (my people call it maize)   -Tataki Skewers - No Blue Fin Tuna until they won't be extinct.   We vote they also \"Pass on the Sea Bass\" which is also over-fished.  ( I blame these species for being so tastey.  Why do they tempt me?  My flesh is weak.)  Special thanks to Hayes for getting la cuenta put on my room and the Ranchera banda in the back.  Hayes puts the eclectic in eclectricity!",

She saw the confused look on our face and said \"let me know your preferences, your budget and I'll put together a menu for you\".  We all agreed that was the way to go.  She picked a GREAT combination of appetizers, sides and entrees for us to try along with a large plate of sushi.  We were all impressed with the food choose and were very happy with her selections.   Here are some highlights of the dishes we tried....  The sashimi taquitos.  Lightly friend corn tortilla stuffed with various sashimi with a great salsa. The pork gyoza with a sweet pumpkin sauce.  FRICKEN DELICIOUS! Skewered sea bass marinaded in miso.  YUM  Those are just a few dishes that stood out for me.  Definitely will be back.",

We made a reservation and were really looking forward to some great sushi.  We ordered edamame to start with, the Samba Sushi Chef's Selection and a dragon roll.  The waitress recommended we get more, even though we had already run through the menu with her and settled on what we would be ordering.  The edamame arrived, and seriously 30 seconds later all the sushi made its way to the table.  We maybe spent 30 total minutes at the restaurant.  It was a overall a really unfortunate experience, and had it not been for the food, it would have been truly awful.",

You pick the amount you want to spend and then tell the waiter what kind of flavors you like. For the most part, we left it up to the waiter to choose our dishes. We started off with sushi before we got to any of the other dishes. The sushi itself was nothing amazing. Honestly, it was kind of disappointing. The other dishes however, were fantastic. If you're in a rush, this is not the place for you. The food comes one by one so and the server/host takes his time explaining each and every ingredient that goes into everything. The ambiance is nice though. Very chill with a good crowd and relaxing music. A great place to stop by for dinner with friends.",

The shrimp seviche stands out. It was delicious, very tasty and very clean. The asparagus was very tasty too.  So, after coming here a few times a week for a few weeks we show up and ask for the happy hour menu. They proceed to tell us that since a convention is in town, they are not offering it! WHAAAAAAAAT? I'm a local, I come here (somewhat) often, and I'm being punished because you have an opportunity to take advantage of out of towners! That reaaaaaaallllly rubbed me the wrong way. So, down from 4 stars to 3 stars. If you are an out of towner, you wouldn't know. But if you are a local, then it's really disappointing to treat locals that way.",

But it was good.  We got a $55 tasting menu that had a lot of unique dishes that weren't too exotic.  I can appreciate fusion places that don't try to go over the top with exoticness.  Everything was pretty solid: sea bass, hamachi, duck, baby crabs, rolls.  It was definitely also more filling than I expected.  They brought out the platter of rolls last as filler and we were struggling to finish.  Also, there was a table with 3 playboy models sitting next to us which never hurts.  I got all of them to take a picture with the bachelor (with permission from their  husbands who happened to be really cool).  So a success all in all.",

    "text": "Wish I could give this place a 5 because the food is delicious, but unfortunately because of the lousy service I have to give it 3 stars. Went to this restaurant with a few girlfriends on a trip to Vegas. SUPER Excited to enjoy a great sushi meal with people that LOVE sushi. Instead we were greeted by a server, name to be disclosed, who was degrading, rude, and treated us like cheap girls.   One of our friends requested for a carafe of hot sake and this server immediately said that this restaurant was too high class to have any sort of hot sake. Who was this guy? How does he not know that we're just girls who enjoy drinking hot sake from time to time-this server needs to learn some MAJOR restaurant etiquette! As the night progressed, the service did not get any better. I've been to MANY wonderful restaurants in Vegas where the food was great and the service EVEN better and this restaurant definitely put the standard of Vegas restaurants in the low range. Fortunately the manager hooked my friends and i with some shots that were delicious - one of them included cucumber and was fresh and cool to the taste.   On the positive note, the food was ridiculously delicious (hoping there wasn't any extra protein hidden in it). The Sashimi dishes with granny apple sauce and another with some sort of lemon grass sauce was soo good! The Chilean Sea Bass was delectable and probably the best dish on the menu.   I always believe that Las Vegas has the best places to eat, this restaurant may be one of them, but I will never go there again unless i confirm that this server is not serving my table. And if anyone from this restaurant is reading this...never underestimate your customers!",

    "text": "There are plenty of sushi restaurants to choose from in Las Vegas, but if you're in the mood for something unique and different, try Sushi Samba.  It looks like a funky nightclub at first glance, but venture inside and you'll find a lively restaurant with an eclectic atmosphere and friendly service.  If you're looking for a quiet, romantic dinner, this probably isn't your place.  Start out with a drink.  The sake list is long and distinguished, sure to satisfy even the most discerning sake drinker.  And if sake is not your thing, they have great signature drinks. Try the Yemenja (vodka, ginger liqueur, lemongrass and mint).  Time to eat!  You'll discover the menu is just as eclectic as the ambience, fusing Japanese, Brazilian and Peruvian cuisine.  If you want sushi, they have sushi.  Or if you prefer Brazilian BBQ, they have Churrasco.  But it's the smaller more distinct plates that make this place great.   The miso-glazed seabass skewers are a MUST, served with large kernel Peruvian corn, they're \"melt in your mouth\" good.  Also, the Samba Strip roll (lobster, mango, peanut curry) will knock your socks off.  One could return to this spot several times and still not try everything on the menu. In fact, I recommend bringing a large group of friends so that you can sample more of the many delights Sushi Samba has to offer.",

I will definitely go to Sushi Samba every time we go to Vegas.    We made reservations for 9 ppl and was seated right away as soon as everyone arrived.  The waiter, Max came by quickly and introduced himself and suggested we do a prefix menu (that he picks out based on a few questions he asked our group). He brought us our drinks and chatted with the table, since it was someone's bday at the table, he also bought us a round of shots.  Liza then came by and introduced herself to the table and asked if everything was good and wish \"happy birthday\" to the birthday boy.  Max and Liza came by our table multiple times to make sure our group was having the best time. Toward the end of the night, the table next to us started cheering, so our table started to cheers with them, which caused the whole restaurant to cheers (this continue to happen 5 times later throughout the night).  So my advise is that this restaurant could be very loud at times depending on the groups there.   On to the food: it's AMAZING!!! the sea bass was delicious and the meat entree was very good too.  The sushi was very fresh and tasty and they had this roll w/ melted mozzarella cheese, weird combo but it worked - it was probably my favorite roll on the sushi plate. The prefix menu cost about $60/ppl which isn't too bad and we had a lot of food left over. The shots that Max got us was awesome, I forgot what it had but I remember one key ingredient, which was cucumber.   The service and food is GREAT. Definitely a place to try if you're in a big group, make reservations just in case, because the restaurant does get packed.",

They have this thing with sauces that you dunk some of your sushi in which is simply out of this world.  The service and attention to detail is simply impeccable and worth every penny.  If you do not like crowds and long long waits, go during lunch when it is quiet.  The decor is really nice and inviting. Cozy, even romantic.   Definitely try the tasting menu. Somewhat dressy.

    "text": "This restaurant is a chain and was pretty good.  Being a girls weekend away from home, we started off with their cocktail tree which is $70, but totally worth it! Then we ordered Otsumami which is an assortment of edamame, green bean tempura, and shishito which was really good. Their aioli sauce had a hint of truffles and a strong garlic taste but wasn't too over powering and made it really good with the green bean tempura.  After that we had the Rock Shrimp Tempura that had bibb lettuce, tobanjan alioli, black truffle vinaigrette and in my opinion was only average. For my entree I had the Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass and that was really, really good. Very moist, tender, juicy and not fishy at all. It's everything you could wish your fish to be. The portion was a little small, but it was oh, so good!! I also had the Samba strip Roll which had maine lobster, mango, tomato, chive, crispy rice, soy paper, peanut curry and i thought it was alright. But for the price and how much lobster they gave us, it was really worth it.  the last thing i had was their Neo Tokyo roll that had yellowfin tuna, tempura flake, aji panca, which is also really good.   My overall experience was only a 3 stars because they said they were really busy that night (but didn't look that way to me because there were at least 5 empty tables in front of us) and they sat us in a corner and our waiter was a complete douche and couldn't get our order right nor could he remember what we ordered and came back on several occasions to reconfirm what we ordered. The manager there was also dumb and tried to help out only to make things worse because he asked us what we wanted to drink and didn't even bring our drinks and completely forgot about us.   In the end, I'd come back cause the food was good, but hopefully i'll get better service next time.",

But we were wandering around the Venetian/Palazzo and we decided to go for it. What a pleasant suprise...everything was outstanding. There is nothing more fun than ordering a bunch of small plates and trying different things...which is why I love places like this and Julian Serrano...different cuisine...same concept. The aja sauce they give you for the lobster tacquitos is SLAM BANG delicious, the seared kobe small plate was A-ONE, everything else was great also...shrimp tempura, salt and pepper squid, oysters, foie/kobe roll with caviar and gold leaf was actually the weakest dish...I got it just because of the novelty aspect really.",

We ordered the Teriyaki Chicken, 3 Meat Entree, with some nigiri on the side. Although, the Teri Chicken and Nigiri portions were small, the 3 Meat Entree made up for it. The steaks couldn't have been cooked any better. The Teri Chicken was average and I've had better sushi.  The service was on point. Our waitress checked on us numerous times and kept our glasses filled.  Nice place to grub before a night out.",

I recommend the Taquittos which were just outstanding and the seabass skewers. I dont really eat cooked fish i just dont care for the taste but this didnt taste like anything i have ever had. The staff was super nice and helpful, but it seems really chaotic and the place wasn't THAT busy. Either way they gave us a free roll for the mistake, figured it was the one thing we didnt like! The sashimi and spicy tuna hand roll were amazing! We also had the ribeye steak with veggie mushroom goodness pot which was incredible! I would recommend everyone coming to vegas to eat here. I can't wait to try to place back east to see if its the same. Thanks Sushi Samba for everything!",

I came here for weekday lunch with two friends and it's quite empty BUT DON'T LET THAT DETER YOU FROM EATING HERE AT ALL! Do make a reservation just in case!   The unique ambiance that makes the restaurant look deceptively larger than it is has cozy booths to sit in as we deciphered which choices on the menu to select (because unfortunately we couldn't have everything... even though we literally wanted EVERYTHING).  Order everything I state here. For real.  JAPANESE A5 WAGYU BEEF GYOZA (ALL GYOZA SHOULD BE THIS INTERESTINGLY GYOZAWESOME) TUNA TATAKI (BEST BITES OF TUNA I'VE EVER HAD) BLUE POINT OYSTERS (MAXIMIZE THE APHRODISIACS WHILE YOU ARE IN VEGAS) DUCK BREAST (CAN I GET A QUACK QUACK?!) DESSERT... GET THE BANANA SPLIT (THEIR DECONSTRUCTED VERSION IS EXTREMELY WELL CONSTRUCTED).

Had an 8:30 reservation and got there around 8:15. They didnt have tables available so I offered to sit at the bar since I was by myself. Ordered a drink (it was good) and started off with the Beef Potstickers. The beef was tough and they dish could have been better if they wouldnt have smothered the whole plate in this pink sauce that was sweet and spicy. I wanted to TASTE the beef and the potsticker, not to mention that the potsticker was falling apart. I decided to try their sushis. So I ordered spicy tuna, who can mess that BASIC roll up? Well SushiSamba managed to mess it up! Tuna was tough, not melt in your mouth, and it also had NO spiciness to it. Size was awkard, not small but really deep.I decided to give them One last chance and ordered their skewers with choclo. THE PINK NASTY SAUCE WAS BACK! They used the same sauce that ruined my potstickers to ruin my chicken.   Either way it was $100 wasted in a bad meal.",

I'm very happy to say we had a great experience from beginning to end!  We made reservations a week in advance knowing Vegas would be filled to the brim for New Year's, and we were glad we did!  It was crowded but we were seated promptly, and since we had a big party we got to sit in the back section and it was very roomy and comfortable.  Our waiter suggested omakase (family style) where you can set any price point everyone was comfortable with.  We set $60 a person (without drinks) and the food just kept on coming!  Most of the dishes were a hit, some was a miss but that's easily forgiven with the sheer amount of food they give you.  The rock shrimp, curry/mushroom/duck dish, sashimi, rolls and sea bass were sooo good!  At one point there was a lag between the dishes and our waiter was nice enough to bring some dishes out on the house, and also gave us a free dessert!  SO nice!  If you're staying at Palazzo/Venetian and don't want to venture out into the strip for a nice, upscale delicious restaurant, give Sushi Samba a try! :)",

    "text": "Celebrated a friend's 40th bday here.  Service was good and the hosts friendly.  We were asked how much we wanted to spend, and we said about $50 pp (with tax and drinks, though, it came to be over $90 for those who ordered drinks and $80 for those who didn't).  They do their best to keep under or at your budget - and they did!  It's kinda cool bc they will add an extra piece of two depending on the size of your party and prorate the piece.  No more having to cut pieces because there's only four items and six people.  However, I thought it was lame that I told them I was allergic to shrimp and they still brought out a dish with shrimp!  They asked what allergies we had, so I would assume when they do that, they will try to avoid bringing out anything with those items.  What's the point in asking what your allergies are if you don't adhere to them??  I should have asked to return it or taken off the bill - according to an email exchange with someone when reserving a table, it said we could return any dish we didn't enjoy.  The dish was good, but again, don't serve things people are allergic to after being told.  Anyway, most of the food was good, though there were a few misses.  We started with some tempura fried green beans and edamame - something we probably wouldn't have normally ordered since it seemed like filler food.  We all loved the scallop wrapped in what looked like a fried bird's nest.  So good.  The waguy dumplings were good but something we could have skipped.  Also, another favorite was the Sea Bass and Peruvian corn - omg that was so delicious.  I could have eaten way more of that plate.  The Peruvian corn kernels were really large and sweet.  The Tuna Tacos were another favorite.  We didn't like the Beef and Mushroom pot so much - had a strong coconut flavor, which I'm not a fan of.  We also got a plate of sushi, three different kinds.  One was good, but the rest were okay.  The Banana Boat dessert, though nice, wasn't that good.  We probably would have skipped it.  It was basically pieces of banana with torched sugar on top and ice cream, etc.    Drinks are expensive but really good here.  I recommend ordering the Samba one was way better than mine, and in a really large glass!  It was fruity and fresh, and there was definitely alcohol in it.  I might go back one day if I win some money, but I'll prob stick to ordering the dishes myself.  Overall, the food was pretty good, but the price is pretty expensive for what you get.  I had expected a little more, I guess.",

    "text": "My boyfriend took me and another couple here for this past valentines day.   It was super empty at 8:30 pm on valentines night which I thought was really weird.   I'll start off by saying service was impeccable. Even the manager came over to check on us and wish us a happy valentines day and even chatted it up with us for a little while. He even brought some kind of champagne with strawberries for us at the end of our dinner. I believe his name was Jeremy so if I'm correct....then thanks Jeremy you definitely made our experience a good one. Kudos to Philip our waiter as well. He dealt with our drunk asses throughout the entire dinner and provided amazing service at the same time.   We ordered an order of the wagyu gyoza to try. Yeh we ended up ordering another 4 orders right away. I think that might give you a good idea of just how amazing this dish is. I can guarantee you won't be disappointed with it. Then we got the churrasco with like 3 or 4 different meats that came with 3 different sauces. If you've got money to spend then I definitely suggest getting this dish. The spicy tuna hand roll with spicy mayo on top was also AMAZING. Hands down the best spicy tuna hand roll I've ever had.   The two downsides to this place and the reason I took off one star is because of how pricy this place is for the amount of food they give you and the fact that their bathroom had absolutely no lights. I literally couldn't see where I was or what I was doing the entire time I was in the stall.   Overall if I have a lot or extra cash to spend then I will most definitely be back for the great service and especially another helping of the wagyu gyoza and spicy tuna hand roll.",

    "text": "We stayed at Palazzo over the holidays and decided to try out this place.  I had made reservations for 9pm but arrived about 20mins early and was seated right away.  Overall a decent experience. Ambience:  Dark and somewhat trendy sushi fusion joint.  There is a bar area but the rest of the tables are set up in a funky circular fashion.  Tables are pretty close to each other and you will not have a private dining experience.   Service:  For the most part good.  We were seated right away.  It did take a while for the server to get to us (and she apologized).  She didn't give us the Sushi Samba intro like I heard another server give the table next to us (explaining the whole fusion thing).  Orders were taken and things proceeded to go smoothly.  There were no mistakes on our order.  We asked for sake recommendations and she appeared really knowledgeable.  She was decent in explaining their omikase (pretty much no set omikase).  Food came out at a decent pace.  Water was refilled quite nicely too. Food:  Past review said that this was a great sushi place.  I disagree.  If you want the best sushi, you don't go to a fusion place in Vegas for it.  If you want to try a different twist on japanese/brazillian cuisine, then this is the place. So I went here without much expectations.  Highlights included the Yellowtail taquitos (more like tacos).  I loved the sauce/foam that came with it.  Very light and a nice way to wet your appetite.  Sea bass and Lamb Robata (sp?) were both really really good.  There was a sweet sauce on both.  Sea bass melted in your mouth.  Came with 2 skewers.  The lamb was a decent size and was sliced thinly.  This was also a melt-in-your mouth experience.  I would order both again. We had one of their specials which was a white fish in a tofu sauce.  It was just ok.  We made the mistake of ordering a roll.  I think it was an El Toro (or something like that) and it came with salmon, cilantro, mozerella cheese, among other things.  The flavor was ok, but the rice in the roll itself was really hard.  Like they had premade it.  Made the whole roll just awful.  I like their sake selection.  We passed on dessert. Value:  Just like vegas, things are pricier. But I thought the vibe was decent.    All in all, a decent date night place.  Just don't come expecting over the top sushi.",

Other than that, we definitely enjoyed our experience at Sushisamba.",

From sashimi plates to their truffle shavings on ribeye, everything was delicious and beautifully presented. The seating was comfortable, atmosphere trendy for a 78 year old's birthday, but he was more interested in the food than anything.  I'd definitely come back here again for all the food, especially their wagyu gyoza and lobster roll.",

We also tried the Salt and Pepper Squid, Sao Paulo roll (it's smaller than what you would typically see at other sushi restaurants, but don't be fooled, it is jam packed with the wow factor with flavor), and a few hand rolls.   Next to us, there was a couple eating the Ischiyaki with Wagyu that you cook on top of a hot stone and dip into specialty sauces. It smelled divine! Free smells for those of us that can't dine like ballers. Don't be deterred, everything else is yummy too!",

I had a horrible experience here on the one night my friends and I had reunion dinner together in Vegas. THE ONE NIGHT WE WERE ALL TOGETHER.   - Everything was really salty, and we had to send back one of our dishes because we couldn't eat it.  - The menu was limited in terms of sushi, despite their moniker. Should have been a red flag there.  - We waited at least 10 mins for anything we asked for (twice!). It was a waste of our time considering we were in Vegas and of the three hours we spent at the restaurant, 2 of them was just us waiting for water, napkins,  bowls,  the check, and the manager. - When we asked for the check, no one came to our table to give it to us for another 10 min. Not only that, they never updated the check so we had to go up to one of the computers and ask the server for another check.  - Eventually we asked for the manager, and they told us if we stay there, they'll bring him out. So we stood to the side and waited. But after about 20 min of waiting (again), the same server came up to us and asked if we wanted to see the manager. He told us that manager wasn't coming but he'll grab him.   This was a ridiculous experience, and I would never recommend this restaurant to anything of my friends.",

And they were able to adjust to 6 gyoza instead of 5 so we could each have 2- love the accommodating-ness of this place!  -Miso marinated sea bass skewers with corn-  the fish was so so tender and deliciously flavored.  Such a treat!! The corn was really great too!  -The grilled asparagus was insanely good!  Could eat that every day!!   The edamame was totally standard and what you expect.  Same with the side salad- tasty and fresh, but not memorable.  We also had the rock shrimp, and while it was good, I think other places do a better job of their equivalent dishes (tempura shrimp in a spicy mayo sauce).  The tempura was a little soggy, the sauce needed a bit more punch, and we needed more sauce in general.  This is the only dish I would swap for something else if I went back (and hey, maybe that dish was just having an off day)..:  We left so so full after this awesome meal-- great service, great food, and would highly recommend!",

    "text": "Wow, what do I say?  This place blew us out of the water.   I'd gotten recommendations to dine here if I ever visited Vegas. Those people are on top of their food game. (Looking at you AJ)   Sometimes, places are hyped up and I end up having a disappointing meal, even if it was good. This place was not that.  Our server, Jeff, was friggen awesome. He was so friendly and informative. He really knew his stuff and he didn't give us any pressure. Super attentive also, he came around like 3 times while we were going over the menu to see if we needed help. We ended up going with an omakase style of ordering. We gave him a budget of $80pp and told him our must haves and to just wing the rest. He did an excellent job.  Notable dishes: JAPANESE A5 WAGYU BEEF GYOZA  - when this dish came out, I was a bit underwhelmed. It just looked like bland dumplings on a plate, but the texture and taste of this was just amazing. It was melt in your mouth, different textured, simple but tasty flavours. I would definitely have more of this.  ASSORTED SASHIMI & ROLLS - The fish was really fresh here. Any of the sashimi would be a good choice. I can't remember what rolls we got, but they were generally really good. There was one that was a bit bland and I believe it was shrimp inside.   DUCK BREAST - Okay, so.. no joke. This dish ruined mushrooms and duck for me. After our table had this, we couldn't stop raving about it. My mouth is watering just thinking about it right now. A whole duck breast, skin and fat on, seared a perfect medium rare, served on a bed of assorted mushrooms in an asian liqour sauce. Holy moly my, this was SO GOOD. Definitely the best thing we had all night.  So, given that our budget we gave was $80pp, it came up to around $115pp after tax and tip (and we gave a generous tip), and this included a dessert platter (which was delicious as well) and a beer each too.   This is a definite must in Vegas! 6 stars if I could.",

Although I had loved the sharing menu that was designed for me for $60 then, I decided to ask the waitress what her favorites were this time around and I am glad I trusted her. Although we tried 5 dishes total there were two that really stood out.  The Japanese Wagyu beef gyoza with kabocha puree and su-shoyu dipping sauce was an excellent choice as a starter. The main attraction was the Ishiyaki hot stone, with dipping sauces was terrific. This dish was definitely on the pricey side so be prepared to pay a premium price.  I knocked off one star due to the tightness of the tables. It's so tight that's it's impossible to have a private conversation and it's tough getting in and out from the side of the table. Although this will not deter to me from revisiting.   Thank you for an excellent creative menu and being a must go for sushi lovers.",

We arrived a little early for our reservation and was seated immediately.  My cousin told the waiter what we liked and didn't like.  He said he would create a meal according to what we wanted.  Everything was fantastic.  Below is what we had and its description:  Pork Gyozo-  Each dumpling was served on a delicious pumpkin puree.  Delicious!  Sushi Platter- We got 5 different types of rolls, 2 of each type.  They were all so good.    Tiger Rock Shrimp- Yum!  If you like honey walnut shrimp then you will definitely like this.  It was perfectly made.    Yellowtail Ceviche tacos- These were the best tacos I have ever had.  The sauce it came with was a yummy spicy foam hot sauce.  They were small but definitely satisfying.  They just melt in your mouth.  So good!  Probably my favorite thing there.    Steak- The Steak was served with collard greens, potatoes, rice, and black beans.  It also came out with 3 different sauces that were all so good.  The green sauce was my favorite.    Seabass on Skewers- This was served with some Peruvian corn.  The seabass just melts in your mouth.  They were perfectly made.  The corn was also really good and went perfectly with the seabass.       Shots- Our shots came out beautifully presented on a shot tier.  Two of us didn't drink so our waiter brought out two that were watermelon juice so we could join in on toasting.      Dessert- Dessert was a mix of the best vanilla ice cream, creme burlee, mixed berries, and banana.  It was nicely made and topped off with some sparklers.    Everything was so tasty and beautifully presented.  The food wasn't just all Japanese.  It was definitely a fusion but everything went together wonderfully.  I think for us 8 girls it was about $75 each.  It was very worth it and we all left stuffed and happy.        Our server took care of us really well.  I liked that he noted there were 8 of us and made the portions perfect for 8 girls.  One of our girls couldn't eat raw fish or anything spicy and he made sure she got her own individual thing.  He also made note that two of us couldn't drink and brought out shots for everyone with 2 virgin drinks.  He made great recommendations and was helpful.  He also took time to take a couple photos for us.  As for the the ambiance, it was beautiful.  We had a great time celebrating.",

I brought my two young daughters and they have 4 different food allergies between them.. one of which was fish.  Our server patiently worked with me to come up with the best options for my girls from the kids menu.  We got the grilled chicken skewers and wagyu beef sliders for them.  They enjoyed both.  The meals came with some mochi ice cream and they were the best mochi I've ever had.   For the adults, we got oysters, passion fruit shrimp ceviche, yellow tail ceviche, uni, lobster roll, the infamous wagyu dumplings, and many many more.  Everything was amazing.  This is obviously not a place for kids but they accommodated us extremely well.  The server was awesome regarding our allergy issues.  I didn't get his name but everyone,  server & busser were so kind and professional.  The table next to us had some epic-looking cocktails that I hope to come back without the kids to try.  Try this place out. You won't regret it.",

We had a very competent waiter who came over and brought us some drinks and water. He followed up with an explanation of the options and asked if we wanted the kitchen to set up a menu for us or if we wanted to order.  He gave us several pricing options so we decided to let the chef do her thing and surprise us...  We were surprised - very pleasantly.  Every course was delightfully presented and it was as tasty as it looked...and just when you thought it was over...wait there was more.  I wish we and ordered more of the sushi as it was so good but then everything was!  The crispy tacos were a hit as was the platter of grilled yakatori (veg and meats!).  the meat stew was melt in your mouth and coup de gra (sp.) was the SUSHI....  eel, tuna, salmon some exotic rolls - it was all exceptional!  Must visit in Vegas!",

Luckily we were staying at The Palazzo, which is where Sushi Samba is located, so it was very convenient for me and my group of girls. We went for dinner and I ordered/tried only a few dishes since I wasn't that hungry:  -MISO SOUP cilantro and tofu -JAPANESE A5 WAGYU BEEF GYOZA kabocha puree and su-shoyu dipping sauce -UNI sea urchin (both nigiri & sashimi)  The Japanese A5 was perfect, the flavors all blended so nicely together! The beef inside the savory gyoza was rich and juicy in flavor. The sea urchin was fresh and buttery. The service was outstanding. Everyone was very friendly and accommodating and our server frequently checked on our table. It was my bachelorette weekend and when the server found out, he surprised us with a tower of fruity cocktails. How sweet is that?",

HH is in the bar area only, but it let us down. Everything was OK.  The sushi rolls were not fresh and came out like right after ordering...the shisito peppers were rather tasteless. The ezo roll could be great if it was fresh.   THAT being said they never brought our squid and the bar tender went to fetch it for like 10-15 minutes so we closed out. They were very apologetic and took it off the bill and gave us complimentary round of drinks to go! Not expected as it was five bucks and we mostly wanted to keep moving :)  On a budget it's decent, but have had way better for less in LA and in Vegas. Good service thought which is very much appreciated!!!!",

The dumplings stuffed with the beef is totally my fave. All of it really rocked my world. But again you will not get full if you have a healthy appetite: the only thing too is the Dessert is made up of two different ice cream flavors, fresh berries, sliced banana and what we were calling Cracker Jacks!!!

However,  they only had one Saki bottle available which was a bit of a let down.  SS is a fusion Japanese Brazilian steak house.  Our waiter suggested we order their  sampler which was good for a large group (starts at $60 to $150) per person, but our group opted out and went with a la cart instead. I'm going to have to revisit that next time I'm here. It sounded really good.  The highlight of our night with SS was our waiter and their staff.  They were all magnificent.  Our waiter also knew his bar menu, to the dinner menu all the way to dessert. Bam, home run!!  We can't thank you enough for taking such great care of our group.  If you're looking for a Japanese fusion with a twist of Brazilian, this would be a good place.  Their servings are adquate, their drinks selection are fantastic, ambiance is classy, and their menu has a variety of unique dishes that will tickle, even one with the most discerning palate.  Note:  Sushi Samba is located on the 2nd floor of the Venetian (take the escalator from the main entrance where you see the \"ice like\" sculpture.  Until then, be kind to one another and Cheers! ~ :p",

I like how to the place is set up and the menus and place settings are nice. Menu is a little hard to read but with the internet, we were able to figure out everything (our waiter didn't come for drinks right away.. we waited about 7-10 min which was long for the amount of people in the restaurant).   Got our drinks and food at the same time because we had so much time to look at the menu. We ordered spicy tuna and salmon avocado rolls. We also ordered the heirloom tomato salad and the organic chicken anticuchos. Got our sushi first, not the appetizer -- heirloom tomato salad. Sushi was good! No soy sauce needed for me. The heirloom tomato salad was not heirloom tomatoes. They were cherry tomatoes. We were completely disappointed for $13 -- it was not at all what we ordered so we sent it back. The waiter said the menu said \"heirloom cherry tomato salad\" but it most definitely did not. Then we had the organic chicken anticuchos (waiter's recommendation between that and the ribeye). This was good, but not 2 skewers for $10 and some corn. It was good, just not worth the amount paid. I wouldn't get again.   Get to our bill and he took off the salad, which was good. However, when you look at the bottom of the bill, it has tip % prices. NOTE*** be aware. Always double check your tip price that it has on there*** our tip percentages were based off of our price BEFORE the salad was taken off! Our bill was $34 and our tax was around $2.50 and it said 20% was almost a $10 tip! You do the math! So we asked and he said it was for the original bill which was around $47!  Do your tip yourself; double your tax; double check their work! Computers aren't always correct! That wasn't right for the tip calculator to have those values on there for the price that was in big numbers and bolded..",

Started with the edamame and the Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza. The gyoza was melt-in-your-mouth AMAZING.   Shared two spicy tuna rolls, nice and fresh.   Dessert we shared the Mochi. Criticism on that is we weren't told flavors or given options. Came with chocolate, green tea, orange and strawberry. Only 2 out of 4 kinds were eaten.   The cocktails were very generic and left much to be desired. Ordered a bottle of Pinot Grigio.

Lunch time is light and walked w/o waiting at 11:30.   However the hostess Anika is the only downside to my experience.  I came to the checkin table first and after I said table for one, she just ignored me for a larger group, who seemed to barge ahead, and caught her attention.  Not even a word to me. Just started seating the larger group. The other host (male) saw what happened and tried to make up for it. I may be just a party of one, but hey I come to LV a lot more and next time, I may be bring a family or friends.    Ignoring this poor treatment by the so-called \"hostess\" Anika, I recommend the SeaBass and the Samba Sushi.  Take note of small sizes - u probably need 3 dishes per person.  This is the $$$ category, so allocate $60 to $100 per person depending on your tastes.  Who knows if I may return here, when there are so many great Vegas restaurants ?  The hostess is not doing any favors for the restaurant.  However, the rest of the staff was excellent and attentive.",

The sake we love is more than $350 a bottle but it does have quiet a selection here.  Our favorite is the kobe beef on the rock.  Its simply awesome and beautifully presented.  The raw lobster sashimi is always good.  However the oysters this time was not sweet at all.  If you don't mind paying way way way too much for sushi, then Sushi Samba does have good quality of fish.",

The wait on a Sunday night was about 45 minutes ... so we asked if we could sit/eat at the bar. They said it was fine and were promptly seated.  We ordered 3 sushi rolls and 1 entree along with a couple of beers and one cocktail. For three people our bill was well over $100 and we didn't really have that much to eat. The service at the bar was friendly, but unattentive ... they seemed more interested in talking with each other than the customers that night. It was good, but I can't see paying $14+ for \"specialty\" rolls and $8-9 for a standard spicy tuna roll that you can get at a very good sushi restaurant for $5-6 anywhere other than on the strip in Vegas. I know ... it's Vegas, everything is expensive ... but $100 for a few rolls and an entree is a bit excessive.",

    "text": "I wanted to give this 4.5 stars, but I'll round down. Came here with my sister for a convention in Vegas, we walked around the Venetian and Pallazzo for a while until we finally decided on SushiSamba.  First of all, the restaurant is beautiful. I really love the wall painings, interior design, and the bathroom design was really cool as well. Service here was excellent, my water was always full, when I got up to use the restroom I placed my napkin on the table, when I came back it was neatly folded back for me.   We decided to get two appetizers. First the Rock Shrimp Tempura... Really no point in ordering this. Tempura taste the same everywhere, nothing special about theirs. We also tried the taquitos as suggested by the waitress. These were really just mini taco's. Main Lobster and Yellowtail. Both were nice and chilled taco's. Good sauce on the side. Not sure if I'd order them again, but they were decent.  For dinner my sister ordered their Miso Marinated Chilean Sea Bass. This was absolutely excellent. The fish was cooked perfectly, it was so soft and delicious. It's served with vegetables and those were pretty good too. Possibly the post Chilean Sea Bass I've ever had.   For my dinner I decided to order two rolls, the Neo Tokyo and the BoBo Brazil. The Neo Tokyo, which is bigeye tuna and tempura flake was delicious. The little sauce on top was a nice spicy sauce. This roll was very delicious. As for the BoBo Brazil.... Quite gross, too much avocado, wayyy too much in fact, in overpowered the entire roll. Both regular avocado and some mushy avocado. In addition the red onion also gave it some very odd taste. This was one of the worst sushi rolls I have ever eaten.  For dessert we ordered the Samba split for two. It was really good, and a decent sized portion. Everything on the plate complemented each other and the banana brulee was fantastic.",

    "text": "I had doubt on this place.   How would Brazilian food work well with Japanese food? I only love authentic Japanese food. I sure can have the typical combination, but I only see that as American Japanese food.   Sometimes I feel like a restaurant that does fusion because it does not have a firm grip to do the real deal.   But this place changed my mind. It earned my respect. I ordered some grill items, some sushi rolls, and some nigiri. The nigiri was done properly. The portion of rice and fish was proper. I enjoyed two of the sushi rolls: Yamato (tuna, foie gras, osetra caviar, gold leaf) and Rainbow Dragon (freshwater eel, red bell pepper, cucumber, mango, avocado). I know, the rainbow dragon roll sounds like a stable nowadays (like chicken teriyaki). But I was surprised by the use of mango in the roll. The mango gave that interesting bite to it. The Yamato roll was a surprise - I didn't expect foie gras would go so well with ahi tuna. But the gold leave was pointless (in my opinion) other than giving a bling bling (and charge extra expensive) for the roll.   The seviches was just ok (i.e. within expectation). But the robata was good - we had fillet Mignon and lamb. We also had Japanese Kobe Beef (well, we were travelling at Vegas - so we just splurged on our food instead of spending it at the outlet). It was good. But I think it's overpriced. If you haven't had Japanese Kobe beef before, you don't have to try it at this place unless you are ready to spend some money or to celebrate your win at the casino.   The decor has those typical hip restaurant vibe. The harajuku graffiti was a bit awkward to me but I guess most customers will think that's cool. But I wasn't impressed by the video that was played by the restaurant when I was there. We were there for an early dinner (to catch a show at the hotel). So we were there around 5:45. And the restaurant was playing some party video was not that respectful in my opinion. Pretty much you only see a brunch of people partying and dancing and showing their skins. (only a few step away from girls gone wild japanese party version). There were some close up of girls' legs and cleavage that kinda bothered me.   Luckily, some customers requested to watch something else. It was the time about the bailout plan and eventually the large screen was showing news.   So the party video took that star away.   Although it's kinda dark in the restaurant, I saw a couple with two young kids having dinner as well. It's not necessary kids friendly but kids are welcome.   But the food at this place was surprisingly good. So, it's worth to give a try. And if you are catching a show, the restaurant will make sure you will be able to make it. :)",

    "text": "GO THERE.   I've been 4 times to this Las Vegas location. I have sat twice at a table and twice at the bar, and I have to say, sitting at the bar is the way to go! The waiter I had on my birthday was absolutely terrible. He forgot a dish and then took 30 (no joke) minutes bringing me what was suppose to be a surprise bday dessert. I understand the intent, but it was my bday and XS was calling my name. Oh and, they pour great drinks - a plus and rare practice in Sin City.  Anyway, the food is worth roughly 10 golden, shining stars. Get the yellowtail taquitos, don't ask questions, JUST GET THEM. You can thank me later. But really, ANYTHING on this menu is decadent. And although it seems pricey, every time I get the check I am surprised at how inexpensive the meal is as a whole.",

I would guess that the rive was maybe a teaspoon, if that. And the thinly sliced hamachi, sake, and unagi was not much bigger, literally, than a piece of gum. Way overpriced and undersized. The unagi was cold, not freshly cooked, more akin to something under a heat lamp. And sitting at the sushi bar itself was no joy. One orders from the waiter, not directly from the sushi chef.  Other Palozo/Venetian high-priced restraunts give you service & food worth the costs, not Sushi Samba. Save you money, go somewhere else.",

I asked the hostess for menus and AFTER she told me I had to order from the bar she said someone would be there to help me. Errr...ok? My friend didn't hear any of this, but the bartender was nice and said instead of having us go up to the bar, she would have a waiter serve us.  The waiter who came was also really nice.  I ordered a veggie tempura and spicy tuna roll. The veggie tempura roll was one of the bigger dishes there and was pretty good. It came with a traditional sauce and a creamy tangy sauce.  The spicy tuna roll had really weird rice.  It was smashed together and wasn't sushi rice.  I'm not sure that it was even Japanese rice.  I know this is a fusion restaurant but please don't f up sushi rice!   3 stars might seem a little harsh for bad rice, but as a whole, I guess I just wasn't that impressed.

    "text": "While my better half was making moolah at the poker table, I needed to escape the ding-ding-ding sounds of the casino and decided to grab some happy hour. A short walk from the Encore, SushiSamba seemed to fit my need for some discounted booze and appetizers.   Their long oval bar by the main entrance was pretty much empty, so I easily settled into a spot and perused their happy hour offerings. They offered three different whiskey cocktail concoctions for $6. Not being a huge whiskey fan, I picked the one that sounded the least rough to me. It was actually pretty decent, although I could have used a little more cocktail and a lot less ice.   I picked three appetizers, an amount that is generally plenty at most happy hours to fill me up to the brim. The shrimp & chorizo skewers (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pH0BLkL4cbxKzu471VZnuA?select=rDJUWVRIOa0MXgtMILQ7HA#rDJUWVRIOa0MXgtMILQ7HA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/pH0B...</a>) were my favorite. The shrimp was barely cooked through with nice char marks and the chorizo had great flavors. The chimichurri-like sauce on top was great. I could have eaten a lot more of these. The sliced ahi tuna (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pH0BLkL4cbxKzu471VZnuA?select=rDJUWVRIOa0MXgtMILQ7HA#-AMDCTLNjWrfNMkPbPGf0A\">yelp.com/biz_photos/pH0B...</a>) consisted of two very thin pieces of ahi drowned  in a soy-mustard sauce and topped with a halved cherry tomato and some leaves. This portion was super tiny and made me wonder whether happy hour at this place meant you get a quarter of the portion for half the price of the regular appetizer dish... I got the same feeling with the shredded pork mini tacos (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pH0BLkL4cbxKzu471VZnuA?select=rDJUWVRIOa0MXgtMILQ7HA#i30qdbtwZSj2f8tNbjkqLQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/pH0B...</a>). One bite and those suckers were gone. The spicy sauce on the side served in a shot glass looked cool, but it was so frickin' hot (the bartenders thoroughly warned me) that you could only use a mini droplet on each taco. So what was the point of serving that much sauce? Again, the portion size was disappointing and the taco was just average.   Two drinks & three appetizers = $37 (including tip). I left hungry and unimpressed. For around $40 I can usually eat and drink myself into stupidity at happy hour. Sheesh, I could have had a great entree and a nice glass of wine at many of Vegas' amazing restaurants instead. Oh well, SushiSamba is overpriced for its portions and the dishes were nothing mind blowing. Don't think I'll be back here anytime soon.",

    "text": "Sorry, SushiSamba, but what happens in Vegas, certainly does not stay in Vegas.  I was recently on a business trip to the Sin City and ate at SushiSamba three separate occasions. The first two were great experiences, but sadly third time wasn't a charm. It completely ruined my entire experience.  While the sushi was good (certainly not the best I've ever had) I was appalled when my co-worker found a hair in his roll during my third meal there. As soon as he did, we notified our waitress and her reply was \"can I get you another roll?\" so he ordered a new one. Then she asks, \"is it blonde? Because if it is, it may have been mine but don't worry I showered this morning.\"  Yelpers, I kid you not.  OH GEE THANKS! Now I can rest assured knowing your dead skin cells that are possibly floating around my stomach were at least CLEAN.  I about died - but instead stuck to eating coconut rice (I didn't dare touch a roll). A few minutes later..... another hair.  This time I stormed up and demanded the manager who questioned us the entire time and seemed entirely unconvinced that there was any hair in either of the rolls. I am sorry, but when a customer is SHOWING YOU a hair in their food, you should probably not question it. She then says, \"I just have to check because sometimes it isn't hair. Sometimes it is just small shards of chopsticks that look like blonde hair.\"  Are you kidding me? So now, I should be happy with the fact that it might not be the waitress' CLEAN blonde hair, but instead a shard of chopstick that could pierce my esophagus?  I have never experienced a more ridiculous restaurant situation in my life. Needless to say I left with the worst impression of the entire restaurant, which is a pity considering the first two occasions went well. Good luck to whoever dines at this place - but don't worry, at least the hair in your sushi roll is probably clean.",

We had miso soup shared the Lima roll, Jalapeno roll & the Ahi Jalapeno Ceviche. The miso soup and rolls were great but felt the ceviche wasn't as good as we expected.  I also had a specialty drink recommended by our waiter which was very good and refreshing. Don't remember the name but it had grapefruit juice, gin and mint if I'm not mistaken. To end our meal, we shared the samba split which is a banana split that has caramelized bananas, candied popcorn, little pieces of flan, whipped cream and of course ice cream.   Highly recommend this restaurant. The atmosphere is very upbeat and lively.",

    "text": "I enjoy Sushi Samba a ton and it is one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas. I have been there three and had the tasting menu each time. This place is essentially Japanese, Peruvian, and Brazilian fusion.   If you're willing to spend some money ($50-$100 a head), I recommend doing the tasting menu. It's a 5-7 food course and displays some of the full offering of the restaurant. Some of the highlights of my meal were the ceviche tacos, the beef gyozas (sp?), the meat courses, and finally the sushi. The sides are also excellent, with the Peruvian corn and more.  All in all, it's unique food and definitely worth checking out. This place is very pricey though, so be prepared to spend money.",

    "text": "Peru meets Brazil meets Japan is the brilliance of SUSHISAMBA!  Three different cuisines all beautifully merged to make an incredibly diverse menu, including sushi, tempura, ceviches, soups and noodles, robata meats, churrasco meats and more.  We sat down, looked at the menu and couldn't decide where to start...there's soo many options. So when the waiter came by and offered to create a custom menu with a few dishes from each cuisine for about 50 bucks a head we were SOLD!  We had the: Crispy Yellowtail Taquitos: served with spicy aji panca sauce and fresh lime  Neo Tokyo: bigeye tuna, tempura flake, aji panca  Sashimi: Salmon and Tuna Berkshire Pork Gyoza kabocha pumpkin puree and su-shoyu dipping sauce Rib Eye Antichuchos: aji panca with Peruvian corn Sea Bass Antichuchos: miso with Peruvian corn El Topo: salmon, jalapeno, shiso leaf, fresh melted mozzerella, crispy onion  All the dishes were absolutely delicious! But if I had to pick, the Yellowtail Taquitos and the two antichuchos would be at the top of my list, hands down...the beef antichucho was melt in your mouth, like buttahhh....and the sweet miso glaze on the sea bass was perfection! The El Topo is one of their signature rolls and it's pretty good but a bit on the heavy side from all the mozarella, in my opinion...  The service was extraordinary. The waiters and busboys were hanging on us hand and foot, promptly clearing dishes, constantly replacing utensils, plates, and refilling drinks. For me, the service takes this place from a 4 to a solid 5!  SUSHISAMBA, you did me proud!",

    "text": "This is what a fusion restaurant should be: a brilliant amalgamation of the best flavours of Japanese, Peruvian, and Brazilian cuisines and cocktails, wrapped up into one delightfully fun venue. I'd go back to Vegas and the Venetian for another bite here, that's for sure!  I started off with the Chu-Cumber cocktail (from the \"Japan cocktails\" sec'n), which is made of: shochu (the OTHER Japanese distilled spirit, aside from sake--a pretty good alternative to vodka, if I say so myself), Hendricks Gin, elderflower liqueur, and freshly muddled cucumber. Refreshing, light, just a tad sweet. Very good.  We then tried a bit of everything... Peruvian corn (love those giant kernels), a few small plates (crispy yellowtail tacquitos--spicy aji panca sauce and lime? yes, please), and a \"large plate\" a.k.a. entree. So, there's this cool long bar area in the middle of the restaurant, where you can perch yourself and eat/drink more casually... and the guys sitting next to us at the bar were SushiSamba regulars and highly recommended the Chilean Sea Bass for one of our large plate selections. Because I like you all, I'll echo the suggestion. So. good. so. tasty. so. tender.  I think it's a great restaurant with a vibrant vibe, and a delicious menu to boot. I already recommended it once to someone else who ended up going to Vegas a few weeks after I did, and they loved it, too. Definitely a bit pricey, but what do you expect when you're smack dab in the middle of the shops at The Palazzo? At least the quality matches the price!",

    "text": "An excellent fusion of Japanese, Brazilian, and Peruvian.  What I found different about this establishment compared to others is the approach of ordering from their menu.  Our waiter asked us for a price range we're willing to spend.  An example range is $60-$120.  My brother (who's birthday we're celebrating) said about $80 per person.  Next, the waiter asks us what our likes, dislikes, allergies, etc in order to create a unique dining experience for us.  My brother basically said he doesn't want to eat sushi (he didn't feel like it that day), wants to try the gyoza, and definitely want to sample the kobe beef.  After our drinks arrived, we waited about 10-20 minutes before our appetizers and entrees came.  We tried a variety of food which ranged from gyozas, skewers, sea bass, and kobe beef.  The main attraction is the kobe beef where they bring a large stone that's heated to 700 F for us to cook our thinly sliced beef on.  The waiter demonstrated by taking some butter and spreading it on top of the stone followed by laying the beef on top like it's sunbathing.  After a minute or two, the beef slices were dipped onto 1 of 3 sauces and finally onto our table.  The verdict: mouth watering bliss.  Almost as good as the kobe beef I had in Kobe, Japan!!!  The last attraction is the birthday dessert given to my brother.  The candles were sparkling similar to the morning glory fireworks that kids hold in their hands.  Truly a memorable experience.",

But Sushisamba was one of the better dining experiences I've had in Las Vegas, and I would easily recommend it to anyone looking for a great dinner while in town. First, the menu is a combination of Latin and Asian influences, and there is much more to the menu than just sushi (in fact, sushi lovers might be a little disappointed). The rock shrimp was unbelievably good. The meat options -- similar to Brazilian grilled meats -- were delicious. And despite the large crowd of 20 or so, our service was excellent. I loved the spicy tequila drink, so I had two. The sake cocktail was awesome. And I rarely waited more than 5 minutes for anything I requested.   While any size group can enjoy the restaurant, I do think it is perfect for a group because there are so many options to share and to try.  Excellent, and I'm going back.",

The sushi (sashimi) was nothing to brag about, especially given the higher cost of it. The service was not very good either. We sat at the sushi bar and almost immediately after asking one of the chefs what he recommended, we were quickly (and rudely) reprimanded by a random waitress and instructed to not speak with them. We were told to ask the waitresses if we had any questions.  Our feeling on good sushi is both the quality of the fish and the social aspect with the chefs. If this is your kind of environment as well, this location is not for you.  Not returning.",

I even picked out the most popular items (of course, according to Yelp) and took my server's recommendations. However, I expected my taste buds to have a party that night, and it fell a little short.  Overall, it was a good dinner. Service was impeccable. From beginning to end, their staff worked perfectly together to make sure we enjoyed our experience. Water were always refilled, our emptied plates were cleared immediately, yet they didn't hover or rush us. Very friendly. We really couldn't have asked for a better wait staff to serve us.  What did we order?  Crispy Taquitos - Yellowtail & Lobster Rib-Eye Robata Skewers Miso Marinated Chilean Sea Bass w/ Purple Sweet Mashed Potatoes Peruvian Corn Samba Strip Roll Bobo Brazil Roll Rosca - donuts  The best tasting dishes for us was of course the Chilean Sea Bass. It was good enough that we were a bit disappointed that it was such a small serving size. Two small skewers. Peruvian Corn was also a hit. However, the sushi rolls were well presented, but lacked much in flavor. The rib-eye and taquitos were decent, but as I reiterate, all pretty to look at, yet nothing came close to being a wow.  Setting is very nice, the restaurant is nice set up to accommodate large parties as well as couples. Bar serves food and offer happy hour drinks till 7pm on weekdays.   I definitely appreciated the complimentary birthday dessert, the Coco Duo, which was sweet and yummy. Photos are available of all items I listed here.   3 stars for now, however I'd definitely give Sushi Samba another try. Maybe the wow will come later...",

The best thing to do here is to simply let them pick for you.  They will take your preferences, likes and dislikes, budget, and create something special for you.  It is a fusion feast taking the best of Japan, Brazil and Peru.  How does a little thin strip of Kobe beef sound, dipped in truffle oil, a little rock salt, and then cooked by you on a 550 degree Japanese river stone?  Or soft, fresh calamari dusted in a slightly spicy preparation that will leave you wondering where it all went?    It is not cheap - but the quality is amazing and the service is spectacular.

My cocktail was complex and intriguing (but supposedly spicy and it wasn't) and I'd love to try to figure out how to make it at home. The plating was spectacular for all of the dishes.

We were a party of 12 and from the minute we sat down our waiter put a full court press on pushing his dinner selections on us. He was extremely impatient with our party, didn't bring the entrees out all together and rushed our dinner party.  I wasn't finished with my dinner when he came and scooped it up while I was talking!  Never again.",

She has an attitude N don't even look at you when she greeted. Anyway that is not the reason why I gave them 1 star. The food, omg, is not good at all.  I know its Caribbean fusion; however their sushi roll is so dried. Ramen soup is lack of flavor. It's just spicy that was it.   It is so over price!",

I was reading other reviews and everyone mentioned the sea bass skewers and Peruvian corn. It was pretty good. Sea bass was very yummy but I would prefer to have less sauce. The yellow tail tacos were also very good and fresh. My favourite was the rock shrimp tempura. Just the right mix of sauce batter and shrimp. We ordered the el topo sushi to top things off and it was not bad but wish I had more room to try other stuff. Will definitely recommend and will come back for sure.",

Sashimi quality and sushi rolls were good/sorta expected. Also got the pork belly ramen, but wasn't as good as I imagined. The ramen was good but didn't care for anything else in it. The broth was a little spicy as well.   Price: I think the bill was $110 for 2? It's not the cheapest place but most sushi/Japanese places are similar in pricing and on top of it, it's on the strip. So that's not too surprising.   Overall: I think the tacos and salmon sashimi really did it for me. Everything else was ok. Now I'm thinking is 4 stars too much...I'd say 3.5 stars if I could.",

    "text": "On our most recent trip to Las Vegas, we came not once, but twice to sushi samba. On both occasions the food was out of this world and we were able to experience a table meal and also a bar- happy hour meal. Both were unbelievable and special in their own way. On our first trip, we had Alice as our server and we were blown away. She knew the menu like it was her own and made recommendations for us that we really enjoyed. She came just often enough to check on us and explained each dish as it came out. She spaced all the plates to come a few minutes apart so we could have our hot food hot. We had been here before and this trip only confirmed our opinion that this is one of the premium restaurants in the city. The chef sent out some special dishes for us to try because we were loyal returnees. Yellow tail taquitos were amazing as was the Sao Paulo roll. The seaweed salad was an excellent way to cleanse the palet and to sop up all the leftover sauces that were so delicious and you didn't want to give up. Drinks were delicious as well and since I didn't think I remembered either one, I'm guessing that the drink menu changes often. The mad Russian had a chu-cumber and I had a lemon samurai if you read this within a reasonable amount of time as its written. Both were awesome- but I'm sure that whatever you try, you'll be delighted, as were we. On our other visit, we brought my sister and chose to eat at the bar. Wow! What an awesome happy hour. We ate just about everything available and went back for seconds on some. Standouts were sea bass skewers and the lamb lollipops. Wagyu sliders we a hit and the rock shrimp left my mouth watering. The Calamari was cut into strips rather than rings and was out of this world. You'll be like us if you're lucky, and try everything. You won't be disappointed. I'm reasonably sure- but don't hold my feet to the fire- that this location is as good at gets- rivaling the location in NYC which we love as well!  Super well done and thanks for being such a great place to eat!",

    "text": "The best thing this establishment had was its fusion of Peruvian and Brazilian flavors with the traditional Japanese sushi experience. I had some kind of tuna tacos that had lime and other flavors (I don't recall their names) and a special Peruvian sauce that was absolutely delicious. The miso, too, had some cilantro. I had a specialty roll that was a signature of the style, excellent, but, just like the above, I don't recall its exact flavors.  The downside was everything else. The service was inattentive and unhelpful when we had menu questions. Our server forgot basic things like making sure our table had soy sauce (the tables to either side did). The portions were not filling at all, necessitating that we order about three entree-size items each. This wouldn't have been so bad, except the prices were exorbitant. An equivalent meal at a less hip sushi place would have been about a third of the price. I grant the fusion flavors were a novelty, but with the service and portion problems, they simply weren't worth it.  This place is definitely good for a snack, a roll, but don't eat dinner here and don't expect anything of the service.",

I had these just a few weeks ago in CT and they should be meaty, thick oysters that melt in your mouth. They were like underdeveloped bluepoints. Not worth $5 each.   Was offered a special if toro carpaccio with Xavier topping. I asked if I could get it with whole tomorrow instead and after checking with the chef was told yes. When it was served I took one look at the Toro and having had a bad experience with grizzly tuna instead of fatty tuna I immediately mentioned it and said it did not look good. I said I would try one and if I didn't like it I would like them taken back. They were horrible and were returned. When I got the bill they were shown but deducted out. Good thing, as for pieces were $66 and the seven caviar eggs on each of them were an additional $16! The reason the chef was chopping them up is that he knew they were tough and grizzly. He should not of agreed to make an inferior product.   Tako, octopus, was very good  Hand roll (hamachi scallion jalapeno) was  good  Uni sushi (sea urchin)  with pheasant egg was excellent.   Service was a little slow but considering how busy the place was it was perfectly acceptable.   So I'm disappointed in the quality of two very expensive fish products. If you go I would avoid the sushi.",

I cannot remember all of the food that was presented, nor did my eyes and stomach allow me to take pictures of it.  I just dove in (along with the rest of the party).    My absolute favorites were the ceviche taco and the fish skewers.  I don't remember the type of fish but it was so perfectly marinated and cooked. There was wagyu beef gyoza and other items, but those stood out the most.  When we thought we couldn't eat anymore, they brought out rolls of fresh sushi.  Who says no to sushi?  Then it followed with incredible chocolate desserts and this ice cream one with popcorn.  It was a sugary blur in my memory but extremely delicious.  I would definitely come back here and recommend this place!",

    "text": "Stayed at the Palazzo last weekend with my best friends, and we stopped by Sushi Samba for lunch. I'd heard great things from friends who've eaten here in the past, and was really excited to see what it was all about.  My two friends got specialty rolls while I ordered a simple spicy tuna roll. When I saw that they had an oyster menu, I asked how often the oysters were shipped in (since Vegas is a landlocked city, it definitely isn't found in the backyard). The waitress said daily, every morning, so I ordered one Kumamoto oyster. It tasted great, added my usual dash of tabasco and lemon juice, and was a happy camper.  About two hours later, after roaming around the Grand Canal Shoppes, we got back to our hotel room, and I felt my stomach grumbling. I had some water and laid down to take a nap. About an hour later, I jumped up, told my friends to avoid the bathroom, and started puking my guts out. I hugged the toilet for about 2 hours, sipping warm salt water in between hurls.  The oyster is what got me, and I'm truly disappointed that it ruined what was a good experience at Sushi Samba. The waitresses were nice, environment fun, but I really didn't expect to start my vacation off with food poisoning.  tl;dr don't order the oysters.",

This time we were celebrating our 20th year wedding anniversary. We had reservations and we're promptly seated. Our server Philip was AWESOME!!! Super attentive, friendly, and all-around great personality. Specialty drinks were concocted just for us and a Happy Anniversary complimentary dessert was served by the manager himself. What keeps us coming back to this place is the truly wonderful vibe, great atmosphere, the VERY attentive service, and of course... The food! Top notch thru and thru!",

But seriously whoever though to fuse brazilian, japanese, and peruvian should be given a nobel prize.  The taquitos come straight from heaven.  I mean so much was going on with my tastebuds when i ate them I was just shocked that I could be faced with even more sensory overload, in Vegas of all places! Between the excellent fish, the crispy shell, and the spicy sauce YUM. My only regret is that we didn't get two orders and try the lobster ones too (we got yellowtail).    I only wish the service had been a little better. We felt rushed out and the food came out almost as fast as a mcdonald's drive thru.

    "text": "Our waiter made a really good point that many people believe your restaurant is a traditional Japanese restaurant if you have sushi in the name. However, this place certainly did not disappoint.  So this location is a mix of Chilean, Brazilian, and Japanese tastes. It certainly was unique. The environment is vibrant and alive. I felt that it really complimented their fusion style really well. They had flat screen TVs and projectors everywhere, showing pleasant scenery or traditional acts. I was just amazed by their design and color throughout the restaurant. Their decor was also very compatible with their theme. The look was sharp and inviting at the same time.  The food was great. I tried the BoBo Brazil Roll. I tried this because I wanted to experience their unique tastes, and it certainly brought the restaurant's fusion tastes together. It had seared kobe beef and red onions on top of what I think was an avocado roll with kaiware, and some other ingredients. It cost $17; the taste was awesome, but we could not decide whether or not it was worth the full $17. Other items we ordered included a pork belly ramen, a ribeye bento box, and a terriyaki chicken bento box. These were generic dishes, but they turned out great.   The restaurant serves dishes in appetizer or small portions. Do not expect a large portion when ordering an entree. This restaurant is more for people who want to shell out a little bit of cash to enjoy something unique. Four of us ordered a total of 6 items and then mochi ice cream for desert.   The service was really on top of everything. Our waiter knew the menu and was able to tell us what was in every item we asked, and told us what to expect from the restaurant's style of cooking. He came around periodically to make sure everything was okay, and just did a perfect job.  I would definitely recommend people to try this place at least once. It is a little on the pricey end, but it is worth the quality of food that you receive.",

    "text": "When it comes to asian fusion food, I could probably find nothing better than Sushi Samba.  Some colleagues and myself decided to meet here for a dinner meeting and overall, atmosphere, waiting service, selection of food, and cleanliness all surpassed expectations.  I do admit though, that a) I was not ready for the bill, and b) ultimately, there's better value elsewhere.    I'll explain:   The location is extremely convenient being in the middle of the Venetian Palazzo so it literally was down the elevator and to the left from my room.  The setting was a hip new age laced with asian motif. However, I felt rushed to a certain degree due to the cramptness (3 of us were 6' or taller and over 200lbs) and also the extreme business of waiter + customers + waiting line out the front.  We decided to ask the waitress to order for us as we were more interested in business discussion than the food itself, and felt that we passed on the message that we were looking for 3-4 appetizers or so to whet our palette and no more.  Yes, out came 4 dishes (to this day I'm not sure if it was the main or appy), and absolutely, each dish was delicious.  The braised pork was perfectly cooked with some searing on the edges to caramalize the sugars.  The fried shrimp was well done without any 'oily' taste or textures.  Skewered fish was the highlight of the affair in my opinion as the fish was neither too well done making it tough, or raw on the inside.  And finally, the sushi (hamachi, sake, tamago, and toro) was put together fairly well although I thought the cuts were a little thin for my taste.    The bill ended up to be just over $300 for three people without any alcohol.  It's not cheap folks.  It's definitely a personal feeling thing but at $300 I'm expecting more... I was feeling the dinner's value was no more than $60 per person and not $100+ per person.  I'd take the extra $40 per person and put it into a taxi cab fare to go to different place but then again, that's only because my value of convenience is probably lower than most.  Food - A+ Service - A+ Atmosphere - B+ Cleanliness - A Value - B",

We're recognizably unhip and, speaking for myself, would have to bring my sexy back with major surgery.  Still, surrounded by a lot of sparkly skinny girls on a night out and men projecting their moneymaking abilities (or at least their fashion sense) we weren't unwelcome.   We went twice, first on a Wednesday and then on Friday.  The Wednesday had a fairly respectable crowd while the Friday was pretty packed.  Wednesday had people mostly eating.  Friday had lots of people drinking, being seen, and eating.   The mall it's in was pretty quiet at night so these people walked away from the casino just to come here.  Must be pretty popular in Vegas right now, eh?  Anyway, service was fine for such a packed place.  We had a table on the curving banquette which places you pretty damn close to whoever's got the table next to you.  (People were moving tables in order to get in or out).  The table's small so it's a good thing this place seems to focus on a lot of small plates that come out at odd times.  Drinks came regularly and food came at a reasonable wait.    We had the Wagyu ishiyaki (hot rock cooking at your table) which was sort of fun because with such a small table I imagine you might end up cooking your neighbor's elbow.  Wagyu robatayaki, eggplant robatayaki, tempura green beans, eel avocado hand roll, some kind of fries that were really sauced baby potatoes, and a bunch of drinks.  I loved the nina fresa, by the way.  Strawberry martini.  Everything was good.  The ishiyaki was more tasty/fun than the robatayaki, if you want wagyu.  They took pretty good care of us on the Friday when we told them it was our anniversary.  Free dessert.  As a bonus the manager recognized us from Wednesday and also sent us a free dessert.  Score!  Of course, we did get one of the most expensive things on the menu so I suppose that could account for it, too.  Anyway, we didn't have super high expectations but really enjoyed ourselves enough to come back two days later.",

Their eggs benedict replaces the ham with smoked salmon.  I was imaging the smoked salmon as thick as the canadian ham but boy was I wrong.  The paper thin slice of smoked salmon just blended in with the slice of toast.  My napkin was thicker than the smoked salmon.

I loved my lemon samurai - light enough so I could have a perfectly lucid conversation and remember all of it, yet not trivial enough to pass off as a mocktail! The vegetarian roll doesn't merit too much reflection, but the plaintains and coconut rice lent a nice Latin infusion to the otherwise bland menu. The ambiance is mighty chic without being uber pretentious like some of the other Palazzo restaraunts. Which means the crowd is about as \"normal\" as you could get in Vegas! Not abnormal is the pricetag - expensive certainly, but heck, I'd rather savor a memorable dinner than watch my money vanish on a table on the casino floor!

There's tons of people in there drunk on sake, yelling at everything.   The service was excellent. Our waiter was willing to explain the menu if we had any questions.   With drinks and food, you will end up at around $60-$70 per person so be careful with both if you're trying to budget. But then again you wouldn't be eating a sushi place on the strip if you were.

It is made of wood and has two levels to it, almost like a desk. Well I sat my water on the top level to make room for all of our plates. No one told me not to do this. But toward the middle of our meal it fell, without being touched, onto my plate and lap. I left wet and cold with soy sauce splashed all over my shirt. Don't make that mistake. I got an apology and the waitress said- \"yea it's not even up there. I never put things there\".

As you walk into this restaurant tucked in a corner, you are immediately stepping into night of fun. The music is turned up, it's always packed, and it seems like there is always something to watch here. This wouldn't be a place for romantic fun, but it would be the perfect night out on the town.   The yellowtail dish was light and the jalapeno gave it a nice kick. We had a couple of the Samba rolls which were all really delicious and not overly saucy. The service was exceptional and the high-energy restaurant would make me want to come back.",

We had reservations for 11 people. Table was all set when we arrived which was nice. Our server was friendly, knowledgeable and very kind. Unfortunately it was really loud in there so it was hard to hear him explain the menu to us. We decided to do a variety of appetizers and food to share between the table.   I will list food below with short remarks: -Otsumami, assorted of edamame, green beans tempura & shishito peppers. Really good and a fun plate to start your meal.  -Japanese A5 Wagyu Gyoza, not a fan.  -Broiled Peruvian Scallop, yummm! -Crispy Yellowtail Taquitos, these were really tasty.  -Sushi Rolls, cannot recall the names but I was not impressed, which is a bit disappointing based on them specializing on sushi.  -Yellowtail Sashimi, loved it.  -Salmon Sashimi, loved it even more.  -Miso Chilean Sea Bass, FAVORITE! It was honestly so delicious except the corn it was paired with. Very tough texture and overly sweet.  -Whole Lobster, good but not the best. I think with lobster keeping it more simple is always better.  -Japanese Wagyu, not sure how many oz we got, but this was brought over to our table to be cooked table side, on an extremely hot rock. Sauces to dip in were brought out as well. Do not expect for this dish to be filling as it is more for the experience (worth it).  Dessert -Donuts, sugar coated paired with ice cream... amazingly addicting!(forgot the name).   I honestly want to go back just for dessert and of course, the sea bass.",

Our server,  Jeff, doesn't know just how much he made my experience here worthwhile.  I was only visiting on a major move and celebrating a miserable number of a birthday.  However,  Jeff went above and beyond the service I could ever expect or desire a server to provide.  I actually felt special. It sounds cliche and easy to ignore but I've never really felt special until Jeff served us.  It has been an exhausting week and from the recommendations,  the timely execution,  the friendly flirting with a lonely old gross guy and his sister,  and the added quick but sweet dessert to just emphasize the speciality of the event... but wait,  then he makes sure I am well hydrated both in liquid courage as well as a to go cup of iced water.  Jeff was thoughtful,  precise,  and cute to your needs.  Tip him insanely well because anything less shows the indecency of humanity and Jeff is the only decent human I've come across thus far. Thank you Jeff,  you made me feel like there's hope for this fugly hopeless guy. I can't wait to return with a friend to share in this exquisite experience!",

For our large group, the waiter said if we set a price point per person, they could bring out favorite dishes in waves and do a mini-type tasting menu. We set $50 per person and it worked out well for our group.  However, we did not enjoy the service beyond that. I ordered 3 bottles of champagne up front, courtesy of a friend who could not attend the birthday, and the service did a good job of refilling our glasses and keeping it flowing at the table. However, the waiter brought out a bottle and presented to me before opening, and I thought we had already had 3 bottles. I asked if it was a 4th, he said yes, and I told him no thanks. It felt rude to bring out a bottle before asking if we wanted more, perhaps hoping we had lost count, and then having to send it back. He also was not helpful to us in understanding best way to divide check, and kept coming back to check in short intervals if it was ready.  Good food, not great service experience.",

Sushi was good. The table got 6 rolls and a ramen. The food was good and for the most part so was service. It was after the waiter took our cards and was gone for 15-20 minutes where the night took a turn. He came back and told us the card was declined. We called the bank and was informed that the card was flagged because it was scanned by a Square App. When we went to the manager we were told his employees were trustworthy and offered us a drink as an apology for our trouble, but that we were being very accusatory. We are not the confrontational type. Our bank literally told us the exact moment the card was compromised and it was during our meal at Sushi Samba. BEWARE.",

It's a mix of the various cultures and it is just interesting to look at.   The service was stellar. Very friendly and very warm. The food was fantastic.

The waiter pitched the fixed meal to us and we named the price point. We selected $80.00 a person.     The fixed meal came out in numerous stages, obviously.   1- fried string beans, edamame, grilled hot peppers. 2- dumplings 3-fried tacos with asian slaw and pork 4-scallop lettuce wraps 5-cod fish skewers with peruvian corn, kobe beef grilled on hot salted stones and steak served on sauteed vegggies 6- sushi and sashimi platter 7-asian ice cream tower  It was alot of food and the food was outstanding and high in quality. Some of the best pieces of meat I have had in quite some time.  After drinks and tip the bill was ~$140.00 a person. Quite EXPENSIVE even for vegas.",

Rock shrimp tempura, kanpachi ceviche, seared wagyu, grilled veg side dish, hamachi, Saba, madai, sushi.   My one blah moment was a la crate Shimaji sushi a la carte. Easily the worst shimaji I've had in the world.   Service was good and friendly except at the end when they gave me the bill then just talked to another table of patrons (friendly conversation) and got into hockey (he pulled out a phone to recap a hockey replay) then went on talking about Singapore. It's great he got along with he customers behind us but it took forever for him to bring the machine for me to pay and leave. They must have a protocol since the bus person and other servers who Wales by saw my card on the bill and never took it and never pointed it out to or server. We kept asking servers to pick up plates that we didn't need to make room for other dishes. That was a bit of a pain too.   Mostly good! We'd still return.  Oh don't bother going if it's a new date night or if you have a sorry throat. High ceilings, vibing crowd, you have to talk loud in there.",

Don't be misled to think this is traditional Japanese sushi, in any sense of the word.   Many of the sushi rolls are spicy and gussied up, which, for me, was just ok. They do have a small selection of traditional sushi offerings, but most people were there for the \"samba rolls\", so we did them too.   It was pretty easy to get into for lunch, and I found it to be more sedate, in ambience, than dinner.  For dinner, this place is not conducive to conducting business, and definitely not for intimate conversation due to the high decibel levels. However, it is very \"Las Vegas\", and fun with a large group of friends for a fun night of partying.",

The portion are tiny just like how all the fancy restaurants on the strip served their food.  I like to sit at the bar because I believe in one on one service. When dinner time arrived the bar will more likely full. The bartender/waitress 80% of time hardly crack a smile and sometime busy with her text messages and 9 out of 10 time I have to kept asking for the refill my drink or order another beer.  Also be warn about their napkin since it will give you lint all over your dark pants or your skirt.  I wish the service can be better because the food is absolutly tasty for strip sushi.",

Also had a caipirinha type of drink with mushed berries.., aweful! Couldn't swallow and I am not able to tell what it was about it.  Loved, however, the pineapple turnover.  Was perfectly made, as big as the palm of your hand, not too sweet, not too sour, perfect texture and consistency, plain quite delicious.    The restaurant is very dark, lots of dark wood.., the bar is like a piece of tree trunk.., the waitstaff does not seem to have any sense of style, although I have to say everyone was very, very nice.., but the point is that it is not what you expect once you have been to the more stylish, chic restaurant in Miami Beach.

They served us an amazing mushroom dish with coconut milk and a mix of unique mushrooms- a real treat for the vegetarians at the table- and those of us who aren't too. Taquitos with lump grab meat, tempura veggies.... and a dessert platter with very memorable mochi and little dessert cups that included flakes of gold! It doesn't get any better than this.  The atmosphere is dark and hip, reflecting the sabor of Peru, Brazil, and Japan- a super innovative and successful fusion of the three countries. Having been to Brazil twice, I liked that they projected video on the walls from Rio de Janeiro- made me nostalgic about my visits!    A classic upscale, trendy Vegas dining experience- and a fun reminder of the exciting common ground between various world cuisines. Will definitely return!",

Eleven of us arrived a few minutes before our reservation and I checked in while we grabbed a few drinks at the bar. We were seated just shortly after our check-in when our whole party arrived, which was great, but after that our time at the table seemed to be an unsuccessful long one. We weren't seated with menus and waited quite a while for some info as to what was going on. When our server, Justin notified us that the Chef usually likes to do a \"tasting menu\" for larger parties bringing us items geared towards our tastes we thought that sounded pretty good. He left us to talk it over, and when he came back I asked him if he was sure it was going to be enough food and he said yes we would all leave full so eight out of the eleven in my party decided to try it. With that being said, it wasn't even close to enough food. Edamame, fried green beans and roasted peppers along with what totaled up to be a little more than one sushi roll for each of us and a few skewers of chicken and what looked like a single portion of steak, we all left hungry.  I will say the food was delicious, there just was not enough of it and each of my guests felt guilty not wanting to eat more than others. Several of my party asked me if there was more food coming, but after we received the meat portion that was it. Justin was nice enough to bring a round of shots over for the party, but this was only after two people in my party, who had skipped on the preset menu asked about how much longer their food was going to be after they had ordered it almost thirty minutes earlier! The food was finally brought out with some apologies and my friends ate while we all sat and waited for them to be done. They had insisted it just be cancelled because they felt so bad for us having to wait for them, but I told them to go ahead and eat their dinner. To my surprise, the order that had taken almost thirty additional minutes to come out was still on their bill.   I wish our experience would have been better and we would have left full and happy from an enjoyable birthday dinner, but instead I left feeling embarrassed that my friends and my experience wasn't a better one.   I will also say I tried to reach out to the restaurant directly about my concerns and was told someone would contact me on November 21st... needless to say I never heard anything.",

    "text": "We decided to go to SUSHISAMBA our last night in Vegas because we were really wanting to go to a nice sushi place and I read really good reviews. If I went back to Vegas I would not go here again.  Very loud and we were stuffed onto a tiny table where it felt like we were sitting at the same table as the people on each side of us.  Our server was not that polite and kind of pushy with things and very rude and snappy to the bus boys. The sushi was good but no where close to the best we've had. I understand prices in Vegas and especially certain hotels but for the portions and quality I would not go there and pay those prices again. Pretty disappointed overall.",

    "text": "Japanese/Brazilian fusion is an intriguing concept.  The good: green bean tempura with black truffle aioli, antichuco tenderloin with Peruvian corn, and warm banana chocolate pie.  As far as sushi rolls go: just because you combine a bunch of flavors together doesn't necessarily make them tasty.  The king crab roll with pear was downright odd.  It was served with some type of avocado crema that was not complementary to the crab.  Everything overpowered the fish, in fact I'm not even sure if the roll contained fish.  A green envy roll advertised a wasabi pea crust that I thought would give it crunch. Negative.  Just a light dusting to give the roll yet again an odd flavor.  If you enjoy more traditional Japanese sushi this will not satisfy the craving. However, for light appetizers and drinks this makes for a good spot.",

    "text": "Now that I've been here 4 times, I feel I can give an accurate review.  This place makes me feel very torn.  Here's the deal:  Things to rave about: -Cool energy in the place. Interesting decor, sleek seating areas, random stuff on the tvs to watch, nice music. -Interesting flavors.  Not all their dishes are hits, but they are not afraid to try interesting things with some of their ceviches, tiraditos, etc.  The Neo Tokyo roll is tasty an their Yamato roll is very, very good (tuna, foie gras, osetra, and gold leaf).   -There always seems to be a nice manager checking on us, refolding napkins, etc.  Things that really turn me off about this place: -It's soooooo expensive!  I'm by no means cheap and am willing to pay for good food that is well prepared.  The Yamato roll, for example, is expensive for a roll, but not for the yumminess of the foie gras.  But, some of their other food is just ok, very small portioned, and way overpriced.  The drinks are weak and are also overpriced. It's like the place thinks it's too cool for its own good.  I feel ripped off every time I go. I might not go anymore, to be honest. -Douchiness on NYE.  We dropped by for lunch and were presented with a special menu, cutting off nearly everything normal and adding in some $30+ (charged per person) \"small plates.\"  There were no hand rolls or cut rolls available, even with 5 sushi chefs at the bar.  And, to top it off, the orders of sushi are for one piece. One piece of sushi for 5 bucks! No sushi place does that mess!  While I do enjoy some of the food, I don't enjoy the feeling of being ripped off by a place that really thinks it's so cool that it can.  If I'm going to spend $100 for lunch, there are better places with better food.",

    "text": "Well three of us went here for my husbands birthday last night. We primarily got sushi and the Samba Sushi rolls. So here is the good and the bad: Bad: We made a reservation for 9pm and were still left waiting 20min for a table. I feel whats the point of a reservation if your stuck waiting. The Samba rolls are a little over priced, but its Vegas so its expected. They don't give you wasabi....HELLO its sushi who doesn't give wasabi and pickled ginger. Instead you get this creamy green stuff they claim is wasabi but it's not. Not one hint of spice, tastes more like creamy avocado. Also rolls are not full rolls like a regular sushi place, they are pretty small.  Good: Service was good, our waitress was attentive even though the place was slammed. Also the rolls were tasty. If you do go for sushi the El Toro Samba roll is amazing, as well as the Pacifico.   So for 7 rolls my bill was $95.00 and we eat them in l less time then our wait for them to be made.   I personally wouldn't go here again just because I felt for my time, and money I can find another Sushi place just off the strip thats way better.",

We went with a three course approach for two and couldn't have been happier with what we chose (beef gyoza, neo roll, the duck, filet mignon, and Chilean sea bass). The manager Jeff came over to speak to us and brought over some additional items to try - such a great touch to our experience.  Can't rave about this place enough - we will definitely be coming back here on our next trip to Vegas! Thank you for a great experience! :)",

Ambience is very hip and is perfect for a date night or girls night out.  DRINKS NINA FRESA - our server recommended this drink and its super yummy! its a vodka cocktail drink with strawberries and guava.  FOOD SALMON SEVICHE - excellent seviche... the sauce has a tangy pineapple taste mixed with a little bit of spice because of the jalapenos. really good appetizer.  BERKSHIRE PORK BELLY ROBATA - i think this is the best out of everything that we ordered. the pork belly is super fatty on the outside (but in a good way) and just melts in your mouth. it has a sweet/salty glaze on top of the meat. this dish is just amazing. i highly recommend this dish.  LAMB CHOP ROBATA - good dish but since they served it with the pork belly, this dish was overshadowed.  BOBO BRAZIL - not your typical sushi roll because they put seared beef on top! this roll is super good though!!! i really recommend this one too.  SAMBA STRIP ROLL - out of all the dishes that we had, i was least impressed with this roll. i ordered it because of the maine lobster but the portion is super small and the taste is bland compared to the price ($19.00). if you really wanna try this dish, i suggest you skip the sauce because it overpowers the maine lobster.  Service is okay and I notice the waitress did not course our meals... Refill on drinks is also a bit slow. However, I would definitely go back to this place if ever I'm back in Las Vegas. :)",

Without a doubt, Vegas is the creme de la creme of them all. The combination of the food, staff, music & hospitality is above & beyond. The manager, Rannah, was incredible & most importantly, genuinely cared about the service & our experience at the restaurant. She was sweet enough to give me a complimentary delicious mojito for my loyalty to the brand. LOVE!   The must haves - seared beef tapas, yellowtail taquitos & seabass miso. I might have cried a little bit  indulging in all the food we ordered. It was that good! Bottomline, Sushi Samba across the board is phenomenal, but the Vegas Strip certainly wins the gold medal. It was one of my highlights during this particular trip. I suggest that other Sushi Samba venues take notes from how Vegas operates. This location wins the gold medal in my point of view & continues to earn my loyalty.   FYI - Sushi Samba IS pretty pricey, but worth the service & atmosphere!",

    "text": "Oh lord, this review is a toughie to write.  Sushi Samba is a unique restaurant in that it's a blend of Japanese, Brazilian and Peruvian influence, and we had so many different flavors and samplings of things, this will be quite a mixed review.    They definitely anticipate people being unable to choose from the wide-range of items on the menu, so they actually give you the option of letting the waitress put together your order based on likes, dislikes, preferences, food allergies, and based on PRICE, etc.  We spouted out... \"Salmon!\"                     \"Tuna!\"    \"SPICE!\"        \"allergic to shrimp!\"                       \"Jalapenos!\"    So, the waitress brought out the following:  (1) Edamame with sea salt and lime.  Small plates: (2) Berkshire Pork Gyoza (kabocha pumpkin puree and su-shoyu dipping sauce) - VERY good! The pumpkin puree is a nice touch!  Just be sure to scrape it all off the plate when you pick up the gyoza! (3) Tuna Tataki (white asparagus, fresh heart of palm, avocado, tatsoi, citrus soy) - This is seared tuna, marinated a bit in vinegar and ginger - also very good. I have never had tatsoi before - but it is quite good! Tastes and looks a bit like spinach but is better!  Seviches: (4) Salmon asparagus, red radish, pineapple, lime - quite good! 2nd fave of the four seviches. (5) Yellowtail jalapeno and lemongrass - Our table came to the consensus that this was the winner of the 4 seviches.  Perfect amount of spice from the japaleno, and just a bit of tang from the lemongrass - goes very well together with the hamachi! VERY good! (6) Tuna granny smith apple, serrano, lime - I did NOT like this one - the apple taste is awful in my opinion... Pass. (7) The last one had a very traditional Peruvian seviche taste - lemon, lime very simple, and good.  The type of fish they used escapes me now.. apologies.  Robata: (8) Sea bass and miso anticucho - sea bass pieces marinated with delicious miso on skewers - SO GOOD. The fish is very fresh and tender - and the miso is light, but very tasty!  It also comes with Peruvian corn kernels - which if you haven't had it - each kernel is about 5 times the size of a normal corn kernel, and is a bit meatier. YUM!  Large plates: (9) Toban Yaki organic mushroom, charred green onion, garlic chips, kobe beef! They split this in two bowls - which was strange because one bowl was better than the other. Not sure how much I liked this dish - the sauce was very heavy/creamy yet bland and lacked something. The other bowl had more tang to the sauce and was better - inconsistency - not good!  Mushrooms were yummy though!  Samba rolls: (10) El Toro (salmon, jalapeno, shiso leaf, fresh melted mozzarella, crispy onion): the fave of the bunch yet still not that great seeing as how it doesn't really \"count\" as sushi - melted mozzarella? come on. (11) Neo Tokyo yellowfin tuna, tempura flake, aji panca - this was a disappointment! The waitress called it the \"ultimate spicy tuna\" - but it was NOT spicy whatsoever.  She mentioned that they use a fresher version of tuna - not so when you order spicy tuna elsewhere (where they use the leftover bits of fish and mash it up). MEH, pass. (12) Veggie Kun avocado, tomato, arugula, oshinko, yamagobo, wasabi nori flake, tofu miso - PASS! Tastes fresh but dude - where's the fish!?  (13) CAN'T REMEMBER this last roll because I was SO FULL and couldn't have anymore!!!  This was SO much food - 70 per person. I'd pass on the rolls, and go for samplings of their other small dishes, seviches, skewers! 4 stars.",

The sea bass was great and just melts in your mouth. I enjoyed the pork belly ramen (spicy). Service was great by everyone. I inquired about cold sake and he offered Dewazakura Dewasansan Junmai Ginjo. It has a light and subtle fruity flavor. Very nice. He topped our evening off with a nice chocolate cake topped with ice cream in a maple syrup. Delicious. We will definitely back.",

Waiters were quick to respond and checked on us at the right times.  Water was always filled and food was delicious!  First off, YAMATO Roll....fatty tuna with foie gras and cavier with good flecks?  Heck yah!  How much more delicious can you get with this roll?  The Green Envy roll, and the Bobo Brazil were always very good!  The tuna tataki was also amazing.    For my birthday, they gave us a shot tree the bartender concocted for us.  Also another great drink was this drink with jalopengo in it.  I don't remember the name, but it was a nice kick!  :)  YUMMMM!  I can't wait to come back again!  Thanks sushisamba waiters and bartenders!",

We particularly liked that they don't use a lot of rice  in lieu of other ingredients like many sushi restaurants. We tried several dishes from the Happy Hour menu at $6 each:  Spicy Tuna Roll - good not not too different from other spicy tuna rolls we tried Shrimp Tempura Roll - good portions of shrimp tempura and not too greasy Salmon Sushi - great flavor with asparagus.  This was my mother's favorite. Japanese Style Salt and Pepper Squid - a bit salty but quite tasty.  Small portion. Yellowtail Seviche- two thinly sliced yellowtail with a tasty spicy sauce.  This was my favorite.  In addition, we ordered the California roll which was $14.  However,  they used real crab instead of imitation crab.  It was quite tasty with generous amounts of crab used.    The service was good.  The restaurant itself is dark with several televisions positioned around- they don't show sports just a program about sushi.  It would be even better if they had a television at the bar for sports.",

Conveniently located in the Palazzo shops, its great for a quick bite if you're staying at the Wynn or Venetian and don't want to walk too far.  The prices are reasonable and the quality of the food is very good. I was particularly impressed with the huge portion of grilled yellowtail cheek I got for what I paid.  The sauces that accompany their sushi rolls are quite interesting - mustard, ponzu and soy-based.   My one complaint, and it's a major one, is that I had to order sake THREE TIMES before I actually got a glass. My first and second choices were sold out, and it took the waitress 15 minutes between orders just to tell me this. Finally, when I picked a sake they hadn't run out of, there was not enough left in the bottle to constitute a full serving. I wasn't charged for it, but it was too little, too late. What I ended up drinking was far from what I was in the mood for.  If you sell sake by the glass, running out during the peak dinner hour in Vegas is unacceptable.",

Very professional- checked in on us often and even made some recommendations that were jaw dropping.

The music was upbeat- the bartenders were having a great time with their customers at the bar-- All in All, I love this place. I cant stay in Vegas and NOT come here.

The server made very clear to us how expensive the meal was going to be.  Yea, dude.  We can read the prices on the menu.  We all have smartphones and knew that this was a \"$$$\"+ place when we walked in.  It seemed he had made an assumption that we weren't going to spend a lot or tip well, and that was pretty annoying.    We didn't let him ruin our meal ...... but he could have done a lot to make it better.  I'd come back and give it a second shot, because the meal was THAT delicious.  Great fusion selections, really unique and fun food.",

    "text": "Who would have thought on a normal Tuesday night at 8pm, we would need a reservation? Sushi Samba proved us wrong. After our experience there, I now see why they have restaurants in some of the biggest cities in the world.   First of all they told us that we would have a 50 minute wait. As we were leaving to find another place, the hostess informed us that they could fit us at the counter. The \"counter\" is a raised area that looks out into the restaurant. I'm struggling to figure out how to describe it right now. It's a long table where everyone sits in a row- like a sushi counter- which overlooks the dining area. And you have to be very careful while sitting there. There's not much room and I doubt the people with spacious bench seats below us would appreciate a spilled drink. However, it was the perfect spot for people watching.   Service was a little slow. Hence, the 4 stars. It took a while for us to get refills on our drinks. The server came over once without us having to wave her down. But food was amazing. I recommend the serviche and taraditos (especially the tuna). The duck breast robata was also amazing. Between the 3 of us, we tried quite a few dishes and we were quite happy with all of them.   It is a little pricey, but I definitely think this is a great place to try at least once in Vegas!",

My boyfriend and I were feeling a little spendy that day, and I was very excited to try a higher tier, more expensive sushi restaurant. From the prices, I was expecting high quality, unique, delicious sushi. I was assuming that it would be their specialty judging from the name of the place. I ordered a few rolls that the waitress suggested and gyoza for dessert. The gyoza was in fact delicious, the best thing we ordered that night. The sushi and rolls however were mediocre, and the fish did not taste fresh. The presentation was nothing special, it did not even compel me to take a picture of it.  Not to exaggerate, but I've had better tasting and more beautifully presented sushi at local sushi places or even AYCE. Service was okay, the waitress wasn't THAT friendly, and we rarely saw her come by our table to check up on us. We were very disappointed. For the price we paid, we expected something much better. We are probably never going to come back.",

I ordered a couple of things, two different ceviches, one hamachi collar, and one whole roast fish (I was combining lunch and dinner budgets, because I was getting on a really long flight). I have to say, my server didn't bother trying to pace my food. The whole fish came right after the collar, and although they accommodated my request to take it back and keep it heated, it had definitely lost something. Minus one star for that, and the restaurant hadn't even become more than one-third full yet. Secondly, the two roast fishes were way too similar, even though the whole fish was advertised as having all kinds of goodness and was much more expensive than the simple collar. However, both ceviches were excellent and I suspect this place is much better at Latin-Japanese fusion than anything else (but what should I expect?). This place is probably worth exploring (and requires it), but you'll need a big wallet or some serious need to dine in cool locations. I would get my fix of this kind of cuisine elsewhere.",

We had a large party of 12, which can always be a challenge for a packed restaurant, but not here.  Our waiter was terrific and recommended family style meal and provided two options - w/o Kobe would run around $60pp, and with Kobe would run around $80-90pp.  We opted to go without (which I suggest based on our experience).  Boom - out comes the food.  The meal was around 3-4 courses and included cooked appetizers, sushi rolls, and beef / pork proteins.  Each course was fresh - hot dishes hot, cold dishes cold and tasted great.  The ribeye was a bit overcooked, but given how many they crank out, it wasn't a huge disappointment.  The experience here was a thousand times better than Mastro's the night before in terms of level of service, food quality, and how fast the dishes came out.  Definitely recommend this place (especially for large parties).  They did have a nice cocktail and sake menu.  Their mixed drinks were pretty good, but not stellar.  If you order shots here, they offer a very generous pour (which is great).",

Very different but intriguing menu. As we were trying to figure out what to order, this guy next to us told us to order this, this, and that - all of which was incredible.  Turns out the guy was the owner Matt who couldn't have been more gracious and hospitable.   Everything we ordered was superb and bursting with flavor.  The only warning I would give is that the flavors are quite intense and they stayed with me most of the night.  I'm sure the people next to me at the blackjack table were none too pleased.    After throwing my money away the evening before at Koi, this was a welcome find. Yes it's not cheap as previous reviewers stated, but being from L.A. I'm used to spending $$$ for quality sushi.  I am planning another Vegas trip in May and Sushi Samba will definitely be on the agenda.  Highly recommended.",

    "text": "I absolutely loved eating here. The atmosphere is great, cool decoration. The service was fantastic and our server was very friendly. I would list off everything we ordered, but there were five of us and I couldn't remember the names of half the things we ordered, let alone all the desserts (we ordered 3 sampler platters for dessert, so I'll just stick to a few. My father ordered one of the duck dishes, I don't remember which one since I didn't place the order, but it was fantastic. The duck was perfectly cooked and the sauce was a perfect complement to the natural flavors of the duck. The two rolls we ordered were the Samba Strip and the Bobo Brazil. The Bobo brazil was absolutely phenomenal. The seared kobe inside was of great quality and worked very well with all of the other ingredients. The Samba Strip was very different for me, as I had never had a roll with Lobster and was a little unsure, but I'm glad we went with it! I loved the way the peanut curry worked with the mango and the texture of the lobster. The most memorable part of the night, by far, was ordering the dessert. My girlfriend is from Brazil and one of her absolute favorite things is Brigadeiro. She was ecstatic to see it on the dessert menu in one of the dishes, because it is difficult to find a place that makes Brigadeiro (good or not aside, there just aren't many places that have it), especially where we live (AZ). She asked our server if she could just get a small plate of Brigadeiro by itself for dessert, and the server he would have to check with the chef. Here, though, they went a little above and beyond for me. Despite the Brigadeiro being listed only as an ingredient in a dish, the chef said that they would make a plate by itself, just for us. However, the chef wanted to inform us that it was not traditional brigadeiro, and even prepared a small sample for us to try before ordering a plate so that we wouldn't be disappointed if we were hoping for the traditional stuff. I can't find fault with service like that.  On a side-note, they have a dish that is cooked on a hot stone and comes out sizzling on that hot stone. I have no idea what it was called, but it was ordered repeatedly by other tables and smelled absolutely phenomenal. I would go back just to sit at the bar and be able to smell that dish being brought out to other tables.",

    "text": "I stopped by for lunch for my sushi fix while I was in town. Looking back I maybe should have ordered a la carte. Alas I took a gamble and ordered the sushi/sashimi combo. The service was prompt and courteous. The order arrived quickly, a little too quickly for sushi. The sushi and sashimi cuts were uneven, almost wedge or doorstop-like. And for $30 dollars, not plentiful. The accompanying roll was dry and did not appear freshly made, which may have explained the speed of delivery. The roll had cuts of fish in it which was a bonus. But the outside looked as it was dipped in green tea leaves giving it an unappetizing lichen or mossy look like something attached to a tree stump in a rain forest. Honestly I had a better sushi tasting meal for dinner consisting of seared tuna avocado, mixed greens, etc., in one of the casino restaurants in the same hotel. And it was half the price. This was by far my worst meal the whole week in Vegas.",

The sushi plate was oversized and lacking in real flavor.  Although the tempura rock shrimp were tasty, the flavors were overbearing.  The space is incredibly loud and distracting, to the point where you have to shout to communicate with the server.  It was if the idea of the restaurant was more interesting than the execution.  Still, if you don't mind spending the money for an interesting experience, the food is well prepared and the service is fairly attentive.  Definitely don't miss the whitefish taquitos and the miso-glazed sea bassa.",

I love the lively ambiance, and the service is wonderful. We decided to get the Omakase, and my favorite had to be the Chilean Sea Bass served with peruvian corn.  SOOOOO good.  Another favorite was the yellowtail taquitos. They're small but very delicious. The oysters and king crab legs were extremely fresh, and we also had a plate of sashimi in various sauces. The sauces were all citrusy (i.e. yuzu) and weren't for my taste but good nonetheless.  One drawback: too full for dessert.",

Our table was perfectly located near the front so we could 'see and be seen'  The atmosphere of the bar and restaurant was VERY lively (Labor Day wknd Saturday night) but we felt like they gave us very personalized attention every step of the way.   Our waiter , Matt, was a ROCKSTAR!  He dealt with all of the crazy $h!t we kept saying and doing to him with total grace.  Also, he let us mention our pricepoint per person as well as any culinary likes/dislikes/restrictions and we let him create a tasting menu for us.  Here's what we got for $40/person (that's right...40.  Crazy) Yellowtail ceviche taquitos- very tasty Tuna sashimi yellowtail sashimi king crab legs- always a hit spicy tuna roll + shrimp tempura roll + tuna/avocado roll Meat sampler platter w/ hanger steak + grilled pork sides of collard greens and peruvian corn miso glazed seabass skewers- AMAZING  And did I mention he also hooked us up with several rounds of amazing shots??  He even made sure they had non-alcoholic shots made for the girl in our group who couldn't drink...very accomidating.   I would definately go back there for the food and service.  A wonderful place to dine in a city full of great restaurants.",

When we finally got to our table our server was very knowledgeable with the cuisine because my husband loves to asks questions. We knew it was busy but we never felt rushed. The food was amazing my husband had the kobe beef cooked a hot stone which was incredible and I had the oolong bass skewers which was just as good!

I swear we must've had the smalled table that 11 girls squished into a booth and 3 chairs at the end?  Our martini glasses were spilling everywhere!  Drinks - they were REALLY slow in bringing these out to us.  And the cocktails we ordered were overly sweet.  Food - we ended up doing the tasting menu ($50pp that's without drinks and tip)  I have to say - it was good they catered to what we requested and taking into consideration any food allergies one may have.  One girl had allergies to avocado, so they made a serving especially for her that excluded it.  There was a serving for each person, to get a taste of everything.    The food was alot better than I expected.  Except there is this particular taste in the sushi, I wasn't quite sure what it was it was almost floral like, I wasn't a big fan of that, but other than that all the dishes were good, even the gyoza!    I would recommend this place to others for group dinners.",

It's Japanese and Brazilian fusion, which sounded exotic and awesome.  We had a reservation, and I am quite thankful for that. It was PACKED by the time we got there. The hostess seated us immediately. The tables were all a little close to each other, and you did sort of feel like you were sitting with a bunch of strangers!  Our waitress was awesome and knew the menu inside and out. She had some great suggestions (which we ordered).  We had the wagyu beef sashimi (which they had to make twice because they messed up the first time). It was delicious. Next, we had the pork belly, which was just ok. I don't think I'd get it again. Then we had the yellowtail ceviche tacos, which were amazing. Finally, we ordered two rolls, the bobobrazil and the neo tokyo. I loved both of them.  For dessert, we ordered the mochi. It was OUT OF CONTROL. By far the best mochi I have ever tasted.   I had prosecco and my boyfriend ordered a beer. It went well with our food.  I'm excited to try the location in Chicago!!!!",

We love the Palazzo and have never had a bad experience here and figured we couldn't go wrong.  However, this is my least favorite dining expereince I've had to the Venetian or Palazzo.  SushiSamba was having their happy hour on Friday 4-7.  We sat up at the bar and ordered off their happy hour menu.  We each decided to try the Caipirinhas.  I'd equate this to a Brazilian margarita.  I think the bartender said it has rum instead of tequila???  Not positive though.  She hands the drinks to us and says something to the effect of \"This isn't my favorite drink, but it gets the job done\".  We didn't ask her if it was a good, bad or indifferent drink.  We just wanted to try something off their happy hour menu that we'd never tried before.  I thought it was a rather odd comment to make.  Then when we tried it, we weren't crazy about it either.  If she was going to say something, she should've told us when we ordered.  Regardless, the drink kind of grew on us.  Didn't order a second and probably won't order the drink again, but it wasn't horrible.  As far as food, we tried the chicken anticuchos, shrimp tempura roll, salmon taquitos and yellowtail seviche.  Chicken anticuchos were good....basically a chicken skewer with teriyaki.  Shrimp tempura roll was average.  Salmon taquitos were kind of strange...if you do order these, make sure to put the spicy sauce on them.  Without the sauce, they aren't very good.  Last but not least, the dish I truly enjoyed was the yellowtail seviche.  The yellowtail was buttery and spicy all at the same time....very good.  All said and done, our tab was just under $40 before tip.  Not bad.  However, there was something about this place, I don't see myself ever coming back here.  Other than the yellowtail, nothing was that good.  Average to mediocre at best.",

I ordered a pomegranate martini and asked if they use Pom, and was reassured they did, but my martini tasted like perfume not pomegranate. After complaining to the waitress, the manager approached us and asked how can he make up and offered us some yellowtail sashimi, He brought over 4 thin pieces of sashimi, and after getting the bill we realized he charged us 22 dollars for the 4 pieces. Their sushi tasted like paper and cardboard, not fish. After spending 200 dollars among 2 couples and leaving there hungry, I was very upset. A total rip off!!!",

It's only in the bar area though so we had to wait a little bit for a seat or open area at the bar. Special fancy drinks for $6 and then also an assortment of appetizers for also $6 each. Each portion is tiny so  getting food for multiple people so it can add up. We tried the yellowtail (2 pieces in an order), spicy tuna roll, shrimp tempura roll, salt and pepper squid, and the enzo roll (I think that's what it called). The yellowtail was fresh and had a unique sauce (lemongrass) that it came with. The first two rolls and the squid were ok. And the enzo roll was my favorite. It had salmon and these crispy bits in it and was rolled in like a white rice paper instead of seaweed. For drinks we all tried the Fresca, which had muddled strawberries and a bunch of alcohols. I found it light, sweet and refreshing. All and all, a good place for a little something something before dinner. HH is definitely not enough for a full on meal and it's a little pricey but I guess better than a regular meal here.",

I am a sushi snob. I expect the best quality fresh fish. Good sushi for me typically is found in a coastal city where the fish is as fresh as it gets. If you are happy with decent fish with a slight odor and don't mind wasting your hard earned money, go to SushiSamba at the Palazzo.",

The Pork Belly Ramen was so good the meat just melted in your mouth and the broth was just spicy enough to give it a nice kick.  The Sushi was also great, quality.

    "text": "I ate here last week. I initially enjoyed the ambiance, the nice wait staff, and the wide selection of sushi, robata, and cocktails. However, our food and drinks were littered with inedible garnishes. One of our drinks contained inedible wood sticks and leaves, while the plate came with a side of hollowed out crustacean appendages.  While I understand that the harvested tree parts add to the flavor of the drink, the crustacean carcases added nothing to the plate other than to disgust their customers. It was sickening. I almost sent the food back, but I decided to give it a try.  Fortunately the food and drinks were decent. They weren't memorable in the sense that I will tell my friends and family about it, but the food and drinks were a good attempt at sushi, robata, and cocktails. I would give the quality of the food 3 stars.  However, when I spoke with the manager about the disproportionate amount of inedible food on the plate, he was extremely rude to me. Instead of explaining why the presentation was the way it was, he simply said \"this is the way we make it,\" and he walked away. Anyone in a customer service centric job can tell you this is the wrong way to respond to a custom complaint.  At the end of the evening my wife and I were left feeling that we were overcharged, under-served, and disrespected by the management. I could forgive the obvious technical errors with the food if the staff was more communicative, but the interaction I had with the evening under-experienced manager only added insult to injury, which is why I give this restaurant 1 star.",

    "text": "I came to this restaurant about a year ago for work related function.  At that time, my experience was very good, so I wanted to take my husband with me this time for him to experience the same.  When we got there, the hostess set us at a table and asked us to move again because they had a reservation for party of 4, so they had to sit them there.  There were other tables with 4 people seats available, but we agreed to move.  When I was here last time, the waiter was very nice and friendly and he had a good knowledge of the menu, especially the tasting menu options.  However, this time, we did not like our waitress.  When I decided to go there, I had tasting menu in my mind and I asked her to give me more explanations on that as I wasn't the one to order last time.   I am not sure if she was new to this place or not, but she seemed like she had no idea what the tasting menu entails or she didn't want to sell it.  She basically said that there are 3 courses and they can customize it if we had any preferences or allergies.  However, she did not say anything about what kind of foods will be on the tasting menu, whether they are from the regular menu vs off the menu items and even what kind of foods we will be served.  When I asked for difference between different tasting menu options, she basically said the quality of meat and fish are different.  Everything she said was very vague.    Although we still didn't really get much info that we wanted, since my experience last time was pretty good, we decided to do the tasting menu with the waygu hot stone bbq thing.  The few items that we got were tasty.  We liked wagyu dumpling and chilean sea bass with corns.  Their  ceviche taco thing was okay and we were not a big fan of the tuna appetizer that they brought out.  We got the wagyu bbq which I think is good to try it as a experience as the meat was tasty and it is a unique experience but I am not too sure if it is worth it to pay $128 for 4 oz wagyu to grill it on a hot stone.    After trying their tuna dish, We realized that we can have sushi in LA too, so we asked the waitress to suggest something unique to the restaurant rather than sushi or rolls which we can get other places for part of tasting menu as she said she can customize it for us. However, she couldn't really give us any suggestions or tell us how they can customize for us.  By then, we were not happy about the service and some of the foods that we tried, so we decided to cancel the tasting menu and pay for whatever we ate and left early.    Maybe my expectation was high for this place but I am really disappointed on their waitress' knowledge on their menu and some of the foods.  It was a very special night for us, so I really wanted it to be special but I have to say that dining at Sushi Samba definitely was not the highlight of our evening, rather more of a disappointment of the evening.  I saw every food item that we were served on the regular menu, so maybe it is better to stick with ordering off the menu rather than tasting menu and skip the wagyu hot stone bbq.  I won't be going back to this place in the future.  Foods: 2.5 stars Atmosphere: 3 stars Service: 0 star Overall Experience: 1 star",

    "text": "It was a good experience to try something new in sushi, but there was nothing that really stood out in taste that would make me return. We took a lot of the server's recommendations for popular items like the specialty dishes sea bass with Peruvian corn and Yellowtail Taquitos served like tapas, which were both good. The Peruvian corn was ok, but didn't seem to have a complimenting taste with the sea bass. We let the server know and he brought out some Purple Potato Mash just to try something different and it was better than the corn.   The service was great. Our server was very knowledgeable about the food, how it was prepared and the types of sake that was offered. We enjoyed 4 different sakes, which was more enjoyable than the sushi.   If you want to feel like you ate a lot, stick with mostly rolls... the rice will help fill you up.  Typical price for food in LV... $$$... although I didn't think we ordered that much and the cost was just short of the 200 mark for two.  Good Brazilian/Peruvian fusion... but if I had a choice between this and traditional sushi... obviously traditional.",

    "text": "A mixture of Japanese, Peruvian and Brazilian food.  We went to this restaurant as part of my friend's bachelorette dinner.  While I understand that a party of 30+ was a tad bit too much to handle, I think their staff should have been more prepared for us, considering a reservation was made.  We were all seated separately (understandable), but were under the impression also that we would all be able to order whatever we wanted from the menu.  Well, that night, the manager told the bachelorette that we had a fixed menu (which was not told to her at time of reserving), and that there was nothing he can do about it.  I mean, it might not be a big deal, but with our huge group paying this place a visit, the least they could have done was accommodate our party with what we expected initially (which is pretty much what anyone would expect of any restaurant if no special instructions were told--order what you please, as long as it's on the menu).    Yet, even with the misunderstanding that occurred in the earlier part of the evening, I can't complain much, as they did try to make it up to us.  Free appetizers for our party AND free shots.  Not too bad.   Food was amazingly super yummy.  And with all this..the bill nearing about $1400 & the craziness that my friend had to endure, we still managed to end on a good note at this spot.",

They switched out sauces, made replacements here and there, had gluten free soy sauce and acted like it was NORMAL, not like i was some crazy person. I heart Sushi Samba.",

    "text": "I had an amazing experience at Sushi Samba last night.  Fair enough, it wasn't packed so I'm sure it was easier to pay attention to us, but still.  It's not too often that you get Brazilian/Peruvian/Japanese food on one menu.  Our server Javier was fantastic - attentive, helpful, knowledgeable, fun, but not the least bit overbearing.  The manager Hayes was the same.  We felt like we were constantly checked on and attended to - quite luxurious. They helped us pick some amazing items off of the giant menu, and we were thrilled with all of the items we had. Tempura green beans, yellowtail tiradito, the samba strip roll (possibly our favorite), and the churrasco (we got hanger steak, pork tenderloin and linguisa). The cocktails.   Oh. My. God. The cocktails.   Amazing, fresh, delicious. . . . I had the monthly special (a strawberry mojito), and a lemon samurai which was seriously the most amazing drink I've ever had. My only gripe with things that are flown in fresh from all around the world - impressive yes, but the environment scowls in your general direction Sushi Samba.  Situated in the largest LEED certified building in the world (<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.commercialpropertynews.com%2Fcpn%2Fcontent_display%2Fregions%2Fsouthwest%2Fe3i76b446d81cf85aa4fc437cba15737e76&s=a44e68c24c44199749398dfbeef2e9b4acfb090bd4aa01a996488ee7e9bb3376\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">commercialpropertynews.c...</a>), you'd think this would be a faux pas.   Take advantage of it if your conscience allows - you won't be sorry.  The two of us got out after two cocktails each and the shared food mentioned for under $150.  Not bad for an upscale Vegas restaurant.",

First, the restaurant was filled with Wooting office groups clearly in town on expense accounts. The constant wooting after each shot grated on our nerves but would have been tolerable if not for the awful service. First, no menus were available, though our waitress tried to push an expensive tasting menu on us in their absence. Luckily, menus showed up and we ordered. We also wanted sake but barely any was affordable. We found a nice $34 bottle but was advised it was \"out\", of course but our kind server substituted another one without asking. Only problem it was half the size.  Server was rude and rushed and we tipped accordingly. On the plus side, the sushi was tasty.

I was at Sushi Samba for a party and they had passed apps which were great. Great sushi, great crab cakes, awesome skewers of beef...But mind you passed apps.  The drinks....amazing. As far as the Samba Juice. This is the only place in town I know that mixes with Acai berrys. Which give a unique chocolate hint to a blueberry flavor. Definitely high in antioxidents. But I came here for brunch with a friend.  Now I sat at the bar and we ordered drinks. She ordered the Pomelo...but they didnt't have any. So then the Cucumber. I had the Samba Juice again. I decided to order Churros because I LOVE HOME MADE CHURROS. Too bad I didn't get them. Grrr they took forever. I also ordered food to go. Feijoada, chorizo, linguisa(kinda portuguese sausage) and some peruvian corn which is like giant hominy.  Well the order was wrong because I ordered sides and  he asked me how I wanted my eggs. The bartender was really slow. I asked him some questions on why he was shaking a certain way and he said it was because they put egg whites in the drink. I explained a different method on how to make the drink that he won't tire himself out and he said \"No it's better my method\" LOL I asked him where he worked before and he said...\"Grand Lux Cafe\" Yea Nuff said. I didn't introduce myself to him because he was too hard headed in knowing what was right and wrong. So he fcked up my order, returned the Churros when I asked him for it to go, and then he stiffs me on eggs on the bill. Yea I'm gonna order from the table next time. I think brunch is for rookies.  The Feijoada was very....thick....the Chorizo and Linguisa with Hominy was delicious. They don't make it home made but they get it in Cali from this spanish place I know.  Over all drinks are good. But I guess the staff being not so bueno made me drop the score down a lil.",

I know they have 3 different cuisines, but my review is just for the sushi because that is what I tried.  I went here with my husband. We LOVE sushi. We overdo it sometimes. We are the type of people who will have sushi 1-2 times a week so we know what's good or bad and when it is fresh etc.  The fish was fresh no doubt.  The prices were okay considering the quality of the fish. That being said the rolls were not special.  The flavors did not compliment each other or the fish.  We had three cut rolls and one hand roll and didn't even finish them. The hand roll was great but the cut rolls (sorry don't remember the names) were very boring. The flavors were simple or overpowering each other. Non of the rolls stood out even the one the server recommended (he said it was one of their best).  The service was great!",

We made reservations, though we probably didn't need to because we went early, and the staff that greeted us was great. The dining area beautiful. It was modern and fun. Our server was fantastic, informative, he gave suggestions, and was always easy to find and flag down. The Miso Soup was really good. Who knew you could elevate a miso soup. I got a few different sushi rolls and the Sasa Handroll that unique and flavor full. I would recommend SushiSamba to everyone visiting the north end of the Strip.",

Food sampled: Yellowtail seviche tacito and lobster tacito were both excellent. Great fatty tuna otoro sashimi: delicious but $16 a piece... Seafood robata: half grilled lobster, yellowtail skewer with corm, grilled scallops.  Good cocktails, friendly staff.",

Very far and few in between, you'll stumble across the \"sensibly\" smart... who could hold their own, but isn't too far removed from the average person.  This is where Sushi Samba comes in.  Sushi Samba isn't by any means authentic Japanese cuisine, but you'll leave there with the impression that you had a quality dinner without the ostentatious price.   In other words, if your objective in Vegas isn't a foodie adventure, but you still want to have a decent dinner...go here.  Without further delay, we ordered lots of dishes between the 6 of us, but I'll highlight the ones worth mentioning:  Cevice- Salmon asparagus, red radish, pineapple, lime 13.00 (4 STARS)  Duck Breast and Ginger Sweet Soy (aka Duck Tacos)   14.00  (4.5 STARS)  Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass roasted organic vegetables and oshinko 29.00  (4 STARS)  El Topo salmon, jalapeno, shiso leaf, fresh melted mozzarella, crispy onion 14.00 (4 STARS)  Cassava Carrot Cake brown butter ice cream, cinnamon cream, rainbow carrot chip, orange reduction 9.00.  YUM!!!  Seriously..just try it, even if you're not a carrot cake person. (5 STARS)  =================  Dinner total:  $120 a person  Altogether, what i loved about this place was their dipping sauces.  They weren't shy about adding the heat, something a spicy food lover like myself could definitely appreciate.",

We had reservations for 9:00PM after the Las Vegas Marathon so my runner friends could get a nice recovery meal that wasn't too heavy.  And that wasn't too far away from their hotel!  We were seated right away, and the vibe of this restaurant was really fun and funky- dark and romantic but with lots of good music.  We decided to split a bunch of small plates which ended up being perfect.  We started with the Crispy Yellowtail Taquitos which were so delicious, but small enough that they left me wanting more!  The tempura mushrooms were light and flavorful with just the right amount of crispiness.  The chicken skewers were YUM but the highlight of the meal was the seabass skewers.  I had these in Dallas and they were every bit as delicious as I remembered.  Love the peruvian corn too.  Normally each order of skewers comes with 2, which would have led to a caveman-style meat fight between the 3 of us, but our server was kind enough to suggest we add a third skewer to the order so we all got to try.  Great service on her part.  We also had 2 of their special sushi rolls- The Pacific Roll and the Green Envy.  Both were very good and tasted very unique, as opposed to a lot of \"special rolls\" you find out there that are just bigger and they charge more for.  All in all, I was very pleased with this meal and would definitely like to go back in the future... but there's so many places to try in Vegas that its hard to commit!",

    "text": "Absolutely loved this restaurant from the unique fusion of Japanese, Brazilian and Peruvian food, the fun decor, attentive but not overly attentive wait staff, pretty much everything.  Our server, Carmine, gave us a choice of having him choose our dinner selections for us, which we always love because they usually know what most customers like. He asked us for a price range (which we clearly went over but totally worth it) and what we liked and disliked. From there, he chose 2 small plates, sashimi and sushi, and 2 types of robata.  Everything was amazing but our favorites were the 2 small plates, the yellowtail taquitos (small tacos) and wagyu beef gyoza. We liked the taquitos so much that we requested another order. I also enjoyed the yellowtail sashimi and just loved the lemongrass sauce. The sashimi is so fresh and just melts in your mouth like butter. Out of the two samba rolls, I liked the Neo Tokyo better. The Lima is like a very basic california roll and I wish we were able to try something like the Samba Strip instead. The sea bass robata was definitely better than the duck breast. Honestly, we were hesitant of trying duck again because we both aren't fans of duck. We told Carmine that we would try it anyway and have confirmed our dislike for duck. Although the flavor was great, it's more of a texture thing for us.   Lastly, we had the pavlova and sata andagi for dessert. I thought it would be too much as the server also brought out some celebratory ice cream lollipops since it was our anniversary (Thank you, Carmine!), but we always have room for more dessert. I would skip the sata andagi as they're nothing special. Simple sugary donuts filled with chocolate. The pavlova was interesting and delicious. I was hesitant to try the sake infused berries but they were amazing paired with the sweet cream.   Happy to give this place a great review and can't wait to return!",

The restaurant was not too busy at this hour, and I probably could have walked in with no wait, regardless of my reservation. The ambiance and decor are spectacular! There is heavy Japanese and Brazilian influence in the art and it was beautiful.   We were served by Chris, who was very accommodating. He thoroughly explained the specials and the Omakase (chef's choice). We were pleased to learn that they could customize the Omakase courses to our preferences and he gave me a projected price before we committed to the 4-course meal. I let Chris know that my girlfriend prefers crab, ikura, and scallops. We received 2 appetizers, a sashimi platter, rolls, and then dessert. The chef covered all of our requests and we were impressed with how fresh and delicious the fish was. The dessert was a play on apple pie. It was unique, creative, and DELICIOUS! Each course was 10/10, and service was excellent as well.   I checked the menu prior to arriving, and had a plan for what I would order. The Omakase allowed us to try options that we would not plan to order, but thoroughly enjoyed. I highly recommend this for first timers!  After leaving, I recommended this restaurant to a friend, who tried to walk in for dinner. The wait around 8:00PM was really long, and they ended up eating elsewhere. I recommend coming for a high caliber lunch or making a reservation well in advance if you must come for dinner.",

We ordered the Sasa handroll.  It was tasty, but the quinoa was a weird spin. The yellowtail taquito was very very tiny but had some interesting flavors.  The seared waygu beef was unappetizing.  Choose a different mushroom please, not one that looks like little maggots on my raw beef.  The \"gelee\" made my stomach turn.  This dish was so gross.  The vegetable dishes were fine because how hard is it to screw up a vegetable. We ordered shisto peppers, edamame, heirloom tomato salad, and vegetable tempura.    Very meh.  Prefer Nobu",

This restaurant is located in The Palazzo Hotel and is somewhat reserved where reservations are compulsory.   We always end up at the bar since we never remember to do reservations.   The service is always warm and friendly although the hostess seemed a bit dishevelled this last visit.  The drinks are well made. Their cocktails are always yummy ...  They are a bit pricey(to be expected)   My problem was with the food quality. I was really disappointed in their spicy tuna and we ordered a few small plates which was more like tiny plates.   It was difficult for us to find a favorite treat this time. The pork sliders were great but at 5.00 a pop I expected more. All meals seemed to be hastily prepared and for the prices being charged, it was a little disappointing.  I know they can do better so I do look forward to my next visit. To be continued!",

Got our checks right after we requested them, and payment was really quick and nice.  Environment: 3/5 I really don't like how the tables are SO close to each other! It was quite tight between tables and somewhat uncomfortably close to the couple next to us. There's so much space in this restaurant, is it possible to space them out a bit?   Food: 4/5 wagyu dumplings were hands down our favorite. We wished we had gotten another order! They were absolutely delicious, and since most of the dumplings we're used to are filled with pork and veggies, this one was a great and new taste. The chicken teriyaki was delicious as well, great to share! The purple potato mash is SO soft and addictive--I'm still thinking about it! The hand rolls seem like something you can pass. They were delicious but definitely can be attained at a cheaper sushi restaurant.   Overall great experience, if you throw the prices out the door!",

I requested to sit at the counter hoping to catch Chef John in action. To my disappointment, however, the area that the sushi chefs are in is much higher than the bar seating, so I wasn't really able to see anything.  The taste of the food, however, completely made up for this!  Sashimi Tiradito (order a la carte of all four!) - All of the fish was very fresh, and presentation was on point! - Yellowtail - Jalapeno and lemongrass; the taste was simple and clean! - Kanpachi - Yuzu, sea salt, black truffle oil, chive, garlic; this one was my favorite! Something about the citrus, salty, and savory combo was just perfect! - Tuna - Granny smith apple, Serrano, lime; I really like the tartness from the apple. It complimented the tuna well. - Salmon - Kinkan honey, garlic ponzu, garlic chip. The honey was a nice unexpected touch, and you can't go wrong with garlic ponzu!  El Topo - Salmon, jalapeno, shiso leaf, crispy onion, spicy mayonnaise, fresh melted mozzarella, eel sauce. We decided to try this roll since mozzarella on sushi sounded interesting and unique. Get this if you want something different!  Sao Paulo - Scallop, masago, red onion, tuna, salmon, shrimp, whitefish, avocado, truffle, hacho miso soy, chimichurri. So many good things in one roll, right?! I really loved having such a variety of fish. Furthermore, the addition of the chimichurri brought a nice fusion flavor to the roll. Beautiful presentation as well!",

Our waiter explained that they can do a tasting menu ranging from $80-$150 (you tell them what you're comfortable spending, food allergies, and dislikes).  We chose this option and had some great courses.  The scallops and Chilean sea bass were our favorites, but everything was delicious.

This is an sushi fusion restaurant with some sushi and South America dishes. If you are coming for sushi you will be disappointed. And boy was I right about the prices. Nigiri/ sashimi starts at $5 and that is for one piece. I at least thought when I ordered it would be a big slice. I was dismayed when the slice was about the size you'd see at an all you can eat place. As for the roll, it was small as well.   With my sushi I ordered a beer. My food came about 5 minutes before the beer. I wasn't even able to get buzzed to take the edge off of seeing such small portions. My waiter only checked on me once during the meal at the beginning. I couldn't even get another beer if I wanted.   As for the atmosphere there are 1980's natural geographic  videos playing of South American dances and Japanese dances. In the background you here the bass of drums which made me feel like I was in an Indiana Jones movie. On the one TV playing ESPN it looked as if it was standard definition, blurry and had a green blue across the middle.",

The dish was nicely plated and the colors were pretty.  The ramen broth had nice flavor, although the accompaniment beyond the slab of sliced pork belly was a little sparse. The sweet boiled egg added some texture and richness above and beyond the fatty pork belly that had a bit of sweet sauce (teriyaki-style?) on it. That was maybe a missed opportunity to add some spice by putting a chili sauce on that instead of contributing more sweetness to the dish? I have eaten a lot of ramen at many places and the noodles in this dish were about average. Nothing set the noodles apart and they could have been from a package as far as I could tell, but it was a big bowl and I left the lunch table full and happy. (Sure, I ordered *ramen* at a *sushi* place... I didn't expect the noodles to be a star.)",

Loved the presentation and for a group of 3, definitely a nice appetizer. Loved the sauce for the fried green beans. The samba sushi and Neo Tokyo were simply okay to us. The quality of the sushi was okay but the flavors never really stuck out as distinct. The uni as well (which we ordered separately) was pretty okay as well yet just didn't have the same fresh quality we would have at another sushi restaurant. For the cost (for three people, being around $400+), it just didn't exactly match up completely for us.   Would love to come back and try some of the more fusion items which seemed definitely more interesting. Just for the food itself, it was just okay.",

Evening came along and everyone craved sushi so we decide to try what was right in our hotel.  As we were walking in, it did not give away as a high end nice place at all, so I was sceptical. But holy cow, do not judge a book by its cover!!!  The food was out of this earth! The sushi so fresh, the korean BBQ cooked on a piece of rock right on the table was to die for! The waiter even surprised the ladies with some original cocktails (they loved every one of them)  We ordered so much food, I thought they are about to run out fish no joke. It was 12 of us and I must say we eat! and eat a lot!   After a nice $1400 bill and full stomachs we got up (barely) and went on to explore the sin city! Will I go back again................you bet you! Will I order so much, maybe not lol but everything is so good, you might become a victim or your own stomach fighting with your brain and sending the wrong signals like it did to us! Enjoy!!",

Here's what we tried: ***Seared wagyu beef - Very good, but not amazing.  ***Tuna Tatake - So fresh with bright clean flavors- definitely try this. ***Rock shrimp tempura - Sauce was tasty but tempura was really heavy. Everyone else at our table loved this dish though. ***Sea bass w/ Peruvian corn - I think this is really popular, but our fish was really really dry. Least favorite item we tried. ***Crispy Yellowtail Taquitos - Really yummy bite sized goodness.   Can't wait to go back and try more menu items. The restaurant was super packed when we went and it was pretty loud - so not ideal for a quiet romantic date, but definitely fun if you're going with a group.",

    "text": "SUSHISAMBA is a Japanese / Brazilian / Peruvian fusion restaurant located deep inside the Grand Canal Shoppes (inside The Venetian and The Palazzo) and there are three additional locations (Miami Beach, New York City, London). It originally started in New York City in 1999 and I will tell you that not many restaurants offer such a unique combination of Asian / South America fusion cuisine quite like this.  I came here for lunch without a reservation and the restaurant was pretty empty, so I was able to get a seat at the sushi bar. I reviewed the menu and most of items were pretty pricey. Special rolls range from $10 to $26, tonkotsu ramen is $20, each small plate (e.g. taquito, gyoza, etc) is at least $10, and robata (meats, seafood, vegetable, and antichuchos) ranges from $7 to $19.  ***  Sea Bass Antichucho (miso and Peruvian corn, $17): A bit too much of miso glaze and tasted slightly salty, but sea bass itself was very good. Peruvian corn tasted pretty chewy and it was a pretty filling food. (4/5)  Sao Paulo (scallop, masago, red onion, tuna, salmon, shrimp, whitefish, avocado, truffle, hacho miso soy, chimichurri, $24): $24 sushi roll ... that's enough money for an AYCE sushi! If I can ignore the price, then I do think it was one of the better sushi rolls I've had in a very long time. Fresh fish and good flavors. (4.5/5)  ***  Great food quality, but portions are pretty small and prices are expensive. Without bring your friends / family and share the food, the total cost can get out of control if you decide to dine here alone. Just be prepared to leave slightly hungry unless you are going to order more than $40+ worth of food.",

We were given the quick rundown on how they can customize a dining experience for you, but we opted to choose a few items off of the menu to share. Everything was fresh and flavorful. Service started a bit slow, but picked up after our initial order was placed.   This was our second visit to Sushisamba. Both have been impressive regarding food and service.",

Came with a big group and had excellent service from the start. You tell them how much you want to spend per person and they ask you what fish you like/dislike and ask about allergies (someone in our group was allergic to shellfish and they were very attentive throughout dinner and mindful of that). Then they start bringing out the goodness in courses. We ended up spending about $60 a person (not including alcohol), and we were all comfortably full, however the portions are small. This is a great restaurant for special occasions! And OMG Sea-bass skewers,...",

He told me to tell the waiter how much we each wanted to spend and for then to bring us a tasting menu of sorts. Unfortunately, my wife doesn't like truffle anything, masago or mushrooms. Each of those ingredients were scattered throughout the menu so we just ordered of the menu.  We made reservations and were promptly seated. We started off with the yellowtail taquitos and the Wagyu beef gyozas. Each had an amazing flavor to itself, the yellowtail definitely had a citrus flavor by a yuzu or ponzu sauce but I couldn't put my finger on it. It came with a side sauce that when added, definitely gave it a kick. I would highly recommend both of those appetizers to start.  We shared the heirloom tomato salad and a Lima roll which was pretty basic and nothing special. We each had an order of Sasa handrolls which was amazing and also a must have if you're there. We finished our dinner with a samba split dessert which was amazing.  They have the most extensive sake and Japanese whiskey collection I've ever seen but we stayed away this time from experimenting. This is a must visit when at the Palazzo in Vegas. Too bad it's dimly lit and each time I tried to take a pic, it didn't do it any justice so I gave up. The service is fast and friendly and they can easily accommodate large parties if you have one. Enjoy!",

He also was fast, friendly, and attentive.  This was my second time there and we will be back with every Vegas trip.  Great food/service and such a fun atmosphere.  Thanks so much Rannah and crew!",

We were all full by the 2nd course and the food was so good!  The waygu potstickers melted in your mouth and the sushi was unique and some thing different then I have had before (and I eat a lot of sushi).  And make sure you try the sea bass, I don't know how they cook it but it was literally the best thing I have ever had!  I liked the fact they didn't try to hurry you out the restaurant and just let you enjoy the food.  Would go back in a heart beat!",

We specifically came here for the happy hour but were told after being seated, happy hour menu is at the bar only. You mean the 15 seat bar? We don't drink so I declined. Not to forget, it's no where stated on the menu... Our mediocre late night snack came to $70....  Should stuck to my rule of only dining where the locals go.   Salt and pepper squid- good. Not overly fried. Lime was nice touch.  Samba strip, salmon avocado and spicy tuna... nothing fancy and have had way better.",

I ordered the 5 oz. portion option for the four of us ($32 per oz). It is served along with a very hot stone so one can cook the beef on the stone to one's liking. The server demonstrated how to cook it and we all fully enjoyed it. The beef melts in the mouth!",

Definitely one of my favorites :)  I went to SushiSamba for lunch on my last couple of visits, and both times there was plenty of seating available, including their large comfy booth seating.  My go-to's here are their field green salad, rock shrimp tempura, shrimp tempura roll, and yellowtail jalapeno roll (about a $50 bill for 2 people and definitely a filling meal).  On previous dinner visits, I also had their yellowtail jalapeno and miso-marinated Chilean sea bass.  The food is quite tasty at this restaurant, and service is pretty good.  Our water glasses never go empty, and last time we had a cutie of a busboy clearing our table.  Also on our last visit, we had someone, whom I assumed was the manager, come to our table to drop off a complimentary scallop appetizer which was absolutely delicious.  What a nice touch, and as if I didn't already have enough reason to like this place so much!",

Samba Juice is my favorite especially on a hot summer day.  This place is a little pricey but is well worth the splurge. I don't know where else you can find this type of fusion!  Our favorites are: -Berkshire pork belly -Sea Bass miso -Neo Tokyo roll -Yamato roll -BoBo Brazil roll -El Topo roll  Add this to your bucket list!",

They have late night happy hour with drinks, rolls & appetizers for $6 till 1am on weekdays and 2am on weekends. The rolls are really decent too. Since we are regulars i have a couple of favorites - El Toro & Lima rolls..one word YUM! The managers here are pretty attentive every time i have visited and they have always given us complimentary scallops served on the shell..pretty neat. The bartender Louie was helpful too with recommending drinks during happy hour since usually i am already walking in buzz from the casino floor and didnt really have an opportunity to try their cocktail drinks till now.  This is my usual spot for late night munchies or a quick lunch/dinner every time i am here so i will always be coming back to satisfy my sushi craving or my late night munchies at 1am!",

We got a few apps, and sushi and then splurged on the wagyu that you can cook on the hot rock. The only thing that was slightly disappointing was the Peruvian corn that came with the skewers, some kernels were undercooked and temp was only slightly warm. Regardless meal was great. Might be our most expensive meal yet lol. They even gave us a complimentary dessert being a special occasion. Will definitely try to eat here again next time we are in town.",

    "text": "I love this place. Great atmosphere, food is yummy, drinks are creative and the service was on point. I'm always apprehensive when I dine with a large group, no matter where I am. This was no exception since I came with a group of 20. We had a long table in the back of the restaurant where I believe they do karaoke. Service was great. They had several people satelliting around the table getting our drinks, refilling water, taking used plates etc. We did a omakase style and had several waves of food hit the table. It was all beautifully presented and delicious! Some favorites of my were the shishito peppers- they had a nice blistered skin and were sprinkled with salt. The beef gyoza with kabocha puree melted in mouth. I had to snag another one! It was one of the best things I ate. The crispy yellowtail taquitos had a spicy foam on the side, nice crunch and clean flavors. The miso sea bass is so buttery and almost caramelized on the edges. It came with a side of Peruvian corn that was so delicious! You know you're a chop stick master when you can scoop more than one of those kernels into your mouth at a time! By this point I was stuffed- but they still brought out a variety of steaks, thinly sliced with rice and beans. Also a wave of sushi rolls and then some mochi balls for dessert.  The perfect meal here (for me) consists of the shishitos, gyoza and then the sea bass. My mouth is watering just thinking about this!  I wouldn't hesitate to come back here. Bring a huge party or belly up to the bar. You won't be disappointed.",

    "text": "Jason, you are THE MAN! Thank you for making both this time and last time an incredible experience.  Returned a month or so later, eager to try it out again next time I came back to Vegas.  I think this round somehow exceeding my experience last time. I got a lot of the same dishes, as well as tried out a few new ones and I was not dissapointed.  Our waitress was incredible and service was quick and enjoyable...even the parties next to us had a great time and sparked great conversation. The ambiance is hip and sexy while still being inviting and enjoyable.  In addition to last time, we got the Chuchumber cocktail which wasn't too sweet but amazingly refreshing. We also got the phyllo-wrapped scallop which at first I assumed would take away from the taste of the scallop but instead the combination of textures was just awesome.   We wanted to try one of the Peruvian ceviches, so we went with the ginger/soy yellowfin one, which was pretty tasty but not quite up on the same level when it comes to crazy flavor profiles.   The other new dish we got was the Samba Strip roll. As somewhat of a sushi afficianado, I was excited to try it but not expecting a whole lot. Crazy enough the lobster and mango combination with the peanut curry sauce was really crazy good. The roll also was made with some crispy rice and served with a meaty lobster claw so it was a solid choice.   The sea bass, sashimi, and little kobe taquitos were just as good as I remembered them and was not let down.  Thank you to everyone at Sushi Samba for making it such a great second experience. I've already sent a number of friends over and I will definitely continue recommending more your way.",

    "text": "I was pleasantly surprised by Sushi Samba.  It was kind of a last choice for our big bachelorette party of 18 girls.  At first I was like... eh, I can try that in NY.  And you're always taking a gamble with Asian Fusion.  But, we knew the bride liked sushi and so we eventually caved.  Here is the breakdown of my experience at Samba:  Decor/atmosphere - dark, swank, very appropriate for the occasion.  They sat our party in the back room where no one else was seated.  That was nice.  We had privacy for the first hour or so of our meal.  The air conditioning was cranked up way too high but they said they turned it down.  I don't think they did.  I damn near lost my toes trying to keep blood flowing to the extremities.  Service - friendly, cute staff of slow-talking Brazilian boys.  They're good but something tells me they were hired as eye candy rather than for their perfect waiting skills.  As we sat down they asked if we wanted flat or sparkling water - don't you hate when restaurants do that and trick you into buying overpriced bottled water?  I specifically clarified \"tap\" after some of the girls said flat and they still brought out about 7 bottles all opened and ready to pretty much pour straight into our throats.  That was my one big complaint of the night.  Oh yeah, and I also asked them to box up some leftovers for us to take, which they never did.  Food - surprisingly yummy.  We had a 7-course pre-fixe which included a shrimp appetizer, organic greens salad with carrot-ginger dressing, giant sushi platter, miso sea bass, teriyaki chicken over purple mashed potatoes, beef carpaccio(?), chocolate bread pudding and finally a tres leite (I have no idea what this is but it was delicious). The highlight for me was the sea bass.  Very similar to a miso black cod or butterfish.  I loved the chicken.  Usually, I'm indifferent to teriyaki but it was moist and so unique with the creamy potatoes.  The beef dish was like a beef tataki - very rare (almost raw) and with nice acidity.  Desserts did not disappoint at all - I'd say it was actually a highlight of the meal.  Well done, Sushi Samba.  You were way overpriced but I have to admit I enjoyed myself.",

With that being said, I went with a group of about 10 girls and it took 20 minutes after being seated for them to recognize that we were there, and that was after we asked a server walking by. They definitely made up for it with free drinks and appetizers but it was disappointing and it should have never started out like that. From then on the service was pretty good but they ended up forgetting to bring a few dishes out, and somebody found hair in their food. Overall the food was great and they apologized and made up for the wasted time but the experience could have been better.",

While I was eating my meal, I realized that the cuts of sashimi were very thin and small.  Unusually so.  I was sitting at the sushi bar and there was a guy sitting a couple of seats away from me.  After I was done with my meal, he asked me what I thought of it.  I said that I enjoyed it, but did mention the sashimi size concern I had.  He replied, saying that was his experience as well.  My grandmother used to say.....'if enough people say it, its got to be True'.  Grandma Ethel was a smart cookie.  It's unfortunate as this impacted an otherwise nice dining experience.",

If being surrounded by a room full of beautiful women is not appealing to you, then by all means you should bypass Sushi Samba.  I think I had flashes of falling in love a half dozen times.    On to the food... I started out with the robata grill yellowtail.  It was not what I had expected.  Basically I got a charred piece of fish that I had to pick through the bones of, which isn't easy to do with chopsticks.  I wouldn't say the robata grill was a disaster, but I wouldn't order it again.  To the rescue came a plate of the tuna takati.  This was an exceptionally flavorful small plate, and I do mean small.  I think it was 5 small slices of tuna.  A couple of more slices of tuna would have been nice, but the flavor was exceptional.  The topper to the meal was the BoBo Brazil roll.  This roll is something you'd want to photograph before you eat.  The flavor was very good.  I liked the kobe beef on the outside of the roll both for the flavor and the appearance.  Really a very good roll.",

The first time I went to Sushi Samba was back in early August, and my date and I tried the calamari appetizer with plantains and that was tasty.  The big hit of the night though were my Nina Fresa cocktails and the chocolate fondue.  They were absolutely fabulous! The Nina Fresa cocktails were nice and fruity and gave me a helluva buzz. ;)  I enjoyed the ambiance of Sushi Samba so much that I went a second time with my girls during Labor Day Weekend and we were seated in the dining area that later transformed into SugarCane Boutique Lounge after 11 pm.  Our sexy Latin waiter, Jaiver, was very nice and oh-so-hot too! He was very helpful in explaining to us about the different dishes.  For appetizer, we went with Tuna Tataki which was melt in your mouth good! Then, for entree, we tried the Brazilian Churrasco, which was very good too, particularly the dipping sauces that went with the meats.  Oh yes, we also ordered the Cocktail Tree which was awesome! All in all, Sushi Samba was very nice.  I also love the Brazilian/Latin infused house music that played while we were dining.  I would definitely go back again!",

We ordered practically everything on the menu. The stand outs were the quinoa risotto, fresh uni, oysters. Although we didnt have too much of their signature maki's we ordered a lot of sashimi and it was all very fresh and beautifully presented.

Though the food isn't cheap and the portions aren't big.....everything that I ordered was delicious and well worth the money.  I would recommend everything I ordered for those that are going there.   Here's what I ordered for 2 people: 1) sea bass and miso antichucos....the Peruvian corn that comes with it was quite tasty 2) agedashi tofu....3 fried tofu, 1 asparagus and 1 mushroom in some sort of sauce.  this was probably the most normal item that we ate on the menu....but it was still good. 3) bobo brazil samba roll.  this was quite interesting...seared kobe beef roll. 4)  some sort of spicy tuna roll.  the tuna was high quality...VERY FRESH! 5) Peruvian hot chocolate....this was DAMN good!  The drink was thick and very creamy. 6) Mango honey crisp taquito.    thinking of the food makes me drool wishing i could have it again.   the service there was EXCELLENT!  waiters clean your table and fill your water before you even have to ask.  they were very attentive and not smothering.  BE AWARE though...right when you sit down they ask you if you'd like some edamame.  you think this would be free....but you will later find out that you're being charged for it.    Sushi Samba is a definite must!",

The Las Vegas location is somewhat more showy than its original New York location, but given the competition of flashy restaurant decor in the new Las Vegas, this facility is a little overdone. Graffiti is sprayed about and swirled architectural accents are overly prominent.   The sushi is fresh and the entrees inventive, we'll return on a future visit.",

Food was excellent - we ordered three rolls to share amongst four ppl for a few bites around.   Our table featured:  * Green Envy * Bobo Brazil  * and one other...  The table was split for favorites between Green Envy and Bobo Brazil! Drinks featured were  * trusty Sapporo  * house Pinot Grigio - very light and dry * Samba Juice - thank goodness for the dim lighting because it seemed to have been a disgusting color...  Sushi was delicious. Music was way too loud. I'd come back for another glass of house wine and a roll before heading out to the clubs, but I wouldn't spend my money here on dinner. Let's not forget that Nevada is land-locked, you shouldn't be paying that much for sushi that isn't SUPER fresh.   The results: Price: Expensive for sushi that's not ocean-side Atmosphere: Good for pre-gaming/snack before the MAIN event Overall: not too shabby!",

    "text": "Sushi Samba is amazing!   Forget trying to order from the extensive menu.  Instead, just tell your Server the type of Sushi or Sashimi you like, your level of \"experimentation\", and your price range.   They will bring you wonderful dishes that you won't find on the menu!   Alice was our Server, and she is great!   I highly recommended the Japanese Tacos and Kobe Beef Surf & Turf.  Your eyes will roll back in your head with pure ecstasy!   Note: Bring about $200 or more (for two people).  It's not cheap, but I would rank this meal as a top 10 of all time!",

We had to wait almost an hour for a table but it was understandable considering the giant CES conference was going on. The Amazonian roll for vegetarians was awesomeeeeee. Even though the place was extremely busy our waitress was on point.   We ordered the veg tempura this time and weren't exactly thrilled about it but weren't disappointed either. Could've done without it. Avocado roll was good and the seaweed salad came with three different types of seaweed. Till next time!",

I would stay away from the Samba Strip roll, bland, boring and bucks at $19 for SIX pieces.  What!?!?  Fine, I don't mind paying up the nose when it's good, but this was not the case.    My gf and I ADORED the $5 taquitos, both the savory and the sweet.  Check them out!  2 savory taquitos 1 cocktail 2 glasses of sake 1 roll 1 sashimi plate 2 sweet taquitos  Again, I must stress, uncommonly small portions if you're ordering ala carte, and pricey, it was 'round $120 for 2pp for an after flight 'snack'.",

But this combo it tasted more Panda Express than the promised Fogo-de-Ceviche-Tokyo.  Lunch was over $100 for the two of us. Neither of us had drinks and we both left a little hungry.  I tried the 'Yamato roll' which had foie gras, gold flecks, and fresh tuna. Sounded good, but then to my horror, they slathered teriyaki sauce over the whole combo!   I then ordered the organic chicken skewer (Robata-style) with a side order of coconut rice. Again, the chicken was covered in some sugary yellow..something. And the rice was doused so heavily in coconut..something, that it was nearly risotto.    The plain nigiri sushi pieces (salmon, salmon roe, and the tuna handroll) were fine, but not extraordinary. The yellow tail sashimi came waddled in something I can only describe as orange and tasted like plain Japanese curry sauce.  At least the decor, like everything Vegas, is unashamed and unaware over-the-top, (which i kind of enjoyed) and the service was friendly and prompt.  I just wished this popular Vegas spot fused these cultural ideas together better and with a little more subtlety. That's the moment I realized I just used the words 'subtlety' and 'Vegas' in the same thought. My bad.",

    "text": "Right off the bat I have to say this was a disappointment for us. I read the reviews and was a bit surprised after excitedly rushing here our first night in Vegas. We made a reservation for 8pm and the restaurant was not busy at all. We asked to sit at the sushi bar and after we were seated were told we could not order from the chefs directly, which is absurd for folks from Los Angeles. The food should not be called sushi, it it is more of a fusion experience. We ordered - rock shrimp appetizer, Lima roll, lobster roll and a side of roasted vegetables. The food lacked any distinct flavor profiles and was very expensive. The rock shrimp appetizer was good, but comparable to other rock shrimp appetizers with a basic aioli sauce on a bed of spring greens. The Lima roll was so basic, a crab mix over a basic roll. The Lobster roll looked the most exotic but the flavor profile was bland and lack luster. The service was decent but they got very defensive when we asked why we couldn't order from the sushi chefs. Unfortunately, I think folks that do rave about this place have not had very amazing sushi experiences and I was glad we didn't shell out the big bucks for the omasake experience.",

The nigiri sushi was good, but the salmon roll we had barely had any fish and was overpowered with the add ons (mozzerella, sauce, crispy onions), so it didn't taste like a sushi roll. The yellowtail taquitos, Peruvian corn, and shishito peppers were also good. The rice pudding had too many flavors and the pineapple was not fresh. I really liked the lemon samurai cocktail, but would have enjoyed it more if it came out before our meal. We had 3 food items prior to receiving our drinks. The service was good, nothing remarkable. Decent meal but not a place I would revisit.",

Go figure.  I'm a bit of a millionaire (actual percentage varies but it has been known to exceed the single digits) so I decided that I was going to pick up the check on dinner for the three nights we were in town. I made all the reservations and I made sure we were all on time. I am that kind of guy. This is how I have amassed my aforementioned fortune. Details. The deets.  We got to Palazzo a few minutes late, actually, so disregard anything I said about our timeliness. Anyway, they seated us right away. We had a nice round table with a view of a support column. It was one hell of a sexy support column, mind you. All white and supporty-looking. Damn. I bet it works nights on the other side of town if you know what I mean right right right?  OK this review is getting carried away with itself, I'm sorry about that. Realizing that most of my family were classless heathens from New Hampshire I decided to let the waitress know our food allergies and from there, order anything she thought we might like. This might be the time to let you know that if you do this, they do a very good job of selecting tasty, pain-free food, but it may result in somewhat of a shock to your wallet. Just an FYI, really. Five people, with limited alcohol being served, and the bill came to about $450 after tip.  A dent in my bank account, you see, as I am ballin' out of control. I want to say something about making it precipitate that hasn't already been said but I can't think of something witty enough to include here. Please imagine dollar bills falling from cumulus clouds at a rapid pace.  Everyone was happy with the meal, though on the way in one of our group suggested that we go to Senor Frogs instead, and I almost did a 180 and walked back to my white Audi A5 2.0T with tan leather trim and drove all the way back to LA that instant, leaving my brother behind, even though he wasn't the one who made the comment. Almost. But I didn't, because it was mom's 60th birthday weekend and I wasn't going to let them bring me down, bro.  PS we ended up going to Senor Frogs for drinks after and it was fun, too. My brother ordered a drink that almost came out in a glass shaped like male genitalia. These are the moments that Instagram was invented for, brother.  If I were you, I would listen to the following advice from me: go to SUSHISAMBA and remember that money is temporary but food is forever. And then order like a man on the electric chair. YOLO for sure.",

My husband ordered the Japanese IPA and really liked it, my daughter had the drink special that was excellent and I ordered a glass of Sauvignon Blanc that was great as well. Our appetizer was the Sea Bass Anticuchos..oh my, melt in your mouth tender and the flavor was spectacular!!  We each had a skewer and wanted more!  Then we ordered three different sushi rolls that were also excellent...the Samba Strip was out of this world...best sushi roll all of us have ever had, then we had the Lima which was excellent as well and then the El Topo, which I didn't try because I don't like jalapenos (I know), but my husband and daughter raved about it and it didn't stay on the table for long.  For dessert we ordered the Peruvian Chocolate Ganache and split it...it was so decadent and was the perfect way to end our amazing meal.Our server was very attentive, but exactly when we needed him.  He was very helpful in explaining items on the menu that we had questions about and gave great suggestions as well.  You won't be disappointed coming here to eat, it was excellent!",

I give it 3 stars because I felt like the servings were  skimpy on the Kobe beef and some of the sashimi- and they didn't do a great job placing the items ( like the hot stone to cook the Kobe beef) within reach of everyone on the table. For the prices ( I selected the 100 dollars a person option) I felt like there should have been better service in this area. Also some of the dishes to pass that had sauce on them ended up getting spilled on some of my guests and it was a little awkward having to wipe the melted butter off the shirt of the guy next to me. Maybe they need deeper dishes for those items to prevent this from happening. The fish was grade A and the sushi was fantastic. Everyone loved the food once it made it on their plates and it was different from any other sushi experience I have ever had. I'll be back!",

As I enjoy every bite of the fish I tried to dissect the sauce that was delicately woven into the fish; which was rather refreshing.  The sea bass miso is also a must try; it's paired with a Brazilian corn that was the sized of a penny so big and tasty.  If you like sashimi order the sashimi platter it's a better deal than ordering by the piece.   The decor is modern and very energetic.  A little of pizazz and lust.  I always adore coming here.",

A savory, light, well-balanced dessert ** Before I gave up meat/fish, my faves were the miso-marinated Chilean seabass, spicy tuna roll, and organic chicken and smoked teriyaki skewer.

We ordered the popular miso sea bass large plate, but we think it was ok not that special.   We really don't like japanese wagyu tobanyaki 2oz because they use coconut cream which makes everything way too creamy and heavy. I don't think coconut flavor go well with the meat too.   However, their dessert is awesome! We LOVE their Peruvian chocolate cherry custard!! Don't let the name fools you. It may sounds like nothing special but they have a special way to make it special. They somehow use chocolate crumble to mix with chocolate pudding and vanilla ice cream and cherry sauce is perfect combination!!!! Would come back here again for the dessert itself.",

Bussers picked up empty plates and refilled water glasses quickly, and the FOH manager stopped by to check in. Food was really really good-- I had the tuna ceviche; tuna was very fresh and the dish was nicely presented. Also had the Hokkaido scallop and the shrimp skewers-- I lived the real char flavor on the shrimp. Had a cucumber cocktail and that was tasty as well. I'd give 5 stars but the prices were on the high end even for Vegas ($70 for lunch). It's in palazzo though so to be expected I suppose!",

Sounds strange for the Sushi purists out there?  Try it and your taste buds will pop with new discoveries that will simply bring a smile to your face. How many times did members of our party say awesome?  Too many to count. Christine, our server, is professional, courteous, accommodating and patient. She knows the menu and foremost on her mind is customer service. Wonderful food and service. That place has it made. I will definitely go there again.

The sashimi tiradito (kanpachi with yozu sauce) was just amazing - it completely melts in your mouth and is very refreshing with the lemony tang.

    "text": "My dining experience fell short of my expectations considering what we ate (or shall I say what we didn't eat) compared to what we paid. There were 21 of us for dinner and we had the chef's selection, also known as omakase. Typically, you would get the most innovative dishes ordering this style.  However, we were served typical menu items.  I think it was just a strategic way for them to serve a larger group without having to cater to individual orders.   The Good was that most of the items we tasted were pretty good. The Bad was that we weren't given enough food to taste everything, even though we were all charged the same price.    Instead, we shared each plate of food between 5-7 people, which included the following:  (1) Tuna tataki: only got to try it because someone didn't eat raw fish.  (2) Wagyu beef dumplings: Not enough brought out so I never got to try it.  (3) Mini yellow tail tacos:  I liked the spicy foam which added a nice kick to the citrus-ey flavors of the dish.  (4) Crab tempura: How ridiculous is it that there were only several pieces to each order so the hubs and I had to share one bite of one piece? This wouldn't even qualify as an amuse-bouche.  (5) Sea bass and shrimp skewers: Again, not enough so most of us shared skewers.  (6) Steak and mushroom stew: Everyone got 1-2 thin slices of beef, which was tender and flavorful.  (7) Sushi rolls/sashimi: the sushi rolls were the most generous items served (about 5 cut rolls) but IMO were rather underwhelming. The sashimi, on the other hand, was delicious and fresh. We were given about 3 slices each of yellowtail, tuna, and salmon which I easily could have eaten by myself.  I felt bad for the hubs because he was still hungry and asked what was being served next, only to be told that it was just dessert followed by a $2500 bill ($240 per couple).   Yes, our server was pleasant and friendly. Yes, the food was quite tasty.  And, yes, they need to recalculate the amount of food for groups ordering from the chef's selection. Sure, I expected to pay a lot for this kind of meal, but what I didn't expect was to leave unsatisfied and wanting for more.",

We were even able to have dessert there, which is really rare, because most desserts are gluten free.   The one downside is that the prices are quite steep. However, with the frequency that hubby is able to have sushi, since most sushi rice has wheat in it to make it stick better, it was worth the 100$ check for two people.  Our waiter was fantastic, and while busy gave outstanding service. He catered to both my and my husbands allergies with an outstanding attitude.

    "text": "Japanese, Peruvian, and Brazilian fusion. I'd think that intrigue alone would be enough to bring anyone to Sushi Samba.  I'll have to admit that I was nervous when our knowledgeable and friendly server began talking about the three different kitchens, the different ways to order...it all sounded way too complicated. (To be honest, I just wanted to fill my stomach so that I'd be able to drink later!) Luckily, one of our friends is a Sushi Samba master, and he did all of the ordering for our table.   I pretty much loved everything - if only for the novelty of it all - but a few stand-out dishes were: 1) yellowtail ceviche taquito: they looked like little yellowtail and guacemole tacos. somehow it all worked... 2) yellowtail tiradito: kinda like a ceviche? yellowtail, jalepeno, and lemongrass - i'm definitely a fan of sour and spicy. 3) fresh oysters and jumbo shrimp: no explanations needed. 4) El Topo roll: salmon, jalepeno, melted cheese, and crispy onions  I also would recommend getting a side of Peruvian corn (which went along with our churrasco plate) just to see how HUGE those kernels are! It's kind of ridiculous. Anyway, not only was the food great, but the service was among the best - they even have a \"sake sommelier\", so to speak. The place itself is energetic, contemporary, and very, very Vegas. I can't wait to go back!",

With a fellow diner who is allergic to both fish and sesame, the waitress was extremely accommodating.   The fish was very fresh and the rolls were fun and creative. To our surprise, we very much enjoyed everything we ordered! I was very pleased with the order of steak which was cut very well.   The trendy vibe and hip decor sets this place above the bar. Not to mention, the full bar they have, which is a hotspot for young adults staying at the Palazzo or the Venetian.   With great food and a great vibe, this place is definitely one to recommend!",

As others mentioned, it is a little pricey, but I think it's totally worth it. I would highly recommend making a reservation in advance if you plan on going. They can get very very busy.",

It's a restaurant that has a fusion of Asian and Brazilian. I've been here multiple times but this time went with a total party of 4.   We opted for the omakaze (chef chooses the courses) which we chose the price range of $50 a person without including tip, tax, and gratuity.   Words cannot describe how amazing the service, food, and overall experience was. If I could I would rate it 10 stars.   We had a 10 course meal. Ahi tacos and lettuce wraps, dumplings with pumpkin puree , salt and pepper squid, soft shell crab sliders, sashimi, sushi rolls, Chilean sea bass skewers, sirloin, raw oysters, and a huge dessert platter.   My favorite dish was the Chilean seabass. It was tender, sweet, and succulent. It's hard to put into words the deliciousness of each dish but all I can say is that there's always a variety.   Sushi samba also works very well with any food restrictions. Please see attached photos and receipt",

    "text": "After enjoying SUSHISAMBA in London I had high hopes for the Vegas location. Sad to say the experience was no where near the same. The decor is completely dated and the restaurant layout is a mess. But worst of all was the food. In London, the combo of Latin and Asian flavors was pronounced and delicious. In Vegas everything was horribly bland. Even after dousing the dishes with soy sauce the flavor was barely there. When mentioned to the server, he was gracious enough to bring us a little dessert that was also very bland. The atmosphere is equally as bad. The tables were sticky, the chair covers torn and everything looked like it needs a complete refresh. And the smell. Oh lord. Watch out for when the sales convention attendees use their over-padded entertainment budgets to order the wagyu beef cooked on hot stones. Both my husband and I were immediately reminded of being in a suburban Chili's when the table next to you orders fajitas. The smoke and smell of burning fat is overwhelming and incredibly unpleasant. Needless to say I will not be returning.",

While their tables were fully committed, we were able to easily find 2 seats at the bar. The bartender was lovey; she took our order quickly and even made a recommendation so we could get the sushi we love the most cost effective way possible. Our drinks were served almost immediately and the sashimi arrived shortly thereafter (almost like magic). We ended up ordering the assortment of 4 sashimi tiradito which was absolutely wonderful. It came with 3 pieces each of their yellowtail, kanpachi, salmon and tuna; each one prepared its own delicious, special way.  We had such a lovely time that, after the show, we decided to make a second visit. This time the bar was packed but they were able to seat us at the sushi bar immediately. We ordered a couple of rolls which were very well priced (especially for the strip) and again they were served promptly. Our waitress was just as excellent and attentive as the bartender too. If you find yourself at the Palazzo, definitely check this place out...whether you have a small amount of time or want to have a leisurely dinner, it's fantastic!",

I suggested we ate something like sushi or just any type of Asian food in general. We walking in the Venetian at the time so this place was close by. First of all it's so dark. Like extremely dark I mean someone fell because they couldn't see where they were going. So I had some rolls and I shared a big plate with someone which according to the waiter \"was a lot of food\". The rolls were ok I mean it didn't impress me but they were good. Then my shared plate came and it was the smallest piece of chicken on mashed potatoes:/ if you r hungry skip this place.",

The rolls we tired were more traditional Maki. The ingredients were fresh but nothing to write home about. The Shishito peppers were the best thing we tried. They were smoky roasted perfection. A bit spicy but not blow your head off hot in the batch we got. I could've eaten my weight in those suckers. So good. The bar staff (younger female & male) were incredibly lacking for a slow weekend evening happy hour. They talked to each other mostly making inside jokes & all around bad server etiquette. The last straw was when a gaggle of ladies hit the bar & they pointed from the other side of the bar & giggled before helping them. We chose to hit another happy hour around the corner & eat our dinner there.",

We had a party of 7 and sat in one of the round booths that was large enough to accommodate us all but still very cozy.   All of the waiters that helped us went above and beyond to make our dining experience great. Our trip was to celebrate my youngest brother's 21st birthday, and they brought us out a couple extra plates when they heard this, including a fantastic dessert plate. 3 of our 7 diners were vegan and the staff was also very helpful and accommodating in this regard - would highly recommend for this reason alone, as there was a separate vegan menu with tons of great options to choose from.  We opted to order lots of small plates for the table and share them family style. Would also recommend this, since you get to try a little bit of everything and the sizes are perfect for it. Prices are a little steep, but pretty much along the lines of what you would expect for a place like this on the strip.  We ordered:  -edamame -shishito -heirloom tomato salad -field green salad -various different sushis, most of the names are escaping me (they were all great) -tapioca con leche -chocolate sata andagi  I will warn you that most of the shishito peppers were not very spicy, but a couple in the batch were burn-your-mouth hot. We were asking the waiter about this and apparently this is kind of standard? Be aware. The heirloom tomato salad may have been my favorite. Additionally, I would recommend the Brisa Caliente from the cocktail menu.  Oh, the women's restrooms were also very cool. All in all, fantastic food, atmosphere and service. Would definitely recommend Sushisamba if you're in LV!",

If you're hungry, the ribeye and the rio grande are definitely filling and delicious. Overall I don't think I've ever had anything I didn't like on the menu.   Last time we were there, Jade constantly checked in on our table since we were running on a tight schedule and had a flight to catch.

First good point: a great selection of whiskeys including two of my favorites Hibiki and Yamazaki by Suntory. Not only that, they offer the aged versions. Now, I wasn't going to waste good Japanese whiskeys on unsuspecting Amerika-jin so Infirst ordered a miles blend that is less than $20 glass. Everyone loved that soninordered the 17y Hibiki ($60/glass) for the group sample. Oh my!  One of my sales guys did the ordering so I can't swear to the names of the dishes we sampled. Some pictures are posted but if you look you will see that there are over 2000 photos posted at this restaurant!    All the sushi and sashimi are not traditional. They come with sauces and toppings that give an appealing edge to the fishes.   The staff is 1st class. I smoke with the manager several times. 1st I wanted to know how he gets Suntory whiskeys that I can't find in Houston anywhere. He said that this comes from his distributor but that he was already past his allocation for the year. Hmm, I would ship a case home on my next trip to Japan if not for the fear of my wife kicking my butty for spending $1000s on whisky. Oh I digress.   Biiru o nomimasu ka?  This restaurant has a full selection of craft beers from Japan. Even a rice beer for those with gluten allergies that I need to find for my wife.   Desserts looked great but we were so stuffed and full of drinks that we all passed.   A very fun night with great food and drinks.",

The cocktails were great- food was pretty good but not worth the price in my opinion. $26 for a roll? I know it had truffle oil on it but...   Side note: Hand painted murals all over the restaurant.

    "text": "I had high hopes for this place, mainly because my mother, who I've taken to many great places in Chinatown, went to Sushi Samba and claimed it was the best meal she's ever had. So even though I knew it was expensive, if she said it was worth it I was believing her.   First off, it was crazy loud in the place, and it was very hard for us (especially my grandfather) to hear anything that was going on. But it's a strip restaurant I get it. We ordered drinks, oysters, and the heirloom tomato salad. I didn't eat much of any of those dishes, but for dinner we each ordered a roll: the neo Tokyo, sasa hand roll, and I had the chef special which was tempura shrimp, tuna, and cheese on top. All of the rolls were pretty bland and my roll was especially chewy with the cheese on top. (I knew sushi wasn't supposed to have cheese yet it sounded intriguing.)   For other small plates we ordered the hamachi Kama, tempura green beans, and scallops with Peruvian corn which everyone raves about. The best by far was the tempura. I have never had Peruvian corn but it was very big and sort of hard. The scallops didn't have any taste.   My biggest complaint about the restaurant is that we felt that they were constantly trying to take our plates away and clear the table. I understand it's a tapas restaurant so food comes quickly but once all our dishes were there they kept asking to clear plates that still had food on them. Just felt like they wanted to crank out as many tables as they could that night. They did end up giving us complimentary ice cream pops which was nice, but I don't think I'll be going back. I don't go to strip restaurants often but this is why..",

However after asking him a few questions about the menu, he asked if we wanted to do a tasting menu. He asked us a few more questions about our likes and dislikes. He then said that he would talk to the chef and together they would come up with a menu for us.   The meal was amazing. Our favorites were the salmon in garlic ponzu and sushi rolls. Don't get me wrong, everything tasted great (even though the serving portions were on the small side)  However, what really made our night was the service.

    "text": "I've stayed at the Venetian/Palazzo a dozen times and had never eaten at Sushi Samba. What a terrible mistake I've made all these years. Looking for a restaurant in the hotel for our bachelor party, we decided upon SushiSamba due to the variety of dishes, the vibrant atmosphere, and positive word of mouth reviews. We made a reservation through opentable, and were promptly seated upon arrival.  Samba proclaims to have the most extensive sake selection in Vegas, and we let our server choose a cheaper bottle for us and it was delicious.   1) Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef Gyoza (4.5/5) - you get 5 delicious pot stickers with quality beef that just melts in your mouth  2) Yellowtail Taquito (5/5) - there are two mandatory dishes to get and this is one of them. essentially a mini taco with yellowtail, roasted corn miso, and avocado. the explosion of flavor was mind-numbingly good and even friends who don't enjoy seafood loved this  3) Yellowtail Sashimi (4.5/5) - 4 slices of high quality yellowtail, the sauce is delicate and sour  4)  Berkshire Pork Belly (3.75/5) - I am admittedly biased towards pork belly so I loved the dish. the butterscotch miso on top was a little overwhelming but the pork belly itself was cooked to perfection  5) Sea Bass Anticucho (5/5) - this is the other mandatory dish. we were very fortunate because the table next to us came 15 minutes after and they ran out of this dish! the sea bass skewer is  their signature dish and deservedly so. two skewers of sea bass cooked so perfectly (soft on inside, slightly crispy exterior), there aren't enough superlatives to describe how delicious it is.   6) Rio Grande (4/5) - from their Churrasco menu, includes three types of meat: ribeye, chorizo, and wagyu picanha. i would not suggest this if you are eating by yourself or with another because it is just so much meat. in a larger group setting, i think this dish is perfect to share. the wagyu picanha is my favorite because the meat was so soft and tender.  Quite simply, I loved my experience at SushiSamba. The service was fantastic. The food was unique and delicious at the same time. The atmosphere embodies that of Vegas- vibrant and exciting. The price of the dinner was what I'd expect from a \"strip\" restaurant, so be prepared to spend at least $50.   I can't wait to go back to SushiSamba for some yellowtail tacos and sea bass.",

The sashimi with the tasting menu was great, including tuna, salmon, and yellowtail.  That day, one of the specials with the tasting menu was needlefish sushi, a bit unusual taste but quite good.  We also had oversized Peruvian corn kernels with the seabass on a stick, incredibly great dish.  The sushi rolls that came with the tasting menu were great, but I prefer simpler, so these weren't the highlight, but still excellent.  The mochi for dessert was very good, as was the banana cake that we tried.  Great unfiltered cold sake selection, we tried two different kinds.  Very good service, we were slightly late arriving and it was no problem for us to be accommodated.",

All of our happy hour appetizers were excellent. We had the peppers, tempura rock shrimp, spicy tuna and ezo rolls, the squid dish, gyoza and each had a slider. I hope I'm not leaving anything out.   Great place for a light dinner if you do happy hour and don't want to spend a bunch.   The mojitos were good, the house wines were ok.",

She was not very happy about that. lol.    I must admit when I was walking in to the place, I was concerned because it didn't seem very kid-friendly. But after sitting down and seeing other families around me and the kids menu, I would definitely take my daughter back. The ambience and food was perfect! I love my town!",

We had Wagyu beef gyoza, yellowtail taquitos, kanpachi sashimi tiradito, Sao Paulo roll, Samba strip roll, and salt & pepper squid.  I LOVED all of it, but if I was forced to pick a favorite it would be the Samba strip roll...chunks of succulent Maine lobster!    On my first visit, we had an amazing server named Nick and I HIGHLY suggest requesting to sit in his area.  He has great recommendations, is attentive without being intrusive, and is just a fun guy!  The young lady we had today was very sweet, but seemed a little overwhelmed.  There are also managers floating around, checking on tables, and this totally helps you feel valued as a diner.  I can't wait to go back again!  Completely worth braving the strip and dealing with all the tourists!  :)",

After attending a show in the area we had the craving for some Sushi.  We had decided on Sushisamba.  When we got there I think we were in between meals (lunch / dinner) so the place was now crowded.  It was kind of good like that, because it wasn't too loud and plenty of tables to select from.  Kind of dark, but yet nice ambiance.  A little music in the background, not too loud which allows you to have a nice comfortable conversation.  Not too dark to the point where you couldn't see what you were eating.  Here is what we decided to order:  Rock Shrimp Tempura  Golden pea shoot, snap pea jullienne, spicy mayo, black truffle vinaigrette 18.00 Tasty...think I like this dish the best.  4 stars  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pH0BLkL4cbxKzu471VZnuA?select=YfPESP5vVgqKCRts_w9uKQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/pH0B...</a>  Sea Bass and Miso   Sea Bass on a skewer Tasty and flavorful, the sauce was on the sweet side.

    "text": "I almost want to give this a 5. Near oh my god moment, but not quite.  This is a little misleading. I swear this came up under \"Chinese\" on Yelp while we were looking for something (in a group of four) but this is definitely not Chinese. It's Japanese Brazilian fusion, which I had never had, but was awesome. The menu is a bid daunting, but the waitress offered to bring out a tasting menu for us, based on the common questions like, \"are you OK with raw fish,\" \"do you have allergies,\" \"how do you eat red meat,\" etc. This was helpful - usually I'm not fazed by the large menu, but for some reason I was having problems focusing. Worth mentioning they say up front that they'll take back anything we don't like, no charge, and they do ask for a budget to keep them in line.  What we got was really pretty exceptional. Gyoza steamed and pan fried, hamachi taquitos (not what you're thinking - not the deep fried rolls, but little taco shells filled with hamachi sashimi), seared tuna with baby greens and crunchy salt, and portabella fries with kabocha aioli. All sounds fancy, all really good.  Then a warm plate - grilled sea bass with a sweet glaze, filet mignon (not their A5 wagyu, which we were offered for an upcharge, but declined) and king crab leg, all with a side of elote. The bass was good - tender and flaky, and I like the glaze. But it was crazy overpowered by the beef and crab. Firstly, the beef was far superior to what we had at N9NE. Tender, flavorful, and with a great salt and pepper crust on the outside, served with a little pile of powdered chile for dipping. And the crab was that near oh my god moment. An *enormous* king crab leg, brushed with a sort of thick butter sauce, served piping hot. Wow, this was exceptional. And while I guess I should expect it, points to the restaurant for realizing that serving a filet and a crab leg family style to diners that have only chopsticks required that you slice things up in to nice little bite sized pieces.  Finally, sushi. Their Neo Tokyo roll, which is their version of the spicy tuna, a hamachi roll with spicy crab and avocado on top, a tuna roll with asparagus, dusted with wasabi, and an assortment of sashimi and nigiri. As well as a hot roll - something covered in melted mozzarella, crispy onions and a sweet sauce. All of the cold rolls were good - I especially liked their Neo Tokyo roll. The sashimi was also very good, but the hot roll...I could do without. It was in interesting twist - not just the cheese was hot, but the entire roll, rice and all. However, the cheese and a heaping helping of onion and sauce overpowered whatever might have been inside. This was about the only misstep I could find.  The atmosphere is odd - lots of pounding techno music, along with an odd video collage (on many many video screens) of Brazilian beach babes, bullet trains, Brazilian slums, and Japanese salarymen trudging to their soul-murdering jobs. Not sure what they were going for. But whatever.  Great spot - Chinese though it wasn't, we all were appropriately full when it was over (not hungry, no stuffed) and we all agreed we'd be back. The total bill, excluding drinks, was probably about $65 per person. I loved the mix of appetizers, hot beef and seafood, and sushi. If you're going with a group, this is a fun way to try stuff without having to worry about reading a menu.",

We weren't totally impressed with our waitress, who wasn't very attentive -- our water glasses went empty a few times and she never noticed, and we had to wait about 10 minutes for our check.

We were hungry and we didn't know where to eat so we decided to go to sushi samba! No trust me nobody is paying me to write this review and no I'm not over exaggerating. From the moment I walked in I was aroused by the sensational smell of the food! mmm I can sometimes smell it in my most wonderful dreams. But it didn't stop there! We were greeted by the most amazing handsome manager ever Jason!!  He was a delight and splendid. He made us feel welcomed and right at home in what seems like heaven. He is obviously one of th sweetest angels ever.  The food was delightful. Something they surely served in The Last Supper. Our favorite was the dessert Jason recommended PERUVIAN CHOCOLATE GANACHE!!! Delicious. I didn't want to leave at all if I could stay there forever I would. This is one of the greatest places to visit when your visiting Las Vegas lucky for me I'm a local! By the way I love u Jason!!!!",

We were not disappointed with any of his selections.   The vibe & atmosphere was great and food amazing. Highly recommend this restaurant.",

We were sitting for about 15-20 minutes before receiving food or cocktail menus, and this was not because the waitress had not gotten around to us (she was there the minute we sat down) but rather because \"she lost the menus\" or \"couldn't find any in this area\". She proceeded to describe menu items to us instead of just going to find menus. I ordered a drink based off her description and ended up sending it back because it was a completely different type of liquor than she had said it was.   We only received menus when we insisted on getting them. When she did bring the menus she proceeded to tell us how she had to go all the way to the front of the restaurant to get them... Are we supposed to feel bad for you? That is part of your job! The food was great, the service awful making for a unenjoyable experience and one that will not bring me back to any of their locations.",

The menu itself is fantastic, but their options for how to serve people are great too! For example, you can give them a price range, and they'll go over the dietary restrictions of the group, and put together an AMAZING family style meal. Definitely recommend doing it that way with large groups.  For our second time, we were a slightly smaller group, walk-in, of 11, who managed to get a table right away (another large group had just left, coincidentally, were friends of ours). Again, they offered the same setup, and we took it, but this time we had a few with dietary restrictions. They took those requests, and brought out all plates for family style. The vegetarians received their own personal entree catered to their requests as well, but we all shared starters and other bites.  They were attentive and fabulous! I definitely recommend EVERYTHING about them.",

    "text": "The ambiance of the restaurant was breathtaking as 3 fellow diners and I walked in. We had made reservations a few hours in advance on a busy Saturday night (the night before 4th of July) so we understood that it would be a few minutes of a wait. While we waited, we sat near the waiting/bar area and our to-be waitress asked us if we wanted to order drinks. We ordered drinks while we waited for our table and our waitress brought them to us in the lounge area we were sitting in. I got the strawberry-tini which was really fruity and yummy.   We got seated after about 10 minutes. I will admit, the menu seemed slightly pricey but it's Vegas and you can't expect restaurants not to be pricey. I ordered the Neo Tokyo roll and it came with 8 small pieces but was the best sushi I've ever had! For $15, it wasn't bad at all because I also decided to order a side of coconut rice which was delicious and only $5. The drink did ring up to be $12 but overall it wasn't bad for the great dining experience. My fellow diners loved their dishes as well. 2 of them ordered a 4-course dinner for $50, which is customized to your liking based on what preferences and allergies you tell the waitress you have and she kind of surprises you. The last diner ordered the Kobe beef sushi and he enjoyed it a lot. It came with delicately sliced raw Kobe beef wrapped around the sushi which looked amazing.  Overall a very fun dining experience!",

And keep mind in mind, this is Vegas and it's in the Palazzo, so I already knew coming in that prices would be a little higher. I'm giving this 4 stars because they have items in the menu which can't be found anywhere else.  For appetizers, we had yellowtail taquitos and seared kobe beef.  Both were absolutely delicious!   We ordered a roll that had kobe beef inside and couple different types of nigiri.  I'm deducting 1 star from the rating because Sushi Samba deducted the size of my nigiri and rolls.  For the price you pay, you would think you would get bigger pieces... you don't! Always the case for these type of sushi joints. Besides that, the ambiance is hip w/ house music playing in the background and the servers are sexy hot. I would come back here again with some friends.",

    "text": "So we had a fabulous room in the Palazzo and needed to have a fabulous dinner to go with it.  We were dying to go back to Bobby Flay's Mesa grill in Cesar's, but when I saw that our own very hotel had a fusion restaurant, marrying Japanese, Brazilian, AND Peruvian flavors, I knew we had to take our money there.  My daughter's part Peruvian, and she never gets to experience the cuisine.  Plus she loves sushi...well, vegetable sushi to be exact.    As soon as we arrived, I was feeling the service and the decor....nice hostess seated us right away and an informative waitress gave us the rundown of the menu.  I had plenty of time after ordering to scope the murals (fat tip usage in a restaurant?  oh yea!).    The children's menu also impressed me.  It was a cute menu of that collabed with an artist to give a percentage of each bento box to charity.  Wow!  My kid ordered the sliders and switched out sweet potato fries for Peruvian corn (corn on steriods, as the waitress called it).  We weren't extremely hungry, or in the need for a drink, so we ordered light:  teriyaki chicken skewers miso soup avocado rolls prawn tempura more Peruvian corn plantains white rice   As you can see, we didn't order any of the restaurant specialties, but what we did get was delicious and filling.  However, as you probably already figured out, this place is $$$!  The miso soup was $6 and no different than the free soup we get at our fave sushi spot back home, and the white rice was.......$5!  WTF!  $5 for \"Japanese\" style rice?  Just because you put sesame seeds on top does not make it $5 (we are Filipino and require white rice with our protein always.)  Oh well, that was the most disappointing part of the dinner.    The most impressive part of our dinner was the kids bento box.  I wish they had bento boxes for adults because that's what I always order at a Japanese joint.  Her sliders were the smallest sliders I have ever seen, but they were oh-so-cute and worked for a child.  They came with seasonal fruit, which was like 2 blueberries and half of a strawberry, and the Peruvian corn was soooo good!  My daughter ended up skewing up some on the toothpicks from the fruit (Sushi Samba, if you use that on the menu, please credit Jada).  Plus, the box came with the cutest dessert ever...a tiny smoothie with Pop Rocks on top and a little brownie ice cream sundae.  Once again, so small and petite but it worked for her!  I'm not sure if I would be excited to go back again, as I still am to go to Mesa, but if I do I might give the drinks a try.  After reading many of these reviews, I realize I have missed out on some great sushi specialties and drinks (and a trip to the fancy bathroom!).  -Tiph",

The food there is relatively cheap as compared to some of the other sushi places in Vegas however be prepared to shell out a lot for the quality ingredients.  First off, the Kobe (A5 grade) although very good, was not as good as the one I had at Shibuya. Most notable was the Kobe on the rock. (Feel free to skip the Kobe on a platter of mushrooms as it was on okay and not really worth the money as the Kobe was a lot more well done). Moreover the sashimi Kobe was a little to this for my tastes and not as lean as I would have liked. As for the fish you can't go wrong with the Otoro or Yellowtail. As for the rolls the Yamato was decent/normal, same with the Neo Tokyo, nothing really special (ie. skippable). The service was extremely good as our water cups rarely ran low and the manager was very helpful in getting the bill comped.   All in it wasn't too bad of a restaurant however it is unlikely one that I would pay for especially with the number of other foods in Vegas.",

The restaurant is beautiful and the service was great. We had the pleasure of meeting Herb the Chef and he was amazing. I've considered making the 6 hour drive just to dine there again. I was in Vegas for a bachelor party and dinner at SS was by far the highlight of the weekend. We will be Back!  Thanks for a great time and great meal Herb and Staff!",

The service was good too- attentive and inventive.    BUT!  As other yelpers have said, the wait for the plates to come out is extremely slow. It was about 30 minutes between each plate!  And during most of our meal the place was half empty. Perhaps this is a policy to encourage liquor sales?   But it left a number at our table very unhappy with what should have been a great meal.",

He was very patient with the dietary restrictions that my friend had and made great recommendations.    Highlights were the peruvian corn which were colossal and meaty.  They disappeared very quickly.  We also shared the Rio Grande churrasco.  One of the 3 meats we had chosen were the rib eye which was medium rare and excellent with the red chimichurri dipping sauce (1 of the 4 sauces that came with the dish).  The lobster on the Samba Strip Roll was the best thing of the dish - everything else was a bit plain and for $20, I don't think I'll be ordering that again. We also had the tasty seabass skewers and topped our dinner off with 3 flavors of ice cream on a plate with a chocolate 'Happy Birthday' written on it for the birthday girls. The place is a bit pricey but heck, we were in Vegas!",

    "text": "Dinner here completely blew away my expectations.  I expected corporate lackluster service, dishes and an over hyped Vegas restaurant.  I was glad to be proven wrong.    A Sushisamba was short lived in Dallas and now I can see why...this would never fit in Dallas.  A very lively restaurant at the back end of the Palazzo Shops.  Once seated the very charismatic server explained that the menu, influenced by Japanese, Brazilian and Peruvian cuisine, is designed to be shared by the table.  Definitely an odd sounding combination of countries for a menu but it worked out well.  Peru and Brazil are heavy on the meats, and with Peru having an Asian influence in their culture, it made perfect sense to fuse the three together.   When dining with a large group here it can be very confusing as to what should be ordered with a shared menu concept.  Someone at the table should take charge of the ordering or ask your server to lead the way.  We relied on our server to guide us through.  He listened to our likes and dislikes a delivered a wonderful sushi platter.  The rolls were small but great flavor.  We enjoyed it so much we ordered a second platter.  Try the Samba Roll...lobster and mango served with a curry peanut sauce.  Still hungry we ventured to the Peruvian side of the menu and ordered the anticuchos served with Peruvian corn.  A sweet and heavy starch corn, much different that what we have in States.  The skewered meat was very sweet and tender.  Next were the fried mushrooms...a recommendation from the server.  These were outstanding...deep rich flavor fried in tempura.  This sounds like a lot of food but it is not.  I left quite hungry but satisfied with the quality of food and service we received.  For as busy as they were, the server did not skip a beat.  The food was absolutely delicious.  The restaurant can get pretty loud if you catch it later in the evening.  With this type of shared menu the bill can jump pretty fast.",

    "text": "I am bit conflicted on how to rate this place. There were a few things I liked about it and a few I did not. Three stars seem a bit low, while four seems too much. Perhaps 3.5?  First, the decor and ambiance is great! I really enjoyed the fusion of food: Brazilian, Peruvian, & Japanese. The rolls were just ok, but the ceviche and tiraditos were really good. As expected, it was pricey and small. However, unless you are in Peru, you are not going to get large ceviche plates for cheap. I also liked the Caipirinha. The service wasn't bad but was also not very attentive. One thing that bothered me is that the gentleman that brought our pitcher of Caipirinha (hey! it wasn't just for me, people) and when he was serving my cup, the top came out and a bunch of the caipirinha spilled over on the table and a bit on me. Well, the staff handled it well. They apologized and cleaned the mess. However, the inner alky in me was having a fit because I felt the spilled at least a glass worth of the drink and didn't bring us more or maybe a give us a bit discount on the pitcher (just the pitcher). I think that would have been a nice gesture, since it was like if they brought me one drink, they drop it, and not bring me a new one. I really don't think it was absolutely necessary, but it would have been nice costumer service.  Overall, I would come back!",

Miso Marinated Sea Bass: The Sea Bass was the sized of my fist (no bigger). The flavors and texture of the Sea bass was great. I really enjoyed this dish, but for a tiny piece of fish priced at $29. It's not going to satisfy many and one might change theirr mind about sharing because of the small portions. If you want to add a side of rice it will set you back another $5!   --- 3.5 / 5 Stars  Salt & Pepper Squid: Nothing out of the ordinary. Portion was small once again. $14  --- 2.5 / 5 Stars  Maya Roll - The sushi itself wasn't that great, but the salsa was quite tasty. $11  --- 3 / 5 Stars  BoBo Brazil - Probably the tastiest roll here. The addition of kobe beef was great. Small portions once again. $17 --- 4 / 5 Stars  As you can see for the price you're paying here, you can easily select another restaurant (especially if you're ok with eating outside the Venetian).  If you're staying at the Venetian I recommend eating at Delmonico Steakhouse (Bone-in Ribeye)",

Big thumbs-up to their pastry chef, Jai, as well. Melissa might have shepherded us to our dessert choices with poise and class rarely found in a Las Vegas establishment, but Jai's care with the preparation of our sumptuous desserts was nothing shy of brilliant. He really raised the bar with his flawless presentation of both desserts. Beautiful, indulgent, simple, crafty. He allowed the dishes to speak for themselves, and they spoke loudly. In my mouth!  He even came to greet us personally.  And I'm pretty sure there was an extra scoop of ice cream in there. Kudos to the Sushi Samba staff for all their excellent service this evening!!! Thank you!!",

They meld some crazy combination of Japanese, Peruvian, Brazilian and Freaking sexy.  I don't know.  But every dish, and we had MANY, surprised the palate.  The manager was caring and even offered us a free starter.  Some little piece of ocean life on top of a finely chopped pile of garlic and green things . . . outrageously good.  Then the waitress, Luara, started telling us stories.   About the foods and origins of dishes.  About the little stuff (this black salt on the filet is from . .. and one of the four seaweeds you just had was made from algae not seaweed .. . ) and on and on.  And this angel waitress has a passion for food and takes joy in making our time special.  I'll stop here, but she was so good at being THERE with us. How often do you get that treatment and it's not being faked?  The table next to us had some kind of drink tower.  Little tiny wine glasses on a metal tree full of different drinks and lit up from the bottom.  Fun.    Prices reasonable and maybe the crowd a little wild, but it was in The Palazzo in Vegas, what do I expect!?  This place is hidden= hunt for it!!!",

The rolls they did have were just so intricate and didn't sound very appealing. I went during happy hour, so at least I was able to get rolls at a discounted price.   I'm giving it 3 stars for the rolls that I did have- - spicy tuna, and then added avocado; otherwise it's probably more of a 2 for me. Service was ok. I sat at the bar, but I think it may have been in-between shifts.   Next time I'd go somewhere else.... either Tao or RA Sushi across the street in Fashion Show Mall.   On the plus side - I liked the atmosphere....",

The new roll with the rice crisps on the outside is bland and blah.  Bring back the old roll!!! 2) Yellotail taqiutos. Not sure what this is, but don't order it.  It was fusion gone wrong!!!!

He explained that the restaurant is combined with 3 cultures; Peruvian, Japanese and Brazilian being it was our first time. He was attentive, kept checking on us and refilling our waters.  I recommend SEARED KOBE! Yummy in my tummy.  I wouldn't mind coming back here again. Its a little pricey but you pay for what you get.

Great idea! For $50 a person, we got some of everything. EVERYTHING was good.  I was so full, I couldn't even have any of the food that came toward the end.  The manager even gave us a \"tree\" of drinks on the house to help us celebrate! Definitely taking my husband here next!  UPDATE 7/10/12  This experience was a little lack luster compared to my first.  I did end up taking my husband here as previously mentioned.  I entrusted our menu choices to our server.  Not as impressed. Maybe I just didn't care for her choices as much as I did the first time with Max.  She ordered us these grilled chilies with lime, and they were just okay for me.  Little disappointed though, as I mentioned to her how much I liked the black truffle green beans and didn't get any.  I did tell her I didn't mind raw things, but I should've stopped right there because thats pretty much all we got after that.  The best things were the pot stickers with pumpkin puree and a couple of the sushi rolls.  Also, Peruvian corn was delicious! Next time, I'm gonna order myself so I know I'll like everything.",

I can understand why it's expensive but the price wasn't worth paying. I absolutely love tuna, foie gras, and caviar so that's why we ordered it.....but all those together on a roll just wasn't to my liking.  Tuna tataki was above average but nothing to rave about. Every place puts their own spin on tuna tataki. So, me being the tuna lover that I am...we had to try it. I've had better. It wasn't memorable.  Hamachi sashimi was suprisingly fresh. We were hesitant to order it because we were thinking Las Vegas wouldn't have fresh fish. We were surprised.  Uni nigiri was the best I've EVER had anywhere so far. VERY surprised! Also liked the nori (seaweed) around the uni because it wasn't too chewy. They don't put wasabi in the middle which is a plus for me since I don't like wasabi.  The good: 1.5 stars for the uni alone, 1 star for the fun atmoshphere, and 1 star for the large menu selection.   The bad: wait time, tables too close together, and it's a bit pricey for what you get.",

Our other Tapa was an eggplant dish the size of toothpicks, again tasty but crazy $$ considering that a whole eggplant is like $2- So long story short we ran out of time to experiment with any other dishes and had to run to the show on basically an empty stomach after dropping $70- What a joke..",
