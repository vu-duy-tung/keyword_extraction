    "text": "Some interesting island dishes on offer here, with an extensive selection of sides and a la carte items.   Fried potato balls stuffed with beef are notably good. Light, fluffy cloud-like pillows with a crisp outer shell. Beef and veg inside tender enough to melt into the airy potatoes. Unique and fun textural experience.  Fried plantains with garlic sauce are also excellent. Unexpectedly bright, the garlic infused with vinegar or citrus juice.  Marinated steak and onions with black bean rice entree is tasty, perfectly seasoned and tender. Large portion, be hungry.  Grilled chicken entree also well seasoned, unfortunately a bit dry.  Fried taro root stuffed with pork sounds great but lacks flavor. Almost bland.  Service was pleasant, very friendly and helpful when ordering from the large menu.  Carb heavy, veg light, and many deep fried items. This isn't exactly healthy eating. Many fried items seem like novelty fair/event food, fun to try but not something to make a habit out of unless you have an inferno metabolism.",

It was great trying out this place given that back home in the LA area we don't have PR food. Service was great, vegetarian options were offered and overall we loved it! We will always visit this restaurant when in Vegas. Gracias",

From the moment you step into the restaurant you can smell the intoxicating aroma of spices and the salsa music playing sets the tone.  I ordered the Churrasco with chimichurri sauce with sides of arroz con gandules and the tostones. The Churrasco (steak) was very tender and the sauce complimented it perfectly. The tostones were crispy and served with mayo ketchup sauce which had a hint of garlic to it. I've been here a few times and haven't had a dish that I didn't like. You'll leave here full and happy. There's no other place in town that serves fresh authentic Puerto Rican cuisine. If you have never had Puerto Rican food,this is the place to go!",

We got the Mofongo, Puerto rican rice, grilled porkchop and the potato balls. All was excellent. The potato balls was the bomb!   We will definitely try other meals next time.

    "text": "Came to Vegas on a business trip from Arizona. Everywhere I go, I check to see if there is a Puertorrican restaurant close the vicinity so I can see if it tastes like back home. This one by far is the best I've had so far in terms of taste, time it took from ordering /receiving the food, and service. For starters I had an alcapurrica (Fried stuffed plantain). Although it's just one that you are given, that is plenty because of the size. For the entree I had the bistec encebollado (it's like a sirloin steak with sauteed onions). I am really particular of how I like my steak and this one blew me away. Not too dry, not too moist. The flavors in both the starter and entree were beyond what I expected. Similar places try to replicate the puertorrican food, but these guys are the real deal. I dare to say that their food taste better than some of the places back in Puerto Rico. I must say, what I also liked even more was the service. I was not rushed but I also was not wondering were the waitress was at with my food. The service she provided felt like I was in a fine dining restaurant. She was courteous and friendly, it really made me feel like I was back home in the island. There is nothing better than going to a place were you just feel welcome. The interior of the restaurant was superbly balanced. Puertorrican restaurant outside of the island usually have TOO MANY Puertorrican pictures and designs to the point were it gets overwhelming. This one had a few pictures and background music typical of the island and it was perfect because it did not provide me with too many distractions while I ate. I want to thank the chefs for the excellent food provided and Elymagda for a great service. Ohhh and did I mention they have Malta India! Puertorricans will get it.",

I saw some of the food on FB and decided to head over there on Sunday at around 11am. When i got there, their grill was down which was fine with me since i wasnt there for the particular food that had to be grilled. The customer service is great, very polite and attentive even though it seemed one of the servers was new so the other server had to tell him what to do, and there seemed to be tables where guests needed more \"attention\". Food is delicious..i ordered coffee with cream, Camarones en ajo con mofongo y tostones. Mofongo and the shrimp went so well together, mofongo was done right. Plus I tried their coconut custard dessert which was so yummy plus I love the fact that they do it in house. Ambience is nice and enjoyable with some very good music. I will definitely be going back. Everything exceeded my expectations and more. Price was definitely worth it.",

The alcupurria was good- reminiscent of True authentic PR food- but it wasn't completely there. The rice was pretty awesome. The tostones... they were okay. They weren't as crispy as I would have liked. The Camarones... literally came in a small styrofoam bowl. The sauce is good, but it's nothing special.  The prices here seem to be pretty high for the food. You can't buy a meal- you have to buy an entree and then PAY to add things like rice and tostones to it. I think I'll take to making my own food. That makes prices pretty high.",

Chicken empanadas had big chunks and skin looks as tho they no longer want to shred the meat...I'm getting disappointed because it's a long drive for me and I wanted to be supportive, another thing is the location and neighborhood, it's kind of iffy. So I'm not sure if I'll be coming back again. However, desserts were descent. Staff seemed friendly.",

I ordered a plate of pernil and never in my life have I had to pay for the rice separate, the beans separate, plantains separate, etc. one plate of food with 2 drinks and an empanada cost me 26 dollars which is unheard of. I take pride in my culture but this was just wrong. My culture has large servings of food for a reasonable price but not this place. They just lost a customer.

I'm no expert on mofongo, but the mofongo I tried several times in Puerto Rico was not dried out. I got the pork version, and the chunks of meat thrown on too was also a disappointment. First of all, it wasn't mixed in the way I like it. Also, what's the deal with cooking meat until it's dried out with absolutely no juices left. I think this is just how they cook it and it's not a mistake. I noticed Cuban pork dishes are cooked like this too. I really don't care for jerky style meat. The plus is that the people there were friendly, but that's not enough to bring me back. It's good food with good service that always bring me  back.",

The mofongo  served was better than the one we had in West Palm Beach and even better than the one in San Juan.  The pork cracking in it was a yummy crunchy salty dream, the proportions were perfect, and get the garlic dipping sauce to dunk it in, you will not be disappointed.  Carne frita was a perfect serving of fried pork chunks cooked to medium that was delicious during each bite.  Arroz con gandules side was also spot on, and the waitress talked us into having the coconut pudding called tembleques which was amazing.   Can't wait to go back, seriously the best Puerto Rican food I have had in a long time.  They just need to add cafe con leche and tres leches cakes to make it 6 stars!",

In My last review I had to be brutally honest cause the location TOTALLY KILLED it. We went back cause we learned they moved from the previous place, so being PR we had to go show our support and give them a second chance. The restaurant is nice. Great atmosphere, banging food. Everything we had was on point. So so yummy that I want everyone I know to go eat there while in Vegas. We went to Vegas for a concert and had late lunch early dinner there just before heading out to the concert. Staff was friendly and the owner came out and talk to us while our order was being prepared by the awesome chef/s. The taste of all we ate was mouth watering. Everything was PERFECT. I'll definitely be going back when I hit vegas again in July 2018.",

It was my first time having Puerto Rican cuisine, and there were definitely a few unfamiliar items on the menu. Everything is ordered a la carte, but if you order an entree, then you can pick up to three sides at a discounted price. Things are pretty reasonably priced in my opinion.  I couldn't decide what to get, so I ended up ordering three appetizers and a side of seasoned rice to try a bunch of different things. The bacalaito in particular was huge! I ended up struggling to finish everything. It was all very tasty, though some items were a tad salty. I also regret not having some vegetables to balance out all the fried foods, but that was my own fault. See my photos for more details.  The interior is spacious and there is ample parking in the parking lot. Service was also very attentive and friendly, and I would definitely come back to try some more of their dishes!",

Our latin culture expose visual seeing for our clients to see the art of our chef and our family history secret recepie. Our latin culture is amazing and to keep a good resturant and high reviews you DO NOT USE CAN PROCESS FOODS..(HINT). neither the less it was completely expensive for the location the resturant is located. 2.. To maintain your name for a great  Quality  food you do not hire chefs from different ethnic culture. I'm sorry no offense to noone but you opening and public announcing and selling your culture food the food will never be the same with another culture cook SORRY. This resturant needs to revamp there cultural presentation and know that the food I ordered was NOTHING like  food.  NO RESTURANT EVER USES CAN VEGGIES in addition every Latin and carribean resurant has soup PERIOD..",

I thought the food was delicious. My complaints are based on service. The hostess sat us quickly. We waited for a while until a waitress noticed us and asked us if anyone had taken our order. We said no, she apologized. Ok, right? Well she forgot about our drinks & needed to be reminded. It's understandable that the food is fresh & takes a while to make but it seemed a bit to long. When our appetizer arrived she apologized again but this time for the wait. She was trying.. which was noted & appreciated. However, they weren't busy. I can only imagine what it'd be like on a busy weekend & how long it would take to get service & then your food.",

The negative part was that the waitress did note explain the menu correctly. I ask what came out with the \"chuletas\" and she said: \" you choose the meat and then you have up to 3 sides to choose with it\".   What she never said was that you still had to pay for the sides, they are not included, as it seemed to imply.  When I questioned the bill that's when she explained it.  I said, but if I am to pay for the sides then I can order all of them if I want, why only 3?  Her answer: that's the way the boss wants it.    They should have that written on the menu or explained it correctly. Very deceiving.",

Just like times with the familly.  The  owner is very friendly and goes out of her way to make you feel like home. Familly.  It is refreshing to see that there is a new staff meber Jason whom has make me feel like i was at the dinner with family.  He interacted with both me and my husband great.  He also was working with other staff member in a team player.  When he wasnt taking care of other tables  or check to see if the food was coming, he was asking us about the food.  Jason is great to making this great place to eat better.  You can buy food anywhere but to get the real Puerto Rican familly feel is hard.  Thank you Jason.  You are a star.  Keep up the great work.",

They gave away all 3 big tables and when asked all they said was we apologize but people kept coming in.  We tried to explain that the host told us to leave and they said all we could do was say sorry.  Then made us wait another 20 minutes.  Food came out in waves and my daughter got her steak when we were all finished eating.  I still haven't got my rellenno de papa or my refill.  Food was okay but we will never come back.",

The food is just amazingly delicious but I'm hesitating about coming back since they don't have a baby changing station.   When I asked some servers about it I didn't like the response they gave me. The restaurant needs to take measures and accommodate guests with babies.",

The music that they played makes you wanna start dancing in the middle of the restaurant.   For starters, we ordered Alcapurrias (Fried tarot root filled with pork) and Rellenos de Papa ( Potato balls filled with ground beef). They both came out hot with crispy crust and full of ground beef. Both were delicious!  For entree, we shared Grilled Pork chops and Trifongo. I loved the Trifongo, it was not too dry, not too soft; really flavorful with just the right amount of garlic flavor and crunchiness.  The Flan de Queso y Guayaba (Cream cheese guava flan) was delicious. It was thick and creamy rather than the thin kind you get in other restaurants.  The restaurant was spotless, the service was outstanding and friendly. The food was authentic and the price was reasonable. It was better than the food we had in Puerto Rico.  We will definitely be back and will recommend to anyone looking for an authentic Puerto Rican meal!",

    "text": "My friends were in Puerto Rico and since I couldn't be with them, Puerto Rican food was the choice.  We started off by ordering one of each of the Empanadilla's:  Beef, Chicken, Pizza Empanada.  Of the 3 my favorite was the beef.  It was seasoned well and it had the right moisture consistency.  When we split the chicken empanada, I had that feeling that I wasn't going to like it too much, which is what happened.  I didn't care for chicken, empanada style.  The chicken was good, but I felt like it was missing something.  As if I needed to have some kind of sauce to go with it.  The pizza empanada, while still good, I felt like I was eating a pizza hot pocket, empanada style.  For our main dish, we wanted to try the pork chops:  Chuletas a la Parrilla/Fritas.  If you get it grilled or fried, it comes with two pieces so we asked if we can get one of each.  Of the two, my favorite was the fried.  Seemed like the fried was juicer, the grilled was more chewier.  To accompany the chops, we ordered the Arroz con Gandules - Puerto Rican Rice.  Excellent flavor.  Better than what I tried cooking.  I wish I ordered more to go.  Maduros - Fried Sweet Plantains is always my favorite.  They're usually the same every where I've tried them, good and hits the sweet spot.  To go, I ordered the Surullitos - Fried Corn Sticks.  I didn't eat it right away, and my guy end up putting them in the fridge.  I warmed it up and it just tasted like corn dog bread, but the ketchup/mayo made it tolerable.  The staff and service was excellent.  I will come back to try more of their menu.  I can't wait.",

I honestly did not know that there was an authentic Puerto Rican restaurant in town, but now I do. The service is what gets this place to the top as the food was really really good, but not perfect. One of the aspects I like the most is that the menu is \"order whatever you want\" and there are not any combos or anything like that. The waitress recommended items that compliment each other and that was very helpful. I got the chicken with rice and plantains.  Additionally, because they were a little slow, our waitress gave us a free desert on the house and we did not ask or give any indication of displeasure. It was a very nice final touch to a great meal. We will be back for sure and next time I am getting the steak!",

The 3 of us ordered different entrees and desserts so we could share and try a better variety for the evening.  I got the Pernil with yucca and fried sweet bananas.  My friends got the shrimp in a garlic butter sauce with trifungo (mofungo with yuka added).  My other friend got the pernil sandwich with tostones as bread. For dessert we got the flan, coconut custard and a fried pastry with a cheese filling. Again the food was amazing and I would recommend this place to everyone.",

    "text": "Very disappointed. I gave them 2  chances and both experiences were just a shame. The 1st time I went back in Dec 2015 they got my order wrong and some of the food was just luke warm (i like my food fresh and hot) but just thought It was because they were semi busy. I was charged incorrectly and was convinced that \"I\" order 4 pasteles ( at $4 each) and not 2. Ok fine, mistakes happen. But when I took my cousin and friend there last night at 730 pm (they close at 8) it was flat out disgusting. This place takes a long time to make your order, but I just assume it's because \"they are making it fresh\". My pasteles were once again cold. My friends pasteles were cold. My cousins fried pork chunks were cold. The tostones were cool to the touch (i like them right out of the fryer!). After about a 20 minute wait, my alcapurria finally shows up and I took a bite of my alcapurria and the masa was RAW and the meat inside was cold (like refrigerator cold). I asked for my money back and the lady taking orders convinced me she would make me a fresh one. We waited another 20 for a \"fresh one\" and was told it was given to another customer my mistake! There were only 2 other parties in the place.....really? By this time my friend and cousin were just over with this place by now. But I waited. Puerto Rican temper was starting to flare up.... I told myself \"It was just $4 and just leave\"  The dining experience was pretty much a wash at this point. Then, Lord a behold.... . Out came another cold and RAW alcapurria. I'm done giving this place chances. If you like luke warm and RAW food, then more power to you. If you dont, then stay away from this place. P.S.....eating RAW masa not only taste real gross but it can make you sick. My grandma always told me that.",

So, I checked out the Yelp reviews and came upon this restaurant.  We went to the restaurant at about 7:30pm, so it was very near their closing time of 8pm. Going in was a bit awkward because we didn't know if we were to wait to be seated or just go up to the counter. We went up to the counter because we were taking the food home. A young lady came to us and asked us if we wanted to sit, even though it was take out. We sat at a booth and she offered us something to drink, as she gave us the menus.  We ordered a few things: mofongo, yuca, pollo guisado con arroz mamposteao, ensalada de papas, tostones, flan y tembleque. Everything we ate was delicious and very authentic. There is no doubt that the chef knows how to cook PR food. The disappointment was in the desserts. The tembleque was tasty but very lumpy. And, the flan did not taste like flan. Flan is supposed to be a custard. This \"flan\" was dense and not custard-like at all. I'd recommend that they work on mastering these two desserts that are very much part of our culture.  Aside from that, I'd return to eat but, definitely, would not buy the dessert.",

In the meantime I can say that Sofrito satisfies my needs. Atmosphere is modern and clean. The menu is a la carte. I definitely would bring a friend or date and split dishes so you get to experience it all. Appetizer- We started off with beef empanadas. The breading had the right crispness and it was sufficiently stuffed. The beef was flavorful. Next we had the Rellenos de papa or potato balls filled with beef. They were to die for. Outside is fried and crispy and flavorful and soft inside. Main course- We had the bistec encebollado? Basically steak and onions that came with a sauce to dip in. Steak was tender and onions we're sauteed perfect. The dip sauce was amazing and you could pour it over steak or dip like we did. The rice was amazing with right blend of spices and close to what my grandmother used to make but still not as good as hers. The potato salad was good. Not like how you have from the store. Hard to describe, maybe not as sweet? Would get it again. Trifongo was amazing. Green and sweet plantains mashed with other stuff. Iconic dish done excellent. Dessert- Get it, you know you want to. We tried tembleque(coconut custard). If you like coconut and custard then it's a match made in heaven. So good my girlfriend stole the bowl away from me to not share the rest with me. That's ok because I ate the quesito which is a cheese filled pastry. It was yummy!  In conclusion eat there, bring a friend so you can split dishes and try stuff, and enjoy!",

From the alcapurrias, large generously filled empanadas, tender peril/chicken stew & seasoned arroz con gandules.   The only drawback is the a la carte where you pay, in my opinion too much for maduros/rice. But whatever,  everything is AMAZING.    Locals & tourists MUST support this family owned local gem.",

My wife and I came to visit friends here in Vegas and he introduced us to Jorge and this awesome spot. We filled up on favorites, fried pork chops, rice and peas, red beans, mofongo, rellenos (fried potato ball), and plantains. Truly left with a fat belly and empty plate. The service, portion size, and quality of the food was reflected in the heart of this spot right here. It didn't hurt our wallet either. Next Vegas trip this is the first stop.",

They are Cubano, so we were excited to have an authentic restaurant, unfortunately it did not meet our expectations. First, the sign says please wait to be seated but no one greeted us. They just told us I'll find a table and go sit down. The menu, it was confusing having to order a meat and then the sides with a separate costs. Plates should come at 1 cost sides included. The white race was okay, but who could mess up white rice come, the other two types of races we got were not tasty. The meat was overcooked whether it was the beef steak, or the pork chops. All for meals were overcooked. The yuca was decent but needed Salt. Tostones just okay, maybe I'm used to Mom's homemade Cuban tostones. To top everything off, I ate the Yuca and managed to choke down one pork chop before finding a hair on my plate. That was enough. The waiter said he would get the manager, and she never came we asked another waiter, and still the manager never came. After sitting there for quite a long time our way to finally came over and said that the manager was busy cooking and couldn't come over but gave us one plate at no charge. I was really hoping to enjoy the authentic food they ever ties, unfortunately I did not I will not go back or recommend it to anyone.",

And I just know because I know how to make them and how they are supposed to taste.. so they are very close and don't have any cheese in them...like how some of us eat them... Now the food is pretty good and pretty close to what it tastes on the island... Yea sometimes its tastes like too much vinegar or too much garlic but remember not everyone cooks the same way...but for being all the way over here and for someone that really doesn't wanna make a mofongo or just cook that day... Then definitely come over cause its the closest you can get to our food...its delicious! I went to cali one time and they had this \"Puerto Rican\"place and it was jussst so bad I was like there is no wayyy this is our food and when I came over here.. coming from FL and PR.. I was and am so happy they exist over here! Keep it going Sofrito Rico!",

I had a yearning for mofongo so I had it with pork crackling. It came with a delicious vegetable based broth. The mofongo hit the spot. So yummy!  Hubby had the grilled chicken breast with a side of mofongo. Well I will tell u this:  I tasted that chicken breast myself and it was thick,char flavored and just friggen awesome. Omg.

    "text": "At Sofrito Rico, there is no such thing as a combo meal. Every single item on the menu is priced accordingly to what you want. For starters if you choose mostly regular side orders, it can get expensive. I went for the A La Carte Entree where I have the option to choose 1 protein and up to 3 sides, and each are priced individually. For the protein, I ordered the Pollo a la Parilla ($8.50) and for the sides, I chose Arroz con Gandules ($2), Tostones ($3), and Mofongo ($4.50). In addition, there is a small salad that comes with the entree.  The Pollo a la Parilla is a grilled chicken breast with sauteed onions. The meat taste like it has been charred and nicely grilled. The Arroz con Gandules is Puerto Rican rice with pigeon peas. It taste great, almost similar to Spanish rice but different because Puerto Rican rice has a more distinct quality flavor. This makes me want to have a second order of just only this rice. Now the next two sides are mainly Fried Green Plantains.   Fried Green Plantains are very much a staple in Puerto Rican Cuisine. Unlike a Ripe Yellow Plantain that can be quickly fried and sweetened, Green Plantains have a more thicker skin and are starchy, which is why it cannot be eaten raw and it takes longer to cook. The Tostones differs slightly from the Mofongo in a way that it requires to be fried first, flattened, and then fried again twice. Whereas the Mofongo is fried one time, then mashed with garlic, and this is where chicharrones (crispy pork rinds) are incorporated to give Mofongo a bit of crunch.   I tried the Tostones and Mofongo and both have a savory taste when you add the Garlic sauce. Since Green Plantains are very starchy, the texture can taste somewhat dry. When you bite into the Mofongo, it looks like mashed crumbles of Fried Green Plantains. With the Tostones after it has been fried twice, salt is immediately added to give flavor, and it's almost like snacking on French Fries.  The only difference is that Fried Green Plaintains are a more healthier snack than Fried Potatoes, and I'm sure these will definitely fill you up.",

Until this past weekend I wasn't sure I would enjoy those flavors unless I went back to visit. I had Sofrito Ricos' cuisine at First Friday from their food truck. I liked it a lot and wanted to try their restaurant so I went the next day. Th e roasted pork was tender and had the perfect amount of spices, practically melted in your mouth. For my sides I chose the tostones which were pretty big, perfectly fried and salted with garlic sauce on the side. I also had the mofongo, another form of plantains that are mashed with garlic and had chunks of chicharrones mixed in. This was definitely something I would return to eat but the one thing I really enjoyed was the Rellano de Papas. Fried potato balls with well seasoned meat inside. This was the first Puerto Rican item I ever tasted back east and it brought me back once I had my first bite. The drive is worth it for me and I will be back here for sure.",

    "text": "Awesome, awesome, AWESOME!!! This place totally ROCKS! I've been here three times, and I can't wait to go back, again.  The arroz con gandules is spot on...truly authentic.The alcapurria, rellenos de papa, empanadillos, tostones, yuca en mojo de ajo, and yuca fries are all delicious. Heck...I'd come here for the appetizers, alone...lol  There are a few items on the \"secret\" menu. In fact, I'm sort of reluctant to post about them because they are THAT good. The first is \"pasteles\". These are sort of like Puerto Rican tamales, except they are made with plantains and wrapped in banana leaves. They have a unique flavor and are usually served around the holidays. The ones they serve here are INCREDIBLE...totally authentic and incredibly tasty. But, you'll need to ask you server if they have them, because they sell out fast.  The second \"secret\" menu item is \"Trifongo\". If you like mofongo (a mashed mound of plantains, garlic, and pork crackling), there's a good chance you'll love \"Trifongo\". In addition to using fried plantains, \"Trifongo\" mixes in maduros (sweet plantains) and yuca. It truly is INCREDIBLE!  A dish that I tried, tonight, is the \"Chuleta Fritas\" (fried pork chops). I have never been a fan of pork chops, but these were the BEST PORK CHOPS I'VE EVER HAD. They were so flavorful, so succulent, and so delicious. I never realized that pork chops could taste this good.  The service has been excellent, every time we've gone. The servers have always been very friendly, warm, and welcoming. And, the food has always been served fresh (direct from the kitchen to the table) and is presented in a visually-pleasing manner.  As for the down sides, we ordered the \"chuletas fritas\" on the first visit and they were a bit overdone. Also, we ordered \"pernil\" and, although quite delicious and flavorful, it was kind of fatty. Fat is to be expected from pernil, but this was a bit much. It is possible that we just got a bad piece. The rest of the feast made up for these shortcomings.  Nevertheless, Sofrito Rico totally ROCKS!!! I was just there a few hours ago and I can't wait to go back. It's AWESOME!!!",

The Arroz con guandules was the best thing I had as far as flavor goes, also got yucca al ajillo again, needed some more flavor. For dessert I tried the tembleque it was decent, I could tell it wasn't fresh.  Definitely offers authentic Puerto Rican food, just not the best Puerto Rican flavor I expected.",

The cafe is located west of Decatur on Charleston, on the south side of the street. The decor is clean and cheerful. We tried a number of dishes because I wanted to have a sampling, but especially as I make Monday more pleasant with special food leftovers. We had the corn sticks (surullitos) appetizers which are very good. My husband ordered the sauteed steak with onions, and the french fries. He was over the moon about the tender steak and looked so happy! I got the grilled chicken with onions, which comes with salad, plus I had the mafongo (plantains, garlic, and pork rinds), and fried plantains. The Habichuelas/stewed beans are so flavorful, with great seasoning. The portions are generous. Our waiter, Jorge, and all the staff were very helpful and we certainly intend to come back soon with friends, to try all the great looking, freshly prepared foods. Come check it out!! ps my tough reviewer husband suggested I rate Sofrito Rico  5!!!!! This hardly ever happens!!",

First off this is the most mediocre Puerto Rican food i've had in a LONG TIME and that is saying a lot considering i constantly go out of my way to find and taste different \"Sazon's\". Where do i begin to describe this, the 'Bacalaitos' were horrible, soggy and tasteless; 'Alcapurrias' had no seasoning and were rather bland and for the size they were certainly NOT worth the money spent, As for the 'corn sticks' they were as thin as a No. 2 pencil, it is almost as if the cooks or owners have never had REAL corn sticks before.   Overall this place deserves NO STARS in my book, Not to mention when i got home i realized i had not gotten both of my orders i paid for instead i got only one. Take my advice and save your money, This place is expensive for no reason. You are better off stopping by the Thai place located next to them and getting some decent food there as i was left hungry, with missing food and tasteless/bland fritters. Never again!",

Growing up we didn't live with my Puerto Rican side of the family so I was deprived of all my daily doses of this good food. Today I found some new family!!   It's located in a building thats like a food court with other places inside and cafeteria style tables, Sofrito Rico is the first restaurant you see when you go inside. I ordered the Mofongo con Carne Frita, Pernil con Arroz con gandules which comes with a side of potato salad, 2 relleno de papa, and Arroz con dulce all togo. The woman in the front was so nice and inviting, I loved her, and the guys in the back were nice as well. They packed up my food and I was on my way! As soon as I got in the car the smell was overwhelming, took everything I had not to dig in right there!! When I got home I made a lovely plate for myself that had a taste of everything. Everything was so good but the different porks were the stars on the plate, so tender and juicy!   Overall, Puerto Rican or not, this is some great food and the place to be!!

    "text": "Man, after waiting for some time to try this place out, I finally had some time figured id take the trip, keep in mind im driving from st rose and maryland pkwy.  Placed order on grub hub and headed out to pick up the order...  Reason for the first star deduction: Get there, walk in and head towards the lil cash register area, 2 servers there, one puts her hand up liek give me a moment, she says the order is missing the pasteles, so i take a seat, and wait assuming that's my order since i ordered some, and wait and wait, finally get up to ask about the order, same server just walks off... so i have a seat play with my phone for a bit, same server keeps walking by me, keep in mind i just walked in, and ive been sitting here for 10, maybe 15 minutes, no one has greeted me or even asked what im there for, had i already not paid with my credit card at this point i would have left, so finally the owner comes out greets me, I let her know was waiting to pick up order, and wait a few more minutes, she finally asks my name, none of the servers seem to know about my order so i tell her its from grub hub, and low and behold my order sitting there, im ret to GO.. but she go grabs my coco rico's, at this point i should have checked my order but I have a long drive back and ready to GRUB.  Now i get ALLLL the way back home, crack open my food, and my pasteles are missing, thus the second star, may i was HOT!!!  Overall the food was BOMB!!! just forgot the pasteles in my order :*( , if i'm in the area I will most certainly stop in to grab something to eat, if picking up something and you take a long drive id suggest checking your order before leaving",

Was at there new location on Charleston few weeks back, again food was great but I took exception to there pastilles. Mushy and no flavor sorry to say. Service was great but slow but I attribute that to they cook to order so that's good. Pricing is up there$$  But I'll come back to see if there pastilles are better.  Was craving PR food so off I go this weekend to Sofritos ordered Pernil,arroz con gandules, pastel, maduros and Malta wow all I can say rice was perfect, pastel was just like mamas  pernil was juicy garlicky with just the right amount of pepper and salt good thing I had not eating all day cause they served me enough for two.  Got my PR. Christmas dinner early I'll be back before New Years. The waitresses were very prompt and sweet",

Upon our arrival we waiting for 5 minutes before we were sat or even welcomed in a VERY unoccupied restaurant (there were only two tables sat) once sat our waitress dropped off menus and just walked away. After ten minutes our waitress finally returned just to take drink orders, our drinks of course took another ten minutes to arrive, she returned and took our order and had a very arrogant tone the entire time with terrible service, after I almost finished my soda she then decided to throw a straw at me. We then paid for our food and took it to go because at this point we were fed up, service was terrible",

So this time, I asked them to substitute the sweet plantains with their well-seasoned fried pork chunks. Much better! I added a side of Puerto Rican rice, yum as always. And I split a stuffed potato ball with my daughter, excellent.  Side note: I walked in at 6:10, was concerned they might be out of food or starting to shut down. But, no worries. They were in full swing, had everything I wanted, and my takeout bag was ready in about 15 minutes. P.S. Elsie was at the register and she is a kick!",

It has all the usual suspects (except, oddly, arroz con pollo, which they didn't have, at least the night I was there), and a couple other items that I was not aware of, despite my New York upbringing. Like the Potato ball. Wow, just spherical meat and starch goodness, deeply fried. You can't do better than that.  But other items were less successful, like some fried pancake thing (was that the torta?), and the corn cake thing, both of which we are greasy and a little hard. The stewed chicken (as I call it) was delicious, though it needed rice or potatoes to go with. The sauteed shrimp was plump and cooked  well, but there was too much butter (said no one ever, I  know). To be fair,  they said they had run out of a lot of food due to some event or party. It was busy, too. They were probably pretty slammed and not at their best. I would drop in again if circumstances permit. Buena suerte.",

Well priced and the quality is worth it.   Can't wait to go back see you next week.    Went back today again to make sure my first time wasn't just a luck of the draw.  But nope, another amazing experience and lunch.  Didn't eat a lot just some fried foods I missed from PR. Today I got an accapurria and a relleno de papa. Both perfect both exactly if not better than I remember.  Such a Gem off the strip.  Please try it out.",

Ridiculous.  I'm originally from New York and this was straight out of my grandparents', Southern Blvd in the 70s.  I had Alcapurria, Bacalao, Mofongo, Pernil with rice and gandules and Maduros and a stomach ache after I swore I wasn't going out with a box; I was going to show my son how to do it.  In the end I went out with a box like a sucker.  All of the food I had was of astounding quality and well underpriced.  Everything tasted fantastic.  Like a newb I ordered what I did in order thinking it would take them time.  All of that hit my table at one time like, \"HI!\" and I had to deal with it.   This place is astounding.  I don't give 5 star reviews because nothing is perfect but I don't see how this could have felt or tasted any better.",

So glad I made the decision to finally come here because the food is so delicious! My husband was very happy with the menu and the food itself. The food was so tasty and fresh. We got here when it opened but what we ordered took a little bit of time to cook but was well worth the wait! The prices are awesome the location is clean and comfortable. Our waiter was so friendly, such great service! We will definitely be back to enjoy another meal with our family of 4.

And what is important to know is there are two kinds of food there, super fancy celebrity chef amazing food, and delicious, simple comforting minimally spiced country food. And when I say comfort food, I really mean comforting for the PR Locals that have grown up on it.  With that said, Sofrito Rico is exactly that simple, yummy PR Comfort food!! Don't go expecting something fancy! This is not fancy. The dining room is basically a small food court. Sofrito is the first business on the left side once you walk in.  I was SO EXCITED to see that this was here, based on another Yelp review from one of my Yelp friends, I knew I had to go! And soon! I love good PR Food! Let me tell you, this is the real deal!  I ordered.... tostones (twice cooked green plantains) with \"mayo-ketchup\" sauce. -YUM!!! And only $3!  relleno de papa - fried mashed potato ball with ground beef in the center.  Really good! Also only $3 bacalitos - crispy fried fishy yummy! Just have one, they are light and delicious. and the slow cooked pork, with PR Rice, and Potato salad. Really good too!!  All fantastic, and reminiscent of my car adventures through out the countryside of Puerto Rico!",

It was topped with sliced onions so be sure and specify if you're not a fan of onions.  The rice was well cooked, tender, flavorful and the spices well balanced.  The beans are surprisingly tasty, again tender, flavorful and well balanced; served up in a small bowl with a broth just thick enough to eat with a fork.  Request a spoon, you'll want to get to the last drop!  I found the plantains without the sauce to be bland for my taste but then I'm not particularly familiar with the many types of plantain creations.  Overall, a very satisfying and filling meal; chicken, beans, rice, and plantain sides for $14 plus $3 for the fish appetizer.   Well done Sofrito! Buen Apetito!",

From sorrullos, rellenos de papa, maduros, yuca frita, Coco Rico, Malta India, churrasco with chumichurri to tostones and just everything else you could possibly imagine -- I'm glad I took the leap of faith to try it. The desserts weren't amazing but everything else was divine. Clean, casual, friendly service.",

Tripleta, Trifongo, and tostones.  Tripleta normally made with chopped ham, pernil (roasted pork shoulder) and some steak , this was a joke. First has chicken marinated like escabeche (vinegar, garlic, oil, and onion). Complete off balance on the flavor. The rest; pernil and steak was honestly good. Small bolillo, not pan sobao (soft bread). Seriously, $11.25? Ha, no way!   The Trifongo tasted good. Need more garlic and pork in the mofongo. Expecting more but it was what it was described.  Tostones, 1/2 cooked. Literally, soft in the middle, barely any color, looked like frozen Goya tostones from El Marketon. Fry them a little longer.   Look, I get to replicate flavors from the island sometimes are a little hard but don't call yourself \"Authentic\" when maybe you're trying to make fusion.",

Both times I've ordered the Pernil, (roasted pork) Maduros (fried sweet bananas) and Arroz con Gandules (yellow rice with beans)   The pork is so freaking tender and full of garlic flavor! The rice is nice and fluffy (not to wet like some Spanish rice is) seasoned well and it has the beans and green olives in it too. The sweet fried bananas are a delicious treat at the start of the meal or at the end.   You have to get a side of the garlic dipping sauce to pour over the roasted pork. That right there adds such a great kick to the dish!   Also ordered the Yuca Fries. Kinda like a potato but not, if you're not familiar what Yuca is. Served like fries and it comes with the yummy garlic dipping sauce.",

This little restaurant sits unassuming in a corner of a strip of stores but the tastes should make this the anchor of the plaza.   The plantains are anything but PLAINtains. They burst with sweetness and perfectly balanced the savory flavors of the rice and chicken. The stewed beans were also a great compliment - worth a slight up-charge to add extra to the bowl.    Lastly, if you like more spice ask for their bottle of hot sauce- which is picked peppers in vinegar. Muy bueno!  One thing they could do is improve the bathroom conditions. The men's room needs cleaning and fixing.  But hold it if you must - the food makes it worth it:)",

First, the service was excellent so friendly and welcoming. Then the food cane out. Delicious, fresh, and prepared with love. Very well seasoned, the trifongo was garlicky, moist, every bite was so good. The alcapurria wasn't greasy and the meat was well seasoned and they put enough of it.

    "text": "Was really looking forward to eating here for the first time. Sadly I was extremely disappointed!!  When we arrived there were about 8 tables and only 3 parties in line . Not one single person acknowledged us for a good 15-20 min as we stood there waiting. When we finally were asked how many were in our Party he told us they would clean up the tables and be with us in a moment. Hahaha This was the best part, the server continues to chat it up with the other sever and Never cleaned up the tables . We just stood there waiting like idiots , so my mother, who was with us, grabbed a rag and started to clear the plates and clean the tables her self. The server embarrassed came over to help her but did not even ask her to stop cleaning , he cleaned right along side of her . Wow just wow.   Finally sat down and waited Another 30 minutes to receive our drink order and that was only because after waiting for 30 minutes we asked for it again. After we received our drinks another hour later we got our food.  And once we did get our food it was so cold! Steak is not edible cold. When I let the sever know , he told me he would take care of it . When he brought it back it was still cold and now all dried up , probably from the microwave he put it in. My mother-in-law who is a vegan requested her dish to not have any pork in it. Of course she received the dish with pork all mixed in. Are you kidding me ??? It doesn't end there   All of our sides were forgotten, we had to remind him several times to finally receive them.  No one could even get a refill on the drinks , I practically stood up my self to go and grab the refill my self.   All in all , this was the worst restaurant experience we have ever had. So unless you have 3-4 hours to waste on terrible service and crappy food I would not recommend this place to anyone.",

    "text": "We were in Las Vegas for my wedding on 3/28. We rolled deep from New York, and New Mexico  and I was so happy to find a Rican restaurant. I had friends coming in from New Mexico who only had the opportunity to eat my cooking, and it was nice to be able to introduce them to things that I don't (or can't) normally cook . Plus, it was also a pleasure to not have to eat overly priced food on the strip.   Ambiance = Its a little hole in the wall, cafeteria/Food Court style restaurant so don't expect anything fancy. These are usually the places that have the best comida.  Food = I ordered the Mofongo with Shrimp/Garlic. The mofongo was moist, and delicious but like another yelper said, the garlc sauce could've used a little salt.  Since I was greedy, I was trying everyone else food as well (Its a good thing I had already gotten married the day before or I probably wouldnt have fit into my dress lol).   I tried the Carnitas fritas (which BTW I ended up ordering my own to go),  Arroz con gandules (which was just as delicious the next day),  Bacalaito (which was tasty but a little greasy),  Bistec encebollado (which was not dry, or too vinegary and was very VERY yummy).   We will have to make this our new spot and will make sure to to hit it at least once every visit out to LV.   BUEN PROVECHO!!!",

We ordered the cheese alcapurias, papa rellenas, and the empanadas and M ordered arroz con habichuelas & pernil. They were all good but the cheese alcapurias were the winner!  Highly recommend!  But overall the food was very fairly priced.  The atmosphere was very pleasing, Our only real complaint overall was the extremely long wait. It took a few more minutes to get our apps. To their credit, however, our server did warn us that it would take a while, which made the wait slightly less irking. To sum: great food, very clean, fair prices, fun atmosphere, good service, little wait.  Visited March 2016",

No doubt the definition of an \"Under the Radar\" location, the indoor counter one of many in a dingy space seemingly made specifically for folks attending a nearby community college, Sofrito Rico presents a variety of authentic Puerto Rican options on laminated menus as well as an overhead flatscreen television and with a deceptively large working space that appears sparkling clean from the window the service offered is equally spotless, suggestions provided as requested and all questions answered with a smile.  Modestly priced across the board, appetizers mostly $3 or under with proper meals rarely crossing into double digits, dining at Sofritio Rico is offered both dine-in as well as take-out and with Grubhub delivery plus over-the-phone ordering offered for those in a hurry it warrants mention that wait times are entirely dependent on time of day, the made-to-order freshness leading to a twenty minute delay to delivery of our sizable four-person order.  Not particularly a \"light\" style of cooking, the majority of items either fried or served with sides of bean stew or Puerto Rican-style rice, approximately one-half of the Sofrito Rico menu focuses on streetfood classics and whether one opts for Empanadas in one of three varieties, well-seasoned Potato Balls stuffed with Ground Beef, or enormous fritters of briny shredded salt cod tastebuds are likely to be pleased with the resultant flavors as well as textures, all three virtually oilless and most portions sharable by two.  Less so \"finger food,\" but no less delicious or worthy of cost, those seeking something sweeter to start the meal are encouraged to investigate either the Alcapurrias that match tender taro with shredded pork or intensely sweet pan-seared Maduros, the elongated Surullitos something like batter-dipped polenta but not quite as creamy, the sort of thing that required dipping sauce to be truly enjoyable - something provided by the  Sandoval's in the form of ketchup mixed with Mayo.  Doubling up on Tostones, the weighty fried pressed Plantain discs offered alongside cubes of fried pork and then as a side dish dressed in Garlic it was with mashed Mofongo that the meal marched onward, the rustic presentation starchy but soft with a surprisingly complex depth of savory flavors.  Undoubtedly over-ordering, an $80 tab yielding enough food to satiate a group nearly twice our size, the meal's final savory featured a pair of crispy bone-in Pork Chops lightly fried next to bean and potato stew plus Puerto Rican Fried Rice, the later far better than expected while the former possessed an odd pungency that saw most cut themselves off after just one bite.  Told by the server that desserts were \"great\" it was with four small cups that the meal would end, and although generally not usually impressed by coconut it was a welcome surprise that the creamy Coconut Custard called \"Tembleque\" was every bit as spoon-worthy as the sticky rice pudding teeming with cinnamon and raisins plus coconut cream and ginger.  ****Limited only by the sketchy dining room and fixed seating that puts adjacent diners knee-to-knee Sofrito Rico Authentic Puerto Rican Cuisine offers great food at an equally impressive pricepoint considering both quality and portions with smiling service that seems as eager to educate as it is to please.",

The menu had a good selections of items at reasonable prices. The food we ordered was hit or miss with the seasoning. Here are the items we purchased:  Bacalaitos: Was good. exactly how i remembered eating them as a kid so I know how they made them. Was hoping they used a little more actual cod.  Beef Empanadas: Were good and a good size Rellenos de papa: the size was small and you were only given one. tostones al Ajillo: Good garlic flavor but needed salt Pernil with Arroz con gandules: Pernil was very salty. I think it was because it was the last of what they had left so it was the bottom of the pan. The Arroz con gandules was good Pollo Frito with White Rice and Stewed beans: This was OK.   I'll definitely give it another try.",

Maybe I was really into garlic that day, but they were yummy. Their mofongo's are to die for as well! Their meats are cooked to perfection and that pasteles! Scrumptious!   Also, don't forget to try that coco rico soda. OH, and if they have this guava cheesecake, I believe it was, DAMN! Get it if they have it.  NOTE: This place is near CSN. It's easy to miss. It's in the campus commons and there are other restaurants in there. This is the only one worth going to.",

Everything is so authentic this place deserves 5 stars for the delicious food they serve but unfortunately their lack in customer service is why they only ge 4 stars. I like to be greeted, seated and acknowledged. However, when my bf and i walked in we received none of that. The only reason we stayed was because we knew the food was going to be great and we had come all the way from california and were not going to just leave.  After finally being attended, the waitress was far more focused chit chatting with some co workers, family and/or friends that were at the corner table rather than actual paying customers.   Other than that, the food was great! best puertorican restaurant I have ever experienced, food wise. The only reason i would go back is for the food of course lol. Hopefully they upgrade their service and realize that when people go to this type of restaurants they want to be treated right, this is the kind of food i grew up with, it felt as if it came from my mothers kitchen but the love was just not there.",

In the past there were others and didn't last probably because their food was Caribbean at best .  This place is Puertorican flavor 100%. Huge selection so come hungry plan on coming back several times, I know I will.  There goes my cholesterol.    Why only 4 stars? =The only negative I have is that they share the sitting area with two other restaurants. Today there was a smell in the sitting area. Hopefully it is an isolated incident. There are a couple of tables outside and you can alway take to go.  Highly recommend this place.",

    "text": "DELICIOSO!!  I'm so glad that I finally got to try this place after reading Stefany V.'s review and seeing references to \"Porto's\" (in Los Angeles) and \"potato balls.\"  I love Porto's, a very popular place that always has a line because their food is so bomb dot com.  When fellow first-timer Amelinda L. and I met for MLK Day lunch today, there wasn't a line at 12:15pm, but one quickly formed after we sat down.    After perusing the menu that offers several tempting items, I settled on the potato ball filled with ground beef (Rellenos de Papa) to start, the fried mashed plantains with chicken (Mofongo Con Pollo) as my main dish, and a Puerto Rican tamale with pork (Pasteles) as a side.  Yes, that was all for me, but I knew that I could just take home whatever was left.  I love plantains and the Mofongo did not disappoint.  It's served with a mayo/ketchup combo that you can spread on the Mofongo and YUM!  The grilled chicken had a lot of flavor, as well.  The rice ball is one big orb of tastiness with the ground beef and potato combo reminiscent of a Filipino dish my mother makes.  The only let-down was the pasteles as I didn't really taste anything special; it was bland to me.  Oh, there was a second let-down:  when we ordered, there were cheese-filled sugar pastries (Quesitos) in a case on the counter for sale.  I didn't get one at the beginning, thinking that I could get one on the way out if I still felt like having dessert.  Of course, there were none left as we were leaving: womp womp.  It just gives me another reason to return to try that as well as the fried sweet plantains (Maduros), the cream cheese guava flan (Flan de Queso y Guayaba), the coconut custard (Trembleque), the Mofongo with shrimp, and more.  This place is bomb dot com, tambien.",

    "text": "FINALLY! A True Caribbean restaurant in Vegas! I'm a big fan of Puerto Rican cuisine and this restaurant is a great representation of it in Vegas. I tried alcapurria, bacalao, and a chicken stew plate with rice and beans.  Both alcapuria and bacalao are deep fried so don't expect them to be anything else but greasy. Alcapuria had a great flavor, the dough was just as I remember it being in Puerto Rico. The first time I tried bacalao was from a food truck in San Juan, Puerto Rico it was may be like 50 cents and I thought it was amazing! Sofrito's bacalao definitely brought back some happy memories, it's a dried coated fish that's deep fried to perfection. LOVE! It should be eaten right away, as it get's tough when it's cooled down. I also loved the chicken stew, I love stewed chicken period. This one had a great flavor and the chicken was tender, it paired perfectly with rice and beans. The location of the restaurant is accessible but could be better. It is located in a food court type of building that says \"internet cafe\", there are a few more restaurants there and seating available if you are planning to stay. It may work well being a cross the street from a school campus (CSN) but an establishment like this deserves it's own space. It would be nice to have an authentic Puerto Rican restaurant that would also offer an ambiance.",

When I heard their was a Puerto Rican restaurant here in Las Vegas after 8 years I was there and the smells from the kitchen took me to a familiar and happy place. In the time since my first visit I've ordered almost everything on the menu, and compared to the Puerto Rican food I've tasted on the east coast and my own mothers the food here is mediocre. Pastelillos (beef empanadas are to greasy and the meat over seasoned, the arroz con gandules were a  bit too dry and the gandules a bit hard. The grilled chicken was very dry. The bacalao was so greasy I struggled to eat it. The pollo guisao was actually my favorite dish so far. Mofongos are also a bit too oily but still one of my favs and the rellenos de papas are good, their flan de queso y guayaba is amazing and of course the original Malta Indias are the best. I still go, and will continue to support this business. I understand it requires money to pay seasoned chefs, but I think it will pay off in the long run. The owner and the employees are great this is a review based on food quality alone. Just went by the new location earlier today and loved it. Just my honest opinions, you will continue to receive my business.",

    "text": "First time coming here heard all the riff raff about the place. Wish I had experienced what I've heard about the food and service. When I first walked in I barely was greeted yet wasn't sure if I should sit myself or be seated. Once I sat a young server came by asked what I wanted to drink and brought a menu. I order the tostones  , beef empanada which were great! I also ordered grilled chicken and arroz con gandulas... Rice was fine but the chicken was served a bit raw to me. After seeing the chicken a bit raw after taking multiple bites from it it turned my stomach. The owner was on the floor and another server asked if I needed anything else and I showed her when I noticed. I wasn't rude,nor loud not even upset I just said the chicken was a bit raw and bloody. I wasn't looking for anything free...I was understandable and calm. She informed the owner and she walked over -didn't apologize about the raw chicken simply asked me if I wanted a new plate or just have the chicken recooked. I said whichever is fine still no type of sincerity or sympathy. I paid for My entire meal no questions asked. I didn't eat the chicken had it to go. I was calm and extremely nice For a new customer to check a new place and have eaten a few bites from a raw chicken. Maybe if the customer service, the owner cared and was better, genuine when mistakes happen. It could  have turned this experience better and would have made me to want to come back. For that I won't return.",

We ordered the Chuleta Frita con Arroz con Gandules, a papa relleno, an alcapurria, guineitos en escabeche, an a beef empenada. The food was AMAZING!!! My wife said she literally was about to cry, it reminded her of home so much, and she is very hard to impress, believe me. If you are a fan of Puerto Rican food, I mean real Puerto Rican food, then this is the place for you. The location is in a food court type of building, not the most welcoming or comfortable atmosphere, but since El Coqui went out of business years ago, this is pretty much your only choice, but a better choice. El Coqui would have been in trouble with the quality and authenticity of Sofrito Rico.",

I had the fried pork chops and they were cooked to perfection. Flavor was delicious. I can honestly drive the 4 hours just to go have a meal there again. If you are planning a trip to Vegas you have to eat here. This is what food is supposed to taste like. WOW Keep on cooking. Hope to see you all soon my amigos.",

    "text": "Being a Boricua from Chicago, I was really excited to find out we got a Puerto Rican restaurant in Vegas as I have practically been denied these things for the last four years I have been here. There are many things we can make at home but there are also many things that are just way to time consuming and can be difficult to make properly if you have no experience making them. Overall the food was great. Some things were made a little differently than I am used to but they tasted good never the less. There were only two main things that disappointed me. 1. They don't make make Morcilla. Which I guess could have been expected seeing as how they probably don't sell that in any butcher shops in Vegas. Still a little disappointed. And 2. They were out of Pasteles!!! Huge disappointment! That was what we were looking forward to more than anything else. Anyway, even though they didn't have everything we wanted, the food was really good. We will be visiting again.",

Mexican food is also usually easier to make especially because everything you need to make it is readily available here. Along with that sometimes ingredients are very hard to come by & if you substitute them with something from the Spanish supermarket it will loose all the quality & the flavor. I sometimes will cook Puerto Rican food myself but I have to be selective on what I make because it will taste horrible if you decide to substitute ingredients. Things being in season is also True, sometimes depending on the season, things are harder to come by and the food you want to make is limited. Honestly makes me want to move back east.",

We ordered mofongo con camarones al ajillo. ( For those not familiar with pr cuisine it's fried and mashed green plantain with garlic shrimp. ) You don't have to worry about dry mofongo here! The portion was large enough for about 2-3 people and it was perfectly seasoned and moist.   We also got the arroz con habichuelas (rice and beans). Both were perfectly seasoned.   For desert, arroz con dulce- super rich and delicious!   I'll definitely be coming back for the mofongo when I'm feeling to lazy to make it myself. Also I can't wait to try the other menu items.",

    "text": "Four of us met here for a \"fast food\" kind of dinner as we all had a show to attend after dinner.  Sofrito is in what is called Campus Commons and it's the former waiting area for the car wash/detailing business that was here and closed years ago.  The inside waiting room was converted into small food vendor areas with a common seating area running the length of the building.  Some of the businesses got their start here and moved on while some failed.  On this evening, we ordered:  Alcapurrias - Fried Taro Root filled with Pork Empanadas con Pollo - Chicken in Puff Pastry Rellenos de Papa - Potato Balls filled with Ground Beef Surullitos - Fried Corn Sticks Maduros - Sweet Plantains Carne Frita con Tostones - Fried Pork Chunks with Fried Plantains Tostones al Ajillo - Fried Plantains with Garlic Sauce Bacalaitos - Fried Cod Fish Fritters Chuletas Fritas with Arroz con Gandules - Crispy Pork Chop with Puerto Rican Fried Rice Mofongo - Fried Mashed Plantains Arroz con Dulce - Cinnamon Rice Pudding with Raisins Tembleque - Coconut Custard  Standouts for me were the rellenos de Papa, bacalaitos, empanadas, alcapurrias, and mofongo.  On the sweet side, both desserts were very good with the rice pudding being different from the creamy rice pudding you normally get and the coconut custard.  I wish they had some utensils other than plastic but given the type of place the food court is, that's got to be the way to go.   The owner of the business was a delight.  After placing the order, wed had a seat at the less than comfortable, built-in seats of the food court, and she brought our dishes to us with a pleasant smile.  There was a lot of food ordered--a bill coming to $80, but for that amount, we had more than enough for four people.  I'm sure I'll be back to get some Rellenos de Papa and mofongo.  Oh, and I can't forget the rice pudding.",

Although not the best I've had, it'll do. I ordered the Alcapurria, Bacalaito, and the Pernil(Roast Pork) with Gandule Rice...and Pasteles to go ;)  I enjoyed the flavors and crunchiness of the taro of the Alcapurria, but it is kinda tiny for $3. A better value at the same price is the ginormous Bacalaito. It's like biting into tasty fish and chips  (without the chips ) and this thing was bigger than my hand! The Pernil was a tad bit on the salty/greasy side, and the gandules in the rice were a little hard.  I've had softer Pasteles, and SR's version is kinda dense, but okay...personal preference I guess...maybe I'll give it another try later, but for now, it's just shy of being a fan. ALOHA!!!

When you walk in the smell is amazing. Made me feel like I was in abuelas cocina. I ordered to go and my server Jeorge was very nice and friendly. Turns out he too is from NY!!  The food is priced all separate but still reasonable although the portions could be a little bigger. I ordered pollo a la parilla y arroz con gandules with an order of maduros and a Malta India. The food was Yum! Delicious!! Can't wait to go back and try other things in the menu.",

I don't claim to be any sort of Puerto Rican expert, but the hordes of other diners raving about their food can't all be wrong!  POTATO BALLS: $3/each, and huge. Filling doesn't have quite as much seasoning to it as the aforementioned competitor, but I have very few other versions to compare it to.  Tasty! TOSTONES: Crispy flattened and fried green plantains with garlic sauce. The sauce is more like a spicy mayo than garlic sauce I've had elsewhere, but a generous portion for $3. CAMARONES AL AJILLO: Garlic shrimp with traditional rice and beans. Home cooking and so good. Large portion, $10 plate, clearly made with love.  I haven't tried too much of the menu, but I live dangerously close and based on the quality of the dishes I've had, I'm open to trying many more things- particularly the yucca frita, empanadas, and some of the pork dishes.  If the crowd on opening weekend is any indication, this spot is on the fast track to getting their own brick and mortar location soon! Menu is surprisingly large considering the small space they have to work with. Hopefully they stay busy and successful, but I'm crossing my fingers that the kitchen staff gets more efficient as they settle in- an hour to place and receive a takeout order is a bit much for a food court. I would say to call ahead and place your order, but they haven't answered any of my calls so far. Despite these deterrents, I know I'll be back.  EDIT: OMG the bacalaito. How they fit so much tasty salty, fishy flavor in such a thin crispy dish?! And their arroz con gandules is so consistently good that when I'm feeling especially lazy in the kitchen, I grab a side to pair with whatever I'm cooking for dinner. Love the new, larger location too!",

I was planning on making a trip to NY just to eat!    Today was their soft opening and I was more than happy to show up and order a bunch of stuff.    This is what I got:  alcapurrias - fried mashed taro with ground pork rellenos de papa - fried mashed potato ball with ground beef piononos - fried sweet plantains with ground beef pernil con arroz con gandules - roast pork with seasoned rice and gandule beans pollo guisado - stewed chicken with white rice and beans pork pasteles - green banana with meat wrapped in banana leaf  So for you paleo, low carb eaters - you can eat here!!    Everything was so good, I was stuffed to the max after sharing with my family.  I want to try everything on the menu!  But my favorite today was the pernil.    It's a family owed business (from Puerto Rico!!) and they were super nice, friendly and I can't wait to go back!",

The food was ok some of the food could of been seasoned better it is better than nothong but probably wont satisfy a Puerto Rican craving. Specially if you have had authentic Puerto rican food. A bit pricey since everything is a la carte. I rather go to the one on the strip. Puerto rico express",

    "text": "I knew I liked Puerto Rican food after tasting San Juan in Riverside, CA. You think it'd be unfair to say Sofrito Rico makes me love it? Does it really matter? It does... To this place I'm sure it would be a gold plated compliment.  For a first and only meal this past Saturday, after running errands and garden shopping, I needed food to fill my stomach and last me energy to the end of the day. And I have no regrets in picking them from my bookmarks.  Opening the door I can see they're a favorite. Before leaving another family walked in. I've ordered from a well chosen restaurant.  Arroz con gandules - it's rice with peas, green olives, and beans. Flavor score! I would've been satisfied with the rice alone. I don't eat rice daily, but if I had to, this would be one of my absolute picks.   Pollo guisado... guisado usually means sauteed. In this dish the chicken was so delish it didn't need the sauce that it came with; which was separated since my order was placed to-go. I'm a soupy rice person if there is sauce or broth to pour over - so make my rice swim please.  Maduros - the sweet fried plantains. I could've done without it since rice is heavy. But I learned with this cuisine, it's sorta not the same as authentic without the plantains. Fruit and meat paired in a meal. The thought is sinking in. I accept : )  That Coco Rico soda! All I'm gonna say is I need to find this at a store so I can purchase packs of it!  I ordered at the area which almost looked like a pick and point window. Even though it was not that, a young lady was available to take my order. I didn't wait more than 15 minutes for a hot meal.  Can't omit that I do recommend this place; even though it's apparent people love eating here. For those who haven't yet tasted Puerto Rican cuisine, and were curious about it, then please give your appetite a flavor favor here.",

    "text": "This was my first visit to their new location on Charleston/Decatur and the menu is very different from their days in the Campus Commons Food Court. The biggest change is the increase in prices and the emphasis on \"a la carte.\" They've gotten rid of their meals and combination offerings, so you need to order every element.  I had the Rellenos de Papa ($3/ea) and Pasteles ($5/ea) again and both were fantastic. The Rellenos de Papa are large fried mashed potato balls filled with Picadillo; very flavorful. The pasteles are similar to tamales, but the masa is created with green bananas and plantains. It has an extra smooth texture and is also packed with flavor.  Camarones al Ajillo ($13) with Mofongo ($4.50): This is another dish I've had before and this time it wasn't nearly as good. The garlic sauce is really wonderful, but the shrimp was disappointing; they were very small and the portion was abysmal for the price (it was literally served in a cup-sized bowl). Also, the mofongo was a bit dry. This combination has increased $5.50+ since their move and the quality is shaky.  Chuletas Fritas ($9.50) with Arroz Mamposteao ($2.75): The order comes with two fried pork chops and though these chops are on the small side, they were delicious. The rice is amazing! It's sauteed with spices, beans, and ham for a super flavorful dish. The Arroz Mamposteao is highly, highly recommended.  Carne Frita ($9.50) with Tostones ($3) and Yuca en Mojo de Ajo ($3): The fried pork chunks were flavorful, juicy, and lightly crispy; just delicious. I really enjoyed the Tostones (fried green plantains) as they were extra crunchy and seasoned well. I've never had yuca that wasn't fried, but this worked really well with their garlic sauce.  Notes: The Mayo-Ketchup sauce is apparently non-existent with your order of Mofongo now. Also, the Starters and Regular Sides (front of the menu) are priced higher than their counterparts on the back of the menu when ordered with protein entrees - up to 60% more - and most of them are the same portions. Besides the Alcapurria, Empanadilla, Rellenos de Papa, Pasteles, etc, I'd recommend starting with the protein entrees and purchasing sides with it. **They will not adjust your bill if you order a side before or after ordering your entree and will charge you the higher price!**  The food is still very delicious and perhaps if it were closer to home, I may opt to visit more. However, I'm really disappointed about the huge price increases! I understand the necessity of raising prices to support the new brick-and-mortar location, but you used to be able to get a meal (one protein and two sides) for under $10. Now, that same meal costs 45% more. For lunch, our bill was over $100 (with tax and tip) for four people. Definitely a turn-off.",

    "text": "***!!!UPDATE TO ORIGINAL REVIEW!!!***  Decided to take my family for dinner tonight.  I'm so tempted to leave one star but won't.  We arrived at 4:50 on Father's Day.  There were 5 of us so they said they could only give us a booth near the front door/garbage can.  Apparently \"this is the only booth we can add a chair to\".  Since there was no other option at the time we took the booth.  It's was nasty hot in the restaurant.  We were told \"well it's hot outside\". While this is correct, one would expect that inside it would be comfortably air cooled.  Anyway, we were told that they've added some fans.  Obviously they know their air conditioner isn't sufficient.    Let's get past all that and move on over to the food.  The tostones were excellent, served with garlic sauce and mayo/ketchup.  The carne frita was good but my sides were wrong.  I didn't make a bid deal about it.  My step-mom also got the wrong sides, she asked for a replacement.  Two orders were perfectly correct.  Now for the final order, the pernil for my Dad, it didn't come out until all 4 of us were done.  They had some lame excuse that they made to much so it was in the oven!?!  Well that was not True.  They forgot to make it.  When it finally came to the table it was 75% fat!!!  Wtf!?  We are so disappointed.  Not one apology.  Not even an acknowledgment of an error.  Service is lacking and quality food on this occasion was subpar in my opinion.   Review #1   It's about time we have some authentic Puerto Rican food in Vegas!  No, I am not Puerto Rican but yes, I am married to one and have been to PR and know how to cook it too.  We've been maybe 4 times and well it's only fair I give them props!  We order the same thing each time as it's that good.  My husband, Cesar Q. gets the steak with onions and I get the carne frita (fried pork chunks).  You order your entree or \"protein\" and then for an added cost you can choose up to 3 sides at lower prices.  The rice and stewed beans are on point as are the maduros (fried sweet plantains).  The tostones (flattened and fried plantains) are great with the mayo-ketchup on the side.  We also enjoy the fried potato ball.   The location is where the OLD Red Rock movie theater was located if your a local like me, you know where that is (off Decatur and Charleston).  Prices are reasonable and the staff is very friendly and welcoming.  I do feel they nickel and dime you a tad but whatever it's the only authentic PR restaurant in town.",

    "text": "Wow! Finally an authentic Puerto Rican restaurant in Las Vegas!!!!!!  Or so I thought!  The wife (Ellen F.) and I have placed take-out orders here numerous times and we're somewhat satisfied I guess.  Issues with take-out are that the little cup of beans (if you order them as a side) are filled with a gigantic piece of potato or carrot.  Is this a big deal!? Well considering it's approx a 6oz cup you get very little beans!  So it's a ripoff.  If you want any sauce, they charge extra.  We tried the shrimp and garlic sauce, it came with 5 shrimp (think frozen Costco type). The food is good but in my opinion, it's very high priced for what you get.  Take-out orders seem to get half portions.  Today we opted to take my in-laws to dinner. It was a complete fiasco.  The A/C barely works as it's super hot inside.  We were told \"we'll it's hot outside\".  That makes perfect sense.  Let's make it hot inside too so you swear while you eat!? The services is lacking as orders come out incorrect.  Wrong rice and beans on 2 meals.  Orders do not come out at the same time either.  4 out of 5 of us got our food.  We were completely finished by the time meal number 5 arrived.  When meal number 5 arrived it was mostly fat!!  I'll attach a picture below.  It's sad.  We were genuinely excited to have a real Puerto Rican restaurant in town.  If every meal is like tonight, we will not be back.  It looks like we will stick with Florida Cafe for a taste of the Caribbean (Cuban cuisine).",

I'll give them the benefit of the doubt because they just opened a week ago and they were about to close in an hour BUT knowing its a Saturday and your the only Puerto Rican restaurant in Las Vegas,  you definitely need to step up your game! Pretty pricey for the amount of food they give you. Ordered a side of arroz con gandules $4 and it already came in a small container and they didn't even fill it. Food was very good but don't be stingy for those prices. I'll come again but I'll give them a couple months took get the hang of things.",

Sofrito Rico is located in that Campus Food Court place on Charleston along with a few other restaurants. I think it's kind of an incubator for smaller food places to get their feet on the ground and prepare for the big leagues, and if what I saw was any indication they'll have a \"real\" restaurant in no time. Every other place was closed and almost every table was taken by Sofrito Rico customers.  To the food: Everything was great.   The Bacalaito was amazing and had perfect flavor, it reminded me of sitting on outside a kiosko and eating on a sunny Puerto Rican day.   The Mofongo was also pretty awesome, perfectly garlic-y (is that a word?)  I had the fried pork and that was also very very good, a perfect match for the mofongo I'd been searching for all these years.  I eagerly await the day that there is a Mofongo Relleno de Churrasco and cans of Medalla on the menu.  The service was a little slow, 40 mins or so, but it was worth the wait. Plus, that's all part of the full Puerto Rican experience.  :)",

I had high hopes for Sofrito, and I wasn't disappointed, felt like I was in San Juan again. I like the casual vibe. Even the environment is authentic--don't expect fancy, think cozy and fun. The staff is friendly, efficient, and very attentive; they deliver on the gracious hospitality I'd expect from a mom-and-pop restaurant in San Juan. The a la carte menu is fine with me since all the dishes I care about are offered. The food arrived quickly, portions were generous, everything was fresh and well-presented. And oh, the FLAVOR! I ordered grilled chicken with arroz y gandules and tostones, which reminded me of El Coqui's pechuga encebollada. I asked for the garlic sauce on the side for the chicken and tostones, which added the extra flavor I'd been jonsing for. Savory, perfectly seasoned chicken--hats off to the cook for making it lean and not swimming in grease. I had an enjoyable experience, no complaints. The high quality food and reasonable prices will keep me coming back often. My advice to the diner who isn't familiar with Puerto Rican food is to not expect Mexican flavors and to be open to the differences in style that come with authentic food. If you're on the fence, just go. You'll enjoy the flavor.",

Since I have never had Puerto Rican food before, other than plantains and rice and beans, I asked the waiter what he recommended and that what I got. The pork was dry and had very little flavor. The plantains, that I typically love love love, were dry and flavorless (yes, I know they are not supposed to be sweet) The Puerto Rican rice was yummy and the Beans were perfect (and wet LOL). So, the meal was disappointing. We wont be back.",

It turns out I was in luck, because the day I decided to try it was 6/29, opening day at its new location on West Charleston.  My dining companion and I decided to order and share a variety of things - pernil & arroz con gandules, a baccalaito (which was humongous and easily shared by two people), an order of massive tostones with garlic sauce, an alcapurria and chicken empanada washed down with traditional Malta.  For dessert we had the tembleque.  Everything was so delicious we decided we had to come back at least one more time before heading back to the East Coast!  Our server, Elsie, was fantastic and full of fun personality...she helped make the dining experience even better!  On the second visit a few days later we tried things they didn't have available on opening day like the pasteles (truly some of the best I have had) and all of the things we did try on the previous day.  Everything was even better this time around.  Will definitely make several return visits on my next trip in a few months.",

Every item we tasted made us anticipate the next bite and the next. Everything was so incredibly tasty. The staff welcomed us like family. So very friendly, like we just entered their home and they were so happy to have us. Definitely a family feeling. They couldn't wait to see if we enjoyed the food and our faces said it all. Yes, yes, yes! Coming from L.A., we will make a point to eat here every time we're in town. Thank you for the amazing food and welcoming atmosphere. See you soon!",

It is a walk up window and you find a place to sit in a hallway looking room?? You get plastic plates, forks, knives and spoons!! My family of 5 went last night which was a Sat @6pm.... They close at 7???? Tried to order what we wanted but they were pretty much out of everything !!!! So we ordered what we could because we were hungry and wanted to give the food a chance.... Well ?!! The food took almost 30 min to get to us and mine was cold and dry?!? The table in front of us ordered way before us and as we were finishing our meal they still had not gotten their food?!?  Now don't get me wrong they just opened their doors last week but come on!!?? Do you Have any idea what you are in for?! Do you know how many people love Puerto Rican food??  and your closed on Sunday's .. My Spanish husband says we will give it another try in a few months to see if they got their shit together because the food was good, just bad service and variety was lacking.....",

    "text": "Second time over at their new location and I don't even know why I even gave it a second chance. Don't think I would ever consider it. I rather travel to Puerto Rico to eat puertorican food. Mainly disappointed with their service  We barely walked in the door and it was like they were waiting for us and the first insistent question was, for here or to go We couldn't decide as fast as they were expecting us to do so and when we finally gave them an answer one of them turned to the cooks not sure if she rolled her eyes but i saw when in a non-professional manner she shaked her head as if to say \"whats so hard about making a decision whether to dine in or to take it to go\"  Not to mention on my first bad experience they waited until everyone else at the table had their food to tell me they don't have what I ordered, I tried to leave it there and just wait for everyone else to finish their food, and but they insisted I order something for my inconvenience. I had to order something I didn't want just to give them a second chance and still was disappointed with the food and still had to pay for it.  this situation makes me very upset being that I am Puerto Rican and it's hard trying to find my native food here in Las Vegas hopefully they can get their service together.  Good Luck Sofrito Rico!",
