    "text": "I take no pleasure in handing out low ratings and reviewing harshly, but in some cases its necessary. From the onset, I felt a certain unease as we, a group of six were seated by the door which I clearly asked not to be. The center piece of design was in the other sitting area and our guests were unable to observe the Buddha even though I asked the host to be seated elsewhere. Vegetable Spring Rolls were low quality and filled with some form of shredded kelp seagrass, nothing else. This item can be more readily accessible in aisle six, the frozen food department at your local grocer. The Vietnamese Shrimp Rolls, only fractionally better as the peanut sauce was good and the Almond Wontons lacked any form of flavor.  The entrees had a peculiar oder, from the spare ribs to the crab fried rice (an horrid upsell by the server, $26.00 for six ounces of rice and low quality, canned crab meat.) The Duck in Orange sauce was skimpy, just one pathetic sized leg and thigh for $26.00. The House Sake was atrocious, the garnish for all dishes was so sloppy and poorly plated. There seemed to be little or no professionalism from front of the house to the back of the house in their entire approach. They tacked on a 20% gratuity which is not uncommon for parties of five or more. Is an automatic tip a good reason to work your tables in such an uncaring and unprofessional manner?  Striving for a higher total bill cost is NOT the emphasis, but it was ay SEA the culinary experience from hell. After two hundred dollars and grumbling bellies I walked out mortified.",

    "text": "I write this with mixed feelings...dining in Vegas can be complicated...I've always thought of Thai food as delicious and relatively inexpensive. Our party of 4 was there for a celebratory family dinner. We had reservations, although I doubt from the empty tables that we needed them. In our reservations I mentioned our reason for celebrating, but it was never acknowledged. We were seated by the water feature, which is a nice touch. However, there is a bright light that ruins the mood, coming from the kitchen, as well as clanging sounds of dishes getting washed. Additionally, the bus station was about 5 feet from our table. In a restaurant of this attempted caliber, I expect a better ambiance. Both situations could be easily and simply remedied with screens or curtains. Service was almost too good; wait staff kept trying to take away plates that were not yet finished. The food was good, not over the top, not overly generous in portion, but tasty. A party of 4 with 2 beers, 1 soda, and 1 water plus 4 shareable plates added up to $178, with tip. It seems a little pricey, even by Vegas standards.",

When I went with my friend in October for Halloween weekend, we were depriving ourselves of real food all weekend so we decided to try this restaurant out. It's a bit pricey than what I'm used to for Asian cuisine. I enjoyed that they served Vietnamese and Thai! Score. The decor is beautiful as well. There's a small swing the size of a ball you can rock back and forth (I don't know if that is allowed).  In the middle of the room there is a buddha sculpture with a nice \"japanese\" like setting pond around it. REALLY great atmosphere. It was kind of romantic, especially when they dim the lights and the candles are lit. I wish I was on a date.  The food was good enough, not amazing, but not terrible.   They seem to have specialities as well which is good for me since I don't want to spend 20+ per entree if I can get the same entree/presentation elsewhere.  I can't remember the other dishes we had, but we got this shrimp eggroll cocktail looking appetizer and it was TO DIE FOR! it was very cute as well.   I'll be back. ENJOY!",

It was not real busy as we were here for lunch, but there were two servers always waiting in anticipation for a customer's needs. We were checked on multiple times at our table. As for the atmosphere, SEA is intimate with water everywhere. After a long day of traveling to Vegas and waiting in lines this was the perfect place to come and relax.  I don't think I have ever had such Thai food. My friend Denise wouldn't shut up SEA for the rest of the trip. I actually had to convince her that we needed to explore the rest of Vegas, or we would have eaten every meal here.  We ordered a yummy cocktail, the pad thai and the panang curry. It was all perfect down to the white rice that came out sculpted into a little pyramid. Can I give SEA 6 stars?

Waste of time navigating through the hotel only to be turned away. Also the door was still open with no close sign. If it was policy to turn people away, it felt more like my business was not wanted because they were almost closed. I'm a very unhappy non-customer.

We enjoyed everything we ordered.  The lettuce wrap was ok, not my favorite but not bad.  Chicken satay was tasty and not dried out.  Shrimp & walnut was definitely not what we expected but really good!  It was battered & fried but really light & crispy yumminess.  And then there was the drunken noodles with shrimp, spicy and delish!!!  We did have 1 person that hates anything Asian, so she ordered the ribeye steak, for $42 it had better be good, and it was.  She said it was perfectly cooked and seasoned but she hated the ginger sauce that it came with.  I did try it and agreed with her.  Thanks for our Groupon, our meal didn't dent us too bad in our pockets, and we were told we're allowed 2 Groupons per table!  That's awesome!  Service was 5 stars!!  Very sweet server and attentive!  And the place is just beautiful with the water feature in the center of the restaurant.  I'll be back!",

The food is fresh, delicious and unique. Very well priced and generous entrees of spicy seafood and noodles plus more. Love the sea food salad.  We tried the most wonderful chefs special called the Hawaiian seafood tart it looks a bit weird but it's like a Korean pancake covered with a tempura batter over generous varieties of seafood. I would just come for that with a wine or cocktails to relax.  This will only be featured  here for a limited time. The other chef special are geyser prawns. The most gigantic prawns you have ever seen in a pot with perfectly done silver noodles. Don't want to bore you but our stomachs are so happy.  Closed between 230-5. Bar is next to them.",

The candles, water, and subdued ambiance are quite effective in combination.  The food is a win in every way.  Portions are on the large side, well prepared, and delicious!  I started off with the summer rolls from the Vietnamese side of the menu.  They were very well prepared; fresh and crispy, with grilled pork, mint, and rice noodles inside.  I had the Drunken Man's Noodles for the entree - they were flavorful, spicy, and full of meat and vegetables.  I can highly recommend this dish - have them spice it the way you like it; it's a real crowd pleaser.  When all was said and done, it was about $31 with drinks ($5 for a big thai iced tea).  That's pretty cheap for Vegas.",

No deejay, though, at least on weekdays.  Prices are much higher (about twice as much) and service is slower (even though the place is a third the size of Brooklyn's). The entrees were $16 - $18/each.  Their menu is Vietnamese on one side and Thai on the other. Ingredients are fresh and dishes are well-balanced. Good-sized portions and the kitchen is good with custom orders. Stand-out dishes are the drunken noodles, pad thai, and pineapple fried rice.  Unfortunately, the smoky smoky smoky air brought this from a 4-star down to a 3. The water also tasted chlorine-y, which should bring this down to a 2.5, except that the servers are extra-courteous (e.g., rushing to get a to-go cup so I could bring my iced coffee with me when I left).",

If you ask for very spicy, you indeed will get very spicy.  I had an excellent tom ka soup - thicker than most, and very satisfying. Drunken noodles for the main course, which were typical but not exceptional. A second visit included fish cake appetizers that were nicely crisp on the outside but tender and very flavorful.  *However*, like so many places in Vegas, the service is somehow both friendly and incompetent. Many of the staff speak English so poorly that you cannot be assured you will get what you want. On my first visit, I ordered spice level '3' and instead got a '5', which significantly changes the experience. My dining companion also ordered '3' and got about a '2'. The actual spice level is irrelevant - the point is we ordered the same thing and got wildly different results.  On the second visit, our dinners simply did not materialize at all. We watched for 45 minutes while diners arrived, were seated, and began to eat. No food. We spoke to our waiter, then another (since ours was not very fluent with English), and got several reassurances. We had indicated that we needed to depart at a certain time, and were again reassured. But that time arrived and still our dinner was \"a few minutes\" away. In the end, we had to leave without eating it at all! We got one curt \"sorry\" and that was it.  I don't know (or care) whether that was a communication problem, a kitchen problem, or a management problem. Likely several at once. But the result was a *serious* problem for any restaurant. Beware.",

Not being in the mood for a burger or whatever fried crap available, we thought Thai food sounded good.  SEA:The Thai Experience is located back in the boonies of Bally's Hotel & Casino.  The cuisines served are both Thai & Vietnamese.  The ambiance was rather nice, with the center of the restaurant having a fountain pool with a Buddha statue, surrounded by wood tables.  On the periphery, standard tables to dine at, with a private area for large parties.  Being Vegas, we knew we shouldn't expect prices similar to the local haunts back home.  I was almost taken aback as to how much things were, but with 30% off, it helped sweeten the sour taste of overpriced food.  Fried calamari($12)- <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sea-the-thai-experience-las-vegas#GfhhEFZn2GCeSDFfXlbYiA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/sea-...</a> Lightly breaded calamari, fried to a nice texture, accompanied with sweet chili sauce.  Nice & chewy, these were really good.  I'm a big squid fan, and I enjoyed each fried piece from the sea.    Pad Thai, with beef ($18)- <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sea-the-thai-experience-las-vegas#yUTLbpFitScqvHh75IGvBQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/sea-...</a> Sweet, sour & filling, the pad thai had fair portions & was as good as any that I've had dining at my favorites.    Honey walnut shrimp fried rice ($18)- <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sea-the-thai-experience-las-vegas#dUTI_D4Rxdqi6-iHIxXNUA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/sea-...</a> Winna, winna!  The highlight of our meal, the honey walnut shrimp fried rice  made me want to pop a wheelie in a Tuk-Tuk down Las Vegas Blvd.  Crunchy walnuts & bell peppers, a pleasing amount of deveined shrimp with a medley of vegetables  wok-tossed with seasoned rice.  The portions were great, and I relished this dish, since we only had appetizers for dinner the night before.    Service was on the slow side.  The place wasn't too busy when we arrived, so I didn't understand why our food took longer than necessary.  Our drinks were kept filled & we had a nice meal, enjoying Thai music & the sound of falling water from the Buddha fountain.    In summation, we had a nice Thai lunch at SEA:The Thai Experience.  Would I dine here w/o the Tix4Tonight deal?  Heck no!  Way too expensive for stuff that's 3 times more costly than restaurants I usually go to.  However, the food was good & we were happy.  Furthermore, the ambiance was a nice respite from the frenzy of the Strip.  Recommend with the 30% off Tix4Tonight deal",

    "text": "\"I will take the short ribs home and can cook them!\".  This is what my girlfriend said to me after one bite.  I purchased a rather expensive Groupon (50 for 78).  Complete waste of money.  The place itself is nice.  What you would expect from a casino restaurant that considers itself on the mid to higher end.  The service, although a little aggressive, is decent.    The beer - I thought they would have at least one Thai beer, but we are told they share the beer menu with BLT...ok not the end of the world.  The food is awful, when considering how much this meal cost me.  If we had paid 20 for both of us we would have given 3 stars.  Our Groupon gives us 2 appetizers (up to 14 each) and 2 dinners (up to 25 each).  One of the appetizers that appealed to us didn't qualify for the amount given, but we can pay extra and did. It isn't much money but the nickel and dime train is coming.  We ordered steamed dumplings and Honey Walnut Shrimp.  The dumplings came out luke warm and very dense, not pleasant.  We actually keep pushing the plate toward each other saying \"you eat it\". We ate them but only because we paid for them.  The Shrimp dish, recommended by the server, is decent and maybe the star of our meal. They came hot, didn't have a ton of favor, but a nice spice.  Our dinners (UGH) - Short ribs and at the server recommendation Panang Duck (4 dollars above my 25 threshold). \"Rice doesn't come with your meal.  Would you like some?\"....Tooot Tooot! Sure, we will pay extra for rice.  The meals come out and as my girlfriend takes the first bite she says \"They aren't cooked.  I will take the short ribs home and can cook them!\".  The girl is Filipino and her family lives for short ribs.  I take a bite of my duck - white un-rendered fat with rubbery skin.  I stopped after taking a second bite of the dish.  What appear to be frozen vegetables used in the dish aren't real tasty. No carry out box needed.  I would have thought the server might ask about why I didn't want to take it home or why we were finished 5 minutes after it came out but as goes life.  So -  The Groupon was 50, we did have 1 beer and 1 Coke, plus upsells brought me to another 30 dollars plus tip on the 80, bringing our meal to almost 100.  We ended up going to Earl of sandwich at Planet Hollywood after to eat.  Don't waste your money here. Much better can be had for far less money.",

We also got the pineapple fried rice, pad Thai, chicken satay and honey walnut shrimp. Nothing really stood out except the Malay curry and the prices are expensive even for Vegas prices.  One thing I thought was horrible was we had one baby 8 months old a 3 year old and 3 adults. They automatically put on 20% gratuity due to party of 5. It's listed on the menu but a baby really?  I now realize why the service was none existent as they already got the tip.",

My buddy and I wasn't really hungry so we shared some dumplings to start and the Siamese Fried Rice.    Truthfully, in my point of view the dumplings were like Siu Mai from dim sum.  It had a good pork flavor, but the soy sauce it was sitting on was over salty.  I would start by changing the dumplings since it really wasn't in my viewpoint.  As for the sauce place it on the side and some spice needed.  The Fried Rice was nothing spectacular.  Rice that's fried with dried chicken.  I'm surprised they didn't ask me for the spice level!?  Needless to say, I was highly disappointed.    I would say service was good and so was the ambiance.  However, I'll walk to a new Thai joint next time around. - Enjoy!",

On this visit, I had the spicy papaya salad, the honey walnut shrimp appetizer and Thai teaAll were delicious and I highly recommend! The ambiance is is dark and the music is chill/down tempo. I arrived as soon as it opened at 11:30 so it wasn't very busy which made service quick. I highly recommend this restaurant if you're on the strip and cannot make it to China Town.

The decor is pleasant but the food completely overpriced did not match the ambiance. $22 for pad thai noodles and $22 for red curry. Initially we ordered drunken noodles. Seriously the cook must've been totally drunk when he made it. lt was super salty!! Same goes for the curry. We had to return the drunken noodles because it was too salty. Ordered pad thai and again SALTY!!!  We had a show to catch so we decided to just eat it. It was truly painful experience. The quality of the food also was not fresh. It tasted like they were food from the day before and were just reheated. We clearly felt we were treated like 2nd class because we walked in with a voucher. The total came out $50.86 not exactly sure.  When we got the check, they did not even apply the $50 voucher. A different waiter comes back with the same check. I was like ummm.. please apply the $50 voucher and adjust the receipt.   And the waitress who waited on us conveniently was out of sight. Did they seriously think we'd forget about the voucher?  Our water was not refilled. No one came back to check if the food was alright. When we asked for a refill on the water... the waiter took my husband's glass to the kitchen. I've never ever seen this before. Hubby didmt feel comfortable drinking that water. You don't deserve a tip from us.  Total of waste of a good voucher. Please don't eat here! It's bad food & bad service.",

We were sat promptly which we appreciated because a lot of places on the strip still have a wait even with reservations.  Staff was very friendly and efficient even with the restaurant being full.  We had several different dishes, the Calamari was very good and tender.  Honey Walnut Shrimp was delicious and very fresh tasting not like it was pulled from a freezer.  My only complaint was the Ribeye salad, although the steak itself was flavorful and tender, the dressing was a bit over powered with fish sauce.  It is a bit in the expensive side but the portions are reflective of the pricing.  Had a great experience......we will be back! Keep Yelpin Y'all!",

You're in a casino off the strip.  I determine if I like a Thai restaurant by ordering the Chicken Basil, so of course I ordered it.  However, I saw that duck was an option, so I opted with that instead. I was pleased with the results and concluded that I could eat here again.  With so many places in Vegas and this place was in Bally's, I doubt if I return.  If you are in the mood for Thai and in the area, then by all means, come give this place a try.",

    "text": "The food at SEA is definitely good.  I don't know if it really is worth the price you pay for it though.  I never thought I'd pay $16 for Pad See Eiw ever.  Most Thai places only charge about $8, and in Thailand $1.50.  Seems like an overpriced Thai restaurant to me, kind of like P.F. Chang's is to Chinese restaurants.  In any case, the food here is delicious, price may not be a deterrent if lady luck is rolling with you in Las Vegas.  The decor of this place is surprisingly trendy, especially since it's located inside an older Bally's casino.  There are nice tables beside a pool of water that centerpieces a nice Buddha statue.  Pretty cool for a Buddhist, like myself, to see such a remembrance of belief.  The restaurant looks very much like a few Sukhumvit restaurants and lounges I've gone to in Bangkok.  The bubble seats, in particular, that hang from a ceiling mount at the entrance reminded me of the trendy & cool Bangkok nightlife.  Personally, I just like sitting on them.  My family and I ordered:  Pad See Eiw w/ Chicken - $16 Chicken Wing Lollipops - $9 Green Curry w/ Chicken - $17 Queen of Thai Basil w/ Beef - $16 Tamarind Whole Fish (tilapia) - $32  Everything tasted great.  Even, what I thought, was an overpriced Pad See Eiw had my mouth drooling for more.  The tamarind-chili sauce from the tilapia was exceptionally tasty.  I poured a lot of that saucy goodness all over my white rice.  Combining the sauce to an already aromatic jasmine rice made it even better.  A note of warning though, SEA charges 20% gratuity for parties of 5 or more.  I didn't really like that since I thought the service was mediocre at best.  Fifteen percent would have sufficed since our waters were not refilled even once.  And, I'll be damned if I order another $5 Thai Ice Tea.  Anyways, I'll come here again if the dice are rolling my way or if I want to bring a date to a nice looking restaurant, otherwise I prefer to go to a more reasonably priced Thai restaurant on Spring Mountain Road that's just as good.",

Manhattan's are dry and sad. But when it comes to Vegas, there are no Po-Pia Sods on which to base my entire review on! Instead I had to order the boringly named Crispy Spring Rolls with lime and mustard vinaigrette.   The rolls: Good! Not special, but good!  The dipping sauce: OMG AMAZING! Super tart and sweet, littered with aromatic mustard seeds! Did I slurp it directly from the shallow bowl after I finished my rolls?! Only I (and my dining companion... and waiter) know for sure.  The restaurant looks like a tiny knock off of the Brooklyn location. Which is appropriate since my opinion of the Vegas branch is akin to the beloved North 6th outpost! But, unlike the bougie Brooklyn location, this place is never crowded... at least not yet!",

We also ordered a separate crab dish aside from the certificate and discussed what the dish included. Dishes arrived at the table and none tasted good. We didn't complain although we should have. Then arrived the much awaited crab dish. No crab? I'm sorry where is the crab? \"Oh the kitchen forgot. Let me take your plate.\" Return with 2 crab claw halves. \"I gave you more shrimp.\" I'm sorry but the shrimp wasn't what was missing and the dish was $38. It also didn't taste good. To make things even worse, we were given our bill that was $18 over what it should have been. Luckily we looked at the bill before paying. There was a charge on the bill that said open table. We questioned a waiter who walked by about what this meant. He said he didn't know but would get our waitress. She came over and became argumentative. \"Your certificate didn't include everything. You still owe $3 on this dish and $10 on another...\" I'm sorry but that's not what the Travelzoo said. She then walks away with the bill and comes back and all of a sudden the open table charge had disappeared and we were charged appropriately.  She says, \"It was the manager's fault. He thought you had another certificate.\" First of all, we never saw a manager and you scanned our phone so knew exactly what our offer was. She never apologized and I do believe that she was trying to pocket the extra cash. We will never go back there. The food was subpar and the service was slimy!",

Our meal was excellent, the service was good and the ambiance was excellent. We were lucky enough to be seated near the back and you could almost forget that you were in a casino.  Our appetizers - coconut crusted shrimp and crab rangoon - were delicious. Similarly, our entrees (macademia crusted salmon, which I highly recommend, and a daily special calamari pad thai) were very flavorful and the portions were huge. My only disappointment was the dessert, a coconut ice cream sandwich that I found to be a little lacking.  This place had probably the best Thai food I've eaten in Las Vegas. I'll be back.",

We came in and were at the front for about 10 seconds before a server came up and let us know that someone would be right there to help us.  Since we were celebrating, we ordered a bottle of chardonnay to go with our meal. Our server came back to tell us that they were out of bottle we ordered, but would give us the next best wine at the same price of the bottle we ordered. I thought that was really nice of her.  Now for the food: Crab miso soup was awesome but came out warm not hot. Still great though. Chicken and shrimp dumplings were amazing. Best food item we ordered. Once again... Dumplings are a must have. For dinner, my wife and I split 2 entrees: the spicy soba noodle and shrimp fried rice. As a precautionary, we went with a level 2 spice. Holy God it was spicy. Just be careful when choosing your spice levels here. For me, I loved it. The wife, not so much. But it was still so good it forced her to power through. The white wine was a nice balance for the spicy dishes.",

The 4 of us came here to try it and we ordered the following:  1) Tom Ka Kai (Coconut Chicken Soup) <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jVD09YgKsDtKD5sOYes6wg?select=lmAHepVByukDMOrWinBaoA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/jVD0...</a>.  This was quite good with lots of white chicken meat, mushroom, and baby corn.  2) Pad See Ew <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jVD09YgKsDtKD5sOYes6wg?select=w_wIIAPX2YUkzawuA9tY1A\">yelp.com/biz_photos/jVD0...</a> - I personally didn't try it but my guest liked it.  It looked good, so I'd take his word for it.    3) Pad Kee Mao with Tofu <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jVD09YgKsDtKD5sOYes6wg?select=nUvoYj1Zn7M5W8rYXz1viQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/jVD0...</a>.  This dish is also known as Drunken Noodle.  It was quite spicy with good flavor.  However, I didn't care for the tofu that was used.  Instead of fried tofu which has softer texture, it was the firm tofu (aka bean curb) which didn't take up seasoning well, therefore, tasted really blend.    4) Pad Thai <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jVD09YgKsDtKD5sOYes6wg?select=2GRb1HNlVo0kdAxruvpU6A\">yelp.com/biz_photos/jVD0...</a>.  A huge disappointment.  Although it looked promising, the sauce was totally off.  It had a funny sour taste to it.  My guess was that the vinegar used was too much.  My fiance who is usually is a big fan could barely eat it.  He ended up ordering Chicken Fried Rice below.  5) Chicken Fried Rice <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jVD09YgKsDtKD5sOYes6wg?select=u7O2fDzz4VxtsVhikDg-uQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/jVD0...</a>.  You wouldn't think an Asian restaurant could mess up fried rice, would you?  Ha.  Second disappointment.  It was bland and tasteless, according to my fiance.  I don't think I'd be able to convince him to come back here after having 2 bad dishes.    The restaurant is kind of hidden in the back.  The decor is quite nice and staff is very friendly.  I think you can get better Thai food outside of the casino, but if you are too lazy to go out, this is not a bad alternative.  Just don't get the Pad Thai.  =)",

Being half Korean I've never heard of being charged rice at any spot in my entire life! The appetizers were dry with no flavor. Not impressed. Would never eat there again. One star.",

We were so delighted that we did. It was definitely one of the top 3 meals we had there in the 4 days we were there. We ordered their coconut spring rolls, garlic mixed vegetables with tofu and spicy thai herb fried rice. We also got the mango sticky rice for dessert. All dishes were delicious. The ambience was perfect for a sit down meal and a break from the sounds of the casinos and the strip. Would totally recommend it if you are craving thai/Asian and want veggie choices. The prices were comparable to other restaurants in casino resorts and on the strip.",

Soup with coconut milk base was very flavorful and loaded with chicken. The salad had crunchy wonton strips and a light tasty dressing. I ordered the cashew stir fry with shrimp. Great variety of fresh veggies, about 8 good sized shrimp and loved the brown gravy. My husband ordered Massaman Curry with beef, he really enjoyed it. Loaded with beef strips and sweet potato that he thought was cooked perfectly. The service was top notch as well, our iced tea glasses were never empty. Would definitely recommend, but could be pricey without the Groupon.",

I had to ask for soy sauce and after about 10 minutes of it being on our table, 2 different waitresses came to ask if we were finished with it.  It was as if they only had 2 condiment trays for the restaurant, which was very strange.  Mediocre food, oddly cold service, and way over priced.

From the outside, the ambience looks really dark but there is a pond in the middle of the restaurant that makes the decor looks inviting. Price is a bit on the expensive side: $14 for appetizer and $23 for an entree. We ordered the crab rangoon, crispy calamari and a pad thai. But when it came out, portion were a bit small and flavour was just \"meh\". Being a more upscale restaurant that charges a premium for pricing, I expected a lot more. The crab rangoon only came with 6 deep fried wontons that were placed on top of sliced cucumbers among a sea of sweet/sour sauce. The calamari was heavily battered and a bit overcooked. The pad thai also lack flavor and had tons of scallions in it. Overall, it was up to par to what they are charging. You may be able to fool someone who is not familiar with thai cuisine but for the seasoned diner, the SEA Thai Experience fell way below expectation.",

Definitely a great place to slow down for a bit, have some actual conversation during a meal without the music and crowds drowning you out. Love the water feature as well...priced reasonably for large portions.",

Overpriced, I know Vegas is expensive but this doesn't even taste good so yes, overpriced af.  Maybe I came here on a bad night, but I don't think I'll return next time I go to Vegas.

This restaurant will charge you for booking a reservation through any reservation system, Especially not Open Table unless you are ok with being charged after your meal (they don't tell you upfront). It is listed on your dinner receipt, very shady and deceptive.  While the charge is only $1.00 it is really the of it.   I would no recommend purchasing their Groupon they treat you as if will be \"cheap\" even though you really end spending almost the same about if you did. Or purchase it. In total with our Groupon purchase we saved $8.00  Not let's talk about the food, portions are the smaller side for a Thai restaurant but was perfectly fine for us. Appetizers: Tom Yum soup was good, Steamed Dumpling App was good.  Entrees:  Green Stir Fry lacked all flavor, Drunken Noodles were decent but nothing to write home about. Drinks:$4.00 for a hot tea WOW.. at least it should have been a good loose tea blend then not a tea bag!!! Talk about raping your customers!  I won't begin to tell you what the food did to my wife and I...  The servers were nice, service was quick. The place is cute, we were seated next to a room they put a large party into, our server left to take care of that party and we ended up with a new server. She was nice although did not speak English as well. Personally I think I can think of better Thai restaurants to go to.  May your experience be better than ours.",

The service here was horrible. It is categorized as a find dining restaurant, but everyone is unfriendly. Many of the larger dishes should have a serving spoon to share, but they did not provide it. When I asked for a serving spoon, they gave me attitude and returned with a small spoon making it difficult to scoop the food.

Not good or bad.   26$ Crab Fried Rice: This was really good. I love crab fried rice and this would be the reason why I would come back, along with the honey walnut shrimp.",

I would never pay for this in the city, but when you're in Vegas you tend to shell out $$$ for food that is just okay.  My brother ordered the curry (which was already $21) and then we had to pay $3 for the rice. The Asian in me was like \"man this ain't right\" but I did it anyway cause rice is life. I got the pad kee mao, it was decent, nothing to write home about. Cute decor, I was with my family so didn't get to sit next to the fountains, but I think that would have been nice.",

The waiters didn't ask how the meal was and did not ask if we wanted to take home the leftovers (I was barely able to muster the courage to eat half). The only truly good thing about this restaurant is the decor. I am leaving a restaurant unsatisfied for only the second time at any restaurant in my life..",

They really have the flavors of authentic Thai cuisine down in a way that most American Thai places don't.  The waitstaff were great.

Service was friendly and very efficient (we immediately had our drinks refilled without having to ask), and our food arrived quickly.   I personally really enjoyed the food. The highest praise I can give it is that it's better than your average NYC Thai food. The flavors were perfect and I love how specifically you can control the level of spiciness. I recommend medium, which was ideal for us since we enjoy spicy food but not when it's overwhelmingly hot. The red curry was outstanding, but I also kept dipping rice into my boyfriend's prik king, which was equally delicious.   My main gripe is with the cost. Firstly, the menu link hasn't been updated with the new prices. You should expect to pay somewhere between $22-$25 dollars for a typical curry, rice, or noodle dish. Sadly, this doesn't even include rice which is $3 extra for a small plate. The quality is obviously better than a cheaper Thai restaurant but it's hard to stomach how overpriced this is for noodles and rice. NYC Thai runs you $10 a dish on average! The portions of the entrees were decent and we left very full, so at least there's that. I would recommend this place if you're not concerned about sticker shock.",

The food was meager at best, and I would almost classify it as a rip-off. I ordered a caesar salad for an appetizer and it was lettuce, fried wontons and carrots. Nothing else.  10$ - and probably had $1.50 in ingredients. I ordered duck confit for my entree and I was not asked how I wanted it prepared and it came out well done, if not a little more so. Avoid at all cost.",

They seemed to had just had a rush, I don't know, but good turned to not good. The waiter went on break and I almost thought they went to find a live chicken for our plate. It took that long. They then came and I had to remind them of our order. By the time the dishes got to our table, they were cold. We didn't even eat them. I felt bamboozled and I really would have liked a refund.

So we found the SEA Thai Restaurant just across from rj hotel elevators. I never heard of this restaurant in Bally's so I'm assuming it just recently opened. The wait was around 15-25 minutes and the inside looked full, so it must be that good. The decor was modern and also had a small fountain inside the restaurant.   I love love Thai food with their different uses of curry on their entrees and chicken barbecue. Lighting was pretty dim and I see they were going for an intimate setting. Flat screens were around the dining area and was Putin the Vevo channel with no sound. The food had taken about 30 - 45 minutes because it was so busy. Speaking of food, the chicken barbecue, curry beef, spicy rice and pad Thai were all a hit. It reminded me of the small Thai restaurant not too far from our place that serves good food. Our waitress forgot to fill up our waters and we were so thirsty after eating he spicy curry beef.   The prices were typical for a Vegas strip hotel at $$$. I wouldn't call this place fancy and I have eaten at fancy eateries in Vegas. I would rate SEA Thai in the middle. I prefer to go to China town for some cheap eats compared to eating in the strip.",

Ultimately regretted that decision and wondered why I didn't listen to the Yelp reviews, which are pretty much spot on in this case.   Overpriced menu offering mediocre Thai food in a glorified warehouse (maybe I'm exaggerating but that was the feeling I got). Ordered pad thai with prawns, green curry with duck, and something else so tasteless I have unremembered it altogether.   The service was very friendly, which counts for a lot, but probably wouldn't be enough to make me eat here again. Skip SEA and go to any off-strip Thai restaurant for the real deal. I've been to a few and they never disappoint!",

Each dish is absolutely delicious. The jasmine rice is the perfect amount of sticky and is always served in generous portions.  It is certainly not cheap, but it is essentially a fine dining Thai restaurant in Las Vegas, so that is to be expected. It's absolutely gorgeous inside and the hostess is the nicest person working in a Las Vegas restaurant.  Ask for Grace, you won't be disappointed.",

This made the prices OK, but the original prices are definitely on the high end. The decor was nice with a pool inside, and the place was rather small and intimate.   We all enjoyed our appetizers and meals, but not the best Thai I've ever had. Crab rangoon was on the sweet side, dumplings were good, four season rolls were nice and fresh. The spice level varies depending on what you get. The pad Thai level 4 was pretty mild, while the spicy green curry level 4 was definitely on the way to a legit Thai hot level 5. The portion sizes are very generous and we all ended up taking leftovers home. I would recommend this place with the Groupon, but not without.",

    "text": "Super cute place, great service but outrageously overpriced. Purchased a Groupon for $100 worth of food for 4. I understand prices are jacked up in Vegas (I paid $12 for a slice of pizza and a bottle of water...) but really $28 for shrimp drunken noodles?    We got in for a 6pm reservation and requested to sit by the water feature - the place is nicely decorated and has a very serene cool vibe. We started off with the pork taro eggrolls, papaya salad and chicken tom yum soup. Eggrolls were ok, papaya salad was fresh and crisp just enough heat and the soup was good. For dinner we ordered the shrimp drunken noodles, chicken pineapple fried rice and beef garlic veggie stir fry. All in all, food is ok but portions are small for the price you pay. I've paid $8 for pineapple fried rice at 1 1/2 times the portion I got here. Before Groupon, our entire meal cost $133 - just a tad it high for what you get.  If not for the Groupon, I'm not sure if I would come back. Flavors of food were just ok but nothing to rave about. Don't get me wrong, I didn't leave hungry but for what's charged, I'm expecting phenomenal. I do have to say what they lack in food to price ratio, they sure make up in service! Service was excellent : friendly, fast and efficient.",

Much better price/healthy options @the SEA than anything on the strip.   Brown rice + steamed veggies at $15.00 with much larger portion sizes than what you can get at Pan Express in the Bally's food court. I cheated and got an order of the coconut spring rolls and used the delicious lime dipping sauce for my steamed veggies.   Need a detox after 3 days of Rao's/Joe's/Morimoto's. Steamed veggies have no oil and no salt. Can add salt via the provided hot sauce. Reasonable price at $10. Couldn't finish the portion size.   They have Vietnamese menu in addition to a Thai menu. The vietnamese noodle soups aren't as salty as the Chinese Beef Noodle soups.   Thank You SEA for listening to customers and being reasonably priced so as to not being insulting. And thank you for not trying to trick me to maximize profit!!!!!!!",

Hidden away off a corner of a busy, loud casino, this tranquil, calm, quiet oasis makes you feel as though you've stepped into another world. The still pond is lovely. The tables are comfortable. The entire place is lovely.   The service here is fantastic and attentive. We were seated immediately. Menu questions were answered thoughtfully. We were checked on regularly but unobtrusively. Everyone quietly ensured we had a wonderful experience.   The food?  Oh. My. God.   I didn't know that the curry we ordered was on CNNs top ten restaurant dishes anywhere til later, but yes, yes it deserved that distinction. Our table ordered a few dishes to share and everything we tried was simply phenomenal.   I cannot recommend this restaurant highly enough. A perfect experience start to finish.",

It was dried out on the outside and really chewy.  I eat tofu often and have never had it come out like that.  My husband got the black noodle dish.  I tried some and didn't care for it at all.  We got coconut egg rolls and crab Rangoon for appetizers.  Those were good.  I'm glad we had a Groupon because the prices are very high which is to be expected in Vegas, but the food was just not up to par for me.",

There were only 4 of us and a baby that didn't eat anything!   I've never heard of an added 'party gratuity' for only 4 people, usually its for larger parties of 8 or more in a group.

We are vegetarians and this place is one of the best Thai foods we have ever had.  1. They are open to customizing food for vegetarians(veggie broth, no fish oil etc.), which only very few places are able to do 2. The entree quantity and quality are on point 3. The service is amazing- all the servers are polite and quick 4. The ambience is great- simple and clean  Cons: The only down point is that if not for the groupon, the place might be a bit too overpriced.  Their website reports half the prices that are actually mentioned on the menu- seems to be some confusion there.  But will definitely come back if we get another deal/groupon ;)",

The computers are smarter than you.... I feel completely cheated and robbed of good service, good food, and value for the money paid. $200 later and we will never return. Please beware.

    "text": "Well, yelp nailed this one: \"meh\" is right. After one too many dinners at a bar, I was craving some Thai, and SEA was close by and reasonably priced. The decor was beautiful, the ambiance was nice, and the glass of Riesling I had was perfect. It went downhill from there. (Speaking of the wine... There is no bar at SEA. So, if you order a drink, be prepared to wait until they fetch it from the abyss.)  We started with a shared appetizer of spring rolls, which tasted like... nothing. I mean, I guess it could have been worse and they tasted bad, right?  Next, our waiter. I got the distinct impression he was making fun of us, like we've ever eaten Thai before. Not cool, dude, not cool. My friend ordered a dish, but asked that, on a scale of 1 to 5 (with 5 being ridic hot), her meal was between a 2 and a 3. I asked for green curry, with a \"4.\" Apparently, this was hilarious.   The meals finally come out, and.... my friend's dish has NO heat, and if my green curry was a \"4\" on the heat level, then that's just sad, y'all. I can't remember the last time there were peas and portobello mushrooms in a curry, but it didn't taste bad... Just sad.   Other than being affordable and pretty, I'd stay away if you're a real fan of Thai.",

The extra spicy is right on point.  Next time I will not need to order thai spicy as extra spicy for them is hot but you still get all the flavor without the burn.  Well without too much burn.  Will visit again for sure.",

I ordered the shrimp tom yum for $16 which is the best \"deal\" in the menu and it's alright, competently done but nothing close to pay an extra $5 or more for this dish.  I would only recommend this place if you got comps to use and don't have a car to drive out.",

The music surprisingly had no Pacific Islander reference, but it wasn't over powering.    Our server Mutty engaged in fun conversation and gave us genuine recommendations. I decided to choose a cocktail out of my norm \"Bee Gee's\", and the honey taste was too strong for me and had to trade that in for the BLT cocktail which didn't disappoint at all!   On to the grub!  Crispy ginger calamari- lightly battered, served with a sweet cocktail sauce. Sauce threw me off, just a little too sweet like me  Crab Rangoon- served on a slice of cucumber. Cream cheese galore  Fritters- had and still have no idea what this is, lol, but it's served on skewers with sweet Thai chili sauce   Spicy basil shrimp fried rice- I licked the bowl clean, enough said  Malaysia curry- this won a reward from Food by CNN! So we had to try it! I also finished this clean! Doesn't come with rice, maybe it's served a la cart.   The serving sizes are small for the price, but tasty to say the least. I'd like to try a few more things on the menu next time. I'll make sure I have a Groupon for that too!",

Not to worry it was AMAZING.   We started with fritters!  Best ever.  Nice crispy dumplings on a slew with some sweet Thai sauce. For dinner we had pad Thai and Panang Curry.  Both great.

    "text": "During a recent trip to Las Vegas, my friends and I purchased a Groupon deal for SEA and I must say that discounts like that are the way to go when dining on the strip due to the horrific prices. I really do like Thai food quite a bit, but at the time I wasn't sure that would be my first choice for a Vegas weekend as there are so many great cuisines in the city, but SEA far exceeded my expectations. One of the girls and I decided to split a Pad See Ew plate because we never finish a full order anywhere else and knew that we would not be eating leftovers that weekend. We ultimately decided on beef at the suggestion of our waitress and she did not steer us wrong. The beef was so tender that it all but melted in my mouth and the noodles had just the right amount of soy sauce flavor. The bok choy were wonderfully cooked as well, though I do prefer it when there are other veggies as well. I will say that this was the smallest portion of Pad See Ew I've ever received (and the most pricey), so that part was a little disappointing since I was sharing with someone.   The service was wonderful, but did slow down a bit towards the end of our meal. One of my friends ordered a Thai Iced Tea not realizing that it is made with cream. She is lactose intolerant and our waitress had no issue substituting the already prepared Thai Iced Tea for a regular Iced Tea and that was much appreciated.   The ambiance was very cozy with a little darker lighting, which would make for a wonderful date night dinner on the strip. It did get crowded toward the end of our meal, but our 7:30PM reservation came with a more calm atmosphere.   Overall, I'd highly recommend SEA, but try to get the Groupon deal!",

It seemed appropriate to order the Drunken Man's Noodle (Pad See Maow) with vegetables and it was absolutely heavenly. Everyone at the table tried some and really loved it. The basil in the sauce is just perfectly balanced.  Ambiance was dark and upscale. This would make a perfect couples/date spot. Service was great - a little slow once we got to the end of our meal, but overall very good. I hope to one day find a Drunken Man's Noodle that compares to this one.",

If this were anywhere else I'm sure I'd have different thoughts, but in the city that never sleeps, this seemed as ordinary as any \"Best Thai\" in the suburbs.  Alright, the prices are still very Vegas.  My almost $20 pad see ew tasted like many others I have had except it was covered in baby bok choy and adorned with a lemon wedge.  The level 4 spice was more of a three and I was in insane eating beast mode to even really care.  I probably would have never seen this place because it is in the back corner of the casino.  If it were instead some kind of Thai Las Vegas buffet, then it would definitely be worth the trip inside Bally's.  Since it's as ordinary as takeout, I suggest you spend your penny slot winnings at a place you can really gorge at.  It was good, but not Vegas good.",

Perfect ! partied so much & ate so much fried food it was nice to have a plate full of veggies and shrimp!  I'll definitely go back. Thanks Vegas for a great Thai fix! One of my fave food genres !",

    "text": "Just okay.  Very okay.  The thing that makes me question this place is the fact that their pad thai was marginal.  What kind of thai restaurant messes up a signature dish like that?!  Aside from the pad thai, the best thing I ate was the Malay curry.  It was not too spicy, and full of flavor.  Of course, I would be happy with pretty much any curry - but after trying their lack-luster pad thai, this was great in comparison.  We ordered it with tofu, which was a great decision in my opinion.  Tofu and curry are a perfect combo!  Make sure to order a side of rice with this though - it doesn't come with like you may expect.  The calamari was okay - nothing to brag about.  Same goes for the chicken lettuce wraps - they were not that great.  Really not that great.  I usually would eat 2 of these, but I had to force myself to finish one.  Don't order them, especially if you've ever tried PF Changs (which are 10x better, sadly).  The service was good, and the ambiance was the main redeeming quality.  It's a romantic setting, with modern, clean decor.  We were a very large party (around 15) and had our own private room with a TV.  Waiters and waitresses were quick to bring our food and clear the table.  I would definitely not come back here if I were in Vegas, there are so many other better restaurants to check out.",

    "text": "Just want to start off by saying that my dad is Vietnamese and a chef so I grew up in kitchens and the love and appreciation of food was instilled in me at a very young age.   I ordered the chicken malay massaman curry and it was PERFECT, that alone deserves 5 stars. It was so good I asked the waiter to give my compliments to chef, so if your looking for curry this place will not disappoint. Me and my girlfriend shared an order of 4 egg rolls and they were tasty, they however come with a small amount of sauce for dipping. My girl ordered the chicken classic teriyaki which she really liked, I tried it and it tasted ok. Just as a heads up none of the dishes come with sides so we both had to add sides of white steamed rice. For some reason the prices from their online menu don't seem to match the actual prices from what I can remember seeing in the restaurant.   The vibe of the restaurant was really nice, it was tucked away in a corner of the Paris Las Vegas Casino so it was away from most of the crowd. There's also some seating in the middle that surrounds a water pond with water lilies and a beautiful statue of Buddha. We were sat away from this and when asked if we could sit by the water they moved us with no hesitation.",

    "text": "A great dining experience!  A girlfriend and I dined here after finding a Groupon for the restaurant that included two appetizers and two entrees for a reasonable price.  The atmosphere of the restaurant is very zen; it is not a huge space, so I would definitely recommend making a reservation.  We had made a reservation using Open Table, and once we arrived we were seated very quickly.    Service was great.  I seem to always base service on how quickly my water glass is refilled throughout the meal--because I drink a lot of water!--and my glass definitely stayed filled.  Our waitress was very nice and friendly, as well as the other staff was very helpful as well.    We both ordered the pad Thai for our main entree and the chicken lettuce wraps and coconut spring rolls for appetizers.  Everything was delicious!  The portions were very reasonable (if not too much), and the tastes of everything was great.  I would definitely recommend everything we ordered to anyone!    Price for the restaurant seemed kind of steep, but for a nice restaurant in Vegas and the amount of food given, it's actually pretty reasonable.  Make sure to look on Groupon to see if they still have a special.  Next time I am in town I will definitely be going back to SEA, whether there is a Groupon or not!",

When you walk in most of the tables are around this fountain/small pond in the center of the restaurant that gives a laid back vibe.   The food is excellent, with the spring rolls having more flavor than most with some lemongrass and weren't greasy at all. The Panang curry with beef was likewise top notch with lots of meat and string beans in a sauce that has some spice but isn't burning a hole in your tongue.  The service is very friendly and fast here and it wasn't too packed on a weekday night but I made online reservations since I wasn't sure.",

    "text": "It's located in Bally's.  We ordered take out Sunday afternoon Sept. 7.   Crab rice- was 3.5/5  okay to good.  Tom yum soup-  solid flavor. Seafood noodle soup- spicy. Not very much noodles provided.  Mango sticky rice- good.  Total $73  You can only get away with this kind of overpricing in Vegas.  Many Thai restaurants elsewhere would have much lower prices for exact same items. The restaurant was empty when we pickup the food.   Negative- for take out, they put the soups in plastic cylinder containers. It's fine for the tom yum soup but for the noodle soup, it doesn't work very well. They provide the noodles in a separate SQUARE  styrofoam container.   You can't throw in the noodles with the soup container because it would be really awkward to eat the noodle soup out of. I had to pour the soup into the square container for the noodles which was a bad noodle eating experience. For a place that charges $20 for noodle soup, you would think they understand from a consumer perspective of the logistics of eating the noodle soup. They don't.  Most places have bowl containers so you can put the noodles into the soup and have a proper noodle eating experience. Such containers can be bought bulk with a price of .20 cents a bowl. Maybe they have little experience with take out food and the eating experience with it.   Asian noodle soups tend to be around $8-12, for vegas pricing I'd accept $10-15. NOT $18-20.  Crab rice was $26--crab is not that luxury of an item in vegas so very over priced. Should be about $18.   Overall, really over price for what you are eating. Food is ok. You can get a much better food experience for the same price points at other places. I'll predict they wont survive here. The price point is not in sync with Bally's price point demographic and it would be silly for people from other casinos to come eat there.   Will not eat there again unless it was free or they lower their prices to a normal level.",

Usually restaurants' version of spicy is pretty watered down but I left here with my lips burning 30 mins later! I love to feel the burn, ergo, I'm in love with this place. It was an orgiastic experience for my taste buds. The Thai iced tea was good as well as whatever my beau had. No time for dessert :'(   Also, there was a guy there, the owner or manager (I'm unsure), that was very attentive and polite while I waited for my beau to arrive.

    "text": "Considering this is a \"high-end\" thai restaurant, and I actually enjoyed the food, this place deserved 4 stars. Why did I take 1 star off? Because it tasted like a hole in the wall [to yelper's standards] 5 star restaurant back home at L.A.'s thai town, just fancied up a little. The food was excellent, though, but for the prices were a bit high. Why still the 4 star rating? We came here on New year's eve night. Many of the nicer restaurants had prix fixe menus from $75 up and it was hard to find a nice place without one. I for one am not a fan of prix fixe menus. So we made a reservation here for 8:00 and didn't get seated until 8:30. That was annoying because we even split up our party of 14 just so we can get seated quicker. That clearly didn't work. They have to work on that if you ask me.  The restaurant is dark, and very, very busy. They also don't have a restroom so you'd have to go to the casino floor to use one. It's nicely decorated, but I've eaten at Tao at the Venetian, which is much nicer, and similar in pricing. They also give you chopsticks... uh, they don't use chopsticks in thailand, they use a spoon and a fork. You'd think a restaurant full of Thai workers would know better.  We ordered the phad thai, pineapple fried rice, pad see ew, and bbq pork chop entree. The 4 of us split it and it was all very good. Like I said, it tasted like it does at a popular authentic thai restaurant in l.a., but for twice as much. The service was slow at times, but it was new year's eve and it was a packed house. We always had plenty of water, and the waitress was good about checking on us, but she wasn't spectacular. She did bring my sister's request of chili paste and chili powder really quickly, which was nice.  I wouldn't come back here because I'm sure there's a thai restaurant somewhere off the beaten path in vegas which can make food just as good, and for lower prices. BUT i did have a great experience and was happy with everything we ate.",

Whenever we asked for something, we had to try to say it again with our hands by pointing to things, making motions, etc. I'm not sure if we were just too much to handle, but I truly think he just didn't understand. At least understand the simple stuff, like red pepper or extra silverware.   Food: It was aiiight. Definitely not the best pho I ever had. That's okay, that really wasn't the issue. My problem was their lack of condiments. I love having everything in my pho, like all that Asian stuff! Siracha, hoisin sauce, chili pepper, etc. They just didn't really have that at our tables and when asked, our server was clueless. Unfortunately, my pho ended up pretty bland. Maybe this is because this is a Thai restaurant. But please don't charge me $12 for a freaking bowl of pho if you can't perfect it.   If I ever come back here it wouldn't be for pho. Maybe next time I want pad thai or something I'll try it out again, but that's pretty doubtful.",

Nice atmosphere and upscale unique decor. Warm entrance with candles lit against the wall and the maitre' de at the door was friendly and we were @30 min early for my reservation but he said no problem. He asked if we wanted to sit by the water so we did. Beautiful art/Buddha with lotus flowers I think floating..cool original wooden seating mainly for two ppl. But I did see a few ppl squeezed into one. He only reason I didn't give 5 stars is bc you will hurt your butt and back sitting there for too long wish they'd give you a soft pillow to sit on. Our waitress was extremely friendly and alert. Waters were always filled and service was excellent which is a huge thing to me. The food was good-It's just hard to decipher what dishes are what without photos lol. I guessed and asked her what size noodles were what but having more photos would be so helpful! I will bring more people back soon it's a nice romantic restaurant.",

Honestly, I read the reviews and people complained about prices of this restaurant.  Seriously?  You're on the strip in Las Vegas....  even Starbucks costs twice as much.    Forget about your wallet as soon as you set your eyes on the glitz and glamour of the strip.  I guarantee you'll lose more in gambling.

We got the groupon deal so thankfully we didn't have to pay those pricing. The service itself was GREAT! They made sure our waters and soda wasn't empty. My husband got beef chow funn and the appetizer beef on screwers which tasted so yummy! I got the Malay massaman roasted duck curry (meh, I'll stick to my green curry) and I asked the server \"is it spicy\" for everything that I ordered since I can't handle ANY spice. He said my curry is the least spiciest and I won't notice any heat. Well, it's my fault to think that a Thai curry could have no spice to it bc my husband who LOVES spicy food said it was too spicy for him. I also got the spring egg rolls which was super good! So, I knocked off 1 star bc the food was too spicy and another bc the pricing doesn't match the  portion size.",

    "text": "I heard of this venue from groupon, for which I purchased a 41$ voucher for two appetizers and two entrees for 2 people.   This thai restaurant was located in the Bally hotel and casino- somewhat really hard to find. We got there pretty late @ around 10 pm, but the staff was very accomodating and still took out order even though they were near closing time. Since we came in late, we ordered our entrees to go. However, the decor was breathtaking with a man made pond sitting in the middle of the restaurant with Thai statues.   Food: we started with appetizers:  Po-pia sod (2/5) fresh vegetarian roll wrapped in rice paper served in pieces and a chilli dipping sauce - I didn't find anything out of the ordinary for this dish -very typical flavours; Stuffed crab Rangoon (2/5)- crab and cream cheese filled fried Wonton- I really didn't enjoy the cream cheese, it didn't compliment well with the crab. Our main entrees: (these entrees were not served with rice which you had to order separately) Seafood combo (2/5)-shrimp, scallop, Tilapia curry- I found the scallops were not well cooked and seasoning was lacking. This was one of the more expensive items on the menu that was recommended by the waitress- I didn't enjoy it at all. Tofu Pad Thai (3/5)-came with flat noodles, raw mango strips and cooked red peppers. I liked that this dish came with noodles. Mango was a fresh touch to the dish in combination with the red peppers.  Thoughts: I thought the groupon was great for the quantity of food we got and in presentation but in terms of the food quality, I expected better. Average restaurant on the strip!",

My partner, Andre, spotted \"Malay Massama Curry\" on the menu with a description \"CNN says this dish is one of their top 10 in the world.\" We had to try it. The menu gives you the option of having it with chicken, beef, shrimp or with an extra $7, we can elect prawns or roasted duck. Go with the roasted duck.  After a sweat-inducing walk to get there, we started by getting coconut water. This arrives as a whole coconut with a large hole for a straw or spoon. I was instantly hydrated and refreshed. I drank it throughout the meal.  The Malay Massama Curry was truly exquisite. We got ours with brown rice. Based on my culinary experiences, this dish rates in my top ten. Was it a great recipe and great execution? Definitely yes!",

Having and eating Thai food here is akin to  craving Mexican food and going to Taco Bell and calling it Mexican Food!,   or to Olive Garden and calling theirs Italian, or to PF Chang's Chinese  Not only they're overpriced but the portions were \"kid value meal\"-ish.

Plus, who doesn't want to save a few bucks in Vegas whenever you can. The Groupon took about 40% off the regular price and gave us $100 to spend on four or more people. We ended up having five people and, of course given Vegas prices, had no problem reaching and exceeding that amount. In fact, my friend and I decided to share our plate of pad see ew to avoid leftovers and the five of us still hit $150 with four entrees, four drinks and a beer.  Of course, this happened to be the smallest portion of pad see ew that I've ever seen in all of my Thai eating days. Every other time I end up with enough leftover for at least one, if not two more meals, but this time I probably could have finished the whole plate. Aside from the size, the rest of the dish was perfect. Our waitress advised us to try the beef over the chicken and it was very tender and delicious. There was a perfect sauce to noodle ratio and I was very happy with the flavor. I don't care for Chinese broccoli but I liked that it was stacked on top of the dish instead of mixed in and my dining partner volunteered to eat the greens. At $22, I wouldn't say this dish is worth the price but it was tasty. My friends ordered a couple fried rices and the drunken noodles. It seemed like the fried rice dishes had the largest quantity of food.  As always, I loved my Thai iced tea, which was a bit pricier than usual at $5 but in line with Vegas prices.  The restaurant is small but has a nice vibe. It was relaxing until a very loud person was sat at the table next to us. Apparently, noise carries very well in here.   Service was good at first but then our waitress seemed to disappear after she dropped the check off. We were in a hurry so it was a bit annoying that it took her so long to return to get the payment. We had to rush back to our hotel to get ready for our evening plans.",

Lip smacking spicy food, beautiful ambience and absolutely friendly service.  Thumbs up: pretty much everything we ordered :-D Thai iced tea (believe me there are tons of places that mess up something as simple as Thai ice tea), jungle chicken, Thai Basil fried rice.  The pad thai was a little below my expectation.  I was missing a hint of flavor. To all the Thai food craving gang you got to visit this place!",

Both tasted very good and we enjoyed every single bite.  For an entree, the duck massaman curry was ordered and the special seared salmon. The duck curry was Monnnnnay. It was so good, both the Hubbs and I were impressed with the taste. The duck tasted excellent with the curry. It said it comes with potatoes, specifically they are sweet potatoes, I was trying to find potatoes, as I love them and when I was unable to find one, my husband said it's probably sweet potatoes. Nevertheless, excellent dish The seared salmon sat on top of a mixed mango salad. The presentation of the dish was very nice and the salmon, although cooked well done, was still tasty. We were both very impressed with the food.  The ambience is also great. Quiet and very relaxing, and still quite elegant. I am very surprised at the low star reviews as I thought it was very nice restaurant!  Don't be scared and try this place, a bit pricey, but worth it! If we didnt order 2 apps and 2 entrees I may have had room for dessert  Service wise- no complaints!! Friendly and wonderful servers!",

My family and I went to this place since all the other restaurants were packed and this was like the only option we could go to. My mother ordered the popular Drunk Man Noodle and my father ordered the Grill Pork Chop, and I ordered the Pad Thai. First of all, the Pad Thai tasted excellent. All I can say is excellent. The taste reminded me of the food in Thailand which gave me a bit of nostalgia. Pad Thai was cooked to perfection. My father said the pork chop was good as well. Grilled perfectly on both sides. According to me mother, she said that the Drunk Man Noodles was better than all Drunk Man Noodles she's ever tried. Better than any Thai restaurant back where she and my father lives in California. Staff was nice of course. Our waitress was Patty. So if your waitress is her, your dining is experience will be AMAZING! Check the place while you can. I bet you will enjoy and never regret going there :)",

I will say it's not necessarily pure Thai, since it has other Asian fusion influence, but not complaining because it was so yummy!!  Prices are definitely on the high side , but using Groupon made it very reasonable, especially when considering the ambience and the quality and quantity of the food we received (Huge shareable appetizers of honey Walnut shrimp and calamari, followed by very flavorful and balanced Malay curry, and perfectly cooked drunken noodles with topped with roasted duck.  Our main server was very sweet, knowledgeable , and attentive, and I loved  how the whole staff  seemed to have the teamwork thing down pat and kept us taken care of the whole time without being intrusive while we enjoyed the ambience.  Tip: they also offer discounts at the tix4tonite kiosks which I think would be worth it for a larger party if you can't access a Groupon.   The restaurant seemed to have quite a few Groupon users though  and staff happily redeemed them and treated us with stellar service the whole evening.  I would subtract one star because receipt was confusing  at the end (waitress admitted the way it is set up was indeed confusing to many patrons and sincerely apologized ), but I still found the overall total more than reasonable considering everything so I decided not to mull over it, and rated 5 stars since I don't agree with the 3.5 star average here on Yelp!  I feel the overall average needs to go up to at LEAST a solid 4 so people don't miss out and are more likely to give this amazing place a try!;)",

The portion was huge, and it was loaded with seafood - scallops, shrimp, calamari, fish cakes, and baby octopus. It also had rice noodles, bean sprouts, peanuts, and green onions. Super delish.  My friend got the northern style shrimp tom yum with a side of jasmine rice, and he loved it. I tasted the soup, and it was very lemongrass-y, just the way I like it. My sister got the duck noodle soup, and she liked it, but thought it was a little too heavy.   The service was also excellent. Our water was always refilled and our waitress brought sauces and explained each one. I would definitely come back the next time I find myself in sin city.",

    "text": "My husband and I stumbled upon this place while searching for food in frenzied Las Vegas.  We had been turned away at The Steakhouse at Bill's for a second time (that's a longer story and I refuse to think that place is in such high demand that we couldn't get a table at 7pm on a Sunday).  Anyhoo, we noted there was a steakhouse at Bally's and headed over there.  We noticed SEA right next to the steakhouse and were just drawn in.  From the moment we walked in, we were impressed by the service.  We were seated immediately and when we noted the quieter, calmer area in back, we were welcomed to sit there.  It turned out to be a perfect romantic dinner :)  In addition, it isn't crazy pretentious like many other nice restaurants in Vegas.  Great food, friendly & attentive service, and warm atmosphere.  Here are the highlights...  -- Crispy Coconut Spring Rolls:  Perfectly crunchy and delicious, accompanied by a Lime Mustard Sauce that was sweet, tangy, and gently spicy.  The sauce was so good, we dipped the carrot garnish in it and kept noshing after the spring rolls were gone! -- Thai Style Lobster Tail:  AMAZING.  The lobster tail was still in the shell, chopped into perfect chunks, then breaded and (apparently) fried.  I needed my husband's help to get the shell pieces off, but that just made the meal more fun!  The veggies were perfectly cooked and the sauce was like nothing I've had before.  Plus the amount of lobster was very generous.  Soooooo delish! -- Crabmeat Fried Rice:  Hubby ordered this and it was really tasty!  It was full of lump crab meat and veggies, all blended together in a ridiculously good blend of flavors.   -- Mad Dragon Friter:  This SEA version of fried ice cream was a perfect way to end our meal.  The crunchy coating was uniquely spiced (I have no idea what those spices were, but they were great!) and it was accompanied by delicate slices of mango.  Lovely.  Some people have said here that the service is \"slow.\"  I disagree.  The service was exceptional and the staff left us alone long enough to get lost in conversation over our drinks, appetizer, meal, & dessert.  I believe this is the mark of a great restaurant...  I want time to enjoy my meal, especially when paying more than usual.  If you are looking for atmosphere, delicious food, and a special experience; you will get exactly that at SEA.  If you don't the like the company you keep, perhaps the service would seem slow... But don't take that out on the restaurant!",

Even the foot long subway downstairs is 10bucks. So I won't complaint it's expensive. The decor is very modern and cozy. We were seated right away. Service is very sweet and professional.  Everything I mentioned by now is 4-5stars. Food came out in 35minutes.  I ordered green curry hubby ordered pork chop.  The curry is so salty I finished every piece of the rice and 3glasses of water and left most of the food.  I will try to steak house next door next time when we stay here again.",

Papaya salad wAs decent spring rolls were nothing great the curry was basically a soup that tasted nothing like curry! The noodles we told them to take away and ordered the pad Thai even that they could not make right! After a few bites and being disgusted we asked for the tab and left. So if your into real Thai food don't bother coming here because you will only be greatly disappointed",

With its rectangular pond with unique wooden tables integrated around it - overlooked by a statue of Buddha - we thought that we'd give it a try for dinner. So we requested a table by the pool for dinner.   When we arrived that evening we were happy to find that our requested table was actually waiting for us. (This definitely does not happen in a lot of restaurants when a specific table or area is requested.)   We started with the coconut spring rolls, which were crispy and delicious (four to an order). My wife had the Queen of Siam Basil Chicken and I had the Bangkok Panang Curry with shrimp as a main course. Both were excellent and seasoned to our desired level of hotness.  The wait staff was friendly and efficient. As noted by other reviews, the prices are a bit higher than what is normaly expected for Thai/Vietnamese food, but as one quickly learns in Las Vegas, nothing is cheap on The Strip. And compared to other restaurants that we visited on this trip, the prices were actually moderate.  SEA is a restaurant definitely worth visiting. It's small, so I'd recommend making a reservation - and requesting a table by the pool.",

A bit loud at first, even some unhappy faces (for some reason) but once we got an appetizer, Fresh spring rolls - just like in Vietnam :)  Than we got drunken man noodles and East West Shrimp. For shrimps it said \"Load of shrimp\" on the menu - they really mean it!!!  Drunken man noodles were fantastic !!! Shrimps were awesome!!! Taste was just right!!! Service was wonderful, waiter was on time, with no extra stupid checkups.    Only a bit weird thing was, their alcohol, beer, wine etc. is served from a small restaurant next door. And they will bring you a separate check :)  The best thing was, I cut myself tapping to the very nice techno bit in the middle of our dinner, which was pretty loud... but sure enough - some bi*h complained.... cause it went away in a second.  So... that is all for my experience...  VERY recommend if you like Thai / Vietnamese food and great service!",

I asked for mild pineapple fried rice and there were A TON of whole/half thai chilis mixed in (which are EXTREMELY spicy).  They also used a lot of pepper.  Overall, my pineapple fried rice wasn't anything special and definitely spicier than I would have liked.  Expect to pay about $16/entree, which is double the price anywhere else for the same thing (might even taste better at the cheaper restaurants).  Our bill was a little over $50 (not including tip) for 2 entrees and 2 alcoholic drinks.  For that price, you might as well save it for The Buffet at Bellagio across the street.",

So when i can find a place that's open late and serves really good food, even if it's a few bucks more than i would pay elsewhere, I'm stoked.  We found Sea after arriving late on a business trip. I was looking for something resembling supper so i wouldn't be stuck eating a pre made cafe sandwich for $12. We asked a cocktail waitress and she mentioned the cafe (shocking) and almost off the cuff, Sea. I love me some Thai, so we rolled.  Seats are half table and chair, half blocks of wood next to a pool. If your back is fickle, ask for the table and chair.  So, the chow; i had Drunken Noodles, a dish i would have all the time at a local place in Pasadena while i was working there. It wasn't on the menu when i would have it, i though it was just something the chef would whip up based on what i liked. But lo and behold, here it appears on the menu and once brought to me, it was PERFECT. Flat noodles in a spicy brown sauce with basil, peppers and onions, chicken and garlic. Incredible.  The waitress was on the ball the whole time, the food was great and in Vegas terms, it didn't break the bank. All around win. When conference comes around, i expect to eat here nightly.",

The front of the restaurant has two hanging egg chairs which is cool because no one else has it! We ordered the lollipop chicken but it was a busy so don't get it. We got the coconut rolls instead and that was tasty!  My husband ordered the spicy pork belly and it was so hot and spicy he was sweating while eating it. I ordered the garlic chicken with mixed veggies. That was delicious!  I would recommend this place to others fruit are in Las Vegas and in the Bally's or Paris hotel .",

They need to warm the plates before serving. The  chicken and shrimp dumpling appetizer was delicious. Beware... The Tamarind Bass is a complete fish, so is best if split between a group of diners.",

Well its in fact a hidden gem.  The ambiance is very relaxing a tranquil, very good from the high stress daily Vegas fight.  We started with two appetizers, i ordered the lettuce wraps and the wife ordered the tup tim fritters.  The lettuce wraps are the best we ever had in our life, so flavorful.  The tup tim fritters were good as well, but no match for the wraps.  For our entrees i ordered the malay massaman curry and the wife had the ginger and pineapple stir fry.  Her was good but the Curry was absolutely fantastic.  Im not a curry person but it really blew my socks off.  Wife enjoyed hers, but she kept thinking and talking about the lettuce wraps.  The entire rest of the trip the wife kept wanting to go back for some lettuce wraps, just as a snack.  But we were staying in that hotel and i like to try something different each time during the trip.  Next time we will definately be stopping by again for some lettuce wraps.  Oh and the travelzoo voucher was just the icing on the cake money wise.  A definite recommendation while in Vegas!!",

    "text": "I had a taste for thai food and was looking for a close place to the Bellagio hotel. I found this on yelp and was listed as $$ for food which is un True. I had the coconut crusted shrimp for appetizer and that was excellent. Price $13 a little high in my opinion. Then I wanted to eat Tum yum soup and still quite expensive as a bowl is $14, but I had a taste for it and when it came as I ordered it mild, it was Blane. Every thai restaurant I go to when ordering mild it should have some kick, but it did not. Broth was cloudy and had to pick out some inedible stuff in the soup that felt like plastic, but was probably lemon grass or something else. I would think if u are eating a dish that you don't have to fight it to eat it. My main dish was Massaman Curry, which I though was yellow curry, but I think it is peanut based. In any case very blan taste and not spicy at all when ordered mild. When I ordered that they ask you if you want rice and that's another price add on for $3.00 for a small bowl of rice. For crying out loud all thai restaurant will give you a bowl of rice with the order. Pepsi was $4.00 and they didn't have thai ice tea on the menu as I asked if they have that, and they said yea. However, didn't think about asking price as Thai ice tea is usually $3.00and they charges $5.00. Next be aware they automatically add gratuity of 18% on my bill called \"party gratuity as I was only one person! All in all I spent $78.18 for a dinner that was not worth the price. Fair warning to all to avoid this place as they Nickle and dime you and food is not that great. It got great ratings on yelp, but wonder if there are so many tourists that don't know what good Thai food taste like. As I am from Chicago and travel quite a bit to experience many Thai restaurants. Hope this helps other to decide if they want to choose this restaurant, as I will not on my next visit.",

    "text": "The first night we ate there we were impressed by the crab rangoon.  It was a nice blend of spicy, scallions and crab.  Some of the best eaten ever.  We also had the Island Red Curry and The Spicy Shrimp Rice.  Was average but the cost was ridiculously high.  $22 per plate and I do not mind paying that in Vegas so the overall experience was good.  The tables are old and chipped, very outdated to justify ambience, food and price but it was down to earth  Because the crab rangoon was so special, we decided to eat there a second night.  And of course started out with the crab rangoon.  The first bite, I thought, this is doughy, like it had been sitting out.  But then I though maybe my taste buds were off since I was so tired.  So I took a second bite and got a ball of ice.  So that means what I thought was so special was either a buy in or made and then frozen or they were going bad so they froze them.  No kidding, you just don't play with seafood like that.  The plate was sent back with forgiveness and the second order came.  Again, frozen.  When you give someone a second chance, there was obviously no pride taken in the cooking that night and we probably just hit it on a day when there was a high note but this seemed standard.  We showed the owner/manager the plate and had him touch the inside.  His face went sour and was so sorry.  I told him I was too but I am not playing when it comes to possible health issues, we were paying for nothing and leaving.  He did not try to make any good will gestures.  It left such a sick feeling in my stomach, we made several attempts to eat in Bally's and just got sicker by the minute.  It ended as a bad eating night and a belly full of hunger.  It was a good thing we had a fresh cupcake in the room.  Would I go there again?  NO!  The risk outweighs the first experience there and could lead me to getting sick.",

I love flat noodles and this dish was awesome. I would definitely come back and order the same thing again. The atmosphere was great.

I sat at a table right next to a shallow pool with a Buddha statue at the head of the pool. The food was good, fresh. I got tofu with ginger and vegetables with brown rice.  I also got lemongrass ginger tea and an Old Cuban mixed drink. They were delicious!!!!",

    "text": "This was definitely a hidden gem.  We had tickets to see Jubilee and wanted to do dinner before hand at Bally's.  Thought SEA would be a great change from what we are schedule to eat during the rest of our trip.  It is way it the back corner of the casino by BLTsteak.  Nice quite and tucked in.  Beautiful interior, with a central water feature.  2 minor issues.  This is a pricey restaurant so I would not expect for them to have the cheapest, crappiest chopsticks I've ever used.  My thai restaurant at home has significantly nicer sticks and the dishes are half the price.  Really no excuse for short cheap wood that don't separate.  A place this nice should have beautiful sticks.  The other is that we order a pitcher of tea and the \"pitcher\" is a tuberwear jug.  With the label on it.  Again where is the class.  I can see beautiful teapots on the other table but I have a $2 plastic jug. Mind you the tea was pored into wine glasses but really.  Ok onto the greatness...the food. Before appetizers we did the crab Rangoon and the honey walnut shrimp.  The Rangoon was good, what made it great was the sauce.  At first my dad thought they forgot to bring the sauce because he couldn't see it.  It is a cleanish cucumber sweet sauce.  Totally elevated the Rangoon.  The honey walnut shrimp were tasty with a light batter and lots of crunch.  I am addicted to pad Thai and I firmly believe that you can judge a thai restaurant by its pad Thai.  So I was really excited when I saw they had crazy pad Thai- a choice of duck or calamari.  I did the duck. And I have never been happier.  Part way through the meal I told my dad that I felt like a vacuum because I was just sucking it up.  The duck was so tender and succulent.  Just thinking about it again makes me happy.  Plus there were plenty of peanuts.",

I've never been to the one in New York, or feel very snobby about Thai food, so I give this two thumbs up, a satisfied tummy and four stars.   First of all, the interior design is incredible. It's almost as if you are dining inside a fountain with Buddha. The seats are level with the water feature, and a statue garnishes the very end of the pool.   We had a large group, so they accommodated us without a reservation in their back group seating area behind privacy screens. The service was simply amazing. They all treated us like kings. Very attentive and suggestive.   The food was phenomenal. They put all kind of good stuff in their dishes like basil and chilies. They've got a great wine selection, and very reasonable prices for what you pay in Vegas.",

We can't exactly remember the names of the dishes but we do remember that they were delicious. The waiter was very helpful in giving us suggestions and was very attentive. Last time we were in Las Vegas we couldn't find this restaurant as we forgot our cell phones so we had to eat somewhere else. This time we checked to see where it really was before heading out to eat. This restaurant is in the Bally's Casino. The restaurant decor is relaxing and the place was full when we finished our meal. We highly recommend this restaurant and we will return next time we are in Vegas and want some tasty Thai food.",

Due to food allergies and lactose intolerance we had a pretty specific order, and unfortunately our waitress didn't follow through with any of our requests. The pad thai arrived first, covered with peanuts, so that had to be taken back right away since my guest preferred not to make a trip to the hospital. Then the tom yum soup arrived, and surprise, surprise, they still added milk! Luckily my guests had some lactaid pills with them, so they popped those instead of waiting for a new order. This restaurant also charges you for rice- we ordered a large, the waitress brought out a small. We also got pho tai and garlic chicken, but like the other 2 dishes, they were nothing special. Needless to say, I won't be returning.",

They have the best crab Rangoon I've ever tasted...and the chili jam added another dimension of great to the plate! We also got the honey walnut shrimp, which was amazing!  Then came the short ribs, which really had an amazing flavor, but they were  dry and there was quite a bit of grissle to cut off.  Next came the holy basil seafood, which had a nice amount of  good seafood and basil in it, but no remarkable flavor. The menu states that it has a spicy basil sauce, but it was not spicy at all. It was very bland.  Also, worth mentioning is that nothing comes with rice. They charge you extra if you want rice, which I found strange, considering that their menu items are pretty pricey to begin with.  All in all, it was a fun evening, since we stopped in to see the dueling piano show on our way out, but I don't think I would make a special trip back there for the food.",

Right after we ordered I went to the bathroom to wash my hands and by the time I came back he had already been served and had eaten all the dumplings because he said they were so good. I had the Malay curry and walnut shrimp. Food was delicious and served quickly. You could choose the level of spiciness. I don't like spicy at all and had mine at a #1 which was perfect for me. My friend had his at a level III and said that it was exactly what he was expecting. It is slightly pricey but in terms of Vegas standard it's pretty baseline. Definitely recommend. Great ambience.",

We kind of ordered family style so we could try all the dishes we ordered. We made a reservation beforehand and ever seated us away from the main dining area. Our room had a TV in it. Service was good as well even while we were tucked away.   The rib eye salad was incredible. The dressing matches well with the fresh greens. It had a hint of spice which I really enjoyed which I didn't expect. And the meat was cooked beautifully with lots of flavor while still tender.  The fried calamari was my next favorite. It had a dipping marinara sauce that was kind of sweet... maybe something like honey was added to it. It worked really well with the crispy calamari. Beware of the fried chili pepper because it will be very spicy!!!  The pineapple fried rice was great as well. But I could tell that they didn't use fresh cut pineapple. It seemed like canned pineapple. It was still enjoyable.  The Tom yum soup had lots and lots of seafood. I only wish the base was a bit tangier and spicier. It was a lot for an order of the soup.   Our table ordered the Pad Thai and the drunken man noodles. I thought they were okay... nothing crazy amazing about them but I still ate them.",

With that said the portions were generous.  I would say a couple could do a salad.  An app.  And an entree and share for about 60.  The seafood was particularly good.    There are tons of Groupon offers  though so buy one before you dine.  You basically get an app for free if you do.   Chicken lettuce wrap was best app for 15.

Homemade noodles and sauces, and just the right flavors. They do cater to a more American palate when it comes to spice level however, so ask for it hot if you like it Thai spicy! My only True complaint is the price. It's a bit expensive for what it is, but of course it's on the strip, so not much can be expected in that way. The pad see ew was fantastic as it is it fairly difficult to find homemade rice noodles. I would definitely return!",

Not used to that. Then another lady came and took our orders. We tried two appetizer dumplings, seafood pho and the volcanic chicken. The appetizers came out with great presentation and had really great flavor! Very authentic. My pho had a TON on actual meat and amazing broth. The volcanic chicken was a little less impressive in my opinion but was still good. After we finished the server brought or check with the groupon applied, I informed her the other sever who sat us down had already redeemed the groupon. She disappeared for awhile and came back with a corrected bill. Overall this place was nice and had a cool atmosphere but I think it was a little overpriced and the service was lacking.

    "text": "I came here because it was relatively convenient. I ordered Pad Thai. It was easily the worst Pad Thai I've ever had.   I will also point out that if you are gluten intolerant, you should avoid this restaurant. Their menu is conveniently marked with gluten free items. That's a plus. Unfortunately, they've marked items that are definitely NOT gluten free (e.g. egg noodles, which are made from wheat) as being safe to eat. Then they marked items with rice noodles as being not gluten free. It's pretty clear these people do not understand what gluten is, so you cannot trust any guidance they might give for eating choices.",

    "text": "Found this place on Yelp. We didn't make reservations but it was a Wednesday night in April so we just walked in. We were seated right away. The ambiance is simple yet elegant. They have a cool reflective pond with built in tables around it. Fairly traditional menu. Almost everything was under $30. The waitress came to take our drink order shortly after we sat down. Then took our food order. We started with the Coconut Spring rolls (4) and I ordered the cashew stir fry with chicken and my SO ordered the massaman curry with chicken. You can order your spicy level from 1-5.  5 being Thai spicy, so we both ordered a level 4.   The coconut spring rolls tasted fresh and crunchy. Very hot (temp). Let them cool first! I thought the dipping sauce had fresh flavor but was not very flavorful (if that makes sense).   My SO though that it might be dragonfruit sauce.  The massaman curry had a flavorful curry broth with chunks of potato and onion and a fair amount of chicken. Very flavorful, really liked it. On the spice level, it was a little on the mild side.   Cashew stir fry was also very flavorful but had no spice, even though I ordered a level 4. We got some sauces on the side which were really yummy and spiced things up a bit.   We didn't have room for dessert (so sad) but we really enjoyed eating here. I recommend this place if you like Thai food.",

I asked about sauces and they were kind enough to bring out three. The peanut sauce and the Thai chili sauces were amazing. The portions were large so we had plenty to take home and enjoy later too!  We may very well go back again during this trip. The service was so attentive and they were really kind!   Definitely stop here for great authentic Thai food",

    "text": "Went to this place with my family during our last night at Vegas. It's all the way in the back of Bally's casino. I was a bit overwhelmed that we had to traversed up the escalator, into this building that isn't super well lit, and down the escalators again to reach like a shopping strip and the casino. Then had to walk all the way towards the back to find this restaurant tucked in the back and around the other restaurants. Oh and they don't have bathrooms, so you have to find your way around the maze of the casino, but if it's easier, just walk along the walls and you'll find one.   We got a Groupon if $69 for $100 worth of food, which was great since every dish is about $22. We ended up ordering 5 dishes (1 noodle, 1 rice, 1 veggie, 1 curry, and 1 appetizer), 2 side dishes, a couple of drinks, and it was enough for a party of 6. Mind you though, the portions were rather small but we managed to get ourselves full. Perhaps because we weren't really hungry? They also charge 20% tip for parties over 5.  Overall the food was okay. The curry and the egg noodles were probably my favorite. I did think that it was overpriced for the quantity and the type of food. They say they're a Thai fusion place but didn't see any \"fusion\".  The servers were nice and came to check up on us often and the restaurant had a calm ambiance, there is a pond in the middle with lotus flowers!  Would come again if the Groupon is available.",

Both were very tasty though the coconut shrimp had a little too much breading and was fried a little too hard. But enjoyable nonetheless.  My husband's sizzling mixed seafood combo was very good although couldve used a sauce to compliment the dish. My short ribs and mixed greens salad was great! I received 4 huge pieces of ribs and a nice sauce to dip on the side. They were seasoned really well and very juicy.",

I had the Panang Curry (my Thai litmus dish), and it was tasty, but too salty. My boyfriend had a fried scallop dish, and it was also too salty. The drinks were okay. This is not the most authentic Thai you can get in Vegas. The food is overpriced, the service is a little slow, and the atmosphere is so-so. If you want a real Thai experience, check out Lotus of Siam.",

    "text": "Three big reasons this place knocked it out of the park, IMO: 1) I had an incredible spicy seafood salad with squid, octopus, shrimp, scallion, cilantro, some kind of funky-lacy-semi-rubbery mushroom that I'd never seen or tasted before, lime-hot pepper dressing, and a few other things.  Without a doubt the best salad I have ever tasted, just bursting with fresh flavor. 2) With that, as a perfect complement, I enjoyed coconut shrimp that was sweet, crispy, and cooked just right. 3) Finally, my dining companion had  Pad Thai, which he said was boring.  This is a True sign of Thai cuisine perfection, because anyone with taste buds and some dining experience knows that Pad Thai is basically a boring dish.  It's Thai comfort food, and usually, when prepared in the traditional way, is less exciting than a good meat loaf.  The restaurant was also very elegant and pretty in an understated way, and our server was very friendly and efficient.  This place is on my go-to list for Vegas dining.",

Okay I recommend to get the Drunken men noodles, it has a mix of mango, tomatoes, green and red peppers and the noodles is not your typical string noodles they are thin wide if hat makes sense.

The food is very good! I had black noodles  (pad see ewe) and they were great! That is saying something,  because I am picky. My husband's drunken noodles wete also great.   My only complaint is the price. I order Pad see ewe all the time.  It usually ranges between  $7-$12, depending on where you are. When we got our receipt,  we were floored. It was $21 per plate! That is a ridiculous amount. I'd give 5 stars if the price weren't so high, in fact, I may change my rate to a 3, because the price was that astronomical. It was no different from great Thai food in my neighborhood,  even the higher end restaurants. Why, then, did I pay double?",

We asked the chicken massaman curry to be spicy and what came was a flavor less curry with dollops of red chili powder mixed in from the top. That probably caused us to fall sick. The fried rice was barely passable.   Even the service was slow and lackluster. Please stay away from this place.",

    "text": "My cousins and I decided to try this restaurant out as it was inside of Bally's and we wanted Thai food. We made reservations. We specifically told them that we have two wheelchair bound individuals and will need extra space. They sat us in the middle of the restaurant with many tables surrounding us. Not giving anyone much room to move around. If someone was sitting behind you-- you could touch their backs. Minus 1 star. While we were waiting for the rest of our party, we had asked for the bill split per table-- they said they would accommodate that.   As we all placed our orders, the restaurant got a little busier. We slowly started to feel like the waiters were not as attentive as they should have been. When we all got our food, we noticed that several of our dishes were incorrect but with the length of time to get our food most of us just dealt with it. Minus 1 star. I have a food allergy and they did not list what they used as garnish on the dishes. When I received my dish, it had mangoes on it--I am allergic to mangoes, and asked them to cook a new batch. Which they did and the food came out promptly. Minus only 1/2 of a star.   The food was subpar for the price we paid for it. The best tasting items in my opinion were the appetizers. No one was wowed by any of the mains. Many of the group struggled to eat their food as the found it to be bland or too spicy. They did not ask each individual how spicy they wanted their food. Minus half a star.   When we asked for the bill, the host and a waiter both said they would get it to us shortly. 15 minutes go by and we still don't have a bill. We finally ask again for a bill and we receive one large bill. Once we received it we notice it was not split the way we asked them to but we're already irritated with the service that we didn't bother. Minus a star. We changed the tip from the automatically charged gratuity as we felt the service did not match what we felt it should be for a \"gourmet\" restaurant.   This was honestly the first restaurant via Yelp that a lot of the reviews said it was poor service and subpar food and I actually agreed with it. Sorry Sea, you were not the Thai experience I was expecting.",

    "text": "This is a decent little Thai place located in Bally's Hotel/Casino.  It's not the cheapest meal you'll find in Vegas, but it's competitively priced at least. I'd say the menu is 40% seafood, 40% \"landfood\", and 20% noodle bowls or soups.  So there's a decent variety for everyone.  I had the Pad Thai with tofu ($23).  I ordered spice level 4 out of 5 and it wasn't very spicy.  It has the usual ingredients, rice noodles, bean sprouts, peanuts, peanut sauce, etc. that you would expect to find in a traditional pad thai dish.  The tofu was cooked to a slightly nice crisp, so it wasn't soft and mushy - and they included plenty of it.  The Holy Basil Seafood Combo ($28) was a very decent serving size.  It included steamed tilapia, shrimp, scallops, squid, and plenty of mussels, drizzled in a spicy basil sauce.  Rice is not included with either of these dishes - a small order of jasmine rice is $3.  Bottled domestic beer $7, bottled import or craft beer is $8.  All in all, it was a very nice dining experience.  Courteous staff, not too loud, and not very crowded.  One final note - if you have your credit card tied to your Yelp account, they offer 3% cash back to your card. But Yelp changed the rules somewhere along the line and you now have to click \"activate\" on the business page before swiping your card.  So obviously, I didn't get the discount.  It used to be automatic - all you would have to do is use your connected card.  ProTip - if you find one of the several ticket sales joints in Vegas called Tix4Tonight, buy their yellow discount card.  It's $3 for the one that covers discounts on the buffets, but I got one that just covered discounts on restaurants and it was free.  I was able to use it here to get 20% off the total bill.",

But quickly, we were greeted by a sweet young lady with a pleasant smile.  She sat us near the beautiful statue at the middle water feature.  The bench seats don't look like benches.   It's a great design and very comfortable.  There's a certain feeling of tranquility initially.   Then when they turned on music (not loud which is great), it doesn't match the decor.  I was hoping for some Thai music in the background but it was soft rock.  We ordered... Thai iced tea Crab meat fried rice Island red curry (vegetables)  Although we didn't order much, the portions were big and we didn't finish our lunch.  Everything was fresh and delicious!  That delicious smell of the food was intoxicating.   Although we were full in the end, we kept reaching into the plates for another little bite.  Yeah,  that good!!!  The crab fried rice was incredible.   The fried rice portion was on the bottom and the lump crab mix with the rice was placed on top of the rice.  I liked that so we don't miss the crab.  The crab was very fresh and delicious.   Our server Ray Jai and the young man that brought our food were both very attentive, pleasant and professional.   We'll definitely be back to try other curries but will definitely order the crab fried rice again!",

As mentioned earlier, the restaurant is located inside of Bally's and it's kind of hidden away from the casino's crowd and noise which was a plus.  The decor is chic and the little pond in the center is extremely soothing. The menu shows a broad range of entrees and appetizers. The server made several adjustments to our orders. We had a Seafood hot pot, another seafood dish and an Eggplant dish. The food was very delicious, fresh and flavorful. It was overpriced for what it is but that's the price you pay for dining at The Strip. Overall, I am impressed with their ambiance, food and service.",

Be sure to get the fried calamari..it's crispy and tender. I especially enjoy the tentacles  The pork dumpling skewers are delicious and I really like the sauce. We also had the shrimp and drunken noodles and the chicken curry. Both were good but not exceptional.  This restaurant is a bit pricey, but it is located on the strip at Bally's casino. We had a Groupon this time, so it was nice to save a bit. There are other places in Las Vegas that are less in price and better tasting, but this place is very convenient. I would definitely recommend and will go back and try a few other things!",

The server wasn't sure how the groupon worked so we had to wait for the manager to explain it to us which took a bit of time considering they weren't busy.

Had I known about the Groupon deal in advance I would have taken advantage and made the dining experience worth while.  The decor is chic and the little pond in the center is extremely calming. There were several moments during our meal that we stopped talking to simply admire it. Kinda hypnotic now that I think of it.   Our Spicy seafood and rib eye salads were lip smacking delicious and the perfect size. Just enough to tease your appetite without making you too full and unable to enjoy the entree. The flavors really complimented each other. In the future I'd skip the entree and order 2 Spicy Seafood salads.   The entree, the Eat Your Greens stir fry, was a salty miss. We had to send it back after our server walked by several times and noticed we weren't eating it. It was way too salty and I initially didn't want to send it back bcz I hate doing that. The remake was ok but clearly watered down (literally). I think it was a premade sauce and there wasn't anything they could do about it.   Overall, it's a great dining experience but I'd suggest the groupon that's mentioned in the reviews bcz it would give more value and an opportunity to sample multiple dishes.",

It's conveniently located in the center of the strip inside of Bally's hotel, 1st floor. When you enter the restaurant, there's seating for about 50 guests or so (it is rather small so make sure to make a reservation). They immediately sit you down and are very efficient with taking the orders right away. Try to get a table next to the Buddha sculpture; it's the best view.   They've got a broad range of entrees and appetizers! My friends all got pad Thai and I got the beef ribs and my friends fought to try some of mine. NOT TODAY SATAN. These ribs are all mine. They were so juicy, tender, and it was a huge portion for just $27! The waiters are very sweet, they surprised me with a dessert platter for my birthday dinner there!   My only criticism is that the entrees are more on the expensive side for Thai food, but that's Vegas for you. Otherwise, 10/10 would recommend.",

I ordered the Pho Tai (rare steak) and my hubs ordered the Chicken Phad Thai. Doesn't get any easier than this. EVERYTHING was delicious! My Pho came with a VERY GENEROUS serving of broth, noodles and rare steak. On the side I was given bean sprouts, basil and jalapenos. I had to ask for a serving of their chili sauces, and they were a perfect addition. I couldn't get enough. I was stuffed to the brim and still had leftovers. My hubs loved his phad thai. Perfect combination of sweet, spicy and peanutty-ness. The ambiance was very mellow and chill. Very modern Asian feel. Our booth was in a corner so had to slide all the way over to get some privacy from the booth right next to us. They had some fresh roses placed on the tables and fake candles to add to the mood. Seating was comfortable. BUT this place is a little PRICY. Ok, a lot pricy. My Pho was a whopping $15, and my hubs Phad Thai was $17 even though he asked them to hold the shrimp in his dish. I think if someone requests to withhold a major ingredient the price should be lesson (like an easy $2 less or something). It's located in the Bally's Casino and Hotel next to a Steak House and Cantina. Would probably not go again just because of the price. I can get delicious thai or vietnamese food anywhere else for half the price that I paid here. ENJOY - 'cause I DID! :)",

It wasn't really that busy when we got there, and though it picked up a little bit later, I don't think they really came around to see how we were doing,  if we needed anything else.

It was another really late night in Vegas, we took a cab back from old Vegas and decided to have them drop us off at a random spot on the strip to find some dinner. It was close to midnight but Sea was open and there was a decent crowd in there still. The decor is beautiful and tranquil, much needed, especially after spending the evening in old Vegas. The service was quick and pleasant and the suggestion for me to try the pomegranate mojito was perfect. The menu was a little confusing at first until I realized one side is the Thai side and the other is the Vietnamese side. For dinner I had spicy noodles with chicken. It was OK. I asked for medium spice level but it really tasted like there was not spice at all. I was in the mood for something spicy so that was a little disappointing. The prices weren't bad at all and I left with a satisfied belly.",

I ordered the sauteed vegetables with garlic sauce (came with rice on the side) at heat level 3.  We loved what we ordered, although I will admit that next time I will order heat/spiciness level 2 for myself.  I have to commend them:  the spiciness was not just \"hot for hot's sake\", but had real depth of flavor.  I will also say that the mango smoothie we had for dessert was the perfect calming point for my palate.  The restaurant was peaceful, lovely.  We were at a bench/table.  One really neat feature:  There was a large group dining in the side area and there are pivoting glass divider panels that the staff used that really cut down on sound transmission.  What a great thing to have.  I agree with other postings, it is not inexpensive, but I thought it was good value for the quality of food, service, ambiance and location.  We will return the next time we are near Bally's",

    "text": "I took a group of 11 to this Thai restaurant this last Sunday, January 15th around 6:30. We were all in the mood for Thai and since this restaurant was able to seat us we were happy.  When we arrived at the table we were short a seat and asked for another one as there was an entire table in our area that didn't have a seat at it but it was connected to our row of tables. We waited 10 minutes for the seat while one of our the people in our group stood and talked to everyone. We then asked for another seat again and nothing came for another 5 minutes. We then just took a seat from another patrons table once they said they weren't using it.   It turns out we were probably better off going to In and Out Burger. The food was \"ok\" if you ignore the fact that they switched the spice on my dish and gave me 5 stars instead of one and my friend received no stars. After we covered my friends dish in hot sauce I asked for a replacement because they switched the spice.     The waiter said he would, then asked if I would like some chicken dumplings while I waited and I said that would be great. I then didn't see the waiter for a bit. He finally came by and said he didn't bring my dumplings because I received tofu with my meal, he wasn't sure if I was a vegetarian. Except that I did say I would like chicken dumplings. After he walked away I then motioned for his attention and asked what else I could be compensated with since my meal was still not there and my party was almost done eating. He asked if I wanted a drink, I said yes then I waited 10 more minutes. I then asked the waiter where the drink was and he said he'd check on it. He found the drink at someone else's table. He then remade my drink and instead of a mojito I received an ice syrup drink that was disgusting.  On top of all of this, my final meal was not all that great.    Once we all put our cards in to pay for the waiter, I asked for change or to tell me if we were short cash. He already had an 18% gratuity on the bill. He then returned 5 minutes later and said we were square. I did the math and we were actually over $50 dollars of the owed bill.    So, in the end here is what we experienced:  1. Bad service 2. Weak drinks 3. Hard to find seating. 4. Non-responsive staff 5. Bland food 6. Could not get the spice right 7. Did not compensate for mistakes 8. Overcharged and was dishonest",

Both were good, the curry having a good amount of heat as requested, but the 18$ for each entree was on the high side of what it should have been.  The pho ga broth seeemed overly salty and oily.  If you have to eat here, its OK, but if you have a car, go visit a real Thai place.",

However, although the chicken in the center of the dish was hot, the sauce was spread out over a large plate and so was quite cold by the time it reached our table. Also, desert wasn't all that great. We got the golden banana roll, which was somewhat dry. Additionally, it was served with a raspberry sauce, which was incredibly salty! When we asked the server if the raspberry sauce was salted, it turned out she didn't know anything about the dessert at all and went to the kitchen to ask. She returned, saying that the sauce is NOT salted, that the cooks tasted the sauce and said it was fine. This is impossible, as the sauce was saltier than cup-a-noodle soup! I think they may have made a batch with salt instead of sugar. Next time we go, we'll skip dessert!",

I thought thai food was supposed to be spicy to begin with? After sending the food back, it was finished correctly and had plenty of spice. Great taste and more than enough to fill up one person per plate. The service was good. The server was very polite, attentive and knowledgable of the cuisine. The manager even stopped by to check on us a couple of times. The bartender delivered our drinks and was very helpful with suggesting cocktails. Overall, this is a good place for beginners in ethnic food. Not too spicy and great taste with a helpfull staff.",

We each ordered 1 well drink (rum & coke, gin & tonic), and specified house liquor. We shared a soup appetizer, pork belly with baby bok choy, and phad thai. The food was all very good, but everything was expensive. The main dishes were $18 each, and we just about crapped our pants when we got the bill and saw our house-well drinks were $10 each. That is insane. If we ever go back, we've learned our lesson not to order alcoholic drinks.

I wanted a glass of green tea, but it is only served by the pitcher ... at $10. Food was mediocre.   I was also sat behind the screen, which is where they seem to sit people they want out of view. The lighting back there is harsh and is right next to the kitchen. The vibe is entirely different there. I was dining alone and I guess that marked me as an undesirable one that had to be seated away from the many empty tables out front. Also back there was a group of 80+ year olds and later a Middle Eastern couple that eventually asked to be moved to the front (maybe they didn't like being sat next to the single guy).   There are better Thai options on the Strip and even better off the strip. Save your dough.",

Average food, but an elevated experience because the service is pleasant and attentive without being overbearing, and the atmosphere is modern and chic, with a beautiful reflection pool in the middle of the restaurant.  We ordered the 4 Seasons roll (great crunch), the chicken satay (average), and for entrees, Asian Jungle curry and Eat Your Greens stir fry. The curry was the better dish of the two, with a nice warmth from fresh peppercorns and an earthiness from basil. The Eat Your Greens, while the veggies were flash-fried to a perfect crispness, retaining much of the snap and bite, the sesame oil disappeared in the garlic sauce, and despite my request to make it \"super spicy,\" there was absolutely no spice whatsoever, and the amount of chili sauce required to get a little heat out of the dish distorted its flavor with its vinegar and salt.  It's a nice atmosphere for a date night - quiet, set away from the casino floor - but the food is definitely watered-down compared to spots like Lotus of Siam or Komol. Come here if you can get a Groupon - but I wouldn't pay full price.",

Well for sure borderline but not quite authentic.  Sometimes I hate that I compare foods to where they originate from because it can ruin the \"experience\".  I mean overall it was not bad just very generic.  I ordered the papaya salad which should have a little kick to it and with fresh shrimp, this one had dried inedible shrimp and zero kick.  I ordered the prawns and glass noodles, the prawns were delightful but the glass noodles just tasted like they were mixed with a little soy sauce.  Also tried the calamari which was very good.  The Thai tea was good as well.  I though it was odd that there was not an offering of Thai chili, I requested some and was brought back some in a glass cup.   The restaurant is cozy and has a really nice atmosphere, the servers were gracious and helpful, pricing is a bit ridiculous but so is most pricing of restaurants now in Las Vegas strip area.",

The pad see ew had a good sauce but the gai lan was blanched instead of stir-fried with the noodles which made for flavorless gai lan. The duck confit was very good. I had a discount for a Groupon deal, so based on what I paid the value was fine. The reason I selected this deal was because the photos on their website lead you to believe it will be an \"experience\" with out of this world food with spectacular playing. None of the plating was particularly special. Needless to say I would never return to pay the exorbitant strip prices. I'll stick with my fave spot in Henderson.",

We were there before the other parties but the wAitress decide to tAke their orders first then came to us like 10 mins later to take my order.

I asked my fiance a question about the food and the waitress says to me Rudely...\"HE CANNOT TOUCH YOUR FOOD HE HAS TO ORDER HIS OWN!!! WE DONT DO SHARING IN HERE!!!  I was like wow. She says I wouldn't be able to eat there if he wasnt eating. Wow!! She then advise me to order it to go. I told her I was planning to eat there while we were waiting for his togo order. She took the menu from us said sorry and walked off. I have never been so angry in my life! I did not want to cause a scene because There were people in there trying to enjoy their dinner. I can't tell you how the food was but my waitress ruined my dinner!!!! I guess they get so many tourist that they don't care about losing any.  I wont be back.",

I am usually very understanding of issues that may arise, but this dinning experience was the first time in my life I have went to a manager to complain ever! I was unhappy with my food and the server said that he would take my dish off the bill. I was eating my husbands food because the beef In my pho was chewy and uneatable. When the server cleared the plates without asking I still had chopsticks in my hand eating off his plate....since I could not eat my own food which no one offered to fix, even after my comments about the food not being up to par ( also that wasn't the first time he tried to clear our plates while we were still eating). At the end of our meal the server stated that he would take my \"RARE\" STEAK PHO off the bill. Upon receiving the bill to my \"surprise\" considering the service.... this item was still on the bill. I went to the host stand and asked to speak to a manager, I explained to him what had happened and to my surprise the server came up and had the nerve to argue with me about the situation in front of his manager. The manager was good in the sense of telling him to apologize and pretty much just agree with me. That isn't what I was looking for but it was the right move!(from the in the biz prospective, you never argue with a guest once a manager is involved! That is what they are there for!) I have never in my personal or working life experienced such an unprofessional dinning experience from a server (IHOP has provided better service to their guest). I personally work at an establishment that receives many Yelp reviews. I am almost always mentioned by name (which I couldn't tell you our servers name,because he never told us) in multiple 5 star reviews due to my friendliness, attentiveness, and proper service! I have never felt the need to go to a manager in regards to a server before and I have never had one argue with me in front of management! This is why I am giving this establishment a 1 star review, if I had ever pulled a stunt like our server did I would be promptly unemployed!!!! There is no excuse for what happened and that server is lucky I understand the biz because if he had to deal with the cliental I deal with he would be cleaning bathrooms at the local Walmart!",

The pad siew on the other hand was soggy and over cooked. unfortunately, the seafood pot had hardly any seafood, maybe they made a mistake and put most of it in the tom ka? The chicken satay was on the dry side. We chose this place because it was convenient, and not a very long wait.",

The pho didn't come with the sate, chili paste, etc so that is a negative.  They did had the sprouts, lime, basil, etc.   The service was extremely slow for being one of the only ones in there.  I expected better service for $18 for a bowl of Pho.    I would go back again but expect to wait a little for food.",

    "text": "So I came here twice. Not that i had a first bad experience, i just didn't think I'd be back again but when youre staying at ballys, and you're craving noodles, and you're too lazy to leave the hotel, and the Chinese panda express-esque place in the food court is being rude and ignoring you.. I guess you'd somehow find yourself stumbling to the same Thai restaurant again.  So the interior and decor is absolutely beautiful!! My boyfriend and I sat by the water pond thing which felt very intimate and romantic. Kudos on the interior design. We ended up having a lovely dinner that I can only partially remember because let's be honest.. I'm in Vegas.   We had the mediocre-tasting pad Thai that cost $18. If this wasn't Vegas I'd be outraged cause who would really want to pay double the price for half the portion you can normally get at a Thai restaurant? But, like I said, it's Vegas and the interior was beautiful.   We also had some fried shrimp and chicken balls as appetizers for $8? It comes with 6 pcs with a yummy dipping sauce. I enjoyed it better than the overpriced pad Thai so I ordered it again the 2nd time I came here. Definitely worth it!",

    "text": "On our last night in Vegas, before driving home, the Boyfriend and I were trying to decide where to eat.  We were tired and hungry and sitting in the hallway to the parking lot of Paris.  We turned around and saw a poster for SEA directly above our heads.  Something in my mind clicked and I realized that this was the sister restaurant for SEA in New York which was featured in Sex & the City but also, more importantly, for one of my favorite scenes in one of my favorite movies of all time: Garden State.  \"umm...we're a Vietnamese restaurant?  We don't serve bread?\"  \"Can I get something to chew on?  F***, bamboo.  Whatever.\"  So it was decided that we would go to SEA for our final meal that weekend in Vegas.  I'd never had Vietnamese food before, so I stuck to my old standby, shrimp red curry and sticky rice, from the Thai said of the restaurant.  The shrimp was well cooked and the curry flavorful.  BF went for a Vietnamese noodle dish with steak.  Mine was very very good, however, the Vietnamese dish was outstanding.  I totally wished I'd gotten the same thing.  The noodles were delicate and the steak supremely flavorful and tender.  The atmosphere is great--I absolutely love sitting along the water, facing the statue.  I thought I would just explode quoting Garden State throughout dinner.  My one issue was that the lighting was dim and pleasant, but that there was no curtain separating the glaring kitchen lights from the rest of the eating area, some what taking away the dream light atmosphere.  Best of all, it didn't totally break the bank and was a truly delicious and memorable meal.  I love finding places like this along the strip!",

    "text": "Enjoyed the meal.  I tried something different than I usually get which was the Geyser Shrimp.  Rice noodles with shrimp and veggies.  Very tasty.  But if you want it Thai hot, you are really going to have to emphasize that.  I asked for it Thai hot but got normal hot so had to add the spice myself.  Others in the party had the rice plate with pork and something else which was really good and a shrimp/bok choy dish.    Service was fast on the food, slow on the drinks but that was in part because there was one server for the whole dining room and the bar was actually outside the restaurant in the casino.  Had the banana/wonton/cheesecake dessert.  Pretty good - tasted mostly of wonton and bananas.  One drawback was the loud techno music -- at 6pm.  Would have preferred something more soothing to match the wonderful decor and escape the 'ping ping' noises of the slot machines.  Reco going to Half Price tickets to get a 30% dining voucher as well.  Came in handy.",

Also asked for plates, but when I got to my room there weren't any in the bag so I had to comprise. This place is inside Ballys. I would eat there again. Kind of pricey, but it's Las Vegas.",

    "text": "We were craving Vietnamese/Thai food tonight.  I wanted to go to eat Pho but there aren't any that are on the strip and the thought of getting a cab at dinner time and then trying to get one back didn't sound pleasant.    We had been to Ballys earlier in the day and saw that they had a Thai restaurant there.   We looked at the reviews for Sea Thai on Yelp and they were decent.    We took the monorail back to Ballys from Harrahs and got there around 730.  It wasn't busy  (Wednesday night) so we got a table right away.  They sat us next to the water which was kind of romantic.  The server came promptly and asked us if we wanted drinks. We just got waters because when you are in Vegas why pay for alcohol when you can get it for free when you gamble.  For our meals I had the garlic shrimp and my fiance had the pho.  The meals were great.  I was kinda irritated that I got five prawns for 34 bucks and my fiance's bowl of pho was 19 bucks. I mean we had plenty of food, it just seemed expensive for Asian food and that was the reason I didn't want to dine here in the first place.    My fiance said that I have to think about the location of the restaurant, they have to be able to cover the rent.  He also pointed out the decor, most mom and pop pho or Thai restaurants are not decorated as nice.  I guess if you think about going off the strip to have dinner, you have to pay for a cab. Factor that in with your 6 dollar bowl of pho and your 13 dollar seafood dish and you are paying almost the same amount.  Yeah , they are higher priced than your typical Asian restaurant but the food is way better than the Pan Asian place in the food court.",

Fried calamari was decent - not too overdone but the sauce was delicious!  I had the pork chops and my son had the duck confit.  Portions are decent sized but the prices are BIG, overall the food was quite good.  $8.00 for edamame when it should only be $3.00, crazy.  You are definitely paying for the location.  For example I would normally have the Pad Thaii in addition to a main dish  but for the price of over $20.- I would not pay.  Besides when I saw the reviews for blah Pad Thai, I refused.    Service was terrific but as I mentioned having to walk thru a smelly smoke filled casino to get there is a turn off.  Yes, I'm in Vegas and don't gamble or smoke but I do eat.  It was a treat to go to an upscale expensive restaurant , but I would do go again.",

I ordered veggie egg rolls encrusted with toasty coconut as a starter. These little delicacies were served in a sea of sweet, slightly lemon sauce.

Being that we are huge fans of the Original SEA Restaurant in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, NY, we were excited to experience the same in Vegas. Right? Wrong! SEA in Brooklyn is NOTHING like the SEA in Las Vegas. When we entered, the ambiance was the same. Oh! It's also located inside of a hotel lobby. So, we sat down near the indoor water & the server greeted us with a kind attitude explaining to us the menu. So, the first difference is the food, Brooklyn's SEA definitely tastes better than Las Vegas' SEA. The prices in Brooklyn are also more affordable (which makes SEA in Brooklyn so popular). I hate to have to compare but how can you not when the SEA in Brooklyn is Famous? So famous that they made one in Las Vegas to mirror the original. Therefore, I'll be sticking to the original SEA.",

Veggies were real crisp announcing their freshness and scallops were tender and sweet.   Proper service was a major accompaniment.  Ambience was very nice, simplest furniture with modern take. Highly recommended. Little pricey though. I would recommend buying a dinner coupon at Tix4tonight, cost $2 each person for 30% discount on the entire bill.",

We tried a calamari and a shrimp appetizer. Both of these were delicious and are large portions. The calamari was nicely breaded and had a nice dipping sauce that was not too sweet. The shrimp were tempura breaded and plentiful.  The appetizers were good, but the entrees were the star of the meal. We tried one version of there duck fried rice. It was rich, delicious and full of savory duck meat. We also tried a seafood hot pot soup which was served in a flaming hot potato volcano. The soup was full of seafood and was delicious!

Their fried rice dishes are still the go-to here, along with their noodles so those would be my recommendations. The place is inside Bally's Hotel lobby all the way to the back so just a heads up if you're there looking for it.",

Each of the tables surrounds a pond that stretches across the middle of the restaurant.   The food was top-notch and the portion sizes were good. The presentation was also beautiful. For one our appetizers, we ordered fresh spring rolls, which all had different lengths and were laid vertically in a plate filled with dipping sauce. The only negative aspect of the food was the high prices.  The service was good but not excellent.    This is a great place to go to for fusion Asian food, especially if you are staying nearby. However, I feel that a decent portion of what you are paying is for the ambiance.",

They changed their menu and we asked the server about the old menu, he said (in broken English) the chef \"went away\" (we thought he said \"ran away\")... And that's exactly what we should have done when we heard that there's a new chef! RUN AWAY NOW!!   They still have Vietnamese pho but more Thai now. The WORST pho ever! My sister found a hair AND a bug in her soup! She asked them to take it back and they took forever for another one, she wasn't hungry after waiting another 30 minutes for pho. My other sister found a hair net in hers but she decided to just eat it. The pho was lukewarm, the broth was salty and since it wasn't even hot the meat didn't cook and it stayed raw. My friend asked if they could just microwave her pho for it to be hot and cook the meat, again it took forever. How long does it take to microwave it? The only good dish was the drunken noodles, which wasn't exactly hot as well. We also got the seafood soup and it was cold, and too sweet. It's like they let it sit out... I don't think the chefs in the back are actually chefs, they probably hired a chef school drop out... I mean, pho soup should be hot, not lukewarm.   You probably wondering, why are we getting pho on the strip? And not go to china town... We didn't have cars and were hungover and SEA is across from our hotel, trust me, paying $21 dollars for nasty ass cold pho with hair and bugs was not what we were looking for... This place should close down, it's a disgrace to Pho restaurants out there. I'm ashamed that I ate this.",

I'm not sure what stopped us, although we haven't stayed at Bally's for years, and SEA is tucked in behind the casino floor in kind of an out-of-the-way spot.    The food was so good we went back twice on the same trip.  The service can be a little slow at times, but I'm not rushing through the meal anyway, so it didn't matter much. But the servers are friendly, even if there is somewhat of a language barrier at times, but that's nothing new for many Thai places.    One odd thing is that the rice is an extra charge, which is the first time I've seen that at a Thai restaurant.    But it's good food and it saves you a cab ride to Lotus, Satay, Krung Siam, Le Thai, Komol, or any of the other comparable Thai places in Vegas.",

The prices are still high for the quality IMO",

Thank God I had a Groupon but even paying 50% off it was still not worth it.    Never order the Holy Basil Seafood Platter.  Basically boiled Seafood.  We ordered:  Crab Rangoons - Ok, Pick up Stix caliber Chicken Satae - Ehh Chicken lettuce wraps - blah Calamari - Very generic, nothing special  Chicken Cashew - YUM Holy Basil Seafood - NO GO.  So bland Sweet Potato Curry - Gross Ribeye Steak Salad - YUM, very spicy Drunken Man's Noodles - Good Thai Iced Tea - Good  Service was EXCELLENT.   Drinks refilled. Seated Timely.

There was a small bamboo swing and buddha statues situated throughout the restaurant. The whole feel was very tranquil and peaceful.   Our waitress was very nice and explained some of the specials to us. We ordered 2 dishes to share, the prices are a bit expensive but it's to be expected for a high end place on the strip. The food was pretty good, and the service was attentive. I really just like the whole vibe of this place.   Bathrooms are outside of the restaurant in the casino. It's bit of a walk to the restaurant from the parking structure. Overall, I would recommend this place!",

    "text": "It is my second time here and from what I recalled from my first trip (company paid) and it still seemed very expensive. It has been a few yeas but it definitely went up a few $. My partner told me about a Travelzoo deal $50 for 2 apps up to $15 each and 2 entrees up to $28 for lunch. They were really nice when we brought it up and was patient with us since we purchased it while we were there.   We got the fried shrimp appetizer with a spicy mayo type of sauce. Good quality and batter was tasty. Also got the steam dumplings, big portion and good quality.  For entrees, they did have some specials, the plates varied from Vietnamese, Korean, etc. Kind of threw me off since I thought it was a Thai restaurant experience but it's more Asian Fusion. We got the pad see ew chicken, big portion good quality chicken but the greens were ok, not well seasoned. I got the masasam curry which said it was rated top 10 dishes. They asked for spice level 1-5, a 2 was very mild. The dish was ok but had a good portion of beef. None of the entree came with rice so we order a side order for $5. They bring it in a cute pyramid shape however, the portion was super small, not equivalent to the curry.   Other things to note, the service in my opinion was excellent. I think we spoke to everyone in the restaurant. Ambiance is very cute, try to sit on the benches along the water. Thai tea is very delicious!   Overall, we did have to pay extra for the rice, Thai tea, tax, etc. after we tip off the original amount the total came to $80 (with Travelzoo deal). In my mind, yes we did save money but $80 for a Thai lunch is expensive for 2. $28 entrees is a bit excessive for lunch. I felt they could have done a lunch combo platter or 2/3 course meal. Plus, after the meal, I immediately didn't feel great.   3/5-hit or miss but overall not a mind blowing Thai experience.",

I found the service disorganized--several played hostess, several waited on you, several filled the water glass.  My hostess spoke little English.  It was a tag team of sorts, that I found chaotic in an enchanting room that should bring one peace.  They had fun low-appearing tables around the indoor koi pond but did not even invite me to sit here tho there was open seating.  I think it was being saved for couples--as several of us singles were placed along the sides.   It took a seriously long time for food to come out.  I ordered Bangkok Panang with Tofu.  It came out with chicken.  But because of the lonnnng wait I did not want to wait again for the correction.  I ate it and did not get even an apology when I told them.  (They were willing to take it back.) I found the restaurant far too dark as well.  When providing a spicy dish one should keep the ice water coming-they had trouble keeping the glass full.  Due to the poor service I skipped dessert.  My bill was still mid $20 with tip--for a dish not quite as good as I can get at home for $10.  This place is not meeting its potential.",

    "text": "Decent restaurant serving Thai and Vietnamese dishes.  The menu has broad selection of noodles, soups, rice dishes, curries, and pho.  You can choose from chicken, beef, tofu, and shrimp with the various noodle and rice selections.   We had lunch and was seated next to a nice indoor lotus pond with a stone Buddha and paper lanterns hanging from the ceiling.  Wife ordered the chicken pineapple fried rice, which was cooked well and had decent \"wok breath.\"  I liked it more than she did.  The rice wasn't dry at all and I liked the saute cashews, scallions, eggs, and pineapple chunks that gave acidity to balance the savory.  I ordered the spicy SEA noodles, which came as a pile of wide rice noodles mixed with shrimp, tofu, bean sprouts  and squid.  It was surrounded by a pool of dark soy sauce with a vinegary aftertaste, similar to tamarind.  The flavors were bold, but the sauce overwhelmed slightly. I probably should have gotten the Drunken noodles or spicy seafood soup noodles.  Still, good place to grab lunch in a dark intimate setting.  Good service too.  Just watch out for over-sauced dishes.",

The decor is pretty and relaxing and the seats by the pond are really nice. It was quite beautiful until straw wrappers started floating by. We got the honey walnut shrimp appetizer and all I can say is it defiantly was not honey walnut shrimp. It was something spicy and terrible. Both of our meals weren't any good and the server was extremely slow. We had to get other servers to help at times. I got a Thai Iced Tea that was disgusting. I took one sip of it and left it sitting on the table. The server never asked about it just sitting there. Our bill was well over $100 and we walked away hungry and disappointed. Get off the strip and don't go here. Total letdown. One star for decor.",

We expected a wait at the door, given the weekend of the CES conference and that's what we got (despite being near 9pm). But after maybe 20 minutes we were seated next to the pond inside, which was nice.  Unfortunately, our waitress seemed disinterested in us, instead paying more attention to other tables while taking our orders. We later had our food come out (bit of a delay, but again expected) but delivered without cutlery, so we had to sit and look at our food until we could finally grab one of the waitstaffs attention to provide us with cutlery.  After we had finished our mains and asked for the check, we again waited another 15 minutes for it to be delivered - at this point the restaurant was barely half full.  It redeemed itself with the food, otherwise the experience wasn't great, especially considering the price.",

We called and tried several restaurants on a friday night and were basically shut out at the eleven-thirty ish hour. When SEA answered and sounded delighted to have us come, we were more than pleasantly surprised.  Patty, our server, was kind and friendly and sold the mad russian on a special saki that they had at discount and actually dissuading her from heating it up. This one she said was best served cold. Bonus points added. Nothing special about the beers my sister and I had, but we really enjoyed the pond side seating we had with the floating lotus flowers. What we had: Crab Rangoon Fritters Golden Crab Roll Crazy Pad Thai Scallop Stir Fry All of the food was very good and we enjoyed a great meal so late at night. As far as we could tell, they made no short cuts on food or service. Well done!",

Never have we ever paid 80 dollars for 2 entrees and an appetizer at a Thai food place.  With no drinks !!  I understand that it is vegas and that it is in Bally's which can explain the price. The fritters were very good. However, I absolutely hated my entree. I ordered the pineapple/ginger sauteed chicken dish. It did not come with rice, rice was a extra charge (which is a 1st for us). I couldn't enjoy the dish because the taste of ginger was sooooo overwhelming. I didn't want to bother attempting to order something else so I literally just picked at it.  The 2 entrees and appetizer came up to 70 dollars which was Just insane to me. Add in tip for a meal that I didn't enjoy 80 bucks. We have a sea Thai nyc in Brooklyn. I thought it would have been similar or affiliated , but I don't think it is.",

    "text": "On our third day in Paradise, Cary was craving thai food and found SEA through yelp. The restaurant is really pretty inside and we got to sit in the area of the fountain and the statue. We had ordered calamari to start and the pad kei mao (drunken noodles) and the herb fried rice for the entrees. THe food was really good but because it is Vegas, I think they really lacked out on the heat. When I asked how spicy the food will be, I heard \"oh really spicy!\" We ordered both entrees with 4 stars because we didn't want to be idiots and order it too spicy if it's already \"really spicy.\" Like I said, the food was good but the heat wasn't there and the price is ridiculous! 18 bucks for a plate that I know I can get for half the price somewhere else.....   The service was alright, not the best. I had ordered a thai tea upon sitting at our table and NEVER got it. We had to ask for water and out waiter never came around to our table after we had ordered our food. The place was packed but it wasn't busy since I can see the buss boy and waiters and waitresses standing around chatting. The noise level  here is pretty loud considering that the restaurant is right next to the lounge area in Bally where they have a stage for performances, singing and dancing. I think I will try to find another thai restaurant that's cheaper, more attentative, and have heat the next time I'm in Vegas.",

Although there was plenty of shrimp on it, they were all butterflied, and nothing was over cooked. I suppose it was just that explosion of flavor that I love from Thai food that was missing.

The vietnamese spring rolls are also some of the best I've had.  Only disappointment was the pad thai which was swimming in too much sweet sauce.  But the prices more than make up for the one dish not too our liking.  The dishes are reasonably priced by Vegas Strip standards.  We ordered 2 dishes, an appetizer and a bottle of Sonoma Cutrer and the bill was under $100.  The ambience is cool with comfortable wooden booths next to a water pond. The service is exceptional  When the word gets out about this restaurant, it will be crowded because there aren't a ton of tables.

    "text": "This place is a hidden jewel in the mess of Sin City. Definitely a welcome change from the heat of the weather, noisy beeps of slot machines, and the omnipresent chaos of obnoxious young people. (I'm not going to apologize for what I just said, so deal with it. I will, however, apologize for the obnoxiously rude and annoying ways of my generation which I am regretfully a part of.) On with the review....  Tranquil, quiet, serene. Almost felt like I was stepping into a spa. The decor was lovely. There is a wooden seating area (I don't think it was bamboo) surrounding the fountain, where a large buddha figure greets you at the head. The whole ambience was very relaxing. Definitely something I haven't experienced in Vegas before.   The food is delicious! We ordered Vietnamese vermicelli bowls, pad thai, green curry (the rice came in a cute little pyramid shape!), and one other scrumptious dish that I can't remember. Probably some variation of fried rice. In any case, all were excellent and robust in flavors. Our waiter was shy and quiet, but very polite and helpful. I think anything we ordered here would have been just as tasty.   Definitely coming back here again. I especially like that it was open at an odd hour of the day when most restaurants take their siestas (i.e., 3PM) so we didn't have to wait in starvation after hours of working at trade shows. I don't know how they did it, but they really brought some classiness and elegance into Vegas. Thank you, thank you.  .",

    "text": "Sea Thai is hidden away in a nook between a Margarita joint and yet another steakhouse in Paris, right by the hallway when you come through when you walk over from Bally's.   The atmosphere and service were both just a pleasure. Seating surrounds a rectangular pool with a large statue of the Compassionate Buddha, with a screen behind it with a lotus flower graphic on it. Lighting is dim, tasteful and the atmosphere is contributed to by candlelit wall sconces.   Unique wooden tables for 2 surround the pool, with more traditional seating along the walls.  We especially appreciated, being Vegetarian, that every meal had a tofu option. In Vegas, that's a rarity!  The only thing that kept this from a 5 star for me was that the food didn't actually taste Thai! I just assume that they removed the spice form the recipe to cater to the generic palate's of the average visitor. Don't get me wrong though, the food was very good and I'd go again...I'll just remember to ask for spicy next time!",

You shouldn't have to ask.  However, the spicy soba noodles were FANTASTIC!  Staff is nice but they all wear walkie talkies which completely ruins the ambience.",
