    "text": "This small ( 4 table) yet quaint restaurant is situated in a small plaza on the corner of Silverado/Eastern.  It is embedded in between Yummy Sushi Grill and Windy City Beefs and Pizza.  It's a great addition to the center as it is not your typical Mexican Food Restaurant.  It is a family owned business and the husband and wife team are very modest and friendly.  You can tell their mission is to showcase their native food from their city of Puebla.    Our menu consisted of the following:  **Molletes: A split hoagie topped with beans, mozzarella cheese and lots of pico de gallo (chopped tomato, onion and chilies) added after the sandwich is grilled in the oven so the cheese can melt.  Unfortunately, our son is quite picky so he had his with just the beans and cheese...let's just say he licked his plate clean!  Chicken Enchilada Mole:  This is definitely not your average enchilada as it is dressed in a chocolate-rich mole sauce.  Not my favorite but could be YOURS!  **Pelonas: 2 sliders filled with marinated shredded beef fried with a smear of refried beans dressed with sour cream and salsa.  The description sounds nothing extravagant but believe me it will leave you wanting to order more...which we did ofcourse.  Chanclas, slider-sized bolillo rolls filled with shredded chicken and avocado and drizzled with a chorizo-infused sauce...this is definitely worth the mess or a knife and fork will do too.  Like I said earlier on my tip: you may want to look at the menu completely before ordering the tapas like dishes.  On our first visit, we started with one dish, then had to try another, and couldn't leave until we tried one more item!  Finally my husband and I agreed to return on another day as to not explode with all the yummy goodness.  I have a feeling this place won't be here too long (in a good way) as they will need a bigger brick and mortar to accommodate their Foodie Fans!",

The menu is very limited but it seems like everything on it is delicious and done very well! They offer plates that are very difficult to find at a \"fast food\" Mexican restaurant - or really ANY typical Mexican restaurant. Very authentic.   The place is small, but clean. It is clear that the owner really cares about presentation - not just of the restaurant but of the plates as well.   The mole poblano is DELICIOUS and very authentic. Very very close to the mole my abuela and suegra make. The torta de pierna was also perfect!  When the plates came out my husband and I thought it wouldn't be enough food. As it turns out the serving size was perfect. We were satisfied but not overstuffed.   I'm definitely looking forward to returning to this place many more times to try everything else on the menu.",

    "text": "I have heard nothing but great things about Las Cazuelas.  So, we decided to give it a try for lunch.  The employees were very friendly.  After ordering, we were brought chips and salsa very quickly.  The salsa was extremely watery, which I don't care for.  The flavor was okay, not great, but I've certainly had worse.  I had the chicken verde enchiladas, the wife had the quesadilla arabe, which is filled with cheese, pork and chipotle sauce.  We also tried the beans, mini molletes, and esquites.  My favorites were the enchiladas and molletes.  The molletes are sort of a Mexican bruschetta, refried beans, pico, and cheese spread over soft bread.  I loved the pico, I think next time I go to Las Cazuelas I'll ask for that instead of salsa.  The enchiladas were simple, just shredded chicken topped with cheese and lots of verde sauce.  I really liked the sauce, which made the dish.    The beans were basic.  The esquites, or warm corn salad, was okay.  I didn't get any lime or spices, pretty much hot mayo, cheese and corn.  The quesadilla was cheesy, but it didn't have much meat.  I don't know if this is how they serve them or if we just got a sparsely filled quesadilla.  Everyone is loving this place and it's getting great write ups in local magazines.  So, it's likely that we ordered the wrong stuff (clearly should have tried a mole dish).  I'll return and give some other menu items a shot.",

The waiter (which is also the owner) didn't greet us, never refilled our drinks, walked away right when my friend was about to order. I mean I was shocked. We were the only ones in there and it took about 20 minutes after we were done eating to finally let us know that we pay at the front. The owner ignored us every time we tried asking for something, literally at every given request. Then towards the end we wanted to mention that he could have been nicer and needed to improve on the service and some lady that claims to be his family member started screaming at us and cursing at us to get out if we didn't like the food. I attempted at managing to explain that the food was delicious , we were simply trying to help him improve with the service because we weren't happy. This unknown family member proceeded to yell at us for having a very liberated opinion, which I believe any customer should be entitled to, and swore at us. I went on to explain to his family member that we owned a business and if a customer wasn't happy with our service, we would apologize and ask how we could improve. She said she didn't care and actually got into my sister's face as if she was going to assault her. I threatened to call the police. The owner apologized on her behalf. We stormed off.  I was completely shocked. They acted like animals and treated us like dirt for simply being dissatisfied with horrible service! We walked out of the restaurant completely ruffled and astonished. I have never in my life experienced ridiculousness like this. This place is a zoo! NEVER again.",

If no one told you, you wouldn't even know it is in the target shopping center, by \"nothing bundt cakes\". If your looking for great tacos, this in my opinion is not the place. But we all have our own liking. .....its always service with a smile by the owner",

For some, mole might be a little weird tasting at first, but after another couple of bites, you are literally addicted.  The corn Elote (served on the cob) or Esquites (taken off the cob) is so delish.  Don't forget the freshly made Churros that have a sweet cream flavored filling and served with a side of whipped cream and chocolate sauce.  We took our grown kids and their kids and now they are in love, also.  The recipes and the owners are originally from the Pueblo region of Mexico.  Everything is so fresh and simply served on beautiful silver plates and bowls.  The owners are extremely gracious and pleasant and the restaurant is clean and inviting.  They are closed on Wednesdays but open for lunch and dinner every other day.",

I had the Chanclas which was authentic and awesome and we had the Taco Arabe, both filling and both authentic.  The chips and salsa they serve is some of the best I have had in a long time.    This place sits in the corner of this shopping center near Office Depot and a place EVERYONE needs to visit if you want real authentic food.

I had to drop in to try some real mexican food as not doing so while being this close to the border with our Mexican friends would be like eating at Taco Bell in El, Paso, Texas. I digress.  I had the quesadilla and that chorizo mexican sausage was good. The prices are decent even though for a few dollars more you could get alot more food elsewhere. But rarely do I want quantity over quality with food (even with buffets). The quality here was very good. The chorizo was tasty and the pico sauce was super fresh. I may never get to Mexico, but this was very decent. I laughed as I saw the windy city restaurant next door as I have eaten a lot of Italian Beef in Chicagoland in the past and wasn't ready to see that in Vegas.  Try this place, I think you will enjoy it...it is not TexMex or fast food Mexican Food. I believe it is more real than at least half of mexican restaurant food served in the usa.

    "text": "Owned by a husband and wife team, this place has what it takes to really become a great spot for traditional street-style Mexican tacos and other native Mexican cuisine.   Favorites on the menu are the Taco Oriental and side of guacamole.   The Taco Oriental are these tiny tacos on corn tortillas with seasoned, diced pork.  They come plain and wrapped tightly.   If this is all you get, get 6.  If you get guacamole and chips & salsa to go with, I recommend 3-4 Taco Orientals.   Guacamole is super fresh.  This is NOT fast food.  If you stop in, prepare to wait.  It is worth it, the food is made fresh.  I am not sure the tortillas are made fresh.   Which I find somewhat disappointing since this is such an easy thing to make fresh.  I need to confirm this.   The decor is also noteworthy.  Its this fusion of Mexican and Native American with a modern, clean look.  For a strip mall, it's refreshing.  I loved the decor so much I thought perhaps I might want something similar in my home kitchen.  When I asked, the owner told me his wife did the decor.  How impressive!   She was also cooking.  So I will let her be for now.  Ha.   He did lose the music: said he did not know he would have to pay royalties/fee to play music, so he has a TV now.  So there is some entertainment.  But no music is a downer to some degree.    I always get \"to go\" here now, but there is a quaint seating area and I have dined here with my toddler before and the service is great.",

    "text": "Seems like I've had these guys bookmarked for a while now. When my buddy Bronsen K. asked me to look up a place in the Eastern and Silverado Ranch area for lunch, Las Cazuelas was almost a no-brainer.  They managed to be a hole in the wall in spite of being in a huge plaza. Proof? I somehow didn't even remember them even though I was at Windy City Beefs a few months ago. Luckily, they are on right on top of that signpost near the Eastern Ave entrance.  After some brief discussion, Bronsen and I decided to split some Enchiladas de Mole Poblano and Enchiladas de Salsa Verde (both items $7.00 for 4). Both are based on shredded chicken inside corn tortillas, but aside from the obvious sauce differences, the Mole Poblano enchiladas had cotija cheese, a couple rings of raw white onion, and roasted sesame seeds, while the Salsa Verde had cream and melted mozzarella.  I must confess that I have never had mole before. The rich chocolate-based yet savory sauce was relatively mild in spice, which was totally fine with me. The tomatillo green sauce on the other enchiladas was vibrant and perhaps a bit more spicy, and it felt entirely different even though it was chicken and corn flour underneath both. I really enjoyed both orders and was glad to have the experience.  We also received some complimentary tortilla chips with a more medium-level red salsa to start. No complaints there. However, I had an extra Taco Oriental ($1.50) that  I could've done without. Pork, onions, parsley on corn tortilla, but nothing special compared to other taco places around town.  I probably could've used another item or a larger portion to get full, but maybe I'm too picky about that sort of thing. I am certainly looking to try a lot of the other items on their menu, since the enchiladas at Las Cazuelas were so great to me.",

Personally I'm not a fan of their Mole enchiladas, but my girlfriend and her dad love them. I think their Verde enchiladas are much better but that's just my two cents. I haven't had a bad experience here, and I've tried most of the menus. The tortas, enchiladas, tacos, and everything are very good. Their molletes are probably one of my favorite things on the planet. Also their pico de gallo is the best ever had.   On the flip side, their dining room is very small, and sometimes you don't get a seat right away or you have to go somewhere else. Some people see the owners as cold ( I don't personally) but they are genuinely lovely people that make excellent food.   10/10 Buckets of Popcorn.",

The salsa verde is excellent. My husband had the chicken enchilada verde, all white chicken wrapped in fresh soft tortillas and topped with green sauce and creama. Need to go back soon to have them again.. they are that good.  One daughter had the carne asada tacos which were delicious and the other daughter had taquitos that were homemade and tasted great.  I enjoyed the Mexican corn on the cob, a must try if you have never had it. I also had a small shredded beef sandwich, Polonas .  For dessert, the flan which was rich, creamy and lots of flavor and an order of churros which were filled with caramel sauce..  Everything was spot on, and I can't wait to return!

This is my new go to place, i tried the chicken & potato flautas,esquites,asada sopes, chicken taco,asada taco, & green sauce enchiladas everything was good. The flavor on the asada is really good. I would definitely eat everything again but i think my favorite was the asada sopes",

    "text": "Due to the great reviews, we opted to check out this place for our Friday night dinner.  The place was small and indeed a hole in the wall restaurant. It is clean but quite small place.  We ordered 2 enchiladas in chili verde sauce and 2 enchiladas in mole sauce ($10), pozole ($8), Carne Asada torta w/ fries ($7 + $1.50 for fries), Arabe Quesadilla ($5.50) & Esquites ($3.50) for party of 4.  Here are our comments on the food we ordered:  1) Enchiladas in Chili Verde - This one is awesome! The chicken is flavorful and the green sauce is excellent with great kick.. not too spicy but just right. We all loved this one! 2) Enchiladas in Mole sauce - I thought this one was great too. The hint of sweetness with the combination of different spices sure made the enchilada great. My son and I loved it but my husband is not a fan. 3) Pozole - This is good as well but wouldn't say it's the best I've had. I did enjoy the flavor of the broth but wasn't a big fan of the chicken because it was a little tough and dry. 4) Carne Asada Torta - My husband did not like this one at all. He said it was bland and the meat was dry and no flavor... will not be ordering this for sure in the future. 5) Quesadilla Arabe - Both my son and husband thinks this was bland as well. Nothing special and will not be ordering this in the future as well. 6) Esquites - Elote in a cup.. this was alright.  I was a little disappointed on this as I was really hoping that this will be good coz I love elote. The lime and cotija cheese was overpowering everything.  I can't barely taste the corn and the mayo due to the sour taste from the lime and salty taste of the cotija cheese.  I will not be ordering this again.  Overall, this was not a bad place if you are craving for a good enchilada and not feeling Roberto's or Don Tortaco. I do feel that given the average size servings, this place is a little too expensive for me. We won't be frequenting this place.",

I recommend the Chile en Nogada, the enmoladas (enchilada with mole), the sopes with carne asada, the Pelonas, the Cochinita Pibil tacos, everything is so delicious , the owner is always there and he is very attentive.

I digress...  From our viewpoint, looks like this joint is ran by a husband and wife team.  The husband mans the cashier and front end and the wife is cooking in the kitchen.    Come for the fresh chips and salsa- great amounts of chili and flavor packed in this salsa mixture. The street tacos are awesome here and I appreciate the little side fixings and large slices of lime that goes with the choice mix and match a la carte or combo meal.  The pickled red onions and by request their chile verde is the bomb here.    The restaurant can be awkwardly quiet, so maybe a little soft tune can go a long way for this business.",

The rice was typical Mexican rice with carrots & peas, not very memorable and the beans really weren't my cup of tea even if I did get past the grayish color ~     I was sorry I didn't enjoy this more as I really like to support small family owned businesses however I can't imagine I will be going back, adios.",

    "text": "Thanks to several recent Yelp reviews showing the mole enchiladas I had to try this place! Las Cazuelas is located in the Target shopping center right next to Windy city beef & pizza. It is quite small inside with only 4 tables but there is outdoor seating as well.   We were greeted by the owner as soon as we walked in. You can either order right at the counter or sit at one of the tables and peruse the menu. I knew I wanted the enchiladas de mole poblano so I ordered at the counter. I also had to try the churros stuffed with sweet condensed milk (purely for my review of course!). You can order 2 or 4 enchiladas for $7. If you order two it comes with rice and beans which I opted for.   There was one table open and I was served chips and salsa as soon as I sat down. The salsa was excellent, just the right amount of heat for me. Within a few minutes my enchiladas arrived. The two enchiladas were on the small side but the mole sauce was absolutely delicious, just the right amount of sweet chocolate and spices. The shredded chicken was also moist and tender and the rice and beans were standard mexican sides.   The chips and salsa were quickly replenished without asking. Just as I was finished with the enchiladas the churros arrived. The order is 4 small churros served with whipped cream and chocolate sauce. They were hot and covered in cinnamon sugar. The filling was okay, but they would have been fine without it.   Overall I really enjoyed Las Cazuelas. The owner provided excellent service from beginning to end making sure we were happy. Although the enchiladas were a litte on the small side they were very good and priced fairly. Definately somewhere I will return to.",

The restaurant was small and it was very warm inside. Food is overpriced imo. Service was adequate which is why I gave two stars.",

I had chicken enchiladas de salsa verde and my husband had the taco oriental & chanclas (sliced bread rolls, stuffed with shredded chicken, avocado, onion, drizzled with chorizo sauce).  This was fun to try something new and the menu items are unique.  Everything was delicious and they serve complimentary chips and salsa.

    "text": "It's still just a few months old and more people need to find this place.  After seeing the great reviews (and being disappointed at the lack of decent Mexican food in our neck of the woods), we were disappointed to walk in on Saturday evening and find the place empty.  Fortunately, it wasn't a reflection of there being anything wrong with the place.  Quite the opposite!  I can't vouch for the other things on the menu, which all look good, but our chicken mole enchiladas and enchiladas verdes were excellent (and made with white-meat chicken) as were our appetizer (bread with mozzarella and fresh pico de gallo) and our desserts (one of the corn-based options and the gelatin dessert).  Sorry, no menu in front of me and I can't recall any of the names.  I have never seen either of the two desserts on menus before but they were both very good and only mildly sweet, which is so different (and a pleasant surprise) compared with what we usually eat in the US.  Oh, the chips and salsa were also great.  As others mentioned, the menu is limited and this is the one thing that might prevent their getting a lot of business right now, but I look forward to the day when enough of us support them that they can move to a bigger location, hire staff, and expand their menu.  Of course, I don't know if that's their plan, but I hope so!  Also of note - portions aren't large but that lets you sample desserts at the end and still have spent very little money.  Prices are very reasonable.  They might want to try for more take-out business by adding more things to the menu that could be eaten by hand (or in the car).  The decor is very attractive and has a lot of character, definitely more like a sit-down restaurant than a fast-food place.  It's very clean.   There was nice Mexican music (no TV, thank goodness).  Although they used plastic utensils, our food was all served on those cute metal plates and bowls like you see in Indian restaurants.  This isn't a kids-type fast-food joint but more of a sophisticated adult one.    We will be back!",

The mole sauce was terrific as was the fresh corn. Between the four of us we tried nearly everything on the menu. And the bill total was only $65.00 for four people. Very reasonable!  Great food, great service, small but mighty good little restaurant!",

    "text": "I enjoyed everything about this place.  I loved the review from Shirley B and it was a place not to miss.  My wife wanted to try some Mexican Food and of course, I was looking for something very authentic... Glad to have found this place!  a.  Ambiance - 5 Star - Ok, perhaps this may make you think too much, but this place is very basic, very simple and has 4 tables with 4 chairs each.  So approximately 16 people max.  There is nothing very special about this place or decor, but you know what it was simple yet just right for my expectations. Basic is often very good.  b.  Menu - 4 star - The menu is also very basic and if these dishes are available at other Mexican Eateries, I have not seen most of them.  The menu has a limited choice of such foods as Enchiladas, Chanclas, two types of tacos, frijoles, Molletes, Huevos Rancheros and some other choices...  c.  The food - 4 star - As I wanted to go authentic, the most authentic dish that I personally like is Caldo de Res, which I have found only in a few restaurants. This is a beef bone soup with vegetables.  So, when I meant authentic, I meant not tacos, burritos, tamales, and fajitas....  So we ordered:  Enchiladas de Mole Poblano - Chicken in a corn tortilla with the mole sauce. Enchiladas de Salsa Verde - Chicken in  a corn tortilla with the green sauce. Chanclas - bread with chicken, avocado and onions with a chorizo sauce. Molletes - bread with refried beans, cheese, pico de gallo  I enjoyed the verde, the chancels and the molletes very much.  Since I am not a huge fan of Mole Poblano, I have to say that it was good, just not something I would personally order.  The enchilada was great though.  The chicken very tender!  d.  The price - all very reasonable!  e.  The service - Excellent small family style.  GK says to check this place out for some really good stuff.  My next visit will be the frijoles, and the esquires!",

If not for my 1st visit where I had the mole enchiladas I would have given this place a 1. The service is good and they are honest about wait times if busy. Chicken tacos looked like the chicken was from the frozen Tyson chicken you buy at the store. Carnitas were dry and Carne asada had zero flavor. The tortillas are are a bit large but still tasty. Basically the meat is pre cooked and rerigerated. Chile rellenos was also delicious so bottom line come here for authentic mexican dishes except tacos.",

When we were done with our food, he let us know we didn't have to clean, thanked us, and even the lady in the kitchen thanked us, lol.   We ordered 2 elotes, one in a bowl and one on the cob. While we waited, he started us off with some chips and salsa; very addicting! I am so glad I found out about this place, because I would previously drive so far for non-authentic, over-priced elote. The way they prepare their's is perfect! They are very generous with the spread, and they give you a chili shaker so you could add spice to your liking.   Was not expecting much from such a small, random restaurant that I found on Yelp. Will be back to try more food, possibly will be the first place I rate 5 stars.",

    "text": "Quick Tip: It not an expensive place but it's clean and prices are really good. Also, you get complimentary chips and salsa if u r dinning in.  Restaurant is located right across from target. Its got many other restaurants in the vicinity including a hot dog joint and a boba tea place. It's a competitive area for a restaurant. However, what sets this place apart from others is the authenticity of the food. Mexican food in Henderson is easy to find; Robertos, Lindo Michocan, etc., but the taste of the food items in this place is exquisite.   My favorite dish at this restaurant is Chicken Mole Enchiladas ($7). The mole sauce is rich and flavorful and enchiladas are in the league of their own. The meat is tender and has the right amount of spices. I could eat two plates of this because of the sauce. Chanclas; which is more like a french dip with avocado and shreaded chicken and its drenched in spicy sauce. Its wasn't my favorite, because the sauce didn't have much flavor to it. Complimentary, chips and salsa is good but salsa did have a lot of salt in it.   Overall, this is an excellent place for cheap-authentic mexican food. I would highly recommend  you to checkout this location.  Mole chicken enchilada's are to die for.",

The aroma and the flavors will make a fantastic memory for you and/or your date/family.   The pickled onions are really something. I dare you to try them. (heat index is high) A unique flavor that will make the pork tacos a real treat.   The chips and salsa are a simple food, however they tend to either bring people back to a restaurant or leave them wanting. The chips and salsa here will bring you back over and over again. (excellent flavor in the salsa)   The best part about this little secret in Henderson, is the family that operates the business.

This place is in the corner of Silverado and Eastern and it has only been opened for eight months. I am going to really try to get this place some business because they were just phenomenal. I remembered seeing them in the Seven Magazine, but forgot about that for awhile until be stumbled upon it one evening. It was empty, but it was also almost 8pm so we were like the last customers before closing. They still were very kind from the time we ordered to the time we left.   Like most places they served the chips and salsa while waiting for our food. The salsa was delicious. It was not chunky, which was great for me and it had this new taste that I cannot really describe. Thank goodness it was not too spicy either, just enough to make it heighten the taste buds. My friends also ordered guacamole, but I did not try it because I do not like my guacamole with tomato and onions in it, however, they said it was good.    Next was our meal. They served us with these dishes that were so unique. It was a silver plate with little hold crested handles. It almost felt like medieval Spain ware or something. I am not good with eras, but I am just trying to get if you all a good picture of how cool it was.   So I ordered the verde enchiladas and they were amazing. I usually only ever have two enchiladas wherever I go because they are so filling, but this dish comes with four and I was at the point where you know your full, but your not dying with the overeating bloating feeling. It was just perfect. I also had a side of their rice , which is what I judge most Mexican places by, and even that was delicious; light and fluffy. I was completely in love with my entire meal.   My friends tried the mole, which is what Seven magazine wrote about. If mole is something you like, then apparently it was really really good. I tried it, but it taste like chocolate and coffee to me which is not something that goes well with my taste buds. However, every other bite my friend was just in awe of how good it was. We all ordered something that hit the spot for the night of Mexican good cravings and we thank Las Cazuelas for providing us with the craving satisfaction and a good experience. We will be back soon I am sure!!",

The storefront is unremarkable, and while not uninviting there is very little to compel you to visit.  After some discussion, we decided to try based on our previous statements and the fact it is nearby and some Mexican food that is more \"home cooked\" would be welcome.  From the time we entered we were welcomed warmly, and I'm assuming the owner talked with us and helped us choose our dishes.  We ordered 6 dishes between 6 people (2 kids) and the food was delivered very quickly. While we waited, we had ample chips and salsa. The salsa was interesting, very atypical. It had a jellied quality to it that I really liked. It wasn't so spicy, one of our kids was happy eating it.  The rest of our lunch was fantastic. Very light flavors, the food itself wasn't so heavy which is unusual with a lot of Mexican dishes. I can see people being disappointed if they are expecting saturated flavors.  Great service, great food, not a 5-star establishment just because of location and ambience. It's hard to get excited when you're in a Target parking lot.",

After waiting awhile we were just preparing to depart when the owner arrived and asked us to give him 15 minutes.   On entry we were provided menus, glasses of water, and salsa and chips.  I noticed on the menu that the tacos included parsley versus the standard cilantro.  The owner explained that this was the authentic preparation in Puebla.  We each ordered huevos rancheros which were very high quality and delicious.  I also mentioned that we would come back some time to try the mole and he offered a sample but I did not want to hang around waiting for it to be reheated.",

My personal favorietes: I order the esquites and eat them with chips(looks small, but fills you up quick!), quesadilla arabe is solid if you want simple and awesome combined, pelonas, molletes, enchilladas de salsa verde and the steak tacos are great. You may notice that the portions are not overwhelming.......that's OK, because the amount of care in preparing these dishes and the taste are both overwhelming and thoroughly satisfying. If you are a big eater, typically two dishes will do the trick.   I urge anyone trying this place to try different things as the owner is constantly adding new items and I am thoroughly impressed each time I try something new.  Tip: if you have picky kids(I do!) the owner will make specialty sandwiches with what the kids like. I think they should try to drum up a kids menu, but know they are flexible with accommodating children.",

We then decided it was too hot and came back inside - without skipping a beat, or being upset, the same gentleman gave us the same great service.   The dining area was gorgeous - quaint and authentic. A few pictures on the wall of what was on the menu really goes a long way.   The food - INCREDIBLE! I have to recommend the chicken enchiladas with green sauce. Oh my gosh the BEST Green Tomatillo sauce I have EVER had. And half of my family, is Mexican! I saw so many other items on the menu that I wanted to try - which is unusual for me. I usually find one thing I like and stick with it every time I go to a restaurant. But here, I'm excited to try more! I know it's amazing when I am craving the same dish the next day.   Oh and by the way --- the salsa with the chips they bring you first thing is absolutely delicious. Perfect amount of spicy and savory. So good. I would buy this stuff just to have it at home whenever I wanted!   I only have one critique...and this may be a non - issue because I didn't ask too many questions. The majority of the menu seems to be focused around chicken. I cant imagine having a shredded beef enchilada with that same sauce, or even a pork enchilada...They may have more options though - you will have to ask, and so will I when I go in again...This weekend! :D",

This place has gotten a lot of great reviews, in fact so many good reviews that, that is what brought us here.    The place itself is small and not good for larger groups. The service was good. We ordered red sauce enchiladas, verde enchiladas, tortas, and a quesadilla. the food was tasty, nothing that stood out that was better than other places. We sampled the molle sauce and it was pretty darn good.  Here is my issue with the place; the portion sizes are lacking. Everything is about half the size of what you would get at other Mexican establishments for the same price. It's as if the dining-ware they purchased was from a misses cook set from Matel. Everyone left still somewhat hungry. Even the chips and salsa were small, I think they were single portions but we shared them among 5 of us.  If I'm going to leave a Mexican joint I wan to leave fat and happy.",

As someone who doesn't eat a lot of Central American food, LC has earned a place in my regular rotation when I am on this side of town!    Don't let the modest atmosphere of the restaurant fool you, the food quality here is just about as gourmet as it gets.  I've heard to referred to as Pueblan food more so than Mexican.  I must admit that I am ignorant in this area, but I can tell you this is not your typical Mexican food.    I highly recommend trying the enchiladas with the mole sauce.  This sauce is homemade with a delicious non-sweet chocolate flavor.  I crave it.  The verdes sauce is also excellent.  The new churros are the best I've ever had; custard filled with a homemade sweet chocolate sauce that will blow you mind!  This place is an absolute must try if you live in the area.  I guarantee you will not be disappointed!",

I know Tex-Mex from New Mexican and Tijuanan-Border from Baja-Californian.  This is the best regional Mexican food I've experienced in 25 years living in LV. The mole poblano is benchmark, if not acme, and I haven't had anything on the menu that disappointed. The corn is can't-miss, and the enchiladas verdes are as benchmark as the mole. The passion for food in their kitchen and their ability to execute it far out-matches their humble location and lack of serious accompanying beverage (enjoy the frugality of BYOB here while it lasts). The serving dishes and plating reflect their passion and far exceed expectations.  This might be the Mexican equivalent of Lotus of Siam...",

I had the Chanclas- shredded marinated chicken on boletto buns with fresh sliced avocado and onion in a charro broth. DELISH!  My husband had the Huevos Rancheros and a Taco Oriental. He claimed his meal was heavenly and was so good that he ate it up, before I got a chance to have a taste!  They give you free chips and salsa, if you dine in. The salsa was GREAT! Not too spicy and very refreshing.   Then the owner let us sample the Flan for dessert. My goodness! It was like I stepped back into my grandmother's kitchen.

In general, I've hated every mole I've tasted, but the Enchiladas De Mole Poblano was spot on!  I'm looking forward to eating my way through this menu.",

The owners are always very friendly and attentive. I've tried only a few dishes and some desserts, and all of them are delicious. The mole is so rich in flavor, the best I've had in my life. The chanclas are some sort of sandwich stuffed with chicken and a sauce on it made out of chorizo and other ingredients, it's so delicious. I am glad we have this restaurant in the neighborhood. I'm ready to try all of their dishes. If you like to eat TexMex don't even bother to come here, they only have delicious authentic cuisine from the Central part of Mexico.",

You should definitely try this place and get something with pork. The frijoles charros were also delicious! I will definitely come back!",

We felt as though he really did not want us there. We never felt welcomed. Very uncomfortable, to say the least.  We asked for an horchata and two waters. We received two very small waters in Styrofoam cups and an horchata that was not even full. Nothing was ever refilled during our stay. I gave my water to my husband since he drinks a lot more than I do. With the water, chips and salsa were brought to us. The chips were hardy, and the salsa was very flavorful. Nice and spicy.  When the food arrived, we knew where the real magic was being done here. The food looked great. We got the 4 chicken enchiladas verdes, and two carne asada tacos a la carte. These were only $3. There was so much meat in everything, and the food was fantastic. There was so much depth of flavor in the salsa verde. It had a strong lime flavor. I loved it.  It would have been nice if our guy had had back to check on us, but he never did until the end when we had stacked our plates as we typically do.   He never said anything, so we walked to the front counter, and he was already ringing up our order. Too weird. Not a word to meet us up there, or give us our ticket...nothing. We will definitely come back for the very flavorful food, and hopefully next time someone else will wait on our table. Someone with a personality.",

There is seating available if you want to dine inside. A gentleman (maybe the owner?) asked if I was ready to order. I had an idea of what I wanted, but went with some fried mini pork appetizers. There were some people dining there and they thanked the gentleman for a delicious meal. That's good to hear. The lounge seat I was sitting at kind of sank down, but maybe that's cause many people have sat there before? Either way, the food came out about 5-8 minutes later. As I grabbed my bag to go, the gentleman asked if I have been there before. I said no and he proceeded to make conversation and said to come back soon. He was actually very nice, so if he seems quiet at first,  I would say not to take it personal.   The pork appetizer was delicious! There was only 2, so I wish there was more for the price, maybe one more? It also came with a salsa verde which had a good kick to it. The mayo was good with the salsa as well. The bread was a fried bread of sorts and the meat was very tender. It's not super cheap food like Roberto's and it's not a fancy spot either. It is home style cooking, so someone is actually making your food to order. I would definitely come back to try their other items though.",

Bomb Bomb Bomb and that's saying a lot I'm Mexican ... the only reason I give this place a 4.5 stars and not 10 stars  is because I really don't know why owner does not understand that they need another face of the restaurant... I have to be honest.. this place would be so successful with a line out the door if they had someone else in the front... the same guy runs the front which I'm pretty sure is the owner... he's efficient to some extent and would be just at as efficient in the back ... but he looks miserable and he's not pleasant   and should be back of house ... sorry not sorry but I've brought plenty of friends here and they all say the same thing...",

    "text": "So I was cruising on Yelp looking for possible Saturday night dine ideas. This place popped up and I was surprised because I frequently come to the Target shopping center and never have seen this place. I read the reviews and my guy and I decided to give it a try. Located in between Yummy Sushi and Windy City pizza, I was so surprised that this place was here and I never saw it.   When we walked in, first impression, tiny place that holds about maybe 20-25 people (5-6 tables) 4 per table. Atmosphere was quiet and peaceful though, very homey feel. It has that restaurant feel with fast food mixed into it. We sat down and we were brought menus.   There is a pretty decent size selection of items to choose from. I personally was torn between the tortas and enchiladas.  Finally went with the La Cazuelas Style Enchiladas with red sauce. They have regular enchiladas with red, mole or green sauce or the La Cazuelas style that comes with sauce, avocados, creme, queso fresco and lettuce. Duh, I loves my avocados and creme is just a must and Queso musto!! (See what I did there??)       **************uncomfortable silence********************** Any-who, my guy got the chilaquiles con pollo.  They also have street style elote on or off the cob.. since I didn't want to fight with my floss as much, I elected to go with off the cob.  After ordering, we were served chips and salsa. Do not be fooled with this salsa. The taste is pretty delicious, great flavor, sweet with a slight kick in the beginning. After a couple chips, the spice goes from 2-9 real quick! My guys is a spice snob, orders level 8 on Thai food and barely breaks a sweat. Even he had his nostrils cleaned out. Good salsa though!  Food took maybe about 10 mins to be cooked and brought out.  Overall the flavor was pretty tasty and enjoyable. Decent portion size.  The corn was on point!  I do apologize for not getting a picture of the chilaquiles but I was starving and went in after taking pics of my food. We both ate up everything though!  This place is definitely a return status and it's awesome because it's right down the street from us.  Overall, this place? Winners!",

It's a little place that has the nice authentic touches of Mexican pottery hanging on the walls. Outside there's a lovely little courtyard with a fountain and misters beneath the canopies so you can walk around after eating.  My daughter ordered an Carne Arabe quesadilla with elote on the side and I got the Mole Chicken Enchiladas. The quesadilla came with a side of chile chipotle which was a nice compliment to it. The food was very tasty and was truly what I imagine Mexican food from Mexico City is all about. I asked the owner where they were from because the Mexican food I'm used to eating and making at home is more Tex-Mex or Cali-style...he told me that they're from Puebla, Mexico about 2 hrs. from Mexico City.   The food was flavorful and yet very light so you don't feel very stuffed afterwards. I knocked off a star because I thought the portions were a little small for the price, but otherwise it was very good. I will return soon if I'm in the area!",

I came in and was greeted but unfortunately there were no tables available inside. The gentleman that was working told us we could pick a table outside and that he would serve us. We ordered at the counter and made our way outside.   We shared the chicken taquitos, enchiladas salsa verde with rice and beans, esquite, and churros. Everything was so good and tasted homemade. The portions were a perfect size for us. The enchiladas were full of chicken and not a bunch of onions and peppers like most places. The taquitos were crunchy and served with a crema and green salsa on the side. The churros were amazing!   Not only is the food excellent but the hospitality was what made me come home and write a review. The gentleman serving us brought us chips and salsa to our table even though we were not dining inside and my son spilled our horchata and when we asked for just a new cup he brought us a brand new and full cup. With good food and service like that to boot I'll definitely be back. Can't wait to try other items on their menu.",

My girlfriend is Mexican/puerto rican so good food is essential, and she knows her Mexican foods! We came here and ordered esquites, she ordered enchiladas with mole and I ordered tacos with this spicy cabbage and I believe pork? It was delicious and super spicy, I was sick so it helped my sinuses lol.  The other few times we've been here, we've ordered the sopes (carne asada and chorizo) super delicious, the flautas (comes with two chicken ones and two potatoes with poblano chiles) again very good, carne asada tacos, rice and beans, elotes and the taquitos!   All the food is very good, I was disappointed to not sopas the other day when I ordered via Postmates, but it happens! The owner is super friendly and nice, his wife is an amazing cook! Delicious and authentic Mexican food, located in the Silverado ranch target area, next to NothinBundt cakes and Yummy Grill sushi!",

The fresh juices are also lovely and the owner gave me a free refill. Needless to say, the hospitality and service were lovely and made me feel very welcome.   Why anyone would pay higher prices to eat at a casino is beyond me when such fantastic food is available at such reasonable prices! I'll definitely be back to try the mole.",

The other plate we ordered was the chicken enchiladas with red sauce with beans and rice. Rice and beans were both bland, and again, needed salt, and the red sauce just had no Latin flavor.....I can't put my finger on what was missing, but it was totally unmemorable.

I'm glad I asked for the sauce on the side since she's only 2 but she liked some of it with her food which was a plus for us.  My husband ordered the cochinitas tacos and he loved them. I think he secretly wanted another order. What was a disappointment was the elote. I expected something like street corn, which it was similar, but it had some spice that I did not like.  Couldn't put my finger on it but nevertheless no one ate it. Overall if I'm back in this area I'll definitely be back to eat here.",

Their salsa is rich and good, but the chips taste bagged--not bad though. Excellent friendly service. Very cool metal plates! Stop in when you're in this part of Vegas. Oh and my meal price? Under $8.00 with no drink.  Also--note that if you're eating in, they have table service with menus.

The place is a hole in the wall---I'm told it is owned and operated by family who do it all (prep, prepare, and serve). Regardless of if that is True, it really shows.   I ordered the chicken chilaquiles---and OMG the chicken was so tender and the green sauce was the perfect spice level. I don't eat beans, so I passed on them and instead got a double order of rice--thankfully I did that because their rice was also amazing. The complimentary chips and salsa were great, too.   I wouldn't say the place is great for a date night of the newly partnered (HA), but for those who have been coupled for a while and just want a great place to eat a home-like meal, go for it! It is family friendly, but do know they have maybe 6-7 tables? I didn't count them, but it's important to keep in mind it is a smaller place.   Food: A+  Service: A+ Value: A --- (prices are similar to its competitors)  Take it from this UNLV Professor, the overall grade A+",

I have always been the biggest fan of Faustos and really still am but now that I know what this place has to offer, Faustos took a hit and really they aren't even comparable.  No Mexican restaurant I have eaten at in Las Vegas/Henderson in comparable.    I am a huge fan of Mexican food in general but I could never really say I've had authentic Mexican in town until now.  They had the usuals like tacos, quesadillas, huevos rancheros, and the like but they also had other options that I have never heard of before such as Chanclas, Pelonas, Huarache, cochinita, orientales, arabe, etc.  My eyes lit up!  Chips and salsa were served first and the salsa was great and had a good amount of spice.  I then ordered four tacos, two carnitas and two I believe al pastor.  Both were delicious.  I also ordered chanclas which were fantastic.   They are rolled bread with shredded chicken, avocado, and a spicy chipotle sauce over the top.  I smiled so much with every bite of food I stuffed into my gullet that day.    The place is small with only about 5 or 6 tables and for how good the food was, I was surprised that it wasn't jam-packed.  Perhaps we came in-between rushes.  I can guarantee you though that I will be back.  This is one of the places that I want to try literally everything on the menu!",

    "text": "We dined in for dinner on Opening Day. It's a quaint, but clean space serving up eats from their native Puebla, Mexico. The menu is pretty simple with a about dozen items to choose from. Don't expect to find burritos, nachos and dishes loaded with cheese and sour cream. Instead, you'll find tacos and tortas with a few fresh ingredients.  We were warmly welcomed; we took a minute to look over the menu and a few suggestions were offered. We ordered Torta De Pierna and Enchiladas de Mole Poblano. We were given free dessert and a fountain drink as a grand opening special. We took a seat and after a short wait, our dinner was delivered.  The Torta ($7) is tender pork in adobo sauce on a crusty roll with beans and topped with avocado. It was a great sandwich only made better with the spicy red sauce that was brought over when we mentioned we loved heat. It was smoky with a nice kick.   Enchiladas de Mole Poblano ($7) is shredded chicken rolled in corn tortillas covered with Mole Poblano and onions. Mole can be wonderful when it's good and downright awful when it's bad. Fortunately, this version was well done and one of the better versions I've ever had. The chocolate and chili peppers are harmonious in the this sauce. I've found that is rarely the case so this was so refreshing. I found the chicken a bit bland on its own but with the milder darker red sauce it was a match made in heaven.   Dessert was chunks of jello and grapes in a milky sauce. It's slightly sweet. I like it best with the peanuts sprinkled over the top for a salty bite with crunch. We weren't sure what the purpose of the peanuts were, but when we asked it was explained that it is common for the people of Puebla to snack on them while they enjoy their meal. I've never heard of such a thing, but I love being educated on regional customs.   Portions are on the smaller side. No grande meals here so if you have a hearty appetite order a couple items.",

Huge roasted poblano pepper filled with cheese, perfectly coated and fried. Smothered in a mild, but flavorful red sauce.  The pork tacos on corn tortillas were very good too. The pork is seasoned to perfection and the accompanying picked onions and habanero give them the perfect kick.  Enchiladas de Salsa Verde was very filling. Each rolled corn tortilla was stuffed full of chicken breast meat and topped with a zesty tomatillo green sauce.  Everything was so good and ate so much there was no room left for the fried ice cream.   We will be back for desert!   Aloha!!!",

I did expect more as far as location and set up, but, it was perfect for us as a last quick meal in Vegas before heading home.  My son ordered the Enchiladas de Mole Poblano - Shredded chicken rolled in corn tortilla, covered with Mole Poblano and topped with cotija cheese, onion and roasted sesame seeds. They were a little too sweet and choclatey for our tastes.  My mom had that Huevos Mexicanos and she loved them!    I had the Pelonas - 2 Fried Rolls stuffed with shredded beef , fried beans, cream and hot sauce.  They were not as seasoned as I would have liked, tasted like they needed salt or something was missing.  If it wasn't for the cream and hot sauce, I think the meat would have been too dry.  The bread was delicious though!  And we all shared the mini-Molletes - open face bolillo bread spread with refried beans and topped with melted cheese and pico de gallo.  They reminded me of home!",

It's a small spot where you order at the window (not unlike Roberto's) and are served shortly thereafter. The owner/server was extremely polite and helpful, even allowing substitutions in my case. The interior was very clean and well kept and the dishes were served on unique metal plates which was a nice touch. The complimentary chips and salsa were also a welcome addition to the typical taco shop experience. We ended up splitting plates of Enchiladas Verde, Chanclas, and Pelanos and I'm glad that we did. The portions were on the smaller side so as a stand alone meal I'm not sure it would be enough to fill most people up. There was nothing bad about the food but at the same time the flavors didn't standout either. I liked the salsa verde but the chicken seemed kind of bland.   Maybe I had too high of expectations due to the overwhelming positive reviews on Yelp but it was only OK for me.",

Order the frijoles charros which needed a little salt to bring out the flavor of all the amazing ingredients.  Very good Minus the missing dash of salt. Easy quick fix !   Order torta de pierna which was a little bit of a let down. The bollilo (bread) was amazing and could have been a better torata but the pierna needs a little more flavor and the sandwich overall was dry.   The mollotes with some fresh salsa amazing!! Have them as part of your meal or always a good appetizer make sure to add the salsa.  They sell Jarritos which always helps wash it all down. Overall this place is a must when on the area especially for the mole enchiladas.",

I also tried cheese enchiladas verde which was cooked/ melted all the way.  it seems impossible to get melted cheese in my enchilada at the local chain place.  rice and beans...rice was good and the beans had flavor!   good flavor too.  it took about 12 minutes, I had it to go but the place is cute and clean, I'd eat there next time.",

First of all, we got there at 8:21pm(says on the door that they close at 9pm). This old, grumpy man gave us a dirty look and seemed very upset that we came in there. Seriously WTF? I could literally feel his displeasure as we were seated. We ordered a few tacos and were put by 8:45pm. As we drove home, the people I was with all commented how they felt uncomfortable by the way this old man behaved.

If you are not familiar with Mexican food, they have a menu on the wall with pictures of the dishes. Also, the food is made fresh, you can tell once you take the first bite. If you're looking to explore, id deff recommend this restaurant :-)",

It's a small mom and pop shop in the sprawling strip mall with Target and Freed's Bakery. Order at the counter, take a seat and the food will be brought out to you. While you wait, complimentary chips and salsa are provided. The enchiladas de mole poblano ($7) are an excellent bargain. As with any good mole, there's a wide range of flavors with heat, smokiness and a subtle sweetness to it. The four corn tortillas were filled with shredded chicken, covered in mole and topped with cotija cheese, onions, and roasted sesame seeds.  Despite the modest interior the food is much more refined than a typical quick/casual Mexican spot. There's a level of passion and precision in the execution of the food that you won't find at similar restaurants -- all the more reason to make the jaunt to the other side of the valley.",

Yes, the place isn't busy, which was nice. The gentleman who worked as your cashier, server and buser was extremely courteous - think it was the owner.  The food was yummy too! I liked my carne asada tacos. It's funny because I always order this the first time I go to any Mexican restaurant to estimate how well their food would be in the future, and the ladies in the kitchen could not go wrong with their cooking style! I honestly wish I copied my boyfriend and got the enchiladas though!  Although they don't serve alcohol, they do have Mexican sodas, which is a bonus.  I guess you can also eat outside of the restaurant as well because the gentleman went outside to check on his customers too.",

    "text": "Authentic.  Absolutely delicious.    We ordered their frijoles rancheros, Chiles En ahogada and Guarache.       Let's start with their chips and salsa.  As a rule, when i try Mexican restaurants I can tell if their food is good if their salsas are authentic, fresh and flavorful.  Las Casuelas made the grade. Great salsa.          Now let's talk about their chips; I like chips to be natural and more homemade , these chips were a bit more commercial, so if you like Tostitos , you will like these.  Not to my liking but salsa made it almost unnoticeable.           Guarache, delicious! Had chicken one and loved it.           During Mexican Independence a very traditional dish is Chiles En Ahogada and this is a meat stuffed \"green chile \" topped with a walnut cream sauce and sprinkled with pomegranates.  This place served the Chile \"capeado\" which means covered in traditional Chile Relleno egg white covering.  The traditional Chile en Ahogada does not have the egg white coating.  However it was still delicious!            Finally, their Frijoles Rancheros bean soup.  The flavor was great.  Beans cooked in bacon are great.  I loved the broth. I prefer this soup to be done with Peruvian or light colored beans and they did theirs with pinto beans which tend to be a bit harder and that's what made this soup not perfect.  The beans themselves were too hard not cooked enough.         This place still made A grade food.  Oh one last thing- place hard to find because their sign is not eye friendly. I would say it's nice logo for restaurant menu  but not for customers looking for it in a shopping center location.",

As everyone has suggested, the mole is the thing to get here. Agreed. We tried the mole enchiladas and they were quite good. Also, the green chicken enchiladas were a solid green choice - very limey and vinegary, just how I like it. I already forgot the name of our last dish, but I think I liked it the best. It was like 2 little pulled pork sandwiches with a creamy sauce. Saronas or something like that. The meat was not too stringy, which is a big selling point for the kids. Prices were ~$8 per dish and the enchiladas came 2 to a plate with rice and beans. Plenty filling. Definitely a go-to casual Mexican spot in the area.",

I would like to give it more stars but can't after being disappointed with the chicken tacos my fiance ordered. The chicken meat used in the tacos was basically frozen processed Tyson chicken strips. We were surprised because everything else was very tasty and authentic. My chicken enchiladas had marinated shredded chicken that was excellent. His, on the other hand, was bland and obviously wasn't housemade. You can see how the lil \"grilled\" chicken strips are processed in shapes and probably right out of a bag. Seriously, look at the other pics posted on Yelp of their chicken tacos... WTF??...it's the worst excuse for \"Mexican\" meat they could possibly find and sell for $10-11?? We probably won't be back, but if we do we will order something different.",

    "text": "So we definitely came here because of the great reviews, and they did not disappoint.  First off, beans and rice are great here. No complaints. Secondly, you have to try the tacos. I love to try Al Pastor, and they were amazing. I tried the barbacoa and it was good but not amazing, to me. The carnitas were amazing. Oriental was so-sol. I tried the mole enchiladas, and they were good, but they just didn't sit right for me, for some reason. My wife tried the sopes, and wow, so good.   You find what you like at every place, but Las Cazuelas does not disappoint.   Lastly, staff are kind, attentive, and very accomodating to our party of six (including 2 kids) and in a small space. I am sure they will expand to a larger place some day, but for now, try to go during the not-so-busy hours. We were only visiting, but I would definitely come again!",

    "text": "I am baffled by the amazing reviews for this restaurant.  I went to this restaurant because of the overall yelp rating however I now notice that most of the great reviews  are old.  This place is very very mediocre.  I always first judge a Mexican restaurant first on their chips and salsa.  The chips were the kind of chips that tasted like they came from a Costco bag.  The salsa did NOT taste homemade.  It was meh.  Based on the reviews I ordered the enchiladas with mole sauce.  Coming from California I have had mole many times including homemade mole from my staff.  I know what authentic mole is.  The mole at this restaurant tasted like chocolate sauce (way too sweet!) on top of my chicken enchiladas.  If you want dessert with your enchiladas this is the way to go-- however I did not.  The gentleman kindly offered to exchange the dish for something else (after arguing with me about that they served authentic mole from a particular region-- like I never had mole before), so I ordered the chicken enchiladas with the green sauce.  Again, this dish was just mediocre-- the sauce did not taste homemade, chicken was not well seasoned.  I also judge a Mexican restaurant by their rice and beans.  Sadly, in this case neither were authentic, tasty nor memorable.    I've learned to investigate an overall yelp rating more closely.  Look at the most recent reviews. Read them carefully. Restaurant ownerships and chefs change without the public knowing.",

When I walked in, I was greeted by both the husband and wife (who were clearly the owners, cooks, cashiers, etc.). They were both so friendly!  I asked if they had pozole and they said they enough left for one order - which was perfect! I was bringing food back for someone else, so we also ordered the chilaquiles with chicken and an order of the churros to share. It was ALL delicious!  This is not a typical Robertos or Don Tortaco spot. They serve up awesome Mexican food that you may not be familiar with that's indigenous to the region of Mexico they're from. But, no fear. They have pictures clear as day on the wall of what everything looks like.   I came home and reheated the pozole slightly and dressed it up a bit (see picture). They give you the condiments and chips to go with the soup. It was perfect! The only suggestion I would make is to give a bit more with the chilaquiles order. For $7-$8, the size wasn't very big and you only get a little bit of chicken. But, it was all delicious!!! I'm going back today to try the mole poblano enchiladas!",

    "text": "Holy Mole Poblano! Yes, that is what is served here at Las Cazuelas!  I took a glance at the menu that was outside their storefront and noticed they had a bunch of Mexican food not found elsewhere. If you're looking for Pueblan food fare, well here it is! That's the big appeal for me. Although the menu selection is slim, I love the variety of dishes they have to offer.   My second visit here ended up being a mini fiesta of sorts. Orders of Mole Poblano, Pelonas, Frijoles Charros, Elote and complimentary tortilla chips and salsa covered my table. Yes all that for me. I had already tried most of the dishes on my first visit here and got hooked. The Pelonas especially! They remind me of sliders, only this is the Mexican version of it. The mini egg bun is fried with paste of refried beans smeared on and marinated shredded beef with combo Mexican sour cream/salsa sauce. Real simple but so good!  Oh and it's accompanied by the best beans ever! Frijoles Charros! Cowboy beans but Mexican version the owner explains to me.  The beans are the kind that's firm on outside and soft when you take a bite like it's been cooking all day. Simmering in with bacon, chorizo, and sausage too! It made one heck of a hearty dish.  Mole poblano is legit.  With the dark chocolate prominent. So it was more sweet, not too spicy. Oh by the way, with that said, I have to do the eye roll when I read or hear \"needs more spice\" or \"not enough of this..too much of that\"  blah blah blah. Not going to act like I know Mexican cuisine, nor am I some self proclaimed expert in tacos or whatever. There are regional differences in some of the dishes. Not all are the spicy variety. So any preconceived notion of enchiladas doused with spicy red sauce and drowned in cheese do not apply here.   It's a small operation run by husband and wife. Friendly, very humble and a super sweet couple.  So service is more personalized. Everything is prepared to order so my food came out one at a time for the most part, definitely not like the to-go fast food eateries speedwise.  I didn't mind a bit, since I wasn't in hurry. Serving portions are not the super size versions here either, but are just as filling. Everything is under $10. My mini fiesta was around $20ish ..not bad at all.   Fast/casual little restaurant. Order at counter and your meal is brought out to you when ready. The dining area is really pretty. Love the wall art deco, unique pallets with knick knacks from Mexico attached. Turns out that the wife made and decorated the place. The space is small with four tables that seat 4 fills up. No worries though, there is plenty seating outdoors in the courtyard shared with the hot dog and boba place.  How cool is that a few of my go to places are just a hop, skip and a jump away from each other.",

Ordered 4 Taco de Cochinita tacos and 4 chicken enchiladas with green sauce, beans and rice on both plates for an extra $3.25 ($11.25 each). Very small enchiladas and tacos, they do not resemble the pictures in the online menu.  The pork looked more like a glob of meat filling with very little flavor,  the chicken had no flavor at all. Beans are refried ( about a tablespoon) and the rice was very bland (maybe 2 table spoons) all for an astonishing $3.25 extra. No cilantro or garnishes (as pictured online) on the plates, cheese on the enchiladas was mozzarella ???  Should be 2 stars, the extra star is for the kind gentlemen who took & served our orders.",

The green chile sauce that came with another dish was spicy but was also excellent with a deep fresh flavor.  Have been here multiple times. Don't go for the hot dogs next door",

It is their Mole Poblano and Chile Relleno that are the definite standouts. And where else will you be able to have Chanclas, Pelonas, Molletes, or Esquites? Their approach is traditional, so if you're looking for burritos, fast food, or supersized portions then go elsewhere. Here just order a dish or two off the menu, grab a Mexican Coca Cola, and treat yourself to a well-deserved eating break.",

Rice had been reheated enough it was a lump and Frijoles were heated right out of the can.  Service was good but the tables were dirty.  All in all plastic strip mall food",

I don't need to search anymore for good authentic Mexican food in the Las Vegas Valley area. I am totally satisfied with the excellent food that came out of the kitchen each time I visited.  The taste is not overpowering with mounds of cheese and overly tangy sauce.  If you want good and real authentic Mexican cooking, you must try Las Cazuelas.  If you prefer to get rip off with Americanized junk, there are pretty of other places.  This place is unique.  I do have to mentioned the service was also very good.",

The restaurant is small, but I was impressed by how clean and attractive it is.  We arrived just after 10am on a Monday morning and only one other patron was there.  We ordered the huevos rancheros and sat down.  The gentleman taking our order at the register did not exactly exude lots of warmth but he was polite and we quickly had a bowl of chips and some of the tastiest salsa I've had in a long time.  The chips were salty without being too salty.  Most places I have to add salt to the chips but these were fresh, crunchy and with that wonderful salsa really hit the spot.  Our food came quickly and I was again impressed that when we ordered the eggs medium, that's how they were cooked.  No runny white, but the yolk still soft, just perfect for me!!!  The plates they use are very different and set off the food for a nice presentation.  The refried beans were very good and the corn tortillas that came with our meal were so hot I could hardly hold one in my hand!!  Lots of other places half warm the tortillas and they end up being hard and rubbery but these were not.  I finished off my whole plate and the bf did also.  At $5.50 for this meal, it is the bargain of the week!!!!    We want to try the enchiladas de mole poblano so badly, I know we will be back again there very, very soon!!  I am intrigued by some of the other offerings, some I have never heard of.  This is definitely a must try if you are looking for good, very reasonably priced food!!",
