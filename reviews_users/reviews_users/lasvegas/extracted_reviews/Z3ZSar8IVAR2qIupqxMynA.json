We searched and searched all over Yelp! to find this, which had the highest rating and was a close walk from the hotel.   Thus, we ended up here at Joe's New York Pizza. We called in our order of a large (6 slices) with pepperoni, sausage, and onions on one half. The person on the other end said it'd be ready in 10-15 minutes so we just watched tv some more.   We asked if they could deliver to the hotel, but they said we'd have to meet them at the entrance and not at our room. That sucked so we opted out of delivery and just went for pick up. Might as well.   10-15 minutes go by and we make our way towards the vicinity. When we entered and asked for our order, the woman in the front said it'd be about 5 more minutes. Poops. Anyway, the pizza finally finished and I paid about $22 for pizza that was just OKAY. I even had to pay an extra 50 cents for a thing of ranch. The sausage and pepperoni were salty as they should be but the onions were pretty much yellow onions sliced and just thrown onto half of the pizza. I was hoping that they'd use red onions but the yellow ones were still alright.   Oh yeah and you can tell the pizza was over oily because the oil soaked through the cardboard box and stained the bed cover at the hotel. Hmmm....",

Upon entering this establishment, the manager came out from behind the counter and told us we couldn't bring the dog into his establishment.  At that point, he began to raise his voice while telling us to leave.  I attempted to tell him it was a service dog to help her, but he drowned me out while yelling over me.  We left the establishment without further discussion, and my granddaughter was forced to take her meds to calm herself down.  Three hours later she was still visably upset and crying over the incident.  Whether you go to this establishment is totally up to you.  My point for writing this post is to warn other individuals with disabilities to know in advance this establishment does not follow the ADA Laws that the Federal Government and the State of Nevada has established for people with disabilities.",

After a long day of working at the booth, you get too tired and a bit \"cranky\" to stand in a long line for food, competing with all the other vendors to get food. So, i decided to take a quick drive., for a quick bite, just enough for me to have food in my stomach to hibernate till morning. New York style thin crust pizza seems plain and simple. I came here to order by the slice, and it filled the need. Nothing different than any other independent pizza places i've gone too. It met my expectations, as i just ordered a couple of choices to go, and gulped it down as i drove back to my hotel. For me, meeting and fulfilling my needs and expectations get a 3/5 star.  Kinda like eating a peanut butter and jelly sandwich before bed. It takes care of my need.",

The second night we ordered with them, they were faster than expected when they delivered our food. Next time I am in Vegas I am definitely ordering with these guys again.  Their Pizza is not exactly like New York pizza but it's pretty darn good. My favorite was the white truffle mushroom pizza it was so amazing and definitely award-winning.",

Huge slice was enough to fill me up - comes with double cheese, pepperoni, Italian sausage, and Canadian bacon and regular bacon sprinkled on top.  The main meat is layered on the thin crust on the bottom with the cheese on top.  They have a number of different slices to choose from and then they put it back in the oven for a few minutes and it is piping hot when you get it.  Highly recommend this place for great pizza!",

    "text": "I just got back from this place and we couldn't stop talking about it in the car on the ride back to work that I swore i would write a review.   Joe's is located on the South end of the Beltz Mall off Las Vegas Blvd (AKA Premium Outlets South). Next to 5 Guys burgers.   Their lunch special is 2 slices of pizza (pepperoni or cheese) for $8 OR 1 slice (pepperoni or cheese) and a side salad for $8. Drinks are 1/2 off during lunch.   We walked out paying about $18 for 2 people for lunch. Not bad, not cheap either.  BUT!!!!!!!!!! This pizza is SO worth the price. And we only had pepperoni! There were more pizza selections and subs and sandwiches too. But pizza is what they are known for so thats what we had.   The space is a little confusing but I'm here to clarify it for you all first timers. Since there is a ton of people inside, it may cause panic for some. So here is the drill:  1. Walk in and head to the front counter.   2. Order your pizza (don't forget to ask about the daily special)  or meal selection. They will take the pizza slice if that's all you are ordering and heat it up or you in the oven while you pay.  3. Pay and give them your name to call it when your order is ready.    4. Fill your drink up with their Coca cola mutli-selection dispenser. I love this! They have Fruit punch!   5. Sit where-ever you want. Your name will be called and you can come get your order up at the front counter.   6. Enjoy!   We absolutely love this place. We were in and out, back at my desk in the 30min we have for lunch. The food was pipping hot when we got it and the Parmesan in their dispensers is REAL PARMESAN, not the fake confetti some places have.   You all must visit. My pizza craving has been satisfied and I will return.",

To be honest there are probably other places you can  go in las Vegas for good new York style pizza but this is one of. The best I've had.   However the area the location is in isn't so great (on paradise close to the strip) so be prepared for crack heads and tourists alike. Also be prepared for a wait since this place usually has a small wait at the least to order plus for your food to get to you.  The pizza itself is really good, puffy crusts and large slices.  They have a good variety of different slices of pizza from vegetarian to meat lovers to plain cheese. I had a cheese pizza and a chicken pesto pizza and both were really good. I would go back here for sure.",

Both were on there... in fact there was extra peppers :(. I also ordered chicken on it, but it was on the side. It smelled a bit off and was so dry and crunchy like it had been under a heating lamp for a while. I also ordered a buffalo chicken sub with chicken tenders for my boyfriend. That had to be the most upsetting of the order. The lettuce (salad, lets be honest) was brown and even looked burnt in some areas. It was soggy and very unsavory looking. At least the chips were good right? I had to take out and toss all the peppers, tomatoes, the entire sub, the side chicken and the zippoles were so weak and there's no way there was cinnamon on it.   Really disappointed. First trip to Las Vegas. Will not be ordering from this place again.",

By the time we got it it was a cold mess. Tonight we decided to give them another chance. Looked from them on Uber Eats and couldn't find them. Called in and placed the order. The guy was nice and answered my questions about Uber Eats. When we get there to pick up they say \"We don't have it you must have called the other store.\" So I redial the phone number and they answer with the Paradise location. Nope, it was the right store. The girl just stares at us blank faced. Doesn't even offer to retake our order or anything to help. Just unbelievably rude. So, I ask if I can place a new order since mine magically disappeared. She grunts and agrees. We get the food and bring it home. It was a mess. So done with this place.",

About 15 minutes after the estimated delivery time, I called them and the person who answered said they were slammed but the pizza was going to be on it's way and be delivered within 25 minutes.  An hour later, no pizza. We called back and he said it just left. 30 minutes later, no pizza. Finally the driver called to ask a question on our building and then he showed up right away after that. He was SUPER nice and apologetic and it made me feel bad to leave this review, but the length of time between ordering and receiving food is just unacceptable. To make it worse, I ordered buffalo wings naked with the sauce on the side, and they came with no sauce. I had to use Sriracha to make it work. And I was sad. :(",

Though I had several dishes prepared ahead of time, I needed something to put on the table as soon as people started rolling in.I've ordered 9 \"humongous\" size pizzas from Joe\"s NY Pizza recommended by a friend, and I must say they didn't disappoint. Not just that, the service was excellent (staff was very helpful and informative when testing pizzas beforehand, they were also super patient when I had to call back 4 times due to bad reception at the Thomas & Mack Center, and all pizzas were ready for pick-up as agreed), but the pizzas were truly amazing. Since I had a variety of people, I needed variety of pizzas. These were the ones I've ordered from their menu, and I recommend them all (some were doubles): Manhattan Loaded Pizza, Hawaiian Pizza, Buffalo Chicken Pizza, Pesto Chicken Pizza, Veggie Pizza, White Spinach Pizza. For the party, I've purchased pizza serving trays ahead of time, thinking that, I will serve these pizzas stylishly. Well, I never had the chance to transfer them, because as soon as we arrived with the pizzas, so were some of the guests, and they just attacked them from the box. The reason I, my family and our guests liked the pizzas was that, the ingredients were very well balanced in quantity, flavor and appearance. The dough was aslo very good. The location of Joe's New Yourk Pizza on Paradise Road was very convenient, and parking is ample. Though I've only eaten there once so far, when I tested their pizzas, I loved this cozy restaurant's atmosphere (I was there at lunch time).  I highly recommend this place to pizza lovers, as pizza can't get much better than this. I will definitely be back to try all of their dishes.",

The pizza was greasy, burnt and almost inedible. If I wasn't already in a hurry i would have asked for my money back.

In an attempt to ensure they get that crispy underside, they end up either torching it or leaving me with a lackluster taste in my mouth.  Not this place. They nailed every part of the formula; from the fresh and flavorful toppings (grease all over my plate!!!) to the crispy and perfectly baked crust. I highly recommend taking a stop by and trying the pepperoni as a benchmark. This is how you're supposed to do it.",

It's a 7 min walk across from the Hard Rock hotel on a street that one should jaywalk very carefully...  I didn't know if casino security was going to hassle Me for bringing in pizza so I walked it to My room discreetly.. I suggest you do so too. Delivery is $2.50 but tower elevator that require cards would of made it a pain if security had allowed them....  I ordered a 12 inch Greek pizza  but instead of feta I asked for ricotta( oil mozzerella oregano tomato). The staff had a great attitude.the place had a lot of pizza by the slice sitting out available.. Maybe that pizza is so so but the pizza I ordered made for me was stellar with good ingredients.   I ordered a few sides of marinara but they are generous so 2 instead of 3 will do...  Oh the place also has the 140 drink freestyle coke machine... I have heard of them and definitely enjoyed the cherry ginger ale.",

The crust was crispy and the cheese was was ooowee gooey. They have a small staff and they're very personable the young lady who was working recognizing my my voice. I literally said about 5 words to her and she said oh my gosh I forgot the cheese pizza. We joked for about 3 minutes on recognizing each other because she was the only female working at the time. I think a really good plus to this restaurant as that is across the street from the Hard Rock Hotel. So if you're looking to save a little money and get some great food you can just walk Rush Street get your food and go right back up to your room.",

    "text": "Eaten here more than once (just forgot to check in because too busy stuffing my face). The best pizza for value and taste is here! I will update after eating with pictures and updates! Alright let's talk my type of pizza: crust needs to be perfect, not too doughy and not too dried out and crunchy. The ratio of cheese to tomato sauce to crust also needs to be considered. It can't be watery, too cheesy, or too dry. I'm sure a 3way ANOVA can show some significance...(lol). The dough must have a neutral yet pleasant taste. I think it depends on the water. The tomato sauce should be savory, not sweet with too much sugar. This place meets my standards for my type of pizza.  Other than the delicious food, the service is fast and friendly, and the atmosphere is hilarious! There are pictures of funny 1950's billboards and posters with clever puns and cute pin up girls with funny sayings. Plus the tables are wiped down and the floor is free of grease tracks and spilled pepper flakes.  I'm coming back again and if you'd like to check it out, I highly recommend!",

Why did She quote me an hour when it's been about 2 1/2 hours since we've called... Idk...but the point of this is it was $60 something bucks and I had to wait 3 hours for this pizza to get here. Wasn't really pleased about it. I understand you are busy and popular but that was WAY too long.   Food: pizza was like Luke warm. Pretty greasy but it wasn't bad although we were pretty hungry so who really knows how it tasted. Pastas were warm so that was good.   Overall: delivery service sucks. Food is alright.",

I order a large pep pie with coke and it came to 33 bucks.  If I was a cheap guy I would have rated it 3 stars.  Bottom line is if I lined this place up with all my favorite NY Pizza joints, this place would be average, but since it is located in LV Nevada, 4 stars all the way.    Lastly, the customer service was warm and on point.  I received a call letting me know that my online order was accepted and they didn't have Cherry Coke, so I had to go with Coke.  I received another call when the driver had 6 min left on his GPS and another when he was at the gate.  I like to know where my pizza is and when it got to my stomach I was satisfied.",

I got the BBQ chicken, and my mom got the pepperoni. The crust was good, but mine tasted a bit old, and I didn't love the sauce.

I happen to be a master of eating salads with my hands as I have acrylic nails from Nina Nails that I can use. Hard Rock charges 6 dollars from room service to bring a fork. FORK that!

Good pizzas (NY-style thin crust, maybe a bit California-inspired on toppings), accurate estimates for delivery and pickup times, and friendly service.

    "text": "I stopped by Joe's New York Pizza, an international award winning pizzeria, to grab a couple of slices for dinner before a concert. Inside was clean and there was a good amount of customers dining inside. They have several types of pizza in the glass case for sale by the slice or you can order a whole pizza that can be customized to your liking. Slices are a bit pricey I thought at first, but are big and filling. One thing that annoyed me right off the bat is the menu pricing. They have big lit up letters on the front saying \"pizza by the slice\" and have it painted on the window yet where are the pizza by the slice prices on the menu at?? I hope this is something they update in the future.   Pizza sizes are small (12 inches), gigantic (16 inches) and humongous (20 inches). There is a pizza for everyone here with classic toppings such as pepperoni, mushrooms, sausage etc., but then they offer things like deep fried pepperoni chips and Spanish chorizo also.   Gourmet Pepperoni ($5.29 per slice) - Gourmet Italian pepperoni, goat cheese & tangy roasted red pepper. This pizza is a 2013 award winner. I'm not sure if my picture shows well enough, but the pepperoni slices on this pizza are huge. There was a good amount of goat cheese and the roasted red pepper really added a nice flavor to the slice. My hubby had this also and loved it.   Pepperoni and Mushroom ($4.50 per slice) - A classic slice and it's done pretty good here. The size of the slices on this particular pizza was a lot smaller than the others in the case and the guy who took my order noticed that. He ended up giving me 3 slices so that I was not feeling ripped off and I was impressed by the employee caring so much. This pizza was good and something I'd order again. The crust is tasty.   Don't forget to ask for a Slice Club reward card so that you can get a free slice after you buy 9.",

Miguel, was very helpful on the phone and fun to talk with - and he made a point to tell me we should really be sure to try them because they have \"the best pizza in Las Vegas\".  He was right - it was delicious!    We ordered the Humungous Meat Pie (it's huge!), and the Tomato, Garlic, Basil pizza - both were very good.   The Buffalo salad was great too! And the Zeppoles were a nice sweet treat to have after eating the pizza.   Miguel delivered the pizza to us himself (on time!) - and he was just as fun and friendly in person.   Overall I would certainly rate them at the top of my list of \"best pizza in Las Vegas\" :-)",

I forgot what it was called. The pizzas were huge, and 2 large pizzas were able to fill up 14 people. We also ordered wings and fries which were great as well. They have a big soda selection since it's one of those touch screen machines.  The pizza was real cheesy and had a lot of toppings  to the point where if you try to grab a slice, everything is going to topple over and make a huge mess where you pick up your toppings off the tray hahah I honestly don't mind this and it makes me excited to grab everything and place it back on my pizza.    Service was great as well although it wasn't really a restaurant. The ladies were nice and helped us throw away our empty plates, although I'm sure they wanted us to leave for other customers aude we did stay awhile. This place is real small which maybe 10 tables??",

The very first time I ordered they said my card wouldn't go through , I called my bank and they said my card was fine. Called Joes back and they said it's declined. So at that point I was tired and left it alone. Next day I wake up to see a charge on my account from joes pizza! Apparently my card did go through and I never got my pizza! I called my bank got it cleared. I figured it was s mistake.   Last night I decided to try them out once again. Not only did the pizza make my family and I very nauseous but I woke up to have two charges from them!!! I called them and spoke to JULIE the manager. She explained to me that this has happened to a few clients and doesn't know why and she would have the owner call me. The OWNER  called 20 minutes later making excuses as to why this would happen. He continued to say all of this was impossible to happen because it didn't show on his end and said he needed the \"truth\". I explained that I already disputed the charges with my bank and maybe that's why it wasn't showing up . He asked to see my bank statements!!! Because I wasn't telling him the truth. He also said ANY ORDER YOU PLACE WITH A CREDIT CARD WILL BE PRE AUTHORIZED for the same amount in his restaurant.   In the end my bank resolved the issues of course but I  only called them to let them know there's an issue in their system they need to resolve and I got a rude call from the owner calling me a liar! Don't order here. Save yourself a headache and try another place!",

I ordered a meaty and a couple of slices of pepperoni but expecting my order of baked potato fries they didn't charge me for so they had to take my order again and when I finally got them they were just plain fries... why are plain fries even an option ? Sleepy as hell I said screw it. The last straw was when I ordered another slice of pepperoni and waiting to find out they gave it to someone else and it was the last slice so I had to settle for pepperoni and sausage. Great pizza though, mediocre fries, customer service needs better communication.",

The girls said the slices were good.  My calzone was tasty. I liked the nostalgic plates on the wall.  The only disappointing part of my visit was the customer service. I didn't feel that I was valued as a customer. They was no warm greeting, I amlost felt as if they preferred I was interpreting them. My daughter stood at the register waiting to order a side of blue cheese and she ignored until she spoke up and the employee seemed distracted.",

That said, it's also absolutely delicious.  I went with the \"Grandee Pepperoni\" which includes a ridiculously flavorful combination of pepperoni, gorgonzola cheese (no mozz), red pepper and fried pepperoni chips. The fried pepperoni makes the dish with it's deep salty flavor. The gorgonzola's brightness is perfectly balanced with the oily meat. This rich and savory pie is highly recommended.   I was quoted 45 minutes for delivery but in reality, it took almost two hours. Oh well, what can you expect for a Friday night in Vegas?",

Last time I gave 3 stars, with the chicken alfredo being excellent, but the lasagna pizza and delivery experience being bad.  THIS TIME, I tried a pizza that was half white truffle mushroom and half frat boy.  The white truffle was a little disappointing, as there was so much bacon.. it overpowered any taste of white truffle or mushrooms.  The frat boy tasted great!!  The only thing, the type of ingredients on it sweat when heated, so the crust gets a little soggy... it's not like that's anything they could fix though.. that's just expected with this kind of pizza.  It will be great as leftover pizza heated in the oven though!  I ordered the chicken alfredo again, as I was sooo impressed with it last time.. kinda wanted to see if that was a fluke, but nope, it was sooo good again!!  I add mushrooms to it also.. and heated up as leftovers.. omg, I'm in heaven!!  Delivery was 5 stars this time.. fast, friendly, and no trying to trick me into double tipping with a machine like last time.  So yeh.. I'll be ordering from here again!  :)",

The first thing you notice when you walk in is the VERY well decorated space.  Pictures and other various things surround you and make you feel as if though you are in NYC.  The second thing you notice is how MASSIVE the slices are!  They're HUGE!  My gf and I ordered a large (8 slices) pizza with two toppings on each half, came out to be $20 and change.  I was skeptical at first paying that much for a pizza, but we were both VERY pleased.  The pizza was ready in about 10 minutes and it was very well cooked and presented. Another thing with NY style pizza is that some other ones in the area tend to be greasy where as this one was not at all.  I apologize for not having a photo to share as we were both so hungry that as soon we got home we cracked open the box and ate the whole thing :)  Overall, very happy and will be returning in the future.",

Came here after a whole day at REHAB on a Sunday and after walking around like seemed like forever inside the hard rock hotel- finally found a guy to locate us in the direction of food, specifically pizza, which I was craving. (All of hard rocks food closed at around 6 & what was open seemed to cost am arm and a leg for something half that price back home!)  Boy was I glad we left the hotel, and although quite drunk, we managed to hop tipsily on over to this little strip mall next to a sports bar and a sushi place and boy was I surprised!! Best pizza ever!! DELICIOUS!  I walked right in- spent about $5 for a slice of pizza that would put costcos to shame and my taste buds were doing a dance of glory! The tomato basil was to die for!- thin crust, freshly tasting basil with yummy marinara and the perfect blend combined.   It was SO good we told out friends who we came back with like an hour later and every single person who walked in seemed to either be a local and know the spot or were told the same thing by someone else and were thoroughly impressed. I even had their fettuccini Alfredo the second time and it was almost better than Olive Garden!!  This place seems to be a place in New York or the Bronx (not that I've ever been) but this is a little hole in the wall- Italian pizzeria and whoever joe is- let me tell you!! You got some great food!!  I WILL be back! Ciao!",

(The shopping center itself is interesting, with a very lively CVS, a few cute restaurants, and a 24 hour pedicure \"spa\"...). Parking is easy, and the place itself is cute and clean, with a few tables to sit.   I've only ordered their pizza, and have always been satisfied. It's down to earth, good food. Their slices are thick, and quite good. Nice crust, good cheese, not too greasy. It's good pizza at a decent prize.    Overall, I like that it's a departure from plastic overpriced pizza you sometimes find on the strip.  If you're staying at the Hard Rock or close by, it's worth a trip. I didn't know they deliver to hotels, will definitely keep it in mind next time.",

Who knows....I didn't come in with any expectations, but I was hungry, so I ordered 2 slices, one Hawaiian (my favorite) and one lasagna (yes, lasagna pizza) there were about 8 different types of pizza to choose from, which were all pre-made, and then ran through oven to warm them up. I was surprised how good they tasted for being pre made, they weren't greasy either. Props for having ranch dressing too. They also have sandwiches and salads.   I gave a solid 3 stars, I can't give pre made pizza 4 or 5 stars, because it can't go up against the likes of Metro pizza or Dom's, but I can see this place being busy on late nights after all the drunks stumble out of the Hard Rock looking for food.",

I was pretty surprised and disappointed to say the least.  I would have expected to pay maybe $5 or so for what I got, however, I felt totally ripped-off paying for what I got. So word to the wise, make sure what the price is before you order because in my opinion it wasn't worth it!  WAY OVERPRICED AND NO PRICES LISTED PER-SLICE = FEELING RIPPED-OFF!",

The dough is amazing!!! But I do not recommend ordering the meat pie ~ Staff friendly .. People seemed to be locals or people escaping the strip .. More then likely will not be returning.. Super expensive .. $35 for a large pizza & $2 for a small drink",

If pizza is supposed to be like Buffalo, then it should be boring and cold... and have some produce on it.  Actually, my last trip to Joe's, I had a slice of greek-inspired heaven.  Feta cheese, spinach, olives, and other goodness.  But it wasn't hot.  Or warm.  It was cold.  No bueno.  So, in essence, it was still like Buffalo.  This didn't distract me, though.  I still ate the damn thing and was happy as a mosquito at United Blood Services.  I even ate half of my girlfriend's slice.  She got some massively meaty slice.  God bless carne.  All in all, this is a great option if you're getting out of the Hard Rock after heavy drinking/head banging at the Joint.  Stumble across the street and get some grub!",

I don't remember her name but her service gets 5 stars as she hooked me up!  The second visit wasn't as good.

They have chicken wings, salads, and calzones.  I really like their Chicken and Pesto Pizza.  Another favorite is the Barbeque Chicken Pizza!

It was so good I literally wrapped it in plastic and drove 4 hours back home to Los Angeles to share it with my friends (well, after the weekend was over).

I've ordered on 2 occasions: once about a year ago I got the gourmet pepperoni with the peppers and other goodies on it that makes it unique. Another order I just placed yesterday because they happened to be open relatively late on the 4th and I had a decent experience last time. This time i just got a basic pepperoni and garlic knots.  The medium is pretty huge. We were starving so it fed us 2 with a slice to spare, but could've easily fed 4 normal hungry adults. The pizza was delicious! The pepperoni has lots of flavor, its thinner crust, and then on the edges it's a nice thick crust. I loved it. It was just a little more greasy than I was expecting, but nothing so bad to keep me from eating it. The garlic knots, on the other hand, were a real let down. They were pretty dry and I was really hoping for something a little more buttery and flavorful. I also had a couple knots that were burnt on the bottom which killed the flavor. Not even the marinara sauce could disguise it.  Overall I would definitely order again. The delivery guy and person I spoke to on the phone were pretty friendly. My delivery was pretty late but it was a holiday and they were probably slammed, so I forgive that as it probably wouldn't have happened on a normal day. Plus my pizza was still warm. Try this place! I would definitely recommend the higher end pepperoni if you have elevated tastebuds.",

We've had issues with them making correct change, remembering to give us our overpriced sauces, and knowing when appetizers should come out (spoiler alert: It's before the main dish). It's not that I particularly mind appetizers coming out with the main course or a minute or two after, considering this is a pizza parlour we're talking about here. However we had already just about finished our meal when we hear the staff discussing they had forgotten our appetizer and burnt it. I immediately got up and requested a refund. They were reluctant, but at this point I was also ready to ask for my tip back, as it was obviously wasted on poor service. I can't say we'll be back.",

They use decent quality ingredients from what I can tell and the food is made with obvious skill and interest and they really hit the spot for when I'm having that comfort food, Pizza craving urge.  Every time that I've ordered delivery, they have been on time and from a friendly delivery person so no complaints there.  My favorite Salad from here is the Nutty Italian and at 8$ Dollars or so, it's not inexpensive per se, but it can easily feed 2 people and has numerous fresh quality ingredients and with the Vinegarette it's quite memorable.  I think the Garlic Knots are overrated, but since they are free with a large order of food from here...the more the merrier.  My favorite pizza here is a large thin crust Garlic with extra cheese. Bon Appetito!",

The delivery guy got lost and I got my pizza like an hour from time of ordering. So I got my pizza and realized that they forgot to put sausage on my pizza..so when I called and explained what happened the manager Jose offered to replace my pizza but I had to wait again so I told him it wasn't a big deal I just wanted to let you guys know myth at my pizza was wrong so he apologized and stated that he will give me a credit for my pizza and replace it next time I order. So I called in today and explained everything and told them I have a credit so the guy tells me I only a ten percent off I explained that's wrong it should be a credit for another pizza. So he put me on hold and another guy came on the phone and started reading the notes but read it to me very slow as if I was slow and didn't understand...it was offensive and this situation could of been handled very differently because I will never order from you guys ever again",

My slice also came out piping hot, which was also a plus.  Two negatives were: the pizza was very salty and the price for one cheese slice with no toppings was $4.50.  I realize it's near the Strip and all but that's a bit steep for one slice of pizza.  The slice was slightly below average in size.",

I'm not saying you should walk here from the Strip, but if you're staying at the Hard Rock or nearby, and want to grab a slice, just walk across the street.  Reasonably priced, quick service, nice guy at the counter.  There is pizza next door at some new place that opened but that's a more upscale restaurant-type place.  Tons of taxi drivers, locals, tourists, even a few families were packing the place.  Open late.  Note - they used to deliver to the Hard Rock but are no longer allowed to (a note at the counter for staff says they will be arrested if they come on site.  Seriously?)",

I ordered 1 extra large 3 topping and 10 wings and spent about 41 dollars, the pizza was great but the wings not so much. I could definitely tell the chicken wasn't fresh, so was it worth 40 bucks? Probably not, stick with the salads and pizza and u won't be disappointed. The girl behind the counter wasn't exactly friendly but what are u gonna do,",

I basically went onto yelp and chose the pizza place that had the best deal/reviews/veggie options that delivered. Joes came up (out of a good 10+ other pizza joints in the area!), so I went with them. I called them, made my order, and it was done. I was kind of suspicious that they didnt mention what the price was going to be, but I figured that a two topping veggie pizza couldnt be that expensive.  The delivery boy showed up to my hotel room pretty promptly, but the bill was for over $25! I couldn't believe it, thats more than twice what I regularly pay back home (in Los Angeles mind you, where nothing is cheap!), so I was very disappointed there. The pizza was pretty good though, but I dont think I would ever pay that much for a pizza again if I can avoid it! Next time I'll just walk around the corner to the other pizza place and give them a try.",

We weren't all that hungry since we had an enormous breakfast earlier in the day, but I new that I would be out late (early AM) for a GNR show, so we decided to get a slice here. The ambiance is very modest. There are maybe 5-6 tables, plastic forks and knives, serve yourself drinks, you get the picture. The pizza was just ok, not terrible, but certainly nothing to rave about. $15 for 3 slices, one cheese, one pepperoni, and one meat combo. The best thing was the thin crust. Other than that the toppings and pizza in general were just average. There are, however, entertaining posters on the walls that are worth a look.",

    "text": "I've been to Joe's quite a few times over the last two years being that I work in the area. Service and food quality has been in a steady decline to the point where it's at now. Let's get started.  Pizza at Joe's: The main attraction to the monster! Joe's prides itself in its pizzas and has won 'awards' for just that. The display is usually filled with pizzas which they pop a piece from and toss in the oven for a nice hot slice. However long the pizza sits out is anyone's guess, supply and demand I suppose. But let's be honest here for a second, the pizza is sub par. About one step above fast food pizza, there's just nothing that makes it a must have gourmet experience. Ingredients are decent quality, very little actual food magic is happening in regards of making the pizza taste good. It's dough, sauce and cheese with toppings. This is ever more apparent with the appearance of Naked City Pizza that just down the street from Joe's. Where you'll pay a bit more to enjoy some quality pizza. Not the same thing you've had everywhere else...  This ingredient theme runs rampant throughout the entire menu. Chicken fingers are coated with over salted bread crumbs. Their alfredo pasta is plagued by an oily sauce that barely adheres to itself, let alone the sauce or chicken. Jalapeno poppers, mozarella stick, chicken salads. You name it, the quality is all the same, and it's sub par. If you're looking for a CHEAP place to spend money and eat pizza, this is it. The place is just that, cheap. I don't know whom they fed pizza to in order to win any awards but any adult with a functioning and understanding pallet will be let down by this place.  Customer service has only ever been an issue in regards to messing up orders, and they do this A LOT. Multiple times have I ordered their chicken wings, tenders, etc. and requested certain sauces on the side. At one point I ordered chicken wings with hot sauce and hot sauce on the side. I ended up getting chicken wings with no sauce on it and only a cup of ranch on the side. Just today I had ordered chicken tenders with sauce on the side, and instead got it on my chicken tenders.   2 out of 5. If you're ok with a quick bite to eat on the go, enjoy Joe's. With Naked City Pizza having just opened up down the street from this location (next to the Hofbrauhaus) i'll be recommending them instead. Review to come soon.",

We are an Italian family, from New Jersey, and have eaten lots of amazing, delicious italian food and subs. Well... Joe's had NO IDEA how to make one. First, they asked if we wanted mustard on the sub....(ummm what? is this a joke?). After saying no, they seemed dumbfounded as to why we wouldn't. When the food finally arrived, we noticed that there was no oil or vinegar on the sub at all. They also used lots of pepperoni(which is also not in a real italian sub) to fill the roll. To be honest, we weren't even mad because it was funny that a place called \"Joe's New York Pizza\" couldn't even make a simple italian sub. Not sure if this was maybe a joke or a one-time mishap, but it was pretty ridiculous. I gave three stars, because like I said, the food is okay, just not authentic.",

It was dripping with so much grease that even 5 napkins would not sop it up. I returned the entire slice uneaten and requested my money back. The guy at the register refused and told me to come back at night and ask for Pete.    I returned later and the female \"Manager\" told me Pete wasn't there and they don't give refunds.  After ignoring me for 10 minutes she realized I wasn't going away so she called Pete on the phone. He said he would have to mail me a check  for the purchase price of the slice. Uh, the slice was $3 and, as you probably guessed, I never received the check.   In addition to the gross food, I made the mistake of entering the restroom and the stench of urine and fllth almost knocked me unconscious! Avoid this place under all circumstances!!",

This thing is a monster. I had it stuffed with feta cheese and again, a little more sauce than I like but thats just me being picky.  I had their chicked sandwhich and I was really not impressed with it.  It was advertised as being chicken tenders but it was actually grilled strips.  My friend and I both got one and mine tasted awful while he said his was fine. I'd definitely try the pizza again but avoid the chicken.",

Why promise a specific time if you don't think you'll make it? Just give me a realistic range and I'll be happy. Promise a specific time and I'll think you're late for every minute you don't meet it. The fries were obviously old and had been reheated in a microwave and extra salt added on top of the original salt to hide the flavor. The calzone was fine and came with more marinara than any place I've had. Tuna sandwich came with a bonus salad I wasn't expecting. The sandwich was fairly small though for the price though. Cheesecake was the kind you buy from the supermarket, nothing fancy. Being open this late and able to make deliveries is good, but the price vs quality vs timeliness makes me question if I'll use them again.",

    "text": "Another stop on the Pizza Bender Tour 2011 Edition, I've had this place bookmarked since last year's Pizza Bender Tour.  I was eager to finally get to try it out.  I asked for 2 Slices of Sausage Pizza, but the girl behind the counter told me that all they had was what was in front of me.....wow, this was the first time I've been told that I couldn't customize my Slice order from a Pizza joint.  OK, so I browsed the available Pizza Pies and decided to order three Slices:  Pepperoni & Jalapeno <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Z3ZSar8IVAR2qIupqxMynA?select=kfLqk6iyi4eYWlLz45uuPw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/Z3ZS...</a> Meat Pie (Bacon, Sausage, Pepperoni, Ham, Meatball, on a Double Crust) <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Z3ZSar8IVAR2qIupqxMynA?select=69kV9XIlg2VoR8DTHSuqng\">yelp.com/biz_photos/Z3ZS...</a> Super Meaty (Bacon, Sausage, Pepperoni, Canadian Bacon) <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Z3ZSar8IVAR2qIupqxMynA?select=9-R9RYbmNcXlysJbumdR9g\">yelp.com/biz_photos/Z3ZS...</a>  The total damage was 14.38 for 3 slices.....which seems like a lot to me, but  I couldn't see the per Slice price anywhere on the hand written menu.....so I just paid the bill and moved on.  It was lunch time (around 12 pm) and it was beginning to get really busy, so I quickly jumped on an open table near the door.  I asked for my Slices to be \"well done\", so it took a few extra minutes to heat them up.  It didn't take too long before I was called.  Once I brought the Pizza back to my table, I quickly realized that I ordered too much Pizza.  I could easily eat all 3 Slices, but then I'd feel too full.  The Slices are pretty big, so consider yourself warned!  The first Slice I went for was the Meat Pie.  The Crust is much thicker than the other Slices of Pizza and the Meats are buried within a ton of Cheese. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Z3ZSar8IVAR2qIupqxMynA?select=q1Ts-19RUkbAy2GEi11Ciw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/Z3ZS...</a> I liked the flavor of it although I couldn't taste the Meatballs.  The Bacon, Ham, Pepperoni, and Sausage flavors were easily identifiable and delicious.  The Double Crust was more on the edge of the Slice than throughout the Pie.  Despite wanting to eat this with my hands, I had to commit the Mortal Sin of eating Pizza and ate it with a fork because the weight of the Slice was too much for the thin Crust to bear.  Next time I'll probably just go with the Super Meaty, which is the same ingredients on their normal Thin Crust.  Next up I went for the Jalapeno & Pepperoni Slice.  Since it's NY Style Thin Crust, you have to fold this bad boy. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Z3ZSar8IVAR2qIupqxMynA?select=ZiF9E3htkJ-ux6JLyyZtkg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/Z3ZS...</a> The Pepperoni was full of flavor and the Jalapenos packed a nice kick.  The Crust was nice and crispy since I asked for it to be \"well done\".  Last but not least was the Super Meaty.  I wasn't sure if the crust would hold up with all of that Meat on it, but it did.  The Slice was full of flavor and as I mentioned above, like the Meat Pie, I could identify every Meat on the Slice except the Meatball.  This Slice is the Thin Crust version of the Meat Pie.....very delicious. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Z3ZSar8IVAR2qIupqxMynA?select=Gx_4cQ3K4pBUBY6L9974aQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/Z3ZS...</a>  Overall, I really enjoyed the Pizza here at Joe's.  However, I thought the prices were a bit high compared to other Pizza joints in Vegas.  I guess being so close to the Strip is a big factor.  Return Factor - 60%",

We've been coming here over the last couple years as one of our meals while in Vegas (usually the first night when we fly in) as there is a CVS right next door and we pick up water, snacks and other essentials before we head to the hotel.    On this most recent trip, I got the meat pie and my wife had the Hawaiian slice.  Both were really good and served up hot.  We also split a garlic cheesy bread which was pretty much a big ass pizza with only garlic and cheese.    Overall great pizza and a decent price.",

We ordered today for a delivery to the Thomas & Mack Center, told the girl on the phone \"Thomas & Mack Center\", we get a call an hour later because the driver is on the other side of campus. Ok........  I ordered a pesto panini for $9.45. NO WAY a sandwich this small should cost this much and not be inside a casino. I asked if the sandwich at least came with fries, and I was told no. So, I decided to order fries as well. When we finally got our delivery, The delivery driver informed me that my panini came with potato chips, but since I didn't say which ones I wanted he just brought a random bag. What??? If the girl taking our order on the phone had told me that, I would have held off on ordering a $4.00 order of oil-soaked, unsalted, soggy fries that I didn't end up eating in the first place. Not cool man.  My co-worker ordered mild chicken tenders and fries, she said her chicken was good, but the mild sauce was super bland. She didn't end up using too much of it. Her fries also were the same oil-soaked, unsalted soggy ones that I ordered. She also threw most of them away. We were pretty disappointed this time considering the pizza(chicken pesto) we ordered last time was REALLY good.  Bottom line, their pizza is really good and worth the price. I recommend the chicken bacon ranch and the chicken pesto pizzas. Stay away from everything else.",

Still a very solid 4 stars while being right on the cusp of 5. I wish they had a few more options for pizza by the slice. Today they only had 3 pizzas made and it was 12:30. A little more variety and I'd be inclined to up the rating.  Also, excellent job carrying Mr Pibb. As a Dr Pepper/Pibb connoisseur I find this a necessary part of my lunch.

Gentleman who served me warned me that the pizza was hot, but it was barely warm.   Drink prices are outrageous for the sizes, and the tea machine didn't even function. Just poured water out. Also, there are no prices posted of anything, besides the drinks.

I called to add a 2 liter of coke, waited 20 minutes on hold, then had someone pickup the phone and hung up. We called back to confirm that the original order was placed and add the coke, but whoever answered the phone informed me that he was cancelling the order. I clearly reiterated that I had no intention of cancelling the order, I just needed to confirm that it was being made, and to order a 2 Liter. I was told \"The order has been cancelled,\" and I was HUNG UP ON. My girlfriend talked to Jose the Superviser, and he assured her that the food was actually ready at the time the order was canceled (???) And that the order would be delivered as soon as possible... we are only 1 mile away, so 15 minutes later we called to see the status, and they told us the order was cancelled AGAIN. If they were busy, I can wait extra time for a pizza, no problem. But what happened tonight was unnacceptable to a mindboggling level. I'm going to take time out of my vacation to go back during the day to speak to a manager during the day (and no I'm not asking for free stuff). It was honestly THAT level bad.

I walked in and ordered two slices of cheese right away.   While I was waiting for them to put my pizza in the oven, I paid for my order with a credit card while reading the sign saying we card everyone if you are paying with card. The girl did not ask for my ID and there was no one behind me. So she wasn't rushed just didn't feel like doing her job well. I got two cheese slices and a soda. She gave me the combo price. Put the receipt and pen on the counter and walked away didn't even hand me my drink cup or say thank you. It's ok I can do it myself. I only worked in the hospitality industry for 10 years. You had one job, seriously a 10 year old could do it.   I encounter 5 people the first four excellent customer service the last one rude and ungrateful for my business. I live near by and I think my money might be appreciated else where.   Now to the pizza. They say it authentic Italian New York pizza. I'm a believer in a pizza is truly good if you don't have to add toppings. Meaning the crust is good, the sauce is flavorful and the cheese is good real cheese. If it's good just plain adding toppings just adds not masks the flavors. The crust was good the sauce lacked that classic Italian flavor and basically it just tasted like old pizza put in the oven. Which exactly is what it is.   So basically if NY pizza tastes like it came from the mall's food court then I'm not a fan.  Definitely not the best pizza in town. Probably just a tourist trap to get everyone from Hard Rock Hotel.",

    "text": "We tried to order pizza here two nights ago while staying at the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino Las Vegas and it went horrible.  The man who answered the phone tells my lady her card was declined cause he put the wrong zip code cause the guy was TRYING to take two orders at the same time (one in person), then corrects it and as its pending he hangs up!!!  The order of 2 large pizzas for 52 bucks goes thru when we checked our account so of course we call back immediatley wanting answers.  Another person answers and we explain what happened and that the 52 bucks was charged already but the employee hung up before confirming everything was good.  We just want to make sure the pizza order is in and is still coming cause my family is hangry.  Instead the second employee apologizes and says that due to the error they will need to return the money.  When asked when, they say call back tomorrow morning to make sure it'll get refunded but that they won't know for sure until they \"close out\" for the night.  If it all \"shakes out\" we should get it in 1 to 3 business days.  We call back and get more vague answers like \"not sure, call back in a few days\" and cant seem to reach the people we were talking to.  Wtf?!  When asked what will happen if it doesn't get returned they say we will have to open a dispute which could take who knows how long!  Absolutley unacceptable and disappointing.",

They said they would be with me in a minute, which was fine, but during that minute some else came, someone else stood behind them etc forming a line back to the door. The same person came back, ignored me and after she had taken two other customers I walked to the place next door and ordered a sub.",

The pizza was delicious and had thick slices, just wish it was a little cheaper.  *White pizza means NO sauce, not white sauce like I thought. Add pesto if you want some kind of sauce :)",

We threw in a couple of side favorites like mozzarella sticks and chicken wings. Not only did the food exceed our expectations, but in addition to that the customer service was excellent on the phone and at delivery. Yes!! Joe's will deliver (reasonable $3.50 delivery fee I believe), to your hotel on the Strip, and they operate pretty late in the night. Hands down Joe's New York Pizza will definitely get our returned business. Oh, and just a heads up, there are two good coupons on the flap of the pizza box that can be easily overlooked. I suggest you keep them for the next time you order. Keep up the good work guys!!",

I have had the opportunity maybe the last 4 times in 5 years to visit this place and wow, I have never been disappointed! The pizza is amazingly good. The portion is perfect, the flavor and creativity is awesome. Its been a tradition with my hubbster and my friends when we are in Vegas. Joe's has was it takes to make an ending of a perfect weekend of partying in Vegas unforgettable.  Quick Note: Menu has been updated since my last review, but my previous thoughts on Joe's is still very much valid. Check it..  OverALL: New York style in the sizzling desert. Pizzas that are super cool. Check it out!!",

I've been in food my whole life, this post should be a wake up call that the staff they have need a smack in the face. Gustav Mahler would never stand for this. The communication between the staff absolutely terrible. Blond guy counting money, not washing his hands before going to food. The girl at the front giving instructions to some dark haired guy with glasses who isn't listening, tables a mess... barely cleaned etc. Typical employees is why good businesses go out of business. I hate to see these type of people running a kitchen. I was going to let this go. Last time I was in there I had a piece of metal on one of my slices of pizza from a Brillo pad or from one of the oven scrapers I can't remember which. I said something to the girl and she was baffled. I just blew it off. I pretty much come here 2 to 3 times a week, the food is impeccable. This time the guy who was given instructions to heat up my pizza put it in there for about 45 seconds not enough to even get it hot. I wish there was something else I could say other than the employees need to take their foodservice job seriously.  I seriously hope JOE or his sister or the person who works her a** off cleans house. A reckoning needs to come for sure. My first review last year was a five all day!",

The pizzeria was busy as we entered and there was a wide a variety of pizzas on display that were available by the slice.  Some may find choosing difficult, but not us as we each zoned in on the white spinach pizza - mozzarella, spinach, ricotta and garlic.  It was love at first sight followed by love at first bite.  Hands down or up as you will, this was by far the best slice of pizza we have had in Las Vegas.

On visit #2 the pizza was under cooked.. Not much seasoning on the wings. Chicken Parm was cold. Not to mention they wouldn't honor the coupons on the pizza box...or the adds running on their 24/7 tv monitor in the store. There were approximately 7 employees in the kitchen just having fun. Not catering to the customers needs....Esther's Kitchen & Eataly here I come.",

They gave me a small discount to make up for it but it amounted to just a couple of bucks, not a full comp.  The employee apologized and then openly blamed his co-worker--who was within close earshot of her--for the error.  \"She's new and she forgets to print tickets.\"  That made me nervous, I'm sure she didn't like hearing that and now she may be making my food?  Then he said they would put a rush on it and it would be ready in 5-6 minutes.  That made me equally nervous, was I about to get undercooked food?  No matter, turns out their 5-6 minute \"rush\" was another 20-25 minutes.  So overall I got my food roughly an hour after I ordered it.  Again, no comp, just a \"sorry\" and a small discount.  All of that I could probably forgive if the quality of the food was mind-blowing.  It wasn't.  Very average.  Not enough sauce, and what sauce was there was pretty much just tomato chunks rather than puree, which I prefer.  Honestly, I've made better pasta in my own kitchen.  One and done.  Been there once, won't be there twice.",

I would never have thought about it again but my mom saw a delivery car recently and suggested it when we were craving pizza.   We ordered a 20\" pizza (\"humongous\", and it is). Half white spinach and half Grandee Pepperoni with garlic knots for good measure. Three of us finished about half of it. The slices could easily be cut again in half but I guess that's New York pizza! It was greasy as expected but my goodness was it good. The white spinach was for me, and I really enjoyed the earthiness of the spinach. The crust was perfect: thin and floppy at the bottom, blistered and crispy at the crust. There was plenty of ricotta to make every bite flavorful as well.   I had a few bites of the Grandee Pepperoni, apparently an award winner from 2015. It has deep fried pepperoni bites on it which gives it a nice crunch in the middle of all that greasy, saucy pepperoni. Loved the red peppers as well: they're thinly sliced rings which are hot and juicy. The garlic knots were fine, not my favorite and a little too burnt/hard for me. It didn't really matter though because I am so happy to add a third pizzeria option in the area (Naked City, Metro). Speaking of those other two, the prices here are comparable to them so i don't mind paying more for good quality. If you're looking for solid New York pizza this is the place to go!",

    "text": "If there was a ZERO option rating I'd do that. This place was recommended from our hotel front desk. It was 10 pm on a Saturday and we didn't know the area, so we called them for delivery, little did we know it would have been a spiral of bad events.   When we called to order one pizza and small wings they told us they are not able to take in cash at that time because something was wrong with their register (1). So we used a card to order, then the kid on the phone tells us it almost $50 for one pizza and 1/2 order of wings. We were so shocked at how over priced and extremely expensive it was (2), we could not believe it. Mind you we don't know this area and were on vacation, so how were we to see the average price for it in this town. We are use to pizza and wings being like $30 w/delivery. Once the kid collected our payment, is when he finally tells us our order would not be ready till after 11 pm (3). This was over an hour. Just to get our order, SMH. Unbelievable! They tells us they only have one driver but NEVER offer to ask if you could p/u instead. Once my husband and I get off the phone we decide that is WAY too late to be feeding our family. This is when LESS THAN 2 min later we call back to cancel our order. (4) When we spoke to them about cancelling they said ok that was fine, since we had just placed and it was no problem. As we're moving on from this horrific experience, we get a voicemail almost 10 min later, from John saying they SUDDENLY have this store policy that they do not accept cancellations. And that our order was already made. This is EXTREMELY unprofessional and just BAD BUSINESS. We called to cancel LESS THAN 2 min after placing it, how will you think it's ok to call a customer back 10 min after you did not cancel and FORCE us; When you failed to cancel our order to begin with. (5) My then returns their call after hearing the voicemail calls and John tells us he will not refund our money (even after we look up our bank account and saw them trying to refund in parts of transactions), because that is their store policy. Again, when we called back the 1st time to cancel they mentioned no such \"store policy\". Is this why you could not accept cash and why your \"register was broken\" so you can OVER charge innocent customers for you bad business?  This was just horrible from the start. It completely RUINED our families last night on vacation. We were robed our time and money. Not to mention the headache of having to put up with it. We have told all our friends/family/co-workers etc. about this business' bad service and warned them to stay away. NO GOOD WILL COME FROM YOU ORDERING FOOD FROM JOE'S PIZZA. STAY AWAY AND GO LITERALLY ANYWHERE ELSE. ANYWHERE.",

I thought the prices were okay too...  a little over $10 for 2 specialty slices (buffalo chicken and tomato basil) and a bottle of water. The chicken on the buffalo chicken was dry since it was sitting all day...  the tomato basil tasted much better.  The plus is that the slices were a good size.",

If you are around the strip and in the mood for some pizza, go to the Pizzeria at The Cosmopolitan.",

    "text": "Ordered the meat pie pizza last night for a hefty $42.00. I expected something amazingly delicious for the exorbitant price tag but when my pizza arrived (awesome delivery by the way), I was quite confounded. My pizza was basically a slightly oversized Domino's pizza. \"New York Pizza\"??? I thought to myself. Shocked? Slightly. Surprised? Certainly! Once again I was reminded of the pizza conundrum: people do NOT know what New York pizza is. Not to sound elitist but I am actually from New York so I feel allowed to put my two cents in here. Joe's New York Pizza, I suggest a job-related trip! New York pizza has dense, chewy, but THIN crust. The sauce is rich and tomatoey. Cheese abundant but not excessive. Toppings ON TOP of cheese, not under a dairy fire blanket of mozzarella that chokes out the deliciousness beneath. Overall I appreciate the attempt but this is not New York Pizza. Crust is fat, floppy, and airy, and as for the flavor, sauce is reminiscent of Ragu, a sin that has sent many an Italian grandmother to a premature grave. Good luck Vegas on finding some real NY pizza at a good price. Took the gamble at Joe's New York Pizza and lost more than just $42.00.",

For some reason, this location tasted better?!   Cumulatively, Their Pizza was Always on the Greasy side.. Thats a Major Negative for me. Thin NY Style pizzas, Great cheese, Another spot that loads toppings, dough just the right chewiness and crust plump with a nice hint of saltiness and sweetness. I've also tried pizzas that have this fat twisty crust, I mean Huge (Exaggerated) and it was delicous! Either eat it on its own or dip it in some marinara, pizza sauce or ranch..   My Experience: All PIzzas   - cheese, pepperoni, mushroom, sausage and a mix of each mentioned.  Their prices are quite expensive and pizza Greasy as mentioned. On a positive note,  they do bundle up the toppings and I believe they use \"Grande\" (high quality) mozarella cheese. Delivery was always quick and if your a pizza a fanatic, this place is worth a try..",

I can't really speak to how good this place is during the day, but the food court it is in (which also houses a Panda Express and Chipotle) is quite packed at around 2 AM on Saturday nights.  It's good comfort food for after clubbing.  I ordered a cheese pizza on Saturday and it tasted pretty good at the time.  Again, I can't speak to anything bout this place during the day.  It was just a good meal to eat when I was super hungry after a night out.",

However, they cannot deliver to certain hotels (in order for hotels to promote their temporary residents to eat at their central eateries-- Paris was one of them), so we had to be creative and have Joe's NY Pizza deliver to Planet Hollywood, which was right next door.  Mary (I believe that was her name) was way helpful with our ordering and suggesting foods for us to order so that we can make the most of our deal. We had a large pepperoni pizza, a large salad, soda, water, and chilled Starbucks frappuccino for the next day. Delivery was $1.50 and we gave a big tip because we had the delivery guy wait 15 minutes for us as we tore through Las Vegas Blvd to meet him.  My friend and I had a deliciously filling meal at our hotel before we prepped for a night out in town. I'm giving this place 4 stars for their wonderful service, help, and patience with us.",

In my opinion, the crust makes the pizza, even on a thin crust pizza.  We ordered a whole pizza and the crust just melted in your mouth.  I would have just liked the crust as breadsticks with sauce to dip them in, they were so good.    One of the best parts about this place is that they're open late.  2AM on school nights, and 4AM on the weekends.",

It sells pizza by the slice and by the pie, on top of pizza they have tasty salads and other yummy goodies such as chicken wings and garlic knots.  What I really enjoy is that 1) the pizza is just tasty, it is good pizza. The sizes are good, the ingredients are fresh and prices are not bad at all.  And 2) it's consistent. I really really dislike when I find a place I like and I go back and it's bad. I hate hit or miss places and Joe's is just not one of those. If I'm hungry for pizza and don't feel like searching for a new place or trying a new place I know I'll get my fill and pizza craving satisfied here.  Try the pizza here, try the other food, I doubt you'll regret it.  My favorites (I can't just pick one) are: Manhattan loaded Veggie",

What king of moron gives those things out anyway?  There is one Yelper, who admits she is not a fan of pizza, but says she liked the flavor. This actually makes sense, someone who doesn't like pizza might actually like one that has no flavor what-so-ever.  This is probably the blandest pizza dough I have ever tasted. Just plain blah.  I could not taste the sauce at all, though it was not due to the bland crust or overwhelmed by the toppings, it was just poor sauce and very little of it.  I won't say it was bad pizza, just slightly below average (somewhere below papa johns pizza and somewhere above my Norwegian grandmother's pizza).   The reason the place can't even make 2 stars is due to 2 parts - 1 - the very poor attitude of the woman who served me at the counter and; 2 - the OUTRAGEOUS price for 2 slices of pizza and a fountain drink ($14 - AYFKM?), puts this place just below crap in my book.   This place is probably kept open by an endless flux of intoxicated Hard Rockers thinking this place must be good because the sign on the door says so. Of course, they don't stick around Vegas long enough to regret their decision as I did.  Perhaps there was a time when this place served good New York pizza, but it certainly doesn't anymore. The poor quality of the food and the poor service suggest the place is barely staying open.   I wish there was a sign that we could place on the doors of establishments that said: \"We're Cutting Quality to Maximize Profits! GFY if you don't like it.\" - it would certainly be more useful.",

    "text": "Worst pizza I have ever had in my life! There was no cheese on most of my pieces & the pizza was so thin & flat that you can barely see where the cheese & veggies were suppose to be on. I ordered a veggie pizza & was super soggy & everything... literally EVERYTHING (all toppings) constantly fell when grabbing my piece. Not even the crust was appetizing, it was super hard & chewy. Paid $30 for a cold, flat, medium pizza. Was not worth it at all. Customer service was a 2 out of 5 ontop of that. The worker kept getting upset with me due to poor phone connection on his side when trying to put my order in & would yell and get mad when I informed him my hotel information in which there is more than one hotel on the Vegas strip & was upset that I wasn't being \"specific\" after giving him the address. Overall I would of gave it a zero but had to rate it in order to write a review.  Reply to business owner: (since he wants to be Smart & cannot take constructive feedback)  But yes We have tried Dominoes PLENTY OF TIMES.. not even surprisingly but knowingly it is wayy wayy better than this pizza!! I can also say customer service at Dominoes is 5x's better than what we received here. Unfortunately this was the worst experience we got from overall our trip here at Vegas which was amazing. I don't know if I can call this pizza but for those who want an honest review DON'T EVER EAT HERE!!  You can already see how service is here by the remarks & reply the business staff made due to our feedback, it's sad. Their attitude does not affect us personally but only hurts their business.",

    "text": "Stopped in for a slice. I have never been there before. Turns out 1 slice is $6. (Came to 5.95 after tax) So it isn't cheap like anything in Vegas I guess.   I asked them to heat it extra because it was still floppy and I like my pizza crispy. One of the girls remarked \"he wants three more minutes...burn it\" or something to that effect. I told her I could hear her and I just want it well cooked and crispy and not soft and floppy.   So other than the semi rude comment the pizza was good. It was crispy with the extra cook. And expensive. Not going back.  ***Update. I'm not going back because your worker was sarcastic about burning my pizza not the price. And teach them to say thank you but thanks for responding.",

Joe makes a solid pizza pie.  The crust is crunchy and sturdy enough to fold and eat - a True measure is good pizza.  The crust was not as thin as New York but overall it was a tasty pie.  We had a large (16\") with sausage and spinach.  The sausage was good and spicy with lots of fresh spinach.  There's the new coke machine where you can make your own flavor combos.    I thought it was a bit expensive; $32 bucks for pizza and soda but it is Vegas right?  Still worth the trip.",

They had an awesome menu with many options and unique specialty pizzas.  Parking - location is in a shopping center with free parking. We found a spot quickly right in front.  Food - thin crust, tasty, we ordered extra sauce on one of the pizzas but because the pizza was thin, the toppings slid off and came out a bit soggy. I would recommend the normal amount of sauce.  Price - two smalls and a medium specialty pizzas with a small garden salad came out to be $70. Not bad since it fed 6 of us and had a enough left for two more.  Order accuracy / customer service - order came out perfect even when our order was a bit more complicated! And they provided awesome customer service.",

    "text": "So....first & foremost it's 10:30pm, they close at 2am & they are mopping the floor with bleach & dirty water smell. Not saying excuse me or apologizing for the inconvenience (as they almost mopped right over my feet as I was ordering).   If that didn't happen I would have started this review out with, I am very excited about this place since it was highly recommended. As a New Yorker, I've been trying to find a great pizza place since I moved here. To be honest at this moment whole foods makes an outstanding cheese pie. Also I should mentioned i purposely went to CVS first to get lactaid pills because that's how excited I was to give this place a shot  The pizza looked horrible in the case & the greeting I received was sub par. I did order a chicken parmesan sub & could not leave here without at least trying a slice of pizza (plain warmed up). I also ordered zeppolis (they don't look like traditional zeppolis). And I don't know why I was served my since of pizza on a normal plate but everything else was served in Togo containers.   In all fairness I will have to come back & order a freshly prepared cheese pie to give it a proper review because I was not very happy with the slice I received. Not enough sauce & it was very sweet. The best part was the crust. It was just like New York crust. Very nice! I will say the slice was cooked properly.   The chicken parmesan sub was not great. The presentation was awesome. The bread was a little chewy as well as the chicken. It was ok at best.   Lastly? The non traditional Zeppolis. They are light & fluffy. Interesting the way they make them like little Donut holes. They asked if I wanted cinnamon or powdered sugar (traditional). Of course the powdered sugar. I feel like if I wanted cinnamon on my zeppolis I might as well go to Auntie Annie's. Overall they are like a 4 out of 5. The dough is more soggy than anything else. I'm not sure if it's the fryer that they used or what but there is an aftertaste I could do without.   Overall, I may be a little hard on the place but I think if they weren't cleaning & they were a little more professional I could have given a 4 star rating but I'm all about customer service not just the food. It's supposed to be a complete Experience.   I appreciate the effort & hope that when I come back things will be slightly different in a much more positive way. Nevertheless thank you for this evening. I'm grateful.",

Best New York-style pizza that I have tasted in Las Vegas so far.  The pizza is thin and crust is not soft & limp.  I can fold it in half just like in NY without it being limp.  The pizza dough/crust is super tasty!  Love it!  Sauce tastes & smells just like it was from a NY pizzeria.  My only complaint is that there is a bit too much sauce on the pizza.  Sauce should not be dripping off the slice in clumps when you take a bite.  Otherwise, it is good New York-style pizza.  Employees there are happy and super friendly!  This place is worth going back to if you have a craving for New York-style pizza!",

Idk if it was the vodka sodas or the warmth that made us not be able to stop eating them. They were melt in the mouth delicious. We also got a buff chicken pizza, an extreme and then a florentine. All were super delicious. My only complaint is that it was super pricey. Otherwise it hit the spot.",

These are a handful and def a bellyful! About the fattiest slice around and tasty as anything, these make a great takeaway to bring on the flight, too! Yum-o.",

Catered lunches when I'm on the road are a double edged sword. Tasty, perhaps. Convenient, definitely. Healthy, not a chance. I always have to watch what I eat otherwise I'd be a lot heavier. And Joe's is the type of place that I have to watch out for.  The office manager either didn't count too well or figured that all of us looked skinny and needed to add a few pounds. Because she ordered an entire large pizza for every 1.5 people.   I ate along with about a dozen others, and we finished off maybe 3 pizzas total. And a lot of these guys were on the larger side, too! But the stuffed pizza with sausage and ham and pepperoni and whatever else was just too massive. Delicious and glistening with grease, but oh so divine. Too bad there was still half a day left and I had to stave off a nap for another four hours.",

We ordered from this location at least 3 days a week here in Las Vegas, and up until last week, we were all very happy with the food and the service.  One afternoon we ordered 3 calzones, of which 2 were ok, and the third had NO MOZZ cheese inside.  I decide to complain, since it seemed to be out of character for them.  \"No problem\" they said, \"We can give you a credit on your next order\"  Our next order was the following day, which consisted of 2 orders of wings, one hot, one plain and a large pizza.  Most of the cheese and the toppings on the pizza were slid over into the box, as if it had been placed in there that way on purpose.  The dough was raw and soggy in parts.  We showed this to the delivery guy, and his comment was \"Oh that's bad.  Go ahead and keep it, we will get you a new one.\"  We thought, \"COOL\"  Then we got to the wings.... PURE RUBBER and the celery  was so old that when we bent it in half, it didn't SNAP!  I have many pictures that I tried to post on here, but JOES keeps removing them!  Last resort, we called back to tell them about the pizza and wings and what the delivery guy told us.  Again, they said, \"No problem\"  THEN 20 minutes later, they called us to say the only way they would \"replace\" the order, was if we sent the entire pizza and all the wings back.  However, the delivery guy told us to keep it.  Starving, we nibbled a bit here and there waiting for the RIGHT order to show up.  When we told the girl on the phone that some had been eaten and most thrown in the garbage, they refused to provide us with any further Customer Service.  Our company has been doing business with this establishment for over a year, and we have spent $1000's of dollars, and in the end this is how we are treated?? NEVER AGAIN!  Joes NY Pizza's Customer Service and food SUCKS!!!!",

I tried one and immediately stopped eating my sandwich and started in on those.   Only caveat, have the phone person repeat your address.

The Authentic style of preparation is on point, not to mention the overall taste. Their chef's are on the top of my list. Oh yeah, not to mention they're super fast and honest.

First night in Vegas on a semi cold weekend gateway and was craving some pizza for dinner minus the Shakeys or resturaunty pizza chain feeling and this place definitely hit the spot. None of that crap, although sometimes it's nice but sometimes you just want to find a nice causal laid back pizza place without the noisy chain feeling you know. Anyways came in got two slices of there already made pizza which was then heated up and served up while tasting pretty fresh, crunchy but not too crunchy, and pretty darn good! Not omg freaking awesome but for what I was looking for fit perfectly like ice on a rocks glass yum :p. Next time I'm in Vegas and craving a good slice of pizza I will definitely recommended ir come to this place.",

Not much NYC character to the sign or decor, but you can select from a decent selection of NY style slices which they heat up for you.

Bottom line: If you are craving some NY pizza in Vegas, definitely a great option, esp if you are near Hard Rock. 4.25 stars.",

I ordered a slice of just cheese.  It was very thin in the middle, large crusted at the end, very little sauce and very little cheese. For five dollars a slice claiming to be award winning New York pizza, I expected a lot better. I'm from New York and have been to the REAL Joe's pizza in the Village many times. When I asked what part of New York the owners from, I was told he's from Bulgaria. Really... Apparently just another guy jumping on the  New York pizza bandwagon. Being a pizza lover that's actually from New York I find this place in insult",

In fact it lacks  real NY flavor. However my issue isn't with the pizza but more with the price . At $4.16 a slice ,it's way over priced. The only time I ever paid for an over priced pizza is in Manhattan. This location in Vegas so it's not justified by any means. They even have a slice special like they used to. At least you felt your getting something. My suggestion at $4.16 it should include a small drink or make the pizza so amzing it justifies the price. In fact there is other pizza places near by that offer 2 slices and a drink for around 5 bucks.",

You can easily spend over 10bux on 2 slices and a drink, but thats ok cause they have pizza here they don't have anywhere else.   I ordered a lasagna and pepperoni sausage, while my friends ordered Hawaiian (yuck imo) and a few other kinds. I also got a side of ranch which costs 50 cents. I do not understand why some places charge for ranch, I mean their pizza is already so expensive that you think they could afford to give away a tiny container of ranch for 50 cents. Maybe its because everybody asks for it and it gets expensive but really? I am already spending 10bucks, why not throw in a ranch? /endrant  Anyways we get the pizza and it is just mush. The pizza is soggy and soft. I asked them if they could make it crispier but I really think they put it in the microwave to spite me. This place used to be awesome, but now its just a quick 24hr stop by if your hungry. I'd recommend the Pizzaeria at Cosmo any day over this place.",

We ordered the veggie pizza and the greek salad.  They delivered our food and realized they gave us a manhattan pizza (all meat).  This is fine and dandy, but i don't eat meat.  So we called them, and they pleasantly delivered my veggie pizza free of charge.    (a) they deliver (b) they are accomodating (c) they deliver  I'm down for them!!",

First I was told that it would take 45 mins-1 hour, however, then I was told it would take an 1 hour 20 minutes. Although, I thought this was a long time, I still decided to order. I called the establishment an 1 and a 30 minutes after I placed the order because I still had not heard from them and no pizza in sight. They told me 3 different stories, hung up on the phone on me, passed the phone around. First told me the ticket was in the window and it was coming, then told me the ticket was missing, then told me the ticket fell on the ground! It took me over 2 HOURS TO GET MY PIZZA. 2 HOURS!! Then I called to talk to a manager, they told me there was no manager on site. I called back the next day to talk with a manager and the manager told me that there is ALWAYS a manager and asked me why I did not talk with manager that night. THen she told me she would call me back and NEVER did. BOTTOM LINE, the food is decent, but seriously if you want a headache and HORRIBLE SERVICE then eat decent food. There are better and far better customer service pizza places out there! THIS IS BY FAR THE WORST, WORST, WORST SERVICE EVER!!! I WOULD GIVE IT ZERO STARS BUT I CANT!! THIS PLACE SUCKS!",

It was one of those pizza's that will break your willpower to stop eating until you are absolutely, undeniably and thoroughly stuffed.  Everything was perfect, the crust, the cheese, the saltiness, the parmesan.  My tongue is getting a boner right now just thinking of it.  TL;DR = Get the Greek with sausage.  You won't regret it",

IMO, I think that he decided to arrive at my location last after he made the rest of his deliveries. The pizza was luke warm, but very delicious. The french fries were cold and too soft and wet. So it was 50/50 for me!  Wow, had to edit my review, bcuz, tried this restaurant again yesterday 10/12/13. the order was worse than b4. First off, small cheese pizza, disgusting, bland, barely no sauce, and the cheese was half off the pizza, in laying inside the box, oily and greasy! the side salad was wilted, bcuz the delivery had it sitting on top of the pizza box. total waste of $18.00 delivered...never again!!!",

The only reason why I gave 4 stars vs 5 is because I also ordered their garlic knots which were not that great. They fill the knots with pesto which was extremely oily and sickening. I wish I passed on the knots and just stuck with the pizza.",

To end this, 2 people were left sitting and with hunger and Eats (Yelp) want to surprisingly give me a $2 coupon code, witch i think is worthless.  1- A taxi to get food rounndtrip is 20-30 bucks  2- food is $40 for 2 persons   3- the waste of time lack of respect is not worth $2.... plus i cant tell who is lying when the merchant said one story to me and Eats told me anlther story supposedly stating what the Merchant told them.  It really sucks!",

Taste was just passable. The Italian sub was terrible. Thought it was a cold sandwich but toasted. Turned into greasy glob of cheese and meat dusted with lettuce. Mayo melted in bread from toasting. No vinegar and oil. Served in styrofoam, not wrapped. Sliced side pickle were thin strips(equaled a quarter, what cheapos!) Would've thrown it away but cost me 10 bucks. Try one of the other places nearby. They have to be better than this.",

Of course at that hour, a couple of pizzas looked fresher than others. We chose a slice of the lasagna pizza and a slice of the sausage. The one thing memorable was the ricotta on the lasagna. Really tasty. The slices were large but it tasted like pizza you could get anywhere. Decent service.",

    "text": "After leaving a beach party extremely parched and very sleepy, I felt it was time to dig in to the carbs! I found this place that came highly recommended.  First of all I can tell you how much it cost for a slice of pizza because there were no prices listed. What I can say is that two slices of pizza with a bunch of toppings came out to around $14.99 with two drinks. So by doing the math is not bad however it's not a New York price for New York slice of pizza. I found the sauce to be kind of bland and much to be desired. I was expecting some oregano sometime or something Italian. I didn't find it here.  The good thing about this place is that it stays open till 5 a.m.. So if you left the club and you want something to eat that's quick this is definitely the spot for you. Although I enjoyed my meal and it absorbs all of the adult beverage that I consumed by the pool, I don't think I would be coming back anytime soon.",

I thought to myself where in the hell can I get pizza I was craving bad! Low and behold I use the good ole YELP ad and it suggest this place was less than a mile AND delivered to the MGM signature! Looked at the menu online and saw that the prices were high so this must be some quality pizza! After drooling from the previous pictures posted from my fellow YELPERS! I placed an online order for the \"Humongous Meat Pie\" ($41.45 plus tax and delivery $47.31) I thought to myself wtf did I order but the hell with it! They called me 2 mins later to confirm if I really placed the order! 45 minutes later o was delivered one of the most fattening greasy cheesiest pizzas I've ever had! $50 for a pizza?!

You only need 1 or 2 slices in order to be really satisfied. The only downside that I can see is the staff. Not very nice. I mean, it's NY style pizza, so that sort of comes with the territory, but it would be nice if they'd pay a little closer attention to what you're saying. They take your order and then just sort of say \"pepperoni\" when it's ready. Anybody could really just walk up and take your slice. Not a great system.  However, the food is great.

Had leftovers for lunch  Only issue is with delivery. Bally's won't let them come up to rooms. So be prepared to meet them downstairs. And know your entrances. North faces Las Vegas Blvd. but even the delivery time was impressive at only 35 minutes.",

Either way is a big fat win in the taste department.   The nice decor with old coke ads and vintage art with red and white, make for the Italian feel.  I just may become  pizza enthusiast!",

It's a small place, there are 5 or 6 tables, plastic forks and knives...The service is bad. The workers are not friendly, they are even rude. No prices listed for a slice of pizza.   I've been here for several times and had a good experience though. But the last time when I ordered from home, I was quite disappointed. First of all, I got my order in about an hour and a half. It was soggy in the middle, the crust was very thick, salty and the sauce was bland. It went to recycle bin((( Their driver explained he had made another delivery since it was on the way to me, so it took longer than it should have. Oh well who cares.  Overall, if you want to satisfy your pizza hunger, try another pizzeria. This one is expensive and isn't worth the price and nerves spent on.",

    "text": "Never have been here but seems like a cozy environment . Cashier was really friendly and showed me what was ready by the slice and tried to find the biggest slice for me to eat. Then put the slice in the oven and came out nice and hot. The crust was pretty hard but the pizza itself was pretty good. Reeaaallly pricy for one slice, I paid 5.79 for one slice  I would really have much enjoyed the food more if it was made to order but it kind of suck that the pizza that I ordered was just reheated in the oven so I feel like it was a little drier than it should've been had it been fresh. I wouldn't say that they have a lot of specials going on I have been to a place in downtown that gives you a slice of pizza and a beer for six dollars so I think the prices could be a little more flexible or at least offer a drink.",

    "text": "Date of Visit: 1/8/2016  Time: 7:41 pm  Small strip mall pizza joint that bills itself as New York pizza and has won the Best of Las Vegas 2013, 2014, and 2015 in the category of \"Best Traditional & Non Traditional Pizza.\" But don't be fooled by the awards...   I'm giving it 3 stars vs 5 stars because it's not horrible and most people would like it. Although, I debated giving it 2 stars....  This pizza wasn't to my taste. I prefer a spicier sauce vs a sweet sauce and a crispy crust or at least one that's cooked...   I love New York pizza. Give me a good hard crust, the harder the better and I'm a happy woman.   But Joe's couldn't deliver. Instead I got a crust that was limp and flaccid.   Apparently you have to ask for well done or your pizza is barely cooked. Have eaten lots of New York pizza but not once have I had to ask them to cook it.  Ordering is assembly style where one person takes the order and another rings it up.   The menu is extensive but there are no prices for slices. And that's where you get burned when you order 2 or more slices.   A slice of cheese and a slice of pepperoni cost $8.70 with tax. No drink, just 2 slices of pie. Say what?  For a few bucks more you can buy a 12\" cheese pizza.  There's a self serve all-you-can-drink fancy soda machine.  Communal seating with a single table for two by the door, table for four, two bar height tables for six and a long wraparound booth with three tables.  Would I go back? No. It wasn't the worst pizza, but I like a sauce with bite and crisp crust. I'd rather eat something I enjoy than eating just to eat. If I wanted to do that, I'd buy a sandwich from CVS.",

However, I enjoy the Paradise location's cooking better sometimes. Not sure what they do, but the staff is always on point with what they make and it never takes as long to get your food either.   FOOD   Delicious food! My go to items are the Grandee Pizza (award-winning pizza), Garlic Knots, Chicken Wings (Voted Best in Las Vegas) with the Mango Habanero sauce and the Italian Panini. Depending on how hungry I am, I'll also throw in a dessert item. For parties, I cater from Joe's NY Pizza and I always get the biggest pizza size which each slice is bigger than the size of your head! Always get rave reviews on the food when I get catering through Joe's.   SERVICE   Excellent! I can barely think of a time when they didn't treat us well. However, we are locals that frequent the place. But, I think when you're loyal to a place they should treat you well!   PRICE  I think the place is fairly priced for what you get. The portions are generous, the food quality is high, service and location is awesome and you get a pizza stamp card so after X-amount of pizza orders you get a FREE one. You can also sign up for their VIP email list and get a coupon for free chicken wings. They always have great deals so just ask them when you go there. They'll always be ready to help you!   I love this place and will definitely come back here again!",

After a few minutes they realized they didn't have a cheese slice at 11 PM, and apparently weren't going to have anymore cheese slices even though they close at 2 AM. The employee asked me if I wanted a different slice I declined. Then she asked me if I would like a refund, befuddled as to why they couldn't make a cheese pizza despite already charging me for a slice, I obliged. The employee then said they couldn't refund me because I paid with card but they would let the manager know and that they would reverse the charge. Not only was that not True but they also took the liberty of adding the tip I included. I am contacting my bank and disputing the charge off principle",

We were pleasantly surprised to see that they offered more than the typical pepperoni pizza. Joe's had an assortment of unique pizza options, which you could view through the glass display they had set up. The cashier was very friendly and explained all the different options and gave his recommendations. My boyfriend and I did not plan on eating pizza that day, but once we laid eyes on their meat pie, we knew we had to get a slice! It was not the best slice of pizza I have had, but it was something I had never tried or heard of before! Basically it was cheese pizza filled with spaghetti!!Overall, the meat pie was very good and satisfying.One slice is all you need to fill up!",

    "text": "We stayed at the Hardrock Hotel and found what we thought, was a New York Style pizza.   We were in the mood for pizza and buffalo wings, Simple enough. My husband and I  ordered a small pepperoni pizza and order of 10 mild buffalo wings, which totaled to 24.95, ordered to go. When we got to our room we opened the pizza box (to the naked eye it looked like a regular pepperoni pizza) When I picked up the first slice the toppings slid right off. I put the toppings back on and took a bite and.... the pizza was doughy, uncooked and just bleh! So I moved on to the Buffalo wings. I ordered mild because most of the time when I order hot, the sauce is just fire hot! Well apparently mild means no sauce,  and when I took a bite of the chicken it tasted like previously frozen/old chicken, not good AT ALL!  Long story short it all tasted like shit and was not worth the money. Even if I had been drunk I think it still would have tasted like shit.",

People are out of their mind!!  Thin and perfectly crispy crust, just melts in your mouth. Perfect ratio of ingredients, and the pepperoni is nice and crispy. I'm considering going back and getting two more slices!!  Please don't ever change!",

I've had the calzones here too, and it was very filling and very tasty. It's big food so come with an empty stomach. You WILL be satisified, and not disappointed.",

From the polite order taker on the phone to the fast delivery (both by Chris) my family and I were very happy we ordered from Joe's. We ordered a \"gigantic\" size half veggie and half frat boy pizza. When our order arrived it was upgraded to \"humongous\" size at no extra cost! What more can you ask for?! We will definitely order from Joe's again.",

He said 8 minutes, lots of traffic. I said is the food on its way, I said has driver actually left, he would not answer the question. It is now 10:06 pm and nothing while I breathe in the fumes at the valet area of the hotel. What a joke. Number one on Yelp, who stuffed those ballets. Run to a different location. Why have a restaurant if you don't do what you say. I'm still starving.",
